<h3>In Which We Begin Not To Understand.</h3>

<br>

<p class="first">
IT is not without a certain emotion that I begin to recount
here the extraordinary adventures of Joseph Rouletabille. Down to
the present time he had so firmly opposed my doing it that I had
come to despair of ever publishing the most curious of police
stories of the past fifteen years. I had even imagined that the
public would never know the whole truth of the prodigious case
known as that of "The Yellow Room," out of which grew so many
mysterious, cruel, and sensational dramas, with which my friend
was so closely mixed up, if, à propos of a recent nomination of
the illustrious Stangerson to the grade of grand-cross of the
Legion of Honour, an evening journal&mdash;in an article,
miserable for its ignorance, or audacious for its
perfidy&mdash;had not resuscitated a terrible adventure of which
Joseph Rouletabille had told me he wished to be for ever
forgotten.</p>

<p>"The Yellow Room!" Who now remembers this affair which caused
so much ink to flow fifteen years ago? Events are so quickly
forgotten in Paris. Has not the very name of the Nayves trial and
the tragic history of the death of little Menaldo passed out of
mind? And yet the public attention was so deeply interested in
the details of the trial that the occurrence of a ministerial
crisis was completely unnoticed at the time. Now "The Yellow
Room" trial, which preceded that of the Nayves by some years,
made far more noise. The entire world hung for months over this
obscure problem&mdash;the most obscure, it seems to me, that has
ever challenged the perspicacity of our police or taxed the
conscience of our judges. The solution of the problem baffled
everybody who tried to find it. It was like a dramatic rebus with
which old Europe and new America alike became fascinated. That
is, in truth&mdash;I am permitted to say, because there cannot be
any author's vanity in all this, since I do nothing more than
transcribe facts on which an exceptional documentation enables me
to throw a new light&mdash;that is because, in truth, I do not
know that, in the domain of reality or imagination, one can
discover or recall to mind anything comparable, in its mystery,
with the natural mystery of "The Yellow Room."</p>

<p>That which nobody could find out, Joseph Rouletabille, aged
eighteen, then a reporter engaged on a leading journal, succeeded
in discovering. But when, at the Assize Court, he brought in the
key to the whole case, he did not tell the whole truth. He only
allowed so much of it to appear as sufficed to ensure the
acquittal of an innocent man. The reasons which he had for his
reticence no longer exist. Better still, the time has come for my
friend to speak out fully. You are going to know all; and,
without further preamble, I am going to place before your eyes
the problem of "The Yellow Room" as it was placed before the eyes
of the entire world on the day following the enactment of the
drama at the Château du Glandier.</p>

<p>On the 25th of October, 1892, the following note appeared in
the latest edition of the "Temps":&mdash;</p>

<p>"A frightful crime has been committed at the Glandier, on the
border of the forest of Sainte-Geneviève, above Epinay-sur-Orge,
at the house of Professor Stangerson. On that night, while the
master was working in his laboratory, an attempt was made to
assassinate Mademoiselle Stangerson, who was sleeping in a
chamber adjoining this laboratory. The doctors do not answer for
the life of Mdlle. Stangerson."</p>

<p>The impression made on Paris by this news may be easily
imagined. Already, at that time, the learned world was deeply
interested in the labours of Professor Stangerson and his
daughter. These labours&mdash;the first that were attempted in
radiography&mdash;served to open the way for Monsieur and Madame
Curie to the discovery of radium. It was expected the Professor
would shortly read to the Academy of Sciences a sensational paper
on his new theory,&mdash;the Dissociation of Matter,&mdash;a
theory destined to overthrow from its base the whole of official
science, which based itself on the principle of the Conservation
of Energy.</p>

<p>On the following day, the newspapers were full of the tragedy.
The "Matin," among others, published the following article,
entitled: "A Supernatural Crime":&mdash;</p>

<p>"These are the only details," wrote the anonymous writer in
the "Matin"&mdash;"we have been able to obtain concerning the
crime of the Château du Glandier. The state of despair in which
Professor Stangerson is plunged, and the impossibility of getting
any information from the lips of the victim, have rendered our
investigations and those of justice so difficult that, at
present, we cannot form the least idea of what has passed in 'The
Yellow Room' in which Mdlle. Stangerson, in her night-dress, was
found lying on the floor in the agonies of death. We have, at
least, been able to interview Daddy Jacques&mdash;as he is called
in the country&mdash;an old servant in the Stangerson family.
Daddy Jacques entered 'The Yellow Room' at the same time as the
Professor. This chamber adjoins the laboratory. Laboratory and
Yellow Room are in a pavilion at the end of the park, about three
hundred metres (a thousand feet) from the château.</p>

<p>"'It was half-past twelve at night,' this honest old man told
us, 'and I was in the laboratory, where Monsieur Stangerson was
still working, when the thing happened. I had been cleaning and
putting instruments in order all the evening and was waiting for
Monsieur Stangerson to go to bed. Mademoiselle Stangerson had
worked with her father up to midnight; when the twelve strokes of
midnight had sounded by the cuckoo-clock in the laboratory, she
rose, kissed Monsieur Stangerson and bade him good-night. To me
she said "bonsoir, Daddy Jacques" as she passed into "The Yellow
Room." We heard her lock the door and shoot the bolt, so that I
could not help laughing, and said to Monsieur: "There's
Mademoiselle double-locking herself in,&mdash;she must be afraid
of the '<i>Bête du bon Dieu!</i>'" Monsieur did not even hear me,
he was so deeply absorbed in what he was doing. Just then we
heard the distant miawing of a cat. "Is that going to keep us
awake all night?" I said to myself; for I must tell you,
Monsieur, that, to the end of October, I live in an attic of the
pavilion over The Yellow Room, so that Mademoiselle should not be
left alone through the night in the lonely park. It was the fancy
of Mademoiselle to spend the fine weather in the pavilion; no
doubt, she found it more cheerful than the château and, for the
four years it had been built, she had never failed to take up her
lodging there in the spring. With the return of winter,
Mademoiselle returns to the château, for there is no fireplace in
The Yellow Room.</p>

<p>"'We were staying in the pavilion, then&mdash;Monsieur
Stangerson and me. We made no noise. He was seated at his desk.
As for me, I was sitting on a chair, having finished my work and,
looking at him, I said to myself: "What a man!&mdash;what
intelligence!&mdash;what knowledge!" I attach importance to the
fact that we made no noise; for, because of that, the assassin
certainly thought that we had left the place. And, suddenly,
while the cuckoo was sounding the half after midnight, a
desperate clamour broke out in The Yellow Room. It was the voice
of Mademoiselle, crying "Murder!&mdash;murder!&mdash;help!"
Immediately afterwards revolver shots rang out and there was a
great noise of tables and furniture being thrown to the ground,
as if in the course of a struggle, and again the voice of
Mademoiselle calling,
"Murder!&mdash;help!&mdash;Papa!&mdash;Papa!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'You may be sure that we quickly sprang up and that Monsieur
Stangerson and I threw ourselves upon the door. But alas! it was
locked, fast locked, on the inside, by the care of Mademoiselle,
as I have told you, with key and bolt. We tried to force it open,
but it remained firm. Monsieur Stangerson was like a madman, and
truly, it was enough to make him one, for we heard Mademoiselle
still calling "Help!&mdash;help!" Monsieur Stangerson showered
terrible blows on the door, and wept with rage and sobbed with
despair and helplessness.</p>

<p>"'It was then that I had an inspiration. "The assassin must
have entered by the window!" I cried;&mdash;"I will go to the
window!" and I rushed from the pavilion and ran like one out of
his mind.</p>

<p>"'The inspiration was that the window of The Yellow Room looks
out in such a way that the park wall, which abuts on the
pavilion, prevented my at once reaching the window. To get up to
it one has first to go out of the park. I ran towards the gate
and, on my way, met Bernier and his wife, the gate-keepers, who
had been attracted by the pistol reports and by our cries. In a
few words I told them what had happened, and directed the
concierge to join Monsieur Stangerson with all speed, while his
wife came with me to open the park gate. Five minutes later she
and I were before the window of The Yellow Room.</p>

<p>"'The moon was shining brightly and I saw clearly that no one
had touched the window. Not only were the bars that protect it
intact, but the blinds inside of them were drawn, as I had myself
drawn them early in the evening, as I did every day, though
Mademoiselle, knowing that I was tired from the heavy work I had
been doing, had begged me not to trouble myself, but leave her to
do it; and they were just as I had left them, fastened with an
iron catch on the inside. The assassin, therefore, could not have
passed either in or out that way; but neither could I get in.</p>

<p>"'It was unfortunate,&mdash;enough to turn one's brain! The
door of the room locked on the inside and the blinds on the only
window also fastened on the inside; and Mademoiselle still
calling for help!&mdash;No! she had ceased to call. She was dead,
perhaps. But I still heard her father, in the pavilion, trying to
break down the door.</p>

<p>"'With the concierge I hurried back to the pavilion. The door,
in spite of the furious attempts of Monsieur Stangerson and
Bernier to burst it open, was still holding firm; but at length,
it gave way before our united efforts,&mdash;and then what a
sight met our eyes! I should tell you that, behind us, the
concierge held the laboratory lamp&mdash;a powerful lamp, that
lit the whole chamber.</p>

<p>"'I must also tell you, monsieur, that The Yellow Room is a
very small room. Mademoiselle had furnished it with a fairly
large iron bedstead, a small table, a night-commode, a
dressing-table, and two chairs. By the light of the big lamp we
saw all at a glance. Mademoiselle, in her night-dress, was lying
on the floor in the midst of the greatest disorder. Tables and
chairs had been overthrown, showing that there had been a violent
struggle. Mademoiselle had certainly been dragged from her bed.
She was covered with blood and had terrible marks of finger-nails
on her throat,&mdash;the flesh of her neck having been almost
torn by the nails. From a wound on the right temple a stream of
blood had run down and made a little pool on the floor. When
Monsieur Stangerson saw his daughter in that state, he threw
himself on his knees beside her, uttering a cry of despair. He
ascertained that she still breathed. As to us, we searched for
the wretch who had tried to kill our mistress, and I swear to
you, monsieur, that, if we had found him, it would have gone hard
with him!</p>

<p>"'But how to explain that he was not there, that he had
already escaped? It passes all imagination!&mdash;Nobody under
the bed, nobody behind the furniture!&mdash;All that we
discovered were traces, blood-stained marks of a man's large hand
on the walls and on the door; a big handkerchief red with blood,
without any initials, an old cap, and many fresh footmarks of a
man on the floor,&mdash;footmarks of a man with large feet whose
boot-soles had left a sort of sooty impression. How had this man
got away? How had he vanished? Don't forget, monsieur, that there
is no chimney in The Yellow Room. He could not have escaped by
the door, which is narrow, and on the threshold of which the
concierge stood with the lamp, while her husband and I searched
for him in every corner of the little room, where it is
impossible for anyone to hide himself. The door, which had been
forced open against the wall, could not conceal anything behind
it, as we assured ourselves. By the window, still in every way
secured, no flight had been possible. What then?&mdash;I began to
believe in the Devil.</p>

<p>"'But we discovered my revolver on the floor!&mdash;Yes,
<i>my</i> revolver! Oh! that brought me back to the reality! The
Devil would not have needed to steal my revolver to kill
Mademoiselle. The man who had been there had first gone up to my
attic and taken my revolver from the drawer where I kept it. We
then ascertained, by counting the cartridges, that the assassin
had fired two shots. Ah! it was fortunate for me that Monsieur
Stangerson was in the laboratory when the affair took place and
had seen with his own eyes that I was there with him; for
otherwise, with this business of my revolver, I don't know where
we should have been,&mdash;<i>I</i> should now be under lock and
bar. Justice wants no more to send a man to the scaffold!'"</p>

<p>The editor of the "Matin" added to this interview the
following lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have, without interrupting him, allowed Daddy Jacques to
recount to us roughly all he knows about the crime of The Yellow
Room. We have reproduced it in his own words, only sparing the
reader the continual lamentations with which he garnished his
narrative. It is quite understood, Daddy Jacques, quite
understood, that you are very fond of your masters; and you want
them to know it, and never cease repeating it&mdash;especially
since the discovery of your revolver. It is your right, and we
see no harm in it. We should have liked to put some further
questions to Daddy Jacques&mdash;Jacques&mdash;Louis
Moustier&mdash;but the inquiry of the examining magistrate, which
is being carried on at the château, makes it impossible for us to
gain admission at the Glandier; and, as to the oak wood, it is
guarded by a wide circle of policemen, who are jealously watching
all traces that can lead to the pavilion, and that may perhaps
lead to the discovery of the assassin.</p>

<p>"We have also wished to question the concierges, but they are
invisible. Finally, we have waited in a roadside inn, not far
from the gate of the château, for the departure of Monsieur de
Marquet, the magistrate of Corbeil. At half-past five we saw him
and his clerk and, before he was able to enter his carriage, had
an opportunity to ask him the following question:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Can you, Monsieur de Marquet, give us any information as to
this affair, without inconvenience to the course of your
inquiry?'</p>

<p>"'It is impossible for us to do it,' replied Monsieur de
Marquet. 'I can only say that it is the strangest affair I have
ever known. The more we think we know something, the further we
are from knowing anything!'</p>

<p>"We asked Monsieur de Marquet to be good enough to explain his
last words; and this is what he said,&mdash;the importance of
which no one will fail to recognise:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'If nothing is added to the material facts so far
established, I fear that the mystery which surrounds the
abominable crime of which Mademoiselle Stangerson has been the
victim will never be brought to light; but it is to be hoped, for
the sake of our human reason, that the examination of the walls,
and of the ceiling of The Yellow Room&mdash;an examination which
I shall to-morrow intrust to the builder who constructed the
pavilion four years ago&mdash;will afford us the proof that may
not discourage us. For the problem is this: we know by what way
the assassin gained admission,&mdash;he entered by the door and
hid himself under the bed, awaiting Mademoiselle Stangerson. But
how did he leave? How did he escape? If no trap, no secret door,
no hiding-place, no opening of any sort is found; if the
examination of the walls&mdash;even to the demolition of the
pavilion&mdash;does not reveal any passage practicable&mdash;not
only for a human being, but for any being whatsoever&mdash;if the
ceiling shows no crack, if the floor hides no underground
passage, one must really believe in the Devil, as Daddy Jacques
says!'"</p>

<p>And the anonymous writer in the "Matin" added in this
article&mdash;which I have selected as the most interesting of
all those that were published on the subject of this
affair&mdash;that the examining magistrate appeared to place a
peculiar significance to the last sentence: "One must really
believe in the Devil, as Jacques says."</p>

<p>The article concluded with these lines: "We wanted to know
what Daddy Jacques meant by the cry of the <i>Bête du Bon
Dieu</i>. The landlord of the Donjon Inn explained to us that it
is the particularly sinister cry which is uttered sometimes at
night by the cat of an old woman,&mdash;Mother Angenoux, as she
is called in the country. Mother Angenoux is a sort of saint, who
lives in a hut in the heart of the forest, not far from the
grotto of Sainte-Geneviève.</p>

<p>"The Yellow Room, the <i>Bête du Bon Dieu</i>, Mother
Angenoux, the Devil, Sainte-Geneviève, Daddy Jacques,&mdash;here
is a well entangled crime which the stroke of a pickaxe in the
wall may disentangle for us to-morrow. Let us at least hope that,
for the sake of our human reason, as the examining magistrate
says. Meanwhile, it is expected that Mademoiselle
Stangerson&mdash;who has not ceased to be delirious and only
pronounces one word distinctly, 'Murderer! Murderer!'&mdash;will
not live through the night."</p>

<p>In conclusion, and at a late hour, the same journal announced
that the Chief of the Sûreté had telegraphed to the famous
detective, Frédéric Larsan, who had been sent to London for an
affair of stolen securities, to return immediately to Paris.</p>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>In Which Joseph Rouletabille Appears For The First Time</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
I REMEMBER as well as if it had occurred yesterday, the entry
of young Rouletabille into my bedroom that morning. It was about
eight o'clock and I was still in bed reading the article in the
"Matin" relative to the Glandier crime.</p>

<p>But, before going further, it is time that I present my friend
to the reader.</p>

<p>I first knew Joseph Rouletabille when he was a young reporter.
At that time I was a beginner at the Bar and often met him in the
corridors of examining magistrates, when I had gone to get a
"permit to communicate" for the prison of Mazas, or for
Saint-Lazare. He had, as they say, "a good nut." He seemed to
have taken his head&mdash;round as a bullet&mdash;out of a box of
marbles, and it is from that, I think, that his comrades of the
press&mdash;all determined billiard-players&mdash;had given him
that nickname, which was to stick to him and be made illustrious
by him. He was always as red as a tomato, now gay as a lark, now
grave as a judge. How, while still so young&mdash;he was only
sixteen and a half years old when I saw him for the first
time&mdash;had he already won his way on the press? That was what
everybody who came into contact with him might have asked, if
they had not known his history. At the time of the affair of the
woman cut in pieces in the Rue Oberskampf&mdash;another forgotten
story&mdash;he had taken to one of the editors of the
"Epoque,"&mdash;a paper then rivalling the "Matin" for
information,&mdash;the left foot, which was missing from the
basket in which the gruesome remains were discovered. For this
left foot the police had been vainly searching for a week, and
young Rouletabille had found it in a drain where nobody had
thought of looking for it. To do that he had dressed himself as
an extra sewer-man, one of a number engaged by the administration
of the city of Paris, owing to an overflow of the Seine.</p>

<p>When the editor-in-chief was in possession of the precious
foot and informed as to the train of intelligent deductions the
boy had been led to make, he was divided between the admiration
he felt for such detective cunning in a brain of a lad of sixteen
years, and delight at being able to exhibit, in the "morgue
window" of his paper, the left foot of the Rue Oberkampf.</p>

<p>"This foot," he cried, "will make a great headline."</p>

<p>Then, when he had confided the gruesome packet to the medical
lawyer attached to the journal, he asked the lad, who was shortly
to become famous as Rouletabille, what he would expect to earn as
a general reporter on the "Epoque"?</p>

<p>"Two hundred francs a month," the youngster replied modestly,
hardly able to breathe from surprise at the proposal.</p>

<p>"You shall have two hundred and fifty," said the
editor-in-chief; "only you must tell everybody that you have been
engaged on the paper for a month. Let it be quite understood that
it was not you but the 'Epoque' that discovered the left foot of
the Rue Oberkampf. Here, my young friend, the man is nothing, the
paper everything."</p>

<p>Having said this, he begged the new reporter to retire, but
before the youth had reached the door he called him back to ask
his name. The other replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Joseph Josephine."</p>

<p>"That's not a name," said the editor-in-chief, "but since you
will not be required to sign what you write it is of no
consequence."</p>

<p>The boy-faced reporter speedily made himself many friends, for
he was serviceable and gifted with a good humour that enchanted
the most severe-tempered and disarmed the most zealous of his
companions. At the Bar café, where the reporters assembled before
going to any of the courts, or to the Prefecture, in search of
their news of crime, he began to win a reputation as an
unraveller of intricate and obscure affairs which found its way
to the office of the Chief of the Sûreté. When a case was worth
the trouble and Rouletabille&mdash;he had already been given his
nickname&mdash;had been started on the scent by his
editor-in-chief, he often got the better of the most famous
detective.</p>

<p>It was at the Bar café that I became intimately acquainted
with him. Criminal lawyers and journalists are not enemies, the
former need advertisement, the latter information. We chatted
together, and I soon warmed towards him. His intelligence was so
keen, and so original!&mdash;and he had a quality of thought such
as I have never found in any other person.</p>

<p>Some time after this I was put in charge of the law news of
the "Cri du Boulevard." My entry into journalism could not but
strengthen the ties which united me to Rouletabille. After a
while, my new friend being allowed to carry out an idea of a
judicial correspondence column, which he was allowed to sign
"Business," in the "Epoque," I was often able to furnish him with
the legal information of which he stood in need.</p>

<p>Nearly two years passed in this way, and the better I knew
him, the more I learned to love him; for, in spite of his
careless extravagance, I had discovered in him what was,
considering his age, an extraordinary seriousness of mind.
Accustomed as I was to seeing him gay and, indeed, often too gay,
I would many times find him plunged in the deepest melancholy. I
tried then to question him as to the cause of this change of
humour, but each time he laughed and made me no answer. One day,
having questioned him about his parents, of whom he never spoke,
he left me, pretending not to have heard what I said.</p>

<p>While things were in this state between us, the famous case of
"The Yellow Room" took place. It was this case which was to rank
him as the leading newspaper reporter, and to obtain for him the
reputation of being the greatest detective in the world. It
should not surprise us to find in the one man the perfection of
two such lines of activity if we remember that the daily press
was already beginning to transform itself and to become what it
is to-day&mdash;the gazette of crime.</p>

<p>Morose-minded people may complain of this; for myself I regard
it a matter for congratulation. We can never have too many arms,
public or private, against the criminal. To this some people may
answer that, by continually publishing the details of crimes, the
press ends by encouraging their commission. But then, with some
people we can never do right.</p>

<p>Rouletabille, as I have said, entered my room that morning of
the 26th of October, 1892. He was looking redder than usual, and
his eyes were bulging out of his head, as the phrase is, and
altogether he appeared to be in a state of extreme excitement. He
waved the "Matin" with a trembling hand, and cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Sainclair,&mdash;have you read it?"</p>

<p>"The Glandier crime?"</p>

<p>"Yes; 'The Yellow Room'!&mdash;What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"I think that it must have been the Devil or the <i>Bête du
Bon Dieu</i> that committed the crime."</p>

<p>"Be serious!"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't much believe in murderers who make their escape
through walls of solid brick. I think Daddy Jacques did wrong to
leave behind him the weapon with which the crime was committed
and, as he occupied the attic immediately above Mademoiselle
Stangerson's room, the builder's job ordered by the examining
magistrate will give us the key of the enigma and it will not be
long before we learn by what natural trap, or by what secret
door, the old fellow was able to slip in and out, and return
immediately to the laboratory to Monsieur Stangerson, without his
absence being noticed. That, of course, is only an
hypothesis."</p>

<p>Rouletabille sat down in an armchair, lit his pipe, which he
was never without, smoked for a few minutes in silence&mdash;no
doubt to calm the excitement which, visibly, dominated
him&mdash;and then replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Young man," he said, in a tone the sad irony of which I will
not attempt to render, "young man, you are a lawyer and I doubt
not your ability to save the guilty from conviction; but if you
were a magistrate on the bench, how easy it would be for you to
condemn innocent persons!&mdash;You are really gifted, young
man!"</p>

<p>He continued to smoke energetically, and then went
on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No trap will be found, and the mystery of 'The Yellow Room'
will become more and more mysterious. That's why it interests me.
The examining magistrate is right; nothing stranger than this
crime has ever been known."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea of the way by which the murderer escaped?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"None," replied Rouletabille&mdash;"none, for the present. But
I have an idea as to the revolver; the murderer did not use
it."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! By whom, then, was it used?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;by Mademoiselle Stangerson."</p>

<p>"I don't understand,&mdash;or rather, I have never
understood," I said.</p>

<p>Rouletabille shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Is there nothing in this article in the 'Matin' by which you
were particularly struck?"</p>

<p>"Nothing,&mdash;I have found the whole of the story it tells
equally strange."</p>

<p>"Well, but&mdash;the locked door&mdash;with the key on the
inside?"</p>

<p>"That's the only perfectly natural thing in the whole
article."</p>

<p>"Really!&mdash;And the bolt?"</p>

<p>"The bolt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the bolt&mdash;also inside the room&mdash;a still
further protection against entry? Mademoiselle Stangerson took
quite extraordinary precautions! It is clear to me that she
feared someone. That was why she took such precautions&mdash;even
Daddy Jacques's revolver&mdash;without telling him of it. No
doubt she didn't wish to alarm anybody, and least of all, her
father. What she dreaded took place, and she defended herself.
There was a struggle, and she used the revolver skilfully enough
to wound the assassin in the hand&mdash;which explains the
impression on the wall and on the door of the large,
blood-stained hand of the man who was searching for a means of
exit from the chamber. But she didn't fire soon enough to avoid
the terrible blow on the right temple."</p>

<p>"Then the wound on the temple was not done with the
revolver?"</p>

<p>"The paper doesn't say it was, and I don't think it was;
because logically it appears to me that the revolver was used by
Mademoiselle Stangerson against the assassin. Now, what weapon
did the murderer use? The blow on the temple seems to show that
the murderer wished to stun Mademoiselle Stangerson,&mdash;after
he had unsuccessfully tried to strangle her. He must have known
that the attic was inhabited by Daddy Jacques, and that was one
of the reasons, I think, why he must have used a quiet
weapon,&mdash;a life-preserver, or a hammer."</p>

<p>"All that doesn't explain how the murderer got out of 'The
Yellow Room,'" I observed.</p>

<p>"Evidently," replied Rouletabille, rising, "and that is what
has to be explained. I am going to the Château du Glandier, and
have come to see whether you will go with me."</p>

<p>"I?"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy. I want you. The 'Epoque' has definitely
entrusted this case to me, and I must clear it up as quickly as
possible."</p>

<p>"But in what way can I be of any use to you?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Robert Darzac is at the Château du Glandier."</p>

<p>"That's true. His despair must be boundless."</p>

<p>"I must have a talk with him."</p>

<p>Rouletabille said it in a tone that surprised me.</p>

<p>"Is it because&mdash;you think there is something to be got
out of him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>That was all he would say. He retired to my sitting-room,
begging me to dress quickly.</p>

<p>I knew Monsieur Robert Darzac from having been of great
service to him in a civil action, while I was acting as secretary
to Maître Barbet Delatour. Monsieur Robert Darzac, who was at
that time about forty years of age, was a professor of physics at
the Sorbonne. He was intimately acquainted with the Stangersons,
and, after an assiduous seven years' courtship of the daughter,
had been on the point of marrying her. In spite of the fact that
she has become, as the phrase goes, "a person of a certain age,"
she was still remarkably good-looking.</p>

<p>While I was dressing I called out to Rouletabille, who was
impatiently moving about my sitting-room:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you any idea as to the murderer's station in life?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied; "I think if he isn't a man in society, he
is, at least, a man belonging to the upper class. But that,
again, is only an impression."</p>

<p>"What has led you to form it?"</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;the greasy cap, the common handkerchief, and the
marks of the rough boots on the floor," he replied.</p>

<p>"I understand," I said; "murderers don't leave traces behind
them which tell the truth."</p>

<p>"We shall make something out of you yet, my dear Sainclair,"
concluded Rouletabille.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>A Man Has Passed Like A Shadow Through The Blinds.</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
HALF an hour later Rouletabille and I were on the platform of
the Orleans station, awaiting the departure of the train which
was to take us to Epinay-sur-Orge.</p>

<p>On the platform we found Monsieur de Marquet and his
Registrar, who represented the Judicial Court of Corbeil.
Monsieur de Marquet had spent the night in Paris, assisting in
the final rehearsal, at the Scala, of a little play of which he
was the unknown author, signing himself simply "Castigat
Ridendo."</p>

<p>Monsieur Marquet was beginning to be a "noble old gentleman."
Generally he was extremely polite and full of gay humour, and in
all his life had had but one passion,&mdash;that of dramatic art.
Throughout his magisterial career he was interested solely in
cases capable of furnishing him with something in the nature of a
drama. Though he might very well have aspired to the highest
judicial positions, he had never really worked for anything but
to win a success at the romantic Porte-Saint-Martin, or at the
sombre Odéon.</p>

<p>Because of the mystery which shrouded it, the case of "The
Yellow Room" was certain to fascinate so theatrical a mind. It
interested him enormously, and he threw himself into it, less as
a magistrate eager to know the truth, than as an amateur of
dramatic embroglios, tending wholly to mystery and intrigue, who
dreads nothing so much as the explanatory final act.</p>

<p>So that, at the moment of meeting him, I heard Monsieur de
Marquet say to the Registrar with a sigh:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope, my dear Monsieur Maleine, this builder with his
pickaxe will not destroy so fine a mystery."</p>

<p>"Have no fear," replied Monsieur Maleine, "his pickaxe may
demolish the pavilion, perhaps, but it will leave our case
intact. I have sounded the walls and examined the ceiling and
floor and I know all about it. I am not to be deceived."</p>

<p>Having thus reassured his chief, Monsieur Maleine, with a
discreet movement of the head, drew Monsieur de Marquet's
attention to us. The face of that gentleman clouded, and, as he
saw Rouletabille approaching, hat in hand, he sprang into one of
the empty carriages saying, half aloud to his Registrar, as he
did so, "Above all, no journalists!"</p>

<p>Monsieur Maleine replied in the same tone, "I understand!" and
then tried to prevent Rouletabille from entering the same
compartment with the examining magistrate.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, gentlemen,&mdash;this compartment is
reserved."</p>

<p>"I am a journalist, Monsieur, engaged on the 'Epoque,'" said
my young friend with a great show of gesture and politeness, "and
I have a word or two to say to Monsieur de Marquet."</p>

<p>"Monsieur is very much engaged with the inquiry he has in
hand."</p>

<p>"Ah! his inquiry, pray believe me, is absolutely a matter of
indifference to me. I am no scavenger of odds and ends," he went
on, with infinite contempt in his lower lip, "I am a theatrical
reporter; and this evening I shall have to give a little account
of the play at the Scala."</p>

<p>"Get in, sir, please," said the Registrar.</p>

<p>Rouletabille was already in the compartment. I went in after
him and seated myself by his side. The Registrar followed and
closed the carriage-door.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Marquet looked at him.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir," Rouletabille began, "You must not be angry with
Monsieur de Maleine. It is not with Monsieur de Marquet that I
desire to have the honour of speaking, but with Monsieur
'Castigat Ridendo.' Permit me to congratulate
you&mdash;personally, as well as the writer for the 'Epoque.'"
And Rouletabille, having first introduced me, introduced
himself.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Marquet, with a nervous gesture, caressed his
beard into a point, and explained to Rouletabille, in a few
words, that he was too modest an author to desire that the veil
of his pseudonym should be publicly raised, and that he hoped the
enthusiasm of the journalist for the dramatist's work would not
lead him to tell the public that Monsieur "Castigat Ridendo" and
the examining magistrate of Corbeil were one and the same
person.</p>

<p>"The work of the dramatic author may interfere," he said,
after a slight hesitation, "with that of the magistrate,
especially in a province where one's labours are little more than
routine."</p>

<p>"Oh, you may rely on my discretion!" cried Rouletabille.</p>

<p>The train was in motion.</p>

<p>"We have started!" said the examining magistrate, surprised at
seeing us still in the carriage.</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur,&mdash;truth has started," said Rouletabille,
smiling amiably,&mdash;"on its way to the Château du Glandier. A
fine case, Monsieur de Marquet,&mdash;a fine case!"</p>

<p>"An obscure&mdash;incredible, unfathomable, inexplicable
affair&mdash;and there is only one thing <i>I</i> fear, Monsieur
Rouletabille,&mdash;that the journalists will be trying to
explain it."</p>

<p>My friend felt this a rap on his knuckles.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said simply, "that is to be feared. They meddle in
everything. As for my interest, monsieur, I only referred to it
by mere chance,&mdash;the mere chance of finding myself in the
same train with you, and in the same compartment of the same
carriage."</p>

<p>"Where are you going, then?" asked Monsieur de Marquet.</p>

<p>"To the Château du Glandier," replied Rouletabille, without
turning.</p>

<p>"You'll not get in, Monsieur Rouletabille!"</p>

<p>"Will you prevent me?" said my friend, already prepared to
fight.</p>

<p>"Not I!&mdash;I like the press and journalists too well to be
in any way disagreeable to them; but Monsieur Stangerson has
given orders for his door to be closed against everybody, and it
is well guarded. Not a journalist was able to pass through the
gate of the Glandier yesterday."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Marquet compressed his lips and seemed ready to
relapse into obstinate silence. He only relaxed a little when
Rouletabille no longer left him in ignorance of the fact that we
were going to the Glandier for the purpose of shaking hands with
an "old and intimate friend," Monsieur Robert Darzac&mdash;a man
whom Rouletabille had perhaps seen once in his life.</p>

<p>"Poor Robert!" continued the young reporter, "this dreadful
affair may be his death,&mdash;he is so deeply in love with
Mademoiselle Stangerson."</p>

<p>"His sufferings are truly painful to witness," escaped like a
regret from the lips of Monsieur de Marquet.</p>

<p>"But it is to be hoped that Mademoiselle Stangerson's life
will be saved."</p>

<p>"Let us hope so. Her father told me yesterday that, if she
does not recover, it will not be long before he joins her in the
grave. What an incalculable loss to science his death would
be!"</p>

<p>"The wound on her temple is serious, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Evidently; but, by a wonderful chance, it has not proved
mortal. The blow was given with great force."</p>

<p>"Then it was not with the revolver she was wounded," said
Rouletabille, glancing at me in triumph.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Marquet appeared greatly embarrassed.</p>

<p>"I didn't say anything&mdash;I don't want to say
anything&mdash;I will not say anything," he said. And he turned
towards his Registrar as if he no longer knew us.</p>

<p>But Rouletabille was not to be so easily shaken off. He moved
nearer to the examining magistrate and, drawing a copy of the
"Matin" from his pocket, he showed it to him and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is one thing, Monsieur, which I may enquire of you
without committing an indiscretion. You have, of course, seen the
account given in the 'Matin'? It is absurd, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Not in the slightest, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"What! The Yellow Room has but one barred window&mdash;the
bars of which have not been moved&mdash;and only one door, which
had to be broken open&mdash;and the assassin was not found!"</p>

<p>"That's so, monsieur,&mdash;that's so. That's how the matter
stands."</p>

<p>Rouletabille said no more but plunged into thought. A quarter
of an hour thus passed.</p>

<p>Coming back to himself again he said, addressing the
magistrate:&mdash;</p>

<p>"How did Mademoiselle Stangerson wear her hair on that
evening?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Monsieur de Marquet.</p>

<p>"That's a very important point," said Rouletabille. "Her hair
was done up in bands, wasn't it? I feel sure that on that
evening, the evening of the crime, she had her hair arranged in
bands."</p>

<p>"Then you are mistaken, Monsieur Rouletabille," replied the
magistrate; "Mademoiselle Stangerson that evening had her hair
drawn up in a knot on the top of her head,&mdash;her usual way of
arranging it&mdash;her forehead completely uncovered. I can
assure you, for we have carefully examined the wound. There was
no blood on the hair, and the arrangement of it has not been
disturbed since the crime was committed."</p>

<p>"You are sure! You are sure that, on the night of the crime,
she had not her hair in bands?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure," the magistrate continued, smiling, "because I
remember the Doctor saying to me, while he was examining the
wound, 'It is a great pity Mademoiselle Stangerson was in the
habit of drawing her hair back from her forehead. If she had worn
it in bands, the blow she received on the temple would have been
weakened.' It seems strange to me that you should attach so much
importance to this point."</p>

<p>"Oh! if she had not her hair in bands, I give it up," said
Rouletabille, with a despairing gesture.</p>

<p>"And was the wound on her temple a bad one?" he asked
presently.</p>

<p>"Terrible."</p>

<p>"With what weapon was it made?"</p>

<p>"That is a secret of the investigation."</p>

<p>"Have you found the weapon&mdash;whatever it was?"</p>

<p>The magistrate did not answer.</p>

<p>"And the wound in the throat?"</p>

<p>Here the examining magistrate readily confirmed the decision
of the doctor that, if the murderer had pressed her throat a few
seconds longer, Mademoiselle Stangerson would have died of
strangulation.</p>

<p>"The affair as reported in the 'Matin,'" said Rouletabille
eagerly, "seems to me more and more inexplicable. Can you tell
me, Monsieur, how many openings there are in the pavilion? I mean
doors and windows."</p>

<p>"There are five," replied Monsieur de Marquet, after having
coughed once or twice, but no longer resisting the desire he felt
to talk of the whole of the incredible mystery of the affair he
was investigating. "There are five, of which the door of the
vestibule is the only entrance to the pavilion,&mdash;a door
always automatically closed, which cannot be opened, either from
the outer or inside, except with the two special keys which are
never out of the possession of either Daddy Jacques or Monsieur
Stangerson. Mademoiselle Stangerson had no need for one, since
Daddy Jacques lodged in the pavilion and because, during the
daytime, she never left her father. When they, all four, rushed
into The Yellow Room, after breaking open the door of the
laboratory, the door in the vestibule remained closed as usual
and, of the two keys for opening it, Daddy Jacques had one in his
pocket, and Monsieur Stangerson the other. As to the windows of
the pavilion, there are four; the one window of The Yellow Room
and those of the laboratory looking out on to the country; the
window in the vestibule looking into the park."</p>

<p>"It is by that window that he escaped from the pavilion!"
cried Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" demanded Monsieur de Marquet, fixing a
strange look on my young friend.</p>

<p>"We'll see later how he got away from The Yellow Room,"
replied Rouletabille, "but he must have left the pavilion by the
vestibule window."</p>

<p>"Once more,&mdash;how do you know that?"</p>

<p>"How? Oh, the thing is simple enough! As soon as he found he
could not escape by the door of the pavilion his only way out was
by the window in the vestibule, unless he could pass through a
grated window. The window of The Yellow Room is secured by iron
bars, because it looks out upon the open country; the two windows
of the laboratory have to be protected in like manner for the
same reason. As the murderer got away, I conceive that he found a
window that was not barred,&mdash;that of the vestibule, which
opens on to the park,&mdash;that is to say, into the interior of
the estate. There's not much magic in all that."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Monsieur de Marquet, "but what you have not
guessed is that this single window in the vestibule, though it
has no iron bars, has solid iron blinds. Now these iron blinds
have remained fastened by their iron latch; and yet we have proof
that the murderer made his escape from the pavilion by
<i>that</i> window! Traces of blood on the inside wall and on the
blinds as well as on the floor, and footmarks, of which I have
taken the measurements, attest the fact that the murderer made
his escape that way. But then, how did he do it, seeing that the
blinds remained fastened on the inside? He passed through them
like a shadow. But what is more bewildering than all is that it
is impossible to form any idea as to how the murderer got out of
The Yellow Room, or how he got across the laboratory to reach the
vestibule! Ah, yes, Monsieur Rouletabille, it is altogether as
you said, a fine case, the key to which will not be discovered
for a long time, I hope."</p>

<p>"You hope, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>Monsieur de Marquet corrected himself.</p>

<p>"I do not hope so,&mdash;I think so."</p>

<p>"Could that window have been closed and refastened after the
flight of the assassin?" asked Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"That is what occurred to me for a moment; but it would imply
an accomplice or accomplices,&mdash;and I don't see&mdash;"</p>

<p>After a short silence he added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;if Mademoiselle Stangerson were only well enough
to-day to allow of her being questioned!"</p>

<p>Rouletabille following up his thought, asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And the attic?&mdash;There must be some opening to that?"</p>

<p>"Yes; there is a window, or rather skylight, in it, which, as
it looks out towards the country, Monsieur Stangerson has had
barred, like the rest of the windows. These bars, as in the other
windows, have remained intact, and the blinds, which naturally
open inwards, have not been unfastened. For the rest, we have not
discovered anything to lead us to suspect that the murderer had
passed through the attic."</p>

<p>"It seems clear to you, then, Monsieur, that the murderer
escaped&mdash;nobody knows how&mdash;by the window in the
vestibule?"</p>

<p>"Everything goes to prove it."</p>

<p>"I think so, too," confessed Rouletabille gravely.</p>

<p>After a brief silence, he continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you have not found any traces of the murderer in the
attic, such as the dirty footmarks similar to those on the floor
of The Yellow Room, you must come to the conclusion that it was
not he who stole Daddy Jacques's revolver."</p>

<p>"There are no footmarks in the attic other than those of Daddy
Jacques himself," said the magistrate with a significant turn of
his head. Then, after an apparent decision, he added: "Daddy
Jacques was with Monsieur Stangerson in the laboratory&mdash;and
it was lucky for him he was."</p>

<p>"Then what part did his revolver play in the tragedy?&mdash;It
seems very clear that this weapon did less harm to Mademoiselle
Stangerson than it did to the murderer."</p>

<p>The magistrate made no reply to this question, which doubtless
embarrassed him. "Monsieur Stangerson," he said, "tells us that
the two bullets have been found in The Yellow Room, one embedded
in the wall stained with the impression of a red hand&mdash;a
man's large hand&mdash;and the other in the ceiling."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! in the ceiling!" muttered Rouletabille. "In the
ceiling! That's very curious!&mdash;In the ceiling!"</p>

<p>He puffed awhile in silence at his pipe, enveloping himself in
the smoke. When we reached Savigny-sur-Orge, I had to tap him on
the shoulder to arouse him from his dream and come out on to the
platform of the station.</p>

<p>There the magistrate and his Registrar bowed to us, and, by
rapidly getting into a cab that was awaiting them, made us
understand that they had seen enough of us.</p>

<p>"How long will it take to walk to the Château du Glandier?"
Rouletabille asked one of the railway porters.</p>

<p>"An hour and a half or an hour and three quarters&mdash;easy
walking," the man replied.</p>

<p>Rouletabille looked up at the sky and, no doubt, finding its
appearance satisfactory, took my arm and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come on!&mdash;I need a walk."</p>

<p>"Are things getting less entangled?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it!" he said, "more entangled than ever! It's
true, I have an idea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you what it is just at present&mdash;it's an
idea involving the life or death of two persons at least."</p>

<p>"Do you think there were accomplices?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it&mdash;"</p>

<p>We fell into silence. Presently he went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was a bit of luck, our falling in with that examining
magistrate and his Registrar, eh? What did I tell you about that
revolver?"</p>

<p>His head was bent down, he had his hands in his pockets, and
he was whistling. After a while I heard him murmur:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poor woman!"</p>

<p>"Is it Mademoiselle Stangerson you are pitying?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she's a noble woman and worthy of being pitied!&mdash;a
woman of a great, a very great character&mdash;I imagine&mdash;I
imagine."</p>

<p>"You know her then?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. I have never seen her but once."</p>

<p>"Why, then, do you say that she is a woman of great
character?"</p>

<p>"Because she bravely faced the murderer; because she
courageously defended herself&mdash;and, above all, because of
the bullet in the ceiling."</p>

<p>I looked at Rouletabille and inwardly wondered whether he was
not mocking me, or whether he had not suddenly gone out of his
senses. But I saw that he had never been less inclined to laugh,
and the brightness of his keenly intelligent eyes assured me that
he retained all his reason. Then, too, I was used to his broken
way of talking, which only left me puzzled as to his meaning,
till, with a very few clear, rapidly uttered words, he would make
the drift of his ideas clear to me, and I saw that what he had
previously said, and which had appeared to me void of meaning,
was so thoroughly logical that I could not understand how it was
I had not understood him sooner.</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>In The Bosom Of Wild Nature</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
THE Château du Glandier is one of the oldest châteaux in the
Ile de France, where so many building remains of the feudal
period are still standing. Built originally in the heart of the
forest, in the reign of Philip le Bel, it now could be seen a few
hundred yards from the road leading from the village of
Sainte-Geneviève to Monthery. A mass of inharmonious structures,
it is dominated by a donjon. When the visitor has mounted the
crumbling steps of this ancient donjon, he reaches a little
plateau where, in the seventeenth century, Georges Philibert de
Sequigny, Lord of the Glandier, Maisons-Neuves and other places,
built the existing town in an abominably rococo style of
architecture.</p>

<p>It was in this place, seemingly belonging entirely to the
past, that Professor Stangerson and his daughter installed
themselves to lay the foundations for the science of the future.
Its solitude, in the depths of woods, was what, more than all,
had pleased them. They would have none to witness their labours
and intrude on their hopes, but the aged stones and grand old
oaks. The Glandier&mdash;ancient Glandierum&mdash;was so called
from the quantity of glands (acorns) which, in all times, had
been gathered in that neighbourhood. This land, of present
mournful interest, had fallen back, owing to the negligence or
abandonment of its owners, into the wild character of primitive
nature. The buildings alone, which were hidden there, had
preserved traces of their strange metamorphoses. Every age had
left on them its imprint; a bit of architecture with which was
bound up the remembrance of some terrible event, some bloody
adventure. Such was the château in which science had taken
refuge&mdash;a place seemingly designed to be the theatre of
mysteries, terror, and death.</p>

<p>Having explained so far, I cannot refrain from making one
further reflexion. If I have lingered a little over this
description of the Glandier, it is not because I have reached the
right moment for creating the necessary atmosphere for the
unfolding of the tragedy before the eyes of the reader. Indeed,
in all this matter, my first care will be to be as simple as is
possible. I have no ambition to be an author. An author is always
something of a romancer, and God knows, the mystery of "The
Yellow Room" is quite full enough of real tragic horror to
require no aid from literary effects. I am, and only desire to
be, a faithful "reporter." My duty is to report the event; and I
place the event in its frame&mdash;that is all. It is only
natural that you should know where the things happened.</p>

<p>I return to Monsieur Stangerson. When he bought the estate,
fifteen years before the tragedy with which we are engaged
occurred, the Château du Glandier had for a long time been
unoccupied. Another old château in the neighbourhood, built in
the fourteenth century by Jean de Belmont, was also abandoned, so
that that part of the country was very little inhabited. Some
small houses on the side of the road leading to Corbeil, an inn,
called the "Auberge du Donjon," which offered passing hospitality
to waggoners; these were about all to represent civilisation in
this out-of-the-way part of the country, but a few leagues from
the capital.</p>

<p>But this deserted condition of the place had been the
determining reason for the choice made by Monsieur Stangerson and
his daughter. Monsieur Stangerson was already celebrated. He had
returned from America, where his works had made a great stir. The
book which he had published at Philadelphia, on the "Dissociation
of Matter by Electric Action," had aroused opposition throughout
the whole scientific world. Monsieur Stangerson was a Frenchman,
but of American origin. Important matters relating to a legacy
had kept him for several years in the United States, where he had
continued the work begun by him in France, whither he had
returned in possession of a large fortune. This fortune was a
great boon to him; for, though he might have made millions of
dollars by exploiting two or three of his chemical discoveries
relative to new processes of dyeing, it was always repugnant to
him to use for his own private gain the wonderful gift of
invention he had received from nature. He considered he owed it
to mankind, and all that his genius brought into the world went,
by this philosophical view of his duty, into the public lap.</p>

<p>If he did not try to conceal his satisfaction at coming into
possession of this fortune, which enabled him to give himself up
to his passion for pure science, he had equally to rejoice, it
seemed to him, for another cause. Mademoiselle Stangerson was, at
the time when her father returned from America and bought the
Glandier estate, twenty years of age. She was exceedingly pretty,
having at once the Parisian grace of her mother, who had died in
giving her birth, and all the splendour, all the riches of the
young American blood of her parental grandfather, William
Stangerson. A citizen of Philadelphia, William Stangerson had
been obliged to become naturalised in obedience to family
exigencies at the time of his marriage with a French lady, she
who was to be the mother of the illustrious Stangerson. In that
way the professor's French nationality is accounted for.</p>

<p>Twenty years of age, a charming blonde, with blue eyes,
milk-white complexion, and radiant with divine health, Mathilde
Stangerson was one of the most beautiful marriageable girls in
either the old or the new world. It was her father's duty, in
spite of the inevitable pain which a separation from her would
cause him, to think of her marriage; and he was fully prepared
for it. Nevertheless, he buried himself and his child at the
Glandier at the moment when his friends were expecting him to
bring her out into society. Some of them expressed their
astonishment, and to their questions he answered: "It is my
daughter's wish. I can refuse her nothing. She has chosen the
Glandier."</p>

<p>Interrogated in her turn, the young girl replied calmly:
"Where could we work better than in this solitude?" For
Mademoiselle Stangerson had already begun to collaborate with her
father in his work. It could not at the time be imagined that her
passion for science would lead her so far as to refuse all the
suitors who presented themselves to her for over fifteen years.
So secluded was the life led by the two, father and daughter,
that they showed themselves only at a few official receptions
and, at certain times in the year, in two or three friendly
drawing-rooms, where the fame of the professor and the beauty of
Mathilde made a sensation. The young girl's extreme reserve did
not at first discourage suitors; but at the end of a few years,
they tired of their quest.</p>

<p>One alone persisted with tender tenacity and deserved the name
of "eternal fiancé," a name he accepted with melancholy
resignation; that was Monsieur Robert Darzac. Mademoiselle
Stangerson was now no longer young, and it seemed that, having
found no reason for marrying at five-and-thirty, she would never
find one. But such an argument evidently found no acceptance with
Monsieur Robert Darzac. He continued to pay his court&mdash;if
the delicate and tender attention with which he ceaselessly
surrounded this woman of five-and-thirty could be called
courtship&mdash;in face of her declared intention never to
marry.</p>

<p>Suddenly, some weeks before the events with which we are
occupied, a report&mdash;to which nobody attached any importance,
so incredible did it sound&mdash;was spread about Paris, that
Mademoiselle Stangerson had at last consented to "crown" the
inextinguishable flame of Monsieur Robert Darzac! It needed that
Monsieur Robert Darzac himself should not deny this matrimonial
rumour to give it an appearance of truth, so unlikely did it seem
to be well founded. One day, however, Monsieur Stangerson, as he
was leaving the Academy of Science, announced that the marriage
of his daughter and Monsieur Robert Darzac would be celebrated in
the privacy of the Château du Glandier, as soon as he and his
daughter had put the finishing touches to their report summing up
their labours on the "Dissociation of Matter." The new household
would install itself in the Glandier, and the son-in-law would
lend his assistance in the work to which the father and daughter
had dedicated their lives.</p>

<p>The scientific world had barely had time to recover from the
effect of this news, when it learned of the attempted
assassination of Mademoiselle under the extraordinary conditions
which we have detailed and which our visit to the château was to
enable us to ascertain with yet greater precision. I have not
hesitated to furnish the reader with all these retrospective
details, known to me through my business relations with Monsieur
Robert Darzac. On crossing the threshold of "The Yellow Room" he
was as well posted as I was.</p>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="chaphead">In Which Joseph Rouletabille Makes A Remark
To Monsieur Robert Darzac Which Produces Its Little Effect.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
ROULETABILLE and I had been walking for several minutes, by
the side of a long wall bounding the vast property of Monsieur
Stangerson and had already come within sight of the entrance
gate, when our attention was drawn to an individual who, half
bent to the ground, seemed to be so completely absorbed in what
he was doing as not to have seen us coming towards him. At one
time he stooped so low as almost to touch the ground; at another
he drew himself up and attentively examined the wall; then he
looked into the palm of one of his hands, and walked away with
rapid strides. Finally he set off running, still looking into the
palm of his hand. Rouletabille had brought me to a standstill by
a gesture.</p>

<p>"Hush! Frédéric Larsan is at work! Don't let us disturb
him!"</p>

<p>Rouletabille had a great admiration for the celebrated
detective. I had never before seen him, but I knew him well by
reputation. At that time, before Rouletabille had given proof of
his unique talent, Larsan was reputed as the most skilful
unraveller of the most mysterious and complicated crimes. His
reputation was world-wide, and the police of London, and even of
America, often called him in to their aid when their own national
inspectors and detectives found themselves at the end of their
wits and resources.</p>

<p>No one was astonished, then, that the head of the Sûreté had,
at the outset of the mystery of "The Yellow Room," telegraphed
his precious subordinate to London, where he had been sent on a
big case of stolen securities, to return with all haste. Frédéric
who, at the Sûreté, was called the "great Frédéric," had made all
speed, doubtless knowing by experience that, if he was
interrupted in what he was doing, it was because his services
were urgently needed in another direction; so, as Rouletabille
said, he was that morning already "at work." We soon found out in
what it consisted.</p>

<p>What he was continually looking at in the palm of his right
hand was nothing but his watch, the minute hand of which he
appeared to be noting intently. Then he turned back still
running, stopping only when he reached the park gate, where he
again consulted his watch and then put it away in his pocket,
shrugging his shoulders with a gesture of discouragement. He
pushed open the park gate, reclosed and locked it, raised his
head and, through the bars, perceived us. Rouletabille rushed
after him, and I followed. Frédéric Larsan waited for us.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Fred," said Rouletabille, raising his hat and
showing the profound respect, based on admiration, which the
young reporter felt for the celebrated detective, "can you tell
me whether Monsieur Robert Darzac is at the château at this
moment? Here is one of his friends, of the Paris Bar, who desires
to speak with him."</p>

<p>"I really don't know, Monsieur Rouletabille," replied Fred,
shaking hands with my friend, whom he had several times met in
the course of his difficult investigations. "I have not seen
him."</p>

<p>"The concierges will be able to inform us no doubt?" said
Rouletabille, pointing to the lodge the door and windows of which
were close shut.</p>

<p>"The concierges will not be able to give you any information,
Monsieur Rouletabille."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because they were arrested half an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Arrested!" cried Rouletabille; "then they are the
murderers!"</p>

<p>Frédéric Larsan shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"When you can't arrest the real murderer," he said with an air
of supreme irony, "you can always indulge in the luxury of
discovering accomplices."</p>

<p>"Did you have them arrested, Monsieur Fred?"</p>

<p>"Not I!&mdash;I haven't had them arrested. In the first place,
I am pretty sure that they have not had anything to do with the
affair, and then because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because of what?" asked Rouletabille eagerly.</p>

<p>"Because of nothing," said Larsan, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Because there were no accomplices!" said Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"Aha!&mdash;you have an idea, then, about this matter?" said
Larsan, looking at Rouletabille intently, "yet you have seen
nothing, young man,&mdash;you have not yet gained admission
here!"</p>

<p>"I shall get admission."</p>

<p>"I doubt it. The orders are strict."</p>

<p>"I shall gain admission, if you let me see Monsieur Robert
Darzac. Do that for me. You know we are old friends. I beg of
you, Monsieur Fred. Do you remember the article I wrote about you
on the gold bar case?"</p>

<p>The face of Rouletabille at the moment was really funny to
look at. It showed such an irresistible desire to cross the
threshold beyond which some prodigious mystery had occurred; it
appealed with so much eloquence, not only of the mouth and eyes,
but with all its features, that I could not refrain from bursting
into laughter. Frédéric Larsan, no more than myself, could retain
his gravity. Meanwhile, standing on the other side of the gate,
he calmly put the key in his pocket. I closely scrutinised
him.</p>

<p>He might be about fifty years of age. He had a fine head, his
hair turning grey; a colourless complexion, and a firm profile.
His forehead was prominent, his chin and cheeks clean shaven. His
upper lip, without moustache, was finely chiselled. His eyes were
rather small and round, with a look in them that was at once
searching and disquieting. He was of middle height and well
built, with a general bearing elegant and gentlemanly. There was
nothing about him of the vulgar policeman. In his way, he was an
artist, and one felt that he had a high opinion of himself. The
sceptical tone of his conversation was that of a man who had been
taught by experience. His strange profession had brought him into
contact with so many crimes and villainies that it would have
been remarkable if his nature had not been a little hardened.</p>

<p>Larsan turned his head at the sound of a vehicle which had
come from the château and reached the gate behind him. We
recognised the cab which had conveyed the examining magistrate
and his Registrar from the station at Epinay.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Frédéric Larsan, "if you want to speak with
Monsieur Robert Darzac, he is here."</p>

<p>The cab was already at the park gate and Robert Darzac was
begging Frédéric Larsan to open it for him, explaining that he
was pressed for time to catch the next train leaving Epinay for
Paris. Then he recognised me. While Larsan was unlocking the
gate, Monsieur Darzac inquired what had brought me to the
Glandier at such a tragic moment. I noticed that he was
frightfully pale, and that his face was lined as if from the
effects of some terrible suffering.</p>

<p>"Is Mademoiselle getting better?" I immediately asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "She will be saved perhaps. She <i>must</i> be
saved!"</p>

<p>He did not add "or it will be my death"; but I felt that the
phrase trembled on his pale lips.</p>

<p>Rouletabille intervened:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are in a hurry, Monsieur; but I must speak with you. I
have something of the greatest importance to tell you."</p>

<p>Frédéric Larsan interrupted:&mdash;</p>

<p>"May I leave you?" he asked of Robert Darzac. "Have you a key,
or do you wish me to give you this one."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I have a key and will lock the gate."</p>

<p>Larsan hurried off in the direction of the château, the
imposing pile of which could be perceived a few hundred yards
away.</p>

<p>Robert Darzac, with knit brow, was beginning to show
impatience. I presented Rouletabille as a good friend of mine,
but, as soon as he learnt that the young man was a journalist, he
looked at me very reproachfully, excused himself, under the
necessity of having to reach Epinay in twenty minutes, bowed, and
whipped up his horse. But Rouletabille had seized the bridle and,
to my utter astonishment, stopped the carriage with a vigorous
hand. Then he gave utterance to a sentence which was utterly
meaningless to me.</p>

<p>"The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden
its brightness."</p>

<p>The words had hardly left the lips of Rouletabille than I saw
Robert Darzac quail. Pale as he was, he became paler. His eyes
were fixed on the young man in terror, and he immediately
descended from the vehicle in an inexpressible state of
agitation.</p>

<p>"Come!&mdash;come in!" he stammered.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, and with a sort of fury, he
repeated:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us go, monsieur."</p>

<p>He turned up by the road he had come from the château,
Rouletabille still retaining his hold on the horse's bridle. I
addressed a few words to Monsieur Darzac, but he made no answer.
My looks questioned Rouletabille, but his gaze was elsewhere.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>In The Heart Of The Oak Grove.</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
WE reached the château, and, as we approached it, saw four
gendarmes pacing in front of a little door in the ground floor of
the donjon. We soon learned that in this ground floor, which had
formerly served as a prison, Monsieur and Madame Bernier, the
concierges, were confined.</p>

<p>Monsieur Robert Darzac led us into the modern part of the
château by a large door, protected by a projecting awning&mdash;a
"marquise" as it is called. Rouletabille who had resigned the
horse and the cab to the care of a servant, never took his eyes
off Monsieur Darzac. I followed his look and perceived that it
was directed solely towards the gloved hands of the Sorbonne
professor. When we were in a tiny sitting-room fitted with old
furniture, Monsieur Darzac turned to Rouletabille and said
sharply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>The reporter answered in an equally sharp tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To shake you by the hand."</p>

<p>Darzac shrank back.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>Evidently he understood, what I also understood, that my
friend suspected him of the abominable attempt on the life of
Mademoiselle Stangerson. The impression of the blood-stained hand
on the walls of "The Yellow Room" was in his mind. I looked at
the man closely. His haughty face with its expression ordinarily
so straightforward was at this moment strangely troubled. He held
out his right hand and, referring to me, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As you are a friend of Monsieur Sainclair who has rendered me
invaluable services in a just cause, monsieur, I see no reason
for refusing you my hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rouletabille did not take the extended hand. Lying with the
utmost audacity, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I have lived several years in Russia, where I have
acquired the habit of never taking any but an ungloved hand."</p>

<p>I thought that the Sorbonne professor would express his anger
openly, but, on the contrary, by a visibly violent effort, he
calmed himself, took off his gloves, and showed his hands; they
were unmarked by any cicatrice.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"No!" replied Rouletabille. "My dear friend," he said, turning
to me, "I am obliged to ask you to leave us alone for a
moment."</p>

<p>I bowed and retired, stupefied by what I had seen and heard. I
could not understand why Monsieur Robert Darzac had not already
shown the door to my impertinent, insulting, and stupid friend. I
was angry myself with Rouletabille at that moment, for his
suspicions, which had led to this scene of the gloves.</p>

<p>For some twenty minutes I walked about in front of the
château, trying vainly to link together the different events of
the day. What was in Rouletabille's mind? Was it possible that he
thought Monsieur Robert Darzac to be the murderer? How could it
be thought that this man, who was to have married Mademoiselle
Stangerson in the course of a few days, had introduced himself
into "The Yellow Room" to assassinate his fiancée? I could find
no explanation as to how the murderer had been able to leave "The
Yellow Room"; and so long as that mystery, which appeared to me
so inexplicable, remained unexplained, I thought it was the duty
of all of us to refrain from suspecting anybody. But, then, that
seemingly senseless phrase&mdash;"The presbytery has lost nothing
of its charm, nor the garden its brightness"&mdash;still rung in
my ears. What did it mean? I was eager to rejoin Rouletabille and
question him.</p>

<p>At that moment the young man came out of the château in the
company of Monsieur Robert Darzac, and, extraordinary to relate,
I saw, at a glance, that they were the best of friends.</p>

<p>"We are going to 'The Yellow Room.' Come with us,"
Rouletabille said to me. "You know, my dear boy, I am going to
keep you with me all day. We'll breakfast together somewhere
about here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll breakfast with me, here, gentlemen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, thanks," replied the young man. "We shall breakfast at
the Donjon Inn."</p>

<p>"You'll fare very badly there; you'll not find
anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think so? Well, I hope to find something there,"
replied Rouletabille. "After breakfast, we'll set to work again.
I'll write my article and if you'll be so good as to take it to
the office for me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Won't you come back with me to Paris?"</p>

<p>"No; I shall remain here."</p>

<p>I turned towards Rouletabille. He spoke quite seriously, and
Monsieur Robert Darzac did not appear to be in the least degree
surprised.</p>

<p>We were passing by the donjon and heard wailing voices.
Rouletabille asked:</p>

<p>"Why have these people been arrested?"</p>

<p>"It is a little my fault," said Monsieur Darzac. "I happened
to remark to the examining magistrate yesterday that it was
inexplicable that the concierges had had time to hear the
revolver shots, to dress themselves, and to cover so great a
distance as that which lies between their lodge and the pavilion,
in the space of two minutes; for not more than that interval of
time had elapsed after the firing of the shots when they were met
by Daddy Jacques."</p>

<p>"That was suspicious evidently," acquiesced Rouletabille. "And
were they dressed?"</p>

<p>"That is what is so incredible&mdash;they were
dressed&mdash;completely&mdash;not one part of their costume
wanting. The woman wore sabots, but the man had on laced boots.
Now they assert that they went to bed at half-past nine. On
arriving this morning, the examining magistrate brought with him
from Paris a revolver of the same calibre as that found in the
room (for he couldn't use the one held for evidence), and made
his Registrar fire two shots in 'The Yellow Room' while the doors
and windows were closed. We were with him in the lodge of the
concierges, and yet we heard nothing, not a sound. The concierges
have lied, of that there can be no doubt. They must have been
already waiting, not far from the pavilion, waiting for
something! Certainly they are not to be accused of being the
authors of the crime, but their complicity is not improbable.
That was why Monsieur de Marquet had them arrested at once."</p>

<p>"If they had been accomplices," said Rouletabille, "they would
not have been there at all. When people throw themselves into the
arms of justice with the proofs of complicity on them, you can be
sure they are <i>not</i> accomplices. I don't believe there are
any accomplices in this affair."</p>

<p>"Then, why were they abroad at midnight? Why don't they
say?"</p>

<p>"They have certainly some reason for their silence. What that
reason is, has to be found out; for, even if they are not
accomplices, it may be of importance. Everything that took place
on such a night is important."</p>

<p>We had crossed an old bridge thrown over the Douve and were
entering the part of the park called the Oak Grove. The oaks here
were centuries old. Autumn had already shrivelled their tawny
leaves, and their high branches, black and contorted, looked like
horrid heads of hair, mingled with quaint reptiles such as the
ancient sculptors have made on the head of Medusa. This place,
which Mademoiselle found cheerful and in which she lived in the
summer season, appeared to us as sad and funereal now. The soil
was black and muddy from the recent rains and the rotting of the
fallen leaves; the trunks of the trees were black and the sky
above us was now, as if in mourning, charged with great, heavy
clouds.</p>

<p>And it was in this sombre and desolate retreat that we saw the
white walls of the pavilion as we approached. A queer-looking
building without a window visible on the side by which we neared
it. A little door alone marked the entrance to it. It might have
passed for a tomb, a vast mausoleum in the midst of a thick
forest. As we came nearer, we were able to make out its
disposition. The building obtained all the light it needed from
the south, that is to say, from the open country. The little door
closed on the park. Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson must
have found it an ideal seclusion for their work and their
dreams.</p>

<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="c00071-images/TheMysteryOfTheYellowRoom-E-Plan1.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">Ground Plan of Pavilion.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Here is the ground plan of the pavilion. It had a ground-floor
which was reached by a few steps, and above it was an attic, with
which we need not concern ourselves. The plan of the ground-floor
only, sketched roughly, is what I here submit to the reader.</p>

<p class="quote">1. The Yellow Room, with its one window and its
one door opening into the laboratory.</p>

<p class="quote">2. Laboratory, with its two large, barred
windows and its doors, one serving for the vestibule, the other
for The Yellow Room.</p>

<p class="quote">3. Vestibule, with its unbarred window and door
opening into the park.</p>

<p class="quote">4. Lavatory.</p>

<p class="quote">5. Stairs leading to the attic.</p>

<p class="quote">6. Large and the only chimney in the pavilion,
serving for the experiments of the laboratory.</p>

<br>

<p>The plan was drawn by Rouletabille, and I assured myself that
there was not a line in it that was wanting to help to the
solution of the problem then set before the police. With the
lines of this plan and the description of its parts before them,
my readers will know as much as Rouletabille knew when he entered
the pavilion for the first time. With him they may now ask: How
did the murderer escape from The Yellow Room?</p>

<p>Before mounting the three steps leading up to the door of the
pavilion, Rouletabille stopped and asked Monsieur Darzac point
blank:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What was the motive for the crime?"</p>

<p>"Speaking for myself, Monsieur, there can be no doubt on the
matter," said Mademoiselle Stangerson's fiancé, greatly
distressed. "The marks of the fingers, the deep scratches on the
chest and throat of Mademoiselle Stangerson show that the wretch
who attacked her attempted to commit a frightful crime. The
medical experts who examined these traces yesterday affirm that
they were made by the same hand as that which left its red
imprint on the wall; an enormous hand, Monsieur, much too large
to go into my gloves," he added with an indefinable smile.</p>

<p>"Could not that blood-stained hand," I interrupted, "have been
the hand of Mademoiselle Stangerson who, in the moment of
falling, had pressed it against the wall, and, in slipping,
enlarged the impression?"</p>

<p>"There was not a drop of blood on either of her hands when she
was lifted up," replied Monsieur Darzac.</p>

<p>"We are now sure," said I, "that it was Mademoiselle
Stangerson who was armed with Daddy Jacques's revolver, since she
wounded the hand of the murderer. She was in fear, then, of
somebody or something."</p>

<p>"Probably."</p>

<p>"Do you suspect anybody?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Monsieur Darzac, looking at Rouletabille.</p>

<p>Rouletabille then said to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must know, my friend, that the inquiry is a little more
advanced than Monsieur de Marquet has chosen to tell us. He not
only knows that Mademoiselle Stangerson defended herself with the
revolver, but he knows what the weapon was that was used to
attack her. Monsieur Darzac tells me it was a mutton-bone. Why is
Monsieur de Marquet surrounding this mutton-bone with so much
mystery? No doubt for the purpose of facilitating the inquiries
of the agents of the Sûreté? He imagines, perhaps, that the owner
of this instrument of crime, the most terrible invented, is going
to be found amongst those who are well-known in the slums of
Paris who use it. But who can ever say what passes through the
brain of an examining magistrate?" Rouletabille added with
contemptuous irony.</p>

<p>"Has a mutton-bone been found in The Yellow Room?" I asked
him.</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur," said Robert Darzac, "at the foot of the bed;
but I beg of you not to say anything about it." (I made a gesture
of assent.) "It was an enormous mutton-bone, the top of which, or
rather the joint, was still red with the blood of the frightful
wound. It was an old bone, which may, according to appearances,
have served in other crimes. That's what Monsieur de Marquet
thinks who has had it sent to the municipal laboratory at Paris
to be analysed. In fact, he thinks he has detected on it, not
only the blood of the last victim, but other stains of dried
blood, evidences of previous crimes."</p>

<p>"A mutton-bone in the hand of a <i>skilled</i> assassin is a
frightful weapon," said Rouletabille, "a more certain weapon than
a heavy hammer."</p>

<p>"The scoundrel has proved it to be so," said Monsieur Robert
Darzac, sadly. "The joint of the bone found exactly fits the
wound inflicted. My belief is that the wound would have been
mortal, if the murderer's blow had not been arrested in the act
by Mademoiselle Stangerson's revolver. Wounded in the hand, he
dropped the mutton-bone and fled. Unfortunately, the blow had
been already given, and Mademoiselle was stunned after having
been nearly strangled. If she had succeeded in wounding the man
with the first shot of the revolver, she would, doubtless, have
escaped the blow with the bone. But she had certainly employed
her revolver too late; the first shot deviated and lodged in the
ceiling; it was the second only that took effect."</p>

<p>Having said this, Monsieur Darzac knocked at the door of the
pavilion. I must confess to feeling a strong impatience to reach
the spot where the crime had been committed. It was some time
before the door was opened by a man whom I at once recognised as
Daddy Jacques.</p>

<p>He appeared to be well over sixty years of age. He had a long
white beard and white hair, on which he wore a flat Basque cap.
He was dressed in a complete suit of chestnut-coloured velveteen,
worn at the sides; sabots were on his feet. He had rather a
waspish-looking face, the expression of which lightened, however,
as soon as he saw Monsieur Darzac.</p>

<p>"Friends," said our guide. "Nobody in the pavilion, Daddy
Jacques?"</p>

<p>"I ought not to allow anybody to enter, Monsieur Robert, but
of course the order does not apply to you. These gentlemen of
justice have seen everything there is to be seen, and made enough
drawings, and drawn up enough reports&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Monsieur Jacques, one question before anything
else," said Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"What is it, young man? If I can answer it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did your mistress wear her hair in bands, that evening? You
know what I mean&mdash;over her forehead?"</p>

<p>"No, young man. My mistress never wore her hair in the way you
suggest, neither on that day nor on any other. She had her hair
drawn up, as usual, so that her beautiful forehead could be seen,
pure as that of an unborn child!"</p>

<p>Rouletabille grunted and set to work examining the door,
finding that it fastened itself automatically. He satisfied
himself that it could never remain open and needed a key to open
it. Then we entered the vestibule, a small, well-lit room paved
with square red tiles.</p>

<p>"Ah! This is the window by which the murderer escaped!" said
Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"So they keep on saying, monsieur, so they keep on saying! But
if he had gone off that way, we should have been sure to have
seen him. We are not blind, neither Monsieur Stangerson nor me,
nor the concierges who are in prison. Why have they not put me in
prison, too, on account of my revolver?"</p>

<p>Rouletabille had already opened the window and was examining
the shutters.</p>

<p>"Were these closed at the time of the crime?"</p>

<p>"And fastened with the iron catch inside," said Daddy Jacques,
"and I am quite sure that the murderer did not get out that
way."</p>

<p>"Are there any blood stains?"</p>

<p>"Yes, on the stones outside; but blood of what?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Rouletabille, "there are footmarks visible on the
path&mdash;the ground was very moist. I will look into that
presently."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" interrupted Daddy Jacques; "the murderer did not
go that way."</p>

<p>"Which way did he go, then?"</p>

<p>"How do I know?"</p>

<p>Rouletabille looked at everything, smelled everything. He went
down on his knees and rapidly examined every one of the paving
tiles. Daddy Jacques went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;you can't find anything, monsieur. Nothing has been
found. And now it is all dirty; too many persons have tramped
over it. They wouldn't let me wash it, but on the day of the
crime I had washed the floor thoroughly, and if the murderer had
crossed it with his hobnailed boots, I should not have failed to
see where he had been; he has left marks enough in Mademoiselle's
chamber."</p>

<p>Rouletabille rose.</p>

<p>"When was the last time you washed these tiles?" he asked, and
he fixed on Daddy Jacques a most searching look.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;as I told you&mdash;on the day of the crime,
towards half-past five&mdash;while Mademoiselle and her father
were taking a little walk before dinner, here in this room; they
had dined in the laboratory. The next day, the examining
magistrate came and saw all the marks there were on the floor as
plainly as if they had been made with ink on white paper. Well,
neither in the laboratory nor in the vestibule, which were both
as clean as a new pin, were there any traces of a man's
footmarks. Since they have been found near this window outside,
he must have made his way through the ceiling of The Yellow Room
into the attic, then cut his way through the roof and dropped to
the ground outside the vestibule window. But&mdash;there's no
hole, neither in the ceiling of The Yellow Room nor in the roof
of my attic&mdash;that's absolutely certain! So you see we know
nothing&mdash;nothing! And nothing will ever be known! It's a
mystery of the devil's own making."</p>

<p>Rouletabille went down upon his knees again almost in front of
a small lavatory at the back of the vestibule. In that position
he remained for about a minute.</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked him when he got up.</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing very important,&mdash;a drop of blood," he
replied, turning towards Daddy Jacques as he spoke. "While you
were washing the laboratory and this vestibule, was the vestibule
window open?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur, it was closed; but after I had done washing the
floor, I lit some charcoal for Monsieur in the laboratory
furnace, and, as I lit it with old newspapers, it smoked, so I
opened both the windows in the laboratory and this one, to make a
current of air; then I shut those in the laboratory and left this
one open when I went out. When I returned to the pavilion, this
window had been closed and Monsieur and Mademoiselle were already
at work in the laboratory."</p>

<p>"Monsieur or Mademoiselle Stangerson had, no doubt, shut
it?"</p>

<p>"No doubt."</p>

<p>"You did not ask them?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>After a close scrutiny of the little lavatory and of the
staircase leading up to the attic, Rouletabille&mdash;to whom we
seemed no longer to exist&mdash;entered the laboratory. I
followed him. It was, I confess, in a state of great excitement.
Robert Darzac lost none of my friend's movements. As for me, my
eyes were drawn at once to the door of The Yellow Room. It was
closed and, as I immediately saw, partially shattered and out of
commission.</p>

<p>My friend, who went about his work methodically, silently
studied the room in which we were. It was large and well-lighted.
Two big windows&mdash;almost bays&mdash;were protected by strong
iron bars and looked out upon a wide extent of country. Through
an opening in the forest, they commanded a wonderful view through
the length of the valley and across the plain to the large town
which could be clearly seen in fair weather. To-day, however, a
mist hung over the ground&mdash;and blood in that room!</p>

<p>The whole of one side of the laboratory was taken up with a
large chimney, crucibles, ovens, and such implements as are
needed for chemical experiments; tables, loaded with phials,
papers, reports, an electrical machine,&mdash;an apparatus, as
Monsieur Darzac informed me, employed by Professor Stangerson to
demonstrate the Dissociation of Matter under the action of solar
light&mdash;and other scientific implements.</p>

<p>Along the walls were cabinets, plain or glass-fronted, through
which were visible microscopes, special photographic apparatus,
and a large quantity of crystals.</p>

<p>Rouletabille, who was ferreting in the chimney, put his
fingers into one of the crucibles. Suddenly he drew himself up,
and held up a piece of half-consumed paper in his hand. He
stepped up to where we were talking by one of the windows.</p>

<p>"Keep that for us, Monsieur Darzac," he said.</p>

<p>I bent over the piece of scorched paper which Monsieur Darzac
took from the hand of Rouletabille, and read distinctly the only
words that remained legible:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Presbytery&mdash;lost nothing&mdash;charm, nor the
gar&mdash;its brightness."</p>

<p>Twice since the morning these same meaningless words had
struck me, and, for the second time, I saw that they produced on
the Sorbonne professor the same paralysing effect. Monsieur
Darzac's first anxiety showed itself when he turned his eyes in
the direction of Daddy Jacques. But, occupied as he was at
another window, he had seen nothing. Then tremblingly opening his
pocket-book he put the piece of paper into it, sighing: "My
God!"</p>

<p>During this time, Rouletabille had mounted into the opening of
the fire-grate&mdash;that is to say, he had got upon the bricks
of a furnace&mdash;and was attentively examining the chimney,
which grew narrower towards the top, the outlet from it being
closed with sheets of iron, fastened into the brickwork, through
which passed three small chimneys.</p>

<p>"Impossible to get out that way," he said, jumping back into
the laboratory. "Besides, even if he <i>had</i> tried to do it,
he would have brought all that ironwork down to the ground. No,
no; it is not on that side we have to search."</p>

<p>Rouletabille next examined the furniture and opened the doors
of the cabinet. Then he came to the windows, through which he
declared no one could possibly have passed. At the second window
he found Daddy Jacques in contemplation.</p>

<p>"Well, Daddy Jacques," he said, "what are you looking at?"</p>

<p>"That policeman who is always going round and round the lake.
Another of those fellows who think they can see better than
anybody else!"</p>

<p>"You don't know Frédéric Larsan, Daddy Jacques, or you
wouldn't speak of him in that way," said Rouletabille in a
melancholy tone. "If there is anyone who will find the murderer,
it will be he." And Rouletabille heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"Before they find him, they will have to learn how they lost
him," said Daddy Jacques, stolidly.</p>

<p>At length we reached the door of The Yellow Room itself.</p>

<p>"There is the door behind which some terrible scene took
place," said Rouletabille, with a solemnity which, under any
other circumstances, would have been comical.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="chaphead">In Which Rouletabille Sets Out On An
Expedition Under The Bed.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
ROULETABILLE having pushed open the door of The Yellow Room
paused on the threshold saying, with an emotion which I only
later understood, "Ah, the perfume of the lady in black!"</p>

<p>The chamber was dark. Daddy Jacques was about to open the
blinds when Rouletabille stopped him.</p>

<p>"Did not the tragedy take place in complete darkness?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"No, young man, I don't think so. Mademoiselle always had a
night-light on her table, and I lit it every evening before she
went to bed. I was a sort of chambermaid, you must understand,
when the evening came. The real chambermaid did not come here
much before the morning. Mademoiselle worked late&mdash;far into
the night."</p>

<p>"Where did the table with the night-light stand,&mdash;far
from the bed?"</p>

<p>"Some way from the bed."</p>

<p>"Can you light the burner now?"</p>

<p>"The lamp is broken and the oil that was in it was spilled
when the table was upset. All the rest of the things in the room
remain just as they were. I have only to open the blinds for you
to see."</p>

<p>"Wait."</p>

<p>Rouletabille went back into the laboratory, closed the
shutters of the two windows and the door of the vestibule. When
we were in complete darkness, he lit a wax vesta, and asked Daddy
Jacques to move to the middle of the chamber with it to the place
where the night-light was burning that night.</p>

<p>Daddy Jacques who was in his stockings&mdash;he usually left
his sabots in the vestibule&mdash;entered The Yellow Room with
his bit of a vesta. We vaguely distinguished objects overthrown
on the floor, a bed in one corner, and, in front of us, to the
left, the gleam of a looking-glass hanging on the wall, near to
the bed.</p>

<p>"That will do!&mdash;you may now open the blinds," said
Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"Don't come any further," Daddy Jacques begged, "you may make
marks with your boots, and nothing must be deranged; it's an idea
of the magistrate's&mdash;though he has nothing more to do
here."</p>

<p>And he pushed open the shutter. The pale daylight entered from
without, throwing a sinister light on the saffron-coloured walls.
The floor&mdash;for though the laboratory and the vestibule were
tiled, The Yellow Room had a flooring of wood&mdash;was covered
with a single yellow mat which was large enough to cover nearly
the whole room, under the bed and under the
dressing-table&mdash;the only piece of furniture that remained
upright. The centre round table, the night-table and two chairs
had been overturned. These did not prevent a large stain of blood
being visible on the mat, made, as Daddy Jacques informed us, by
the blood which had flowed from the wound on Mademoiselle
Stangerson's forehead. Besides these stains, drops of blood had
fallen in all directions, in line with the visible traces of the
footsteps&mdash;large and black&mdash;of the murderer. Everything
led to the presumption that these drops of blood had fallen from
the wound of the man who had, for a moment, placed his red hand
on the wall. There were other traces of the same hand on the
wall, but much less distinct.</p>

<p>"See!&mdash;see this blood on the wall!" I could not help
exclaiming. "The man who pressed his hand so heavily upon it in
the darkness must certainly have thought that he was pushing at a
door! That's why he pressed on it so hard, leaving on the yellow
paper the terrible evidence. I don't think there are many hands
in the world of that sort. It is big and strong and the fingers
are nearly all one as long as the other! The thumb is wanting and
we have only the mark of the palm; but if we follow the trace of
the hand," I continued, "we see that, after leaving its imprint
on the wall, the <i>touch</i> sought the door, found it, and then
felt for the lock&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No doubt," interrupted Rouletabille, chuckling,&mdash;"only
there is no blood, either on the lock or on the bolt!"</p>

<p>"What does that prove?" I rejoined with a good sense of which
I was proud; "he might have opened the lock with his left hand,
which would have been quite natural, his right hand being
wounded."</p>

<p>"He didn't open it at all!" Daddy Jacques again exclaimed. "We
are not fools; and there were four of us when we burst open the
door!"</p>

<p>"What a queer hand!&mdash;Look what a queer hand it is!" I
said.</p>

<p>"It is a very natural hand," said Rouletabille, "of which the
shape has been deformed by its having slipped on the wall. The
man dried his hand on the wall. He must be a man about five feet
eight in height."</p>

<p>"How do you come at that?"</p>

<p>"By the height of the marks on the wall."</p>

<p>My friend next occupied himself with the mark of the bullet in
the wall. It was a round hole.</p>

<p>"This ball was fired straight, not from above, and
consequently, not from below."</p>

<p>Rouletabille went back to the door and carefully examined the
lock and the bolt, satisfying himself that the door had certainly
been burst open from the outside, and, further, that the key had
been found in the lock on the inside of the chamber. He finally
satisfied himself that with the key in the lock, the door could
not possibly be opened from without with another key. Having made
sure of all these details, he let fall these words: "That's
better!"&mdash;Then sitting down on the ground, he hastily took
off his boots and, in his socks, went into the room.</p>

<p>The first thing he did was to examine minutely the overturned
furniture. We watched him in silence.</p>

<p>"Young fellow, you are giving yourself a great deal of
trouble," said Daddy Jacques ironically.</p>

<p>Rouletabille raised his head and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have spoken the simple truth, Daddy Jacques; your
mistress did not have her hair in bands that evening. I was a
donkey to have believed she did."</p>

<p>Then, with the suppleness of a serpent, he slipped under the
bed. Presently we heard him ask:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At what time, Monsieur Jacques, did Monsieur and Mademoiselle
Stangerson arrive at the laboratory?"</p>

<p>"At six o'clock."</p>

<p>The voice of Rouletabille continued:</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;he's been under here,&mdash;that's certain; in
fact, there was no where else where he could have hidden himself.
Here, too, are the marks of his hobnails. When you
entered&mdash;all four of you&mdash;did you look under the
bed?"</p>

<p>"At once,&mdash;we drew it right out of its place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And between the mattresses?"</p>

<p>"There was only one on the bed, and on that Mademoiselle was
placed; and Monsieur Stangerson and the concierge immediately
carried it into the laboratory. Under the mattress there was
nothing but the metal netting, which could not conceal anything
or anybody. Remember, monsieur, that there were four of us and we
couldn't fail to see everything&mdash;the chamber is so small and
scantily furnished, and all was locked behind in the
pavilion."</p>

<p>I ventured on a hypothesis:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps he got away with the mattress&mdash;in the
mattress!&mdash;Anything is possible, in the face of such a
mystery! In their distress of mind Monsieur Stangerson and the
concierge may not have noticed they were bearing a double weight;
especially if the concierge were an accomplice! I throw out this
hypothesis for what it is worth, but it explains many
things,&mdash;and particularly the fact that neither the
laboratory nor the vestibule bear any traces of the footmarks
found in the room. If, in carrying Mademoiselle on the mattress
from the laboratory of the château, they rested for a moment,
there might have been an opportunity for the man in it to
escape."</p>

<p>"And then?" asked Rouletabille, deliberately laughing under
the bed.</p>

<p>I felt rather vexed and replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't know,&mdash;but anything appears possible"&mdash;</p>

<p>"The examining magistrate had the same idea, monsieur," said
Daddy Jacques, "and he carefully examined the mattress. He was
obliged to laugh at the idea, monsieur, as your friend is doing
now,&mdash;for whoever heard of a mattress having a double
bottom?"</p>

<p>I was myself obliged to laugh, on seeing that what I had said
was absurd; but in an affair like this one hardly knows where an
absurdity begins or ends.</p>

<p>My friend alone seemed able to talk intelligently. He called
out from under the bed.</p>

<p>"The mat here has been moved out of place,&mdash;who did
it?"</p>

<p>"We did, monsieur," explained Daddy Jacques. "When we could
not find the assassin, we asked ourselves whether there was not
some hole in the floor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is not," replied Rouletabille. "Is there a cellar?"</p>

<p>"No, there's no cellar. But that has not stopped our
searching, and has not prevented the examining magistrate and his
Registrar from studying the floor plank by plank, as if there had
been a cellar under it."</p>

<p>The reporter then reappeared. His eyes were sparkling and his
nostrils quivered. He remained on his hands and knees. He could
not be better likened than to an admirable sporting dog on the
scent of some unusual game. And, indeed, he was scenting the
steps of a man,&mdash;the man whom he has sworn to report to his
master, the manager of the "Epoque." It must not be forgotten
that Rouletabille was first and last a journalist.</p>

<p>Thus, on his hands and knees, he made his way to the four
corners of the room, so to speak, sniffing and going round
everything&mdash;everything that we could see, which was not
much, and everything that we could not see, which must have been
infinite.</p>

<p>The toilette table was a simple table standing on four legs;
there was nothing about it by which it could possibly be changed
into a temporary hiding-place. There was not a closet or
cupboard. Mademoiselle Stangerson kept her wardrobe at the
château.</p>

<p>Rouletabille literally passed his nose and hands along the
walls, constructed of solid brickwork. When he had finished with
the walls, and passed his agile fingers over every portion of the
yellow paper covering them, he reached to the ceiling, which he
was able to touch by mounting on a chair placed on the toilette
table, and by moving this ingeniously constructed stage from
place to place he examined every foot of it. When he had finished
his scrutiny of the ceiling, where he carefully examined the hole
made by the second bullet, he approached the window, and, once
more, examined the iron bars and blinds, all of which were solid
and intact. At last, he gave a grunt of satisfaction and declared
"Now I am at ease!"</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;do you believe that the poor dear young lady was
shut up when she was being murdered&mdash;when she cried out for
help?" wailed Daddy Jacques.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the young reporter, drying his forehead, "The
Yellow Room was as tightly shut as an iron safe."</p>

<p>"That," I said, "is why this mystery is the most surprising I
know. Edgar Allan Poe, in the 'Double Assassination of the Rue
Morgue,' invented nothing like it. The place of that crime was
sufficiently closed to prevent the escape of a man; but there was
that window through which the monkey, the perpetrator of the
murder, could slip away! But here, there can be no question of an
opening of any sort. The door was fastened, and through the
window blinds, secure as they were, not even a fly could enter or
get out."</p>

<p>"True, true," assented Rouletabille as he kept on drying his
forehead, which seemed to be perspiring less from his recent
bodily exertion than from his mental agitation. "Indeed, it's a
great, a beautiful, and a very curious mystery."</p>

<p>"The <i>Bête du bon Dieu</i>," muttered Daddy Jacques, "the
<i>Bête du bon Dieu</i> herself, if she had committed the crime,
could not have escaped. Listen! Do you hear it? Hush!"</p>

<p>Daddy Jacques made us a sign to keep quiet and, stretching his
arm towards the wall nearest the forest, listened to something
which we could not hear.</p>

<p>"It's answering," he said at length. "I must kill it. It is
too wicked, but it's the <i>Bête du bon Dieu</i>, and, every
night, it goes to pray on the tomb of Sainte-Geneviève and nobody
dares to touch her, for fear that Mother Angenoux should cast an
evil spell on them."</p>

<p>"How big is the <i>Bête du bon Dieu?</i>"</p>

<p>"Nearly as big as a small retriever,&mdash;a monster, I tell
you. Ah!&mdash;I have asked myself more than once whether it was
not her that took our poor Mademoiselle by the throat with her
claws. But the <i>Bête du bon Dieu</i> does not wear hobnailed
boots, nor fire revolvers, nor has she a hand like <i>that!</i>"
exclaimed Daddy Jacques, again pointing out to us the red mark on
the wall. "Besides, we should have seen her as well as we would
have seen a man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Evidently," I said. "Before we had seen this Yellow Room, I
had also asked myself whether the cat of Mother
Angenoux&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You also!" cried Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"Didn't you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not for a moment. After reading the article in the 'Matin,' I
knew that a cat had nothing to do with the matter. But I swear
now that a frightful tragedy has been enacted here. You say
nothing about the Basque cap, or the handkerchief, found here,
Daddy Jacques?"</p>

<p>"Of course, the magistrate has taken them," the old man
answered, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen either the handkerchief or the cap, yet I can
tell you how they are made," the reporter said to him
gravely.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are very clever," said Daddy Jacques, coughing and
embarrassed.</p>

<p>"The handkerchief is a large one, blue with red stripes and
the cap is an old Basque cap, like the one you are wearing
now."</p>

<p>"You are a wizard!" said Daddy Jacques, trying to laugh and
not quite succeeding. "How do you know that the handkerchief is
blue with red stripes?"</p>

<p>"Because, if it had not been blue with red stripes, it would
not have been found at all."</p>

<p>Without giving any further attention to Daddy Jacques, my
friend took a piece of paper from his pocket, and taking out a
pair of scissors, bent over the footprints. Placing the paper
over one of them he began to cut. In a short time he had made a
perfect pattern which he handed to me, begging me not to lose
it.</p>

<p>He then returned to the window and, pointing to the figure of
Frédéric Larsan, who had not quitted the side of the lake, asked
Daddy Jacques whether the detective had, like himself, been
working in The Yellow Room?</p>

<p>"No," replied Robert Darzac, who, since Rouletabille had
handed him the piece of scorched paper, had not uttered a word,
"He pretends that he does not need to examine The Yellow Room. He
says that the murderer made his escape from it in quite a natural
way, and that he will, this evening, explain how he did it."</p>

<p>As he listened to what Monsieur Darzac had to say,
Rouletabille turned pale.</p>

<p>"Has Frédéric Larsan found out the truth, which I can only
guess at?" he murmured. "He is very clever&mdash;very
clever&mdash;and I admire him. But what we have to do to-day is
something more than the work of a policeman,&mdash;something
quite different from the teachings of experience. We have to take
hold of our reason by the right end."</p>

<p>The reporter rushed into the open air, agitated by the thought
that the great and famous Fred might anticipate him in the
solution of the problem of The Yellow Room.</p>

<p>I managed to reach him on the threshold of the pavilion.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, my dear fellow," I said. "Aren't you
satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he confessed to me, with a deep sigh. "I am quite
satisfied. I have discovered many things."</p>

<p>"Moral or material?"</p>

<p>"Several moral,&mdash;one material. This, for example."</p>

<p>And rapidly he drew from his waistcoat pocket a piece of paper
in which he had placed a <i>light-coloured hair from a woman's
head</i>.</p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="chaphead">The Examining Magistrate Questions
Mademoiselle Stangerson.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
TWO minutes later, as Rouletabille was bending over the
footprints discovered in the park, under the window of the
vestibule, a man, evidently a servant at the château, came
towards us rapidly and called out to Monsieur Darzac then coming
out of the pavilion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Monsieur Robert, the magistrate, you know, is questioning
Mademoiselle."</p>

<p>Monsieur Darzac uttered a muttered excuse to us and set off
running towards the château, the man running after him.</p>

<p>"If the corpse can speak," I said, "it would be interesting to
be there."</p>

<p>"We must know," said my friend. "Let's go to the château." And
he drew me with him. But, at the château, a gendarme placed in
the vestibule denied us admission up the staircase of the first
floor. We were obliged to wait down stairs.</p>

<p>This is what passed in the chamber of the victim while we were
waiting below.</p>

<p>The family doctor, finding that Mademoiselle Stangerson was
much better, but fearing a relapse which would no longer permit
of her being questioned, had thought it his duty to inform the
examining magistrate of this, who decided to proceed immediately
with a brief examination. At this examination, the Registrar,
Monsieur Stangerson, and the doctor were present. Later, I
obtained the text of the report of the examination, and I give it
here, in all its legal dryness:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Question. Are you able, mademoiselle, without too much
fatiguing yourself, to give some necessary details of the
frightful attack of which you have been the victim?</p>

<p>"Answer. I feel much better, monsieur, and I will tell you all
I know. When I entered my chamber I did not notice anything
unusual there.</p>

<p>"Q. Excuse me, mademoiselle,&mdash;if you will allow me, I
will ask you some questions and you will answer them. That will
fatigue you less than making a long recital.</p>

<p>"A. Do so, monsieur.</p>

<p>"Q. What did you do on that day?&mdash;I want you to be as
minute and precise as possible. I wish to know all you did that
day, if it is not asking too much of you.</p>

<p>"A. I rose late, at ten o'clock, for my father and I had
returned home late on the night previously, having been to dinner
at the reception given by the President of the Republic, in
honour of the Academy of Science of Philadelphia. When I left my
chamber, at half-past ten, my father was already at work in the
laboratory. We worked together till midday. We then took
half-an-hour's walk in the park, as we were accustomed to do,
before breakfasting at the château. After breakfast, we took
another walk for half an hour, and then returned to the
laboratory. There we found my chambermaid, who had come to set my
room in order. I went into The Yellow Room to give her some
slight orders and she directly afterwards left the pavilion, and
I resumed my work with my father. At five o'clock, we again went
for a walk in the park and afterward had tea.</p>

<p>"Q. Before leaving the pavilion at five o'clock, did you go
into your chamber?</p>

<p>"A. No, monsieur, my father went into it, at my request to
bring me my hat.</p>

<p>"Q. And he found nothing suspicious there?</p>

<p>"A. Evidently no, monsieur.</p>

<p>"Q. It is, then, almost certain that the murderer was not yet
concealed under the bed. When you went out, was the door of the
room locked?</p>

<p>"A. No, there was no reason for locking it.</p>

<p>"Q. You were absent from the pavilion some length of time,
Monsieur Stangerson and you?</p>

<p>"A. About an hour.</p>

<p>"Q. It was during that hour, no doubt, that the murderer got
into the pavilion. But how? Nobody knows. Footmarks have been
found in the park, leading away from the window of the vestibule,
but none has been found going towards it. Did you notice whether
the vestibule window was open when you went out?</p>

<p>"A. I don't remember.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Stangerson. It was closed.</p>

<p>"Q. And when you returned?</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Stangerson. I did not notice.</p>

<p>"M. Stangerson. It was still closed. I remember remarking
aloud: 'Daddy Jacques must surely have opened it while we were
away.'</p>

<p>"Q. Strange!&mdash;Do you recollect, Monsieur Stangerson, if
during your absence, and before going out, he had opened it? You
returned to the laboratory at six o'clock and resumed work?</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Stangerson. Yes, monsieur.</p>

<p>"Q. And you did not leave the laboratory from that hour up to
the moment when you entered your chamber?</p>

<p>"M. Stangerson. Neither my daughter nor I, monsieur. We were
engaged on work that was pressing, and we lost not a
moment,&mdash;neglecting everything else on that account.</p>

<p>"Q. Did you dine in the laboratory?</p>

<p>"A. For that reason.</p>

<p>"Q. Are you accustomed to dine in the laboratory?</p>

<p>"A. We rarely dine there.</p>

<p>"Q. Could the murderer have known that you would dine there
that evening?</p>

<p>"M. Stangerson. Good Heavens!&mdash;I think not. It was only
when we returned to the pavilion at six o'clock, that we decided,
my daughter and I, to dine there. At that moment I was spoken to
by my gamekeeper, who detained me a moment, to ask me to
accompany him on an urgent tour of inspection in a part of the
woods which I had decided to thin. I put this off until the next
day, and begged him, as he was going by the château, to tell the
steward that we should dine in the laboratory. He left me, to
execute the errand and I rejoined my daughter, who was already at
work.</p>

<p>"Q. At what hour, mademoiselle, did you go to your chamber
while your father continued to work there?</p>

<p>"A. At midnight.</p>

<p>"Q. Did Daddy Jacques enter The Yellow Room in the course of
the evening?</p>

<p>"A. To shut the blinds and light the night-light.</p>

<p>"Q. He saw nothing suspicious?</p>

<p>"A. He would have told us if he had seen. Daddy Jacques is an
honest man and very attached to me.</p>

<p>"Q. You affirm, Monsieur Stangerson, that Daddy Jacques
remained with you all the time you were in the laboratory?</p>

<p>"M. Stangerson. I am sure of it. I have no doubt of that.</p>

<p>"Q. When you entered your chamber, mademoiselle, you
immediately shut the door and locked and bolted it? That was
taking unusual precautions, knowing that your father and your
servant were there? Were you in fear of something, then?</p>

<p>"A. My father would be returning to the château and Daddy
Jacques would be going to his bed. And, in fact, I <i>did</i>
fear something.</p>

<p>"Q. You were so much in fear of something that you borrowed
Daddy Jacques's revolver without telling him you had done so?</p>

<p>"A. That is true. I did not wish to alarm anybody,&mdash;the
more, because my fears might have proved to have been
foolish.</p>

<p>"Q. What was it you feared?</p>

<p>"A. I hardly know how to tell you. For several nights, I
seemed to hear, both in the park and out of the park, round the
pavilion, unusual sounds, sometimes footsteps, at other times the
cracking of branches. The night before the attack on me, when I
did not get to bed before three o'clock in the morning, on our
return from the Élysée, I stood for a moment before my window,
and I felt sure I saw shadows.</p>

<p>"Q. How many?</p>

<p>"A. Two. They moved round the lake,&mdash;then the moon became
clouded and I lost sight of them. At this time of the season,
every year, I have generally returned to my apartment in the
château for the winter; but this year I said to myself that I
would not quit the pavilion before my father had finished the
résumé of his works on the 'Dissociation of Matter' for the
Academy. I did not wish that that important work, which was to
have been finished in the course of a few days, should be delayed
by a change in our daily habit. You can well understand that I
did not wish to speak of my childish fears to my father, nor did
I say anything to Daddy Jacques who, I knew, would not have been
able to hold his tongue. Knowing that he had a revolver in his
room, I took advantage of his absence and borrowed it, placing it
in the drawer of my night-table.</p>

<p>"Q. You know of no enemies you have?</p>

<p>"A. None.</p>

<p>"Q. You understand, mademoiselle, that these precautions are
calculated to cause surprise?</p>

<p>"M. Stangerson. Evidently, my child, such precautions are very
surprising.</p>

<p>"A. No;&mdash;because I have told you that I had been uneasy
for two nights.</p>

<p>"M. Stangerson. You ought to have told me of that! This
misfortune would have been avoided.</p>

<p>"Q. The door of The Yellow Room locked, did you go to bed?</p>

<p>"A. Yes, and, being very tired, I at once went to sleep.</p>

<p>"Q. The night-light was still burning?</p>

<p>"A. Yes, but it gave a very feeble light.</p>

<p>"Q. Then, mademoiselle, tell us what happened.</p>

<p>"A. I do not know whether I had been long asleep, but suddenly
I awoke&mdash;and uttered a loud cry.</p>

<p>"M. Stangerson. Yes&mdash;a horrible
cry&mdash;'Murder!'&mdash;It still rings in my ears.</p>

<p>"Q. You uttered a loud cry?</p>

<p>"A. A man was in my chamber. He sprang at me and tried to
strangle me. I was nearly stifled when suddenly I was able to
reach the drawer of my night-table and grasp the revolver which I
had placed in it. At that moment the man had forced me to the
foot of my bed and brandished over my head a sort of mace. But I
had fired. He immediately struck a terrible blow at my head. All
that, monsieur, passed more rapidly than I can tell it, and I
know nothing more.</p>

<p>"Q. Nothing?&mdash;Have you no idea as to how the assassin
could escape from your chamber?</p>

<p>"A. None whatever&mdash;I know nothing more. One does not know
what is passing around one, when one is unconscious.</p>

<p>"Q. Was the man you saw tall or short, little or big?</p>

<p>"A. I only saw a shadow which appeared to me formidable.</p>

<p>"Q. You cannot give us any indication?</p>

<p>"A. I know nothing more, monsieur, than that a man threw
himself upon me and that I fired at him. I know nothing
more."</p>

<p>Here the interrogation of Mademoiselle Stangerson
concluded.</p>

<p><br>
ROULETABILLE waited patiently for Monsieur Robert Darzac, who
soon appeared.</p>

<p>From a room near the chamber of Mademoiselle Stangerson, he
had heard the interrogatory and now came to recount it to my
friend with great exactitude, aided by an excellent memory. His
docility still surprised me. Thanks to hasty pencil-notes, he was
able to reproduce, almost textually, the questions and the
answers given.</p>

<p>It looked as if Monsieur Darzac were being employed as the
secretary of my young friend and acted as if he could refuse him
nothing; nay, more, as if under a compulsion to do so.</p>

<p>The fact of the closed window struck the reporter as it had
struck the magistrate. Rouletabille asked Darzac to repeat once
more Mademoiselle Stangerson's account of how she and her father
had spent their time on the day of the tragedy, as she had stated
it to the magistrate. The circumstance of the dinner in the
laboratory seemed to interest him in the highest degree; and he
had it repeated to him three times. He also wanted to be sure
that the forest-keeper knew that the professor and his daughter
were going to dine in the laboratory, and how he had come to know
it.</p>

<p>When Monsieur Darzac had finished, I said: "The examination
has not advanced the problem much."</p>

<p>"It has put it back," said Monsieur Darzac.</p>

<p>"It has thrown light upon it," said Rouletabille,
thoughtfully.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>Reporter And Detective.</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
THE three of us went back towards the pavilion. At some
distance from the building the reporter made us stop and,
pointing to a small clump of trees to the right of us,
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's where the murderer came from to get into the
pavilion."</p>

<p>As there were other patches of trees of the same sort between
the great oaks, I asked why the murderer had chosen that one,
rather than any of the others. Rouletabille answered me by
pointing to the path which ran quite close to the thicket to the
door of the pavilion.</p>

<p>"That path is, as you see, topped with gravel," he said; "the
man <i>must</i> have passed along it going to the pavilion, since
no traces of his steps have been found on the soft ground. The
man didn't have wings; he walked; but he walked on the gravel
which left no impression of his tread. The gravel has, in fact,
been trodden by many other feet, since the path is the most
direct way between the pavilion and the château. As to the
thicket, made of the sort of shrubs that don't flourish in the
rough season&mdash;laurels and fuchsias&mdash;it offered the
murderer a sufficient hiding-place until it was time for him to
make his way to the pavilion. It was while hiding in that clump
of trees that he saw Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson, and
then Daddy Jacques, leave the pavilion. Gravel has been spread
nearly, very nearly, up to the windows of the pavilion. The
footprints of a man, parallel with the wall&mdash;marks which we
will examine presently, and which I have already seen&mdash;prove
that he only needed to make one stride to find himself in front
of the vestibule window, left open by Daddy Jacques. The man drew
himself up by his hands and entered the vestibule."</p>

<p>"After all it is very possible," I said.</p>

<p>"After all what? After all what?" cried Rouletabille.</p>

<p>I begged of him not to be angry; but he was too much irritated
to listen to me and declared, ironically, that he admired the
prudent doubt with which certain people approached the most
simple problems, risking nothing by saying "that is so," or "that
is not so." Their intelligence would have produced about the same
result if nature had forgotten to furnish their brain-pan with a
little grey matter. As I appeared vexed, my young friend took me
by the arm and admitted that he had not meant that for me; he
thought more of me than that.</p>

<p>"If I did not reason as I do in regard to this gravel," he
went on, "I should have to assume a balloon!&mdash;My dear
fellow, the science of the aerostation of dirigible balloons is
not yet developed enough for me to consider it and suppose that a
murderer would drop from the clouds! So don't say a thing is
possible, when it could not be otherwise. We know now how the man
entered by the window, and we also know the moment at which he
entered,&mdash;during the five o'clock walk of the professor and
his daughter. The fact of the presence of the
chambermaid&mdash;who had come to clean up The Yellow
Room&mdash;in the laboratory, when Monsieur Stangerson and his
daughter returned from their walk, at half-past one, permits us
to affirm that at half-past one the murderer was not in the
chamber under the bed, unless he was in collusion with the
chambermaid. What do you say, Monsieur Darzac?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Darzac shook his head and said he was sure of the
chambermaid's fidelity, and that she was a thoroughly honest and
devoted servant.</p>

<p>"Besides," he added, "at five o'clock Monsieur Stangerson went
into the room to fetch his daughter's hat."</p>

<p>"There is that also," said Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"That the man entered by the window at the time you say, I
admit," I said; "but why did he shut the window? It was an act
which would necessarily draw the attention of those who had left
it open."</p>

<p>"It may be the window was not shut at once," replied the young
reporter. "<i>But if he did shut the window, it was because of
the bend in the gravel path, a dozen yards from the pavilion, and
on account of the three oaks that are growing at that
spot.</i>"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" asked Monsieur Darzac, who had
followed us and listened with almost breathless attention to all
that Rouletabille had said.</p>

<p>"I'll explain all to you later on, Monsieur, when I think the
moment to be ripe for doing so; but I don't think I have anything
of more importance to say on this affair, if my hypothesis is
justified."</p>

<p>"And what is your hypothesis?"</p>

<p>"You will never know if it does not turn out to be the truth.
It is of much too grave a nature to speak of it, so long as it
continues to be only a hypothesis."</p>

<p>"Have you, at least, some idea as to who the murderer is?"</p>

<p>"No, monsieur, I don't know who the murderer is; but don't be
afraid, Monsieur Robert Darzac&mdash;I shall know."</p>

<p>I could not but observe that Monsieur Darzac was deeply moved;
and I suspected that Rouletabille's confident assertion was not
pleasing to him. Why, I asked myself, if he was really afraid
that the murderer should be discovered, was he helping the
reporter to find him? My young friend seemed to have received the
same impression, for he said, bluntly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Monsieur Darzac don't you want me to find out who the
murderer was?"</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;I should like to kill him with my own hand!" cried
Mademoiselle Stangerson's fiancé, with a vehemence that amazed
me.</p>

<p>"I believe you," said Rouletabille gravely; "but you have not
answered my question."</p>

<p>We were passing by the thicket, of which the young reporter
had spoken to us a minute before. I entered it and pointed out
evident traces of a man who had been hidden there. Rouletabille,
once more, was right.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" he said. "We have to do with a thing of flesh and
blood, who uses the same means that we do. It'll all come out on
those lines."</p>

<p>Having said this, he asked me for the paper pattern of the
footprint which he had given me to take care of, and applied it
to a very clear footmark behind the thicket. "Aha!" he said,
rising.</p>

<p>I thought he was now going to trace back the track of the
murderer's footmarks to the vestibule window; but he led us
instead, far to the left, saying that it was useless ferreting in
the mud, and that he was sure, now, of the road taken by the
murderer.</p>

<p>"He went along the wall to the hedge and dry ditch, over which
he jumped. See, just in front of the little path leading to the
lake, that was his nearest way to get out."</p>

<p>"How do you know he went to the lake?"</p>

<p>"Because Frédéric Larsan has not quitted the borders of it
since this morning. There must be some important marks
there."</p>

<p>A few minutes later we reached the lake.</p>

<p>It was a little sheet of marshy water, surrounded by reeds, on
which floated some dead water-lily leaves. The great Fred may
have seen us approaching, but we probably interested him very
little, for he took hardly any notice of us and continued to be
stirring with his cane something which we could not see.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Rouletabille, "here again are the footmarks of
the escaping man; they skirt the lake here and finally disappear
just before this path, which leads to the high road to Epinay.
The man continued his flight to Paris."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?" I asked, "since these footmarks
are not continued on the path?"</p>

<p>"What makes me think that?&mdash;Why these <i>footprints</i>,
which I expected to find!" he cried, pointing to the sharply
outlined imprint of a neat boot. "See!"&mdash;and he called to
Frédéric Larsan.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Fred, these neat footprints seem to have been made
since the discovery of the crime."</p>

<p>"Yes, young man, yes, they have been carefully made," replied
Fred without raising his head. "You see, there are steps that
come, and steps that go back."</p>

<p>"And the man had a bicycle!" cried the reporter.</p>

<p>Here, after looking at the marks of the bicycle, which
followed, going and coming, the neat footprints, I thought I
might intervene.</p>

<p>"The bicycle explains the disappearance of the murderer's big
footprints," I said. "The murderer, with his rough boots, mounted
a bicycle. His accomplice, the wearer of the neat boots, had come
to wait for him on the edge of the lake with the bicycle. It
might be supposed that the murderer was working for the
other."</p>

<p>"No, no!" replied Rouletabille with a strange smile. "I have
expected to find these footmarks from the very beginning. These
are not the footmarks of the murderer!"</p>

<p>"Then there were two?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;there was but one, and he had no accomplice."</p>

<p>"Very good!&mdash;Very good!" cried Frédéric Larsan.</p>

<p>"Look!" continued the young reporter, showing us the ground
where it had been disturbed by big and heavy heels; "the man
seated himself there, and took off his hobnailed boots, which he
had worn only for the purpose of misleading detection, and then
no doubt, taking them away with him, he stood up in his own
boots, and quietly and slowly regained the high road, holding his
bicycle in his hand, for he could not venture to ride it on this
rough path. That accounts for the lightness of the impression
made by the wheels along it, in spite of the softness of the
ground. If there had been a man on the bicycle, the wheels would
have sunk deeply into the soil. No, no; there was but one man
there, the murderer on foot."</p>

<p>"Bravo!&mdash;bravo!" cried Fred again, and coming suddenly
towards us and, planting himself in front of Monsieur Robert
Darzac, he said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If we had a bicycle here, we might demonstrate the
correctness of the young man's reasoning, Monsieur Robert Darzac.
Do you know whether there is one at the château?"</p>

<p>"No!" replied Monsieur Darzac. "There is not. I took mine,
four days ago, to Paris, the last time I came to the château
before the crime."</p>

<p>"That's a pity!" replied Fred, very coldly. Then, turning to
Rouletabille, he said: "If we go on at this rate, we'll both come
to the same conclusion. Have you any idea, as to how the murderer
got away from The Yellow Room?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said my young friend; "I have an idea."</p>

<p>"So have I," said Fred, "and it must be the same as yours.
There are no two ways of reasoning in this affair. I am waiting
for the arrival of my chief before offering any explanation to
the examining magistrate."</p>

<p>"Ah! Is the Chief of the Sûreté coming?"</p>

<p>"Yes, this afternoon. He is going to summon, before the
magistrate, in the laboratory, all those who have played any part
in this tragedy. It will be very interesting. It is a pity you
won't be able to be present."</p>

<p>"I shall be present," said Rouletabille confidently.</p>

<p>"Really&mdash;you are an extraordinary fellow&mdash;for your
age!" replied the detective in a tone not wholly free from irony.
"You'd make a wonderful detective&mdash;if you had a little more
method&mdash;if you didn't follow your instincts and that bump on
your forehead. As I have already several times observed, Monsieur
Rouletabille, you reason too much; you do not allow yourself to
be guided by what you have seen. What do you say to the
handkerchief full of blood, and the red mark of the hand on the
wall? You have seen the stain on the wall, but I have only seen
the handkerchief."</p>

<p>"Bah!" cried Rouletabille, "the murderer was wounded in the
hand by Mademoiselle Stangerson's revolver!"</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;a simply instinctive observation! Take
care!&mdash;You are becoming too strictly logical, Monsieur
Rouletabille; logic will upset you if you use it
indiscriminatively. You are right, when you say that Mademoiselle
Stangerson fired her revolver, but you are wrong when you say
that she wounded the murderer in the hand."</p>

<p>"I am sure of it," cried Rouletabille.</p>

<p>Fred, imperturbable, interrupted him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Defective observation&mdash;defective observation!&mdash;the
examination of the handkerchief, the numberless little round
scarlet stains, the impression of drops which I found in the
tracks of the footprints, at the moment when they were made on
the floor, prove to me that the murderer was not wounded at all.
Monsieur Rouletabille, the murderer bled at the nose!"</p>

<p>The great Fred spoke quite seriously. However, I could not
refrain from uttering an exclamation.</p>

<p>The reporter looked gravely at Fred, who looked gravely at
him. And Fred immediately concluded:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The man allowed the blood to flow into his hand and
handkerchief, and dried his hand on the wall. The fact is highly
important," he added, "because there is no need of his being
wounded in the hand for him to be the murderer."</p>

<p>Rouletabille seemed to be thinking deeply. After a moment he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is something&mdash;a something, Monsieur Frédéric
Larsan, much graver than the misuse of logic&mdash;the
disposition of mind in some detectives which makes them, in
perfect good faith, twist logic to the necessities of their
preconceived ideas. You, already, have your idea about the
murderer, Monsieur Fred. Don't deny it; and your theory demands
that the murderer should <i>not</i> have been wounded in the
hand, otherwise it comes to nothing. And you have searched, and
have found something else. It's dangerous, very dangerous,
Monsieur Fred, to go from a preconceived idea to find the proofs
to fit it. That method may lead you far astray. Beware of
judicial error, Monsieur Fred, it will trip you up!"</p>

<p>And laughing a little, in a slightly bantering tone, his hands
in his pockets, Rouletabille fixed his cunning eyes on the great
Fred.</p>

<p>Frédéric Larsan silently contemplated the young reporter who
pretended to be as wise as himself. Shrugging his shoulders, he
bowed to us and moved quickly away, hitting the stones on his
path with his stout cane.</p>

<p>Rouletabille watched his retreat, and then turned toward us,
his face joyous and triumphant.</p>

<p>"I shall beat him!" he cried. "I shall beat the great Fred,
clever as he is; I shall beat them all!"</p>

<p>And he danced a double shuffle. Suddenly he stopped. My eyes
followed his gaze; they were fixed on Monsieur Robert Darzac, who
was looking anxiously at the impression left by his feet side by
side with the elegant footmarks. There was not a particle of
difference between them!</p>

<p>We thought he was about to faint. His eyes, bulging with
terror, avoided us, while his right hand, with a spasmodic
movement, twitched at the beard that covered his honest, gentle,
and now despairing face. At length regaining his self-possession,
he bowed to us, and remarking, in a changed voice, that he was
obliged to return to the château, left us.</p>

<p>"The deuce!" exclaimed Rouletabille.</p>

<p>He, also, appeared to be deeply concerned. From his
pocket-book he took a piece of white paper as I had seen him do
before, and with his scissors, cut out the shape of the neat
bootmarks that were on the ground. Then he fitted the new paper
pattern with the one he had previously made&mdash;the two were
exactly alike. Rising, Rouletabille exclaimed again: "The deuce!"
Presently he added: "Yet I believe Monsieur Robert Darzac to be
an honest man." He then led me on the road to the Donjon Inn,
which we could see on the highway, by the side of a small clump
of trees.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>"We Shall Have To Eat Red Meat&mdash;Now!"</h3>
<hr>

<p class="first">
THE Donjon Inn was of no imposing appearance; but I like these
buildings with their rafters blackened with age and the smoke of
their hearths&mdash;these inns of the coaching-days, crumbling
erections that will soon exist in the memory only. They belong to
the bygone days, they are linked with history. They make us think
of the <i>Road</i>, of those days when highwaymen rode.</p>

<p>I saw at once that the Donjon Inn was at least two centuries
old&mdash;perhaps older. Under its sign-board, over the
threshold, a man with a crabbed-looking face was standing,
seemingly plunged in unpleasant thought, if the wrinkles on his
forehead and the knitting of his brows were any indication.</p>

<p>When we were close to him, he deigned to see us and asked us,
in a tone anything but engaging, whether we wanted anything. He
was, no doubt, the not very amiable landlord of this charming
dwelling-place. As we expressed a hope that he would be good
enough to furnish us with a breakfast, he assured us that he had
no provisions, regarding us, as he said this, with a look that
was unmistakably suspicious.</p>

<p>"You may take <i>us</i> in," Rouletabille said to him, "we are
not policemen."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of the police&mdash;I'm not afraid of anyone!"
replied the man.</p>

<p>I had made my friend understand by a sign that we should do
better not to insist; but, being determined to enter the inn, he
slipped by the man on the doorstep and was in the common
room.</p>

<p>"Come on," he said, "it is very comfortable here."</p>

<p>A good fire was blazing in the chimney, and we held our hands
to the warmth it sent out; it was a morning in which the approach
of winter was unmistakable. The room was a tolerably large one,
furnished with two heavy tables, some stools, a counter decorated
with rows of bottles of syrup and alcohol. Three windows looked
out on to the road. A coloured advertisement lauded the many
merits of a new vermouth. On the mantelpiece was arrayed the
innkeeper's collection of figured earthenware pots and stone
jugs.</p>

<p>"That's a fine fire for roasting a chicken," said
Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"We have no chicken&mdash;not even a wretched rabbit," said
the landlord.</p>

<p>"I know," said my friend slowly; "I know&mdash;We shall have
to eat red meat&mdash;now."</p>

<p>I confess I did not in the least understand what Rouletabille
meant by what he had said; but the landlord, as soon as he heard
the words, uttered an oath, which he at once stifled, and placed
himself at our orders as obediently as Monsieur Robert Darzac had
done, when he heard Rouletabille's prophetic sentence&mdash;"The
presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its
brightness." Certainly my friend knew how to make people
understand him by the use of wholly incomprehensible phrases. I
observed as much to him, but he merely smiled. I should have
proposed that he give me some explanation; but he put a finger to
his lips, which evidently signified that he had not only
determined not to speak, but also enjoined silence on my
part.</p>

<p>Meantime the man had pushed open a little side door and called
to somebody to bring him half a dozen eggs and a piece of
beefsteak. The commission was quickly executed by a
strongly-built young woman with beautiful blonde hair and large,
handsome eyes, who regarded us with curiosity.</p>

<p>The innkeeper said to her roughly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Get out!&mdash;and if the Green Man comes, don't let me see
him."</p>

<p>She disappeared. Rouletabille took the eggs, which had been
brought to him in a bowl, and the meat which was on a dish,
placed all carefully beside him in the chimney, unhooked a
frying-pan and a gridiron, and began to beat up our omelette
before proceeding to grill our beefsteak. He then ordered two
bottles of cider, and seemed to take as little notice of our host
as our host did of him. The landlord let us do our own cooking
and set our table near one of the windows.</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard him mutter:</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;there he is."</p>

<p>His face had changed, expressing fierce hatred. He went and
glued himself to one of the windows, watching the road. There was
no need for me to draw Rouletabille's attention; he had already
left our omelette and had joined the landlord at the window. I
went with him.</p>

<p>A man dressed entirely in green velvet, his head covered with
a huntsman's cap of the same colour, was advancing leisurely,
lighting a pipe as he walked. He carried a fowling-piece slung at
his back. His movements displayed an almost aristocratic ease. He
wore eye-glasses and appeared to be about five and forty years of
age. His hair as well as his moustache were salt grey. He was
remarkably handsome. As he passed near the inn, he hesitated, as
if asking himself whether or no he should enter it; gave a glance
towards us, took a few whiffs at his pipe, and then resumed his
walk at the same nonchalant pace.</p>

<p>Rouletabille and I looked at our host. His flashing eyes, his
clenched hands, his trembling lips, told us of the tumultuous
feelings by which he was being agitated.</p>

<p>"He has done well not to come in here to-day!" he hissed.</p>

<p>"Who is that man?" asked Rouletabille, returning to his
omelette.</p>

<p>"The Green Man," growled the innkeeper. "Don't you know him?
Then all the better for you. He is not an acquaintance to
make.&mdash;Well, he is Monsieur Stangerson's forest-keeper."</p>

<p>"You don't appear to like him very much?" asked the reporter,
pouring his omelette into the frying-pan.</p>

<p>"Nobody likes him, monsieur. He's an upstart who must once
have had a fortune of his own; and he forgives nobody because, in
order to live, he has been compelled to become a servant. A
keeper is as much a servant as any other, isn't he? Upon my word,
one would say that <i>he</i> is the master of the Glandier, and
that all the land and woods belong to him. He'll not let a poor
creature eat a morsel of bread on the grass&mdash;<i>his</i>
grass!"</p>

<p>"Does he often come here?"</p>

<p>"Too often. But I've made him understand that his face doesn't
please me, and, for a month past, he hasn't been here. The Donjon
Inn has never existed for him!&mdash;he hasn't had
time!&mdash;been too much engaged in paying court to the landlady
of the Three Lilies at Saint-Michel. A bad fellow!&mdash;There
isn't an honest man who can bear him. Why, the concierges of the
château would turn their eyes away from a picture of him!"</p>

<p>"The concierges of the château are honest people, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they are, as true as my name's Mathieu, monsieur. I
believe them to be honest."</p>

<p>"Yet they've been arrested?"</p>

<p>"What does that prove?&mdash;But I don't want to mix myself up
in other people's affairs."</p>

<p>"And what do you think of the murder?"</p>

<p>"Of the murder of poor Mademoiselle Stangerson?&mdash;A good
girl much loved everywhere in the country. That's what I think of
it&mdash;and many things besides; but that's nobody's
business."</p>

<p>"Not even mine?" insisted Rouletabille.</p>

<p>The innkeeper looked at him sideways and said gruffly:</p>

<p>"Not even yours."</p>

<p>The omelette ready, we sat down at table and were silently
eating, when the door was pushed open and an old woman, dressed
in rags, leaning on a stick, her head doddering, her white hair
hanging loosely over her wrinkled forehead, appeared on the
threshold.</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;there you are, Mother Angenoux!&mdash;It's long
since we saw you last," said our host.</p>

<p>"I have been very ill, very nearly dying," said the old woman.
"If ever you should have any scraps for the <i>Bête du Bon
Dieu</i>&mdash;?"</p>

<p>And she entered, followed by a cat, larger than any I had ever
believed could exist. The beast looked at us and gave so hopeless
a miau that I shuddered. I had never heard so lugubrious a
cry.</p>

<p>As if drawn by the cat's cry a man followed the old woman in.
It was the Green Man. He saluted by raising his hand to his cap
and seated himself at a table near to ours.</p>

<p>"A glass of cider, Daddy Mathieu," he said.</p>

<p>As the Green Man entered, Daddy Mathieu had started violently;
but visibly mastering himself he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've no more cider; I served the last bottles to these
gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Then give me a glass of white wine," said the Green Man,
without showing the least surprise.</p>

<p>"I've no more white wine&mdash;no more anything," said Daddy
Mathieu, surlily.</p>

<p>"How is Madame Mathieu?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, thank you."</p>

<p>So the young woman with the large, tender eyes, whom we had
just seen, was the wife of this repugnant and brutal rustic,
whose jealousy seemed to emphasise his physical ugliness.</p>

<p>Slamming the door behind him, the innkeeper left the room.
Mother Angenoux was still standing, leaning on her stick, the cat
at her feet.</p>

<p>"You've been ill, Mother Angenoux?&mdash;Is that why we have
not seen you for the last week?" asked the Green Man.</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur keeper. I have been able to get up but three
times, to go to pray to Sainte-Geneviève, our good patroness, and
the rest of the time I have been lying on my bed. There was no
one to care for me but the <i>Bête du bon Dieu!</i>"</p>

<p>"Did she not leave you?"</p>

<p>"Neither by day nor by night."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that?"</p>

<p>"As I am of Paradise."</p>

<p>"Then how was it, Madame Angenoux, that all through the night
of the murder nothing but the cry of the <i>Bête du bon Dieu</i>
was heard?"</p>

<p>Mother Angenoux planted herself in front of the forest-keeper
and struck the floor with her stick.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about it," she said. "But shall I tell
you something? There are no two cats in the world that cry like
that. Well, on the night of the murder I also heard the cry of
the <i>Bête du bon Dieu</i> outside; and yet she was on my knees,
and did not mew once, I swear. I crossed myself when I heard
that, as if I had heard the devil."</p>

<p>I looked at the keeper when he put the last question, and I am
much mistaken if I did not detect an evil smile on his lips. At
that moment, the noise of loud quarrelling reached us. We even
thought we heard a dull sound of blows, as if some one was being
beaten. The Green Man quickly rose and hurried to the door by the
side of the fireplace; but it was opened by the landlord who
appeared, and said to the keeper:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't alarm yourself, Monsieur&mdash;it is my wife; she has
the toothache." And he laughed. "Here, Mother Angenoux, here are
some scraps for your cat."</p>

<p>He held out a packet to the old woman, who took it eagerly and
went out by the door, closely followed by her cat.</p>

<p>"Then you won't serve me?" asked the Green Man.</p>

<p>Daddy Mathieu's face was placid and no longer retained its
expression of hatred.</p>

<p>"I've nothing for you&mdash;nothing for you. Take yourself
off."</p>

<p>The Green Man quietly refilled his pipe, lit it, bowed to us,
and went out. No sooner was he over the threshold than Daddy
Mathieu slammed the door after him and, turning towards us, with
eyes bloodshot, and frothing at the mouth, he hissed to us,
shaking his clenched fist at the door he had just shut on the man
he evidently hated:</p>

<p>"I don't know who you are who tell me 'We shall have to eat
red meat&mdash;now'; but if it will interest you to know
it&mdash;<i>that</i> man is the murderer!"</p>

<p>With which words Daddy Mathieu immediately left us.
Rouletabille returned towards the fireplace and said:</p>

<p>"Now we'll grill our steak. How do you like the
cider?&mdash;It's a little tart, but I like it."</p>

<p>We saw no more of Daddy Mathieu that day, and absolute silence
reigned in the inn when we left it, after placing five francs on
the table in payment for our feast.</p>

<p>Rouletabille at once set off on a three mile walk round
Professor Stangerson's estate. He halted for some ten minutes at
the corner of a narrow road black with soot, near to some
charcoal-burners' huts in the forest of Sainte-Geneviève, which
touches on the road from Epinay to Corbeil, to tell me that the
murderer had certainly passed that way, before entering the
grounds and concealing himself in the little clump of trees.</p>

<p>"You don't think, then, that the keeper knows anything of it?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"We shall see that, later," he replied. "For the present I'm
not interested in what the landlord said about the man. The
landlord hates him. I didn't take you to breakfast at the Donjon
Inn for the sake of the Green Man."</p>

<p>Then Rouletabille, with great precaution glided, followed by
me, towards the little building which, standing near the park
gate, served for the home of the concierges, who had been
arrested that morning. With the skill of an acrobat, he got into
the lodge by an upper window which had been left open, and
returned ten minutes later. He said only, "Ah!"&mdash;a word
which, in his mouth, signified many things.</p>

<p>We were about to take the road leading to the château, when a
considerable stir at the park gate attracted our attention. A
carriage had arrived and some people had come from the château to
meet it. Rouletabille pointed out to me a gentleman who descended
from it.</p>

<p>"That's the Chief of the Sûreté," he said. "Now we shall see
what Frédéric Larsan has up his sleeve, and whether he is so much
cleverer than anybody else."</p>

<p>The carriage of the Chief of the Sûreté was followed by three
other vehicles containing reporters, who were also desirous of
entering the park. But two gendarmes stationed at the gate had
evidently received orders to refuse admission to anybody. The
Chief of the Sûreté calmed their impatience by undertaking to
furnish to the press, that evening, all the information he could
give that would not interfere with the judicial inquiry.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="chaphead">In Which Frédéric Larsan Explains How The
Murderer Was Able To Get Out Of The Yellow Room.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
AMONG the mass of papers, legal documents, memoirs, and
extracts from newspapers, which I have collected, relating to the
mystery of "The Yellow Room," there is one very interesting
piece; it is a detail of the famous examination which took place
that afternoon, in the laboratory of Professor Stangerson, before
the Chief of the Sûreté. This narrative is from the pen of
Monsieur Maleine, the Registrar, who, like the examining
magistrate, had spent some of his leisure time in the pursuit of
literature. The piece was to have made part of a book which,
however, has never been published, and which was to have been
entitled: "My Examinations." It was given to me by the Registrar
himself, some time after the astonishing dénouement to this case,
and is unique in judicial chronicles.</p>

<p>Here it is. It is not a mere dry transcription of questions
and answers, because the Registrar often intersperses his story
with his own personal comments.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Registrar's Narrative</span></h3>

<p class="first">
THE examining magistrate and I (the writer relates) found
ourselves in "The Yellow Room" in the company of the builder who
had constructed the pavilion after Professor Stangerson's
designs. He had a workman with him. Monsieur de Marquet had had
the walls laid entirely bare; that is to say, he had had them
stripped of the paper which had decorated them. Blows with a
pick, here and there, satisfied us of the non-existence of any
sort of opening. The floor and the ceiling were thoroughly
sounded. We found nothing. There was nothing to be found.
Monsieur de Marquet appeared to be delighted and never ceased
repeating:</p>

<p>"What a case! What a case! We shall never know, you'll see,
how the murderer was able to get out of this room!"</p>

<p>Then suddenly, with a radiant face, he called to the officer
in charge of the gendarmes.</p>

<p>"Go to the château," he said, "and request Monsieur Stangerson
and Monsieur Robert Darzac to come to me in the laboratory, also
Daddy Jacques; and let your men bring here the two
concierges."</p>

<p>Five minutes later all were assembled in the laboratory. The
Chief of the Sûreté, who had arrived at the Glandier, joined us
at that moment. I was seated at Monsieur Stangerson's desk ready
for work, when Monsieur de Marquet made us the following little
speech&mdash;as original as it was unexpected:&mdash;</p>

<p>"With your permission, gentlemen&mdash;as examinations lead to
nothing&mdash;we will, for once, abandon the old system of
interrogation. I will not have you brought before me one by one,
but we will all remain here as we are,&mdash;Monsieur Stangerson,
Monsieur Robert Darzac, Daddy Jacques, and the two concierges,
the Chief of the Sûreté, the Registrar, and myself. We shall all
be on the same footing. The concierges may, for the moment,
forget that they have been arrested. We are going to confer
together. We are on the spot where the crime was committed. We
have nothing else to discuss but the crime. So let us discuss it
freely&mdash;intelligently or otherwise, so long as we speak just
what is in our minds. There need be no formality or method since
this won't help us in any way."</p>

<p>Then, passing before me, he said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"What do you think of that, eh? What a scene! Could <i>you</i>
have thought of that? I'll make a little piece out of it for the
Vaudeville." And he rubbed his hands with glee.</p>

<p>I turned my eyes on Monsieur Stangerson. The hope he had
received from the doctor's latest reports, who had stated that
Mademoiselle Stangerson might recover from her wounds, had not
been able to efface from his noble features the marks of the
great sorrow that was upon him. He had believed his daughter to
be dead, and he was still broken by that belief. His clear, soft,
blue eyes expressed infinite sorrow. I had had occasion, many
times, to see Monsieur Stangerson at public ceremonies, and from
the first had been struck by his countenance, which seemed as
pure as that of a child&mdash;the dreamy gaze with the sublime
and mystical expression of the inventor and thinker.</p>

<p>On those occasions his daughter was always to be seen either
following him or by his side; for they never quitted each other,
it was said, and had shared the same labours for many years. The
young lady, who was then five and thirty, though she looked no
more than thirty, had devoted herself entirely to science. She
still won admiration for her imperial beauty which had remained
intact, without a wrinkle, withstanding time and love. Who would
have dreamed that I should one day be seated by her pillow with
my papers, and that I should see her, on the point of death,
painfully recounting to us the most monstrous and most mysterious
crime I have heard of in my career? Who would have thought that I
should be, that afternoon, listening to the despairing father
vainly trying to explain how his daughter's assailant had been
able to escape from him? Why bury ourselves with our work in
obscure retreats in the depths of woods, if it may not protect us
against those dangerous chances to life and death which meet us
in the busy cities?</p>

<p>"Now, Monsieur Stangerson," said Monsieur de Marquet, with
somewhat of an important air, "place yourself exactly where you
were when Mademoiselle Stangerson left you to go to her
chamber."</p>

<p>Monsieur Stangerson rose and, standing at a certain distance
from the door of The Yellow Room, said, in an even voice and
without the least trace of emphasis&mdash;a voice which I can
only describe as a dead voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was here. About eleven o'clock, after I had made a brief
chemical experiment at the furnaces of the laboratory, needing
all the space behind me, I had my desk moved here by Daddy
Jacques, who spent the evening in cleaning some of my apparatus.
My daughter had been working at the same desk with me. When it
was her time to leave she rose, kissed me, and bade Daddy Jacques
good-night. She had to pass behind my desk and the door to enter
her chamber, and she could do this only with some difficulty.
That is to say, I was very near the place where the crime
occurred later."</p>

<p>"And the desk?" I asked, obeying, in thus mixing myself in the
conversation, the express orders of my chief, "as soon as you
heard the cry of 'murder' followed by the revolver shots, what
became of the desk?"</p>

<p>Daddy Jacques answered.</p>

<p>"We pushed it back against the wall, here&mdash;close to where
it is at the present moment&mdash;so as to be able to get at the
door at once."</p>

<p>I followed up my reasoning, to which, however, I attached but
little importance, regarding it as only a weak hypothesis, with
another question.</p>

<p>"Might not a man in the room, the desk being so near to the
door, by stooping and slipping under the desk, have left it
unobserved?"</p>

<p>"You are forgetting," interrupted Monsieur Stangerson wearily,
"that my daughter had locked and bolted her door, that the door
had remained fastened, that we vainly tried to force it open when
we heard the noise, and that we were at the door while the
struggle between the murderer and my poor child was going on
immediately after we heard her stifled cries while she was being
held by the fingers that have left their red mark upon her
throat. Rapid as the attack was, we were no less rapid in our
endeavours to get into the room where the tragedy was taking
place."</p>

<p>I rose from my seat and once more examined the door with the
greatest care. Then I returned to my place with a despairing
gesture.</p>

<p>"If the lower panel of the door," I said, "could be removed
without the whole door being necessarily opened, the problem
would be solved. But, unfortunately, that last hypothesis is
untenable after an examination of the door&mdash;it's of oak,
solid and massive. You can see that quite plainly, in spite of
the injury done in the attempt to burst it open."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Daddy Jacques, "it is an old and solid door that
was brought from the château&mdash;they don't make such doors
now. We had to use this bar of iron to get it open, all four of
us&mdash;for the concierge, brave woman she is&mdash;helped us.
It pains me to find them both in prison now."</p>

<p>Daddy Jacques had no sooner uttered these words of pity and
protestation than tears and lamentations broke out from the
concierges. I never saw two accused people crying more bitterly.
I was extremely disgusted. Even if they were innocent, I could
not understand how they could behave like that in the face of
misfortune. A dignified bearing at such times is better than
tears and groans, which, most often, are feigned.</p>

<p>"Now then, enough of that snivelling," cried Monsieur de
Marquet; "and, in your interest, tell us what you were doing
under the windows of the pavilion at the time your mistress was
being attacked; for you were close to the pavilion when Daddy
Jacques met you."</p>

<p>"We were coming to help!" they whined.</p>

<p>"If we could only lay hands on the murderer, he'd never taste
bread again!" the woman gurgled between her sobs.</p>

<p>As before we were unable to get two connecting thoughts out of
them. They persisted in their denials and swore, by heaven and
all the saints, that they were in bed when they heard the sound
of the revolver shot.</p>

<p>"It was not one, but two shots that were fired!&mdash;You see,
you are lying. If you had heard one, you would have heard the
other."</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu! Monsieur&mdash;it was the second shot we heard. We
were asleep when the first shot was fired."</p>

<p>"Two shots <i>were</i> fired," said Daddy Jacques. "I am
certain that <i>all</i> the cartridges were in my revolver. We
found afterward that two had been exploded, and we heard two
shots behind the door. Was not that so, Monsieur Stangerson?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Professor, "there were two shots, one dull,
and the other sharp and ringing."</p>

<p>"Why do you persist in lying?" cried Monsieur de Marquet,
turning to the concierges. "Do you think the police are the fools
you are? Everything points to the fact that you were out of doors
and near the pavilion at the time of the tragedy. What were you
doing there? So far as I am concerned," he said, turning to
Monsieur Stangerson, "I can only explain the escape of the
murderer on the assumption of help from these two accomplices. As
soon as the door was forced open, and while you, Monsieur
Stangerson, were occupied with your unfortunate child, the
concierge and his wife facilitated the flight of the murderer,
who, screening himself behind them, reached the window in the
vestibule, and sprang out of it into the park. The concierge
closed the window after him and fastened the blinds, which
certainly could not have closed and fastened of themselves. That
is the conclusion I have arrived at. If anyone here has any other
idea, let him state it."</p>

<p>Monsieur Stangerson intervened:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What you say was impossible. I do not believe either in the
guilt or in the connivance of my concierges, though I cannot
understand what they were doing in the park at that late hour of
the night. I say it was impossible, because Madame Bernier held
the lamp and did not move from the threshold of the room; because
I, as soon as the door was forced open, threw myself on my knees
beside my daughter, and no one could have left or entered the
room by the door, without passing over her body and forcing his
way by me! Daddy Jacques and the concierge had but to cast a
glance round the chamber and under the bed, as I had done on
entering, to see that there was nobody in it but my daughter
lying on the floor."</p>

<p>"What do you think, Monsieur Darzac?" asked the
magistrate.</p>

<p>Monsieur Darzac replied that he had no opinion to express.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dax, the Chief of the Sûreté, who, so far, had been
listening and examining the room, at length deigned to open his
lips:&mdash;</p>

<p>"While search is being made for the criminal, we had better
try to find out the motive for the crime; that will advance us a
little," he said. Turning towards Monsieur Stangerson, he
continued, in the even, intelligent tone indicative of a strong
character, "I understand that Mademoiselle was shortly to have
been married?"</p>

<p>The professor looked sadly at Monsieur Robert Darzac.</p>

<p>"With my friend here, whom I should have been happy to call my
son&mdash;with Monsieur Robert Darzac."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Stangerson is much better and is rapidly
recovering from her wounds. The marriage is simply delayed, is it
not, Monsieur?" insisted the Chief of the Sûreté.</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"What! Is there any doubt about that?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Stangerson did not answer. Monsieur Robert Darzac
seemed agitated. I saw that his hand trembled as it fingered his
watch-chain. Monsieur Dax coughed, as did Monsieur de Marquet.
Both were evidently embarrassed.</p>

<p>"You understand, Monsieur Stangerson," he said, "that in an
affair so perplexing as this, we cannot neglect anything; we must
know all, even the smallest and seemingly most futile thing
concerning the victim&mdash;information apparently the most
insignificant. Why do you doubt that this marriage will take
place? You expressed a hope; but the hope implies a doubt. Why do
you doubt?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Stangerson made a visible effort to recover
himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur," he said at length. "You are right. It will be
best that you should know something which, if I concealed it,
might appear to be of importance; Monsieur Darzac agrees with me
in this."</p>

<p>Monsieur Darzac, whose pallor at that moment seemed to me to
be altogether abnormal, made a sign of assent. I gathered he was
unable to speak.</p>

<p>"I want you to know then," continued Monsieur Stangerson,
"that my daughter has sworn never to leave me, and adheres firmly
to her oath, in spite of all my prayers and all that I have
argued to induce her to marry. We have known Monsieur Robert
Darzac many years. He loves my child; and I believed that she
loved him, because she only recently consented to this marriage
which I desire with all my heart. I am an old man, Monsieur, and
it was a happy hour to me when I knew that, after I had gone, she
would have at her side, one who loved her and who would help her
in continuing our common labours. I love and esteem Monsieur
Darzac both for his greatness of heart and for his devotion to
science. But, two days before the tragedy, for I know not what
reason, my daughter declared to me that she would never marry
Monsieur Darzac."</p>

<p>A dead silence followed Monsieur Stangerson's words. It was a
moment fraught with suspense.</p>

<p>"Did Mademoiselle give you any explanation,&mdash;did she tell
you what her motive was?" asked Monsieur Dax.</p>

<p>"She told me she was too old to marry&mdash;that she had
waited too long. She said she had given much thought to the
matter and while she had a great esteem, even affection, for
Monsieur Darzac, she felt it would be better if things remained
as they were. She would be happy, she said, to see the relations
between ourselves and Monsieur Darzac become nearer to us, but
only on the understanding that there would be no more talk of
marriage."</p>

<p>"That is very strange!" muttered Monsieur Dax.</p>

<p>"Strange!" repeated Monsieur de Marquet.</p>

<p>"You'll certainly not find the motive there, Monsieur Dax,"
Monsieur Stangerson said with a cold smile.</p>

<p>"In any case, the motive was not theft!" said the Chief
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Oh! we are quite convinced of that!" cried the examining
magistrate.</p>

<p>At that moment the door of the laboratory opened and the
officer in charge of the gendarmes entered and handed a card to
the examining magistrate. Monsieur de Marquet read it and uttered
a half angry exclamation:</p>

<p>"This is really too much!" he cried.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the Chief.</p>

<p>"It's the card of a young reporter engaged on the 'Epoque,' a
Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille. It has these words written on it:
'One of the motives of the crime was robbery.'"</p>

<p>The Chief smiled.</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;young Rouletabille&mdash;I've heard of him&mdash;he
is considered rather clever. Let him come in."</p>

<p>Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille was allowed to enter. I had made
his acquaintance in the train that morning on the way to
Epinay-sur-Orge. He had introduced himself almost against my wish
into our compartment. I had better say at once that his manners,
and the arrogance with which he assumed to know what was
incomprehensible even to us, impressed him unfavourably on my
mind. I do not like journalists. They are a class of writers to
be avoided as the pest. They think that everything is permissible
and they respect nothing. Grant them the least favour, allow them
even to approach you, and you never can tell what annoyance they
may give you. This one appears to be scarcely twenty years old,
and the effrontery with which he dared to question us and discuss
the matter with us made him particularly obnoxious to me.
Besides, he had a way of expressing himself that left us guessing
as to whether he was mocking us or not. I know quite well that
the "Epoque" is an influential paper with which it is well to be
on good terms, but the paper ought not to allow itself to be
represented by sneaking reporters.</p>

<p>Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille entered the laboratory, bowed to
us, and waited for Monsieur de Marquet to ask him to explain his
presence.</p>

<p>"You pretend, Monsieur, that you know the motive for the
crime, and that that motive&mdash;in the face of all the evidence
that has been forthcoming&mdash;was robbery?"</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur, I do not pretend that. I do not say that
robbery was the motive for the crime, and I don't believe it
was."</p>

<p>"Then, what is the meaning of this card?"</p>

<p>"It means that robbery was <i>one</i> of the motives for the
crime."</p>

<p>"What leads you to think that?"</p>

<p>"If you will be good enough to accompany me, I will show
you."</p>

<p>The young man asked us to follow him into the vestibule, and
we did. He led us towards the lavatory and begged Monsieur de
Marquet to kneel beside him. This lavatory is lit by the glass
door, and, when the door was open, the light which penetrated was
sufficient to light it perfectly. Monsieur de Marquet and
Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille knelt down on the threshold, and the
young man pointed to a spot on the pavement.</p>

<p>"The stones of the lavatory have not been washed by Daddy
Jacques for some time," he said; "that can be seen by the layer
of dust that covers them. Now, notice here, the marks of two
large footprints and the black ash they left where they have
been. That ash is nothing else than the charcoal dust that covers
the path along which you must pass through the forest, in order
to get directly from Epinay to the Glandier. You know there is a
little village of charcoal-burners at that place, who make large
quantities of charcoal. What the murderer did was to come here at
midday, when there was nobody at the pavilion, and attempt his
robbery."</p>

<p>"But what robbery?&mdash;Where do you see any signs of
robbery? What proves to you that a robbery has been committed?"
we all cried at once.</p>

<p>"What put me on the trace of it," continued the
journalist,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Was this?" interrupted Monsieur de Marquet, still on his
knees.</p>

<p>"Evidently," said Rouletabille.</p>

<p>And Monsieur de Marquet explained that there were on the dust
of the pavement marks of two footsteps, as well as the
impression, freshly-made, of a heavy rectangular parcel, the
marks of the cord with which it had been fastened being easily
distinguished.</p>

<p>"You have been here, then, Monsieur Rouletabille? I thought I
had given orders to Daddy Jacques, who was left in charge of the
pavilion, not to allow anybody to enter."</p>

<p>"Don't scold Daddy Jacques, I came here with Monsieur Robert
Darzac."</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;Indeed!" exclaimed Monsieur de Marquet,
disagreeably, casting a side-glance at Monsieur Darzac, who
remained perfectly silent.</p>

<p>"When I saw the mark of the parcel by the side of the
footprints, I had no doubt as to the robbery," replied Monsieur
Rouletabille. "The thief had not brought a parcel with him; he
had made one here&mdash;a parcel with the stolen objects, no
doubt; and he put it in this corner intending to take it away
when the moment came for him to make his escape. He had also
placed his heavy boots beside the parcel,&mdash;for,
see&mdash;there are no marks of steps leading to the marks left
by the boots, which were placed side by side. That accounts for
the fact that the murderer left no trace of his steps when he
fled from The Yellow Room, nor any in the laboratory, nor in the
vestibule. After entering The Yellow Room in his boots, he took
them off, finding them troublesome, or because he wished to make
as little noise as possible. The marks made by him <i>in
going</i> through the vestibule and the laboratory were
subsequently washed out by Daddy Jacques. Having, for some reason
or other, taken off his boots, the murderer carried them in his
hand and placed them by the side of the parcel he had
made,&mdash;by that time the robbery had been accomplished. The
man then returned to The Yellow Room and slipped under the bed,
where the mark of his body is perfectly visible on the floor and
even on the mat, which has been slightly moved from its place and
creased. Fragments of straw also, recently torn, bear witness to
the murderer's movements under the bed."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes,&mdash;we know all about that," said Monsieur de
Marquet.</p>

<p>"The robber had another motive for returning to hide under the
bed," continued the astonishing boy-journalist. "You might think
that he was trying to hide himself quickly on seeing, through the
vestibule window, Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson about to
enter the pavilion. It would have been much easier for him to
have climbed up to the attic and hidden there, waiting for an
opportunity to get away, if his purpose had been only
flight.&mdash;No! No!&mdash;he <i>had to be</i> in The Yellow
Room."</p>

<p>Here the Chief intervened.</p>

<p>"That's not at all bad, young man. I compliment you. If we do
not know yet how the murderer succeeded in getting away, we can
at any rate see how he came in and committed the robbery. But
what did he steal?"</p>

<p>"Something very valuable," replied the young reporter.</p>

<p>At that moment we heard a cry from the laboratory. We rushed
in and found Monsieur Stangerson, his eyes haggard, his limbs
trembling, pointing to a sort of bookcase which he had opened,
and which, we saw, was empty. At the same instant he sank into
the large armchair that was placed before the desk and groaned,
the tears rolling down his cheeks, "I have been robbed again! For
God's sake, do not say a word of this to my daughter. She would
be more pained than I am." He heaved a deep sigh and added, in a
tone I shall never forget: "After all, what does it
matter,&mdash;so long as she lives!"</p>

<p>"She will live!" said Monsieur Darzac, in a voice strangely
touching.</p>

<p>"And we will find the stolen articles," said Monsieur Dax.
"But what was in the cabinet?"</p>

<p>"Twenty years of my life," replied the illustrious professor
sadly, "or rather of <i>our</i> lives&mdash;the lives of myself
and my daughter! Yes, our most precious documents, the records of
our secret experiments and our labours of twenty years were in
that cabinet. It is an irreparable loss to us and, I venture to
say, to science. All the processes by which I had been able to
arrive at the precious proof of the destructibility of matter
were there&mdash;all. The man who came wished to take all from
me,&mdash;my daughter and my work&mdash;my heart and my
soul."</p>

<p>And the great scientist wept like a child.</p>

<p>We stood around him in silence, deeply affected by his great
distress. Monsieur Darzac pressed closely to his side, and tried
in vain to restrain his tears&mdash;a sight which, for the
moment, almost made me like him, in spite of an instinctive
repulsion which his strange demeanour and his inexplicable
anxiety had inspired me.</p>

<p>Monsieur Rouletabille alone,&mdash;as if his precious time and
mission on earth did not permit him to dwell in the contemplation
on human suffering&mdash;had, very calmly, stepped up to the
empty cabinet and, pointing at it, broke the almost solemn
silence. He entered into explanations, for which there was no
need, as to why he had been led to believe that a robbery had
been committed, which included the simultaneous discovery he had
made in the lavatory, and the empty precious cabinet in the
laboratory. The first thing that had struck him, he said, was the
unusual form of that piece of furniture. It was very strongly
built of fire-proof iron, clearly showing that it was intended
for the keeping of most valuable objects. Then he noticed that
the key had been left in the lock. "One does not ordinarily have
a safe and leave it open!" he had said to himself. This little
key, with its brass head and complicated wards, had strongly
attracted him,&mdash;its presence had suggested robbery.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Marquet appeared to be greatly perplexed, as if he
did not know whether he ought to be glad of the new direction
given to the inquiry by the young reporter, or sorry that it had
not been done by himself. In our profession and for the general
welfare, we have to put up with such mortifications and bury
selfish feelings. That was why Monsieur de Marquet controlled
himself and joined his compliments with those of Monsieur Dax. As
for Monsieur Rouletabille, he simply shrugged his shoulders and
said: "There's nothing at all in that!" I should have liked to
box his ears, especially when he added: "You will do well,
Monsieur, to ask Monsieur Stangerson who usually kept that
key?"</p>

<p>"My daughter," replied Monsieur Stangerson, "she was never
without it."</p>

<p>"Ah! then that changes the aspect of things which no longer
corresponds with Monsieur Rouletabille's ideas!" cried Monsieur
de Marquet. "If that key never left Mademoiselle Stangerson, the
murderer must have waited for her in her room for the purpose of
stealing it; and the robbery could not have been committed until
after the attack had been made on her. But after the attack four
persons were in the laboratory! I can't make it out!"</p>

<p>"The robbery," said the reporter, "could only have been
committed before the attack upon Mademoiselle Stangerson in her
room. When the murderer entered the pavilion he already possessed
the brass-headed key."</p>

<p>"That is impossible," said Monsieur Stangerson in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"It is quite possible, Monsieur, as this proves."</p>

<p>And the young rascal drew a copy of the "Epoque" from his
pocket, dated the 21st of October (I recall the fact that the
crime was committed on the night between the 24th and 25th), and
showing us an advertisement, he read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Yesterday a black satin reticule was lost in the Grands
Magasins de la Louvre. It contained, amongst other things, a
small key with a brass head. A handsome reward will be given to
the person who has found it. This person must write, poste
restante, bureau 40, to this address: M. A. T. H. S. N.' Do not
these letters suggest Mademoiselle Stangerson?" continued the
reporter. "The 'key with a brass head'&mdash;is not <i>this</i>
the key? I always read advertisements. In my business, as in
yours, Monsieur, one should always read the 'personals.' They are
often the keys to intrigues, that are not always brass-headed,
but which are none the less interesting. This advertisement
interested me specially; the woman of the key surrounded it with
a kind of mystery. Evidently she valued the key, since she
promised a big reward for its restoration! And I thought on these
six letters: M. A. T. H. S. N. The first four at once pointed to
a Christian name; evidently I said Math is Mathilde. But I could
make nothing of the two last letters. So I threw the journal
aside and occupied myself with other matters. Four days later,
when the evening paper appeared with enormous head-lines
announcing the murder of Mademoiselle Stangerson, the letters in
the advertisement mechanically recurred to me. I had forgotten
the two last letters, S.N. When I saw them again I could not
help exclaiming, 'Stangerson!' I jumped into a cab and rushed
into the bureau No. 40, asking: 'Have you a letter addressed to
M A.T.H.S.N.?' The clerk replied that he had not. I
insisted, begged and entreated him to search. He wanted to know
if I were playing a joke on him, and then told me that he had had
a letter with the initials M.A.T.H.S.N., but he had given it
up three days ago, to a lady who came for it. 'You come to-day to
claim the letter, and the day before yesterday another gentleman
claimed it! I've had enough of this,' he concluded angrily. I
tried to question him as to the two persons who had already
claimed the letter; but whether he wished to entrench himself
behind professional secrecy,&mdash;he may have thought that he
had already said too much,&mdash;or whether he was disgusted at
the joke that had been played on him&mdash;he would not answer
any of my questions."</p>

<p>Rouletabille paused. We all remained silent. Each drew his own
conclusions from the strange story of the poste restante letter.
It seemed, indeed, that we now had a thread by means of which we
should be able to follow up this extraordinary mystery.</p>

<p>"Then it is almost certain," said Monsieur Stangerson, "that
my daughter did lose the key, and that she did not tell me of it,
wishing to spare any anxiety, and that she begged whoever had
found it to write to the poste restante. She evidently feared
that, by giving our address, inquiries would have resulted that
would have apprised me of the loss of the key. It was quite
logical, quite natural for her to have taken that
course&mdash;for I have been robbed once before."</p>

<p>"Where was that, and when?" asked the Chief of the Sûreté.</p>

<p>"Oh! many years ago, in America, in Philadelphia. There were
stolen from my laboratory the drawings of two inventions that
might have made the fortune of a man. Not only have I never
learnt who the thief was, but I have never heard even a word of
the object of the robbery, doubtless because, in order to defeat
the plans of the person who had robbed me, I myself brought these
two inventions before the public, and so rendered the robbery of
no avail. From that time on I have been very careful to shut
myself in when I am at work. The bars to these windows, the
lonely situation of this pavilion, this cabinet, which I had
specially constructed, this special lock, this unique key, all
are precautions against fears inspired by a sad experience."</p>

<p>"Most interesting!" remarked Monsieur Dax.</p>

<p>Monsieur Rouletabille asked about the reticule. Neither
Monsieur Stangerson nor Daddy Jacques had seen it for several
days, but a few hours later we learned from Mademoiselle
Stangerson herself that the reticule had either been stolen from
her, or she had lost it. She further corroborated all that had
passed just as her father had stated. She had gone to the poste
restante and, on the 23rd of October, had received a letter
which, she affirmed, contained nothing but a vulgar pleasantry,
which she had immediately burned.</p>

<p>To return to our examination, or rather to our conversation. I
must state that the Chief of the Sûreté, having inquired of
Monsieur Stangerson under what conditions his daughter had gone
to Paris on the 20th of October, we learned that Monsieur Robert
Darzac had accompanied her, and Darzac had not been again seen at
the château from that time to the day after the crime had been
committed. The fact that Monsieur Darzac was with her in the
Grands Magasins de la Louvre when the reticule disappeared, could
not pass unnoticed, and, it must be said, strongly awakened our
interest.</p>

<p>This conversation between magistrates, accused, victim,
witnesses and journalist, was coming to a close when quite a
theatrical sensation&mdash;an incident of a kind displeasing to
Monsieur de Marquet&mdash;was produced. The officer of the
gendarmes came to announce that Frédéric Larsan requested to be
admitted,&mdash;a request that was at once complied with. He held
in his hand a heavy pair of muddy boots, which he threw on the
pavement of the laboratory.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, "are the boots worn by the murderer. Do you
recognise them, Daddy Jacques?"</p>

<p>Daddy Jacques bent over them and, stupefied, recognised a pair
of old boots which he had, some time back, thrown into a corner
of his attic. He was so taken aback that he could not hide his
agitation.</p>

<p>Then pointing to the handkerchief in the old man's hand,
Frédéric Larsan said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's a handkerchief astonishingly like the one found in The
Yellow Room."</p>

<p>"I know," said Daddy Jacques, trembling, "they are almost
alike."</p>

<p>"And then," continued Frédéric Larsan, "the old Basque cap
also found in The Yellow Room might at one time have been worn by
Daddy Jacques himself. All this, gentlemen, proves, I think, that
the murderer wished to disguise his real personality. He did it
in a very clumsy way&mdash;or, at least, so it appears to us.
Don't be alarmed, Daddy Jacques; we are quite sure that you were
not the murderer; you never left the side of Monsieur Stangerson.
But if Monsieur Stangerson had not been working that night and
had gone back to the château after parting with his daughter, and
Daddy Jacques had gone to sleep in his attic, no one would have
doubted that he was the murderer. He owes his safety, therefore,
to the tragedy having been enacted too soon,&mdash;the murderer,
no doubt, from the silence in the laboratory, imagined that it
was empty, and that the moment for action had come. The man who
had been able to introduce himself here so mysteriously and to
leave so many evidences against Daddy Jacques, was, there can be
no doubt, familiar with the house. At what hour exactly he
entered, whether in the afternoon or in the evening, I cannot
say. One familiar with the proceedings and persons of this
pavilion could choose his own time for entering The Yellow
Room."</p>

<p>"He could not have entered it if anybody had been in the
laboratory," said Monsieur de Marquet.</p>

<p>"How do we know that?" replied Larsan. "There was the dinner
in the laboratory, the coming and going of the servants in
attendance. There was a chemical experiment being carried on
between ten and eleven o'clock, with Monsieur Stangerson, his
daughter, and Daddy Jacques engaged at the furnace in a corner of
the high chimney. Who can say that the murderer&mdash;an
intimate!&mdash;a friend!&mdash;did not take advantage of that
moment to slip into The Yellow Room, after having taken off his
boots in the lavatory?"</p>

<p>"It is very improbable," said Monsieur Stangerson.</p>

<p>"Doubtless&mdash;but it is not impossible. I assert nothing.
As to the escape from the pavilion&mdash;that's another thing,
the most natural thing in the world."</p>

<p>For a moment Frédéric Larsan paused,&mdash;a moment that
appeared to us a very long time. The eagerness with which we
awaited what he was going to tell us may be imagined.</p>

<p>"I have not been in The Yellow Room," he continued, "but I
take it for granted that you have satisfied yourselves that he
could have left the room only by way of the door; it is by the
door, then, that the murderer made his way out. At what time? At
the moment when it was most easy for him to do so; at the moment
when it became most explainable&mdash;so completely explainable
that there can be no other explanation. Let us go over the
<i>moments</i> which followed after the crime had been committed.
There was the first moment, when Monsieur Stangerson and Daddy
Jacques were close to the door, ready to bar the way. There was
the second moment, during which Daddy Jacques was absent and
Monsieur Stangerson was left alone before the door. There was a
third moment, when Monsieur Stangerson was joined by the
concierge. There was a fourth moment, during which Monsieur
Stangerson, the concierge and his wife and Daddy Jacques were
before the door. There was a fifth moment, during which the door
was burst open and The Yellow Room entered. The moment at which
the flight is explainable is the very moment when there was the
least number of persons before the door. There was one moment
when there was but one person,&mdash;Monsieur Stangerson. Unless
a complicity of silence on the part of Daddy Jacques is
admitted&mdash;in which I do not believe&mdash;the door was
opened in the presence of Monsieur Stangerson alone and the man
escaped.</p>

<p>"Here we must admit that Monsieur Stangerson had powerful
reasons for not arresting, or not causing the arrest of the
murderer, since he allowed him to reach the window in the
vestibule and closed it after him!&mdash;That done, Mademoiselle
Stangerson, though horribly wounded, had still strength enough,
and no doubt in obedience to the entreaties of her father, to
refasten the door of her chamber, with both the bolt and the
lock, before sinking on the floor. We do not know who committed
the crime; we do not know of what wretch Monsieur and
Mademoiselle Stangerson are the victims, but there is no doubt
that <i>they</i> both know! The secret must be a terrible one,
for the father had not hesitated to leave his daughter to die
behind the door which she had shut upon herself,&mdash;terrible
for him to have allowed the assassin to escape. For there is no
other way in the world to explain the murderer's flight from The
Yellow Room!"</p>

<p>The silence which followed this dramatic and lucid explanation
was appalling. We all of us felt grieved for the illustrious
professor, so driven into a corner by the pitiless logic of
Frédéric Larsan, so forced to confess the whole truth of his
martyrdom or to keep silent, and thus make a yet more terrible
admission. The man himself, a veritable statue of sorrow, raised
his hand with a gesture so solemn that we bowed our heads to it
as before something sacred. He then pronounced these words, in a
voice so loud that it seemed to exhaust him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I swear by the head of my suffering child that I never for an
instant left the door of her chamber after hearing her cries for
help; that that door was not opened while I was alone in the
laboratory; and that, finally, when we entered The Yellow Room,
my three domestics and I, the murderer was no longer there! I
swear I do not know the murderer!"</p>

<p>Must I say it,&mdash;in spite of the solemnity of Monsieur
Stangerson's words, we did not believe in his denial? Frédéric
Larsan had shown us the truth and it was not so easily given
up.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Marquet announced that the conversation was at an
end, and as we were about to leave the laboratory, Joseph
Rouletabille approached Monsieur Stangerson, took him by the hand
with the greatest respect, and I heard him say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> believe you, Monsieur."</p>

<p>I here close the citation which I have thought it my duty to
make from Monsieur Maleine's narrative. I need not tell the
reader that all that passed in the laboratory was immediately and
faithfully reported to me by Rouletabille.</p>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>Frédéric Larsan's Cane.</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
IT was not till six o'clock that I left the château, taking
with me the article hastily written by my friend in the little
sitting-room which Monsieur Robert Darzac had placed at our
disposal. The reporter was to sleep at the château, taking
advantage of the to me inexplicable hospitality offered him by
Monsieur Robert Darzac, to whom Monsieur Stangerson, in that sad
time, left the care of all his domestic affairs. Nevertheless he
insisted on accompanying me to the station at Epinay. In crossing
the park, he said to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Frédéric is really very clever and has not belied his
reputation. Do you know how he came to find Daddy Jacques's
boots?&mdash;Near the spot where we noticed the traces of the
neat boots and the disappearance of the rough ones, there was a
square hole, freshly made in the moist ground, where a stone had
evidently been removed. Larsan searched for that stone without
finding it, and at once imagined that it had been used by the
murderer with which to sink the boots in the lake. Fred's
calculation was an excellent one, as the success of his search
proves. That escaped me; but my mind was turned in another
direction by the large number of false indications of his track
which the murderer left, and by the measure of the black
foot-marks corresponding with that of Daddy Jacques's boots,
which I had established without his suspecting it, on the floor
of The Yellow Room. All which was a proof, in my eyes, that the
murderer had sought to turn suspicion on to the old servant. Up
to that point, Larsan and I are in accord; but no further. It is
going to be a terrible matter; for I tell you he is working on
wrong lines, and I&mdash;I, must fight him with
<i>nothing!</i>"</p>

<p>I was surprised at the profoundly grave accent with which my
young friend pronounced the last words.</p>

<p>He repeated:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;terrible!&mdash;terrible! For it is fighting with
nothing, when you have only an idea to fight with."</p>

<p>At that moment we passed by the back of the château. Night had
come. A window on the first floor was partly open. A feeble light
came from it as well as some sounds which drew our attention. We
approached until we had reached the side of a door that was
situated just under the window. Rouletabille, in a low tone, made
me understand, that this was the window of Mademoiselle
Stangerson's chamber. The sounds which had attracted our
attention ceased, then were renewed for a moment, and then we
heard stifled sobs. We were only able to catch these words, which
reached us distinctly: "My poor Robert!"&mdash;Rouletabille
whispered in my ear:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If we only knew what was being said in that chamber, my
inquiry would soon be finished."</p>

<p>He looked about him. The darkness of the evening enveloped us;
we could not see much beyond the narrow path bordered by trees,
which ran behind the château. The sobs had ceased.</p>

<p>"If we can't hear we may at least try to see," said
Rouletabille.</p>

<p>And, making a sign to me to deaden the sound of my steps, he
led me across the path to the trunk of a tall beech tree, the
white bole of which was visible in the darkness. This tree grew
exactly in front of the window in which we were so much
interested, its lower branches being on a level with the first
floor of the château. From the height of those branches one might
certainly see what was passing in Mademoiselle Stangerson's
chamber. Evidently that was what Rouletabille thought, for,
enjoining me to remain hidden, he clasped the trunk with his
vigorous arms and climbed up. I soon lost sight of him amid the
branches, and then followed a deep silence.</p>

<p>In front of me, the open window remained lighted, and I saw no
shadow move across it. I listened, and presently from above me
these words reached my ears:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After you!"</p>

<p>"After you, pray!"</p>

<p>Somebody was overhead, speaking,&mdash;exchanging courtesies.
What was my astonishment to see on the slippery column of the
tree two human forms appear and quietly slip down to the ground.
Rouletabille had mounted alone, and had returned with
another.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Monsieur Sainclair!"</p>

<p>It was Frédéric Larsan. The detective had already occupied the
post of observation when my young friend had thought to reach it
alone. Neither noticed my astonishment. I explained that to
myself by the fact that they must have been witnesses of some
tender and despairing scene between Mademoiselle Stangerson,
lying in her bed, and Monsieur Darzac on his knees by her pillow.
I guessed that each had drawn different conclusions from what
they had seen. It was easy to see that the scene had strongly
impressed Rouletabille in favour of Monsieur Robert Darzac;
while, to Larsan, it showed nothing but consummate hypocrisy,
acted with finished art by Mademoiselle Stangerson's fiancé.</p>

<p>As we reached the park gate, Larsan stopped us.</p>

<p>"My cane!" he cried. "I left it near the tree."</p>

<p>He left us, saying he would rejoin us presently.</p>

<p>"Have you noticed Frédéric Larsan's cane?" asked the young
reporter, as soon as we were alone. "It is quite a new one, which
I have never seen him use before. He seems to take great care of
it&mdash;it never leaves him. One would think he was afraid it
might fall into the hands of strangers. I never saw it before
to-day. Where did he find it? It isn't natural that a man who had
never before used a walking-stick should, the day after the
Glandier crime, never move a step without one. On the day of our
arrival at the château, as soon as he saw us, he put his watch in
his pocket and picked up his cane from the ground&mdash;a
proceeding to which I was perhaps wrong not to attach some
importance."</p>

<p>We were now out of the park. Rouletabille had dropped into
silence. His thoughts were certainly still occupied with Frédéric
Larsan's new cane. I had proof of that when, as we came near to
Epinay, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Frédéric Larsan arrived at the Glandier before me; he began
his inquiry before me; he has had time to find out things about
which I know nothing. Where did he find that cane?" Then he
added: "It is probable that his suspicion&mdash;more than that,
his reasoning&mdash;has led him to lay his hand on something
tangible. Has this cane anything to do with it? Where the deuce
could he have found it?"</p>

<p>As I had to wait twenty minutes for the train at Epinay, we
entered a cabaret. Almost immediately the door opened and
Frédéric Larsan made his appearance, brandishing his famous
cane.</p>

<p>"I found it!" he said laughingly.</p>

<p>The three of us seated ourselves at a table. Rouletabille
never took his eyes off the cane; he was so absorbed that he did
not notice a sign Larsan made to a railway employé, a young man
with a chin decorated by a tiny blond and ill-kept beard. On the
sign he rose, paid for his drink, bowed, and went out. I should
not myself have attached any importance to the circumstance, if
it had not been recalled to my mind, some months later, by the
reappearance of the man with the beard at one of the most tragic
moments of this case. I then learned that the youth was one of
Larsan's assistants and had been charged by him to watch the
going and coming of travellers at the station of Epinay-sur-Orge.
Larsan neglected nothing in any case on which he was engaged.</p>

<p>I turned my eyes again on Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;Monsieur Fred!" he said, "when did you begin to use
a walking-stick? I have always seen you walking with your hands
in your pockets!"</p>

<p>"It is a present," replied the detective.</p>

<p>"Recent?" insisted Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"No, it was given to me in London."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I remember&mdash;you have just come from London. May
I look at it?"</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;certainly!"</p>

<p>Fred passed the cane to Rouletabille. It was a large yellow
bamboo with a crutch handle and ornamented with a gold ring.</p>

<p>Rouletabille, after examining it minutely, returned it to
Larsan, with a bantering expression on his face,
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You were given a French cane in London!"</p>

<p>"Possibly," said Fred, imperturbably.</p>

<p>"Read the mark there, in tiny letters: Cassette, 6a,
Opera."</p>

<p>"Cannot English people buy canes in Paris?"</p>

<p>When Rouletabille had seen me into the train, he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'll remember the address?"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;Cassette, 6a, Opera. Rely on me; you shall have
word to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>That evening, on reaching Paris, I saw Monsieur Cassette,
dealer in walking-sticks and umbrellas, and wrote to my
friend:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A man unmistakably answering to the description of Monsieur
Robert Darzac&mdash;same height, slightly stooping,
putty-coloured overcoat, bowler hat&mdash;purchased a cane
similar to the one in which we are interested, on the evening of
the crime, about eight o'clock. Monsieur Cassette had not sold
another such cane during the last two years. Fred's cane is new.
It is quite clear that it's the same cane. Fred did not buy it,
since he was in London. Like you, I think that he found it
somewhere near Monsieur Robert Darzac. But if, as you suppose,
the murderer was in The Yellow Room for five, or even six hours,
and the crime was not committed until towards midnight, the
purchase of this cane proves an incontestable <i>alibi</i> for
Darzac."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="chaphead">The Presbytery Has Lost Nothing Of Its Charm,
Nor The Garden Its Brightness.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
A WEEK after the occurrence of the events I have just
recounted&mdash;on the 2nd of November, to be exact&mdash;I
received at my home in Paris the following telegraphic message:
"Come to the Glandier by the earliest train. Bring revolvers.
Friendly greetings. Rouletabille."</p>

<p>I have already said, I think, that at that period, being a
young barrister with but few briefs, I frequented the Palais de
Justice rather for the purpose of familiarising myself with my
professional duties than for the defence of the widow and orphan.
I could, therefore, feel no surprise at Rouletabille disposing of
my time. Moreover, he knew how keenly interested I was in his
journalistic adventures in general and, above all, in the murder
at the Glandier. I had not heard from him for a week, nor of the
progress made with that mysterious case, except by the
innumerable paragraphs in the newspapers and by the very brief
notes of Rouletabille in the "Epoque." Those notes had divulged
the fact that traces of human blood had been found on the
mutton-bone, as well as fresh traces of the blood of Mademoiselle
Stangerson&mdash;the old stains belonged to other crimes,
probably dating years back.</p>

<p>It may be easily imagined that the crime engaged the attention
of the press throughout the world. No crime known had more
absorbed the minds of people. It appeared to me, however, that
the judicial inquiry was making but very little progress; and I
should have been very glad, if, on the receipt of my friend's
invitation to rejoin him at the Glandier, the despatch had not
contained the words, "Bring revolvers."</p>

<p>That puzzled me greatly. Rouletabille telegraphing for
revolvers meant that there might be occasion to use them. Now, I
confess it without shame, I am not a hero. But here was a friend,
evidently in danger, calling on me to go to his aid. I did not
hesitate long; and after assuring myself that the only revolver I
possessed was properly loaded, I hurried towards the Orleans
station. On the way I remembered that Rouletabille had asked for
two revolvers; I therefore entered a gunsmith's shop and bought
an excellent weapon for my friend.</p>

<p>I had hoped to find him at the station at Epinay; but he was
not there. However, a cab was waiting for me and I was soon at
the Glandier. Nobody was at the gate, and it was only on the
threshold of the château that I met the young man. He saluted me
with a friendly gesture and threw his arms about me, inquiring
warmly as to the state of my health.</p>

<p>When we were in the little sitting-room of which I have
spoken, Rouletabille made me sit down.</p>

<p>"It's going badly," he said.</p>

<p>"What's going badly?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Everything."</p>

<p>He came nearer to me and whispered:</p>

<p>"Frédéric Larsan is working with might and main against
Darzac."</p>

<p>This did not astonish me. I had seen the poor show
Mademoiselle Stangerson's fiancé had made at the time of the
examination of the footprints. However, I immediately
asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What about that cane?"</p>

<p>"It is still in the hands of Frédéric Larsan. He never lets go
of it."</p>

<p>"But doesn't it prove the <i>alibi</i> for Monsieur
Darzac?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. Gently questioned by me, Darzac denied having, on
that evening, or on any other, purchased a cane at Cassette's.
However," said Rouletabille, "I'll not swear to anything;
Monsieur Darzac has such strange fits of silence that one does
not know exactly what to think of what he says."</p>

<p>"To Frédéric Larsan this cane must mean a piece of very
damaging evidence. But in what way? The time when it was bought
shows it could not have been in the murderer's possession."</p>

<p>"The time doesn't worry Larsan. He is not obliged to adopt my
theory which assumes that the murderer got into The Yellow Room
between five and six o'clock. But there's nothing to prevent him
assuming that the murderer got in between ten and eleven o'clock
at night? At that hour Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson,
assisted by Daddy Jacques, were engaged in making an interesting
chemical experiment in the part of the laboratory taken up by the
furnaces. Larsan says, unlikely as that may seem, that the
murderer may have slipped behind them. He has already got the
examining magistrate to listen to him. When one looks closely
into it, the reasoning is absurd, seeing that the
'intimate'&mdash;if there is one&mdash;must have known that the
professor would shortly leave the pavilion, and that the 'friend'
had only to put off operating till after the professor's
departure. Why should he have risked crossing the laboratory
while the professor was in it? And then, when he had got into The
Yellow Room?&mdash;</p>

<p>"There are many points to be cleared up before Larsan's theory
can be admitted. I sha'n't waste my time over it, for my theory
won't allow me to occupy myself with mere imagination. Only, as I
am obliged for the moment to keep silent, and Larsan sometimes
talks, he may finish by coming out openly against Monsieur
Darzac,&mdash;if I'm not there," added the young reporter
proudly. "For there are surface evidences against Darzac, much
more convincing than the cane, which remains incomprehensible to
me, all the more so as Larsan does not in the least hesitate to
let Darzac see him with it!&mdash;I understand many things in
Larsan's theory, but I can't make anything of that cane."</p>

<p>"Is he still at the château?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he hardly ever quits it!&mdash;He sleeps there, as I do,
at the request of Monsieur Stangerson, who has done for him what
Monsieur Robert Darzac has done for me. In spite of the
accusation made by Larsan that Monsieur Stangerson knows who the
murderer is he yet affords him every facility for arriving at the
truth,&mdash;just as Darzac is doing for me."</p>

<p>"But you are convinced of Darzac's innocence?"</p>

<p>"At one time I did believe in the possibility of his guilt.
That was when we arrived here for the first time. The time has
come for me to tell you what has passed between Monsieur Darzac
and myself."</p>

<p>Here Rouletabille interrupted himself and asked me if I had
brought the revolvers. I showed him them. Having examined both,
he pronounced them excellent, and handed them back to me.</p>

<p>"Shall we have any use for them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No doubt; this evening. We shall pass the night here&mdash;if
that won't tire you?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," I said with an expression that made
Rouletabille laugh.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, "this is no time for laughing. You remember
the phrase which was the 'Open sesame' of this château full of
mystery?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "perfectly,&mdash;'The presbytery has lost
nothing of its charm, nor the garden its brightness.' It was the
phrase which you found on the half-burned piece of paper amongst
the ashes in the laboratory."</p>

<p>"Yes; at the bottom of the paper, where the flame had not
reached, was this date: 23rd of October. Remember this date, it
is highly important. I am now going to tell you about that
curious phrase. On the evening before the crime, that is to say,
on the 23rd, Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson were at a
reception at the Élysée. I know that, because I was there on
duty, having to interview one of the savants of the Academy of
Philadelphia, who was being fêted there. I had never before seen
either Monsieur or Mademoiselle Stangerson. I was seated in the
room which precedes the Salon des Ambassadeurs, and, tired of
being jostled by so many noble personages, I had fallen into a
vague reverie, when I scented near me the perfume of the lady in
black.</p>

<p>"Do you ask me what is the 'perfume of the lady in black'? It
must suffice you to know that it is a perfume of which I am very
fond, because it was that of a lady who had been very kind to me
in my childhood,&mdash;a lady whom I had always seen dressed in
black. The lady who, that evening, was scented with the perfume
of the lady in black, was dressed in white. She was wonderfully
beautiful. I could not help rising and following her. An old man
gave her his arm, and, as they passed, I heard voices say:
'Professor Stangerson and his daughter.' It was in that way I
learned who it was I was following.</p>

<p>"They met Monsieur Robert Darzac, whom I knew by sight.
Professor Stangerson, accosted by Mr. Arthur William Rance, one
of the American savants, seated himself in the great gallery, and
Monsieur Robert Darzac led Mademoiselle Stangerson into the
conservatory. I followed. The weather was very mild that evening;
the garden doors were open. Mademoiselle Stangerson threw a fichu
shawl over her shoulders and I plainly saw that it was she who
was begging Monsieur Darzac to go with her into the garden. I
continued to follow, interested by the agitation plainly
exhibited by the bearing of Monsieur Darzac. They slowly passed
along the wall abutting on the Avenue Marigny. I took the central
alley, walking parallel with them, and then crossed over for the
purpose of getting nearer to them. The night was dark, and the
grass deadened the sound of my steps. They had stopped under the
vacillating light of a gas jet and appeared to be both bending
over a paper held by Mademoiselle Stangerson, reading something
which deeply interested them. I stopped in the darkness and
silence.</p>

<p>"Neither of them saw me, and I distinctly heard Mademoiselle
Stangerson repeat, as she was refolding the paper: 'The
presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its
brightness!'&mdash;It was said in a tone at once mocking and
despairing, and was followed by a burst of such nervous laughter
that I think her words will never cease to sound in my ears. But
another phrase was uttered by Monsieur Robert Darzac: 'Must I
commit a crime, then, to win you?' He was in an extraordinarily
agitated state. He took the hand of Mademoiselle Stangerson and
held it for a long time to his lips, and I thought, from the
movement of his shoulders, that he was crying. Then they went
away.</p>

<p>"When I returned to the great gallery," continued
Rouletabille, "I saw no more of Monsieur Robert Darzac, and I was
not to see him again until after the tragedy at the Glandier.
Mademoiselle was near Mr. Rance, who was talking with much
animation, his eyes, during the conversation, glowing with a
singular brightness. Mademoiselle Stangerson, I thought, was not
even listening to what he was saying, her face expressing perfect
indifference. His face was the red face of a drunkard. When
Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson left, he went to the bar and
remained there. I joined him, and rendered him some little
service in the midst of the pressing crowd. He thanked me and
told me he was returning to America three days later, that is to
say, on the 26th (the day after the crime). I talked with him
about Philadelphia; he told me he had lived there for
five-and-twenty years, and that it was there he had met the
illustrious Professor Stangerson and his daughter. He drank a
great deal of champagne, and when I left him he was very nearly
drunk.</p>

<p>"Such were my experiences on that evening, and I leave you to
imagine what effect the news of the attempted murder of
Mademoiselle Stangerson produced on me,&mdash;with what force
those words pronounced by Monsieur Robert Darzac, 'Must I commit
a crime, then, to win you?' recurred to me. It was not this
phrase, however, that I repeated to him, when we met here at
Glandier. The sentence of the presbytery and the bright garden
sufficed to open the gate of the château. If you ask me if I
believe now that Monsieur Darzac is the murderer, I must say I do
not. I do not think I ever quite thought that. At the time I
could not really think seriously of anything. I had so little
evidence to go on. But I needed to have at once the proof that he
had not been wounded in the hand.</p>

<p>"When we were alone together, I told him how I had chanced to
overhear a part of his conversation with Mademoiselle Stangerson
in the garden of the Élysée; and when I repeated to him the
words, 'Must I commit a crime, then, to win you?' he was greatly
troubled, though much less so than he had been by hearing me
repeat the phrase about the presbytery. What threw him into a
state of real consternation was to learn from me that the day on
which he had gone to meet Mademoiselle Stangerson at the Élysée,
was the very day on which she had gone to the Post Office for the
letter. It was that letter, perhaps, which ended with the words:
'The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its
brightness.' My surmise was confirmed by my finding, if you
remember, in the ashes of the laboratory, the fragment of paper
dated October the 23rd. The letter had been written and withdrawn
from the Post Office on the same day.</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt that, on returning from the Élysée that
night, Mademoiselle Stangerson had tried to destroy that
compromising paper. It was in vain that Monsieur Darzac denied
that that letter had anything whatever to do with the crime. I
told him that in an affair so filled with mystery as this, he had
no right to hide this letter; that I was persuaded it was of
considerable importance; that the desperate tone in which
Mademoiselle Stangerson had pronounced the prophetic
phrase,&mdash;that his own tears, and the threat of a crime which
he had professed after the letter was read&mdash;all these facts
tended to leave no room for me to doubt. Monsieur Darzac became
more and more agitated, and I determined to take advantage of the
effect I had produced on him. 'You were on the point of being
married, Monsieur,' I said negligently and without looking at
him, 'and suddenly your marriage becomes impossible because of
the writer of that letter; because as soon as his letter was
read, you spoke of the necessity for a crime to win Mademoiselle
Stangerson. Therefore there is someone between you and
her&mdash;someone who is preventing your marriage with
her&mdash;someone who has attempted to kill her, so that she
should not be able to marry!' And I concluded with these words:
'Now, monsieur, you have only to tell me in confidence the name
of the murderer!'&mdash;The words I had uttered must have struck
him ominously, for when I turned my eyes on him, I saw that his
face was haggard, the perspiration standing on his forehead, and
terror showing in his eyes.</p>

<p>"'Monsieur,' he said to me, 'I am going to ask of you
something which may appear insane, but in exchange for which I
place my life in your hands. You must not tell the magistrates of
what you saw and heard in the garden of the Élysée,&mdash;neither
to them nor to anybody. I swear to you, that I am innocent, and I
know, I feel, that you believe me; but I would rather be taken
for the guilty man than see justice go astray on that phrase,
"The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its
brightness." The judges must know nothing about that phrase. All
this matter is in your hands. Monsieur, I leave it there; but
forget the evening at the Élysée. A hundred other roads are open
to you in your search for the criminal. I will open them for you
myself. I will help you. Will you take up your quarters
here?&mdash;You may remain here to do as you
please.&mdash;Eat&mdash;sleep here&mdash;watch my
actions&mdash;the actions of all here. You shall be master of the
Glandier, Monsieur; but forget the evening at the Élysée.'"</p>

<p>Rouletabille here paused to take breath. I now understood what
had appeared so unexplainable in the demeanour of Monsieur Robert
Darzac towards my friend, and the facility with which the young
reporter had been able to instal himself on the scene of the
crime. My curiosity could not fail to be excited by all I had
heard. I asked Rouletabille to satisfy it still further. What had
happened at the Glandier during the past week?&mdash;Had he not
told me that there were surface indications against Monsieur
Darzac much more terrible than that of the cane found by
Larsan?</p>

<p>"Everything seems to be pointing against him," replied my
friend, "and the situation is becoming exceedingly grave.
Monsieur Darzac appears not to mind it much; but in that he is
wrong. I was interested only in the health of Mademoiselle
Stangerson, which was daily improving, when something occurred
that is even more mysterious than&mdash;than the mystery of The
Yellow Room!"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" I cried, "What could be more mysterious than
<i>that?</i>"</p>

<p>"Let us first go back to Monsieur Robert Darzac," said
Rouletabille, calming me. "I have said that everything seems to
be pointing against him. The marks of the neat boots found by
Frédéric Larsan appear to be really the footprints of
Mademoiselle Stangerson's fiancé. The marks made by the bicycle
may have been made by <i>his</i> bicycle. He had usually left it
at the château; why did he take it to Paris on that particular
occasion? Was it because he was not going to return again to the
château? Was it because, owing to the breaking off of his
marriage, his relations with the Stangersons were to cease? All
who are interested in the matter affirm that those relations were
to continue unchanged.</p>

<p>"Frédéric Larsan, however, believes that all intercourse was
at an end. From the day when Monsieur Darzac accompanied
Mademoiselle Stangerson to the Grands Magasins de la Louvre until
the day after the crime, he had not been at the Glandier.
Remember that Mademoiselle Stangerson lost her reticule
containing the key with the brass head while she was in his
company. From that day to the evening at the Élysée, the Sorbonne
professor and Mademoiselle Stangerson did not see one another;
but they may have written to each other. Mademoiselle Stangerson
went to the Post Office to get a letter, which Larsan says was
written by Robert Darzac; for knowing nothing of what had passed
at the Élysée, Larsan believes that it was Monsieur Darzac
himself who stole the reticule with the key, with the design of
forcing her consent, by getting possession of the precious papers
of her father&mdash;papers which he would have restored to him on
condition that the marriage engagement was to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>"All that would have been a very doubtful and almost absurd
hypothesis, as Larsan admitted to me, but for another and much
graver circumstance. In the first place here is something which I
have not been able to explain&mdash;Monsieur Darzac had himself,
on the 24th, gone to the Post Office to ask for the letter which
Mademoiselle had called for and received on the previous evening.
The description of the man who made application tallies in every
respect with the appearance of Monsieur Darzac, who, in answer to
the questions put to him by the examining magistrate, denies that
he went to the Post Office. Now even admitting that the letter
was written by him&mdash;which I do not believe&mdash;he knew
that Mademoiselle Stangerson had received it, since he had seen
it in her hands in the garden at the Élysée. It could not have
been he, then, who had gone to the Post Office, the day after the
24th, to ask for a letter which he knew was no longer there.</p>

<p>"To me it appears clear that somebody, strongly resembling
him, stole Mademoiselle Stangerson's reticule and in that letter,
had demanded of her something which she had not sent him. He must
have been surprised at the failure of his demand, hence his
application at the Post Office, to learn whether his letter had
been delivered to the person to whom it had been addressed.
Finding that it had been claimed, he had become furious. What had
he demanded? Nobody but Mademoiselle Stangerson knows. Then, on
the day following, it is reported that she had been murdered
during the night, and, the next day, I discovered that the
Professor had, at the same time, been robbed by means of the key
referred to in the poste restante letter. It would seem, then,
that the man who went to the Post Office to inquire for the
letter must have been the murderer. All these arguments Larsan
applies as against Monsieur Darzac. You may be sure that the
examining magistrate, Larsan, and myself, have done our best to
get from the Post Office precise details relative to the singular
personage who applied there on the 24th of October. But nothing
has been learned. We don't know where he came from&mdash;or where
he went. Beyond the description which makes him resemble Monsieur
Darzac, we know nothing.</p>

<p>"I have announced in the leading journals that a handsome
reward will be given to a driver of any public conveyance who
drove a fare to No. 40, Post Office, about ten o'clock on the
morning of the 24th of October. Information to be addressed to
'M.R.,' at the office of the 'Epoque'; but no answer has
resulted. The man may have walked; but, as he was most likely in
a hurry, there was a chance that he might have gone in a cab.
Who, I keep asking myself night and day, is the man who so
strongly resembles Monsieur Robert Darzac, and who is also known
to have bought the cane which has fallen into Larsan's hands.</p>

<p>"The most serious fact is that Monsieur Darzac was, at the
very same time that his double presented himself at the Post
Office, down for a lecture at the Sorbonne. He had not delivered
that lecture, and one of his friends took his place. When I
questioned him as to how he had employed the time, he told me
that he had gone for a stroll in the Bois de Boulogne. What do
you think of a professor who, instead of giving his lecture,
obtains a substitute to go for a stroll in the Bois de Boulogne?
When Frédéric Larsan asked him for information on this point, he
quietly replied that it was no business of his how he spent his
time in Paris. On which Fred swore aloud that he would find out,
without anybody's help.</p>

<p>"All this seems to fit in with Fred's hypothesis, namely, that
Monsieur Stangerson allowed the murderer to escape in order to
avoid a scandal. The hypothesis is further substantiated by the
fact that Darzac was in The Yellow Room and was permitted to get
away. That hypothesis I believe to be a false one.&mdash;Larsan
is being misled by it, though that would not displease me, did it
not affect an innocent person. Now does that hypothesis
<i>really</i> mislead Frédéric Larsan? That is the
question&mdash;that is the question."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is right," I cried, interrupting Rouletabille.
"Are you sure that Monsieur Darzac is innocent?&mdash;It seems to
me that these are extraordinary coincidences&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Coincidences," replied my friend, "are the worst enemies to
truth."</p>

<p>"What does the examining magistrate think now of the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Marquet hesitates to accuse Monsieur Darzac, in
the absence of absolute proofs. Not only would he have public
opinion wholly against him, to say nothing of the Sorbonne, but
Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson. She adores Monsieur Robert
Darzac. Indistinctly as she saw the murderer, it would be hard to
make the public believe that she could not have recognised him,
if Darzac had been the criminal. No doubt The Yellow Room was
very dimly lit; but a night-light, however small, gives some
light. Here, my boy, is how things stood when, three days, or
rather three nights ago, an extraordinarily strange incident
occurred."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>"I Expect The Assassin This Evening."</h3>
<hr>

<p class="first">
"I MUST take you," said Rouletabille, "so as to enable you to
understand, to the various scenes. I myself believe that I have
discovered what everybody else is searching for, namely, how the
murderer escaped from The Yellow Room, without any accomplice,
and without Mademoiselle Stangerson having had anything to do
with it. But so long as I am not sure of the real murderer, I
cannot state the theory on which I am working. I can only say
that I believe it to be correct and, in any case, a quite natural
and simple one. As to what happened in this place three nights
ago, I must say it kept me wondering for a whole day and a night.
It passes all belief. The theory I have formed from the incident
is so absurd that I would rather matters remained as yet
unexplained."</p>

<p>Saying which the young reporter invited me to go and make the
tour of the château with him. The only sound to be heard was the
crunching of the dead leaves beneath our feet. The silence was so
intense that one might have thought the château had been
abandoned. The old stones, the stagnant water of the ditch
surrounding the donjon, the bleak ground strewn with the dead
leaves, the dark, skeleton-like outlines of the trees, all
contributed to give to the desolate place, now filled with its
awful mystery, an aspect the most funereal. As we passed round
the donjon, we met the Green Man, the forest-keeper, who did not
greet us, but walked by as if we had not existed. He was looking
just as I had formerly seen him through the window of the Donjon
Inn. He had still his fowling-piece slung at his back, his pipe
was in his mouth, and his eye-glasses on his nose.</p>

<p>"An odd kind of fish!" Rouletabille said to me, in a low
tone.</p>

<p>"Have you spoken to him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I could get nothing out of him. His only answers are
grunts and shrugs of the shoulders. He generally lives on the
first floor of the donjon,&mdash;a big room that once served for
an oratory. He lives like a bear, never goes out without his gun,
and is only pleasant with the girls. The women, for twelve miles
round, are all setting their caps at him. For the present, he is
paying attention to Madame Mathieu, whose husband is keeping a
lynx eye upon her in consequence."</p>

<p>After passing the donjon, which is situated at the extreme end
of the left wing, we went to the back of the château.
Rouletabille, pointing to a window which I recognised as the only
one belonging to Mademoiselle Stangerson's apartment, said to
me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you had been here, two nights ago, you would have seen
your humble servant at the top of a ladder, about to enter the
château by that window."</p>

<p>As I expressed some surprise at this piece of nocturnal
gymnastics, he begged me to notice carefully the exterior
disposition of the château. We then went back into the
building.</p>

<p>"I must now show you the first floor of the château, where I
am living," said my friend.</p>

<p>To enable the reader the better to understand the disposition
of these parts of the dwelling, I annex a plan of the first floor
of the right wing, drawn by Rouletabille the day after the
extraordinary phenomenon occurred, the details of which I am
about to relate.</p>

<p><br>
Rouletabille motioned me to follow him up a magnificent flight
of stairs ending in a landing on the first floor. From this
landing one could pass to the right or left wing of the château
by a gallery opening from it. This gallery, high and wide,
extended along the whole length of the building and was lit from
the front of the château facing the north. The rooms, the windows
of which looked to the south, opened out of the gallery.
Professor Stangerson inhabited the left wing of the building.
Mademoiselle Stangerson had her apartment in the right wing.</p>

<p>We entered the gallery to the right. A narrow carpet, laid on
the waxed oaken floor, which shone like glass, deadened the sound
of our footsteps. Rouletabille asked me, in a low tone, to walk
carefully, as we were passing the door of Mademoiselle
Stangerson's apartment. This consisted of a bed-room, an
ante-room, a small bath-room, a boudoir, and a drawing-room. One
could pass from one to another of these rooms without having to
go by way of the gallery. The gallery continued straight to the
western end of the building, where it was lit by a high window
(window 2 on the plan). At about two-thirds of its length this
gallery, at a right angle, joined another gallery following the
course of the right wing.</p>

<p>The better to follow this narrative, we shall call the gallery
leading from the stairs to the eastern window, the "right"
gallery and the gallery quitting it at a right angle, the
"off-turning" gallery (winding gallery in the plan). It was at
the meeting point of the two galleries that Rouletabille had his
chamber, adjoining that of Frédéric Larsan, the door of each
opening on to the "off-turning" gallery, while the doors of
Mademoiselle Stangerson's apartment opened into the "right"
gallery. (See the Plan.)</p>

<p>Rouletabille opened the door of his room and after we had
passed in, carefully drew the bolt. I had not had time to glance
round the place in which he had been installed, when he uttered a
cry of surprise and pointed to a pair of eye-glasses on a
side-table.</p>

<p>"What are these doing here?" he asked.</p>

<p>I should have been puzzled to answer him.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he said, "I wonder if this is what I have been
searching for. I wonder if these are the eye-glasses from the
presbytery!"</p>

<p>He seized them eagerly, his fingers caressing the glass. Then
looking at me, with an expression of terror on his face, he
murmured, "Oh!&mdash;Oh!"</p>

<p>He repeated the exclamation again and again, as if his
thoughts had suddenly turned his brain.</p>

<p>He rose and, putting his hand on my shoulder, laughed like one
demented as he said:</p>

<p>"Those glasses will drive me silly! Mathematically speaking
the thing is possible; but humanly speaking it is
impossible&mdash;or afterwards&mdash;or afterwards&mdash;"</p>

<p>Two light knocks struck the door. Rouletabille opened it. A
figure entered. I recognised the concierge, whom I had seen when
she was being taken to the pavilion for examination. I was
surprised, thinking she was still under lock and key. This woman
said in a very low tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the grove of the <i>parquet</i>."</p>

<p>Rouletabille replied: "Thanks."&mdash;The woman then left. He
again turned to me, his look haggard, after having carefully
refastened the door, muttering some incomprehensible phrases.</p>

<p>"If the thing is mathematically possible, why should it not be
humanly!&mdash;And if it is humanly possible, the matter is
simply awful."</p>

<p>I interrupted him in his soliloquy:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have they set the concierges at liberty, then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "I had them liberated. I needed people I
could trust. The woman is thoroughly devoted to me, and her
husband would lay down his life for me."</p>

<p>"Oho!" I said, "when will he have occasion to do it?"</p>

<p>"This evening,&mdash;for this evening I expect the
murderer."</p>

<p>"You expect the murderer this evening? Then you know him?"</p>

<p>"I <i>shall</i> know him; but I should be mad to affirm,
categorically, at this moment that I do know him. The
mathematical idea I have of the murderer gives results so
frightful, so monstrous, that I hope it is still possible that I
am mistaken. I hope so, with all my heart!"</p>

<p>"Five minutes ago, you did not know the murderer; how can you
say that you expect him this evening?"</p>

<p>"Because I know that he must come."</p>

<p>Rouletabille very slowly filled his pipe and lit it. That
meant an interesting story. At that moment we heard some one
walking in the gallery and passing before our door. Rouletabille
listened. The sound of the footstep died away in the
distance.</p>

<p>"Is Frédéric Larsan in his room?" I asked, pointing to the
partition.</p>

<p>"No," my friend answered. "He went to Paris this
morning,&mdash;still on the scent of Darzac, who also left for
Paris. That matter will turn out badly. I expect that Monsieur
Darzac will be arrested in the course of the next week. The worst
of it is that everything seems to be in league against
him,&mdash;circumstances, things, people. Not an hour passes
without bringing some new evidence against him. The examining
magistrate is overwhelmed by it&mdash;and blind."</p>

<p>"Frédéric Larsan, however, is not a novice," I said.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Rouletabille, with a slightly
contemptuous turn of his lips, "I fancied he was a much abler
man. I had, indeed, a great admiration for him, before I got to
know his method of working. It's deplorable. He owes his
reputation solely to his ability; but he lacks reasoning
power,&mdash;the mathematics of his ideas are very poor."</p>

<p>I looked closely at Rouletabille and could not help smiling,
on hearing this boy of eighteen talking of a man who had proved
to the world that he was the finest police sleuth-hound in
Europe.</p>

<p>"You smile," he said; "you are wrong! I swear I will outwit
him&mdash;and in a striking way! But I must make haste about it,
for he has an enormous start of me&mdash;given him by Monsieur
Robert Darzac, who is this evening going to increase it still
more. Think of it!&mdash;every time the murderer comes to the
château, Monsieur Darzac, by a strange fatality, absents himself
and refuses to give any account of how he employs his time."</p>

<p>"Every time the assassin comes to the château!" I cried. "Has
he returned then&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes, during that famous night when the strange phenomenon
occurred."</p>

<p>I was now going to learn about the astonishing phenomenon to
which Rouletabille had made allusion half an hour earlier without
giving me any explanation of it. But I had learned never to press
Rouletabille in his narratives. He spoke when the fancy took him
and when he judged it to be right. He was less concerned about my
curiosity than he was for making a complete summing up for
himself of any important matter in which he was interested.</p>

<p>At last, in short rapid phrases, he acquainted me with things
which plunged me into a state bordering on complete bewilderment.
Indeed, the results of that still unknown science known as
hypnotism, for example, were not more inexplicable than the
disappearance of the matter of the murderer at the moment when
four persons were within touch of him. I speak of hypnotism as I
would of electricity, for of the nature of both we are ignorant
and we know little of their laws. I cite these examples because,
at the time, the case appeared to me to be only explicable by the
inexplicable,&mdash;that is to say, by an event outside of known
natural laws. And yet, if I had had Rouletabille's brain, I
should, like him, have had a presentiment of the natural
explanation; for the most curious thing about all the mysteries
of the Glandier case was the natural manner in which he explained
them.</p>

<p>I have among the papers that were sent me by the young man,
after the affair was over, a note-book of his, in which a
complete account is given of the phenomenon of the disappearance
of the "matter" of the assassin, and the thoughts to which it
gave rise in the mind of my young friend. It is preferable, I
think, to give the reader this account, rather than continue to
reproduce my conversation with Rouletabille; for I should be
afraid, in a history of this nature, to add a word that was not
in accordance with the strictest truth.</p>

<h3>The Trap.</h3>

<h3>(Extract from the Note-Book of Joseph Rouletabille)</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
"LAST night&mdash;the night between the 29th and 30th of
October&mdash;" wrote Joseph Rouletabille, "I woke up towards one
o'clock in the morning. Was it sleeplessness, or noise
without?&mdash;The cry of the <i>Bête du Bon Dieu</i> rang out
with sinister loudness from the end of the park. I rose and
opened the window. Cold wind and rain; opaque darkness; silence.
I reclosed my window. Again the sound of the cat's weird cry in
the distance. I partly dressed in haste. The weather was too bad
for even a cat to be turned out in it. What did it mean,
then&mdash;that imitating of the mewing of Mother Angenoux' cat
so near the château? I seized a good-sized stick, the only weapon
I had, and, without making any noise, opened my door.</p>

<p>"The gallery into which I went was well lit by a lamp with a
reflector. I felt a keen current of air and, on turning, found
the window open, at the extreme end of the gallery, which I call
the 'off-turning' gallery, to distinguish it from the 'right'
gallery, on to which the apartment of Mademoiselle Stangerson
opened. These two galleries cross each other at right angles. Who
had left that window open? Or, who had come to open it? I went to
the window and leaned out. Five feet below me there was a sort of
terrace over the semi-circular projection of a room on the
ground-floor. One could, if one wanted, jump from the window on
to the terrace, and allow oneself to drop from it into the court
of the château. Whoever had entered by this road had, evidently,
not had a key to the vestibule-door. But why should I be thinking
of my previous night's attempt with the ladder?&mdash;Because of
the open window&mdash;left open, perhaps, by the negligence of a
servant? I reclosed it, smiling at the ease with which I built a
drama on the mere suggestion of an open window.</p>

<p>"Again the cry of the <i>Bête du Bon Dieu!</i>&mdash;and then
silence. The rain ceased to beat on the window. All in the
château slept. I walked with infinite precaution on the carpet of
the gallery. On reaching the corner of the 'right' gallery, I
peered round it cautiously. There was another lamp there with a
reflector which quite lit up the several objects in
it,&mdash;three chairs and some pictures hanging on the wall.
What was I doing there? Perfect silence reigned throughout.
Everything was sunk in repose. What was the instinct that urged
me towards Mademoiselle Stangerson's chamber? Why did a voice
within me cry: 'Go on, to the chamber of Mademoiselle
Stangerson!' I cast my eyes down upon the carpet on which I was
treading and saw that my steps were being directed towards
Mademoiselle Stangerson's chamber by the marks of steps that had
already been made there. Yes, on the carpet were traces of
footsteps stained with mud leading to the chamber of Mademoiselle
Stangerson. Horror! Horror!&mdash;I recognised in those
footprints the impression of the neat boots of the murderer! He
had come, then, from without in this wretched night. If you could
descend from the gallery by way of the window, by means of the
terrace, then you could get into the château by the same
means.</p>

<p>"The murderer was still in the château, for here were marks as
of returning footsteps. He had entered by the open window at the
extremity of the 'off-turning' gallery; he had passed Frédéric
Larsan's door and mine, had turned to the right, and had entered
Mademoiselle Stangerson's room. I am before the door of her
ante-room&mdash;it is open. I push it, without making the least
noise. Under the door of the room itself I see a streak of light.
I listen&mdash;no sound&mdash;not even of breathing! Ah!&mdash;if
I only knew what was passing in the silence that is behind that
door! I find the door locked and the key turned on the inner
side. And the murderer is there, perhaps. He <i>must</i> be
there! Will he escape this time?&mdash;All depends on me!&mdash;I
must be calm, and above all, I must make no false steps. I must
see into that room. I can enter it by Mademoiselle Stangerson's
drawing-room; but, to do that I should have to cross her boudoir;
and while I am there, the murderer may escape by the gallery
door&mdash;the door in front of which I am now standing.</p>

<p>"I am sure that no other crime is being committed, on this
night; for there is complete silence in the boudoir, where two
nurses are taking care of Mademoiselle Stangerson until she is
restored to health.</p>

<p>"As I am almost sure that the murderer is there, why do I not
at once give the alarm? The murderer may, perhaps, escape; but,
perhaps, I may be able to save Mademoiselle Stangerson's life.
Suppose the murderer on this occasion is not here to murder? The
door has been opened to allow him to enter; by whom?&mdash;And it
has been refastened&mdash;by whom?&mdash;Mademoiselle Stangerson
shuts herself up in her apartment with her nurses every night.
Who turned the key of that chamber to allow the murderer to
enter?&mdash;The nurses,&mdash;two faithful domestics? The old
chambermaid, Sylvia? It is very improbable. Besides, they slept
in the boudoir, and Mademoiselle Stangerson, very nervous and
careful, Monsieur Robert Darzac told me, sees to her own safety
since she has been well enough to move about in her room, which I
have not yet seen her leave. This nervousness and sudden care on
her part, which had struck Monsieur Darzac, had given me, also,
food for thought. At the time of the crime in The Yellow Room,
there can be no doubt that she expected the murderer. Was he
expected <i>this</i> night?&mdash;Was it she herself who had
opened her door to him? Had she some reason for doing so? was she
<i>obliged</i> to do it?&mdash;Was it a meeting for purposes of
crime?&mdash;Certainly it was not a lover's meeting, for I
believe Mademoiselle Stangerson adores Monsieur Darzac.</p>

<p>"All these reflections ran through my brain like a flash of
lightning. What would I not give to <i>know!</i></p>

<p>"It is possible that there was some reason for the awful
silence. My intervention might do more harm than good. How could
I tell? How could I know I might not any moment cause another
crime? If I could only see and know, without breaking that
silence!</p>

<p>"I left the ante-room and descended the central stairs to the
vestibule and, as silently as possible, made my way to the little
room on the ground-floor where Daddy Jacques had been sleeping
since the attack made at the pavilion.</p>

<p>"I found him dressed, his eyes wide open, almost haggard. He
did not seem surprised to see me. He told me that he had got up
because he had heard the cry of the <i>Bête du bon Dieu</i>, and
because he had heard footsteps in the park, close to his window,
out of which he had looked and, just then, had seen a black
shadow pass by. I asked him whether he had a firearm of any kind.
No, he no longer kept one, since the examining magistrate had
taken his revolver from him. We went out together, by a little
back door, into the park, and stole along the château to the
point which is just below Mademoiselle Stangerson's window.</p>

<p>"I placed Daddy Jacques against the wall, ordering him not to
stir from the spot, while I, taking advantage of a moment when
the moon was hidden by a cloud, moved to the front of the window,
out of the patch of light which came from it,&mdash;for the
window was half-open! If I could only know what was passing in
that silent chamber! I returned to Daddy Jacques and whispered
the word 'ladder' in his ear. At first I had thought of the tree
which, a week ago, served me for an observatory; but I
immediately saw that, from the way the window was half-opened, I
should not be able to see from that point of view anything that
was passing in the room; and I wanted, not only to see, but to
hear, and&mdash;to act.</p>

<p>"Greatly agitated, almost trembling, Daddy Jacques disappeared
for a moment and returned without the ladder, but making signs to
me with his arms, as signals to me to come quickly to him. When I
got near him he gasped: 'Come!'</p>

<p>"He led me round the château, past the donjon. Arrived there,
he said:</p>

<p>"'I went to the donjon in search of my ladder, and in the
lower part of the donjon which serves me and the gardener for a
lumber room, I found the door open and the ladder gone. On coming
out, that's what I caught sight of by the light of the moon.'</p>

<p>"And he pointed to the further end of the château, where a
ladder stood resting against the stone brackets supporting the
terrace, under the window which I had found open. The projection
of the terrace had prevented my seeing it. Thanks to that ladder,
it was quite easy to get into the 'off-turning' gallery of the
first floor, and I had no doubt of it having been the road taken
by the unknown.</p>

<p>"We ran to the ladder, but at the moment of reaching it, Daddy
Jacques drew my attention to the half-open door of the little
semi-circular room, situated under the terrace, at the extremity
of the right wing of the château, having the terrace for its
roof. Daddy Jacques pushed the door open a little further and
looked in.</p>

<p>"'He's not there!' he whispered.</p>

<p>"'Who is not there?'</p>

<p>"'The forest-keeper.'</p>

<p>"With his lips once more to my ear, he added:</p>

<p>"'Do you know that he has slept in the upper room of the
donjon ever since it was restored?' And with the same gesture he
pointed to the half-open door, the ladder, the terrace, and the
windows in the 'off-turning' gallery which, a little while
before, I had re-closed.</p>

<p>"What were my thoughts then? I had no time to think. I
<i>felt</i> more than I thought.</p>

<p>"Evidently, I felt, if the forest-keeper is up there in the
chamber (I say, <i>if</i>, because at this moment, apart from the
presence of the ladder and his vacant room, there are no
evidences which permit me even to suspect him)&mdash;if he is
there, he has been obliged to pass by the ladder, and the rooms
which lie behind his, in his new lodging, are occupied by the
family of the steward and by the cook, and by the kitchens, which
bar the way by the vestibule to the interior of the château. And
if he had been there during the evening on any pretext, it would
have been easy for him to go into the gallery and see that the
window could be simply pushed open from the outside. This
question of the unfastened window easily narrowed the field of
search for the murderer. He must belong to the house, unless he
had an accomplice, which I do not believe he had;
unless&mdash;unless Mademoiselle Stangerson herself had seen that
that window was not fastened from the inside. But,
then,&mdash;what could be the frightful secret which made her
under the necessity of doing away with obstacles that separated
her from the murderer?</p>

<p>"I seized hold of the ladder, and we returned to the back of
the château to see if the window of the chamber was still
half-open. The blind was drawn but did not join and allowed a
bright stream of light to escape and fall upon the path at our
feet. I planted the ladder under the window. I am almost sure
that I made no noise; and while Daddy Jacques remained at the
foot of the ladder, I mounted it, very quietly, my stout stick in
my hand. I held my breath and lifted my feet with the greatest
care. Suddenly a heavy cloud discharged itself at that moment in
a fresh downpour of rain.</p>

<p>"At the same instant the sinister cry of the <i>Bête du bon
Dieu</i> arrested me in my ascent. It seemed to me to have come
from close by me&mdash;only a few yards away. Was the cry a
signal?&mdash;Had some accomplice of the man seen me on the
ladder!&mdash;Would the cry bring the man to the
window?&mdash;Perhaps! Ah, there he was at the window! I felt his
head above me. I heard the sound of his breath! I could not look
up towards him; the least movement of my head, and&mdash;I might
be lost. Would he see me?&mdash;Would he peer into the darkness?
No; he went away. He had seen nothing. I felt, rather than heard,
him moving on tip-toe in the room; and I mounted a few steps
higher. My head reached to the level of the window-sill; my
forehead rose above it; my eyes looked between the opening in the
blinds&mdash;and I saw&mdash;</p>

<p>"A man seated at Mademoiselle Stangerson's little desk,
writing. His back was turned toward me. A candle was lit before
him, and he bent over the flame, the light from it projecting
shapeless shadows. I saw nothing but a monstrous, stooping
back.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Stangerson herself was not there!&mdash;Her bed
had not been lain on! Where, then, was she sleeping that night?
Doubtless in the side-room with her women. Perhaps this was but a
guess. I must content myself with the joy of finding the man
alone. I must be calm to prepare my trap.</p>

<p>"But who, then, is this man writing there before my eyes,
seated at the desk, as if he were in his own home? If there had
not been that ladder under the window; if there had not been
those footprints on the carpet in the gallery; if there had not
been that open window, I might have been led to think that this
man had a right to be there, and that he was there as a matter of
course and for reasons about which as yet I knew nothing. But
there was no doubt that this mysterious unknown was the man of
The Yellow Room,&mdash;the man to whose murderous assault
Mademoiselle Stangerson&mdash;without denouncing him&mdash;had
had to submit. If I could but see his face! Surprise and capture
him!</p>

<p>"If I spring into the room at this moment, he will escape by
the right-hand door opening into the boudoir,&mdash;or crossing
the drawing-room, he will reach the gallery and I shall lose him.
I have him now and in five minutes more he'll be safer than if I
had him in a cage.&mdash;What is he doing there, alone in
Mademoiselle Stangerson's room?&mdash;What is he writing? I
descend and place the ladder on the ground. Daddy Jacques follows
me. We re-enter the château. I send Daddy Jacques to wake
Monsieur Stangerson, and instruct him to await my coming in
Mademoiselle Stangerson's room and to say nothing definite to him
before my arrival. I will go and awaken Frédéric Larsan. It's a
bore to have to do it, for I should have liked to work alone and
to have carried off all the honors of this affair myself, right
under the very nose of the sleeping detective. But Daddy Jacques
and Monsieur Stangerson are old men, and I am not yet fully
developed. I might not be strong enough. Larsan is used to
wrestling and putting on the handcuffs. He opened his eyes
swollen with sleep, ready to send me flying, without in the least
believing in my reporter's fancies. I had to assure him that
<i>the man</i> was there!</p>

<p>"'That's strange!' he said; 'I thought I left him this
afternoon in Paris.'</p>

<p>"He dressed himself in haste and armed himself with a
revolver. We stole quietly into the gallery.</p>

<p>"'Where is he?' Larsan asked.</p>

<p>"'In Mademoiselle Stangerson's room.'</p>

<p>"'And&mdash;Mademoiselle Stangerson?'</p>

<p>"'She is not in there.'</p>

<p>"'Let's go in.'</p>

<p>"'Don't go there! On the least alarm the man will escape. He
has four ways by which to do it&mdash;the door, the window, the
boudoir, or the room in which the women are sleeping.'</p>

<p>"'I'll draw him from below.'</p>

<p>"'And if you fail?&mdash;If you only succeed in wounding
him&mdash;he'll escape again, without reckoning that he is
certainly armed. No, let me direct the expedition, and I'll
answer for everything.'</p>

<p>"'As you like,' he replied, with fairly good grace.</p>

<p>"Then, after satisfying myself that all the windows of the two
galleries were thoroughly secure, I placed Frédéric Larsan at the
end of the 'off-turning' gallery, before the window which I had
found open and had reclosed.</p>

<p>"'Under no consideration,' I said to him, 'must you stir from
this post till I call you. The chances are even that the man,
when he is pursued, will return to this window and try to save
himself that way; for it is by that way he came in and made a way
ready for his flight. You have a dangerous post.'</p>

<p>"'What will be yours?' asked Fred.</p>

<p>"'I shall spring into the room and knock him over for
you.'</p>

<p>"'Take my revolver,' said Fred, 'and I'll take your
stick.'</p>

<p>"'Thanks,' I said; 'You are a brave man.'</p>

<p>"I accepted his offer. I was going to be alone with the man in
the room writing and was really thankful to have the weapon.</p>

<p>"I left Fred, having posted him at the window (No. 5 on the
plan), and, with the greatest precaution, went towards Monsieur
Stangerson's apartment in the left wing of the château. I found
him with Daddy Jacques, who had faithfully obeyed my directions,
confining himself to asking his master to dress as quickly as
possible. In a few words I explained to Monsieur Stangerson what
was passing. He armed himself with a revolver, followed me, and
we were all three speedily in the gallery. Since I had seen the
murderer seated at the desk ten minutes had elapsed. Monsieur
Stangerson wished to spring upon the assassin at once and kill
him. I made him understand that, above all, he must not, in his
desire to kill him, miss him.</p>

<p>"When I had sworn to him that his daughter was not in the
room, and in no danger, he conquered his impatience and left me
to direct the operations. I told them that they must come to me
the moment I called to them, or when I fired my revolver. I then
sent Daddy Jacques to place himself before the window at the end
of the 'right' gallery. (No. 2 on my plan.) I chose that position
for Daddy Jacques because I believed that the murderer, tracked,
on leaving the room, would run through the gallery towards the
window which he had left open, and, instantly seeing that it was
guarded by Larsan, would pursue his course along the 'right'
gallery. There he would encounter Daddy Jacques, who would
prevent his springing out of the window into the park. Under that
window there was a sort of buttress, while all the other windows
in the galleries were at such a height from the ground that it
was almost impossible to jump from them without breaking one's
neck. All the doors and windows, including those of the
lumber-room at the end of the 'right' gallery&mdash;as I had
rapidly assured myself&mdash;were strongly secured.</p>

<p>"Having indicated to Daddy Jacques the post he was to occupy,
and having seen him take up his position, I placed Monsieur
Stangerson on the landing at the head of the stairs not far from
the door of his daughter's ante-room. Everything led me to
suppose that when I surprised the murderer in the room, he would
run by way of the ante-room, rather than the boudoir, where the
women were, and of which the door must have been locked by
Mademoiselle Stangerson herself if, as I thought, she had taken
refuge in the boudoir for the purpose of avoiding the murderer
who was coming to see her. In any case, he must return to the
gallery where my people were awaiting him at every possible
issue.</p>

<p>"On coming there, he would see on his left, Monsieur
Stangerson; he would turn to the right, towards the 'off-turning'
gallery&mdash;the way he had pre-arranged for flight, where, at
the intersection of the two galleries, he would see at once, as I
have explained, on his left, Frédéric Larsan at the end of the
'off-turning' gallery, and in front, Daddy Jacques, at the end of
the 'right' gallery. Monsieur Stangerson and myself would arrive
by way of the back of the château.&mdash;He is ours!&mdash;He can
no longer escape us! I was sure of that.</p>

<p>"The plan I had formed seemed to me the best, the surest, and
the most simple. It would, no doubt, have been simpler still, if
we had been able to place some one directly behind the door of
Mademoiselle's boudoir, which opened out of her bedchamber, and,
in that way, had been in a position to besiege the two doors of
the room in which the man was. But we could not penetrate the
boudoir except by way of the drawing-room, the door of which had
been locked on the inside by Mademoiselle Stangerson. But even if
I had had the free disposition of the boudoir, I should have held
to the plan I had formed; because any other plan of attack would
have separated us at the moment of the struggle with the man,
while my plan united us all for the attack, at a spot which I had
selected with almost mathematical precision,&mdash;the
intersection of the two galleries.</p>

<p>"Having so placed my people, I again left the château, hurried
to my ladder, and, replacing it, climbed up, revolver in
hand.</p>

<p>"If there be any inclined to smile at my taking so many
precautionary measures, I refer them to the mystery of The Yellow
Room, and to all the proofs we have of the weird cunning of the
murderer. Further, if there be some who think my observations
needlessly minute at a moment when they ought to be completely
held by rapidity of movement and decision of action, I reply that
I have wished to report here, at length and completely, all the
details of a plan of attack conceived so rapidly that it is only
the slowness of my pen that gives an appearance of slowness to
the execution. I have wished, <i>by</i> this slowness and
precision, to be certain that nothing should be omitted from the
conditions under which the strange phenomenon was produced,
which, until some natural explanation of it is forthcoming, seems
to me to prove, even better than the theories of Professor
Stangerson, the Dissociation of Matter&mdash;I will even say, the
instantaneous Dissociation of Matter."</p>

<h3>The Strange Phenomenon of the Dissociation of Matter.</h3>

<h3>(Extract from the Note-Book of Joseph Rouletabille,
<i>continued</i>).</h3>

<p class="first">
"I AM again at the window-sill," continues Rouletabille, "and
once more I raise my head above it. Through an opening in the
curtains, the arrangement of which has not been changed, I am
ready to look, anxious to note the position in which I am going
to find the murderer,&mdash;whether his back will still be turned
towards me!&mdash;whether he is still seated at the desk writing!
But perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;he is no longer there!&mdash;Yet
how could he have fled?&mdash;Was I not in possession of his
ladder? I force myself to be cool. I raise my head yet higher. I
look&mdash;he is still there. I see his monstrous back, deformed
by the shadow thrown by the candle. He is no longer writing now,
and the candle is on the parquet, over which he is
bending&mdash;a position which serves my purpose.</p>

<p>"I hold my breath. I mount the ladder. I am on the uppermost
rung of it, and with my left hand seize hold of the window-sill.
In this moment of approaching success, I feel my heart beating
wildly. I put my revolver between my teeth. A quick spring, and I
shall be on the window-ledge. But&mdash;the ladder! I had been
obliged to press on it heavily, and my foot had scarcely left it,
when I felt it swaying beneath me. It grated on the wall and
fell. But, already, my knees were touching the window-sill, and,
by a movement quick as lightning, I got on to it.</p>

<p>"But the murderer had been even quicker than I had been. He
had heard the grating of the ladder on the wall, and I saw the
monstrous back of the man raise itself. I saw his head. Did I
really see it?&mdash;The candle on the parquet lit up his legs
only. Above the height of the table the chamber was in darkness.
I saw a man with long hair, a full beard, wild-looking eyes, a
pale face, framed in large whiskers,&mdash;as well as I could
distinguish, and, as I think&mdash;red in colour. I did not know
the face. That was, in brief, the chief sensation I received from
that face in the dim half-light in which I saw it. I did not know
it&mdash;or, at least, I did not recognise it.</p>

<p>"Now for quick action! It was indeed time for that, for as I
was about to place my legs through the window, the man had seen
me, had bounded to his feet, had sprung&mdash;as I foresaw he
would&mdash;to the door of the ante-chamber, had time to open it,
and fled. But I was already behind him, revolver in hand,
shouting 'Help!'</p>

<p>"Like an arrow I crossed the room, but noticed a letter on the
table as I rushed. I almost came up with the man in the
ante-room, for he had lost time in opening the door to the
gallery. I flew on wings, and in the gallery was but a few feet
behind him. He had taken, as I supposed he would, the gallery on
his right,&mdash;that is to say, the road he had prepared for his
flight. 'Help, Jacques!&mdash;help, Larsan!' I cried. He could
not escape us! I raised a shout of joy, of savage victory. The
man reached the intersection of the two galleries hardly two
seconds before me for the meeting which I had prepared&mdash;the
fatal shock which must inevitably take place at that spot! We all
rushed to the crossing-place&mdash;Monsieur Stangerson and I
coming from one end of the right gallery, Daddy Jacques coming
from the other end of the same gallery, and Frédéric Larsan
coming from the 'off-turning' gallery.</p>

<p>"The man was not there!</p>

<p>"We looked at each other stupidly and with eyes terrified. The
man had vanished like a ghost. 'Where is he&mdash;where is he?'
we all asked.</p>

<p>"'It is impossible he can have escaped!' I cried, my terror
mastered by my anger.</p>

<p>"'I touched him!' exclaimed Frédéric Larsan.</p>

<p>"'I felt his breath on my face!' cried Daddy Jacques.</p>

<p>"'Where is he?'&mdash;where is he?' we all cried.</p>

<p>"We raced like madmen along the two galleries; we visited
doors and windows&mdash;they were closed, hermetically closed.
They had not been opened. Besides, the opening of a door or
window by this man whom we were hunting, without our having
perceived it, would have been more inexplicable than his
disappearance?</p>

<p>"Where is he?&mdash;where is he?&mdash;He could not have got
away by a door or a window, nor by any other way. He could not
have passed through our bodies!</p>

<p>"I confess that, for the moment, I felt 'done for.' For the
gallery was perfectly lighted, and there was neither trap, nor
secret door in the walls, nor any sort of hiding-place. We moved
the chairs and lifted the pictures. Nothing!&mdash;nothing! We
would have looked into a flower-pot, if there had been one to
look into!"</p>

<p>When this mystery, thanks to Rouletabille, was naturally
explained, by the help alone of his masterful mind, we were able
to realise that the murderer had got away neither by a door, a
window, nor the stairs&mdash;a fact which the judges would not
admit.</p>

"MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON appeared at the door of her
ante-room," continues Rouletabille's note-book. "We were near her
door in the gallery where this incredible phenomenon had taken
place. There are moments when one feels as if one's brain were
about to burst. A bullet in the head, a fracture of the skull,
the seat of reason shattered&mdash;with only these can I compare
the sensation which exhausted and left me void of sense.</p>

<p>"Happily, Mademoiselle Stangerson appeared on the threshold of
her ante-room. I saw her, and that helped to relieve my chaotic
state of mind. I breathed <i>her</i>&mdash;I inhaled the perfume
of the lady in black, whom I should never see again. I would have
given ten years of my life&mdash;half my life&mdash;to see once
more the lady in black! Alas! I no more meet her but from time to
time,&mdash;and yet!&mdash;and yet! how the memory of that
perfume&mdash;felt by me alone&mdash;carries me back to the days
of my childhood [*]. It was this sharp reminder from my beloved
perfume, of the lady in black, which made me go to
her&mdash;dressed wholly in white and so pale&mdash;so pale and
so beautiful!&mdash;on the threshold of the inexplicable gallery.
Her beautiful golden hair, gathered into a knot on the back of
her neck, left visible the red star on her temple which had so
nearly been the cause of her death. When I first got on the right
track of the mystery of this case I had imagined that, on the
night of the tragedy in The Yellow Room, Mademoiselle Stangerson
had worn her hair in bands. But then, how could I have imagined
otherwise when I had not been in The Yellow Room!</p>

<p class="footnote">[*] When I wrote these lines, Joseph
Rouletabille was eighteen years of age,&mdash;and he spoke of his
"youth." I have kept the text of my friend, but I inform the
reader here that the episode of the mystery of The Yellow Room
has no connection with that of the perfume of the lady in black.
It is not my fault if, in the document which I have cited,
Rouletabille thought fit to refer to his childhood.</p>


<p>"But now, since the occurrence of the inexplicable gallery, I
did not reason at all. I stood there, stupid, before the
apparition&mdash;so pale and so beautiful&mdash;of Mademoiselle
Stangerson. She was clad in a dressing-gown of dreamy white. One
might have taken her to be a ghost&mdash;a lovely phantom. Her
father took her in his arms and kissed her passionately, as if he
had recovered her after being long lost to him. I dared not
question her. He drew her into the room and we followed
them,&mdash;for we had to know!&mdash;The door of the boudoir was
open. The terrified faces of the two nurses craned towards us.
Mademoiselle Stangerson inquired the meaning of all the
disturbance. That she was not in her own room was quite easily
explained&mdash;quite easily. She had a fancy not to sleep that
night in her chamber, but in the boudoir with her nurses, locking
the door on them. Since the night of the crime she had
experienced feelings of terror, and fears came over her that are
easily to be comprehended.</p>

<p>"But who could imagine that on that particular night when
<i>he</i> was to come, she would, by a mere chance, determine to
shut herself in with her women? Who would think that she would
act contrary to her father's wish to sleep in the drawing-room?
Who could believe that the letter which had so recently been on
the table in her room would no longer be there? He who could
understand all this, would have to assume that Mademoiselle
Stangerson <i>knew</i> that the murderer was coming&mdash;she
could not prevent his coming again&mdash;unknown to her father,
unknown to all but to Monsieur Robert Darzac. For he must know it
now&mdash;perhaps he had known it before! Did he remember that
phrase in the Élysée garden: 'Must I commit a crime, then, to win
you?' Against whom the crime, if not against the <i>obstacle</i>,
against the murderer? 'Ah, I would kill him with my own
hand!'&mdash;And I replied, 'You have not answered my question.'
That was the very truth. In truth, in truth, Monsieur Darzac knew
the murderer so well that&mdash;while wishing to kill him
himself&mdash;he was afraid I should find him. There could be but
two reasons why he had assisted me in my investigation. First,
because I have forced him to do it; and, second, because she
would be the better protected.</p>

<p>"I am in the chamber&mdash;her room. I look at her, also at
the place where the letter had just now been. She has possessed
herself of it; it was evidently intended for her&mdash;evidently.
How she trembles!&mdash;Trembles at the strange story her father
is telling her, of the presence of the murderer in her chamber,
and of the pursuit. But it is plainly to be seen that she is not
wholly satisfied by the assurance given her until she had been
told that the murderer, by some incomprehensible means, had been
able to elude us.</p>

<p>"Then follows a silence. What a silence! We are all
there&mdash;looking at <i>her</i>,&mdash;her father, Larsan,
Daddy Jacques and I. What were we all thinking of in the silence?
After the events of that night, of the mystery of the
inexplicable gallery, of the prodigious fact of the presence of
the murderer in her room, it seemed to me that all our thoughts
might have been translated into the words which were addressed to
her. 'You who know of this mystery, explain it to us, and we
shall perhaps be able to save you.' How I longed to save
her&mdash;from herself, and, from the other!&mdash;It brought the
tears to my eyes.</p>

<p>"She is there, shedding about her the perfume of the lady in
black. At last, I see her, in the silence of her chamber. Since
the fatal hour of the mystery of The Yellow Room, we have hung
about this invisible and silent woman to learn what she knows.
Our desires, our wish to know must be a torment to her. Who can
tell that, should we learn the secret of her mystery, it would
not precipitate a tragedy more terrible than that which had
already been enacted here? Who can tell if it might not mean her
death? Yet it had brought her close to death,&mdash;and we still
knew nothing. Or, rather, there are some of us who know nothing.
But I&mdash;if I knew <i>who</i>, I should know all.
Who?&mdash;Who?&mdash;Not knowing <i>who</i>, I must remain
silent, out of pity for her. For there is no doubt that
<i>she</i> knows how he escaped from The Yellow Room, and yet she
keeps the secret. When I know <i>who</i>, I will speak to
him&mdash;to <i>him!</i></p>

<p>"She looked at us now&mdash;with a far-away look in her
eyes&mdash;as if we were not in the chamber. Monsieur Stangerson
broke the silence. He declared that, henceforth, he would no more
absent himself from his daughter's apartments. She tried to
oppose him in vain. He adhered firmly to his purpose. He would
install himself there this very night, he said. Solely concerned
for the health of his daughter, he reproached her for having left
her bed. Then he suddenly began talking to her as if she were a
little child. He smiled at her and seemed not to know either what
he said or what he did. The illustrious professor had lost his
head. Mademoiselle Stangerson in a tone of tender distress said:
'Father!&mdash;father!' Daddy Jacques blows his nose, and
Frédéric Larsan himself is obliged to turn away to hide his
emotion. For myself, I am able neither to think or feel. I felt
an infinite contempt for myself.</p>

<p>"It was the first time that Frédéric Larsan, like myself,
found himself face to face with Mademoiselle Stangerson since the
attack in The Yellow Room. Like me, he had insisted on being
allowed to question the unhappy lady; but he had not, any more
than had I, been permitted. To him, as to me, the same answer had
always been given: Mademoiselle Stangerson was too weak to
receive us. The questionings of the examining magistrate had
over-fatigued her. It was evidently intended not to give us any
assistance in our researches. I was not surprised; but Frédéric
Larsan had always resented this conduct. It is true that he and I
had a totally different theory of the crime.</p>

<p>"I still catch myself repeating from the depths of my heart:
'Save her!&mdash;save her without <i>his</i> speaking!' Who is
<i>he</i>&mdash;the murderer? Take him and shut his mouth. But
Monsieur Darzac made it clear that in order to shut his mouth he
must be killed. Have I the right to kill Mademoiselle
Stangerson's murderer? No, I had not. But let him only give me
the chance! Let me find out whether he is really a creature of
flesh and blood!&mdash;Let me see his dead body, since it cannot
be taken alive.</p>

<p>"If I could but make this woman, who does not even look at us,
understand! She is absorbed by her fears and by her father's
distress of mind. And I can do nothing to save her. Yes, I will
go to work once more and accomplish wonders.</p>

<p>"I move towards her. I would speak to her. I would entreat her
to have confidence in me. I would, in a word, make her
understand&mdash;she alone&mdash;that I know how the murderer
escaped from The Yellow Room&mdash;that I have guessed the
motives for her secrecy&mdash;and that I pity her with all my
heart. But by her gestures she begged us to leave her alone,
expressing weariness and the need for immediate rest. Monsieur
Stangerson asked us to go back to our rooms and thanked us.
Frédéric Larsan and I bowed to him and, followed by Daddy
Jacques, we regained the gallery. I heard Larsan murmur:
'Strange! strange!' He made a sign to me to go with him into his
room. On the threshold he turned towards Daddy Jacques.</p>

<p>"'Did you see him distinctly?' he asked.</p>

<p>"'Who?'</p>

<p>"'The man?'</p>

<p>"'Saw him!&mdash;why, he had a big red beard and red
hair.'</p>

<p>"'That's how he appeared to me,' I said.</p>

<p>"'And to me,' said Larsan.</p>

<p>"The great Fred and I were alone in his chamber, now, to talk
over this thing. We talked for an hour, turning the matter over
and viewing it from every side. From the questions put by him,
from the explanation which he gives me, it is clear to me
that&mdash;in spite of all our senses he is persuaded the man
disappeared by some secret passage in the château known to him
alone.</p>

<p>"'He knows the château,' he said to me; 'he knows it
well.'</p>

<p>"'He is a rather tall man&mdash;well-built,' I suggested.</p>

<p>"'He is as tall as he wants to be,' murmured Fred.</p>

<p>"'I understand,' I said; 'but how do you account for his red
hair and beard?'</p>

<p>"'Too much beard&mdash;too much hair&mdash;false,' says
Fred.</p>

<p>"'That's easily said. You are always thinking of Robert
Darzac. You can't get rid of that idea? <i>I</i> am certain that
he is innocent.'</p>

<p>"'So much the better. I hope so; but everything condemns him.
Did you notice the marks on the carpet?&mdash;Come and look at
them.'</p>

<p>"'I have seen them; they are the marks of the neat boots, the
same as those we saw on the border of the lake.'</p>

<p>"'Can you deny that they belong to Robert Darzac?'</p>

<p>"'Of course, one may be mistaken.'</p>

<p>"'Have you noticed that those footprints only go in one
direction?&mdash;that there are no return marks? When the man
came from the chamber, pursued by all of us, his footsteps left
no traces behind them.'</p>

<p>"'He had, perhaps, been in the chamber for hours. The mud from
his boots had dried, and he moved with such rapidity on the
points of his toes&mdash;We saw him running, but we did not hear
his steps.'</p>

<p>"I suddenly put an end to this idle chatter&mdash;void of any
logic, and made a sign to Larsan to listen.</p>

<p>"'There&mdash;below; some one is shutting a door.'</p>

<p>"I rise; Larsan follows me; we descend to the ground-floor of
the château. I lead him to the little semi-circular room under
the terrace beneath <i>the</i> window of the 'off-turning'
gallery. I point to the door, now closed, open a short time
before, under which a shaft of light is visible.</p>

<p>"'The forest-keeper!' says Fred.</p>

<p>"'Come on!' I whisper.</p>

<p>"Prepared&mdash;I know not why&mdash;to believe that the
keeper is the guilty man&mdash;I go to the door and rap smartly
on it.</p>

<p>"Some might think that we were rather late in thinking of the
keeper, since our first business, after having found that the
murderer had escaped us in the gallery, ought to have been to
search everywhere else,&mdash;around the château,&mdash;in the
park&mdash;</p>

<p>"Had this criticism been made at the time, we could only have
answered that the assassin had disappeared from the gallery in
such a way that we thought he was no longer <i>anywhere!</i> He
had eluded us when we all had our hands stretched out ready to
seize him&mdash;when we were almost touching him. We had no
longer any ground for hoping that we could clear up the mystery
of that night.</p>

<p>"As soon as I rapped at the door it was opened, and the keeper
asked us quietly what we wanted. He was undressed and preparing
to go to bed. The bed had not yet been disturbed.</p>

<p>"We entered and I affected surprise.</p>

<p>"'Not gone to bed yet?'</p>

<p>"'No,' he replied roughly. 'I have been making a round of the
park and in the woods. I am only just back&mdash;and sleepy.
Good-night!'</p>

<p>"'Listen,' I said. 'An hour or so ago, there was a ladder
close by your window.'</p>

<p>"'What ladder?&mdash;I did not see any ladder.
Good-night!'</p>

<p>"And he simply put us out of the room. When we were outside I
looked at Larsan. His face was impenetrable.</p>

<p>"'Well?' I said.</p>

<p>"'Well?' he repeated.</p>

<p>"'Does that open out any new view to you?'</p>

<p>"There was no mistaking Larsan's bad temper. On re-entering
the château, I heard him mutter:</p>

<p>"'It would be strange&mdash;very strange&mdash;if I had
deceived myself on that point!'</p>

<p>"He seemed to be talking to me rather than to himself. He
added:</p>

<p>"'In any case, we shall soon know what to think. The morning
will bring light with it.'"</p>

<p class="chaphead">Rouletabille Has Drawn A Circle Between The
Two Bumps On His Forehead.</p>

<h3>(Extract from the Note-Book of Joseph Rouletabille,
<i>continued</i>)</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
"WE separated on the thresholds of our rooms, with a
melancholy shake of the hands. I was glad to have aroused in him
a suspicion of error. His was an original brain, very intelligent
but&mdash;without method. I did not go to bed. I awaited the
coming of daylight and then went down to the front of the
château, and made a detour, examining every trace of footsteps
coming towards it or going from it. These, however, were so mixed
and confusing that I could make nothing of them. Here I may make
a remark,&mdash;I am not accustomed to attach an exaggerated
importance to exterior signs left in the track of a crime.</p>

<p>"The method which traces the criminal by means of the tracks
of his footsteps is altogether primitive. So many footprints are
identical. However, in the disturbed state of my mind, I did go
into the deserted court and did look at all the footprints I
could find there, seeking for some indication, as a basis for
reasoning.</p>

<p>"If I could but find a right starting-point! In despair I
seated myself on a stone. For over an hour I busied myself with
the common, ordinary work of a policeman. Like the least
intelligent of detectives I went on blindly over the traces of
footprints which told me just no more than they could.</p>

<p>"I came to the conclusion that I was a fool, lower in the
scale of intelligence than even the police of the modern
romancer. Novelists build mountains of stupidity out of a
footprint on the sand, or from an impression of a hand on the
wall. That's the way innocent men are brought to prison. It might
convince an examining magistrate or the head of a detective
department, but it's not proof. You writers forget that what the
senses furnish is not <i>proof</i>. If I am taking cognisance of
what is offered me by my senses I do so but to bring the results
within the circle of my reason. That circle may be the most
circumscribed, but if it is, it has this advantage&mdash;it holds
nothing but <i>the truth!</i> Yes, I swear that I have never used
the evidence of the senses but as servants to my reason. I have
never permitted them to become my master. They have not made of
me that monstrous thing,&mdash;worse than a blind man,&mdash;a
man who sees falsely. And that is why I can triumph over your
error and your merely animal intelligence, Frédéric Larsan.</p>

<p>"Be of good courage, then, friend Rouletabille; it is
<i>impossible</i> that the incident of the inexplicable gallery
should be outside the circle of your reason. You know that! Then
have faith and take thought with yourself and forget not that you
took hold of the right end when you drew that circle in your
brain within which to unravel this mysterious play of
circumstance.</p>

<p>"To it, once again! Go back to the gallery. Take your stand on
your reason and rest there as Frédéric Larsan rests on his cane.
You will then soon prove that the great Fred is nothing but a
fool.<i>&mdash;30th October. Noon.</i></p>

"I ACTED as I planned. With head on fire, I retraced my way
to the gallery, and without having found anything more than I had
seen on the previous night, the right hold I had taken of my
reason drew me to something so important that I was obliged to
cling to it to save myself from falling.</p>

<p>"Now for the strength and patience to find <i>sensible</i>
traces to fit in with my thinking&mdash;and these must come
within the circle I have drawn between the two bumps on my
forehead!<i>&mdash;30th of October. Midnight.</i></p>

<p>"Joseph Rouletabille."</p>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>Rouletabille Invites Me To Breakfast At The Donjon Inn.</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
IT was not until later that Rouletabille sent me the Note-Book
in which he had written at length the story of the phenomenon of
the inexplicable gallery. On the day I arrived at the Glandier
and joined him in his room, he recounted to me, with the greatest
detail, all that I have now related, telling me also how he had
spent several hours in Paris where he had learned nothing that
could be of any help to him.</p>

<p>The event of the inexplicable gallery had occurred on the
night between the 29th and 30th of October, that is to say, three
days before my return to the château. It was on the 2nd of
November, then, that I went back to the Glandier, summoned there
by my friend's telegram, and taking the revolvers with me.</p>

<p>I am now in Rouletabille's room and he has finished his
recital.</p>

<p>While he had been telling me the story I noticed him
continually rubbing the glass of the eye-glasses he had found on
the side table. From the evident pleasure he was taking in
handling them I felt they must be one of those <i>sensible</i>
evidences destined to enter, what he had called, the circle of
the right end of his reason. That strange and unique way of his,
to express himself in terms wonderfully adequate for his thought,
no longer surprised me. It was often necessary to know his
thought to understand the terms he used; and it was not easy to
penetrate into Rouletabille's thinking.</p>

<p>This lad's brain was one of the most curious things I have
ever observed. Rouletabille went on the even tenor of his way
without suspecting the astonishment and even bewilderment he
roused in others. I am sure he was not himself in the least
conscious of the originality of his genius. He was himself and at
ease wherever he happened to be.</p>

<p>When he had finished his recital he asked me what I thought of
it. I replied that I was much puzzled by his question. Then he
begged me to try, in my turn, to take my reason in hand "by the
right end."</p>

<p>"Very well," I said. "It seems to me that the point of
departure of my reason would be this&mdash;there can be no doubt
that the murderer you pursued was in the gallery." I paused.</p>

<p>"After making so good a start, you ought not to stop so soon,"
he exclaimed. "Come, make another effort."</p>

<p>"I'll try. Since he disappeared from the gallery without
passing through any door or window, he must have escaped by some
other opening."</p>

<p>Rouletabille looked at me pityingly, smiled carelessly, and
remarked that I was reasoning like a postman, or&mdash;like
Frédéric Larsan.</p>

<p>Rouletabille had alternate fits of admiration and disdain for
the great Fred. It all depended as to whether Larsan's
discoveries tallied with Rouletabille's reasoning or not. When
they did he would exclaim: "He is really great!" When they did
not he would grunt and mutter, "What an ass!" It was a petty side
of the noble character of this strange youth.</p>

<p>We had risen, and he led me into the park. When we reached the
court and were making towards the gate, the sound of blinds
thrown back against the wall made us turn our heads, and we saw,
at a window on the first floor of the château, the ruddy and
clean shaven face of a person I did not recognise.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" muttered Rouletabille. "Arthur Rance!"&mdash;He
lowered his head, quickened his pace, and I heard him ask himself
between his teeth: "Was he in the château that night? What is he
doing here?"</p>

<p>We had gone some distance from the château when I asked him
who this Arthur Rance was, and how he had come to know him. He
referred to his story of that morning and I remembered that Mr.
Arthur W. Rance was the American from Philadelphia with whom he
had had so many drinks at the Élysée reception.</p>

<p>"But was he not to have left France almost immediately?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"No doubt; that's why I am surprised to find him here still,
and not only in France, but above all, at the Glandier. He did
not arrive this morning; and he did not get here last night. He
must have got here before dinner, then. Why didn't the concierges
tell me?"</p>

<p>I reminded my friend, apropos of the concierges, that he had
not yet told me what had led him to get them set at liberty.</p>

<p>We were close to their lodge. Monsieur and Madame Bernier saw
us coming. A frank smile lit up their happy faces. They seemed to
harbour no ill-feeling because of their detention. My young
friend asked them at what hour Mr. Arthur Rance had arrived. They
answered that they did not know he was at the château. He must
have come during the evening of the previous night, but they had
not had to open the gate for him, because, being a great walker,
and not wishing that a carriage should be sent to meet him, he
was accustomed to get off at the little hamlet of Saint-Michel,
from which he came to the château by way of the forest. He
reached the park by the grotto of Sainte-Geneviève, over the
little gate of which, giving on to the park, he climbed.</p>

<p>As the concierges spoke, I saw Rouletabille's face cloud over
and exhibit disappointment&mdash;a disappointment, no doubt, with
himself. Evidently he was a little vexed, after having worked so
much on the spot, with so minute a study of the people and events
at the Glandier, that he had to learn now that Arthur Rance was
accustomed to visit the château.</p>

<p>"You say that Monsieur Arthur Rance is accustomed to come to
the château. When did he come here last?"</p>

<p>"We can't tell you exactly," replied Madame Bernier&mdash;that
was the name of the concierge&mdash;"we couldn't know while they
were keeping us in prison. Besides, as the gentleman comes to the
château without passing through our gate he goes away by the way
he comes."</p>

<p>"Do you know when he came the <i>first</i> time?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Monsieur!&mdash;nine years ago."</p>

<p>"He was in France nine years ago, then," said Rouletabille,
"and, since that time, as far as you know, how many times has he
been at the Glandier?"</p>

<p>"Three times."</p>

<p>"When did he come the last time, as far as you know?"</p>

<p>"A week before the attempt in The Yellow Room."</p>

<p>Rouletabille put another question&mdash;this time addressing
himself particularly to the woman:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the grove of the parquet?"</p>

<p>"In the grove of the parquet," she replied.</p>

<p>"Thanks!" said Rouletabille. "Be ready for me this
evening."</p>

<p>He spoke the last words with a finger on his lips as if to
command silence and discretion.</p>

<p>We left the park and took the way to the Donjon Inn.</p>

<p>"Do you often eat here?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes."</p>

<p>"But you also take your meals at the château?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Larsan and I are sometimes served in one of our
rooms."</p>

<p>"Hasn't Monsieur Stangerson ever invited you to his own
table?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Does your presence at the château displease him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but, in any case, he does not make us feel that
we are in his way."</p>

<p>"Doesn't he question you?"</p>

<p>"Never. He is in the same state of mind as he was in at the
door of The Yellow Room when his daughter was being murdered, and
when he broke open the door and did not find the murderer. He is
persuaded, since he could discover nothing, that there's no
reason why we should be able to discover more than he did. But he
has made it his duty, since Larsan expressed his theory, not to
oppose us."</p>

<p>Rouletabille buried himself in thought again for some time. He
aroused himself later to tell me of how he came to set the two
concierges free.</p>

<p>"I went lately to see Monsieur Stangerson, and took with me a
piece of paper on which was written: 'I promise, whatever others
may say, to keep in my service my two faithful servants, Bernier
and his wife.' I explained to him that, by signing that document,
he would enable me to compel those two people to speak out; and I
declared my own assurance of their innocence of any part in the
crime. That was also his opinion. The examining magistrate, after
it was signed, presented the document to the Berniers, who then
did speak. They said, what I was certain they would say, as soon
as they were sure they would not lose their place.</p>

<p>"They confessed to poaching on Monsieur Stangerson's estates,
and it was while they were poaching, on the night of the crime,
that they were found not far from the pavilion at the moment when
the outrage was being committed. Some rabbits they caught in that
way were sold by them to the landlord of the Donjon Inn, who
served them to his customers, or sent them to Paris. That was the
truth, as I had guessed from the first. Do you remember what I
said, on entering the Donjon Inn?&mdash;'We shall have to eat red
meat&mdash;now!' I had heard the words on the same morning when
we arrived at the park gate. You heard them also, but you did not
attach any importance to them. You recollect, when we reached the
park gate, that we stopped to look at a man who was running by
the side of the wall, looking every minute at his watch. That was
Larsan. Well, behind us the landlord of the Donjon Inn, standing
on his doorstep, said to someone inside: 'We shall have to eat
red meat&mdash;now.'</p>

<p>"Why that 'now'? When you are, as I am, in search of some
hidden secret, you can't afford to have anything escape you.
You've got to know the meaning of everything. We had come into a
rather out-of-the-way part of the country which had been turned
topsy-turvey by a crime, and my reason led me to suspect every
phrase that could bear upon the event of the day. 'Now,' I took
to mean, 'since the outrage.' In the course of my inquiry,
therefore, I sought to find a relation between that phrase and
the tragedy. We went to the Donjon Inn for breakfast; I repeated
the phrase and saw, by the surprise and trouble on Daddy
Mathieu's face, that I had not exaggerated its importance, so far
as he was concerned.</p>

<p>"I had just learned that the concierges had been arrested.
Daddy Mathieu spoke of them as of dear friends&mdash;people for
whom one is sorry. That was a reckless conjunction of ideas, I
said to myself. 'Now,' that the concierges are arrested, 'we
shall have to eat red meat.' No more concierges, no more game!
The hatred expressed by Daddy Mathieu for Monsieur Stangerson's
forest-keeper&mdash;a hatred he pretended was shared by the
concierges&mdash;led me easily to think of poaching. Now as all
the evidence showed the concierges had not been in bed at the
time of the tragedy, why were they abroad that night? As
participants in the crime? I was not disposed to think so. I had
already arrived at the conclusion, by steps of which I will tell
you later&mdash;that the assassin had had no accomplice, and that
the tragedy held a mystery between Mademoiselle Stangerson and
the murderer, a mystery with which the concierges had nothing to
do.</p>

<p>"With that theory in my mind, I searched for proof in their
lodge, which, as you know, I entered. I found there under their
bed, some springs and brass wire. 'Ah!' I thought, 'these things
explain why they were out in the park at night!' I was not
surprised at the dogged silence they maintained before the
examining magistrate, even under the accusation so grave as that
of being accomplices in the crime. Poaching would save them from
the Assize Court, but it would lose them their places; and, as
they were perfectly sure of their innocence of the crime, they
hoped it would soon be established, and then their poaching might
go on as usual. They could always confess later. I, however,
hastened their confession by means of the document Monsieur
Stangerson signed. They gave all the necessary 'proofs,' were set
at liberty, and have now a lively gratitude for me. Why did I not
get them released sooner? Because I was not sure that nothing
more than poaching was against them. I wanted to study the
ground. As the days went by, my conviction became more and more
certain. The day after the events of the inexplicable gallery I
had need of help I could rely on, so I resolved to have them
released at once."</p>

<p>That was how Joseph Rouletabille explained himself. Once more
I could not but be astonished at the simplicity of the reasoning
which had brought him to the truth of the matter. Certainly this
was no big thing; but I think, myself, that the young man will,
one of these days, explain with the same simplicity, the fearful
tragedy in The Yellow Room as well as the phenomenon of the
inexplicable gallery.</p>

<p>We reached the Donjon Inn and entered it.</p>

<p>This time we did not see the landlord, but were received with
a pleasant smile by the hostess. I have already described the
room in which we found ourselves, and I have given a glimpse of
the charming blonde woman with the gentle eyes who now
immediately began to prepare our breakfast.</p>

<p>"How's Daddy Mathieu?" asked Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"Not much better&mdash;not much better; he is still confined
to his bed."</p>

<p>"His rheumatism still sticks to him, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Last night I was again obliged to give him
morphine&mdash;the only drug that gives him any relief."</p>

<p>She spoke in a soft voice. Everything about her expressed
gentleness. She was, indeed, a beautiful woman; somewhat with an
air of indolence, with great eyes seemingly black and
blue&mdash;amorous eyes. Was she happy with her crabbed,
rheumatic husband? The scene at which we had once been present
did not lead us to believe that she was; yet there was something
in her bearing that was not suggestive of despair. She
disappeared into the kitchen to prepare our repast, leaving on
the table a bottle of excellent cider. Rouletabille filled our
earthenware mugs, loaded his pipe, and quietly explained to me
his reason for asking me to come to the Glandier with
revolvers.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, contemplatively looking at the clouds of smoke
he was puffing out, "yes, my dear boy, I expect the assassin
to-night."</p>

<p>A brief silence followed, which I took care not to interrupt,
and then he went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Last night, just as I was going to bed, Monsieur Robert
Darzac knocked at my room. When he came in he confided to me that
he was compelled to go to Paris the next day, that is, this
morning. The reason which made this journey necessary was at once
peremptory and mysterious; it was not possible for him to explain
its object to me. 'I go, and yet,' he added, 'I would give my
life not to leave Mademoiselle Stangerson at this moment.' He did
not try to hide that he believed her to be once more in danger.
'It will not greatly astonish me if something happens to-morrow
night,' he avowed, 'and yet I must be absent. I cannot be back at
the Glandier before the morning of the day after to-morrow.'</p>

<p>"I asked him to explain himself, and this is all he would tell
me. His anticipation of coming danger had come to him solely from
the coincidence that Mademoiselle Stangerson had been twice
attacked, and both times when he had been absent. On the night of
the incident of the inexplicable gallery he had been obliged to
be away from the Glandier. On the night of the tragedy in The
Yellow Room he had also not been able to be at the Glandier,
though this was the first time he had declared himself on the
matter. Now a man so moved who should still go away must be
acting under compulsion&mdash;must be obeying a will stronger
than his own. That was how I reasoned, and I told him so. He
replied 'Perhaps.'&mdash;I asked him if Mademoiselle Stangerson
was compelling him. He protested that she was not. His
determination to go to Paris had been taken without any
conference with Mademoiselle Stangerson.</p>

<p>"To cut the story short, he repeated that his belief in the
possibility of a fresh attack was founded entirely on the
extraordinary coincidence. 'If anything happens to Mademoiselle
Stangerson,' he said, 'it would be terrible for both of us. For
her, because her life would be in danger; for me because I could
neither defend her from the attack nor tell of where I had been.
I am perfectly aware of the suspicions cast on me. The examining
magistrate and Monsieur Larsan are both on the point of believing
in my guilt. Larsan tracked me the last time I went to Paris, and
I had all the trouble in the world to get rid of him.'</p>

<p>"'Why do you not tell me the name of the murderer now, if you
know it?' I cried.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Darzac appeared extremely troubled by my question,
and replied to me in a hesitating tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I?&mdash;I know the name of the murderer? Why, how could I
know his name?'</p>

<p>"I at once replied: 'From Mademoiselle Stangerson.'</p>

<p>"He grew so pale that I thought he was about to faint, and I
saw that I had hit the right nail on the head. Mademoiselle and
he knew the name of the murderer! When he recovered himself, he
said to me: 'I am going to leave you. Since you have been here I
have appreciated your exceptional intelligence and your
unequalled ingenuity. But I ask this service of you. Perhaps I am
wrong to fear an attack during the coming night; but, as I must
act with foresight, I count on you to frustrate any attempt that
may be made. Take every step needful to protect Mademoiselle
Stangerson. Keep a most careful watch of her room. Don't go to
sleep, nor allow yourself one moment of repose. The man we dread
is remarkably cunning&mdash;with a cunning that has never been
equalled. If you keep watch his very cunning may save her;
because it's impossible that he should not know that you are
watching; and knowing it, he may not venture.'</p>

<p>"'Have you spoken of all this to Monsieur Stangerson?'</p>

<p>"'No. I do not wish him to ask me, as you just now did, for
the name of the murderer. I tell you all this, Monsieur
Rouletabille, because I have great, very great, confidence in
you. I know that <i>you</i> do not suspect me.'</p>

<p>"The poor man spoke in jerks. He was evidently suffering. I
pitied him, the more because I felt sure that he would rather
allow himself to be killed than tell me who the murderer was. As
for Mademoiselle Stangerson, I felt that she would rather allow
herself to be murdered than denounce the man of The Yellow Room
and of the inexplicable gallery. The man must be dominating her,
or both, by some inscrutable power. They were dreading nothing so
much as the chance of Monsieur Stangerson knowing that his
daughter was 'held' by her assailant. I made Monsieur Darzac
understand that he had explained himself sufficiently, and that
he might refrain from telling me any more than he had already
told me. I promised him to watch through the night. He insisted
that I should establish an absolutely impassable barrier about
Mademoiselle Stangerson's chamber, around the boudoir where the
nurses were sleeping, and around the drawing-room where, since
the affair of the inexplicable gallery, Monsieur Stangerson had
slept. In short, I was to put a cordon round the whole
apartment.</p>

<p>"From his insistence I gathered that Monsieur Darzac intended
not only to make it impossible for the expected man to reach the
chamber of Mademoiselle Stangerson, but to make that
impossibility so visibly clear that, seeing himself expected, he
would at once go away. That was how I interpreted his final words
when we parted: 'You may mention <i>your</i> suspicions of the
expected attack to Monsieur Stangerson, to Daddy Jacques, to
Frédéric Larsan, and to anybody in the château.'</p>

<p>"The poor fellow left me hardly knowing what he was saying. My
silence and my eyes told him that I had guessed a large part of
his secret. And, indeed, he must have been at his wits' end, to
have come to me at such a time, and to abandon Mademoiselle
Stangerson in spite of his fixed idea as to the coincidence.</p>

<p>"When he was gone, I began to think that I should have to use
even a greater cunning than his so that if the man should come
that night, he might not for a moment suspect that his coming had
been expected. Certainly! I would allow him to get in far enough,
so that, dead or alive, I might see his face clearly! He must be
got rid of. Mademoiselle Stangerson must be freed from this
continual impending danger.</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy," said Rouletabille, after placing his pipe on
the table, and emptying his mug of cider, "I must see his face
distinctly, so as to make sure to impress it on that part of my
brain where I have drawn my circle of reasoning."</p>

<p>The landlady re-appeared at that moment, bringing in the
traditional bacon omelette. Rouletabille chaffed her a little,
and she took the chaff with the most charming good humour.</p>

<p>"She is much jollier when Daddy Mathieu is in bed with his
rheumatism," Rouletabille said to me.</p>

<p>But I had eyes neither for Rouletabille nor for the landlady's
smiles. I was entirely absorbed over the last words of my young
friend and in thinking over Monsieur Robert Darzac's strange
behaviour.</p>

<p>When he had finished his omelette and we were again alone,
Rouletabille continued the tale of his confidences.</p>

<p>"When I sent you my telegram this morning," he said, "I had
only the word of Monsieur Darzac, that 'perhaps' the assassin
would come to-night. I can now say that he will <i>certainly</i>
come. I expect him."</p>

<p>"What has made you feel this certainty?"</p>

<p>"I have been sure since half-past ten o'clock this morning
that he would come. I knew that before we saw Arthur Rance at the
window in the court."</p>

<p>"Ah!" I said, "But, again&mdash;what made you so sure? And why
since half-past ten this morning?"</p>

<p>"Because, at half-past ten, I had proof that Mademoiselle
Stangerson was making as many efforts to permit of the murderer's
entrance as Monsieur Robert Darzac had taken precautions against
it."</p>

<p>"Is that possible!" I cried. "Haven't you told me that
Mademoiselle Stangerson loves Monsieur Robert Darzac?"</p>

<p>"I told you so because it is the truth."</p>

<p>"Then do you see nothing strange&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everything in this business is strange, my friend; but take
my word for it, the strangeness you now feel is nothing to the
strangeness that's to come!"</p>

<p>"It must be admitted, then," I said, "that Mademoiselle
Stangerson and her murderer are in communication&mdash;at any
rate in writing?"</p>

<p>"Admit it, my friend, admit it! You don't risk anything! I
told you about the letter left on her table, on the night of the
inexplicable gallery affair,&mdash;the letter that
disappeared&mdash;into the pocket of Mademoiselle Stangerson. Why
should it not have been a summons to a meeting? Might he not, as
soon as he was sure of Darzac's absence, appoint the meeting for
the coming night?"</p>

<p>And my friend laughed silently. There are moments when I ask
myself if he is not laughing at <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>The door of the inn opened. Rouletabille was on his feet so
suddenly that one might have thought he had received an electric
shock.</p>

<p>"Mr. Arthur Rance!" he cried.</p>

<p>Mr. Arthur Rance stood before us calmly bowing.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>An Act Of Mademoiselle Stangerson.</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
"YOU remember me, Monsieur?" asked Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"Perfectly!" replied Arthur Rance. "I recognise you as the lad
at the bar. [The face of Rouletabille crimsoned at being called a
"lad."] I want to shake hands with you. You are a bright little
fellow."</p>

<p>The American extended his hand and Rouletabille, relaxing his
frown, shook it and introduced Mr. Arthur Rance to me. He invited
him to share our meal.</p>

<p>"No thanks. I breakfasted with Monsieur Stangerson."</p>

<p>Arthur Rance spoke French perfectly,&mdash;almost without an
accent.</p>

<p>"I did not expect to have the pleasure of seeing you again,
Monsieur. I thought you were to have left France the day after
the reception at the Élysée."</p>

<p>Rouletabille and I, outwardly indifferent, listened most
intently for every word the American would say.</p>

<p>The man's purplish red face, his heavy eyelids, the nervous
twitchings, all spoke of his addiction to drink. How come it that
so sorry a specimen of a man should be so intimate with Monsieur
Stangerson?</p>

<p>Some days later, I learned from Frédéric Larsan&mdash;who,
like ourselves, was surprised and mystified by his appearance and
reception at the château&mdash;that Mr. Rance had been an
inebriate for about fifteen years only; that is to say, since the
professor and his daughter left Philadelphia. During the time the
Stangersons lived in America they were very intimate with Arthur
Rance, who was one of the most distinguished phrenologists of the
new world. Owing to new experiments, he had made enormous strides
beyond the science of Gall and Lavater. The friendliness with
which he was received at the Glandier may be explained by the
fact that he had rendered Mademoiselle Stangerson a great service
by stopping, at the peril of his own life, the runaway horses of
her carriage. The immediate result of that could, however, have
been no more than a mere friendly association with the
Stangersons; certainly, not a love affair.</p>

<p>Frédéric Larsan did not tell me where he had picked up this
information; but he appeared to be quite sure of what he
said.</p>

<p>Had we known these facts at the time Arthur Rance met us at
the Donjon Inn, his presence at the château might not have
puzzled us, but they could not have failed to increase our
interest in the man himself. The American must have been at least
forty-five years old. He spoke in a perfectly natural tone in
reply to Rouletabille's question.</p>

<p>"I put off my return to America when I heard of the attack on
Mademoiselle Stangerson. I wanted to be certain the lady had not
been killed, and I shall not go away until she is perfectly
recovered."</p>

<p>Arthur Rance then took the lead in talk, paying no heed to
some of Rouletabille's questions. He gave us, without our
inviting him, his personal views on the subject of the
tragedy,&mdash;views which, as well as I could make out, were not
far from those held by Frédéric Larsan. The American also thought
that Robert Darzac had something to do with the matter. He did
not mention him by name, but there was no room to doubt whom he
meant. He told us he was aware of the efforts young Rouletabille
was making to unravel the tangled skein of The Yellow Room
mystery. He explained that Monsieur Stangerson had related to him
all that had taken place in the inexplicable gallery. He several
times expressed his regret at Monsieur Darzac's absence from the
château on all these occasions, and thought that Monsieur Darzac
had done cleverly in allying himself with Monsieur Joseph
Rouletabille, who could not fail, sooner or later, to discover
the murderer. He spoke the last sentence with unconcealed irony.
Then he rose, bowed to us, and left the inn.</p>

<p>Rouletabille watched him through the window.</p>

<p>"An odd fish, that!" he said.</p>

<p>"Do you think he'll pass the night at the Glandier?" I
asked.</p>

<p>To my amazement the young reporter answered that it was a
matter of entire indifference to him whether he did or not.</p>

<p>As to how we spent our time during the afternoon, all I need
say is that Rouletabille led me to the grotto of
Sainte-Geneviève, and, all the time, talked of every subject but
the one with which we were most interested. Towards evening I was
surprised to find Rouletabille making none of the preparations I
had expected him to make. I spoke to him about it when night had
come on, and we were once more in his room. He replied that all
his arrangements had already been made, and this time the
murderer would not get away from him.</p>

<p>I expressed some doubt on this, reminding him of his
disappearance in the gallery, and suggested that the same
phenomenon might occur again. He answered that he hoped it would.
He desired nothing more. I did not insist, knowing by experience
how useless that would have been. He told me that, with the help
of the concierges, the château had since early dawn, been watched
in such a way that nobody could approach it without his knowing
it, and that he had no concern for those who might have left it
and remained without.</p>

<p>It was then six o'clock by his watch. Rising, he made a sign
to me to follow him, and, without in the least trying to conceal
his movements or the sound of his footsteps, he led me through
the gallery. We reached the "right" gallery and came to the
landing-place which we crossed. We then continued our way in the
gallery of the left wing, passing Professor Stangerson's
apartment.</p>

<p>At the far end of the gallery, before coming to the donjon, is
the room occupied by Arthur Rance. We knew that, because we had
seen him at the window looking on to the court. The door of the
room opens on to the end of the gallery, exactly facing the east
window, at the extremity of the "right" gallery, where
Rouletabille had placed Daddy Jacques, and commands an
uninterrupted view of the gallery from end to end of the
château.</p>

<p>"That 'off-turning' gallery," said Rouletabille, "I reserve
for myself; when I tell you you'll come and take your place
here."</p>

<p>And he made me enter a little dark, triangular closet built in
a bend of the wall, to the left of the door of Arthur Rance's
room. From this recess I could see all that occurred in the
gallery as well as if I had been standing in front of Arthur
Rance's door, and I could watch that door, too. The door of the
closet, which was to be my place of observation, was fitted with
panels of transparent glass. In the gallery, where all the lamps
had been lit, it was quite light. In the closet, however, it was
quite dark. It was a splendid place from which to observe and
remain unobserved.</p>

<p>I was soon to play the part of a spy&mdash;a common policeman.
I wonder what my leader at the bar would have said had he known!
I was not altogether pleased with my duties, but I could not
refuse Rouletabille the assistance he had begged me to give him.
I took care not to make him see that I in the least objected, and
for several reasons. I wanted to oblige him; I did not wish him
to think me a coward; I was filled with curiosity; and it was too
late for me to draw back, even had I determined to do so. That I
had not had these scruples sooner was because my curiosity had
quite got the better of me. I might also urge that I was helping
to save the life of a woman, and even a lawyer may do that
conscientiously.</p>

<p>We returned along the gallery. On reaching the door of
Mademoiselle Stangerson's apartment, it opened from a push given
by the steward who was waiting at the dinner-table. (Monsieur
Stangerson had, for the last three days, dined with his daughter
in the drawing-room on the first floor.) As the door remained
open, we distinctly saw Mademoiselle Stangerson, taking advantage
of the steward's absence, and while her father was stooping to
pick up something he had let fall, pour the contents of a phial
into Monsieur Stangerson's glass.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>On The Watch.</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
THE act, which staggered me, did not appear to affect
Rouletabille much. We returned to his room and, without even
referring to what we had seen, he gave me his final instructions
for the night. First we were to go to dinner; after dinner, I was
to take my stand in the dark closet and wait there as long as it
was necessary&mdash;to look out for what might happen.</p>

<p>"If you <i>see</i> anything before I do," he explained, "you
must let me know. If the man gets into the 'right' gallery by any
other way than the 'off-turning' gallery, you will see him before
I shall, because you have a view along the whole length of the
'right' gallery, while I can only command a view of the
'off-turning' gallery. All you need do to let me know is to undo
the cord holding the curtain of the 'right' gallery window,
nearest to the dark closet. The curtain will fall of itself and
immediately leave a square of shadow where previously there had
been a square of light. To do this, you need but stretch your
hand out of the closet, I shall understand your signal
perfectly."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then you will see me coming round the corner of the
'off-turning' gallery."</p>

<p>"What am I to do then?"</p>

<p>"You will immediately come towards me, behind the man; but I
shall already be upon him, and shall have seen his face."</p>

<p>I attempted a feeble smile.</p>

<p>"Why do you smile? Well, you may smile while you have the
chance, but I swear you'll have no time for that a few hours from
now."</p>

<p>"And if the man escapes?"</p>

<p>"So much the better," said Rouletabille, coolly, "I don't want
to capture him. He may take himself off any way he can. <i>I will
let him go&mdash;after I have seen his face.</i> That's all I
want. I shall know afterwards what to do so that as far as
Mademoiselle Stangerson is concerned he shall be dead to her even
though he continues to live. If I took him alive, Mademoiselle
Stangerson and Robert Darzac would, perhaps, never forgive me!
And I wish to retain their good-will and respect.</p>

<p>"Seeing, as I have just now seen, Mademoiselle Stangerson pour
a narcotic into her father's glass, so that he might not be awake
to interrupt the conversation she is going to have with her
murderer, you can imagine she would not be grateful to me if I
brought the man of The Yellow Room and the inexplicable gallery,
bound and gagged, to her father. I realise now that if I am to
save the unhappy lady, I must silence the man and not capture
him. To kill a human being is no small thing. Besides, that's not
my business, unless the man himself makes it my business. On the
other hand, to render him forever silent without the lady's
assent and confidence is to act on one's own initiative and
assumes a knowledge of everything with nothing for a basis.
Fortunately, my friend, I have guessed, no, I have reasoned it
all out. All that I ask of the man who is coming to-night is to
bring me his face, so that it may enter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Into the circle?"</p>

<p>"Exactly! And his face won't surprise me!"</p>

<p>"But I thought you saw his face on the night when you sprang
into the chamber?"</p>

<p>"Only imperfectly. The candle was on the floor; and, his
beard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will he wear his beard this evening?"</p>

<p>"I think I can say for certain that he <i>will</i>. But the
gallery is light and, now, I know&mdash;or&mdash;at least, my
brain knows&mdash;and my eyes will see."</p>

<p>"If we are here only to see him and let him escape, why are we
armed?"</p>

<p>"Because, if the man of The Yellow Room and the inexplicable
gallery knows that <i>I</i> know, he is capable of doing
anything! We should then have to defend ourselves."</p>

<p>"And you are sure he will come to-night?"</p>

<p>"As sure as that you are standing there! This morning, at
half-past ten o'clock, Mademoiselle Stangerson, in the cleverest
way in the world, arranged to have no nurses to-night. She gave
them leave of absence for twenty-four hours, under some plausible
pretexts, and did not desire anybody to be with her but her
father, while they are away. Her father, who is to sleep in the
boudoir, has gladly consented to the arrangement. Darzac's
departure and what he told me, as well as the extraordinary
precautions Mademoiselle Stangerson is taking to be alone
to-night leaves me no room for doubt. She has prepared the way
for the coming of the man whom Darzac dreads."</p>

<p>"That's awful!"</p>

<p>"It is!"</p>

<p>"And what we saw her do was done to send her father to
sleep?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then there are but two of us for to-night's work?"</p>

<p>"Four; the concierge and his wife will watch at all hazards. I
don't set much value on them <i>before</i>&mdash;but the
concierge may be useful after&mdash;if there's to be any
killing!"</p>

<p>"Then you think there may be?"</p>

<p>"If <i>he</i> wishes it."</p>

<p>"Why haven't you brought in Daddy Jacques?&mdash;Have you made
no use of him to-day?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Rouletabille sharply.</p>

<p>I kept silence for awhile, then, anxious to know his thoughts,
I asked him point blank:</p>

<p>"Why not tell Arthur Rance?&mdash;He may be of great
assistance to us?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Rouletabille crossly, "then you want to let
everybody into Mademoiselle Stangerson's secrets?&mdash;Come, let
us go to dinner; it is time. This evening we dine in Frédéric
Larsan's room,&mdash;at least, if he is not on the heels of
Darzac. He sticks to him like a leech. But, anyhow, if he is not
there now, I am quite sure he will be, to-night! He's the one I
am going to knock over!"</p>

<p>At this moment we heard a noise in the room near us.</p>

<p>"It must be he," said Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"I forgot to ask you," I said, "if we are to make any allusion
to to-night's business when we are with this policeman. I take it
we are not. Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Evidently. We are going to operate alone, on our own personal
account."</p>

<p>"So that all the glory will be ours?"</p>

<p>Rouletabille laughed.</p>

<p>We dined with Frédéric Larsan in his room. He told us he had
just come in and invited us to be seated at table. We ate our
dinner in the best of humours, and I had no difficulty in
appreciating the feelings of certainty which both Rouletabille
and Larsan felt. Rouletabille told the great Fred that I had come
on a chance visit, and that he had asked me to stay and help him
in the heavy batch of writing he had to get through for the
"Epoque." I was going back to Paris, he said, by the eleven
o'clock train, taking his "copy," which took a story form,
recounting the principal episodes in the mysteries of the
Glandier. Larsan smiled at the explanation like a man who was not
fooled and politely refrains from making the slightest remark on
matters which did not concern him.</p>

<p>With infinite precautions as to the words they used, and even
as to the tones of their voices, Larsan and Rouletabille
discussed, for a long time, Mr. Arthur Rance's appearance at the
château, and his past in America, about which they expressed a
desire to know more, at any rate, so far as his relations with
the Stangersons. At one time, Larsan, who appeared to me to be
unwell, said, with an effort:</p>

<p>"I think, Monsieur Rouletabille, that we've not much more to
do at the Glandier, and that we sha'n't sleep here many more
nights."</p>

<p>"I think so, too, Monsieur Fred."</p>

<p>"Then you think the conclusion of the matter has been
reached?"</p>

<p>"I think, indeed, that we have nothing more to find out,"
replied Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"Have you found your criminal?" asked Larsan.</p>

<p>"Have you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"So have I," said Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"Can it be the same man?"</p>

<p>"I don't know if you have swerved from your original idea,"
said the young reporter. Then he added, with emphasis: "Monsieur
Darzac is an honest man!"</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that?" asked Larsan. "Well, I am sure he is
not. So it's a fight then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a fight. But I shall beat you, Monsieur Frédéric
Larsan."</p>

<p>"Youth never doubts anything," said the great Fred laughingly,
and held out his hand to me by way of conclusion.</p>

<p>Rouletabille's answer came like an echo:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not anything!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Larsan, who had risen to wish us good-night, pressed
both his hands to his chest and staggered. He was obliged to lean
on Rouletabille for support, and to save himself from
falling.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" he cried. "What is the matter with me?&mdash;Have I
been poisoned?"</p>

<p>He looked at us with haggard eyes. We questioned him vainly;
he did not answer us. He had sunk into an armchair and we could
get not a word from him. We were extremely distressed, both on
his account and on our own, for we had partaken of all the dishes
he had eaten. He seemed to be out of pain; but his heavy head had
fallen on his shoulder and his eyelids were tightly closed.
Rouletabille bent over him, listening for the beatings of the
heart.</p>

<p>My friend's face, however, when he stood up, was as calm as it
had been a moment before agitated.</p>

<p>"He is asleep," he said.</p>

<p>He led me to his chamber, after closing Larsan's room.</p>

<p>"The drug?" I asked. "Does Mademoiselle Stangerson wish to put
everybody to sleep, to-night?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied Rouletabille; but I could see he was
thinking of something else.</p>

<p>"But what about us?" I exclaimed. "How do we know that we have
not been drugged?"</p>

<p>"Do you feel indisposed?" Rouletabille asked me coolly.</p>

<p>"Not in the least."</p>

<p>"Do you feel any inclination to go to sleep?"</p>

<p>"None whatever."</p>

<p>"Well, then, my friend, smoke this excellent cigar."</p>

<p>And he handed me a choice Havana, one Monsieur Darzac had
given him, while he lit his briarwood&mdash;his eternal
briarwood.</p>

<p>We remained in his room until about ten o'clock without a word
passing between us. Buried in an armchair Rouletabille sat and
smoked steadily, his brow in thought and a far-away look in his
eyes. On the stroke of ten he took off his boots and signed to me
to do the same. Standing in our socks he said, in so low a tone
that I guessed, rather than heard, the word:</p>

<p>"Revolver."</p>

<p>I drew my revolver from my jacket pocket.</p>

<p>"Cock it!" he said.</p>

<p>I did as he directed.</p>

<p>Then moving towards the door of his room, he opened it with
infinite precaution; it made no sound. We were in the
"off-turning" gallery. Rouletabille made another sign to me which
I understood to mean that I was to take up my post in the dark
closet.</p>

<p>When I was some distance from him, he rejoined me and embraced
me; and then I saw him, with the same precaution, return to his
room. Astonished by his embrace, and somewhat disquieted by it, I
arrived at the right gallery without difficulty, crossing the
landing-place, and reaching the dark closet.</p>

<p>Before entering it I examined the curtain-cord of the window
and found that I had only to release it from its fastening with
my fingers for the curtain to fall by its own weight and hide the
square of light from Rouletabille&mdash;the signal agreed upon.
The sound of a footstep made me halt before Arthur Rance's door.
He was not yet in bed, then! How was it that, being in the
château, he had not dined with Monsieur Stangerson and his
daughter? I had not seen him at table with them, at the moment
when we looked in.</p>

<p>I retired into the dark closet. I found myself perfectly
situated. I could see along the whole length of the gallery.
Nothing, absolutely nothing could pass there without my seeing
it. But what was going to pass there? Rouletabille's embrace came
back to my mind. I argued that people don't part from each other
in that way unless on an important or dangerous occasion. Was I
then in danger?</p>

<p>My hand closed on the butt of my revolver and I waited. I am
not a hero; but neither am I a coward.</p>

<p>I waited about an hour, and during all that time I saw nothing
unusual. The rain, which had begun to come down strongly towards
nine o'clock, had now ceased.</p>

<p>My friend had told me that, probably, nothing would occur
before midnight or one o'clock in the morning. It was not more
than half-past eleven, however, when I heard the door of Arthur
Rance's room open very slowly. The door remained open for a
minute which seemed to me a long time. As it opened into the
gallery, that is to say, outwards, I could not see what was
passing in the room behind the door.</p>

<p>At that moment I noticed a strange sound, three times
repeated, coming from the park. Ordinarily I should not have
attached any more importance to it than I would to the noise of
cats on the roof. But the third time, the mew was so sharp and
penetrating that I remembered what I had heard about the cry of
the <i>Bête du bon Dieu</i>. As the cry had accompanied all the
events at the Glandier, I could not refrain from shuddering at
the thought.</p>

<p>Directly afterwards I saw a man appear on the outside of the
door, and close it after him. At first I could not recognise him,
for his back was towards me and he was bending over a rather
bulky package. When he had closed the door and picked up the
package, he turned towards the dark closet, and then I saw who he
was. He was the forest-keeper, the Green Man. He was wearing the
same costume that he had worn when I first saw him on the road in
front of the Donjon Inn. There was no doubt about his being the
keeper. As the cry of the <i>Bête du Bon Dieu</i> came for the
third time, he put down the package and went to the second
window, counting from the dark closet. I dared not risk making
any movement, fearing I might betray my presence.</p>

<p>Arrived at the window, he peered out on to the park. The night
was now light, the moon showing at intervals. The Green Man
raised his arms twice, making signs which I did not understand;
then, leaving the window, he again took up his package and moved
along the gallery towards the landing-place.</p>

<p>Rouletabille had instructed me to undo the curtain-cord when I
saw anything. Was Rouletabille expecting this? It was not my
business to question. All I had to do was obey instructions. I
unfastened the window-cord; my heart beating the while as if it
would burst. The man reached the landing-place, but, to my utter
surprise&mdash;I had expected to see him continue to pass along
the gallery&mdash;I saw him descend the stairs leading to the
vestibule.</p>

<p>What was I to do? I looked stupidly at the heavy curtain which
had shut the light from the window. The signal had been given,
and I did not see Rouletabille appear at the corner of the
off-turning gallery. Nobody appeared. I was exceedingly
perplexed. Half an hour passed, an age to me. What was I to do
now, even if I saw something? The signal once given I could not
give it a second time. To venture into the gallery might upset
all Rouletabille's plans. After all, I had nothing to reproach
myself with, and if something had happened that my friend had not
expected he could only blame himself. Unable to be of any further
assistance to him by means of a signal, I left the dark closet
and, still in my socks, picked my steps and made my way to the
"off-turning" gallery.</p>

<p>There was no one there. I went to the door of Rouletabille's
room and listened. I could hear nothing. I knocked gently. There
was no answer. I turned the door-handle and the door opened. I
entered. Rouletabille lay extended at full length on the
floor.</p>

<h2><a id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>The Incredible Body.</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
I BENT in great anxiety over the body of the reporter and had
the joy to find that he was deeply sleeping, the same unhealthy
sleep that I had seen fall upon Frédéric Larsan. He had succumbed
to the influence of the same drug that had been mixed with our
food. How was it then, that I, also, had not been overcome by it?
I reflected that the drug must have been put into our wine;
because that would explain my condition. I never drink when
eating. Naturally inclined to obesity, I am restricted to a dry
diet. I shook Rouletabille, but could not succeed in waking him.
This, no doubt, was the work of Mademoiselle Stangerson.</p>

<p>She had certainly thought it necessary to guard herself
against this young man as well as her father. I recalled that the
steward, in serving us, had recommended an excellent Chablis
which, no doubt, had come from the professor's table.</p>

<p>More than a quarter of an hour passed. I resolved, under the
pressing circumstances, to resort to extreme measures. I threw a
pitcher of cold water over Rouletabille's head. He opened his
eyes. I beat his face, and raised him up. I felt him stiffen in
my arms and heard him murmur: "Go on, go on; but don't make any
noise." I pinched him and shook him until he was able to stand
up. We were saved!</p>

<p>"They sent me to sleep," he said. "Ah! I passed an awful
quarter of an hour before giving way. But it is over now. Don't
leave me."</p>

<p>He had no sooner uttered those words than we were thrilled by
a frightful cry that rang through the château,&mdash;a veritable
death cry.</p>

<p>"Malheur!" roared Rouletabille; "we shall be too late!"</p>

<p>He tried to rush to the door, but he was too dazed, and fell
against the wall. I was already in the gallery, revolver in hand,
rushing like a madman towards Mademoiselle Stangerson's room. The
moment I arrived at the intersection of the "off-turning" gallery
and the "right" gallery, I saw a figure leaving her apartment,
which, in a few strides had reached the landing-place.</p>

<p>I was not master of myself. I fired. The report from the
revolver made a deafening noise; but the man continued his flight
down the stairs. I ran behind him, shouting: "Stop!&mdash;stop!
or I will kill you!" As I rushed after him down the stairs, I
came face to face with Arthur Rance coming from the left wing of
the château, yelling: "What is it? What is it?" We arrived almost
at the same time at the foot of the staircase. The window of the
vestibule was open. We distinctly saw the form of a man running
away. Instinctively we fired our revolvers in his direction. He
was not more than ten paces in front of us; he staggered and we
thought he was going to fall. We had sprung out of the window,
but the man dashed off with renewed vigour. I was in my socks,
and the American was barefooted. There being no hope of
overtaking him, we fired our last cartridges at him. But he still
kept on running, going along the right side of the court towards
the end of the right wing of the château, which had no other
outlet than the door of the little chamber occupied by the
forest-keeper.</p>

<p>The man, though he was evidently wounded by our bullets, was
now twenty yards ahead of us. Suddenly, behind us, and above our
heads, a window in the gallery opened and we heard the voice of
Rouletabille crying out desperately:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fire, Bernier!&mdash;Fire!"</p>

<p>At that moment the clear moonlight night was further lit by a
broad flash. By its light we saw Daddy Bernier with his gun on
the threshold of the donjon door.</p>

<p>He had taken good aim. The shadow fell. But as it had reached
the end of the right wing of the château, it fell on the other
side of the angle of the building; that is to say, we saw it
about to fall, but not the actual sinking to the ground. Bernier,
Arthur Rance and myself reached the other side twenty seconds
later. The shadow was lying dead at our feet.</p>

<p>Aroused from his lethargy by the cries and reports, Larsan
opened the window of his chamber and called out to us.
Rouletabille, quite awake now, joined us at the same moment, and
I cried out to him:</p>

<p>"He is dead!&mdash;is dead!"</p>

<p>"So much the better," he said. "Take him into the vestibule of
the château." Then as if on second thought, he said:
"No!&mdash;no! Let us put him in his own room."</p>

<p>Rouletabille knocked at the door. Nobody answered. Naturally,
this did not surprise me.</p>

<p>"He is evidently not there, otherwise he would have come out,"
said the reporter. "Let us carry him to the vestibule then."</p>

<p>Since reaching the dead <i>shadow</i>, a thick cloud had
covered the moon and darkened the night, so that we were unable
to make out the features. Daddy Jacques, who had now joined us,
helped us to carry the body into the vestibule, where we laid it
down on the lower step of the stairs. On the way, I had felt my
hands wet from the warm blood flowing from the wounds.</p>

<p>Daddy Jacques flew to the kitchen and returned with a lantern.
He held it close to the face of the dead shadow, and we
recognised the keeper, the man called by the landlord of the
Donjon Inn the Green Man, whom, an hour earlier, I had seen come
out of Arthur Rance's chamber carrying a parcel. But what I had
seen I could only tell Rouletabille later, when we were
alone.</p>

<p><br>
ROULETABILLE and Frédéric Larsan experienced a cruel
disappointment at the result of the night's adventure. They could
only look in consternation and stupefaction at the body of the
Green Man.</p>

<p>Daddy Jacques showed a stupidly sorrowful face and with silly
lamentations kept repeating that we were mistaken&mdash;the
keeper could not be the assailant. We were obliged to compel him
to be quiet. He could not have shown greater grief had the body
been that of his own son. I noticed, while all the rest of us
were more or less undressed and barefooted, that he was fully
clothed.</p>

<p>Rouletabille had not left the body. Kneeling on the flagstones
by the light of Daddy Jacques's lantern he removed the clothes
from the body and laid bare its breast. Then snatching the
lantern from Daddy Jacques, he held it over the corpse and saw a
gaping wound. Rising suddenly he exclaimed in a voice filled with
savage irony:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The man you believe to have been shot was killed by the stab
of a knife in his heart!"</p>

<p>I thought Rouletabille had gone mad; but, bending over the
body, I quickly satisfied myself that Rouletabille was right. Not
a sign of a bullet anywhere&mdash;the wound, evidently made by a
sharp blade, had penetrated the heart.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>The Double Scent.</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
I HAD hardly recovered from the surprise into which this new
discovery had plunged me, when Rouletabille touched me on the
shoulder and asked me to follow him into his room.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do there?"</p>

<p>"To think the matter over."</p>

<p>I confess I was in no condition for doing much thinking, nor
could I understand how Rouletabille could so control himself as
to be able calmly to sit down for reflection when he must have
known that Mademoiselle Stangerson was at that moment almost on
the point of death. But his self-control was more than I could
explain. Closing the door of his room, he motioned me to a chair
and, seating himself before me, took out his pipe. We sat there
for some time in silence and then I fell asleep.</p>

<p>When I awoke it was daylight. It was eight o'clock by my
watch. Rouletabille was no longer in the room. I rose to go out
when the door opened and my friend re-entered. He had evidently
lost no time.</p>

<p>"How about Mademoiselle Stangerson?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Her condition, though very alarming, is not desperate."</p>

<p>"When did you leave this room?"</p>

<p>"Towards dawn."</p>

<p>"I guess you have been hard at work?"</p>

<p>"Rather!"</p>

<p>"Have you found out anything?"</p>

<p>"Two sets of footprints!"</p>

<p>"Do they explain anything?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have they anything to do with the mystery of the keeper's
body?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the mystery is no longer a mystery. This morning,
walking round the château, I found two distinct sets of
footprints, made at the same time, last night. They were made by
two persons walking side by side. I followed them from the court
towards the oak grove. Larsan joined me. They were the same kind
of footprints as were made at the time of the assault in The
Yellow Room&mdash;one set was from clumsy boots and the other was
made by neat ones, except that the big toe of one of the sets was
of a different size from the one measured in The Yellow Room
incident. I compared the marks with the paper patterns I had
previously made.</p>

<p>"Still following the tracks of the prints, Larsan and I passed
out of the oak grove and reached the border of the lake. There
they turned off to a little path leading to the high road to
Epinay where we lost the traces in the newly macadamised
highway.</p>

<p>"We went back to the château and parted at the courtyard. We
met again, however, in Daddy Jacques's room to which our separate
trains of thinking had led us both. We found the old servant in
bed. His clothes on the chair were wet through and his boots very
muddy. He certainly did not get into that state in helping us to
carry the body of the keeper. It was not raining then. Then his
face showed extreme fatigue and he looked at us out of
terror-stricken eyes.</p>

<p>"On our first questioning him he told us that he had gone to
bed immediately after the doctor had arrived. On pressing him,
however, for it was evident to us he was not speaking the truth,
he confessed that he had been away from the château. He explained
his absence by saying that he had a headache and went out into
the fresh air, but had gone no further than the oak grove. When
we then described to him the whole route he had followed, he sat
up in bed trembling.</p>

<p>"'And you were not alone!' cried Larsan.</p>

<p>"'Did you see it then?' gasped Daddy Jacques.</p>

<p>"'What?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'The phantom&mdash;the black phantom!'</p>

<p>"Then he told us that for several nights he had seen what he
kept calling the black phantom. It came into the park at the
stroke of midnight and glided stealthily through the trees; it
appeared to him to pass through the trunks of the trees. Twice he
had seen it from his window, by the light of the moon, and had
risen and followed the strange apparition. The night before last
he had almost overtaken it; but it had vanished at the corner of
the donjon. Last night, however, he had not left the château, his
mind being disturbed by a presentiment that some new crime would
be attempted. Suddenly he saw the black phantom rush out from
somewhere in the middle of the court. He followed it to the lake
and to the high road to Epinay, where the phantom suddenly
disappeared.</p>

<p>"'Did you see his face?' demanded Larsan.</p>

<p>"'No!&mdash;I saw nothing but black veils.'</p>

<p>"'Did you go out after what passed on the gallery?'</p>

<p>"'I could not!&mdash;I was terrified.'</p>

<p>"'Daddy Jacques,' I said, in a threatening voice, 'you did not
<i>follow</i> it; you and the phantom walked to Epinay
together&mdash;arm in arm!'</p>

<p>"'No!' he cried, turning his eyes away, 'I did not. It came on
to pour, and&mdash;I turned back. I don't know what became of the
black phantom.'</p>

<p>"We left him, and when we were outside I turned to Larsan,
looking him full in the face, and put my question suddenly to
take him off his guard:</p>

<p>"'An accomplice?'</p>

<p>"'How can I tell?' he replied, shrugging his shoulders. 'You
can't be sure of anything in a case like this. Twenty-four hours
ago I would have sworn that there was no accomplice!' He left me
saying he was off to Epinay."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you make of it?" I asked Rouletabille, after he
had ended his recital. "Personally I am utterly in the dark. I
can't make anything out of it. What do you gather?"</p>

<p>"Everything! Everything!" he exclaimed. "But," he said
abruptly, "let's find out further about Mademoiselle
Stangerson."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3>Rouletabille Knows The Two Halves Of The Murderer.</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON had been for the second time almost
murdered. Unfortunately, she was in too weak a state to bear the
severer injuries of this second attack as well as she had those
of the first. She had received three wounds in the breast from
the murderer's knife, and she lay long between life and death.
Her strong physique, however, saved her; but though she recovered
physically it was found that her mind had been affected. The
slightest allusion to the terrible incident sent her into
delirium, and the arrest of Robert Darzac which followed on the
day following the tragic death of the keeper seemed to sink her
fine intelligence into complete melancholia.</p>

<p>Robert Darzac arrived at the château towards half-past nine. I
saw him hurrying through the park, his hair and clothes in
disorder and his face a deadly white. Rouletabille and I were
looking out of a window in the gallery. He saw us, and gave a
despairing cry: "I'm too late!"</p>

<p>Rouletabille answered: "She lives!"</p>

<p>A minute later Darzac had gone into Mademoiselle Stangerson's
room and, through the door, we could hear his heart-rending
sobs.</p>

<hr>

<p class="first">
"THERE'S a fate about this place!" groaned Rouletabille. "Some
infernal gods must be watching over the misfortunes of this
family!&mdash;If I had not been drugged, I should have saved
Mademoiselle Stangerson. I should have silenced him forever. And
the keeper would not have been killed!"</p>

<hr>

<p class="first">
MONSIEUR DARZAC came in to speak with us. His distress was
terrible. Rouletabille told him everything: his preparations for
Mademoiselle Stangerson's safety; his plans for either capturing
or for disposing of the assailant for ever; and how he would have
succeeded had it not been for the drugging.</p>

<p>"If only you had trusted me!" said the young man, in a low
tone, "if you had but begged Mademoiselle Stangerson to confide
in me!&mdash;But, then, everybody here distrusts everybody else,
the daughter distrusts her father, and even her lover. While you
ask me to protect her she is doing all she can to frustrate me.
That was why I came on the scene too late!"</p>

<p>At Monsieur Robert Darzac's request Rouletabille described the
whole scene. Leaning on the wall, to prevent himself from
falling, he had made his way to Mademoiselle Stangerson's room,
while we were running after the supposed murderer. The ante-room
door was open and when he entered he found Mademoiselle
Stangerson lying partly thrown over the desk. Her dressing-gown
was dyed with the blood flowing from her bosom. Still under the
influence of the drug, he felt he was walking in a horrible
nightmare.</p>

<p>He went back to the gallery automatically, opened a window,
shouted his order to fire, and then returned to the room. He
crossed the deserted boudoir, entered the drawing-room, and tried
to rouse Monsieur Stangerson who was lying on a sofa. Monsieur
Stangerson rose stupidly and let himself be drawn by Rouletabille
into the room where, on seeing his daughter's body, he uttered a
heart-rending cry. Both united their feeble strength and carried
her to her bed.</p>

<p>On his way to rejoin us Rouletabille passed by the desk. On
the floor, near it, he saw a large packet. He knelt down and,
finding the wrapper loose, he examined it, and made out an
enormous quantity of papers and photographs. On one of the papers
he read: "New differential electroscopic condenser. Fundamental
properties of substance intermediary between ponderable matter
and imponderable ether." Strange irony of fate that the
professor's precious papers should be restored to him at the very
time when an attempt was being made to deprive him of his
daughter's life! What are papers worth to him now?</p>

<hr>

<p class="first">
THE morning following that awful night saw Monsieur de Marquet
once more at the château, with his Registrar and gendarmes. Of
course we were all questioned. Rouletabille and I had already
agreed on what to say. I kept back any information as to my being
in the dark closet and said nothing about the drugging. We did
not wish to suggest in any way that Mademoiselle Stangerson had
been expecting her nocturnal visitor. The poor woman might,
perhaps, never recover, and it was none of our business to lift
the veil of a secret the preservation of which she had paid for
so dearly.</p>

<p>Arthur Rance told everybody, in a manner so natural that it
astonished me, that he had last seen the keeper towards eleven
o'clock of that fatal night. He had come for his valise he said,
which he was to take for him early next morning to the
Saint-Michel station; and had been kept out late running after
poachers. Arthur Rance had, indeed, intended to leave the château
and, according to his habit, to walk to the station.</p>

<p>Monsieur Stangerson confirmed what Rance had said, adding that
he had not asked Rance to dine with him because his friend had
taken his final leave of them both earlier in the evening.
Monsieur Rance had had tea served him in his room, because he had
complained of a slight indisposition.</p>

<p>Bernier testified, instructed by Rouletabille, that the keeper
had ordered him to meet at a spot near the oak grove, for the
purpose of looking out for poachers. Finding that the keeper did
not keep his appointment, he, Bernier, had gone in search of him.
He had almost arrived at the donjon, when he saw a figure running
swiftly in a direction opposite to him, towards the right wing of
the château. He heard revolver shots from behind the figure and
saw Rouletabille at one of the gallery windows. He heard
Rouletabille call out to him to fire, and he had fired. He
believed he had killed the man until he learned, after
Rouletabille had uncovered the body, that the man had died from a
knife thrust. Who had given it he could not imagine. "Nobody
could have been near the spot without my seeing him." When the
examining magistrate reminded him that the spot where the body
was found was very dark and that he himself had not been able to
recognise the keeper before firing, Daddy Bernier replied that
neither had they seen the other body; nor had they found it. In
the narrow court where five people were standing it would have
been strange if the other body, had it been there, could have
escaped. The only door that opened into the court was that of the
keeper's room, and that door was closed, and the key of it was
found in the keeper's pocket.</p>

<p>However that might be, the examining magistrate did not pursue
his inquiry further in this direction. He was evidently convinced
that we had missed the man we were chasing and we had come upon
the keeper's body in our chase. This matter of the keeper was
another matter entirely. He wanted to satisfy himself about that
without any further delay. Probably it chimed in with the
conclusions he had already arrived at as to the keeper and his
intrigues with the wife of Mathieu the landlord of the Donjon
Inn. This Mathieu, later in the afternoon, was arrested and taken
to Corbeil in spite of his rheumatism. He had been heard to
threaten the keeper, and though no evidence against him had been
found at his inn, the evidence of carters who had heard the
threats was enough to justify his retention.</p>

<p>The examination had proceeded thus far when, to our surprise,
Frédéric Larsan returned to the château. He was accompanied by
one of the employés of the railway. At that moment Rance and I
were in the vestibule discussing Mathieu's guilt or innocence,
while Rouletabille stood apart buried, apparently, in thought.
The examining magistrate and his Registrar were in the little
green drawing-room, while Darzac was with the doctor and
Stangerson in the lady's chamber. As Frédéric Larsan entered the
vestibule with the railway employé, Rouletabille and I at once
recognised him by the small blond beard. We exchanged meaning
glances. Larsan had himself announced to the examining magistrate
by the gendarme and entered with the railway servant as Daddy
Jacques came out. Some ten minutes went by during which
Rouletabille appeared extremely impatient. The door of the
drawing-room was then opened and we heard the magistrate calling
to the gendarme who entered. Presently he came out, mounted the
stairs and, coming back shortly, went in to the magistrate and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Monsieur,&mdash;Monsieur Robert Darzac will not come!"</p>

<p>"What! Not come!" cried Monsieur de Marquet.</p>

<p>"He says he cannot leave Mademoiselle Stangerson in her
present state."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Monsieur de Marquet; "then we'll go to
him."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Marquet and the gendarme mounted the stairs. He
made a sign to Larsan and the railway employé to follow.
Rouletabille and I went along too.</p>

<p>On reaching the door of Mademoiselle Stangerson's chamber,
Monsieur de Marquet knocked. A chambermaid appeared. It was
Sylvia, with her hair all in disorder and consternation showing
on her face.</p>

<p>"Is Monsieur Stangerson within?" asked the magistrate.</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Tell him that I wish to speak with him."</p>

<p>Stangerson came out. His appearance was wretched in the
extreme.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he demanded of the magistrate. "May I not
be left in peace, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said the magistrate, "it is absolutely necessary
that I should see Monsieur Darzac at once. If you cannot induce
him to come, I shall be compelled to use the help of the
law."</p>

<p>The professor made no reply. He looked at us all like a man
being led to execution, and then went back into the room.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after Monsieur Robert Darzac came out. He
was very pale. He looked at us and, his eyes falling on the
railway servant, his features stiffened and he could hardly
repress a groan.</p>

<p>We were all much moved by the appearance of the man. We felt
that what was about to happen would decide the fate of Monsieur
Robert Darzac. Frédéric Larsan's face alone was radiant, showing
a joy as of a dog that had at last got its prey.</p>

<p>Pointing to the railway servant, Monsieur de Marquet said to
Monsieur Darzac:</p>

<p>"Do you recognise this man, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"I do," said Monsieur Darzac, in a tone which he vainly tried
to make firm. "He is an employé at the station at
Epinay-sur-Orge."</p>

<p>"This young man," went on Monsieur de Marquet, "affirms that
he saw you get off the train at Epinay-sur-Orge&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That night," said Monsieur Darzac, interrupting, "at
half-past ten&mdash;it is quite true."</p>

<p>An interval of silence followed.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Darzac," the magistrate went on in a tone of deep
emotion, "Monsieur Darzac, what were you doing that night, at
Epinay-sur-Orge&mdash;at that time?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Darzac remained silent, simply closing his eyes.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Darzac," insisted Monsieur de Marquet, "can you tell
me how you employed your time, that night?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Darzac opened his eyes. He seemed to have recovered
his self-control.</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Think, Monsieur! for, if you persist in your strange refusal,
I shall be under the painful necessity of keeping you at my
disposition."</p>

<p>"I refuse."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Darzac!&mdash;in the name of the law, I arrest
you!"</p>

<p>The magistrate had no sooner pronounced the words than I saw
Rouletabille move quickly towards Monsieur Darzac. He would
certainly have spoken to him, but Darzac, by a gesture, held him
off. As the gendarme approached his prisoner, a despairing cry
rang through the room:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Robert!&mdash;Robert!"</p>

<p>We recognised the voice of Mademoiselle Stangerson. We all
shuddered. Larsan himself turned pale. Monsieur Darzac, in
response to the cry, had flown back into the room.</p>

<p>The magistrate, the gendarme, and Larsan followed closely
after. Rouletabille and I remained on the threshold. It was a
heart-breaking sight that met our eyes. Mademoiselle Stangerson,
with a face of deathly pallor, had risen on her bed, in spite of
the restraining efforts of two doctors and her father. She was
holding out her trembling arms towards Robert Darzac on whom
Larsan and the gendarme had laid hands. Her distended eyes
saw&mdash;she understood&mdash;her lips seemed to form a word,
but nobody made it out; and she fell back insensible.</p>

<p>Monsieur Darzac was hurried out of the room and placed in the
vestibule to wait for the vehicle Larsan had gone to fetch. We
were all overcome by emotion and even Monsieur de Marquet had
tears in his eyes. Rouletabille took advantage of the opportunity
to say to Monsieur Darzac:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you going to put in any defense?"</p>

<p>"No!" replied the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Very well, then I will, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"You cannot do it," said the unhappy man with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>"I can&mdash;and I will."</p>

<p>Rouletabille's voice had in it a strange strength and
confidence.</p>

<p>"I can do it, Monsieur Robert Darzac, because I know more than
you do!"</p>

<p>"Come! Come!" murmured Darzac, almost angrily.</p>

<p>"Have no fear! I shall know only what will benefit you."</p>

<p>"You must know <i>nothing</i>, young man, if you want me to be
grateful."</p>

<p>Rouletabille shook his head, going close up to Darzac.</p>

<p>"Listen to what I am about to say," he said in a low tone,
"and let it give you confidence. You do not know the name of the
murderer. Mademoiselle Stangerson knows it; but only half of it;
but <i>I</i> know his two halves; <i>I</i> know the whole
man!"</p>

<p>Robert Darzac opened his eyes, with a look that showed he had
not understood a word of what Rouletabille had said to him. At
that moment the conveyance arrived, driven by Frédéric Larsan.
Darzac and the gendarme entered it, Larsan remaining on the
driver's seat. The prisoner was taken to Corbeil.</p>

<h3>Rouletabille Goes On A Journey.</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
THAT same evening Rouletabille and I left the Glandier. We
were very glad to get away and there was nothing more to keep us
there. I declared my intention to give up the whole matter. It
had been too much for me. Rouletabille, with a friendly tap on my
shoulder, confessed that he had nothing more to learn at the
Glandier; he had learned there all it had to tell him. We reached
Paris about eight o'clock, dined, and then, tired out, we
separated, agreeing to meet the next morning at my rooms.</p>

<p>Rouletabille arrived next day at the hour agreed on. He was
dressed in a suit of English tweed, with an ulster on his arm,
and a valise in his hand. Evidently he had prepared himself for a
journey.</p>

<p>"How long shall you be away?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A month or two," he said. "It all depends."</p>

<p>I asked him no more questions.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he asked, "what the word was that Mademoiselle
Stangerson tried to say before she fainted?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;nobody heard it."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> heard it!" replied Rouletabille. "She said
'Speak!'"</p>

<p>"Do you think Darzac will speak?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>I was about to make some further observations, but he wrung my
hand warmly and wished me good-bye. I had only time to ask him
one question before he left.</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid that other attempts may be made while
you're away?"</p>

<p>"No! Not now that Darzac is in prison," he answered.</p>

<p>With this strange remark he left. I was not to see him again
until the day of Darzac's trial at the court when he appeared to
explain the inexplicable.</p>

<h3>In Which Joseph Rouletabille Is Awaited With Impatience.</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
ON the 15th of January, that is to say, two months and a half
after the tragic events I have narrated, the "Epoque" printed, as
the first column of the front page, the following sensational
article:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">"The Seine-et-Oise jury is summoned to-day to
give its verdict on one of the most mysterious affairs in the
annals of crime. There never has been a case with so many
obscure, incomprehensible, and inexplicable points. And yet the
prosecution has not hesitated to put into the prisoner's dock a
man who is respected, esteemed, and loved by all who knew
him&mdash;a young savant, the hope of French science, whose whole
life has been devoted to knowledge and truth. When Paris heard of
Monsieur Robert Darzac's arrest a unanimous cry of protest arose
from all sides. The whole Sorbonne, disgraced by this act of the
examining magistrate, asserted its belief in the innocence of
Mademoiselle Stangerson's fiancé. Monsieur Stangerson was loud in
his denunciation of this miscarriage of justice. There is no
doubt in the mind of anybody that could the victim speak she
would claim from the jurors of Seine-et-Oise the man she wishes
to make her husband and whom the prosecution would send to the
scaffold. It is to be hoped that Mademoiselle Stangerson will
shortly recover her reason, which has been temporarily unhinged
by the horrible mystery at the Glandier. The question before the
jury is the one we propose to deal with this very day.</p>

<p class="quote">"We have decided not to permit twelve worthy men
to commit a disgraceful miscarriage of justice. We confess that
the remarkable coincidences, the many convicting evidences, and
the inexplicable silence on the part of the accused, as well as a
total absence of any evidence for an alibi, were enough to
warrant the bench of judges in assuming that in this man alone
was centered the truth of the affair. The evidences are, in
appearance, so overwhelming against Monsieur Robert Darzac that a
detective so well informed, so intelligent, and generally so
successful, as Monsieur Frédéric Larsan, may be excused for
having been misled by them. Up to now everything has gone against
Monsieur Robert Darzac in the magisterial inquiry. To-day,
however, <i>we</i> are going to defend him before the jury, and
we are going to bring to the witness stand a light that will
illumine the whole mystery of the Glandier. <i>For we possess the
truth.</i></p>

<p class="quote">"If we have not spoken sooner, it is because the
interests of certain parties in the case demand that we should
take that course. Our readers may remember the unsigned reports
we published relating to the 'Left foot of the Rue Oberkampf,' at
the time of the famous robbery of the Crédit Universel, and the
famous case of the 'Gold Ingots of the Mint.' In both those cases
we were able to discover the truth long before even the excellent
ingenuity of Frédéric Larsan had been able to unravel it. These
reports were written by our youngest reporter, Joseph
Rouletabille, a youth of eighteen, whose fame to-morrow will be
world-wide. When attention was first drawn to the Glandier case,
our youthful reporter was on the spot and installed in the
château, when every other representative of the press had been
denied admission. He worked side by side with Frédéric Larsan. He
was amazed and terrified at the grave mistake the celebrated
detective was about to make, and tried to divert him from the
false scent he was following; but the great Fred refused to
receive instructions from this young journalist. We know now to
where it brought Monsieur Robert Darzac.</p>

<p class="quote">"But now, France must know&mdash;the whole world
must know, that, on the very evening on which Monsieur Darzac was
arrested, young Rouletabille entered our editorial office and
informed us that he was about to go away on a journey. 'How long
I shall be away,' he said, 'I cannot say; perhaps a
month&mdash;perhaps two&mdash;perhaps three&mdash;perhaps I may
never return. Here is a letter. If I am not back on the day on
which Monsieur Darzac is to appear before the Assize Court, have
this letter opened and read to the court, after all the witnesses
have been heard. Arrange it with Monsieur Darzac's counsel.
Monsieur Darzac is innocent. In this letter is written the name
of the murderer; and&mdash;that is all I have to say. I am
leaving to get my proofs&mdash;for the irrefutable evidence of
the murderer's guilt.' Our reporter departed. For a long time we
were without news from him; but, a week ago, a stranger called
upon our manager and said: 'Act in accordance with the
instructions of Joseph Rouletabille, if it becomes necessary to
do so. The letter left by him holds the truth.' The gentleman who
brought us this message would not give us his name.</p>

<p class="quote">"To-day, the 15th of January, is the day of the
trial. Joseph Rouletabille has not returned. It may be we shall
never see him again. The press also counts its heroes, its
martyrs to duty. It may be he is no longer living. We shall know
how to avenge him. Our manager will, this afternoon, be at the
Court of Assize at Versailles, with the letter&mdash;the letter
containing the name of the murderer!"</p>

<br>

<p class="first">At the head of the article appeared a portrait
of Rouletabille&mdash;the same given as the frontispiece to this
book.</p>

<p>Those Parisians who flocked the Assize Court at Versailles, to
be present at the trial of what was known as the "Mystery of The
Yellow Room," will certainly remember the terrible crush at the
Saint-Lazare station. The ordinary trains were so full that
special trains had to be made up. The article in the "Epoque" had
so excited the populace that discussion was rife everywhere even
to the verge of blows. Partisans of Rouletabille fought with the
supporters of Frédéric Larsan. Curiously enough the excitement
was due less to the fact that an innocent man was in danger of a
wrongful conviction than to the interest taken in their own ideas
as to the Mystery of The Yellow Room. Each had his explanation to
which each held fast. Those who explained the crime on Frédéric
Larsan's theory would not admit that there could be any doubt as
to the perspicacity of the popular detective. Others who had
arrived at a different solution, naturally insisted that this was
Rouletabille's explanation, though they did not as yet know what
that was.</p>

<p>With the day's "Epoque" in their hands, the "Larsans" and the
"Rouletabilles" fought and shoved each other on the steps of the
Palais de Justice, right into the court itself. Those who could
not get in remained in the neighbourhood until evening and were,
with great difficulty, kept back by the soldiery and the police.
They became hungry for news, welcoming the most absurd rumours.
At one time the rumour spread that Monsieur Stangerson himself
had been arrested in the court and had confessed to being the
murderer. This goes to show to what a pitch of madness nervous
excitement may carry people. Rouletabille was still expected.
Some pretended to know him; and when a young man with a "pass"
crossed the open space which separated the crowd from the Court
House, a scuffle took place. Cries were raised of
"Rouletabille!&mdash;there's Rouletabille!" The arrival of the
manager of the paper was the signal for a great demonstration.
Some applauded, others hissed.</p>

<p>The trial itself was presided over by Monsieur de Rocouz, a
judge filled with the prejudice of his class, but a man honest at
heart. The witnesses had been called. I was there, of course, as
were all who had, in any way, been in touch with the mysteries of
the Glandier. Monsieur Stangerson&mdash;looking many years older
and almost unrecognisable&mdash;Larsan, Arthur Rance, with his
face ruddy as ever, Daddy Jacques, Daddy Mathieu, who was brought
into court handcuffed between two gendarmes, Madame Mathieu, in
tears, the two Berniers, the two nurses, the steward, all the
domestics of the château, the employé of the Paris Post Office,
the railway employé from Epinay, some friends of Monsieur and
Mademoiselle Stangerson, and all Monsieur Darzac's witnesses. I
was lucky enough to be called early in the trial, so that I was
then able to watch and be present at almost the whole of the
proceedings.</p>

<p>The court was so crowded that many lawyers were compelled to
find seats on the steps. Behind the bench of justices were
representatives from other benches. Monsieur Robert Darzac stood
in the prisoner's dock between policemen, tall, handsome, and
calm. A murmur of admiration rather than of compassion greeted
his appearance. He leaned forward towards his counsel, Maître
Henri Robert, who, assisted by his chief secretary, Maître André
Hesse, was busily turning over the folios of his brief.</p>

<p>Many expected that Monsieur Stangerson, after giving his
evidence, would have gone over to the prisoner and shaken hands
with him; but he left the court without another word. It was
remarked that the jurors appeared to be deeply interested in a
rapid conversation which the manager of the "Epoque" was having
with Maître Henri Robert. The manager, later, sat down in the
front row of the public seats. Some were surprised that he was
not asked to remain with the other witnesses in the room reserved
for them.</p>

<p>The reading of the indictment was got through, as it always
is, without any incident. I shall not here report the long
examination to which Monsieur Darzac was subjected. He answered
all the questions quickly and easily. His silence as to the
important matters of which we know was dead against him. It would
seem as if this reticence would be fatal for him. He resented the
President's reprimands. He was told that his silence might mean
death.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said; "I will submit to it; but I am
innocent."</p>

<p>With that splendid ability which has made his fame, Maître
Robert took advantage of the incident, and tried to show that it
brought out in noble relief his client's character; for only
heroic natures could remain silent for moral reasons in face of
such a danger. The eminent advocate however, only succeeded in
assuring those who were already assured of Darzac's innocence. At
the adjournment Rouletabille had not yet arrived. Every time a
door opened, all eyes there turned towards it and back to the
manager of the "Epoque," who sat impassive in his place. When he
once was feeling in his pocket a loud murmur of expectation
followed. The letter!</p>

<p>It is not, however, my intention to report in detail the
course of the trial. My readers are sufficiently acquainted with
the mysteries surrounding the Glandier case to enable me to go on
to the really dramatic dénouement of this ever-memorable day.</p>

<p>When the trial was resumed, Maître Henri Robert questioned
Daddy Mathieu as to his complicity in the death of the keeper.
His wife was also brought in and was confronted by her husband.
She burst into tears and confessed that she had been the keeper's
mistress, and that her husband had suspected it. She again,
however, affirmed that he had had nothing to do with the murder
of her lover. Maître Henri Robert thereupon asked the court to
hear Frédéric Larsan on this point.</p>

<p>"In a short conversation which I have had with Frédéric
Larsan, during the adjournment," declared the advocate, "he has
made me understand that the death of the keeper may have been
brought about otherwise than by the hand of Mathieu. It will be
interesting to hear Frédéric Larsan's theory."</p>

<p>Frédéric Larsan was brought in. His explanation was quite
clear.</p>

<p>"I see no necessity," he said, "for bringing Mathieu in this.
I have told Monsieur de Marquet that the man's threats had
biassed the examining magistrate against him. To me the attempt
to murder Mademoiselle and the death of the keeper are the work
of one and the same person. Mademoiselle Stangerson's murderer,
flying through the court, was fired on; it was thought he was
struck, perhaps killed. As a matter of fact, he only stumbled at
the moment of his disappearance behind the corner of the right
wing of the château. There he encountered the keeper who, no
doubt, tried to seize him. The murderer had in his hand the knife
with which he had stabbed Mademoiselle Stangerson and with this
he killed the keeper."</p>

<p>This very simple explanation appeared at once plausible and
satisfying. A murmur of approbation was heard.</p>

<p>"And the murderer? What became of him?" asked the
President.</p>

<p>"He was evidently hidden in an obscure corner at the end of
the court. After the people had left the court carrying with them
the body of the keeper, the murderer quietly made his
escape."</p>

<p>The words had scarcely left Larsan's mouth when from the back
of the court came a youthful voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I agree with Frédéric Larsan as to the death of the keeper;
but I do not agree with him as to the way the murderer
escaped!"</p>

<p>Everybody turned round, astonished. The clerks of the court
sprang towards the speaker, calling out silence, and the
President angrily ordered the intruder to be immediately
expelled. The same clear voice, however, was again
heard:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is I, Monsieur President&mdash;Joseph Rouletabille!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3>In Which Joseph Rouletabille Appears In All His Glory.</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
THE excitement was extreme. Cries from fainting women were to
be heard amid the extraordinary bustle and stir. The "majesty of
the law" was utterly forgotten. The President tried in vain to
make himself heard. Rouletabille made his way forward with
difficulty, but by dint of much elbowing reached his manager and
greeted him cordially. The letter was passed to him and pocketing
it he turned to the witness-box. He was dressed exactly as on the
day he left me even to the ulster over his arm. Turning to the
President, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Monsieur President, but I have only just
arrived from America. The steamer was late. My name is Joseph
Rouletabille!"</p>

<p>The silence which followed his stepping into the witness-box
was broken by laughter when his words were heard. Everybody
seemed relieved and glad to find him there, as if in the
expectation of hearing the truth at last.</p>

<p>But the President was extremely incensed:</p>

<p>"So, you are Joseph Rouletabille," he replied; "well, young
man, I'll teach you what comes of making a farce of justice. By
virtue of my discretionary power, I hold you at the court's
disposition."</p>

<p>"I ask nothing better, Monsieur President. I have come here
for that purpose. I humbly beg the court's pardon for the
disturbance of which I have been the innocent cause. I beg you to
believe that nobody has a greater respect for the court than I
have. I came in as I could." He smiled.</p>

<p>"Take him away!" ordered the President.</p>

<p>Maître Henri Robert intervened. He began by apologising for
the young man, who, he said, was moved only by the best
intentions. He made the President understand that the evidence of
a witness who had slept at the Glandier during the whole of that
eventful week could not be omitted, and the present witness,
moreover, had come to name the real murderer.</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell us who the murderer was?" asked the
President, somewhat convinced though still sceptical.</p>

<p>"I have come for that purpose, Monsieur President!" replied
Rouletabille.</p>

<p>An attempt at applause was silenced by the usher.</p>

<p>"Joseph Rouletabille," said Maître Henri Robert, "has not been
regularly subpoenaed as a witness, but I hope, Monsieur
President, you will examine him in virtue of your discretionary
powers."</p>

<p>"Very well!" said the President, "we will question him. But we
must proceed in order."</p>

<p>The Advocate-General rose:</p>

<p>"It would, perhaps, be better," he said, "if the young man
were to tell us now whom he suspects."</p>

<p>The President nodded ironically:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If the Advocate-General attaches importance to the deposition
of Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille, I see no reason why this witness
should not give us the name of the murderer."</p>

<p>A pin drop could have been heard. Rouletabille stood silent
looking sympathetically at Darzac, who, for the first time since
the opening of the trial, showed himself agitated.</p>

<p>"Well," cried the President, "we wait for the name of the
murderer."</p>

<p>Rouletabille, feeling in his waistcoat pocket, drew his watch
and, looking at it, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Monsieur President, I cannot name the murderer before
half-past six o'clock!"</p>

<p>Loud murmurs of disappointment filled the room. Some of the
lawyers were heard to say: "He's making fun of us!"</p>

<p>The President in a stern voice, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This joke has gone far enough. You may retire, Monsieur, into
the witnesses' room. I hold you at our disposition."</p>

<p>Rouletabille protested.</p>

<p>"I assure you, Monsieur President," he cried in his sharp,
clear voice, "that when I do name the murderer you will
understand why I could not speak before half-past six. I assert
this on my honour. I can, however, give you now some explanation
of the murder of the keeper. Monsieur Frédéric Larsan, who has
seen me at work at the Glandier, can tell you with what care I
studied this case. I found myself compelled to differ with him in
arresting Monsieur Robert Darzac, who is innocent. Monsieur
Larsan knows of my good faith and knows that some importance may
be attached to my discoveries, which have often corroborated his
own."</p>

<p>Frédéric Larsan said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Monsieur President, it will be interesting to hear Monsieur
Joseph Rouletabille, especially as he differs from me."</p>

<p>A murmur of approbation greeted the detective's speech. He was
a good sportsman and accepted the challenge. The struggle between
the two promised to be exciting.</p>

<p>As the President remained silent, Frédéric Larsan
continued:</p>

<p>"We agree that the murderer of the keeper was the assailant of
Mademoiselle Stangerson; but as we are not agreed as to how the
murderer escaped, I am curious to hear Monsieur Rouletabille's
explanation."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you are," said my friend.</p>

<p>General laughter followed this remark. The President angrily
declared that if it was repeated, he would have the court
cleared.</p>

<p>"Now, young man," said the President, "you have heard Monsieur
Frédéric Larsan; how did the murderer get away from the
court?"</p>

<p>Rouletabille looked at Madame Mathieu, who smiled back at him
sadly.</p>

<p>"Since Madame Mathieu," he said, "has freely admitted her
intimacy with the keeper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, it's the boy!" exclaimed Daddy Mathieu.</p>

<p>"Remove that man!" ordered the President.</p>

<p>Mathieu was removed from the court. Rouletabille went
on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Since she has made this confession, I am free to tell you
that she often met the keeper at night on the first floor of the
donjon, in the room which was once an oratory. These meetings
became more frequent when her husband was laid up by his
rheumatism. She gave him morphine to ease his pain and to give
herself more time for the meetings. Madame Mathieu came to the
château that night, enveloped in a large black shawl which served
also as a disguise. This was the phantom that disturbed Daddy
Jacques. She knew how to imitate the mewing of Mother Angenoux'
cat and she would make the cries to advise the keeper of her
presence. The recent repairs of the donjon did not interfere with
their meetings in the keeper's old room, in the donjon, since the
new room assigned to him at the end of the right wing was
separated from the steward's room by a partition only.</p>

<p>"Previous to the tragedy in the court Madame Mathieu and the
keeper left the donjon together. I learnt these facts from my
examination of the footmarks in the court the next morning.
Bernier, the concierge, whom I had stationed behind the
donjon&mdash;as he will explain himself&mdash;could not see what
passed in the court. He did not reach the court until he heard
the revolver shots, and then he fired. When the woman parted from
the man she went towards the open gate of the court, while he
returned to his room.</p>

<p>"He had almost reached the door when the revolvers rang out.
He had just reached the corner when a shadow bounded by.
Meanwhile, Madame Mathieu, surprised by the revolver shots and by
the entrance of people into the court, crouched in the darkness.
The court is a large one and, being near the gate, she might
easily have passed out unseen. But she remained and saw the body
being carried away. In great agony of mind she neared the
vestibule and saw the dead body of her lover on the stairs lit up
by Daddy Jacques' lantern. She then fled; and Daddy Jacques
joined her.</p>

<p>"That same night, before the murder, Daddy Jacques had been
awakened by the cat's cry, and, looking through his window, had
seen the black phantom. Hastily dressing himself he went out and
recognised her. He is an old friend of Madame Mathieu, and when
she saw him she had to tell him of her relations with the keeper
and begged his assistance. Daddy Jacques took pity on her and
accompanied her through the oak grove out of the park, past the
border of the lake to the road to Epinay. From there it was but a
very short distance to her home.</p>

<p>"Daddy Jacques returned to the château, and, seeing how
important it was for Madame Mathieu's presence at the château to
remain unknown, he had done all he could to hide it. I appeal to
Monsieur Larsan, who saw me, next morning, examine the two sets
of footprints."</p>

<p>Here Rouletabille turning towards Madame Mathieu, with a bow,
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The footprints of Madame bear a strange resemblance to the
neat footprints of the murderer."</p>

<p>Madame Mathieu trembled and looked at him with wide eyes as if
in wonder at what he would say next.</p>

<p>"Madame has a shapely foot, long and rather large for a woman.
The imprint, with its pointed toe, is very like that of the
murderer's."</p>

<p>A movement in the court was repressed by Rouletabille. He held
their attention at once.</p>

<p>"I hasten to add," he went on, "that I attach no importance to
this. Outward signs like these are often liable to lead us into
error, if we do not reason rightly. Monsieur Robert Darzac's
footprints are also like the murderer's, and yet he is not the
murderer!"</p>

<p>The President turning to Madame Mathieu asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is that in accordance with what you know occurred?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur President," she replied, "it is as if Monsieur
Rouletabille had been behind us."</p>

<p>"Did you see the murderer running towards the end of the right
wing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as clearly as I saw them afterwards carrying the
keeper's body."</p>

<p>"What became of the murderer?&mdash;You were in the court and
could easily have seen?"</p>

<p>"I saw nothing of him, Monsieur President. It became quite
dark just then."</p>

<p>"Then Monsieur Rouletabille," said the President, "must
explain how the murderer made his escape."</p>

<p>Rouletabille continued:</p>

<p>"It was impossible for the murderer to escape by the way he
had entered the court without our seeing him; or if we couldn't
see him we must certainly have felt him, since the court is a
very narrow one enclosed in high iron railings."</p>

<p>"Then if the man was hemmed in that narrow square, how is it
you did not find him?&mdash;I have been asking you that for the
last half hour."</p>

<p>"Monsieur President," replied Rouletabille, "I cannot answer
that question before half-past six!"</p>

<p>By this time the people in the court-room were beginning to
believe in this new witness. They were amused by his melodramatic
action in thus fixing the hour; but they seemed to have
confidence in the outcome. As for the President, it looked as if
he also had made up his mind to take the young man in the same
way. He had certainly been impressed by Rouletabille's
explanation of Madame Mathieu's part.</p>

<p>"Well, Monsieur Rouletabille," he said, "as you say; but don't
let us see any more of you before half-past six."</p>

<p>Rouletabille bowed to the President, and made his way to the
door of the witnesses' room.</p>

<p>I quietly made my way through the crowd and left the court
almost at the same time as Rouletabille. He greeted me heartily,
and looked happy.</p>

<p>"I'll not ask you, my dear fellow," I said, smiling, "what
you've been doing in America; because I've no doubt you'll say
you can't tell me until after half-past six."</p>

<p>"No, my dear Sainclair, I'll tell you right now why I went to
America. I went in search of the name of the <i>other half</i> of
the murderer!"</p>

<p>"The name of the other half?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. When we last left the Glandier I knew there were two
halves to the murderer and the name of only one of them. I went
to America for the name of the other half."</p>

<p>I was too puzzled to answer. Just then we entered the
witnesses' room, and Rouletabille was immediately surrounded. He
showed himself very friendly to all except Arthur Rance to whom
he exhibited a marked coldness of manner. Frédéric Larsan came in
also. Rouletabille went up and shook him heartily by the hand.
His manner toward the detective showed that he had got the better
of the policeman. Larsan smiled and asked him what he had been
doing in America. Rouletabille began by telling him some
anecdotes of his voyage. They then turned aside together
apparently with the object of speaking confidentially. I,
therefore, discreetly left them and, being curious to hear the
evidence, returned to my seat in the court-room where the public
plainly showed its lack of interest in what was going on in their
impatience for Rouletabille's return at the appointed time.</p>

<p>On the stroke of half-past six Joseph Rouletabille was again
brought in. It is impossible for me to picture the tense
excitement which appeared on every face, as he made his way to
the bar. Darzac rose to his feet, frightfully pale.</p>

<p>The President, addressing Rouletabille, said
gravely:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will not ask you to take the oath, because you have not
been regularly summoned; but I trust there is no need to urge
upon you the gravity of the statement you are about to make."</p>

<p>Rouletabille looked the President quite calmly and steadily in
the face, and replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"At your last appearance here," said the President, "we had
arrived at the point where you were to tell us how the murderer
escaped, and also his name. Now, Monsieur Rouletabille, we await
your explanation."</p>

<p>"Very well, Monsieur," began my friend amidst a profound
silence. "I had explained how it was impossible for the murderer
to get away without being seen. And yet he was there with us in
the court."</p>

<p>"And you did not see him? At least that is what the
prosecution declares."</p>

<p>"No! we all of us saw him, Monsieur le Président!" cried
Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"Then why was he not arrested?"</p>

<p>"Because no one, besides myself, knew that he was the
murderer. It would have spoiled my plans to have had him
arrested, and I had then no proof other than my own reasoning. I
was convinced we had the murderer before us and that we were
actually looking at him. I have now brought what I consider the
indisputable proof."</p>

<p>"Speak out, Monsieur! Tell us the murderer's name."</p>

<p>"You will find it on the list of names present in the court on
the night of the tragedy," replied Rouletabille.</p>

<p>The people present in the court-room began showing impatience.
Some of them even called for the name, and were silenced by the
usher.</p>

<p>"The list includes Daddy Jacques, Bernier the concierge, and
Mr. Arthur Rance," said the President. "Do you accuse any of
these?"</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur!"</p>

<p>"Then I do not understand what you are driving at. There was
no other person at the end of the court."</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur, there was, not at the end, but above the
court, who was leaning out of the window."</p>

<p>"Do you mean Frédéric Larsan!" exclaimed the President.</p>

<p>"Yes! Frédéric Larsan!" replied Rouletabille in a ringing
tone. "Frédéric Larsan is the murderer!"</p>

<p>The court-room became immediately filled with loud and
indignant protests. So astonished was he that the President did
not attempt to quiet it. The quick silence which followed was
broken by the distinctly whispered words from the lips of Robert
Darzac:</p>

<p>"It's impossible! He's mad!"</p>

<p>"You dare to accuse Frédéric Larsan, Monsieur?" asked the
President. "If you are not mad, what are your proofs?"</p>

<p>"Proofs, Monsieur?&mdash;Do you want proofs? Well, here is
one," cried Rouletabille shrilly. "Let Frédéric Larsan be
called!"</p>

<p>"Usher, call Frédéric Larsan."</p>

<p>The usher hurried to the side door, opened it, and
disappeared. The door remained open, while all eyes turned
expectantly towards it. The clerk re-appeared and, stepping
forward, said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur President, Frédéric Larsan is not here. He left at
about four o'clock and has not been seen since."</p>

<p>"That is my proof!" cried Rouletabille, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Explain yourself?" demanded the President.</p>

<p>"My proof is Larsan's flight," said the young reporter. "He
will not come back. You will see no more of Frédéric Larsan."</p>

<p>"Unless you are playing with the court, Monsieur, why did you
not accuse him when he was present? He would then have answered
you."</p>

<p>"He could give no other answer than the one he has now given
by his flight."</p>

<p>"We cannot believe that Larsan has fled. There was no reason
for his doing so. Did he know you'd make this charge?"</p>

<p>"He <i>did</i>. I told him I would."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that knowing Larsan was the murderer you
gave him the opportunity to escape?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur President, I did," replied Rouletabille,
proudly. "I am not a policeman, I am a journalist; and my
business is not to arrest people. My business is in the service
of truth, and is not that of an executioner. If you are just,
Monsieur, you will see that I am right. You can now understand
why I refrained until this hour to divulge the name. I gave
Larsan time to catch the 4-17 train for Paris, where he would
know where to hide himself, and leave no traces. You will not
find Frédéric Larsan," declared Rouletabille, fixing his eyes on
Monsieur Robert Darzac. "He is too cunning. He is a man who has
<i>always</i> escaped you and whom you have long searched for in
vain. If he did not succeed in outwitting me, he can yet easily
outwit any police. This man who, four years ago, introduced
himself to the Sûreté, and became celebrated as Frédéric Larsan,
is notorious under another name&mdash;a name well known to crime.
Frédéric Larsan, Monsieur President, is Ballmeyer!"</p>

<p>"Ballmeyer!" cried the President.</p>

<p>"Ballmeyer!" exclaimed Robert Darzac, springing to his feet.
"Ballmeyer!&mdash;It was true, then!"</p>

<p>"Ah! Monsieur Darzac; you don't think I am mad, now!" cried
Rouletabille.</p>

<p>Ballmeyer! Ballmeyer! No other word could be heard in the
court-room. The President adjourned the hearing.</p>

<p>Those of my readers who may not have heard of Ballmeyer will
wonder at the excitement the name caused. And yet the doings of
this remarkable criminal form the subject-matter of the most
dramatic narratives of the newspapers and criminal records of the
past twenty years. It had been reported that he was dead, and
thus had eluded the police as he had eluded them throughout the
whole of his career.</p>

<p>Ballmeyer was the best specimen of the high-class "gentleman
swindler." He was an adept at sleight of hand tricks, and no
bolder or more ruthless crook ever lived. He was received in the
best society, and was a member of some of the most exclusive
clubs. On many of his depredatory expeditions he had not
hesitated to use the knife and the mutton-bone. No difficulty
stopped him and no "operation" was too dangerous. He had been
caught, but escaped on the very morning of his trial, by throwing
pepper into the eyes of the guards who were conducting him to
Court. It was known later that, in spite of the keen hunt after
him by the most expert of detectives, he had sat that same
evening at a first performance in the Théâtre Français, without
the slightest disguise.</p>

<p>He left France, later, to "work" America. The police there
succeeded in once capturing him, but the extraordinary man
escaped the next day. It would need a volume to recount the
adventures of this master-criminal. And yet this was the man
Rouletabille had allowed to get away! Knowing all about him and
who he was, he afforded the criminal an opportunity for another
laugh at the society he had defied! I could not help admiring the
bold stroke of the young journalist, because I felt certain his
motive had been to protect both Mademoiselle Stangerson and rid
Darzac of an enemy at the same time.</p>

<p>The crowd had barely recovered from the effect of the
astonishing revelation when the hearing was resumed. The question
in everybody's mind was: Admitting that Larsan was the murderer,
how did he get out of The Yellow Room?</p>

<p>Rouletabille was immediately called to the bar and his
examination continued.</p>

<p>"You have told us," said the President, "that it was
impossible to escape from the end of the court. Since Larsan was
leaning out of his window, he had left the court. How did he do
that?"</p>

<p>"He escaped by a most unusual way. He climbed the wall, sprang
onto the terrace, and, while we were engaged with the keeper's
body, reached the gallery by the window. He then had little else
to do than to open the window, get in and call out to us, as if
he had just come from his own room. To a man of Ballmeyer's
strength all that was mere child's play. And here, Monsieur, is
the proof of what I say."</p>

<p>Rouletabille drew from his pocket a small packet, from which
he produced a strong iron peg.</p>

<p>"This, Monsieur," he said, "is a spike which perfectly fits a
hole still to be seen in the cornice supporting the terrace.
Larsan, who thought and prepared for everything in case of any
emergency, had fixed this spike into the cornice. All he had to
do to make his escape good was to plant one foot on a stone which
is placed at the corner of the château, another on this support,
one hand on the cornice of the keeper's door and the other on the
terrace, and Larsan was clear of the ground. The rest was easy.
His acting after dinner as if he had been drugged was make
believe. He was not drugged; but he did drug me. Of course he had
to make it appear as if he also had been drugged so that no
suspicion should fall on him for my condition. Had I not been
thus overpowered, Larsan would never have entered Mademoiselle
Stangerson's chamber that night, and the attack on her would not
have taken place."</p>

<p>A groan came from Darzac, who appeared to be unable to control
his suffering.</p>

<p>"You can understand," added Rouletabille, "that Larsan would
feel himself hampered from the fact that my room was so close to
his, and from a suspicion that I would be on the watch that
night. Naturally, he could not for a moment believe that I
suspected <i>him!</i> But I might see him leaving his room when
he was about to go to Mademoiselle Stangerson. He waited till I
was asleep, and my friend Sainclair was busy trying to rouse me.
Ten minutes after that Mademoiselle was calling out,
'Murder!'"</p>

<p>"How did you come to suspect Larsan?" asked the President.</p>

<p>"My pure reason pointed to him. That was why I watched him.
But I did not foresee the drugging. He is very cunning. Yes, my
pure reason pointed to him; but I required tangible proof so that
my eyes could see him as my pure reason saw him."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by your pure reason?"</p>

<p>"That power of one's mind which admits of no disturbing
elements to a conclusion. The day following the incident of 'the
inexplicable gallery,' I felt myself losing control of it. I had
allowed myself to be diverted by fallacious evidence; but I
recovered and again took hold of the right end. I satisfied
myself that the murderer could not have left the gallery, either
naturally or supernaturally. I narrowed the field of
consideration to that small circle, so to speak. The murderer
could not be outside that circle. Now who were in it? There was,
first, the murderer. Then there were Daddy Jacques, Monsieur
Stangerson, Frédéric Larsan, and myself. Five persons in all,
counting in the murderer. And yet, in the gallery, there were but
four. Now since it had been demonstrated to me that the fifth
could not have escaped, it was evident that one of the four
present in the gallery must be a double&mdash;he must be himself
and the murderer also. Why had I not seen this before? Simply
because the phenomenon of the double personality had not occurred
before in this inquiry.</p>

<p>"Now who of the four persons in the gallery was both that
person and the assassin? I went over in my mind what I had seen.
I had seen at one and the same time, Monsieur Stangerson and the
murderer, Daddy Jacques and the murderer, myself and the
murderer; so that the murderer, then, could not be either
Monsieur Stangerson, Daddy Jacques, or myself. Had I seen
Frédéric Larsan and the murderer at the same
time?&mdash;No!&mdash;Two seconds had passed, during which I lost
sight of the murderer; for, as I have noted in my papers, he
arrived two seconds before Monsieur Stangerson, Daddy Jacques,
and myself at the meeting-point of the two galleries. That would
have given Larsan time to go through the 'off-turning' gallery,
snatch off his false beard, return, and hurry with us as if, like
us, in pursuit of the murderer. I was sure now I had got hold of
the right end in my reasoning. With Frédéric Larsan was now
always associated, in my mind, the personality of the unknown of
whom I was in pursuit&mdash;the murderer, in other words.</p>

<p>"That revelation staggered me. I tried to regain my balance by
going over the evidences previously traced, but which had
diverted my mind and led me away from Frédéric Larsan. What were
these evidences?</p>

<p>"1st. I had seen the unknown in Mademoiselle Stangerson's
chamber. On going to Frédéric Larsan's room, I had found Larsan
sound asleep.</p>

<p>"2nd. The ladder.</p>

<p>"3rd. I had placed Frédéric Larsan at the end of the
'off-turning' gallery and had told him that I would rush into
Mademoiselle Stangerson's room to try to capture the murderer.
Then I returned to Mademoiselle Stangerson's chamber where I had
seen the unknown.</p>

<p>"The first evidence did not disturb me much. It is likely
that, when I descended from my ladder, after having seen the
unknown in Mademoiselle Stangerson's chamber, Larsan had already
finished what he was doing there. Then, while I was re-entering
the château, Larsan went back to his own room and, undressing
himself, went to sleep.</p>

<p>"Nor did the second evidence trouble me. If Larsan were the
murderer, he could have no use for a ladder; but the ladder might
have been placed there to give an appearance to the murderer's
entrance from without the château; especially as Larsan had
accused Darzac and Darzac was not in the château that night.
Further, the ladder might have been placed there to facilitate
Larsan's flight in case of absolute necessity.</p>

<p>"But the third evidence puzzled me altogether. Having placed
Larsan at the end of the 'off-turning gallery,' I could not
explain how he had taken advantage of the moment when I had gone
to the left wing of the château to find Monsieur Stangerson and
Daddy Jacques, to return to Mademoiselle Stangerson's room. It
was a very dangerous thing to do. He risked being
captured,&mdash;and he knew it. And he was very nearly captured.
He had not had time to regain his post, as he had certainly hoped
to do. He had then a very strong reason for returning to his
room. As for myself, when I sent Daddy Jacques to the end of the
'right gallery,' I naturally thought that Larsan was still at his
post. Daddy Jacques, in going to his post, had not looked, when
he passed, to see whether Larsan was at <i>his</i> post or
not.</p>

<p>"What, then, was the urgent reason which had compelled Larsan
to go to the room a second time? I guessed it to be some evidence
of his presence there. He had left something very important in
that room. What was it? And had he recovered it? I begged Madame
Bernier who was accustomed to clean the room to look, and she
found a pair of eye-glasses&mdash;this pair, Monsieur
President!"</p>

<p>And Rouletabille drew the eye-glasses, of which we know, from
his pocket.</p>

<p>"When I saw these eye-glasses," he continued, "I was utterly
nonplussed. I had never seen Larsan wear eye-glasses. What did
they mean? Suddenly I exclaimed to myself: 'I wonder if he is
long-sighted?' I had never seen Larsan write. He might, then, be
<i>long-sighted</i>. They would certainly know at the Sûreté, and
also know if the glasses were his. Such evidence would be
damning. That explained Larsan's return. I know now that Larsan,
or Ballmeyer, is long-sighted and that these glasses belonged to
him.</p>

<p>"I now made one mistake. I was not satisfied with the evidence
I had obtained. I wished to see the man's face. Had I refrained
from this, the second terrible attack would not have
occurred."</p>

<p>"But," asked the President, "why should Larsan go to
Mademoiselle Stangerson's room, at all? Why should he twice
attempt to murder her?"</p>

<p>"Because he loves her, Monsieur President."</p>

<p>"That is certainly a reason, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is the only reason. He was madly in love, and because of
that, and&mdash;other things, he was capable of committing any
crime."</p>

<p>"Did Mademoiselle Stangerson know this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur; but she was ignorant of the fact that the man
who was pursuing her was Frédéric Larsan, otherwise, of course,
he would not have been allowed to be at the château. I noticed,
when he was in her room after the incident in the gallery, that
he kept himself in the shadow, and that he kept his head bent
down. He was looking for the lost eye-glasses. Mademoiselle
Stangerson knew Larsan under another name."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Darzac," asked the President, "did Mademoiselle
Stangerson in any way confide in you on this matter? How is it
that she has never spoken about it to anyone? If you are
innocent, she would have wished to spare you the pain of being
accused."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Stangerson told me nothing," replied Monsieur
Darzac.</p>

<p>"Does what this young man say appear probable to you?" the
President asked.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Stangerson has told me nothing," he replied
stolidly.</p>

<p>"How do you explain that, on the night of the murder of the
keeper," the President asked, turning to Rouletabille, "the
murderer brought back the papers stolen from Monsieur
Stangerson?&mdash;How do you explain how the murderer gained
entrance into Mademoiselle Stangerson's locked room?"</p>

<p>"The last question is easily answered. A man like Larsan, or
Ballmeyer, could have had made duplicate keys. As to the
documents, I <i>think</i> Larsan had not intended to steal them,
at first. Closely watching Mademoiselle with the purpose of
preventing her marriage with Monsieur Robert Darzac, he one day
followed her and Monsieur into the Grands Magasins de la Louvre.
There he got possession of the reticule which she lost, or left
behind. In that reticule was a key with a brass head. He did not
know there was any value attached to the key till the
advertisement in the newspapers revealed it. He then wrote to
Mademoiselle, as the advertisement requested. No doubt he asked
for a meeting, making known to her that he was also the person
who had for some time pursued her with his love. He received no
answer. He went to the Post Office and ascertained that his
letter was no longer there. He had already taken complete stock
of Monsieur Darzac, and, having decided to go to any lengths to
gain Mademoiselle Stangerson, he had planned that, whatever might
happen, Monsieur Darzac, his hated rival, should be the man to be
suspected.</p>

<p>"I do not think that Larsan had as yet thought of murdering
Mademoiselle Stangerson; but whatever he might do, he made sure
that Monsieur Darzac should suffer for it. He was very nearly of
the same height as Monsieur Darzac and had almost the same sized
feet. It would not be difficult, to take an impression of
Monsieur Darzac's footprints, and have similar boots made for
himself. Such tricks were mere child's play for Larsan, or
Ballmeyer.</p>

<p>"Receiving no reply to his letter, he determined, since
Mademoiselle Stangerson would not come to him, that he would go
to her. His plan had long been formed. He had made himself master
of the plans of the château and the pavilion. So that, one
afternoon, while Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson were out
for a walk, and while Daddy Jacques was away, he entered the
latter by the vestibule window. He was alone, and, being in no
hurry, he began examining the furniture. One of the pieces,
resembling a safe, had a very small key-hole. That interested
him! He had with him the little key with the brass head, and,
associating one with the other, he tried the key in the lock. The
door opened. He saw nothing but papers. They must be very
valuable to have been put away in a safe, and the key to which to
be of so much importance. Perhaps a thought of blackmail occurred
to him as a useful possibility in helping him in his designs on
Mademoiselle Stangerson. He quickly made a parcel of the papers
and took it to the lavatory in the vestibule. Between the time of
his first examination of the pavilion and the night of the murder
of the keeper, Larsan had had time to find out what those papers
contained. He could do nothing with them, and they were rather
compromising. That night he took them back to the château.
Perhaps he hoped that, by returning the papers he might obtain
some gratitude from Mademoiselle Stangerson. But whatever may
have been his reasons, he took the papers back and so rid himself
of an encumbrance."</p>

<p>Rouletabille coughed. It was evident to me that he was
embarrassed. He had arrived at a point where he had to keep back
his knowledge of Larsan's true motive. The explanation he had
given had evidently been unsatisfactory. Rouletabille was quick
enough to note the bad impression he had made, for, turning to
the President, he said: "And now we come to the explanation of
the Mystery of The Yellow Room!"</p>

<p>A movement of chairs in the court with a rustling of dresses
and an energetic whispering of "Hush!" showed the curiosity that
had been aroused.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said the President, "that the Mystery of The
Yellow Room, Monsieur Rouletabille, is wholly explained by your
hypothesis. Frédéric Larsan is the explanation. We have merely to
substitute him for Monsieur Robert Darzac. Evidently the door of
The Yellow Room was open at the time Monsieur Stangerson was
alone, and that he allowed the man who was coming out of his
daughter's chamber to pass without arresting him&mdash;perhaps at
her entreaty to avoid all scandal."</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur President," protested the young man. "You forget
that, stunned by the attack made on her, Mademoiselle Stangerson
was not in a condition to have made such an appeal. Nor could she
have locked and bolted herself in her room. You must also
remember that Monsieur Stangerson has sworn that the door was not
open."</p>

<p>"That, however, is the only way in which it can be explained.
The Yellow Room was as closely shut as an iron safe. To use your
own expression, it was impossible for the murderer to make his
escape either naturally or supernaturally. When the room was
broken into he was not there! He must, therefore, have
escaped."</p>

<p>"That does not follow."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"There was no need for him to escape&mdash;if he was not
there!"</p>

<p>"Not there!"</p>

<p>"Evidently, not. He <i>could not</i> have been there, if he
were not found there."</p>

<p>"But, what about the evidences of his presence?" asked the
President.</p>

<p>"That, Monsieur President, is where we have taken hold of the
wrong end. From the time Mademoiselle Stangerson shut herself in
her room to the time her door was burst open, it was impossible
for the murderer to escape. He was not found because he was not
there during that time."</p>

<p>"But the evidences?"</p>

<p>"They have led us astray. In reasoning on this mystery we must
not take them to mean what they apparently mean. Why do we
conclude the murderer was there?&mdash;Because he left his tracks
in the room? Good! But may he not have been there <i>before</i>
the room was locked. Nay, he <i>must</i> have been there before!
Let us look into the matter of these traces and see if they do
not point to my conclusion.</p>

<p>"After the publication of the article in the 'Matin' and my
conversation with the examining magistrate on the journey from
Paris to Epinay-sur-Orge, I was certain that The Yellow Room had
been hermetically sealed, so to speak, and that consequently the
murderer had escaped before Mademoiselle Stangerson had gone into
her chamber at midnight.</p>

<p>"At the time I was much puzzled. Mademoiselle Stangerson could
not have been her own murderer, since the evidences pointed to
some other person. The assassin, then, had come <i>before</i>. If
that were so, how was it that Mademoiselle had been attacked
<i>after?</i> or rather, that she appeared to have been attacked
after? It was necessary for me to reconstruct the occurrence and
make of it two phases&mdash;each separated from the other, in
time, by the space of several hours. One phase in which
Mademoiselle Stangerson had really been attacked&mdash;the other
phase in which those who heard her cries <i>thought</i> she was
being attacked. I had not then examined The Yellow Room. What
were the marks on Mademoiselle Stangerson? There were marks of
strangulation and the wound from a hard blow on the temple. The
marks of strangulation did not interest me much; they might have
been made <i>before</i>, and Mademoiselle Stangerson could have
concealed them by a collarette, or any similar article of
apparel. I had to suppose this the moment I was compelled to
reconstruct the occurrence by two phases. Mademoiselle Stangerson
had, no doubt, her own reasons for so doing, since she had told
her father nothing of it, and had made it understood to the
examining magistrate that the attack had taken place in the
night, during the second phase. She was forced to say that,
otherwise her father would have questioned her as to her reason
for having said nothing about it.</p>

<p>"But I could not explain the blow on the temple. I understood
it even less when I learned that the mutton-bone had been found
in her room. She could not hide the fact that she had been struck
on the head, and yet that wound appeared evidently to have been
inflicted during the first phase, since it required the presence
of the murderer! I thought Mademoiselle Stangerson had hidden the
wound by arranging her hair in bands on her forehead.</p>

<p>"As to the mark of the hand on the wall, that had evidently
been made during the first phase&mdash;when the murderer was
really there. All the traces of his presence had naturally been
left during the first phase; the mutton-bone, the black
footprints, the Basque cap, the handkerchief, the blood on the
wall, on the door, and on the floor. If those traces were still
all there, they showed that Mademoiselle Stangerson&mdash;who
desired that nothing should be known&mdash;had not yet had time
to clear them away. This led me to the conclusion that the two
phases had taken place one shortly after the other. She had not
had the opportunity, after leaving her room and going back to the
laboratory to her father, to get back again to her room and put
it in order. Her father was all the time with her, working. So
that after the first phase she did not re-enter her chamber till
midnight. Daddy Jacques was there at ten o'clock, as he was every
night; but he went in merely to close the blinds and light the
night-light. Owing to her disturbed state of mind she had
forgotten that Daddy Jacques would go into her room and had
begged him not to trouble himself. All this was set forth in the
article in the 'Matin.' Daddy Jacques did go, however, and, in
the dim light of the room, saw nothing.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Stangerson must have lived some anxious moments
while Daddy Jacques was absent; but I think she was not aware
that so many evidences had been left. After she had been attacked
she had only time to hide the traces of the man's fingers on her
neck and to hurry to the laboratory. Had she known of the bone,
the cap, and the handkerchief, she would have made away with them
after she had gone back to her chamber at midnight. She did not
see them, and undressed by the uncertain glimmer of the night
light. She went to bed, worn-out by anxiety and fear&mdash;a fear
that had made her remain in the laboratory as late as
possible.</p>

<p>"My reasoning had thus brought me to the second phase of the
tragedy, when Mademoiselle Stangerson was <i>alone</i> in the
room. I had now to explain the revolver shots fired during the
second phase. Cries of 'Help!&mdash;Murder!' had been heard. How
to explain these? As to the cries, I was in no difficulty; since
she was alone in her room these could result from nightmare only.
My explanation of the struggle and noise that were heard is
simply that in her nightmare she was haunted by the terrible
experience she had passed through in the afternoon. In her dream
she sees the murderer about to spring upon her and she cries,
'Help! Murder!' Her hand wildly seeks the revolver she had placed
within her reach on the night-table by the side of her bed, but
her hand, striking the table, overturns it, and the revolver,
falling to the floor, discharges itself, the bullet lodging in
the ceiling. I knew from the first that the bullet in the ceiling
must have resulted from an accident. Its very position suggested
an accident to my mind, and so fell in with my theory of a
nightmare. I no longer doubted that the attack had taken place
before Mademoiselle had retired for the night. After wakening
from her frightful dream and crying aloud for help, she had
fainted.</p>

<p>"My theory, based on the evidence of the shots that were heard
at midnight, demanded two shots&mdash;one which wounded the
murderer at the time of his attack, and one fired at the time of
the nightmare. The evidence given by the Berniers before the
examining magistrate was to the effect that only one shot had
been heard. Monsieur Stangerson testified to hearing a dull sound
first followed by a sharp ringing sound. The dull sound I
explained by the falling of the marble-topped table; the ringing
sound was the shot from the revolver. I was now convinced I was
right. The shot that had wounded the hand of the murderer and had
caused it to bleed so that he left the bloody imprint on the wall
was fired by Mademoiselle in self-defence, before the second
phase, when she had been really attacked. The shot in the ceiling
which the Berniers heard was the accidental shot during the
nightmare.</p>

<p>"I had now to explain the wound on the temple. It was not
severe enough to have been made by means of the mutton-bone, and
Mademoiselle had not attempted to hide it. It must have been made
during the second phase. It was to find this out that I went to
The Yellow Room, and I obtained my answer there."</p>

<p>Rouletabille drew a piece of white folded paper from his
pocket, and drew out of it an almost invisible object which he
held between his thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>"This, Monsieur President," he said, "is a hair&mdash;a blond
hair stained with blood;&mdash;it is a hair from the head of
Mademoiselle Stangerson. I found it sticking to one of the
corners of the overturned table. The corner of the table was
itself stained with blood&mdash;a tiny stain&mdash;hardly
visible; but it told me that, on rising from her bed,
Mademoiselle Stangerson had fallen heavily and had struck her
head on the corner of its marble top.</p>

<p>"I had still to learn, in addition to the name of the
assassin, which I did later, the time of the original attack. I
learned this from the examination of Mademoiselle Stangerson and
her father, though the answers given by the former were well
calculated to deceive the examining magistrate. Mademoiselle
Stangerson had stated very minutely how she had spent the whole
of her time that day. We established the fact that the murderer
had introduced himself into the pavilion between five and six
o'clock. At a quarter past six the professor and his daughter had
resumed their work. At five the professor had been with his
daughter, and since the attack took place in the professor's
absence from his daughter, I had to find out just when he left
her. The professor had stated that at the time when he and his
daughter were about to re-enter the laboratory he was met by the
keeper and held in conversation about the cutting of some wood
and the poachers. Mademoiselle Stangerson was not with him then
since the professor said: 'I left the keeper and rejoined my
daughter who was at work in the laboratory.'</p>

<p>"It was during that short interval of time that the tragedy
took place. That is certain. In my mind's eye I saw Mademoiselle
Stangerson re-enter the pavilion, go to her room to take off her
hat, and find herself faced by the murderer. He had been in the
pavilion for some time waiting for her. He had arranged to pass
the whole night there. He had taken off Daddy Jacques's boots; he
had removed the papers from the cabinet; and had then slipped
under the bed. Finding the time long, he had risen, gone again
into the laboratory, then into the vestibule, looked into the
garden, and had seen, coming towards the pavilion, Mademoiselle
Stangerson&mdash;alone. He would never have dared to attack her
at that hour, if he had not found her alone. His mind was made
up. He would be more at ease alone with Mademoiselle Stangerson
in the pavilion, than he would have been in the middle of the
night, with Daddy Jacques sleeping in the attic. So he shut the
vestibule window. That explains why neither Monsieur Stangerson,
nor the keeper, who were at some distance from the pavilion, had
heard the revolver shot.</p>

<p>"Then he went back to The Yellow Room. Mademoiselle Stangerson
came in. What passed must have taken place very quickly.
Mademoiselle tried to call for help; but the man had seized her
by the throat. Her hand had sought and grasped the revolver which
she had been keeping in the drawer of her night-table, since she
had come to fear the threats of her pursuer. The murderer was
about to strike her on the head with the mutton-bone&mdash;a
terrible weapon in the hands of a Larsan or Ballmeyer; but she
fired in time, and the shot wounded the hand that held the
weapon. The bone fell to the floor covered with the blood of the
murderer, who staggered, clutched at the wall for
support&mdash;imprinting on it the red marks&mdash;and, fearing
another bullet, fled.</p>

<p>"She saw him pass through the laboratory, and listened. He was
long at the window. At length he jumped from it. She flew to it
and shut it. The danger past, all her thoughts were of her
father. Had he either seen or heard? At any cost to herself she
must keep this from him. Thus when Monsieur Stangerson returned,
he found the door of The Yellow Room closed, and his daughter in
the laboratory, bending over her desk, at work!"</p>

<p>Turning towards Monsieur Darzac, Rouletabille
cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You know the truth! Tell us, then, if that is not how things
happened."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about it," replied Monsieur Darzac.</p>

<p>"I admire you for your silence," said Rouletabille, "but if
Mademoiselle Stangerson knew of your danger, she would release
you from your oath. She would beg of you to tell all she has
confided to you. She would be here to defend you!"</p>

<p>Monsieur Darzac made no movement, nor uttered a word. He
looked at Rouletabille sadly.</p>

<p>"However," said the young reporter, "since Mademoiselle is not
here, I must do it myself. But, believe me, Monsieur Darzac, the
only means to save Mademoiselle Stangerson and restore her to her
reason, is to secure your acquittal."</p>

<p>"What is this secret motive that compels Mademoiselle
Stangerson to hide her knowledge from her father?" asked the
President.</p>

<p>"That, Monsieur, I do not know," said Rouletabille. "It is no
business of mine."</p>

<p>The President turning to Monsieur Darzac endeavoured to induce
him to tell what he knew.</p>

<p>"Do you still refuse, Monsieur, to tell us how you employed
your time during the attempts on the life of Mademoiselle
Stangerson?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you anything, Monsieur."</p>

<p>The President turned to Rouletabille as if appealing for an
explanation.</p>

<p>"We must assume, Monsieur President, that Monsieur Robert
Darzac's absensions are closely connected with Mademoiselle
Stangerson's secret, and that Monsieur Darzac feels himself in
honour bound to remain silent. It may be that Larsan, who, since
his three attempts, has had everything in training to cast
suspicion on Monsieur Darzac, had fixed on just those occasions
for a meeting with Monsieur Darzac at a spot most compromising.
Larsan is cunning enough to have done that."</p>

<p>The President seemed partly convinced, but still curious, he
asked:</p>

<p>"But what is this secret of Mademoiselle Stangerson?"</p>

<p>"That I cannot tell you," said Rouletabille. "I think,
however, you know enough now to acquit Monsieur Robert Darzac!
Unless Larsan should return, and I don't think he <i>will</i>,"
he added, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"One question more," said the President. "Admitting your
explanation, we know that Larsan wished to turn suspicion on
Monsieur Robert Darzac, but why should he throw suspicion on
Daddy Jacques also?"</p>

<p>"There came in the professional detective, Monsieur, who
proves himself an unraveller of mysteries, by annihilating the
very proofs he had accumulated. He's a very cunning man, and a
similar trick had often enabled him to turn suspicion from
himself. He proved the innocence of one before accusing the
other. You can easily believe, Monsieur, that so complicated a
scheme as this must have been long and carefully thought out in
advance by Larsan. I can tell you that he had long been engaged
on its elaboration. If you care to learn how he had gathered
information, you will find that he had, on one occasion,
disguised himself as the commissionaire between the 'Laboratory
of the Sûreté' and Monsieur Stangerson, of whom 'experiments'
were demanded. In this way he had been able before the crime, on
two occasions to take stock of the pavilion. He had 'made up' so
that Daddy Jacques had not recognised him. And yet Larsan had
found the opportunity to rob the old man of a pair of old boots
and a cast-off Basque cap, which the servant had tied up in a
handkerchief, with the intention of carrying them to a friend, a
charcoal-burner on the road to Epinay. When the crime was
discovered, Daddy Jacques had immediately recognised these
objects as his. They were extremely compromising, which explains
his distress at the time when we spoke to him about them. Larsan
confessed it all to me. He is an artist at the game. He did a
similar thing in the affair of the 'Crédit Universel,' and in
that of the 'Gold Ingots of the Mint.' Both these cases should be
revised. Since Ballmeyer or Larsan has been in the Sûreté a
number of innocent persons have been sent to prison."</p>

<h2><a id="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p class="chaphead">In Which It Is Proved That One Does Not
Always Think Of Everything.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
GREAT excitement prevailed when Rouletabille had finished. The
court-room became agitated with the murmurings of suppressed
applause. Maître Henri Robert called for an adjournment of the
trial and was supported in his motion by the public prosecutor
himself. The case was adjourned. The next day Monsieur Robert
Darzac was released on bail, while Daddy Jacques received the
immediate benefit of a "no cause for action." Search was
everywhere made for Frédéric Larsan, but in vain. Monsieur Darzac
finally escaped the awful calamity which, at one time, had
threatened him. After a visit to Mademoiselle Stangerson, he was
led to hope that she might, by careful nursing, one day recover
her reason.</p>

<p>Rouletabille, naturally, became the "man of the hour." On
leaving the Palais de Justice, the crowd bore him aloft in
triumph. The press of the whole world published his exploits and
his photograph. He, who had interviewed so many illustrious
personages, had himself become illustrious and was interviewed in
his turn. I am glad to say that the enormous success in no way
turned his head.</p>

<p>We left Versailles together, after having dined at "The Dog
That Smokes." In the train I put a number of questions to him
which, during our meal, had been on the tip of my tongue, but
which I had refrained from uttering, knowing he did not like to
talk "shop" while eating.</p>

<p>"My friend," I said, "that Larsan case is wonderful. It is
worthy of you."</p>

<p>He begged me to say no more, and humorously pretended an
anxiety for me should I give way to silly praise of him because
of a personal admiration for his ability.</p>

<p>"I'll come to the point, then," I said, not a little nettled.
"I am still in the dark as to your reason for going to America.
When you left the Glandier you had found out, if I rightly
understand, all about Frédéric Larsan; you had discovered the
exact way he had attempted the murder?"</p>

<p>"Quite so. And you," he said, turning the conversation, "did
you suspect nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!"</p>

<p>"It's incredible!"</p>

<p>"I don't see how I could have suspected anything. You took
great pains to conceal your thoughts from me. Had you already
suspected Larsan when you sent for me to bring the
revolvers?"</p>

<p>"Yes! I had come to that conclusion through the incident of
the 'inexplicable gallery.' Larsan's return to Mademoiselle
Stangerson's room, however, had not then been cleared up by the
eye-glasses. My suspicions were the outcome of my reasoning only;
and the idea of Larsan being the murderer seemed so extraordinary
that I resolved to wait for actual evidence before venturing to
act. Nevertheless, the suspicion worried me, and I sometimes
spoke to the detective in a way that ought to have opened your
eyes. I spoke disparagingly of his methods. But until I found the
eye-glasses I could but look upon my suspicion of him in the
light of an absurd hypothesis only. You can imagine my elation
after I had explained Larsan's movements. I remember well rushing
into my room like a madman and crying to you: 'I'll get the
better of the great Fred. I'll get the better of him in a way
that will make a sensation!'</p>

<p>"I was then thinking of Larsan, the murderer. It was that same
evening that Darzac begged me to watch over Mademoiselle
Stangerson. I made no efforts until after we had dined with
Larsan, until ten o'clock. He was right there before me, and I
could afford to wait. You ought to have suspected, because when
we were talking of the murderer's arrival, I said to you: 'I am
quite sure Larsan will be here to-night.'</p>

<p>"But one important point escaped us both. It was one which
ought to have opened our eyes to Larsan. Do you remember the
bamboo cane? I was surprised to find Larsan had made no use of
that evidence against Robert Darzac. Had it not been purchased by
a man whose description tallied exactly with that of Darzac?
Well, just before I saw him off at the train, after the recess
during the trial, I asked him why he hadn't used the cane
evidence. He told me he had never had any intention of doing so;
that our discovery of it in the little inn at Epinay had much
embarrassed him. If you will remember, he told us then that the
cane had been given him in London. Why did we not immediately say
to ourselves: 'Fred is lying. He could not have had this cane in
London. He was <i>not</i> in London. He bought it in Paris'? Then
you found out, on inquiry at Cassette's, that the cane had been
bought by a person dressed very like Robert Darzac, though, as we
learned later, from Darzac himself, it was not he who had made
the purchase. Couple this with the fact we already knew, from the
letter at the poste restante, that there was actually a man in
Paris who was passing as Robert Darzac, why did we not
immediately fix on Fred himself?</p>

<p>"Of course, his position at the Sûreté was against us; but
when we saw the evident eagerness on his part to find convicting
evidence against Darzac, nay, even the passion he displayed in
his pursuit of the man, the lie about the cane should have had a
new meaning for us. If you ask why Larsan bought the cane, if he
had no intention of manufacturing evidence against Darzac by
means of it, the answer is quite simple. He had been wounded in
the hand by Mademoiselle Stangerson, so that the cane was useful
to enable him to close his hand in carrying it. You remember I
noticed that he always carried it?</p>

<p>"All these details came back to my mind when I had once fixed
on Larsan as the criminal. But they were too late then to be of
any use to me. On the evening when he pretended to be drugged I
looked at his hand and saw a thin silk bandage covering the signs
of a slight healing wound. Had we taken a quicker initiative at
the time Larsan told us that lie about the cane, I am certain he
would have gone off, to avoid suspicion. All the same, we worried
Larsan or Ballmeyer without our knowing it."</p>

<p>"But," I interrupted, "if Larsan had no intention of using the
cane as evidence against Darzac, why had he made himself up to
look like the man when he went in to buy it?"</p>

<p>"He had not specially 'made up' as Darzac to buy the cane; he
had come straight to Cassette's immediately after he had attacked
Mademoiselle Stangerson. His wound was troubling him and, as he
was passing along the Avenue de l'Opera, the idea of the cane
came to his mind and he acted on it. It was then eight o'clock.
And I, who had hit upon the very hour of the occurrence of the
tragedy, almost convinced that Darzac was not the criminal, and
knowing of the cane, I still never suspected Larsan. There are
times..."</p>

<p>"There are times," I said, "when the greatest intellects..."
Rouletabille shut my mouth. I still continued to joke him, but,
finding he did not reply, I saw he was no longer paying any
attention to what I was saying. I found he was fast asleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h3>The Mystery Of Mademoiselle Stangerson.</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">
DURING the days that followed I had several opportunities to
question him as to his reason for his voyage to America, but I
obtained no more precise answers than he had given me on the
evening of the adjournment of the trial, when we were on the
train for Paris. One day, however, on my still pressing him, he
said:</p>

<p>"Can't you understand that I had to know Larsan's true
personality?"</p>

<p>"No doubt," I said, "but why did you go to America to find
that out?"</p>

<p>He sat smoking his pipe, and made no further reply. I began to
see that I was touching on the secret that concerned Mademoiselle
Stangerson. Rouletabille evidently had found it necessary to go
to America to find out what the mysterious tie was that bound her
to Larsan by so strange and terrible a bond. In America he had
learned who Larsan was and had obtained information which closed
his mouth. He had been to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>And now, what was this mystery which held Mademoiselle
Stangerson and Monsieur Robert Darzac in so inexplicable a
silence? After so many years and the publicity given the case by
a curious and shameless press; now that Monsieur Stangerson knows
all and has forgiven all; all may be told. In every phase of this
remarkable story Mademoiselle Stangerson had always been the
sufferer.</p>

<p>The beginning dates from the time when, as a young girl, she
was living with her father in Philadelphia. A visitor at the
house, a Frenchman, had succeeded by his wit, grace and
persistent attention, in gaining her affections. He was said to
be rich and had asked her of her father. Monsieur Stangerson, on
making inquiries as to Monsieur Jean Roussel, found that the man
was a swindler and an adventurer. Jean Roussel was but another of
the many names under which the notorious Ballmeyer, a fugitive
from France, tried to hide himself. Monsieur Stangerson did not
know of his identity with Ballmeyer; he learned that the man was
simply undesirable for his daughter. He not only refused to give
his consent to the marriage but denied him admission into the
house. Mathilde Stangerson, however, had fallen in love. To her
Jean Roussel was everything that her love painted him. She was
indignant at her father's attitude, and did not conceal her
feelings. Her father sent her to stay with an aunt in Cincinnati.
There she was joined by Jean Roussel and, in spite of the
reverence she felt for her father, ran away with him to get
married.</p>

<p>They went to Louisville and lived there for some time. One
morning, however, a knock came at the door of the house in which
they were and the police entered to arrest Jean Roussel. It was
then that Mathilde Stangerson, or Roussel, learned that her
husband was no other than the notorious Ballmeyer!</p>

<p>The young woman in her despair tried to commit suicide. She
failed in this, and was forced to rejoin her aunt at Cincinnati.
The old lady was overjoyed to see her again. She had been
anxiously searching for her and had not dared to tell Monsieur
Stangerson of her disappearance. Mathilde swore her to secrecy,
so that her father should not know she had been away. A month
later, Mademoiselle Stangerson returned to her father, repentant,
her heart dead within her, hoping only one thing: that she would
never again see her husband, the horrible Ballmeyer. A report was
spread, a few weeks later, that he was dead, and she now
determined to atone for her disobedience by a life of labour and
devotion for her father. And she kept her word.</p>

<p>All this she had confessed to Robert Darzac, and, believing
Ballmeyer dead, had given herself to the joy of a union with him.
But fate had resuscitated Jean Roussel&mdash;the Ballmeyer of her
youth. He had taken steps to let her know that he would never
allow her to marry Darzac&mdash;that he still loved her.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Stangerson never for one moment hesitated to
confide in Monsieur Darzac. She showed him the letter in which
Jean Roussel asked her to recall the first hours of their union
in their beautiful and charming Louisville home. "The presbytery
has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its brightness," he
had written. The scoundrel pretended to be rich and claimed the
right of taking her back to Louisville. She had told Darzac that
if her father should know of her dishonour, she would kill
herself. Monsieur Darzac had sworn to silence her persecutor,
even if he had to kill him. He was outwitted and would have
succumbed had it not been for the genius of Rouletabille.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Stangerson was herself helpless in the hands of
such a villain. She had tried to kill him when he had first
threatened and then attacked her in The Yellow Room. She had,
unfortunately, failed, and felt herself condemned to be for ever
at the mercy of this unscrupulous wretch who was continually
demanding her presence at clandestine interviews. When he sent
her the letter through the Post Office, asking her to meet him,
she had refused. The result of her refusal was the tragedy of The
Yellow Room. The second time he wrote asking for a meeting, the
letter reaching her in her sick chamber, she had avoided him by
sleeping with her women. In that letter the scoundrel had warned
her that, since she was too ill to come to him, he would come to
her, and that he would be in her chamber at a particular hour on
a particular night. Knowing that she had everything to fear from
Ballmeyer, she had left her chamber on that night. It was then
that the incident of the "inexplicable gallery" occurred.</p>

<p>The third time she had determined to keep the appointment. He
asked for it in the letter he had written in her own room, on the
night of the incident in the gallery, which he left on her desk.
In that letter he threatened to burn her father's papers if she
did not meet him. It was to rescue these papers that she made up
her mind to see him. She did not for one moment doubt that the
wretch would carry out his threat if she persisted in avoiding
him, and in that case the labours of her father's lifetime would
be for ever lost. Since the meeting was thus inevitable, she
resolved to see her husband and appeal to his better nature. It
was for this interview that she had prepared herself on the night
the keeper was killed. They did meet, and what passed between
them may be imagined. He insisted that she renounce Darzac. She,
on her part, affirmed her love for him. He stabbed her in his
anger, determined to convict Darzac of the crime. As Larsan he
could do it, and had so managed things that Darzac could never
explain how he had employed the time of his absence from the
château. Ballmeyer's precautions were most cunningly taken.</p>

<p>Larsan had threatened Darzac as he had threatened
Mathilde&mdash;with the same weapon, and the same threats. He
wrote Darzac urgent letters, declaring himself ready to deliver
up the letters that had passed between him and his wife, and to
leave them for ever, if he would pay him his price. He asked
Darzac to meet him for the purpose of arranging the matter,
appointing the time when Larsan would be with Mademoiselle
Stangerson. When Darzac went to Epinay, expecting to find
Ballmeyer or Larsan there, he was met by an accomplice of
Larsan's, and kept waiting until such time as the "coincidence"
could be established.</p>

<p>It was all done with Machiavellian cunning; but Ballmeyer had
reckoned without Joseph Rouletabille.</p>

<p>Now that the Mystery of The Yellow Room has been cleared up,
this is not the time to tell of Rouletabille's adventures in
America. Knowing the young reporter as we do, we can understand
with what acumen he had traced, step by step, the story of
Mathilde Stangerson and Jean Roussel. At Philadelphia he had
quickly informed himself as to Arthur William Rance. There he
learned of Rance's act of devotion and the reward he thought
himself entitled to for it. A rumour of his marriage with
Mademoiselle Stangerson had once found its way into the
drawing-rooms of Philadelphia. He also learned of Rance's
continued attentions to her and his importunities for her hand.
He had taken to drink, he had said, to drown his grief at his
unrequited love. It can now be understood why Rouletabille had
shown so marked a coolness of demeanour towards Rance when they
met in the witnesses' room, on the day of the trial.</p>

<p>The strange Roussel-Stangerson mystery had now been laid bare.
Who was this Jean Roussel? Rouletabille had traced him from
Philadelphia to Cincinnati. In Cincinnati he became acquainted
with the old aunt, and had found means to open her mouth. The
story of Ballmeyer's arrest threw the right light on the whole
story. He visited the "presbytery"&mdash;a small and pretty
dwelling in the old colonial style&mdash;which had, indeed, "lost
nothing of its charm." Then, abandoning his pursuit of traces of
Mademoiselle Stangerson, he took up those of Ballmeyer. He
followed them from prison to prison, from crime to crime.
Finally, as he was about leaving for Europe, he learned in New
York that Ballmeyer had, five years before, embarked for France
with some valuable papers belonging to a merchant of New Orleans
whom he had murdered.</p>

<p>And yet the whole of this mystery has not been revealed.
Mademoiselle Stangerson had a child, by her husband,&mdash;a son.
The infant was born in the old aunt's house. No one knew of it,
so well had the aunt managed to conceal the event.</p>

<p>What became of that son?&mdash;That is another story which, so
far, I am not permitted to relate.</p>

<p>About two months after these events, I came upon Rouletabille
sitting on a bench in the Palais de Justice, looking very
depressed.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, old man?" I asked. "You are looking very
downcast. How are your friends getting on?"</p>

<p>"Apart from you," he said, "I have no friends."</p>

<p>"I hope that Monsieur Darzac&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No doubt."</p>

<p>"And Mademoiselle Stangerson&mdash;How is she?"</p>

<p>"Better&mdash;much better."</p>

<p>"Then you ought not to be sad."</p>

<p>"I am sad," he said, "because I am thinking of the perfume of
the lady in black&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The perfume of the lady in black!&mdash;I have heard you
often refer to it. Tell me why it troubles you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;some day; some day," said Rouletabille.</p>

<p>And he heaved a profound sigh.</p>
