<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1">I. &mdash; TOUGH LUCK</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A HALF dozen men sprawled comfortably in
back-tilted chairs against the side of the Bar Y bunk-house at the
home ranch. They were young men, lithe of limb, tanned of face and
clear of eye. Their skins shone from recent ablutions and their
slicked hair was still damp, for they had but just come from the
evening meal, and meals at the home ranch required a toilet.</p>

<p>One of them was singing.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"In the shade of a tree we two sat, him an'
me,<br>
Where the Haegler Hills slope to the Raft<br>
While our ponies browsed 'round, reins a-draggin' the ground;<br>
Then he looks at me funny an' laft."</p>
<br>

<p>"Most any one would," interrupted a listener.</p>

<p>"Shut up," admonished another, "I ain't only heered this three
hundred an' sixty-five times in the las' year. Do you think I want
to miss anything?"</p>

<p>Unabashed, the sweet singer continued.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"'Do you see thet there town?' he inquires,
pintin' down<br>
To some shacks sprawlin' 'round in the heat.<br>
I opined thet I did an' he shifted his quid<br>
After drowndin' a tumble-bug neat.<br>
Then he looks at me square. 'There's a guy waitin' there<br>
Thet the sheep-men have hired to git me.<br>
Are you game to come down to thet jerk-water town<br>
Jest to see what in Hell you will see?'"</p>
<br>

<p>One of the group rose and stretched, yawning. He was a tall,
dark man. Perhaps in his expression there was something a bit
sinister. He seldom smiled and, when not in liquor, rarely
spoke.</p>

<p>He was foreman&mdash;had been foreman for over a year, and,
except for a couple of sprees, during which he had playfully and
harmlessly shot up the adjoining town, he had been a good foreman,
for he was a thorough horseman, knew the range, understood cattle,
was a hard worker and knew how to get work out of others.</p>

<p>It had been six months since he had been drunk, though he had
taken a drink now and then if one of the boys chanced to bring a
flask back from town. His abstinence might have been accounted for
by the fact that Elias Henders, his boss, had threatened to break
him the next time he fell from grace.</p>

<p>"You see, Bull," the old man had said, "we're the biggest outfit
in this part of the country an' it don't look good to see the
foreman of the Bar Y shootin' up the town like some kid tender-foot
that's been slapped in the face with a bar-rag. You gotta quit it,
Bull; I ain't a-goin' to tell you again."</p>

<p>And Bull knew the old man wouldn't tell him again, so he had
stayed good for six long months. Perhaps it was not entirely a
desire to cling to the foreman's job that kept him in the straight
and narrow path. Perhaps Diana Henders' opinion had had more weight
with him than that of her father.</p>

<p>"I'm ashamed of you, Bull," she had said, and she refused to
ride with him for more than a week. That had been bad enough, but
as if to make it worse she had ridden several times with a new hand
who had drifted in from the north a short time before and been
taken on by Bull to fill a vacancy.</p>

<p>At first Bull had not liked the new man. "He's too damned pretty
to be a puncher," one of the older hands had remarked, and it is
possible that the newcomer's rather extreme good looks had
antagonized them all a little at first, but he had proven a good
man and so the others had come to accept Hal Colby in spite of his
wealth of waving black hair, his perfect profile, gleaming teeth
and laughing eyes.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"So I told him I'd go, fer I liked thet there
bo,<br>
And I'd see thet the shootin' was fair;<br>
But says he: 'It is just to see who starts it fust<br>
Thet I wants anyone to be there.'"</p>
<br>

<p>"I'm going to turn in," remarked Bull.</p>

<p>Hal Colby rose. "Same here," he said, and followed the foreman
into the bunk-house. A moment later he turned where he stood beside
his bunk and looked at Bull who was sitting on the edge of his,
removing his spurs. The handsome lips were curved in a pleasant
smile. "Lookee here, Bull!" he whispered, and as the other turned
toward him he reached a hand beneath the bag of clothes that
constituted his pillow and drew forth a pint flask. "Wet your
whistle?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Don't care if I do," replied the foreman, crossing the room to
Colby's bunk.</p>

<p>Through the open window floated the drawling notes of Texas
Pete's perennial rhapsody.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"When the jedge says: 'Who drew his gun fust, him
or you?'<br>
Then I wants a straight guy on my side,<br>
Fer thet poor puddin' head, why, he's already dead<br>
With a forty-five hole in his hide."</p>
<br>

<p>"Here's lookin' at you!" said Bull.</p>

<p>"Drink hearty," replied Colby.</p>

<p>"'Taint so bad at that," remarked the foreman, wiping his lips
on the cuff of his shirt and handing the flask back to the
other.</p>

<p>"Not so worse for rot-gut," agreed Colby. "Have another!"</p>

<p>The foreman shook his head.</p>

<p>"'T won't hurt you any," Colby assured him. "It's pretty good
stuff."</p>

<p>Sang Texas Pete:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"And thet wasn't jest jaw&mdash;when it come to a
draw<br>
This here guy was like lightnin' turned loose.<br>
Then we rolls us a smoke an' not neither one spoke<br>
'Til he said: 'Climb aboard your cayuse.'<br>
Then we reined down the hill each a-puffin' his pill<br>
To the town 'neath its shimmer o' heat<br>
An' heads up to the shack that's a-leanin' its back<br>
'Gainst the side o' The Cowboys' Retreat."</p>
<br>

<p>Bull took another drink&mdash;a longer one this time, and,
rolling a cigarette, sat down on the edge of Colby's bunk and
commenced to talk&mdash;whiskey always broke the bonds of his
taciturnity. His voice was low and not unpleasant.</p>

<p>He spoke of the day's work and the plans for tomorrow and Hal
Colby encouraged him. Perhaps he liked him; perhaps, like others,
he felt that it paid to be on friendly terms with the foreman.</p>

<p>While from outside:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"It is Slewfoot's Good Luck where they hand you
out chuck<br>
Thet is mostly sow-belly an' beans.<br>
Says he: 'Bub, let's us feed&mdash;I'm a-feelin' the need<br>
O' more substance than air in my jeans.'<br>
So ol' Slewfoot was there, all red freckles an' hair,<br>
An' we lined our insides with his grub.<br>
Says Bill, then: 'Show your gait&mdash;let's be pullin' our
freight,<br>
Fer I'm rarin' to go,' says he, 'Bub.'"</p>
<br>

<p>Inside the bunk-house Bull rose to his feet. "That's damn good
stuff, Hal," he said. The two had emptied the flask.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said the other, "I got another flask," and
reached again beneath his bag.</p>

<p>"No," demurred the foreman, "I guess I got enough."</p>

<p>"Oh, hell, you ain't had none yet," insisted Colby.</p>

<p>The song of Texas Pete suffered many interruptions due to
various arguments in which he felt compelled to take sides, but
whenever there was a lull in the conversation he resumed his
efforts to which no one paid any attention further than as they
elicited an occasional word of banter.</p>

<p>The sweet singer never stopped except at the end of a stanza,
and no matter how long the interruption, even though days might
elapse, he always began again with the succeeding stanza, without
the slightest hesitation or repetition. And so now, as Bull and
Colby drank, he sang on.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"'Now we'll sashay next door to thet hard-licker
store<br>
Where his nibs is most likely to be<br>
An' then you goes in first an' starts drowdin' your thirst;<br>
But a-keepin' your eyes peeled fer me.'"</p>
<br>

<p>Bull, the foreman, rose to his feet. He stood as steady as a
rock, but Colby saw that he was drunk. After six months' of almost
total abstinence he had just consumed considerably more than a pint
of cheap and fiery whiskey in less than a half hour.</p>

<p>"Goin' to bed?" asked Colby.</p>

<p>"Bed, hell," replied the other. "I'm goin' to town&mdash;it's my
night to howl. Comin'?"</p>

<p>"No," said Colby. "I think I'll turn in. Have a good time."</p>

<p>"I sure will." The foreman walked to his bunk and strapped his
guns about his hips, resumed the single spur he had removed, tied a
fresh black silk handkerchief about his neck, clapped his sombrero
over his shock of straight black hair and strode out of the
bunk-house.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"'Fer I wants you to see thet it's him draws on
me<br>
So the jedge he cain't make me the goat.'<br>
So I heads fer that dump an' a queer little lump<br>
Starts a-wrigglin' aroun' in my throat."</p>
<br>

<p>"Say, where in hell's Bull goin' this time o' night?" Pete
interrupted himself.</p>

<p>"He's headin' fer the horse c'rel," stated another.</p>

<p>"Acts like he was full," said a third. "Didje hear him hummin' a
tune as he went out? That's always a sign with him. The stuff sort
o' addles up his brains, like Pete's always is, an' makes him
sing."</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Fer I wants you to know thet I likes thet there
bo<br>
An' I'd seen more than one good one kilt,<br>
Fer you cain't never tell, leastways this side o' Hell,<br>
When there's shootin' whose blood will be spilt."</p>
<br>

<p>"There he goes now," said one of the men as the figure of a
rider shown dimly in the starlight loping easily away toward the
south, "an' he's goin' toward town."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Texas Pete, "if he knows the old man is in town
tonight."</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Jest inside o' the door with one foot on the
floor<br>
An' the other hist up on the rail<br>
Stands a big, raw-boned guy with the orn'riest eye<br>
Thet I ever seen outen a jail."</p>
<br>

<p>"By gollies, I'm goin' after Bull. I doan b'lieve he-all knows
thet the ol' man's in town," and leaping to his feet he walked off
toward the horse corral, still singing:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"An' beside him a girl, thet sure looked like a
pearl<br>
Thet the Bible guy cast before swine,<br>
Was a-pleadin' with him, her eyes teary an' dim,<br>
As I high-sign the bar-keep fer mine."</p>
<br>

<p>He caught up one of the loose horses in the corral, rammed a
great, silver-mounted spade bit between its jaws, threw a heavy,
carved saddle upon the animal's back, stepped one foot into a
trailing, tapaderaed stirrup and was off in a swirl of dust. Texas
Pete never rode other than in a swirl of dust, unless it happened
to be raining, then he rode in a shower of mud.</p>

<p>His speed tonight was, therefore, not necessarily an indication
of haste. He would have ridden at the same pace to either a funeral
or a wedding, or home from either.</p>

<p>But any who knew Texas Pete could have guessed that he was in
considerable haste, for he rode without his woolly, sheepskin
chaps&mdash;one of the prides of his existence. If he had been in
too much of a hurry to don them he must have been in a great hurry,
indeed.</p>

<p>Texas Pete might be without a job, with not more than two-bits
between himself and starvation, but he was never without a fine
pair of sheepskin chaps, a silver encrusted bit, a heavy bridle
garnished with the same precious metal, an ornate saddle of hand
carved leather and silver conchas, a Stetson, two good six-guns
with their belt and holsters and a vivid silk neckerchief.</p>

<p>Possibly his pony cost no more than ten dollars, his boots were
worn and his trousers blue denim overalls, greasy and frayed, yet
Texas Pete otherwise was a thing of beauty and a joy forever. The
rowels of his silver-inlaid Mexican spurs dragged the ground when
he walked and the dumb-bells depending from their hubs tinkled
merrily a gay accompaniment to his boyish heart beating beneath
ragged underclothing.</p>

<p>Texas Pete galloped along the dusty road toward the small
cattle-town that served the simple needs of that frontier community
with its general store, its restaurant, its Chinese laundry,
blacksmith shop, hotel, newspaper office and five saloons, and as
he galloped he sang:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Then the door swings agin an' my pal he steps
in<br>
An' the light in his eye it was bad,<br>
An' the raw-boned guy wheels an' the girl there she squeals:<br>
'O, fer gawd's sake don't shoot, Bill, it's dad!'"</p>
<br>

<p>A mile ahead of Pete another pony tore through the dust toward
town&mdash;a blazed face chestnut with two white hind
feet&mdash;Blazes, the pride of the foreman's heart.</p>

<p>In the deep saddle, centaurlike, sat the horseman.</p>

<p>Hendersville tinkled softly in the quiet of early evening.
Later, gaining momentum, it would speed up a bit under his own
power. At present it reposed in the partial lethargy of digestive
functionings&mdash;it was barely first drink time after supper. Its
tinkling was the tinkling of spurs, chips and only very occasional
glassware.</p>

<p>Suddenly its repose was shattered by a wild whoop from without,
the clatter of swift hoofs and the rapid crack, crack, crack of a
six-gun. Gum Smith, sheriff, rose from behind the faro layout and
cocked an attentive ear.</p>

<p>Gum guided the destinies of the most lucrative thirst emporium
in Hendersville. Being sheriff flattered his vanity and attracted
business, but it had its drawbacks; the noises from without sounded
like one of them and Gum was pained.</p>

<p>It was at times such as this that he almost wished that someone
else was sheriff, but a quick glance at the shiny badge pinned to
the left hand pocket of his vest reassured him quickly on that
point and he glanced swiftly about the room at its other occupants
and sighed in relief&mdash;there were at least a dozen husky young
punchers there.</p>

<p>Across the street, in the office of the Hendersville
<i>Tribune</i>, Elias Henders sat visiting with the Editor. As the
shouting and the shots broke the quiet of the evening the two men
looked up and outward toward the street.</p>

<p>"Boys will be boys," remarked the editor.</p>

<p>A bullet crashed through the glass at the top of the window.
With a single movement the editor extinguished the lamp that burned
on the desk before them, and both men, with a celerity that spoke
habit, crouched quickly behind that piece of furniture.</p>

<p>"Sometimes they're damn careless, though," replied Elias
Henders.</p>

<p>Down the road Texas Pete galloped and sang:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"For the thing she had saw was Bill reach for to
draw<br>
When the guy she called dad drawed on Bill.<br>
In the door was my pal with his eyes on the gal<br>
An' his hand on his gun&mdash;standin' still."</p>
<br>

<p>From the distance ahead came, thinly, the sound of shots.</p>

<p>"By gollies!" exclaimed Texas Pete, "the darned
son-of-a-gun!"</p>

<p>The men lolling about the barroom of <i>Gum's
Place&mdash;Liquors and Cigars</i>&mdash;looked up at the sound of
the shots and grinned. An instant later a horse's unshod hoofs
pounded on the rough boards of the covered "porch" in front of
Gum's Place, the swinging doors burst in and Blazes was brought to
his haunches in the center of the floor with a wild whoop from his
rider, who waved a smoking gun above his head.</p>

<p>Bull, the Bar Y foreman, let his gaze run quickly about the
room. When his steel grey eyes alighted upon the sheriff they
remained there. Gum Smith appeared to wilt behind the faro table.
He shook a wavering finger at the Bar Y foreman.</p>

<p>"Yo'-all's undah arrest," he piped in a high, thin voice, and
turning toward the men seated about the neighboring tables he
pointed first at one and then at another. "Ah depatize yo! Ah
depatize yo! Ah depatize yo!" he announced to each as he covered
them in turn with his swiftly moving index finger. "Seize him,
men!" No one moved. Gum Smith waxed excited. "Seize him, yo'-all!
Ah'm sheriff o' this yere county. Ef Ah depatize yo'-all yo'-all's
got to be depatized."</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"My mother was a wild cat,<br>
My father was a bear,"</p>
<br>

<p>announced Bull,</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"I picks my teeth with barb-wire<br>
With cactus combs my hair."</p>
<br>

<p>"and I craves drink&mdash;pronto!"</p>

<p>"Yo'-all's undah arrest! Seize him, men!" shrilled Gum.</p>

<p>Bull fired into the floor at the foot of the faro table and Gum
Smith disappeared behind it. The men all laughed. Bull turned his
attention toward the bar-keep and fired into the back bar. The
bar-keep grinned.</p>

<p>"Be keerful, Bull," he admonished, "I got a bad heart. My doctor
tells me as how I should avoid excitement."</p>

<p>The front doors swung in again and Bull wheeled with ready
six-gun to cover the newcomer, but at sight of the man who entered
the room the muzzle of his gun dropped and he was sobered in the
instant.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Elias Henders, "so it's you agin, Bull, eh?"</p>

<p>The two men stood looking at one another in silence for a
moment. What was passing in their minds no one might have guessed.
It was the older man who spoke again first.</p>

<p>"I reckon I'll not be needin' you any more, Bull," he said, and
then, after a moment's reflection, "unless you want a job as a
hand&mdash;after you sober up."</p>

<p>He turned and left the building and as he stepped down into the
dust of the road Texas Pete swung from his pony and brushed past
him.</p>

<p>Inside, Bull sat his horse at one side of the large room, near
the bar. Behind him Gum Smith was slowly emerging from the
concealment of the faro table. When he saw the man he feared
sitting with his back toward him, a crafty look came into the eyes
of the sheriff. He glanced quickly about the room. The men were all
looking at Bull. No one seemed to be noticing Gum.</p>

<p>He drew his gun and levelled it at the back of the ex-foreman of
the Bar Y. Instantly there was a flash from the doorway, the crack
of a shot, and the sheriff's gun dropped from his hand. All eyes
turned in the direction of the entrance. There stood Texas Pete,
his shooting iron smoking in his hand.</p>

<p>"You damn pole-cat!" he exclaimed, his eyes on Gum. "Come on,
Bull; this ain't no place for quiet young fellers like us."</p>

<p>Bull wheeled Blazes and rode slowly through the doorway, with
never a glance toward the sheriff; nor could he better have shown
his utter contempt for the man. There had always been bad blood
between them. Smith had been elected by the lawless element of the
community and at the time of the campaign Bull had worked
diligently for the opposing candidate who had been backed by the
better element, consisting largely of the cattle owners, headed by
Elias Henders.</p>

<p>What Bull's position would have been had he not been foreman for
Henders at the time was rather an open question among the voters of
Hendersville, but the fact remained that he had been foreman and
that he had worked to such good purpose for the candidate of the
reform element that he had not only almost succeeded in electing
him, but had so exposed the rottenness of the gang back of Smith's
candidacy that their power was generally considered to be on the
wane.</p>

<p>"It'll be Bull for sheriff next election," was considered a safe
prophecy and even a foregone conclusion, by some.</p>

<p>Gum Smith picked up his gun and examined it. Texas Pete's shot
had struck the barrel just in front of the cylinder. The man looked
angrily around at the other occupants of the room.</p>

<p>"Ah wants yo'-all to remember that Ah'm sheriff here," he cried,
"an' when Ah depatizes yo'-all it's plum legal, an' yo'-all gotta
do what Ah tell yo' to."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up, Gum," admonished one of the men.</p>

<p>Outside, Texas Pete had mounted his pony and was moving along
slowly stirrup to stirrup with Bull, who was now apparently as
sober as though he had never had a drink in his life.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing fer us he didn't have his gang there
tonight," remarked Pete.</p>

<p>Bull shrugged, but said nothing in reply. Texas Pete resigned
himself to song.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Then thet damned raw-boned guy with the ornery
eye<br>
Up an' shoots my pal dead in the door;<br>
But I'm here to opine with this bazoo o' mine<br>
Thet he won't shoot no hombres no more."</p>
<br>

<p>"What was you doin' up to town, Texas?" inquired Bull.</p>

<p>"O, I jest thought as how I'd ride up an' see what was
doin'&mdash;thought maybe you didn't know the old man was there
tonight&mdash;reckon I was a bit late, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Thanks, just the same&mdash;I won't ferget it."</p>

<p>"Tough luck."</p>

<p>"How'd you know the old man was goin' to be in town
tonight?"</p>

<p>"Why, I reckon as how everybody exceptin' you knew it,
Bull."</p>

<p>"Did Colby know it?"</p>

<p>"Why, I recken as how he must of."</p>

<p>They rode on for some time in silence, which Texas finally
broke.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Jest a moment, an' where they'd been five o' us
there,<br>
We hed suddenly dwindled to three.<br>
The bar-keep, he was one&mdash;the darned son-of-a-gun&mdash;<br>
An' the others, a orphan an' me."</p>
<br>

<p>When Bull and Texas entered the bunk-house most of the men were
asleep, but Hal Colby rolled over on his bunk and smiled at Bull as
the latter lighted a lamp.</p>

<p>"Have a good time, Bull?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"The old man was there," said Bull, "an' I ain't foreman no
more."</p>

<p>"Tough luck," sympathized Colby.</p>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">II. &mdash; THE HOLDUP</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AFTER breakfast the following morning the men were
saddling-up listlessly for the day's work. There was no foreman now
and they were hanging about waiting for the boss. Bull sat on the
top rail of the corral, idle. He was out of a job. His fellows paid
little or no attention to him, but whether from motives of
consideration for his feelings, or because they were not interested
in him or his troubles a casual observer could not have deduced
from their manner.</p>

<p>Unquestionably he had friends among them, but he was a taciturn
man and, like all such, did not make friends quickly.
Undemonstrative himself, he aroused no show of demonstration in
others. His straight black hair, and rather high cheek bones,
coupled with a tanned skin, gave him something the appearance of an
Indian, a similarity that was further heightened by his natural
reserve, while a long, red scar across his jaw accentuated a
suggestion of grimness that his countenance possessed in
repose.</p>

<p>Texas Pete, saddling his pony directly below him in the corral,
was starting the day with a new song.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"I stood at the bar, at The Spread Eagle Bar,<br>
A-drinkin' a drink whilst I smoked a seegar<sup>___</sup></p>
<br>

<p>"Quittin', Bull?" he inquired, looking up at the ex-foreman.</p>

<p>"Reckon so," came the reply.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"When in walks a gent thet I ain't never see<br>
An' he lets out a beller an' then says, says he:<sup>___</sup>"</p>
<br>

<p>Texas Pete swung easily into his saddle.</p>

<p>"Reckon as how I'll be pullin' my freight, too," he announced.
"I been aimin' to do thet for quite a spell. Where'll we head
fer?"</p>

<p>Bull's eyes wandered to the front of the ranch house, and as
they did so they beheld "the old man" emerging from the office.
Behind him came his daughter Diana and Hal Colby. The latter were
laughing and talking gaily. Bull could not but notice how close the
man leaned toward the girl's face. What an easy way Colby had with
people&mdash;especially women.</p>

<p>"Well," demanded Texas Pete, "if you're comin' why don't you
saddle up?"</p>

<p>"Reckon I've changed my mind."</p>

<p>Texas Pete glanced toward the ranch house, following the
direction of the other's eyes, and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"O, well," he said, "this ain't a bad place. Reckon as how I'll
stay on, too, fer a spell."</p>

<p>Elias Henders and Hal Colby were walking slowly in the direction
of the horse corral. The girl had turned and re-entered the house.
The two men entered the corral and as they did so Bull descended
from the fence and approached Henders.</p>

<p>"You don't happen to need no hands, do you?" he asked the older
man.</p>

<p>"I can use you, Bull," replied Henders with a faint smile.
"Thirty-five a month and found."</p>

<p>The former foreman nodded in acceptance of the terms and,
walking toward the bunch of horses huddled at one side of the
corral, whistled. Instantly Blazes' head came up above those of the
other animals. With up-pricked ears he regarded his owner for a
moment, and then, shouldering his way through the bunch, he walked
directly to him.</p>

<p>Elias Henders stopped in the center of the corral and attracted
the attention of the men. "Colby here," he announced, "is the new
foreman."</p>

<p>That was all. There was a moment's embarrassed silence and then
the men resumed their preparations for the work of the day, or, if
they were ready, lolled in their saddles rolling cigarettes. Colby
went among them assigning the various duties for the
day&mdash;pretty much routine work with which all were
familiar.</p>

<p>"And you, Bull," he said when he reached the ex-foreman, "I wish
you'd ride up to the head of Cottonwood Canyon and see if you can
see anything of that bunch of Crazy J cows&mdash;I ain't seen
nothin' of 'em for a week or more."</p>

<p>It was the longest, hardest assignment of the day, but if Bull
was dissatisfied with it he gave no indication. As a matter of fact
he probably was content, for he was a hard rider and he liked to be
off alone. A trait that had always been a matter for comment and
some conjecture.</p>

<p>More than one had asked himself or a neighbor what Bull found to
do that took him off by himself so often. There are those who
cannot conceive that a man can find pleasure in his own company, or
in that of a good horse and the open.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The mouth of Cottonwood Canyon lay a good twenty miles from the
ranch and the head of it five miles of rough going farther. It was
ten o'clock when Bull suddenly drew rein beside the lone cottonwood
that marked the entrance to the canyon and gave it its name.</p>

<p>He sat motionless, listening intently. Faintly, from far up the
canyon, came the staccato of rifle shots. How far it was difficult
to judge, for the walls of a winding canyon quickly absorb sound.
Once convinced of the direction of their origin, however, the man
urged his pony into a gallop, turning his head up the canyon.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>As the last of the cow hands loped away from the ranch upon the
business of the day Elias Henders turned back toward the office,
while Hal Colby caught up two ponies which he saddled and bridled,
humming meanwhile a gay little tune. Mounting one, he rode toward
the ranch house, leading the other, just as Diana Henders emerged
from the interior, making it apparent for whom the led horse was
intended.</p>

<p>Taking the reins from Colby, the girl swung into the saddle like
a man, and she sat her horse like a man, too, and yet, though she
could ride with the best of them, and shoot with the best of them,
there was nothing coarse or common about her. Some of the older
hands had known her since childhood, yet even that fact, coupled
with the proverbial freedom of the eighties in Arizona, never
permitted them the same freedom with Diana Henders that most of the
few girls in that wild country either overlooked or accepted as a
matter of course.</p>

<p>Men did not curse in Diana's presence, nor did they throw an arm
across her slim shoulders, or slap her upon the back in good
fellowship, and yet they all worshipped her, and most of them had
been violently in love with her. Something within her, inherently
fine and noble, kept them at a distance, or rather in their places,
for only those men who were hopelessly bashful ever remained at a
distance from Diana where there was the slightest chance to be near
her.</p>

<p>The men often spoke of her as a thoroughbred, sensing, perhaps,
the fine breeding that made her what she was. Elias Henders was one
of the Henders of Kentucky, and, like all the males of his line for
generations, held a degree from Oxford, which he had entered after
graduation from the beloved alma mater of his native state, for the
very excellent reason that old Sir John Henders, who had
established the American branch of the family, had been an Oxford
man and had seen his son and his grandson follow his footsteps.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years before Elias Henders had come west with John
Manill, a class-mate and neighbor of Kentucky, and the two young
men had entered the cattle business. Their combined capital managed
to keep them from the embarrassments and annoyances of a sheriff's
sale for some three years, but what with raiding Apaches, poor rail
facilities and a distant market, coupled with inexperience, they
were at last upon the very brink of bankruptcy when Henders
discovered gold on their property. Two years later they were rich
men.</p>

<p>Henders returned to Kentucky and married Manill's sister, and
shortly afterwards moved to New York, as it was decided that the
best interests of the partnership required an eastern
representative. Manill remained in Arizona.</p>

<p>Diana Henders was born in New York City, and when she was about
five years old her mother contracted tuberculosis of the lungs.
Physicians advising a dry climate, Henders and Manill changed
places, Henders taking his family to Arizona and Manill removing to
New York with his wife and little daughter. He had married beneath
him and unhappily with the result that being both a proud and
rather reserved man he had confided nothing to his sister, the wife
of his partner and best friend.</p>

<p>When Diana was fifteen her mother had died, and the girl,
refusing to leave her father, had abandoned the idea of finishing
her education in an eastern college, and Elias Henders, loath to
give her up, had acquiesced in her decision. Qualified by education
as he was to instruct her, Diana's training had been carried on
under the tutorage of her father, so that at nineteen, though
essentially a frontier girl unversed in many of the finer
artificialities of social usage, she was yet a young woman of
culture and refinement. Her music, which was the delight of her
father, she owed to the careful training of her mother as well as
to the possession of a grand piano that had come over Raton Pass
behind an ox team in the seventies.</p>

<p>Her father, her books, her music and her horses constituted the
life of this young girl; her social companions the young vaqueros
who rode for her father, and without at least one of whom she was
not permitted to ride abroad, since the Apaches were still a menace
in the Arizona of that day.</p>

<p>And so it was that this morning she rode out with the new
foreman. They walked their horses in silence for a few minutes, the
man's stirrup just behind that of the girl, where he might let his
eyes rest upon her profile without detection. The heavy lashed eye,
the short, straight nose, the patrician mouth and chin held the
adoring gaze of the young foreman in mute worship; but it was he
who, at length, broke the silence.</p>

<p>"You ain't congratulated me yet, Di," he said, "or maybe you
didn't know?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew," she replied, "and I do congratulate you; but I
cannot forget that your fortune means another man's sorrow."</p>

<p>"It's his own fault. A man that can't keep sober can't be
trusted with a job like this."</p>

<p>"He was a good foreman."</p>

<p>"Maybe so&mdash;I ain't sayin' nothin' about a man that's down.
It seems to me you set a lot of store by him, though; and what do
you know about him? You can't be too careful, Di. There's lots of
bad 'uns in these parts and when a feller never talks none, like
him, its probably because he's got something on his mind he don't
want to talk about."</p>

<p>"I thought he was your friend," said the girl.</p>

<p>Colby flushed. "He is my friend. I set a lot of store by Bull;
but it's you I'm thinkin' of&mdash;not him or me. I wouldn't want
nothin' to happen that you'd have to be sorry about."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, Hal."</p>

<p>He flecked the leg of his chaps with the lash of his quirt. "Oh,
pshaw, Di," he parried, "I don't want to say nothin' about a
friend. I only want to put you on your guard, that's all. You know
there ain't nothin' I wouldn't do for you&mdash;no, not even if it
cost me all the friends I got."</p>

<p>He passed his reins to his right hand and reaching across laid
his left across one of hers, which she quickly withdrew.</p>

<p>"Please don't," she begged.</p>

<p>"I love you, Di," he blurted suddenly.</p>

<p>The girl laughed gaily, though not in derision. "All the men
think they do. It's because I'm the only girl within miles and
miles."</p>

<p>"You're the only girl in the world&mdash;for me."</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him quizzically. He was very handsome.
That and his boyish, laughing manner had attracted her to him from
the first. There had seemed a frankness and openness about him that
appealed to her, and of all the men she knew, only excepting her
father, he alone possessed anything approximating poise and
self-confidence in his intercourse with women. The others were
either shy and blundering, or loud and coarse, or taciturn sticks
like Bull, who seemed to be the only man on the ranch who was not
desperately in love with her.</p>

<p>"We'll talk about something else," she announced.</p>

<p>"Isn't there any hope for me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why yes," she assured him. "I hope you will keep on loving me.
I love to have people love me."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to do <i>all</i> the loving," he insisted.</p>

<p>"Don't worry&mdash;you're not. Even the cook is writing poems
about me. Of all the foolish men I ever heard of Dad has certainly
succeeded in corraling the prize bunch."</p>

<p>"I don't care a hang about that red-headed old fool of a cook,"
he snapped. "What I want is for <i>you</i> to love <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, that's a horse of another color. Now we <i>will</i>
have to change the subject."</p>

<p>"Please, Di, I'm in earnest," he pleaded; "won't you give me a
little to hope for?"</p>

<p>"You never can tell about a girl, Hal," she said.</p>

<p>Her voice was tender and her eyes suddenly soft, and that was as
near a promise as he could get.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>As Bull urged Blazes up the rough trail of Cottonwood Canyon the
continued crack of rifles kept the man apprised of the direction of
the origin of the sounds and approximately of their ever lessening
distance ahead. Presently he drew rein and, pulling his rifle from
its boot, dismounted, dropping the reins upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Stand!" he whispered to Blazes and crept forward
stealthily.</p>

<p>The shooting was close ahead now&mdash;just around the brush
covered shoulder of a rocky hill. The detonations were less
frequent. Bull guessed that by now both hunters and hunted were
under cover and thus able to take only occasional pot shots at one
another's refuge.</p>

<p>To come upon them directly up the trail in the bottom of the
canyon would have been to expose himself to the fire of one side,
and possibly of both, for in this untamed country it was easily
conceivable that both sides of the controversy might represent
interests inimical to those of his employer. With this idea in mind
the ex-foreman of the Bar Y Ranch clambered cautiously up the steep
side of the hill that hid from his view that part of the canyon
lying just beyond.</p>

<p>From the varying qualities of the detonations the man had
deduced that five and possibly six rifles were participating in the
affair. How they were divided he could not even guess. He would
have a look over the crest of the hog-back and if the affair was
none of his business he would let the participants fight it out by
themselves. Bull, sober, was not a man to seek trouble.</p>

<p>Climbing as noiselessly as possible and keeping the muzzle of
his rifle ahead of him he came presently to the crest of the narrow
ridge where he pushed his way cautiously through the brush toward
the opposite side, passing around an occasional huge outcropping of
rock that barred his progress. Presently the brush grew thinner. He
could see the opposite wall of the canyon.</p>

<p>A sharp report sounded close below him, just over the brow of
the ridge. In front of him a huge outcropping reared its
weather-worn surface twenty feet above the brush.</p>

<p>Toward this he crept until he lay concealed behind it. Then,
warily, he peered around the up-canyon edge discovering that his
hiding place rested upon the very edge of a steep declivity that
dropped perpendicularly into the bottom of the canyon. Almost below
him five Apaches were hiding among the rocks and boulders that
filled the bottom of the canyon. Upon the opposite side a single
man lay sprawled upon his belly behind another.</p>

<p>Bull could not see his face, hidden as it was beneath a huge
sombrero, but he saw that he was garbed after the fashion of a
vaquero&mdash;he might be either an American or a Mexican. That
made no difference now, however, for there were five against him,
and the five were Indians. Bull watched for a moment. He saw that
the Indians were doing all the firing, and he wondered if the man
lying across the canyon was already dead. He did not move.</p>

<p>Cautiously one of the Indians crept from cover as the other four
fired rapidly at their victim's position, then another followed him
and the three remaining continued firing, covering the advance of
their fellows.</p>

<p>Bull smiled, that grim, saturnine smile of his. There were some
red-skins in the vicinity that were due for the surprise of their
lives.</p>

<p>The two were working their way across the canyon, taking
advantage of every particle of cover. They were quite close to the
hiding place of the prone man now&mdash;in another moment the three
upon Bull's side of the canyon would cease firing and the two would
rush their unconscious quarry and finish him.</p>

<p>Bull raised his rifle to his shoulder. There followed two
reports, so close together that it was almost inconceivable that
they had come from the same weapon, and the two, who had already
risen for the final attack, crumpled among the rocks beneath the
blazing sun.</p>

<p>Instantly apprehending their danger, the other three Apaches
leaped to their feet and scurried up the canyon, searching new
cover as they ran; but it was difficult to find cover from a rifle
holding the commanding position that Bull's held.</p>

<p>It spoke again, and the foremost Indian threw his hands above
his head, spun completely around and lunged forward upon his face.
The other two dropped behind large boulders.</p>

<p>Bull glanced across the canyon. He saw that the man had raised
his head and was attempting to look around the edge of his cover,
having evidently become aware that a new voice had entered the grim
chorus of the rifles.</p>

<p>"Hit?" shouted Bull.</p>

<p>The man looked in the direction of the voice. "No," he
replied.</p>

<p>"Then why in hell don't you shoot? There's only two of them
left&mdash;they're up canyon on this side."</p>

<p>"Out of ammunition," replied the other.</p>

<p>"Well, you were in a hell of a fix," mused Bull as he watched
the concealment of the two Indians.</p>

<p>"Any more of 'em than this bunch?" he called across to the
man.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>For a long time there was silence&mdash;the quiet and peace that
had lain upon this age-old canyon since the Creation&mdash;and that
would lie upon it forever except as man, the disturber, came
occasionally to shatter it.</p>

<p>"I can't lie here all day," mused Bull. He crawled forward and
looked over the edge of the cliff. There was a sheer drop of forty
feet. He shook his head. There was a sharp report and a bullet tore
up the dirt beneath him. It was followed instantly by another
report from across the canyon.</p>

<p>Bull kept his eyes on the cover of the Indians. Not a sign of
them showed. One of them had caught him napping&mdash;that was
all&mdash;and ducked back out of sight after firing, but how was
the man across the canyon firing without ammunition?</p>

<p>"I got one then," came the man's voice, as though in answer,
"but you better lie low&mdash;he come near getting you."</p>

<p>"Thought you didn't have no ammunition," Bull called across.</p>

<p>"I crawled out and got the rifle of one of these you
potted."</p>

<p>Bull had worked his way back to his cover and to the brush
behind it and now he started up along the ridge in an attempt to
get behind the remaining Indian.</p>

<p>A minute or two later he crawled again to the edge of the ridge
and there below him and in plain sight the last of the red-skins
crouched behind a great boulder. Bull fired and missed, and then
the Apache was up and gone, racing for his pony tethered further up
the canyon. The white man shrugged, rose to his feet and sought an
easy way down into the bed of the canyon.</p>

<p>The other man had seen his action, which betokened that the
fight was over, and as Bull reached the bottom of the cliff he was
walking forward to meet him. A peculiar light entered the eyes of
each as they came face to face.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the one, "it is <i>Señor</i> Bull." He spoke now
in Spanish.</p>

<p>"Gregorio!" said Bull. "How'd they git you in this fix?"</p>

<p>"I camped just above here last night," replied the other, "and
this morning I walked down with my rifle on the chance of getting
an antelope for breakfast. They come on me from above and there you
are. They been shootin' at me since early this morning." He spoke
English with scarce the slightest accent. "You have saved my life,
<i>Señor</i> Bull, and Gregorio will not forget that."</p>

<p>"You haven't happened to see a bunch of Crazy J cows hereabouts,
have you?" inquired Bull, ignoring the other's expression of
gratitude.</p>

<p>"No, <i>Señor</i>, I have not," replied Gregorio.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll go get my horse and have a look up toward the head
of the canyon, anyway," and Bull turned and walked down to get
Blazes.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, riding up again, he passed Gregorio
coming down, the latter having found his pony and his belongings
intact at his camp.</p>

<p>"<i>A Dios, Señor</i>," called Gregorio in passing.</p>

<p>"So long," returned the American.</p>

<p>At the head of the canyon, where it narrowed to the proportions
of a gorge, Bull examined the ground carefully and saw that no
cattle had passed that way in many days; then he turned back and
rode down the canyon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, entering Cottonwood from below, Jim Weller, looking
for lost horses, passed Gregorio coming out and, recognizing him,
loosened his gun in its holster and kept one eye on the Mexican
until he had passed out of sight around the shoulder of the hill
that flanked the east side of the entrance to the canyon, for
Gregorio bore an unsavory reputation in that part of the country.
He was an outlaw with a price upon his head.</p>

<p>"Howsumever," mused Weller, "I ain't lost no outlaws&mdash;it's
hosses I'm lookin' for," and he rode on with a sigh of relief that
there was a solid hill between him and Gregorio's deadly aim. Ten
minutes later he met Bull coming down from the head of Cottonwood.
The two men drew rein with a nod.</p>

<p>Weller asked about horses, learning from Bull that there was no
stock above them in Cottonwood, but he did not mention having met
Gregorio. It was obvious to him that the two men could not have
been in Cottonwood together without having met and if Bull did not
want to mention it it was evident that he had some good reason for
not doing so. It was not the custom of the country to pry into the
affairs of others. Bull did not mention Gregorio nor did he speak
of their brush with the Apaches; but that was because he was an
uncommunicative man.</p>

<p>"I think I'll have a look up Sinkhole Canyon for them hosses,"
remarked Weller. Sinkhole was the next canyon west.</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes peeled for them Crazy J cows," said Bull, "and
I'll ride up Belter's and if I see your horses I'll run 'em down
onto the flat."</p>

<p>They separated at the mouth of Cottonwood, Weller riding toward
the west, while Bull made his way eastwardly toward Belter's Canyon
which lay in the direction of the home ranch.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Three hours later the semiweekly stage, careening down the North
Pass trail, drew up in a cloud of dust at the junction of the
Henders' Mine road at a signal from one of two men sitting in a
buckboard. As the stage slowed down one of the men leaped to the
ground, and as it came to a stop clambered to the top and took a
seat beside the driver who had greeted him with a gruff jest.</p>

<p>The new passenger carried a heavy sack which he deposited
between his feet. He also carried a sawed-off shotgun across his
knees.</p>

<p>"The Saints be praised!" exclaimed a fat lady with a rich
brogue, who occupied a seat inside the coach. "Sure an' I thought
we were after bein' held up."</p>

<p>An old gentleman with white whiskers down which a trickle of
tobacco juice had cascaded its sienna-hued way reassured her.</p>

<p>"No mum," he said, "thet's the messinger from the mine with a
bag o' bullion. This here stage ain't been held up fer three weeks.
No mum, times ain't what they uset to be with all these here
newfangled ideas about reform what are spilin' the country."</p>

<p>The fat lady looked at him sideways, disdainfully, and gathered
her skirts closer about her. The stage lurched on, the horses at a
brisk gallop, and as it swung around the next curve the fat lady
skidded into the old gentleman's lap, her bonnet tilting over one
eye, rakishly.</p>

<p>"Be off wid ye!" she exclaimed, glaring at the little old
gentleman, as though the fault were all his. She had scarcely
regained her own side of the seat when another, and opposite, turn
in the road precipitated the old gentleman into her lap.</p>

<p>"Ye spalpeen!" she shrilled, as, placing two fat hands against
him, she thrust him violently from her. "Sure, an' it's a disgrace,
it is, that a poor widdy lady can't travel in pace without the
loikes o' ye takin' advantage o' her weak an' unprotected
state."</p>

<p>The little old gentleman, though he had two huge guns strapped
at his hips, appeared thoroughly cowed and terrified&mdash;so much
so, in fact, that he dared not venture even a word of protest at
the injustice of her insinuations. From the corners of his weak and
watery blue eyes he surveyed her surreptitiously, wiped the back of
his perspiring neck with a flamboyant bandana, and shrank farther
into the corner of his seat.</p>

<p>A half hour later the stage swung through the gap at the foot of
the pass. Before it lay the rolling uplands through which the road
wound down past the Bar Y ranch house and the town of Hendersville
on the flat below. The gap was narrow and winding and the road
excruciatingly vile, necessitating a much slower pace than the
driver had been maintaining since passing the summit.</p>

<p>The horses were walking, the coach lurching from one chuck-hole
to another, while clouds of acrid dust arose in almost vapor
lightness, enveloping beasts, vehicle and passengers. Through the
nebulous curtain rising above the leaders the driver saw suddenly
materialize the figures of two men.</p>

<p>"Halt! Stick 'em up!"</p>

<p>The words snapped grimly from the taller of the two. The
messenger on the seat beside the driver made a single move to raise
his sawed-off shot gun. A six-gun barked and the messenger toppled
forward, falling upon the rump of the near wheel-horse. The horse,
startled, leaped forward into his collar. The driver attempted to
quiet him. The two men moved up beside the stage, one covering the
driver and a passenger on top, the other threatening the two
inside. The fat lady sat with her arms folded glaring at the
bandit. The little old gentleman's hands touched the top of the
stage.</p>

<p>"Stick 'em up!" said the bandit to the fat lady.</p>

<p>She did not move.</p>

<p>"Sure an' I'll not stick 'em up an inch fer the loikes o' yese,"
she shrilled; "an' lucky it is for ye, ye dhirty spalpeen, that
Mary Donovan hasn't the bit ov a gun with her&mdash;or that there
ain't a <i>man</i> along to protect a poor, helpless widdy lady,"
and she cast a withering glance of scorn in the direction of the
little old gentleman, who grew visibly red through the tan of his
weather-worn countenance.</p>

<p>The other bandit stepped to the hub of the front wheel, seized
the messenger's bag and stepped down again.</p>

<p>"Don't move, or look back, for five minutes," he admonished
them, "then pull yer freight."</p>

<p>The two then backed away up the road behind the stage, keeping
it covered with their guns. The messenger lay in the road
moaning.</p>

<p>The fat lady unfolded her arms, opened the door and stepped out.
"Get back there, you!" called one of the bandits.</p>

<p>"Go to the divil!" retorted Mary Donovan, as she stooped beside
the wounded messenger.</p>

<p>The man opened his eyes and looked about, then he essayed to
rise and with Mary Donovan's help came to his feet. "Jest a
scratch, me b'y," she said in a motherly tone as she helped him to
the stage. "Ye'll be all right the mornin'. Git a move on ye inside
there, ye ould woman with the artillery," she yelled at the little
old gentleman, "an' give this b'y a hand in."</p>

<p>Together they helped the wounded man to a seat. The bandits were
still in sight, but they had not molested her&mdash;doubtless
because she was a woman and unarmed; but no more had she deposited
the messenger upon the seat than she turned upon the old man and
wrenched one of his guns from its holster.</p>

<p>"Drive like the divil, Bill," she cried to the driver, sticking
her head out of the window, and as he whipped up his team she
turned back toward the two bandits and opened fire on them. They
returned the fire, and the fusillade continued until the stage
disappeared in a cloud of dust around a curve below the gap, the
old gentleman and the passenger on top now taking part in the
shooting.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">III. &mdash; SUSPICIONS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS the stage swirled through the dusty street of
Hendersville an hour later and drew up before The Donovan House the
loiterers about the hotel and the saloons gathered about it for the
news and the gossip from the outer world. Gum Smith, sheriff, was
among them.</p>

<p>"Stuck up again, Gum, at the gap," the driver called to him.
"They bored Mack."</p>

<p>Mary Donovan and the little old gentleman were assisting the
messenger from the stage, though he protested that he was all right
and required no assistance. As the woman's eyes alighted upon the
sheriff, she turned upon him, her arms akimbo.</p>

<p>"Sure, yese a fine spicimin uv a sheriff, Gum Smith, that ye
are&mdash;not!" she yelled in a voice that could be heard the
length of the single street. "Three holdups in the two months right
under yer nose, and all ye do is 'depatize' an' 'depatize' an'
'depatize.' Why don't ye git out an' git 'em&mdash;ye ould woman,"
she concluded scornfully, and then turning to the wounded man, her
voice instantly as soft as a lullaby.</p>

<p>"Get inside wid ye, ye poor b'y, an' Mary Donovan'll be after
makin' ye comfortable 'til we get hould uv the ould saw-bones, if
he's sober, which he ain't, or I'm no lady, which I am. Come on
now, aisy like, there's a good b'y," and she put a motherly arm
about the lad and helped him to the porch of the hotel, just as
Diana Henders appeared from the interior, attracted by the sounds
from without.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Donovan!" she exclaimed. "What has happened? Why, it's
Mack! The Black Coyote again?" she guessed quickly.</p>

<p>"Shure an' it was none other. I seen him wid me own
eyes&mdash;the black silk handkerchief about the neck uv him an'
another over his ugly face. An' his pardner&mdash;sure now I
couldn't be mishtaken wid the rollin' walk uv him&mdash;if it
wasn't that dhirty greaser, Gregorio, me name's not Mary Donovan,
which it is."</p>

<p>Together the two women helped the messenger into a bedroom where
Mary Donovan, despite the embarrassed protests of her patient,
undressed him and put him to bed while Diana Henders went to the
kitchen for hot water and cloths.</p>

<p>Mack had an ugly flesh wound in his side, and this they had
cleansed as best they could by the time the doctor arrived&mdash;a
drink-broken old man who had drifted in from the East. His
knowledge and skill were of the first rank and Hendersville boasted
that it owned the best doctor in the Territory&mdash;when he was
sober.</p>

<p>In <i>Gum's Place</i>&mdash;<i>Liquors and Cigars</i>&mdash;the
male population was listening to the account of the holdup as
expounded by the little old gentleman and the other passenger, the
latter being a stranger in the community.</p>

<p>It was he who had the floor at the moment.</p>

<p>"I never laughed so much in my life," he averred, "as when the
old woman calls the old man here the 'ould woman with the
artillery.'"</p>

<p>The little old gentleman was standing at the bar with a glass of
whiskey in his hand. Apparently with a single movement, so swift
was he, he dashed the glass and its contents in the face of the
stranger, whipped out both guns and commenced shooting.</p>

<p>A stream of lurid profanity accompanied his act, yet through the
flood of incoherent obscenity the nub of an idea occasionally
appeared, which was to the effect that "no blankety, blank tin-horn
could git gay with Wildcat Bob." Almost instantly, as if a magician
had waved his wand, the room, that had been comfortably filled with
men, became deserted, as far as human eye could discern, except for
the little old gentleman with the tobacco-dewed whiskers.</p>

<p>The front door had accommodated some, while heavy pieces of
furniture and the bar accounted for the rest&mdash;all but the
stranger with the ill-directed sense of humor. He had gone through
the back window and taken the sash with him.</p>

<p>The shooting over, the company reappeared, grinning. Most of
them knew Wildcat Bob. It had been the stranger's misfortune that
he had not.</p>

<p>"I'd orter 'a' bored him, the dinged pole-cat," growled the
little old gentleman, filling a fresh glass; "but I guess I larnt
him his lesson. The idear of him a-speakin' of Mrs. Donovan
disrespectful-like like that&mdash;callin' her the 'old woman'!
Why, she's the finest lady ever drew breath.</p>

<p>"An' says she to me, says she, 'Mister Bob,' says she, 'It's
such a relief to have a man like you along when there's danger,'
says she, but she can't stand bloodshed, bein' that timid and
shrinkin' and she begged me not to start shootin' at the varmints,
otherwise than which I shore would of messed them up somethin'
awful," interspersed with which were quite two oaths or obscenities
to each word.</p>

<p>The shooting over and quiet restored, Gum Smith made his belated
appearance. At sight of the little old gentleman he smiled
affably.</p>

<p>"Dog-gone my hide if it ain't Bob," he exclaimed, crossing the
room with extended hand. "Have a drink on the house, Bob."</p>

<p>Wildcat Bob ignored the proffered hand. "I got the dust to cover
my own drinks, <i>Mister</i> Sheriff," he replied, "an' instid of
loafin' around here buyin' drinks why ain't you-all out scoutin'
after that there Black Coyote hombre? You're shore a hell of a
sheriff, you are, Gum Smith."</p>

<p>"Don't git excited, Bob," urged the sheriff, flushing. "Give a
man time. Ah got to git me a posse, ain't Ah? Thet's jest what Ah
was allowin' to do right now, an' Ah'll start by depatizin'
yo."</p>

<p>"You'll deputize me&mdash;hell, you will, Gum Smith," returned
the old man with a snort of disgust. "I ben out with you-all
before. When you thinks danger's north you heads south. I had all
the travelin' I wants today."</p>

<p>The sheriff mumbled something beneath his breath and turned
away. Some half-hour later he rode out of town with a posse
consisting of half a dozen of his cronies and leisurely took his
way toward the gap.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>In Mrs. Donovan's sitting room Mary Donovan sat rocking
comfortably and chatting with Diana Henders. Mack had been made as
comfortable as circumstances permitted. The doctor had assured them
that he was in no danger and had gone his way&mdash;back to
<i>Gum's Place</i>&mdash;<i>Liquors and Cigars</i>.</p>

<p>"And what are you doin' in town this day, Diana?" inquired Mrs.
Donovan.</p>

<p>"I rode in with Hal Colby, he's foreman now," replied the girl.
"I wanted to buy a few things while Hal rode on over to the West
Ranch. We have some horses over there. He ought to be back any
minute now."</p>

<p>"So Colby's foreman. What's become of Bull&mdash;quit?"</p>

<p>"He got drunk again and Dad broke him. I'm so sorry for
him."</p>

<p>"Don't be after wastin' your pity on the loikes ov him," advised
Mary Donovan. "There's not the wan ov thim's fit to black your
boots, darlin'."</p>

<p>"I don't understand Bull," continued the girl, ignoring the
interruption. "Sometimes I think he's all right and then again I'm
afraid of him. He's so quiet and reserved that I feel as though no
one could ever know him, and when a man's like that, as Hal says,
you can't help but think that maybe he's done something that makes
him afraid to talk, for fear he'll give himself away."</p>

<p>"So Hal Colby was after sayin' that? Well, maybe he's right an'
maybe he's wrong. It's not Mary Donovan that'll be sayin' as don't
know. But this I do be after knowin'&mdash;they're both ov thim in
love with ye, and<sup>___</sup>"</p>

<p>"Hush, Mrs. Donovan! The boys all think they're in love with me,
but I hate to hear anyone else say it seriously. It's perfectly
silly. They'd be just as much in love with any other girl, if she
chanced to be the only girl on the ranch, as I am, and pretty
nearly the only girl in the county, too. There's Hal now. I must be
going. Good-bye, Mrs. Donovan."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, darlin', an' be after comin' over again soon. It's
that lonesome here, you never could imagine! An' what wid that ould
scoundrel back in town again, to say nothin' ov Gum Smith!"</p>

<p>"What old scoundrel?" inquired the girl.</p>

<p>"Sure, no one else but Wildcat Bob, the spalpeen!"</p>

<p>Diana Henders laughed. "He's a very persistent suitor, isn't he,
Mrs. Donovan?"</p>

<p>"Sure he's a very pestiferous shooter, that's what he
is&mdash;the ould fool. Actin' like a wild broth ov a b'y, an' him
sivinty if he's a day. He ought to be ashamed of himself, I'm
sayin'; but at that he's better than Gum Smith&mdash;say, that
man's so crooked ye could pull corks wid him."</p>

<p>The girl was still laughing as she emerged from the hotel and
mounted her pony. Hal Colby sat his horse a few yards away, talking
with half a dozen men. At sight of Diana Henders he reined about
and joined her.</p>

<p>"The boys were just telling me about the latest holdup in Hell's
Bend," he said, as they cantered, stirrup to stirrup, out of town.
"How's Mack?"</p>

<p>"The doctor says he'll be all right," replied Diana. "Just a bad
flesh wound. I don't see why something isn't done to put a stop to
these holdups. Gum Smith doesn't seem to care whether he gets The
Black Coyote or not."</p>

<p>"Oh, Gum's doin' the best he can," Colby assured her
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"You're too easy, Hal. You never like to say anything against a
man, and of course that is right, too; but the lives and property
of all of us are under Gum Smith's protection, to a greater or less
extent, and if he was the right sort he'd realize his
responsibility and make a determined effort to run down this
fellow."</p>

<p>"He went out after him with a posse&mdash;the boys just told me
so. What more can he do?"</p>

<p>"It was half an hour or more after the stage pulled in before
Gum started," she retorted. "Does he or anyone else imagine that
those two scoundrels are going to wait around the gap until Gum
gets there? And he'll be back with his posse right after dark.
He'll say he lost the trail, and that'll be the end of it until
next time."</p>

<p>The man made no reply and the two rode on in silence for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>It was the girl who spoke again first.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she said, "who this Black Coyote really is."</p>

<p>"Everybody seems pretty sure it was The Black Coyote," remarked
Colby. "How did they know?"</p>

<p>"The black silk handkerchief he uses for a mask, and the other
one about his neck," she explained. "It must be the same man.
Everyone has noticed these handkerchiefs on one of the men in every
holdup in Hell's Bend Pass during the last six months. There is
scarce any one that isn't positive that the second man is the
Mexican, Gregorio; but no one seems to have recognized the
principal."</p>

<p>"I got my own opinion," said Colby.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Do you know who The Black Coyote really
is?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't want to say that I know, exactly; but I got my own
opinion."</p>

<p>"Well!" she urged.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't want to mention no names&mdash;until I was shore.
But," after a pause, "I'd like to see his cayuse. No one ever sees
either his or his pardner's. They keep 'em hid out in the brush
alongside the trail; but I got a guess that if anyone ever seed The
Black Coyote's pony we'd all know for shore who The Black Coyote
is."</p>

<p>She did not insist further when she saw that he was apparently
shielding the name of some man whom they both knew, and whom he
suspicioned. It was only right that he should do this, she thought,
and she admired him the more for it. So they talked of other things
as they jogged along the dusty road toward home, the man riding a
stirrup's width behind that he might feast his eyes upon the
profile of his companion. As they neared the ranch they saw the
figure of a solitary horseman approaching from the north.</p>

<p>"Looks like Blazes," remarked the girl.</p>

<p>"It is," said the man. "I sent Bull up to Cottonwood this
morning. I don't see what he's doin' comin' in from the north. The
Cottonwood trail's almost due west."</p>

<p>"He might have come back along the foot hill trail," suggested
Diana.</p>

<p>"He might, but it's farther, an' I never seed a puncher yet
that'd ride any farther than you told him to."</p>

<p>"Bull's different," she replied, simply. "If you sent him out
for any purpose he'd accomplish it no matter how far he had to
ride. He's always been a good hand."</p>

<p>A moment later the ex-foreman joined them where the two trails
met. He accorded the girl the customary, "Howdy, Miss," of the
times, and nodded to Colby. His mount was streaked with sweat and
dust. It was evident that he had been ridden hard.</p>

<p>"Did you find them cows?" asked the foreman.</p>

<p>Bull nodded.</p>

<p>"In Cottonwood?"</p>

<p>"No, Belter's."</p>

<p>Diana Henders glanced at the foreman as much as to say, "I told
you so!" Then, glancing back at Bull, she noticed a reddish brown
stain on the side of his shirt, and gave a little exclamation of
concern.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bull!" she cried, "you've been hurt&mdash;that's blood,
isn't it? How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that ain't nothin', Miss, just a little scratch," and he
closed up, like a clam, spurring ahead of them.</p>

<p>Neither Colby nor the girl spoke, but both were thinking of the
same things&mdash;that Bull wore a black silk handkerchief about
his neck and that Mary Donovan had fired back upon The Black Coyote
and his confederate following the holdup in Hell's Bend earlier in
the afternoon.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Mrs. Donovan, her hands on her hips, stood just inside the
dining room door as her guests filed in for supper that evening and
seated themselves at the long deal table covered with its clean red
and white cloth. She had a good-natured word for each of them,
until her eyes alighted upon Wildcat Bob, attempting to sneak in
unnoticed behind the broad figure of Jim Weller.</p>

<p>"So-o!" she exclaimed scornfully. "Ye ould fool&mdash;yer drunk
again. Ta-ake off thim guns an' give thim to me."</p>

<p>"I haven't had a drink, Mary," expostulated the old man.</p>

<p>"Don't 'Mary' me, ye ould reprobate, an' be after givin' me thim
guns, quick!"</p>

<p>Meekly he unbuckled his belt and passed it over to her. "I was
just bringin' 'em in to you, Ma&mdash;Mrs. Donovan," he assured
her.</p>

<p>"Yed better be. Now go an' sit down. I'll feed you this night,
but don't you iver step foot into Mary Donovan's dining room again
in liquor."</p>

<p>"I tell you I ain't had a drink," he insisted.</p>

<p>"Pha-at?" The word reeked with disbelief.</p>

<p>"Only just a drop to settle the dust after we pulled in," he
qualified his original statement.</p>

<p>"Ye must uv been that dusty then!" she exclaimed scornfully.</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"Don't talk back. And did ye find yer horses, Jim Weller?" she
inquired of the big man behind whom Wildcat Bob had made his
unimpressive entrance.</p>

<p>Weller shook his head, negatively, his mouth being full of baked
beans.</p>

<p>"Patches probably run 'em off," suggested Bill Gatlin, the stage
driver.</p>

<p>"What with renegades and holdups this country ain't safe to live
in no more," remarked Mrs. Donovan. "If some of these here would-be
bad-men would git out an' shoot up the bandits and the Injuns
instid of shootin' up saloons," she stated meaningly, casting a
baneful look at Wildcat Bob.</p>

<p>"Hadn't orter be hard to find 'em, least wise one of 'em,"
stated Weller, "when every son-of-a-gun in the county knows who he
is."</p>

<p>"Meanin'?" inquired the stage driver.</p>

<p>"Gregorio, of course," said Weller. "I seen him comin' out o'
Cottonwood not three hours before the stage was stuck up, an' he
was headin' towards Hell's Bend&mdash;him an' that Bar Y Bull
feller."</p>

<p>"You mean them two was together?" asked Gatlin.</p>

<p>"Well, they warn't exactly together. Gregorio comes out fust an'
about five minutes later I meets Bull acomin' down the canyon; but
they couldn't have both been up there without t'other knowin'
it."</p>

<p>"I don't believe Bull would be doin' it," said Mary Donovan.</p>

<p>"You can't never tell nothin' about them quiet fellers,"
remarked Gatlin, sententiously.</p>

<p>There was a pounding of hoofs without, the creaking of leather
as men dismounted and a moment later the sheriff and some of his
posse entered the dining room.</p>

<p>"I suppose ye got 'em, Gum Smith," said Mrs. Donovan, with
sarcasm, "or ye wouldn't be back this soon."</p>

<p>"Ah ain't no cat, Mrs. Donovan," said the sheriff, on the
defensive, "to see in the dark."</p>

<p>"Yese ain't no sheriff nayther," she shot back.</p>

<p>Wildcat Bob succeeded in calling attention to derisive laughter
by pretending to hide it. Gum Smith looked at his rival angrily,
immediately discovering that he was unarmed.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the old woman with the
artillery&mdash;is she chokin'?" he inquired sweetly.</p>

<p>Wildcat Bob went red to the verge of apoplexy, seized a heavy
cup half-filled with coffee and started to rise.</p>

<p>"Sit down wid ye!" roared the stentorian voice of Mary
Donovan.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" started Wildcat Bob.</p>

<p>"Shut up an' sit down!"</p>

<p>The Wildcat did both, simultaneously.</p>

<p>"It's a sha-ame, that it is, that a respictable widdy lady
should be redjuced to fadin' the likes o' yese fer a livin',"
wailed Mrs. Donovan, sniffing, as she dabbed at her eyes with the
corner of her apron, "all alone and unproticted as I am. Sure an'
if poor Tim was here he'd wipe the ground wid the both ov
yese."</p>

<p>Wildcat Bob, very red and uncomfortable, ate diligently, his
eyes glued to his plate. Well did Mary Donovan know how to handle
this terror of an earlier day, whose short temper and quick guns
still held the respect and admiration of the roughest characters of
the great empire of the southwest, but whose heart could be
dissolved by a single tear.</p>

<p>As for Gum Smith, he was only too glad to be relieved of the
embarrassment of the Wildcat's further attentions and he too gave
himself willingly over to peace and supper. For the balance of the
meal, however, conversation languished.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>At the Bar Y Ranch the men sat smoking after the evening meal.
Bull was silently puffing upon a cigarette. Hal Colby, always
good-natured and laughing, told stories. During the silences Texas
Pete strove diligently to recall the half-forgotten verses of
<i>The Bad Hombre</i>.</p>

<p>But over all there hovered an atmosphere of restraint. No one
could have put his finger upon the cause, yet all sensed it. Things
were not as they had been yesterday, or for many days before.
Perhaps there was a feeling that an older man should have been
chosen to replace Bull, for Colby was one of the newer hands.
Without volition and unconsciously the men were taking sides. Some,
mostly the men who had worked longest for Henders, drew
imperceptibly nearer Bull. Texas Pete was one of them. The others
laughed a little louder, now, at Colby's stories.</p>

<p>"By gollies!" exclaimed Pete, "I remember some more of it:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"'I am the original bad un, I am;<br>
I eats 'em alive an' I don't give a damn<br>
Fer how fast they come er how many they be&mdash;<br>
Of all the bad hombres the wust one is me.'"</p>
<br>

<p class="first">sang Texas Pete. "Good night, fellers, I'm goin'
to turn in."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4">IV. &mdash; "I LOVE YOU"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DIANA HENDERS was troubled. Ever since the holdup
several days before she had not been able to expunge from her
thoughts a recollection of the sinister circumstances that pointed
an accusing finger at Bull. There had always been a deep seated
loyalty existing between the Henders and their employees and this
alone would have been sufficient to have brought the girl to arms
in the defense of the reputation of any of her father's "boys". In
the case of Bull there were added reasons why she could not bear to
foster a suspicion of his guilt.</p>

<p>Not only had he been a trusted foreman, but there was something
in the man himself, or rather in his influence upon the imagination
of the girl, that made it almost impossible for her to believe that
he had shot Mack Harber, another employee, and stolen the bullion
from her father's mine. He had always been reticent and almost shy
in her presence. He had never presumed to even the slight
familiarity of addressing her by her given name&mdash;a customary
procedure among the other men, many of whom had seen her grow so
gradually from a little girl to a young lady that they scarce yet
discerned the change.</p>

<p>Yet she knew that he liked to be with her, though she was far
from being sure that she cared for his company. He was quiet to
taciturnity and far from being the pleasant companion that she
found in Hal Colby. There was something, however, that she felt
when in his company to a much greater degree than when she was with
other men&mdash;absolute confidence in his integrity and his
ability to protect her.</p>

<p>Now she was sorry for him since his reduction from a post of
responsibility and her loyalty aroused by the inward suspicions she
had permitted herself to entertain, to the end that she was moved
by something akin to remorse to make some sort of overtures of
friendship that he might know that the daughter of his employer
still had confidence in him.</p>

<p>It was a quiet Sunday morning. The men were lazily occupying
themselves with the overhauling of their outfits, replacing worn
latigo and stirrup leather lacings, repairing hackamores and
bridles, polishing silver and guns, cleaning boots with bacon
grease and lamp black, shaving, or hair-cutting.</p>

<p>Down past the bunk-house, toward the corrals, came Diana
Henders. Presently she would pause near the men and ask one of them
to catch up a horse for her. The lucky fellow whom she asked would
ride with her.</p>

<p>It was a custom of long standing; but she was earlier than usual
this Sunday morning and several of the men worked frantically to
complete the jobs they were engaged upon before she should arrive
within speaking distance. Two or three affected attitudes of
careless idleness indicative of perfect readiness to meet any call
upon their time or services.</p>

<p>Texas Pete was cutting the hair of another puncher. He had
reached a point where his victim was entirely shorn upon one side,
the other displaying a crop of thick, brown hair four or five
inches long, when he looked up and saw Diana approaching. Pete
tossed the shears and comb into the lap of the victim.</p>

<p>"You-all don't need a hair-cut nohow," he announced, strolling
away with what he believed to be a remarkable display of
nonchalance, along a line that would, quite by accident of course,
intercept Diana's course to the corrals.</p>

<p>The deserted and disfigured puncher wheeled upon him with a loud
yell.</p>

<p>"Come back here, you knock-kneed, bowlegged, son-of-a&mdash;,"
then his eyes, too, alighted upon Diana. His fountain of speech
dried at the source, his tanned face assumed a purple cast, and in
two jumps he had reached the seclusion of the bunkhouse.</p>

<p>Hal Colby walked deliberately forward to meet the girl, a
pleasant smile of greeting upon his handsome face as he raised his
wide sombrero in salutation. Had he been on trial for his life at
that moment the entire outfit would have voted unanimously to hang
him on the spot; but, gosh, how they envied him!</p>

<p>Bull sat, apparently unmoved, with his back against a cottonwood
tree, running a wiping rag through the barrel of a revolver. He did
not even look up, though he had seen Diana Henders from the moment
that she left the house. Bull realized that after the affair in
town that had caused his downfall there was no chance for him to
ride with her again for many long days&mdash;possibly forever.</p>

<p>"Going for a ride, Di?" asked Colby, confidently, as the girl
came abreast of the men.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I was thinking of it," she replied sweetly. "I was
just going to ask Bull if he wouldn't catch up Captain for
me&mdash;the rest of you all seem so busy."</p>

<p>Colby appeared abashed but not defeated. "I haven't a thing to
do," he assured her.</p>

<p>"But I've made you ride with me so much lately, Hal," she
insisted.</p>

<p>"I'd rather ride with you than eat," he whispered.</p>

<p>Texas Pete had made a feeble pretense of searching for something
on the ground, apparently given it up in despair, and was passing
them on his way back to the bunk-house.</p>

<p>"I don't think you oughter ride with&mdash;with him, nohow,"
continued Colby.</p>

<p>The girl drew herself up, slightly. "Don't be nasty, Hal," she
said.</p>

<p>"You know I hate to say that," he assured her. "I set a heap of
store by Bull. He's one of my best friends, but after what's
happened&mdash;you can't blame me, Di. I think your dad would say
the same thing if he knew."</p>

<p>Bull was halfway to the corrals.</p>

<p>"I'll have the hosses up in a jiffy, Miss," he called back over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Hal," laughed the girl, teasingly. "You'll have
plenty of time to lay out the work for tomorrow&mdash;a foreman's
<i>always</i> busy, you know," and she walked away briskly after
Bull.</p>

<p>As Colby turned back toward the men he saw broad grins adorning
the faces of most of them. Texas Pete, just approaching the
bunk-house door, halted, removed his hat with a flourish, bowing
low.</p>

<p>"Goin' to git your hair cut, Jim?" he inquired sweetly. "You
know I'd rather cut your hair than eat."</p>

<p>A loud roar of laughter acknowledged this sally.</p>

<p>Colby, flushing crimson, beat a hasty retreat toward the
office.</p>

<p>"Which way?" asked Bull, when the two had mounted.</p>

<p>"I'm going to town to see how Mack is getting along," replied
the girl, watching his face.</p>

<p>"I seen Wildcat Bob yesterday. He said he was getting along
fine. Nothing but a flesh wound."</p>

<p>Neither his voice nor his expression betrayed more than ordinary
concern.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Mack since he was shot?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Ain't had time. Colby keeps me pretty busy. Mack was a dinged
fool fer gettin' creased anyhow," he observed. "When a feller's got
the drop on you, stick 'em up. They ain't nothin' else to do. Mack
orter known better than to make any funny gun-play with them two
hombres coverin' him."</p>

<p>"It was mighty brave of him," said Diana. "He's no
coward&mdash;and he was loyal to Dad."</p>

<p>"I don't see nothin' brave about it," he replied. "It was just
plumb foolishness. Why he didn't have a chanct on earth."</p>

<p>"That's what made his act so courageous," she insisted.</p>

<p>"Then the feller what commits suicide must be a regular hero,"
he rejoined, smiling. "I never looked at it that way. I reckon Mack
must have been aimin' to commit suicide."</p>

<p>"You're horrid, Bull. I believe you haven't any heart at
all."</p>

<p>"I shore have. Leastways I did have one until&mdash;" He
hesitated, looked at her in a peculiar way, then let his eyes drop
to his saddle horn. "Oh, shucks! what's the use?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>There was silence for a brief interval. The spirit of coquetry,
that is strong in every normal girl, prompted her to urge him on;
but a natural kindliness coupled with the knowledge that it would
be unfair to him kept her silent. It was the man who spoke again
first.</p>

<p>"I was sorry Mack got hurt," he said, defensively; "but he was
lucky he wasn't killed. That Black Coyote feller must have been a
friend of his'n."</p>

<p>"The brute!" she exclaimed. "He ought to be strung up to the
highest tree in the county."</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed, and then, with another of his rare smiles,
"let's speak to Gum Smith about it when we get to town."</p>

<p>"Gum Smith!" Were it possible to snort Gum Smith she had
accomplished it. "If an honest vote had been taken for the
<i>worst</i> man for sheriff Gum Smith would have been elected
unanimously."</p>

<p>"Why Gum's a good sheriff," he teased, "&mdash;fer tin horns and
bandits."</p>

<p>She did not reply. Her thoughts were upon the man at her side.
Nothing that he had said had exactly tended to weaken her faith in
him, yet it had not materially strengthened it, either.</p>

<p>His apparent callous indifference to Mack's suffering might have
been attributed with equal fairness to the bravado of the guilty
desperado, or to the conditions and the times in which they lived
which placed shootings and sudden death in the category of the
commonplace. His suggestion that The Black Coyote must have been a
friend of Mack, as an explanation of a flesh wound rather than a
mortal one, appeared a trifle sinister, though it was amenable to
other interpretations. On the whole, however, Diana Henders was not
wholly pleased with the result of her probing.</p>

<p>At The Donovan House they found Mack sufficiently recovered to
be able to sit upon the veranda, where there were gathered a number
of Mrs. Donovan's other guests, including Wildcat Bob and the
sheriff. Mary Donovan stood in the doorway, one hand on a hip and
the other, the fist doubled, emphasizing some forceful statement
she was delivering.</p>

<p>As Diana Henders and Bull appeared suddenly before them, the
argument, which had been progressing merrily, lapsed into an
embarrassed silence. It would have been evident to the most obtuse
that one or the other of the newcomers had been the subject of the
conversation, and neither Bull nor Diana was obtuse, the result
being that they shared the embarrassment of the others.</p>

<p>The silence, which really lasted but a brief moment, was broken
by Mary Donovan's hearty greeting to Diana, followed by a cordial
word to Bull, which was seconded by Wildcat Bob. The others,
however, spoke only to Diana Henders, appearing not to be aware of
the presence of her escort.</p>

<p>"Come now," cried Mary Donovan, "into the house wid ye an' have
a bit o' cake an' a cup o' tay." But Diana Henders did not
dismount.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Mrs. Donovan," she replied. "We just rode down
to see how Mack was getting along and to ask if there was anything
we could do for him." She turned her glance toward the wounded
man.</p>

<p>"I'm all right, Miss," he replied. "'T wasn't nothin' but a
scratch. I'll be back at the mine in a couple o' days&mdash;an'
guardin' the bullion shipments, too, same as usual." He looked
straight at Bull as he made this final statement.</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed Diana, hastily, "I'm glad you're so much
better, Mack, and if there isn't anything we can do for you we'll
start back for the ranch." She sensed the sullen attitude of most
of the men there, the scowls they cast at Bull, and she knew that
it would require little to precipitate a direct accusation, which
would have been almost certain to have been followed by gunplay.
"Come, Bull," she said, and reined her pony about.</p>

<p>They had ridden well out of town when she looked casually into
the man's face. It bore a troubled expression and he must have
guessed that she noted it.</p>

<p>"I wonder what was eatin' them fellers," he remarked. "No one
only Wildcat Bob even spoke to me, an' Mack seemed gosh-almighty
sore about somethin'. Well, they ain't none of 'em got their brand
on me. If I did shoot up Gum Smith's joint it ain't no hair offen
none of them."</p>

<p>The girl wondered if he really was ignorant of the suspicions
directed against him, or if he took this means to make her believe
that the cause of the altered attitude toward him was his drunken
gunplay in the sheriff's saloon.</p>

<p>"I was right sorry about that, Miss," he blurted suddenly. "I
never aimed for to do it. I wasn't goin' to drink too much no more
after what I'd promised you. I'm right sorry. Do you think that,
maybe, you&mdash;you might forgive me&mdash;and give me another
chance?"</p>

<p>His voice was pleading and he was very much in earnest. The girl
knew how difficult it was for a rough man like Bull to say what he
had just said and she felt a sudden compassion for him.</p>

<p>"It made me sorry, too, Bull," she said. "I trusted you and I
hated to be so disappointed in you."</p>

<p>"Please don't say you don't trust me, Miss," he begged. "I want
you to trust me, more'n anything else."</p>

<p>"I want to trust you, Bull," and then, impulsively: "I do trust
you!"</p>

<p>He reached across the interval between them and laid his rough
hand upon her soft one.</p>

<p>"I love you, Diana," he said, very simply and with a quiet
dignity that was unmarred by any hesitancy or embarrassment.</p>

<p>She started to speak, but he silenced her with a gesture.</p>

<p>"Don't say anything about it, please," he urged. "I don't expect
you to love me; but there's nothing wrong about my loving you. I
just wanted you to know it so that you'd always know where I stood
and that you could always call on me for anything. With yer dad an'
all the other men around that loves you there isn't much likelihood
that you'll ever need me more'n another, but it makes me feel
better to know that you know now. We won't talk about it no more,
Miss. We both understand. It's the reason I didn't quit when yer
dad busted me."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you told me, Bull," she said. "It's the greatest honor
that any man can bestow upon a girl. I don't love any man, Bull,
that way; but if ever I do he'll know it without my telling him.
I'll do something that will prove it&mdash;a girl always does.
Sometimes, though, the men are awfully blind, they say."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be blind," said Bull. "I'd know it, I think, if a
girl loved me."</p>

<p>"The right one will, some day," she assured him.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I hope so, Miss."</p>

<p>She flushed, sensing the unintentional <i>double entendre</i> he
had caught in her words. She wondered why she flushed.</p>

<p>They rode on in silence. She was sorry that Bull loved her, but
she was glad that, loving her, he had told her of his love. He was
just a common cow-hand, unlettered, rough, and occasionally
uncouth, but of these things she did not think, for she had known
no other sort, except her father and an occasional visitor from the
East, since childhood. Had she cared for him she would not have
been ashamed. She looked up at him with a smile.</p>

<p>"Don't call me 'Miss,' Bull, please&mdash;I hate it."</p>

<p>"You want me to call you by your first name?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"The other men do," she said, "and you did&mdash;a moment
ago."</p>

<p>"It slipped out that time." He grinned sheepishly.</p>

<p>"I like it."</p>

<p>"All right, Miss," he said.</p>

<p>The girl laughed aloud, joyously.</p>

<p>"All right, Diana, I mean," he corrected himself.</p>

<p>"That's better."</p>

<p>So Diana Henders, who was really a very sensible girl, instead
of merely playing with fire, made a big one of a little one, all
very unintentionally, for how was she to know that to Bull the
calling of her Diana instead of Miss was almost as provocative to
his love as would have been the personal contact of a kiss to an
ordinary man?</p>

<p>As they approached the ranch house at the end of their ride they
saw a buckboard to which two bronchos were harnessed hitched to the
tie rail beneath the cottonwoods outside the office door.</p>

<p>"Whose outfit is that?" asked Diana. "I never saw it
before."</p>

<p>"The Wainrights from the north side o' the hills. I seen 'em in
town about a week ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I've heard of them. They're from the East. Mr.
Wainright don't like the country north of the mountains."</p>

<p>"He's lookin' fer range on this side," said Bull. "Like as not
that's what he's here fer now. They ain't enough water fer no more
outfits though, nor enough feed neither."</p>

<p>They drew rein at the corral and dismounted. "Thanks, Bull,"
said the girl, as she passed him her bridle reins. "We've had a
lovely ride."</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;Diana."</p>

<p>That was all he said, but the way he spoke her name was
different from the way any other man had ever spoken it. She was
sorry now that she had asked him to call her Diana.</p>

<p>As she was passing the office to go to her room her father
called to her.</p>

<p>"Come in, Di; I want you to meet some new neighbors," and when
she had entered, "My daughter, Mr. Wainright."</p>

<p>Diana extended her hand to a fat man with close-set eyes, and
then her father presented the younger Wainright.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jefferson Wainright, Jr., Diana," he said.</p>

<p>The son was a well-groomed appearing, nice-looking young fellow
of twenty-one or twenty-two. Perhaps his costume was a trifle too
exaggerated to be in good taste, but he had only fallen into the
same mistake that many another wealthy young Easterner has done
before and since upon his advent to the cow-country. From silver
banded sombrero to silver encrusted spurs there was no detail
lacking.</p>

<p>"By gollies, he looks like a Christmas tree," had been Texas
Pete's observation the first time that he had seen him. "All they
forgot was the candles."</p>

<p>"You live north of the mountains?" inquired Diana, politely.</p>

<p>"Yep," replied the elder Wainright; "but we don't calc'late to
stay there. We're from
Mass'chusetts&mdash;Worcester&mdash;blankets&mdash;made a fortune
in 'em&mdash;made 'em for the gover'ment mostly. Jeff got it in his
head he wanted to go into the cattle business&mdash;come by it
natch'ral I allow. I used to be in the livery stable business
before I bought the mills&mdash;so when he graduates from Harvard a
year ago we come out here&mdash;don't like it tother side the
mountains&mdash;so I calc'lates to come over here."</p>

<p>"I was just explaining to Mr. Wainright that there is scarcely
enough feed or water for another big outfit on this side,"
interjected Mr. Henders.</p>

<p>"Don't make any difference&mdash;set your price&mdash;but set it
right. I'll buy you out. I c'd buy half this territory I
calc'late&mdash;if I had a mind to&mdash;but the price's got to be
right. Ol' Jeff Wainright's got a name for bein' a pretty shrewd
trader&mdash;fair'n honest, though&mdash;fair'n honest. Just name
your price&mdash;how much for the whole shebang&mdash;buildin's,
land, cattle&mdash;everything?"</p>

<p>Elias Henders laughed good naturedly. "I'm afraid they're not
for sale, Mr. Wainright."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut! I'll get 'em&mdash;you'll sell&mdash;ol' Jeff
Wainright's always got everything he went after. Well, son, I
calc'late we'd better be goin'."</p>

<p>"You'll have dinner with us first, of course," insisted Diana;
"it must be almost ready now."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mind if we do," returned the elder Wainright, and
so they stayed for the noon day meal.</p>

<p>Diana found the younger Wainright a pleasant, affable companion.
He was the first educated man near her own age that she had ever
met and his conversation and his ways, so different from those of
the rough vaqueros of her little world, made a profound impression
upon her. He could talk interestingly from the standpoint of
personal experience of countless things of which she had only
secondhand knowledge acquired from books and newspapers. Those
first two hours with him thrilled her with excitement&mdash;they
opened a new world of wondrous realities that she had hitherto
thought of more as unattainable dreams than things which she
herself might some day experience.</p>

<p>If he had inherited something of his father's egotism she forgot
it in the contemplation of his finer qualities and in the pleasure
she derived from association with one somewhere near her own social
status in life. That the elder Wainright was impossible she had
sensed from the first, but the son seemed of different fiber and no
matter what his antecedents, he must have acquired something of
permanent polish through his college associations.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The disquieting effect of the Wainrights' visit was apparent
elsewhere than at the ranch house. There was gloom at the
bunk-house.</p>

<p>"Dog-gone his hide!" exclaimed Texas Pete.</p>

<p>"Whose?" inquired Shorty.</p>

<p>"My ol' man's. If he hadn't gone an' got hung he might 'a' sent
me to Havaad. What chanct has a feller got agin one o' them
paper-collared, cracker-fed dudes anyway!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">V. &mdash; THE ROUND-UP</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"I HAD a letter from Wainright in the mail today,
Di," said Elias Henders to his daughter about a week later. "He is
after me again to put a price on the whole 'shebang'."</p>

<p>"We could go East and live then, couldn't we?" asked the
girl.</p>

<p>Henders looked at her keenly. There had been just the tiniest
trace of wistfulness in her tone. He crossed the room and put an
arm about her.</p>

<p>"You'd like to go East and live?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I love it here, Dad; but there is so much there that we can
never have here. I should like to see how other people live. I
should like to go to a big hotel, and to the theaters and opera,
and meet educated people of my own age. I should like to go to
parties where no one got drunk and shot the lights out," she
concluded with a laugh.</p>

<p>"We don't have to sell out to go back," he told her. "I am
afraid I have been selfish. Because I never wanted to go back after
your mamma left us, I forgot that you had a right to the same
advantages that she and I enjoyed. The ranch seemed
enough&mdash;the ranch and you."</p>

<p>"But there'd be no one to manage things if you went away," she
insisted.</p>

<p>"Oh, that could be arranged. I thought you felt that we couldn't
afford to go unless we sold."</p>

<p>"It would be nice if you were relieved of all responsibility,"
she said. "If you sold the ranch and the brand you wouldn't have to
worry about how things were going here."</p>

<p>"Old Wainright wouldn't pay what they are worth, even if I was
ready to sell," he explained. "I'll tell you what I'll
do&mdash;I'll make him a price. If he takes it I'll sell out, and
anyway, whether he does or not, we'll go East to stay, if you like
it."</p>

<p>"What price are you going to ask?"</p>

<p>"Seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the ranch and the
brand. They might bring more if I wanted to make an effort to get
more, but that will show a fair profit for us and I know will be
satisfactory to John. He has asked me a dozen times in his letters
why I didn't sell the cattle end of the business and come
East."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know Uncle John has always wanted us to come back," she
said.</p>

<p>"But old Wainright really doesn't want the ranch and cattle at
all," said her father. "What he wants is the mine. He has offered
me a million dollars for all our holdings in the county, including
the mine. He mentions the fact that the workings have pretty nearly
petered out, and he's right, and he thinks I'll grab at it to
unload.</p>

<p>"I suspect he's had a man up there for the past six
months&mdash;the new bookkeeper that Corson sent out while your
Uncle John Manill was in Europe&mdash;and he thinks he's discovered
something that I don't know&mdash;but I do. For years, Di, we've
been paralleling a much richer vein than the one we've been
working. I've known it for the past two years, but John and I
figured we'd work out the old one first&mdash;we've all the money
we need anyway. The mine alone is worth ten or twenty
millions."</p>

<p>"Uncle John knows it? There wouldn't be any danger that someone
might trick him into a deal?"</p>

<p>"Not a chance, and of course, as you know, he wouldn't do
anything without consulting me. Ours is rather a peculiar
partnership, Di, but it's a very safe one for both of us. There
isn't the scratch of a pen between us as far as any written
agreement is concerned, but he trusts me and I trust him. Why
before either of us married the only precautions we took to
safeguard our interests was to make our wills&mdash;I left
everything to him and he left everything to me. After we married we
made new wills, that was all.</p>

<p>"If I die first everything goes to him, and when he dies it is
all divided equally between our surviving heirs; or just the other
way around if he dies first. Each of us felt that we could thus
best safeguard the interests of our respective families, since we
both had implicit confidence in the other's honesty and
integrity."</p>

<p>"Oh, let's not talk about it," exclaimed the girl. "Neither one
of you is ever going to die."</p>

<p>"All right, Di," laughed her father; "just as you
say&mdash;you've always had your own way. Now we'll plan that
Eastern trip. Can't very well go until after the spring round-up,
and in the meantime we can be sizing up Colby. If he takes hold all
right we couldn't do better than to leave him in charge. I never
did like the idea of importing a new man as superintendent if you
could possibly use one of your own men. What do you think of him,
Di?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet Dad," she replied. "I like him immensely, and
I think he's honest and loyal, but he don't know stock, nor the
range, as well as Bull."</p>

<p>"Bull is out of the question," replied her father. "I could
never trust him again."</p>

<p>"I know how you feel. I feel the same way, and yet there is
something about him, Dad&mdash;I can't explain it; but when I am
with him I cannot doubt him."</p>

<p>"He's got you hypnotized. I hope he hasn't been making love to
you," he concluded, seriously.</p>

<p>"Oh, they all do," she cried, laughing; "but Bull least of
all."</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll have to be marrying one of these days, and if
you were going to live here I'd rather you married a Western boy;
but if you are going East you mustn't fall in love yet, for you are
sure to find a great difference between the boys you have known and
the boys back there."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Dad, I haven't fallen in love yet; but if I do
soon I'm afraid it's going to be either Hal Colby or Jefferson
Wainright."</p>

<p>"Senior?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't he funny&mdash;and impossible!" she cried.</p>

<p>"He's all of that and more too," replied her father.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw a bull
by the tail. He's one of those blue-bellied Yankees who considers
any means as honest that keep him on the right side of a jail door;
but the boy appears to be a much more decent sort."</p>

<p>"He is delightful and wonderful," said Diana.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The days passed, lovely, sunshiny days during which Diana spent
long hours dreaming of the coming Eastern trip. She rode much, as
usual, sometimes with one man, again with another, but more often
with her father or Hal Colby.</p>

<p>Bull's assignments usually took him too far afield for her to
accompany him. If he thought that Colby had some such purpose in
mind when he laid out the work from day to day he said nothing of
it; but he could not have failed to notice that following each of
the few occasions upon which Diana accompanied him, usually a
Sunday, he was given work the next day that kept him in the saddle
until late at night, and upon several occasions away from the ranch
for two days or more.</p>

<p>At last the time of the spring rodeo arrived. Riders from other
outfits commenced straggling in, some from a hundred miles away,
until the Bar Y Ranch commenced to take on the appearance of an
army camp. The chuck wagon was overhauled and outfitted. The
<i>cavvy</i> was brought over from West Ranch&mdash;wild,
half-broken horses, with a sprinkling of colts that had never felt
leather&mdash;and assigned to the riders. There were enough to give
each man a string of eight horses.</p>

<p>With the others came Jefferson Wainright, Jr., arrayed like
Solomon. At first the men had a lot of fun with him, but when he
took it good-naturedly they let up a bit, and after a few evenings,
during which he sang and told stories, they accepted him almost as
one of them. He was much with Diana Henders, with the result that
he found himself with four unbroken bronchs in his string. The Bar
Y hands grinned when Colby picked them for him, and everyone was
present when he first essayed to ride one of them.</p>

<p>Diana was there too. She chanced to be standing near Bull when
the first of the four, having been roped, thrown and hogtied, was
finally saddled, bridled and let up. It was a ewe-necked,
wall-eyed, Roman-nosed pinto and its back was humped like a
camel's.</p>

<p>"He shore looks mean," remarked Bull to the girl.</p>

<p>"They ought not to let Mr. Wainright ride him," she replied.
"He's not used to bad horses and he may be killed."</p>

<p>"I reckon that's just about how Hal figgered it," said Bull.</p>

<p>"I didn't think it of him. It's a shame!" she exclaimed. "Some
one ought to top that horse for Mr. Wainright&mdash;some one who
can ride&mdash;like you, Bull," she added flatteringly.</p>

<p>"You want me to?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't want to see the poor man killed."</p>

<p>Bull stepped forward and climbed into the corral. Wainright was
standing several feet from the pinto watching several men who were
trying to readjust the blind over the brute's eyes. Bull saw that
the man was afraid.</p>

<p>"Want me to top him for you, young feller?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Don't you think he's safe?" asked Wainright.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he's safe&mdash;like a Kansas cyclone."</p>

<p>Wainright grinned a sickly grin. "I'd appreciate it," he said,
"if you'd try him first. I'd be glad to pay you for your
trouble."</p>

<p>Bull approached the men with the horse. "Lead him out," he said.
"When I rides one like that I wants elbow room."</p>

<p>They ran the pony, bucking, out of the corral. Bull stepped to
the animal's side.</p>

<p>"What you doin'?" demanded Colby, who had been standing too far
away to overhear the conversation.</p>

<p>"Toppin' this one for the dude," replied Bull.</p>

<p>"No you're not," snapped Colby. His voice was angry. "You'll
ride the hosses I tells you to and so will he."</p>

<p>"I'm ridin' this one," replied Bull. He had grasped the cheek
strap with his left hand, his right was on the horn of the saddle.
Carefully he placed his left foot in the stirrup. Then he nodded to
a man standing at the horse's head.</p>

<p>The blind was snatched away and the man leaped aside. The horse
reared, wheeled and struck at Bull, but Bull was not there&mdash;he
was in the saddle. The animal lunged forward awkwardly once, then
he gathered himself, stuck his nose between his front feet and went
to pitching, scientifically and in earnest, and as he pitched he
lunged first to the right and then to the left, twisting his body,
squealing and kicking. Bull waved his sombrero and slapped the
beast on neck and rump with it and the pinto bucked the harder.</p>

<p>Finding that these tactics failed to unseat the rider he
commenced suddenly to turn end for end in air at each jump, yet
still the man stuck, until the beast, frantic with combined terror
and rage, stopped in his tracks and turned savagely to bite at
Bull's legs. Just a moment of this until he felt the sting of the
quirt and then he reared quickly and threw himself over backward in
an effort to crush his rider, nor did he miss him by a matter of
more than inches.</p>

<p>There are those who will tell you just how you should throw
yourself safely to one side when a horse falls, but any man who has
had a horse fall with him, or deliberately throw himself backward,
knows that it is five parts chance and the rest luck if he isn't
caught, and so it was just luck that Bull fell clear.</p>

<p>Diana Henders felt a sudden lump in her throat and then she saw
the horse scramble to his feet and the rider too, just in time to
throw a leg across the saddle, and come up with a firm seat and
both feet in the stirrups. The quirt fell sharply first on one
flank and then on the other, the pinto took a dozen running jumps
and then settled down to a smooth run across the open.</p>

<p>Five minutes later he came loping back, blowing and sweaty,
still trembling and frightened, but with the hump out of his
back.</p>

<p>"You kin ride him now," said Bull to young Wainright, as he
dismounted carefully and stood stroking the animal's neck.</p>

<p>Hal Colby came forward angrily, but Bull had dismounted close to
where Diana Henders stood, and it was she who spoke to him first,
and Colby, approaching, heard her words.</p>

<p>"Thank you, ever so much, Bull," she said. "I was sorry
afterwards that I asked you to ride him, for I thought you were
going to be hurt when he threw himself&mdash;I should never have
forgiven myself."</p>

<p>"Shucks!" said Bull. "It wasn't nothin'."</p>

<p>Colby walked off in another direction. If there had been bad
blood between the two men in the past it had never been given
outward expression, but from that moment Colby made little or no
effort to hide the fact that he had no use for Bull, while the
latter in many little ways showed his contempt for the foreman.</p>

<p>Better friendships than had ever existed between these two have
been shattered because of a woman, but there were other exciting
causes here. That Colby had gotten Bull's job might have been
enough to cause a break, while the foreman's evident suspicion that
Bull knew a great deal too much about the holdups in Hell's Bend
and the shooting of Mack Harber would have turned even more
generous natures than Hal Colby's against the ex-foreman.</p>

<p>In spite of herself Diana Henders could not deny a feeling of
chagrin that Jefferson Wainright had permitted another man to top a
bad horse for him, although it had been she who had arranged it.
Perhaps she was a trifle cool to the young Easterner that evening,
but she thawed gradually beneath the geniality of his affable ways
and entertaining conversation, and in the weeks that followed,
during which she accompanied the outfit throughout the round-up,
she was with him much of the time, to the great discomfiture of Hal
Colby and others.</p>

<p>The Bar Y foreman had, however, after the day that Bull rode the
pinto for Wainright, left the latter severely alone, for the
following morning Elias Henders had come to the corral and selected
a new string of horses for the "dude" and spoken a few words into
the ear of his foreman.</p>

<p>The long, hard days in the saddle left them all ready to turn in
to their blankets soon after supper. A smoke, a little gossip and
rough banter and the men jingled away through the darkness in
search of their bed-rolls to the accompaniment of their tinkling
spurs.</p>

<p>"I seen Injun signs today," remarked a tall, thin Texan one
evening. "'Bout a dozen of 'em been campin' over yender a piece in
them hills. Signs warn't over four hour old."</p>

<p>"They mought be peaceable Injuns on pass from the reservation,"
suggested another.</p>

<p>"More likely they're renegades," said Shorty. "Anyhow I ain't
a-takin' no chances on no Injuns&mdash;I shoots fust an' axes for
their pass later."</p>

<p>"You ain't never seed a hos-tyle Injun, Shorty," said Texas
Pete.</p>

<p>"A lot you know about it, you sawed-off, hammered-down,
squint-eyed horse thief," retorted Shorty courteously; "I'm a bad
man with Injuns."</p>

<p>"By gollies!" exclaimed Pete, "thet reminds me of another
verse:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"'So bring on yore bad men, yore killers an'
sich<br>
An' send out some Greasers to dig me a ditch,<br>
Fer when I gits through, ef I takes any pains,<br>
You'll need a big hole fer to plant the remains.'"</p>
<br>

<p>On the opposite side of the chuck wagon, where a tent had been
pitched for Diana Henders, a little group surrounded her fire.
Beside the girl there were her father, Hal Colby and Jefferson
Wainright, Jr. The two young men always gravitated in Diana's
direction when off duty. Colby had been quick to realize the
advantage that the other's education gave him and bright enough to
remain a silent observer of his manners and conversation. Inwardly
he held the Easterner in vast contempt, yet he cultivated him and
often rode with him that he might learn from him something of those
refinements which he guessed constituted the basis of Diana's
evident liking for Wainright. He asked him many questions, got him
to talk about books, and made mental note of various titles with
the determination to procure and read the books that he had heard
the man discuss with Diana.</p>

<p>Bull, on his part, kept away from the Henders' fire in the
evening and in the day time Colby saw to it that his assignments
sent him far afield from where there was much likelihood of Diana
being, with the result that he saw less of her than was usual at
home.</p>

<p>The ex-foreman's natural reserve had degenerated almost to
sullenness. He spoke seldom and never smiled, but he rode hard and
did his work well, until he came to be acknowledged as the best
all-round man in the outfit. There was no horse that he wouldn't
ride, no risk that he wouldn't take, no work that he would ever
refuse, no matter how unfair the assignment, with the result that
the men respected him though there was none who seemed to like his
company, with the exception of Texas Pete.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," said Elias Henders, rising, "I guess we'd better
be turning in. Tomorrow's going to be a hard day."</p>

<p>The two younger men rose, Colby stretching and yawning. "I
reckon you're right, Mr. Henders," he agreed, but waiting for
Wainright to make the first move to leave. The latter paused to
roll a cigarette&mdash;an accomplishment that he had only recently
brought to a state even approximating perfection. He used both
hands and was rather slow. Colby eyed him, guessing that he was
merely fighting for time in order to force the foreman to go first.
Slowly the latter withdrew his own pouch of tobacco from his shirt
pocket.</p>

<p>"Reckon I'll roll a smoke by the light of your fire, Di, before
I go," he remarked.</p>

<p>He creased the paper, poured in a little tobacco, and, as he
drew the pouch closed with his teeth and left hand, deftly rolled
the cigarette with his right, bending it slightly in the center to
keep it from opening up. Wainright realized that if he had a
conversational advantage over Colby there were other activities in
which the foreman greatly outshone him. Rolling a smoke was one of
them and that was doubtless why Colby had chosen to roll one at a
moment that odious comparison might be made.</p>

<p>Wainright lighted his and shifted to the other foot. Would Colby
never leave! Colby permitted three matches to burn out before he
finally succeeded in getting a light, thus gaining a considerable
advantage in time over Wainright. Elias Henders had repaired to his
blankets, just beyond Diana's tent and out of sight.</p>

<p>The girl realized the game that the two men were playing and
could scarce repress an inclination to laughter. She wondered which
would win, or if she would have to call it a draw and send them
both about their business. Wainright decided the matter.</p>

<p>"Come on, Colby," he said, throwing an arm about the other's
shoulders, "we're keeping Miss Henders up. Good night, Miss
Henders," and raising his hat he moved off, taking Colby with him.
They had taken about twenty steps when Wainright halted and wheeled
about.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Miss Henders," he called, "there's something I
wanted to ask you," and he started back. "Don't wait for me,
Colby," he threw over his shoulder; "I'll be along in a
moment."</p>

<p>Colby glared at the other's retreating back through the
darkness, hurled his cigarette to the ground and stamped away, out
generaled. "I'll get him yet," he mumbled. "He may be pretty slick
at them parlor tricks, but they ain't many parlors in Arizona. The
damn dude!"</p>

<p>Wainright rejoined Diana by the fire. "It's too beautiful an
evening to go to bed," he said, "and I haven't had half a chance to
talk with you. Colby hangs around as though he had a mortgage on
your time and was going to foreclose. He sort of puts a damper on
conversation unless it revolves about cows&mdash;that's all he can
talk about."</p>

<p>"It's a subject that is always of interest to us out here,"
replied the girl loyally. "Cows are really our lives, you
know."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right for men; but there are other things in
life for a girl like you, Miss Henders. You deserve something
better than cows&mdash;and cowboys. You love music and books, and
you can't deny that you like to talk about them. You belong
East&mdash;you belong back in Boston."</p>

<p>"We're going back, not to Boston, but to New York, after the
round-up&mdash;Dad and I," she told him.</p>

<p>"No! really? How funny! I've got to go back too. Maybe we could
all go together."</p>

<p>"That would be fine," she agreed.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to stay back there?" he asked, almost
excitedly, and then quite unexpectedly he took her hand. "Miss
Henders!" he exclaimed. "Diana! Wouldn't you like to stay there
always? I'd make a home for you there&mdash;I'd make you
happy&mdash;I love you, Diana. We could be married before we left.
Wouldn't it be wonderful, going back there together on our
honeymoon! And then to Europe! We could travel everywhere. Money
would mean nothing. I don't have to tell you how rich we are."</p>

<p>"No," she replied, "I have heard your father mention it," and
withdrew her hand from his.</p>

<p>He did not seem to notice the allusion to his father's
boastfulness.</p>

<p>"Tell me that you love me," he insisted. "Tell me that you will
marry me."</p>

<p>"But I don't know that I do love you," she replied. "Why, I
scarcely know you, and you certainly don't know me well enough to
know that you would want to live with me all the rest of your
life."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do!" he exclaimed. "If there was only some way to
prove it. Words are so futile&mdash;they cannot express my love,
Diana. Why, I worship you. There is no sacrifice that I would not
willingly and gladly make for you or yours. I would die for you,
dear girl, and thank God for the chance!"</p>

<p>"But I don't want you to die for me. I want you to go to bed and
give me a chance to think. I have never been in love. Possibly I
love you and do not know it. There is no need for haste anyway. I
will give you my answer before I go East. Now run along, like a
good boy."</p>

<p>"But tell me, darling, that I may hope," he begged.</p>

<p>"You will do that anyway, if you love me," she told him,
laughingly, as she turned and entered her tent. "Good night!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6">VI. &mdash; THE RENEGADES</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE next morning Colby took Wainright with him.
Deep in the foreman's heart was a determination to ride hard over
the roughest country he could find and if the "dude" got killed it
wouldn't be Colby's fault&mdash;nor would it be Colby's fault if he
didn't. But the foreman's plans were upset at the last moment by
Elias Henders and Diana, who elected to accompany him.</p>

<p>"You and Wainright ride ahead, Hal," directed Henders, "and Di
and I will trail along behind."</p>

<p>The foreman nodded silently and put spurs to his pony, and in
silence Wainright loped at his side. The arrangement suited neither
and each was busy concocting schemes whereby the other might be
paired off with Elias Henders, though under ordinary circumstances
either would have been highly elated at the prospect of spending a
whole day in company with "the old man."</p>

<p>"Glorious morning!" ejaculated Henders to his daughter. "God may
have forgotten Arizona in some respects, but he certainly
remembered to give her the most wonderful mornings in the
world."</p>

<p>"Don't they fill one with the most exquisite sensations!" she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Almost as intoxicating as wine," he agreed, and then: "By the
way, Bull's been doing fine, hasn't he? I don't believe he's
touched a drop since that night at Gum's."</p>

<p>"He's working hard, too," said the girl.</p>

<p>"He always did that&mdash;he's the best cow-hand I ever saw and
a hog for work. There isn't a man in seven counties that can
commence to touch him when it comes to riding, roping, parting,
calling brands, judging ages or weights, or handling cattle with
judgment under any conditions, nor one that knows the range within
a hundred miles like he does. Why, day before yesterday he had to
give a fellow from the Red Butte country some pointers about the
fellow's own range&mdash;Bull knew it better than he did."</p>

<p>"He's wonderful," said Diana. "I love to see him in the saddle,
and anywhere in the cow-country he fits into the picture. I'm
always proud that Bull is one of our men. Oh, I hope he don't ever
drink again."</p>

<p>Elias Henders shook his head. "I'm afraid he'll never quit," he
said. "A man's got to have something to quit for, and Bull has no
incentive to stop&mdash;only just his job, and when did a little
thing like a job keep a man from drinking, especially the best
cow-hand in the territory? There isn't an outfit anywhere that
wouldn't hire him, drunk or sober. He don't seem to be hanging
around you much lately, Di, and I'm glad of that. I'd hate to see
you interested in a man like Bull. I don't take much to garrulous
people, but neither do I want 'em as tightmouthed as Bull. I'm
afraid he's got something to hide that makes him afraid to talk for
fear he'll let it out."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose happened last night, Dad?" asked Diana,
suddenly.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure&mdash;what?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Jefferson Wainright proposed to me."</p>

<p>"No! What did you tell him?"</p>

<p>"What should I have told him?"</p>

<p>"That depends upon how much or little you think of him," replied
her father.</p>

<p>"Would you like him for a son-in-law?"</p>

<p>"If you choose him, I shall like him&mdash;I should like the
Devil if you chose to marry him."</p>

<p>"Well, he isn't quite as bad as all that, is he?" she cried,
laughing.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it that way. He seems to be a nice boy. He could
give you everything and he could take you among the sort of people
that you belong among, and you wouldn't have to be ashamed of him;
but I don't like his father."</p>

<p>"His father is something of an embarrassment," she assented.</p>

<p>"Do you love the boy, Di?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know, and I told him so. He wants me to marry him
before we go East, and all go together."</p>

<p>"What a lovely idea&mdash;taking your fathers on a honeymoon!
You can count me out, and anyway if some other man is going to take
you East I won't have to go at all."</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't gone with him, yet. I told him I'd give him his
answer before we left."</p>

<p>"That would be a good idea&mdash;if he is going&mdash;he might
want a few minutes' notice," he bantered, "but how about Hal? I
thought you leaned a little in that direction."</p>

<p>"I do," laughed the girl. "When I'm with one I like that one
best, and when I'm with the other I like him."</p>

<p>"And when they are both with you at the same time&mdash;possibly
you can find your answer there."</p>

<p>"I have thought of that, because then I always compare the
two&mdash;and Hal always suffers by the comparison. That is when we
are sitting talking&mdash;but when they are in the saddle it is the
other way round."</p>

<p>"People can't spend their married lives in the saddle," he
reminded her.</p>

<p>She sighed. "I am terribly perplexed. Of only one thing am I
sure and that is that I shall marry either Hal Colby or Jefferson
Wainright."</p>

<p>"Or some one else," he suggested.</p>

<p>"No! no one else," she stated emphatically.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>It was past noon and they had turned back, gathering up the
little bunches of cattle that they had driven down out of canyon
and coulee onto the flat below. Elias Henders and Diana were riding
quite apart from the foreman and Wainright when Henders turned back
to ride to the summit of a low elevation for a final survey of the
country for any straggling bunch that might have escaped their
notice. Diana was a few yards in rear of him as he drew rein on top
of the hillock. It was very quiet. The cattle were at a distance
from them, moving slowly off down the valley. There was only the
sound of her horse's unshod hoofs in the soft dirt and the subdued
noise of a well-worn saddle as she urged her mount toward the side
of her father.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was the crack of a rifle and Elias Henders' horse
dropped in its tracks. Henders fell clear and whipped out his
revolver.</p>

<p>"Get out of here, Di!" he called to the girl. "It's Indians.
You've got time if you keep behind this butte and ride like
Hell."</p>

<p>She turned and looked toward the two men a quarter of a mile
away&mdash;Colby and Wainright. She saw them wheel their horses and
look toward the point from which the shot had come and from their
position she guessed that they could see the Indians, though she
could not.</p>

<p>Then she saw Hal Colby put spurs and quirt to his mount until
the wiry beast fairly flew over the ground toward her. Wainright
hesitated, looked toward the Indians and then back down the valley
in the direction of the camp fifteen miles away. Suddenly he
wheeled his horse and dashed off.</p>

<p>To her mind flashed the impassioned words that he had poured
into her ears only the night before: "I worship you. There is no
sacrifice that I would not willingly and gladly make for you or
yours. I would die for you, dear girl, and thank God for the
chance!"</p>

<p>Her lip curled and her eyes shot a single scornful glance in the
direction of the retreating figure of Jefferson Wainright before
she turned them back toward Colby. How magnificent he was! He had
drawn one of his six-guns and was riding, not for the hill, but
straight for the Indians, and just as he passed out of her sight
behind the hillock he opened fire. She could hear the crack of his
gun mingling with those of the Indians, and then her father,
pausing in his fire, turned to her again.</p>

<p>"My God, Di, haven't you gone?" he cried. "Hurry! There is time
yet. Hal has got 'em on the run now, but they'll be back again.
There must be a dozen of them. Ride back to camp for help."</p>

<p>"Mr. Wainright has already gone, Dad," she told him. "We have
always been together, all my life, Dad, and it don't take two to
get help. We need all the guns here we can get until the boys
come," and she dismounted and crawled to his side, despite his
protests.</p>

<p>Over the crest of the hill she could see Colby galloping toward
them, while the Indians, a quarter of a mile beyond him, were just
circling back in pursuit. In the foreground a dead Indian lay
sprawled in the open. To the right a riderless pony was loping away
to join its fellows.</p>

<p>Diana lay a few feet from her father, both in readiness to cover
Colby's retreat when the Indians came within revolver range.</p>

<p>"Wish we had a couple of rifles," remarked Elias Henders. "If I
had a thirty-thirty I could hold 'em off alone until the boys get
here."</p>

<p>"We ought to be able to hold out for an hour, Dad. The boys
should be here in that time."</p>

<p>"We'll do the best we can, but, Di&mdash;" he paused, a little
catch in his voice&mdash;"don't let them get you, dear. The boys
might not get here in time.</p>

<p>"Wainright is not much of a rider&mdash;he won't make the time
that one of our boys would. They'd kill the horse, but they'd get
there. And then there may not be anyone in camp but the cook that
time of day&mdash;that's what I'm really most afraid of.</p>

<p>"We'll do the best we can. Likely as not we'll pull through; but
if we don't, why, remember what I said, don't let 'em get
you&mdash;save one shot. You understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand, Dad."</p>

<p>Colby, his horse stretched to quirt and spur, swung around to
their side of the hill, threw his horse to its haunches as he
reined in close to them and leaped from the saddle. Without a word
he dragged the blowing, half-winded animal directly in front of
them, raised his six-shooter to its forehead and shot it between
the eyes.</p>

<p>Diana Henders voiced a little gasp of dismay, and then she saw
the man turn toward her own pony; but she only covered her eyes
with her palms and bit her lip to stifle a sob. A moment later
there was a shot and the sound of a falling body.</p>

<p>"Crawl behind that cayuse of mine, Di," said Colby. He was
tugging at the body of the girl's pony to drag it closer to the
others, in order to form a rude triangle with the two other dead
horses. Henders rose to his knees and gave Colby a hand, while Di
opened fire upon the approaching braves.</p>

<p>"Reckon we orter hold out here till the boys come," remarked the
foreman.</p>

<p>He was cool and self-possessed&mdash;just as cool and
self-possessed as Jefferson Wainright would have been in a Boston
drawing-room. Even as she took careful aim at a half-naked, yelling
buck, and missed him, Diana Henders' mind was considering this
fact. She fired again and this time the buck ceased to yell,
grasped his stomach with both hands and toppled headlong to the
ground. Hal Colby might learn to be cool and self-possessed in a
Boston drawing-room, but could Jefferson Wainright ever learn to be
cool and self-possessed inside a yelling circle of painted savages
thirsting for his life's blood?</p>

<p>The Indians were now riding a wide circle entirely about the
hillock, firing as they rode. Naturally their aim was execrable,
and the three were in danger only of a chance hit. After the
warrior fell to Diana's bullet the circle widened to still greater
proportions and a few minutes later the Indians withdrew out of
effective revolver range and gathered in a compact group where the
three on the hillock could see them gesticulating and talking
excitedly.</p>

<p>"They're up to some new devilment," said Henders.</p>

<p>"I hope they don't charge from different directions before the
boys git here," remarked Colby. "If they do we might as well kiss
ourselves goodbye. I wish you wasn't here, Di.</p>

<p>"Damn that white-livered dude's hide. Ef he hadn't turned tail
you could have gone. You could ride rings around that slab-sided
maverick, an' besides you'd have been safe. Look! They're
separatin' now."</p>

<p>"Yes, they're riding to surround us again," said Diana.</p>

<p>"If they charge, Hal," said Henders, "wait until they get close
and then stand up and let them have it. Di, you lie as close to the
ground as you can. Don't move. Just watch us, and when you see
we're both down you'll know it's all up and&mdash;you must do what
I told you to."</p>

<p>Hal Colby looked at the beautiful girl at his side, and scowled,
for he guessed without being told, what her father meant. "Damn
that dude!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"Mebby I hadn't orter shot all the hosses," he said presently.
"Mebby Di could have got away."</p>

<p>"No," Henders assured him. "You did just right, Hal. Di wouldn't
go. I told her to, but she wouldn't. It was too late then
anyway."</p>

<p>"I figgered it was too late," said Colby; "but mebby it wasn't.
I wish I had thet damn dude here."</p>

<p>"They're coming!" cried Diana.</p>

<p>From four sides the Indians were racing toward them, their
savage cries breaking hideously the silence of the sun-parched
valley. The three crouched, waiting. No word was spoken until the
nearest of the red-skins was no more than twenty-five yards
away.</p>

<p>Then: "Now!" said Henders, leaping to his feet. Colby was up
simultaneously, firing as he rose. Diana Henders, far from lying
close to the ground as she had been directed, was on her feet
almost as quickly as the men.</p>

<p>"Get down, Di!" commanded her father, but her only reply was a
shot that brought down a warrior's pony twenty paces from them.</p>

<p>Colby and Henders had each shot an Indian and there was another
pony down in front of Colby. The renegades were close now and
presented splendid targets for the three whites, all of whom were
excellent revolver shots. At each report of their weapons a hit was
scored.</p>

<p>Now a pony screamed and wheeled away, bearing its rider in
headlong flight down the gentle declivity of the hillside; another
stumbled and crumpled to the ground, sprawling its painted master
in the dust; a warrior, wounded, veered to one side and raced off
to safety; or, again, one slumped silently to earth, never to
charge again.</p>

<p>Two of the unhorsed warriors sprang into close quarters,
clubbing their empty rifles. One was leaping toward Diana, the
other for Colby. At the same instant Elias Henders lifted both
hands above his head, his gun slipped from nerveless fingers, and
he lunged forward across the body of his dead horse.</p>

<p>Colby put a shot through the stomach of the buck leaping upon
him, then turned toward Diana. He saw the painted face of a tall
chief just beyond Diana's; he saw the rifle swinging to brain her
as she pulled the trigger of her Colt with the muzzle almost
against the sweat streaked body; there was no answering report, and
then Colby, leaping between them, seized the upraised rifle and
tore it from the hand of the red man.</p>

<p>The two clinched, the Indian reaching for his knife, while the
white, who had emptied both guns and had no time to reload, strove
to brain his antagonist with one of them. Struggling, they
fell.</p>

<p>Diana Henders, reloading her own weapon, looked hurriedly about.
The other warriors, momentarily dispersed, had rallied and were
returning with wild, triumphant yells, for they saw that the battle
was already theirs.</p>

<p>Elias Henders raised himself weakly on one elbow and looked
about. Instantly his gaze took in the situation.</p>

<p>"Di!" he cried, "my little girl. Quick! Don't wait! Shoot
yourself before they get you."</p>

<p>"Not yet!" she cried, and turned toward the two men, the red and
the white, battling at her feet. Stooping, she held the muzzle of
her weapon close to the rolling, tossing men, waiting an
opportunity to put a bullet in the chief when she could do so
without endangering Colby.</p>

<p>From behind her the returning braves were approaching rapidly,
the racing hoofs of their ponies pounding a dull tattoo on the
powdery earth. They were almost upon her when Colby's fingers found
the chief's throat and the latter's head was pushed momentarily
away from that of the white man. It was the instant that Diana had
awaited. She stepped in closer, there was the sound of a shot, and
the renegade collapsed limply in Colby's grasp.</p>

<p>Simultaneously a wild yell arose from below them in the valley.
The remaining Indians, almost upon them, were riding in a close
mass from the opposite side. What could it be&mdash;more
Indians?</p>

<p>Colby had hurled the dead chief aside and was on his feet beside
the girl. They both looked in the direction of the new sound to see
two horsemen racing madly toward them.</p>

<p>"It's Bull! It's Bull!" cried Diana Henders. "Bull and Texas
Pete."</p>

<p>The ponies of the oncoming men were racing neck and neck. The
riders were howling like demons. The Indians heard, paused in their
charge and wheeled to one side&mdash;there were five of them left.
The reinforcements were too much for them, and with a parting
volley they galloped off.</p>

<p>But Bull and Texas Pete were of no mind to let them go so
easily. For a mile or more they pursued them, until they realized
that their already almost spent horses could not outdistance the
mounts of the Indians. Then they turned and loped slowly back
toward the three upon the hillock.</p>

<p>Instantly the immediate necessity of defense had passed Diana
Henders kneeled beside her father and lifted his head in her arms.
Colby stepped to the opposite side of the prostrate man to help
her. Suddenly she looked up into his eyes, an expression of horror
in her's.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hal! Hal! he's gone!" she cried, and burying her face in
her arms, burst into tears.</p>

<p>The man, unaccustomed to a woman's tears, or a sorrow such as
this, was at a loss for words, yet almost mechanically his arms
went about her and drew her close to him, so that she stood with
her face buried in the hollow of his shoulder as Bull and Texas
Pete rode up the hill and dismounted beside them. They took in the
pitiful scene at a glance, but they saw more in it than the death
of "the old man", whom they both loved&mdash;at least Bull did.</p>

<p>In the attitude of Diana and Colby he read the death knell of
whatever faint hope he might have entertained of ultimate
happiness. It was a hurt and bitter man that lifted the dead body
of his employer in strong arms and laid it across the saddle of his
horse.</p>

<p>"You ride Pete's hoss, Miss," he said gently. "Colby, you walk
ahead with her. Pete an' I'll come along with the old man".</p>

<p>They all did as he bid without question. There was something
about the man that demanded obedience even if he was no longer
foreman. It was always that way with Bull. Wherever he was he was
the leader. Even though men mistrusted, or disliked him, and many
did, they involuntarily obeyed him. Possibly because he was a
strong man who thought quickly and accurately and was almost
invariably right in his decision&mdash;it was certainly not because
a large proportion of them loved him, for they did not. There was
that something lacking in Bull&mdash;that quality which attracted
the love of his fellows.</p>

<p>After Diana and Colby had gone ahead Bull and Pete roped the
body of Elias Henders securely to the saddle and presently the
sorrowful little cortege took its slow way back toward camp.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7">VII. &mdash; EXIT WAINRIGHT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A WEEK or ten days after Elias Henders' funeral
the Wainright buckboard drew into the Bar Y ranch yard and the
Wainrights, senior and junior, alighted and approached the house.
They found Diana in the office working on the books, which she had
kept for her father when they were without a bookkeeper, which was
the case at present.</p>

<p>She greeted them politely, but without marked cordiality. It was
the first time that she had encountered either of them since her
father's death, having refused to see the younger man on her return
to the camp with Elias Henders' body.</p>

<p>"We been calc'latin' to drive over for several days past, Miss
Henders," said the elder man. "Thought mebby you might want some
advice or suthin'. Anything we can do, we're both at your
service."</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you, indeed, I'm sure," replied the girl;
"but really I have so many good friends here that I couldn't think
of inconveniencing you. Everyone has been so kind and
considerate."</p>

<p>"Well, they ain't no harm in offerin'," he continued. "Anything
we can do, you know. If it's a little matter of money to tide you
over till the estate's settled, why, just call on Jefferson
Wainright&mdash;he's got a lot and he ain't stingy either."</p>

<p>"There is nothing, thank you," she said, with just the faintest
tinge of asperity.</p>

<p>He rose slowly from his chair and shoved his fat hands into his
pockets.</p>

<p>"I reckon I'll walk around a bit," he said. "I calc'late that
you young folks got suthin' to say to one another," and he winked
ponderously at them as he waddled through the doorway.</p>

<p>There was a strained silence for several minutes after he left.
Jefferson Wainright, Jr., finally, after clearing his throat two or
three times, broke it.</p>

<p>"The governor means all right," he said. "We'd really like to be
of service to you, and after the&mdash;the talk we had that last
night before&mdash;before your father was killed&mdash;you
know&mdash;why, I hoped I might have the right to help you,
Diana."</p>

<p>She drew herself up very straight and stiff. "I think we had
better forget that, Mr. Wainright," she said.</p>

<p>"But you promised me an answer," he insisted.</p>

<p>"After what happened I should think you would know what the
answer must be without being subjected to the humiliation of being
told in words."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you are blaming me, too, like the men did, for
going for help. You would all have been killed if I hadn't. I think
I did just the sensible thing," he concluded, half defiantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so," she replied icily, "and Hal Colby did a
very silly thing staying and risking his life for Dad and me."</p>

<p>"I think you're mighty unfair, Diana," he insisted, "and the way
it turned out only goes to prove that I was right. I met Bull and
that Texas person less than half way to camp and got them there in
time."</p>

<p>"If they had been as sensible as you they would have gone on to
camp for more reinforcements, as you did, but like most of our boys
out here, Mr. Wainright, they haven't much sense and so they nearly
rode their horses down to get to us&mdash;only two of them,
remember, after you had told them that we were surrounded by a
hundred Indians."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw, I think you might be reasonable and make some
allowance for a fellow," he begged. "I'll admit I was a little
excited and maybe I did do the wrong thing, but it's all new to me
out here. I'd never seen a wild Indian before and I thought I was
doing right to go for help.</p>

<p>"Can't you forgive me, Diana, and give me another chance? If
you'll marry me I'll take you away from this God-forsaken country
back where there are no Indians."</p>

<p>"Mr. Wainright, I have no wish to offend you, but you might as
well know once for all that if you were the last man on earth I
would never marry you&mdash;I could not marry a coward, and you are
a coward. You would be just as much of a coward back East if danger
threatened. Some of our boys are from the East&mdash;Hal Colby was
born in Vermont&mdash;and the day that you ran away was his first
experience, too, with hostile Indians, and if you want another
reason why I couldn't marry you&mdash;the first and biggest
reason&mdash;I'll give it to you."</p>

<p>Her voice was low and level, like her father's had been on the
rare occasions that he had been moved by anger, but the tone was
keen edged and cutting. "I feel now, and I shall always feel as
long as I live, that had you remained instead of running away we
might have held them off and Dad would not have been uselessly
sacrificed."</p>

<p>She had risen while she spoke, and he rose too, standing
silently for a moment after she had concluded. Then he turned and
walked toward the door. At the threshold he paused and turned
toward her.</p>

<p>"I hope you will never regret your decision," he said. The tone
seemed to carry a threat.</p>

<p>"I assure you that I shall never. Good day, Mr. Wainright."</p>

<p>After he had gone the girl shuddered and sank down into a chair.
She wished Hal Colby was there. She wanted someone to comfort her
and to give her that sense of safety under masculine protection
that her father's presence had always afforded.</p>

<p>Why couldn't all men be like Hal and Bull? When she thought of
brave men she always thought of Bull, too. How wonderful they had
all been that day&mdash;Hal and Bull and Pete. Rough, uncouth they
often were; worn and soiled and careless their apparel; afraid of
nothing, man, beast or the devil; risking their lives joyously;
joking with death; and yet they had been as gentle as women when
they took her back to camp and all during the long, terrible
journey home, when one of the three had always been within call
every minute of the days and nights.</p>

<p>Of the three Bull had surprised her most, for previously he had
always seemed the hardest and most calloused, and possessing fewer
of the finer sensibilities of sympathy and tenderness; but of them
all he had been the most thoughtful and considerate. It had been he
who had sent her ahead with Colby that she might not see them lash
her father's body to the horse; it had been he who had covered all
that remained of Elias Henders with the slickers from his saddle
and Pete's that she might not be shocked by the sight of her
father's body rocking from side to side with the swaying motion of
the horse; and it was Bull who had ridden all night to far-away
ranches and brought back two buckboards early the next morning to
carry her Dad and her more comfortably on the homeward journey. He
had spoken kindly to her in an altered, softened voice, and he had
insisted that she eat and keep her strength when she had wanted to
forget food.</p>

<p>But the funeral over she had seen nothing more of him, for he
had been sent back to the round-up to ride with it for the last few
remaining days, while Hal Colby remained at the ranch to help her
to plan for the future and gather together the stray ends that are
left flying when even the most methodical of masters releases his
grip for the last time.</p>

<p>She sat musing after Wainright left the room, the clock upon the
wall above her father's desk ticking as it had for years&mdash;just
as though this terrible thing had not happened&mdash;just as though
her father were still sitting in his accustomed chair, instead of
lying out there in the sandy, desolate little graveyard above
Hendersville, where the rocks that protected the scattered sleepers
from the coyotes offered sanctuary to the lizard and the
rattlesnake.</p>

<p>Her revery was disturbed by the fall of heavy feet upon the
veranda and she raised her eyes just as the elder Wainright entered
the room. He was not smiling now, nor was his manner so suave as
usual.</p>

<p>"We got to be goin' now, Miss Henders," he said brusquely; "but
I wanted a mite of a word with you before we left. O' course, you
don't know nothin' about it, but afore your father died we was
negotiatin' a deal. He wanted to get out from under, now that the
mine's runnin' out, an' I wanted to git a range on this side o' the
mountains. We'd jest about got it all fixed up when this accident
happened.</p>

<p>"Now here's what I wanted to say to you. Of course, the mine's
no account, and the range's 'bout all fed off, and they ain't
scarce enough water fer the number o' stock I was calc'latin' to
put on, but Jefferson Wainright's a man o' his word an' when I says
to your father that I'd give him two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars fer his holdin's I won't back down now, even if I don't
think they be worth so much as that.</p>

<p>"I'll get all the papers ready so's ye won't have to go to no
expense fer a lawyer, and then ye can have the money an' go back
East to live like ye always wanted to, an' like yer paw was fixin'
fer ye."</p>

<p>The deeper he got into the subject the faster he talked and the
more he relapsed into the vernacular of his earlier days. Finally
he paused. "What do ye say?" he concluded.</p>

<p>"The ranch is not for sale, Mr. Wainright," she replied.</p>

<p>He opened his little eyes and his big mouth simultaneously in
surprise.</p>

<p>"What's thet&mdash;not for sale? Why, you must be crazy, child.
You don't know what you're talkin' about."</p>

<p>"I know exactly what I am talking about," she told him. "Father
talked this all over with me and showed me your offer of a million
dollars for our holdings. The ranch is not for sale, for a million
dollars or any other price, to you, Mr. Wainright, and be careful
that you do not stumble over that stool as you go out."</p>

<p>The man's fat face became suddenly empurpled with rage and for a
moment he was inarticulate as, backing toward the doorway, he
sought for words adequately to express his outraged feelings. He
was not humiliated&mdash;there are certain types of men whose thick
skin serves them as an invulnerable armor against humiliation.</p>

<p>He was just plain mad&mdash;mad all the way through to think
that he had been caught at his trickery, exposed and thwarted by a
chit of a girl, and, like the type he represented naturally would
be, he was mad at her rather than at himself. As he reached the
doorway he found his voice.</p>

<p>"You'll be sorry for this! You'll be sorry for this!" he cried,
shaking a fist at her. "And, mark you, I'll get this property yet.
Jefferson Wainright can buy and sell you twenty times over and he
always gets what he goes after."</p>

<p>The figure of a tall man loomed suddenly behind him. Calloused
and ungentle fingers seized him roughly by the collar of his coat.
A low voice spoke softly in his ear.</p>

<p>"Don't you know better'n to shake your fist in a lady's face,
you pot-bellied buzzard?" it inquired, and the elder Wainright was
jerked unceremoniously through the doorway, whirled about and
projected violently from the veranda, his speed simultaneously
accelerated by the toe of a high-heeled cowboy boot. "I reckon
you'd better make yourself damned scarce around here," continued
the low tones of the speaker.</p>

<p>Wainright scrambled to his feet and turned upon the owner of the
voice. He shook both fists now and fairly danced up and down in his
fury. "I'll get you!" he screamed. "I'll get you! Don't you know
who I am&mdash;why, I could buy and sell you a hundred thousand
times over&mdash;I'm Jefferson Wainright, I am. I'll get
you&mdash;layin' your hands on me&mdash;you low down, thirty-five
dollar cow-puncher!"</p>

<p>"Vamoose!" said the man, "and do it pronto." He emphasized his
injunction with a shot, the bullet kicking up a little spurt of
dust between Wainright's feet.</p>

<p>The fat man started on a run for his buckboard which the younger
Wainright had driven down to the corrals. The man on the veranda
fired again, and again the dust rose about the fleeing feet of the
terrified Easterner.</p>

<p>Diana Henders had come to the doorway where she stood leaning
against the frame, smiling.</p>

<p>"Don't hurt him, Bull," she said.</p>

<p>The man cast a quick smile over his shoulder. "I ain't a-aimin'
to hurt him," he said. "I'm just a-aimin' to eddicate him. Them
corn-fed Easterners ain't got no eddication nohow. What they need
is someone to larn 'em manners."</p>

<p>As he spoke he kept on firing at the fleeing Wainright and every
shot kicked up a puff of dust close to the fat man's feet until he
reached the corner of the bunk-house and disappeared behind it.</p>

<p>The shots had called out the cook and the few men who were
about, with the result that a small yet highly appreciative
audience witnessed Wainright's discomfiture. A part of it was Texas
Pete, who rocked to and fro in unholy glee.</p>

<p>"By gollies! did you see him?" he yelled. "He never hit nothin'
but the high spots. I'll bet he busted all the world's records
between the office and the bunk-house. Why, he done it in nothin'
flat, an' you could have played checkers on his coat-tails. He
shore stepped high, wide an' handsome."</p>

<p>On the veranda of the ranch house Bull had shoved his gun back
into its holster. The smile had left his face.</p>

<p>"I thought you were still out with the outfit, Bull," said the
girl.</p>

<p>"We finished up last night," he told her, "and I come in ahead."
He looked down at his feet in evident embarrassment. "I come in
ahead for my time, Miss."</p>

<p>"Your time! Why, Bull, you're not goin' to quit?"</p>

<p>"I reckon I better," he replied. "I been aimin' to move on fer
some spell."</p>

<p>The girl's eyes were wide, and almost noticeably moist, and
there was a surprised, hurt look in them, that he caught as he
chanced to glance up at her.</p>

<p>"You see, Miss," he hastened to explain, "things ain't very
pleasant for me here. I ain't complainin', but there are those that
don't like me, an' I figgered I'd quit before I was let out. As
long as your paw was alive it was different, an' I don't need to
tell you that I'd be powerful proud to work for you always, if
there wasn't no one else; but there is. I reckon you got a good man
an' it will be pleasanter all around if I ain't here no more."</p>

<p>At the mere thought of his going a lump rose in Diana Henders'
throat, and she realized how much she had come to depend on
him&mdash;just the mere fact that she had known Bull was around had
given her a feeling of greater security&mdash;he had become in the
nature of a habit and it was going to be hard to break the
habit.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bull," she cried, "I can't let you go now&mdash;I can't
spare both you and Dad at the same time. You're like a brother,
Bull, and I need a brother mighty badly right now. You don't
<i>have</i> to go, do you? You don't really <i>want</i> to?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss, I don't have to an' I don't want to&mdash;if you want
me to stay."</p>

<p>"Then you <i>will</i> stay?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "But I reckon' you'd better tell Colby," he said,
"for I expect he's aimin' to give me my time."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I'm sure he's not," she cried. "Hal likes you, Bull. He
told me you were one of his best friends, and he was so sorry about
your losing the job as foreman. He said he hated to take it."</p>

<p>Bull made no comment and whatever his thoughts his face did not
betray them. Presently he jerked his head in the general direction
of the corrals where the Wainrights, having hastily clambered into
their buckboard, were preparing to depart.</p>

<p>"Say the word," he told her, "and I'll run them short sports so
far outta the country they won't never find their way back."</p>

<p>"No," she replied, smiling; "let them go. They'll never come
back here, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"I reckon the old gent figgers he ain't very popular round these
diggins," said Bull, with the faintest trace of a smile; "but I
don't know so much about how thet young dude stands." He looked
questioningly at Diana.</p>

<p>"About deuce high, Bull," she replied. "I saw enough of him to
last me a couple of life times the day the renegades jumped
us."</p>

<p>"I reckoned as much, Miss, knowin' you as I do. Scenery an' the
gift o' gab ain't everything, but sometimes they fool wimmen
folks&mdash;even the brightest of 'em."</p>

<p>"He was awfully good company," she admitted.</p>

<p>"When they warn't no Injuns around," Bull completed the sentence
for her. "The old feller seemed all het up over somethin' about the
time I happened along. I heered him say he was set on gettin' this
property. Is that what they come over fer?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He offered me a quarter of what he'd offered Dad for it,
and his offer to Dad was only about twenty per cent of what it's
worth. You see, Bull, what they want is the mine. They are just
using the range and the cattle as an excuse to get hold of the mine
because they think we don't know the real value of the diggings;
but Dad did know. There's another vein there that has never been
tapped that is richer than the old one. Dad knew about it, and
somehow Wainright learned of it too."</p>

<p>"The old skunk!" muttered Bull.</p>

<p>The Wainrights were driving out of the ranch yard and heading
toward Hendersville. The older man was still breathing hard and
swearing to himself. The younger was silent and glum. They were
going to town for dinner before starting on the long drive back to
their ranch. Approaching them along the trail at a little distance
ahead was a horseman. Young Wainright recognized the rider
first.</p>

<p>"That's Colby," he said. "He hasn't any use for that fellow
Bull. They are both stuck on the girl. It might not be a bad plan
to cultivate him&mdash;if you want to get even with Bull."</p>

<p>As they came nearer it appeared evident that Colby was going by
them with nothing more than a nod. He did not like either of
them&mdash;especially the younger; but when they drew rein and the
older man called to him he turned about and rode up to the side of
the vehicle.</p>

<p>"You're still foreman here, ain't ye?" asked Wainright
senior.</p>

<p>Colby nodded. "Why?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Well, I jest wanted to tell ye that some of your men ain't got
a very pleasant way of treatin' neighbors."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was jest a-leavin' after a social call when one of yer
men starts shootin' at me. Thet ain't no way to treat friends an'
neighbors. Suppose we was to shoot up your men when they came over
our way?"</p>

<p>"Who was it?" demanded Colby.</p>

<p>"Bull," said the younger Wainright. "I suppose he was drunk
again, though. They say he always goes to shooting whenever he gets
drunk. When we left he was up at the house making love to Miss
Henders," he added. "I shouldn't think she'd feel safe with a
fellow like that around."</p>

<p>Colby scowled. "Thanks fer tellin' me," he said. "I reckon I'll
have to fix that feller. He's gettin' too damn fresh."</p>

<p>"Well, I thought ye'd orter know," said Wainright senior. "Well,
so long, an' if ye ever git over our way drop in."</p>

<p>"Giddap!" said Jefferson Wainright, Jr., and the two rolled away
through the deep dust of the parched road.</p>

<p>Colby rode on at a brisk gallop and as he swung from his saddle
cast a glance in the direction of the house where he saw Bull just
descending the steps from the veranda where Diana Henders stood.
Colby bit his lip and the frown on his face became deeper.</p>

<p>Dragging saddle and bridle from his pony he turned the animal
into the corral with a final slap on the rump&mdash;a none too
gentle slap which reflected the state of his feelings&mdash;then he
headed straight for the bunk-house which he reached just in time to
intercept Bull at the entrance.</p>

<p>"Look here, Bull," said Colby without any preamble, "this
business of drinkin' an' shootin' things up has gone about far
enough. I ain't a-goin' to have it around here no more. I reckon
you'd better ask fer your time."</p>

<p>"All right," said Bull, "you go an' git it fer me while I'm
packin' my war-bag."</p>

<p>Colby, rather surprised and at the same time relieved that Bull
took the matter so philosophically, started for the office, while
the latter entered the bunk-house, where Shorty, Texas Pete and a
couple of others who had overheard the conversation outside the
door looked up questioningly.</p>

<p>"By gollies!" exclaimed Texas Pete, "I'm a-goin' to quit. I'm
a-goin' after my time right now, pronto," and he arose and started
for the doorway.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, old hoss," advised Bull. "I ain't went yet."</p>

<p>"But didn't Colby jest let you out?" inquired Pete.</p>

<p>"He might change his mind," explained Bull.</p>

<p>Up at the house Colby was entering the office. "Hello, Di!" he
cried. "Got your check-book handy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, why?"</p>

<p>"Bull's quittin'."</p>

<p>"Quitting? Why, he just promised me that he'd stay on. I don't
understand."</p>

<p>"He just promised you that he'd stay on! You mean you asked him
to?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Diana. "He came up here to quit. Said he thought
he wasn't wanted any more, and I made him promise he wouldn't
leave. I tell you, Hal, we could never replace him. Are you sure he
was in earnest about quitting? Send him up here and I'll make him
stay."</p>

<p>"Well, like as not I was mistaken," said Colby. "I reckon Bull
was jest a-kiddin'. I'll ask him again and if he is plumb set on
leavin' I'll send him up."</p>

<p>When he entered the bunk-house a few minutes later he nodded at
Bull. "You kin stay on, if you want to," he said; "I've changed my
mind."</p>

<p>Bull winked at Texas Pete who was vainly endeavoring to remember
another verse of the seemingly endless self-glorification of the
bad hombre.</p>

<p>"By gollies!" he exclaimed, "I believe I got another:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"He twirls two big guns an' he shoots out a
light;<br>
The fellows a-drinkin' there ducks out o' sight;<br>
He shoots through a bottle thet stands on the bar;<br>
An' shoots the ol' ashes plumb off my seegar."</p>
<br>

<p>"But it seems like I'd left out somethin' thet orter a-gone
before."</p>

<p>"Nobody'd git sore if you left it all out," Shorty assured
him.</p>

<p>"The trouble with you uneddicated cow-punchers," Texas Pete told
him, "is thet you are too all-fired ignorant to appreciate my
efforts to elivate you-all by means of good poetry. It shore is
hell to be the only lit'ry gent in a bunch of rough-necks.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"'Come, set up the bottles, you gol darned
galoot,'<br>
Says he to the boss, ''Fore I opens yore snoot<br>

An' shoots out the <i>no</i> in the <i>no credit</i> sign."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; "YOU DON'T DARE!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE stage lurched down the steep and tortuous
gradient of Hell's Bend Pass, bumped through the rutty gap at the
bottom and swung onto the left fork just beyond. The right fork was
the regular stage route to Hendersville. The left hand road led to
town, too, but over Bar Y property and past the home ranch.</p>

<p>The driver never came this way unless he had passengers, express
or important messages for the ranch, though the distance was no
greater and the road usually in better repair. Today he had a
telegram for Diana Henders.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause as he drew up his sweating team in the
road before the ranch house, yelled to attract the attention of a
ranch-hand working about the corrals, tossed the envelope into the
road and then, with a crack of his long whip, was off again at a
run, leaving billowing clouds of powdery dust in his wake.</p>

<p>The man working in the corrals walked leisurely into the road,
picked up the envelope and, after scrutinizing the superscription
and deciphering it laboriously, carried the message to the office,
where Diana Henders was working over the books.</p>

<p>"Telegram fer ye, Miss," announced the man, crossing the room to
hand it to her.</p>

<p>She thanked him and laid the envelope on the desk beside her as
she completed an interrupted footing. The arrival of telegrams was
no uncommon occurrence even on that far-away ranch, and as they
always pertained to business they caused Diana no flurry of
excitement. Buyers often wired, while Uncle John Manill used the
comparatively new telegraph facilities upon the slightest
pretext.</p>

<p>The footing finally checked to her satisfaction, Diana picked up
the envelope, opened it and drew forth the message. At first she
glanced at it casually, then she read it over again with knit brows
as though unable fully to grasp the purport of its contents.
Finally she sat staring at it with wide, strained eyes, until,
apparently crushed, she lowered her head upon her arms and broke
into sobs, for this is what she had read:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">MISS DIANA HENDERS,<br>
BAR Y RANCH, HENDERSVILLE,<br>
VIA ALDEA, ARIZONA.</p>

<p class="telegram">MR. MANILL DIED SUDDENLY LAST NIGHT. MISS
MANILL AND I LEAVE FOR RANCH SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER FUNERAL.</p>

<p class="telegram">MAURICE B. CORSON.</p>

<p><br>
For a long time Diana Henders sat with her face buried in her arms.
Gradually her sobs subsided as she gained control of herself.
Stunning though the effect of this new blow was, yet she grasped
enough of what it meant to her to be almost crushed by it. Though
she had not seen her Uncle John Manill since childhood, he had,
nevertheless, constituted a very real and potent force in her
existence. Her mother had adored him, her only brother, and Elias
Henders had never ceased to proclaim him as the finest type of
honorable gentleman that nature might produce. His Eastern
connections, his reputation for integrity and his fine business
acumen had all been potent factors in the success of the Henders
and Manill partnership.</p>

<p>With the death of her father the girl had felt keenly only her
personal loss&mdash;for Uncle John Manill loomed as a Rock of
Gibraltar to protect her in all matters of business; but now she
was absolutely alone.</p>

<p>There was no one to whom she might turn for counsel or advice
now that these two were gone. Hal Colby, she realized keenly, was
at best only a good cowman&mdash;in matters requiring executive
ability or large financial experience he was untried.</p>

<p>Of Corson, Manill's attorney, she knew nothing, but she was
reasonably sure that even though he proved honest and possessed of
an excellent understanding of matters pertaining to the Eastern
office, he would not be competent to direct the affairs of ranch
and mine at the sources of production.</p>

<p>That she might have carried on herself under the guidance of
John Manill she had never doubted, since she could always have
turned to him for advice in matters of moment where she was
doubtful of her own judgment; but without him she questioned her
ability to direct the destinies of this great business with all its
numerous ramifications.</p>

<p>Suddenly she arose and replaced the books in the office safe,
dabbed at her tear-dimmed eyes with her handkerchief and, putting
on her sombrero, walked from the office, adjusting her wavy hair
beneath the stiff band of her heavy hat. Straight toward the
corrals she made her way. She would saddle Captain and ride out
into the sunshine and the fresh air where, of all other places, she
knew she might find surcease of sorrow and an opportunity to think
out her problems more clearly. As she entered the corral Hal Colby
came running up from the bunk-house. He had seen her pass and
followed her.</p>

<p>"Ridin', Di?" he asked.</p>

<p>She nodded affirmatively. She was not sure that she wanted
company&mdash;not even that of Hal Colby&mdash;today when she
desired to be alone with her grief.</p>

<p>"You weren't goin' alone, were you? You know it ain't safe, Di.
Your dad wouldn't have let you an' I certainly won't."</p>

<p>She made no reply. She knew that he was right. It was not safe
for her to ride alone, but today she felt that she did not care
what happened to her. Fate had been cruel&mdash;there was little
more that it could do to harm her.</p>

<p>In a way she half resented Hal's new air of proprietorship, and
yet there was something about it that carried a suggestion of
relief from responsibility. Here there was at least someone who
cared&mdash;someone upon whose broad shoulders she might shift a
portion of her burden, and so she did not follow her first impulse
to send him back.</p>

<p>Together they rode from the corral, turning down the road toward
town and neither spoke for several minutes, after the manner of
people accustomed to being much together in the saddle. The man, as
was usual with him when they rode, watched her profile as a lover
of art might gloat over a beautiful portrait, and as he looked at
her he realized the change that had come over her face and noted
the reddened lids.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Di?" he asked presently. "You look like
you'd been cryin'. What's happened?"</p>

<p>"I just got a telegram from New York, Hal," she replied. "Uncle
John is dead&mdash;he died night before last. The stage just
brought the message in from Aldea."</p>

<p>"Shucks," he said, at a loss for the proper words, and then,
"that's shore too bad, Di."</p>

<p>"It leaves me all alone, now, Hal," she continued, "and I don't
know what I'm going to do."</p>

<p>"You ain't all alone, Di. There ain't anything I wouldn't do for
you. You know I love you, Di. Won't you marry me? It would make it
easier all around for you if we was married. There's them that's
always tryin' to take advantage of a girl or a woman what's left
alone, but if you got a husband you got someone to look out for you
an' your rights. I got a little money saved up."</p>

<p>"I have plenty of money, Hal."</p>

<p>"I know it. I wish you didn't have none. It makes me feel like
you thought that was what I was after, but it ain't. Won't you, Di?
Together we could run the ranch just like your dad was here."</p>

<p>"I don't know, Hal. I don't know what to do. I think I love you,
but I don't know. I don't even know that I know what love is."</p>

<p>"You'd learn to love me," he told her, "and you wouldn't have to
worry no more. I'd look after everything. Say yes, won't you?"</p>

<p>The temptation was great&mdash;greater even than the man himself
realized&mdash;to have a place to lay her tired head, to have a
strong man to carry the burden and the responsibilities for her, to
have the arm of love about her as it had been all her life until
her father had been taken away. She looked up at him with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>"I won't say yes&mdash;yet," she said. "Wait a while,
Hal&mdash;wait until after Mr. Corson and my cousin come and we see
how things are going to turn out, and then&mdash;then I think that
I shall say yes."</p>

<p>He leaned toward her impulsively and put an arm about her,
drawing her toward him with the evident intention of kissing her,
but she pushed him away.</p>

<p>"Not yet, Hal," she told him; "wait until I have said yes."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>A week later a group of boarders were lounging on the veranda of
The Donovan House in Hendersville. It was almost supper time of a
stage day and the stage had not yet arrived. Mack Harber, whose
wound had given more trouble than the doctor had expected, was
still there convalescing, and Mary Donovan was, as usual, standing
in the doorway joining in the gossip and the banter.</p>

<p>"Bill ain't niver late 'less somethin's wrong," said Mrs.
Donovan.</p>

<p>"Like as not he's been held up again," suggested Mack.</p>

<p>"I'd like to be sheriff o' this yere county fer 'bout a week,"
stated Wildcat Bob.</p>

<p>"Sure, an' phawt would ye be after doin'?" inquired Mary
Donovan, acidly.</p>

<p>Wildcat Bob subsided, mumbling in his stained beard. For the
moment he had forgotten that Mrs. Donovan was among those
present.</p>

<p>"Here they come!" announced Mack.</p>

<p>With the clank of chain, the creaking of springs, and the rapid
pounding of galloping hoofs the stage swung into the single street
of Hendersville in a cloud of dust and with a final shrieking of
protesting brakes pulled up before The Donovan House.</p>

<p>"Where's Gum Smith?" demanded Bill Gatlin from the driver's
seat.</p>

<p>"Dunno. Held up agin?" asked one of the loungers.</p>

<p>"Yes," snapped Gatlin.</p>

<p>Mack Harber had risen from his chair and advanced to the edge of
the veranda.</p>

<p>"The Black Coyote?" he asked.</p>

<p>Gatlin nodded. "Where's thet damn sheriff?" he demanded
again.</p>

<p>"He ain't here an' he wouldn't be no good if he was," replied
Wildcat Bob.</p>

<p>"We don't need no sheriff fer what we oughter do," announced
Mack Harber, angrily.</p>

<p>"How's thet?" asked Wildcat.</p>

<p>"You don't need no sheriff fer a necktie party," said Mack,
grimly.</p>

<p>"No, but you gotta get yer man fust."</p>

<p>"Thet's plumb easy."</p>

<p>"How come?" inquired Wildcat.</p>

<p>"We all know who The Black Coyote is," stated Mack. "All we
gotta do is get a rope an' go get him."</p>

<p>"Meanin' get who?" insisted the little old man.</p>

<p>"Why, gosh all hemlock! you know as well as I do thet it's
Bull," replied Mack.</p>

<p>"I dunno nothin' o' the kind, young feller," said Wildcat Bob,
"ner neither do you. Ef ye got proof of what ye say I'm with ye. Ef
ye ain't got proof I'm ag'in ye."</p>

<p>"Don't Bull always wear a black silk handkerchief?" demanded
Mack. "Well, so does The Black Coyote, an' they both got scars on
their chins. There ain't no doubt of it."</p>

<p>"So ye want to string up Bull 'cause he wears a black bandanna
and a scar, eh? Well, ye ain't goin' to do nothin' o' the kind
while ol' Wildcat Bob can fan a gun. Git proof on him an' I'll be
the fust to put a rope 'round his neck, but ye got to git more
proof than a black handkerchief."</p>

<p>"Shure an' fer onct yer right, ye ould blatherskite," commended
Mary Donovan. "Be after comin' to yer suppers now the all of yese
an' fergit stringin' up dacent young min like Bull. Shure an' I
don't belave he iver hild up nothin' at all, at all. He's that nice
to me whinever he's here, wid his Mrs. Donovan, mum, this an' his
Mrs. Donovan, mum, that, an' a-fetchin' wood fer me, which the
loikes o' none o' yese iver did. The viry idea ov him bein' The
Black Coyote&mdash;go on wid ye!"</p>

<p>"Well, we all know that Gregorio's one of them, anyway&mdash;we
might string him up," insisted Mack.</p>

<p>"We don't know that neither," contradicted Wildcat; "but when it
comes to stringin' up Gregorio or any other greaser I'm with ye. Go
out an' git him, Mack, an' I'll help ye string him up."</p>

<p>A general grin ran around the table, for of all the known bad
men in the country the Mexican, Gregorio, was by far the worst. To
have gone out looking for him and to have found him would have been
equivalent to suicide for most men, and though there were many men
in the county who would not have hesitated had necessity demanded,
the fact remained that his hiding place was unknown and that that
fact alone would have rendered an attempt to get him a failure.</p>

<p>"Thar's only one way to git them, sonny," continued Wildcat Bob,
"an' thet is to put a <i>man</i> on the stage with the bullion,
'stid o' a kid."</p>

<p>Mack flushed. "You was there when they got me," he fired back.
"You was there with two big six-guns an' what did you do&mdash;eh?
What did you do?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't hired to guard no bullion, an' I wasn't sittin' on the
box with no sawed-off shotgun 'crost my knees, neither. I was
a-ridin' inside with a lady. What <i>could</i> I a-done?" He looked
around at the others at the table for vindication.</p>

<p>"Ye couldn't done nothin', ye," said Mary Donovan, "widout a
quart o' barbed-wire inside ye an' some poor innocent tenderfoot to
shoot the heels offen him."</p>

<p>Wildcat Bob fidgeted uneasily and applied himself to his supper,
pouring his tea into his saucer, blowing noisily upon it to cool
it, and then sucking it through his whiskers with an accompanying
sound not unlike snoring; but later he was both mollified and
surprised by a second, generous helping of dessert.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>When word of the latest holdup reached the Bar Y ranch it caused
the usual flurry of profanity and speculation. It was brought by a
belated puncher who had ridden in from the West ranch by way of
Hendersville. The men were gathered at the evening meal and of a
sudden a silence fell upon them as they realized, apparently
simultaneously and for the first time, that there was a single
absentee. The meal progressed in almost utter silence then until
they had reached the pudding, when Bull walked in, dark and
taciturn, and with the brief nod that was his usual greeting to his
fellows. The meal continued in silence for a few minutes until the
men who had finished began pushing back their plates preparatory to
rising.</p>

<p>"I reckon you know the stage was held up again, Bull, an' the
bullion stolen," remarked Hal Colby, selecting a tooth-pick from
the glassful on the table.</p>

<p>"How should I know it?" asked Bull. "Ain't I ben up Sink Hole
Canyon all day? I ain't seen no one since I left the ranch this
morning."</p>

<p>"Well, it was," said Colby. "The same two slick gents done it,
too."</p>

<p>"Did they git much?" asked Bull.</p>

<p>"It was a big shipment," said Colby. "It always is. They don't
never touch nothin' else an' they seem to know when we're shippin'
more'n ordinary. Looks suspicious."</p>

<p>"Did you just discover that?" inquired Bull.</p>

<p>"No, I discovered it a long time ago, an' it may help me to find
out whose doin' it."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you luck," and Bull resumed his meal.</p>

<p>Colby, having finished, rose from the table and made his way to
the house. In the cozy sitting-room he found Diana at the piano,
her fingers moving dreamily over the ivory keys.</p>

<p>"Some more bad news, Di," he announced.</p>

<p>She turned wearily toward him. "What now?"</p>

<p>"The Black Coyote again&mdash;he got the bullion shipment."</p>

<p>"Was anyone hurt?"</p>

<p>"No," he assured her.</p>

<p>"I am glad of that. The gold is nothing&mdash;I would rather
lose it all than have one of the boys killed. I have told them all,
just as Dad did, to take no chances. If they could get him without
danger to themselves I should be glad, but I could not bear to have
one of our boys hurt for all the gold in the mine."</p>

<p>"I think The Black Coyote knows that," he said, "and that's what
makes him so all-fired nervy. He's one of our own men,
Di&mdash;can't you see it? He knows when the shipments are big an'
don't never touch a little one, an' he knows your Dad's orders
about not takin' no chances.</p>

<p>"I've hated to think it, but there ain't no other two ways about
it&mdash;it's one o' our men&mdash;an' I wouldn't have to walk
around the world to put my finger on him, neither."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!" she cried. "I don't believe that one of my
men would do it."</p>

<p>"You don't want to believe it, that's all. You know just as well
as I do whose doin' it, down in the bottom of your heart. I don't
like to believe it no more'n you do, Di; but I ain't blind an' I
hate to see you bein' made a fool of an' robbed into the bargain. I
don't believe you'd believe it, though, if I caught him in the
act."</p>

<p>"I think I know whom you suspect, Hal," she replied, "but I am
sure you are wrong."</p>

<p>"Will you give me a chance to prove it?"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Send him up to the mine to guard the bullion until Mack gits
well an' then keep Mack off the job fer a month," he explained.
"I'll bet my shirt thet either there ain't no holdups fer a month
or else they's only one man pulls 'em off instead o' two. Will you
do it?"</p>

<p>"It isn't fair. I don't even suspect him."</p>

<p>"Everybody else does an' thet makes it fair fer it gives him a
chance to prove it if he ain't guilty."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't <i>prove</i> anything, except that there were no
holdups while he was on duty."</p>

<p>"It would prove something to my mind if they started up again
pretty soon after he was taken off the job," he retorted.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it might, but I don't think I'd ever believe it of
him unless I saw him with my own eyes."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! the trouble with you is you're soft on him&mdash;you
don't care if your gold is stole if he gits it."</p>

<p>She drew herself to her full height. "I do not care to discuss
the matter further," she said. "Good night!"</p>

<p>He grabbed his hat viciously from the piano and stamped toward
the doorway. There he turned about and confronted her again for a
parting shot before he strode out into the night.</p>

<p>"You don't dare try it!" he flung at her. "You don't dare!"</p>

<p>After he had gone she sat biting her lip half in anger and half
in mortification, but after the brief tempest of emotion had
subsided she commenced to question her own motives impartially. Was
she afraid? Was it true that she did not dare? And long after she
had gone to bed, and sleep would not come, she continued thus to
catechize herself.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>As Hal Colby burst into the bunk-house and slammed the door
behind him the sudden draft thus created nearly extinguished the
single lamp that burned upon an improvised table at which four men
sat at poker. Bull and Shorty, Texas Pete and one called Idaho sat
in the game.</p>

<p>"I raise you ten dollars," remarked Idaho, softly, as the lamp
resumed functioning after emitting a thin, protesting spiral of
black soot.</p>

<p>"I see that an' raise you my pile," said Bull, shoving several
small stacks of silver toward the center of the table.</p>

<p>"How much you got there?" inquired Idaho, the others having
dropped out.</p>

<p>Bull counted. "There's your ten," he said, "an' here's ten,
fifteen, twenty-five&mdash;" He continued counting in a monotone.
"Ninety-six," he announced. "I raise you ninety-six dollars,
Idaho."</p>

<p>"I ain't got ninety-six dollars," said Idaho. "I only got
eight."</p>

<p>"You got a saddle, ain't you?" inquired Bull, sweetly.</p>

<p>"An' a shirt," suggested Texas Pete.</p>

<p>"My saddle's worth three hundred an' fifty dollars if it's worth
a cent," proclaimed Idaho.</p>

<p>"No one ain't never said it was worth a cent," Shorty reminded
him.</p>

<p>"I'll cover it an' call you," announced Bull. "I don't want your
shirt, Idaho, it's full o' holes."</p>

<p>"What you coverin' it with?" asked Idaho. "I don't see
nothin'."</p>

<p>Bull rose from the table. "Wait a second," he said, and stepped
to his blankets where he rummaged for a moment in his war-bag. When
he returned to the table he tossed a small buckskin bag among his
silver.</p>

<p>"They's five hundred dollars' worth of dust in that," he said.
"If you win we kin weigh out what's comin' to you over at the
office tomorrow mornin'."</p>

<p>Hal Colby looked on&mdash;an interested spectator. The others
fell silent. Texas Pete knit his brows in perplexity.</p>

<p>"Let's see it," demanded Idaho.</p>

<p>Bull picked up the bag, opened it and poured a stream of yellow
particles into his palm. "Satisfied?" he inquired.</p>

<p>Idaho nodded.</p>

<p>"What you got?" demanded Bull.</p>

<p>Idaho laid four kings on the table, smiling broadly.</p>

<p>"Four aces," said Bull, and raked in the pot.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you raise him?" demanded Shorty.</p>

<p>"I just told you I didn't want his shirt," said Bull, "an' I
don't want your saddle, neither, kid. I'll keep the money&mdash;it
ain't good fer kids like you to have too much money&mdash;but you
keep the saddle."</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to turn in," said Shorty, pushing back and
rising.</p>

<p>"You'd all better turn in an' give someone else a chance to
sleep," said the foreman. "What with your damn game an' Pete's
singin' a feller ain't got no more chance to sleep around here than
a jack-rabbit. Why don't you fellers crawl in?"</p>

<p>"Crawl in! Crawl in!" exclaimed Texas Pete. "Crawl in! Crawl
out! By gollies, I got another verse!</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"The boss he crawls out then, all shaky an'
white,<br>
From under the bar where he's ben sittin' tight.<br>
'Now set out the pizen right pronto, you coot,'<br>
The stranger remarks, 'Or I shore starts to shoot,<br>

'A bar-keep er two don't mean nothin' to me.<br>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9">IX. &mdash; LILLIAN MANILL</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"YOU sent fer me, Miss?" asked Bull, as he stepped
into the office the following morning, his hat in his hand, his
chaps loose-buckled about his trim hips, his two big six-guns a
trifle forward against the need for quick action, the black silk
handkerchief falling over the blue shirt that stretched to his deep
chest, and his thick, black hair pushed back in an unconscious,
half pompadour.</p>

<p>From silver-mounted spurs to heavy hat band he was typical of
the West of his day. There was no item of his clothing or equipment
the possession of which was not prompted by utilitarian
considerations. There was ornamentation, but it was obviously
secondary to the strict needs of his calling. Nothing that he wore
was shabby, yet it all showed use to an extent that made each
article seem a part of the man, as though he had been molded into
them. Nothing protruded with stiff awkwardness&mdash;even the heavy
guns appeared to fit into accustomed hollows and become a part of
the man.</p>

<p>The girl, swinging about in her chair to face him, felt a
suggestion of stricture in her throat, and she felt mean and small
and contemptible as she looked into the eyes of the man she knew
loved her and contemplated the thing she was about to do; yet she
did not hesitate now that she had, after a night of sleepless
deliberation, committed herself to it.</p>

<p>"Yes, I sent for you, Bull," she replied. "The stage was held up
again yesterday as you know. Mack won't be fit for work again for a
long time and I've got to have someone to guard the bullion
shipments&mdash;the fellow who came down with it yesterday has
quit. He said he was too young to commit suicide."</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Bull.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to take any chances, Bull&mdash;I would rather
lose the gold than have&mdash;you hurt."</p>

<p>"I won't get hurt, Miss."</p>

<p>"You don't mind doing it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"O' course I'm a puncher," he said; "but I don't mind doin'
it&mdash;not fer you. I told you once thet I'd do anything fer you,
Miss, an' I wasn't jest talkin' through my hat."</p>

<p>"You don't do everything I ask you to, Bull," she said,
smiling.</p>

<p>"What don't I do?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"You still call me Miss, and I hate it. You're more like a
brother, Bull, and Miss sounds so formal." It must have been a
woman who first discovered the art of making fire.</p>

<p>A shadow of pain crossed his dark countenance. "Don't ask too
much of me, Miss," he said quietly as he turned on his heel and
started for the doorway. "I go up to the mine today, I suppose?" he
threw back over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes, today," she said, and he was gone.</p>

<p>For a long time Diana Henders was troubled. The assignment she
had given Bull troubled her, for it was a tacit admission that she
gave credence to Colby's suspicions. The pain that she had seen
reflected in Bull's face troubled her, as did his parting words and
the quiet refusal to call her Diana. She wondered if these had been
prompted by a feeling of pique that his love was not returned, or
compunction because of a guilty knowledge that he had betrayed her
and her father.</p>

<p>Hal Colby had told her that morning of the bag of gold dust Bull
had displayed in the poker game the night before, and that troubled
her too, for it seemed to bear out more than anything else the
suspicions that were forming around him&mdash;suspicions that she
could see, in the light of bits of circumstantial evidence, were
far from groundless.</p>

<p>"I won't believe it!" she said half aloud. "I won't believe it!"
and then she went for a ride.</p>

<p>All the men had left but Hal Colby and Texas Pete when she
reached the corrals; but she did not feel like riding with Hal
Colby that morning and so she rode with Texas Pete, much to that
young man's surprise and rapture.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The days dragged along and became weeks, the stage made its two
trips a week, the bullion shipments came through regularly and
safely and there were no holdups, and then one day Maurice B.
Corson and Lillian Manill arrived. The stage took the Bar Y road
that day and pulled up before the gate of the ranch house just as
Diana Henders and Hal Colby were returning from a trip to the West
Ranch. Diana saw Lillian Manill for the first time in her life. The
eastern girl was seated between Bill Gatlin, the driver, and Bull.
All three were laughing. Evidently they had been enjoying one
another's company.</p>

<p>Diana could not but notice it because it was rarely that Bull
laughed. It was Bull who stepped to the wheel and helped her to
alight.</p>

<p>Maurice B. Corson emerged from the inside of the coach, through
the windows of which Diana could see three other passengers, two of
whom she recognized as the Wainrights, and then she dismounted and
ran forward to greet her cousin, a handsome, dark haired girl of
about her own age.</p>

<p>Bull, still smiling, raised his hat to Diana. She nodded to him,
briefly. For some reason she was vexed with him, but why she did
not know. Bull and Colby ran to the boot and dragged off the
Corson-Manill baggage, while Lillian presented Corson to Diana.
Corson was a young man&mdash;a typical New Yorker&mdash;in his
early thirties.</p>

<p>"Git a move on there, Bull," shouted Gatlin, "or they'll think I
ben held up agin."</p>

<p>"I reckon The Black Coyote's gone out o' business, fer a while,"
said Colby, shooting a quick look at Diana.</p>

<p>Instantly the girl's loyalty was in arms, "He's afraid to try it
while Bull's guarding the gold," she said.</p>

<p>"How much longer you goin' to keep me on the job?" asked Bull,
as he clambered to the seat of the already moving coach. "Mack
looks pretty all-fired healthy to me."</p>

<p>"Just another week or two, Bull," Diana shouted after him as the
stage careened away at full gallop.</p>

<p>"Isn't he wonderful!" exclaimed Miss Manill. "A real cowboy and
the first one I ever talked to!"</p>

<p>"Oh, there are lots of them here," said Diana, "just as nice as
Bull."</p>

<p>"So I see," replied Lillian Manill, smiling frankly at Hal
Colby, "but Bull, as you call him, is the only one I've met."</p>

<p>"Pardon me!" exclaimed Diana. "This is Mr. Colby, Miss
Manill."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're the foreman&mdash;Mr. Bull told me&mdash;how
exciting!"</p>

<p>"I'll bet he didn't tell you nothin' good about me," said
Colby.</p>

<p>"He told me about your heroic defense of Diana and my poor
uncle," explained Lillian.</p>

<p>Colby flushed. "If it hadn't ben fer Bull we'd all 'a' ben
killed," he said, ashamed.</p>

<p>"Why, he didn't tell me that," exclaimed the girl. "He never
said he was in the battle, at all."</p>

<p>"That is just like Bull," said Diana.</p>

<p>They were walking toward the house, Diana and Colby leading
their ponies, and the two Easterners looking interestedly at the
various buildings and corrals over which hung the glamour of that
irresistible romance which the West and a cattle ranch always hold
for the uninitiated&mdash;and for the initiated too, if the truth
were but known.</p>

<p>"It is just too wonderful, Mr. Colby," Lillian confided to the
big foreman walking at her side; "but doesn't it get awful
lonesome?"</p>

<p>"We don't notice it," he replied. "You know we keep pretty busy
all day with a big outfit like this and when night comes around
we're ready to turn in&mdash;we don't have no time to git
lonesome."</p>

<p>"Is this a very big outfit, as you call it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I reckon they ain't none much bigger in the territory," he
replied.</p>

<p>"And to think that you are foreman of it! What a wonderful man
you must be!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it ain't nothin'," he assured her, but he was vastly
pleased. Here, indeed, was a young lady of discernment.</p>

<p>"You big men of the great out-doors are always so modest," she
told him, a statement for which he could find no reply. As a matter
of fact, though he had never thought of it before, he realized the
justice of her assertion, and fully agreed with her.</p>

<p>She was looking now at the trim figure of her cousin, walking
ahead of them with Corson. "How becoming that costume is to Diana,"
she remarked; "and I suppose she rides wonderfully."</p>

<p>"She shore does&mdash;an' then some," he assured her.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I wish I could ride! Do you suppose I could learn?"</p>

<p>"Easy, Miss. It ain't nothin', oncet you know how."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose someone would teach me?" She looked up at him,
archly.</p>

<p>"I'd be mighty proud to larn you, Miss."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>would</i> you? How wonderful! Can we start right away,
tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"You bet we can; but you can't ride in them things," he added,
looking ruefully at her New York traveling costume.</p>

<p>She laughed gaily. "Oh, my! I didn't expect to," she cried. "I
am not such a silly as that. I brought my habit with me, of
course."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose it's all right," he said politely; "but you
don't have to bring no habits to Arizony from nowheres&mdash;we
mostly have enough right here, such as they be&mdash;good an'
bad."</p>

<p>Again her laugh rang out. "You big, funny man!" she cried. "You
are poking fun at me just because you think I am a
tendershoe&mdash;trying to make me believe that you don't know what
a riding habit is. Aren't you ashamed of yourself&mdash;teasing
poor little me?"</p>

<p>They were passing the bunk-house at the time, where the boys,
having scrubbed for supper, were squatting about on their heels
watching the newcomers with frank curiosity. After they had passed
Shorty gave Texas Pete a shove that sent him sprawling on the
ground. "Say," he said, "did you see them pants?"</p>

<p>"I shore did," replied Pete, "but you don't have no call to
knock me down an' git my ridin' habit all dusty, you gosh-dinged
tendershoe, jest because a guy blows in with funny pants on."</p>

<p>"Did you see the mug on Colby?" inquired Idaho. "He don't know a
ridin' habit from the cigarette habit."</p>

<p>"I reckon he thought she was confessin' a sin," said Texas
Pete.</p>

<p>"Oh, them pants! Them pants!" moaned Shorty, rocking to and fro
on his heels, his long arms wound around his knees. Shorty was six
feet three and thought that Kansas City was on the Atlantic
seaboard.</p>

<p>Corson's keen, quick eyes were taking in the salient features of
their immediate surroundings as he walked at Diana's side toward
the two-story adobe ranch house, on two sides of which a broad,
covered veranda had been built within recent years. He saw the
orderly, well kept appearance not only of the main buildings, but
of the corrals, fences and outbuildings as well. Everything bespoke
system and excellent management. It was evidently a well-ordered
plant in smooth running condition. He thought of it in terms of
Eastern factories and found it good.</p>

<p>"You keep things up well here," he said to Diana Henders. "I
want to compliment you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she replied. "It was something that Dad always
insisted upon, and of course I have carried out all his policies
since his death."</p>

<p>"What are these buildings&mdash;they look like cement, but of
course you wouldn't have that out here. The freight on it would
make the cost prohibitive."</p>

<p>"They are adobe," she explained, "just big, clay bricks dried in
the sun."</p>

<p>He nodded in understanding. "Nothing much very fancy about the
architecture," he commented, laughing. "The only attempt at
ornamentation is that sort of parapet on the roof of the house,
with the loop-holes in it, and that doesn't add much to the looks
of the place."</p>

<p>Diana thought that his criticisms were in rather poor taste, and
there was something about them that vaguely suggested the air of a
man viewing for the first time a property that he had only recently
acquired&mdash;something proprietorial that she inwardly resented.
Outwardly she was polite.</p>

<p>"You would think that it added a lot to the place," she told
him, "if you should ever chance to be here when the Apaches stage a
raid&mdash;it was never intended to be ornamental."</p>

<p>He sucked in his breath with a whistling sound. "You don't
mean," he exclaimed, "that they are so bad you have to live in a
fortress?"</p>

<p>"They haven't been on the warpath in any considerable numbers
for a long time," she assured him; "but that parapet has been used
more than once since the house was built, and there is always the
chance that it may come in handy again. It may not be beautiful
from this side, but I can tell you that it looks mighty good from
the other side when there are sneaking Apaches skulking behind
every out-house. I know, because I've viewed it under those
conditions."</p>

<p>"You think there is any great danger?" he asked her, looking
about nervously.</p>

<p>"There is always danger," she replied, for she saw that he was
afraid and a spirit of mischief prompted her to avenge his
indelicate criticisms of the home she loved. "It is only a matter
of weeks, you know," she reminded him, "since Dad was killed by
Apaches."</p>

<p>Corson appeared worried and his further scrutiny of the house as
they approached it was influenced by other than artistic
architectural considerations.</p>

<p>"I see you have heavy shutters at all the windows," he said. "I
suppose you have them closed and fastened every night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my, no!" she cried, laughing. "We never close them except
for dust storms and Indians."</p>

<p>"But suppose they come unexpectedly?"</p>

<p>"Then we stand a chance of getting dust or Indians in the
house."</p>

<p>"I think you had better have them closed nights while Miss
Manill is here," he said. "I am afraid she will be very
nervous."</p>

<p>"Oh, your rooms are on the second floor," she replied, "and you
can lock them all up tight&mdash;possibly you'll get air enough
from the patio. The nights are always cool, you know, but I'd feel
stuffy with all the shutters closed."</p>

<p>"We'll see," was all he said, but there was something about the
way he said it that she did not like. In fact, Diana Henders was
sure that she was not going to like Mr. Maurice B. Corson at
all.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>As they sat down to supper an hour later Lillian Manill looked
inquiringly at her cousin. "Where is Mr. Colby?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Over at the cook-house eating his supper, I suppose," replied
Diana.</p>

<p>"Don't he eat with us? He seems such a nice fellow."</p>

<p>"He is a nice fellow," replied Diana, "but the boys would rather
eat by themselves. Women folks would take away their appetites. You
have no idea how we terrify some of them."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Colby seemed very much at ease," insisted Lillian.</p>

<p>"Hal is different, but the very fact that he is foreman makes it
necessary for him to eat with the other men&mdash;it is
customary."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bull seemed at ease too, after I got him started,"
continued Lillian. "He isn't much of a talker, but he didn't seem a
bit afraid of me."</p>

<p>"Bull is not afraid of anything," Diana assured her; "but if you
got him to talk at all you must exercise a wonderful power over
men. I can scarcely ever get a dozen words out of him."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I've got a way with men," said Lillian,
complacently.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that you will find that Bull is not very
susceptible," said Diana, with just the vaguest hint of
tartness.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," replied the other; "he has promised to teach
me to ride and shoot."</p>

<p>Diana ate in silence for several minutes. She was wondering
already if she were going to like her cousin. But then, of course
she was&mdash;how silly of her to think she was not, she
concluded.</p>

<p>"I met an old friend on the stage today," remarked Corson,
presently.</p>

<p>Diana raised her eyebrows politely. "How nice," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was. Haven't seen him for a couple of years. Nice chap,
Jefferson Wainright. Fraternity brother. Of course I was years
ahead of him, but I used to see him when I'd go down to Cambridge
for the games. His governor's a nice old chap, too, and got a wad
of the long green."</p>

<p>"So he has told us," said Diana.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know them? They didn't mention it."</p>

<p>"I have met them. Mr. Wainright tried to buy the ranch."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I believe he did mention something of the kind. Why
didn't you sell it to him?"</p>

<p>"His offer was too low, for one reason, and the other is that I
do not care to sell my interest."</p>

<p>Corson and Miss Manill exchanged a quick glance that escaped
Diana.</p>

<p>"How much did he offer you?" asked Corson.</p>

<p>"Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Why, that seems a very fair price," said Corson.</p>

<p>"It is ridiculous, Mr. Corson," replied Diana, "and if you are
at all familiar with Mr. Manill's business you know it as well as
I."</p>

<p>"I am very familiar with it," replied the New Yorker. "In fact,
from your remarks I imagine that I am much more familiar with it
than you."</p>

<p>"Then you know that the cattle interests alone are worth three
times that amount, without considering the mine at all."</p>

<p>Corson shook his head. "I am afraid that way out here you are
too far from the financial center of the country to have a very
comprehensive grasp of values. Now, as a matter of fact, the bottom
has dropped out of the live-stock market. We'll be lucky if we make
expenses for the next year or so, and it probably never will come
back to what it was. And as for the mine, that, of course, is about
done. It won't pay to work it a year from now. If we could get two
hundred and fifty thousand dollars for this business we'd be mighty
lucky; but I doubt if old Wainright would renew that
offer&mdash;he's too shrewd a business man."</p>

<p>Diana Henders made no reply. She was wondering just how much
Maurice B. Corson did know about the live-stock market and the
mine. She was inclined to believe that he knew a great deal more
than his remarks concerning them would indicate.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>At the same hour Mary Donovan's boarders were gathered about her
table. She had other guests this evening in addition to her regular
clientele. There were the Wainrights, and Bull was there for supper
and breakfast as was usual when the bullion came down from the
mine.</p>

<p>It was not a gay company. Mack Harber and Jim Weller looked with
suspicion on Bull, an attitude that would have blossomed into open
and active hostility could they have gained the support of Gum
Smith; but Gum was not searching for trouble. He glowered at his
plate and hated Bull. Wildcat Bob inhaled soup and hated Gum
Smith.</p>

<p>The Wainrights scarcely raised their eyes from the business of
eating for fear of the embarrassment of meeting those of the man
who had run the elder Wainright off the Bar Y Ranch&mdash;an
occurrence which rankled horribly in the breasts of both. Bull,
taciturn as usual, ate in silence with something of the mien of a
lion feeding among jackals. Mary Donovan hovered in the doorway.
Bull laid down his spoon, drank a glass of water and rose from the
table.</p>

<p>"Sure an' won't ye have another helpin' o' puddin' now, Bull?"
urged Mary.</p>

<p>"No, thanks, Mrs. Donovan," he replied, "I'm plumb full." He
walked past her into the kitchen and out the back door. An almost
audible sigh of relief rose from the remaining guests.</p>

<p>"I reckon he thinks he owns the shack," commented Jim Weller
apropos of Bull's exit through the sacred precincts of Mary
Donovan's kitchen.</p>

<p>"Sure, he could have it fer the askin', the fine b'y he is,"
shot back Mary. "Him a-goin' out to fetch in wood fer me while the
loikes o' ye, Jim Weller, what ain't fit to black his boots, sits
here and makes re-marks about him, ye lazy whelp!" Mr. Weller
subsided.</p>

<p>The meal over, the guests departed with the exception of Mack
Harber, Jim Weller, and the Wainrights who had congregated on the
veranda.</p>

<p>"You don't seem to like the fellow they call Bull," remarked the
younger Wainright to Weller.</p>

<p>"I didn't say I didn't like him an' I didn't say I did," replied
Weller, noncommittally.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't like him," said Mack, vehemently. "I wouldn't
like my grandmother if she shot me in the belly."</p>

<p>"You mean that he shot you?" asked Wainright.</p>

<p>"The Black Coyote shot me, an' if Bull ain't The Black Coyote my
name's McGinnis."</p>

<p>"You really think that he has been pulling off these holdups?"
demanded the elder Wainright.</p>

<p>"I ain't the only one what thinks so," replied Mack. "Every one,
'most, thinks so, an' ef we had a decent sheriff that feller'd be
behind the bars where he belongs, er strung up to a cottonwood in
Hell's Bend. 'Pears to me like Gum was either in on the deal er
afeared of Bull."</p>

<p>"Gum's afeared of every one," said Weller.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Jefferson Wainright, Sr., "when we come over on
this side o' the hills I calc'late as how things air goin' to be a
heap sight different. There won't be no more o' this here funny
gunplay stuff. I'm a-goin' to run all o' these would-be bad men out
o' the country."</p>

<p>"You figgerin' on comin' over here?" asked Mack.</p>

<p>"I certainly am. I'm a-goin' to buy the whole Bar Y
out-fit."</p>

<p>"The Hell you is!" exclaimed Mack. "I heard that Miss Di
wouldn't sell it to you."</p>

<p>"She ain't got nothin' to say about it. I'm a-goin' to buy it
from the man that's runnin' that outfit now, an' he's a mighty good
business man, too."</p>

<p>"Who's that&mdash;Colby?"</p>

<p>"No, Colby nothin'&mdash;it's Mr. Corson of Noo York. He's
handlin' all o' John Manill's interests an' he just come here today
with Manill's daughter. We come over on the stage with them. I was
tellin' Corson of the fine airs that chit of a Henders girl puts
on, but things is goin' to be different now. Corson's goin' to
close out the estate an' the holdin's here is as good as sold to me
already."</p>

<h2><a id="ch10" name="ch10">X. &mdash; WILDCAT BOB GOES
COURTING</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BULL sat in a corner of The Chicago Saloon
watching the play at the faro table. It was too early to go to bed
and he was not a man who read much, nor cared to read, even had
there been anything to read, which there was not. He had skimmed
the latest Eastern papers that had come in on the stage and his
reading was over until the next shipment of gold from the mine
brought him again into contact with a newspaper. Then he would read
the live-stock market reports, glance over the headlines and throw
the paper aside, satisfied. His literary requirements were few.</p>

<p>A man who had drunk not wisely but too well lurched up to
him.</p>

<p>"Have a drink, stranger!" he commanded. It was not an
invitation.</p>

<p>"Ain't drinkin'," replied Bull, quietly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you be," announced the hospitable one. "When I says
drink, you drinks, see? I'm a bad man, I am. Whoopee!" and drawing
a six-shooter he commenced firing into the floor at Bull's
feet.</p>

<p>Suddenly a large man enveloped him from the rear, held his gun
hand aloft and dragged him away into an opposite corner, where, to
the accompaniment of a deluge of lurid profanity, he counselled him
to greater discretion.</p>

<p>"Why you blankety, blank, blank, blank!" he cried. "You tryin'
to commit sewerside? Don't you know who that is, you blitherin'
idjit?" then he whispered something in the other's ear. The effect
was electrical. The man seemed sobered instantly. With staring eyes
he looked across the room at Bull.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to git out o' here," he said, "he might change his
mind."</p>

<p>"I cain't see yit why he didn't bore ye," agreed his friend.
"You better go an' apologize."</p>

<p>Slowly the pseudo bad man crossed the room toward Bull, who had
not moved sufficiently to have changed his position since the man
had first accosted him. The man halted in front of Bull, a sickly
grin on his bloated countenance.</p>

<p>"No offense, pardner. Jest had a drop too much. No offense
intended. Jest jokin'&mdash;thet was all&mdash;jest jokin'."</p>

<p>Bull eyed him intently for a moment. "Oh, yes," he said
presently, "I remember you now&mdash;you're the flannel mouth what
got gay with ol' Wildcat a coupla months ago. Did you ever return
that window sash you took with you? I hearn Gum was powerful cut up
about that window sash." Not the shadow of a smile crossed Bull's
face. "I warn't there, but I hearn all about it."</p>

<p>The other flushed, attempted some witty repartee that fell flat,
and finally managed to make his escape amid a roar of laughter from
the nearer card players and spectators who had overheard the brief
dialogue.</p>

<p>Bull rose. "Goin'?" asked an acquaintance.</p>

<p>"I reckon so. Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night, Bull."</p>

<p>The man stepped out into the clear, star-lit night.
Involuntarily he turned and looked toward the northeast in the
direction of the Bar Y ranch. Diana was there. For a long time he
stood motionless gazing out across the arid, moon-bathed level that
stretched away to her loved feet. What emotions played behind the
inscrutable mask of his face? Who may say?</p>

<p>As he stood there silently he heard voices coming from between
The Chicago Saloon and <i>Gum's Place&mdash;Liquors and
Cigars</i>.</p>

<p>"He's in there now," said one. "I kin see him. If there weren't
so tarnation many fellers at the bar I c'd git him from here."</p>

<p>"You better come along afore you git in more trouble than you
got the capacity to handle," urged a second voice.</p>

<p>"Thas all right. I know what I'm doin'. There cain't no dried up
ol' buffalo chip like thet run me out o' no man's saloon an' get
away with it, an' thas all they is to thet."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm goin' home," stated the second voice. "I know when
I'm well off."</p>

<p>"You go home. After I shoot the ears offen this Wildcat Bob
party I'm comin' home, too."</p>

<p>"You go to shootin' any ears offen Wildcat Bob an' you won't
need no blankets where you're goin'."</p>

<p>"Thas-so? Well, here goes&mdash;you better stay an' see the
fun."</p>

<p>"I'm goin' now while I got the chanct," said the other, and Bull
heard him coming from the side of the building. The former stepped
quickly back into the doorway of The Chicago Saloon and an instant
later he saw the large man who had dragged his friend from him a
few minutes before pass up the street at a rapid walk. Then Bull
looked from his place of concealment, just in time to see another
figure emerge from between the buildings and enter Gum's Place.</p>

<p>Bull was close behind him. The door was open a crack. He saw
that the other had advanced into the room a few feet and was
standing behind one of the rough columns that supported the second
story. Across the room, at the far end, Wildcat Bob had just set
down his whiskey glass upon the bar, wiped his beard on his sleeve,
and turned away toward the tables where the gambling was in
progress. For a moment he would be alone, with only the rough rear
wall behind him.</p>

<p>Bull saw the stranger raise his six-gun to take deliberate aim.
He was too far away to reach him before he pulled the trigger and
it would do no good to warn the Wildcat. There was but a single
alternative to standing supinely by and watching old Wildcat being
shot down in cold blood by a cowardly murderer.</p>

<p>It was this alternative that Bull adopted. As the smoke rose
from the muzzle of his gun the stranger threw his hands above his
head, his weapon clattered to the floor, and he wheeled about. His
eyes alighted upon Bull standing there, grim faced and silent, the
smoking six-gun in his hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly the wounded man gave voice to a shrill scream. "He done
it!" he cried, pointing at Bull. "He done it! The Black Coyote done
it! He's killed me!" and with these last words the body slumped to
the floor.</p>

<p>Bull stood facing them all in silence for just a moment. The
whole room full of men and women were staring at him. Then he
slipped his gun into its holster and advanced into the room, a
faint smile on his lips. He walked toward Wildcat Bob.</p>

<p>"That hombre was after you, Bob," he said. "He was drunk, but I
couldn't stop him no other way. He's the feller you chased through
the window that time."</p>

<p>Gum Smith hurried to the rear of the bar. Then he leaned over it
and pointed a finger at Bull. "Yo'all's undah arrest!" he cried.
"Yo'all's undah arrest fo' murder."</p>

<p>"Go kick yourself through a knot-hole!" advised Bull. "Ef I
hadn't got that hombre he'd a-got Bob. They wasn't nothin' else to
do."</p>

<p>"Yo'all hearn what he called him, didn't yo?" yelled Gum. He
pointed at first one and then another. "Ah depatize yo! Ah depatize
yo!" he cried. "Arrest him, men!"</p>

<p>No one moved, except Wildcat Bob. He came and stood beside Bull,
and he drew both his long, heavy guns with their heavily notched
grips.</p>

<p>"Any one what's aimin' to take this boy, why, let him step up,"
said Wildcat Bob, and his watery blue eye was fixed terribly upon
the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Ah want yo-all to know thet when Ah depatizes yo', yo'-all's
depatized," shrilled Gum. "Yo hearn what the corpse called him.
Ain't that enough? Do yo duty, men!"</p>

<p>One or two of the men, friends of Gum's, moved restlessly. Bull,
sensing trouble, had drawn both his weapons, and now he stood
beside the Wildcat, his steady gray eyes alert for the first
hostile move.</p>

<p>"Don't none o' you gents go fer to start nothin'," he advised.
"You all seen what happened. You know I couldn't a-done nothin'
else, an' as fer what thet drunken bum called me ef Gum thinks I'm
The Coyote why don't he step up an' take me? I ain't a honin' fer
trouble, but I don't aim to be the subject o' no postmortem
neither."</p>

<p>"Do yo-all surrendah, then?" demanded Gum.</p>

<p>"Don't try to be no more of a damn fool than the Lord made yuh,
Gum," advised Wildcat Bob. "You know thet if this here boy ain't
The Black Coyote you don't want him, an' ef he is The Black Coyote
you wouldn't never git outen behind thet bar ef you was to try to
take him. Fer my part I don't believe he is, an' I got two ol'
pea-shooters here what thinks the same as I does. What do you
think, Gum?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the sheriff after a moment's deliberation, "Ah
reckon as mebby the corpse was mistook. Hev a drink on the house,
gents!"</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>As Bull and Wildcat Bob entered the office of The Donovan House
Mary Donovan espied them through the open doorway of her sitting
room and called to them.</p>

<p>"Come in an' have a drop o' tay wid me before yese go to bed,"
she invited, and as they entered she scrutinized Wildcat Bob with a
stern eye. Evidently satisfied, her face softened. "I know they
ain't run out o' whiskey in Hendersville," she said, "so I reckon
ye must o' run out o' money, Wildcat."</p>

<p>The little old gentleman reached into his pocket and drew forth
a handful of silver, which he displayed with virtuous
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"The saints be praised!" exclaimed Mary Donovan. "Ye've money in
yer pocket an' yer home airly an' sober! Be ye sick, Wildcat
Bob?"</p>

<p>"I've re-formed, Mary&mdash;I ain't never goin' to tech another
drop," he assured her, solemnly.</p>

<p>"Ye've not had a drink the avenin'?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" he hesitated, "you see<sup>___</sup>"</p>

<p>"Yis, I see," she snapped, scornfully.</p>

<p>"But, Mary, I only had one little one&mdash;you wouldn't
begrudge an old man one little nightcap?"</p>

<p>"Well," she consented, relenting, "wan little one wouldn't do no
harrm. I wouldn't moind one mesilf."</p>

<p>Wildcat Bob reached for his hip pocket. "I was thinking that
same thing, Mary, and that's why I brung one home fer yuh," and he
drew forth a pint flask.</p>

<p>"The divil fly away wid ye, Wildcat Bob!" she cried, but she was
smiling as she reached for the flask.</p>

<p>Bull rose, laughing. "Good night!" he said, "I'm going to turn
in."</p>

<p>"Have a drop wid us before ye go," invited Mary.</p>

<p>"No thanks, I've quit," replied Bull. A moment later they heard
him mounting the stairs to his room.</p>

<p>"He's a good b'y," said Mary, wiping her lips and replacing the
cork in the bottle.</p>

<p>"He is that, Mary," agreed Wildcat, reaching for it.</p>

<p>There was a period of contented silence.</p>

<p>"It's a lonesome life fer a widdy-lady, that it is," remarked
Mary, with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>Wildcat Bob moved his chair closer, flushed at his own boldness,
and fell to examining the toe of his boot. Mary rocked diligently,
her red hands folded in her ample lap, keeping an eye cocked on the
Wildcat. There was another long silence that was broken at last by
Mrs. Donovan.</p>

<p>"Sure," she said, "an' it's funny ye never married, Bob."</p>

<p>Bob essayed reply, but a mouthful of tobacco juice prevented.
Rising, he walked into the office, crossed that room, opened the
front door and spat copiously without. Returning to the room he
hitched his chair closer to Mary's, apparently by accident, as he
resumed his seat.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" he started, but it was evidently a false start, since
he commenced all over again. "I&mdash;" again he paused.</p>

<p>"You what?" inquired Mary Donovan with soft encouragement.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;" said Wildcat Bob and stuck again. Inward excitement
evidently stimulated his salivary glands, with the result that he
was again forced to cross to the outer door. When he returned he
hunched his chair a bit closer to Mary's.</p>

<p>"As ye was about to remark," prodded Mary.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I<sup>___</sup>"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mary, "Go on, Bob!"</p>

<p>"I was just a-goin' to say that I don't think it'll rain
tonight," he ended, lamely.</p>

<p>Mary Donovan placed her hands upon her hips, pressed her lips
tightly together and turned a withering glance of scorn upon
Wildcat Bob&mdash;all of which were lost upon him, he having again
returned to whole-souled consideration of the toe of his boot, his
face suffused with purple.</p>

<p>"Rain!" muttered Mary Donovan. "Rain in Arizony this time o'
year? Sure, an' ye mane ye thought it wouldn't shnow, didn't ye?"
she demanded.</p>

<p>Wildcat Bob emitted only a gurgle, and again silence reigned,
unbroken for long minutes, except by the creaking of Mary's rocker.
Suddenly she turned upon him.</p>

<p>"Gimme that flask," she said.</p>

<p>He handed it over and she took a long drink. Wiping the mouth of
the bottle with the palm of her hand she returned it to him. Then
Wildcat Bob took a drink, and the silence continued.</p>

<p>The evening wore on, the flask was emptied and midnight came.
With it came Gum Smith, reeling bedward. They watched him stagger
across the office floor and heard him stumbling up the stairs. Mary
Donovan arose.</p>

<p>"Be off to bed wid ye," she said. "I can't be sittin' here all
night gossipin' wid ye."</p>

<p>He, too, arose. "Good night, Mary," he said, "it's been a
pleasant evenin'."</p>

<p>"Yis," said Mary Donovan.</p>

<p>As Wildcat Bob climbed the stairs toward his room he was
mumbling in his beard. "Doggone my hide!" he said. "Ef I'd jest had
a coupla drinks I mout a-done it."</p>

<p>"Sure," soliloquized Mary Donovan, as she closed the door of her
bedroom, "it's not so dum funny after all that the ould fool nivir
was married."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11" name="ch11">XI. &mdash; "RIDE HIM, COWBOY!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">LILLIAN MANILL awoke early and viewed the
brilliant light of the new day through the patio windows of her
room&mdash;the outer windows were securely shuttered against
Indians. She stretched languorously and turned over for another
nap, but suddenly she changed her mind, threw off the covers and
arose. It was a hideously early hour for Lillian Manill to arise;
but she had recalled that there was to be a riding lesson after
breakfast and Diana had explained to her that the breakfast hour
was an early one. Dressing, she selected a tailored walking
suit&mdash;she would change into her riding habit after
breakfast&mdash;for she wanted to stroll about the yard a bit
before breakfast, and she knew that this new walking suit was
extremely fetching.</p>

<p>A few minutes later as she stepped into the yard she saw signs
of activity in the direction of the horse corrals and thither she
bent her steps. Texas Pete, who was helping the chore boy with the
morning feeding, saw her coming and looked for an avenue of escape,
being in no sense a lady's man and fully aware of the fact; but he
was too late&mdash;there was no avenue left, Lillian Manill being
already between him and the bunk-house. So he applied himself
vigorously to the pitch fork he was wielding and pretended not to
see her, a pretense that made no impression whatever upon Lillian
Manill. She paused outside the bars and looked in.</p>

<p>"Good morning!" she said.</p>

<p>Texas Pete pretended that he had not heard.</p>

<p>"Good morning!" she repeated in a louder voice.</p>

<p>"Mornin'," replied Pete, pulling at the brim of his hat and
immediately resuming the fork. He wished she would move on. The
horses were fed and there was no other excuse for him to remain in
the corral, but in order to reach the bunk-house he must pass
directly by this disconcerting person. Diana he did not
mind&mdash;he was used to Diana, and aside from the fact that he
was madly in love with her she caused him little embarrassment or
concern except upon those few occasions when he had attempted to
maintain an extended conversation with her. Dr. Johnson would have
found nothing in Pete's conversational attainments to have aroused
his envy.</p>

<p>Pete continued feeding the horses. He fed them twice as much as
they could eat in a day, notwithstanding the fact that he knew
perfectly well they were to be fed again that evening; but finally
he realized that he could defer the embarrassing moment no longer
and that the girl had not left. He stuck the fork viciously into
the hay stack and crossed the corral. He tried to appear
unconcerned and to pass her by without looking at her, but in both
he failed&mdash;first because he was very much concerned and second
because she placed herself directly in his path and smiled sweetly
at him.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I had the pleasure of meeting you last night,"
she said. "I am Miss Manill&mdash;Miss Henders' cousin."</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Pete.</p>

<p>"And I suppose you are one of the cow-gentlemen," she added.</p>

<p>Pete turned suddenly and violently purple. A choking sound
issued from his throat; but quickly he gained control of himself.
Something in that remark of hers removed instantly all of Texas
Pete's embarrassment. He found himself at once upon an even footing
with her.</p>

<p>"No'm," he said, "I hain't one o' the cow-gentlemen&mdash;I'm
on'y a tendershoe."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you don't look it," she told him, "with those leather
trousers with the fleece on. But you ride, don't you?" she added
quickly.</p>

<p>"I ain't larned yit," he assured her.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't that too bad! I thought of course you were a
wonderful equestrian and I was going to ask you to teach me to
ride; but you'd better come along after breakfast and we'll get Mr.
Colby to teach us both."</p>

<p>"I reckon he wouldn't like it," explained Pete. "You see I'm in
his afternoon ridin' class. He don't take nothin' but ladies in the
mornin'."</p>

<p>"Oh, does he teach riding regularly?"</p>

<p>"My, yes, that's what he's here fer. He's larnin' us all to ride
so's we kin go out on hosses an' catch the cows 'stid o' havin' to
hoof-it."</p>

<p>"I thought he was foreman," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes'm, but that's one of his jobs&mdash;larnin' cow-gentlemen
to ride."</p>

<p>"How interesting! I've learned so much already and I've only
been in Arizona since day before yesterday. Mr. Bull was so kind
and patient, answering all my silly little questions."</p>

<p>"I reckon Bull could answer most any question," he told her.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; but then he's been here in Arizona so long, and
had so much to do with the development of the country. Why, do you
know he planted all the willows along that funny little river we
followed for so long yesterday&mdash;miles and miles of them?"</p>

<p>"Did he tell you that?" inquired Texas Pete.</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't it wonderful? I think it shows such an artistic
temperament."</p>

<p>"There's more to Bull than I ever suspected," murmured Texas
Pete, reverently.</p>

<p>A sudden, clamorous, metallic din shattered the quiet of the
cool Arizona morning. The girl gave a little scream and sprang for
Texas Pete, throwing both arms about his neck.</p>

<p>"O-o-h!" she cried; "what is it&mdash;Indians?"</p>

<p>"No'm," said Pete, striving to disengage himself, for he saw the
malevolent eyes of several unholy cow-gentlemen gloating upon the
scene from the doorway of the bunk-house. "No'm, that ain't
Injuns&mdash;that's the breakfast bell."</p>

<p>"How silly of me!" she explained. "Now I suppose I must be
going. I'm so glad to have met you, Mr.<sup>___</sup>"</p>

<p>"My name's Texas Pete."</p>

<p>"Mr. Pete, and I do hope you learn to ride quickly. I am sure we
could have some lovely excursions, picnicking among the beautiful
hills. Oh, wouldn't it be divine&mdash;just you and I, Mr. Pete?"
and she let her great, lovely eyes hang for a moment on his in a
fashion that had turned more sophisticated heads than Texas
Pete's.</p>

<p>When she had gone and Pete was making his way toward the
cook-house he ran his fingers through his shock of hair. "By
gollies!" he muttered. "The outside o' her head's all right,
anyway."</p>

<p>As he entered the cook-house Shorty seized him and threw both
arms about his neck. "Kiss me darlin'!" he cried. "I ain't had a
single kiss before breakfast."</p>

<p>"Shet up, you long-legged walrus," replied Pete, grinning, as he
shoved the other aside.</p>

<p>He ate in silence despite the gibes of his companions, who
quickly desisted, realizing the futility of attempting to arouse
Texas Pete's ire by raillery. He was quick enough of temper and
quicker still with his guns when occasion warranted; but no one
could arouse his anger so long as their thrusts were shod with
fun.</p>

<p>"Lookee here, cook," he called promptly to that individual;
"you're the best eddicated bloke in this bunch o'
long-horns&mdash;what's a questreen?"</p>

<p>"Somethin' you puts soup in," replied the cook.</p>

<p>Texas Pete scratched his head. "I thought all along that I
didn't like her," he muttered, "an' now I knows it."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Diana Henders greeted her guests with a cheery smile and a word
of welcome as they entered the dining room for breakfast. "I hope
you slept well," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I did," exclaimed Lillian Manill. "I never knew a thing
from the time my head touched the pillow until broad daylight this
morning. I had a perfectly wonderful night."</p>

<p>"I didn't," said Corson, and Diana noticed then that he looked
tired and haggard. "What happened last night?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, nothing, that I know of," replied Diana. "Why do you
ask?"</p>

<p>"Have you seen any of your men this morning&mdash;or any of the
neighbors?" he continued.</p>

<p>"I have seen a couple of the men to talk with&mdash;we have no
neighbors."</p>

<p>"How many women are there on the place?" he went on.</p>

<p>"Just Lillian and I."</p>

<p>"Well, something terrible happened last night," said Corson. "I
never spent such a hideous night in my life. It's funny you didn't
hear it."</p>

<p>"Hear what?" asked Diana.</p>

<p>"That woman&mdash;my God! I can hear her screams yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, Maurice! what do you mean?" cried Miss Manill.</p>

<p>"It was about midnight," he explained. "I had been rather
restless&mdash;just dozing a little&mdash;when all of a sudden the
dogs commenced to bark and then a woman screamed&mdash;it was the
most awful, long-drawn, agonized wail I ever heard&mdash;some one
must have been torturing her. I'll bet the Indians were out last
night and the first thing you know you'll hear about a terrible
massacre. Well, it stopped all of a sudden and pretty soon the dogs
commenced to yap again&mdash;there must have been fifty of
'em&mdash;and then that woman shrieked again&mdash;I'll hear that
to my dying day. I don't think you ought to let any of the men go
away today until you find out just what happened last night. The
Indians may just be waiting for 'em to go and then they'll rush
down on us and kill us all."</p>

<p>A faint smile had slowly curved Diana's lips and brought little
wrinkles to the corners of her eyes.</p>

<p>"What you smiling about, Miss Henders?" demanded Corson. "If
you'd have heard that woman you wouldn't feel like
smiling&mdash;not for a long time."</p>

<p>"That wasn't a woman you heard, Mr. Corson&mdash;they were
coyotes."</p>

<p>He looked at her blankly. "Are you sure?" he asked,
presently.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm sure," she told him.</p>

<p>Corson breathed a sigh of relief. "I'd like to believe it," he
said. "I'd sleep better tonight."</p>

<p>"Well, you can believe it, for that is what you heard."</p>

<p>"I'd hate to be caught out after dark by 'em," he said. "A pack
of fifty or a hundred such as there was last night would tear a
fellow to pieces in no time."</p>

<p>"They are perfectly harmless," Diana assured him, "and the
chances are that there were no more than two or three of
them&mdash;possibly only one."</p>

<p>"I guess I heard 'em," he insisted.</p>

<p>"They have a way of sounding like a whole lot more than they
really are."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I guess I know what I heard."</p>

<p>"I'll have to show that cook of yours how to make coffee,"
remarked Corson a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Diana flushed. "I suppose we don't get the best coffee out
here," she said, "but we are accustomed to it and learn to like it
first rate. I think Wong does the best he can with what he has to
do with."</p>

<p>"Well, it won't hurt him any to learn how to make coffee," said
Corson.</p>

<p>"He has been with us a great many years and is very faithful. I
think he would be terribly hurt if a stranger criticised his
coffee," said Diana.</p>

<p>"Maurice is very particular about his food," said Miss Manill.
"It is really an education to hear him order a dinner at
Delmonico's, and the way he does flay the waiters if everything
isn't just so. I always get such a thrill&mdash;you can see people
at the nearby tables listening to him, and whispering to one
another."</p>

<p>"I can imagine," said Diana, sweetly, but she did not say just
what she could imagine.</p>

<p>Corson swelled visibly. "Call the Chink in, Miss Henders," he
said, "and I'll give him a lesson now&mdash;you might learn
something yourself. Way out here, so far from New York, you don't
get much chance, of course. There's really nothing quite like the
refining influences of the East to take the rough edges off of
people."</p>

<p>"I think I prefer to speak to Wong privately and in person, if I
find it necessary," said Diana.</p>

<p>"Well, just so I get some decent coffee hereafter," said Corson,
magnanimously.</p>

<p>Lillian Manill, having finished her breakfast, rose from the
table.</p>

<p>"I'm going to put on my riding habit now, Maurice," she said.
"Go out and tell Mr. Colby to wait for me."</p>

<p>Diana Henders bit her lip, but said nothing as Corson rose and
walked toward the door. He was garbed in a New York tailor's idea
of the latest English riding mode, and again Diana bit her lip, but
not in anger. Corson, setting his hat jauntily over one eye,
stalked into the open and down toward the corrals where the men
were saddling up for the day's work.</p>

<p>He lighted a big, black cigar and puffed contentedly. As he hove
in sight work in the corral ceased spontaneously.</p>

<p>"My Gawd!" moaned Texas Pete.</p>

<p>"Who left the bars down?" inquired Idaho.</p>

<p>"Shut up," cautioned Colby. "That feller's likely to be boss
around here."</p>

<p>"He won't never boss me," said Shorty, "not with thet funny hat
on. I wonder could I crease it?" and he reached for his gun.</p>

<p>"Don't git funny, Shorty. They's friends o' Miss Henders,"
whispered Colby. "It'd only make her feel bad."</p>

<p>He could not have hit upon a stronger appeal to these men.
Shorty lowered his hand from the butt of his gun and almost at once
work was resumed. When Corson joined them he could not have guessed
that he was the object either of ridicule or pity, though he
was&mdash;of both.</p>

<p>"Say, Colby," he said. "Saddle up a couple of safe horses for
Miss Manill and me, and wait around until she comes out. I want you
to give her a few lessons in riding."</p>

<p>"Did Miss Henders say that it would be all right?" he asked.
"You know the work is pretty well laid out an' we ain't got none
too many hands."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right, my man," Corson assured him. "You'll be
safe to do anything that I say. I'm handling Miss Manill's
interests and looking after everything in general until the estate
is closed. Just trot along and saddle up a couple of horses, and
see to it that they're gentle. I haven't ridden for a number of
years, although I was pretty good at it when I was a boy."</p>

<p>Hal Colby eyed Mr. Maurice B. Corson for a long minute. What was
transpiring in his mind it would have been difficult to guess from
the expression on his face; though what should have been going on
within the convolutions of his brain the other men knew full well,
and so they lolled around, their faces immobile, waiting for the
fun to begin, but they were doomed to disappointment, for there was
no gunplay&mdash;Colby, they thought, might have at least "made the
dude dance". Instead he turned away without a word to Corson, gave
some final directions for the day's work, swung into the saddle and
rode toward the office, utterly ignoring the Easterner's
instructions. Corson flushed angrily.</p>

<p>"Here you, one of you men," he snapped, turning toward the
punchers, most of whom had already mounted their ponies, "I want
two horses saddled immediately&mdash;one for Miss Manill and one
for me."</p>

<p>Silently, ignoring him as completely as though he had not
existed, the riders filed out of the corral past him. At a little
distance they drew rein, waiting for Colby.</p>

<p>"I've saw gall before," remarked Texas Pete in an undertone,
"but thet there dude tenderfoot's got more'n a brass monkey."</p>

<p>"If he don't c'ral thet jaw o' his pronto," growled Shorty, "I
ain't a-goin' to be responsible fer what happens&mdash;I cain't
hold myself much longer."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't a-took what Colby did," said Idaho.</p>

<p>"Some blokes'll take a lot to hold their jobs," said Shorty.</p>

<p>"They c'n hev mine right now," stated Texas Pete, "ef I gotta
take thet dude's lip."</p>

<p>"Here comes the boss now," said Idaho. "She'll settle things,
durn her pretty little hide," he added affectionately.</p>

<p>Diana had stopped just below the house to listen to Colby, whom
the men could see was talking earnestly to her.</p>

<p>"Look here, Di," he was saying, "I want to know ef I gotta take
orders from thet tin-horn lawyer feller. Is he boss round these
diggin's, or is you?"</p>

<p>"Why, I supposed I was, Hal," she replied, "though I must admit
that there appears to be a suspicion of doubt on the subject in Mr.
Corson's mind. What has he said to you?"</p>

<p>Colby told her, repeating Corson's words as nearly as he could,
and the girl could not suppress a laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, I reckon it's funny, all right," he said, testily, "but I
don't see the joke&mdash;hevin' a paper-collared cracker-fed dude
like that-un callin' me 'my man' an' orderin' me to saddle up a
hoss fer him, right in front o' all the boys. 'Trot along,' he
says, 'an' saddle up a couple o' hosses, an' see to it thet they're
plumb gentle.' My Gawd, Di! you don't expect me to take thet sort
o' jaw, do you?"</p>

<p>Diana, by this time, was frankly in tears from laughter, and
finally Colby himself was unable to longer repress a smile.</p>

<p>"Don't mind him, Hal," she said, finally. "He is just one of
those arrogant, conceited, provincial New Yorkers. They are mighty
narrow and disagreeable, but we've got to put up with him for a
short time and we might as well make the best of it. Go and ask
Willie to saddle up two horses for them, and be sure that the one
for Miss Manill is plumb gentle." She accompanied her last
instructions with the faintest trace of a wink.</p>

<p>Colby wheeled his pony and loped off to the corral, where he
imparted the boss's orders to the chore boy, Willie, lank,
raw-boned and pimply. Willie, who always thought of himself as Wild
Bill, swaggered off to catch up the two ponies, grinning inwardly
as he roped Gimlet for Mr. Maurice B. Corson.</p>

<p>Corson, seeing Diana approaching, had gone to meet her. He was
still red and angry.</p>

<p>"Look here, Miss Henders," he exclaimed. "You've got to tell
these fellows who I am. I asked them to saddle up a couple of
horses and they absolutely ignored me. You tell them that when I
give orders they are to be obeyed."</p>

<p>"I think it will be less confusing if the orders come from me,
Mr. Corson," she replied. "It is never well to have too many
bosses, and then, you see, these men are peculiar. They are unlike
the sort of men you have apparently been accustomed to dealing
with. You cannot talk to them as you would to a Delmonico
waiter&mdash;unless you are tired of life, Mr. Corson. They are
accustomed to me&mdash;we are friends&mdash;and they will take
orders from me without question, so I think that it will be better
all around if you will explain your wants to me in the future.
Colby told me what you wanted just now and the horses are being
saddled."</p>

<p>He started to speak and then, evidently reconsidering, caught
himself with a palpable effort. "Very well," he said, presently,
"we'll let it pass this time."</p>

<p>Together they walked toward the corral where Willie was saddling
a quiet, old horse for Miss Manill. Beside him stood Gimlet with
drooping head and dejected mien.</p>

<p>"Which one is for me, sonny?" demanded Corson.</p>

<p>Wild Bill glanced up in sullen scorn, eyed Mr. Corson for a
brief moment and then jerked a soiled thumb in the direction of
Gimlet.</p>

<p>"What! that old crow-bait?" exclaimed the New Yorker.</p>

<p>"You said you wanted a gentle hoss," explained Colby, lolling in
his saddle nearby, "an' Gimlet won't pitch."</p>

<p>"I don't want to ride a skate," growled Corson. "When I'm on a
horse I want to know I'm on something."</p>

<p>"You'll know you're on Gimlet," Colby assured him, sweetly, "he
ain't so dumb as he looks. Jest stick your spurs into him an' he'll
act quite lively."</p>

<p>"All right," said Corson, glumly; "tell him to hurry&mdash;I see
Miss Manill coming now."</p>

<p>There were others who saw her coming, too. Texas Pete was only
one of them.</p>

<p>"By gollies!" he exclaimed. "Look what's got loose!"</p>

<p>Lillian Manill was approaching jauntily, clothed in a black
riding habit, with a long, voluminous skirt, a man's collar and tie
and black silk hat, with a flowing veil wound around it. Shorty
eyed her for a long minute, then he let his gaze wander to Mr.
Corson.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't never be safe fer me to go to New York," he
confided to Idaho. "I'd shore laugh myself to death."</p>

<p>By the time Miss Manill joined the group the two horses were
saddled and Willie had led them out of the corral.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" exclaimed Miss Manill. "Haven't you a side-saddle? I
could never ride one of those horrid things."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Diana, "but we haven't one. I doubt if there
is a side-saddle in the county. I think you can work it though, if
you will put your leg around the horn. Next time I'll fix you up
with a skirt like mine and then you can ride astride."</p>

<p>"Are you sure the horse is perfectly safe?" inquired Lillian.
"I'll have to have a few lessons before I can ride one of those
bouncing ones. Oh, Mr. Colby, good morning! Here I am all ready for
my first lesson."</p>

<p>Her eyes took in the punchers grouped a few yards away. "I see
you are going to have quite a class this morning. Mr. Pete told me,
though, that you taught the cow-gentlemen in the afternoon."</p>

<p>Colby shot a quick glance at Pete, who had just been overcome by
a violent fit of coughing, and knowing Texas Pete, as he did,
grasped the situation at once.</p>

<p>"Oh, I had to give up the afternoon class," he told her, "after
I found they was a few like <i>Mr.</i> Pete who wouldn't never larn
to ride."</p>

<p>"Isn't that too bad," she said, politely. Then she turned toward
Corson. "I think you'd better try it first, Maurice. I'll watch how
you do it."</p>

<p>"All right," said he. "It's been a long time since I have
ridden, but I guess it'll come back to me quick enough. I might be
able to give you a few pointers at that."</p>

<p>He walked up to Gimlet's off side and took hold of the
saddlehorn, neglecting the reins, which Willie still held. Gimlet
eyed him sadly. When he essayed to place a foot in the stirrup the
pony side-stepped rapidly in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"You'd better mount from the other side, Mr. Corson," advised
Diana. "These horses are not broken to work with from the off
side."</p>

<p>"I knew all along he was a damn Injun," remarked Idaho.</p>

<p>"An' you better take the reins, you may need 'em," supplemented
Willie, who, at bottom, had a kind heart and shrank from
bloodshed.</p>

<p>Corson walked to the near side of Gimlet, gathered the reins
loosely in his right hand, stuck a foot into the stirrup, took hold
of the horn with both hands and pulled himself laboriously into the
saddle. Gimlet stood quietly.</p>

<p>"Giddap!" said Mr. Corson, but Gimlet moved not.</p>

<p>"Throw the hooks into him!" shouted Willie, gleefully.</p>

<p>"Why don't the old skate go?" demanded Corson, shaking the
reins.</p>

<p>"Use your spurs!" called one of the cowboys. "That's what you
bought 'em fer, ain't it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Corson used his spurs. The result was electrical,
galvanizing Gimlet into instant and surprising action&mdash;action
which glowingly elucidated the derivation of his name. He wheeled
dizzily round and round upon the same spot, and with lightning
rapidity.</p>

<p>Mr. Corson's funny hat flew off. He clawed at the horn in
intervals that he was not clawing at the loose reins in a mad
effort to gather them. Then Gimlet bolted. He ran for some hundred
yards, stopped and commenced wheeling again. Mr. Corson lost a
stirrup. Then he let go both reins and seized the horn with two
hands.</p>

<p>"Stop him!" he yelled. "Stop him! Whoa! Whoa!"</p>

<p>"Rip him open!" shrieked Willie. "Spur him in the eyes!"</p>

<p>"Ride him, cowboy!" yelled Idaho.</p>

<p>Again Gimlet bolted and this time Mr. Corson commenced to slip
dangerously to one side. A hundred-yard sprint back to where he had
started and Gimlet paused to wheel once more. It was the end. Mr.
Corson spun off, alighting on his back. He rolled over with
surprising agility and on hands and knees crawled rapidly away from
this man eater that he was sure was pursuing him. But Gimlet was
only standing dejectedly, with drooping ears.</p>

<p>Corson came to his feet. The men about him&mdash;rough fellows
with none of the finer sensibilities of New Yorkers&mdash;were
laughing rudely.</p>

<p>"It was a put-up job," he spluttered. "It was a put-up job.
You'll suffer for this, Colby! You told me that animal was
gentle."</p>

<p>"I told you he wouldn't pitch, mister!" snapped Colby. "An' he
didn't pitch."</p>

<p>Miss Manill had started back toward the house. "I think I'll not
ride this morning," she said.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12" name="ch12">XII. &mdash; CORSON SPEAKS</a>
</h2>

<p class="verse">"'COME here!' he yells then to the rest o' us
boys,<br>
'Step up to the fun'ral an' don't make no noise<br>
The while we inter all the barb-wire what's here,<br>
After which we'll dispose o' the seegars an' beer.'"</p>

<p>sang Texas Pete. "Hello! See whose came!"</p>

<p>Bull entered the bunk-house with a grin and a nod. "Still
singin' I see, Pete," he said. "Ain't you finished thet one
yit?"</p>

<p>Two weeks had slipped by since the arrival of Corson and Miss
Manill. Bull had just been relieved from duty as bullion guard and
was only now returning to the home ranch. In the weeks that he had
brought the gold down from the mine there had been no
holdup&mdash;The Black Coyote or Gregorio had not once been
seen.</p>

<p>"How's everything?" asked Bull.</p>

<p>"So-so," replied Texas Pete.</p>

<p>"Where's Colby? I gotta report to him."</p>

<p>"Up at the house&mdash;he eats there now."</p>

<p>Bull made no comment. He thought he understood why Hal Colby ate
at the house. One day soon, doubtless, he would sleep there, too,
as master.</p>

<p>"This Manill heifer got stuck on him an' insists on his eatin'
there," explained Pete. "Things ain't ben the same since them two
shorthorns hit the diggin's. The boss she looks tired and worried
all the time an' sadlike. I reckon she ain't got no more use fer
'em then the rest o' us."</p>

<p>"Is Colby gone on this Manill girl?" asked Bull.</p>

<p>"I dunno. Sometimes I reckons he is an' sometimes I reckons he
ain't. Looks like as if he wern't quite sure which side his bread
was buttered on an' he's waitin' to find out."</p>

<p>Bull busied himself arranging his blankets on his old bunk,
working in silence. Texas Pete eyed him surreptitiously. There was
a troubled look in Pete's eyes. Presently he coughed nervously. The
two men were alone in the bunk-house.</p>

<p>"Say, Bull," Pete finally broke the silence, "you an' me's ben
good pals."</p>

<p>Bull looked up from the work of folding his tarpaulin. "Who said
we ain't?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Nobody ain't said we ain't," Pete assured him.</p>

<p>"Then what's eatin' you?"</p>

<p>"It's only just what everybody's sayin', Bull," said Pete. "I
thort you'd orter know about it."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Thet you an' The Black Coyote air the same feller. Not thet it
makes any difference with me. I ain't askin' whether you air or
whether you ain't. I'm just a-tellin' you fer your own good."</p>

<p>Bull smiled one of his slow smiles. "If I wasn't I'd say so,
wouldn't I?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I reckon you would."</p>

<p>"An' if I was I'd say I wasn't, wouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"I reckon you would," assented Pete.</p>

<p>"Then what the hell's the use o' sayin' anything?" he demanded.
"And 'specially when I don't give a damn what they think."</p>

<p>Pete shook his head. "I dunno," he said.</p>

<p>Bull started for the doorway. "I'm goin' up to the house to
report to Colby," he said.</p>

<p>"Look out thet Manill heifer don't git her grub-hooks on you,"
cautioned Pete.</p>

<p>In the office he found Diana Henders writing a letter. She
looked up with a little start as she heard his voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bull!" she cried, "I'm so glad you're back."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Miss. I come up to report to Colby, but I see he ain't
here."</p>

<p>"He's in the living-room with Mr. Corson and Miss Manill," she
told him.</p>

<p>"I reckon I'll see him later then." He started to leave.</p>

<p>"Don't go, Bull," she said. "I want to talk with you. Please sit
down."</p>

<p>He walked toward her and lowered himself into the big easy chair
that had been her father's. His movements were like those of a
lion&mdash;silent, powerful and yet without stealth.</p>

<p>For the first time in weeks the sense of loneliness that had
constantly oppressed her vanished. Bull was back! It was as if a
big brother had come home after a long absence&mdash;that was why
she was so glad to see him. Her heart forgot the thing that her
reason had been practically convinced of&mdash;that Bull was the
bandit of Hell's Bend&mdash;that it was Bull who had been robbing
her father and her for months&mdash;that it was Bull who had shot
Mack Harber.</p>

<p>She only knew that she felt relief and safety when Bull was
near. Nearly everyone feared him&mdash;many hated him. Could they
all be wrong? Could she alone be right in believing in
him?&mdash;as her heart did against the wise counseling of
reason.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss?" he said, interrogatively.</p>

<p>"The Wainrights are trying to buy the ranch again, Bull," she
said, "and Mr. Corson seems to favor the idea."</p>

<p>"Do you want to sell?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, I do not; but the worst of it is the price they want to
accept&mdash;two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for all our
holding&mdash;ranch, cattle and mine. They are bringing all kinds
of pressure to bear on me. Mr. Corson says I must either buy them
out or agree to the sale. I haven't the cash to buy them out and
they won't take my notes."</p>

<p>"Don't sell, Miss, at that price, an' don't sell at all if you
don't want to&mdash;they can't force you to sell."</p>

<p>"But they make it so unpleasant for me, and Mr. Corson is always
telling me that the bottom has fallen out of the live stock
business and that the new vein in the mine doesn't exist."</p>

<p>"The live stock business is all right, Miss. It wasn't never
better, an' as fer the new vein that's all right too. I was
scratchin' around a little bit myself while I was up there these
past six weeks. The gold's there all right. The trouble is you
ain't got the right man up there&mdash;that new superintendent
looks to me like a sharper. Did you know the Wainrights was up
there often?"</p>

<p>"No! really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, an' that superintendent is thick as thieves with 'em."</p>

<p>"He has no business to permit them on the property."</p>

<p>"He does though," said Bull, "but he raised thunder when he
found I'd been snootin' around the workings. I don't like that
hombre, Miss."</p>

<p>"Everybody seems to be against me, Bull, and it's so hard to
know what to do, now that Dad's gone. Mr. Corson and my cousin are
nagging at me all the time to agree to sell. Sometimes I am almost
determined to just to get rid of them."</p>

<p>"If you want to git rid o' them, Miss, that's easy," said Bull.
"All you gotta do is say so an' I'll run 'em off the ranch an'
outta the county. I wouldn't like nothin' better."</p>

<p>"I thought you had taken quite a fancy to my cousin, coming in
on the stage," said Diana.</p>

<p>"The only rope she could ever have on me, Miss, is that she's
your cousin," replied Bull, and she knew that he meant it. "If you
want me to run 'em out of the country, say the word, an' I'll start
'em in ten minutes&mdash;an' keep 'em on the jump, too."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that wouldn't do, Bull," she said, smiling.</p>

<p>"I don't see why not," he replied.</p>

<p>Just then, Hal Colby entered the room. He nodded to Bull.</p>

<p>"You back?"</p>

<p>Bull took no notice of a question so obviously foolish.</p>

<p>"How long you ben back?" continued Colby.</p>

<p>"'Bout half an hour."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you report?" Colby was vexed. The easy familiarity
of Bull's attitude, stretched comfortably as he was in Mr. Henders'
chair, and in pleasant converse with Diana, galled him.</p>

<p>"Ain't you got eyes?" inquired Bull. "Cain't you see me sittin'
here reportin' to my boss?"</p>

<p>"You're supposed to report to me," snapped Colby.</p>

<p>"I'm apt to do lots of things I ain't supposed to do," Bull told
him, softly.</p>

<p>"I reckon most everybody knows that, too," said Colby,
meaningly.</p>

<p>"Come!" cried Diana. "Don't you boys quarrel&mdash;I have
troubles enough now. Bull was looking for you, to report, when he
came up here," she told Colby. "He asked for you."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he say so, then? I got some work for him an' I ben
expectin' him all day."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm here," said Bull. "What do you want me to do?" His
voice, unlike Colby's, carried no trace of anger, if he felt
any.</p>

<p>"Cramer wants off a few days an' I want you to go over to the
West Ranch an' look after the hosses 'til he comes back. They's
some colts over there that needs to be rid&mdash;Cramer'll tell you
all they is to do."</p>

<p>"When do you want me to go?"</p>

<p>"Tonight&mdash;that'll give Cramer a chance to git an early
start in the mornin'."</p>

<p>"All right," said Bull, rising. "Good night, Miss."</p>

<p>"Good night, Bull. I may ride over while you're at the West
Ranch. I've been intending to look the place over for a month or
more. Cramer said we needed some new corrals."</p>

<p>He nodded and left the room.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you kin be decent to a feller what's ben
robbin' you an' your dad fer months," said Colby, after Bull had
left. "'Er mebby you don't believe it even now?"</p>

<p>"I know it looks suspicious, Hal; but it's so hard to believe it
of Bull. I hate to believe it. I almost don't believe it. You are
hard on him because you don't like him."</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you he was one of my best friends&mdash;you know
that&mdash;till I got wise to his game. I ain't a-wantin' no
rattlesnake like thet as no friend o' mine."</p>

<p>Diana sighed and rose wearily from her chair. "I'm going up to
wash for supper," she said.</p>

<p>She had been gone but a moment when Corson entered the
office.</p>

<p>"Well," he asked, "has she changed her mind?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say nothing about the matter to her," replied Colby.
"It wouldn't have done no good after what I hearn Bull a-tellin'
her just afore I come in the room."</p>

<p>"What was that?" demanded Corson.</p>

<p>"He was a-tellin' her not to sell, an' furthermore he offers to
run you an' Miss Manill outta the country if she gives the
word."</p>

<p>"What did she say to that?" Corson's voice showed indications of
nervousness.</p>

<p>"Oh, she wouldn't stand fer that, o' course; but he's a
dangerous feller to have around her. He's got too damn much
influence over her."</p>

<p>"I wish we could get rid of him," said Corson. "It seems funny
that he isn't arrested, when everyone knows he's The Black
Coyote."</p>

<p>"He'll run his neck into a noose one o' these days," replied
Colby.</p>

<p>"But in the meantime he may spoil this deal with Wainright,"
said Corson, "and I've got my heart set on that. I want to get out
of this damned country. It gives me the willies. Too many Indians,
and coyotes, and irresponsible kids with fire arms&mdash;it isn't
safe."</p>

<p>"I don't see why you are so anxious to sell now," said Colby.
"You can get more if you half try."</p>

<p>"That would mean going back to New York. There isn't any capital
out here. Wainright is a find, pure and simple. I can't chance
taking the time to arrange a deal back East&mdash;I don't know what
Miss Henders would be up to out here. What Miss Manill wants to do
is get some ready money out of it quick and get out. I guess
there's only one thing to do and that's to spring my last card on
the girl. I'd rather have done it an easier way, but she's so damn
stubborn she's forcing me to it."</p>

<p>"To what?" asked Colby.</p>

<p>Corson leaned close to him and whispered for several minutes
into his ear.</p>

<p>When he was through Colby leaned back in his chair and whistled.
"You don't mean it!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Wainright is coming over to Hendersville on the stage tomorrow
and I want to get this matter settled with the Henders girl so that
I can have something definite to say to him. I think she's coming
around all right now that she is commencing to realize that the
mine's about played out and that the cattle business isn't much
better. Of course it don't make much difference what she thinks
about it except that she could make it mighty unpleasant around
here if she wanted to."</p>

<p>"She shore could make it unpleasant fer you and Wainright ef she
wanted to," agreed Colby, "an don't fool yourself that she thinks
the business ain't worth nothin'. Ef you had her thinkin' so today,
Bull's give her something new to think about since he was
here."</p>

<p>"Hows that?" demanded Corson.</p>

<p>"I hearn him tellin' her he'd ben diggin' 'round in the mine
while he was up there an' that he knows the new vein's rich as all
get-out, an' he told her the cattle business was all right, too. I
reckon she'll believe him afore she will you."</p>

<p>Corson bit his lip. "That settles it!" he exclaimed. "I've
fooled around long enough. I'm going to tell her tonight."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Outside the bunk-house some of the men were washing for supper.
Inside, Bull was rolling and roping his bed preparatory to moving
to the West Ranch after the evening meal.</p>

<p>"What yuh doin'?" demanded Texas Pete. "Yuh ain't quit?"</p>

<p>"Goin' over to the West Ranch&mdash;Cramer's gettin' off fer a
spell," explained Bull.</p>

<p>"Looks like they weren't crazy fer your company here," remarked
Pete.</p>

<p>Bull shrugged his shoulders and went on with the business of
half-hitches, to the final knot, after which he tossed the bed-roll
onto his bunk.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think you'd stay on, Bull," said Texas Pete. "Let's
pull our freight. I ain't never ben to Calyforny&mdash;hev
you?"</p>

<p>The ex-foreman shook his head. "I got my own reasons fer stayin'
on a spell yet, Pete," he said.</p>

<p>Pete said nothing more on the subject. Bull's answer to his
suggestion that they leave the country troubled him, however. It
was not Diana Henders who was keeping Bull, of that Pete was
certain, because Hal Colby had long since as much as admitted that
he, Colby, was engaged to marry the dainty boss.</p>

<p>It wasn't because of any love he had for the job,
either&mdash;Texas Pete knew that&mdash;for Colby had never made
Bull's job any too easy since the former had become foreman, and
Bull was not staying because he loved Colby. It was true that he
never spoke a derogatory word concerning him, nor once had he
criticized his methods as foreman, but Texas Pete knew as well as
though Bull had told him that the latter had no use for the
foreman.</p>

<p>What was it, then, that was keeping Bull? Texas Pete's loyalty
to his friend made it difficult for him to harbor the only answer
that his knowledge of events permitted him to entertain; but that
answer to the question persisted in obtruding itself upon his
consciousness.</p>

<p><i>If</i> Bull was, after all, The Black Coyote he could not
work to better advantage as a bandit than while in the employ of
the Bar Y outfit, where he could easily obtain first-hand knowledge
of every important bullion shipment.</p>

<p>"By gollies!" soliloquized Texas Pete, "I don't give a durn ef
he be, but I'll be durned ef I believe it yit!"</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>At the house Hal Colby was talking earnestly to Lillian Manill
in the sitting room. Supper had not yet been served, Corson had
gone to his room to clean up and Diana had not yet come down.</p>

<p>"Look here, Lill," Colby was saying. "I don't like the way
Corson's treatin' Di. I think a heap o' thet little girl an' I
don't want to see her git the worst of it."</p>

<p>Lillian Manill reached up and encircled his neck with her arms.
"I thought you were all over that, Hal," she said. "You've been
telling me how much you love me, but how do you expect me to
believe it if you're always thinking of her and not ever
considering my interests. You want her to have all the property and
you don't want me to have any. You don't love me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, Lill&mdash;I'm crazy about you," he insisted.</p>

<p>"Then act like it," she advised him, "and quit siding with her
all the time. I'm going to be a rich girl, Hal, and we can have a
mighty good time after we're married, if you don't go and make a
fool of yourself and try to keep me out of what rightly belongs to
me."</p>

<p>"I ain't always so durned sure you're goin' to marry me," he
said gloomily. "You've ben pretty thick with thet feller Corson,
an' he's sweet on you&mdash;enny fool c'd tell thet."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw!" exclaimed Lillian Manill, laughing lightly; "why,
old Maurice is only like a big brother to me. Now give me a kiss
and tell me that you won't let Diana or anyone else steal all our
money." She drew his face down to hers and their lips met in a long
kiss.</p>

<p>When they separated Colby was panting heavily. "Gawd!" he
exclaimed huskily. "I'd commit murder fer you."</p>

<p>In the shadows of the hall stood Maurice B. Corson, scowling
darkly upon them through the partially opened door-way. Presently
he coughed discreetly and a moment later entered the room, where he
found Lillian idly turning sheets of music at the piano, while
Colby was industriously studying a picture that hung against the
wall.</p>

<p>Corson accosted them with a pleasant word and a jovial smile,
and a minute later Diana Henders entered the room and the four went
in to supper. The meal, like its predecessors for some weeks, was
marked by noticeable constraint. The bulk of the conversation
revolved about the weather, about the only thing that these four
seemed to have in common that might be openly discussed, and as
Arizona summer weather does not offer a wide field for discussion
the meals were not conspicuous for the conversational heights
attained. Nor was this one any exception to the rule. When it was
nearly over Corson cleared his throat as is the habit of many when
about to open an unpleasant subject after long deliberation.</p>

<p>"Miss Henders," he commenced.</p>

<p>Hal Colby arose. "I gotta see Bull before he leaves," he
announced hastily, and left the room.</p>

<p>Corson started again. "Miss Henders," he repeated, "I have a
painful duty to perform. I have tried to work in harmony with you,
but I have never met with any cooperation on your part, and so I am
forced to reveal a fact that we might successfully have gotten
around had you been willing to abide by my judgment in the matter
of the sale of the property."</p>

<p>"And what fact is that?" asked Diana, politely.</p>

<p>"We will get to it presently," he told her. "Now, my dear young
lady, your father's death has left you in very unfortunate
circumstances, but, of course, as is natural, Miss Manill wants to
do what she can for you."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that I do not understand," said Diana. "Lillian and
I have suffered equally in the loss of our fathers and our uncles,
and together we have inherited the responsibilities of a rather
large and sometimes cumbersome business. I am sure that we wish to
help one another as much as possible&mdash;I as much as she."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that you do not understand, Miss Henders," said
Corson, solemnly. "By the terms of your uncle's will everything
would have gone to your father had he survived Mr. Manill, but he
did not. Your father made a similar will, leaving everything to
your uncle. So you see, Miss Henders!" Corson spread his palms and
raised his brows in a gesture of helplessness.</p>

<p>"I must be very dense," said Diana, "for I am sure I do not know
even yet what you are driving at, Mr. Corson."</p>

<p>"It is just this," he explained; "your father left everything to
your uncle&mdash;your uncle left everything to his daughter. It is
very sad, Miss Henders&mdash;Miss Manill has grieved over it a
great deal; but the law is clear&mdash;it leaves you
penniless."</p>

<p>"But it is not what was intended and there must be another
will," exclaimed Diana. "Uncle John and Dad both wished that, when
they were gone, the estate should be divided equally between their
lawful heirs&mdash;half and half. Dad left such a will and it was
his understanding that Uncle John had done likewise&mdash;and I
know he must have for he was the soul of honor. Their wills were
identical&mdash;Dad has told me so more than once. They had such
implicit confidence in one another that each left everything to the
other with the distinct understanding that eventually it all was to
go to the heirs of both, as I have explained."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt that your father left such a will, if you say he
did; but the fact remains that Mr. Manill did not," said Mr.
Corson, emphatically. "But you shall not want, Miss Henders. Your
cousin will see to that. She has already authorized me to arrange
for an annuity that will keep you from want until you are
married&mdash;we thought best not to continue it beyond that time
for obvious reasons."</p>

<p>"You mean," asked Diana, dully, "that I have nothing? That I am
a pauper&mdash;that even this roof under which I have lived nearly
all my life does not belong, even in part, to me&mdash;that I have
no right here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, please, don't say that, dear!" exclaimed Lillian Manill.
"You shall stay here just as long as you wish. You will always be
welcome in my home."</p>

<p>"<i>My home!</i>" Diana suppressed a sob that was partially
grief and partially rage. The injustice of it! To take advantage of
a technicality to rob her of all that rightly belonged to her. She
was glad though that they had come out into the open at
last&mdash;why had they not done so before?</p>

<p>"Of course," said Corson, "as Miss Manill says, you are welcome
to remain here as long as the property is in her hands, but, as you
know, we have received an advantageous offer for it and so it is
only fair to tell you that you might as well make your plans
accordingly."</p>

<p>"You are going to sell to Wainright for two hundred and fifty
thousand?" asked Diana.</p>

<p>Corson nodded. Diana rose and walked the length of the room,
then she turned and faced them. "No, you are not going to sell, Mr.
Corson, if there is any way in which I can prevent it. You are not
going to steal my property so easily. Why have you been attempting
all these weeks to persuade me to agree to a sale if you knew all
along that I had no interest whatsoever in the property?" she
demanded suddenly.</p>

<p>"That was solely due to a desire on our part to make it as easy
as possible for you," he explained, suavely. "Your cousin would
have given you half the purchase price rather than have had to tell
you the truth, Miss Henders; but you have forced it upon us. She
desires to sell. It is her property. You alone stood in the way.
You have been your own worst enemy, Miss Henders. You might have
had one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars had you not been
stubborn&mdash;now you must be content with whatever Miss Manill
sees fit to allow you in the way of an annuity."</p>

<p>Diana squared her shoulders as she faced them. "Miss Manill
shall give me nothing&mdash;I will not accept as a gratuity what
rightfully belongs to me. If you think, Mr. Corson, that you are
going to take my property away from me without a fight, you are
mistaken," and she wheeled about and started for the doorway.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, Miss Henders!" cried the New Yorker. "I am a
lawyer and I know how expensive litigation is. Such a case as you
contemplate, and I take it for granted that you purpose taking the
matter to court when you say 'fight,' might drag on for years,
wasting the entire property in attorneys' fees and legal expense,
so that neither of you would get anything&mdash;I have seen such
things happen scores of times.</p>

<p>"Now, let us rather compromise. We were willing to make you a
gift of half the purchase price immediately on the consummation of
the sale to Mr. Wainright. That offer is still open. It is
extremely fair and generous and if you will take my advice you will
accept it."</p>

<p>"Never!" snapped Diana.</p>

<p>Corson and Lillian sat in silence listening to Diana's
foot-falls as she ascended the stairs. Presently they heard her
door close, then the girl turned upon Corson. "You poor sucker,
you!" she exclaimed. "What do you think you are, offering her a
hundred and twenty-five thousand when we don't have to give her a
cent!"</p>

<p>"Don't be a hog, Lill," advised the man. "We'll get enough, and
if we can save a lot of trouble we'd better let her have the
hundred and twenty-five. You can't tell what these people out
here'll do.</p>

<p>"Take that Bull fellow, for instance&mdash;he's already offered
to run us out of the country if she says to. Look what he did to
old man Wainright, for instance. Why, say, there are a lot of her
friends here that would think no more of shooting us full of holes
than they would of eating their Sunday dinners, if she just so much
as hinted that she thought we were trying to do her out of
anything.</p>

<p>"And we'll be getting plenty, anyway&mdash;you and I each get a
third and Wainright gets the other third&mdash;and that mine alone
is worth millions. Why, we could afford to give her the whole two
hundred and fifty thousand dollars if she'd agree to the sale."</p>

<p>"I'm not so keen as you on giving my money away," replied
Lillian.</p>

<p>"Your money, hell," he replied. "You wouldn't have anything if
it wasn't for me, and as for that measly little hundred and
twenty-five thousand, why, it'll cost us all of that to square
these people around here before we get through with it&mdash;I've
promised Colby ten thousand already, and say, speaking of Colby, I
saw you two in the sitting room before supper. You got to lay off
that business&mdash;you're getting too thick with that fellow to
suit me. You belong to me," he added suddenly and fiercely.</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, Maurice, don't be silly," replied Lillian. "You
told me to get him on our side. How did you suppose I was going to
do it&mdash;by making faces at him?"</p>

<p>"Well, you don't have to go too far. I heard you telling him
what you two would do after you were married. You may be a good
little actress, Lill, but that kiss you gave him looked too damn
realistic to suit me. I'm not going to have you running off with
him after you get your mitts on a little money."</p>

<p>"Say, you don't think I'd marry that rube, do you?" and Lillian
Manill burst into peals of laughter.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Colby found Bull in the bunk-house.</p>

<p>"Bull," he said, "I wish you'd ride up Belter's tomorrer an' see
how the water's holdin' out."</p>

<p>"Listen, Bull," said Texas Pete, "I got the rest of it:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"An' so we lines up at the bar, twelve or
more;<br>
The boss tries to smile, but he caint, he's so sore.<br>

<h2><a id="ch13" name="ch13">XIII. &mdash; THE NECKTIE PARTY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Diana Henders left the dining room after
hearing Corson's explanation of her status as an heir to the estate
of her father and uncle she definitely severed relations with the
two whom she now firmly believed had entered into a conspiracy to
rob her of her all. The following day she ate her meals in the
kitchen with Wong to whom she confided her troubles. The old
Chinaman listened intently until she was through, then he arose and
crossed the kitchen to a cupboard, a crafty smile playing over his
wrinkled, yellow countenance.</p>

<p>"Me fixee&mdash;me no likum," he said, as he returned with a
phial of white powder in his hand.</p>

<p>"O, Wong! No! No!" cried the girl, grasping instantly the
faithful servitor's intent. "You mustn't do anything so horrible as
that. Promise me that you won't."</p>

<p>"All lightee&mdash;jest samee you say," he replied with a shrug,
and returned the phial to the cupboard.</p>

<p>"I'm going away tonight, Wong," she told him, "and I want you to
promise me that nothing like that will happen while I am away and
that you will stay until I return. There is no one else I could
trust to look after the house."</p>

<p>"You clomee backee?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Wong, I'm going to Hendersville tonight so that I can
catch the stage for Aldea in the morning. I am going to take the
train for Kansas City and consult some of Dad's friends and get
them to recommend a good lawyer. You'll take care of things for me,
Wong?"</p>

<p>"You bletee blootee!"</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>That afternoon she sent for Hal Colby and told him what Corson
had said to her. Colby seemed ill at ease and embarrassed.</p>

<p>"I'm mighty sorry, Di," he said, "but I don't see what you kin
do about it. If I was you I'd accept half the purchase price. They
got you dead-to-rights an' you won't make no money fightin'
'em."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't accept it, and I'm surprised that you'd advise me
to."</p>

<p>"It's only fer your own good, Di," he assured her. "It ain't
Lillian's fault that your uncle done your dad outen the property.
You cain't blame her fer wantin' what was left to her an' I think
it was mighty pretty of her to offer to split with you."</p>

<p>"I don't," she replied, "and I think there is something behind
that offer that is not apparent on the face of it. I am going to
find out, too. I'm going to Kansas City to hire a lawyer and I'll
want the buckboard and one of the men to drive me to town after
supper tonight."</p>

<p>"I'm plumb sorry, Di, but Corson an' Lillian have took the
buckboard to town already."</p>

<p>"Then I'll go on Captain," she said. "Please have him saddled
for me right after supper."</p>

<p>She packed her traveling dress and other necessary articles in a
small bag that could be tied to a saddle, leaving on her buckskin
skirt and blouse for the ride to town, and after supper made her
way to the corral after waiting a few minutes for Captain to be
brought to the house and rather wondering why Hal had neglected to
do so.</p>

<p>To her surprise she discovered that Captain had not even been
saddled, and was, as a matter of fact, still running in the pasture
a mile from the house. She went to the bunk-house to get one of the
men to catch him up, but found it deserted. From there she walked
to the cook-house, where she found only the cook setting bread for
the morrow.</p>

<p>"Where are all the men?" she asked.</p>

<p>"They's a dance to Johnson's tonight an' some of 'em went
there," he told her. "The rest went to town. Idaho, Shorty an' Pete
went to the dance."</p>

<p>"Where's Hal?"</p>

<p>"I reckon he went to town&mdash;I ain't seen him since this
arternoon some time."</p>

<p>"Did Willie go too?"</p>

<p>"No'm, he's here sommers&mdash;hey, Willie! You Willie!"</p>

<p>Willie appeared from the outer dusk. "Oh, Willie," said Diana,
"won't you please catch Captain up for me and saddle him?"</p>

<p>"You ain't goin' to ride tonight all alone, be you?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I've got to get to town, Willie, and Hal forgot to tell anyone
to ride with me," she explained.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll go along with you," said Willie. "I'll have the
hosses saddled pronto," and off he ran.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later they were in the saddle and loping away
through the rapidly falling night toward town.</p>

<p>"I can't understand how Hal happened to let all the boys go at
the same time," she said, half musingly. "It was never done before
and it isn't safe."</p>

<p>"Bull wouldn't never have done it," said Willie. "Bull was a
top-notch foreman."</p>

<p>"You like Bull?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You bet I do," declared Willie, emphatically; "don't you?"</p>

<p>"I like all the boys," she replied.</p>

<p>"Bull wouldn't never have left you here alone at night. He set a
heap o' store by you, Miss." Willie was emboldened to speak freely
because of the darkness that would cover any sudden embarrassment
he might feel if he went too far. The same darkness covered Diana's
flush&mdash;a flush of contrition that she harbored a belief in
Bull's villainy.</p>

<p>Before they entered Hendersville they became aware that
something unusual was going on in town. They could hear the hum of
excited voices above which rose an occasional shout, and as they
rode into the single street they saw a hundred figures surging to
and fro before Gum's Place. A man stood on the veranda of the
saloon haranguing the crowd.</p>

<p>"This business has gone fer enough," he was saying as Diana and
Willie paused at the outskirts of the crowd. "It's high time we put
a end to it. You all knows whose 'a' doin' it as well as I do. What
we orter do is ride out'n git him tonight&mdash;they's a bunch o'
cottonwoods where he is right handy an' we got plenty o' ropes in
the cow-country. Whose with me?"</p>

<p>Two score voices yelled in savage assurance of their owners'
hearty cooperation.</p>

<p>"Then git your bronchs," cried the speaker, "an' we'll go after
him an' git him!"</p>

<p>Diana saw that the orator was Hal Colby. She turned to one of
the men who was remaining as the majority of the others hastened
after their ponies.</p>

<p>"What is it all about?" she asked. "What has happened?"</p>

<p>The man looked up at her, and as he recognized her, pulled off
his hat awkwardly. "Oh, it's you, Miss Henders! Well, you see, the
stage was held up ag'in today an' Mack Harber was kilt&mdash;it was
his first trip since he was wounded that time. It was the first
trip, too, since Bull quit guardin' the gold, an' a lot o' the
fellers has got it in their heads thet it's Bull as done it."</p>

<p>"'Tain't no sech thing!" cried a little old man, near-by,
"'tain't Bull."</p>

<p>The speaker was Wildcat Bob. "I don't like to think so neither,"
said the first man; "but it shore looks bad fer him&mdash;the
fellers is all het up. There ain't one in thet crowd but what would
lynch his gran-maw ef he had another drink, an' they sure hev had
plenty&mdash;Gum's ben settin' 'em up in there fer a coupla hours
on the house. Never did see Gum so plumb liberal."</p>

<p>"He's aimin' to get someone else to go after The Black Coyote,"
said Wildcat Bob, "or he wouldn't be so doggone liberal with his
rot-gut&mdash;he couldn't git up enough nerve ef he drunk a whole
distillery."</p>

<p>"You think they really intend to lynch Bull?" asked the
girl.</p>

<p>"They ain't no two ways about it, Miss," said the man she had
first accosted. "They're aimin' to do it an' I reckon they will.
You see they're pretty sore. Mack tried to put up a little fight
an' this Black Coyote feller bored him plumb between the eyes. Then
he takes the gold, cuts all the hosses loose from the stage an'
vamooses. Thet's why we didn't hear of it 'til just a bit ago,
cause they didn't have no way to git to town only hoofin' it."</p>

<p>Already the avenging mob was gathering. They came whooping,
reeling in their saddles. Not one of them, sober, would have gone
out after the ex-foreman of the Bar Y, but, drunk, they forgot
their fear of him, and Diana knew that they would carry out their
purpose.</p>

<p>They were going to lynch Bull! It seemed incredible, and yet,
could she blame them? Knowing him as she did she had herself half
admitted the truth of the rumor of his guilt before this, the
latest outrage, that seemed to fix the responsibility beyond
peradventure of a doubt. For the six weeks that Bull had guarded
the bullion there had been no holdup, and now on the very first
stage day after he had been relieved the depredations had been
renewed.</p>

<p>She recalled the fact that he had been seen with Gregorio on the
very afternoon of a previous holdup; she recalled the blood upon
his shirt that same day&mdash;the day that Mary Donovan had fired
upon the bandits; she thought of the bag of gold dust that he had
displayed at the bunk-house. There seemed no possible avenue of
escape from a belief in his guilt.</p>

<p>The yelling avengers were milling around in a circle in front of
Gum's Place, firing off their guns, cursing, shouting. The sheriff
appeared on the veranda and raised his hand for silence.</p>

<p>"Ah'm sheriff yere," he said, "an as an ahm of the law Ah cain't
permit yo-all to go fer to lynch nobody, but Ah can an' do invite
yo-all in to hev a drink on the house befo' yo go."</p>

<p>There was a wild shout of approval and a scramble for room at
the tie rail. Those who lost out rode their ponies into the saloon,
and as the last of them disappeared, Diana, who had lost sight of
Willie in the jostle and excitement of the past few minutes, turned
her pony about and rode back in the direction from which she had
come.</p>

<p>Just beyond the last house she turned abruptly to the
left&mdash;the Bar Y ranch lay to the right&mdash;urged Captain
into a lope and started off through the darkness toward the west.
Presently she struck a well-defined trail and then with a word and
a touch of her spurs she sent Captain into a run. Swiftly the wiry
animal sprang through the night while the beating of his mistress'
heart kept time to the rapid fall of his unshod hoofs.</p>

<p>What was she doing? Was she mad? A dozen times Diana Henders
repeated those questions to herself, but the only answer was a
monotonous cadence that beat upon her brain, reasonless, to the
accompaniment of Captain's flying hoofs:</p>

<p><i>They shall not kill him! They shall not kill him! They shall
not kill him!</i>
</p>

<p>Constantly she listened for sounds of the coming of the lynching
party, though she knew that she had sufficient start to outdistance
them completely, even had Captain not been the fleet and powerful
runner that he was. It was ten miles to the West Ranch from
Hendersville and the Captain made it in thirty minutes that
night.</p>

<p>Diana threw herself from the saddle at the gate and crawled
through the bars, leaving Captain on wide stretched feet and with
nose to ground blowing after his hard run, knowing that he would
not move from the spot for some time. She hastened to the darkened
cabin and pounded on the door.</p>

<p>"Bull!" she cried. "Bull!" but there was no answer. Then she
opened the door and entered, fumbling around for a table she found
it and matches, striking one. The cabin, a one room affair, was
empty. Her ride for nothing! Bull was away, but they would hide in
the brush and wait for him to come back and then they would shoot
him down in cold blood, and he would never have a chance for his
life. If she only knew where he had gone, she might ride out and
meet him; but she did not know.</p>

<p>Wait! There was one chance! If he was The Black Coyote he would
doubtless come in from the north or the northeast, for in the
latter direction lay Hell's Bend, the scene of his many
holdups.</p>

<p>But it wasn't Bull&mdash;it couldn't be Bull&mdash;Bull, of all
the men in the world, could never have robbed her, or killed her
messenger.</p>

<p>Slowly she returned to Captain, standing with heaving sides and
dilated nostrils. The animal staggered a bit as she mounted, but at
a touch of the rein he turned and walked out into the sage brush
toward the north. She rode for a quarter of a mile and then she
reined in her mount and called the man's name aloud.</p>

<p>There was no reply and she turned to the east and rode in that
direction for a while, now and then calling "Bull!" her voice
sounding strange and uncanny in her own ears. In the distance a
coyote yapped and wailed.</p>

<p>She turned and rode west to a point beyond the cabin and then
back again, establishing a beat where she might hope to intercept
the returning Bull before he reached the danger of the ambush. At
intervals she called his name aloud, and presently she halted
frequently to listen for the coming of the lynchers.</p>

<p>It was a matchless Arizona night. The myriad stars blazing in
the blue-black vault of infinite space cast their radiance softly
upon vale and height, relieving the darkness with a gentle
luminosity that rendered distant objects discernible in mass, if
not in form, and because of it Diana saw the black bulk of the
approaching horsemen while they were yet a considerable distance
away, and, seeing them, dared not call Bull's name aloud again.</p>

<p>The mob rode silently now&mdash;a grim and terrible shadow
creeping through the darkness to lay bloody hands upon its prey. A
quarter of a mile from the cabin it halted while its members
dismounted and, leaving a few to hold the horses, the balance crept
stealthily forward on foot.</p>

<p>Diana, too, had dismounted, knowing that she would be less
conspicuous thus, and was leading Captain over a circuitous trail
toward the north and east. The girl knelt and placed an ear to the
ground.</p>

<p>Faintly, as though at a great distance, she heard the rhythmic
pounding of a horse's hoofs. He was coming&mdash;loping through the
night, Bull was coming&mdash;all unconscious of what awaited him
there in the darkness. He was riding to his death. She hastened
forward a short distance and listened again. If the sounds should
be plainer now she would be sure that he was coming from the
northeast.</p>

<p>The self-appointed posse crept toward the cabin and according to
a general plan imparted to them by Colby, separated into two
sections and surrounded it, finally worming their way close in on
hands and knees, taking advantage of the cover of the sage to
shield them from the sight of the man they believed to be there,
then Colby arose and walked boldly to the door. Knocking, he called
Bull's name aloud. There was no response.</p>

<p>"Hey, Bull!" cried Colby again, in a friendly voice, "it's Hal."
Still no reply. Colby pushed the door open and entered. Of all the
motley crew that followed him he alone had the courage to do the
thing he was doing now. He struck a match and lighted a candle that
stood on the rude table, embedded in its own grease in the cover of
a baking powder can.</p>

<p>A brief survey of the interior showed him that it was
untenanted. He extinguished the light and returned to his party
where word was passed around that they were to remain quietly in
hiding where they were until the quarry came.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>In the meantime a lone horseman had thrown himself from a
half-spent pony in the Bar Y ranch yard and seeing a light in the
cook-house had burst in upon the astonished cook. "What in all
tarnation's the matter of ye, Wildcat Bob?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Where's Bull?" asked the little old man.</p>

<p>"Reckon he's over at the West Ranch&mdash;leastways there's were
he's supposed to be, why?"</p>

<p>"Warn't they a gang o' the boys jest here lookin' for him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>A burst of lurid profanity filled the room as Wildcat Bob
explained just how he felt and what he thought of himself.</p>

<p>"They set out to lynch Bull," he explained finally, "an' I
supposin' o' course thet he was here got away ahead o' 'em, an'
now, ding-bust my ornery ol' carcass, like as not they already got
him over at the West Ranch. Where's the rest o' the boys? Where's
Texas Pete? You don't reckon thet critter's with Colby, do
you?"</p>

<p>"Not by a long shot," replied the cook. "He'd stick up fer Bull
ef he massacreed the whole durn county. So'd Shorty an' Idaho, but
they ain't none o' 'em here&mdash;they's all down to Johnson's to a
dance."</p>

<p>"Well," said Wildcat Bob, "I done my best, which same ain't no
good. Ef I hed a hoss instead o' a hunk o' coyote fodder I'd try to
git to the West Ranch in time, but I reckon they ain't no chanct
now. Howsumever I'll do the best I kin. So-long!" and he was
gone.</p>

<p>A half hour later his horse fell dead a mile north of
Hendersville while his rider was taking a short cut straight across
country for the West Ranch. It was a warm and lurid Wildcat Bob who
plodded through the dust of Hendersville's lone thoroughfare and
stopped at the veranda of The Donovan House some time later to be
accosted by one of a group gathered there in semi-silent
expectancy.</p>

<p>"The saints be praised!" exclaimed Mary Donovan. "Is it a
banchee or is it not?"</p>

<p>"It's worse," said Bill Gatlin, the stage driver; "it's Wildcat
Bob&mdash;walkin'."</p>

<p>"Did they git the poor b'y?" demanded Mary, whereat the little
old gentleman burst forth anew with such a weird variety of oaths
that Mr. Jefferson Wainright, Jr., could feel the hot flush that
mounted to his ears fairly scorching his skin.</p>

<p>"Ef I ever gits a-hold o' the blankety, blank, blank thet loaned
me that blankety, blank, blank ewe-necked, ring-boned, spavined
excuse fer a cayuse I'll cut his heart out," announced Wildcat Bob
in a high falsetto.</p>

<p>Finally Mary Donovan inveigled the facts from him. "Ye done
well, Bob, thet ye did," she assured him. "Shure an' how was yese
to know thet he wasn't at the home ranch."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think you'd care if they did hang a bandit and
murderer," declared Mr. Jefferson Wainright, Jr.</p>

<p>"Who in hell told you to think, you durn dude?" screamed Wildcat
Bob, reaching for his gun.</p>

<p>Mr. Wainright sought the greater safety of the office, tipping
over his chair and almost upsetting Mary Donovan in his haste.
"Don't shoot!" he cried. "Don't shoot! I meant no offense."</p>

<p>Wildcat Bob would have followed him within, but Mary Donovan
caught him around the waist and pushed him into a chair. "Be ca'm,
Robert," she soothed him.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>As Diana arose to her feet after listening close to the ground
for the second time she was assured by the increased loudness of
the sounds she had heard that the lone rider was rapidly
approaching from the northeast and in that direction she again led
Captain, intending to mount once more as soon as she had reached
what she considered a safe distance from the cabin and the hidden
watchers encircling it. She had forged ahead for about five minutes
when the way dipped into a shallow swale in which the sage brush
grew to greater size.</p>

<p>Here would be a good place to remount, and with this intention
crystallized she wound downward among the scattered brush toward
the bottom, when, rounding a particularly high bush, she came
suddenly face to face with a man leading a horse.</p>

<p>"Stick 'em up!" whispered the man in a low voice, presenting an
evil looking six-gun at the pit of her stomach.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bull!" she cried in low tones, for she would have known his
voice among thousands.</p>

<p>"You?" he cried. "My gawd, Miss, what are you doin' here?"</p>

<p>"They have come to lynch you, Bull," she told him. "There are
forty or fifty of them lying in the brush around your cabin now.
They say that you held up the stage and killed Mack Harber
today."</p>

<p>"And <i>you</i> came to warn me?" His voice sounded far away, as
though, groping for a truth he could not grasp, he spoke half to
himself.</p>

<p>"You must go away, Bull," she told him. "You must leave the
country."</p>

<p>He paid no attention to her words. "I seen a light flash fer a
minute in the shack," he said, "an' so I reckoned I'd hev a look
around before I come too close. Thet was why I was walkin' when I
hearn you. I was just a-goin' to leave Blazes here an' go ahead an'
scout aroun' a bit. Mount up now an' I'll take you home."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "you get away. I can get home all right&mdash;I
only have to go to town. I'm stopping at Mary's tonight."</p>

<p>"I'll ride with you," he insisted.</p>

<p>She knew him well enough to know that he would never let her
ride to town alone through the night and so she mounted as he did
and together they followed the swale which ran in the general
direction of Hendersville.</p>

<p>"You say you're stoppin' at Mary's?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Just for tonight. I'm taking the stage for Aldea in the
morning. I'm going to Kansas City to consult a lawyer. They are
trying to take the property away from me, Bull," and then she told
him all that had transpired since yesterday.</p>

<p>"You don't need a lawyer, Miss," he told her. "What you need is
a two-gun man, only you don't <i>need</i> him, 'cause you got one
already. You go back to the ranch an' come mornin' there won't be
airy dude or dudess to try to put their brand on nothin' thet
belongs to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bull, don't you understand that you mustn't do anything
like that?" she cried. "It would only make things worse than they
are now. Wong wanted to poison them."</p>

<p>"Good ol' Wong!" interjected Bull.</p>

<p>"But we can't make murderers of ourselves just because they are
wicked."</p>

<p>"It ain't murder to kill a rattlesnake," he reminded her.</p>

<p>"But promise me that you won't," she urged.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't do nothin' you didn't want done, Miss," he said.</p>

<p>They were nearing town now and could see the lights plainly,
shining through the windows and doorways. "You'd better go now,
Bull," she said.</p>

<p>"Not 'til I get you in town safe," he replied.</p>

<p>"But I'm safe now&mdash;it is only a little way, and I'm afraid
they might get you if you came in."</p>

<p>"Shucks, they won't git me now thet I know they're after me," he
replied. "Say, Miss," he exclaimed suddenly, "you ain't asked me ef
it was me kilt Mack."</p>

<p>She drew herself up proudly. "I'll never ask you, Bull," she
said.</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't hev come out to warn me ef you'd thought it,"
he suggested.</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, and then: "Yes, I would, Bull," she
said in a very little voice.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "As I told Pete, ef I had done it or
ef I hadn't done it, I'd say I hadn't, so what's the use o' wastin'
breath; but I shore appreciates what you've done, Miss."</p>

<p>"And you will go away?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No'm, I'll stay here. I reckon you need me, Miss, from what
you've told me, so I'll hang around a spell. I'll ride over to the
ranch o' nights now an' then. Ef you happen to hear a meadow-lark
settin' up late after dark you'll know it's me."</p>

<p>"But I'm afraid they'll get you, Bull, if you stay in the
country. They're terribly angry," she warned him.</p>

<p>"They won't be so keen to find me after they're sobered up a
bit," he said, with a smile. "Colby's the only one thet's got the
nerve to go agin' guns single-handed."</p>

<p>"I don't see why he hates you so," she said. "I used to think
that he liked you."</p>

<p>"Then all I got to say, Miss, is thet you must be plumb blind,"
said Bull.</p>

<p>Diana was evidently not so blind as he thought her, for she
flushed deliciously.</p>

<p>"Now you must turn back," she said. They were almost in
town.</p>

<p>"I will, because they mustn't see you ridin' in with me," he
replied.</p>

<p>She reined in her horse and held out her hand to him. "Good-bye,
Bull," she said.</p>

<p>He took her slim hand in his and pressed it strongly.
"Good-bye&mdash;Diana!" said Bull.</p>

<p>She spoke to Captain and moved off toward the little town and
the man sat there in the darkness watching her retreating form
until it was hidden behind a corner of The Donovan House.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14" name="ch14">XIV. &mdash; BULL SEES COLBY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BULL turned Blazes' head toward the northeast and
rode off slowly in the direction of Coyote Canyon near the head of
which there was a wild and almost inaccessible country just east of
Hell's Bend Pass. There was water there and game for himself, with
year round pasture for Blazes.</p>

<p>As he rode he hummed a gay little air, quite unlike the grim,
taciturn Bull that his acquaintances knew, for Bull was
happy&mdash;happier than he had been for months.</p>

<p>"An' to think," he mused, "thet she rode out there all alone to
warn me. An' once she said to me, 'Bull,' says she, 'I don't love
any man, Bull, thet way; but if ever I do he'll know it without my
tellin' him. I'll do something thet will prove it&mdash;a girl
always does.'</p>

<p>"Thet's what she says&mdash;them's her very words. I ain't never
fergot 'em an' I ain't never goin' to&mdash;even ef I don't believe
it. It was just her good heart that sent her out to warn
me&mdash;she'd a-done as much fer any of the boys."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>When Diana reined in before those assembled on the veranda of
The Donovan House she was greeted by a gasp of astonishment from
Mary Donovan.</p>

<p>"Diana Henders, child!" she exclaimed. "What are ye doin' here
this time o' night? Sure an' I thought ye had gone back to the
ranch, after hearin' ye was in town airlier in the av'nin'."</p>

<p>Diana dismounted without making any reply and tied Captain to
the rail in front of the hotel. As she mounted the steps to the
veranda the younger Wainright rose, politely. Corson and the elder
Wainright nodded, the latter grunting gruffly. Lillian Manill
pretended that she did not see her.</p>

<p>"I am going to stop here tonight, Mrs. Donovan," said Diana to
the proprietress, "that is if you have room for me."</p>

<p>"An' if I didn't I'd be after makin' it," replied the
latter.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you'd mind putting Captain up for me, Bob," said
Diana, turning to the Wildcat, and as the old man stepped from the
veranda to comply with her request, Diana turned and entered the
office, followed by Mary Donovan.</p>

<p>"May I have a cup of tea, Mrs. Donovan?" asked the girl. "I feel
all fagged out. This evening has been like a terrible
nightmare."</p>

<p>"You mane about poor Bull?" asked Mary.</p>

<p>Diana nodded.</p>

<p>"They ain't back yit," said Mary; "but I suppose they got him,
bad 'cess to 'em."</p>

<p>Diana came close to the older woman and whispered. "They didn't
get him. I just saw him&mdash;he brought me to the edge of
town."</p>

<p>"Now, the Lord be praised for that!" ejaculated Mary Donovan,
"for shure an' if it's guilty he is I'll not be after belavin' it
at all, at all."</p>

<p>"It looks pretty bad for him, Mrs. Donovan," said Diana, "but
even so I can't believe it of him either&mdash;I won't believe
it."</p>

<p>"An' no more don't yese, darlin'," advised Mary Donovan, "an'
now make yersilf comfortable an' I'll have ye a cup o' tay in no
time."</p>

<p>As her hostess left the sitting room by one doorway, Jefferson
Wainright, Jr., appeared in the other which opened from the office,
his hat in his hand.</p>

<p>"May I have just a word with you, Miss Henders?" he asked.</p>

<p>The girl nodded her assent, though none too cordially, and
Wainright entered the little sitting room.</p>

<p>"I can't begin to tell you, Miss Henders," he commenced, after
clearing his throat, "how badly I feel over this matter that Mr.
Corson has explained to us. There isn't any question, of course,
about the unfairness and injustice of it; but the fact remains that
the law is the law, and I don't see how you are going to get around
it by fighting them."</p>

<p>"It is a matter, Mr. Wainright, that I do not care to discuss
with you," said Diana, rising.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Miss Henders," he begged. "That wasn't exactly
what I wanted to discuss with you, though it has a bearing on it.
There is a way out for you and it was that I wanted to talk over.
Your father was a wealthy man&mdash;you have been accustomed to
everything that money could buy in this country. To drop from
affluence to penury in a single day is going to be mighty hard for
you, and it is that I want to save you from."</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you, I am sure," she told him, "but I cannot
see how you, of all people, can help me, for your own father is a
party to this whole transaction."</p>

<p>"I think you are a bit hard on him," he said. "You surely cannot
blame him for wanting to drive as good a bargain as
possible&mdash;he is, first and last, a business man."</p>

<p>Diana only shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Now, as I said," continued Mr. Wainright, "there is a way for
you to continue to have, not only the luxuries you have been
accustomed to, but many more, and at the same time to retain the
Bar Y Ranch."</p>

<p>She looked up at him questioningly. "Yes!" she said, "and
how?"</p>

<p>"By marrying me, Miss Henders. You know I love you. You know
there is nothing I would not do for you. There is no sacrifice that
I would not willingly and gladly make for you. I would die for you,
dear girl, and thank God for the chance."</p>

<p>Diana Henders' lip curled in scorn. "It seems to me that I heard
you make that very assertion once before, Mr. Wainright, and in
those self-same words&mdash;the night before you ran away, like the
coward you are, and left us at the mercy of the Apaches.</p>

<p>"If you had half the courage that you have effrontery, the lion
would appear a mouse by comparison. Please, never mention the
subject to me again, nor is there any reason why you should ever
address me upon any subject. Good night!"</p>

<p>"You'll regret this," he cried as he was leaving the room. "You
see if you don't. You might have had one friend, and a good one, on
your side&mdash;now you haven't any. We'll strip you to the last
cent for this, and then you'll marry some ignorant, unwashed
cow-puncher and raise brats in a tumbledown shack for the rest of
your life&mdash;that's what you'll do!"</p>

<p>"An do yuh know what you'll do?" demanded a squeaky voice behind
him.</p>

<p>Jefferson Wainright, Jr., turned to see Wildcat Bob glaring at
him from the center of the office floor. The young man turned a
sickly hue and glanced hurriedly for an avenue of escape, but the
Wildcat was between him and the outer doorway and was reaching for
one of his terrible guns.</p>

<p>With a half-stifled cry Wainright sprang into the sitting room
and ran to Diana. Seizing her he whirled the girl about so that she
was between him and the Wildcat's weapon.</p>

<p>"My God, Miss Henders, don't let him shoot me! I'm
unarmed&mdash;it would be murder. Save me! Save me!"</p>

<p>His screams brought his father, Corson, Lillian Manill and Mary
Donovan to the room, where they saw the younger Wainright kneeling
in abject terror behind Diana's skirts.</p>

<p>"What's the meanin' of all this?" yelled the elder
Wainright.</p>

<p>"Your son insulted me&mdash;he asked me to marry him," said
Diana. "Let him go, Bob," she directed the Wildcat.</p>

<p>"Gosh-a-mighty, Miss!" exclaimed the old man in an aggrieved
tone, "yuh don't mean it, do yuh? Why, I just ben honin' fer a
chanct to clean up this here whole bunch o' tin-horns an' now that
I got an excuse it don't seem right to let it pass. By cracky, it
ain't right! 'Tain't moral, that's what it ain't!"</p>

<p>"Please, Bob&mdash;I've got trouble enough&mdash;let him
go."</p>

<p>Slowly Wildcat Bob returned his gun to its holster, shaking his
head mournfully, and Jefferson Wainright, Jr., arose and sneaked
out of the room. As his party returned to the veranda the young
man's father was growling and spluttering in an undertone, but
Wildcat Bob caught the words "law" and "sheriff."</p>

<p>"What's thet?" he demanded in his high falsetto.</p>

<p>The elder Wainright cringed and stepped rapidly through the
doorway. "Nothin'," he assured the Wildcat. "I didn't calc'late to
say nothin' at all."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>It was almost morning when the weary and now sobered members of
the necktie party returned to town. Gum Smith and several others,
among whom was Wildcat Bob, met them in the street.</p>

<p>"Git him?" demanded the sheriff.</p>

<p>"No," replied Colby, "an' I don't savvy it neither&mdash;someone
must o' put him wise; but I got some evidence," and he drew a worn
leather pouch from his shirt. "Here's one o' the bullion bags that
was took from the stage yesterday&mdash;I found it under his
blankets. He may o' ben there an' saw us comin', but thet ain't
likely 'cause we snuk up mighty keerful&mdash;someone must o' put
him wise."</p>

<p>"Ah wondeh who-all it could o' ben," wondered Gum Smith.</p>

<p>As the crowd was dispersing Wildcat Bob caught sight of Willie
among them.</p>

<p>"Hey, thar, you!" he called. "What was you doin' with thet
bunch&mdash;I thought you claimed to be a friend o' Bull's."</p>

<p>"Course I am," maintained Willie, stoutly; "but I hain't never
seed no one hanged."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>A few hours later Diana Henders left on the stage for Aldea and
after she had departed Corson and Lillian Manill drove back to the
ranch, taking the Wainrights with them, while Hal Colby trotted
along beside them. He had not seen Diana before she left, nor had
he made any effort to do so.</p>

<p>"We might save a right smart o' trouble if we could get
everything fixed up before she gets back, Corson," the elder
Wainright was saying.</p>

<p>"The government patent to the land as well as Manill's will are
in the New York office," replied Corson. "I've sent for them. They
ought to be along now any time. I rather expected them on
yesterday's stage&mdash;they certainly must come in on the next and
I imagine she won't get back for a week at least&mdash;that will
give us three days. Then we'll all go to Aldea, have the papers
drawn up there, you turn the money over to us and Miss Manill and I
can get away for New York on the train that night&mdash;I've had
all of this damn country I want."</p>

<p>Hal Colby, fortunately for his peace of mind, did not overhear
the conversation. It outlined an entirely different plan from that
which Lillian Manill had explained to him only the preceding
day&mdash;a plan which included a hasty wedding and a long
honeymoon, during which the Bar Y foreman would taste the sweets of
world travel in company with a charming and affectionate bride.</p>

<p>"You're goin' to leave me here to run all the risk, eh?"
demanded Wainright, Sr.</p>

<p>"Oh, there's no risk now that that Bull fellow is out of the
way," Corson assured him.</p>

<p>"I wish I was sure he was out o' the way," said Wainright,
dubiously. "I don't like that fellow a little bit."</p>

<p>"He'll never show up again," said Corson, confidently, "and
anyway, just as soon as I get to New York I'll look up a good man
to represent me here, and I'm going to pick the toughest one I can
find in New York, too."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm buyin' a heap o' trouble with that one-third
interest o' mine," said Wainright, scratching his head.</p>

<p>"But look what you're going to get out of it," Corson reminded
him. "I'll bet we take a million out of that mine in the next
year."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Back at the ranch Colby was met by a scowling trio&mdash;Texas
Pete, Shorty and Idaho. "Where's Bull?" demanded Texas.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" replied Colby, gruffly. "When was I elected
his nurse-girl?"</p>

<p>"You went out after him with a bunch o' drunken short-horns last
night," accused Shorty. "You know whether you got him or not."</p>

<p>"They didn't git him," said Colby, shortly.</p>

<p>"It's a damn good thing fer you, Colby, thet they didn't," said
Texas Pete, "an' another thing&mdash;we wants our time. We ain't
a-aimin' to work under no pole-cat no more."</p>

<p>"I reckon we kin git along without you," retorted Colby,
ignoring the insult. "You kin come back in a week fer your
checks&mdash;the boss ain't here."</p>

<p>"Then we'll stay 'til she is," said Pete.</p>

<p>"Suit yerselves," replied Colby, as he turned and walked
away.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The routine of the ranch moved in its accustomed grooves as the
days passed, though there was noticeably absent the spirit of
good-fellowship that marks the daily life of a well-ordered cow
outfit. A little coterie, headed by Texas Pete, herded by itself,
in the vernacular of the West, while the remaining punchers grouped
themselves about the foreman.</p>

<p>Mealtimes, ordinarily noisy with rough but good-natured
badinage, had become silent moments to be gotten through with as
rapidly as possible. There was a decorous restraint that was far
too decorous, among these rough men, to augur aught of good. It
revealed rather than veiled the proximity of open hostilities.</p>

<p>There was one topic of conversation that was eschewed
particularly. It would have been the steel to the flint of
prejudice which lay embedded in the powder of partisanship. Bull's
name was never mentioned when the factions were together.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The stage came again to Hendersville on the third day after
Diana's departure. It brought mail for the ranch, but the vaquero
who had been sent from the Bar Y for it tarried longer at <i>Gum's
Place&mdash;Liquors and Cigars</i>&mdash;than he had intended, with
the result that it was well after supper and quite dark before he
delivered it to the office.</p>

<p>As he approached the yellow rectangle of the open office door it
may have been the light shining in his eyes that prevented him
seeing the figure of a man beneath the darkness of the cottonwoods
that surround the house, or the horse, standing as silently as its
master, fifty feet away&mdash;a blazed face chestnut with two white
hind feet.</p>

<p>The vaquero entered the office, where Corson was sitting in
conversation with the two Wainrights, and laid the mail upon the
table. The New Yorker picked it up and ran through it. There was a
bulky letter addressed to him, which he opened.</p>

<p>"Here's what we've been waiting for," he said, glancing quickly
through two enclosures and laying them aside to peruse the
accompanying letter.</p>

<p>The man beneath the shadows of the cottonwoods moved closer to
the open office doorway, keeping well out of the yellow shaft of
lamp-light.</p>

<p>Bull had not come down to the Bar Y from his hiding place in
Coyote Canyon for the purpose of spying upon Corson. He had hoped
against hope that Diana might return on the day's stage, for he
wanted a word with her. He knew that she could not have made the
trip to Kansas City and return in so short a time, but then she
might have changed her mind at Aldea and given up the trip. It was
on this chance that he had come down out of the mountains
tonight.</p>

<p>Diana had not returned&mdash;he had convinced himself of
this&mdash;but still he tarried. These were her enemies. It could
do no harm to keep an eye on them. He did not like the
proprietorial airs of Corson, sitting there in "the old man's" easy
chair, and as for the Wainrights, they too seemed much more at home
than suited Bull. His hand caressed the butt of a six-gun
affectionately.</p>

<p>"Hell!" exclaimed Corson, explosively. "The addle-brained
idiot!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" inquired the elder Wainright.</p>

<p>Corson was in the midst of the letter. He shook it violently and
angrily in lieu of anything more closely representative of its
writer.</p>

<p>"The chump has dug up some papers that we don't want&mdash;we
don't want 'em in Arizona at all. He's a new man. I thought he had
good sense and discretion, but he hasn't either. He's sendin' 'em
out here by registered mail.</p>

<p>"If anything happens to them, if they fall into the Henders
girl's hands our goose is cooked. He says they 'put a new aspect on
the situation' and that 'he knows I'll be delighted to have them.'
They surely will put a new aspect on the situation, but I don't
want 'em&mdash;not here.</p>

<p>"If I'd had any sense I'd have destroyed them before I left New
York; but who'd have thought that they weren't safe right in my own
office. I'd be delighted to have him&mdash;by the neck. Lord!
suppose they're lost now! They should have been here with this
other mail."</p>

<p>"If it's registered stuff it may have been delayed just enough
to miss the stage at Aldea by one train," suggested Wainright. "If
that is the case it'll be along by the next stage."</p>

<p>"What were the papers?" demanded the elder Wainright,
suspiciously.</p>

<p>Corson hesitated. He realized that he had been surprised by his
anger into saying too much.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I overestimate their value," he said. "They might not
do any harm after all."</p>

<p>"What were they?" insisted Mr. Wainright.</p>

<p>"Oh, they were reports that show the tremendous value of the new
vein in the mine," lied Corson, glibly.</p>

<p>Wainright sank back in his chair with a sigh of relief. "Oh, if
that's all they was we don't need to worry none about them," he
said. "We as good as got the place now. We'll drive over to Aldea
tomorrer and fix things up, eh?"</p>

<p>"I think I'll wait for the next mail," said Corson. "Those
reports might not do any harm, but I'd rather be here when they
come and see that no one else gets hold of them."</p>

<p>"Mebby you're right," assented Wainright. He arose, yawning, and
stretched. "I calc'late to go to bed," he said.</p>

<p>"I think I'll do the same," said his son. "I hope Miss Manill is
feeling better by morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll be all right," said Corson. "Just a little headache.
Good night! I'm coming along too."</p>

<p>They lighted lamps, blew out the one in the office, and departed
for their rooms. The man in the shadows turned slowly toward his
horse, but he had taken only a few steps when he halted
listening.</p>

<p>Some one was approaching. He glanced through the darkness in the
direction of the sounds which came out of the night along the
pathway from the bunk-house. Stepping quickly behind the bole of a
large tree, Bull waited in silence. Presently he saw dimly the
figure of a man and as it came nearer the star-light revealed its
identity.</p>

<p>It was Colby. Like himself, Colby waited in the shadows of the
trees&mdash;waited silently, watching the dead black of the office
windows. The silence was tangible, it was so absolutely dominant,
reigning supreme in a world of darkness. Bull wondered that the
other did not hear his breathing. He marvelled at the quietness of
Blazes&mdash;even the roller in his bit lay silent. But it could
not last much longer&mdash;the horse was sure to move in a moment
and Colby would investigate. The result was a foregone conclusion.
There would be shooting.</p>

<p>Bull did not want to shoot Colby&mdash;not now. There were two
reasons. One however would have been enough&mdash;that Diana
Henders was thinking of marrying this man.</p>

<p>And then the silence was broken. Very slightly only was it
broken. A suspicion of a sound came from the interior of the house,
and following it a dim light wavering mysteriously upon the office
walls, growing steadily brighter until the room was suddenly
illuminated.</p>

<p>From where he now stood Bull could not see the interior of the
office, but he knew that some one carrying a lamp had come down the
stairway, along the hall and entered the office. Then he saw Colby
move forward and step lightly to the veranda and an instant later
the office door swung open, revealing Lillian Manill in diaphanous
negligee.</p>

<p>Bull saw Colby seize the girl, strain her to him and cover her
lips with kisses. Then the girl drew her lover into the room and
closed the door.</p>

<p>With a grimace of disgust Bull walked to Blazes, mounted him and
rode slowly away. Now there was only one reason why he could not
kill Colby yet.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15" name="ch15">XV. &mdash; "NOW, GO!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT was Wednesday again. Four horses, sweat
streaked, toiled laboriously to drag the heavy coach up the north
side of Hell's Bend Pass. It was a tough pull even with a light
load&mdash;one that really demanded six horses and would have had
six in the old days&mdash;and today the load was light. There was
but a single passenger. She sat on the driver's box with Bill
Gatlin with whom she was in earnest discussion.</p>

<p>"I tell you I don't believe he did it," she was saying. "I'll
never believe that he did it, and I'm mighty glad that he got
away."</p>

<p>Gatlin shook his head. "There ain't no one got a better right to
say that than you has, Miss," he said, "fer 'twas your gold as was
stole, an' your messenger as was shot up; but nevertheless an'
how-sum-ever I got my own private opinion what I'm keepin' to
myself thet it was Bull all right as done it."</p>

<p>"I'd just like to see this Black Coyote once," said the girl.
"<i>I'd</i> know if it was Bull or not."</p>

<p>"They ain't no chanct today, Miss," Gatlin told her. "They ain't
no gold shipment today, unless I'm mighty mistook."</p>

<p>"Don't he ever make a mistake?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Never hain't yet, Miss."</p>

<p>Diana relapsed into silence, her thoughts reverting to her
interview with the Kansas City attorney. He had not held out very
roseate hopes. By means of litigation&mdash;long and
expensive&mdash;she might, after a number of years, get a small
portion of her father's share of the business. She had better take
a cash settlement, if she could get one, he thought. A hundred and
twenty-five thousand dollars in the hand would be much better, in
his opinion, than a long-drawn-out law suit that could be nothing
better than an expensive gamble with the odds against her.</p>

<p>"But I won't! I won't! I won't be robbed," she ejaculated
beneath her breath.</p>

<p>"How's that, Miss?" inquired Bill Gatlin. "Was you speakin' to
me?"</p>

<p>"I must have been thinking aloud," she said, smiling. "What a
long pull this is, Bill!"</p>

<p>"We're nigh to the summit," he replied, pulling in his team to
breathe them for a moment.</p>

<p>On the shoulder of Wagon Mountain overlooking the south stretch
of Hell's Bend Pass road two men sat their horses amidst a clump of
chaparral that effectually hid them from the road, though they
could see nearly its entire length from the summit to the gap at
the bottom. Presently one of them spoke.</p>

<p>"Here it comes," he said. He was a swarthy, powerfully built
Mexican, somewhere in his thirties, Gregorio, the bandit.</p>

<p>His companion was adjusting a black silk handkerchief across his
face in such a way as to entirely hide his features. There were two
small holes cut in the handkerchief opposite its wearer's eyes
which, through them, were fixed upon the stage as it topped the
pass and started downward upon its rapid and careening descent
toward the gap and Hendersville.</p>

<p>"Come," said Gregorio, and wheeled his horse about.</p>

<p>His companion's mount moved suddenly before the handkerchief was
finally adjusted and as the man reached for his reins the thing
fell away from his face, revealing it. It was Bull.</p>

<p>A second attempt was more successful and then the men rode down
the sheer mountain-side, keeping just below the crest upon the
south side and hidden from the view of the driver and the passenger
upon the stage. Their horses moved with extreme care and without
haste, for the way was precarious, occasionally requiring that the
horses sit upon their haunches and slide for short distances until
they found footing again further down. The riders seemed
unperturbed either by the dangers of the descent or fear of being
late at their rendezvous, suggesting habitude with the work in
hand. In a dense growth of scrub just above the gap they tied their
horses, continuing on foot.</p>

<p>The stage lumbered downward, rocking from side to side. Diana
held tight and said nothing. She had ridden with Bill Gatlin
before, many times. He glanced at her out of the corner of an
eye.</p>

<p>"This ain't nothin'," he said, as though in answer to a
remonstrance on her part. Diana knew what was coming. She had heard
it many times. "No, siree," continued Bill, "this ain't nothin'.
Why, you'd orter ben with me one night when I was on the Denver run
in the ol' days, afore the railroads spiled the country. The trail
crossed plumb over the top of a mountain. 'Twarn't no road.
'Twarn't nothin' but a trail. I hed the ol' stage plumb full an'
passengers a-hangin' onto the boot. It was pitch dark&mdash;the
doggonest, darkest night I ever see. Couldn't see airy wheel-horse.
Only ways I knowed I hed any horses was when their shoes struck
fire on the stony parts o' the road. Jest afore we struck the top
o' the mountain they was the worst cloud-bust I ever did see. Them
horses had to swim the last hundred rods to the top o' thet
mountain, an' the ol' stage was bobbin' aroun' so on the waves thet
eight of the passengers got sea-sick.</p>

<p>"But thet wa'n't nothin'. When we come to the top I found the
road'd ben all washed away. They wa'n't no more road'n a
jack-rabbit; but I was a-carryin' the mail, jest like I be now an'
I hed to git through. It was a high mountain an' tolably steep, but
not no trees, so I see there wa'n't only one thing to do an' thet
was to go down road or no road, so right there on the top o' thet
mountain I threw the leather into 'em an' headed 'em fer Denver an'
down we goes faster'n ever I rid afore or since, the wheelers
a-jumpin' to keep out o' the way o' the stage an' the leaders a
jumpin' to keep out o' the way o' the wheelers.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, we was a-goin' so fast thet the fust thing I knowed
the friction hed melted the nut offen the nigh front wheel an' away
went thet wheel hell-bent-fer-election down the mountain, but it
couldn't keep up with the stage an' purty soon it was left behind,
but the stage was a-goin' so fast thet it never missed thet wheel
at all. An' purty soon off came the off rear wheel, an' thet wheel
couldn't keep up, though I could see it was doin' its best outen
the corner o' my eye.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, 'twa'n't long afore tother hind wheel come off, but
we was goin' about twict as fast now as when the fust wheel come
off an' that ol' stage jest skimmed along on one wheel a dinged
sight smoother an' it ever done on four. When we were about to the
bottom off come the last wheel an' then thinks I fer sure we gotta
quit an' we ain't to Denver yit, but we'd got so much mo-mentum by
this time thet the last wheel didn't make no more difference then
the others.</p>

<p>"Them horses jest drug thet stage out behind them like a comet
does its tail an' on we went streakin' down thet mountain an' five
mile out onto the flat afore the stage hit the ground an' then, o'
course, we hed to stop. It was too bad. I tell you I felt plumb
sore. I hadn't never ben off schedule sence I took the run.</p>

<p>"Then, all of a suddint, says one o' the passengers, 'Look back
yender, Bill,' says he. 'Look what's comin'!' An' I looked an'
there come them four wheels a-tearin' across the flat straight fer
us. Well, to make a long story short, they peters out right beside
the stage an' with the help o' the passengers an' some extra nuts
we got 'em back on where they belonged an' pulled into Denver two
hours ahead o' time. But I tell you, Miss, thet was some ride. I'd
hate to hev to take it again. Why<sup>___</sup>"</p>

<p>"Hands up! Put 'em up!"</p>

<p>The stage had slowed down for the rough road through the gap,
when two men with muffled faces stepped before the leaders,
covering the driver and his lone passenger with wicked looking
six-guns.</p>

<p>Diana Henders sat as one turned to stone, her eyes fixed upon
the tall, fine figure of the leading highwayman. A little gust of
wind moved the handkerchief that covered his face so that she saw,
or she thought that she saw, a scar upon the square chin. She was
not afraid. It was not fear&mdash;physical fear that held her
motionless&mdash;it was worse than that. It was the paralyzing
terror of the heart and soul. Was it Bull? Could it be Bull?</p>

<p>But, dear God, could she be mistaken in the familiar lines of
that figure&mdash;every movement, every gesture proclaimed the
numbing truth? He had not spoken. She was glad of that, for she
wanted something upon which to hang a doubt. The second man had
given the brief commands. That he was Gregorio she had no
doubt.</p>

<p>"Throw down the mail pouch," he commanded, and Bill Gatlin threw
it down.</p>

<p>The taller man took it and went to the rear of the stage, out of
sight. Five minutes later Gregorio commanded them to drive on. That
was all. The thing had not consumed six minutes, but in that brief
time the structure of Diana's life had been shaken to its
foundations. A new, a terrible truth had engulfed her&mdash;a truth
that should have up-borne her upon a wave of exaltation and
happiness now dragged her down into the vortex of a whirlpool of
self-loathing and misery.</p>

<p>They rode on in silence for a few minutes, Bill Gatlin cracking
his long whip above the ears of the leaders, galloping smoothly
over a comparatively level road.</p>

<p>"Doggone!" he said presently. "It's gettin' too almighty reg'lar
to suit me, though I reckon as how I mought git lonesome if I
wasn't held up oncet in a while; but you hed your wish,
Miss&mdash;you got to see The Black Coyote, all right, and now what
do you think? Is it or isn't it Bull?"</p>

<p>Diana Henders bit her lip. "Of course it was not Bull," she
said.</p>

<p>"Looked powerful like him to me," said Gatlin.</p>

<p>As they drew up in front of The Donovan House the usual idlers
came forth to learn what new element this, their sole link to
civilization, had infused into their midst. They greeted Diana none
the less cordially because she was the only passenger and the stage
had brought no new interest to Hendersville.</p>

<p>"Held up agin," announced Bill. "Some on you better go an' tell
Gum&mdash;he might want to deputize some one."</p>

<p>Immediately the crowd was interested. They asked many
questions.</p>

<p>"They wa'n't much to it," said Bill Gatlin. "Bein' as how they
wa'n't no gold he took the mail. I reckon if you was lookin' fer
any letters you won't git them."</p>

<p>A man from the Bar Y spoke up. "Thet New York feller up to the
ranch was lookin' fer a important piece o' mail," he said. "He sent
me down special to git it."</p>

<p>"Hey, what's this?" demanded another, peering into the interior
of the coach. "Here's yer mail bag, Bill, a-lyin' right in here."
He dragged it out and exhibited to the others.</p>

<p>"They's somethin' wrong with it&mdash;it's ben cut open," said
another, pointing to a slit in the leather. Then the postmaster
came up and rescued the sack. The crowd followed him to the general
store in which the post-office was conducted. Here the postmaster,
assisted by the crowd, went through the contents of the sack.</p>

<p>"Course I cain't tell what's missin'," he said, "only they ain't
no registered letter fer Mr. Corson."</p>

<p>Diana Henders had gone immediately into The Donovan House as
quickly as she could clamber from the stage after it had come to a
stop, and Mary Donovan had taken her into the privacy of her
sitting room for the cup "o' tay" that Diana had been looking
forward to for the past couple of hours. Here she told the motherly
Irish woman the details of her trip to Kansas City and the quandary
she was in as to what procedure to follow in her future dealings
with Corson.</p>

<p>"If I had anything to fight with, I'd fight," she exclaimed;
"but I'm all alone&mdash;even the law seems to be on their side,
against justice."</p>

<p>"Shure, an' it's not all alone ye are," Mary Donovan assured
her. "What wid all the friends ye have that would fight fer ye at
the drop o' the hat. Faith, they'd run thim tin-horns out o' the
country, an' ye give the word."</p>

<p>"I know," assented the girl, "and I appreciate what the boys
would do for me, but it can't be done that way. Dad always stood
for law and order and it wouldn't do for me to sponsor illegal
methods."</p>

<p>"Ye've got to fight the divil wid fire," said Mary.</p>

<p>Diana made no reply. She sat sipping her tea, her expression one
of troubled sadness, but she was not thinking of those who would
take her property from her nor of their unfair methods. Mary
Donovan was moving about the room tidying up.</p>

<p>Diana set her empty cup upon the rickety center table which
supported an oil lamp, a bible, a red plush photograph album and a
gilded conch shell, and sighed. Mrs. Donovan glanced at her out of
the corner of an eye and guessed shrewdly that there was something
more than New Yorkers troubling her. Presently she came and stood
in front of the girl.</p>

<p>"What is it, mavourneen?" she asked. "Be after tellin' Mary
Donovan."</p>

<p>Diana rose, half turned her head away and bit her lower lip in
an effort to hide or suppress a short, quick intaking of the breath
that was almost a gasp.</p>

<p>"The stage was held up again today," she said, mastering herself
and turning, wide eyed, toward the older woman. "I saw them&mdash;I
saw them both."</p>

<p>"Yis!" said Mary Donovan.</p>

<p>"But it wasn't&mdash;it wasn't he! It wasn't, Mary Donovan!" and
Diana, throwing herself upon the broad, motherly bosom, burst into
tears, through which she gasped an occasional, "It wasn't! It
wasn't!"</p>

<p>"Shure, now, it wasn't," soothed Mary, "an' the first wan
that'll be after sayin' it was'll wish he'd nivir bin born, an'
even if it was, Diana Henders, there's many a good man's gone wrong
an' come right again.</p>

<p>"Why, look at that ould fool Wildcat Bob! They do be sayin' he
was a road agent his-self thirty year ago an' he's killed so many
men he's lost count o' 'em, he has; but now look at him! A quiet
an' paceable ould man, an' a good citizen whin he ain't full o'
barb-wire, which ain't often."</p>

<p>Diana dried her tears through a smile. "You're very fond of Bob,
aren't you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Run along wid ye, now!" exclaimed Mary Donovan, smiling
coyly.</p>

<p>"I think Bob would make you a good husband," continued Diana,
"and you really need a man around here. Why don't you marry him? I
know he's anxious enough."</p>

<p>"Marry him, indade!" sniffed Mary. "The ould fool's stricken
dumb ivery time he's alone wid me. If iver he's married it is, it's
the girl that'll be havin' to pop the question."</p>

<p>They were interrupted by a rap on the sitting-room door. It was
the vaquero from the Bar Y who had come down for the mail.</p>

<p>"Bill Gatlin told me you was here, Miss," he said. "Do you want
me to tell Colby to send the buckboard down for you?"</p>

<p>"I left Captain here, thanks," replied Diana, "and as soon as I
change my clothes I'll ride back to the ranch."</p>

<p>"Shall I wait fer you?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"No, thanks. I don't know how long I'll be," she told him; "but
if Pete is there you might ask him to ride out and meet me."</p>

<p>A half hour later Diana rode out of Hendersville on Captain
along the winding, dusty road bordered by interminable sage and
grease-wood that stretched off in undulating billows of rolling
land to the near mountains on the north and away to the south as
far as the eye could reach where the softened outlines of other
mountains rose, mysterious, through the haze. The low sun cast long
shadows toward the east, those of herself and her mount transformed
into a weird creature of Brobdingnagian proportions mincing along
upon preposterous legs.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of a prairie-dog village watched her approach
with growing suspicions, scampering at last to the safety of their
catacombian retreat&mdash;all but a single patriarch and two owls,
who watched her from the safe proximity of burrow mouths until she
had passed.</p>

<p>Drear and desolate the aspect of the scene, perhaps, but to
Diana it was home, and a tear came to her eye as she thought that
in a day or a week she might be leaving it forever. Her home! And
they were driving her away from it&mdash;stealing it from
her&mdash;her home that her father had built for her
mother&mdash;that he had planned that Diana should have after he
had gone. The wickedness of it! The injustice! That was what
rankled&mdash;the injustice! She dashed away the tear with an angry
gesture. She would not be dispossessed! She would fight! Mary
Donovan was right. It was no sin to fight the devil with fire.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that she saw a horseman approaching her
from the direction of the ranch. Her eyes, long accustomed to keen
observation and to vast expanses, recognized the man minutes before
his features were discernible, and a little cloud crossed her brow.
It was not Texas Pete, as she had hoped, but Hal Colby. Perhaps it
was for the best. She would have to see him sometime, and tell him.
As he approached her she saw that there was no welcoming smile on
his face, which wore a troubled expression. But his greeting was
cordial.</p>

<p>"Hello, Di!" he cried. "Why didn't you let me know you was
comin' today?"</p>

<p>"There was no way to let you know, of course," she replied. "You
might have guessed that I would be back as soon as I could."</p>

<p>"Tom jest got in from town an' told me you was comin'. I hurried
out to head you off. You don't want to come to the ranch now, it
wouldn't be no ways pleasant for you."</p>

<p>"Why?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"The Wainrights is there for one thing," he said, drawing rein
in front of her.</p>

<p>She set her firm little jaw and rode around him. "I am going
home," she said.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be foolish, Di," he insisted. "It'll only make more
trouble. They as good as got the place now. We can't fight 'em. It
wouldn't get us nowheres.</p>

<p>"Lemme see what I kin get 'em to do fer you. They're willin' to
give you enough to live decent on if you're reasonable, an' I'll
git the most I kin fer you; but if you go to fightin' 'em they
won't give you nothin'."</p>

<p>"They'll never give me anything," she cried. "I'd never accept
anything from them, but I'll take and keep what's mine, and my
friends will help me."</p>

<p>"You'll only git yourself an' your friends in a peck o'
trouble," he told her.</p>

<p>"Listen, Hal&mdash;" she hesitated, stumbling a little over the
speech she had been rehearsing. "There is something I want to say
to you. You asked me to marry you. I told you that if you would
wait a little while I thought that I could say yes. I can't say
yes, Hal, ever, for I don't love you. I'm sorry, but the only fair
thing to do was tell you."</p>

<p>He looked a bit crestfallen and disconcerted, for, though he had
realized that it would be poor policy to press his suit now that
she was penniless, it injured his pride to be told that he could
not have won her in any event, and suddenly came the realization
that, money or no money, he wanted her very much. His infatuation
for Lillian Manill was revealed in all its sordidness&mdash;it was
not love. All the money in the world, all the clothes in New York,
would not make Lillian Manill as desirable as Diana Henders.</p>

<p>Colby was a crude, uneducated man, yet he discerned in Diana
Henders a certain quality, far beyond his powers of analysis, that
placed her in a sphere to which Lillian Manill and her kind might
never hope to aspire. He knew now that he wanted Diana Henders for
herself and Lillian Manill for her money and for that coarse,
feminine attraction that certain types of women have for coarse
men.</p>

<p>He lived in a more or less lawless country and a more or less
lawless age, so it is not strange that there should have crept into
his mind the thought that he might possess them both. Naturally it
would be only the part of good business to possess lawfully the one
with the money. It was only the flash of a thought, though, and he
quickly put it aside.</p>

<p>"I'm plumb sorry, Di," he said; "but of course you know your own
business."</p>

<p>That was all he said, but he did a great deal of thinking and
the more he thought the more he realized how much he wanted her now
that she seemed least accessible. His face wore an expression such
as Diana Henders had never seen upon it before&mdash;he was not the
laughing, good-natured Hal that she had liked very much and almost
loved. There was something almost sinister about him, and she
wondered if being disappointed in love had this effect upon
men.</p>

<p>"How is everything at the ranch since I've been away?" she asked
presently.</p>

<p>"So-so," he replied. "Some o' the hands want to quit. They're
waitin' 'til you come, to git their checks."</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>"Pete, Shorty an' Idaho," he replied. "They'd a-ben the fust to
be let out after the change come, anyhow, so it don't make no
difference."</p>

<p>"You planned to stay on as foreman?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Shore! Why not? I got to work for someone, don't I?"</p>

<p>She made no reply and they rode on in silence toward the ranch.
He had given up trying to dissuade her. Let them do their own dirty
work, he thought. As they neared the ranch a horseman emerged from
the yard and came toward them at a run amidst a cloud of dust that
obscured the ranch and all else behind him. It was Texas Pete. He
brought his horse to its haunches beside her and wheeled the animal
about on its hind feet.</p>

<p>"I jest got in, Miss," he said, "an' Tom told me you had sent
word in that I was to meet you. I'm plumb sorry I was late."</p>

<p>Each man ignored the other as completely as though he had not
existed.</p>

<p>"I understand you want to quit, Pete," said the girl; "you and
Shorty and Idaho."</p>

<p>Pete looked down, shamefacedly. "We was a-aimin' to," he
said.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd come up to the office and bring Shorty and Idaho
with you when we get home," she said. "I want to talk with
you."</p>

<p>"All right, Miss."</p>

<p>The three finished the ride in silence. Diana dismounted with
them at the corral and leaving her horse for Pete to unsaddle
walked toward the office. As she approached the doorway she saw
that there were several people in the room and when she crossed the
threshold found herself face to face with Corson, Lillian Manill
and the two Wainrights. Corson nodded and he and the younger
Wainright rose.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Miss Henders," said Corson; "back safely, I
see."</p>

<p>She ignored his greeting and stood for a moment silently eying
them through narrowed lids. Her wide brimmed sombrero sat straight
and level above slightly contracted brows. A tendril of hair waved
softly over one temple where it had escaped the stiff confinement
of the heavy hat, but it did not tend to soften the light in those
cold, steady eyes, reflecting the bitterness of her resentment
toward these four.</p>

<p>About her hips a cartridge filled belt supported a heavy
gun&mdash;no toy such as women sometimes effect, but a .45, grim
and suggestive. Its grip was shiny with usage and the blue was worn
from the steel in places.</p>

<p>"I know little about law, Mr. Corson," she said, without
prelude. "I have lived almost all my life a long way beyond either
the protection or the menace of law. We do not bother much about it
out here; but we understand moral right perfectly. We know what
justice is and we have our own ways of enforcing it. We have
similar ways of protecting our just rights, as well.</p>

<p>"These means I intend to invoke against you, all of you, who
have come here with the intention of robbing me of what is rightly
mine. Though I owe you no consideration it is my duty to warn you
that our methods in such matters are usually sudden and always
unpleasant.</p>

<p>"I shall give you, Mr. Corson and Miss Manill, an hour to leave
the premises&mdash;the buckboard will be ready then. Mr. Wainright
and his son have five minutes, as they have no excuse whatsoever
for being here. Now, go!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16" name="ch16">XVI. &mdash; COMMON CRIMINALS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AN amused smile curled Mr. Corson's unpleasant
mouth. Mr. Wainright, Sr., bobbed to his feet, though through no
belated urge of chivalry. Lillian Manill rose languidly, pretending
to suppress a simulated yawn with the backs of her white fingers.
Young Mr. Wainright shuffled uneasily from one foot to the
other.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Miss Henders," said Corson, "that you do not quite
grasp the situation. You<sup>___</sup>"</p>

<p>"It is you who fail to grasp it, Mr. Corson," snapped Diana,
"and please remember that you have only an hour in which to
pack."</p>

<p>Corson dropped his suavity. "See here," he exclaimed, "I've
fooled along with you as much as I'm going to. You're the one who's
going to get off this place. You haven't a right on earth here. You
don't own a stick or a stone, a hoof or a tail, the length or
breadth of the Bar Y. Now you go and go quick or you'll land in
jail, where you belong for the threats you've made. I imagine
you'll learn something about law then."</p>

<p>"How come?" inquired a voice from the doorway and simultaneously
three figures appeared upon the veranda. "You sent for us, Miss,
and here we are," continued Texas Pete.</p>

<p>"An' I reckon we arriv about the right time fer the party,"
opined Shorty.</p>

<p>"I craves the first dance with that dude with the funny pants,"
said Idaho, staring at Corson.</p>

<p>"Boys," said Diana, "these people are trying to rob me of the
ranch, the mine and all the cattle. I have given Mr. Corson and
Miss Manill an hour to leave the premises. Idaho, I wish that you
would see that they get away on time, and drive them, or better,
have Willie drive them, to town. Mr. Wainright and his son had five
minutes in which to leave, Shorty. They have wasted three of them.
Can you help them to get away on schedule?"</p>

<p>"Whee!" wheed Shorty. "Watch my smoke&mdash;and their dust. Fan
yerselves, gents," and he sprang into the room, circling the
Wainrights to come upon them from the rear, true to the instincts
of the cowman.</p>

<p>The elder Wainright had arguments upon his tongue&mdash;you
could see them in his eye, paradoxical as it may sound&mdash;but he
permitted them to expire, voiceless, and took to his heels,
followed closely by his son. Jefferson Wainright, Sr., had been run
off the Bar Y upon another occasion and he had not relished the
experience. He moved now with great rapidity and singleness of
purpose in the direction of the corrals, his son at his heels and
Shorty inconveniently close behind.</p>

<p>To Mr. Wainright's partial relief Shorty had as yet indulged in
no target practice, but it might come at any moment. Sympathetic
perspiration streamed down the red face of Wainright, of Worcester
blankets. He almost breathed a sigh of relief when he reached the
corrals, but a sudden thought froze him with terror. They could not
have more than a minute left. It would be impossible to hook up
their team in that time. As he climbed through the bars he tried to
explain that impossibility to Shorty.</p>

<p>"Ride 'em, then," admonished their escort.</p>

<p>"But we have no saddles," expostulated the younger
Wainright.</p>

<p>"No," agreed Shorty, "you ain't got nothin' but a minute an' you
won't have thet long. I commences shootin' when the minute's
up&mdash;an' I ain't a-goin' to shoot fer fun. I ben a-waitin' fer
this chanct fer months."</p>

<p>Frantically the Elder Wainright dragged a reluctant broncho by
the halter, got him outside the corral and struggled to clamber to
his back. It was an utter failure. Then he seized the rope again
and tugging and pulling started for the gate. His son, more
successful, had succeeded in mounting the other animal, and as he
trotted past his father he whacked that gentleman's unwilling
companion on the rump with the bight of his halter rope. The
effects were thrilling and immediate. The broncho leaped forward,
upset Mr. Wainright, galloped over him and dashed out the gate into
the vast, unfenced immensity.</p>

<p>"Five seconds!" announced Shorty.</p>

<p>Mr. Wainright scrambled to his feet and started after the
broncho. He passed through the Bar Y gate behind his son and heir
with one second to spare. Disgusted, Shorty slipped his gun back
into its holster.</p>

<p>"Now keep goin'," he told them, "an' don't never nary one of you
come back."</p>

<p>"Gosh ding it!" he soliloquized as he walked back toward the
office, "I wisht she'd only a-gave 'em four minutes."</p>

<p>He was suddenly confronted by Colby, running and out of wind.
"What you ben doin'?" demanded the foreman. "I jest seen the tail
end of it from the cook-house winder. Wot in 'ell do you mean by
it, anyhow, eh?"</p>

<p>Shorty eyed him up and down insolently. "I ain't got no time fer
you, Colby," he said. "I'm gettin' my orders from the boss. If she
tells me to run any ornery critters offen the ranch I'm here to run
'em off, sabe?"</p>

<p>"You mean Miss Henders told you to run the Wainrights off?"
demanded Colby.</p>

<p>"I reckon you ain't deef," and Shorty continued his way toward
the office. Colby followed him. He found Texas Pete and Idaho
standing in the room. Diana was seated in her father's easy
chair.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this business, Di?" demanded Colby. "Did
you tell Shorty to run the Wainrights off?"</p>

<p>"I ran them off, Hal," replied the girl. "I only asked Shorty to
see that they went. I have told Mr. Corson and Miss Manill to go,
too. Idaho will see that they get to town safely."</p>

<p>"You must be crazy!" exclaimed Colby. "They'll have the law on
you."</p>

<p>"I am not crazy, Hal. I may have been a little blind, but I am
far from crazy&mdash;my eyes are open now, open wide enough for me
to be able to recognize my friends from my enemies."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he demanded, noting the directly personal
insinuation.</p>

<p>"I mean, Hal, that any of my men who would contemplate working
for those people after they had robbed me can't work for me. Pete
has your check. He is acting foreman until Bull returns." Her chin
went up proudly as she made the statement.</p>

<p>Colby was stunned. He took the check in silence and turned
toward the door, where he stopped and faced her. "Bull won't never
come back," he said, "'less it's with a halter round his neck."</p>

<p>The other three men looked toward Diana for an intimation of her
wishes, but she only sat silently, tapping the toe of a spurred
boot upon the Navajo rug at her feet. Colby turned once more and
passed out into the gathering dusk.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>A half hour later Wild Bill, otherwise and quite generally known
as Willie, jogged dustily townward with Maurice B. Corson, Lillian
Manill and their baggage. Halfway there they overtook the
Wainrights, the elder riding the single horse, which his son had
given up to him, while the younger plodded along in the powdery
dust. Corson told Willie to stop and take them both into the
buckboard.</p>

<p>"Not on your life," said Willie. "I gits my orders from the boss
an' she didn't say nothin' about pickin' up no more dudes.
Giddap!"</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Later that evening a select gathering occupied a table at one
side of Gum's bar-room. There were the Wainrights, Mr. Maurice B.
Corson, Miss Lillian Manill, Hal Colby and Gum Smith. All but Gum
seemed out of sorts, but then he was the only one of them who had
not been run off a ranch.</p>

<p>"We have the law on our side, Mr. Sheriff," Corson was saying,
"and all we ask is your official backing. I realize that the first
thing to do is to get rid of the ruffians in her employ and then we
can easily bring her to terms. The worst of them is this man Bull,
but now that he is practically an outlaw it should be comparatively
easy to get him.</p>

<p>"I have arranged for an exceptionally large gold shipment from
the mine on the next stage and I have taken pains not to keep the
matter too secret. The news is almost certain to reach him through
the usual channels and should serve as an excellent bait to lure
him into another attempted holdup of the stage.</p>

<p>"You can then be on hand, in hiding, with a posse and should you
fail to get him alive it will be all the better for society at
large if you get him dead. Do you understand me?"</p>

<p>"That ain't no way to go about it," interrupted Colby. "You
couldn't hide nowhere within five miles o' the gap without them two
hombres knowin' it. Now you just forget that scheme an' leave it to
me. You an' your posse keep away from the gap. Just leave it to
me."</p>

<p>"Ah think Hal's about right," agreed Gum Smith. "Yo'all doan'
know them two. They shore is foxy. Why, jes look at all the times
Ah've ben after 'em. Yo jes leave it to Hal here an' he shore'll
git 'em."</p>

<p>"All right," said Corson, "and then we can get the other three
later, some way. Lure them into town one by one an'&mdash;well, I
don't need to tell you gentlemen what's necessary. Only don't
forget that they're worth a thousand dollars apiece to me&mdash;if
they can't bother us any more."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Worn out by the excitement of the day Diana retired to her room
shortly after the lonely evening meal. She had been keyed up to a
high pitch of nervous excitement for hours and now that she had
relaxed the reaction came, leaving her tired and melancholy. She
was almost too tired to undress and so she threw herself into an
easy chair and sat with her head thrown back and her eyes
closed.</p>

<p>The window of her room, overlooking the ranch yard toward the
corrals, was wide open to the cooling summer air. The lamp burning
on her reading table cast its golden light upon her loosened hair
and regular profile.</p>

<p>Outside a figure moved cautiously around the house until it
stood among the trees beneath her window&mdash;the figure of a man
who, looking up, could just see the outlines of the girl's face
above the sill. He watched her for a moment and then glanced
carefully about as though to assure himself that there was none
other near.</p>

<p>Presently, faintly, the notes of a meadow-lark rose softly upon
the night air. Diana's eyes flashed open. She listened intently. A
moment later the brief, sweet song was repeated. The girl rose to
her feet, gathered her hair quickly into a knot at the back of her
head, and ran down the stairway, along the hall, into the office.
She walked quickly, her heart beating a trifle wildly, to the door.
Without hesitation she opened it and stepped out into the night.
Below her stood a tall man with broad shoulders.</p>

<p>"Bull!" she exclaimed, in a low whisper.</p>

<p>The man swept his broad sombrero from his head. "Good evening,
<i>Señorita</i>!" he said. "It is not <i>Señor</i> Bull&mdash;it is
Gregorio."</p>

<p>Diana Henders stepped back. She had removed her belt and gun. So
sure she had been that it was Bull and such confidence she had in
him that she had not given a thought to her unarmed condition. What
better protection could any girl demand than just Bull!</p>

<p>"What do you want here, Gregorio?" she demanded.</p>

<p>The Mexican perceived the girl's surprise, saw her draw back,
and grinned. It did not offend him that she might be afraid of him.
He had become what he was by inspiring fear in others and he was
rather proud of it&mdash;proud of being an outlaw, proud of being
hunted by the gringoes, whom he knew held his courage and his
gun-hand, if not himself, in respect.</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid, <i>Señorita</i>," he said. "I was sent to you
by <i>Señor</i> Bull, with a message." He held out a long, flat
envelope. "You are to read it and hide it where the others will not
find it. He says that you will know how to make use of it."</p>

<p>She took the proffered parcel. "Why did not <i>Señor</i> Bull
come himself?" she asked.</p>

<p>"How should I know, <i>Señorita</i>?" he replied. "Perhaps he
thought that you would not want The Black Coyote to come here. He
knew that you recognized him today. He saw it in your eyes."</p>

<p>She was silent a moment as though weighing the wisdom of a reply
to his statement, but she made none. "Is that all, Gregorio?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"That is all, <i>Señorita</i>."</p>

<p>"Then thank you, and good-bye. Thank <i>Señor</i> Bull, too, and
tell him that his job is waiting for him&mdash;when he can come
back."</p>

<p>Gregorio swept his hat low and turned back into the shadows.
Diana entered the office and closed the door. Going directly to her
room she took a chair beneath the reading-lamp and examined the
outside of the envelope Gregorio had given her.</p>

<p>It was addressed to Maurice B. Corson! How had Bull come by it?
But of course she knew&mdash;it was a piece of the mail that had
come into his possession through the robbing of the stage.</p>

<p>The girl shuddered and held it away from her. She saw that the
envelope had been opened. Bull had done that. She sat looking at
the thing for a long time. Could she bring herself to read the
contents? It had not been meant for her&mdash;to read it, then,
would be to put herself on a par with The Black Coyote. She would
be as much a thief as he. The only right and proper thing to do was
to get the letter into Corson's hands as quickly as
possible&mdash;she could not be a party to Bull's crime.</p>

<p>She laid it, almost threw it, in fact, upon the table, as though
it were an unclean thing, and sat for a long time in deep thought.
Occasionally her eyes returned to the letter. The thing seemed to
hold a malignant fascination for her. What was in it?</p>

<p>It must concern her, or Bull would not have sent it to her. She
would send it to Corson the first thing in the morning. Bull would
not ask her to read something that did not concern her. She rose
and commenced to remove her clothing. Once or twice as she passed
the table she stopped and looked at the envelope and at last, in
her night robe, as she went to blow out the lamp she stood for a
full minute staring at the superscription. Again she argued that
Bull would not have sent it to her had it been wrong for her to
read it. Then she extinguished the light and got into bed.</p>

<p>For an hour Diana Henders tossed about, sleepless. The envelope
upon the reading table haunted her. It had no business there. It
belonged to Maurice B. Corson. If it were to be found in her
possession she could be held as guilty as the robber who took it
from the United States mail pouch. They could send her to jail.
Somehow that thought did not frighten her at all.</p>

<p>What was in it? It must be something concerning the property
they were trying to steal from her. They were thieves. One was
almost justified in taking any steps to frustrate their dishonest
plans.</p>

<p>Suddenly she recalled what Mary Donovan had said: "You've got to
fight the devil with fire!" And then Diana Henders flung the covers
from her and swung her feet to the floor. A moment later she had
lighted the lamp. There was no more hesitation.</p>

<p>She took up the envelope and extracted its contents, which
consisted of three papers. The first she examined was a brief
letter of transmission noting the enclosures and signed by a clerk
in Corson's office. The second was John Manill's will&mdash;the
later will that Corson had told her did not exist. She read it
through carefully. Word for word it was a duplicate of the last
will her father had made, except for the substitution of Elias
Henders' name as beneficiary. The clause leaving the property to
their joint heirs in the event of her father's prior death
followed.</p>

<p>Suddenly Diana experienced a sensation of elation and freedom
such as had not been hers since her father's death. She could fight
them now&mdash;she had something to fight with, and Lillian Manill
could claim only what was legally hers.</p>

<p>An even division would entail unpleasant complications of
administration, but at least they could not take her share from
her. They might sell theirs&mdash;they might and probably would
sell it to the Wainrights, which would be horrible of course, but
she would stand her ground and get her rights no matter who owned
the other half.</p>

<p>She laid the will aside and picked up the third paper. It was a
letter, in her uncle's familiar handwriting, addressed to her
father:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear El</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">In the event that I go first I want to ask you to
look after Lillian for me at least until she is married. Since her
mother's death she has no one but me and naturally I feel not only
a certain responsibility for her but a real affection that is
almost paternal, since she was but a year old when I married her
mother. She has never known any other father, her own having been
killed before she was born. Although she knows the truth concerning
her parentage I think she looks upon me as a father and if I am
unable to do so I know that you will provide for her. I did not
mention her in my will because our understanding included only our
legal heirs, or I should say heir now, since Diana is the only one
left, and as she will inherit all our property eventually I hope
that you will pass this request on to her, which I shall leave
attached to my will.</p>

<p class="letter">Affectionately,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">John</span>.</p>

<p><br>
Diana sat with staring eyes fixed upon the letter in her
hand&mdash;and she had almost sent these papers back to Corson! She
shuddered as she thought of the narrow escape she had had. Why,
they were no better than common criminals!</p>

<p>And she was sole heir to the Bar Y! She did not think of the
gold mine, or the value of the great herds and the broad acres. She
thought only of the Bar Y as something that she loved&mdash;as
home.</p>

<p>Now no one could take it away from her, and yet she was not
happy. There was <i>a little rift within the lute</i>&mdash;Bull
was an outlaw! And who else was there than Bull upon whom she might
depend for guidance and advice in the handling of her affairs?</p>

<p>He was a good cattleman&mdash;her father had always said that,
and had had confidence in his judgment and ability. His one fault,
they had thought, had been his drinking, and this she felt,
intuitively, he had overcome. Of his loyalty there had never been
any doubt until the whisperings of the ugly rumors that had
connected him with the robberies of the stage. These she had
consistently refused to believe&mdash;even to the point of denying
the evidence of her own eyes; but Gregorio had definitely
confounded the remnants of her hopes.</p>

<p>Yet still she thought of Bull as her sole resource&mdash;even
now she had confidence in him. She could not fathom the mental
processes that permitted her mind to dwell upon him without
loathing or contempt&mdash;but, after all, was she being influenced
by the dictates of her mind? She shrank from contemplation of the
alternative, yet it persistently obtruded itself upon her reveries.
If her mind refused to fly to the defense of Bull, then it must be
her heart that championed him. What reason would not do, love had
accomplished.</p>

<p>She flushed at the thought and tried to put it aside, for it was
impossible. It could not be that she, Diana Henders, could love an
outlaw and a criminal. No, she must put Bull out of her mind
forever, and with this resolve mingling with her tears she fell
asleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch17" name="ch17">XVII. &mdash; THE BLACK COYOTE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WITH the coming of morning Diana Henders' mind
had, to some extent at least, emerged from the chaos of conflicting
emotions that had obstructed reasonable consideration of her plans
for the immediate future. It had been her intention to ride
forthwith to Hendersville and confront Corson and Lillian with the
proofs of their perfidy, but now saner reflection counseled more
rational procedure. The law now was all upon her side, the proofs
were all in her hands. It was beyond their power to harm her. She
would continue in the even tenor of her ways, directing the affairs
of the ranch and mine, as though they did not exist. When they made
a move she would be prepared to meet it.</p>

<p>She spent an hour before breakfast in the office writing
diligently and then she sent for Texas Pete. When he arrived she
handed him an envelope.</p>

<p>"Take this to Aldea, Pete," she said, "and mail it on the first
eastbound train. I can't trust to the stage&mdash;it is held up too
often&mdash;and, Pete, I am sending you because I know that I can
trust you to get to Aldea as quickly as you can without letting
anything interfere&mdash;it means a great deal to me, Pete."</p>

<p>"I'll git it there," said Texas Pete, and she knew that he
would.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later she glanced through the doorway of the
kitchen, where she was talking with Wong, and saw a cloud of dust
streaking swiftly northward toward Hell's Bend Pass, across country
in an air line. Roads and trails were not for such as Texas Pete
when speed was paramount.</p>

<p>The day, occupied by the normal duties of the ranch, passed
without unusual incident. There was no word from Corson. The next
day came, brought Texas Pete back from Aldea, and went its way with
the infinite procession of other yesterdays, and still no word from
Corson. By this time Diana was about convinced that the New Yorker,
appreciating what the theft of his letter must mean to him, had
abandoned his scheme and that doubtless the stage that arrived in
Hendersville today would carry him and his accomplice back to Aldea
and an eastbound train.</p>

<p>Her mind was occupied with such satisfactory imaginings that
morning when the office doorway was darkened by the figure of a
man. Looking up she saw Gum Smith standing with hat in hand.</p>

<p>"Mo'nin', Miss," he greeted her.</p>

<p>Diana nodded, wondering what Gum Smith could be doing on the Bar
Y, a place where he had always been notoriously unwelcome.</p>

<p>"Ah've came on a mos' onpleasant duty, Miss," he explained. "As
sheriff o' this yere county it is mah duty to serve yo-all with
notice to vacate this property by noon tomorrer, as the rightful
an' lawful owners wishes to occupy same."</p>

<p>"You mean Mr. Corson and Miss Manill?" inquired Diana,
sweetly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss, an' they hopes they won't be no trouble. They's
willin' to do the right thing by yo, ef yo moves off peaceable-like
an' pronto."</p>

<p>"Would you mind taking a note to Mr. Corson for me?" she asked.
"I think I can convince him that he is making a mistake."</p>

<p>Gum Smith would be glad to accommodate her. He said so, but he
also advised her, as "a friend of her father", to make her
preparations for early departure, since Mr. Corson's patience was
exhausted and he had determined to take drastic action to possess
himself of the ranch, as Miss Manill's agent.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>When Mr. Maurice B. Corson read that note an hour later he swore
in a most unseemly manner. He did not divulge its contents to the
Wainrights, but he went into executive session with Gum Smith and
Hal Colby from which he did not emerge for an hour. A short time
later the sheriff, accompanied by a dozen deputies, rode out of
Hendersville and some time thereafter Corson, Lillian Manill and
the Wainrights drove off in the latter's buckboard which Diana had
sent in to them the morning after their hasty departure from the
Bar Y.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The ranch was deserted that afternoon, except for a couple of
laborers, the white cook at the cook-house and Wong at the
residence. Texas Pete and his vaqueros were spread over a vast
principality occupied with the various duties of their calling.
Idaho had been left at home, in accordance with time-honored
custom, to act as body guard for Diana should she wish to ride
abroad, which she had wished to do, and they were both off to the
southeast somewhere, in the direction of the Johnson Ranch.</p>

<p>It was a lazy afternoon. The air vibrated with heat. But in one
corner of the kitchen, far from the stove, which was now out, there
was a cool corner, or rather one less like inferno. Here stood a
long table that had once graced the dining room, and upon it at
full length, supine, lay Wong, asleep, his long pipe with its tiny
brass bowl still clutched in one depending hand.</p>

<p>He was aroused by the sound of voices in the front of the house.
He opened his eyes, sat up and listened. There was a woman's voice
among those of men, but it was not the voice of "Mlissee Dli." Wong
arose and walked toward the office. He stopped where he could
observe the interior without being observed. His slanting, oriental
eyes narrowed at what he saw. There were Corson and Miss Manill,
the two Wainrights and Gum Smith. Corson was going through Elias
Henders' desk as though it belonged to him. Presently, after having
examined many papers, he evidently found what he wanted, for there
was a look of relief upon his face as he stuffed them into an
inside pocket of his coat after a superficial glance.</p>

<p>The elder Wainright was continually glancing through the doorway
with an air of extreme nervousness. "You think it is perfectly
safe, Sheriff?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Of course it is, Wainright," snapped Corson. "We've got the law
on our side, I tell you, and enough men out there to back it up. As
soon as her men find we mean business they won't bother us as long
as she isn't here to egg them on, and most of them would just as
soon work for us anyway when they find Colby is coming back as
foreman&mdash;a lot of them are his friends."</p>

<p>"I don't see why Colby didn't come along with us now," grumbled
Wainright.</p>

<p>"He wanted to wait until we were settled in our ownership and
then we could hire whom we pleased as foreman," said Corson. "I see
how he feels about it and it will help to make him stronger with
the men and with the neighbors if he hasn't taken any part in the
eviction. It'll be better for us in the long run, for we are going
to need all the friends we can get in the county."</p>

<p>"I am afraid we are," agreed Wainright. "I hope you will fire
that Texas Pete and the ones they call Shorty an' Idaho the very
fust thing you do. I don't like 'em."</p>

<p>"That's about the first thing I intend doing as soon as they get
in," replied Corson. "Just now we'd better look up that damned
insolent Chink and tell him how many are going to be here for
dinner, or supper, or whatever they call it out here."</p>

<p>Wong tiptoed silently and swiftly to the kitchen, where Lillian
Manill found him a moment later and imparted her orders to him.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>An hour later Texas Pete rode into the ranch yard with his men.
He was met at the corrals by a fellow he recognized as an habitué
of Gum's Place&mdash;one Ward, by name.</p>

<p>"Evenin'," said Ward.</p>

<p>"Evenin'," replied Texas Pete. "Wotinell are you doin' here,
Ward?"</p>

<p>"They wants you, Shorty an' Idaho up to the office."</p>

<p>"Who wants us?"</p>

<p>"Miss Henders an' the people she's sold out to."</p>

<p>"Sold out, hell!" exclaimed Pete.</p>

<p>"Go on up an' ask 'em."</p>

<p>"I shore will. Come on, Shorty. Idaho must be aroun' the
bunk-house somewheres." The two men started for the office. At the
bunk-house they looked for Idaho, but he was not there, so they
went on without him. As they approached the house they saw three
men lolling on the veranda outside the office door. They were not
Bar Y men. Inside they saw Corson sitting at the desk. He motioned
them to enter.</p>

<p>"Come in, boys," he said, pleasantly.</p>

<p>As they entered the three men behind them rose and drew their
six-guns and at the same instant three others just within the
office covered them with theirs.</p>

<p>"Put 'em up!" they were advised, and Texas Pete and Shorty,
being men of discretion, put them up. While they had them up one of
the gentlemen in their rear relieved them of their weapons.</p>

<p>"Now look here, boys," said Corson, not unpleasantly, "we have
no quarrel with you and we don't want any, but you're rather quick
with your guns and we took this means of insuring an amicable
interview. Mr. Wainright, Miss Manill and I are now owners of the
Bar Y Ranch. Miss Henders, realizing that she had no claim, has
vacated the premises and turned them over to us. We shall not need
your services any longer. We shall give you a month's wages and
escort you as far as town, where your weapons will be turned over
to you; but I want to warn you that you are not to return to the
Bar Y. If you do I shall see that the law takes its full course
with you."</p>

<p>"Where's Miss Henders?" demanded Texas Pete.</p>

<p>"She has left the ranch," replied Corson. "I do not know her
exact plans, but I think she went directly to Aldea to take the
train for the East."</p>

<p>"I don't know her exact plans neither," said Texas Pete, "but I
know you are a damn liar. You got the drop on me an' Shorty, an' we
goes to town as you says, but if the rest that you have told us
ain't straight we're comin' back agin. An' when we do it's a-goin'
to be gosh-almighty onpleasant fer dudes in these parts. Sabe?"</p>

<p>"If you show your faces around here again you'll be shot on
sight," said Corson. "We've got the men and the money to run this
ranch as we see fit, and we mean business. The old, disgraceful,
lawless days are about over in this county, and there won't be any
place for bad-men like you two."</p>

<p>"No, Pete," said Shorty, "we're did fer, our time's up, they
ain't no more place fer us 'an a jack-rabbit. We're a-goin' to hev
a new brand o' bad-men now&mdash;the kind they raise in Noo York
that wears funny pants an' robs orphants."</p>

<p>"Take them to town, boys," said Corson, addressing his own men,
"and then come back here. You've all got jobs here on the Bar Y,
and one of the first duties you have is to shoot bad-men on sight,
if they show up around the ranch."</p>

<p>Texas Pete and Shorty turned and walked out with their escort,
and shortly after, still under guard, were loping away in the
direction of Hendersville.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The stage came down the pass with a load of passengers that day
and among them was a lawyer from Aldea imported by Corson and
Wainright to draw up the papers that would make one-third the Bar Y
property Wainright's and place a hundred and twenty-five thousand
dollars in the hands of Corson and Lillian Manill.</p>

<p>At the mine road it stopped and took on the messenger with the
bullion. Then to the crack of Bill Gatlin's whip it lurched onward
toward the gap. Bill was discoursing to a tender-foot who had
remarked on the dry appearance of the country that he had seen,
stretching away as far as the eye could reach, from the summit of
the pass.</p>

<p>"I should hate to be caught out there alone," said the young
man. "I'm afraid I'd starve to death."</p>

<p>"Why that wouldn't be nothin'," observed Bill. "That wouldn't be
nothin' at all. Why back in the seventies when I was ridin' fer the
Lazy H outfit in Montana I was chasin' a critter one day when my
pony stepped in a badger hole an' after turnin' three complete
somersaults lights plumb on his feet an' starts across country
scared stiff, which would a'ben all right ef it hadn't a'ben that
the last somersault shuck me clean outen the saddle, an' by cracky
it was jest my durn luck that my foot caught in the stirrup an'
that ornery critter up an' drags me. He was so sceart that he never
much more'n slowed up fer three days. Yes, sir, he drug me fer
three days <i>an'</i> nights, an' all I hed to eat was when he drug
me through a strawberry patch an' all I hed to drink was when he
drug me through a river. No, sir, after thet it wouldn't seem bad
at all to be left out no wheres in no country."</p>

<p>The tender-foot looked at Bill with deep and reverent awe, but
he said nothing. The stage bumped over the uneven road, lurching
drunkenly around curves. A masked man waited silently behind the
boulders at the south end of the gap. He appeared nervous, turning
often to glance back into the chapparal from which he had emerged a
few moments before. "I wonder where in hell Gregorio is," he
muttered, half aloud, "he told me last night that he would be here
before me."</p>

<p>The stage drew nearer. Bill Gatlin reined his team to a walk at
the first deep chuck-hole at the entrance to the gap. The horses
moved slowly, picking their way and sometimes stumbling in the
deep, dust filled cavities that made this short stretch of scarce
fifty yards the most notorious piece of road within a hundred
miles.</p>

<p>The lone highwayman could wait no longer for his
accomplice&mdash;he must essay the thing alone. He stepped forward
to intercept the slow-moving stage and as he did so a noise behind
him attracted his attention, and a single backward glance revealed
to him a masked man and the familiar habiliments of Gregorio. He
breathed a quick sigh of relief, motioned to his accomplice to
hurry, and moved forward with the second man now close at his
heels.</p>

<p>Bill Gatlin and the messenger were not surprised when the two
men stepped into the middle of the gap and held them up. They would
not have been surprised under ordinary circumstances, but today
they had been forewarned that there would doubtless be an attempted
holdup on account of the unusually valuable gold shipment, which
was being used as a lure to trap The Black Coyote, and they had
been warned to offer no resistance since Hal Colby had agreed to
take the notorious robber if the matter was left entirely in his
hands without any interference whatsoever. All of which pleased
Bill Gatlin and the messenger immensely, since it relieved them
both of most of the danger and all the responsibility. Not only did
Bill Gatlin show no surprise at the appearance of the two masked
figures, but, as a matter of fact, he was already stopping his team
as they appeared, and had his hands in the air almost as soon as
the command left the lips of the foremost of them. As usual the
Mexican kept the driver and messenger covered while The Black
Coyote approached the stage to obtain the gold, but this time the
second robber followed his principal more closely than had formerly
been his custom. The Coyote menaced the passengers with his
weapons, seeing that they kept their hands elevated, and then with
Gregorio on the watch behind him he slipped both his guns back into
their holsters and reached up to take the bags of gold away from
the messenger.</p>

<p>He had placed one foot on the hub of the front wheel to raise
himself to a height that would enable him to reach the precious
pouches when his confederate stepped quickly toward him, shoved the
muzzles of his guns into The Black Coyote's back, and ordered him
to put up his hands.</p>

<p>"Step down and put 'em up," he said. "You're through."</p>

<p>"Durn my hide!" exclaimed Bill Gatlin. "Hal's pretty cute. I
thought he was Gregorio all the time. He's got Bull to rights this
time."</p>

<p>The Black Coyote stepped back from the stage, with a growl. "You
dirty greaser, you," he cried. "I'll get you for this yet,
Gregorio."</p>

<p>The latter nodded to the messenger. "Get down an' git his guns,"
he said, and when the man had done so, "Now yank off his mask."</p>

<p>The messenger jerked the black silk handkerchief from the face
of The Black Coyote with a single quick movement, and then stepped
back suddenly, his eyes wide with surprise. "Colby!" he
ejaculated.</p>

<p>Bill Gatlin almost swallowed his quid of tobacco. "Well I'll be
hornswaggled!" he exclaimed, and then to the second robber, "an'
you was Gregorio all the time an' I mistook you fer Colby. The joke
sure is on me, an' the drinks too."</p>

<p>"They are," agreed the second robber. He shoved one of his guns
into its holster and removed his own mask.</p>

<p>"Well now I <i>will</i> be hornswaggled," murmured Bill
Gatlin&mdash;"ef it ain't Bull!"</p>

<p>"Keep him covered," said Bull to the messenger, "while I get our
horses."</p>

<p>Colby glared sullenly at Bull as the latter walked back up the
road to get the horses, but he said nothing. He was still half
dazed from the surprise of seeing Bull disguised as Gregorio, for
even to the latter's guns Bull wore the entire outfit of the
Mexican, and when Bull returned, riding Gregorio's and leading
Colby's animal, The Black Coyote eyed him as though he still
doubted his identity.</p>

<p>Bull drew rein beside him and nodded toward Colby's horse.
"Climb aboard," he said. Colby mounted and Bull tossed the noose of
his reata around his prisoner's neck, drawing up the slack until
the honda touched the collar of the man's shirt.</p>

<p>"Pull yer freight, Colby," said Bull, and the two started off
down the road toward Hendersville. A moment later the stage passed
them.</p>

<p>"Want me to stay along with you in case you need any help?"
called Bill Gatlin.</p>

<p>"I won't want no help," said Bull.</p>

<p>As the stage drew away from them, concealing itself in its own
dust, a swarthy rider galloped up to Bull and Colby, reining in a
blaze-face chestnut beside them. It was Gregorio. Colby glared at
the Mexican.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Shut up, Colby," Bull interrupted him. "You got what was comin'
to you. It'll learn you not to ditch a pal."</p>

<p>Gregorio had dismounted and was stripping off his outer garments
and Bull followed his example. As they exchanged clothing and
horses they joked together over the day's work, which they
considered good. Gregorio swung himself into his saddle first.</p>

<p>"<i>A Dios, Señor</i> Bull!" he cried with a wave of his hand.
"Perhaps in a few days Gregorio comes out of the hills, eh?"</p>

<p>"I'll fix that up when I git through with this business,
Gregorio," replied the American. "In the meantime just lay
low."</p>

<p>"And I will work with you for the Bar Y Rancho?" inquired the
Mexican.</p>

<p>"If I do, Gregorio. So-long!"</p>

<p>"<i>A Dios, Señor!</i>" and Gregorio wheeled his pony back
toward the hills.</p>

<p>"Thet greaser's whiter'n some white men," said Bull.</p>

<p>When he trotted into Hendersville a few minutes behind the stage
he found that already the news had spread and a crowd, gathered
about the stage in front of The Donovan House, surrounded him and
his prisoner.</p>

<p>"Durn his hide!" exclaimed one who had been foremost among the
posse that had ridden forth to hang Bull only a short time before,
"I knew right along 'twarn't Bull. I allus said they was something
shady about thet there Colby feller."</p>

<p>Bull had but just drawn rein when Texas Pete and Shorty rode up,
safely delivered in town by their escort and having reclaimed their
guns which had been emptied of cartridges and dropped in the road
at the edge of town while the escort galloped quickly out of range
toward the Bar Y.</p>

<p>Texas Pete had no time for questions. His quick eyes took in the
scene at a glance and possibly he guessed the explanation, or
caught it from the comments of the crowd, but another and more
important matter occupied his thoughts as he forced his pony to
Bull's side.</p>

<p>"Have you saw anything of Miss Di?" he asked. "Is she here in
town?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Why?"</p>

<p>"She ain't on the Bar Y. Corson says she's sold out an' left fer
Aldea," replied Texas Pete.</p>

<p>"Corson's a liar," snapped Bull. He turned toward the veranda of
The Donovan House where he espied the proprietress. "Mrs. Donovan!"
he called to her, "is Miss Henders in town?"</p>

<p>"She is not, Bull," replied Mary Donovan.</p>

<p>Bull turned his eyes toward the crowd until they alighted upon a
man he knew who bore a decent reputation&mdash;one who was not
affiliated with Gum Smith or his gang.</p>

<p>"Thompson," he called, "you take Colby an' keep him 'til I git
back. Don't let Gum Smith git his hands on him, an' shoot Colby if
he makes any funny plays. Git down offen your horse, Colby. Take
him, Thompson. Come on boys!" and with Texas Pete and Shorty at his
pony's heels he started on a run for the Bar Y. As they raced
along, now neck and neck, Texas Pete jerked his head back in the
general direction of Hendersville. "What was it all about?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"I jest runded up The Black Coyote," replied Bull.</p>

<p>"Colby?"</p>

<p>Bull nodded. "I ben suspicionin' him," he said, "fer a long time
back, but I couldn't never call the turn on him. Then I runs onto
Gregorio while I'm hidin' out up Coyote Canyon. Him an' Colby ben
workin' together all along, but it seems lately the greaser's found
out Colby's plannin' on double-crossin' him an' goin' south with
all the swag. This was to be the last job, an' Colby fixed it
someway to have a big shipment of gold today, so Gregorio an' me
fixes it an' swaps clothes an' horses an' I takes the greaser's
place. Colby never got onto it at all. He thinks I was the greaser
plumb up to the minute I yanks off the mask."</p>

<p>"I thought Gregorio didn't have no use fer you, Bull," said
Shorty.</p>

<p>"I done him a good turn a spell back." That was all he said
about the fight with the Apaches in Cottonwood Canyon, where he had
risked his life to save the Mexican's.</p>

<p>They rode on in silence for a while. The ranch buildings,
nestling among their trees, were visible in the distance when Texas
Pete called attention to a speck among the sage brush far to the
southeast. To an untrained eye it was scarcely appreciable.</p>

<p>"There's a saddled cayuse," he said. "What fer is it doin' out
yender?"</p>

<p>Bull strained his eyes in the direction of the animal. "Looks
like the L-O sorrel Idaho used to ride," he said.</p>

<p>"Idaho was left home with Miss Di," said Pete.</p>

<p>As one man the three reined toward the distant pony and with
loosened reins tore over the powdery earth, bounding in and out and
over the brush like so many nimble-footed jack rabbits. Blazes,
outdistancing the other ponies, reached the L-O sorrel first. Bull
threw himself from his saddle and kneeled beside the prostrate form
of a man, half hidden in the brush. It was Idaho. As Bull lifted
his head he opened his eyes. He looked at Bull in a bewildered way
for a moment, the expression of his face denoting a concentrated
effort to recall his mental faculties. Then Texas Pete and Shorty
reined in beside him in a cloud of dust and profanity.</p>

<p>"Where's the boss?" demanded Pete.</p>

<p>"What you loafin' out here fer?" inquired Shorty.</p>

<p>Slowly Idaho sat up, assisted by Bull. He looked at the reins
looped about his wrist. He felt of his side and brought his hand
away covered with blood.</p>

<p>"I done the best I could," he said, "but they was too many of
them."</p>

<p>"Where's the boss, you ornery side-winder?" yelled Texas Pete.
"Whose 'them'? What hev they done with her?"</p>

<p>"They was all masked," said Idaho. "I didn't know no more after
they creased me. I dunno what they done with her. Help me aboard
thet cayuse, you bow-legged flannel mouth, an' we'll pull our
freight an' find her, 'stid o' sittin' round here listenin' to your
yap."</p>

<p>Pete, who had dismounted, helped Idaho, almost tenderly, into
the saddle.</p>

<p>"You better beat it fer town," he said. "You ain't much good
no-how an' with a .45 between your ribs you ain't no good
whatsumever."</p>

<p>"Shut up!" Idaho admonished him. "If I was perforated like a
salt cellar I'd be wuth two o' you." He reeled a little in the
saddle, but shook himself and straightened up. It was evident that
he was weak from shock and loss of blood, and that he was suffering
pain beside.</p>

<p>"You'd better go back, Idaho," said Bull. "You ain't in no shape
to ride at all an' I reckon we got some hard ridin' ahead o'
us."</p>

<p>"Go back, you damn fool," said Texas Pete, who, under the cloak
of rough and almost brutal badinage, had sought to hide his real
concern for his friend's welfare.</p>

<p>"Go chase yerselves," replied Idaho. "I'm goin' with you."</p>

<p>They wasted no more time in argument, but started riding a wide
circle, looking for the tracks of the abductors. They found
sufficient evidence to convince them that there had been upward of
a dozen horsemen concerned in the work, which corroborated Idaho's
statement, and that approximately half of these had ridden directly
in the direction of the Bar Y, while the others had taken a
southerly route. It was the latter trail they elected to follow
after Bull discovered upon it the imprint of an iron shoe, and as
Captain, being tender in front, had recently had his fore feet shod
it was safe to assume that they had taken Diana Henders this
way.</p>

<p>They rode fast, for dusk was already on them, and when, a short
time later, it became too dark to distinguish the trail from the
saddle they were often compelled to stop and dismount, and, upon
several occasions, strike matches to make sure that they were still
on the right track. Their progress was, therefore, necessarily
slow. Toward midnight they lost the trail completely. It was there
they left Idaho, too weak from loss of blood to continue.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch18" name="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; THROUGH THE NIGHT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN a back room of The Chicago Saloon Thompson sat
guard over Hal Colby, who was neatly and securely trussed and tied
to a chair, in which he sat. In The Donovan House the guests were
seated at dinner when Gum Smith entered and took his accustomed
place. He had just come from the Bar Y and as the streets of
Hendersville had happened to be deserted at the meal hour he had
met no one.</p>

<p>"'Lo, Gum," greeted Bill Gatlin. "I reckon you hearn we got The
Black Coyote."</p>

<p>"Ah hain't see no one sence Ah reached town," replied Smith,
"but Ah knowed Colby'd git the critter," yet withall he looked a
bit mystified and uneasy. "Whar be he?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He's safe in The Chicago," said Wildcat Bob.</p>

<p>"Ah reckon Ah'd better git him over to the jail," said Gum
Smith.</p>

<p>"I reckon you'll leave him at The Chicago," replied Wildcat. "Do
you know who he is?"</p>

<p>"Bull, o' course."</p>

<p>"Bull, hell&mdash;it's Colby."</p>

<p>Gum Smith paled, just a trifle. "They must be some mistake," he
said, weakly. "Who got him?"</p>

<p>"Bull got him an' they ain't no mistake," said Bill Gatlin. "I
knew all along 'twarn't Bull."</p>

<p>"Well," said Gum Smith, "The Chicago Saloon ain't no place fer a
dangerous prisoner. Soon's Ah've et my victuals Ah'll take him over
to the jail whar he'll be safe."</p>

<p>"I tells you you'll leave him at The Chicago," said Wildcat
Bob.</p>

<p>"Ah'm sheriff o' this yere county," bawled Gum Smith, "an'
nobody don't want to interfere with me in the dis-charge o' mah
duties. Do yo-all hear me, Wildcat Bob?"</p>

<p>"I hears you, but jest like a jack-ass brayin' it don't make no
impression on my onderstandin'," replied Wildcat, embellishing his
remarks with lurid and descriptive profanity. He finished his meal
first and went out. When Gum Smith left The Donovan House he
repaired at once to his own saloon. Here he deputized a half a
dozen loafers, gave each of them several drinks, and led them to
The Chicago Saloon, where he demanded of the proprietor that he
turn over to him, forthwith, the person of Hal Colby, otherwise
known as The Black Coyote.</p>

<p>"He's in the back room yonder," replied the owner of The Chicago
Saloon. "Ef you craves him, go git him. <i>I</i> don't want
him."</p>

<p>In front of the door to the back room sat Wildcat Bob. His
elbows were resting on his knees and from each hand dangled a
.45.</p>

<p>"In the name o' the lawr," piped Gum Smith in his high voice,
"Ah demands the pusson o' one Hal Colby."</p>

<p>"Git the hell outen here, you blankety, blank, blank, blank!"
screamed Wildcat Bob.</p>

<p>"Yo'all better listen to reason, Wildcat Bob," yelled the
sheriff, "or Ah'll have the lawr on yo."</p>

<p>Wildcat Bob, raising his voice yet higher again than that of his
ancient enemy bawled out an incoherent volley of blasphemous and
obscene invective. Gum Smith turned and whispered to one of his
followers, who withdrew from the room with two others. Presently
Gum Smith stepped to one side of the room and, pointing at the
little old man sitting before the locked door, called to his
remaining deputies: "Take him, men&mdash;do yore duty!"</p>

<p>One of the men stepped forward. Wildcat Bob whirled a gun about
his forefinger and without taking aim shot the fellow's hat from
his head. The three stepped back. Almost simultaneously there came
the sound of the crashing of glass from the interior of the room
where Colby was confined, the voice of Thompson raised in protest,
and then shots. Wildcat Bob leaped to his feet and reached for the
knob of the door. As he did so his back was toward the barroom for
an instant and in that instant Gum Smith raised his six-shooter and
fired. Without a word Wildcat Bob crumpled to the floor and lay
there motionless.</p>

<p>Smith and his men leaped for the door. It was locked, and being
a strong door, withstood their combined efforts for several
minutes. When at last it gave before their assault and they stepped
across the threshold they saw only the body of Thompson sprawled
upon the floor in a pool of blood. The Black Coyote was gone.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Surrounded by masked men, her escort shot from his horse, Diana
Henders realized only too well the gravity of her situation and
though she recognized no individual among those who had lain in
ambush for her she guessed well enough that they acted under orders
from Corson. Her note to him revealing the fact that she knew the
entire truth concerning his duplicity and was in possession of the
papers that proved it beyond peradventure of a doubt, had, she
guessed, prompted the desperate adventure in which he pitted all
against all. So suddenly had the masked riders come upon them from
the bed of a dry wash that they had had them covered before either
could draw, yet Idaho, true to the unwritten code of his calling
and his time, had invited death by drawing in the face of their
levelled guns in defense of a woman. Had he been alone, or with
another man, his hands had gone up the moment he had realized that
the odds were all against him, and one of them had gone up, but it
had carried a six-gun with it, and he had been shot out of his
saddle for his chivalry, and left for dead upon the parched ground
as his assailants galloped off toward the south with Diana.</p>

<p>Night fell and yet the men kept on, two riding ahead of Diana
Henders and four behind. They rode rapidly, not sparing their
horses, and from both their haste and the direction of their way
the girl guessed that they were making a try for the border. Once
in the mountains they were forced to a slower gait, and around nine
o'clock they halted for a brief rest where there was water for both
the horses and their riders.</p>

<p>At first Diana had attempted to question them relative to their
intentions, but they would not tell her where they were taking her
and at last silenced her with oaths and threats. Nor did they
remove their masks until darkness equally as well hid their
features from her. This and their almost unbroken silence convinced
her that her abductors were men who feared recognition and
therefore must have been recruited in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>A shrewd guess suggested that an habitué of <i>Gum's
Place&mdash;Liquors and Cigars</i>&mdash;would have recognized them
all. The abduction had therefore been engineered or at least
connived in by the sheriff, and this line of reasoning but
corroborated what was already a foregone conclusion that it had
been done at Corson's behest.</p>

<p>What their purpose with her she could not guess. It might be but
a plan to remove her temporarily to some hidden spot where she
might not further interfere with the plans of the New Yorker, or it
might easily have a more sinister purpose. She knew that Corson
would never be safe in possession of the Bar Y property while she
lived and she did not believe that he was fool enough not to
appreciate that fact; but would he dare to have her done away with?
She wondered.</p>

<p>It was after midnight when they crossed the summit, at a point
where there appeared not the slightest vestige of a trail, and
dropped down a dangerous and rocky declivity into a wooded canyon.
A dozen times the girl's life was in jeopardy&mdash;her only
safeguard the agility and sure-footedness of Captain. A half hour
later the canyon widened into a little pocket in the mountains and
here they stopped again. Through the gloom of the deep gorge her
eyes finally distinguished the outlines of a small cabin.</p>

<p>The men dismounted. "Get down," said one of them to Diana, and
when she had done so the fellow took her by the arm, with a gruff,
"Come along!" and led her toward the shack. He pushed open the door
and told her to enter. Following behind her, he struck a match,
revealing a single room, rudely furnished with a table, a few
benches and a couple of cots, all constructed in rustic fashion
from branches of the trees which grew about the place. On the table
was a candle holder and a candle, which the man lighted. At one end
of the room was a blackened fireplace above which a long shelf
supported a few small boxes and cans. On pegs, flanking the
fireplace, were crude cooking utensils&mdash;a frying pan, a stew
pan and a coffee pot, while a larger kettle, for heating water,
squatted in the ashes of the dirty hearth.</p>

<p>The other men came in presently. All were masked again. One of
them took the kettle and went out, returning shortly with water.
Another brought wood and then a third set about preparing a meal.
They had brought some flour and bacon with them. There were baking
powder, salt, pepper and sugar in the cans upon the mantel shelf,
together with one of coffee and another of tea.</p>

<p>The aroma of cooking food awoke Diana to a realization of the
fact that she was hungry. Her situation, while grave, had not as
yet reached a point that she might consider dangerous. The attitude
of the men had been determined, albeit somewhat nervous, yet never
at any time actually menacing. What they had done had evidently
been accomplished under orders from some person or persons who were
taking no active part in the actual abduction&mdash;who were not
even present when the thing was done nor now that they had reached
this hiding place in the mountains.</p>

<p>Diana Henders was more or less familiar with these southern
hills and she knew that she never had been in this spot before.
What an ideal place it would be to commit and effectually hide all
traces of a crime! She put such unpleasant thoughts from her and
turned her attention to the bacon sizzling upon the hearth the
while it filled the room with its delicious aroma. She was given a
portion of the food and, seated upon one of the rude cots, devoured
it ravenously. Her fears, of what ever magnitude they might be, had
not spoiled her appetite, nor did she show in any other outward
manner that she was afraid, either of her abductors or
contemplation of the fate that awaited her.</p>

<p>The meal over, one of the men arose and left the cabin. From the
monosyllabic conversation that ensued she gathered that he had been
sent back along their route to a point where he could act as
sentinel and thus safeguard them from surprise. They did not appear
to expect pursuit, but took this precaution, evidently, in
accordance with orders previously received, or a plan
prearranged.</p>

<p>After the meal the men smoked for a while and then, one by one,
lay down upon the rough boards to sleep, so disposing themselves
that the girl could not approach either the door or the single
window without disturbing one or more of them. The last man blew
out the candle before he lay down. Diana Henders stretched herself
at length upon the rough branches that formed the bottom of one of
the cots and tried to sleep. How long she lay awake she did not
know, but eventually she fell into a light slumber, from which she
was awakened about three in the morning by the sound of horses'
feet on the ground outside the cabin. Then she heard men's voices,
speaking in subdued tones. A sudden premonition seized
her&mdash;rescue was at hand! She heard the door open and
immediately two of the men upon the floor awoke and sat up.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" demanded one.</p>

<p>"Me," replied one of the newcomers. "The rest o' you fellers
wake up&mdash;we got to get outta here." He stepped to the table,
struck a match and lighted the candle. In its first flare Diana
recognized his figure as that of the man who had gone out after the
meal to act as guard along the trail&mdash;the man with him was Hal
Colby.</p>

<p>"Put out that light, you damn fool!" cried one of the awakened
sleepers. "Do you want this girl to reco'nize us all?" The light
went out, quickly. Hal Colby stepped across the room to her
side.</p>

<p>"Everything's all right, Di," he said. "I've come for you."</p>

<p>The other man was speaking to his fellows. "They's someone on
our trail&mdash;Colby passed them on the cut-off. He'd ben ridin'
behind 'em fer an hour. He says they's three o' 'em. We gotta git
out." Hastily the men rose and sought their horses. Colby took
Diana by the arm.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said. "I'll get you out o' here."</p>

<p>"Why should I want to get out when someone is coming to take me
away from these men?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"But I'm here&mdash;I'll take you out, Di. Come, we must
hurry."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No! I shall stay here."</p>

<p>"They won't let you&mdash;they'll take you along. You had better
come with me. I am your friend."</p>

<p>"You cannot be a friend of their's and mine, both."</p>

<p>He took her by the arm again. "Come! This is no time for
fooling."</p>

<p>She struggled to free herself and when he attempted to drag her
forcibly she struck him in the face with a clenched fist.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;!" he cried, applying a vile epithet to her. "You'll
come, damn you," and he picked her up and carried her out into the
waning night.</p>

<p>Most of the men had found their horses and mounted. "Where's her
horse?" demanded Colby of one of them, and when it was led forward
he threw her roughly into the saddle and with her own reata he
bound her there. Then he mounted his own animal and, leading her's,
started down the rough and wooded gorge toward the South.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>A few miles away three men drew rein upon a ridge. "We've lost
the damn trail agin," muttered Texas Pete, sourly.</p>

<p>Bull sat erect upon Blazes, his head thrown far back, his
nostrils dilated.</p>

<p>"What you lookin' up yender fer?" demanded Shorty. "The trail
thet bunch o' short-horn's on don't lead to heavin."</p>

<p>"Smell it?" asked Bull.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Wood smoke! They's a east wind. Come on!" He rode blindly
through the darkness, trusting to the instinct and the eyesight of
his horse, toward the east and the fire from which that tenuous
suggestion of wood smoke emanated. Where there was fire there
should be man&mdash;thus reasoned Bull.</p>

<p>A half hour later the three slid and rolled with their horses
down the steep side of a gorge into a cup-like opening in the hills
and before them, in the growing dawn, they saw a mean, weatherworn
shack. From the crumbling chimney a thin wisp of smoke arose into
the still air, to be wafted gently westward after it had topped the
summit of the canyon walls. They hid their horses among the trees
and the under-brush and crept stealthily toward the building from
three sides. Bull was the first to come into the open and as he did
so he stood erect and sprang toward the doorway of the building,
bursting into the interior with two guns ready in his hands. The
place was empty. Embers smouldered upon the dirty hearth. A greasy
frying pan lay upon the floor at one side, a kettle half filled
with warm water upon the other. There was the odor of cigarette
smoke in the air of the single room.</p>

<p>"They ben here, but they's gone," said Bull as his two friends
joined him.</p>

<p>"They ain't ben gone long," said Shorty.</p>

<p>They found the trail leading down the canyon and followed it,
while a few miles ahead Colby and Diana with the six masked men
debouched upon the wide flat at the foot of the hills. Here they
halted.</p>

<p>"One o' you fellers swap horses with the girl," commanded Colby,
"and then you all circle back to the west an' north an' hit the
high spots fer Hendersville. Here, Grift, you take her horse."</p>

<p>"How come?" demanded Grift.</p>

<p>"Why to lead the folks back at Hendersville offen the trail, o'
course," replied Colby. "You'll tell 'em you found her horse tother
side o' the West Ranch an' they'll look there 'til the cows comes
home."</p>

<p>Grift, satisfied with this explanation, dismounted and took
Diana's horse, after which she was bound to the one he had
quitted.</p>

<p>"Now beat it!" said Colby. "I'll take care o' the girl," and he
started off toward the south, while the others turned westward.</p>

<p>"I reckon I fooled 'em," remarked Colby when the others were out
of hearing.</p>

<p>Diana made no reply.</p>

<p>"Them three hombres is trailin' you, Di," he continued, "an'
they'll be jest wise enough to foller Captain's tracks. I reckon I
fooled 'em fine. Grift never would o' swapped horses ef he'd
a-knowed what my reason was."</p>

<p>Diana said nothing. She did not even look at him. They rode on
in silence then for some time.</p>

<p>"Look here, Di," he exclaimed finally. "You might as well come
down offen your high horse. You're mine now an' I'm a-goin' to keep
you&mdash;as long as I want you. I'm rich now. I'll git all the
money I wants from Lillian, but you're the one I love&mdash;you're
the one I want and you're the one I'm a-goin' to have. After I gits
all o' Lillian's money I'll quit her an' you an' me'll do some
travelin', but in the meantime I gotta marry her to git the money.
Sabe?"</p>

<p>"Cur!" muttered Diana, shuddering.</p>

<p>"Well, ef you wants to belong to a cur, call me one," he said,
laughing, "'cause you're goin' to belong to me after today. You
won't never want to go back then. You thought you'd turn me down,
did you? You wanted that dirty damn bandit, didn't cha? Well, you
won't never git him. If he isn't follerin' you with the three
thet's behind us he won't never catch up to us this side o' the
border, an' after that he couldn't never find us in a hundred
years. If he is with them he'll foller the Captain's hoof-prints
until he catches up with 'em an' then that bunch o' bad-uns'll
shoot him full o' holes. I guess maybe I wasn't foolin' the whole
bunch on 'em, eh?"</p>

<p>Diana Henders looked her unutterable contempt and loathing.
Colby fell silent after a bit, seeing that it was impossible to
draw the girl into conversation. Thus they continued on for miles.
Suddenly, from far away toward the north, came, just barely audible
to their ears, faintly the sound of distant fire arms.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Bull and his pals had come upon the six. There had been no
preliminary&mdash;no questions asked. The three had but put spurs
to their horses and overtaken the fleeing abductors, who, their
work done, had no desire to enter into an argument with anyone. The
moment he thought that he was within safe range Bull had opened up
with a single gun, and at the first shot a man had tumbled from his
saddle. It was a running fight from then on until but a single one
of the six remained. Holding one hand far above his head he reined
in his jaded mount, at the same time letting his gun fall to the
ground. Bull drew up beside him.</p>

<p>"Where's Miss Henders?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I don't know nothin' about her&mdash;I ain't seen her."</p>

<p>"You lie," said Bull, in a low voice. "You're riding her horse
now. Where is she? I'll give you five seconds to answer before I
send you to hell."</p>

<p>"Colby taken her&mdash;South&mdash;toward the border," cried
Grift, and Bull wondered, for he had left the man safely in
Hendersville.</p>

<p>"You take thet horse home, Grift," said Bull, "to the Bar Y. Ef
you've lied to me about Miss Henders, or ef thet horse ain't in a
Bar Y corral when I gets back, I bore you. Sabe?"</p>

<p>Grift nodded.</p>

<p>"Now beat it," said Bull, and reined about toward the South.</p>

<p>Again the hard, pitiless grind commenced. Beneath a scorching
sun, over blistering alkali flats, the three urged their weary
horses on.</p>

<p>"You gotta make it, Blazes. You gotta make it," whispered Bull
in the ear of his pony. "She cain't be much ahead, an' there ain't
nothin' can step away from me an' you, Blazes, forever. We'll catch
up with 'em some day."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch19" name="ch19">XIX. &mdash; "TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE
ME!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT was ten o'clock that morning before Bull, Texas
Pete and Shorty picked up Colby's trail and by that time the man
and his unwilling companion were a good four hours ahead of them.
On tired horses, through the heat of a blazing Arizona day, it
seemed hopeless to expect to overhaul their quarry before night had
fallen and by that time Colby would have crossed the border. Not
however that that meant much to the three who pursued him, to whom
international boundary lines were of no more practical import than
parallels of latitude or isothermal lines.</p>

<p>Before noon they were obliged to stop and rest their horses at a
water hole that afforded a brackish but refreshing drink for the
three jaded animals. In the mud at its border they saw the fresh
tracks of Colby's pony and Diana's. It was evident that they had
stopped here for a considerable time, which, in truth, they had, so
positive was Colby that he had thrown their pursuers off the track,
leading them into a gun fight with a superior force that might
reasonably have been expected to have accounted for them to the
last man.</p>

<p>Five minutes was all the rest that the pursuers allowed their
horses. Once again they were in the saddle. "Lookee yender!"
exclaimed Texas Pete, pointing toward the south. "Ef it ain't
rainin' there I'm a siwash."</p>

<p>"It's about a month too early for the rains," said Bull, "but it
shore is rainin'&mdash;rainin' like hell. Look at thet lightnin'.
Say, if they ain't crossed Salee's Flats yet they won't never git
acrost, not while thet rain lasts."</p>

<p>"'N' if they has crossed we won't never catch 'em," said
Shorty.</p>

<p>"I'll catch 'em ef I hev to ride plumb to hell an' it takes me a
hundred years," said Bull.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The rain struck Colby and Diana at the northern edge of the
Flats. It came in driving sheets and sometimes in solid masses that
almost crushed them. It came with deafening reverberations of
Titanic thunder and vivid, almost terrifying, displays of
lightning. It was bad where they were, but Colby knew from
experience of the country that in the low hills at the upper end of
the Flats it was infinitely worse&mdash;that there had been a cloud
burst. He put spurs to his horse and dragging Diana's into a gallop
urged them both to greater speed, knowing that if he did not cross
the wash in the center of the Flats within a few minutes he might
not cross it again for days. When they reached it three feet of
turbid water tumbled madly down the narrow bed between the
precipitous clay walls. The man found a steep path that stock had
made for crossing when the bed of the wash was dry and urged his
horse downward. The force of the current almost swept the animal
from its feet, but with wide spread legs it stemmed the torrent,
while Colby, taking a few turns of the lead rope around his horn,
dragged Diana's pony through in safety after him. At the top of the
bank the man turned and looked toward the north and then down at
the rising flood.</p>

<p>"If this rain holds out they won't nothin' more cross here fer a
spell," he said, smiling. "In ten minutes she'll be plumb full. We
kin take it easier now."</p>

<p>He started off again, but now at a walk, for he knew that there
was no longer need for haste, if there had been before, which he
had doubted. The horses, cooled and refreshed by the rain, would
have been equal to a spurt now, but none was necessary, and so they
came after a mile to the dim outlines of an adobe house showing
through the driving downpour, directly ahead. Colby rode close to
the door, and leaning from his saddle, pounded upon it. There was
no reply.</p>

<p>"I reckon we'll stop here a while," he said, dismounting.</p>

<p>He opened the door and looked in. The place was deserted. In
rear of it was an open shed for stock and to this they rode. Colby
helped Diana from her horse, removed the saddles and bridles from
the animals and tied them beneath the shed, then he led the girl to
the house, her arms still bound by her reata. There was no chance
that she could escape now, so the man removed her bonds.</p>

<p>"We'll rest here a few hours an' give the horses a chance, then
we'll hit the trail. We gotta find a place where we kin feed, my
belly's wrapped around my back-bone. Let's be friends, Di. You
might as well make the best of it. You cain't blame a feller fer
lovin' you, an' I ain't so bad&mdash;you might a-done a lot worse."
He came toward her and raised his hand as though to place it on her
arm.</p>

<p>"Don't touch me!" She drew back with an appreciable shudder of
revulsion.</p>

<p>He laughed. "You'll feel better after a while," he said. "We're
both too dog tired to be very good company. I'm goin' to get in a
little sleep. You'd better do the same; but I'll have to tie you up
again unless you'll promise not to try to escape."</p>

<p>She made no reply. "All right," he said, "ef you'd rather be
tied." He came then and tied her hands behind her. Keeping one end
of the rope in his own hand he lay down upon the dirt floor and was
soon asleep. Diana sat with her back against the wall listening to
the rain beating upon the roof and driving against the walls. The
roof leaked badly in several places and the water that came through
formed puddles on the floor which joined together into a little
rivulet that wound to the doorway and disappeared beneath the
door.</p>

<p>How hopeless! Diana stifled a sob. She was tired and hungry and
weak from exhaustion. The frightful rain had cut off the frail
vestige of a chance of rescue that there had been before. By now no
man or beast could cross Salee's Flats. She knew one man who would
try had he known of her predicament, but how was he to know of
it&mdash;a hunted fugitive hiding in the mountains far to the
north.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Realizing the necessity for haste if they were to cross the
Flats before the wash became an impassable torrent, the three
pursuers drove their tired horses onward at the top of their
diminished speed. The race became at once a test for the survival
of the fittest, and Blazes forged steadily farther and farther
ahead of the other ponies. Long before Bull reached the Flats the
rain was upon him, refreshing both horse and man, and Blazes, as
though imbued with new life, increased the distance between himself
and the two ponies now far behind. The driving rain was rapidly
obliterating the trail that the man followed, yet he managed to
cling to it to the very brink of the wash&mdash;to the very point
where Colby and Diana had crossed, and there Bull drew rein to look
down, scowling, upon a seething barrier of yellow water. Twenty
feet wide it was and ten feet deep, swirling and boiling like a
cauldron of hell. He eyed the greasy, muddy footing of the bank.
Had it been firm and dry he had put Blazes to it for a jump, but he
knew that it could not be done now, nor could he swim the horse.
Even could the animal have made the crossing it could not have
clambered out upon the top of that perpendicular, constantly caving
wall, with the mighty current always dragging at it. But Bull was
not hopeless&mdash;he was merely devising ways and means. Not for
an instant had he considered the possibility of giving up the
pursuit, or even of delaying it by waiting for the waters to
recede. Taking his rope in his hand he dismounted and stepped close
to the brink of the torrent, upon both sides of which grew numerous
clumps of grease-wood. He seemed already to have formed a plan, for
he drew one of his six-guns and hurled it across the wash. He
followed it with the second gun and then with his heavy belt of
cartridges. Then came his boots, one by one.</p>

<p>Shaking down the honda he swung a noose at the end of his rope,
which, opening up, described a circle that seemed to revolve about
his head at an angle of forty-five degrees with the ground, like a
rakish halo&mdash;just for an instant, and then it rose and sailed
gracefully across the new-born river to drop around a clump of
grease-wood upon the opposite bank.</p>

<p>"Come here!" said Bull to Blazes, and the horse stepped to his
side, close to the water's edge. "Stand!" commanded Bull, knowing
that Blazes would stand where he was for hours, if necessary, until
his master gave a new order.</p>

<p>Bull drew in his rope until it became taut and then he dragged
heavily upon the grease-wood across the channel. It held despite
his most strenuous efforts. He tied the loose end about his waist,
stepped to the very edge of the water and leaped in.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Hal Colby awoke and looked about him. His eyes fell upon the
girl sitting with her back against the wall across the room.</p>

<p>"Feelin' better?" he asked. "I am. Nothin' like sleep, onless it
be grub."</p>

<p>She did not reply. He rose to his feet and approached her.
"You're shore a sullen little devil, but I'll take that out o'
you&mdash;a little lovin'll do that. Git up an' kiss me!"</p>

<p>"You unspeakable&mdash;THING! It would be an insult to a cur to
call you that."</p>

<p>Colby laughed good-naturedly. "Ef you'd ruther have a bandit, I
might turn one," he said, and again he laughed, this time at his
own joke.</p>

<p>"If you are trying to suggest that I would prefer Bull, you are
right. You may thank God that he is not here&mdash;but he will
come&mdash;and you will pay."</p>

<p>"Well, you ain't got up and kissed me yet," said Colby. "Do you
want me to yank you up? You got a lot to learn an' I'm the hombre
what can learn you. I've hed a lot o' experience&mdash;I've tamed
'em before, as good as you. Tamed 'em an' made 'em like it. If it
cain't be done one way, it can another. Sometimes a quirt helps."
He struck his chaps with the lash of the one he carried. "Git up,
you!" He seized her by the arm and jerked her roughly to her feet.
Again she struck him, and this time the man struck back&mdash;a
stinging blow across her shoulders with the quirt. "I'll learn
you!" he cried.</p>

<p>She tried to free herself, striking him repeatedly, but he held
her off and lashed her cruelly, nor did he appear to care where the
quirt fell.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The tumbling waters, engulfing Bull, rolled him over and over
before, half drowned, his powerful strokes succeeded in raising his
head above the surface. He had had no conception of the tremendous
strength of the current. He was but as a bobbing bit of flotsam
upon its surface. He could not stem it. He was helpless. The rope
about his waist suddenly tautened and he was again dragged beneath
the surface. He grasped it with his hands and tried to pull himself
in toward shore, but the giant waters held him in their grip,
dragging him downward, stronger by far than the strength of many
men.</p>

<p>Suddenly the muddy flood spewed him to the surface once
more&mdash;this time against the bank to which the opposite end of
his rope was fastened and was dragging heavily upon its precarious
anchor. He clutched at the slippery, red mud, clawing frantically
for a hand-hold. The waters leaped upon him and beat him down, but
still he fought on valiantly, not for his life but for the girl he
loved, and at last he won, dragging himself slowly out upon the
bank. Almost exhausted he rose, staggering, to his feet and looked
back across the torrent at Blazes.</p>

<p>"It ain't no use, boy," he said, with a shake of his head. "I
was a-goin' to rope you an' drag you acrost, but it cain't be did.
Now I reckon I'll hev to hoof it."</p>

<p>He sat down in the mud and pulled on his boots, gathered up his
guns and belt, coiled his rope and turned his face southward. "Ef
it takes a hundred years an' I hev to foller him plumb to hell," he
muttered, "I'll git him!"</p>

<p>Still spent and blowing from his tremendous exertions against
the flood, he staggered on through the sticky clay and the blinding
rain, his head bent down against the storm. It was hard work, but
never once did a thought of surrender enter his mind. He would find
a ranch house somewhere and get a horse&mdash;he might even come
upon some range stock. He had his lariat and there was a bare
chance that he might get close enough to an animal to rope it. But
he must have a horse! He felt helpless&mdash;entirely
impotent&mdash;without one.</p>

<p>Imagine yourself thrust into a cold and unfriendly world, if you
are a man, without a pocket knife, a bunch of keys, a handkerchief,
money, or a pair of shoes and you will be able to appreciate how a
cowboy feels without a horse.</p>

<p>Thus, buffeted by the storm, he shouldered on until suddenly
there loomed almost directly in his path the outlines of an adobe
house. Fortune smiled upon him! Here he would find a horse! He
stepped to the door and was about to knock when he heard the voice
of a woman crying out in protestation and pain. Then he flung the
door wide and stepped into the interior. Colby, holding Diana's
wrist, was twisting it in an excess of rage, for she had struck him
and repulsed him until the last vestige of his thin veneer of
manhood had fallen from him, leaving exposed the raw, primordial
beast.</p>

<p>He saw Bull the instant that the latter opened the door and
swinging the girl in front of him reached for a gun. Diana, too,
saw the figure in the doorway. A great wave of joy swept through
her, and then she saw Colby's gun flash from its holster and knew
that Bull could not shoot because of fear of hitting her; but she
did not know Bull as well as she thought she knew him, and
similarly was Colby deceived, for the man in the doorway fired from
the hip the instant that Colby's gun was raised. The weapon fell
from nerveless fingers, the grasp upon Diana's wrist relaxed, and
Hal Colby pitched forward upon his face, a bullet hole between his
eyes.</p>

<p>Diana swayed for an instant, dazed by the wonder of her
deliverance, and then as Bull stepped toward her she went to meet
him and put her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>"Bull!" It was half a sob. The man took her in his arms.</p>

<p>"Diana!" The word carried all the reverence of a
benediction.</p>

<p>Raising her face from his shoulder she pushed him away a little.
"Bull," she said, "once you told me that you loved me. Tell me so
again."</p>

<p>"'Love' don't tell the half of it, girl," he said, his voice
husky with emotion.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bull," she cried, "I have been such a fool. I love you! I
have always loved you, but I did not know it until that
night&mdash;the night they came after you at the West Ranch."</p>

<p>"But you couldn't love me, Diana, thinkin' I was The Black
Coyote!"</p>

<p>"I don't care, Bull, what you are. All I care or know is that
you are my man. We will go away together and start over
again&mdash;will you, Bull, for my sake?"</p>

<p>And then he told her that he didn't have to go away&mdash;told
her who The Black Coyote had been.</p>

<p>"Why, he even planted one o' the bullion sacks under my bed-roll
at The West Ranch to prove I was the right hombre," said Bull. "Saw
a sack o' dust I brung from Idaho, an' he tried to make 'em think
it was yours. He used to send me off alone the days he was a-goin'
to hold up the stage, so's when the time was ripe he could throw
suspicion on me. He shore was a clever feller, Hal was."</p>

<p>"But the day Mack was wounded?" she asked. "We saw you coming in
from the north and there was blood on your shirt."</p>

<p>"I got in a brush with Apaches up Cottonwood, me an' Gregorio,
an' I got scratched. 'Twasn't nothin'."</p>

<p>"And to think that all the time he was professing friendship for
you he was trying to make me believe that you were The Black
Coyote," cried Diana. "He was worse than Mr. Corson and I thought
him about the wickedest man I had ever known."</p>

<p>"We gotta think about gittin' back an' havin' a friendly pow-wow
with thet there Corson gent," said Bull. "By golly, the sun's out!
Everything's happy, Diana, now thet you're safe."</p>

<p>They walked to the doorway. The rain had stopped as suddenly as
it had begun, and now the fierce sun blazed down upon the steaming
mud.</p>

<p>"Where's your horses?" asked Bull.</p>

<p>"In a shed behind the house."</p>

<p>"Good! We'll start along. They's a bridge twenty-five miles
below here ef I ain't mistaken. I think I know this here shack. I
was down this way two year ago."</p>

<p>"But what about him?" She nodded back toward the body of
Colby.</p>

<p>"He kin rot here fer all I care," said Bull,
bitterly&mdash;"a-hurtin' you! God, I wisht he had nine lives like
a cat, so's I could kill him a few more times."</p>

<p>She closed the door behind them. "We'll have to notify Gum
Smith, so they can send down and bury him."</p>

<p>"Gum Smith won't never get the chanct," he said.</p>

<p>They walked to the shed and he saddled the two horses, rested
now and refreshed a little by the past hours of relief from the
heat, and after they had mounted and ridden half way to the wash
they saw the figures of two men upon the opposite bank.</p>

<p>"Texas Pete and Shorty," he told her. They recognized the girl
and Bull and whooped and shouted in the exuberance of youth and
joy.</p>

<p>It was a hard ride to the bridge through the heavy mud, but it
was made at last and then the four joined upon the same side and
set out toward home, picking up Idaho en route, still weak, but
able to sit a horse.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>It was two days later before they rode into the Bar Y ranch
yard, where they were met with wild acclaim by Willie, Wong and the
men's cook.</p>

<p>"Where's Corson?" demanded Bull.</p>

<p>"The whole bunch has gone to town to close the deal. They was
some hitch the other day. Wong said he heard 'em talkin'. Corson
wouldn't take nothin' but gold an' Wainright had to send up to
Aldea fer it. They say it's comin' in on today's stage."</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to town," announced Bull.</p>

<p>"So am I," said Diana.</p>

<p>"We'll all go," said Shorty.</p>

<p>"Git us up some fresh horses, Willie," said Texas Pete. Then he
turned to Diana. "You ain't said yit thet I ain't foreman no more."
They both smiled.</p>

<p>"Not yet, Pete. I'll have to talk it over with Bull," said
Diana.</p>

<p>Remounted, they galloped off toward Hendersville&mdash;all but
Idaho. Him they left behind, much to his disgust, for he needed
rest.</p>

<p>They reached town half an hour after the stage had pulled in
and, entering The Donovan House, found Corson, Lillian Manill, the
two Wainrights, together with the attorney from Aldea and Gum
Smith.</p>

<p>At sight of Bull, Gum Smith leaped to his feet. "Yo'all's undah
arrest!" he squealed.</p>

<p>"What fer?" asked Bull.</p>

<p>"Fer robbin' the United States Mail, thet's what fer."</p>

<p>"Hold your horses, Gum," admonished Bull, "I ain't quite ready
fer you yet. I craves conversation with these here dudes fust." He
turned to the elder Wainright. "You was honin' to pay a hundred and
twenty-five thousand dollars to this here dude fer the Bar Y?"</p>

<p>"'Tain't none o' yore business," snapped Wainright.</p>

<p>Bull laid a hand upon the butt of one of his guns. "Does I hev
to run you out o' Hendersville to git a civil answer?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>Wainright paled. "I've paid already, an' the Bar Y's mine," he
answered, surlily.</p>

<p>"You've ben stung. Them two's crooks. The girl ain't no relation
to Miss Henders' uncle an' we got the papers to prove it. We got
the will, too, thet this skunk tried to git hold of an' destroy.
Leastwise Miss Henders had 'em, but she sent 'em to Kansas City
before Corson could git holt of 'em. Texas Pete, here, took 'em to
Aldea. That's why you didn't find 'em in the office, Corson, when
you robbed the safe. Wong saw you and told us about it just before
we left the ranch today. All you got was the copies she made. I
don't wonder you wanted gold from Wainright."</p>

<p>"He's lyin'," cried Corson to Wainright. "Do you believe what a
fellow like he is says? Why, he'll be in a federal penitentiary
inside another month for robbing the mail. There isn't a jury on
earth would take his word for anything."</p>

<p>"I ain't there yit an' no more I don't expect to be," said
Bull.</p>

<p>"Yo'all's undah arrest, jes the same, right now," cried Gum
Smith, "an' Ah warns yo to come along peaceable-like with me."</p>

<p>"Now I'm comin' to you, Gum," said Bull. "You better beat it,
Gum. You ain't wuth shootin', with catridges the price they be," he
continued. "Gregorio has told me the whole story. He's goin'
straight now an' he wants to square himself. He's writ out an'
signed a confession thet's goin' to make this climate bad fer your
rheumatism."</p>

<p>"Gregorio's a dirty, lyin' greaser," screamed Gum. "They won't
no one bulieve him neither. They ain't no one got the goods on
me."</p>

<p>"No," said Bull, "but you have. Nearly every ounce of thet
gold&mdash;except what you an' Colby spent an' what little you giv
Gregorio's buried underneath the floor of the back room o' your
saloon, an' me an' Pete an' Shorty's right here to see thet no
hombre don't git it what don't belong to it."</p>

<p>Gum Smith paled. "'Tain't so! It's a damn lie!"</p>

<p>"Thet's the second time I ben called a liar in five minutes,"
said Bull. "I ain't did nothin' 'cause they's ladies present, but
I'm goin' to send 'em outen the room in a minute an' then we'll
talk about thet&mdash;ef you're still here. I'd advise you not to
be, though. Wainright, I seen your buckboard tied out in front
here. By crowdin' it'll hold five&mdash;meanin' you, thet ornery
lookin' dude son o' yourn, Corson, Miss Manill an' Gum. You all be
in it an' hittin' the trail north fer tother side o' the hill
inside o' five minutes or me an' the boys is goin' to start
shootin'. On the way, Wainright, you an' Corson kin settle thet
little matter o' the hundred an' twenty-five thousand. Ef you kin
git it back from him 'tain't nothin' to me, but ef you don't you
deserve to lose it, fer you're jest as big a thief as he is, only
not quite so bright in the head. Now git, an' git damn pronto!" His
voice had suddenly changed from mocking irony to grim earnestness.
It was a savage voice that uttered the final command. Gum Smith was
the first out of the room. He was followed by the others. "See 'em
to the edge of town, boys, an' see that they don't linger," said
Bull to Shorty an' Texas Pete.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma!" exclaimed Shorty. "Lead me to them funny
pants!"</p>

<p>Bull turned to the attorney from Aldea. "I ain't got no proof
thet you were in on this deal," he said; "so you kin wait an' go in
on the stage tomorrer."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said the attorney. "No, I thought it a perfectly
legitimate transaction; but I am glad they called me down, for now
perhaps I can transact some real business for some other clients of
mine. I had not been aware that the Bar Y was for sale, or I had
been over here before. I represent a large syndicate of eastern
packers whom I know would be interested in this property, and if
Miss Henders will make me a proposition I shall be glad to transmit
it to them&mdash;you will find them very different people to deal
with than these others seem to have been."</p>

<p>"I thank you," said Diana, "but the Bar Y is not for sale. We
are going to run the ranch together, aren't we, Bull?"</p>

<p>"You bet we are," he replied.</p>

<p>Mary Donovan burst from an inner room at that moment. "Bliss me
heart!" she exclaimed. "An' I niver knew you was here 'til this
very minute, an' I heard what yese jest said, Diana Henders, an'
I'm not after bein' such a fool that I don't know what yese means.
It makes me that happy, God bless ye! I must be after runnin' in
an' tellin' me ould man&mdash;he'll be that glad, he will."</p>

<p>"Your old man!" exclaimed Diana.</p>

<p>"Sure now," said Mary Donovan, blushing, "didn't yese know 'at
me an' Bob was married the day before yisterday? Shure they had to
shoot him before I c'd git him. He niver was much, an' havin' a
bullet hole clean through him don't make him no better, but thin
he's a man, an' a poor one's better than none at all."</p>
