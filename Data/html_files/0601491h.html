  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1">I. &mdash; DOARTY MAKES A "PINCH"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Just what Mr. Doarty was doing in the alley back of Farris's
  at two of a chill spring morning would have puzzled those citizens of Chicago
  who knew Mr. Doarty best.</p>

  <p>To a casual observer it might have appeared that Mr. Doarty was doing
  nothing more remarkable than leaning against a telephone pole, which in
  itself might have been easily explained had Mr. Doarty not been so palpably
  sober; but there are no casual observers in the South Side levee at two in
  the morning&mdash;those who are in any condition to observe at all have the
  eyes of ferrets.</p>

  <p>This was not the first of Mr. Doarty's nocturnal visits to the vicinage of
  Farris's. For almost a week he had haunted the neighborhood between midnight
  and dawn, for Mr. Doarty had determined to "get" Mr. Farris.</p>

  <p>From the open doors of a corner saloon came bursts of bacchanal
  revelry&mdash;snatches of ribald song; hoarse laughter; the hysterical scream
  of a woman; but though this place, too, was Farris's and the closing hour
  long passed Mr. Doarty deigned not to notice so minor an infraction of the
  law.</p>

  <p>Hadn't Lieutenant Barnut filed some ninety odd complaints against the
  saloon-keeper-alderman of the Eighteenth Ward for violation of this same
  ordinance, only to have them all pigeonholed in the city prosecutor's office?
  Hadn't he appeared in person before the September Grand Jury, and hadn't the
  state Attorney's office succeeded in bamboozling that August body into the
  belief that they had nothing whatsoever to do with the matter?</p>

  <p>An anyhow, what was an aldermanic drag compared with that possessed by
  "Abe" Farris? No; Mr. Doarty, had you questioned him, would have assured you
  that he had not been born so recently as yesterday; that he was entirely dry
  behind the ears; and that if he "got" Mr. Farris at all he would get him good
  and plenty, for had he not only a week before, learning that Mr. Doarty was
  no longer in the good graces of his commanding officer, refused to
  acknowledge Mr. Doarty's right to certain little incidental emoluments upon
  which time-honored custom had placed the seal of lawful title?</p>

  <p>In other words&mdash;Mr. Doarty's words&mdash;Abe Farris had not come
  across. Not only had he failed in this very necessary obligation, but he had
  added insult to injury by requesting Mr. Doarty to hie himself to the
  celestial nadir; and he had made his remarks in a loud, coarse tone of voice
  in the presence of a pock-marked barkeep who had it in for Mr. Doarty because
  of a certain sixty, weary, beerless days that the pock-marked one had spent
  at the Bridewell on Mr. Doarty's account.</p>

  <p>But the most malign spleen becomes less virulent with age, and so it was
  that Mr. Doarty found his self-appointed task becoming irksome to a degree
  that threatened the stability of his Machiavellian resolve. Furthermore, he
  was becoming sleepy and thirsty.</p>

  <p>"T' 'ell with 'im," sighed Mr. Doarty, sadly, as he removed his weight
  from the supporting pole to turn disconsolately toward the mouth of the
  alley.</p>

  <p>At the third step he turned to cast a parting, venomous glance at the back
  of Farris's; but he took no fourth step toward the alley's mouth. Instead he
  dissolved, wraithlike, into the dense shadow between two barns, his eyes
  never leaving the back of the building that he had watched so assiduously and
  fruitlessly for the past several nights.</p>

  <p>In the back of Farris's is a rickety fire escape&mdash;a mute, decaying
  witness to the lack of pull under which some former landlord labored. Toward
  this was Mr. Doarty's gaze directed, for dimly discernible upon it was
  something that moved&mdash;moved slowly and cautiously downward.</p>

  <p>It required but a moment for Mr. Doarty's trained eye to transmit to his
  eager brain all that he required to know, for the moment at least, of the
  slow-moving shadow upon the shadowy ladder&mdash;then he darted across the
  alley toward the yard in the rear of Farris's.</p>

  <p>A girl was descending the fire escape. How frightened she was she alone
  knew and that there must have been something very dreadful to escape in the
  building above her was apparent from the risk she took at each step upon that
  loose and rusted fabric of sagging iron.</p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0601491h-images/TheGirlFromFarriss-02.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>She was clothed in a flowered kimono, over which she had drawn a black
  silk underskirt. Around her shoulders was an old red shawl, and she was shod
  only in bedroom slippers. Scarcely a suitable attire for street wear; but
  then people in the vicinity of Twenty-Fourth Street are not over particular
  about such matters; especially those who elect to leave their bed and board
  at two of a morning by way of a back fire escape.</p>

  <p>At the first floor the ladder ended&mdash;a common and embarrassing habit
  of fire escape ladders, which are as likely as not to terminate twenty feet
  above a stone areaway, or a picket fence&mdash;but the stand pipe continued
  on to the ground. A stand pipe, flat against a brick wall, is not an easy
  thing for a young lady in a flowered kimono and little else to negotiate; but
  this was an unusual young lady, and great indeed must have been the stress of
  circumstance which urged her on, for she came down the stand pipe with the
  ease of a cat, and at the bottom, turned, horrified, to look into the face of
  Mr. Doarty.</p>

  <p>With a little gasp of bewilderment she attempted to dodge past him, but a
  huge paw of a hand reached out and grasped her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Well dearie?" said Mr. Doarty.</p>

  <p>"Cut it out," replied the girl, "and le'me loose. Who are you anyhow?"</p>

  <p>For answer Mr. Doarty pulled back the lapel of his coat disclosing a shiny
  piece of metal pinned on his suspender.</p>

  <p>"I ain't done nothing," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Of course you ain't," agreed Mr. Doarty. "Don't I know that real ladies
  always climb down fire escapes at two o'clock in the morning just to prove
  that they ain't done nothin'?"</p>

  <p>"Goin' to pinch me?"</p>

  <p>"Depends," replied the plain-clothes man. "What's the idea of this
  nocturnal get-away."</p>

  <p>The girl hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Give it to me straight," admonished her captor. "It'll go easier with
  you."</p>

  <p>"I guess I might as well," she said. "You see I get a swell offer from the
  Beverly Club, and that fat schonacker," she gave a vindictive nod of her head
  toward the back of Farris's resort, "he gets it tipped off to him some way,
  and has all my clothes locked up so as I can't get away."</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't let you out of his place, eh?" asked Mr. Doarty, half to
  himself.</p>

  <p>"He said I owed him three hundred dollars for board and clothes."</p>

  <p>"An' he was keepin' you a prisoner there against your will?" purred Mr.
  Doarty.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the girl.</p>

  <p>Mr. Doarty grinned. This wasn't exactly the magnitude of the method he had
  hoped to "get" Mr. Farris; but it was better than nothing. The present Grand
  Jury was even now tussling with the vice problem. Hours of its valuable time
  were being taken up by reformers who knew all about the general conditions
  with which every adult citizen is familiar; but the tangible cases, backed by
  the sort of evidence that convicts, were remarkable only on account of there
  scarcity.</p>

  <p>Something seemed always to seal the mouths of the principal witnesses the
  moment they entered the Grand Jury room; but here was a case where personal
  spite and desire for revenge might combine to make an excellent witness
  against the most notorious dive keeper in the city. It was worth trying
  for.</p>

  <p>"Come along," said Mr. Doarty.</p>

  <p>"Aw, don't. Please don't!" begged the girl. "I ain't done nothing,
  honest!"</p>

  <p>"Sure you ain't," replied Mr. Doarty. "I'm only goin' to have you held as
  a witness against Farris. That'll get you even with him, and give you a
  chance to get out and take that swell job at the Beverly Club."</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't have me if I peached on Farris, and you know it. Why, I
  couldn't get a job in a house in town if I done that."</p>

  <p>"How would you like to be booked for manslaughter?" asked the plain
  clothes man.</p>

  <p>"What you giving me!" laughed the girl. "Stow the kid."</p>

  <p>"It ain't no kid," replied Mr. Doarty solemnly. "The police knows a lot
  about the guy that some one croaked up in Farris's in March, but we been
  layin' low for a certain person as is suspected of passin' him the drops. It
  gets tipped off to the inmates of Farris's, an' I bein' next, spots her as
  she is makin' her get-away. Are you hep?"</p>

  <p>The young lady was hep&mdash;most assuredly who would not be hep to the
  very palpable threat contained in Mr. Doarty's pretty little fiction?</p>

  <p>"An'," continued Doarty, "when Farris finds you been tryin' to duck he
  won't do nothin' to help you."</p>

  <p>The girl had known of many who had gone to the pen on slighter evidence
  than this. She knew that the police had been searching for some one upon whom
  to fasten the murder of a well known business man who had not been murdered
  at all, but who had had the lack of foresight to succumb to an attack of
  acute endocarditis in the hallway of the Farris place.</p>

  <p>The searching eyes of the plain-clothes man had not failed to detect the
  little shudder of horror that had been the visible reaction in the girl to
  the sudden recollections induced by mention of that unpleasant affair, and
  while he had no reason whatever to suspect her or another of any criminal
  responsibility for the man's death, yet he made a mental note of the effect
  his words had had upon her.</p>

  <p>Had she not been an inmate of the house at the time the thing occurred?
  And was it not just possible that an excellent police case might be worked up
  about her later if the exigencies of the service demanded a brilliant police
  <i>coup</i> to distract the public's attention from some more important case
  in which they had blundered?</p>

  <p>For a moment the girl was silent. How badly he had frightened her with his
  threat Mr. Doarty had not the faintest conception, nor, could he have guessed
  the pitiable beating of her heart, would he have been able to conjecture the
  real cause of her alarm. That the policeman would assume criminal guilt in
  her should she allow her perturbation to become too apparent she well knew,
  and so, for the moment of her silence, she struggled to regain mastery of
  herself. Nor was she unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't get you anything," she said, "to follow that lay, for the
  report of the coroner's physician shows that Mr.&mdash;that the man died of
  heart disease. But, cutting out all this foolishness, I'll swear a complaint
  against Farris if you want me to&mdash;if you think that it will get you
  anything. Though, and you can take it from me who knows, it's more likely to
  get you a prairie beat out Brighton way&mdash;there's many a bull pullin' his
  box tonight out in the wilderness who thought that he could put one over on
  Abe Farris&mdash;and Farris is still doin' business at the old stand."</p>

  <p>As they talked they had been walking toward the street, and now Doarty
  crossed over to the corner with the girl and pulled for the wagon.</p>

  <p>"What did it stand you to forget the guy's name? he asked, after they had
  stood in silence for a time awaiting the wagon's tardy arrival.</p>

  <p>"They offered me a hundred," she replied.</p>

  <p>"An', of course, you didn't take it," he ventured, grinning.</p>

  <p>The girl made no response.</p>

  <p>"The newspapers sure suffered an awful shock when they found the old bloke
  was one of the biggest stockholders in two State Street department stores,"
  continued Mr. Doarty reminiscently.</p>

  <p>"They say his family routed the advertising manager of every paper in the
  city out of bed at one o'clock in the morning, and that three morning papers
  had to pull out the story after they had gone to press with it, and stick in
  a column obituary tellin' all about what he had done for his city and his
  fellow man, with a cut of his mug in place of the front page
  cartoon&mdash;gee! But it must be great to have a drag like that."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the girl in a faint voice.</p>

  <p>Faintly in the distance a gong clanged.</p>

  <p>"Them guys is sure takin' their time," observed Mr. Doarty.</p>

  <p>A little crowd had gathered about the couple at the police-box, only
  mildly curious, for an arrest is no uncommon thing in that section of town;
  and when they discovered that no one had been cut up, or shot up, and that
  the prisoner was scandalously sober they ceased even to be mildly curious. By
  the time the wagon arrived the two were again alone.</p>

  <p>At the station the girl signed a complaint against one Abe Farris, and was
  then locked up to insure her appearance in court the following morning.</p>

  <p>Officer Doarty, warrant in hand, fairly burned the pavement back to
  Farris's. It had been many a month since he had made an arrest which gave him
  as sincere personal pleasure as this one. He routed Farris out of bed and
  hustled him into his clothes. This, he surmised, might be the sole
  satisfaction that he would derive, since the municipal court judge before
  whom the preliminary hearing would come later in the morning might, in all
  likelihood, discharge the defendant.</p>

  <p>If the girl held out and proved a good witness there was a slight chance
  that Farris would be held to the Grand Jury, in which event he would derive a
  certain amount of unpleasant notoriety at a time when public opinion was
  aroused by the vice question, and the mayor in a most receptive mood for
  making political capital by revocation of a few saloon licenses.</p>

  <p>All this would prove balm to Mr. Doarty's injured sensibilities.</p>

  <p>Farris grumbled and threatened, but off to the station he went without
  even an opportunity to telephone for a bondsman. That he procured one an hour
  later was no fault of Mr. Doarty, who employed his most persuasive English in
  an endeavor to convince the sergeant that Mr. Farris should be locked up
  forthwith, and given no access to a telephone until daylight. But the
  sergeant had no particular grudge against Mr. Farris, while, on the other
  hand, he was possessed of a large family to whom his monthly pay check was an
  item of considerable importance. So to Mr. Farris, he was affable courtesy
  personified.</p>

  <p>Thus it was that the defendant went free, while the injured one remained
  behind prison bars.</p>

  <p>Farris's first act was to obtain permission to see the girl who had sworn
  to the complaint against him. As he approached her cell he assumed a jocular
  suavity that he was far from feeling.</p>

  <p>"What you doin' here, Maggie?" he asked, by way of an opening.</p>

  <p>"Ask Doarty."</p>

  <p>"Didn't you know that you'd get the worst of it if you went to buckin'
  me?" queried Farris.</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to do it," replied the girl; "though that's not sayin' that
  some one hadn't ought to do it to you good an' proper&mdash;you got it comin'
  to you, all right."</p>

  <p>"It won't get you nothin', Maggie."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it'll get me my clothes&mdash;that's all I want."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you say so in the first place, then, and not go stirrin' up a
  lot of hell this way?" asked Farris in an injured tone. "Ain't I always been
  on the square with you?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! You been as straight as a corkscrew with me."</p>

  <p>"Didn't I keep the bulls from guessin' that you was the only girl in the
  place that had any real reason for wantin' to croak old&mdash;the old guy?"
  continued Mr. Farris, ignoring the reverse English on the girl's last
  statement.</p>

  <p>A little shiver ran through the girl at mention of the tragedy that was
  still fresh in her memory&mdash;her own life tragedy in which the death of
  the old man in the hallway at Farris's had been but a minor incident.</p>

  <p>"What you goin' to tell the judge?" asked Farris after a moment's
  pause.</p>

  <p>"The truth&mdash;that you kept me there against my will by locking my
  clothes up where I couldn't get 'em," she replied.</p>

  <p>"I was only kiddin&mdash;you could 'a' had 'em any old time. Anyways,
  there wasn't no call for your doin' this."</p>

  <p>"You got a funny way of kiddin'; but even at that, I didn't have any idea
  of peachin' on you&mdash;he made me," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Who? Doarty?"</p>

  <p>The girl nodded. "Sure&mdash;who else? He's got it in for you."</p>

  <p>Farris turned away much relieved, and an hour later a colored man
  delivered a package at the station for Maggie Lynch. It contained the girl's
  clothes, and an envelope in which were five germ-laden but perfectly good,
  ten-dollar bills.</p>

  <p>The matron smiled as she opened the envelope.</p>

  <p>"Some fox," she said.</p>

  <p>"Some fox, is right," replied the girl.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2">II. &mdash; AND WIRES ARE PULLED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Rev. Theodore Pursen sat at breakfast. With his right
  hand he dallied with iced cantaloupe. The season was young for <i>cucumis
  melo</i>; but who would desire a lean shepherd for a fat flock? Certainly not
  the Rev. Theodore Pursen. A slender, well-manicured left hand supported an
  early edition of the "Monarch of the Mornings," a sheet which quite made up
  in volume of sound and in color for any lack of similarity in other respects
  to the lion of poetry and romance.</p>

  <p>On the table in his study were the two morning papers which the Rev.
  Pursen read and quoted in public&mdash;the Monarch was for the privacy of his
  breakfast table.</p>

  <p>Across from the divine sat his young assistant, who shared the far more
  than comfortable bachelor apartments of his superior.</p>

  <p>The Rev. Pursen laid down the paper with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"Ah me," he said.</p>

  <p>His assistant looked up in polite interrogation.</p>

  <p>"This is, indeed, an ungrateful world," continued Mr. Pursen, scooping a
  delicious mouthful from the melon's heart.</p>

  <p>"Here is an interview with an assistant State attorney in which he
  mentions impractical reformers seeking free advertising and cheap notoriety.
  In view of the talk I had with him yesterday I cannot but believe that he
  refers directly to me.</p>

  <p>"It is a sad commentary upon the moral perspective of the type of rising
  young men of today, which this person so truly represents, that ulterior
  motives should be ascribed to every noble and unselfish act. To what, indeed,
  are we coming?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed the assistant, "whither are we drifting?"</p>

  <p>"But was it not ever thus? Have not we of the cloth been ever martyrs to
  the cause of truth and righteousness?"</p>

  <p>"Too true," sighed the assistant, "we have, indeed."</p>

  <p>"Yet, on the other hand," continued Mr. Pursen, "there is an occasional
  note of encouragement that makes the fighting of the battle worth while."</p>

  <p>"For example?" suggested the assistant.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pursen turned again to the "Monarch of the Mornings."</p>

  <p>"Here is a quarter of a column devoted to an interview with me on the
  result of my investigation of conditions in supposedly respectable residence
  districts. The article has been given much greater prominence than that
  accorded to the misleading statements of the assistant State attorney. I am
  sure that thousands of people in this great city are even this minute reading
  this noticeable heading&mdash;let us hope that it will bear fruit, however
  much one may decry the unpleasant notoriety entailed."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pursen held up the newspaper toward his assistant, who read, in type
  half an inch high:</p>

  <p class="headline">"PURSEN PILLORIES POLICE"</p>

  <p>"The ointment surrounding the fly, as it were," suggested the
  assistant.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pursen looked quickly at the young man, but discovering no sign of
  levity in his expression, handed the paper across the table to him and
  resumed his attack upon the cantaloupe. A moment later the telephone-bell
  sounded from the extension at Mr. Pursen's elbow.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" inquired Mr. Pursen.</p>

  <p>"Hello. Mr. Pursen?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"This is Doarty."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes; good morning, officer," greeted Mr. Pursen.</p>

  <p>Mr. Doarty came right to the point. He knew when to beat about the bush
  and when not to.</p>

  <p>"You been tryin' to close up Farris's place for six months; but you ain't
  never been able to get the goods on him. I got 'em for you, now."</p>

  <p>"Good," exclaimed Mr. Pursen. "Tell me about it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Doarty unburdened himself.</p>

  <p>"The girl will be in court this morning to appear against Farris," he
  concluded. "You'd better get to her quick, before they do, and stick until
  she's called. She'll need bolstering."</p>

  <p>"I'll come down right away," replied Mr. Pursen. "Good-by, and thank
  you."</p>

  <p>"And say," said Doarty, "you can give it out that you tipped me off to the
  whole thing&mdash;I'd just as soon not appear in it any more than I can
  help."</p>

  <p>"Just so," replied Mr. Pursen, and hung up the receiver.</p>

  <p>As he turned back his assistant eyed him questioningly.</p>

  <p>"My friend Mr. Doarty has started something which he is experiencing
  difficulty in terminating," guessed Mr. Pursen shrewdly.</p>

  <p>At a quarter before ten the clergyman entered the court-room. He had no
  difficulty in locating the girl he sought, though the room was well filled
  with witnesses, friends, and relatives of the various prisoners who were to
  have their preliminary hearings, and the idle curious.</p>

  <p>"I am the Rev. Mr. Pursen," he said with smiling lips as he took her
  hand.</p>

  <p>The girl looked him squarely in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"I come as a friend," continued Mr. Pursen. "I wish to help you. Tell me
  your story and we will see what can be done."</p>

  <p>There were three young men with the clergyman. They had met him, by
  appointment, at the entrance to the courtroom. The girl eyed them.</p>

  <p>"Reporters?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Representatives of the three largest papers," replied Mr. Pursen. "You
  will be quite famous by tomorrow morning," he added playfully.</p>

  <p>When Mr. Pursen had introduced himself a great hope had sprung momentarily
  into the girl's heart&mdash;a longing that three months at Farris's had all
  but stifled. Vain regrets seldom annoyed her now. She had attained a degree
  of stoicism that three months earlier would have seemed impossible; but with
  contact with one from that other world which circumstances had forbidden her
  ever again to hope to enter&mdash;with the voicing of a kind word&mdash;with
  the play of a smile that was neither carnal nor condescending came a sudden
  welling of the desire she had thought quite dead&mdash;the desire to put
  behind her forever the life that she had been living.</p>

  <p>For an instant a little girl had looked into the eyes of the Rev. Mr.
  Pursen, prepared to do and be whatever Mr. Pursen, out of the fullness of
  brotherly love, should counsel and guide her to do and be; but Mr. Pursen saw
  only a woman of the town, and to such were his words addressed with an
  argument which he imagined would appeal strongly to her kind. And it was a
  woman of the town who answered him with a hard laugh.</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing," she said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pursen was surprised. He was pained. He had come to her as a friend in
  need. He had offered to help her, and she would not even confide in him.</p>

  <p>"I had hoped that you might wish to lead a better life," he said, "and I
  came prepared to offer you every assistance in securing a position where you
  might earn a respectable living. I can find a home for you until such a
  position is forthcoming. Can you not see the horrors of the life you have
  chosen? Can you not realize the awful depths of degradation to which you have
  come, and the still blacker abyss that yawns before you if you continue along
  the downward path? Your beauty will fade quickly&mdash;its lifeblood sapped
  by the gnawing canker of vice and shame, and then what will the world hold
  for you? Naught but a few horrible years of premature and hideous old
  age."</p>

  <p>"And the way to start a new and better life," replied the girl in a level
  voice, "is to advertise my shame upon the front pages of three great daily
  newspapers&mdash;that's your idea, eh?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pursen flushed, very faintly.</p>

  <p>"You misunderstand me entirely," he said. "I abhor as much as any human
  being can the necessity which compels so much publicity in these matters; but
  it is for the greatest good of the greatest numbers that I labor&mdash;that
  all of us should labor. If the public does not know of the terrible
  conditions which prevail under their very noses, how can we expect it to
  rouse itself and take action against these conditions?</p>

  <p>"No great reform is ever accomplished except upon the clamorous demand of
  the people. The police&mdash;in fact all city officials&mdash;know of these
  conditions; but they will do nothing until they are forced to do it. Only the
  people who elect them and whose money pays them can force them. We must keep
  the horrors of the underworld constantly before the voters and tax-payers
  until they rise and demand that the festering sore in the very heart of their
  magnificent city be cured forever.</p>

  <p>"What are my personal feelings, or yours, compared with the great good to
  the whole community that will result from the successful fruition of the
  hopes of those of us who are fighting this great battle against the devil and
  his minions? You should rather joyfully embrace this opportunity to cast off
  the bonds of hell, and by enlisting with the legion of righteousness atone
  for all your sinful past by a self-sacrificing act in the interest of your
  fellow man."</p>

  <p>The girl laughed, a rather unpleasant, mirthless laugh.</p>

  <p>"My 'fellow man'!" She mimicked the preacher's oratorical style. "It was
  my fellow man who made me what I am; it was my fellow man who has kept me so!
  it is my fellow man who wished me to blazon my degradation to the world as a
  price for aid."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, the vernacular of the underworld with its coarse slang and
  vile English slipped from her speech like a shabby disguise that has been
  discarded, and she spoke again as she had spoken in her other life, before
  constant association with beasts and criminals had left their mark upon her
  speech as upon her mind and morals; but as the first flush of indignation
  passed she slipped again into the now accustomed rut.</p>

  <p>"To hell with you and your fellow men," she said. "Now beat it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pursen's dignity had suffered a most severe shock. He glanced at the
  three young men. They were grinning openly. He realized the humiliating
  stories they would write for their respective papers. Not at all the kind of
  stories he had been picturing to himself, in which the Rev. Mr. Pursen would
  shine as a noble Christian reformer laboring for the salvation of the sinner
  and the uplift of the community. They would make horrid jokes of the
  occurrence, and people would laugh at the Rev. Mr. Pursen.</p>

  <p>A stinging rebuke was upon his lips. He would make this woman realize the
  great gulf that lay between the Rev. Mr. Pursen and such as she. He would let
  her see the loathing with which a good man viewed her and her kind; but as he
  opened his mouth to speak, his better judgment came to his rescue. The woman
  would doubtless make a scene&mdash;her sort had a decided penchant for such
  things&mdash;she might even resort to physical violence.</p>

  <p>In either event the resultant newspaper stories would be decidedly worse
  than the most glaring exaggerations which the three young men might concoct
  from the present unfortunate occurrence.</p>

  <p>So the Rev. Mr. Pursen stifled his true emotions, and with a sorrowful
  shake of his head turned sadly from his thankless task; and, indeed, why
  should a shepherd waste his valuable time upon a worthless sheep that
  preferred to stay astray? It was evident that he had lost sight entirely of
  the greater good that would follow the conviction of Farris, for he had not
  even mentioned the case to the girl or attempted to encourage her to make the
  most of this opportunity to bring the man to justice.</p>

  <p>Farris's case was called shortly after the clergyman left the court-room.
  The man had an array of witnesses present to swear that the girl had remained
  in his house of her own volition&mdash;that she could have left when she
  pleased; but the girl's story, coupled with the very evident fact that she
  was wholly indifferent as to the outcome of the case, resulted in the holding
  of Farris to the grand jury.</p>

  <p>It was what the resort-keeper had anticipated, and as he was again
  released on bail he lost no time in seeking out the head of a certain great
  real-estate firm and laying before him a brief outline of the terrible wrong
  that was being contemplated against Mr. Farris, and, incidentally, against
  present real-estate rental values in the district where Mr. Farris held
  forth.</p>

  <p>"You see," said Mr. Farris, "there ain't nothin' to this thing, anyway.
  It's just a case of the girl bein' sore on me because I had fired her, so she
  cooks up this story and gets me pinched. It's a shame, and me giving her a
  good home and a swell job when she didn't know nobody in the burg.</p>

  <p>"It's too bad," and Mr. Farris heaved an oily sigh. "It's too damn bad
  when you think of what it'll mean to the property owners down there. Why, if
  the grand jury votes a true bill against me it'll start them fake reformers
  buzzin' around thick as flies in the whole district, and there won't be
  nothin' to it but a bunch of saloon licenses taken away by the mayor, and a
  string of houses closed up; and then where'll you be?</p>

  <p>"Why, the best you can do for years'll be to rent them places to furriners
  at six and eight dollars a month, and just look at the swell rents you're
  gettin' for 'em now. Yes, sir! Somethin's got to be done in the interests of
  property values down there, for after we go you couldn't get decent people to
  live in the neighborhood if you paid 'em, to say nothin' of gettin' rent from
  'em&mdash;why, they can't even use 'em for business purposes! Customers
  wouldn't dare come into the neighborhood for fear some one would see them,
  and straight girls wouldn't work in no such locality.</p>

  <p>"If I was you I'd get busy. See your principals this mornin', and get 'em
  to put it up straight to the State attorney that it ain't in the interests of
  public morality to push this reform game no further. Why, look what it'll
  do&mdash;close up the red-light district, an' you'll have them girls
  scattered all through the residence districts, wherever they can rent a
  little flat; maybe right next door to you an' your family. And then look at
  what that'll do to property everywhere. It won't be only the old levee values
  that'll slump, but here and there through the residence districts North,
  South, and West them girls'll get in and put whole blocks on the blink.</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess you know as much about it as I do, anyway; so I'll blow
  along. I got to see my alderman, and if I had the front that you and your
  principals can put up I'd see "&mdash;and here Mr. Farris leaned forward and
  whispered a name into the real-estate agent's ear. "He can put the kibosh on
  this whole reform game if he wants to; and take it from me, there ain't
  nobody that can't be made to want to do anything on earth if you can find the
  way to get 'em where they live," and Mr. Farris slapped his right-hand
  trouser-pocket until the coins therein rang merrily.</p>

  <p>The real-estate agent pursed his lips and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You cannot reach that man in any such way as that," he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Farris, rising, laughed. "Oh splash," he said, and started for the
  door. "Well, do what you can at your end, and I'll work from the bottom up:
  and say, don't forget that if you sugar-coat it, the best of 'em will grab
  for it."</p>

  <p>Then he went and had a talk with his alderman, who, in turn, saw some one
  else, who saw some one else, who saw another party; and the real-estate agent
  saw several of his principals, and at luncheon he talked with many of his
  colleagues, who hastened forthwith to confer with the big men whose property
  they handled.</p>

  <p>In a day or two there began to filter into the State attorney's office by
  mail, by phone, and by personal call a continuous stream of requests that he
  move with extreme caution in the fight against vice which the reformers were
  urging him to initiate.</p>

  <p>The arguments all were similar. They harped upon the danger of scattering
  the vicious element throughout the city&mdash;they were pleas for the safety
  of the wives and daughters of the petitioners.</p>

  <p>"Abolish the red light district," said one, "and the criminals and
  degenerates of the underworld will hunt our wives and daughters as the wolves
  of the North woods hunt their prey&mdash;there will be no safety for them
  upon the streets nor within their own homes. Banish the women of the levee,
  and a state of anarchy and rapine will follow. For the sake of the good women
  of the city I pray that you will stand firm against the fallacious arguments
  of paid reformers and notoriety seekers."</p>

  <p>No one mentioned property values&mdash;the pill had been properly coated.
  The State attorney smiled. Mentally he had been roughly estimating the
  political influence of each petitioner. When an editorial appeared in one of
  the leading dailies under the caption, "Go Slow, Mr. State Attorney," in
  which all these arguments were rehashed and the suggestion made that another
  commission be appointed to investigate and recommend a solution of the vice
  problem, he laughed aloud, for did he not know that the uncles and aunts and
  sisters-in-law of that great paper owned nearly a third of the real estate in
  the segregated district?</p>

  <p>But the State attorney knew that no man knew what would be the result of
  the adoption of the drastic suggestions of the reformers, so it was an easy
  matter for him to justify himself to himself when he waged his bitter war of
  words against vice, and gave private instructions to his assistants in the
  safety and seclusion of his own office&mdash;instructions that did not always
  exactly harmonize with the noble sentiments enunciated in the typewritten
  "statements" passed out impartially to the representatives of the press for
  publication.</p>

  <p>The State attorney was far from being a corrupt man; but the vice problem
  had been the plaything of reformers and politicians for years; it was as old
  as the sexes; it never had been solved, and the chances were that it never
  would be. If he had spoken his mind he would probably have admitted that he
  was afraid of it, entirely from sociological reasons, and apart from its
  political aspect.</p>

  <p>But the State attorney was in no position to speak his true mind on many
  subjects&mdash;he hoped, some day, to run for Governor.</p>

  <p>And so it was that he called an assistant to his office and poured words
  of wisdom into his attentive ear.</p>

  <p>"And what sort of a bunch have you got this month?" he concluded.</p>

  <p>"Oh, just about as usual. A couple of bank presidents, some retired
  capitalists, several department managers, and one farmer. They're new now,
  but by the time that case reaches us they'll be tired of the grind and ready
  to jump through whenever I tell 'em to."</p>

  <p>Thus spake the young assistant State attorney of the ancient and honorable
  grand jury.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3">III. &mdash; THE GRAND JURY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Two weeks had elapsed since Mr. Farris had been held for the
  grand jury. He had been at liberty on bail. The girl, against whom there had
  been no charge, had been held, virtually a prisoner, in a home for erring
  women that she might be available as a witness when needed.</p>

  <p>The grand jury was returning after lunch for the afternoon session.
  Something they had done the previous day had aroused the assistant State
  attorney's ire, so that he had felt justified in punishing their foolish
  temerity with two calls that day instead of one.</p>

  <p>A little group had gathered in the front of the jury-room. They were
  discussing the cases passed, and speculating upon those to come. One and all
  were wearied with the monotony of the duty the State had imposed upon
  them.</p>

  <p>"And the worst of it is," said one of the younger members of the panel,
  "it's all so utterly futile. When I was summoned as a grand juror I had a
  kind of feeling that the State had placed a great responsibility upon my
  shoulders, that she had honored me above other men, and placed me in a
  position where I might help to accomplish something really worth while for my
  fellow man."</p>

  <p>One of the bank presidents laughed.</p>

  <p>"And the reality you find to be quite different, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Quite. I hear only one side of a great string of sordid, revolting
  stories, and I hear nothing more than the assistant State attorney wishes me
  to hear. There are momentous questions stirring the people of the city, but
  when we suggest that we should investigate the conditions underlying them we
  are told that we are not an investigating body&mdash;that those questions are
  none of our business unless they are brought to our attention through the
  regular channel of the State attorney's office. We are told that the judge
  who charged us to investigate these very conditions had never charged a grand
  jury before, and while doubtless he meant well he didn't know what he was
  talking about."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said another juror, "that we will get our chance at the
  vice problem today 'through the regular channel'&mdash;the Abe Farris case is
  on the docket for this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"And what will we do?" asked the young man. "We'll listen to answers to
  such questions as the assistant State attorney sees fit to ask, and if we
  start asking embarrassing questions he'll have the sergeant-at-arms hustle
  the witness out of the jury-room. Then we'll hem and haw, and end up by doing
  whatever the assistant State attorney wants us to do. We've done it on every
  important case&mdash;you watch."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right, sir," spoke up a retired capitalist. "In theory the
  grand jury system is the bulwark of our liberty&mdash;it was, in fact, when
  it was instituted in the twelfth or thirteenth century, at a time when there
  were several hundred crimes punishable by death; but now that there are only
  two, murder and treason; it is a useless and wasteful relic of a dead
  past.</p>

  <p>"The court that is competent to hold men to the grand jury is much more
  competent to indict them than is the grand jury itself. In fact, in cases
  where the punishment is less than death the court that now entertains the
  preliminary hearing might, to much better advantage to both the accused and
  public, pass sentence at once. It hears both sides, but all that it can do is
  discharge the prisoner or hold him for the grand jury. After this there is
  the expense of holding the prisoner in jail until his case comes to us, and
  then all the expensive paraphernalia of a grand jury is required to thresh
  over only one side of what has already been thoroughly heard before a trained
  and competent jurist. If we vote a true bill a third expensive trial is
  necessitated."</p>

  <p>"Personally," said Ogden Secor, the foreman of the jury, "the whole thing
  strikes me as a farce. The grand jury, while not quite the tool of the State
  attorney's office, is considered by them a more or less harmless impediment
  to the transaction of the business of their office&mdash;a burden to be
  borne, but lightened in the most expeditious manner.</p>

  <p>"I, as foreman, am a dummy; the secretary is a dummy; the sergeant-at-arms
  is a dummy. We look to the assistant State attorney for direction in our
  every move. We come from businesses in which we have never, in all
  probability, come in contact with criminal law, and we are expected to grasp
  the machinery of our new duties on a moment's notice.</p>

  <p>"Were it purely a matter of justice to be dispensed, I have no doubt but
  that we might do quite as well as any court; but we are up against a very
  different thing from justice&mdash;at every hand we are trammeled by
  law."</p>

  <p>The assistant State attorney entered the room.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to have been late, gentlemen," he said. "Call the next case, Mr.
  Sergeant-at-arms," and the routine of the jury-room commenced half an hour
  after the appointed time, although a quorum of the grand jury had been
  present for thirty-five minutes.</p>

  <p>The last case of the afternoon call was that against Abe Farris. There
  were only two witnesses&mdash;Officer Doarty and the girl, Maggie Lynch.
  Doarty had suffered a remarkable change of heart since the evening he stood
  in the alley back of Farris's. He was chastened in spirit. His recollection
  of the affair was vague. After the assistant State attorney had ceased
  questioning him several of the jurors asked additional information.</p>

  <p>"What sort of person is the complaining witness, officer?" asked the
  banker.</p>

  <p>Mr. Doarty looked about and grinned sheepishly. He would not have been at
  a loss for a word to describe her had a fellow policeman asked him this
  question, but this august body of dignified business men seemed to call for a
  special brand of denatured diction in the description of a spade.</p>

  <p>"Oh," he said finally, "she's just like the rest of 'em down
  there&mdash;she's on the town."</p>

  <p>"Would you believe her story?" asked the banker.</p>

  <p>Doarty grinned and shrugged. "Hard to say," he replied.</p>

  <p>"In your opinion, officer," asked the assistant State attorney, "have you
  any case against Farris? Could we get a conviction?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think you could," answered the policeman. It was the question
  he had been awaiting.</p>

  <p>"That's all, officer," said the assistant State attorney. "Just a moment,
  Mr. Sergeant-at-arms, before you call another witness."</p>

  <p>"A moment, please, officer; I want to ask another question before you go,"
  spoke up one of the jurymen.</p>

  <p>The assistant State attorney sighed and looked bored. He had found this
  the most effective means of silencing jurymen.</p>

  <p>"As I understand it, you worked this case up, am I right?" asked the
  juryman.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"If you had enough evidence three weeks ago to warrant the arrest of
  Farris, why haven't you got enough now to insure conviction?"</p>

  <p>Doarty looked uncomfortable. He fingered his cap, and turned an appealing
  look toward the assistant State attorney. That functionary came to his
  rescue.</p>

  <p>"You see, Mr.&mdash;a&mdash;Smith, pardon me for interrupting," he said,
  "the girl swore out a warrant, and it was necessary to make the arrest.
  That's all, officer, you may go now."</p>

  <p>"But," insisted Mr. Smith, "it was quite apparent from the newspaper
  account at the time that the girl was an unwilling complainant&mdash;that the
  police officer worked up the case."</p>

  <p>In the mean time, Doarty, only too anxious to do so, had left the grand
  jury-room. The sergeant-at-arms stood with his hand upon the knob of the door
  looking questioningly at the assistant State attorney.</p>

  <p>"You do not care to question any other witnesses, do you?" asked that
  young gentleman of the jury.</p>

  <p>"What other witnesses are there?" asked Mr. Smith.</p>

  <p>"Only the girl," replied the assistant State attorney; "but you can see
  from the officer's testimony that it is scarcely worth our while to hear from
  the girl. You might as well take a vote, Mr. Foreman," he concluded, turning
  toward Ogden Secor.</p>

  <p>"All those in favor of a true bill raise their right hands," commanded Mr.
  Secor.</p>

  <p>"Just a moment, Mr. Foreman," interrupted Mr. Smith.</p>

  <p>The assistant State attorney scowled and sighed, then settled back in his
  chair in martyr-like resignation. Mr. Smith was a thorn in the flesh.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me, Mr. Foreman," said Mr. Smith, "that until we have heard
  all the witnesses we are in no position to vote intelligently. I, for one, am
  in favor of calling in the girl."</p>

  <p>"Yes," "Yes," came from several of the jurors.</p>

  <p>The sergeant-at-arms looked toward the assistant State attorney for
  authority.</p>

  <p>"Call the next witness," said Ogden Secor.</p>

  <p>The sergeant-at-arms was surprised to receive a command from the foreman
  of the jury, but the assistant State attorney made no demur, so he opened the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Next witness!" he called, and the grand jury clerk, whose office is just
  outside the grand jury-room, beckoned to a girl who sat in a chair in the far
  corner shielding her face with her arm from the glaring eyes of two press
  cameras. As she rose two flashlights exploded simultaneously. Then she
  hurried across the room and passed through the doorway into the presence of
  the grand jury.</p>

  <p>Ogden Secor had had not the faintest curiosity regarding her. From
  earliest boyhood he had learned to shudder at the very thought of the
  hideous, painted creatures who plied their sickening vocation in a part of
  the town to which neither business, accident, nor inclination, had ever led
  him. For a city-bred man whose boyhood had been surrounded with every luxury
  and whose spending allowance had been practically unlimited, he was
  remarkably clean. His high ideals were still unsullied, and though a man's
  man mentally and physically, morally he was almost a prude.</p>

  <p>It was with difficulty that he raised his eyes to the girl's face as he
  administered the oath, and it was with a distinct shock of surprised
  incredulity that he saw that she was neither painted nor hideous. Her brown
  eyes fell the moment that they met his&mdash;there was no slightest sign of
  boldness in them, and when she turned to face the jury as the assistant State
  attorney began questioning her her attitude was merely of quiet
  self-possession.</p>

  <p>The young foreman could not reconcile the refinement of her appearance and
  the well-modulated voice with his preconceived ideas concerning her kind. He
  had been prepared for a sort of coarse, animal beauty, perhaps, and he had
  fully expected gaudy apparel and quantities of cheap jewelry; but instead he
  saw a demure, quietly dressed girl who might have stepped fresh from a
  convent. It was appalling to think that she had been an inmate of
  Farris's.</p>

  <p>As she answered the often brutal questions of the assistant State attorney
  Ogden Secor watched her profile. He saw that the girl was actually suffering
  under the ordeal; and he had thought that she would welcome the notoriety and
  brazenly flaunt her shame in the faces of the jurymen!</p>

  <p>And he saw, too, as he studied her face, that she was not merely
  ordinarily good-looking&mdash;hers was a face that would have been commented
  upon anywhere as exceptionally beautiful. He could not believe that the girl
  before him had voluntarily chosen the career she had been following.</p>

  <p>The assistant State attorney had finished questioning her. He had brought
  out only the simple story she had told Doarty the night he had discovered her
  upon the fire-escape. It had not been a part of his plan to bring out much of
  anything bearing on the case. When he had finished Mr. Smith arose.</p>

  <p>"How did you happen to be at Farris's place at all?" he asked. "Did you go
  there of your own volition?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the girl.</p>

  <p>"You knew the life that you would have to lead there?"</p>

  <p>"No; I did not know what kind of place it was."</p>

  <p>"Tell us how you came there then," said Mr. Smith.</p>

  <p>"I would rather not," she replied. "It has no bearing upon this case."</p>

  <p>"Would you go back there if Farris would take you?" asked another
  jury-man.</p>

  <p>"He will not take me."</p>

  <p>"What do you intend doing?"</p>

  <p>"I shall have to go to some other city where I am not known."</p>

  <p>"And there you will continue the&mdash;ah&mdash;the same vocation?"</p>

  <p>"What else is there for me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"There are many good men who would help you," said Mr. Smith. She
  shrugged, and for the first time Secor caught a note of hardness in her voice
  as she replied.</p>

  <p>"There are no good men," she said.</p>

  <p>There was a finality to her statement that put an end to further
  questioning.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4">IV. &mdash; DECENCY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"That is all," said the assistant State attorney with a wave
  toward the door. The girl stepped down from the witness-stand. As she passed
  him a sudden impulse prompted Ogden Secor to stop her. He could not have
  explained why he did so, but before he realized it he had asked the girl to
  wait in the witness-room without until he came.</p>

  <p>A great and sudden pity for her had welled within him at her last words:
  <i>"There are no good men."</i> To have spoken to such a woman as she would
  have seemed an utter impossibility to Ogden Secor a brief half-hour before,
  and now he had asked her to wait for him, and in his mind was a determination
  to help her&mdash;to save her from the hideous life she had chosen.</p>

  <p>Immediately after he had spoken the words he regretted them. It was as
  though he had bound himself to personal contact with a leper. He paled a
  little at the thought of the ordeal which faced him; but he would go through
  with it, as to that he was determined, and if he could help the girl to a
  better life he would do so. Had he guessed the interpretation the girl put
  upon his request to speak with her outside the jury-room he would have
  flushed rather than paled. To her all men were hunters&mdash;all women
  quarry.</p>

  <p>The jurors were discussing the wisdom of voting a true bill. All seemed to
  harbor not the slightest doubt that the girl had been held against her will
  in Farris's place. Had the vote been taken without discussion a true bill
  would have been the unanimous result; but with the discussion came the
  inevitable recourse to the superior legal judgment of the assistant State
  attorney.</p>

  <p>"It is up to you, gentlemen," he said, when one of the jurymen asked his
  opinion. "I do not wish to influence you in any way. I am merely here to help
  you; but inasmuch as you ask, I might say, for your information, that this
  case is identical with many others we have handled during this session of the
  grand jury. The police advise us that there is insufficient evidence to
  convict.</p>

  <p>"If we vote a true bill the taxpayers will be compelled to pay for an
  expensive trial, at the end of which the defendant will be discharged, and
  that will be the end of it; while should we vote a no-bill the case may again
  be brought before the grand jury should the police at any time in the future
  unearth further evidence.</p>

  <p>"Remember, gentlemen, if you vote a true bill now, this case can never
  again come before the grand jury, and in my humble opinion you will be
  virtually playing into Farris's hands and insuring him immunity. It is up to
  you."</p>

  <p>The foreman took the vote. A majority favored no bill, and that was the
  end of that particular case of the People <i>vs.</i> Abe Farris. Property
  interests throughout the city had been protected and real-estate values
  remained unchanged.</p>

  <p>It was the last case on call for that day, and as the jurors hurried out
  to attend to their neglected businesses Ogden Secor found himself tarrying at
  his desk in the hope that there might be none present to witness his
  interview with the girl from Farris's. There was also a growing hope that the
  girl herself would tire of waiting and depart before he left the
  jury-room.</p>

  <p>The others had gone before he emerged, and it was with a feeling of relief
  that he realized that this was true, for as he passed through the doorway he
  saw the trim figure of a young girl sitting in the far corner of the outer
  room. Her eyes were on the doorway leading to the grand jury room, and as
  Secor came out she rose and stood waiting him.</p>

  <p>He came directly toward her, and as his eyes rested upon her face he
  ceased to regret that he had asked her to wait. Surely there could be no
  intentional evil in the owner of such a face. He was confident that it would
  be an easy matter to guide her into a decent life. As he reached her he found
  that it was to be rather an embarrassing conversation to open. For a moment
  he hesitated. It was the girl who first spoke.</p>

  <p>"What do you wish of me?" she asked, although she was quite sure that she
  knew precisely what he wished. While she had waited for him she had quite
  fully determined her course of action. She was convinced that the "swell job
  at the Beverly Club" would not be for her, even though the grand jury failed
  to indict Farris.</p>

  <p>A thousand times during the past bitter months she had thrashed out the
  problem of her life; a thousand times she had determined to seek other
  employment when she could leave Farris's; and a thousand times she had
  realized that her life was already ruined past redemption, and that never
  again could she live among decent people with the constant fear hanging over
  her that the horrible secret of her past might at any moment be discovered.
  Better, far better, she thought, to continue in that life until death
  released her.</p>

  <p>But here, she felt, was to be an easier way for a few years at least.
  Sooner or later this man would tire of her, but in the mean time she would
  have a good living&mdash;it would be much better than either Farris's or the
  Beverly Club. Possibly she could save enough money to insure the balance of
  her life against want. She had heard of women like herself who had done this
  very thing. And so she waited now for the proposal which she was confident
  Mr. Ogden Secor was about to make.</p>

  <p>She knew nothing about this young man&mdash;not even his name&mdash;nor
  did she care more about him than to know that he had ample funds with which
  to defray the cost of an expensive plaything.</p>

  <p>"Miss Lynch," said Ogden Secor, "I find the things I wanted to say to you
  most difficult to say. I scarcely know how to commence. I should hate to
  offend you."</p>

  <p>"No chance," she replied. "You know what I am. There is your answer. Go
  ahead&mdash;get the proposition out of your system."</p>

  <p>Though her words were light, she was a trifle nonplused at his method of
  approach. There was a distinct note of deference in his voice that she had
  long been unused to from men. Could it be possible that she was mistaken in
  his intentions? But what else under the sun could he want of her?</p>

  <p>"You see," continued Mr. Secor, "I couldn't help but know something of
  your life from your testimony in there; yet, even though I heard it from your
  own lips, I find it difficult to believe that it is true&mdash;it doesn't
  seem possible that you could prefer such a life; and I wanted to ask if I
  might not be of service to you in some way to help you to live
  differently."</p>

  <p>The girl noted the clean, strong face of the young man before her, the
  clear eyes, and healthy skin. There was no indication of dissipation or evil
  habits. She had not spoken to such a man since she came to the city&mdash;she
  had not believed that any clean men lived in the city that she so loathed.
  She was still inclined, however, to be a trifle skeptical; yet she gave him
  the benefit of the doubt in her reply.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that it is too late," she said.</p>

  <p>"It is never too late," he replied.</p>

  <p>"You would not say that if you knew what my early training had been. I was
  taught to believe that God expected but two things of a woman&mdash;to be
  virtuous, and to become a wife and mother. If she were not virtuous, the
  second thing became a crime in her&mdash;for a woman such as I to marry and
  bear children were a crime a thousand times more hideous than loss of
  virtue.</p>

  <p>"There was no place on earth for such as I, and no hell of sufficient
  horror in the hereafter. As far as this life or the next is concerned, I am
  absolutely and irrevocably lost. I appreciate your kind intentions, but I
  fear there is nothing to be done."</p>

  <p>The girl's words brought Secor up with a sudden and most unpleasant jolt,
  for he realized that the thing she had said voiced precisely his own views in
  the matter, or rather what had been his lifelong views up to a few moments
  before. For the first time in his life he felt that there was something
  rather unfair, inhuman, and cruel in the sentence that the world passed on
  its unfortunate sisters.</p>

  <p>"I know precisely how you feel," he said at length, making no attempt to
  lighten the gravity of her sin, "for I, too, have been taught to believe that
  same thing: but now that I come to deal with a specific case I find that the
  old theory was of value only in the abstract&mdash;it isn't human, and it
  isn't good sense. There is no reason why you shouldn't lead a decent life if
  you wish to.</p>

  <p>"In fact, that you haven't recently done so is all the more reason that
  you should commence now. It can't make things any better if you go on as you
  have been, but as far as you yourself are concerned and those you come in
  contact with it will be very much better indeed if you live as you should
  live during the balance of your life."</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to help me?" asked the girl suddenly. She had discovered
  that she had quite unexpectedly lost sight of the motives which she believed
  had prompted the young man to seek this interview. There had been nothing
  either in his words or manner to support her suspicions; yet, with her
  knowledge of men, it was difficult for her to dismiss them.</p>

  <p>Secor hesitated a moment before replying, a half smile upon his lips,</p>

  <p>"That is a difficult question," he said. "I never did anything of the sort
  before, and I don't know why I have attempted it now. If I tried to explain
  the psychology of it I should appear ridiculous, I fear."</p>

  <p>"I should like to know," said the girl, "if for no other reason than to
  learn that I had made a good guess as to what you wanted." She had determined
  to prove her point for her own satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"And what did you think was my reason?" asked Secor.</p>

  <p>She looked him straight in the eyes, and without a smile said quite
  simply:</p>

  <p>"To make a date with me."</p>

  <p>To say that young Mr. Secor was shocked would have been to put it too
  mildly by far; but his expression gave no hint of the disappointment and
  disgust that surged through him.</p>

  <p>"And if that were my reason," he asked, "would you have accepted
  my&mdash;ah&mdash;invitation?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" And she was about to add, "Isn't your money as good as
  anybody's?" But she found herself faltering in her suspicion of this young
  man, and a sudden sense of shame sent the red blood mantling to her
  cheek.</p>

  <p>For a moment he stood looking straight into her eyes until hers dropped
  suddenly in confusion.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said, "that you should have misconstrued my intentions."
  His voice held a faint note of sadness and not a little of disappointment.
  "But as you have, I shall try to give you my real reasons at the risk of
  appearing silly."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would," she said. "I didn't want to think the other, but after
  my experience with men, it was hard to believe that one of them could go out
  of his way to perform an unselfish act where a woman was concerned&mdash;a
  woman such as I," she added in a very faint whisper.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to help you," said Secor, "from the moment that I saw your face
  and heard your voice in the jury-room. I couldn't believe that a girl like
  you belonged in the underworld. It was not because of the fact that you are a
  very beautiful girl, but that your face and expression reflect a sweetness of
  character that seemed entirely out of place in the life you have been
  leading. There must have been a sudden, subconscious appeal to the protective
  instinct that is supposed to have been very strong in primitive man&mdash;in
  no other way can I account for the immediate desire I had to save you. Those
  are my reasons, if you can call them reasons, for asking you to wait here for
  me. You will doubtless find them as ridiculous as they now seem to me."</p>

  <p>The girl's lips trembled as she attempted to speak, and tears came to her
  eyes so that she had to turn away to hide her emotion. It had been long
  indeed since a man had spoken to her and of her in this way. Her whole heart
  went out to this stranger because of those few kindly words&mdash;such words
  as her poor soul had been starving for the want of during the long, hard
  months of her living death.</p>

  <p>"What do you wish me to do?" she asked after she had regained control of
  her voice.</p>

  <p>"Let me help you find employment&mdash;that is all that you may accept
  from any man. It is all that any decent man should offer you," he
  replied.</p>

  <p>"I will do whatever you wish," she said simply.</p>

  <p>"I am going away tomorrow," he went on, "to be gone for several weeks. In
  the mean time I'll give you the name and address of a man who can and will
  help you to at least temporary employment. Keep in touch with him and when I
  return we'll see what is best to be done, and what sort of work you are best
  qualified for."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he had written a name and address upon a leaf of his
  memorandum-book. He tore the sheet out and handed it to her. Without looking
  at it she slipped it into her hand-bag.</p>

  <p>"And now good-by and good luck," he said, extending his hand to her.</p>

  <p>"You must not shake hands with a&mdash;with me," she said.</p>

  <p>"Don't say that," he replied. "Forget what you have been&mdash;you are
  that no longer. I am wanting to shake hands with an entirely new girl, and to
  prove that you intend to be a new girl you must let me."</p>

  <p>He smiled the clean, wholesome smile that made his strong young face
  doubly attractive. There was no refusing Ogden Secor anything that he asked
  when he smiled, and so the girl placed her hand in his.</p>

  <p>"This is the ratification of your pledge," he said. "I shall never doubt
  for a moment that you are keeping it. Until I return, then," and bowing he
  left her there, a new hope and a great happiness in her heart.</p>

  <p>If one good man could forgive her her past, there must be others. Possibly
  the world would not be so hard upon her after all. Maybe there was a chance
  for her to live as she wanted to live, and to find the happiness that she had
  so craved, and which she had thought was lost forever.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she recalled that she did not know the name of the man who had
  just left her. Well, that could easily be ascertained. She had the name and
  address of his friend. She would go to him at once and take any employment
  that he could find for her. She would work for a bare living, if necessary,
  rather than go back to the old life. She would do anything for the man who
  had spoken to her as this young stranger had spoken.</p>

  <p>Eagerly she opened her hand-bag and withdrew the little slip of paper. As
  she read the name a cold wave of disappointment and bitterness chilled and
  blighted the new happiness and hope that had filled her being.</p>

  <p>The name on the paper was "Rev. Theodore Pursen."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5">V. &mdash; A FRIEND IN NEED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was a very disheartened girl who found her way out of the
  criminal court building and across the Dearborn Street Bridge to the Loop.
  She was wondering if her new friend were of the same type of reformer as the
  Rev. Mr. Pursen. Would he want her to narrate the story of her rescue for the
  Sunday editions upon his return?</p>

  <p>Then it occurred to her that she would not see him when he came back to
  the city, for she had no idea who he might be, and she certainly would not go
  to the Rev. Mr. Pursen to find out. It began to look as though she had made a
  false start after all on her road to a new life.</p>

  <p>At Lake and Dearborn she stopped to purchase an evening paper, and in the
  entrance to a near-by building she sought among the want ads for a likely
  boarding-house. She found an address far out on the South Side, and a moment
  later boarded a Cottage Grove Avenue car at Wabash Avenue.</p>

  <p>As she rode South she tried to reach some definite decision as to her
  future. She could go back to the old life, and the young man would never
  know. The chances are that he would not care if he did know.</p>

  <p>His act had been prompted by but the passing kindness of a moment. If he
  ever thought of her again, it would be but to inquire of his friend the Rev.
  Mr. Pursen if she had applied to him for aid, and finding that she had not,
  he would promptly forget all about the incident.</p>

  <p>As she speculated upon her future, her eyes wandered aimlessly over the
  printed page of close-set want ads in the paper in her hand.</p>

  <p>Presently a notice caught her attention:</p>

  <p>WANTED&mdash;Neat girl for general office work; small wages to start;
  experience unnecessary. Apply Kesner Building.</p>

  <p>"Why not try it?" she thought. "He'll never know, of course, but he was on
  the square. He wanted to help me, and I can't believe that he is like Pursen.
  He wanted to give me a chance to be the kind of girl he thought I looked
  like, and why shouldn't I be? I can do that much, surely, when all my
  inclinations lie in that direction. I haven't wanted to be bad, God knows;
  and I guess I've been a fool to think that I had to keep on that way just
  because I had started."</p>

  <p>At Twenty-Fourth Street a pimply-faced young man boarded the car. As he
  walked forward toward the front platform, a lighted cigarette in his
  nicotine-stained fingers, he turned to stare into the face of every woman in
  the car. When he came opposite the girl from Farris's he stopped with a broad
  grin upon his unclean face.</p>

  <p>"Why, hello there, Mag!" he cried. "When did you get out?" And with the
  words he plumped into the seat at her side.</p>

  <p>"This afternoon, Eddie," she replied quietly.</p>

  <p>"Where to now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm on my way uptown to find a boarding-place."</p>

  <p>"Got a new job already?" he asked, surprised.</p>

  <p>"I'm cuttin' that out, Eddie," she said. "I'm goin' to be on the square
  after this."</p>

  <p>"Forget it," he grinned.</p>

  <p>"On the dead."</p>

  <p>"Who's keepin' you?" he persisted.</p>

  <p>"Myself."</p>

  <p>"May Beverley asked me to look you up," he remarked. "She says you
  promised to come there."</p>

  <p>"I didn't think she'd want me after that Farris business," replied the
  girl.</p>

  <p>The young man laughed.</p>

  <p>"Huh! What does she care? She ain't got no love for Farris, and besides a
  chicken with an angel face like yours can get in anywhere in the burg. But on
  the dead, Mag, you're a boob not to get your hooks onto some rich gazimbat. I
  know a gink right now that'll pass me out five hundred bones any time for a
  squab like you. Say the word and I'll split with you."</p>

  <p>The girl looked at the man for a moment, and then turned and gazed out of
  the window.</p>

  <p>"That's right; think it over," said Eddie. "It's a good proposition and
  that ain't no dream. He's not exactly pretty, but he's there with a bundle of
  kale that would choke the Panama. He'd set you up in a swell apartment,
  plaster sparklers all over you, and give you a year-after-next model
  eight-lunger and a shuffer. You'd be the only cheese on Mich. Boul."</p>

  <p>The girl knew that Eddie was not romancing; and here she had been thinking
  that she could not even get into the Beverley Club. Here was easy
  money&mdash;riches even&mdash;just for the taking; and she would be no worse
  for it than she already was.</p>

  <p>She looked again at the man beside her, and as she looked she found
  herself comparing him with the young man she had last talked with. He, too,
  had come to her with an offer. She glanced at the want ad lying face-up in
  the paper on her lap.</p>

  <p>"Five dollars a week," she mused. "Six at the most."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" asked Eddie. "I didn't getcha."</p>

  <p>Eddie was smiling at her. She saw his smile, but beyond it she saw the
  smile of that other young man. Eddie would have felt pained could he have
  read the unvoiced comparison that shot into the girl's mind as she looked at
  Eddie's yellow-toothed, unwholesome smirk.</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Eddie at last. "Shall I frame up a date?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the girl, "I think I've got a swell job already. Good-by,
  Eddie; here's where I get off."</p>

  <p>She found the boarding-house, and after paying a week's board in advance
  returned to the Loop, seeking the Kesner Building. On the eighteenth floor
  she found the room number given in the want ad.</p>

  <p>"There have been fifteen other applicants already," said the man to whom
  she had been directed by a typist near the door of the office; "but I haven't
  decided on any one in particular yet&mdash;there'll be as many more in
  tomorrow morning. Have you had any experience?"</p>

  <p>"No; the advertisement said that was unnecessary," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course; but with so many applicants I would naturally prefer to
  choose an experienced girl. What have you been doing?"</p>

  <p>The girl hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Nothing." she said finally; "I have just come from the country."</p>

  <p>"What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"Lathrop&mdash;June Lathrop," she answered, giving him her true name; for
  with her decision to commence life anew she had also decided to do so under
  her true colors. There would be nothing in her future, she had determined,
  that could bring odium upon her father's name.</p>

  <p>"Well Miss Lathrop," said he, "to be frank, you're the most likely looking
  of the applicants so far. Most of them have had experience, but that doesn't
  count much against natural intelligence, and unless I'm way off you've got
  that. I'll tell you what, you come back here tomorrow morning about
  nine-thirty, and if no one I like better has shown up by that time the job's
  yours. Good afternoon."</p>

  <p>For three months June Lathrop folded and enclosed circulars on the
  eighteenth floor of the Kesner Building at the princely salary of six dollars
  a week. As her board and room at the place she had first selected cost her
  seven dollars a week, it required but a rudimentary knowledge of higher
  mathematics to convince her that she would either have to change positions or
  boarding-houses. She chose the latter alternative.</p>

  <p>The change brought her into a neighborhood perilously close to the
  red-light district. Several times she saw women she had known in that other
  life. They passed her upon the street, clothed in clinging silk and starred
  with many a scintillating gem. June was careful to see that they did not have
  a chance to recognize her.</p>

  <p>Her clothes were becoming a trifle shabby; but they were neat, and were
  worn with that indefinable air that some women can impart to rags.</p>

  <p>Not once yet had she regretted the step she had taken. For the first time
  in months she felt a growing interest in life and a quiet contentment that
  was almost happiness&mdash;as near to happiness at least as she ever expected
  to attain.</p>

  <p>She often smiled sadly to herself in recalling upon how slight a thing the
  turning in her life had hinged&mdash;the clean smile and kindly interest of a
  stranger, a man whose name, even, she did not know.</p>

  <p>Early in her career upon the eighteenth floor of the Kesner Building June
  had discovered that the road to higher wages paralleled the acquirement of
  special training. Any one could fold and enclose circulars. There were always
  thousands of young girls to be employed at a moments notice for this class of
  work; but even here, she discovered, expertness demanded and received the
  highest wages. So she made it a point to become expert.</p>

  <p>At the end of the second month she could handle a greater volume of work
  in a day than any other girl in the department, and with a lower percentage
  of errors. Her wages were advanced to seven dollars, and she was entrusted
  with the more important work of the department.</p>

  <p>In the same room with her were several typists and on the floor below many
  stenographers. June discovered that the poorest paid typist earned a dollar a
  week more than she&mdash;or at least received that much more.</p>

  <p>She determined to become a typist, and with that end in view practised
  during the noon hour each day under the guidance of one of the regular
  typists. From her she learned that some of the stenographers down-stairs
  received as much as seventy-five dollars a month&mdash;almost three times her
  wage!</p>

  <p>That evening June enrolled in a night-school where she could study
  stenography. The venture necessitated a curtailment of expenses&mdash;it
  meant walking to and from her work and finding a still cheaper room than that
  she had. Her new lodgings were nearer the Loop. Here she had a tiny
  gas-stove, where she cooked her slender meals&mdash;two a day, some days.</p>

  <p>At night she practised and studied. In a month she could take ordinary
  dictation and transcribe ninety per cent of it quite as it had been dictated.
  Without being aware of it she had become some forty per cent more efficient
  than most stenographers ever become; yet she felt that she was far from the
  proficiency required to obtain or hold a position.</p>

  <p>Then the blow fell. Her careful attention to her work, in the
  circularizing department&mdash;her expertness&mdash;lost her position for
  her. It happens every day in the departments of big businesses in every city.
  A slack season came. Expenses must be curtailed. The head of the house
  conferred with the manager of her department. The pay-roll was the first item
  to be considered in reducing expenses&mdash;it always is. Likewise it was the
  last thing.</p>

  <p>"How many girls can you spare at this season of the year, Mr. Brown?"
  asked the head of the house.</p>

  <p>"We can cut the force in two," replied Mr. Brown, not because he thought
  so, but because he thought the head of the house would like to have him say
  it. Mr. Brown had been up against this same thing twice a year since he had
  assumed the management of the department. He had found it far easier to
  coincide with the wishes of his superior, especially when the hysteria of
  retrenchment was abroad; later he could employ other girls to bring his
  department up to a respectable working basis&mdash;after the head of the
  house had transferred his attention and hysteria to another department or
  another field of endeavor.</p>

  <p>The head of the house glanced down the pay-roll, a copy of which Mr. Brown
  had handed him.</p>

  <p>"H-m!" he said. "Seven dollars! Seven dollars is too much for this class
  of work, Mr. Brown. When I started this business I had but one
  employee&mdash;a girl. She and I did all the work. I used to work eighteen
  and twenty hours a day, and if I had made seven dollars a week clear the
  first year I should have been delighted. She worked nearly every night and
  Saturday afternoons as well, and did it for three dollars a week. You are
  paying your help altogether too much. I see you have three girls in this
  department who are receiving seven dollars a week&mdash;we will start with
  them."</p>

  <p>And he made three little x's&mdash;one before the name of each of the
  three. So June lost her job. When Mr. Brown told her that he would not need
  her after the following Saturday she was dumfounded.</p>

  <p>"Hasn't my work been satisfactory?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Mr. Brown; and then as well as he could he explained the
  necessity for cutting down the force: but just why it was necessary to lay
  off his most efficient help he did not attempt to explain.</p>

  <p>That night and for many days thereafter June scanned the want columns of
  the papers. She wrote in reply to blind ads&mdash;letters that never received
  a response. She called in answer to those that gave an address, but there was
  always something they wanted that she lacked.</p>

  <p>Quite often the positions were filled before she applied, and then she
  discovered that she must wait upon the corner near the office of the
  afternoon newspaper from which she obtained her leads, seize one of the first
  copies that came onto the street, and hasten to the addresses of the more
  likely appearing ads if she would be in time to obtain a first hearing.</p>

  <p>In this way she managed, during the ensuing three or four months to pick
  up half a dozen temporary positions at wages ranging from five to nine
  dollars a week, but fully half the time she was idle. She had been compelled
  to give up night-school, but she still practised stenography at home; and her
  afternoons, when she was out of employment, she spent at the employment
  bureaus of various typewriter companies gaining speed on machines of
  different makes.</p>

  <p>She had not sufficient confidence as yet to apply for a position as
  typist&mdash;she was too inexperienced to know that this is the sole asset of
  the majority of typists.</p>

  <p>Four months after she lost her position in the Kesner Building she was
  working in the bindery department of a small job printing establishment at
  four dollars a week. Her clothes were by this time far too shabby for her to
  hope to obtain an office position; nor was there any immediate likelihood
  that she would be able to save sufficient money from her wages ever to
  purchase other clothing. But even now she retained her courage, though hope
  was rapidly succumbing.</p>

  <p>Poor and insufficient food had left its mark upon her pallid, emaciated
  cheeks and dark-ringed eyes. She had made no friends among her coworkers. The
  good girls she avoided from a sense of shame in her past; the others, with
  their cheap immoralities, disgusted her. She would be one thing or the
  other&mdash;all good or all bad&mdash;and so she could not abide those who
  sailed under false colors, assuming a respectability that they did not
  have.</p>

  <p>She still retained sufficient beauty to make her noticeable among other
  girls. It was her sole possession of value. One day she had an opportunity to
  cash it. The man who ran the print-shop often walked through the bindery
  inspecting the work. On several occasions he stopped and spoke to June about
  the job that she happened to be engaged upon. He was a middle-aged man,
  rather good-looking. There was little or no indication of dissipation upon
  his face, and yet June knew that he was a hunter&mdash;she had heard snatches
  of conversation among the other girls; conversation that made her blush,
  hardened as she thought she was.</p>

  <p>One afternoon the forewoman told her that "the boss" wanted to see her in
  his office. She hastened to respond to the summons.</p>

  <p>Her employer smiled pleasantly as she entered.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he said, indicating a chair beside his desk.</p>

  <p>June did as he bid.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been with us?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Two weeks," she replied.</p>

  <p>"I have been noticing your work&mdash;and you," said the man. "I think
  that you are not getting enough wages. I believe that we can fix it up so
  that you can earn ten dollars a week&mdash;how would that strike you?"</p>

  <p>The girl's eyes narrowed, but the man did not notice.</p>

  <p>"I should be glad if I could earn ten dollars a week," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Well, suppose you take dinner with me tonight and we'll talk it
  over&mdash;I'm too busy just now. Well, what do you say?"</p>

  <p>June looked him straight in the eyes, and then she laughed. She thought of
  the apartment on Michigan Avenue, the eight-cylinder touring-car, the
  chauffeur, the diamonds&mdash;of all that she had refused seven months
  ago.</p>

  <p>"You poor boob," she said. "You poor, cheap boob, you!"</p>

  <p>The man turned scarlet. He tried to say something, but the words stuck in
  his throat.</p>

  <p>June rose from her chair.</p>

  <p>"Give me my time, please. I've heard that there were men like you. Before
  I went to work I thought they were all like you; but in all the offices I
  have worked&mdash;and I've worked in a lot of them&mdash;you're the first man
  that ever made a raw crack like that to me. If you had had the nerve to come
  right out and say what you wanted of me I might at least have had a little
  respect for you; but to try to work that rotten old cradle-robbing
  dinner-game on me! And offering me ten dollars a week and work all day in the
  bindery to boot! Give me my four dollars and let me get out of here!"</p>

  <p>For two weeks June sought another position in vain. Her money was gone,
  and she owed for a week's room rent. She had no food or prospects of food.
  She had not eaten for twenty-four hours; and then, as fate would have it, she
  met Eddie on the street&mdash;Eddie of the pimply face, the unclean nails,
  and the stained fingers.</p>

  <p>"For the love o' Mike!" exclaimed Eddie. "You?"</p>

  <p>"Surest thing you know, Eddie," replied the girl, laughing.</p>

  <p>"The swellest-lookin' chicken on the line&mdash;in rags!" he said. "What's
  the idea, Mag? Got a job as one of them new she-cops and doin' a little
  gum-shoe work in disguise?"</p>

  <p>"No, Eddie; I'm out of a job."</p>

  <p>Sudden enlightenment dawned upon Eddie's countenance.</p>

  <p>"Bein' on the square hasn't got you much, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No, Eddie; it hasn't got me anything except an awful appetite and nothing
  to satisfy it with."</p>

  <p>The young man looked into her face searchingly.</p>

  <p>"You hungry, Mag!"</p>

  <p>She didn't deny it.</p>

  <p>He grasped her by the arm.</p>

  <p>"You come along with me," he commanded. "I know a joint round the corner
  where we can feed up swell on four bits, and that's all I got just now."</p>

  <p>The girl drew back.</p>

  <p>"No, Eddie," she said; "I can't sponge."</p>

  <p>"Forget it," he cried. "Do you suppose I'll see an old pal hungry when I
  got the price? Not me!"</p>

  <p>And then, as she still demurred, his expression changed.</p>

  <p>"Oh." he said, "I forgot. You're on the square now, so you'd be ashamed to
  be seen with a dip like me&mdash;that's it. Well, I don't know but you're
  right. You can't be too careful."</p>

  <p>"That's not it, Eddie, and you know it," she cried. "But I've been trying
  so hard to make good! I haven't asked anybody for help, and I've been on the
  square all the time. I hate to have to fall back on charity now."</p>

  <p>"Charity nothin'!" he exploded. "You'd do as much for me if I was down and
  out. Come along now, and when you get the price you can feed me up in return
  if you feel that way about it."</p>

  <p>And so they went together to the joint around the corner where they could
  get a swell feed for two for fifty cents.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of this virtue lay by this time?" asked Eddie after
  they had partially satisfied the cravings of the inner man and woman.</p>

  <p>"I guess it's its own reward all right enough," replied the girl.</p>

  <p>Eddie was silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember me tellin' you about an old bloke the last time I seen
  you?" he asked presently.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"That proposition's still open."</p>

  <p>She reached across the table and laid her hand upon his stained
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"Don't, Eddie," she said. "I'm trying hard to fight the temptation to go
  back where there is plenty of easy money, and good clothes, and enough to
  eat. I want to be on the square, though, Eddie, so don't make it harder for
  me."</p>

  <p>He patted her hand.</p>

  <p>"You're the real goods, Mag," he said. I thought you was just
  four-flushin' that time you told me you'd quit the gay life, but I guess it
  takes more'n a four-flush for a girl like you to wear them clothes and starve
  to boot just for the sake of bein' decent. I won't say nothin' more about
  that proposition; but if I can help you any other old way, why, you got my
  number.</p>

  <p>"Gee!" he continued, "I wish I had your nerve. I tried a dozen times to
  quit and be decent. But the easy money down here always got me&mdash;that and
  the coke. Tell me all you been doin' since I seen you, and what's went wrong
  that you couldn't get a job."</p>

  <p>She related her experiences; closing with an account of the print-shop
  man.</p>

  <p>"The cheap skate!" exclaimed Eddie. "Gimme his number, and I'll hike down
  his way tomorrow and touch him for all he's got in his jeans&mdash;it'll
  teach him a lesson."</p>

  <p>"No, Eddie, that wouldn't be setting me a very good example of being
  decent, would it?"</p>

  <p>The man laughed.</p>

  <p>"But say," he said, "why is it you don't go after a swell steno job? You
  say they told you down at the typewriter joint that you was the real cheese
  and ought to hold any job you could cop off."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know they did," she replied, "but they intimated that they
  couldn't send me out in answer to a call unless I had better clothes, and you
  can't buy much on four dollars a week, Eddie, especially if you only get the
  four some weeks."</p>

  <p>Eddie sat for a moment deep in thought. Then he rose and reached for his
  hat.</p>

  <p>"You sit tight here for about ten minutes, Mag," he said, "and I'll be
  right back. I got some business up the street. I want to see you again when I
  come back. You won't duck, will you?"</p>

  <p>"I'll wait for you, Eddie," she replied.</p>

  <p>The man stopped at the cashier's desk and paid the two checks, then he
  hurried out into the brilliantly lighted street.</p>

  <p>It was fifteen minutes before he returned, and when he took his place at
  the table opposite her the girl did not know that he no longer wore a diamond
  stickpin, a watch of gold, and a diamond ring.</p>

  <p>"Here," he said, shoving a roll of bills across the table to her. "Here's
  a stake for them swell clothes you need to land a decent job."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6">VI. &mdash; SECOR'S FIANCE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Long before Mr. Ogden Secor returned to the city after his
  grand jury service had terminated and released him to attend to his own
  affairs, he had completely forgotten the girl from Farris's and his promise
  of assistance to her.</p>

  <p>It was fully a month after his return that he was reminded of the affair
  by the sight of the Rev. Mr. Pursen at the home of Secor's fiance where both
  had dropped in of a late afternoon.</p>

  <p>"By the way, Mr. Pursen," said Secor, "did a girl I sent to you for
  assistance ever apply? She was the girl from Farris's in that case that was
  brought before the grand jury of which I was foreman."</p>

  <p>"No," said the Rev. Mr. Pursen, "she did not come to me. I went to her the
  very day that Farris was arrested and offered to help her; but I found her
  entirely unresponsive to my advances. In fact, she seemed totally depraved,
  and though I labored with her I was finally forced to the conclusion that she
  was one of those hopelessly lost women which nothing but death can remove
  from the evil life they cling to by preference."</p>

  <p>"Strange," said Mr. Secor; "she completely deceived me. I could have sworn
  that she was not innately vicious, and that if given a chance she might
  easily have been helped to a better way of living."</p>

  <p>"No," said the Rev. Mr. Pursen; "I did my poor, weak best; but it was all
  to no avail."</p>

  <p>"Too bad," said Mr. Secor, and that would have been the end of it had not
  fate been planning the perpetration of an odd trick upon him.</p>

  <p>Sophia Welles entered at that moment, and both men arose to greet her.</p>

  <p>"I have come to beg again, Miss Welles," said Mr. Pursen. "I find that our
  Society for the Uplift of Erring Women is sadly in need of funds. The
  secretary's salary is a month in arrears; the stenographer and the two
  investigators have not been paid for two weeks, and the rent is several days
  overdue."</p>

  <p>"Well, well," murmured Miss Welles sympathetically, "that is too bad. We
  must certainly do something at once. How much do you need, and what can you
  rely upon from other sources?"</p>

  <p>"We need about two hundred dollars at once," replied the clergyman, "and
  some arrangement would be very advantageous that would assure us of a
  permanent income of two hundred and fifty or three hundred dollars per
  month."</p>

  <p>"I will subscribe fifty dollars toward the emergency fund at once," said
  Miss Welles. She looked expectantly toward Mr. Secor.</p>

  <p>"What is the nature of the work done by the society?" asked that
  gentleman.</p>

  <p>"The name of the society is self-explanatory," returned Mr. Pursen. "The
  Society for the Uplift of Erring Women."</p>

  <p>"Roughly," Mr. Secor inquired, "how does it function?"</p>

  <p>"Our investigators call upon the women whose cases come to our
  attention&mdash;usually through Municipal Court records&mdash;and endeavor to
  prevail upon them to attend our Monday evening Uplift Circle. The meetings
  are held in the church every Monday except during July and August. Here we
  enjoy a short song service, followed by prayer, and then the women listen to
  helpful talks by the noble women who are sacrificing their Monday evenings to
  their poor, fallen sisters."</p>

  <p>"Do many of the women you seek to aid attend these meetings?" asked Mr.
  Secor.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, no," admitted Mr. Pursen; "possibly five or six, on an
  average, I should say. The unfortunate part of it is that they seem to have
  so little real desire to embrace the opportunity we are offering them to
  begin life anew that seldom if ever do the same women attend our Uplift
  Circle a second time. You have no conception, Mr. Secor, how discouraging is
  labor of this nature&mdash;the utter indifference and ingratitude of those we
  would help is the first and greatest obstacle to our work."</p>

  <p>"Just how would you help them, practically?" inquired Mr. Secor.</p>

  <p>"By contact with good women; by the beauties of Scripture; by helpful
  suggestions and example; by impressing upon them their degradation;
  by&mdash;ah&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you find remunerative employment for them?" asked Mr. Secor.</p>

  <p>"We have not gone thus far as yet, though that is the ultimate object, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"I should think that it would be the primary object. Between meetings they
  go back and earn their livings in the old way&mdash;if you have accomplished
  anything it is undone at once."</p>

  <p>"It is difficult to find people who will employ these women once we
  explain the sort of people they are," replied Mr. Pursen; "but that we hope
  to be able to do when we have sufficient funds to employ more
  assistants."</p>

  <p>"You have placed none of them in decent employment, then?" asked Mr.
  Secor.</p>

  <p>"Not as yet&mdash;it takes time to accomplish great reforms&mdash;Rome was
  not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course," interrupted Mr. Secor; "but, looking at the matter from
  a purely business standpoint, I cannot see how you are going to raise
  sufficient funds to carry on any work until you have accomplished something
  practical with what you have. If four or five paid workers, with the
  assistance of a number of volunteers, have been unable to effect the
  regeneration of not a single woman in the six or eight months that the
  society has been organized, I should consider it a rather risky investment to
  subscribe any considerable amount for the continuation of the work.</p>

  <p>"I don't wish to discourage you," continued Mr. Secor kindly, "but
  charities to be effective must be treated just as one would treat a business
  proposition. If a given charity is not producing results it would be better
  to divert our money to other channels&mdash;there are several well-managed
  charities, I understand, that are doing considerable practical good."</p>

  <p>"Then you think that the Society for the Uplift of Erring Women is poorly
  managed?" asked Mr. Pursen a trifle acridly.</p>

  <p>"It may be and it may not&mdash;there are some things which cannot be
  done&mdash;impractical things. This may be one of them; or the methods of the
  society may be faulty. Of course I am in no position to judge, nor do I wish
  to criticise."</p>

  <p>"I can assure you that my cousin, Miss Peebles, is a very conscientious
  woman," said Mr. Pursen, "and is doing a noble work intelligently."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Mr. Secor; "I ask your pardon. I did not know that the
  secretary of the society is your cousin."</p>

  <p>"She is," continued Mr. Pursen, "and the other active workers in the
  society are relatives of the good women who are aiding us in our thankless
  task."</p>

  <p>"You mean by active workers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Those who are on salary&mdash;not being financially able to devote their
  time to the work gratuitously," explained Mr. Pursen.</p>

  <p>"I think," said Miss Welles, "that the society is doing a very noble work
  under most adverse conditions, and that we should do all in our power to help
  it financially, as well as to give it our moral support. It is very easy,
  Ogden, to criticise."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," said Mr. Secor, "if I have seemed to disparage the work of
  the society; but knowing as I do that it is rather a pet of yours, Sophia, I
  wanted to do something really worth while for it&mdash;if my money would do
  any good. There is no value in throwing money away for sentiment when there
  are so many places where it can be used to practical advantage.</p>

  <p>"I should like very much to talk with Miss Peebles, and if I find that
  there is good foundation for the belief that fallen women can be really saved
  or benefited through your organization, I shall be most happy to subscribe
  toward an endowment fund, and influence my friends to do likewise."</p>

  <p>"That is very kind of you, Mr. Secor," said Mr. Pursen, relaxing as he
  scented a substantial donation.</p>

  <p>"Where is the office of the society?" asked Mr. Secor. "I shall make it a
  point to see Miss Peebles tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"The office is in the church," said Mr. Pursen. "You will find Miss
  Peebles there about eleven o'clock. She is usually there between eleven and
  twelve daily."</p>

  <p>"I thought from your reference to rent," remarked Mr. Secor, "that the
  society probably had a down-town office."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Mr. Pursen; "we felt that as long as the society would have
  to pay rent it would be better to give this rent to the church rather than to
  outsiders, and we have made the amount very much smaller than the society
  could have obtained similar space for in the Loop."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Mr. Secor, "I see. Well, then, if possible, I shall call upon
  Miss Peebles tomorrow; but do not tell her to expect me, for I may find
  business engagements will prevent my seeing her before the first of the
  week."</p>

  <p>"I hope not," Mr. Pursen said; "for I am sure that Miss Peebles can
  explain the work and scope of the society much more interestingly than I, in
  my poor, weak way."</p>

  <p>"We might look up that girl from Farris's again," suggested Mr. Secor,
  "and see what Miss Peebles can do for her."</p>

  <p>"She is too degraded, I am afraid, ever to respond to the kind offices of
  good men and women. I think that she prefers her present life, sad as it may
  seem to us. Poor thing! I tried so hard to win her to godliness.</p>

  <p>"But I must be going, now. I am so very glad to have met you again, Mr.
  Secor. May we not hope to see you oftener at our little church gatherings? In
  my poor, weak way I shall endeavor to make you welcome."</p>

  <p>"Just a moment, Mr. Pursen," said Miss Welles, "until I make out a check
  for the Uplift Society."</p>

  <p>After the Rev. Mr. Pursen had departed with his check Sophia turned to
  Secor.</p>

  <p>"Isn't he splendid?" she exclaimed. "So noble and sincere in his desire to
  better his fellow man! So magnanimous in his practical relations with the
  poor creatures of the under-world!"</p>

  <p>"Rather nice chap to have for a cousin, I should say, were one in quest of
  remunerative employment with short hours," replied Mr. Secor with a trace of
  dryness.</p>

  <p>Miss Welles looked at her fiance sharply.</p>

  <p>"How perfectly unkind, Ogden," she exclaimed. "Really, I'd never have
  thought it of you. Mr. Pursen is one of nature's own noblemen."</p>

  <p>"All right, Sophie; we won't quarrel about Mr. Pursen, although I must say
  that if his attitude toward that girl I spoke to him about is a decent sample
  of his magnanimous practicality, or whatever you called it, I am afraid it
  won't carry him very far in that class of work."</p>

  <p>"And you won't help him?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"If you wish me to, yes," he replied; "but if you were not interested I
  should feel that I'd rather contribute my money directly to the support of
  his indigent cousin and his church rather than through the medium of the
  Society for the Uplift of Erring Women. He'd get it all then, and wouldn't
  have to whack up with the indigent relatives of the noble women who sacrifice
  their Monday evenings, except during July and August, to the uplift of their
  less-fortunate sisters."</p>

  <p>"You are entirely horrid today, Ogden," pouted Miss Welles. "You do not
  like Mr. Pursen."</p>

  <p>"Bless you, child, I don't know him. I've met him here perhaps a half
  dozen times&mdash;here, and in the newspapers. About all I've noticed about
  him is the poor, weak way he has of getting into print."</p>

  <p>Miss Welles flushed. She had heard that criticism of her hero before.</p>

  <p>"You are just like father," she said.</p>

  <p>"He can't, or won't understand how much Mr. Pursen shrinks from the
  unpleasant notoriety his great reform work forces upon him. Like you, father
  seems to imagine that he courts publicity, while as a matter of fact he
  suffers it solely because he cannot avoid it, and because he knows that only
  by bringing the conditions of vice that exist in the city clearly before the
  people can they be awakened to the gravity of the issue which confronts them.
  I think the fact that he goes on and on regardless of the frequency with
  which the newspapers drag his name into publicity is one of the finest things
  about him&mdash;it proves conclusively his sincerity and his manly
  courage."</p>

  <p>"All right, Sophie," replied Secor with one of his pleasant smiles, "if he
  succeeds in saving a single woman during his lifetime he will not have lived
  in vain, and there is every reason to hope for the best&mdash;Mr. Pursen is
  still a very young man."</p>

  <p>The talk drifted then from Mr. Pursen and reform to more personal and
  intimate matters. They discussed their plans for the future. Secor broached
  the subject of a wedding date for the hundredth time, and for the hundredth
  time Sophia Welles could not bring herself to be very definite in the
  matter.</p>

  <p>She fully intended to marry Ogden Secor. She had not worked laboriously a
  whole year to that end with any intention of relinquishing her prize now that
  she had won it; but Miss Welles was in no great haste to wed. She loved Secor
  as well as she knew how. He was quite good-looking, had plenty of wealth, and
  a social position second to none in the city. Had he had nothing but the
  social position, Miss Welles could not have found it in her heart to give him
  up, but with such a combination of assets he was by far the best catch in
  many a season.</p>

  <p>She had come from a small Indiana town where her father had made several
  fortunes in the automobile industry&mdash;saving them all and investing them
  wisely. She did not need to marry for money, though an alliance that would
  combine the wealth that would one day be hers with that of a wealthy husband
  was not to be ignored. What she did need was a stepping-stone to the social
  position she craved, but could not attain on the strength of her own name.
  Both she and her mother considered Ogden Secor an ideal stepping-stone,
  though neither had ever mentioned such a thing to the other.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact the Welleses were extremely nice people. Refined,
  educated cultured. Much nicer, if the truth could have found a champion of
  sufficient bravery to admit it, than many of the families to whose homes the
  feminine contingent of the Welles household craved entree; but their name was
  unknown in this new environment.</p>

  <p>It had never graced a special brand of ham; it had never been intimately
  related and for generations with the filth and crime of the politics of the
  municipality; it did not blazon itself before the public eye from above the
  doorways of a hundred ten-cent lunch-counters&mdash;no, the Welleses were
  new, unknown; they did not belong.</p>

  <p>But they meant to.</p>

  <p>Ogden Secor had always known nice girls, pretty girls, rich girls. He did
  not succumb to the wiles of Sophia Welles at first sight, for she had nothing
  new to offer him; but she had that way with her which some women have of
  suggesting to a man a manner of proprietorship over them&mdash;a something
  that appeals to the protective instinct of the male.</p>

  <p>It is done insidiously; you cannot put your finger on a single act that
  typifies it; yet before long the man comes to feel, without thinking about
  it, perhaps, that the woman belongs to him in a way. Then she plays her trump
  card. Just when she has him resting easily and comfortably in the belief that
  she looks to him for advice and guidance, she traps him into an attempt to
  exercise the power he thinks is his. Then she bowls him over merrily and does
  precisely as she pleases.</p>

  <p>What is the result? Take away from a man by force something that he has
  come to believe he possessed, and you create a burning desire for the
  thing&mdash;though maybe before he would not have given a nickel for it.</p>

  <p>So, when Ogden Secor discovered that Miss Welles admitted not his
  proprietorship over her, he immediately craved a real proprietorship, and the
  result was he discovered that he loved her.</p>

  <p>They had been engaged now for three months, but the wedding day seemed as
  far in the future as ever. Miss Welles was having an excellent time as the
  fiance of Mr. Ogden Secor. Already she had tasted of the fruits of conquest.
  Doors had opened to her that had previously been impregnable. She was in no
  haste to relinquish her freedom.</p>

  <p>The sudden death of the elder Secor early in the spring had, of course,
  necessitated a delay in the wedding plans; for both Miss and Mrs. Welles
  desired a pretentious ceremony. It seemed now that a year at least must
  elapse before the marriage could take place.</p>

  <p>As for Mr. Secor, he attempted to persuade his betrothed to slip away with
  him and be quietly married in some nearby town. Her father and mother could
  accompany them, and everything would be regular and lovely. He hated the idea
  of "the circus," as he called the affair the two women were planning.</p>

  <p>But they would not listen to him.</p>

  <p>Several times during the winter Secor met the Rev. Mr. Pursen at Miss
  Welles's. The more he saw of him the less he liked him, and the more he let
  Miss Welles see that he disliked her "parson," the more loyal she became to
  him.</p>

  <p>"One would think that you were engaged to Pursen instead of to me,"
  complained Mr. Secor on one occasion. "He is becoming a regular pest. I can
  scarcely ever find an opportunity to see you alone. Doesn't he know that we
  are engaged? Hasn't he any sense?"</p>

  <p>"He has a great deal of sense, Ogden," she replied, "and he knows that we
  are engaged. He also knows that you do not like him. He has told me so."</p>

  <p>"Then why does he persist in hanging around while I am here, Sophie?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"I think he wants to show his friendliness toward you and to win your
  friendship. I think it is perfectly sweet and noble of him&mdash;a sort of
  martyrdom to brotherly love, as it were."</p>

  <p>Carefully edited, Mr. Secor's reply would read: "Oh, piffle!"</p>

  <p>"Ogden! How can you!" she cried, "I didn't know that you had such an
  uncharitable strain in your make-up."</p>

  <p>"Clay feet will out," he laughed good-naturedly; "but really, Sophie, I'm
  sorry I was nasty. Forgive me, and I'll do my best to like your
  parson&mdash;in my poor, weak way.''</p>

  <p>"You'll have to like him, Ogden," she replied, "for we are bound to see a
  great deal of him! In the work that I am trying to do his assistance is
  invaluable&mdash;I am sure that the three of us can accomplish a great deal
  of good in this city could we but work in harmony&mdash;whole-heartedly for
  the uplift."</p>

  <p>"Anything to make you happy Sophie," he said, and then the conversation
  turned to other things.</p>

  <p>When he left she watched him as he walked to the curb and entered his car.
  Miss Welles was very proud of her fiance. She noted his splendid carriage,
  his strong face and well-set head; and then she sighed. She wished that he
  understood her hopes and aspirations, and was in sympathy with them as
  was&mdash;well&mdash;Mr. Pursen, for example.</p>

  <p>He understood.</p>

  <p>She found herself, quite unexpectedly, wondering why fate had not given
  Mr. Pursen a fat bank account and an old and socially honored name. How much
  more he could have accomplished, thus bucklered for the fight!</p>

     id="ch7">VII. &mdash; JUNE'S EMPLOYER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Late in December Mr. Secor was called to New York on a
  matter of business.</p>

  <p>"I'll be gone two or three weeks, Stickler," he said to his office
  manager; "and it'll be an excellent time to break in Miss Smith's successor.
  She'll be with us until the first of January, and that'll give her time to
  coach whoever you employ in her stead. Be sure you get a young woman of
  intelligence, and have her well versed in her duties before I return&mdash;I
  won't want to have to suffer the sorrows incident to breaking in a new
  stenographer myself with a bunch of accumulated matter piled up and waiting
  for me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied Mr. Stickler; "I'll see that you have a second Miss
  Smith if there's one to be found in the city. Too bad she had to go and get
  married&mdash;just when she was becoming invaluable."</p>

  <p>"Very inconsiderate of her, Stickler, I'm sure," said Secor, laughing.</p>

  <p>So Mr. Stickler inserted want ads in three papers and telephoned to the
  employment departments of three typewriter manufacturers. And it so happened
  that the following day June Lathrop, decently clothed with the money from
  Eddie's jewelry, walked into one of these departments, asking for an
  assignment.</p>

  <p>The woman in charge looked up with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Why, good morning, Miss Lathrop," she said. "Where in the world have you
  been? I thought we'd lost you entirely."</p>

  <p>She had never before realized what a really beautiful girl Miss Lathrop
  was. A few months since she had explained to her in as kindly a way as
  possible that it would be impossible for her to place her in the class of
  offices to which they catered unless she could come better clothed. She had
  not seen her again after that interview until now, and she had often wondered
  if she had offended the girl.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I've been doing temporary work about town," answered June; "but now I
  want a chance at a permanent position. Haven't you something that you could
  send me out on? Something really good."</p>

  <p>"I've just the thing, Miss Lathrop," replied the woman, fingering through
  a number of index cards in a little box on her desk.</p>

  <p>Presently she found what she sought, and for a moment was busy
  transcribing the contents of the card to a blank form.</p>

  <p>"Here," she said finally; "go to this number in the Railway Exchange and
  ask for Mr. Stickler. He wants a girl of more experience than you have had,
  but I really believe that you are fully competent to fill the position
  satisfactorily, and I have told him so in this note. I have asked him to give
  you a trial."</p>

  <p>"I don't know how I can thank you enough," cried the girl. "I shall make
  good, for I <i>must</i> make good."</p>

  <p>"Good luck, then," called the woman, as June left.</p>

  <p>In the Railway Exchange Building June found the suite number she sought.
  The door to the main office was open, and she did not see the lettering upon
  it as she entered. She wondered what the nature of the business might be, but
  that it was profitable was evidenced by the thick carpet upon the floor of
  the outer office; and by the simple elegance of the desks at which a number
  of clerks were working.</p>

  <p>At the information desk June asked for Mr. Stickler, presenting her note
  of introduction to the office-boy in charge. He was a tall, somber youth of
  sixteen who looked fully twenty-one. He eyed June from beneath stern brows,
  and then slunk silently toward a mahogany door upon the opposite side of the
  general office. Here he turned cautiously to cast a sudden, veiled look of
  suspicion in the girl's direction.</p>

  <p>"How perfectly weird," she thought. "He makes me feel as though I were a
  sneak-thief."</p>

  <p>Three minutes later June turned with a little jump to find the young man
  standing just behind her scowling down upon her in the most malevolent
  manner. He had left the private office by another door and entered the
  reception hall from the main corridor of the building.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she exclaimed; "you startled me."</p>

  <p>The youth almost smiled.</p>

  <p>"Come!" he whispered. "Follow me," and on silent feet he led her toward
  the private office across the room.</p>

  <p>Here she was ushered into the presence of Mr. Stickler&mdash;a bald-headed
  man with a thick neck and close-set eyes. At sight of the girl's face Mr.
  Stickler beamed pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Good morning," he said. "Have a chair. You come well recommended, I see.
  Mrs. Carson has never failed to furnish us with the most competent help that
  we have had. She tells me that you have had little practical experience; but
  she is positive that you can do our work most satisfactorily."</p>

  <p>"If it is not too technical I am sure I can," replied June.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing about it but what you can learn quickly if you set
  yourself to it," replied Mr. Stickler kindly. He had interviewed a dozen
  applicants already and he was tiring of the job. This was the first who had
  been good to look at; and good looks were a primary requisite to employment
  under Mr. Stickler. June's face had won more than half the battle for
  her.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind taking a little dictation now and transcribing it for me,
  as a sort of test, you know?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not at all; I should be very glad to," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Good!" he exclaimed. "There are many applicants who will not take a test.
  They say it is unfair."</p>

  <p>"It is as fair for one as another," she replied. "I cannot see how you are
  to judge as to my qualifications in any other way."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stickler drew a note-book and pencil from his desk, and June removed
  her wraps and gloves. For five minutes he dictated continuously and rather
  rapidly; but he enunciated his words distinctly, and not once did June find
  it necessary to stop him or ask for a repetition.</p>

  <p>When he had finished he sat back in his chair and smiled at her. He had
  purposely made the test unusually hard, for he had decided that the girl
  would do&mdash;she was too good-looking to be lost&mdash;and so he wanted an
  excuse in case she fell down on the test. If he made it exceptionally
  difficult, it would not prove that she was incompetent should she make
  numerous errors, for even an easy test is a nerve-racking experience, and the
  best of stenographers often fall down through nervousness.</p>

  <p>Of course, if the result proved that she was absolutely hopeless, he could
  not employ her; but if she showed the slightest indication of ability, he
  would give her a trial.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you got it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course!" she replied, surprised.</p>

  <p>"Good! I made it as hard as I could. If you can transcribe that with less
  than ten per cent errors, you will be doing splendidly for one entirely
  unaccustomed to my dictation and the terms I used."</p>

  <p>"Where can I find a machine?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stickler touched a bell.</p>

  <p>"Miss Smith," he said to the young lady who entered in response to his
  summons, "this is Miss Lathrop. She has just taken a test. Will you let her
  use your machine, please, to transcribe for a few minutes?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. Come with me, Miss Lathrop." And she led June to a small room
  off the private office.</p>

  <p>In ten minutes June knocked upon Mr. Stickler's door.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he called, and as he saw who it was: "Stuck?" he asked with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"No, indeed; I've finished."</p>

  <p>"Well, well; that's fine. Let me see it."</p>

  <p>June handed him a typewritten sheet, standing before him as he scanned
  it.</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" he said when he had finished reading it. "Excellent! Not an
  error. I think I need look no further, Miss Lathrop, if we can arrange the
  question of wages satisfactorily. Be seated, please. Now, what do you believe
  would satisfy you to start?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'd rather leave that to you," said June.</p>

  <p>"Miss Smith has been with us for five years," said Mr. Stickler. "She is
  leaving on the first to be married. We pay her twenty-five dollars a week. On
  the first she would have been raised to thirty had she remained. Would you
  care to start at twenty, with every assurance of an increase as soon as you
  are familiar with our work?"</p>

  <p>Nine dollars a week was the largest wage June had ever received since she
  left Farris's, and that for but a single week in a temporary position. Would
  she accept twenty? She tried not to look too eager. With difficulty she
  seemed to hesitate, as though weighing in her mind the possibilities of the
  future against the present small pittance that had been offered her. Mr.
  Stickler eyed her steadily.</p>

  <p>"The hours are not bad," he commenced.</p>

  <p>"I do not care anything about the hours," she replied.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stickler had it on his tongue's end to raise it to
  twenty-five&mdash;there were few girls applying for positions who did not ask
  about the hours at the first opportunity they had. Here was an exceptionally
  rapid and accurate stenographer who cared nothing about hours&mdash;she was
  indeed a find; and further, she was the finest-looking girl be had ever seen
  in his life. But before he had an opportunity June spoke.</p>

  <p>"I think that will be satisfactory," she said. "When shall you want
  me?"</p>

  <p>"When can you come?"</p>

  <p>"Any time."</p>

  <p>"Eight-thirty tomorrow morning."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said June. "I'll be here promptly. Good day."</p>

  <p>"Good day, Miss Lathrop."</p>

  <p>In the reception hall the furtive-eyed office-boy shot a keen glance at
  the young woman through half-closed lids as he looked up from some loose,
  printed sheets over which he had been bent in close study. He saw her glance
  at the name upon the door, which was now visible to her as she approached the
  doorway. He saw her give a sudden start and pale as though she had seen a
  dead man. Her hands went suddenly to her breast as she stood wide-eyed,
  gazing in horror at the neat, black lettering of the name.</p>

  <p>Then she caught the boy's eyes upon her, and with a little effort she
  regained her composure and walked calmly from the office.</p>

  <p>"John Secor &amp; Co.!" she murmured to herself. "My God, I can never do
  it!"</p>

  <p>But she did, and the next morning found her at work in the
  mahogany-furnished inner office of John Secor &amp; Co. The girl could not
  recall that she had spent such another night of indecision and anguish for
  many a long month, until, with the close approach of dawn, she had determined
  to stifle the sorrow and loathing that thought of constant employment in that
  office induced, and take the position.</p>

  <p>The twenty dollars a week meant to her, possibly, life itself, as well as
  the means of pursuing the straight and narrow path upon which a young man's
  smile had set her feet. She often wondered about him and if she should ever
  see him again. Some day she would like to thank him, she felt, for what he
  had done for her. Doubtless he had forgotten both her and the
  incident&mdash;she rather hoped that he had.</p>

  <p>With her first week's pay, June partially repaid Eddie the Dip the money
  he had loaned her. For this purpose she met him at the little joint around
  the corner where one can feed up swell on two bits. Eddie was apparently as
  delighted with June's success as she herself, and that his pleasure was
  sincere was evidenced by the genuine disinclination he showed to accept a
  return of his money. But the girl insisted, and at last Eddie took the bills
  reluctantly.</p>

  <p>In the far corner of the dingy restaurant a heavy man sat alone at a
  little table. He had been buried in an evening paper as the two had entered,
  so had not noticed them. When finally he looked up, running his shrewd eyes
  quickly about the room, he recognized Eddie the Dip, who sat facing him upon
  the farther side of the eating-place, near the cashier's desk.</p>

  <p>No changed expression marked his recognition. Immediately he resumed his
  paper, turning in his chair so that while appearing to be reading he might
  surreptitiously watch the newcomers through the fly-specked mirror that
  circled the room above the wainscot. He had no further interest in them than
  that of semiofficial curiosity, and having recognized the man, he wished to
  discover the identity of his companion.</p>

  <p>It was not until the two rose to leave that the girl turned her head so
  that the man in the far corner caught a view of her features. At sight of
  them he pursed his lips into a silent whistle of surprise; then Eddie the Dip
  paid the checks and the two passed out into the brilliantly lighted
  street.</p>

  <p>The man at the table drew a note-book from his pocket, and with a stub of
  pencil wrote, laboriously, two names, the date, the hour, and the place; then
  he resumed the demolition of a large platter of "ham and eggs."</p>

  <p>Outside the restaurant Eddie bade June good night.</p>

  <p>"You run along now, kid," he said. "It wouldn't help you none to be seen
  with me."</p>

  <p>The girl objected, though she knew well the truth of his statement. He
  alone in all the great city had evinced disinterested friendship in her and
  had given her real and substantial aid when she most needed it. Her sense of
  gratitude and loyalty was strong, and she would rather have missed almost
  anything than to have hurt the young man's feelings.</p>

  <p>Doubtless Eddie guessed the truth of her sentiments; for he was firm in
  his insistence that she "run along home."</p>

  <p>"You've been so good to me, Eddie," she said, "I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Forget it," admonished the Dip. "What's money for, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"It is not the money I was thinking about," she replied, "though, of
  course, I could have done nothing without it&mdash;it's that you have been
  willing to believe that I wanted to be on the square&mdash;that I could be,
  and were willing to help me without"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"without
  expecting anything in return."</p>

  <p>"Have I ever done anything to you, Mag," he asked with a laugh, "that
  gives you any license to class me with them Commonwealth Avenue or Lake Shore
  Drive guys?"</p>

  <p>The following Monday morning June sat at her desk in the little office
  just outside that of the president of John Secor &amp; Co. Ten days had
  passed since she commenced work there, and under the careful tutorage of Miss
  Smith and Mr. Stickler she had progressed rapidly in the assimilation of the
  details of her work.</p>

  <p>Ogden Secor, the president of the company, she had not seen, as his return
  from New York had been delayed. She found herself wondering what he might
  look like, and if she should be able to continue in his employ after he
  returned. Now it was not quite so bad, for he was just a name; but when she
  should be compelled to come into daily contact with him, sit for hours,
  perhaps, close beside him as he dictated, would it not be very different and
  very terrible? The girl shuddered.</p>

  <p>It was ten o'clock when Mr. Stickler opened the door from the president's
  office and called her. As Mr. Stickler often had given her work in this
  office before, she gathered up her note-book and pencil as she replied to his
  summons.</p>

  <p>Somehow she did not like Mr. Stickler particularly. He had a way of
  looking at her out of his fishy eyes that fell little short of being
  insultingly suggestive. When Mr. Secor returned she knew that she would be
  released from this distasteful ogling&mdash;unless Mr. Secor chanced to be of
  the same brand.</p>

  <p>This, however, she doubted; for since her entrance into the world of
  business the girl had learned that the great majority of office men accord
  the same respect to their female coworkers&mdash;as they do to their own
  sisters. That there were exceptions she had also discovered.</p>

  <p>At the door Mr. Stickler met her.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he said, "Mr. Secor has returned; I wish to introduce you to
  him."</p>

  <p>June felt suddenly all cold. She had known that this must come some time,
  but to that very instant she had not dreamed how terribly she dreaded the
  ordeal. Her heart seemed to go dead within her, and it was with difficulty
  that she raised her eyes to the face of the man who had risen courteously at
  her entrance. That she knew he had never before set eyes upon her did not
  lighten her burden of apprehension&mdash;it seemed that he must read the
  tragic truth that ran screaming through her brain.</p>

  <p>And then at last she looked at him&mdash;the pleasant, honest smile; the
  cordial, outstretched hand. From cold she went hot. Could such a frightful
  contretemps actually occur in real life?</p>

  <p>The man before her&mdash;her employer&mdash;was the young man whose kindly
  words had set her upon the road of righteousness! Would he remember her?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8">VIII. &mdash; SAMMY THE SLEUTH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Ogden Secor did not recognize June Lathrop as Maggie Lynch,
  the girl from Farris's, and it was with relief that almost found expression
  in an audible sigh that the girl returned to her desk in her own office.</p>

  <p>Here she surprised the lank and somber office-boy, Sammy, in the act of
  closing one of the drawers of her desk.</p>

  <p>"What do you want, Sammy?" she asked pleasantly.</p>

  <p>The youth went from white to red, and from red to scarlet. He stammered
  and coughed&mdash;trying to frame an apology, until June, from mild
  wonderment, became keenly suspicious.</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully sorry, Miss Lathrop," he managed to get out at last. "I
  didn't mean any harm&mdash;I was only practising."</p>

  <p>"Practising?" exclaimed the girl. "Practising what?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Sammy, "that I'll have to tell you now; but I didn't
  want any one to know until I had graduated and got a position with
  Pinkerton."</p>

  <p>"Pinkerton?" questioned June, still at a loss to make head or tail of what
  the youth was leading to. "What has practising or Pinkerton to do with
  searching my desk surreptitiously? It was a very ungentlemanly thing to do,
  Sammy, and I really ought to tell Mr. Stickler about it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, please don't do that," wailed Sammy. "Please don't and I'll tell you
  all about it."</p>

  <p>"All right," said June, "now tell me."</p>

  <p>"You see," said Sammy nervously, "I'm taking a correspondence course in a
  detective school, and a part of each lesson is to put into practise what I
  have learned in former lessons. Just now I was practising searching a
  burglar's flat. Almost every day I practise shadowing."</p>

  <p>"Shadowing?" exclaimed June. "What is shadowing? How do you do it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's easy," replied Sammy, his confidence returning as he discovered
  that June appeared to have forgiven the liberties he had taken with her
  desk.</p>

  <p>"You see," he continued, "a detective has to be able to follow a suspect
  all over without being seen himself. I practise on lots of people&mdash;Mr.
  Stickler, Mr. Secor, Miss Smith, and the rest of them. When they go to lunch
  I shadow them, a different one nearly every noon. Friday I shadowed
  you&mdash;right into the Lunch Club on Wabash Avenue, and ate at a table
  behind you, and followed you back to the office and you never got onto me at
  all."</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" shivered June. "How uncanny. Don't you ever dare shadow me again
  Sammy&mdash;promise me," and Sammy promised.</p>

  <p>After the new stenographer had left his office, Ogden Secor tried to
  recall where he had known her before. He was positive that her face was
  familiar, and connected with some event in his life that was none too
  pleasant; but try as he would he could not place the girl. At last he dropped
  the matter from his mind.</p>

  <p>For several months thereafter the routine of June's new life ran on
  smoothly and uninterruptedly. She saved the major portion of her salary, and
  once more met Eddie the Dip in the little restaurant that she might pay him
  the balance of the money she owed him.</p>

  <p>Daily association with the life of the office of John Secor &amp; Co. and
  its president eventually dulled the first revulsion she had experienced at
  thought of taking employment there. She found Ogden Secor all that she had
  grown to believe him since the day that he had come into her life from out of
  the grand jury room.</p>

  <p>Of Mr. Stickler she grew more and more suspicious. There was no tangible
  overt act upon his part on which she could put her finger; nevertheless, she
  could have sworn, after a month of him, that he was a "hunter" without the
  nerve to hunt. He was, she grew sure, the sort that would take advantage of
  her first misstep to snare her, and so, without fearing him, she watched him
  and herself lest he might find some pretext upon which to make an initial
  advance toward her.</p>

  <p>With the exception of Sammy, the office force was most uninteresting to
  any one outside themselves. Sammy was a never-ending source of joy to her now
  that she understood the motives which prompted his stealthy, catlike tread,
  his furtive glances, and his highly melodramatic appearances from directions
  in which one would least expect him to materialize.</p>

  <p>As June never laughed at him&mdash;openly&mdash;he took a great liking to
  her, coming to her with his new lessons, with his hopes and his aspirations.
  His one and only ambition was to become a Pinkerton man, and he fully
  believed that once armed with the diploma of the correspondence school to
  which he paid half his weekly salary, it would be simply a matter of
  presenting it to the head of the detective agency to insure him an open-armed
  reception and an immediate appointment&mdash;didn't the prospectus of the
  school say so almost in so many words?</p>

  <p>So secure had June grown to feel in the belief that her old life was
  absolutely dead and forgotten, and that Ogden Secor would never know that his
  private stenographer had been an inmate of Abe Farris's, that the shock of an
  occurrence through which she had to pass four months after taking the
  position all but unnerved her.</p>

  <p>There was a caller in Secor's office, and as the buzzer upon June's desk
  sounded she took up her note-book and pencil to respond as she was called
  upon to do a dozen times in a day.</p>

  <p>Scarce had she entered the inner office, however, than her heart seemed to
  cease its beating. Facing her, and looking squarely into her eyes as she
  passed through the doorway, sat the Rev. Theodore Pursen.</p>

  <p>A look of half-recognition lighted his expression at sight of her.
  Instantly June jumped to the conclusion that he had come there to expose her
  but she managed to hold herself under perfect control as she advanced across
  the room to Secor's side, nor did she even, by a second glance at the
  visitor's face, betray the fact that she recalled ever having seen him
  before.</p>

  <p>Secor handed her a memorandum.</p>

  <p>"Make out a check," he said, "for this amount to the order of the Society
  for the Uplift of Erring Women."</p>

  <p>June took the slip of paper and returned to her own office.</p>

  <p>"Your secretary's face is quite familiar to me," remarked Pursen, after
  the girl had closed the door.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" queried Secor politely, and uninterestedly. As a matter of fact, he
  was interested in nothing much that interested the Rev. Mr.
  Pursen&mdash;other than Sophia Welles.</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure that I know her, but I cannot place her," continued Mr.
  Pursen. "Possibly her name might recall her to me."</p>

  <p>"Her name is Lathrop," replied Secor.</p>

  <p>Pursen shook his head. "I must be mistaken after all," he said, "I never
  knew any one of that name," and then June returned with the check.</p>

  <p>For several days she was in a state of nervous apprehension, momentarily
  expecting a summons from either Mr. Secor or Mr. Stickler that would close
  her career with John Secor &amp; Co.; but why she should dread discharge she
  could not guess, for she no longer felt a single doubt but that she should
  always be able to find pleasant and lucrative employment.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, she finally decided, it was not so much discharge she
  feared, as that Ogden Secor should know her for what she once had been. The
  thought sent her white with terror, and with it came another
  thought&mdash;how much did her daily contact with Ogden Secor mean to her
  more than she had even faintly suspected?</p>

  <p>Never before had this idea impinged upon her thoughts. She tried to thrust
  it from her. It was horrible. How horrible only she could guess; and yet,
  once fastened upon her, it clung tenaciously, a mighty load upon her
  conscience&mdash;a veritable Old Man of the Sea&mdash;so that she dreaded
  coming into Secor's presence for fear he might guess not only her secret, but
  as well the awful truth which made it the hideous thing it was.</p>

  <p>Weeks rolled by. September came. June was once more lulled into a feeling
  of security. Secor was in New York on business. Sammy had been diligently
  practising his lesson on thieves' jargon upon June until, convulsed with
  laughter, she had sent him back to his desk in the outer office.</p>

  <p>Two rings of her buzzer called her to Mr. Stickler's desk. That fateful
  buzzer! Since the day that it had summoned her into the Rev. Theodore
  Pursen's presence she had never heard it without an inward shudder. To her
  relief she found that Mr. Stickler wished her merely upon an unimportant
  matter of detail. As he talked, Sammy entered, lynx-eyed and
  pussy-footed&mdash;Sammy could not cross the outer office, even to the
  water-cooler, without assuming a Hawkshawian gait that would have turned that
  worthy sleuth green with envy could he have seen it.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stickler!" he whispered, "two harness bulls are looking for you."</p>

  <p>"Harness bulls!" exclaimed Stickler.</p>

  <p>"What are harness bulls, Sammy?"</p>

  <p>"Harness bulls," quoted Sammy from his recent lesson on criminal slang,
  "are policemen in uniform."</p>

  <p>The sudden sickly pallor which overspread the face of the office manager
  did not pass unnoticed by either June or Sammy.</p>

  <p>"Did they say what they wanted of me?" asked Mr. Stickler, controlling his
  voice with an effort.</p>

  <p>Sammy lowered his own to a mysterious whisper. "They want you," he said,
  "to buy some tickets to the annual policemen's benefit at the
  Auditorium."</p>

  <p>"Show them in," commanded Mr. Stickler in evident relief&mdash;even the
  best of men are often obsessed with an inexplicable terror of the minions of
  the law.</p>

  <p>"That is all, Miss Lathrop," he added, turning toward June. "You may
  go."</p>

  <p>As the girl left Mr. Stickler's office to cross the outer room to her own
  she saw two burly officers trailing in the wake of a suddenly metamorphosed
  Sammy. The youth walked with devilish swagger and outpuffed chest. In his
  mind's eye Sammy was leading his trusty bluecoats to the arrest of a gang of
  counterfeiters whom he had tracked to their hidden lair.</p>

  <p>As June passed the three she glanced casually into the faces of the
  policemen, and as her eyes met those of one of them it required every ounce
  of her self-control to hide both her surprise and terror.</p>

  <p>It was Doarty.</p>

  <p>A very suave and gracious Mr. Stickler laughed and chatted with the two
  policemen, purchased ten tickets to the benefit with John Secor &amp; Co.'s
  money, and passed out a handful of John Secor &amp; Co.'s cigars. As the two
  were about to leave, one of them turned to Mr. Stickler.</p>

  <p>"How long have you had Maggie Lynch in your employ?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Maggie Lynch?" repeated Mr. Stickler. "We have no one by that name on our
  pay-roll."</p>

  <p>"Well, then," said Mr. Doarty, "the young woman who came out of your
  office just before we came in?"</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Mr. Stickler, "that is Miss Lathrop&mdash;Mr. Secor's private
  stenographer."</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything about her?" asked Mr. Doarty, "or don't you want
  to?"</p>

  <p>"Why, she seems to be all right," said Mr. Stickler. "But we know nothing
  about her other than that she had satisfactory references from former
  employers."</p>

  <p>"Did she bring one from Abe Farris?" asked Doarty with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Abe Farris?" exclaimed Mr. Stickler, and there was a little choking sound
  in his voice that entirely escaped the wily Mr. Doarty.</p>

  <p>"Sure," said he, and then he leaned down and whispered into Mr. Stickler's
  ear for a moment. "&mdash;and," he concluded, "I just thought that maybe Mr.
  Secor might like to know the training his private secretary has had in the
  past&mdash;you'd better keep an eye on her. Good day, and much obliged to you
  for taking those tickets."</p>

  <p>It was not until nearly five o'clock that June's buzzer rang again,
  summoning her to Mr. Stickler's office. Already the force in the outer office
  was preparing to depart for the day. Mr. Stickler wished to dictate an
  "important letter," though to June, after he had commenced it it seemed
  rather too trivial for an overtime epistle.</p>

  <p>For fifteen minutes Mr. Stickler dragged out his monotonous dictation.
  Then he rose and went to the door of his office. All had departed&mdash;the
  office was empty. He returned to his desk.</p>

  <p>"Miss Lathrop," he said, "I have always liked you&mdash;in fact, I have
  grown very fond of you since you have been with us. I have been thinking that
  I must ask Mr. Secor to increase your salary; but before I do so I should
  like to feel that we are good friends&mdash;very good friends indeed, for
  only in connection with the most harmonious relations may we work together to
  the best advantage."</p>

  <p>June was at a loss to guess what the man might be driving at. All she knew
  was that she did not like the sly expression of his little, close-set eyes,
  or the familiar manner in which he was hitching his chair closer to hers.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I do not quite understand you," she said, her tone
  respectful, but cold and keen as a razor edge.</p>

  <p>"I mean," said Mr. Stickler, "that I would like to see more of you outside
  of business hours&mdash;it will mean a lot to you in the way of advancement,"
  he hastened to add as he saw the steely glitter that leaped to her eyes at
  his words.</p>

  <p>June Lathrop rose. Mr. Stickler realized that never before had he seen any
  one quite so majestic, or quite so beautiful.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately," she said, "Mr. Secor will return tomorrow. Otherwise I
  should leave at once. I shall not work another day in the same office with
  you, and tomorrow I shall give you an hour after Mr. Secor returns to tell
  him precisely what has passed between us in this office, then I shall go to
  him with my resignation and tell him myself."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stickler went white with fear. He knew that the girl would do just
  what she threatened&mdash;unless&mdash;He glared at her and caught at the one
  straw that could save him.</p>

  <p>"What else will you tell him?" he asked. "What else will Maggie Lynch tell
  Mr. Ogden Secor?"</p>

  <p>It was June's turn to pale. Stickler saw the color leave her face and took
  advantage of the point in his favor.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "be a good fellow. I don't want to be hard on you, and
  I'll forget all I know about Maggie Lynch and her job at Abe Farris's if
  you'll treat me right. Let's forget we've had any unpleasantness. We'll go
  over to the Bismark and have a bite to eat and talk it over. Come on, little
  one, be a sport!"</p>

  <p>The sneer on the girl's lip was sufficient reply to Mr. Stickler's
  suggestion. As she turned her back upon him and moved toward the door he
  sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he shouted, "I'll teach you. You're fired&mdash;do you
  understand? You're fired. I won't have any fast woman in this office, and if
  you show your face around here again I'll have Officer Doarty waiting for
  you."</p>

  <p>June made no reply. Quietly she gathered up her personal belongings and
  left the office. When she had gone, Mr. Stickler banged to the office door
  and strode angrily toward the elevators.</p>

  <p>No sooner had he left than a very pale and shaky Sammy emerged from
  beneath the sanitary filing-case in Mr. Stickler's office. He was "frightened
  stiff "; but with a grim determination that was upborne by a glorious
  enthusiasm he set forth to "shadow" Mr. Stickler.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9">IX. &mdash; "UNCLEAN&mdash;UNCLEAN!"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Ogden Secor, stopping over at South Bend on his return from
  New York, arrived in town late in the evening of the day that had witnessed
  June's discharge. His chauffeur met him at the Lake Shore station, and
  together they drove down Jackson Boulevard to Michigan Avenue.</p>

  <p>As the car swung to the north into the broad thoroughfare along the lake,
  Secor glanced up mechanically at the windows of his offices in the Railway
  Exchange, as he had done upon countless other occasions that he had passed
  the building.</p>

  <p>To his surprise he saw that the rooms were lighted. It was past the hour
  that the janitor's assistants ordinarily cleaned his suite.</p>

  <p>"Stickler," he thought. "He must be working on something of importance
  tonight. Pull up here, Jim!" to the chauffeur. "I'll run across to the office
  a minute before I go home."</p>

  <p>For years Ogden Secor had entered his private office through a doorway
  that opened directly off the main corridor. The custom had become so strong a
  habit that tonight he passed the main entrance of the well-lighted outer
  office, unlocked the door to his own unlighted office and entered,
  noiselessly, upon the soft, heavy rug that covered the floor.</p>

  <p>A moment later he had crossed to the door that opened into the main
  office. Scarcely had he swung the door partially aside than his attitude of
  careless ease gave place to one of tense excitement. Directly across the
  office from him, with their backs toward him, two men bent to the combination
  of the great safe.</p>

  <p>Secor's first impulse was to rush in upon them before they should damage
  the expensive and intricate mechanism of the lock with the charge of
  nitro-glycerine he imagined they were preparing to detonate; but as he took a
  step forward he suddenly realized that one of the men was turning the
  combination knob while the other read off the figures to him from a little
  slip of paper.</p>

  <p>They had the combination. Where could they have obtained it? Only
  Stickler, Miss Lathrop and himself knew it. He looked at the men
  closely&mdash;he did not remember ever having seen either of them before.</p>

  <p>Presently the door of the safe swung open, and Secor saw him who had
  manipulated the knob reach directly and without hesitation for the inner
  drawer that contained, ordinarily, a considerable quantity of negotiable
  paper. He waited to see no more.</p>

  <p>Without a sound he ran quickly across the office, his only weapon, a light
  walking stick, swinging in his right hand. The first that either of the
  cracksmen knew that they were not alone in the office was the sudden and
  painful descent of the walking stick across the back of the head of one of
  them.</p>

  <p>What happened after that happened rapidly&mdash;and almost
  noiselessly.</p>

  <p>Two hours later Jim, the chauffeur, commenced to wonder if his employer
  had fallen asleep up there in his office. The North-East wind from off the
  lake was chill and penetrating. For another half hour Jim walked up and down
  the deserted sidewalk in a vain attempt to keep warm.</p>

  <p>He had about decided to go up to the office and politely remind his
  employer that it would soon be time to breakfast when he heard a shot,
  apparently from the rear of the Railway Exchange across the street. The shot
  was immediately followed by hoarse shouts, and the sound of running men, and
  then another shot.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately after the second shot Jim saw a man run out of Jackson
  Boulevard across Michigan Avenue toward Grant Park. He reached the center of
  the street only to crumple suddenly into a little heap. Behind him came a
  uniformed watchman, and presently a little crowd gathered.</p>

  <p>"Caught him trying to make his getaway through the alley," explained the
  watchman to a city policeman who, attracted by the shots, had run over from
  Wabash Avenue. "There was another guy with him, but he broke in the opposite
  direction and got away. They'd been up to something in the Railway
  Exchange."</p>

  <p>Instantly Jim thought of his employer and the unaccountably long stay he
  had been making in his office. Could these men have been the cause of his
  detention? Turning at the thought, he ran across the street and into the
  building.</p>

  <p>At first the night elevator-man was disinclined to take him up; but when
  be explained who he was and what his fears, the man not only carried him
  aloft but accompanied him to the office of John Secor &amp; Co.</p>

  <p>Here they found the door to the main office ajar, and within, upon the
  opposite side of the room in front of the open safe, the unconscious form of
  Ogden Secor. His head and face were covered with blood&mdash;even a casual
  glance proclaimed the fact that he had been terribly beaten. An ambulance
  from St. Luke's bore Ogden Secor to the hospital. It was late the following
  morning before the physicians would permit any one to enter his room, and
  then only after the greatest insistence on the part of their patient.</p>

  <p>Miss Welles and the Rev. Mr. Pursen were the first to come. They were
  closely followed by Mr. Stickler, for whom Secor had sent. Mr. Stickler
  entered, white and shaky. It was quite evident that the accident to his
  employer had been a terrible shock to him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Stickler had read an account of the daring robbery in his morning
  paper. He had known that Ogden Secor lay at St. Luke's hospital; but he had
  paced up and down his office for two hours before receiving Secor's summons
  to his bedside. Even then he had put off the ordeal for another half
  hour&mdash;surely Mr. Stickler's must have been a most sympathetic
  temperament, which shrank from the sight of the mangled countenance of his
  employer!</p>

  <p>Before he started for the hospital he used the telephone.</p>

  <p>"Is Officer Doarty there?" he asked, when he had obtained his
  connection.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Mr. Doarty. You've read of what happened to Mr. Secor last
  night?</p>

  <p>"And did you notice that the fellow they got&mdash;the one who was
  wounded&mdash;has been recognized as an habitu of Abe Farris's? Yes, and do
  you remember what you told me about that Lynch girl yesterday? Did you know
  she knew the combination to the safe? Sure; I thought of that right away.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you bet. Wait a minute&mdash;I've got it here in my file. Here it
  is&mdash;Calumet Avenue," and he gave a number, "she's rooming there. You'd
  better hurry. You'll be lucky if she hasn't left town already.</p>

  <p>"What? Oh, I don't know yet&mdash;I've been too upset to figure it up, but
  it must have been close to twenty-five thousand dollars. No, bring her right
  to the hospital&mdash;I'll be there. All right. Good-by."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later Mr. Stickler, on tiptoe and hat in hand, approached the
  bedside of his wounded chief. On his face was an expression of funereal
  sorrow.</p>

  <p>"This is terrible," he murmured huskily.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Secor with a wan smile, "they didn't quite get me, though it
  wasn't any fault of theirs that they didn't. Have you discovered just what
  they got away with, Stickler?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Stickler hemmed and hawed. Evidently the answering of that question
  was one he dreaded.</p>

  <p>"Why, I'm not quite sure yet, Mr. Secor," he said at last; "but there was,
  unfortunately, a considerable amount of negotiable securities as well as
  currency in the safe last night. You see, we had an exceptionally large pay
  roll on two big jobs for today, and we had drawn the cash yesterday because
  today, being Saturday, and a short day, we wanted to have everything in
  readiness to pay off promptly at noon."</p>

  <p>"We've never been in the habit of doing that, Mr. Stickler," was Secor's
  only comment. "But come, how much did they get?"</p>

  <p>"Close to twenty-five thousand dollars," whispered Mr. Stickler, and that
  it cost him an effort to say it was apparent to those about the bedside as
  well as to the injured man.</p>

  <p>"But I think we'll get it all back," Mr. Stickler hastened to add. "They
  caught one of the fellows, and Doarty&mdash;of the detective
  bureau&mdash;telephoned me this morning that he expected to make an arrest
  within a few hours of the principal in the case."</p>

  <p>"Good," exclaimed Secor. "But I cannot imagine who it could have been, or
  how they obtained the combination to the safe. Do you suspect any one in the
  office, Stickler?"</p>

  <p>"I'd rather not say just yet, Mr. Secor," replied Stickler, "though I have
  my suspicions. When Doarty comes I think he will bring a big surprise along
  with him."</p>

  <p>"It must have been through the connivance of some one in the office that
  they obtained the combination," said Miss Welles.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pursen nodded. In the back of his brain an almost dead memory was
  struggling toward the light. Somehow it was inextricably confused with
  recollection of the face of Ogden Secor's stenographer, and a haunting,
  though vague, conviction that he had met the girl before and under no
  pleasant circumstances.</p>

  <p>A moment later there came a knock upon the door. Mr. Pursen crossed the
  room and opened it, admitting a young woman and a large man. One glance at
  the latter would have been all sufficient to identify him to one city bred.
  There is something about the usual plain clothes man&mdash;whether his build,
  his carriage, or the way he wears his clothes, is difficult to say&mdash;that
  tags him almost as convincingly as would a uniform.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mr. Doarty, good morning," purred Mr. Pursen. He recognized June with
  an inclination of his head&mdash;very slight indeed.</p>

  <p>The girl crossed directly to Secor's side.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Secor," she exclaimed, her voice trembling with emotion. "It is
  awful. I had not seen a paper this morning and did not know until Mr. Doarty
  came for me, and told me."</p>

  <p>She did not say what else Mr. Doarty had told her, principally by
  innuendo. Self was forgotten in the real affliction she felt at sight of her
  employer's pitiable condition. Secor looked up at her, his old, pleasant
  smile lighting his features.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I guess it's not so bad," he said. "They ought to have me out of here
  in no time."</p>

  <p>Miss Welles came closer to the bedside. Instinctively she guessed why
  Doarty had brought the girl here. Secor alone seemed to realize no connection
  between Mr. Stickler's recent hint and the coming of June Lathrop with the
  plain clothes man.</p>

  <p>Doarty crossed the room to June's side, laying a heavy hand upon her
  arm.</p>

  <p>"None of the soft stuff, Mag," he said roughly; "cut it out."</p>

  <p>Secor looked up at the man in surprise, a frown crossing his face.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this?" he asked. "Miss Lathrop is my secretary.
  There has been nothing in her manner at all offensive&mdash;to me."</p>

  <p>"I guess you don't know who she is, Mr. Secor," said Doarty. "Her name
  ain't Lathrop&mdash;it's Lynch, Maggie Lynch, and when I first seen her she
  was an inmate of Abe Farris's joint on Dearborn."</p>

  <p>Secor looked at June questioningly. There was an expression of disbelief
  in his eyes. The girl dropped her own before his steady gaze.</p>

  <p>The horror of it! If he could know&mdash;if Ogden Secor of all other men
  on earth could but know the truth&mdash;the truth that not even the shrewd
  Mr. Doarty had guessed.</p>

  <p>At the voicing of the name Maggie Lynch, the Rev. Mr. Pursen stepped
  suddenly forward. The mists had been swept from his memory. As distinctly as
  it had been yesterday he recalled the humiliation that this girl had put upon
  him before the representatives of several of the city's great dailies. Even
  now he flushed at the memory of the keen shafts of ridicule that had
  resulted, and which had made the papers of the following day such frightful
  nightmares to him.</p>

  <p>"Don't you remember her, Mr. Secor?" he cried. "She's the woman we tried
  so hard to help, and who ignored our godly efforts."</p>

  <p>Mr. Secor remembered. He recalled the scene within the Grand jury room,
  and in the antechamber without. And he recalled many other things of which
  the others knew nothing&mdash;the intelligence and the loyalty of the girl
  since she had been in his employ. He remembered the several occasions upon
  which her tact or judgment had saved him from severe losses. He thought of
  the pleasure that he had always experienced in taking up the day's work since
  June Lathrop had been with him&mdash;something that he had never realized
  until that moment&mdash;and something of a dull ache oppressed his heart with
  the sudden knowledge that it was all over.</p>

  <p>He had always thought of her merely as a part of the office force. He had
  never for a moment considered her in any other light than a faithful and
  almost flawless stenographer&mdash;nor did he now; yet there was a distinct
  sensation of personal loss accompanying the knowledge that he could now no
  longer employ her in so intimate a capacity as that of private secretary. His
  Puritanical prudery was too deeply ingrained to permit even a thought to the
  contrary.</p>

  <p>To him, so far as his own personal association with such a person was
  concerned, the girl was as good as damned. He would as easily have considered
  consociation with a leper, though he would have been equally as willing to
  have helped either one or the other in any other way that did not require him
  to come into contact with them.</p>

  <p>"What did you bring her here for?" he asked wearily. "There has been
  nothing in her deportment since she has been in my employ but what was
  entirely proper. It seems unnecessary that she should be subjected to this
  humiliation."</p>

  <p>"Her deportment <i>in the office</i> may have been all right," spoke up
  Mr. Doarty, "but we don't know so much what she was doin' with her time after
  office hours."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stickler nodded his head portentously.</p>

  <p>"You see, Mr. Secor," went on the plain-clothes man, "one of the guys that
  slugged you hangs out at Abe Farris's saloon, an' I seen Mag here, not so
  long ago, feedin' up in a beanery with another crook that hangs out at
  Farris's&mdash;Eddie the Dip's his name," and Doarty shot a sudden look in
  June's direction in time to see the quick intake of her breath in
  consternation and surprise.</p>

  <p>"We got a drag-net out for Eddie now, an' when we get him I guess we'll
  have all three of 'em,'' concluded Mr. Doarty. He was very proud of this
  piece of police work of his.</p>

  <p>"What has Miss Lathrop to do with it?" asked Secor. "She did not slug
  me."</p>

  <p>"She knew the combination to your safe didn't she?" asked Doarty.</p>

  <p>During the conversation June was aware that Miss Welles had drawn away
  from her, casting such a look of horror and disgust in her direction as might
  have withered her completely could looks wither.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pursen, too, stood coldly aloof, while Stickler looked nervously down
  into Michigan Avenue from the window of the room, not once meeting the girl's
  eyes squarely.</p>

  <p>Ogden Secor half raised himself upon his elbow. He looked straight into
  June Lathrop's eyes, and hers met his, as level and unflinching.</p>

  <p>"Miss Lathrop," he said, in a very quiet voice, "are you in any way
  responsible for the rifling of the safe&mdash;tell me the truth."</p>

  <p>The girl's eyes never left his for a moment. Her reply was but a single
  word, delivered without emphasis, in a very ordinary tone.</p>

  <p>"No," she said.</p>

  <p>Secor sank back upon his pillow.</p>

  <p>"That is all," he said, "you may go."</p>

  <p>The doctor had just entered the room.</p>

  <p>"You may all go!" he cried in a petulant voice. "I am surprised, Miss
  Castrol," to the nurse, "that you should have permitted this&mdash;come, get
  out, all of you."</p>

  <p>Doarty came closer to the bed.</p>

  <p>"You wish this woman held, of course?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Has any complaint been lodged against her?" asked Secor.</p>

  <p>"Not yet."</p>

  <p>"There will be none&mdash;you may let her go," said Secor.</p>

  <p>Doarty looked his surprise, and seemed on the point of arguing, when the
  doctor placed a hand on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Quick!" said the physician. "Get out of here, or I cannot be responsible
  for the recovery of this patient."</p>

  <p>June took an impulsive step toward the injured man.</p>

  <p>"How can I thank you for believing in me?" she cried.</p>

  <p>With a weary sigh Ogden Secor turned away from her&mdash;he made no reply.
  The doctor led her to the door.</p>

  <p>"Leave the room," he said.</p>

  <p>Outside were those who had preceded her from the apartment. Mr. Pursen was
  the first to speak. He pointed toward the elevator.</p>

  <p>"Leave the hospital at once," he said.</p>

  <p>Her eyes filled with unshed tears, the girl walked quickly down the hall.
  At the elevator stood Doarty.</p>

  <p>"You'd better beat it, Mag," he said. "This town's too wicked for an
  innocent girl like you," and from his tone she knew that he meant
  it&mdash;that much of it which warned her to leave the city.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">X. &mdash; "RATS DESERT..."</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For a long month Ogden Secor lay at St. Luke's. Surgeons
  pulled their whiskers, glaring owl-like at the patient the while they
  wondered why the deuce nature had not come to their rescue. At last she
  did&mdash;to some measure at least&mdash;and he was bundled off home, weak
  and broken.</p>

  <p>They advised him to seek change and rest in a long ocean voyage; but he
  felt that his business, already long neglected, needed him. Not that he
  longer found the old keen delight in anticipation of strenuous coping with
  the storms and buffetings of the commercial world, but rather that habit
  drove him to it.</p>

  <p>He found conditions in a frightful muddle. No one seemed to know what had
  been transpiring in the office&mdash;Stickler least of all. Secor did not
  deem it necessary to question Sammy&mdash;it had been better for him had he
  done so.</p>

  <p>One of his first inquiries was for Miss Lathrop. Mr. Stickler looked at
  him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Why, I discharged her, Mr. Secor," he said. "You certainly cannot mean
  that you would have cared to continue her in our employ after learning the
  reputation she bore?"</p>

  <p>"'Reputation'?" repeated Secor, "I do not quite grasp you, Mr.
  Stickler."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stickler explained. It soon became evident to him that there was
  something radically wrong with his employer. There was a blank look of utter
  incomprehension upon Ogden Secor's face.</p>

  <p>"It is odd," he said at last, "that I do not recall any of the incidents
  which you relate. You are quite sure, Stickler?"</p>

  <p>"Quite sure, Sir."</p>

  <p>As day succeeded day Ogden Secor realized more and more fully what an
  unusual secretary Miss Lathrop had been. He no longer mentioned her to Mr.
  Stickler, but he missed her very much, just the same. At times he recalled
  with a start the things that Stickler had told him about the girl's past, and
  then he would realize that after all it would have been impossible to have
  retained her. It was too bad, he thought; too bad&mdash;such secretaries as
  she were scarce.</p>

  <p>As to Stickler's assertion that she had connived with the cracksmen,
  furnishing them the combination to the safe, Secor would not believe it.</p>

  <p>Months rolled by. September came again. Long since Mr. Stickler had
  realized that his chief's memory was far from what it had been prior to the
  injuries he had received at the hands of the burglars. Ogden Secor, too, had
  guessed at something of the sort. He seemed to have lost his grasp. His
  usually alert mind was no longer equal to the emergencies that were
  constantly arising in his business.</p>

  <p>Not only did he find it more and more difficult to close contracts, but
  those that he did obtain netted him losses now instead of the profits of the
  past. There was a leak somewhere, but Ogden Secor was not mentally fit to
  discover it.</p>

  <p>Matters went from bad to worse. His losses on the year's work entailed the
  necessity of mortgaging the bulk of his real-estate holdings to complete a
  large public works contract in a neighboring city. Unable longer to
  concentrate his mind upon the work in hand, it ran completely away with him.
  Stickler assumed more and more the direction of it.</p>

  <p>High prices were paid for inferior material, and for large amounts that
  were never delivered. Where the difference went the books of the corporation
  did not show, and if they had it is doubtful if Ogden Secor's waning
  mentality would have been able to understand that he was being persistently
  and systematically betrayed and robbed.</p>

  <p>The final blow came when the engineers of the city for which the work was
  being done refused to accept it on the grounds that scarcely any of the
  material used was up to specifications. Coincidentally Mr. Stickler resigned
  his position with John Secor &amp; Co., to accept the management of a
  stronger competitor.</p>

  <p>An expensive lawsuit followed the refusal of the municipality, for which
  the work had been done, to pay the bill. In the end Secor lost. Bankruptcy
  proceedings followed, and on the first of the following February Ogden Secor
  found himself a ruined man&mdash;almost penniless, and broken as well in
  health and mentality.</p>

  <p>With the exception of a worthless and barren farm in Idaho and a few
  articles of clothing, he had disposed of everything he possessed in an
  endeavor to meet the demands of his creditors. The farm, too, would have gone
  with the rest had he recalled the existence of it.</p>

  <p>During the past few months of mental and nervous stress Secor had seen but
  little of Sophia Welles. He had not felt equal to the rounds of social
  activity which constituted her life, nor had he found her generously
  sympathetic.</p>

  <p>Now that the end had come he sought her, hoping against hope that the
  ubiquitous Mr. Pursen would not be present. To his relief he found Sophia
  Welles alone.</p>

  <p>She did not need the evidence of his tired and haggard face to realize the
  demand that might presently be made upon her sympathy and
  generosity&mdash;she had but just laid aside the noon edition of an afternoon
  paper in which she had perused the last of the rapidly dwindling references
  to a failure that had at first occupied a large part of the front pages of
  many editions. Sophia Welles knew at last that Ogden Secor was a hopelessly
  ruined man.</p>

  <p>There was but one thing to do&mdash;she must forestall him.</p>

  <p>"I am glad that you have come today, Ogden," she said, after a brief
  exchange of greetings. "For almost a year now I have had a great load
  weighing heavily upon my shoulders."&mdash;Miss Welles did not say upon her
  heart&mdash;"and I am only sorry that I did not speak of it long ago, for I
  can only too well realize the motives that may now be unjustly attributed to
  me in pressing the subject at this time of temporary financial trouble in
  which you find yourself.</p>

  <p>"To be quite frank, I discovered long since that my affections were surely
  directing themselves toward another. I should have told you at once, but I
  was not sure at first, and I dreaded causing you useless pain."</p>

  <p>She paused. Secor looked at her through dull eyes. It was evident that he
  was going to take it much harder than she had supposed.</p>

  <p>It is true that not once since his accident had he spoken to her of their
  engagement. There had never been much in the way of sentimental exchanges
  between them, so that the absence of these had aroused little or no surprise
  in the girl's mind. She was glad now that it had been so, for it was going to
  make a difficult job much less difficult than it would otherwise have
  been.</p>

  <p>Yet it was going to be hard enough&mdash;she could see that. She wondered
  why he didn't say something.</p>

  <p>Finally he coughed&mdash;a slight flush mounting his pale face.</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure, Sophia," he said, "that I shall always be most satisfied
  with what brings you the greatest happiness."</p>

  <p>She noted the puzzled expression on his face, attributing it to a natural
  desire to learn who had supplanted him in her affections.</p>

  <p>"I feel," she explained, "that we are not exactly suited to one
  another&mdash;our ideals are not the same. You do not find interest in that
  which interests me most, and so it seems to me that as there may never be any
  deep-rooted common interest between us that we should soon be most unhappy
  together."</p>

  <p>The puzzled expression seemed to have been growing upon the handsome face
  of Mr. Ogden Secor.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he breathed, "I fear that you are quite right."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pursen, on the contrary," went on Miss Welles, "feels precisely as I
  do upon the subjects that are closest to my heart&mdash;they are the same
  that are closest to his. In fact, Ogden, I am going to ask you to release me
  from my engagement to you."</p>

  <p>Involuntarily Ogden Secor's mouth opened but whether in surprise or
  because of a terrible shock to his love and pride it would have been
  difficult to say. Miss Welles attributed it to the latter. At last he found
  words.</p>

  <p>"My dear Sophia," he said, "you know perfectly well that if you love Mr.
  Pursen I shall be the last person on earth to stand in the way of your
  realizing to the full every happiness that may be found at his disposal. I
  congratulate you, Sophia&mdash;sincerely&mdash;and I beg that you will give
  no further thought to me other than as a friend and well-wisher."</p>

  <p>"You are very generous, Ogden," she said, as she bade him good-by, glad
  that the ordeal was so easily over.</p>

  <p>It would have been a much surprised Miss Welles could that young lady have
  read Ogden Secor's thoughts as he ran down the broad steps before her home
  and made his way to the nearest elevated station.</p>

  <p>"And to think," thought he, "that for over a year I have been engaged to
  Sophia Welles without once recalling the fact! Those cracksmen most assuredly
  cracked something belonging to Ogden Secor beside his safe."</p>

  <p>It was with a feeling of relief and elation that he had not felt before
  for months that he strode along the street. Evidently the obligation of his
  engagement had been weighing upon him heavily through the medium of his
  subconsciousness without his having once objectively sensed other than an
  inexplicable call to duty that had drawn him to Sophia Welles when he gladly
  would have been elsewhere.</p>

  <p>As he walked toward the elevated he tried to recall under what
  circumstances he had become engaged to Miss Welles. As he viewed the matter
  now it was difficult to realize that any possible contingency could have
  arisen that would have caused him to look with tender affection upon the cold
  and calculating Sophia.</p>

  <p>The loss of his fortune affected Ogden Secor less than might have been
  expected. Possibly he did not fully realize the completeness of his financial
  ruin, or what it was bound to mean to him. In a way he felt principally a
  certain relief from the galling pressure and annoyances of the past bitter
  year. No longer was he weighted with burdensome responsibilities and grave
  apprehensions&mdash;the worst had happened. There was no further calamity
  possible&mdash;at least so he thought.</p>

  <p>Vaguely he felt that he could again build up a fortune equal to that which
  was gone; but there was none of the old-time assurance and determination that
  had marked him in the past&mdash;it seemed quite impossible for him to
  concentrate his mind for a sufficient length of time upon the subject to
  formulate even the foundation of a well-considered plan.</p>

  <p>He sought out old friends upon whose business acumen he might rely with
  the intention of talking over his plans with them, for at last, and the first
  time in his life, Ogden Secor felt unequal to the task of reasoning for
  himself, much less deciding in any matter of importance.</p>

  <p>The first man to whom he went was the president of a bank of which Secor
  was still a director, and with which he had transacted the bulk of his
  banking business. The president was an old personal friend, a man of about
  Secor's own age, a member of the same clubs and the same set. Heretofore he
  had been wont to drop whatever had been engaging him and come into the
  anteroom to greet Secor whenever he had chanced to call. Today the caller
  waited thirty minutes before the bank president appeared.</p>

  <p>"Well, Secor," he said, "what can I do for you?" Heretofore it had always
  been "Ogden." There was an unquestionable air of haste in his manner, too;
  nor did he take Mr. Secor familiarly by the arm and drag him into his
  luxurious private office as formerly. It was just: "Well, Secor, what can I
  do for you?"</p>

  <p>Those who are congenitally inefficient are prone to sensitiveness, and the
  same is often true of men who, through illness or preposterous circumstance,
  find themselves temporarily unfit to cope with the stern demands of modern
  success building. Supersensitiveness ofttimes begets a preternatural and
  almost uncanny ability to sense the secret motives underlying the acts of
  others.</p>

  <p>Ogden Secor had never been over-sensitive. Until now he had not
  appreciated the fact that there could possibly be any material difference in
  the Ogden Secor of yesterday and the Ogden Secor of today. He had never gaged
  men by their bank accounts, so it is not strange that he should have been
  unsuspecting that any might have gaged him by such a standard.</p>

  <p>The words and manner of the bank president, however, awoke him violently
  and painfully, for Ogden Secor was now, whatever he might have been in the
  past, an inefficient, and, accordingly, a supersensitive.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing that you can do for me, Norton," he said. "I just
  dropped in for a chat. You're busy, though, and I won't detain you." He
  turned to go.</p>

  <p>"I <i>am</i> mighty busy today," replied the bank president, a trifle more
  cordially. "Come in again some time, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks," replied Secor.</p>

  <p>When he reached the street he found himself cold all over&mdash;cold with
  a heart-coldness with which the bleak February northeaster had nothing to do.
  He did not venture to call upon another friend. Instead he dropped into a bar
  on La Salle Street and took a stiff drink of whisky. It was the first time he
  had done that for a longer time than he could recall.</p>

  <p>The drink warmed him, sending an intoxicating, if artificial, renewal of
  hope and confidence surging through him. He took another.</p>

  <p>There was a genial stranger drinking alone at the same bar. He commented
  upon the severity of the storm. Ogden Secor, friends with all the world now,
  entered into conversation with him.</p>

  <p>"Wish I was back in Idaho," remarked the stranger, "where I could get
  thawed out and see that the sun was doing business at the same old
  stand."</p>

  <p>Idaho! It awakened something in Secor's memory.</p>

  <p>"I thought that it was usually pretty cold there," he said.</p>

  <p>"Not where I come from," replied the stranger. "I got a little fruit-ranch
  down in the South-Western corner of the State. Greatest little climate in the
  world, sir; never gets anywheres near zero; and sunshine! Why, man, you ain't
  got a bowin' acquaintance with old Sol back here. Three hundred and sixty
  days of sunshine out of every three hundred and sixty-five."</p>

  <p>Secor smiled. "You remind me of the boosters of sunny southern
  California," he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Don't," said the Idahoan, raising a deprecating hand. "What <i>I'm</i>
  tellin' you is the truth."</p>

  <p>"What part of Idaho did you say you are from?" asked Secor.</p>

  <p>"'Bout ten miles south of Goliath. Goliath's a division headquarters on
  the Short Line."</p>

  <p>"Goliath," repeated Secor. "Why, I've got a ranch around there somewhere
  myself&mdash;took it on a trade years ago and forgot all about it. One
  hundred and sixty acres, I think it was."</p>

  <p>"Sort o' funny for a man to forget a hundred-and-sixty-acre ranch,"
  remarked the stranger a bit skeptically.</p>

  <p>During the following week Ogden Secor drank a great deal more than was
  good for him, or for any man. Several times he met old acquaintances on the
  streets. Ever eager now to discover changes in the attitude of former
  friends, he was quick to note the seeming coldness of their greetings, and
  the remarkable stress of unprecedented business which invariably hurried them
  along.</p>

  <p>After each encounter he sought the nearest bar. His mind was much occupied
  with thoughts of his forgotten ranch, and when a summons to his attorneys'
  offices revealed the fact that the final settlement with his creditors would
  leave him with several hundred dollars of unexpected wealth, he obtained an
  advance from them, purchased a ticket for Goliath, Idaho, and shook the grimy
  snow of the Loop from his feet&mdash;he hoped forever.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">XI. &mdash; A MATTER OF MEMORY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">From La Salle Street to Goliath Idaho, is ordinarily a
  matter of some two days' travel; but it required the best part of a year for
  Ogden Secor to perform the journey.</p>

  <p>On the train he had become acquainted with an alert and plausible stranger
  who owned a gold mine in the mountains north of Ketchum. All that was needed
  for development was a few hundred dollars' worth of machinery and
  flumes&mdash;then it would make its owners fabulously wealthy.</p>

  <p>By the time the train reached Shoshone, Ogden Secor was inoculated with
  the insidious virus of gold-fever&mdash;that mad malady which races white-hot
  through the veins of its victims, distorting every mental image and
  precluding the sane functioning of the powers of reason.</p>

  <p>In possession of all his faculties at their best, Secor could never have
  been trapped so easily; but what with weakened mental and physical
  powers&mdash;the result, primarily, of the work of the cracksmen, and later
  of the effects of alcohol, he fell an easy prey to the highly imaginative
  enthusiasm of his new acquaintance.</p>

  <p>And so it befell that he left the train at Shoshone, and in company with
  the owner of the gold mine, boarded another for Ketchum, the northern
  terminus of the branch line.</p>

  <p>Ketchum is, or at that time was, a squalid wreck of a place; but, like
  every other settlement of its stamp it boasted several saloons. To one of
  these the mine-owner led his victim. Here they discussed ways, means, and
  barbed-wire whisky until Secor passed over the few hundred dollars remaining
  to him that his new partner might go forth and purchase the necessary
  machinery and the outfit that was to transport it and them North into the
  mountains on the morrow.</p>

  <p>Secor, waiting, drank with the proprietor, with the loungers about the
  place, and with others who drifted in scenting whisky at another's
  expense.</p>

  <p>Night came, and still the mine-owner had not returned&mdash;nor did he
  ever.</p>

  <p>Next morning Secor awoke, partially sobered, to a realization of the
  truth. He had been fleeced. He was friendless and all but penniless in a
  strange town; but, worst of all, his nerve was gone.</p>

  <p>The year that followed was a hideous nightmare of regret and shame, the
  sole surcease from which was obtainable only through the stupefying medium of
  drink.</p>

  <p>Often times he was hungry, for there was little chance to earn money in
  Ketchum. Again he did odd jobs about one or the other of the several saloons
  when a flash of his waning self pride or the growing desire for whisky goaded
  him to the earning of money.</p>

  <p>Later he was given work as a clerk in the general store, his knowledge of
  accounting proving of value to the proprietor. This man, realizing that the
  continuous use of whisky would have no tendency to increase the value of his
  new clerk, employed him with the understanding that for six months he was to
  have but a small percentage of his wages weekly&mdash;just enough after the
  store closed Saturday night to permit of a mild orgy from which one might
  recover over Sunday and be fit for work on Monday.</p>

  <p>At the termination of the six months, Secor demanded the balance of his
  accrued wage, and received it. Much to his employer's surprise, he failed to
  spend it immediately for drink. Instead, he did what he had been planning
  upon&mdash;took the first train south for Shoshone and Goliath.</p>

  <p>In his mind was a determination to seek his farm and be thereafter
  independent of any employer. There was, too, the decision to stop drinking;
  but little did the man realize the hold the sickness had taken upon him.</p>

  <p>Secor found Goliath a thriving town of three or four thousand inhabitants.
  His first inquiry, notwithstanding his good resolutions, was for a saloon,
  nor did he have any difficulty in locating several.</p>

  <p>The tiresome journey from Ketchum had given him far too much leisure with
  only his own gloomy thoughts and vain regrets for company.</p>

  <p>A little drink would do no harm&mdash;then he would stop. He would never
  touch it again; but just now his nerves required the stimulant. Then, too,
  was it not a well-known fact that in too sudden a cessation of the habit lay
  grave danger?</p>

  <p>Ah, criminal fallacy! To you how many countless thousand graves owe their
  poor, miserable inmates!</p>

  <p>And so it happened that at dusk it was a far from sober man who entered
  the Palace Lunch Room in time for the evening meal.</p>

  <p>As he sat slouched down upon his stool, his befogged vision struggling
  with the blurred and scrawly purple of the mimeographed bill-of-fare, the
  girl waiting across the counter from him for his order could scarce conceal
  the disgust she felt at his slovenly and unkempt appearance. She could not
  see his face while his head was bent low above the greasy card, but she knew
  that it must be equally as repulsive as his soiled and disheveled
  apparel.</p>

  <p>Who would have guessed that this object of the contempt of a cheap
  lunchcounter waitress in a far Western railroad town could have been the
  spotless Ogden Secor of two brief years ago?</p>

  <p>Presently he looked up into the girl's face. At sight of his features she
  gave a little involuntary gasp, stepping back at the same time as though to
  avoid a blow.</p>

  <p>"'Smatter?" asked Mr. Secor.</p>

  <p>The girl eyed him intently for a moment, and then with a sigh of relief
  forced a smile to her white lips. He had not recognized her.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she said. "I'm taken that way occasionally."</p>

  <p>"Heart?" asked Mr. Secor.</p>

  <p>June Lathrop looked at Mr. Ogden Secor in silence for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she said, half to herself. "I wonder if it is?"</p>

  <p>He gave his order and ate in silence, occasionally casting a furtive
  glance in the girl's direction. When she brought his dessert he asked where
  he might find a comfortable hotel.</p>

  <p>"I only just arrived," he explained, "and am not familiar with the
  town."</p>

  <p>The meal had sobered him a bit, so that he could talk a trifle more
  coherently.</p>

  <p>As he ate his pie June stood in front of him, talking. She told him where
  there was a room in a private family near by that he could probably get. She
  was filled with wonder at the change that had taken place in him. When his
  face was in repose the depth of sorrow that it revealed touched her heart. In
  vain she looked for the one-time radiant smile that had endeared Ogden Secor
  to many beside herself.</p>

  <p>Could it be possible that this was the fastidious society and business man
  she had known but little more than two years since? It was incredible.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to remain here?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I guess so," he replied. "I have a ranch around here somewhere. I've
  never seen it, but I'm going out tomorrow to have a look at it, and if it's
  all right I'll settle here and go to ranching. Much doing in that line?"</p>

  <p>"Alfalfa and fruit ranches pay fairly well," she replied. "It depends, of
  course, on several things&mdash;soil, water rights and&mdash;" she
  hesitated&mdash;"the man who's ranching. Farming nowadays, you know, is
  something of an exact science. To be successful a man must understand that
  haphazard methods won't work."</p>

  <p>"Can't a man learn?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied; "but even then he won't succeed if&mdash;" she hated
  to say it, but oh, how she hated to see him as he was&mdash;"but even then he
  won't succeed if he drinks."</p>

  <p>Ogden Secor flushed. He was still far from having lost all self-respect.
  Without another word he paid his check and walked out of the lunch-room. It
  served him right, he thought, for having entered into familiar conversation
  with a waitress.</p>

  <p>The following morning he engaged a buck-board and a driver for the trip to
  his ranch. A half hour's hunt through the records of the county clerk's
  office sufficed to locate his tract.</p>

  <p>As he was driving through town he told his guide to stop in front of a
  saloon.</p>

  <p>"We may get dry before the day's over," he explained with a grin to the
  more than willing native&mdash;it would never do to stop too suddenly.</p>

  <p>As he stepped up to the bar and ordered a flask the words of the waitress
  came suddenly to his mind: "&mdash;but even then he won't succeed if he
  drinks." They seemed to take the keen edge off his appetite for whisky, but
  he pocketed the bottle and soon was jogging along through the stifling dust
  toward the only thing on earth that he might by any twist of the imagination
  call home.</p>

  <p>As they drove along, Secor tried to picture the rolling meadow lands, the
  shady orchards, the broad, green fields of wheel-high, sweet-scented alfalfa
  of his ranch. Never before had he given this least valued of his possessions
  more than a passing thought, but now that it seemed to offer him a peaceful
  haven of rest and quiet, and utter seclusion from the world that he had known
  and come to hate, he viewed it through a mind's eye that glorified and
  idealized. He could scarce restrain his impatience with the slow, plodding
  team that wallowed now through sand to their fetlocks, and again labored
  upward toward the brow of a rough, lava-strewn bluff.</p>

  <p>At last they came within sight of a broad, willow-fringed river. Low
  islands, dense thicketed, clove the strong, swift current with their sharp
  points. They might have been great, flat ships forging their silent way
  toward the distant mountains of the northland and whence the mighty river
  tumbled roaring downward for its thousand-mile journey to the waters of the
  lesser stream that steals its identity, onward to the sea.</p>

  <p>All was greenish-gray or greenish-brown and all was sere and desolate and
  cold. Here and there little patches of half-melted snow lay in the shadows of
  the sage-brush that dotted the rolling flat beside the river. Beyond, Secor
  could see a similar landscape upon the other shore.</p>

  <p>"It is farther than I thought," he said to his guide.</p>

  <p>"That's mostly the way in Idaho," replied the man.</p>

  <p>Secor was wondering how they were to cross that mighty torrent, for it was
  evident that the ranch must be beyond the river&mdash;there were no signs of
  habitation, no rolling meadow lands, no shady orchards, no green alfalfa
  fields within his ken upon the river's hither side. He realized, of course,
  that the season precluded a full consummation of his dream, but there would
  at least be plenty to suggest the beauties of the Spring and Summer when they
  should come upon his home.</p>

  <p>The guide drew rein upon a little knoll beside the river.</p>

  <p>"Wanna get out?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"What for?" questioned Secor.</p>

  <p>"We're here."</p>

  <p>Secor looked at him searchingly. Already the truth was leering at him with
  a contemptuous grin.</p>

  <p>"Is this it?" he asked, nodding his head in a half swing that took in the
  surrounding desert.</p>

  <p>"Yep," said the guide. "'Tain't much good. You ain't got no water."</p>

  <p>Secor laughed&mdash;a weary, mirthless laugh.</p>

  <p>"Oh," he said, "I think it's a pretty good place."</p>

  <p>"Whafor?" asked the guide in surprise.</p>

  <p>"To take a drink," said Secor, pulling the flask from his
  overcoat-pocket.</p>

  <p>The guide grinned. "An' you don't need no water for that," he said.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Secor, "water'd spoil it."</p>

  <p>For weeks Secor frequented the Q. P. saloon at Goliath, emerging
  occasionally to eat and sleep. Every time he ate he was reminded of the
  waitress at the Palace Lunch Room, but he didn't go there. He wondered, when
  his mind was not entirely befogged by drink, why the girl should cling so
  tenaciously to his memory, and what cause there could be for the
  uncomfortable feeling that accompanied recollection of her warning&mdash;for
  warning it evidently had been.</p>

  <p>One night Secor was sitting in a stud poker game. The gentleman next to
  him developed a crouching manner of inspecting his buried card, placing his
  eye on a level with the table and barely raising the corner of his own card.
  This permitted him to inspect Secor's buried card at the same time. A dozen
  hands were dealt before Secor discovered why he always won small pots and
  lost the large ones. Then he saw that his worthy opponent not only looked at
  Secor's buried card, but immediately thereafter passed obvious signals across
  the table to a crony upon the other side.</p>

  <p>At the following deal Secor did not look at his buried card at all. He
  merely remained in on the strength of what he had in sight. From the corner
  of his eye he saw that the sly one was becoming nervous. Secor had an ace and
  two deuces up&mdash;there was still one card to be dealt.</p>

  <p>At the betting, Secor raised for the first time, then, purposely, he
  turned his head away from his cards and the man at his left to take a drink
  that stood at his right hand. He guessed what would happen. When the drink
  was half way to his lips he turned suddenly to the left to discover the sly
  one in the act of raising his, Secor's, buried card to learn its
  identity.</p>

  <p>Like a flash Secor wheeled, dashing his glass with its contents full in
  the face of the cheater. With the same move he came to his feet. The other
  whipped a revolver from beneath his coat. The balance of the players
  scattered, and the loungers in the saloon ran for the doorway or dived over
  the bar for the security its panels seemed to offer.</p>

  <p>If Secor had been a foot further away from his antagonist he would
  doubtless have been killed. As it was his very proximity saved him. There is
  no easier weapon to parry at close range than a firearm. The slightest
  deviation of aim renders it harmless.</p>

  <p>As the gun flashed beneath the electric light, Secor's left arm went up to
  parry it as if it had been a clenched right fist aimed at his jaw. The bullet
  passed harmlessly past him, and with the report of the exploding cartridge
  his own right landed heavily upon the point of the cheater's chin.</p>

  <p>The man went backward over his chair, his head striking heavily upon a
  massive pottery spittoon. Then he lay perfectly still.</p>

  <p>Ogden Secor stood with wide eyes gazing at the prostrate form of his
  antagonist&mdash;dazed. The bartender poked his head above the sheltering
  breastwork of the bar. Seeing that the shooting appeared to be over he
  emerged. His first act was to remove the gun from the nerveless fingers of
  the supine man. Then he turned toward Secor.</p>

  <p>"Got a gun?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Secor shook his head negatively. A moment later the players and the
  loungers returned to bend over the quiet form upon the floor. With them came
  the sheriff and a doctor. The former, after questioning the bartender, took
  Secor into custody, as several men carried the injured gambler into a back
  room.</p>

  <p>All night Ogden Secor sat sleepless in his bare cell. He was very sober
  now, and the depths to which he had sunk were revealed to him in all their
  appalling horridness. It was unthinkable, and yet it was true&mdash;he, Ogden
  Secor, a participant in a drunken, saloon brawl! tomorrow, or as soon as they
  should release him, he would seek out the man he had struck and apologize to
  him, although he knew that the fellow deserved all that he had got.</p>

  <p>He was sorry now that the bullet intended for him had not found him. It
  would have been better so, and infinitely easier than to go on living the
  worthless, besotted life that he was surely headed for.</p>

  <p>About eight o'clock in the morning the sheriff entered the corridor
  outside his cell.</p>

  <p>"How's Thompson this morning?" asked Secor. Thompson was the name of the
  cheater.</p>

  <p>"I guess he's comfortable," said the officer with a grin. "He ain't sent
  back for nothin'."</p>

  <p>"Has he left town?" asked Secor.</p>

  <p>"Yep," said the sheriff. "He's dead&mdash;you killed him."</p>

  <p>Secor collapsed upon the hard bench at the side of his cell. He felt as
  though some mighty hand had struck him heavily over the heart. There was a
  look in his eyes that the sheriff had never seen in the eyes of another of
  the many killers he had arrested during his long years of service.</p>

  <p>It was neither fear nor horror&mdash;the sheriff could not have
  interpreted it, for he knew not to what heights pride of name, of family, of
  station, birth, and breeding may lift a man above the sordid crimes, nor how
  awful is the plunge from such a pinnacle to the bottomless pit of shame which
  Ogden Secor's naked soul was plumbing that instant.</p>

  <p>"You needn't take it hard," said the sheriff kindly. "You hit him in
  self-defense&mdash;there's half a dozen witnesses to that and to the fact
  that you wasn't armed. It was hittin' the spittoon with the back of his head
  that killed him. There ain't a jury in Idaho that'd find you guilty. You'd
  ought to have a medal, for of all the ornery cusses that ever struck Goliath
  that tin-horn was the most orneriest."</p>

  <p>After the sheriff left him Ogden Secor sat with bowed head, his chin
  resting in his palms. He was surprised that the thought that he had killed a
  fellow man should not weigh more heavily upon him. It was the debauching
  degradation that had led up to the killing that caused him the most
  suffering.</p>

  <p>The words of the waitress at the Palace Lunch Room came back to him once
  more: "&mdash;but even then he won't succeed if he drinks." Well, he wasn't
  succeeding in anything except getting rid of his little store of money.</p>

  <p>What in the world was there for him to succeed at, anyway? he thought. If
  the ranch had been any good he would have pitched in there and worked hard.
  There he could have led a decent life, and earned a respectable
  living&mdash;he had no ambition for anything greater; but the sight of the
  arid sage-brush wilderness which had dispelled his dreams of fertile orchard,
  field, and meadow land, had so discouraged him that, since, he had been able
  to see no brighter ray than that which is reflected from the liquid fire that
  crossed the bar of the Q. P. in sparkling glasses.</p>

  <p>As he sat buried in vain regrets and sorrowful memories, weighed down by
  thoughts of his utter friendlessness and loneliness, he became aware of the
  presence of someone approaching his cell along the short corridor.</p>

  <p>Not sufficiently interested even to look up, he sat with eyes riveted upon
  the cold, gray cement of his prison floor. It was not until the footfalls
  halted before the bars of his cell that he raised his eyes. With a little
  start of surprise he came to his feet. Before him, smiling down into his
  face, stood the waitress of the Palace Lunch Room.</p>

  <p>He looked at her inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"I thought," she said, "that you might be lonesome here&mdash;that there
  might be something I could do for you."</p>

  <p>If June Lathrop had required any reward for the generous impulse that had
  sent her to Secor's side in the time of his adversity she was amply repaid by
  the expression that lighted his face at her words. He almost choked as he
  attempted to reply.</p>

  <p>"And I was just thinking," he said, "how absolutely friendless I am here.
  It is awfully good of you&mdash;I don't know how to thank you; but really you
  ought not to be here. I'm not&mdash;not the sort of person a decent girl
  should know."</p>

  <p>To what awful depths of self-abasement must Ogden Secor have sunk to voice
  such a sentiment as this! June felt the tears coming to her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't say that," she said. "The sheriff told me all about it, and
  that you&mdash;it was in self-defense."</p>

  <p>"It isn't that," said Secor. "It's that I was there at all&mdash;gambling
  in a saloon&mdash;and drunk. Drunk! I should have thought that would have
  killed whatever natural sympathy a woman might feel for a man who had killed
  another, even in self-defense. And," he continued, "do you remember the
  warning that you gave me the first day that I was in Goliath?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "but I didn't think that you would."</p>

  <p>"I have, a hundred times," he said. "And wondered why I should. I've
  wondered, too, what prompted you&mdash;did I seem as bad as that even
  then&mdash;or what was it?"</p>

  <p>She did not dare tell him. He looked at her closely for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Haven't I known you somewhere?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She mustered all her courage. It was less on her own account that she
  dreaded telling him than on his. To be befriended by her might seem the last
  straw&mdash;the final depth below which there was no sinking.</p>

  <p>"My name is Lathrop," she said; "June Lathrop."</p>

  <p>Secor shook his head. "No," he said, "I don't know you, but there is
  something mighty familiar about your face."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">XII. &mdash; JUST THREE WORDS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The coroner's jury exonerated Secor. He was never brought to
  trial. For two weeks he remained in jail waiting the action of the grand
  jury. That body returned a no bill, and Ogden Secor stepped once more into
  the world of freedom.</p>

  <p>During the period of his incarceration June had visited him daily. She
  felt, in a measure, a certain sense of obligation. This man, by a smile and a
  pleasant word, had set her feet back into the path of rectitude at a time
  when hope was gone from her life. She could do no less than exert what small
  influence she might wield to lead him from the path toward which he was
  straying.</p>

  <p>She was glad that he had not remembered her, or at least that he had
  pretended that he did not. She was not sure which was the true explanation of
  his non-recognition. As yet she had not guessed the serious nature of the
  results that had followed his slugging at the hands of the cracksmen.</p>

  <p>Between the noon and evening meals June had a couple of hours to herself,
  and it was at this period that she visited Secor in his cell. He came to look
  forward eagerly to her coming&mdash;except for a few of the Q. P.'s
  hangers-on, she was his only visitor.</p>

  <p>It was June who brought him word of the grand jury's action. The kindly
  sheriff, meeting her at the jail's door, as he himself was bearing the news
  to the prisoner, told her that Secor was a free man, and that she might carry
  the cheering message to him.</p>

  <p>"I reckon he'd rather hear it from them pretty lips, anyway," he added,
  winking knowingly.</p>

  <p>June flushed. It had never occurred to her that any one might find
  foundation for imagining the existence of tender sentiments between herself
  and Ogden Secor in her daily visits to the prisoner. So it was with an
  emotion akin to diffidence that she approached his cell that day.</p>

  <p>Secor received the news of his final exoneration without any show of
  elation. June looked at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it make you happy?" she exclaimed. "Why, I wanted to throw up my
  hat and shout when the sheriff told me."</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "Why should it make me happy?" he asked. "What am I
  coming out to? Who cares whether I am in or out?" And then at the hurt look
  which she could not hide, he exclaimed, regretfully: "Oh, I didn't mean that
  exactly&mdash;I know that you care, and it means everything to me to know
  that there is one good, kind heart in the world; but, Miss Lathrop, your
  generosity would go out the same to a yellow dog&mdash;but not your
  respect.</p>

  <p>"You can't help being kind and sweet, for your soul is pure and
  true&mdash;I can read it in your eyes; but even that can't blind you to the
  bald and brutal fact of what I am&mdash;a drunken bum."</p>

  <p>The bitterness of his tone turned the girl cold.</p>

  <p>"And what am I coming out to?" he went on. "I'm coming out to the
  Q.P.&mdash;that'll be the first place I'll head for. There is no other place
  that I may go, and tonight I'll be drunk again."</p>

  <p>She stretched her hand between the iron bars and laid her slim fingers on
  the man's arm. Her eyes were dim with tears as she raised them to his.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't," she pleaded, "please don't! You mustn't throw your life away.
  Remember who you are&mdash;what you have been&mdash;what you may be again.
  Oh, won't you promise me that you'll never touch it again?"</p>

  <p>The tear-filled eyes, the pleading voice, the touch upon his arm, sent a
  sudden thrill through every fiber of Ogden Secor's being. Never before had he
  realized half the beauties of the girl's face and soul as revealed that
  instant as she pleaded with him for his own honor.</p>

  <p>He forgot that he was Ogden Secor&mdash;that she was a waitress in a cheap
  lunchroom. Slowly his hand crept up until his fingers closed upon hers. He
  leaned forward close to the intervening bars. There was a light in his eyes
  that had never shone upon Sophia Welles.</p>

  <p>"June!" he whispered, his voice now husky with emotion. "I can
  stop&mdash;I can do anything for your sake. June, I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Like a flash the girl snatched her hand from his. Her fingers flew across
  his lips as though to smother the word that he would have spoken&mdash;it
  seemed almost like a blow.</p>

  <p>"<i>No!</i>" she fairly shouted. "Oh, God, you don't know what you are
  saying! Don't say it&mdash;don't think it. It is <i>too awful</i>!" and
  pressing her clenched hands to her face she turned and almost ran from the
  jail.</p>

  <p>For a moment Secor stood as though stunned. He had seen the horror
  mirrored in the girl's eyes&mdash;and he had placed the only interpretation
  upon it that he could.</p>

  <p>"God," he muttered as he sank to his hard bench, "have I sunk so low as
  that?"</p>

  <p>A few minutes later he was released from jail. He did not hesitate. With
  long, eager strides he made straight for the Q. P.</p>

  <p>For a month he scarce drew a sober breath. Then he landed in jail
  again&mdash;this time as a plain "drunk"&mdash;he had been picked up from the
  gutter by a town policeman.</p>

  <p>June heard of it, and came to his cell early the next morning. He met her
  look almost defiantly, but at the pain and sorrow in her face his eyes
  wavered and fell.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think you want to sully your name by coming to see the town
  drunkard," he said; and then, bitterly, "I'd have stopped for your sake even
  without your love. I don't blame you for that; but you needn't have been so
  disgusted with the thought that I loved you."</p>

  <p>"You didn't think <i>that?</i>" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"What else could I think? I read it in your expression."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it wasn't that," she cried. "You must know that I couldn't come to
  see you, or want so to help you, if I felt that way!"</p>

  <p>"Then what is the reason? Why can't I tell you that I love you, June?" he
  insisted. "Tell me."</p>

  <p>"I can't," she said, "and you mustn't ask me to tell you."</p>

  <p>She was close to the bars now, and again she laid her hand upon his.</p>

  <p>"I would do anything on earth for you, Ogden," she said, "except let you
  love me. Why can't you let me help you to win back the biggest thing you have
  lost&mdash;your self-respect? The rest will be easy then, and when you have
  it once more you'll want to get down on your knees and thank June Lathrop
  that she wouldn't let you fall in love with a&mdash;waitress."</p>

  <p>"Would it make you any happier?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It would make me happier than I had ever expected that I could be
  again."</p>

  <p>"I'll try," he said, "for your sake; but how am I to begin&mdash;what is
  there for me to do?"</p>

  <p>"Your ranch," she returned promptly. "You told me that you had a ranch
  down near the river."</p>

  <p>Secor laughed. "I went to see it when I first came out. It's nothing but
  an unfenced sage-bush desert. No water, no fences, no
  house&mdash;nothing."</p>

  <p>"There's the river," she urged.</p>

  <p>"And what can I do with the river?"</p>

  <p>"With a shovel and a pan, you can get a living wage out of the gravel
  anywhere along the river," she answered. "And you can live clean and decent.
  You're making nothing here, and you're living like a hog."</p>

  <p>Ogden Secor flushed. The words stung him, and because they stung, they did
  more to crystalize the good intentions that the girl's pleas had aroused than
  would further pleading, for they awoke with him the fast-dying flame of his
  self-respect.</p>

  <p>"I'll do it, June," he said, "for your sake; but give me something to hope
  for, if I succeed. Tell me that you may then listen to what you won't listen
  to now."</p>

  <p>"When you are back where you should be," she said, "I mean physically,
  morally, and mentally, you won't care to have a waitress hear you tell her
  that you love her."</p>

  <p>"I'm not in love with a waitress, June; I've dared aspire to an
  angel."</p>

  <p>The police magistrate before whom Secor was arraigned had acquired local
  celebrity through the success he had made of keeping Goliath fairly free of
  bums and hoboes. The sheriff and the constabulary worked with him. They
  arrested every undesirable stranger upon the streets, and the judge forthwith
  put them back upon the streets, padlocked to a long chain. There they worked
  out their sentences until, released, they shook the dust of Goliath from
  their feet, nor ever thereafter ventured within her limits.</p>

  <p>To this good judge Mr. Ogden Secor looked like any other drunken bum that
  was hailed before him. There was, it is true, that about the cut of his
  disheveled clothes which proclaimed a one-time smartness; but this rather
  militated against the defendant, for in it the judge saw more sinister signs
  than mere worthlessness&mdash;Eastern crooks, he knew, were ofttimes smartly
  clothed, or the man might have stolen the apparel, which was more likely.</p>

  <p>"Three days in the chain-gang," said the judge. "Call the next case."</p>

  <p>Before those three awful days were over, Ogden Secor was more thoroughly
  sober than ever he had been in all his life&mdash;even in the days that he
  did not drink. He worked with eyes bent upon the ground, never once raising
  them. Through his mind ran four words&mdash;the words of hope and
  encouragement that June Lathrop had spoken: "There's the river." But now it
  was a grim and sinister interpretation that he put upon them.</p>

  <p>"There's the river!" He could scarce wait for the knocking of his galling
  fetters from his ankle. "There's the river!" Yes, and there, too, lay
  forgetfulness of the hideous humiliation of these frightful days.</p>

  <p>June Lathrop saw him in the chain-gang, as the motley crew worked upon the
  streets of Goliath. She turned her head away lest he should see that she had
  seen, and hurrying to her room, threw herself face down upon the bed,
  sobbing. Her tears were for him, for the hideous laceration of his pride that
  she could read in the bent head and the stooping shoulders. He had looked
  like an old man, tottering to his grave beneath a hopeless load of shame.</p>

  <p>God, how it had hurt her! Yet by all the age-old traits that are ascribed
  to humanity she, of all others in the world, should have found sinister
  rejoicing in the suffering of this man. But instead, there came to her for
  the first time a realization of the one thing above all others that might
  make her life even more miserable than it had been&mdash;she loved Ogden
  Secor.</p>

  <p>She knew now that she had always loved him&mdash;since that day that he
  had met her in the antechamber of the grand jury room. She saw now why she
  had set herself the task of reclaiming him. She saw, too, why she had
  experienced such horror at the thought of his voicing words of love to
  her&mdash;it was because she had loved him, and because in all the world of
  men and women, he and she had the least right to love one another.</p>

  <p>When Secor's time in the chain-gang was up, June was waiting for him
  outside the jail.</p>

  <p>Love had given her the power to read in the humiliation of the man she
  loved something of the stern resolve that had found lodgment in his mind.
  Intuitively she sensed what would be the first impulse of a proud man
  weakened by dissipation and bowed down by humiliation.</p>

  <p>She had been a "down-and-outer" herself. She had been on the verge of the
  very thing she had guessed Secor to be contemplating&mdash;it had come after
  that terrible morning at St. Luke's&mdash;but the memory of Ogden Secor's
  kindness to her had stayed her hand.</p>

  <p>Now she would repay him.</p>

  <p>With head still bowed and eyes upon the ground he emerged from the jail.
  When June fell in beside him, he did not look up, though he knew that it was
  she&mdash;who else was there in all the world who would be seen upon the
  public streets with him?</p>

  <p>In silence they walked side by side through the little city, down the
  dusty road toward the cool shadows of the tree-bowered brook that winds along
  that pleasant valley.</p>

  <p>Secor moved but with one thought in his mind&mdash;to get beyond the sight
  of his fellow men. They came at last to the brim of the little stream. There
  were no prying eyes about them.</p>

  <p>June touched his hand gently where it hung at his side, and then her cool
  fingers closed upon his.</p>

  <p>"Ogden," she whispered.</p>

  <p>He turned dull eyes upon her, as though for the first time realizing her
  presence.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" he asked; and then, without waiting for her
  reply, went on: "And you walked at my side through the streets&mdash;through
  the hideous streets where I have worked with a chain upon my ankle, fastened
  to vagabonds and criminals, and to&mdash;to bums&mdash;to other bums like
  myself&mdash;drunken bums! Every one must have seen you. Oh, June, how could
  you have done it?"</p>

  <p>His thoughts now were all for her. There could have been nothing better
  for his sick brain, nauseated with continual thinking of his own shame.</p>

  <p>"I must have been mad to let you do it," he went on. "Your friends will
  jeer at you. They will link your name with that of Ogden Secor, the town
  drunkard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She clapped her hand over his lips.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't say that!" she cried. "I won't let you say it! You are not
  that&mdash;you never could be that. You are making a mountain of a molehill.
  It is not the man who falls who receives the censure of his fellows; it's the
  man who falls and won't get up&mdash;who lies wallowing in the filth of his
  degradation. The world admires the man who can 'come back'&mdash;it hates a
  quitter.</p>

  <p>"You have told me that you love me." She was speaking rapidly, as though
  everything in the world hinged upon the element of time. "You have asked me
  to love you. Do you expect me to love a <i>quitter</i>? You are thinking this
  minute of adding the final ignominy to your downfall; you are thinking this
  minute, Ogden Secor, of taking your own life. If I could love a quitter, do
  you think that I could love a&mdash;<i>coward</i>?"</p>

  <p>Beneath the lash of her words, the man within him awakened. His shoulders
  straightened a bit. He looked her straight in the eyes for the first time
  that day. He was trying to fathom her interest in him. Presently he seemed to
  awaken; a sudden light dawned upon him. Hope lightened the lines of his tired
  and haggard face. Not for months had he looked so much like the Ogden Secor
  of the past.</p>

  <p>He took the girl by the shoulders.</p>

  <p>"June," he cried, "I have been trying to guess why you should have done
  for me all that you have done. There can be but one reason. You cannot deny
  it. Let me hear your lips speak what your acts have proclaimed. Tell me that
  you love me, June, and I can win back to any heights!"</p>

  <p>She pushed him gently from her. Her heart ached to be pressed close in the
  arms of the man she loved; yet she knew that it could never be. If her love
  would save him, she had no right to deny it, though she knew that such an
  avowal could bring nothing but misery and shame to them both; there never
  could be any consummation of a love between Ogden Secor and June Lathrop.</p>

  <p>"I could not deny it now," she said at last, "and if it will help you any
  to hear me say the thing I have no right to say, or that you have no right to
  hear, I can do it for your sake; but beyond the saying of it, Ogden, there
  can be nothing. That we must both understand. Why, I cannot tell you&mdash;I
  dare not. Do not ask me."</p>

  <p>"It will be enough for now," he said, "to hear you say it. Afterward we
  shall find a way; love always does, you know."</p>

  <p>And so she said the thing he wished to hear, nor never in all his life had
  words sounded sweeter to Ogden Secor than those three from the lips of the
  waitress from the Palace Lunch Room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">XIII. &mdash; "FOR THE MURDER OF&mdash;"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For a year Ogden Secor toiled at his lonely camp beside the
  big river.</p>

  <p>His shovel and his pan and his crude rocker were his only companions. With
  the little money that had remained to him after his wasted days in Goliath he
  had purchased material and tools for the construction of a frail shack on his
  land close to his placer diggings, and had furnished it with such bare
  necessities as he could afford.</p>

  <p>Once a week he walked the ten miles that lay between his camp and Goliath
  for a few hours with June Lathrop. These were red-letter days for them
  both&mdash;the sole bright spots in their lonely lives peopled by vain
  regrets.</p>

  <p>At first he had tried to wring from the girl an explanation of her refusal
  to listen to a suggestion of their marriage; but finding that the subject
  caused her only unhappiness, he desisted. The Q. P. knew him no more during
  these days, and the change that was wrought in him by abstinence and
  healthful, outdoor labor was little short of marvelous. He grew to take a
  keen pleasure in his physical fitness, and with renewed health of body came a
  return of his former mental efficiency&mdash;what the surgeons, tinkering
  with his hurt skull, had been unable to accomplish, nature did; slowly, it is
  true, but none the less effectively.</p>

  <p>As his vigor of mind increased, his memory returned in part, so that he
  was constantly haunted by a growing conviction that somewhere, some place far
  from Goliath, he had known June Lathrop, and that she had been intimately
  associated with that other life that was once again taking concrete form in
  his recollections.</p>

  <p>Not that he had ever entirely forgotten his past, for he had not. Rather,
  he recalled it as through a haze which confused and distorted details so that
  he was never quite sure of the true identity of what he saw back there in the
  years that were gone.</p>

  <p>But after all else was plain the figure of the June Lathrop of the past
  still remained little else than an intangible blur. There was something
  needed to recall her more distinctly than his unaided memory could
  do&mdash;nor was that thing to be long wanting.</p>

  <p>The gold that Secor washed from the gravel of the old river bar was barely
  sufficient to meet his daily needs. As a result his ranch&mdash;he always
  laughed as he referred to the bit of sage-brush desert as "my
  ranch"&mdash;was sold for taxes. The time was approaching when, if he would
  regain it, he must act; but having no money, he was forced to remain helpless
  as the time approached.</p>

  <p>One day while he was in Goliath he mentioned the thing to June.</p>

  <p>"Of course the land is not worth the taxes," he said; "but somehow I have
  grown attached to it&mdash;it's the only 'home' I have. I shall hate to see
  it go, but I'll be as well off, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Not worth the taxes?" she exclaimed. "Why, Ogden Secor, where have you
  been for the last six months? Didn't you know that the new government
  reclamation project is at last an assured fact, and that your land will jump
  from nothing an acre to something like a hundred dollars an acre
  overnight?"</p>

  <p>Secor looked at her blankly.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know it came as far down river as my holdings," he said.</p>

  <p>"Why, your land is right in the center of it&mdash;there is every chance
  in the world that the new town will be located there, and if that happens
  you'll be wealthy."</p>

  <p>He smiled ruefully.</p>

  <p>"Not I," he said; "for I couldn't raise the money to redeem the ranch if
  my life depended on it."</p>

  <p>"How much is necessary?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He told her. The next day, Monday, she drew her savings from the bank and
  turned them over to Secor.</p>

  <p>At first, when she had suggested this thing, he had refused flatly, but
  after talking with several men who were well posted, he had seen that there
  was no question but that the land would increase in value immensely and that
  he should be able to repay June in the near future.</p>

  <p>The same day word came of the exact location of the proposed town&mdash;it
  brought definite information to the effect that a large portion of Secor's
  holdings would lie directly in the business center of the town, and the
  balance on the gentle rise back from the river that had been set apart for
  residential purposes.</p>

  <p>June and Ogden were so elated they could scarcely contain themselves.
  Nothing would do but that they must celebrate with a dinner at the Short Line
  Hotel&mdash;the most pretentious hostelry of Goliath. At first June demurred,
  but Ogden was insistent, and so she asked for the afternoon and evening
  off.</p>

  <p>They strolled together beside the little stream where he had wrung from
  her lips an avowal of the love she had no right to harbor for Ogden Secor.
  Once again he revived the subject that had long been taboo, urging her to
  forget whatever to him unfathomable scruples kept her from him; but she only
  shook her head sadly, and when he saw how unhappy it made her he tried to
  drop the subject, though he found it most difficult to drop.</p>

  <p>As they approached the hotel where they were to hold their modest
  celebration, the Limited, a train from the East, lay along the platform, up
  and down which the passengers were strolling. To reach the dining-room it was
  necessary to walk past a part of the long line of Pullmans and as they did so
  Secor was suddenly confronted by a trim little man with outstretched
  hand.</p>

  <p>"My dear Secor," he exclaimed, "what in the world are you doing here? We
  have all wondered what could have become of you."</p>

  <p>And then turning toward the open window of a drawing-room he called, "Oh,
  Sophia, see whom I have discovered!"</p>

  <p>Sophia Welles Pursen looked from the window&mdash;she and the Rev. Mr.
  Pursen were on their bridal trip. She saw Ogden Secor and beside him she saw
  another whom she recognized. Coldly she barely inclined her head, turning
  away from the window immediately.</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Pursen looked at Ogden Secor's companion for the first time. He,
  too, recognized her.</p>

  <p>"My gracious!" he exclaimed. His eyes went wide in holy horror. "My
  gracious! Excuse me, Secor, but the train is about to start." And without a
  backward glance he hastened toward his car.</p>

  <p>The sight of Sophia Welles and the Rev. Mr. Pursen, and the glances of
  contempt they had shot toward June Lathrop, had done in an instant what
  months of vain attempt at recollection had failed to do. With the suddenness
  of an unexpected slap in the face there returned to Ogden Secor the memory of
  the last time he had seen these three together.</p>

  <p>As clearly as if it had been but yesterday he saw the figures about his
  bed as he lay propped up upon his pillows at St. Luke's.</p>

  <p>He saw Sophia Welles and the Rev. Mr. Pursen. He saw Stickler, nervous and
  unstrung, and he saw Doarty, his heavy hand upon the arm of the girl from
  Farris's.</p>

  <p>Slowly a dull red crept across his face. He turned toward June. The look
  of misery in her eyes showed that she realized that memory had returned.</p>

  <p>"Now you understand at last," she said in a dull voice.</p>

  <p>He took her by the arm and led her into the dining-room. She scarce
  realized what she was doing when she permitted herself to go with him. He
  found a table in a corner, seating himself across from her.</p>

  <p>"The cad," he said&mdash;"the dirty, little, hypocritical <i>cad!"</i></p>

  <p>She looked at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;" she started.</p>

  <p>"I mean Pursen."</p>

  <p>"But he was right&mdash;he couldn't recognize me," she replied wearily.
  Then she rose from the table. "I'll go now," she said "I don't know why I
  came in here&mdash;I must have been&mdash;stunned. I knew that you would find
  out some day&mdash;but I didn't know that it would be so dreadfully
  terrible."</p>

  <p>Her lips trembled.</p>

  <p>He reached across the table and forced her gently back into her chair.</p>

  <p>"The only terrible thing about it," he said, "is that there should be such
  people as the Rev. and Mrs. Pursen in the world. That, and the fact that they
  have made you unhappy.''</p>

  <p>"You mean that you don't hate me, now that you remember?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have guessed for a long time, June," he replied, "that there was
  something in your past life that you thought would make our marriage
  impossible if I knew of it. You have misjudged me. I do not care what you
  have been or what you have done. That is past&mdash;it can't be helped now,
  or undone. All I know is that I love you, and now that I know all there is to
  be known, there can be no further reason why you should hesitate longer."</p>

  <p>The old smile lighted his face. "Oh, June," he said, "can't you see that
  it is only our love that counts? If <i>you</i> can forget what <i>I</i> have
  been&mdash;if you can forget the saloon brawls&mdash;if you can forget the
  chain-gang&mdash;what have you done that I may not forget? For you were but a
  young girl, while I was a strong man. Nothing that you may have been can
  exceed in ignominy the depth to which I sunk."</p>

  <p>"You do not remember all, then," she said sadly. "You have forgotten what
  Doarty accused me of&mdash;giving the combination to the man who robbed the
  safe."</p>

  <p>"I remember everything," he replied, "but I do not believe it&mdash;no, I
  do not want you even to deny it, for that would imply that I could believe
  it."</p>

  <p>"I am glad that you don't believe it," she said, "for that, at least, was
  not true! But the rest is true&mdash;about Farris's."</p>

  <p>He could not help wincing at that, for he was still a Puritan at
  heart.</p>

  <p>"Let's not speak of it," he said. "It doesn't change my love for you. I am
  sorry that it had to be so, but it is, and we must make the best of it, just
  as we must make the best of the memory of what I became here in
  Goliath&mdash;the town drunkard. I want you, June, and now there is nothing
  more to keep you from me. Tell me, dear, that there is nothing more."</p>

  <p>She was about to reply when a broad-shouldered man arose from a table
  behind them. As he approached June was the first to see his face. At sight of
  him she turned deathly pale&mdash;it was Doarty. He stepped to her side and
  laid his hand upon her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mag," he said, "I've had a devil of a time finding you; but I've
  got you at last."</p>

  <p>Ogden Secor leaped to his feet.</p>

  <p>"What does this mean?" he cried. "Who are you? What is it, June? What does
  he mean?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Doarty did not recognize Mr. Ogden Secor, whom he had seen but once or
  twice and then under very different circumstances and in widely different
  apparel.</p>

  <p>"It means, bo," said Mr. Doarty, "that your lady friend is under arrest
  for the murder of John Secor four years ago."</p>

     id="ch14">XIV. &mdash; SOME LOOSE THREADS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The case of the People <i>versus</i> June Lathrop, alias
  Maggie Lynch, came to trial in the old Criminal Court Building. Since her
  arrest June had persistently refused to see Ogden Secor, though he had
  repeatedly endeavored to have word with her. She felt that his desire to come
  to her was prompted solely by gratitude for her loyalty to him when their
  positions had been reversed&mdash;when he had been the prisoner.</p>

  <p>How the case had come to be revived no one seemed able to explain. A
  scarehead morning newspaper had used it as an example of the immunity from
  punishment enjoyed by the powers of the underworld&mdash;showing how murder,
  even, might be perpetrated with perfect safety to the murderer. It hinted at
  police indifference&mdash;even at police complicity. No Secor millions longer
  influenced the placing of advertising contracts.</p>

  <p>The police in self-defense explained that they had never ceased to work
  upon the case, and that they were already in possession of sufficient
  evidence to convict&mdash;all they required was a little more time to locate
  the murderer. And then they got busy.</p>

  <p>It happened that Doarty knew more about the almost forgotten details of
  the affair than any other officer on the force, so to Doarty was given the
  herculean task of locating Maggie Lynch. Another officer was entrusted with
  the establishment of a motive for the crime and an investigation of the
  antecedents of Maggie Lynch.</p>

  <p>The results of the efforts of these two sagacious policemen were fully
  apparent as the trial progressed.</p>

  <p>At first it seemed that there would be neither lawyer nor witnesses for
  the defense, but at the eleventh hour both were forthcoming. Ogden Secor had
  seen to that, and there was presented the remarkable spectacle of a young man
  working tooth and nail in the building up of the defense of the woman charged
  with the murder of his uncle.</p>

  <p>All that he knew at first was that she had been an inmate of the house
  where John Secor had dropped dead of heart disease. The State, to establish a
  motive brought a slender, gray-haired woman from a little village fifty miles
  south of the metropolis.</p>

  <p>She was sprung as a surprise upon the defense, and as she was called to
  the witness chair from the antechamber, June Lathrop half rose from her
  chair&mdash;her lips parted and her face dead white.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the little woman ran eagerly over the court-room. When they
  rested at last upon the face of the defendant, tears welled in them, and with
  a faint cry and outstretched arms she took a step toward June.</p>

  <p>"My daughter!" she whispered. "Oh, my daughter!"</p>

  <p>A bailiff laid his hand gently upon her arm and led her to the witness
  chair.</p>

  <p>Her story was a simple one, and simply told. She related the incident of
  the first meeting of "John Smith" and June Lathrop. Smith's automobile had
  stalled in front of the Lathrop homestead, and while the chauffeur tinkered,
  the master had come to the door asking for a drink of water. He had seen
  June, and almost from that instant his infatuation for the girl had been
  evident. Afterward he came often to the little village where the daughter and
  her widowed mother lived.</p>

  <p>Finally he spoke of marriage. June had told her mother of it, and that she
  hesitated because of the great difference in their ages&mdash;she respected
  and admired John Smith, but she did not know that she loved him.</p>

  <p>He brought her beautiful presents, and there were promises of a life of
  luxury and ease&mdash;something the girl had never known, for her father had
  died when she was a baby, and the mother had been able to eke out but a bare
  existence since. It had been the promise of ease and plenty for her mother's
  declining years that had finally influenced June to give a reluctant
  "yes."</p>

  <p>They had been married quietly by a justice of the peace, and had been
  driven directly to town in Smith's machine.</p>

  <p>The former Secor chauffeur established the identity of Smith as John
  Secor. He distinctly recalled their first visit to the Lathrop home, and
  almost weekly trips to the little town thereafter. He positively identified
  the defendant as the girl whom, with John Secor, he had driven from the
  Lathrop home to the city on the day of the wedding, at which he had been a
  witness.</p>

  <p>"Where did you leave the couple after arriving here?" asked the State's
  attorney.</p>

  <p>"At Abe Farris's place on Dearborn," replied the witness.</p>

  <p>When June was called to the stand she corroborated all that had gone
  before. It seemed that a motive had been established.</p>

  <p>"Did you know the nature of the place to which Mr. Smith took you at the
  time?" asked her attorney.</p>

  <p>"I did not. He told me that it was a family hotel, and when, after we had
  been there a few days, I remarked on the strange actions of the other
  guests&mdash;their late hours, ribald songs, and evidences of intoxication,
  he laughed at me, saying that I must get used to the ways of a big city."</p>

  <p>"Did you believe him?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. I had never been away from home in my life. I knew absolutely
  nothing about the existence even of such places as that, or of the forms of
  vice and sin that were openly flaunted there. I was so ignorant of such
  things that I believed him when he told me that the men who came nightly to
  the place were the husbands of the women there. We had a room on the second
  floor, and though I heard much that passed in the house, I saw very little
  out of the way, as we kept closely to our room when we were in the
  place."</p>

  <p>"When did you discover that your 'husband' already had a wife living, and
  that his name was John Secor and not John Smith?"</p>

  <p>"About half an hour after he dropped dead in the hallway," she replied.
  "Abe Farris came to me and told me. He offered me a hundred dollars to keep
  still and pretend that I had never seen or heard of Mr. Secor. I didn't take
  the money. I was heartbroken and sick with horror and terror and shame. I
  wouldn't have told any one of my disgrace under any circumstances. Farris
  kept me there for two days longer, telling me that the police would arrest me
  if I went out. Finally I determined to leave, for at last I knew the whole
  truth of the sort of place I was in.</p>

  <p>"Then Farris urged me to stay there and go to work for him. When I
  refused, he explained that I was already ruined, and even laughed when I told
  him that I did not know that I was not legally married to Mr. Smith. 'You
  don't think for a minute that any one'll swallow that yarn, do you?' he
  asked. 'If you want to keep out of jail you'd better stay right
  here&mdash;you can't never be no worse off than you are now.'</p>

  <p>"I began to feel that he was right, yet I insisted on leaving, and then he
  had my clothes taken from me, saying that I owed him money for board that Mr.
  Secor had not paid, and that he would not let me go until I paid him.</p>

  <p>"I think that I must have been almost mad from grief and terror. I know
  that at last I grew not to care what became of me, and when Farris made me
  think that I could escape arrest only by remaining with him, I gave up, for
  the thought that my mother would learn the awful truth were I to be brought
  to trial was more than I could bear."</p>

  <p>Farris testified that he had been the first to tell the girl that the man
  she thought her husband was the husband of another woman.</p>

  <p>"When did you tell her this?" asked the attorney for the defense.</p>

  <p>"Half or three-quarters of an hour after Mr. Secor died."</p>

  <p>Afterward two reputable physicians testified that they had performed a
  post-mortem examination upon John Secor's body&mdash;that there had been no
  evidence of poison in his stomach, or bruises, abrasions, or wounds upon his
  body, and that there could be no doubt but that death had been the result of
  an attack of acute endocarditis.</p>

  <p>The jury was out but fifteen minutes, returning a verdict of not guilty on
  the first ballot. To June Lathrop it meant nothing. It was what she had
  expected; but though it freed her from an unjust charge, it could never right
  the hideous wrong that had been done her, first by an individual in
  conceiving and perpetrating the wrong, and then by the community, as
  represented by the police, in dragging the whole hideous fabric of her shame
  before the world.</p>

  <p>As is customary upon the acquittal of a defendant in a criminal case, a
  horde of the morbidly curious thronged about June to offer their
  congratulations. She turned from them wearily, seeking her mother; but there
  was one who would not be denied&mdash;a tall, freckled youth who wormed his
  way to her side with uncanny stealthiness. It was Sammy, the one-time
  office-boy of the corporation known as John Secor &amp; Co.</p>

  <p>"Miss Lathrop," he whispered. "Miss Lathrop, I've been trying to find you
  for years. I'm a regular detective now; but the best job I ever did I did for
  you and nobody never knew anything about it. Don't you remember me?"</p>

  <p>She shook hands with him, and he followed her from the court-room. There
  was another who followed her, too. A sun-tanned young man whose haggard
  features bore clear witness to the mental suffering he had endured.</p>

  <p>Outside the building he touched her sleeve. She turned toward him.</p>

  <p>"Do you loathe me," he whispered, "for what <i>he</i> did?"</p>

  <p>"You know better than that," she answered; "but now you see why it was
  that I could not marry you. Now you will thank me for not being weak and
  giving in&mdash;God knows how sorely I was tempted!"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing now to prevent," he said eagerly.</p>

  <p>She looked at him in surprise. "You still want me?" she cried. "You can't
  mean it&mdash;it would be horrible!"</p>

  <p>"I shall always want you, June," he said doggedly, "and some day I shall
  have you."</p>

  <p>But still she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It would be wicked, Ogden," she said with a little shudder. "If he had
  been any one else&mdash;any one else in the world than your father!"</p>

  <p>Secor looked at her in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"My father!" he exclaimed. "Do you mean that you do not know&mdash;that
  John Secor was <i>not</i> my father?"</p>

  <p>The girl's astonishment and incredulity were writ plain upon her face.</p>

  <p>"Not your father?" It was scarce a whisper.</p>

  <p>"I was the foster son of John Secor's brother. When he died I went to live
  with the John Secors, and after the death of their only son I entered Mr.
  Secor's office, taking the place of the son he had lost, later inheriting his
  business."</p>

  <p>June continued to look in dull bewilderment at Secor. It could not be
  true! She cast about for another obstacle. Certainly she had no right to such
  happiness as she saw being surely pressed upon her.</p>

  <p>"There is still the charge against me of having aided the men who robbed
  your safe&mdash;that is even worse, for it reproaches me with disloyalty and
  treachery toward one who had befriended me," she said faintly.</p>

  <p>Sammy and June's mother had been standing a little apart as the two spoke
  together in whispers. June had slightly raised her voice as she recalled the
  affair in the office of John Secor &amp; Co. the night that Ogden had
  received the blows that had resulted in all his financial troubles.</p>

  <p>That part Sammy heard. Now he stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"That's what I wanted to tell you about, Miss Lathrop," he said,
  excitedly. "It wasn't her at all," he went on, turning toward Secor. "It was
  that smooth scoundrel of a Stickler. I was hiding under his filing cabinet
  when he tried to make Miss Lathrop go out with him, and I heard her turn him
  down. Then I followed him, for I was just studying to be a detective then and
  I had to practise every chance I got. He went straight to Abe Farris's
  saloon, and there I saw him talking low and confidential-like to a couple of
  tough-lookin' guys for about two hours. He handed one of 'em a slip of paper,
  explaining what was on it. I couldn't see it, but from what happened after I
  knew it held the combination to your safe, for I seen the robber that was
  shot when he was put on trial, and he was one of the guys that Stickler met
  in Farris's. I was so scared I didn't dare tell nobody."</p>

  <p>Ogden turned toward June with a faint smile. "You see," he said, "that one
  by one your defenses are reduced&mdash;aren't you about ready to
  capitulate?"</p>

  <p>"I guess there is no other way," she sighed; "but it seems that the world
  must be all awry when hope of happiness appears so close within my
  grasp!"</p>
