  <h3>A TRUE TALE OF THE REPUBLIC</h3>

  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="note">This is one of the most powerful Roman stories in the
  English language, and is of itself sufficient to stamp the writer as a
  powerful man. The dark intrigues of the days which Caesar, Sallust and Cicero
  made illustrious; when Cataline defied and almost defeated the Senate; when
  the plots which ultimately overthrew the Roman Republic were being formed,
  are described in a masterly manner. The book deserves a permanent position by
  the side of the great <i>Bellum Catalinarium</i> of Sallust, and if we
  mistake not will not fail to occupy a prominent place among those produced in
  America.</p>

  <h2><a id="pre"
     name="pre"></a>PREFACE</h2>

  <p class="first">A FEW words are perhaps needed as an introduction to a work
  of far more ambitious character, than any which I have before attempted. In
  venturing to select a subject from the history of Rome, during its earlier
  ages, undeterred by the failure or, at the best, partial success of writers
  far more eminent than I can ever hope to become, I have been actuated by
  reasons, which, in order to relieve myself from the possible charge of
  presumption, I will state briefly.</p>

  <p>It has long been my opinion, then, that there lay a vast field, rich with
  a harvest of material almost virgin, for the romancer's use, in the history
  of classic ages. And this at a period when the annals of every century and
  nation since the Christian era have been ransacked, and reproduced, in
  endless variety, for the entertainment of the hourly increasing reading
  world, is no small advantage.</p>

  <p>Again, I have fancied that I could discover a cause for the imperfect
  success of great writers when dealing with classic fiction, in the fact of
  their endeavoring to be too learned, of their aiming too much at portraying
  Greeks and Romans, and too little at depicting men, forgetful that under all
  changes of custom, and costume, in all countries, ages, and conditions, the
  human heart is still the human heart, convulsed by the same passions, chilled
  by the same griefs, burning with the same joys, and, in the main, actuated by
  the same hopes and fears.</p>

  <p>With these views, I many years ago deliberately selected this subject, for
  a novel, which has advanced by slow steps to such a degree of completeness as
  it has now attained.</p>

  <p>Having determined on trying my success in classical fiction, the
  conspiracy of Cataline appeared to me, a theme particularly well adapted for
  the purpose, as being an actual event of vast importance, and in many
  respects unparalleled in history; as being partially familiar to every one,
  thoroughly understood perhaps by no one, so slender are the authentic
  documents concerning it which have come down to us, and so dark and
  mysterious the motives of the actors.</p>

  <p>It possessed, therefore, among other qualifications, as the ground-work of
  a historical Romance, one almost indispensable&mdash;that of indistinctness,
  which gives scope to the exercise of imagination, without the necessity of
  falsifying either the truths or the probabilities of history.</p>

  <p>Of the execution, I have, of course, nothing to say; but that I have
  sedulously avoided being overlearned; that few Latin words will be found in
  the work&mdash;none whatsoever in the conversational parts, and none but the
  names of articles which have no direct English appellation; and that it is
  sufficiently simple and direct for the most unclassical reader.</p>

  <p>I hope that the costume, the manners of the people, and the antiquarian
  details will be found sufficiently correct; if they be not, it is not for
  want of pains or care; for I have diligently consulted all the authorities to
  which I could command access.</p>

  <p>To the history of the strange events related in this tale, I have adhered
  most scrupulously; and I believe that the dates, facts, and characters of the
  individuals introduced, will not be found in any material respect, erroneous
  or untrue; and here I may perhaps venture to observe, that, on reading the
  most recently published lectures of Niebuhr, which never fell in my way until
  very lately, I had the great satisfaction of finding the view I have always
  taken of the character and motives of Cataline and his confederates,
  confirmed by the opinion of that profound and sagacious critic and
  historian.</p>

  <p>I will only add, that it is hardly probable that "the Roman Traitor" would
  ever have been finished had it not been for the strenuous advice of a friend,
  in whose opinion I have the utmost confidence, Mr. Benjamin, to whom some of
  the early chapters were casually shown, two or three years ago, and who
  almost insisted on my completing it.</p>

  <p>It is most fitting, therefore, that it should be, as it is, introduced to
  the world under his auspices; since but for his favourable judgment, and for
  a feeling on my own part that to fail in such an attempt would be scarce a
  failure, while success would be success indeed, it would probably have never
  seen the light of day!</p>

  <p>With these few remarks, I submit the Roman Traitor to the candid judgment
  of my friends and the public, somewhat emboldened by the uniform kindness and
  encouragement which I have hitherto met; and with some hope that I may be
  allowed at some future day, to lay another romance of the most famous, before
  the citizens of the youngest republic.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch101"

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>But bring me to the knowledge of your
     chiefs.</i> &mdash; Marino Faliero.</p><br>

  <p class="first">MIDNIGHT was over Rome. The skies were dark and lowering,
  and ominous of tempest; for it was a sirocco, and the welkin was overcast
  with sheets of vapory cloud, not very dense, indeed, or solid, but still
  sufficient to intercept the feeble twinkling of the stars, which alone held
  dominion in the firmament; since the young crescent of the moon had sunk long
  ago beneath the veiled horizon.</p>

  <p>The air was thick and sultry, and so unspeakably oppressive, that for
  above three hours the streets had been entirely deserted. In a few houses of
  the higher class, lights might be seen dimly shining through the casements of
  the small chambers, hard beside the doorway, appropriated to the use of the
  Atriensis, or slave whose charge it was to guard the entrance of the court.
  But, for the most part, not a single ray cheered the dull murky streets,
  except that here and there, before the holy shrine, or vaster and more
  elaborate temple, of some one of Rome's hundred gods, the votive lanthorns,
  though shorn of half their beams by the dense fog-wreaths, burnt
  perennial.</p>

  <p>The period was the latter time of the republic, a few years after the fell
  democratic persecutions of the plebeian Marius had drowned the mighty city
  oceans-deep in patrician gore; after the awful retribution of the avenger
  Sylla had rioted in the destruction of that guilty faction.</p>

  <p>He who was destined one day to support the laurelled diadem of universal
  empire on his bald brows, stood even now among the noblest, the most
  ambitious, and the most famous of the state; though not as yet had he
  unfurled the eagle wings of conquest over the fierce barbarian hordes of Gaul
  and Germany, or launched his galleys on the untried waters of the great
  Western sea. A dissipated, spendthrift, and luxurious youth, devoted solely
  as it would seem to the pleasures of the table, or to intrigues with the most
  fair and noble of Rome's ladies, he had yet, amid those unworthy occupations,
  displayed such gleams of overmastering talent, such wondrous energy, such
  deep sagacity, and above all such uncurbed though ill-directed ambition, that
  the perpetual Dictator had already, years before, exclaimed with prescient
  wisdom,&mdash;"In yon unzoned youth I perceive the germ of many a
  Marius."</p>

  <p>At the same time, the magnificent and princely leader, who was to be
  thereafter his great rival, was reaping that rich crop of glory, the seeds of
  which had been sown already by the wronged Lucullus, in the broad kingdoms of
  the effeminate East.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as Rome had gradually rendered herself, by the exertion of
  indomitable valor, the supreme mistress of every foreign power that bordered
  on the Mediterranean, wealth, avarice, and luxury, like some contagious
  pestilence, had crept into the inmost vitals of the commonwealth, until the
  very features, which had once made her famous, no less for her virtues than
  her valor, were utterly obliterated and for ever.</p>

  <p>Instead of a paternal, poor, brave, patriotic aristocracy, she had now a
  nobility, valiant indeed and capable, but dissolute beyond the reach of man's
  imagination, boundless in their expenditures, reckless as to the mode of
  gaining wherewithal to support them, oppressive and despotical to their
  inferiors, smooth-tongued and hypocritical toward each other, destitute
  equally of justice and compassion toward men, and of respect and piety toward
  the Gods! Wealth had become the idol, the god of the whole people!
  Wealth&mdash;and no longer service, eloquence, daring, or
  integrity,&mdash;was held the requisite for office. Wealth now conferred upon
  its owner, all magistracies all guerdons&mdash;rank, power,
  command,&mdash;consulships, provinces, and armies.</p>

  <p>The senate&mdash;once the most grave and stern and just assembly that the
  world had seen&mdash;was now, with but a few superb exceptions, a timid,
  faithless, and licentious oligarchy; while&mdash;name whilome so majestical
  and mighty!&mdash;the people, the great Roman people, was but a mob! a vile
  colluvion of the offscourings of all climes and regions&mdash;Greeks,
  Syrians, Africans, Barbarians from the chilly north, and eunuchs from the
  vanquished Orient, enfranchised slaves, and liberated gladiators&mdash;a
  factious, turbulent, fierce rabble!</p>

  <p>Such was the state of Rome, when it would seem that the Gods, wearied with
  the guilt of her aggrandisement, sick of the slaughter by which she had won
  her way to empire almost universal, had judged her to destruction&mdash;had
  given her up to perish, not by the hands of any foreign foe, but by her own;
  not by the wisdom, conduct, bravery of others, but by her own insanity and
  crime.</p>

  <p>But at this darkest season of the state one hope was left to
  Rome&mdash;one safeguard. The united worth of Cicero and Cato! The
  statesmanship, the eloquence, the splendid and unequalled parts of the
  former; the stern self-denying virtue, the unchanged constancy, the resolute
  and hard integrity of the latter; these, singular and severally, might have
  availed to prop a falling dynasty&mdash;united, might have preserved a
  world!</p>

  <p>The night was such as has already been described: gloomy and lowering in
  its character, as was the aspect of the political horizon, and most congenial
  to the fearful plots, which were even now in progress against the lives of
  Rome's best citizens, against the sanctity of her most solemn temples, the
  safety of her domestic hearths, the majesty of her inviolable laws, the very
  existence of her institutions, of her empire, of herself as one among the
  nations of the earth.</p>

  <p>Most suitable, indeed, was that dim murky night, most favorable the
  solitude of the deserted streets, to the measures of those parricides of the
  Republic, who lurked within her bosom, thirsty for blood, and panting to
  destroy. Nor had they overlooked the opportunity. But a few days remained
  before that on which the Consular elections, fixed for the eighteenth of
  October, were to take place in the Campus Martius&mdash;whereat, it was
  already understood that Sergius Cataline, frustrated the preceding year, by
  the election of the great orator of Arpinum to his discomfiture, was about
  once more to try the fortunes of himself and of the popular faction.</p>

  <p>It was at this untimely hour, that a man might have been seen lurking
  beneath the shadows of an antique archway, decorated with half-obliterated
  sculptures of the old Etruscan school, in one of the narrow and winding
  streets which, lying parallel to the Suburra, ran up the hollow between the
  Viminal and Quirinal hills.</p>

  <p>He was a tall and well-framed figure, though so lean as to seem almost
  emaciated. His forehead was unusually high and narrow, and channelled with
  deep horizontal lines of thought and passion, across which cut at right
  angles the sharp furrows of a continual scowl, drawing the corners of his
  heavy coal-black eyebrows into strange contiguity. Beneath these, situated
  far back in their cavernous recesses, a pair of keen restless eyes glared out
  with an expression fearful to behold&mdash;a jealous, and unquiet, ever-
  wandering glance&mdash;so sinister, and ominous, and above all so indicative
  of a perturbed and anguished spirit, that it could not be looked upon without
  suggesting those wild tales, which speak of fiends dwelling in the revivified
  and untombed carcasses of those who die in unrepented sin. His nose was
  keenly Roman; with a deep wrinkle seared, as it would seem, into the sallow
  flesh from either nostril downward. His mouth, grimly compressed, and his
  jaws, for the most part, firmly clinched together, spoke volumes of immutable
  and iron resolution; while all his under lip was scarred, in many places,
  with the trace of wounds, inflicted beyond doubt, in some dread paroxysm, by
  the very teeth it covered.</p>

  <p>The dress which this remarkable looking individual at that time wore, was
  the <i>penula</i>, as it was called; a short, loose straight-cut overcoat,
  reaching a little way below the knees, not fitted to the shape, but looped by
  woollen frogs all down the front, with broad flaps to protect the arms, and a
  square cape or collar, which at the pleasure of the wearer could be drawn up
  so as to conceal all the lower part of the countenance, or suffered to fall
  down upon the shoulders.</p>

  <p>This uncouth vestment, which was used only by men of the lowest order, or
  by others solely when engaged in long and toilsome journeys, or in cold
  wintry weather, was composed of a thick loose-napped frieze or serge, of a
  dark purplish brown, with loops and <i>fibulae</i>, or frogs, of a dull dingy
  red.</p>

  <p>The wearer's legs were bare down to the very feet, which were protected by
  coarse shoes of heavy leather, fastened about the ancles by a thong, with a
  clasp of marvellously ill-cleaned brass. Upon his head he had a
  <i>petasus</i>, or broad-brimmed hat of gray felt, fitting close to the
  skull, with a long fall behind, not very unlike in form to the south-wester
  of a modern seaman. This article of dress was, like the penula, although
  peculiar to the inferior classes, oftentimes worn by men of superior rank,
  when journeying abroad. From these, therefore, little or no aid was given to
  conjecture, as to the station of the person, who now shrunk back into the
  deepest gloom of the old archway, now peered out stealthily into the night,
  grinding his teeth and muttering smothered imprecations against some one, who
  had failed to meet him.</p>

  <p>The shoes, however, of rude, ill-tanned leather, of a form and manufacture
  which was peculiar to the lowest artizans or even slaves, were such as no man
  of ordinary standing would under any circumstances have adopted. Yet if these
  would have implied that the wearer was of low plebeian origin, this surmise
  was contradicted by several rings decked with gems of great price and
  splendor&mdash;one a large deeply-engraved signet&mdash;which were distinctly
  visible by their lustre on the fingers of both his hands.</p>

  <p>His air and carriage too were evidently in accordance with the nobility of
  birth implied by these magnificent adornments, rather than with the humble
  station betokened by the rest of his attire.</p>

  <p>His motions were quick, irritable, and incessant! His pace, as he stalked
  to and fro in the narrow area of the archway, was agitated, and uneven. Now
  he would stride off ten or twelve steps with strange velocity, then pause,
  and stand quite motionless for perhaps a minute's space, and then again
  resume his walk with slow and faltering gestures, to burst forth once again,
  as at the instigation of some goading spirit, to the same short-lived energy
  and speed.</p>

  <p>Meantime, his color went and came; he bit his lip, till the blood trickled
  down his clean shorn chin; he clinched his hands, and smote them heavily
  together, and uttered in a harsh hissing whisper the most appalling
  imprecations&mdash;on his own head&mdash;on him who had deceived him&mdash;on
  Rome, and all her myriads of inhabitants&mdash;on earth, and sea, and
  heaven&mdash;on everything divine or human!</p>

  <p>"The black plague 'light on the fat sleepy glutton!&mdash;nay, rather all
  the fiends and furies of deep Erebus pursue <i>me</i>!&mdash;me!&mdash;me,
  who was fool enough to fancy that aught of bold design or manly daring could
  rouse up the dull, adipose, luxurious loiterer from his wines&mdash;his
  concubines&mdash;his slumbers!&mdash;And now&mdash;the dire ones hunt him to
  perdition! Now, the seventh hour of night hath passed, and all await us at
  the house of Laeca; and this foul sluggard sottishly snores at home!"</p>

  <p>While he was cursing yet, and smiting his broad chest, and gnashing his
  teeth in impotent malignity, suddenly a quick step became audible at a
  distance. The sound fell on his ear sharpened by the stimulus of fiery
  passions and of conscious fear, long ere it could have been perceived by any
  ordinary listener.</p>

  <p>"'Tis he," he said, "'tis he at last&mdash;but no?" he continued, after a
  pause of a second, during which he had stooped, and laid his ear close to the
  ground, "no! 'tis too quick and light for the gross Cassius. By all the gods!
  there are two! Can he, then, have betrayed me? No! no! By heavens! he dare
  not!"</p>

  <p>At the same time he started back into the darkest corner of the arch,
  pulled up the cape of his cassock, and slouched the wide-brimmed hat over his
  anxious lineaments; then pressing his body flat against the dusky wall, to
  which the color of his garments was in some sort assimilated, he awaited the
  arrival of the new-comers, perhaps hoping that if foreign to his purpose they
  might pass by him in the gloom.</p>

  <p>As the footsteps now sounded nearer, he thrust his right hand into the
  bosom of his cassock, and drew out a long broad two-edged dagger, or
  stiletto; and as he unsheathed it, "Ready!" he muttered to himself, "ready
  for either fortune!"</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer came the footsteps, and the blent sounds of the two were
  now distinctly audible&mdash;one a slow, listless tread, as of one loitering
  along, as if irresolute whether to turn back or proceed; the other a firm,
  rapid, and decided step.</p>

  <p>"Ha! it is well!" resumed the listener; "Cassius it is; and with him comes
  Cethegus, though where they have joined company I marvel."</p>

  <p>And, as he spoke, he put his weapon back into his girdle, where it was
  perfectly concealed by the folds of the penula.</p>

  <p>"Ho!&mdash;stand!" he whispered, as the two men whose steps he had heard,
  entered the archway, "Stand, Friends and Brethren."</p>

  <p>"Hail, Sergius!" replied the foremost; a tall and splendidly formed man,
  with a dark quick eye, and regular features, nobly chiselled and in all
  respects such&mdash;had it not been for the bitter and ferocious sneer, which
  curled his haughty lip, at every word&mdash;as might be termed eminently
  handsome.</p>

  <p>He wore his raven hair in long and flowing curls, which hung quite down
  upon his shoulders&mdash;a fashion that was held in Rome to the last degree
  effeminate, indeed almost infamous&mdash;while his trim whiskers and close
  curly beard reeked with the richest perfumes, impregnating the atmosphere
  through which he passed with odors so strong as to be almost
  overpowering.</p>

  <p>His garb was that of a patrician of the highest order; though tinctured,
  like the arrangement of his hair, with not a little of that soft luxurious
  taste which had, of latter years, begun so generally to pervade Rome's young
  nobility. His under dress or tunic, was not of that succinct and narrow cut,
  which had so well become the sturdy fathers of the new republic!
  but&mdash;beside being wrought of the finest Spanish wool of snowy whiteness,
  with the broad crimson facings indicative of his senatorial rank, known as
  the laticlave&mdash;fell in loose folds half way between his knee and
  ancle.</p>

  <p>It had sleeves, too, a thing esteemed unworthy of a man&mdash;and was
  fringed at the cuffs, and round the hem, with a deep passmenting of crimson
  to match the laticlave. His toga of the thinnest and most gauzy texture, and
  whiter even than his tunic, flowed in a series of classical and studied
  draperies quite to his heels, where like the tunic it was bordered by a broad
  crimson trimming. His feet were ornamented, rather than protected, by
  delicate buskins of black leather, decked with the silver <i>sigma</i>, in
  its old crescent shape, the proud initial of the high term senator. A golden
  bracelet, fashioned like a large serpent, exquisitely carved with horrent
  scales and forked tail, was twined about the wrist of his right arm, with a
  huge carbuncle set in the head, and two rare diamonds for eyes. A dozen rings
  gemmed with the clearest brilliants sparkled upon his white and tapering
  fingers; in which, to complete the picture, he bore a handkerchief of fine
  Egyptian cambric, or Byssus as the Romans styled it, embroidered at the edges
  in arabesques of golden thread.</p>

  <p>His comrade was if possible more slovenly in his attire than his friend
  was luxurious and expensive. He wore no toga, and his tunic&mdash;which,
  without the upper robe, was the accustomed dress of gladiators, slaves, and
  such as were too poor to wear the full and characteristic attire of the Roman
  citizen&mdash;was of dark brownish woollen, threadbare, and soiled with spots
  of grease, and patched in many places. His shoes were of coarse clouted
  leather, and his legs were covered up to the knees by thongs of ill-tanned
  cowhide rolled round them and tied at the ancles with straps of the same
  material.</p>

  <p>"A plague on both of you!" replied the person, who had been so long
  awaiting them, in answer to their salutation. "Two hours have ye detained me
  here; and now that ye have come, in pretty guise ye do come! Oh! by the gods!
  a well assorted pair. Cassius more filthy than the vilest and most base
  tatterdemalion of the stews, and with him rare Cethegus, a senator in all his
  bravery! Wise judgment! excellent disguises! I know not whether most to
  marvel at the insane and furious temerity of this one, or at the idiotic
  foolery of that! Well fitted are ye both for a great purpose. And
  now&mdash;may the dark furies hunt you to perdition!&mdash;what hath delayed
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Why, what a coil is here", replied the gay Cethegus, delighted evidently
  at the unsuppressed anger of his confederate in crime, and bent on goading to
  yet more fiery wrath his most ungovernable temper. "Methinks, O pleasant
  Sergius, the moisture of this delectable night should have quenched somewhat
  the quick flames of your most amiable and placid humor! Keep thy hard words,
  I prithee, Cataline, for those who either heed or dread them. I, thou well
  knowest, do neither."</p>

  <p>"Peace, peace! Cethegus; plague him no farther," interrupted Cassius, just
  as the fierce conspirator, exclaiming in a deep harsh whisper, the one word
  "Boy!" strode forth as if to strike him. "And thou, good Cataline, listen to
  reason&mdash;we have been dogged hitherward, and so came by circuitous
  byeways!"</p>

  <p>"Dogged, said ye&mdash;dogged? and by whom?&mdash;doth the slave live, who
  dared it?"</p>

  <p>"By a slave, as we reckon," answered Cassius, "for he wore no toga; and
  his tunic"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Was filthy&mdash;very filthy, by the gods!&mdash;most like thine own,
  good Cassius," interposed Cethegus. "But, in good sooth, he <i>was</i> a
  slave, my Sergius. He passed us twice, before I thought much of it. Once as
  we crossed the sacred way after descending from the Palatine&mdash;and once
  again beside the shrine of Venus in the Cyprian street. The second time he
  gazed into my very eyes, until he caught my glance meeting his own, and then
  with a quick bounding pace he hurried onward."</p>

  <p>"Tush!" answered Cataline, "tush! was that all? the knave was a chance
  night-walker, and frightened ye! Ha! ha! by Hercules! it makes me
  laugh&mdash;frightened the rash and overbold Cethegus!"</p>

  <p>"It was not all!" replied Cethegus very calmly, "it was not all, Cataline.
  And, but that we are joined here in a purpose so mighty that it overwhelms
  all private interests, all mere considerations of the individual, you, my
  good sir, should learn what it is to taunt a man with fear, who fears not
  anything&mdash;least of all thee! But it was not all. For as we turned from a
  side lane into the Wicked(1) street that scales the summit of the Esquiline,
  my eye caught something lurking in the dark shadow cast over an angle of the
  wall by a large cypress. I seized the arm of Cassius, to check his
  speech"&mdash;</p>

  <p class="footnote"><i>1. Vicus sceleratus.</i> So called because Tullia
  therein drove her chariot over her father's corpse.</p>

  <p>"Ha! did the fat idiot speak?&mdash;what said he?" interrupted
  Cataline.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," replied the other, "nothing, at least, of any moment. Well, I
  caught Cassius by the arm, and was in the act of pointing, when from the
  shadows of the tree out sprang this self-same varlet, whereon
  I&mdash;&mdash;".</p>

  <p>"Rushed on him! dragged him into the light! and smote him, thus, and thus,
  and thus! didst thou not, excellent Cethegus?" Cataline exclaimed fiercely in
  a hard stern whisper, making three lounges, while he spoke, as if with a
  stiletto.</p>

  <p>"I did not any of these things," answered the other.</p>

  <p>"And why not, I say, why not? why not?" cried Cataline with rude
  impetuosity.</p>

  <p>"That shall I answer, when you give me time," said Cethegus, coolly.
  "Because when I rushed forth, he fled with an exceeding rapid flight; leaped
  the low wall into the graveyard of the base Plebeians, and there among the
  cypresses and overthrown sepulchres escaped me for a while. I beat about most
  warily, and at length started him up again from the jaws of an obscene and
  broken catacomb. I gained on him at every step; heard the quick panting of
  his breath; stretched out my left to grasp him, while my right held
  unsheathed and ready the good stiletto that ne'er failed me. And
  now&mdash;now&mdash;by the great Jove! his tunic's hem was fluttering in my
  clutch, when my feet tripped over a prostrate column, that I was hurled five
  paces at the least in advance of the fugitive; and when I rose again, sore
  stunned, and bruised, and breathless, the slave had vanished."</p>

  <p>"And where, I prithee, during this well-concerted chase, was valiant
  Cassius?" enquired Cataline, with a hoarse sneering laugh.</p>

  <p>"During the chase, I knew not," answered Cethegus, "but when it was over,
  and I did return, I found him leaning on the wall, even in the angle whence
  the slave fled on our approach."</p>

  <p>"Asleep! I warrant me&mdash;by the great gods! asleep!" exclaimed the
  other; "but come!&mdash;come, let us onward,&mdash;I trow we have been waited
  for&mdash;and as we go, tell me, I do beseech thee, what was't that Cassius
  said, when the slave lay beside ye?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nay, but I have forgotten&mdash;some trivial thing or other&mdash;oh! now
  I do bethink me, he said it was a long walk to Marcus Laeca's."</p>

  <p>"Fool! fool! Double and treble fool! and dost thou call this nothing?
  Nothing to tell the loitering informer the very head and heart of our design?
  By Erebus! but I am sick&mdash;sick of the fools, with whom I am thus
  wretchedly assorted! Well! well! upon your own heads be it!" and instantly
  recovering his temper he walked on with his two confederates, now in deep
  silence, at a quick pace through the deserted streets towards their perilous
  rendezvous.</p>

  <p>Noiseless, with stealthy steps, they hurried onward, threading the narrow
  pass between the dusky hills, until they reached a dark and filthy lane which
  turning at right angles led to the broad thoroughfare of the more showy,
  though by no means less ill-famed Suburra. Into this they struck instantly,
  walking in single file, and keeping as nearly as possible in the middle of
  the causeway. The lane, which was composed of dwellings of the lowest order,
  tenanted by the most abject profligates, was dark as midnight; for the tall
  dingy buildings absolutely intercepted every ray of light that proceeded from
  the murky sky, and there was not a spark in any of the sordid casements, nor
  any votive lamp in that foul alley. The only glimpse of casual illumination,
  and that too barely serving to render the darkness and the filth perceptible,
  was the faint streak of lustre where the Suburra crossed the far extremity of
  the bye-path.</p>

  <p>Scarce had they made three paces down the alley, ere the quick eye of
  Cataline, for ever roving in search of aught suspicious, caught the dim
  outline of a human figure, stealing across this pallid gleam.</p>

  <p>"Hist! hist!" he whiskered in stern low tones, which though inaudible at
  three yards' distance completely filled the ears of him to whom they were
  addressed&mdash;"hist! hist! Cethegus; seest thou not&mdash;seest thou not
  there? If it be he, he 'scapes us not again!&mdash;out with thy weapon, man,
  and strike at once, if that thou have a chance; but if not, do thou go on
  with Cassius to the appointed place. Leave him to me! and say, I follow ye!
  See! he hath slunk into the darkness. Separate ye, and occupy the whole width
  of the street, while I dislodge him!"</p>

  <p>And as he spoke, unsheathing his broad poignard, but holding it concealed
  beneath his cassock, he strode on boldly, affecting the most perfect
  indifference, and even insolence of bearing.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the half-seen figure had entirely disappeared amid the gloom;
  yet had the wary eye of the conspirator, in the one momentary glance he had
  obtained, been able to detect with something very near to certainty the spot
  wherein the spy, if such he were, lay hidden. As he approached the
  place&mdash;whereat a heap of rubbish, the relics of a building not long ago
  as it would seem consumed by fire, projected far into the street&mdash;seeing
  no sign whatever of the man who, he was well assured, was not far distant, he
  paused a little so as to suffer his companions to draw near. Then as they
  came up with him, skilled in all deep and desperate wiles, he instantly
  commenced a whispered conversation, a tissue of mere nonsense, with here and
  there a word of seeming import clearly and audibly pronounced. Nor was his
  dark manoeuvre unsuccessful; for as he uttered the word "Cicero," watching
  meanwhile the heap of ruins as jealously as ever tiger glared on its destined
  prey, he caught a tremulous outline; and in a second's space, a small round
  object, like a man's head, was protruded from the darkness, and brought into
  relief against the brighter back ground.</p>

  <p>Then&mdash;then&mdash;with all the fury&mdash;all the lythe agile vigor,
  all the unrivalled speed, and concentrated fierceness of that tremendous
  beast of prey, he dashed upon his victim! But at the first slight movement of
  his sinewy form, the dimly seen shape vanished; impetuously he rushed on
  among the piles of scattered brick and rubbish, and, ere he saw the nature of
  the place, plunged down a deep descent into the cellar of the ruin.</p>

  <p>Lucky was it for Cataline, and most unfortunate for Rome, that when the
  building fell, its fragments had choked three parts of the depth of that
  subterranean vault; so that it was but from a height of three or four feet at
  the utmost, that the fierce desperado was precipitated!</p>

  <p>Still, to a man less active, the accident might have been serious, but
  with instinctive promptitude, backed by a wonderful exertion of muscular
  agility, he writhed his body even in the act of falling so that he lighted on
  his feet; and, ere a second had elapsed after his fall, was extricating
  himself from the broken masses of cement and brickwork, and soon stood
  unharmed, though somewhat stunned and shaken, on the very spot which had been
  occupied scarcely a minute past by the suspected spy.</p>

  <p>At the same point of time in which the conspirator fell, the person,
  whosoever he was, in pursuit of whom he had plunged so heedlessly into the
  ruins, darted forth from his concealment close to the body and within arm's
  length of the fierce Cethegus, whose attention was for the moment distracted
  from his watch by the catastrophe which had befallen his companion. Dodging
  by a quick movement&mdash;so quick that it seemed almost the result of
  instinct&mdash;so to elude the swift attempt of his enemy to arrest his
  progress, the spy was forced to rush almost into the arms of Cassius.</p>

  <p>Yet this appeared not to cause him any apprehension; for he dashed boldly
  on, till they were almost front to front; when, notwithstanding his unwieldy
  frame and inactivity of habit, spurred into something near to energy by the
  very imminence of peril, the worn-out debauchee bestirred himself as if to
  seize him.</p>

  <p>If such, however, were his intention, widely had he miscalculated his own
  powers, and fatally underrated the agility and strength of the
  stranger&mdash;a tall, thin, wiry man, well nigh six feet in height, broad
  shouldered, and deep chested, and thin flanked, and limbed like a Greek
  Athlete.</p>

  <p>On he dashed!&mdash;on&mdash;right on! till they stood face to face; and
  then with one quick blow, into which, as it seemed, he put but little of his
  strength, he hurled the burly Cassius to the earth, and fled with swift and
  noiseless steps into the deepest gloom. Perceiving on the instant the
  necessity of apprehending this now undoubted spy, the fiery Cethegus paused
  not one instant to look after his discomfited companions; but rushed away on
  the traces of the fugitive, who had perhaps gained, at the very utmost, a
  dozen paces' start of him, in that wild midnight race&mdash;that race for
  life and death.</p>

  <p>The slave, for such from his dark tunic he appeared to me, was evidently
  both a swift and practised runner; and well aware how great a stake was on
  his speed he now strained every muscle to escape, while scarce less fleet,
  and straining likewise every sinew to the utmost, Cethegus panted at his very
  heels.</p>

  <p>Before, however, they had run sixty yards, one swifter than Cethegus took
  up the race; and bruised although he was, and stunned, and almost breathless
  when he started, ere he had overtaken his staunch friend, which he did in a
  space wonderfully brief, he seemed to have shaken off every ailment, and to
  be in the completest and most firm possession of all his wonted energies. As
  he caught up Cethegus, he relaxed somewhat of his speed, and ran on by his
  side for some few yards at a sort of springy trot, speaking the while in a
  deep whisper,</p>

  <p>"Hist!" he said, "hist!&mdash;I am more swift of foot than thou, and
  deeper winded. Leave me to deal with this dog! Back thou, to him thou knowest
  of; sore is he hurt, I warrant me. Comfort him as thou best mayest, and hurry
  whither we were now going. 'Tis late even now&mdash;too late, I fear me much,
  and doubtless we are waited for. I have the heels of this same gallowsbird,
  that can I see already! Leave me to deal with him, and an he tells tales on
  us, then call me liar!"</p>

  <p>Already well nigh out of breath himself, while the endurance of the
  fugitive seemed in nowise affected, and aware of the vast superiority of his
  brother conspirator's powers to his own, Cethegus readily enough yielded to
  his positive and reiterated orders, and turning hastily backward, gathered up
  the bruised and groaning Cassius, and led him with all speed toward the
  well-known rendezvous in the house of Laeca.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile with desperate speed that headlong race continued; the gloomy
  alley was passed through; the wider street into which it debouched, vanished
  beneath their quick beating footsteps; the dark and shadowy arch, wherein the
  chief conspirator had lurked, was threaded at full speed; and still, although
  he toiled, till the sweat dripped from every pore like gouts of summer rain,
  although he plied each limb, till every over-wrought sinew seemed to crack,
  the hapless fugitive could gain no ground on his inveterate pursuer; who,
  cool, collected and unwearied, without one drop of perspiration on his dark
  sallow brow, without one panting sob in his deep breath, followed on at an
  equable and steady pace, gaining not any thing, nor seeming to desire to gain
  any thing, while yet within the precincts of the populous and thickly-settled
  city.</p>

  <p>But now they crossed the broad Virbian street. The slave, distinctly
  visible for such, as he glanced by a brightly decorated shrine girt by so
  many brilliant lamps as shewed its tenant idol to have no lack of
  worshippers, darted up a small street leading directly towards the
  Esquiline.</p>

  <p>"Now! now!" lisped Cataline between his hard-set teeth, "now he is mine,
  past rescue!"</p>

  <p>Up the dark filthy avenue they sped, the fierce pursuer now gaining on the
  fugitive at every bound; till, had he stretched his arm out, he might have
  seized him; till his breath, hot and strong, waved the disordered elf-locks
  that fell down upon the bare neck of his flying victim. And now the low wall
  of the Plebeian burying ground arose before them, shaded by mighty cypresses
  and overgrown with tangled ivy. At one wild bound the hunted slave leaped
  over it, into the trackless gloom. At one wild bound the fierce pursuer
  followed him. Scarcely a yard asunder they alighted on the rank grass of that
  charnel grove; and not three paces did they take more, ere Cataline had
  hurled his victim to the earth, and cast himself upon him; choking his cries
  for help by the compression of his sinewy fingers, which grasped with a
  tenacity little inferior to that of an iron vice the miserable wretch's
  gullet.</p>

  <p>He snatched his poniard from his sheath, reared it on high with a well
  skilled and steady hand! Down it came, noiseless and unseen. For there was
  not a ray of light to flash along its polished blade. Down it came with
  almost the speed and force of the electric fluid. A deep, dull, heavy sound
  was heard, as it was plunged into the yielding flesh, and the hot gushing
  blood spirted forth in a quick jet into the very face and mouth of the fell
  murderer. A terrible convulsion, a fierce writhing spasm followed&mdash;so
  strong, so muscularly powerful, that the stern gripe of Cataline was shaken
  from the throat of his victim, and from his dagger's hilt!</p>

  <p>In the last agony the murdered man cast off his slayer from his breast;
  started erect upon his feet! tore out, from the deep wound, the fatal weapon
  which had made it; hurled it far&mdash;far as his remaining strength
  permitted&mdash;into the rayless night; burst forth into a wild and yelling
  cry, half laughter and half imprecation; fell headlong to the
  earth&mdash;which was no more insensible than he, what time he struck it, to
  any sense of mortal pain or sorrow&mdash;and perished there alone, unpitied
  and unaided.</p>

  <p>"HABET!&mdash;he hath it!" muttered Cataline, quoting the well-known
  expression of the gladiatorial strife; "he hath it!&mdash;but all the plagues
  of Erebus, light on it&mdash;my good stiletto lies near to him in the swart
  darkness, to testify against me; nor by great Hecate! is there one chance to
  ten of finding it. Well! be it so!" he added, turning upon his heel, "be it
  so, for most like it hath fallen in the deep long grass, where none will ever
  find it; and if they do, I care not!"</p>

  <p>And with a reckless and unmoved demeanor, well pleased with his success,
  and casting not one retrospective thought toward his murdered victim, not one
  repentant sigh upon his awful crime, he too hurried away to join his dread
  associates at their appointed meeting.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch102"
     name="ch102"></a>II. &mdash; THE MEASURES</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>For what then do they pause? An hour to
     strike.</i> &mdash;Marino Faliero.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE hours of darkness had already well nigh passed, and but
  for the thick storm-clouds and the drizzling rain, some streaks of early dawn
  might have been seen on the horizon, when at the door of Marcus Laeca, in the
  low grovelling street of the Scythemakers&mdash;strange quarter for the
  residence of a patrician, one of the princely Porcii&mdash;the
  arch-conspirator stood still, and glared around with keen suspicious eyes,
  after his hurried walk.</p>

  <p>It was, however, yet as black as midnight; nor in that wretched and base
  suburb, tenanted only by poor laborious artizans, was there a single
  artificial light to relieve the gloom of nature.</p>

  <p>The house of Laeca! How little would the passer-by who looked in those
  days on its walls, decayed and moss-grown even then, and mouldering&mdash;how
  little would he have imagined that its fame would go down to the latest ages,
  imperishable through its owner's infamy.</p>

  <p>The house of Laeca! The days had been, while Rome was yet but young, when
  it stood far aloof in the gay green fields, the suburban villa of the proud
  Porcian house. Time passed, and fashions changed. Low streets and squalid
  tenements supplanted the rich fields and fruitful orchards, which had once
  rendered it so pleasant an abode. Its haughty lords abandoned it for a more
  stately palace nigh the forum, and for long years it had remained tenantless,
  voiceless, desolate. But dice, and wine, and women, mad luxury and boundless
  riot, had brought its owner down to indigence, and infamy and sin.</p>

  <p>The palace passed away from its inheritor. The ruin welcomed its last
  lord.</p>

  <p>And here, meet scene for orgies such as it beheld, Rome's parricides were
  wont to hold their murderous assemblies.</p>

  <p>With a slow stealthy tread, that woke no echo, Cataline advanced to the
  door. There was no lamp in the cell of the atriensis; no sign of wakefulness
  in any of the casements; yet at the first slight tap upon the stout oaken
  pannel, although it was scarce louder than the plash of the big raindrops
  from the eaves, another tap responded to it from within, so faint that it
  appeared an echo of the other. The rebel counted, as fast as possible,
  fifteen; and then tapped thrice as he had done before, meeting the same
  reply, a repetition of his own signal. After a moment's interval, a little
  wicket opened in the door, and a low voice asked "Who?" In the same guarded
  tone the answer was returned, "Cornelius." Again the voice asked, "Which?"
  and instantly, as Cataline replied, "the third," the door flew open, and he
  entered.</p>

  <p>The Atrium, or wide hall in which he stood, was all in utter darkness;
  there was no light on the altar of the Penates, which was placed by the
  <i>impluvium</i>&mdash;a large shallow tank of water occupying the centre of
  the hall in all Roman houses&mdash;nor any gleam from the <i>tablinum</i>, or
  closed gallery beyond, parted by heavy curtains from the audience
  chamber.</p>

  <p>There were no stars to glimmer through the opening in the roof above the
  central tank, yet the quick eye of the conspirator perceived, upon the
  instant, that two strong men with naked swords, their points within a hand's
  breadth of his bosom, stood on each side of the doorway.</p>

  <p>The gate was closed as silently as it had given him entrance; was barred
  and bolted; and till then no word was interchanged. When all, however, was
  secure, a deep rich voice, suppressed into a whisper, exclaimed "Sergius?"
  "Ay!" answered Cataline. "Come on!" and without farther parley they stole
  into the most secret chambers of the house, fearful as it appeared of the
  sounds of their own footsteps, much more of their own voices.</p>

  <p>Thus with extreme precaution, when they had traversed several chambers,
  among which were an indoor <i>triclinium</i>, or dining parlor, and a vast
  picture gallery, groping their way along in utter darkness, they reached a
  small square court, surrounded by a peristyle or colonnade, containing a
  dilapidated fountain. Passing through this, they reached a second dining
  room, where on the central table they found a small lamp burning, and by the
  aid of this, though still observing the most scrupulous silence, quickly
  attained their destination&mdash;a low and vaulted chamber entirely below the
  surface of the ground, accessible only by a stair defended by two doors of
  unusual thickness.</p>

  <p>That was a fitting place for deeds of darkness, councils of desperation,
  such as they held, who met within its gloomy precincts. The moisture, which
  dripped constantly from its groined roof of stone, had formed stalactites of
  dingy spar, whence the large gouts plashed heavily on the damp pavement; the
  walls were covered with green slimy mould; the atmosphere was close and
  foetid, and so heavy that the huge waxen torches, four of which stood in
  rusty iron candelabra, on a large slab of granite, burned dim and blue,
  casting a faint and ghastly light on lineaments so grim and truculent, or so
  unnaturally excited by the dominion of all hellish passions, that they had
  little need of anything extraneous to render them most hideous and appalling.
  There were some twenty-five men present, variously clad indeed, and of all
  ages, but evidently&mdash;though many had endeavoured to disguise the fact by
  poor and sordid garments&mdash;all of the higher ranks.</p>

  <p>Six or eight were among them, who feared not, nor were ashamed to appear
  there in the full splendor of their distinctive garb as Senators, prominent
  among whom was the most rash and furious of them all, Cethegus.</p>

  <p>He, at the moment when the arch-conspirator, accompanied by Laeca and the
  rest of those who had admitted him, entered the vault, was speaking with much
  energy and even fierceness of manner to three or four who stood apart a
  little from the rest with their backs to the door, listening with knitted
  brows, clenched hands, and lips compressed and bloodless, to his tremendous
  imprecations launched at the heads of all who were for any, even the least,
  delay in the accomplishment of their dread scheme of slaughter.</p>

  <p>One among them was a large stately looking personage, somewhat inclined to
  corpulence, but showing many a sign of giant strength, and vigor unimpaired
  by years or habit. His head was large but well shaped, with a broad and
  massive forehead, and an eye keen as the eagle's when soaring in his pride of
  place. His nose was prominent, but rather aquiline than Roman. His mouth,
  wide and thick-lipped, with square and fleshy jaws, was the worst feature in
  his face, and indicative of indulged sensuality and fierceness, if not of
  cruelty combined with the excess of pride.</p>

  <p>This man wore the plain toga and white tunic of a private citizen; but
  never did plebeian eye and lip flash with such concentrated haughtiness, curl
  with so fell a sneer, as those of that fallen consular, of that degraded
  senator, the haughtiest and most ambitious of a race never deficient in those
  qualities, he who, drunk with despairing pride, and deceived to his ruin by
  the double-tongued Sibylline prophecies, aspired to be that third Cornelius,
  who should be master of the world's mistress, Rome.</p>

  <p>The others were much younger men, for Lentulus was at that period already
  past his prime, and these&mdash;two more especially who looked mere
  boys&mdash;had scarcely reached youth's threshold; though their pale withered
  faces, and brows seared deeply by the scorching brand of evil passions,
  showed that in vice at least, if not in years, they had lived long
  already.</p>

  <p>Those two were senators in their full garniture, the sons of Servius
  Sylla, both beautiful almost as women, with soft and feminine features, and
  long curled hair, and lips of coral, from which in flippant and affected
  accents fell words, and breathed desires, that would have made the blood stop
  and turn stagnant at the heart of any one, not utterly polluted and devoid of
  every humane feeling.</p>

  <p>This little knot seemed fierce for action, fiery and panting with that
  wolfish thirst, to quench which blood must flow. But all the rest seemed
  dumb, and tongue-tied, and crest-fallen. The sullenness of fear brooded on
  every other face. The torpor of despairing crime, already in its own fancy
  baffled and detected, had fallen on every other heart. For, at the farther
  end of the room, whispering to his trembling hearers dubious and dark
  suspicions, with terror on his tongue, stood Cassius, exaggerating the
  adventures of the night.</p>

  <p>Such was the scene, when Cataline stalked into that bad conclave. The
  fires of hell itself could send forth no more blasting glare, than shot from
  his dark eyes, as he beheld, and read at half a glance their consternation.
  Bitter and blighting was the sneer upon his lip, as he stood motionless,
  gazing upon them for a little space. Then flinging his arm on high and
  striding to the table he dashed his hand upon it, that it rang and quivered
  to the blow.</p>

  <p>"What are ye?" he said slowly, in tones that thrilled to every heart, so
  piercing was their emphasis. "Men?&mdash;No, by the Gods! men rush on death
  for glory!&mdash;Women? They risk it, for their own, their children's, or
  their lover's safety!&mdash;Slaves?&mdash;Nay! even these things welcome it
  for freedom, or meet it with revenge! Less then, than men! than women,
  slaves, or beasts!&mdash;Perish like cattle, if ye will, unbound but
  unresisting, all armed but unavenged!&mdash;And ye&mdash;great Gods! I laugh
  to see your terror- blanched, blank visages. I laugh, but loathe in laughing!
  The destined dauntless sacrificers, who would imbue your knives in
  senatorial, consular gore! kindle your altars on the downfallen Capitol! and
  build your temples on the wreck of Empire! Ha! do you start? and does some
  touch of shame redden the sallow cheeks that courage had left bloodless? and
  do ye grasp your daggers, and rear your drooping heads? are ye men, once
  again? Why should ye not? what do ye see, what hear, whereat to falter? What
  oracle, what portent? Now, by the Gods! methought they spoke of victory and
  glory. Once more, what do ye fear, or wish? What, in the name of Hecate and
  Hades! What do ye wait for?"</p>

  <p>"A leader!" answered the rash Cethegus, excited now even beyond the bounds
  of ordinary rashness. "A day, a place, a signal!"</p>

  <p>"Have them, then, all," replied the other, still half scornfully. "Lo! I
  am here to lead; the field of Mars will give a place; the consular elections
  an occasion; the blood of Cicero a signal!"</p>

  <p>"Be it so!" instantly replied Cethegus; "be it so! thou hast spoken, as
  the times warrant, boldly; and upon my head be it, that our deeds shall
  respond to thy daring words, with equal daring!"</p>

  <p>And a loud hum of general assent succeeded to his stirring accents; and a
  quick fluttering sound ran through the whole assemblage, as every man,
  released from the constraint of deep and silent expectation, altered his
  posture somewhat, and drew a long breath at the close. But the conspirator
  paused not. He saw immediately the effect which had been made upon the minds
  of all, by what had passed. He perceived the absolute necessity of following
  that impulse up to action, before, by a revulsion no less sudden than the
  late change from despondency to fierceness, their minds should again subside
  into the lethargy of doubt and dismay.</p>

  <p>"But say thou, Sergius," he continued, "how shall it be, and who shall
  strike the blow that is to seal Rome's liberty, our vengeance?"</p>

  <p>"First swear we!" answered Cataline. "Laeca, the eagle, and the bowl!"</p>

  <p>"Lo! they are here, my Sergius," answered the master of the house, drawing
  aside a piece of crimson drapery, which covered a small niche or recess in
  the wall, and displaying by the movement a silver eagle, its pinions wide
  extended, and its talons grasping a thunderbolt, placed on a pedestal, under
  a small but exquisitely sculptured shrine of Parian marble. Before the image
  there stood a votive lamp, fed by the richest oils, a mighty bowl of silver
  half filled with the red Massic wine, and many <i>paterae</i>, or sacrificial
  vessels of a yet richer metal.</p>

  <p>"Hear, bird of Mars, and of Quirinus"&mdash;cried Cataline, without a
  pause, stretching his hands toward the glittering effigy&mdash;"Hear thou,
  and be propitious! Thou, who didst all-triumphant guide a yet greater than
  Quirinus to deeds of might and glory; thou, who wert worshipped by the
  charging shout of Marius, and consecrated by the gore of Cimbric myriads;
  thou, who wert erst enshrined on the Capitoline, what time the proud
  patricians veiled their haughty crests before the conquering plebeian; thou,
  who shalt sit again sublime upon those ramparts, meet aery for thine
  unvanquished pinion; shalt drink again libations, boundless libations of rich
  Roman life-blood, hot from patrician hearts, smoking from every kennel! Hear
  and receive our oaths&mdash;listen and be propitious!"</p>

  <p>He spoke, and seizing from the pedestal a sacrificial knife, which lay
  beside the bowl, opened a small vein in his arm, and suffered the warm stream
  to gush into the wine. While the red current was yet flowing, he gave the
  weapon to Cethegus, and he did likewise, passing it in his turn to the
  conspirator who stood beside him, and he in like manner to the next, till
  each one in his turn had shed his blood into the bowl, which now mantled to
  the brim with a foul and sacrilegious mixture, the richest vintage of the
  Massic hills, curdled with human gore.</p>

  <p>Then filling out a golden goblet for himself, "Hear, God of war," cried
  Cataline, "unto whose minister and omen we offer daily worship; hear, mighty
  Mars, the homicide and the avenger; and thou, most ancient goddess, hear,
  Nemesis! and Hecate, and Hades! and all ye powers of darkness, Furies and
  Fates, hear ye! For unto ye we swear, never to quench the torch; never to
  sheath the brand; till all our foes be prostrate, till not one drop shall run
  in living veins of Rome's patricians; till not one hearth shall warm; one
  roof shall shelter; till Rome shall be like Carthage, and we, like mighty
  Marius, lords and spectators of her desolation! We swear! we taste the
  consecrated cup! and thus may his blood flow, who shall, for pity or for
  fear, forgive or fail or falter&mdash;his own blood, and his wife's, and that
  of all his race forever! May vultures tear their eyes, yet fluttering with
  quick vision; may wolves tug at their heart-strings, yet strong with vigorous
  life; may infamy be their inheritance, and Tartarus receive their
  spirits!"</p>

  <p>And while he spoke, he sipped the cup of horror with unreluctant lips, and
  dashed the goblet with the residue over the pedestal and shrine. And there
  was not one there who shrank from that foul draught. With ashy cheeks indeed,
  but knitted brows, and their lips reeking red with the abomination, but
  fearless and unfaltering, they pledged in clear and solemn tones, each after
  each, that awful imprecation, and cast their goblets down, that the floor
  swam in blood; and grasped each others' hands, sworn comrades from that hour
  even to the gates of hell.</p>

  <p>A long and impressive silence followed. For every heart there, even of the
  boldest, recoiled as it were for a moment on itself, not altogether in regret
  or fear, much less in anything approaching to compunction or remorse; but in
  a sort of secret horror, that they were now involved beyond all hope of
  extrication, beyond all possibility of turning back or halting! And Cataline,
  endowed with almost superhuman shrewdness, and himself quite immovable of
  purpose, perceived the feelings that actuated all the others&mdash;which he
  felt not, nor cared for&mdash;and called on Laeca to bring wine.</p>

  <p>"Wine, comrades," he exclaimed, "pure, generous, noble wine, to wash away
  the rank drops from our lips, that are more suited to our blades! to make our
  veins leap cheerily to the blythe inspiration of the God! and last, not
  least, to guard us from the damps of this sweet chamber, which alone of his
  bounteous hospitality our Porcius has vouchsafed to us!" And on the instant,
  the master&mdash;for they dared trust no slaves&mdash;bore in two earthen
  vases, one of strong Chian from the Greek Isle of the Egean, the other of
  Falernian, the fruitiest and richest of the Italian wines, not much unlike
  the modern sherry, but having still more body, and many cyathi, or drinking
  cups; but he brought in no water, wherewith the more temperate ancients were
  wont to mix their heady wines, even in so great a ratio as nine to one of the
  generous liquor.</p>

  <p>"Fill now! fill all!" cried Cataline, and with the word he drained a
  brimming cup. "Rare liquor this, my Marcus," he continued; "whence had'st
  thou this Falernian? 'tis of thine inmost brand, I doubt not. In whose
  consulship did it imbibe the smoke?"</p>

  <p>"The first of Caius Marius."</p>

  <p>"Forty-four years, a ripe age," said Cethegus, "but twill be better forty
  years hence. Strange, by the Gods! that of the two best things on earth,
  women and wine, the nature should so differ. The wine is crude still, when
  the girl is mellow; but it is ripe, long after she is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Rotten, by Venus!"&mdash;interposed Caeparius, swearing the harlot's
  oath; "Rotten, and in the lap of Lamia!"</p>

  <p>"But heard ye not," asked Cataline, "or hearing, did ye not accept the
  omen!&mdash;in whose first Consulship this same Falernian jar was
  sealed?"</p>

  <p>"Marius! By Hercules! an omen! oh, may it turn out well!" exclaimed the
  superstitious Lentulus.</p>

  <p>"Sayest thou, my Sura? well! drink we to the omen, and may we to the
  valour and the principles of Marius unite the fortunes of his rival&mdash;of
  all-triumphant Sylla!"</p>

  <p>A burst of acclamations replied to the happy hit, and seeing now his aim
  entirely accomplished, Cataline checked the revel; their blood was up; no
  fear of chilling counsels!</p>

  <p>"Now then," he said, "before we drink like boon companions, let us consult
  like men; there is need now of counsel; that once finished"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Fulvia awaits me," interrupted Cassius, "Fulvia, worth fifty revels!"</p>

  <p>"And me Sempronia," lisped the younger and more beautiful of the twin
  Sylla.</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile," exclaimed Autronius, "let us comprehend, so shall we need no
  farther meetings&mdash;each of which risks the awakening of suspicion, and it
  may well be of discovery. Let us now comprehend, that, when the time comes,
  we may all perform our duty. Speak to us, therefore, Sergius."</p>

  <p>No farther exhortation was required; for coolly the conspirator arose to
  set before his desperate companions, the plans which he had laid so deeply,
  that it seemed scarcely possible that they should fail; and not a breath or
  whisper interrupted him as he proceeded.</p>

  <p>"Were I not certain of the men," he said, "to whom I speak, I could say
  many things that should arouse you, so that you should catch with fiery
  eagerness at aught that promised a more tolerable position. I could recount
  the luxuries of wealth which you once knew; the agonies of poverty beneath
  which, to no purpose, you lie groaning. I could point out your actual
  inability to live, however basely&mdash;deprived of character and
  credit&mdash;devoid of any relics of your fortunes! weighed to the very earth
  by debts, the interest alone of which has swallowed up your patrimonies, and
  gapes even yet for more! fettered by bail-bonds, to fly which is infamy, and
  to abide them ruin! shunned, scorned, despised, and hated, if not feared by
  all men. I could paint, to your very eyes, ourselves in rags or fetters! our
  enemies in robes of office, seated on curule chairs, swaying the fate of
  nations, dispensing by a nod the wealth of plundered provinces! I could
  reverse the picture. But, as it is, your present miseries and your past deeds
  dissuade me. Your hopelessness and daring, your wrongs and valor, your
  injuries and thirst of vengeance, warn me, alike, that words are weak, and
  exhortation needless. Now understand with me, how matters stand. The stake
  for which we play, is fair before your eyes:&mdash;learn how our throw for it
  is certain. The consular elections, as you all well know, will be held, as
  proclaimed already, on the fifteenth day before the calends of November. My
  rivals are Sulpicius, Muraena, and Silanus. Antonius and Cicero will
  preside&mdash;the first, my friend! a bold and noble Roman! He waits but an
  occasion to declare for us. Now, mark me. Caius Manlius&mdash;you all do know
  the man, an old and practised soldier, a scar-seamed veteran of
  Sylla,&mdash;will on that very day display yon eagle to twenty thousand men,
  well armed, and brave, and desperate as ourselves, at Fiesol. Septimius of
  Camerinum writes from the Picene district, that thirty thousand slaves will
  rise there at his bidding; while Caius Julius, sent to that end into Apulia,
  has given out arms and nominated leaders to twice five thousand there. Ere
  this, they have received my mandate to collect their forces, and to march on
  that same day toward Rome. Three several armies, to meet which there is not
  one legion on this side of Cisalpine Gaul! What, then, even if all were peace
  in Rome, what then could stand against us? But there shall be that done here,
  here in the very seat and heart, as I may say, of Empire, that shall dismay
  and paralyse all who would else oppose us. Cethegus, when the centuries are
  all assembled in the field of Mars, with fifteen hundred gladiators well
  armed and exercised even now, sets on the guard in the Janiculum, and beats
  their standard down. Then, while all is confusion, Statilius and Gabinius
  with their households,&mdash;whom, his work done, Cethegus will join
  straightway&mdash;will fire the city in twelve several places, break open the
  prison doors, and crying "Liberty to slaves!" and "Abolition of all
  debts!"&mdash;rush diverse throughout the streets, still gathering numbers as
  they go. Meanwhile, with Lentulus and Cassius, the clients of your houses
  being armed beneath their togas with swords and breast-plates, and casques
  ready to be donned, I will make sure of Cicero and the rest. Havoc, and
  slaughter, and flames every where will make the city ours. Then ye, who have
  no duty set, hear, and mark this: always to kill is to do something! the
  more, and nobler, so much the better deed! Remembering this, that sons have
  ready access to their sires, who for the most part are their bitterest foes!
  and that to spare none we are sworn&mdash;how, and how deeply, it needs not
  to remind you. More words are bootless, since to all here it must be evident
  that these things, planned thus far with deep and prudent council, once
  executed with that dauntless daring, which alone stands for armor, and for
  weapons, and, by the Gods! for bulwarks of defence, must win us liberty and
  glory, more over wealth, and luxury, and power, in which names is embraced
  the sum of all felicity. Therefore, now, I exhort you not; for if the woes
  which you would shun, the prizes which you shall attain, exhort you not, all
  words of man, all portents of the Gods, are dumb, and voiceless, and in vain!
  Mark the day only, and remember, that if not ye, at least your sires were
  Romans and were men!"</p>

  <p>"Bravely, my Sergius, hast thou spoken, and well done!" cried at once
  several voices of the more prominent partisans.</p>

  <p>"By the Gods! what a leader!" whispered Longinus Cassius to his
  neighbor.</p>

  <p>"Fabius in council," cried Cethegus, "Marcellus in the field!"</p>

  <p>"Moreover, fellow-soldiers," exclaimed Lentulus, "hear this: although he
  join not with us now, through policy, Antonius, the Consul, is in heart ours,
  and waits but for the first success to declare himself for the cause in arms.
  Crassus, the rich&mdash;Caesar, the people's idol&mdash;have heard our
  counsels, and approve them. The first blow struck, their influence, their
  names, their riches, and their popularity, strike with us&mdash;trustier
  friends, by Pollux! and more potent, than fifty thousand swordsmen!"</p>

  <p>A louder and more general burst of acclamation and applause than that
  which had succeeded Cataline's address, burst from the lips of all, as those
  great names dropped from the tongue of Lentulus; and one voice cried
  aloud&mdash;it was the voice of Curius, intoxicated as it were with present
  triumph&mdash;</p>

  <p>"By all the Gods! Rome is our own! our own, even now, to portion out among
  our friends, our mistresses, our slaves!"</p>

  <p>"Not Rome&mdash;but Rome's inheritance, the world!" exclaimed another. "If
  we win, all the universe is ours&mdash;and see how small the stake; when, if
  we fail"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"By Hades, we'll not fail!" Cataline interrupted him, in his deep
  penetrating tones. "We cannot, and we will not! and now, for I wax somewhat
  weary, we will break up this conclave. We meet at the comitia!"</p>

  <p>"And the Slave?" whispered Cethegus, with an inquiring accent, in his
  ear&mdash;"the Slave, my Sergius?"</p>

  <p>"Will tell no tales of us," replied the other, with a hoarse laugh,
  "unless it be to Lamia."</p>

  <p>Thus they spoke as they left the house; and ere the day had yet begun to
  glimmer with the first morning twilight&mdash;so darkly did the clouds still
  muster over the mighty city&mdash;went on their different ways toward their
  several homes, unseen, and, as they fondly fancied, unsuspected.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch103"
     name="ch103"></a>III. &mdash; THE LOVERS</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>Fair lovers, ye are fortunately met.</i>
     &mdash;Midsummer Night's Dream.</p><br>

  <p class="first">ON the same night, and almost at the same hour of the night,
  wherein that dreadful conclave was assembled at the house of Laeca, a small
  domestic group, consisting indeed only of three individuals, was gathered in
  the tablinum, or saloon, of an elegant though modest villa, situate in the
  outskirts of the city, fronting the street that led over the Mulvian bridge
  to the AEmilian way, and having a large garden communicating in the rear with
  the plebeian cemetery on the Esquiline.</p>

  <p>It was a gay and beautiful apartment, of small dimensions, but replete
  with all those graceful objects, those manifold appliances of refined taste
  and pleasure, for which the Romans, austere and poor no longer, had, since
  their late acquaintance with Athenian polish and Oriental luxury, acquired a
  predilection&mdash;ominous, as their sterner patriots fancied, of personal
  degeneracy and national decay.</p>

  <p>Divided from the hall of reception by thick soft curtains, woven from the
  choice wool of Calabria, and glowing with the richest hues of the Tyrian
  crimson; and curtained with hangings of the same costly fabric around the
  windows, both of which with the doorway opened upon a peristyle; that little
  chamber wore an air of comfort, that charmed the eye more even than its
  decorations. Yet these were of no common order; for the floor was tesselated
  in rare patterns of mosaic work, showing its exquisite devices and bright
  colors, where they were not concealed by a footstool of embroidered tapestry.
  The walls were portioned out into compartments, each framed by a broad border
  of gilded scroll-work on a crimson ground, and containing an elaborately
  finished fresco painting; which, could they have been seen by any critical
  eye of modern days, would have set at rest for ever the question as to the
  state of this art among the ancients. The subject was a favorite one with all
  artists of all ages,&mdash;from the world-famous Iliad: the story of the
  goddess-born Achilles. Here tutored by the wise Centaur, Chiron, in
  horsemanship and archery, and all that makes a hero; here tearing off the
  virgin mitre, to don the glittering casque proffered, with sword and buckler,
  among effeminate wares, by the disguised Ulysses; there wandering in the
  despondent gloom of injured pride along the stormy sea, meet listener to his
  haughty sorrows, while in the distance, turning her tearful eyes back to her
  lord, Briseis went unwilling at the behest of the unwilling heralds. Again he
  was presented, mourning with frantic grief over the corpse of his beloved
  Patroclus&mdash;grief that called up his Nereid mother from the blue depths
  of her native element; and, in the last, chasing with unexampled speed the
  flying Hector, who, stunned and destined by the Gods to ruin, dared not await
  his onset, while Priam veiled his face upon the ramparts, and Hecuba already
  tore her hair, presaging the destruction of Troy's invincible unshaken
  column.(2)</p>

  <p>A small wood fire blazed cheerfully upon the hearth, round which were
  clustered, in uncouth attitudes of old Etruscan sculpture, the grim and
  grotesque figures of the household Gods. Two lamps of bronze, each with four
  burners, placed on tall candelabra exquisitely carved in the same metal,
  diffused a soft calm radiance through the room, accompanied by an aromatic
  odor from the perfumed vegetable oil which fed their light. Upon a circular
  table of dark-grained citrean wood, inlaid with ivory and silver, were
  several rolls of parchment and papyrus, the books of the day, some of them
  splendidly emblazoned and illuminated; a lyre of tortoiseshell, and near to
  it the slender plectrum by which its cords were wakened to melody. Two or
  three little flasks of agate and of onyx containing some choice perfumes, a
  Tuscan vase full of fresh-gathered flowers, and several articles yet more
  decidedly feminine, were scattered on the board; needles, and thread of
  various hues, and twine of gold and silver, and some embroidery, half
  finished, and as it would seem but that instant laid aside. Such was the
  aspect of the saloon wherein three persons were sitting on that night; who,
  though they were unconscious, nay, even unsuspicious of the existence of
  conspiracy and treason, were destined, ere many days should elapse, to be
  involved in its desperate mazes; to act conspicuous parts and undergo strange
  perils, in the dread drama of the times.</p>

  <p>They were of different years and sex&mdash;one, a magnificent and stately
  matron, such as Rome's matrons were when Rome was at the proudest, already
  well advanced in years, yet still possessing not merely the remains of former
  charms, but much of real beauty, and that too of the noblest and most exalted
  order. Her hair, which had been black in her youth as the raven's wing, was
  still, though mixed with many a line of silver, luxuriant and profuse as
  ever. Simply and closely braided over her broad and intellectual temples, and
  gathered into a thick knot behind, it displayed admirably the contour of her
  head, and suited the severe and classic style of her strictly Roman features.
  The straight-cut eye-brows, the clear and piercing eye, the aquiline nose,
  and the firm thin lips, spoke worlds of character and decision; yet that
  which might have otherwise seemed stern and even harsh, was softened by a
  smile of singular sweetness, and by a lighting up of the whole countenance,
  which at times imparted to those high features an expression of benevolence,
  gentle and feminine in the extreme.</p>

  <p>Her stature was well suited to the style of her lineaments; majestically
  tall and stately, and though attenuated something by the near approach of old
  age, preserving still the soft and flowing outlines of a form, which had in
  youth been noted for roundness and voluptuous symmetry.</p>

  <p>She wore the plain white robes, bordered and zoned with crimson, of a
  patrician lady, but save one massive signet on the third finger of her right
  hand she had no gem or ornament whatever; and as she sat a little way aloof
  from her younger companions, drawing the slender threads with many a graceful
  motion from the revolving distaff into the basket by her side, she might have
  passed for her, whose proud prayer, that she might be known not as the
  daughter of the Scipios but as the mother of the Gracchi, was but too fatally
  fulfilled in the death-earned celebrity of those her boasted jewels.</p>

  <p>The other lady was smaller, slighter, fairer, and altogether so different
  in mien, complexion, stature, and expression, that it was difficult even for
  those who knew them well to believe that they were a mother and her only
  child. For even in her flush of beauty, the elder lady, while in the full
  splendor of Italian womanhood, must ever have been calculated to inspire
  admiration, not all unmixed with awe, rather than tenderness or love. The
  daughter, on the other hand, was one whose every gesture, smile, word,
  glance, bespoke that passion latent in itself, which it awakened in the bosom
  of all beholders.</p>

  <p>Slightly above the middle stature, and with a waist of scarce a span's
  circumference, her form was exquisitely full and rounded; the sweeping
  outlines of her snow-white and dimpled arms, bare to the shoulders, and set
  off by many strings of pearl, which were themselves scarcely whiter than the
  skin on which they rested; the swan-like curvature of the dazzling neck; the
  wavy and voluptuous development of her bust, shrouded but not concealed by
  the plaits of her white linen <i>stola</i>, fastened on either shoulder by a
  clasp of golden fillagree, and gathered just above her hips by a gilt zone of
  the Grecian fashion; the small and shapely foot, which peered out with its
  jewelled sandal under her gold-fringed draperies; combined to present to the
  eye a very incarnation of that ideal loveliness, which haunts enamored poets
  in their dreams, the girl just bursting out of girlhood, the glowing Hebe of
  the soft and sunny south. But if her form was lovely, how shall the pen of
  mortal describe the wild romantic beauty of her soul-speaking features. The
  rich redundancy of her dark auburn hair, black where the shadows rested on it
  as the sable locks of night, but glittering out wherever a wandering ray
  glanced on its glossy surface like the bright tresses of Aurora. The broad
  and marble forehead, the pencilled brows, and the large liquid eyes fraught
  with a mild and lustrous languor; the cheeks, pale in their wonted mood as
  alabaster, yet eloquent at times with warm and passionate blushes. The lips,
  redder than aught on earth which shares both hue and softness; and, more than
  all, the deep and indescribable expression which genius prints on every
  lineament of those, who claim that rarest and most godlike of endowments.</p>

  <p>She was a thing to dream of, not describe; to dream of in some faint and
  breathless eve of early summer, beside the margin of some haunted streamlet,
  beneath the shade of twilight boughs in which the fitful breeze awakes that
  whispering melody, believed by the poetic ancients to be the chorus of the
  wood-nymph; to dream of and adore&mdash;even as she was adored by him who sat
  beside her, and watched each varying expression, that swept across her
  speaking features; and hung upon each accent of the low silvery voice, as if
  he feared it were the last to which his soul should thrill responsive.</p>

  <p>He was a tall and powerful youth of twenty-four or five years; yet, though
  his limbs were sinewy and lithe, and though his deep round chest, thin
  flanks, and muscular shoulders gave token of much growing strength, it was
  still evident that, his stature having been prematurely gained, he lacked
  much of that degree of power of which his frame gave promise. For though his
  limbs were well formed they were scarcely set, or furnished, as we should say
  in speaking of an animal; and the strength, which he in truth possessed, was
  that of elasticity and youthful vigor, capable rather of violent though brief
  exertion, than that severe and trained robustness, which can for long
  continuous periods sustain the strongest and most trying labor.</p>

  <p>His hair was dark and curling&mdash;his eye bright, clear, and
  penetrating; yet was its glance at times wavering and undetermined, such as
  would indicate perhaps a want of steadiness of purpose, not of corporeal
  resolution, for that was disproved by one glance at the decided curve of his
  bold clean-cut mouth, and the square outlines of his massive jaw, which
  seemed almost to betoken fierceness. There was a quick short flash at times,
  keen as the falcon's, in the unsteady eye, that told of energy enough within
  and stirring spirit to prompt daring deeds, the momentary irresolution
  conquered. There was a frank and cheery smile that oftentimes belied the
  auguries drawn from the other features; and, more than all, there was a
  tranquil sweet expression, which now and then pervaded the whole countenance,
  altering for the better its entire character, and betokening more mind and
  deeper feelings, than would at first have been suspected from his aspect.</p>

  <p>His dress was the ordinary tunic of the day, of plain white woollen stuff,
  belted about the middle by a girdle, which contained his ivory tablets, and
  the metallic pencil used for writing on their waxed surface, together with
  his handkerchief and purse; but nothing bearing the semblance of a weapon,
  not so much even as a common knife. His legs and arms were bare, his feet
  being protected merely by sandals of fine leather having the clasps or
  fibulae of gold; as was the buckle of his girdle, and one huge signet ring,
  which was his only ornament.</p>

  <p>His toga, which had been laid aside on entering the saloon, as was the
  custom of the Romans in their own families, or among private friends, hung on
  the back of an armed chair; of ample size and fine material, but
  undistinguished by the marks of senatorial or equestrian rank. Such was the
  aspect, such the bearing of the youth, who might be safely deemed the girl's
  permitted suitor, from his whole air and manner, as he listened to the soft
  voice of his beautiful mistress. For as they sat there side by side, perusing
  from an illuminated scroll the elegies of some long-perished, long-forgotten
  poet, now reading audibly the smooth and honeyed lines, now commenting with
  playful criticism on the style, or carrying out with all the fervor and
  romance of young poetical temperament the half obscure allusions of the bard,
  no one could doubt that they were lovers; especially if he marked the calm
  and well-pleased smile that stole from time to time across the proud features
  of that patrician lady; who, sitting but a little way apart,
  watched&mdash;while she reeled off skein after skein of the fine Byssine flax
  in silence&mdash;the quiet happiness of the young pair.</p>

  <p>Thus had the evening passed, not long nor tediously to any of the party;
  and midnight was at hand; when there entered from the atrium a grey-headed
  slave bearing a tray covered with light refreshments&mdash;fresh herbs,
  endive and mallows sprinkled with snow, ripe figs, eggs and anchovies, dried
  grapes, and cakes of candied honey; while two boys of rare beauty followed,
  one carrying a flagon of Chian wine diluted with snow water, the other a
  platter richly chased in gold covered with cyathi, or drinking cups, some of
  plain chrystal, some of that unknown myrrhine fabric,(3) which is believed by
  many scholars to have been highly vitrified and half-transparent
  porcelain.</p>

  <p class="footnote">3. That it was such, can scarce be doubted, from the line
  of Martial: "Myrrheaque in Parthis pocula cocta focis."</p>

  <p>A second slave brought in a folded stand, like a camp stool in shape, on
  which the tray was speedily deposited, while on a slab of Parian marble near
  which the two boys took their stand, the wine and goblets were arranged in
  glittering order.</p>

  <p>So silently, however, was all this done, that, their preparations made,
  the elder slaves had retired with a deep genuflexion, leaving the boys only
  to administer at that unceremonious banquet, ere the young couple, whose
  backs were turned towards the table, perceived the interruption.</p>

  <p>The brilliant smile, which has been mentioned, beamed from the features of
  the elder lady, as she perceived how thoroughly engrossed, even to the
  unconsciousness of any passing sound, they were, whom, rising for the
  purpose, and laying by her work, she now proceeded to recall to sublunary
  matters.</p>

  <p>"Paullus," she said, "and you, my Julia, ye are unconscious how the
  fleeting hours have slipped away. The night hath far advanced into the third
  watch. I would not part ye needlessly, nor over soon, especially when you
  must so soon perforce be severed; but we must not forget how long a homeward
  walk awaits our dear Arvina. Come, then, and partake some slight refreshment,
  before you say farewell.</p>

  <p>"How thoughtless in me, to have detained you thus, and with a mile to walk
  this murky and unpleasant night. They say, too, that the streets are
  dangerous of late, haunted by dissolute night-revellers&mdash;that villain
  Clodius and his infamous co-mates. I tremble like a leaf if I but meet them
  in broad day&mdash;and what if you should fall in with them, when flushed
  with wine, and ripe for any outrage?"</p>

  <p>"Fie! dear one, fie!" answered the young man with a smile&mdash;"a sorry
  soldier wouldst thou make of me, who am within so short a space to meet the
  savages of Pontus, under our mighty Pompey! There is no danger, Julia, here
  in the heart of Rome; and my stout freedman Thrasea awaits me with his torch.
  Nor is it so far either to my house, for those who cross, as I shall do, the
  cemetery on the Esquiline. 'Tis but a step across the sumptuous Carinae to
  the Caelian."</p>

  <p>"But surely, surely, Paul," exclaimed the lovely girl, laying her hand
  upon his arm, "thou wouldst not cross that fearful burying-ground, haunted by
  all things awful and obscene, thus at the dead of night. Oh! do not,
  dearest," she continued, "thou knowest not what wild terrible tales are rife,
  of sounds and sights unnatural and superhuman, encountered in those loathsome
  precincts. 'Tis a mere tempting of the Dark Ones, to brave the horrors of
  that place!"</p>

  <p>"The Gods, my Julia," replied the youth unmoved by her alarm, "the Gods
  are never absent from their votaries, so they be innocent and pure of spirit.
  For me! I am unconscious of a wilful fault, and fear not anything."</p>

  <p>"Well said, Paullus Arvina," exclaimed the elder lady, "and worthily of
  your descent from the Caecilii"&mdash;for from that noble house his family
  indeed derived its origin. "But, although I," she added, "counsel you not to
  heed our Julia's girlish terrors, I love you not to walk by night so
  slenderly accompanied. Ho! boy, go summon me the steward, and bid him
  straightway arm four of the Thracian slaves."</p>

  <p>"No! by the Gods, Hortensia!" the young man interrupted her, his whole
  face flushing with excitement, "you do shame to my manhood, by your caution.
  There is in truth no shadow of danger. Besides," he added, laughing at his
  own impetuosity, "I shall be far beyond the Esquiline ere excellent old Davus
  could rouse those sturdy knaves of yours, or find the armory key; for lo! I
  will but tarry to taste one cup of your choice of Chian to my Julia's health,
  and then straight homeward. Have a care, my fair boy, that flagon is too
  heavy to be lifted safely by such small hands as thine, and its contents too
  precious to be wasted. Soh! that's well done; thou'lt prove a second
  Ganymede! Health, Julia, and good dreams&mdash;may all fair things attend
  thee, until we meet again."</p>

  <p>"And when shall that be, Paul," whispered his mistress, a momentary flush
  shooting across brow, neck, and bosom, as she spoke, and leaving her, a
  second afterward, even paler than her wont, between anxiety and fear, and the
  pain even of this temporary parting&mdash;"when shall that be?
  to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"Surely, to-morrow! fairest," he replied, clasping her little hand with a
  fond pressure, "unless, which may the Gods avert! anything unforeseen prevent
  me. Give me my toga, boy," he added, "and see if Thrasea waits, and if his
  torch be lighted."</p>

  <p>"Bid him come hither, Geta," Hortensia interposed, addressing the boy as
  he left the room, "and tell old Davus to accompany him, bringing the keys of
  the peristyle and of the garden gate. So shalt thou gain the Esquiline more
  easily."</p>

  <p>Her orders were obeyed as soon as they were spoken, and but few moments
  intervened before the aged steward, and the freedman with his staff and
  torch, the latter so prepared by an art common to the ancients as to set
  almost any violence of wind or rain at defiance, stood waiting their
  commands.</p>

  <p>Familiar and kind words were interchanged between those high-born ladies
  and the trustworthy follower of young Arvina. For those were days, when no
  cold etiquette fettered the freedom of the tongue, and when no rank, how
  stately or how proud soever, induced austerity of bearing or haughtiness
  toward inferiors; and these concluded, greetings, briefer but far more warm,
  followed between the master and his intended bride.</p>

  <p>"Sweet slumbers, Julia, and a happy wakening attend you! Farewell,
  Hortensia; both of ye farewell!" and passing into the colonnade through the
  door which Davus had unlocked, he drew the lappet of his toga over his head
  after the fashion of a hood to shield it from the drizzling rain&mdash;for,
  except on a journey, the hardy Romans never wore any hat or
  headgear&mdash;and hastened with a firm and regular step along the marble
  peristyle. This portico, or rather piazza, enclosed, by a double row of
  Tuscan columns, a few small flower beds, and a fountain springing high in the
  air from the conch of a Triton, and falling back into a large shell of white
  marble, which it was so contrived as to keep ever full without at any time
  overflowing.</p>

  <p>Beyond this was a summer triclinium or dining room facing the north, and
  provided with the three-sided couch, from which it took its name, embracing a
  circular table. Through this they passed into a smaller court adorned like
  the other by a jet d'eau, surrounded by several small boudoirs and bed
  chambers luxuriously decorated, which were set apart to the use of the
  females of the family, and guarded night and day by the most trusty of the
  slaves.</p>

  <p>Hence a strong door gave access to a walled space, throughout the length
  of which on either hand ran a long range of offices, and above them the
  dormitories of the slaves, with a small porter's lodge or guard room by the
  gate, opening on the orchard in the rear.</p>

  <p>Therein were stationed the four Thracians, mentioned by Hortensia, whose
  duty it was to keep watch alternately over the safety of the postern,
  although the key was not entrusted to their charge; and he, whose watch it
  was, started up from a bench on which he had been stretched, and looked forth
  torch in hand at the sound of approaching footsteps. Seeing, however, who it
  was, and that the steward attended him, he lent his aid in opening the
  postern, and reverently bowed the knee to Arvina, as he departed from the
  hospitable villa.</p>

  <p>The orchard through which lay his onward progress, occupied a considerable
  extent of ground, laid out in terraces adorned with marble urns and statues,
  long bowery walks sheltered by vine-clad trellices, and rows of fruit trees
  interspersed with many a shadowy clump of the rich evergreen holm-oak, the
  tufted stone-pine, the clustering arbutus, and smooth-leaved laurestinus.
  This lovely spot was separated from the plebeian cemetery only&mdash;as has
  been said already&mdash;by a low wall; and therefore in those days of
  universal superstition of the lower orders and the slaves, and many too of
  their employers, would have eschewed it as a place ominous of evil, if not
  unsafe and perilous.</p>

  <p>The mind of Paul, however, if not entirely free from any touch of
  superstitious awe, which at that period of the world would have been a thing
  altogether unnatural and impossible, was at least of too firm a mould to
  shake at mere imaginary terrors; and he strode on, lighted by his
  torch-bearer, through the dark mazes of the orchard, with all his thoughts
  engrossed by the pleasant reminiscences of the past evening. Thoughtless,
  however, as he was, and bold, he yet recoiled a step, and the blood rushed
  tumultuously to his heart, as a loud yelling cry, protracted strangely, and
  ending in a sound midway between a groan and a burst of horrid laughter, rose
  awfully upon the silent night; and it required an effort to man his heart
  against a feeling, which crept through him, nearly akin to fear.</p>

  <p>But with the freedman Thrasea it was a very different matter, for he shook
  so much with absolute terror, that he had well nigh dropped the torch; while,
  drawing nearer to his master's side, with teeth that chattered as if in an
  ague fit, and a face deserted by every particle of color, he besought him in
  faltering accents, "by all the Gods! to turn back instantly, lest evil might
  come of it!"</p>

  <p>His entreaties were, however, of no avail with the brave youth, who in a
  moment had shaken off his transitory terror, and was now resolute, not only
  to proceed on his homeward route, but to investigate the cause and meaning of
  the outcry.</p>

  <p>"Silence!" he said, somewhat sternly, in answer to the reiterated prayers
  of the trembling servitor, "Silence! and follow, idiot! That was no
  superhuman voice&mdash;no yell of nightly lemures, but the death-cry, if I
  err not more widely, of some frail mortal like ourselves. There may be time,
  however, yet to save him, and I so truly marked the quarter whence it rose,
  that I doubt not we may discover him. Advance the light; lo! we are at the
  wall. Lower thy torch now, that I may undo the wicket. Give me thy club and
  keep close at my heels bearing the flambeau high!"</p>

  <p>And with the words he strode out rapidly into the wide desolate expanse of
  the plebeian grave yard. It was a broad bleak space, comprising the whole
  table land and southern slope of the Esquiline hill, broken with many deep
  ravines and gulleys, worn by the wintry rains, covered with deep rank grass
  and stunted bushes, with here and there a grove of towering cypresses, or
  dark funereal yews, casting a deeper shadow over the gloomy solitude. So
  rough and broken was the surface of the ground, so numerous the low mounds
  which alone covered the ashes of the humbler dead, that they were long in
  reaching the vicinity of the spot where that fell deed had been done so
  recently. When they had come, however, to the foot of the descent, where it
  swept gently downward to the boundary wall, the young man took the torch from
  his attendant, and waving it with a slow movement to and fro, surveyed the
  ground with close and narrow scrutiny. He had not moved in this manner above
  a dozen paces, before a bright quick flash seemed to shoot up from the long
  thick herbage as the glare of the torch passed over it. Another step revealed
  the nature and the cause of that brief gleam; a ray had fallen full on the
  polished blade of Cataline's stiletto, which lay, where it had been cast by
  the expiring effort of the victim, hilt downward in the tangled weeds.</p>

  <p>He seized it eagerly, but shuddered, as he beheld the fresh dark gore
  curdling on the broad steel, and clotted round the golden guard of the rich
  weapon.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed, "I am right, Thrasea. Foul murder hath been done here!
  Let us look farther."</p>

  <p>Several minutes now were spent in searching every foot of ground, and
  prying even into the open vaults of several broken graves; for at first they
  had taken a wrong direction in the gloom. Quickly, however, seeing that he
  was in error, Arvina turned upon his traces, and was almost immediately
  successful; for there, scarce twenty feet from the spot where he had found
  the dagger, with his grim gory face turned upward as if reproachfully to the
  dark quiet skies, the black death-sweat still beaded on his frowning brow,
  and a sardonic grin distorting his pale lips, lay the dead slave. Flat on his
  back, with his arms stretched out right and left, his legs extended close
  together to their full length, he lay even as he had fallen; for not a
  struggle had convulsed his limbs after he struck the earth; life having
  actually fled while he yet stood erect, battling with all the energies of
  soul and body against man's latest enemy. The bosom of his gray tunic, rent
  asunder, displayed the deep gash which had let out the spirit, whence the
  last drops of the thick crimson life-blood were ebbing with a slow
  half-stagnant motion.</p>

  <p>On this dread sight Paul was still gazing in that motionless and painful
  silence, with which the boldest cannot fail to look upon the body of a fellow
  creature from which the immortal soul has been reluctantly and forcefully
  expelled, when a loud cry from Thrasea, who, having lagged a step or two
  behind, was later in discovering the corpse, aroused him from his melancholy
  stupor.</p>

  <p>"Alas! alas! ah me!" cried the half-sobbing freedman, "my friend, my more
  than friend, my countryman, my kinsman, Medon!"</p>

  <p>"Ha! dost thou recognize the features? didst thou know him who lies so
  coldly and inanimately here before us?" cried the excited youth, "whose slave
  was he? speak, Thrasea, on thy life! this shall be looked to straightway;
  and, by the Gods! avenged."</p>

  <p>"As I would recognize mine own in the polished brass, as I do know my
  father's sister's son! for such was he, who lies thus foully slaughtered.
  Alas! alas! my countryman! wo! wo! for thee, my Medon! Many a day, alas! many
  a happy day have we two chased the elk and urus by the dark-wooded Danube;
  the same roof covered us; the same board fed; the same fire warmed us; nay!
  the same fatal battle-field robbed both of liberty and country. Yet were the
  great Gods merciful to the poor captives. Thy father did buy me, Arvina, and
  a few years of light and pleasant servitude restored the slave to freedom.
  Medon was purchased by the wise consul, Cicero, and was to have received his
  freedom at the next Saturnalia. Alas! and wo is me, he is now free forever
  from any toils on earth, from any mortal master."</p>

  <p>"Nay! weep not so, my Thrasea," exclaimed the generous youth, laying his
  left hand with a friendly pressure on the freedman's shoulder, "thou shalt
  have all means to do all honor to his name; all that can now be done by
  mortals for the revered and sacred dead. Aid me now to remove the body, lest
  those who slew him may return, and carry off the evidences of their
  crime."</p>

  <p>Thus speaking, he thrust the unlighted end of the torch into the ground,
  and lifting up the shoulders of the carcase, while Thrasea raised the feet,
  bore it away a hundred yards or better, and laying it within the open
  arch-way of an old tomb, covered the mouth with several boughs torn from a
  neighboring cypress.</p>

  <p>Then satisfied that it would thus escape a nearer search than it was
  likely would be made by the murderers, when they should find that it had been
  removed, he walked away very rapidly toward his home.</p>

  <p>Before he left the burial ground, however, he wiped the dagger carefully
  in the long grass, and hid it in the bosom of his tunic.</p>

  <p>No more words were exchanged&mdash;the master buried in deep thought, the
  servant stupified with grief and terror&mdash;until they reached the house of
  Paullus, in a fair quarter of the town, near to the street of Carinae, the
  noblest and most sumptuous in Rome.</p>

  <p>A dozen slaves appeared within the hall, awaiting the return of their
  young lord, but he dismissed them all; and when they had departed, taking a
  small night lamp, and ordering Thrasea to waken him betimes to-morrow, that
  he might see the consul, he bade him be of good cheer, for that Medon's death
  should surely be avenged, since the gay dagger would prove a clue to the
  detection of his slayer. Then, passing into his own chamber, he soon lost all
  recollection of his hopes, joys, cares, in the sound sleep of innocence and
  youth.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch104"
     name="ch104"></a>IV &mdash; THE CONSUL</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>Therefore let him be Consul;<br>
  The Gods give Him joy, and make him good friend to the people.</i><br>
  &mdash;Coriolanus.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE morning was yet young, when Paullus Arvina, leaving his
  mansion on the Caelian hill by a postern door, so to avoid the crowd of
  clients who even at that early hour awaited his forth-coming in the hall,
  descended the gentle hill toward the splendid street called Carinae, from
  some fanciful resemblance in its shape, lying in a curved hollow between the
  bases of the Esquiline, Caelian, and Palatine mounts, to the keel of a
  galley.</p>

  <p>This quarter of the city was at that time unquestionably the most
  beautiful in Rome, although it still fell far short of the magnificence it
  afterward attained, when the favourite Mecaenas had built his splendid
  palace, and laid out his unrivalled gardens, on the now woody Esquiline; and
  it would have been difficult indeed to conceive a view more sublime, than
  that which lay before the eyes of the young patrician, as he paused for a
  moment on the highest terrace of the hill, to inhale the breath of the pure
  autumnal morning.</p>

  <p>The sun already risen, though not yet high in the east, was pouring a
  flood of mellow golden light, through the soft medium of the half misty
  atmosphere, over the varied surface of the great city, broken and diversified
  by many hills and hollows; and bringing out the innumerable columns, arches,
  and aqueducts, that adorned almost every street and square, in beautiful
  relief.</p>

  <p>The point at which the young man stood, looking directly northward, was
  one which could not be excelled, if it indeed could be equalled for the view
  it commanded, embracing nearly the whole of Rome, which from its commanding
  height, inferior only to the capitol, and the Quirinal hill, it was enabled
  to overlook.</p>

  <p>Before him, in the hollow at his feet, on which the morning rays dwelt
  lovingly, streaming in through the deep valley to the right over the city
  walls, lay the long street of the Carinae, the noblest and most sumptuous of
  Rome, adorned with many residences of the patrician order, and among others,
  those of Pompey, Caesar, and the great Latin orator. This broad and noble
  thoroughfare, from its great width, and the long rows of marble columns,
  which decked its palaces, all glittering in the misty sunbeams, shewed like a
  waving line of light among the crowded buildings of the narrower ways, that
  ran parallel to it along the valley and up the easy slope of the Caelian
  mount, with the Minervium, in which Arvina stood, leading directly downward
  to its centre. Beyond this sparkling line, rose the twin summits Oppius and
  Cispius, of the Esquiline hill, still decked with the dark foliage of the
  ancestral groves of oak and sweet-chesnut, said to derive their origin from
  Servius Tullius, the sixth king of Rome, and green with the long grass and
  towering cypresses of the plebeian cemetery, across which the young man had
  come home, from the villa of his lady-love, but a few hours before.</p>

  <p>Beyond the double hill-tops, a heavy purple shadow indicated the deep
  basin through which ran the ill-famed Suburra, and the "Wicked-Street", so
  named from the tradition, that therein Tullia compelled her trembling
  charioteer to lash his reluctant steeds over the yet warm body of her
  murdered father. And beyond this again the lofty ridge of the Quirinal mount
  stood out in fair relief with all its gorgeous load of palaces and columns;
  and the great temple of the city's founder, the god Romulus Quirinus; and the
  stupendous range of walls and turrets, along its northern verge, flashing out
  splendidly to the new-risen sun.</p>

  <p>So lofty was the post from which Paullus gazed, as he overlooked the
  mighty town, that his eye reached even beyond the city-walls on the Quirinal,
  and passing over the broad valley at its northern base, all glimmering with
  uncertain lights and misty shadows, rested upon the Collis Hortulorum, or
  mount of gardens, now called Monte Pincio, which was at that time covered, as
  its name indicates, with rich and fertile shrubberies. The glowing hues of
  these could be distinctly made out, even at this great distance, by the naked
  eye. For it must be remembered that there was in those days no sea-coal to
  send up its murky smoke-wreaths, blurring the bright skies with its inky
  pall; no factories with tall chimnies, vomiting forth, like mimic Etnas,
  their pestilential breath, fatal to vegetable life. Not a cloud hung over the
  great city; and the charcoal, sparingly used for cookery, sent forth no
  visible fumes to shroud the daylight. So that, as the thin purplish haze was
  dispersed by the growing influence of the sunbeams, every line of the far
  architecture, even to the carved friezes of the thousand temples, and the
  rich foliage of the marble capitals could be observed, distinct and sharp as
  in a painted picture.</p>

  <p>Nor was this all the charm of the delicious atmosphere; for so pure was
  it, that the odours of that flowery hill, wafted upon the wings of the light
  northern breeze, blent with the coolness which they caught from the hundreds
  of clear fountains, plashing and glittering in every public place, came to
  the brow of the young noble, more like the breath of some enchanted garden in
  the far-famed Hesperides, than the steam from the abodes of above a million
  of busy mortals.</p>

  <p>Before him still, though inclining a little to the left hand, lay a
  broader hollow, presenting the long vista of the sacred way, leading directly
  to the capitol, and thence to the Campus Martius, the green expanse of which,
  bedecked with many a marble monument and brazen column, and already studded
  with quick moving groups, hurling the disc and javelin, or reining the fierce
  war-horse with strong Gaulish curbs, lay soft and level for half a league in
  length, till it was bounded far away by a gleaming reach of the blue
  Tiber.</p>

  <p>Still to the left of this, uprose the Palatine, the earliest settled of
  the hills of Rome, with the old walls of Romulus, and the low straw-built
  shed, wherein that mighty son of Mars dwelt when he governed his wild
  robber-clan; and the bidental marking the spot where lightning from the
  monarch of Olympus, called on by undue rites, consumed Hostilius and his
  house; were still preserved with reverential worship, and on its eastern
  peak, the time-honoured shrine of Stator Jove.</p>

  <p>The ragged crest of this antique elevation concealed, it is true, from
  sight the immortal space below, once occupied by the marsh of the Velabrum,
  but now filled by the grand basilicae and halls of Justice surrounding the
  great Roman forum, with all their pomp of golden shields, and monuments of
  mighty deeds performed in the earliest ages; but it was far too low to
  intercept the view of the grand Capitol, and the Tarpeian Rock.</p>

  <p>The gilded gates of bronze and the gold-plated roof of the vast national
  temple&mdash;gold-plated at the enormous cost of twenty-one thousand talents,
  the rich spoil of Carthage&mdash;the shrine of Jupiter Capitoline, and Juno,
  and Minerva, sent back the sun-beams in lines too dazzling to be borne by any
  human eye; and all the pomp of statues grouped on the marble terraces, and
  guarding the ascent of the celebrated hundred steps, glittered like forms of
  indurated snow.</p>

  <p>Such was the wondrous spectacle, more like a fairy show than a real scene
  of earthly splendour, to look on which Arvina paused for one moment with
  exulting gladness, before descending toward the mansion of the consul. Nor
  was that mighty panorama wanting in moving crowds, and figures suitable to
  the romantic glory of its scenery.</p>

  <p>Here, through the larger streets, vast herds of cattle were driven in by
  mounted herdsmen, lowing and trampling toward the forum; here a concourse of
  men, clad in the graceful toga, the clients of some noble house, were
  hastening along to salute their patron at his morning levee; there again,
  danced and sang, with saffron colored veils and flowery garlands, a band of
  virgins passing in sacred pomp toward some favourite shrine; there in sad
  order swept along, with mourners and musicians, with women wildly shrieking
  and tearing their long hair, and players and buffoons, and liberated slaves
  wearing the cap of freedom, a funeral procession, bearing the body of some
  <i>young</i> victim, as indicated by the morning hour, to the funereal pile
  beyond the city walls; and far off, filing in, with the spear heads and
  eagles of a cohort glittering above the dust wreaths, by the Flaminian way,
  the train of some ambassador or envoy, sent by submissive monarchs or
  dependent states, to sue the favour and protection of the great Roman
  people.</p>

  <p>The blended sounds swept up, in a confused sonorous murmur, like the sea;
  the shrill cry of the water-carriers, and the wild chant of the choral songs,
  and the keen clangour of the distant trumpets ringing above the din, until
  the ears of the youth, as well as his eyes, were filled with present proofs
  of his native city's grandeur; and his whole soul was lapped in the proud
  conscious joy, arising from the thought that he too was entitled to that
  boastful name, higher than any monarch's style, of Roman citizen.</p>

  <p>"Fairest and noblest city of the universe," cried the enthusiastic boy,
  spreading his arms abroad over the glorious view, which, kindling all the
  powers of his imaginative mind, had awakened something of awe and veneration,
  "long may the everliving gods watch over thee; long may they guard thy
  liberties intact, thy hosts unconquered! long may thy name throughout the
  world be synonymous with all that is great, and good, and glorious! Long may
  the Roman fortune and the Roman virtue tread, side by side, upon the neck of
  tyrants; and the whole universe stand mute and daunted before the presence of
  the sovereign people."</p>

  <p>"The sovereign slaves!" said a deep voice, with a strangely sneering
  accent, in his ear; and as he started in amazement, for he had not imagined
  that any one was near him, Cataline stood at his elbow.</p>

  <p>Under the mingled influence of surprise, and bashfulness at being
  overheard, and something not very far removed from alarm at the unexpected
  presence of one so famed for evil deeds as the man beside him, Arvina
  recoiled a pace or two, and thrust his hand into the bosom of his toga,
  disarranging its folds for a moment, and suffering the eye of the conspirator
  to dwell on the hilt of a weapon, which he recognized instantly as the
  stiletto he had lost in the struggle with the miserable slave on the
  Esquiline.</p>

  <p>No gleam in the eye of the wily plotter betrayed his intelligence; no show
  of emotion was discoverable in his dark paleness; but a grim smile played
  over his lips for a moment, as he noted, not altogether without a sort of
  secret satisfaction, the dismay caused by his unexpected presence.</p>

  <p>"How now," he said jeeringly, before the smile had yet vanished from his
  ill-omened face&mdash;"what aileth the bold Paullus, that he should start,
  like an unruly colt scared by a shadow, from the approach of a friend?"</p>

  <p>"A friend," answered the young man in a half doubtful tone, but instantly
  recovering himself, "Ha! Cataline, I was surprised, and scarce saw who it
  was. Thou art abroad betimes this morning. Whither so early? but what saidst
  thou about slaves?"</p>

  <p>"I thought thou didst not know me," replied the other, "and for the rest,
  I am abroad no earlier than thou, and am perhaps bound to the same place with
  thee!"</p>

  <p>"By Hercules! I fancy not," said Paullus.</p>

  <p>"Wherefore, I pray thee, not? Who knoweth? Perchance I go to pay my vows
  to Jupiter upon the capitol! perchance," he added with a deep sneer, "to
  salute our most eloquent and noble consul!"</p>

  <p>A crimson flush shot instantly across the face and temples of Arvina,
  perceiving that he was tampered with, and sounded only; yet he replied calmly
  and with dignity, "Thither indeed, go I; but I knew not that thou wert in so
  much a friend of Cicero, as to go visit him."</p>

  <p>"Men sometimes visit those who be not their friends," answered the other.
  "I never said he was a friend to me, or I to him. By the gods, no! I had lied
  else."</p>

  <p>"But what was that," asked the youth, moved, by an inexplicable curiosity
  and excitement, to learn something more of the singular being with whom
  chance had brought him into contact, "which thou didst say but now concerning
  slaves?"</p>

  <p>"That all these whom we see before us, and around us, and beneath us, are
  but a herd of slaves; gulled and vainglorious slaves!"</p>

  <p>"The Roman people?" exclaimed Paullus, every tone of his voice, every
  feature of his fine countenance, expressing his unmitigated horror and
  astonishment. "The great, unconquered Roman people; the lords of earth and
  sea, from frosty Caucasus to the twin rocks of Hercules; the tramplers on the
  necks of kings; the arbiters of the whole world! The Roman people,
  slaves?"</p>

  <p>"Most abject and most wretched!"</p>

  <p>"To whom then?" cried the young man, much excited, "to whom am I, art
  thou, a slave? For we are also of the Roman people?"</p>

  <p>"The Roman people, and thou, as one of them, and I, Paullus Caecilius, are
  slaves one and all; abject and base and spirit-fallen slaves, lacking the
  courage even to spurn against our fetters, to the proud tyrannous rich
  aristocracy."</p>

  <p>"By the Gods! we are of it."</p>

  <p>"But not the less, for that, slaves to it!" answered Cataline! "See! from
  the lowest to the highest, each petty pelting officer lords it above the next
  below him; and if the tribunes for a while, at rare and singular moments,
  uplift a warning cry against the corrupt insolence of the patrician houses,
  gold buys them back into vile treasonable silence! Patricians be we, and not
  slaves, sayest thou? Come tell me then, did the patrician blood of the grand
  Gracchi preserve them from a shameful doom, because they dared to speak, as
  free-born men, aloud and freely? Did his patrician blood save Fulvius
  Flaccus? Were Publius Antonius, and Cornelius Sylla, the less ejected from
  their offices, that they were of the highest blood in Rome; the lawful
  consuls by the suffrage of the people? Was I, the heir of Sergius Silo's
  glory, the less forbidden even to canvass for the consulship, that my great
  grandsire's blood was poured out, like water, upon those fields that
  witnessed Rome's extremest peril, Trebia, and the Ticinus, and Thrasymene and
  Cannae? Was Lentulus, the noblest of the noble, patrician of the eldest
  houses, a consular himself, expelled the less and stricken from the rolls of
  the degenerate senate, for the mere whining of a mawkish wench, because his
  name is Cornelius? Tush, Tush! these be but dreams of poets, or imaginings of
  children!&mdash;the commons be but slaves to the nobles; the nobles to the
  senate; the senate to their creditors, their purchasers, their consuls; the
  last at once their tools, and their tyrants! Go, young man, go. Salute,
  cringe, fawn upon your consul! Nathless, for thou hast mind enough to mark
  and note the truth of what I tell thee; thou wilt think upon this, and
  perchance one day, when the time shall have come, wilt speak, act, strike,
  for freedom!"</p>

  <p>And as he finished speaking, he turned aside with a haughty gesture of
  farewell; and wrapping his toga closely about his tall person, stalked away
  slowly in the direction neither of the capitol nor of the consul's house;
  turning his head neither to the right hand nor to the left; and taking no
  more notice of the person to whom he had been speaking, than if he had not
  known him to be there, and gazing toward him half-bewildered in anxiety and
  wonder!</p>

  <p>"Wonderful! by the Gods!" he said at last. "Truly he is a wonderful man,
  and wise withal! I fain would know if all that be true, which they say of
  him&mdash;his bitterness, his impiety, his blood-thirstiness! By Hercules! he
  speaks well! and it is <i>true</i> likewise. Yea! true it is, that we,
  patricians, and free, as we style ourselves, may not speak any thing, or act,
  against our order; no! nor indulge our private pleasures, for fear of the
  proud censors! Is this, then, freedom? True, we are lords abroad; our fleets,
  our hosts, everywhere victorious; and not one land, wherein the eagle has
  unfurled her pinion, but bows before the majesty of Rome&mdash;but
  yet&mdash;is it, is it, indeed, true, that we are but slaves, sovereign
  slaves, at home?"</p>

  <p>The whole tenor of the young man's thoughts was altered by the few words,
  let fall for that very purpose by the arch traitor. Ever espying whom he
  might attach to his party by operating on his passions, his prejudices, his
  weakness, or his pride; a most sagacious judge of human nature, reading the
  character of every man as it were in a written book, Cataline had long before
  remarked young Arvina. He had noted several points of his mental
  constitution, which he considered liable to receive such impressions as he
  would&mdash;his proneness to defer to the thoughts of others, his want of
  energetic resolution, and not least his generous indignation against every
  thing that savored of cruelty or oppression. He had resolved to operate on
  these, whenever he might find occasion; and should he meet success in his
  first efforts, to stimulate his passions, minister to his voluptuous
  pleasures, corrupt his heart, and make him in the end, body and soul, his
  own.</p>

  <p>Such were the intentions of the conspirator, when he first addressed
  Paullus. His desire to increase the strength of his party, to whom the
  accession of any member however humble of the great house of Caecilii could
  not fail to be useful, alone prompting him in the first instance. But, when
  he saw by the young man's startled aspect that he was prepossessed against
  him, and had listened probably to the damning rumors which were rife
  everywhere concerning him, a second motive was added, in his pride of
  seduction and sophistry, by which he was wont to boast, that he could
  bewilder the strongest minds, and work them to his will. When by the
  accidental disarrangement of Arvina's gown, and the discovery of his own
  dagger, he perceived that the intended victim of his specious arts was
  probably cognizant in some degree of his last night's crime, a third and
  stronger cause was added, in the instinct of self-preservation. And as soon
  as he found out that Paullus was bound for the house of Cicero, he considered
  his life, in some sort, staked upon the issue of his attempt on Arvina's
  principles.</p>

  <p>No part could have been played with more skill, or with greater knowledge
  of his character whom he addressed. He said just enough to set him thinking,
  and to give a bias and a colour to his thoughts, without giving him reason to
  suspect that he had any interest in the matter; and he had withdrawn himself
  in that careless and half contemptuous manner, which naturally led the young
  man to wish for a renewal of the subject.</p>

  <p>And in fact Paul, while walking down the hill, toward the house of the
  Consul, was busied in wondering why Cataline had left so much unsaid,
  departing so abruptly; and in debating with himself upon the strange
  doctrines which he had then for the first time heard broached.</p>

  <p>It was about the second hour of the Roman day, corresponding nearly to
  eight o'clock before noon&mdash;as the winter solstice was now
  passed&mdash;when Arvina reached the magnificent dwelling of the Consul in
  the Carinae at the angle of the Caerolian place, hard by the foot of the
  Sacred Way.</p>

  <p>This splendid building occupied a whole <i>insula</i>, as it was called,
  or space between four streets, intersecting each other at right angles; and
  was three stories in height, the two upper supported by columns of marble,
  with a long range of glass windows, at that period an unusual and expensive
  luxury. The doors stood wide open; and on either hand the vestibule were
  arranged the lictors leaning upon their fasces, while the whole space of the
  great Corinthian hall within, lighted from above, and adorned with vast black
  pillars of Lucullean marble, was crowded with the white robes of the consul's
  plebeian clients tendering their morning salutations; not unmixed with the
  crimson fringes and broad crimson facings of senatorial visitors.</p>

  <p>Many were there with gifts of all kinds; countrymen from his Sabine farm
  and his Tusculan retreat, some bringing lambs; some cages full of doves;
  cheeses, and bowls of fragrant honey; and robes of fine white linen the
  produce of their daughters' looms; for whom perchance they were seeking
  dowers at the munificence of their noble patron; artizans of the city, with
  toys or pieces of furniture, lamps, writing cases, cups or vases of rich
  workmanship; courtiers with manuscripts rarely illuminated, the work of their
  most valuable slaves; travellers with gems, and bronzes, offerings known to
  be esteemed beyond all others by the high-minded lover of the arts, and
  unrivalled scholar, to whom they were presented.</p>

  <p>These presents, after being duly exhibited to the patron himself, who was
  seated at the farther end of the hall, concealed from the eyes of Paullus by
  the intervening crowd, were consigned to the care of the various slaves, or
  freedmen, who stood round their master, and borne away according to their
  nature, to the storerooms and offices, or to the library and gallery of the
  consul; while kind words and a courteous greeting, and a consideration most
  ample and attentive even of the smallest matters brought before him, awaited
  all who approached the orator; whether he came empty handed, or full of
  gifts, to require an audience.</p>

  <p>After a little while, Arvina penetrated far enough through the crowd to
  command a view of the consul's seat; and for a time he amused himself by
  watching his movements and manner toward each of his visitors, perhaps not
  altogether without reference to the conversation he had recently held with
  Catiline; and certainly not without a desire to observe if the tales he had
  heard of shameless bribery and corruption, as practiced by many of the great
  officers of the republic, had any confirmation in the conduct of Cicero.</p>

  <p>But he soon saw that the courtesies of that great and virtuous man were
  regulated neither by the value of the gifts offered, nor by the rank of the
  visitors; and that his personal predilections even were not allowed to
  interfere with the division of his time among all worthy of his notice.</p>

  <p>Thus he remarked that a young noble, famed for his dissoluteness and evil
  courses, although he brought an exquisite sculpture of Praxiteles, was
  received with the most marked and formal coldness, and his gift, which could
  not be declined, consigned almost without eliciting a glance of approbation,
  to the hand of a freedman; while, the next moment, as an old white-headed
  countryman, plainly and almost meanly clad, although with scrupulous
  cleanliness, approached his presence, the consul rose to meet him; and
  advancing a step or two took him affectionately by the hand, and asked after
  his family by name, and listened with profound consideration to the garrulous
  narrative of the good farmer, who, involved in some petty litigation, had
  come to seek the advice of his patron; until he sent him away happy and
  satisfied with the promise of his protection.</p>

  <p>By and by his own turn arrived; and, although he was personally unknown to
  the orator, and the assistance of the nomenclator, who stood behind the
  curule chair, was required before he was addressed by name, he was received
  with the utmost attention; the noble house to which the young man belonged
  being as famous for its devotion to the common weal, as for the ability and
  virtue of its sons.</p>

  <p>After a few words of ordinary compliment, Paullus proceeded to intimate to
  his attentive hearer that his object in waiting at his levee that morning was
  to communicate momentous information. The thoughtful eye of the great orator
  brightened, and a keen animated expression came over the features, which had
  before worn an air almost of lassitude; and he asked eagerly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Momentous to the Republic&mdash;to Rome, my good friend?"&mdash;for all
  his mind was bent on discovering the plots, which he suspected even now to be
  in process against the state.</p>

  <p>"Momentous to yourself, Consul," answered Arvina.</p>

  <p>"Then will it wait," returned the other, with a slight look of
  disappointment, "and I will pray you to remain, until I have spoken with all
  my friends here. It will not be very long, for I have seen nearly all the
  known faces. If you are, in the mean time, addicted to the humane arts, Davus
  here will conduct you to my library, where you shall find food for the mind;
  or if you have not breakfasted, my Syrian will shew you where some of my
  youthful friends are even now partaking a slight meal."</p>

  <p>Accepting the first offer, partly perhaps from a sort of pardonable
  hypocrisy, desiring to make a favourable impression on the great man, with
  whom he had for the first time spoken, Arvina followed the intelligent and
  civil freedman to the library, which was indeed the favourite apartment of
  the studious magistrate. And, if he half repented, as he went by the chamber
  wherein several youths of patrician birth, one or two of whom nodded to him
  as he passed, were assembled, conversing merrily and jesting around a well
  spread board, he ceased immediately to regret the choice he had made, when
  the door was thrown open, and he was ushered into the shrine of Cicero's
  literary leisure.</p>

  <p>The library was a small square apartment; for it must be remembered that
  books at this time being multiplied by manual labor only, and the art being
  comparatively rare and very costly, the vast collections of modern times were
  utterly beyond the reach of individuals; and a few scores of volumes were
  more esteemed than would be as many thousands now, in these days of
  multiplying presses and steam power. But although inconsiderable in size, not
  being above sixteen feet square, the decorations of the apartment were not to
  be surpassed or indeed equalled by anything of modern splendor; for the
  walls,(4) divided into compartments by mouldings, exquisitely carved and
  overlaid with burnished gilding, were set with panels of thick plate glass
  glowing in all the richest hues of purple, ruby, emerald, and azure, through
  several squares of which the light stole in, gorgeously tinted, from the
  peristyle, there being no distinction except in this between the windows and
  the other compartments of the wainscot, if it may be so styled; and of the
  ceiling, which was finished in like manner with slabs of stained glass,
  between the intersecting beams of gilded scroll work.</p>

  <p class="footnote">4. It must not be imagined that this is fanciful. Rooms
  were fitted up in this manner, and termed <i>camera vitrae</i>, and the
  panels <i>vitrae quadraturae</i>. But a few years later than the period of
  the text, B. C. 58, M. AEmilius Scaurus built a theatre capable of containing
  80,000 persons, the scena of which, composed of three stories, had one, the
  central, made entirely of colored glass in this fashion.</p>

  <p>The floor was of beautiful mosaic, partially covered by a foot-cloth woven
  from the finest wool, and dyed purple with the juice of the cuttle-fish; and
  all the furniture corresponded, both in taste and magnificence, to the other
  decorations of the room. A circular table of cedar wood, inlaid with ivory
  and brass, so that its value could not have fallen far short of ten thousand
  sesterces(5), stood in the centre of the floor-cloth; with a
  <i>bisellium</i>, or double settle, wrought in bronze, and two beautiful
  chairs of the same material not much dissimilar in form to those now used.
  And, to conclude, a bookcase of polished maple wood, one of the doors of
  which stood open, displayed a rare collection of about three hundred volumes,
  each in its circular case of purple parchment, having the name inscribed in
  letters of gold, silver, or vermilion.</p>

  <p class="footnote">5. About 90 sterling. See Pliny Hist. Nat. 13, 16, for a
  notice of this very table, which was preserved to his time.</p>

  <p>A noble bust in bronze of the Phidian Jupiter, with the sublime expanse of
  brow, the ambrosian curls and the beard loosely waving, as when he shook
  Olympus by his nod, and the earth trembled and the depth of Tartarus, stood
  on a marble pedestal facing the bookcase; and on the table, beside writing
  materials, leaves of parchment, an ornamental letter-case, a double inkstand
  and several reed pens, were scattered many gems and trinkets; signets and
  rings engraved in a style far surpassing any effort of the modern graver,
  vases of onyx and cut glass, and above all, the statue of a beautiful boy,
  holding a lamp of bronze suspended by a chain from his left hand, and in his
  right the needle used to refresh the wick.</p>

  <p>Nurtured as he had been from his youth upward among the magnates of the
  land, accustomed to magnificence and luxury till he had almost fancied that
  the world had nothing left of beautiful or new that he had not witnessed,
  Paul stood awhile, after the freedman had departed, gazing with mute
  admiration on the richness and taste displayed in all the details of this the
  scholar's sanctum. The very atmosphere of the chamber, filled with the
  perfume of the cedar wood employed as a specific against the ravages of the
  moth and bookworm, seemed to the young man redolent of midnight learning; and
  the superb front of the presiding god, calm in the grandeur of its ineffable
  benignity, who appeared to his excited fancy to smile serene protection on
  the pursuits of the blameless consul, inspired him with a sense of awful
  veneration, that did not easily or quickly pass away.</p>

  <p>For some moments, as he gradually recovered the elasticity of his spirits,
  he amused himself by examining the exquisitely wrought gems on the table; but
  after a little while, when Cicero came not, he crossed the room quietly to
  the bookshelves, and selecting a volume of Homer, drew it forth from its
  richly embossed case, and seating himself on the bronze settle with his back
  toward the door, had soon forgotten where he was, and the grave business
  which brought him thither, in the sublime simplicity of the blind
  rhapsodist.</p>

  <p>An hour or more elapsed thus; yet Paul took no note of time, nor moved at
  all except to unroll with his right hand the lower margin of the parchment as
  he read, while with the left he rolled up the top; so that nearly the same
  space of the manuscript remained constantly before his eyes, although the
  reader was continually advancing in the poem.</p>

  <p>At length the door opened noiselessly, and with a silent foot, shod in the
  light slippers which the Romans always wore when in the house, Cicero entered
  the apartment.</p>

  <p>The consul was at this time in the very prime of intellectual manhood, it
  having been decreed(6) about a century before, that no person should be
  elected to that highest office of the state, who should not have attained his
  forty-third year. He was a tall and elegantly formed man, with nothing
  especially worthy of remark in his figure, if it were not that his neck was
  unusually long and slender, though not so much so as to constitute any
  drawback to his personal appearance, which, without being what would exactly
  be termed handsome, was both elegant and graceful. His features were not,
  indeed, very bold or striking; but intellect was strongly and singularly
  marked in every line of the face; and the expression,&mdash;calm, thoughtful,
  and serene,&mdash;though it had not the quick and restless play of
  ever-varying lights and shadows which belongs to the quicker and more
  imaginative temperaments among men of the highest genius,&mdash;could not
  fail to impress any one with the conviction, that the mind which informed it
  must be of eminent capacity, and depth, and power.</p>

  <p class="footnote">6. By the <i>Lex annalis</i>, B. C. 180, passed at the
  instance of the tribune L. V. Tappulus.</p>

  <p>He entered, as I have said, silently; and although there was nothing of
  stealthiness in his gait, which being very light and slow was yet both firm
  and springy, nor any of that cunning in his manner which is so often coupled
  to a prowling footstep, he yet advanced so noiselessly over the soft
  floor-cloth, that he stood at Arvina's elbow, and overlooked the page in
  which he was reading, before the young man was aware of his vicinity.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed, after standing a moment, and observing with a soft
  pleasant smile the abstraction of his visitor, "so thou readest Greek, and
  art thyself a poet."</p>

  <p>"A little of the first, my consul," replied Arvina, arising quickly to his
  feet, with the ingenuous blood rushing to his brow at the detection. "But
  wherefore shouldst thou believe me the second?"</p>

  <p>"We statesmen," answered the consul, "are wont to study other men's
  characters, as other men are wont to study books; and I have learned by
  practice to draw quick conclusions from small signs. But in this instance,
  the light in your eye, the curl of your expanded nostril, the half frown on
  your brow, and the flush on your cheek, told me beyond a doubt that you are a
  poet. And you are so, young man. I care not whether you have penned as yet an
  elegy, or no&mdash;nevertheless, you are in soul, in temperament, in fantasy,
  a poet. Do you love Homer?"</p>

  <p>"Beyond all other writers I have ever met, in my small course of reading.
  There is a majesty, a truth, an ever-burning fire, lustrous, yet natural and
  most beneficent, like the sun's glory on a summer day, in his immortal words,
  that kindles and irradiates, yet consumes not the soul; a grand simplicity,
  that never strains for effect; a sweet pathos, that elicits tears without
  evoking them; a melody that flows on, like the harmony of the eternal sea,
  or, if we may call fancy to our aid, the music of the spheres, telling us
  that like these the blind bard sang, because song was his nature&mdash;was
  within, and must out&mdash;not bound by laws, or measured by pedantic rules,
  but free, unfettered, and spontaneous as the billows, which in its wild and
  many-cadenced sweep it most resembles."</p>

  <p>"Ah! said I not," replied Cicero, "that you were a poet? And you have been
  discoursing me most eloquent poetry; though not attuned to metre, rythmical
  withal, and full of fancy. Ay! and you judge aright. He is the greatest, as
  the first of poets; and surpassed all his followers as much in the knowledge
  of the human heart with its ten thousands of conflicting passions, as in the
  structure of the kingly verse, wherein he delineated character as never man
  did, saving only he. But hold, Arvina. Though I could willingly spend hours
  with thee in converse on this topic, the state has calls on me, which must be
  obeyed. Tell me, therefore, I pray you, as shortly as may be, what is the
  matter you would have me know. Shortly, I pray you, for my time is short, and
  my duties onerous and manifold."</p>

  <p>Laying aside the roll, which he had still held open during that brief
  conversation, and laying aside with it his enthusiastic and passionate
  manner, the young man now stated, simply and briefly, the events of the past
  night, the discovery of the murdered slave, and the accident by which he had
  learned that he was the consul's property; and in conclusion, laid the
  magnificently ornamented dagger which he had found, on the board before
  Cicero; observing, that the weapon might give a clue to poor Medon's
  death.</p>

  <p>Cicero was moved deeply&mdash;moved, not simply, as Arvina fancied, by
  sorrow for the dead, but by something approaching nearly to remorse. He
  started up from the chair, which he had taken when the youth began his tale,
  and clasping his hands together violently, strode rapidly to and fro the
  small apartment.</p>

  <p>"Alas, and wo is me, poor Medon! Faithful wert thou, and true, and very
  pleasant to mine eyes! Alas! that thou art gone, and gone too so wretchedly!
  And wo is me, that I listened not to my own apprehensions, rather than to thy
  trusty boldness. Alas! that I suffered thee to go, for they have murdered
  thee! ay, thine own zeal betrayed thee; but by the Gods that govern in
  Olympus, they shall rue it!"</p>

  <p>After this burst of passion he became more cool, and, resuming his seat,
  asked Paullus a few shrewd and pertinent questions concerning the nature of
  the ground whereon he had found the corpse, the traces left by the mortal
  struggle, the hour at which the discovery was made, and many other minute
  points of the same nature; the answers to which he noted carefully on his
  waxed tablets. When he had made all the inquiries that occurred to him, he
  read aloud the answers as he had set them down, and asked if he would be
  willing at any moment to attest the truth of those things.</p>

  <p>"At any moment, and most willingly, my consul," the youth replied. "I
  would do much myself to find out the murderers and bring them to justice,
  were it only for my poor freedman Thrasea's sake, who is his
  cousin-german."</p>

  <p>"Fear not, young man, they <i>shall</i> be brought to justice," answered
  Cicero. "In the meantime do thou keep silence, nor say one word touching this
  to any one that lives. Carry the dagger with thee; wear it as ostentatiously
  as may be&mdash;perchance it shall turn out that some one may claim or
  recognise it. Whatever happeneth, let me know privately. Thus far hast thou
  done well, and very wisely: go on as thou hast commenced, and, hap what hap,
  count Cicero thy friend. But above all, doubt not&mdash;I say, doubt not one
  moment,&mdash;that as there is One eye that seeth all things in all places,
  that slumbereth not by day nor sleepeth in the watches of night, that never
  waxeth weak at any time or weary&mdash;as there is One hand against which no
  panoply can arm the guilty, from which no distance can protect, nor space of
  time secure him, so surely shall they perish miserable who did this miserable
  murder, and their souls rue it everlastingly beyond the portals of the grave,
  which are but the portals of eternal life, and admit all men to wo or bliss,
  for ever and for ever!"</p>

  <p>He spoke solemnly and sadly; and on his earnest face there was a deep and
  almost awful expression, that held Arvina mute and abashed, he knew not
  wherefore; and when the great man had ceased from speaking, he made a silent
  gesture of salutation and withdrew, thus gravely warned, scarce conscious if
  the statesman noted his departure; for he had fallen into a deep reverie, and
  was perhaps musing on the mysteries yet unrevealed of the immortal soul, so
  totally careless did he now appear of all sublunary matters.</p>

  <p class="first">"WHAT ! my noble Paullus," exclaimed a loud and cheerful
  voice, "whither afoot so early, and with so grave a face?"</p>

  <p>Arvina started; for so deep was the impression made on his mind by the
  last words of Cicero, that he had passed out into the Sacred Way, and walked
  some distance down it, toward the Forum, in deep meditation, from which he
  was aroused by the clear accents of the merry speaker.</p>

  <p>Looking up with a smile as he recognised the voice, he saw two young men
  of senatorial rank&mdash;for both wore the crimson laticlave on the breast of
  their tunics&mdash;on horseback, followed by several slaves on foot, who had
  overtaken him unnoticed amid the din and bustle which had drowned the clang
  of their horses' feet on the pavement.</p>

  <p>"Nay, I scarce know, Aurelius!" replied the young man, laughing; "I
  thought I was going home, but it seems that my back is turned to my own
  house, and I am going toward the market-place, although the Gods know that I
  have no business with the brawling lawyers, with whom it is alive by this
  time."</p>

  <p>"Come with us, then," replied the other; "Aristius, here, and I, have made
  a bet upon our coursers' speed. He fancies his Numidian can outrun my Gallic
  beauty. Come with us to the Campus; and after we have settled this grave
  matter, we will try the <i>quinquertium</i>,(7) or a foot race in armor, if
  you like it better, or a swim in the Tiber, until it shall be time to go to
  dinner."</p>

  <p class="footnote">7. The <i>Quinquertium</i>, the same as the Greek
  Pentathlon, was a conflict in five successive exercises&mdash;leaping, the
  discus, the foot race, throwing the spear, and wrestling.</p>

  <p>"How can I go with you, seeing that you are well mounted, and I afoot, and
  encumbered with my gown? You must consider me a second Achilles to keep up
  with your fleet coursers, clad in this heavy toga, which is a worse garb for
  running than any panoply that Vulcan ever wrought."</p>

  <p>"We will alight," cried the other youth, who had not yet spoken, "and give
  our horses to the boys to lead behind us; or, hark you, why not send Geta
  back to your house, and let your slaves bring down your horse too? If they
  make tolerable speed, coming down by the back of the Coelian, and thence
  beside the <i>Aqua Crabra</i>(8) to the Carmental gate, they may overtake us
  easily before we reach the Campus. Aurelius has some errand to perform near
  the Forum, which will detain us a few moments longer. What say you?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">8. The <i>Aqua Crabra</i> was a small stream flowing into
  the Tiber from the south-eastward, now called <i>Maranna</i>. It entered the
  walls near the Capuan gate, and passing through the <i>vallis Murcia</i>
  between the Aventine and Palatine hills, where it supplied the Circus Maximus
  with water for the <i>naumachia</i>, fell into the river above the Palatine
  bridge.</p>

  <p>"He will come, he will come, certainly," cried the other, springing down
  lightly from the back of his beautiful courser, which indeed merited the
  eulogium, as well as the caresses which he now lavished on it, patting his
  favorite's high-arched neck, and stroking the soft velvet muzzle, which was
  thrust into his hand, with a low whinnying neigh of recognition, as he stood
  on the raised foot path, holding the embroidered rein carelessly in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"I will," said Arvina, "gladly; I have nothing to hinder me this morning;
  and for some days past I have been detained with business, so that I have not
  visited the campus, or backed a horse, or cast a javelin&mdash;by Hercules!
  not since the Ides, I fancy. You will all beat me in the field, that is
  certain, and in the river likewise. But come, Fuscus Aristius, if it is to be
  as you have planned it, jump down from your Numidian, and let your Geta ride
  him up the hill to my house. I would have asked Aurelius, but he will let no
  slave back his white NOTUS."</p>

  <p>"Not I, by the twin horsemen! nor any free man either&mdash;plebeian,
  knight, or noble. Since first I bought him of the blue-eyed Celt, who wept in
  his barbarian fondness for the colt, no leg save only mine has crossed his
  back, nor ever shall, while the light of day smiles on Aurelius Victor."</p>

  <p>Without a word Fuscus leaped from the back of the fine blood-bay barb he
  bestrode, and beckoning to a confidential slave who followed him, "Here," he
  said, "Geta, take Nanthus, and ride straightway up the Minervium to the house
  of Arvina; thou knowest it, beside the Alban Mansions, and do as he shall
  command you. Tell him, my Paullus."</p>

  <p>"Carry this signet, my good Geta," said the young man, drawing off the
  large seal-ring which adorned his right hand, and giving it to him, "to
  Thrasea, my trusty freedman, and let him see that they put the housings and
  gallic wolf-bit on the black horse Aufidus, and bring him thou, with one of
  my slaves, down the slope of Scaurus, and past the Great Circus, to the
  Carmental Gate, where thou wilt find us. Make good speed, Geta."</p>

  <p>"Ay, do so," interposed his master, "but see that thou dost not blow
  Nanthus; thou wert better be a dead slave, Geta, than let me find one drop of
  sweat on his flank. Nay! never grin, thou hang-dog, or I will have thee given
  to my Congers(9); the last which came out of the fish pond were but ill fed;
  and a fat German, such as thou, would be a rare meal for them."</p>

  <p class="footnote">9. The <i>Muraena Helena</i>, which we commonly translate
  Lamprey, was a sub-genus of the Conger; it was the most prized of all the
  Roman fish, and grew to the weight of twenty-five or thirty pounds. The value
  set upon them was enormous; and it is said that guilty slaves were
  occasionally thrown into their stews, to fatten these voracious dainties.</p>

  <p>The slave laughed, knowing well that his master was but jesting, mounted
  the horse, and rode him at a gentle trot, up the slope of the Caelian hill,
  from which Arvina had but a little while before descended. In the mean time,
  Aristius gave the rein of his dappled grey to one of his followers, desiring
  him to be very gentle with him, and the three young men sauntered slowly on
  along the Sacred Way toward the Forum, conversing merrily and interchanging
  many a smile and salutation with those whom they met on their road.</p>

  <p>Skirting the base of the Palatine hill, they passed the old circular
  temple of Remus to the right hand, and the most venerable relic of Rome's
  infancy, the Ruminal Fig tree, beneath which the she-wolf was believed to
  have given suck to the twin progeny of Mars and the hapless Ilia. A little
  farther on, the mouth of the sacred grotto called Lupercal, surrounded with
  its shadowy grove, the favourite haunt of Pan, lay to their left; and
  fronting them, the splendid arch of Fabius, surnamed Allobrox for his
  victorious prowess against that savage tribe, gave entrance to the great
  Roman Forum.</p>

  <p>Immediately at their left hand as they entered the archway, was the superb
  Comitium, wherein the Senate were wont to give audience to foreign embassies
  of suppliant nations, with the gigantic portico, three columns of which may
  still be seen to testify to the splendor of the old city, in the far days of
  the republic. Facing them were the steps of the Asylum, with the Mamertine
  prison and the grand faade of the temple of Concord to the right and left;
  and higher above these the portico of the gallery of records, and higher yet
  the temple of the thundering Jupiter, and glittering above all, against the
  dark blue sky, the golden dome, and white marble columns of the great capitol
  itself. Around in all directions were basilicae, or halls of justice;
  porticoes filled with busy lawyers; bankers' shops glittering with their
  splendid wares, and bedecked with the golden shields taken from the Samnites;
  statues of the renowned of ages, Accius Naevius, who cut the whetstone with
  the razor; Horatius Cocles on his thunderstricken pedestal, halting on one
  knee from the wound which had not hindered him from swimming the swollen
  Tiber; Claelia the hostage on her brazen steed; and many another, handed down
  inviolate from the days of the ancient kings. Here was the rostrum, beaked
  with the prows of ships, a fluent orator already haranguing the assembled
  people from its platform&mdash;there, the seat of the city Praetor, better
  known as the <i>Puteal Libonis</i>, with that officer in session on his
  curule chair, his six lictors leaning on their fasces at his back, as he
  promulgated his irrevocable edicts.</p>

  <p>It was a grand sight, surely, and one to gaze on which men of the present
  day would do and suffer much; and judge themselves most happy if blessed with
  one momentary glance of the heart, as it were, of the old world's mistress.
  But these young men, proud as they were, and boastful of the glories of their
  native Rome, had looked too often on that busy scene to be attracted by the
  gorgeousness of the place, crowded with buildings, the like of which the
  modern world knows not, and thronged with nations of every region of the
  earth, each in his proper dress, each seeking justice, pleasure, profit,
  fame, as it pleased him, free, and fearless, and secure of property and
  person. Casting a brief glance over it, they turned short to the left, by a
  branch of the Sacred Way, which led, skirting the market place, between the
  Comitium, or hall of the ambassadors, and the abrupt declivity of the
  Palatine, past the end of the Atrium of Liberty, and the cattle mart, toward
  the Carmental gate.</p>

  <p>"Methought you said, my Fuscus, that our Aurelius had some errand to
  perform in the Forum; how is this, is it a secret?" inquired Paullus,
  laughing.</p>

  <p>"No secret, by the Gods!" said Aurelius, "it is but to buy a pair of spurs
  in Volero's shop, hard by Vesta's shrine."</p>

  <p>"He will need them," cried Fuscus, "he will need them, I will swear, in
  the race."</p>

  <p>"Not to beat Nanthus," said Aurelius; "but oh! Jove! walk quickly, I
  beseech you; how hot a steam of cooked meats and sodden cabbage, reeks from
  the door of yon cook-shop. Now, by the Gods! it well nigh sickened me! Ha!
  Volero," he exclaimed, as they reached the door of a booth, or little shop,
  with neat leathern curtains festooned up in front, glittering with polished
  cutlery and wares of steel and silver, to a middle aged man, who was busy
  burnishing a knife within, "what ho! my Volero, some spurs&mdash;I want some
  spurs; show me some of your sharpest and brightest."</p>

  <p>"I have a pair, noble Aurelius, which I got only yesterday in trade with a
  turbaned Moor from the deserts beyond Cyrenaica. By Mulciber, my patron god!
  the fairest pair my eyes ever looked upon. Right loath was the swart
  barbarian to let me have them, but hunger, hunger is a great tamer of your
  savage; and the steam of good Furbo's cook-shop yonder was suggestive of
  savory chops and greasy sausages&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;in short,
  Aurelius, I got them at a bargain."</p>

  <p>While he was speaking, he produced the articles in question, from a strong
  brass-bound chest, and rubbing them on his leather apron held them up for the
  inspection of the youthful noble.</p>

  <p>"Truly," cried Victor, catching them out of his hand, "truly, they are
  good spurs."</p>

  <p>"Good spurs! good spurs!" cried the merchant, half indignantly, "I call
  them splendid, glorious, inimitable! Only look you here, it is all virgin
  silver; and observe, I beseech you, this dragon's neck and the sibilant head
  that holds the rowels; they are wrought to the very life with horrent scales,
  and erected crest; beautiful! beautiful!&mdash;and the rowels too of the best
  Spanish steel that was ever tempered in the cold Bilbilis. Good spurs indeed!
  they are well worth three <i>aurei</i>.(10) But I will keep them, as I meant
  to do at first, for Caius Caesar; he will know what they are worth, and give
  it too."</p>

  <p class="footnote">10. The aureus was a gold coin, as the name implies,
  worth twenty-five denarii, or about seventeen shillings and nine pence
  sterling.</p>

  <p>"Didst ever hear so pestilent a knave?" said Victor, laughing; "one would
  suppose I had disparaged the accursed things! But, as I said before, they are
  good spurs, and I will have them; but I will not give thee three aurei,
  master Volero; two is enough, in all conscience; or sixty denarii at the
  most. Ho! Davus, Davus! bring my purse, hither, Davus," he called to his
  slaves without; and, as the purse-bearer entered, he continued without
  waiting for an answer, "Give Volero two aurei, and ten denarii, and take
  these spurs."</p>

  <p>"No! no!" exclaimed Volero, "you shall not&mdash;no! by the Gods! they
  cost me more than that!"</p>

  <p>"Ye Gods! what a lie! cost thee&mdash;and to a barbarian! I dare be sworn
  thou didst not pay him the ten denarii alone."</p>

  <p>"By Hercules! I did, though," said the other, "and thou shouldst not have
  them for three <i>aurei</i> either, but that it is drawing near the Calends
  of November, and I have moneys to pay then."</p>

  <p>"Sixty-five I will give thee&mdash;sixty-five denarii!"</p>

  <p>"Give me my spurs; what, art thou turning miser in thy youth,
  Aurelius?"</p>

  <p>"There, give him the gold, Davus; he is a regular usurer. Give him three
  <i>aurei</i>, and then buckle these to my heel. Ha! that is well, my Paullus,
  here come your fellows with black Aufidus, and our friend Geta on the
  Numidian. They have made haste, yet not sweated Nanthus either. Aristius,
  your groom is a good one; I never saw a horse that shewed his keeping or
  condition better. Now then, Arvina, doff your toga, you will not surely ride
  in that."</p>

  <p>"Indeed I will not," replied Paullus, "if master Volero will suffer me to
  leave it here till my return."</p>

  <p>"Willingly, willingly; but what is this?" exclaimed the cutler, as Arvina
  unbuckling his toga and suffering it to drop on the ground, stood clad in his
  succinct and snow-white tunic only, girded about him with a zone of purple
  leather, in which was stuck the sheathless dirk of Cataline. "What is this,
  noble Paullus? that you carry at your belt, with no scabbard? If you go
  armed, you should at least go safely. See, if you were to bend your body
  somewhat quickly, it might well be that the keen point would rend your groin.
  Give it me, I can fit it with a sheath in a moment."</p>

  <p>"I do not know but it were as well to do so," answered Paullus,
  extricating the dagger from his belt, "if you will not detain us a long
  time."</p>

  <p>"Not even a short time!" said the cutler, "give it to me, I can fit it
  immediately." And he stretched out his hand and took it; but hardly had his
  eye dwelt on it, for a moment, when he cried, "but this is not
  yours&mdash;this is&mdash;where got you this, Arvina?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, it is nought to thee; perhaps I bought it, perhaps it was given to
  me; do thou only fit it with a scabbard."</p>

  <p>"Buy it thou didst not, Paullus, I'll be sworn; and I think it was never
  given thee; and, see, see here, what is this I&mdash;there has been blood on
  the blade!"</p>

  <p>"Folly!" exclaimed the young man, turning first very red and then pale, so
  that his comrades gazed on him with wonder, "folly, I say. It is not blood,
  but water that has dimmed its shine;&mdash;and how knowest thou that I did
  not buy it?"</p>

  <p>"How do I know it?&mdash;thus," answered the artizan, drawing from a
  cupboard under his counter, a weapon precisely the facsimile in every respect
  of that in his hand: "There never were but two of these made, and I made
  them; the scabbard of this will fit that; see how the very chased work fits!
  I sold this, but not to you, Arvina; and I do not believe that it was given
  to you."</p>

  <p>"Filth that thou art, and carrion!" exclaimed the young man fiercely,
  striking his hand with violence upon the counter, "darest thou brave a
  nobleman? I tell thee, I doubt not at all that there be twenty such in every
  cutler's shop in Rome!&mdash;but to whom did'st thou sell this, that thou art
  so certain?"</p>

  <p>"Paullus Caecilius," replied the mechanic gravely but respectfully, "I
  brave no man, least of all a patrician; but mark my words&mdash;I did sell
  this dagger; here is my own mark on its back; if it was given to thee, thou
  must needs know the giver; for the rest, this <i>is</i> blood that has dimmed
  it, and not water; you cannot deceive me in the matter; and I would warn you,
  youth,&mdash;noble as you are, and plebeian I,&mdash;that there are laws in
  Rome, one of them called CORNELIA DE SICARIIS, which you were best take care
  that you know not more nearly. Meantime, you can take this scabbard if you
  will," handing to him, as he spoke, the sheath of the second weapon; "the
  price is one sestertium; it is the finest silver, chased as you see, and
  overlaid with pure gold."</p>

  <p>"Thou hast the money," returned Paullus, casting down on the counter
  several golden coins, stamped with a helmed head of Mars, and an eagle on the
  reverse, grasping a thunderbolt in its talons&mdash;"and the sheath is mine.
  Then thou wilt not disclose to whom it was sold?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I, since thou knowest without telling?"</p>

  <p>"Wilt thou, or not?"</p>

  <p>"Not to thee, Paullus."</p>

  <p>"Then will I find some one, to whom thou wilt fain disclose it!" he
  answered haughtily.</p>

  <p>"And who may that be, I beseech you?" asked the mechanic, half sneeringly.
  "For my part, I fancy you will let it rest altogether; some one was hurt with
  it last night, as you and <i>he</i>, we both know, can tell if you will! But
  I knew not that you were one of his men."</p>

  <p>There was an insolent sneer on the cutler's face that galled the young
  nobleman to the quick; and what was yet more annoying, there was an
  assumption of mutual intelligence and equality about him, that almost goaded
  the patrician's blood to fury. But by a mighty effort he subdued his passion
  to his will; and snatching up the weapon returned it to his belt, left the
  shop, and springing to the saddle of his beautiful black horse, rode
  furiously away. It was not till he reached the Carmental Gate, giving egress
  from the city through the vast walls of Cyclopean architecture, immediately
  at the base of the dread Tarpeian rock, overlooked and commanded by the
  outworks and turrets of the capitol, that he drew in his eager horse, and
  looked behind him for his friends. But they were not in sight; and a moment's
  reflection told him that, being about to start their coursers on a trial of
  speed, they would doubtless ride gently over the rugged pavement of the
  crowded streets.</p>

  <p>He doubted for a minute, whether he should turn back to meet them, or wait
  for their arrival at the gate, by which they must pass to gain the campus;
  but the fear of missing them, instantly induced him to adopt the latter
  course, and he sat for a little space motionless on his well-bitted and
  obedient horse beneath the shadow of the deep gate-way.</p>

  <p>Here his eye wandered around him for awhile, taking note indeed of the
  surrounding objects, the great temple of Jupiter Stator on the Palatine; the
  splendid portico of Catulus, adorned with the uncouth and grisly spoils of
  the Cimbric hordes slaughtered on the plains of Vercellae; the house of
  Scaurus, toward which a slow wain tugged by twelve powerful oxen was even
  then dragging one of the pondrous columns which rendered his hall for many
  years the boast of Roman luxury; and on the other tall buildings that stood
  every where about him; although in truth he scarce observed what for the time
  his eye dwelt upon.</p>

  <p>At length an impatient motion of his horse caused him to turn his face
  toward the black precipice of the huge rock at whose base he sat, and in a
  moment it fastened upon his mind with singular vividness&mdash;singular, for
  he had paused fifty times upon that spot before, without experiencing such
  feelings&mdash;that he was on the very pavement, which had so often been
  bespattered with the blood of despairing traitors. The noble Manlius, tumbled
  from the very rock, which his single arm had but a little while before
  defended, seemed to lie there, even at his feet, mortally maimed and in the
  agony of death, yet even so too proud to mix one groan with the curses he
  poured forth against Rome's democratic rabble. Then, by a not inapt
  transition, the scene changed, and Caius Marcius was at hand, with the sword
  drawn in his right, that won him the proud name of Coriolanus, and the same
  rabble that had hurled Caius Manlius down, yelling and hooting "to the rock
  with him! to the rock!" but at a safe and respectful distance; their factious
  tribunes goading them to outrage and new riot.</p>

  <p>It was strange that these thoughts should have occurred so clearly at this
  moment to the excited mind of the young noble; and he felt that it was
  strange himself; and would have banished the ideas, but they would not away;
  and he continued musing on the inconstant turbulence of the plebeians, and
  the unerring doom which had overtaken every one of their idols, from the
  hands of their own partizans, until his companions at length rode slowly up
  the street to join him.</p>

  <p>There was some coldness in the manner of Aristius Fuscus, as they met
  again, and even Aurelius seemed surprised and not well pleased; for they had
  in truth been conversing earnestly about the perturbation of their friend at
  the remarks of the artizan, and the singularity of his conduct in wearing
  arms at all; and he heard Victor say just before they joined
  company&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No! that is not so odd, Fuscus, in these times. It was but two nights
  since, as I was coming home something later than my wont from Terentia's,
  that I fell in with Clodius reeling along, frantically drunk and furious,
  with half a dozen torch-bearers before, and half a score wolfish looking
  gladiators all armed with blade and buckler, and all half-drunk, behind him.
  I do assure you that I almost swore I would go out no more without
  weapons."</p>

  <p>"They would have done you no good, man," said Aristius, "if some nineteen
  or twenty had set upon you. But an they would, I care not; it is against the
  law, and no good citizen should carry them at all."</p>

  <p>"Carry arms, I suppose you mean, Aristius," interrupted Paullus boldly.
  "Ye are talking about me, I fancy&mdash;is it not so?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, it is," replied the other gravely. "You were disturbed not a little
  at what stout Volero said."</p>

  <p>"I was, I was," answered Arvina very quickly, "because I could not tell
  him; and it is not pleasant to be suspected. The truth is that the dagger is
  not mine at all, and that it <i>is</i> blood that was on it; for last
  night&mdash;but lo!" he added, interrupting himself, "I was about to speak
  out, and tell you all; and yet my lips are sealed."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear it," said Aristius, "I do not like mysteries; and this
  seems to me a dark one!"</p>

  <p>"It is&mdash;as dark as Erebus," said Paullus eagerly, "and as guilty too;
  but it is not my mystery, so help me the god of good faith and honour!"</p>

  <p>"That is enough said; surely that is enough for you, Aristius," exclaimed
  the warmer and more excitable Aurelius.</p>

  <p>"For you it may be," replied the noble youth, with a melancholy smile.
  "You are a boy in heart, my Aurelius, and overflow so much with generosity
  and truth that you believe all others to be as frank and candid. I alas! have
  grown old untimely, and, having seen what I have seen, hold men's assertions
  little worth."</p>

  <p>The hot blood mounted fiercely into the cheek of Paullus; and, striking
  his horse's flank suddenly with his heel, he made him passage half across the
  street, and would have seized Aristius by the throat, had not their comrade
  interposed to hinder him.</p>

  <p>"You are both mad, I believe; so mad that all the hellebore in both the
  Anticyras could not cure you. Thou, Fuscus, for insulting him with needless
  doubts. Thou, Paullus, for mentioning the thing, or shewing the dagger at
  all, if you did not choose to explain."</p>

  <p>"I do <i>choose</i> to explain," replied Caecilius, "but I cannot; I have
  explained it all to Marcus Tullius."</p>

  <p>"To Cicero," exclaimed Aristius. "Why did you not say so before? I was
  wrong, then, I confess my error; if Cicero be satisfied, it must needs be all
  well."</p>

  <p>"That name of Cicero is like the voice of an oracle to Fuscus ever!" said
  Aurelius Victor, laughing. "I believe he thinks the new man from Arpinum a
  very god, descended from Olympus!"</p>

  <p>"No! not a God," replied Aristius Fuscus, "only the greatest work of God,
  a wise and virtuous man, in an age which has few such to boast. But come, let
  us ride on and conclude our race; and thou, Arvina, forget what I said; I
  meant not to wrong thee."</p>

  <p>"I have forgotten," answered Paullus; and, with the word, they gave their
  horses head, and cantered onward for the field of Mars.</p>

  <p>The way for some distance was narrow, lying between the fortified rock of
  the Capitol, with its stern lines of immemorial ramparts on the right hand,
  and on the left the long arcades and stately buildings of the vegetable mart,
  on the river bank, now filled with sturdy peasants, from the Sabine country,
  eager to sell their fresh green herbs; and blooming girls, from Tibur and the
  banks of Anio, with garlands of flowers, and cheeks that outvied their own
  brightest roses.</p>

  <p>Beyond these, still concealing the green expanse of the level plain, and
  the famous river, stood side by side three temples, sacred to Juno Matuta,
  Piety, and Hope; each with its massy colonnade of Doric or Corinthian, or
  Ionic pillars; the latter boasting its frieze wrought in bronze; and that of
  Piety, its tall equestrian statue, so richly gilt and burnished that it
  gleamed in the sunlight as if it were of solid gold.</p>

  <p>Onward they went, still at a merry canter, their generous and high mettled
  coursers fretting against the bits which restrained their speed, and their
  young hearts elated and bounding quickly in their bosoms, with the excitement
  of the gallant exercise; and now they cleared the last winding of the
  suburban street, and clothed in its perennial verdure, the wide field lay
  outspread, like one sheet of emerald verdure, before them, with the bright
  Tiber flashing to the sun in many a reach and ripple, and the gay slope of
  the Collis Hortulorum, glowing with all its terraced gardens in the
  distance.</p>

  <p>A few minutes more brought them to the Flaminian way, whereon, nearly
  midway the plain, stood the <i>diribitorium</i>, or pay-office of the troops;
  the porticoes of which were filled with the soldiers of Metellus Creticus,
  and Quintus Marcius Rex, who lay with their armies encamped on the low hills
  beyond the river, waiting their triumphs, and forbidden by the laws to come
  into the city so long as they remained invested with their military rank.
  Around this stately building were many colonnades, and open buildings adapted
  to the exercises of the day, when winter or bad weather should prevent their
  performance in the open mead, and stored with all appliances, and instruments
  required for the purpose; and to these Paullus and his friends proceeded,
  answering merely with a nod or passing jest the salutations of many a helmed
  centurion and gorgeous tribune of the soldiery.</p>

  <p>A grand Ionic gateway gave them admittance to the hippodrome, a vast oval
  space, adorned with groups of sculpture and obelisks and columns in the
  midst; on some of which were affixed inscriptions commemorative of great
  feats of skill or strength or daring; while others displayed placards
  announcing games or contests to take place in future, and challenges of
  celebrated gymnasts for the cestus fight, the wrestling match, or the
  foot-race.</p>

  <p>Around the outer circumference were rows of seats, shaded by plane trees
  overrun with ivy, and there were already seated many young men of noble
  birth, chatting together, or betting, with their waxed tablets and their
  <i>styli</i>(11) in their hands, some waiting the commencement of the race
  between Fuscus and Victor, others watching with interest the progress of a
  sham fight on horseback between two young men of the equestrian order,
  denoted by the narrow crimson stripes on their tunics, who were careering to
  and fro, armed with long staves and circular bucklers, in all the swift and
  beautiful movements of the mimic combat.</p>

  <p class="footnote">11. The stylus was a pointed metallic pencil used for
  tracing letters on the waxen surface of the table.</p>

  <p>Among those most interested in this spectacle, the eye of Arvina fell
  instantly on the tall and gaunt form of Catiline, who stood erect on one of
  the marble benches, applauding with his hands, and now and then shouting a
  word of encouragement to the combatants, as they wheeled by him in the mazes
  of their half angry sport. It was not long, however, before their strife was
  brought to a conclusion; for, almost as the friends entered, the hindmost
  horseman of the two made a thrust at the other, which taking effect merely on
  the lower rim of his antagonist's <i>parma</i>, glanced off under his
  outstretched arm, and made the striker, in a great measure, lose his balance.
  As quick as light, the other wheeled upon him, feinted a pass at his breast
  with the point of the staff; and then, as he lowered his shield to guard
  himself, reversed the weapon with a swift turn of the wrist, dealt him a
  heavy blow with the trunchon on the head; and then, while the whole place
  rang with tumultuous plaudits, circled entirely round him to the left, and
  delivered his thrust with such effect in the side, that it bore his
  competitor clear out of the saddle.</p>

  <p>"Euge! Euge! well done," shouted Catiline in ecstacy; "by Hercules! I
  never saw in all my life better skirmishing. It is all over with Titus
  Varus!"</p>

  <p>And in truth it was all over with him; but not in the sense which the
  speaker meant: for, as he fell, the horses came into collision, and it so
  happened that the charger of the conqueror, excited by the fury of the
  contest, laid hold of the other's neck with his teeth, and almost tore away a
  piece of the muscular flesh at the very moment when the rider's spur, as he
  fell, cut a long gash in his flank.</p>

  <p>With a wild yelling neigh, the tortured brute yerked out his heels
  viciously; and, as ill luck would have it, both took effect on the person of
  his fallen master, one striking him a terrible blow on the chest, the other
  shattering his collar bone and shoulder.</p>

  <p>A dozen of the spectators sprang down from the seats and took him up
  before Paullus could dismount to aid him; but, as they raised him from the
  ground, his eyes were already glazing.</p>

  <p>"Marcius has conquered me," he muttered in tones of deep mortification,
  unconscious, as it would seem, of his agony, and wounded only by the
  indomitable Roman pride; and with the words his jaw dropped, and his last
  strife was ended.</p>

  <p>"The fool!" exclaimed Cataline, with a bitter sneer; "what had he got to
  do, that he should ride against Caius Marcius, when he could not so much as
  keep his saddle, the fool!"</p>

  <p>"He is gone!" cried another; "game to the last, brave Varus!"</p>

  <p>"He came of a brave race," said a third; "but he rode badly!"</p>

  <p>"At least not so well as Marcius," replied yet a fourth; "but who does? To
  be foiled by him does not argue bad riding."</p>

  <p>"Who does? why Paullus, here," cried Aurelius Victor; "I'll match him, if
  he will ride, for a thousand sesterces&mdash;ten thousand, if you will."</p>

  <p>"No! I'll not bet about it. I lost by this cursed chance," answered the
  former speaker; "but Varus did not ride badly, I maintain it!" he added, with
  the steadiness of a discomfited partisan.</p>

  <p>"Ay! but he did, most pestilently," interposed Catiline, almost fiercely;
  "but come, come, why don't they carry him away? we are losing all the
  morning."</p>

  <p>"I thought he was a friend of yours, Sergius," said another of the
  bystanders, apparently vexed at the heartlessness of his manner.</p>

  <p>"Why, ay! so he was," replied the conspirator; "but he is nothing now: nor
  can my friendship aught avail him. It was his time and his fate! ours, it may
  be, will come to-morrow. Nor do I see at all wherefore our sports should not
  proceed, because a man has gone hence. Fifty men every day die somewhere,
  while we are dining, drinking, kissing our mistresses or wives; but do we
  stop for that? Ho! bear him hence, we will attend his funeral, when it shall
  be soever; and we will drink to his memory to-day. What comes next,
  comrades?"</p>

  <p>Arvina, it is true, was for a moment both shocked and disgusted at the
  heartless and unfeeling tone; but few if any of the others evinced the like
  tenderness; for it must be remembered, in the first place, that the Romans,
  inured to sights of blood and torture daily in the gladiatorial fights of the
  arena, were callous to human suffering, and careless of human life at all
  times; and, in the second, that Stoicism was the predominant affectation of
  the day, not only among the rude and coarse, but among the best and most
  virtuous citizens of the republic. Few, therefore, left the ground, when the
  corpse, decently enveloped in the toga he had worn when living, was borne
  homewards; except the involuntary homicide, who could not even at that day in
  decency remain, and a few of his most intimate associates, who covering their
  faces in the lappets of their gowns, followed the bearers in stern and silent
  sorrow.</p>

  <p>Scarcely then had the sad procession threaded the marble archway, before
  Catiline again asked loudly and imperiously,</p>

  <p>"What is to be the next, I pray you? are we to sit here like old women by
  their firesides, croaking and whimpering till dinner time?"</p>

  <p>"No! by the gods," cried Aurelius, "we have a race to come off, which I
  propose to win. Fuscus Aristius here, and I&mdash;we will start instantly, if
  no one else has the ground."</p>

  <p>"Away with you then," answered the other; "come sit by me, Arvina, I would
  say a word with you."</p>

  <p>Giving his horse to one of his grooms, the young man followed him without
  answer; for although it is true that Catiline was at this time a marked man
  and of no favorable reputation, yet squeamishness in the choice of associates
  was never a characteristic of the Romans; and persons, the known perpetrators
  of the most atrocious crimes, so long as they were unconvicted, mingled on
  terms of equality, unshunned by any, except the gravest and most rigid
  censors. Arvina, too, was very young; and very young men are often
  fascinated, as it were, by great reputations, even of great criminals, with a
  passionate desire to see them more closely, and observe the stuff they are
  made of. So that, in fact, Catiline being looked upon in those days much as a
  desperate gambler, a celebrated duellist, or a famous seducer of our own
  time, whom no one shuns though every one abuses, it was not perhaps very
  wonderful if this rash, ardent, and inexperienced youth should have conceived
  himself flattered by such notice, from one of whom all the world was talking;
  and should have followed him to a seat with a sense of gratified vanity,
  blended with eager curiosity.</p>

  <p>The race, which followed, differed not much from any other race; except
  that the riders having no stirrups, that being a yet undiscovered luxury,
  much less depended upon jockeyship&mdash;the skill of the riders being
  limited to keeping their seats steadily and guiding the animals they
  bestrode&mdash;and much more upon the native powers, the speed and endurance
  of the coursers.</p>

  <p>So much, however, was Arvina interested by the manner and conversation of
  the singular man by whose side he sat, and who was indeed laying himself out
  with deep art to captivate him, and take his mind, as it were, by storm, now
  with the boldest and most daring paradoxes; now with bursts of eloquent
  invective against the oppression and aristocratic insolence of the cabal,
  which by his shewing governed Rome; and now with sarcasm and pungent wit,
  that he saw but little of the course, which he had come especially to look
  at.</p>

  <p>"Do you indeed ride so well, my Paullus?" asked his companion suddenly, as
  if the thought had been suggested by some observation he had just made on the
  competitors, as they passed in the second circuit. "So well, I mean, as
  Aurelius Victor said; and would you undertake the combat of the horse and
  spear with Caius Marcius?"</p>

  <p>"Truly I would," said Arvina, blushing slightly; "I have interchanged many
  a blow and thrust with young Varro, whom our master-at-arms holds better with
  the spear than Marcius; and I feel myself his equal. I have been practising a
  good deal of late," he added modestly; "for, though perhaps you know it not,
  I have been elected <i>decurio</i>;(12) and, as first chosen, leader of a
  troop, and am to take the field with the next reinforcements that go out to
  Pontus to our great Pompey."</p>

  <p class="footnote">12. The cavalry attached to every legion, consisting of
  three hundred men, was divided into ten troops, <i>turmae</i> of thirty each,
  which were subdivided into decuriae of ten, commanded by a decurio, the first
  elected of whom was called <i>dux turmae</i>, and led the troop.</p>

  <p>"The next reinforcements," replied Catiline with a meditative air: "ha!
  that may be some time distant."</p>

  <p>"Not so, by Jupiter! my Sergius; we are already ordered to hold ourselves
  in readiness to march for Brundusium, where we shall ship for Pontus. I fancy
  we shall set forth as soon as the consular comitia have been held."</p>

  <p>"It may be so," said the other; "but I do not think it. There may fall out
  that which shall rather summon Pompey homeward, than send more men to join
  him. That is a very handsome dagger," he broke off, interrupting himself
  suddenly&mdash;"where did you get it? I should like much to get me such an
  one to give to my friend Cethegus, who has a taste for such things. I wonder,
  however, at your wearing it so openly."</p>

  <p>Taken completely by surprise, Arvina answered hastily, "I found it last
  night; and I wear it, hoping to find the owner."</p>

  <p>"By Hercules!" said the conspirator laughing; "I would not take so much
  pains, were I you. But, do you hear, I have partly a mind myself to claim
  it."</p>

  <p>"No! you were better not," said Paullus, gravely; "besides, you can get
  one just like this, without risking any thing. Volero, the cutler, in the
  Sacred Way, near Vesta's temple, has one precisely like to this for sale. He
  made this too, he tells me; though he will not tell me to whom he sold it;
  but that shall soon be got out of him, notwithstanding."</p>

  <p>"Ha! are you so anxious in the matter? it would oblige you, then, if I
  should confess myself the loser! Well, I don't want to buy another; I want
  this very one. I believe I must claim it."</p>

  <p>He spoke with an emphasis so singular; impressive, and at the same time
  half-derisive, and with so strangely-meaning an expression, that Paullus
  indeed scarcely knew what to think; but, in the mean time, he had recovered
  his own self-possession, and merely answered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I think you had better not; it would perhaps be dangerous!"</p>

  <p>"Dangerous? Ha! that is another motive. I love danger! verily, I believe I
  must; yes! I must claim it."</p>

  <p>"What!" exclaimed Paullus, turning pale from excitement; "Is it yours? Do
  you say that it is yours?"</p>

  <p>"Look! look!" exclaimed Catiline, springing to his feet; "here they come,
  here they come now; this is the last round. By the gods! but they are gallant
  horses, and well matched! See how the bay courser stretches himself, and how
  quickly he gathers! The bay! the bay has it for five hundred sesterces!"</p>

  <p>"I wager you," said a dissolute-looking long-haired youth; "I wager you
  five hundred, Catiline. I say the gray horse wins."</p>

  <p>"Be it so, then," shouted Catiline; "the bay, the bay! spur, spur,
  Aristius Fuscus, Aurelius gains on you; spur, spur!"</p>

  <p>"The gray, the gray! There is not a horse in Rome can touch Aurelius
  Victor's gray South-wind!" replied the other.</p>

  <p>And in truth, Victor's Gallic courser repaid his master's vaunts; for he
  made, though he had seemed beat, so desperate a rally, that he rushed past
  the bay Arab almost at the goal, and won by a clear length amidst the roars
  of the glad spectators.</p>

  <p>"I have lost, plague on it!" exclaimed Catiline; "and here is Clodius
  expects to be paid on the instant, I'll be sworn."</p>

  <p>And as he spoke, the debauchee with whom he had betted came up, holding
  his left hand extended, tapping its palm with the forefinger of the
  right.</p>

  <p>"I told you so," he said, "I told you so; where be the sesterces?"</p>

  <p>"You must needs wait a while; I have not my purse with me," Catiline
  began. But Paullus interrupted him&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I have, I have, my Sergius; permit me to accommodate you." And suiting
  the action to the word, he gave the conspirator several large gold coins,
  adding, "you can repay me when it suits you."</p>

  <p>"That will be never," said Clodius with a sneer; "you don't know Lucius
  Catiline, I see, young man."</p>

  <p>"Ay, but he does!" replied the other, with a sarcastic grin; "for Catiline
  never forgets a friend, or forgives a foe. Can Clodius say the same?"</p>

  <p>But Clodius merely smiled, and walked off, clinking the money he had won
  tauntingly in his hand.</p>

  <p>"What now, I wonder, is the day destined to bring forth?" said the
  conspirator, making no more allusion to the dagger.</p>

  <p>"A contest now between myself, Aristius, and Aurelius, in the five games
  of the <i>quinquertium</i>, and then a foot race in the heaviest
  panoply."</p>

  <p>"Ha! can you beat them?" asked Catiline, regarding Arvina with an interest
  that grew every moment keener, as he saw more of his strength and daring
  spirit.</p>

  <p>"I can try."</p>

  <p>"Shall I bet on you?"</p>

  <p>"If you please. I can beat them in some, I think; and, as I said, I will
  try in all."</p>

  <p>More words followed, for Paullus hastened away to strip and anoint himself
  for the coming struggle; and in a little while the strife itself
  succeeded.</p>

  <p>To describe this would be tedious; but suffice it, that while he won
  decidedly three games of the five, Paullus was beat in none; and that in the
  armed foot race, the most toilsome and arduous exercise of the Campus, he not
  only beat his competitors with ease; but ran the longest course, carrying the
  most ponderous armature and shield, in shorter time than had been performed
  within many years on the Field of Mars.</p>

  <p>Catiline watched him eagerly all the while, inspecting him as a purchaser
  would a horse he was about to buy; and then, muttering to himself, "We must
  have him!" walked up to join him as he finished the last exploit.</p>

  <p>"Will you dine with me, Paullus," he said, "to-day, and meet the loveliest
  women you can see in Rome, and no prudes either?"</p>

  <p>"Willingly," he replied; "but I must swim first in the Tiber!"</p>

  <p>"Be it so, there is time enough; I will swim also." And they moved down in
  company toward the river.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch106"
     name="ch106"></a>VI. &mdash; THE FALSE LOVE</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>Fie, fie, upon her;<br>
  There's a language in her eye, her cheek, her lip;<br>
  Nay, her foot speaks, her wanton spirits look out<br>
  At every joint and motive of her body.</i><br>
  &mdash;Troilus and Cressida.</p><br>

  <p class="first">ABOUT three hours later than the scene in the Campus
  Martius, which had occurred a little after noon, Catiline was standing richly
  dressed in a bright saffron(13) robe, something longer than the ordinary
  tunic, flowered with sprigs of purple, in the inmost chamber of the woman's
  apartments, in his own heavily mortgaged mansion. His wife, Aurelia
  Orestilla, sat beside him on a low stool, a woman of the most superb and
  queenly beauty&mdash;for whom it was believed that he had plunged himself
  into the deepest guilt&mdash;and still, although past the prime of Italian
  womanhood, possessing charms that might well account for the most insane
  passion.</p>

  <p class="footnote">13. The guests at Roman banquets usually brought their
  own napkins, <i>mappae</i>, and wore robes of bright colors, usually
  flowered, called <i>caenateriae</i> or <i>cubitoriae</i>.</p>

  <p>A slave was listening with watchful and half terrified attention to the
  injunctions of his lord&mdash;for Catiline was an unscrupulous and severe
  master&mdash;and, as he ceased speaking, he made a deep genuflexion and
  retired.</p>

  <p>No sooner had he gone than Catiline turned quickly to the lady, whose
  lovely face wore some marks of displeasure, and said rather shortly,</p>

  <p>"You have not gone to her, my Aurelia. There is no time to lose; the young
  man will be here soon, and if they meet, ere you have given her the cue, all
  will be lost."</p>

  <p>"I do not like it, my Sergius," said the woman, rising, but making no
  movement to leave the chamber.</p>

  <p>"And why not, I beseech you, madam?" he replied angrily; "or what is there
  in that which I desire you to tell the girl to do, that you have not done
  twenty times yourself, and Fulvia, and Sempronia, and half Rome's noblest
  ladies? Tush! I say, tush! go do it."</p>

  <p>"She is my daughter, Sergius," answered Aurelia, in a tone of deep
  tenderness; "a daughter's honor must be something to every mother!"</p>

  <p>"And a son's life to every father!" said Catiline with a fierce sneer. "I
  had a son once, I remember. You wished to enter an (14)<i>empty</i> house on
  the day of your marriage feast. I do not think you found him in your way!
  Besides, for honor&mdash;if I read Lucia's eyes rightly, there is not much of
  that to emperil."</p>

  <p class="footnote">14. Pro certo creditur, necato filio, <i>vacuam</i> domum
  scelestis nuptiis</p>

  <p>When he spoke of his son, she covered her face in her richly jewelled
  hands, and a slight shudder shook her whole frame. When she looked up again,
  she was pale as death, and her lips quivered as she asked&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Must I, then? Oh! be merciful, my Sergius."</p>

  <p>"You must, Aurelia!" he replied sternly, "and that now. Our fortunes, nay,
  our lives, depend on it!"</p>

  <p>"<i>All</i>&mdash;must she give all, Lucius?"</p>

  <p>"All that he asks! But fear not, he shall wed her, when our plans shall be
  crowned with triumph!"</p>

  <p>"Will you swear it?"</p>

  <p>"By all the Gods! he shall! by all the Furies, if you will, by Earth, and
  Heaven, and Hades!"</p>

  <p>"I will go," she replied, something reassured, "and prepare her for the
  task!"</p>

  <p>"The task!" he muttered with his habitual sneer. "Daintily worded, fair
  one; but it will not, I fancy, prove a hard one; Paullus is young and
  handsome; and our soft Lucia has, methinks, something of her mother's
  yielding tenderness."</p>

  <p>"Do you reproach me with it, Sergius?"</p>

  <p>"Nay! rather I adore thee for it, loveliest one; but go and prepare our
  Lucia." Then, as she left the room, the dark scowl settled down on his black
  brow, and he clinched his hand as he said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"She waxes stubborn&mdash;let her beware! She is not half so young as she
  was; and her beauty wanes as fast as my passion for it; let her beware how
  she crosses me!"</p>

  <p>While he was speaking yet a slave entered, and announced that Paullus
  Caecilius Arvina had arrived, and Curius, and the noble Fulvia; and as he
  received the tidings the frown passed away from the brow of the conspirator,
  and putting on his mask of smooth, smiling dissimulation, he went forth to
  meet his guests.</p>

  <p>They were assembled in the tablinum, or saloon, Arvina clad in a violet
  colored tunic, sprinkled with flowers in their natural hues, and
  Curius&mdash;a slight keen-looking man, with a wild, proud expression, giving
  a sort of interest to a countenance haggard from the excitement of passion,
  in one of rich crimson, fringed at the wrists and neck with gold. Fulvia, his
  paramour, a woman famed throughout Rome alike for her licentiousness and
  beauty, was hanging on his arm, glittering with chains and carcanets, and
  bracelets of the costliest gems, in her fair bosom all too much displayed for
  a matron's modesty; on her round dazzling arms; about her swan-like neck;
  wreathed in the profuse tresses of her golden hair&mdash;for she was that
  unusual and much admired being, an Italian blonde&mdash;and, spanning the
  circumference of her slight waist. She was, indeed, a creature exquisitely
  bright and lovely, with such an air of mild and angelic candor pervading her
  whole face, that you would have sworn her the most innocent, the purest of
  her sex. Alas! that she was indeed almost the vilest! that she was that rare
  monster, a woman, who, linked with every crime and baseness that can almost
  unsex a woman, preserves yet in its height, one eminent and noble virtue, one
  half-redeeming trait amidst all her infamy, in her proud love of country!
  Name, honor, virtue, conscience, womanhood, truth, piety, all, all, were
  sacrificed to her rebellious passions. But to her love of country she could
  have sacrificed those very passions! That frail abandoned wretch was still a
  Roman&mdash;might have been in a purer age a heroine of Rome's most
  glorious.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, most lovely Fulvia," exclaimed the host, gliding softly into the
  room. "By Mars! the most favored of immortals! You must have stolen
  Aphrodite's cestus! Saw you her ever look so beautiful, my Paullus? You do
  well to put those sapphires in your hair, for they wax pale and dim besides
  the richer azure of your eyes; and the dull gold in which they are enchased
  sets off the sparkling splendor of your tresses. What, Fulvia, know you not
  young Arvina&mdash;one of the great Caecilii? By Hercules! my Curius, he won
  the best of the quinquertium from such competitors as Victor and Aristius
  Fuscus, and ran twelve stadii, with the heaviest breast-plate and shield in
  the armory, quicker than it has been performed since the days of Licinius
  Celer. I prithee, know, and cherish him, my friends, for I would have him one
  of us. In truth I would, my Paullus."</p>

  <p>The flattering words of the tempter, and the more fascinating smiles and
  glances of the bewitching siren, were not thrown away on the young noble; and
  these, with the soft perfumed atmosphere, the splendidly voluptuous furniture
  of the saloon, and the delicious music, which was floating all the while upon
  his ears from the blended instruments and voices of unseen minstrels,
  conspired to plunge his senses into a species of effeminate and luxurious
  languor, which suited well the ulterior views of Catiline.</p>

  <p>"One thing alone has occurred," resumed the host, after some moments spent
  in light jests and trivial conversation, "to decrease our pleasure: Cethegus
  was to have dined with us to-day, and Decius Brutus, with his inimitable wife
  Sempronia. But they have disappointed us; and, save Aurelia only, and our
  poor little Lucia, there will be none but ourselves to eat my Umbrian
  boar."</p>

  <p>"Have you a boar, my Sergius?" exclaimed Curius, eagerly, who was addicted
  to the pleasures of the table, almost as much as the charms of women. "By
  Pan, the God of Hunters! we are in luck to-day!"</p>

  <p>"But wherefore comes not Sempronia?" inquired Fulvia, not very much
  displeased by the absence of a rival beauty.</p>

  <p>"Brutus is called away, it appears, suddenly to Tarentum upon business;
  and she"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Prefers entertaining our Cethegus, alone in her own house, I fancy,"
  interrupted Fulvia.</p>

  <p>"Exactly so," replied Catiline, with a smile of meaning.</p>

  <p>"Happy Cethegus," said Arvina.</p>

  <p>"Do you think her so handsome?" asked Fulvia, favoring him with one of her
  most melting glances.</p>

  <p>"The handsomest woman," he replied, "with but one exception, I ever had
  the luck to look upon."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!&mdash;and pray, who is the exception?" asked the lady, very
  tartly.</p>

  <p>There happened to be lying on a marble slab, near to the place where they
  were standing, a small round mirror of highly polished steel, set in a frame
  of tortoiseshell and gold. Paullus had noticed it before she spoke; and
  taking it up without a moment's pause, he raised it to her face.</p>

  <p>"Look!" he said, "look into that, and blush at your question."</p>

  <p>"Prettily said, my Paullus; thy wit is as fleet as thy foot is speedy,"
  said the conspirator.</p>

  <p>"Flatterer!" whispered the lady, evidently much delighted; and then, in a
  lower voice she added, "Do you indeed think so?"</p>

  <p>"Else may I never hope."</p>

  <p>But at this moment the curtains were drawn aside, and Orestilla entered
  from the gallery of the peristyle, accompanied by her daughter Lucia.</p>

  <p>The latter was a girl of about eighteen years old, and of appearance so
  remarkable, that she must not be passed unnoticed. In person she was
  extremely tall and slender, and at first sight you would have supposed her
  thin; until the wavy outlines of the loose robe of plain white linen which
  she wore, undulating at every movement of her form, displayed the exquisite
  fulness of her swelling bust, and the voluptuous roundness of all her lower
  limbs. Her arms, which were bare to the shoulders, where her gown was
  fastened by two studs of gold, were quite unadorned, by any gem or bracelet,
  and although beautifully moulded, were rather slender than full.</p>

  <p>Her face did not at first sight strike you more than her person, as being
  beautiful; for it was singularly still and inexpressive when at
  rest&mdash;although all the features were fine and classically
  regular&mdash;and was almost unnaturally pale and hueless. The mouth only,
  had any thing of warmth, or color, or expression; and what expression there
  was, was not pleasing, for although soft and winning, it was sensual to the
  last degree.</p>

  <p>Her manner, however, contradicted this; for she slided into the circle,
  with downcast eyes, the long dark silky lashes only visible in relief against
  the marble paleness of her cheek, as if she were ashamed to raise them from
  the ground; her whole air being that of a girl oppressed with overwhelming
  bashfulness, to an extent almost painful.</p>

  <p>"Why, what is this, Aurelia," exclaimed Catiline, as if he were angry,
  although in truth the whole thing was carefully preconcerted. "Wherefore is
  Lucia thus strangely clad? Is it, I pray you, in scorn of our noble guests,
  that she wears only this plain morning stola?"</p>

  <p>"Pardon her, I beseech you, good my Sergius," answered his wife, with a
  painfully simulated smile; "you know how over-timid she is and bashful; she
  had determined not to appear at dinner, had I not laid my commands on her.
  Her very hair, you see, is not braided."</p>

  <p>"Ha! this is ill done, my girl Lucia," answered Catiline. "What will my
  young friend, Arvina, think of you, who comes hither to-day, for the first
  time? For Curius and our lovely Fulvia, I care not so much, seeing they know
  your whims; but I am vexed, indeed, that Paullus should behold you thus in
  disarray, with your hair thus knotted like a slave girl's, on your neck."</p>

  <p>"Like a Dryad's, rather, or shy Oread's of Diana's train&mdash;beautiful
  hair!" replied the youth, whose attention had been called to the girl by this
  conversation; and who, having thought her at first unattractive rather than
  otherwise, had now discovered the rare beauties of her lythe and slender
  figure, and detected, as he thought, a world of passion in her serpent-like
  and sinuous motions.</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes to meet his slowly, as he spoke; gazed into them for
  one moment, and then, as if ashamed of what she had done, dropped them again
  instantly; while a bright crimson flush shot like a stream of lava over her
  pallid face, and neck, and arms; yes, her arms blushed, and her hands to the
  finger ends! It was but one moment, that those large lustrous orbs looked
  full into his, swimming in liquid Oriental languor, yet flashing out beams of
  consuming fire.</p>

  <p>Yet Paullus Arvina felt the glance, like an electrical influence, through
  every nerve and artery of his body, and trembled at its power.</p>

  <p>It was a minute before he could collect himself enough to speak to her,
  for all the rest had moved away a little, and left them standing together;
  and when he did so, his voice faltered, and his manner was so much agitated,
  that she must have been blind, indeed, and stupid, not to perceive it.</p>

  <p>And Lucia was not blind nor stupid. No! by the God of Love! an universe of
  wild imaginative intellect, an ocean of strange whirling thoughts, an Etna of
  fierce and fiery passions, lay buried beneath that calm, bashful, almost
  awkward manner. Many bad thoughts were there, many unmaidenly imaginings,
  many ungoverned and most evil passions; but there was also much that was
  partly good; much that might have been all good, and high and noble, had it
  been properly directed; but alas! as much pains had been taken to corrupt and
  deprave that youthful understanding, and to inflame those nascent passions,
  as are devoted by good parents to developing the former, and repressing the
  growth of the latter.</p>

  <p>As it was, self indulged, and indulged by others, she was a creature of
  impulse entirely, ill regulated and ungovernable.</p>

  <p>Intended from the first to be a tool in his own hands, whenever he might
  think fit to use her, she had in no case hitherto run counter to the views of
  Catiline; because, so long as his schemes were agreeable to her inclinations,
  and favorable to her pleasures, she was quite willing to be his tool; though
  by no means unconscious of the fact that he meant her to be such.</p>

  <p>What might be the result should his wishes cross her own, the arch
  conspirator had never given himself the pains to enquire; for, like the
  greater part of voluptuaries, regarding women as mere animals, vastly
  inferior in mind and intellect to men, he had entirely overlooked her mental
  qualifications, and fancied her a being of as small moral capacity, as he
  knew her to be of strong physical organization.</p>

  <p>He was mistaken; as wise men often are, and deeply, perhaps fatally.</p>

  <p>There was not probably a girl in all Italy, in all the world, who would so
  implicitly have followed his directions, as long as to do so gratified her
  passions, and clashed not with her indomitable will, to the sacrifice of all
  principle, and with the most total disregard of right or wrong, as Lucia
  Orestilla; but certainly there was not one, who would have resisted commands,
  threats, violence, more pertinaciously or dauntlessly, than the same Lucia,
  should her will and his councils ever be set at twain.</p>

  <p>While Paullus was yet conversing in an under tone with this strange girl,
  and becoming every moment more and more fascinated by the whole tone of her
  remarks, which were free, and even bold, as contrasted with the bashful air
  and timid glances which accompanied them, the curtains of the Tablinum were
  drawn apart, and a soft symphony of flutes stealing in from the atrium,
  announced that the dinner was prepared.</p>

  <p>"My Curius," exclaimed Catiline, "I must entreat you to take charge of
  Fulvia; I had proposed myself that pleasure, intending that you should escort
  Sempronia, and Decius my own Orestilla; but, as it is, we will each abide by
  his own lady; and Paullus here will pardon the youth and rawness of my
  Lucia."</p>

  <p>"By heaven! I would wish nothing better," said Curius, taking Fulvia by
  the hand, and leading her forward. "Should you, Arvina?"</p>

  <p>"Not I, indeed," replied Paullus, "if Lucia be content." And he looked to
  catch her eye, as he took her soft hand in his own, but her face remained
  cold and pale as marble, and her eye downcast.</p>

  <p>As they passed out, however, into the fauces, or passage leading to the
  dining-room, Catiline added,</p>

  <p>"As we are all, I may say, one family and party, I have desired the slaves
  to spread couches only; the ladies will recline with us, instead of sitting
  at the board."</p>

  <p>At this moment, did Paullus fancy it? or did that beautiful pale girl
  indeed press his fingers in her own? he could not be mistaken; and yet there
  was the downcast eye, the immoveable cheek, and the unsmiling aspect of the
  rosy mouth. But he returned the pressure, and that so significantly, that she
  at least could not be mistaken; nor was she, for her eye again met his, with
  that deep amorous languid glance; was bashfully withdrawn; and then met his
  again, glancing askance through the dark fringed lids, and a quick flashing
  smile, and a burning blush followed; and in a second's space she was again as
  cold, as impassive as a marble statue.</p>

  <p>They reached the triclinium, a beautiful oblong apartment, gorgeously
  painted with arabesques of gold and scarlet upon a deep azure ground work. A
  circular table, covered with a white cloth, bordered with a deep edge of
  purple and deeper fringe of gold, stood in the centre, and around it three
  couches, nearly of the same height with the board, each the segment of a
  circle, the three forming a horse-shoe.</p>

  <p>The couches were of the finest rosewood, inlaid with tortoiseshell and
  ivory and brass, strewed with the richest tapestries, and piled with cushions
  glowing with splendid needlework. And over all, upheld by richly moulded
  shafts of Corinthian bronze, was a canopy of Tyrian purple, tasselled and
  fringed with gold.</p>

  <p>The method of reclining at the table was, that the guests should place
  themselves on the left side, propped partly by the left elbow and partly by a
  pile of cushions; each couch being made to contain in general three persons,
  the head of the second coming immediately below the right arm of the first,
  and the third in like manner; the body of each being placed transversely, so
  as to allow space for the limbs of the next below in front of him.</p>

  <p>The middle place on each couch was esteemed the most honorable; and the
  middle couch of the three was that assigned to guests of the highest rank,
  the master of the feast, for the most, occupying the central position on the
  third or left hand sofa. The slaves stood round the outer circuit of the
  whole, with the cupbearers; but the carver, and steward, if he might so be
  termed, occupied that side of the table which was left open to their
  attendance.</p>

  <p>On this occasion, there being but six guests in all, each gentleman
  assisted the lady under his charge to recline, with her head comfortably
  elevated, near the centre of the couch; and then took his station behind her,
  so that, if she leaned back, her head would rest on his bosom, while he was
  enabled himself to reach the table, and help himself or his fair partner, as
  need might be, to the delicacies offered in succession.</p>

  <p>Curius and Fulvia, he as of senatorial rank, and she as a noble matron,
  occupied the highest places; Paullus and Lucia reclined on the right hand
  couch, and Catiline with Orestilla in his bosom, as the phrase ran, on the
  left.</p>

  <p>No sooner were they all placed, and the due libation made of wine, with an
  offering of salt, to the domestic Gods&mdash;a silver group of statues
  occupying the centre of the board, where we should now place the
  <i>plateau</i> and <i>epergne</i>, than a louder burst of music ushered in
  three beautiful female slaves, in succinct tunics, like that seen in the
  sculptures of Diana, with half the bosom bare, dancing and singing, and
  carrying garlands in their hands of roses and myrtle, woven with strips of
  the philyra, or inner bark of the linden tree, which was believed to be a
  specific against intoxication. Circling around the board, in time to the soft
  music, they crowned each of the guests, and sprinkled with rich perfumes the
  garments and the hair of each; and then with more animated and eccentric
  gestures, as the note of the flute waxed shriller and more piercing, they
  bounded from the banquet hall, and were succeeded by six boys with silver
  basins, full of tepid water perfumed with costly essences, and soft
  embroidered napkins, which they handed to every banqueter to wash the hands
  before eating.</p>

  <p>This done, the music died away into a low faint close, and was silent; and
  in the hush that followed, an aged slave bore round a mighty flask of Chian
  wine, diluted with snow water, and replenished the goblets of stained glass,
  which stood beside each guest; while another dispensed bread from a lordly
  basket of wrought gilded scroll work.</p>

  <p>And now the feast commenced, in earnest; as the first course, consisting
  of fresh eggs boiled hard, with lettuce, radishes, endive and rockets, olives
  of Venafrum, anchovies and sardines, and the choicest luxury of the
  day&mdash;hot sausages served upon gridirons of silver, with the rich gravy
  dripping through the bars upon a sauce of Syrian prunes and pomegranate
  berries&mdash;was placed upon the board.</p>

  <p>For a time there was little conversation beyond the ordinary courtesies of
  the table, and such trifling jests as were suggested by occurrences of the
  moment. Yet still in the few words that passed from time to time, Paullus
  continued often to convey his sentiments to Lucia in words of double meaning;
  keenly marked, it is true, but seemingly unobserved by the wily plotter
  opposite; and more than once in handing her the goblet, or loading her plate
  with dainties, he took an opportunity again and again of pressing her not
  unwilling hand. And still at every pressure he caught that soft momentary
  glance, was it of love and passion, or of mere coquetry and girlish
  wantonness, succeeded by the fleeting blush pervading face, neck, arms, and
  bosom.</p>

  <p>Never had Paullus been so wildly fascinated; his heart throbbed and
  bounded as if it would have burst his breast; his head swam with a sort of
  pleasurable dizziness; his eyes were dim and suffused; and he scarce knew
  that he was talking, though he was indeed the life of the whole company,
  voluble, witty, versatile, and at times eloquent, so far as the topics of the
  day gave room for eloquence.</p>

  <p>And now, to the melody of Lydian lutes, two slaves introduced a huge
  silver dish, loaded by the vast brawn of the Umbrian boar, garnished with
  leaves of chervil, and floating in a rich sauce of anchovies, the dregs of
  Coan wine, white pepper, vinegar, and olives. The carver brandished his knife
  in graceful and fantastic gestures, proud of his honorable task; and as he
  plunged it into the savory meat, and the delicious savor rushed up to his
  nostrils, he laid down the blade, spread out his hands in an ecstacy, and
  cried aloud, "ye Gods, how glorious!"</p>

  <p>"Excellent well, my Glycon," cried Curius, delighted with the expressive
  pantomine of the well skilled Greek; "smells it so savory?"</p>

  <p>"I have carved many a boar from Lucania and from Umbria also; to say
  nothing of those from the Laurentian marshes, which are bad, seeing that they
  are fed on reeds only and marsh grass; most noble Curius; and never put I
  knife into such an one as this. There are two inches on it of pure fat,
  softer than marrow. He was fed upon holm acorns, I'll be sworn, and sweet
  chesnuts, and caught in a mild south wind!"</p>

  <p>"Fewer words, you scoundrel," exclaimed Catiline, laughing at the fellow's
  volubility, "and quicker carving, if you wish not to visit the pistrinum. You
  have set Curius' mouth watering, so that he will be sped with longing, before
  you have helped Fulvia and your mistress. Fill up, you knaves, fill up; nay!
  not the Chian now; the Falernian from the Faustian hills, or the Caecuban?
  Which shall it be, my Curius?"</p>

  <p>"The Caecuban, by all the Gods! I hold it the best vintage ever, and yours
  is curious. Besides, the Falernian is too dry to drink before the meat.
  Afterward, if, as Glycon says, the boar hath a flavor of the south, it will
  be excellent, indeed."</p>

  <p>"Are as you as constant, Paullus, in your love for the boar, as these
  other epicures?" cried Fulvia, who, despite the depreciating tone in which
  she spoke, had sent her own plate for a second slice.</p>

  <p>"No! by the Gods! Fulvia," he replied, "I am but a sorry epicure, and I
  love the boar better in his reedy fen, or his wild thicket on the Umbrian
  hills, with his eye glaring red in rage, and his tusks white with foam, than
  girt with condiments and spices upon a golden dish."</p>

  <p>"A strange taste," said Curius, "I had for my part rather meet ten on the
  dining table, than one in the oak woods."</p>

  <p>"Commend me to the boar upon the table likewise," said Catiline; "still,
  with my friend Arvina at my side, and a good boarspear in my hand, I would
  like well to bide the charge of a tusker! It is rare sport, by Hercules!"</p>

  <p>"Wonderful beings you men are," said Fulvia, mincing her words affectedly,
  "ever in search of danger; ever on the alert to kill; to shed blood, even if
  it be your own! by Juno, I cannot comprehend it."</p>

  <p>"I can, I can," cried Lucia, raising her voice for the first time, so that
  it could be heard by any others than her nearest neighbor; "right well can I
  comprehend it; were I a man myself, I feel that I should pant for the battle.
  The triumph would be more than rapture; and strife, for its own sake,
  maddening bliss! Heavens! to see the gladiators wheel and charge; to see
  their swords flash in the sun; and the red blood gush out unheeded; and the
  grim faces flushed and furious; and the eyes greedily devouring the wounds of
  the foeman, but all unconscious of their own; and the play of the muscular
  strong limbs; and the terrible death grapple! And then the dull hissing sound
  of the death stroke; and the voiceless parting of the bold spirit! Ye Gods!
  ye Gods! it is a joy, to live, and almost to die for!"</p>

  <p>Paullus Arvina looked at her in speechless wonder. The eyes so wavering
  and downcast were now fixed, and steady, and burning with a passionate clear
  light; there was a fiery flush on her cheek, not brief and evanescent; her
  ripe red mouth was half open, shewing the snow white teeth biting the lower
  lip in the excitement of her feelings. Her whole form seemed to be dilated
  and more majestic than its wont.</p>

  <p>"Bravo! my girl; well said, my quiet Lucia!" exclaimed Catiline. "I knew
  not that she had so much of mettle in her."</p>

  <p>"You must have thought, then, that I belied my race," replied the girl,
  unblushingly; "for it is whispered that you are my father, and I think
  <i>you</i> have looked on blood, and shed it before now!"</p>

  <p>"Boar's blood, ha! Lucia; but you are blunt and brave to-night. Is it that
  Paullus has inspired you?"</p>

  <p>"Nay! I know not," she replied, half apathetically; "but I do know, that
  if I ever love, it shall be a hero; a man that would rather lie in wait until
  dawn to receive the fierce boar rushing from the brake upon his spear, than
  until midnight to enfold a silly girl in his embrace."</p>

  <p>"Then will you never love me, Lucia," answered Curius.</p>

  <p>"Never, indeed!" said she; "it must be a man whom I will love; and there
  is nothing manly about thee, save thy vices!"</p>

  <p>"It is for those that most people love me," replied Curius, nothing
  disconcerted. "Now Cato has nothing of the man about him but the virtues; and
  I should like to know who ever thought of loving Cato."</p>

  <p>"I never heard of any body loving Cato," said Fulvia, quietly.</p>

  <p>"But I have," answered the girl, almost fiercely; "none of <i>you</i> love
  him; nor do I love him; because he is too high and noble, to be dishonored by
  the love of such as I am; but all the good, and great, and generous, do love
  him, and will love his memory for countless ages! I would to God, I could
  love him!"</p>

  <p>"What fury has possessed her?" whispered Catiline to Orestilla; "what ails
  her to talk thus? first to proclaim herself my daughter, and now to praise
  Cato?"</p>

  <p>"Do not ask me!" replied Aurelia in the same tone; "she was a strange girl
  ever; and I cannot say, if she likes this task that you have put upon
  her."</p>

  <p>"More wine, ho! bring more wine! Drink we each man to his mistress, each
  lady to her lover in secrecy and silence!" cried the master of the revel.
  "Fill up! fill up! let it be pure, and sparkling to the brim."</p>

  <p>But Fulvia, irritated a little by what had passed, would not be silent;
  although she saw that Catiline was annoyed at the character the conversation
  had assumed, and ere the slave had filled up the beakers she addressed
  Lucia&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And wherefore, dearest, would you love Cato? I could as soon love the
  statue of Accius Naevius, with his long beard, on the steps of the Comitium;
  he were scarce colder, or less comely than your Cato."</p>

  <p>"Because to love virtue is still something, if we be vicious even; and, if
  I am not virtuous myself, at least I have not lost the sense that it were
  good to be so!"</p>

  <p>"I never knew that you were not virtuous, my Lucia," interposed her
  mother; "affectionate and pious you have ever been."</p>

  <p>"And obedient!" added Catiline, with strong emphasis. "Your mother, my
  Lucia, and myself, return thanks to the Gods daily for giving us so good a
  child."</p>

  <p>"Do you?" replied the girl, scornfully; "the Gods must have merry times,
  then, for that must needs make them laugh! But good or bad, I respect the
  great; and, if I ever love, it will be, as I said, a great and a good
  man."</p>

  <p>"I fear you will never love me, Lucia," whispered Paullus in her ear,
  unheard amid the clash of knives and flagons, and the pealing of a fresh
  strain of music, which ushered in the king of fish, the grand conger,
  garnished with prawns and soused in pungent sauce.</p>

  <p>"Wherefore not?" she replied, meeting his eye with a furtive sidelong
  glance.</p>

  <p>"Because I, for one, had rather watch till midnight fifty times, in the
  hope only of clasping Lucia, once, in my embrace; than once until dawn, to
  kill fifty boars of Umbria."</p>

  <p>She made no answer; but looked up into his face as if to see whether he
  was in earnest, with an affectionate and pleading glance; and then pressed
  her unsandalled foot against his. A moment or two afterward, he perceived the
  embroidered table cover had been drawn up, with the intent of protecting her
  dress from the sauces of the fish which she was eating, in such a manner as
  to conceal the greater part of her person.</p>

  <p>Observing this, and excited beyond all restraint of ordinary prudence, by
  the consciousness of her manner, he profited by the chance to steal his arm
  about her waist; and to his surprise, almost as much as his delight, he felt
  his hand clasped instantly in hers, and pressed upon her throbbing heart.</p>

  <p>The blood gushed like molten fire through his veins. The fascinations of
  the siren had prevailed. The voice of the charmer had been heard, charming
  him but too wisely. And for the moment, fool that he was, he fancied he loved
  Lucia, and his own pure and innocent and lovely Julia was forgotten!
  Forgotten, and for whom!</p>

  <p>Catiline had not lost one word, one movement of the young couple; and he
  perceived, that, although there was clearly something at work in the girl's
  bosom which he did not comprehend, she had at least obeyed his commands in
  captivating Paullus; and he now doubted not but she would persevere, from
  vanity or passion, and bind him down a fettered captive to her will.</p>

  <p>Determined to lose nothing by want of exertion, the traitor circulated now
  the fiery goblet as fast as possible, till every brain was heated more or
  less, and every cheek flushed, even of the women, by the inspiring influence
  of the wine cup.</p>

  <p>All dainties that were known in those days ministered to his feast;
  oysters from Baiae; pheasants&mdash;a rarity but lately introduced, since
  Pompey's conquests in the east&mdash;had been brought all the way from Phasis
  upon the southern shores of the Black Sea; and woodcock from the valleys of
  Ionia, and the watery plains of Troas, to load the tables of the luxurious
  masters of the world. Livers of geese, forced to an unnatural size by
  cramming the unhappy bird with figs; and turbot fricasseed in cream, and
  peacocks stuffed with truffles, were on the board of Catiline that day, as on
  the boards of many another noble Roman; and the wines by which these rare
  dainties were diluted, differed but little, as wisest critics say, from the
  madeiras and the sherries of the nineteenth century. For so true is it, that
  under the sun there is nothing new, that in the <i>foix gras</i> of
  Strasburg, in the <i>turbot  la crme</i>, and in the <i>dindons aux
  truffes</i> of the French metropolis, the gastronomes of modern days have
  only reproduced the dishes, whereon Lucullus and Hortensius feasted before
  the Christian era.</p>

  <p>The day passed pleasantly to all, but to Paullus Arvina it flew like a
  dream, like a delirious trance, from which, could he have consulted his own
  will, he would never have awakened.</p>

  <p>With the dessert, and the wine cup, the myrtle branch and the lute went
  round, and songs were warbled by sweet voices, full of seductive thoughts and
  words of passion. At length the lamps were lighted, and the women arose to
  quit the hall, leaving the ruder sex to prolong the revel; but as Lucia rose,
  she again pressed the fingers of Arvina, and whispered a request that he
  would see her once more ere he left the house.</p>

  <p>He promised; but as he did so, his heart sank within him; for dearly as he
  wished it, he believed he had promised that which would prove impossible.</p>

  <p>But in a little while, chance, as he thought it, favored him; for seeing
  that he refused the wine cup, Catiline, after rallying him some time, good
  humoredly said with a laugh, "Come, my Arvina, we must not be too hard on
  you. You have but a young head, though a stout one. Curius and I are old
  veterans of the camp, old revellers, and love the wine cup better than the
  bright eyes of beauty, or the minstrel's lute. Thou, I will swear it, wouldst
  rather now be listening to Lucia's lyre, and may be fingering it thyself,
  than drinking with us roisterers! Come, never blush, boy, we were all young
  once! Confess, if I am right! The women you will find, if you choose to seek
  them, in the third chamber on the left, beyond the inner peristyle. We all
  love freedom here; nor are we rigid censors. Curius and I will drain a flagon
  or two more, and then join you."</p>

  <p>Muttering something not very comprehensible about his exertions in the
  morning, and his inability to drink any more, Paullus arose, delighted to
  effect his escape on terms so easy, and left the triclinium immediately in
  quest of his mistress.</p>

  <p>As he went out, Catiline burst into one of his sneering laughs, and
  exclaimed, "He is in; by Pan, the hunter's God! he is in the death-toil
  already! May I perish ill, if he escape it."</p>

  <p>"Why, in the name of all the Gods, do you take so much pains with him,"
  said Curius; "he is a stout fellow, and I dare say a brave one; and will make
  a good legionary, or an officer perhaps; but he is raw, and a fool to
  boot!"</p>

  <p>"Raw, but no fool! I can assure you," answered Catiline; "no more a fool
  than I am. And we must have him, he is necessary!"</p>

  <p>"He will be necessary soon to that girl of yours; she has gone mad, I
  think, for love of him. I never did believe in philtres; but this is well
  nigh enough to make one do so."</p>

  <p>"Pshaw!" answered Catiline; "it is thou that art raw now, and a fool,
  Curius. She is no more in love with him than thou art; it was all
  acting&mdash;right good acting: for it did once well nigh deceive me who
  devised it; but still, only acting. I ordered her to win him at all
  hazards."</p>

  <p>"At all hazards?"</p>

  <p>"Aye! at <i>all</i>."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would give her the like orders touching me, if she obey so
  readily."</p>

  <p>"I would, if it were necessary; which it is not. First, because I have you
  as firmly mine, as need be; and secondly, because Fulvia would have her
  heart's blood ere two days had gone, and that would ill suit me; for the sly
  jade is useful."</p>

  <p>"Take care she prove not too sly for you, Sergius. She may obey your
  orders in this thing; but she does so right willingly. She loves the boy, I
  tell you, as madly as Venus loved Adonis, or Phaedra Hyppolitus; she would
  pursue him if he fled from her."</p>

  <p>"She loves him no more than she loves the musty statue of my stout
  grandsire, Sergius Silo."</p>

  <p>"You will see one day. Meanwhile, look that she fool you not."</p>

  <p>While they were speaking, Paullus had reached the entrance of the chamber
  indicated; and, opening the door, had entered, expecting to find the three
  women assembled at some feminine sport or occupation. But fortune again
  favored him&mdash;opportune fortune!</p>

  <p>For Lucia was alone, expecting him, prepared for his entrance at any
  moment; yet, when he came, how unprepared, how shocked, how terrified!</p>

  <p>For she had unclasped her stola upon both her shoulders, and suffered it
  to fall down to her girdle which kept it in its place about her hips. But
  above those she was dressed only in a tunic of that loose fabric, a sort of
  silken gauze, which was called woven air, and was beginning to be worn very
  much by women of licentious character; this dress&mdash;if that indeed could
  be called a dress, which displayed all the outlines of the shape, all the
  hues of the glowing skin every minute blue vein that meandered over the
  lovely bosom&mdash;was wrought in alternate stripes of white and silver; and
  nothing can be imagined more beautiful than the effect of its
  semi-transparent veil concealing just enough to leave some scope for the
  imagination, displaying more than enough for the most prodigal of beauty.</p>

  <p>She was employed in dividing her long jet-black hair with a comb of
  mother-of-pearl as he entered; but she dropped both the hair and comb, and
  started to her feet with a simulated scream, covering her beautiful bust with
  her two hands, as if she had been taken absolutely by surprise.</p>

  <p>But Paullus had been drinking freely, and Paullus saw, moreover, that she
  was not offended; and, if surprised, surprised not unpleasantly by his
  coming.</p>

  <p>He sprang forward, caught her in his arms, and clasping her to his bosom
  almost smothered her with kisses. But shame on her, fast and furiously as he
  kissed, she kissed as closely back.</p>

  <p>"Lucia, sweet Lucia, do you then love me?"</p>

  <p>"More than my life&mdash;more than my country&mdash;more than the Gods! my
  brave, my noble Paullus."</p>

  <p>"And will you then be mine&mdash;all mine, my Lucia?"</p>

  <p>"Yours, Paul?" she faltered, panting as if with agitation upon his bosom;
  "am I not yours already? but no, no, no!" she exclaimed, tearing herself from
  his embrace. "No no! I had forgotten. My father! no; I cannot, my
  father!"</p>

  <p>"What mean you, Lucia? your father? What of your father?"</p>

  <p>"You are his enemy. You have discovered, will betray him."</p>

  <p>"No, by the great Gods! you are mad, Lucia. I have discovered nothing; nor
  if I knew him to be the slayer of my father, would I betray him! never,
  never!"</p>

  <p>"Will you swear <i>that</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Swear what?"</p>

  <p>"Never, whatever you may learn, to betray him to any living man: never to
  carry arms, or give evidence against him; but faithfully and stedfastly to
  follow him through virtue and through vice, in life and unto death; to live
  for him, and die with him, unless I release you of your oath and restore you
  to freedom, which I will never do!"</p>

  <p>"By all the powers of light and darkness! by Jupiter Omnipotent, and Pluto
  the Avenger, I swear, Lucia! May I and all my house, and all whom I love or
  cherish, wretchedly perish if I fail you."</p>

  <p>"Then I am yours," she sighed; "all, and for ever!" and sank into his
  arms, half fainting with the violence of that prolonged excitement.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch107"
     name="ch107"></a>VII. &mdash; THE OATH</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>Into what dangers would you lead me,
     Cassius?</i> &mdash;Julius Caesar.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE evening had worn on to a late hour, and darkness had
  already fallen over the earth, when Paullus issued stealthily, like a guilty
  thing, from Lucia's chamber. No step or sound had come near the door, no
  voice had called on either, though they had lingered there for hours in
  endearments, which, as he judged the spirit of his host, would have cost him
  his life, if suspected; and though he never dreamed of connivance, he did
  think it strange that a man so wary and suspicious as Catiline was held to
  be, should have so fallen from his wonted prudence, as to betray his adopted
  daughter's honor by granting this most fatal opportunity.</p>

  <p>He met no member of the family in the dim-lighted peristyle; the passages
  were silent and deserted; no gay domestic circle was collected in the
  tablinum, no slaves were waiting in the atrium; and, as he stole forth
  cautiously with guarded footsteps, Arvina almost fancied that he had been
  forgotten; and that the master of the house believed him to have retired when
  he left the dining hall.</p>

  <p>It was not long, however, before he was undeceived; for as he entered the
  vestibule, and was about to lay his hand on the lock of the outer door, a
  tall dark figure, which he recognized instantly to be that of his host,
  stepped forward from a side-passage, and stretched out his arm in silence,
  forbidding him, by that imperious gesture, to proceed.</p>

  <p>"Ha! you have tarried long," he said in a deep guarded whisper, "our Lucia
  truly is a most soft and fascinating creature; you found her so, is it not
  true, my Paullus?"</p>

  <p>There was something singular in the manner in which these words were
  uttered, half mocking, and half serious; something between a taunting and
  triumphant assertion of a fact, and a bitter question; but nothing that
  betokened anger or hostility, or offended pride in the speaker.</p>

  <p>Still Paullus was so much taken by surprise, and so doubtful of his
  entertainer's meaning, and the extent of his knowledge, that he remained
  speechless in agitated and embarrassed silence.</p>

  <p>"What, have the girl's kisses clogged your lips, so that they can give out
  no sound? By the gods! they were close enough to do so."</p>

  <p>"Catiline!" he exclaimed, starting back in astonishment, and half
  expecting to feel a dagger in his bosom.</p>

  <p>"Tush! tush! young man&mdash;think you the walls in the house of Catiline
  have no ears, nor eyes? Paullus Arvina, I know all!"</p>

  <p>"All?" faltered the youth, now utterly aghast.</p>

  <p>"Ay, all!" replied the conspirator, with a harsh triumphant laugh. "Lucia
  has given herself to you; and you have sold yourself to Catiline! By all the
  fiends of Hades, better it were for you, rash boy, that you had ne'er been
  born, than now to fail me!"</p>

  <p>Arvina, trembling with the deep consciousness of hospitality betrayed, and
  feeling the first stings of remorse already, stood thunderstricken, and
  unable to articulate.</p>

  <p>"Speak!" thundered Catiline; "speak! art thou not mine&mdash;mine soul and
  body&mdash;sworn to be mine forever?"</p>

  <p>Alas! the fatal oath, sworn in the heat of passion, flashed on his soul,
  and he answered humbly, and in a faint low voice, how different from his
  wonted tones of high and manly confidence&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I am sworn, Catiline!"</p>

  <p>"See then that thou be not forsworn. Little thou dream'st yet, unto what
  thou art sworn, or unto whom; but know this, that hell itself, with all its
  furies, would fall short of the tortures that await the traitor!"</p>

  <p>"I am, at least, no traitor!"</p>

  <p>"No! traitor! Ha!" cried Catiline, "is it an honest deed to creep into the
  bosom of a daughter of the house which entertained thee as a
  friend!&mdash;No! Traitor&mdash;ha! ha! ha! thou shalt ere long learn
  better&mdash;ha! ha! ha!"</p>

  <p>And he laughed with the fearful sneering mirth, which was never excited in
  his breast, but by things perilous and terrible and hateful. In a moment,
  however, he repressed his merriment, and added&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Give me that poniard thou didst wear this morning. It is mine."</p>

  <p>"Thine!" cried the unhappy youth, starting back, as if he had received a
  blow; "thine, Catiline!"</p>

  <p>"Aye!" he replied, in a hoarse voice, looking into the very eyes of Paul.
  "I am the slayer of the slave, and regret only that I slew him without
  torture. Know you whose slave he was, by any chance?"</p>

  <p>"He was the Consul's slave," answered Arvina, almost
  mechanically&mdash;for he was utterly bewildered by all that had
  passed&mdash;"Medon, my freedman Thrasea's cousin."</p>

  <p>"The Consul's, ha!&mdash;which Consul's? speak! fool! speak, ere I tear it
  from your throat; Cicero's, ha?"</p>

  <p>"Cicero's, Catiline!"</p>

  <p>"Here is a coil; and knows he of this matter? I mean Cicero."</p>

  <p>"He knows it."</p>

  <p>"That is to say, you told him. Aye! this morning, after I spoke with you.
  I comprehend; and you shewed him the poniard. So! so! so! Well, give it to
  me; I will tell you what to do, hereafter."</p>

  <p>"I have it not with me, Sergius," he replied, thoroughly daunted and
  dismayed.</p>

  <p>"See that you meet me then, bringing it with you, at Egeria's cave, as
  fools call it, in the valley of Muses, at the fourth hour of night to-morrow.
  In the meantime, beware that you tell no man aught of this, nor that the
  instrument was bought of Volero. Ha! dost thou hear me?"</p>

  <p>"I hear, Catiline."</p>

  <p>"And wilt obey?"</p>

  <p>"And will obey."</p>

  <p>"So shall it go well with thee, and we shall be fast friends forever. Good
  repose to thee, good my Paullus."</p>

  <p>"And Lucia?" he replied, but in a voice of inquiry; for all that he had
  heard of the tremendous passions and vindictive fury of the conspirator,
  flashed on his mind, and he fancied that he knew not what of vengeance would
  fall on the head of the soft beauty.</p>

  <p>"Hath played her part rarely!" answered the monster, as he dismissed him
  from the door, which he opened with his own hand. "Be true, and you shall see
  her when you will; betray us, and both you and she shall live in agonies,
  that shall make you call upon death fifty times, ere he relieve you."</p>

  <p>And with a menacing gesture, he closed and barred the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"Played her part rarely!" The words sank down into his soul with a
  chilling weight, that seemed to crush every energy and hope. Played her part!
  Then he was a dupe&mdash;the very dupe of the fiend's arch mock, to lip a
  wanton, and believe her chaste&mdash;the dupe of a designing harlot; the
  sworn tool and slave of a murderer&mdash;a monster, who had literally sold
  his own child's honor. For all the world well knew, that, although Lucia
  passed for his adopted daughter only, she was his natural offspring by
  Aurelia Orestilla, before their impious marriage.</p>

  <p>Well might he gnash his teeth, and beat his breast, and tear his dark hair
  by handfulls from his head; well might he groan and curse.</p>

  <p>But oh! the inconsistency of man! While he gave vent to all the anguish of
  his rage in curses against her, the soft partner of his guilt, and at the
  same time, its avenger; against the murderer and the traitor, now his tyrant;
  he utterly forgot that his own dereliction, from the paths of rectitude and
  honor, had led him into the dark toils, in which he now seemed involved
  beyond any hope of extrication.</p>

  <p>He forgot, that to satisfy an insane and unjustifiable love of adventure,
  and a false curiosity, he had associated himself with a man whom he believed,
  if he did not actually know, to be infamous and capable of any crime.</p>

  <p>He forgot, that, admitted into that man's house in friendship, he had
  attempted to undermine his daughter's honor; and had felt no remorse, till he
  learned that his success was owing to connivance&mdash;that his own treason
  had been met and repaid by deeper treason.</p>

  <p>He forgot, that for a wanton's love, he had betrayed the brightest, and
  the purest being that drew the breath of life, from the far Alps, to the blue
  waters of the far Tarentum&mdash;that he had broken his soul's plighted
  faith&mdash;that he was himself, first, a liar, perjurer, and villain.</p>

  <p>Alas! it is the inevitable consequence, the first fruit, as it were, of
  crime, that guilt is still prolific; that the commission of the first ill
  deed, leads almost surely to the commission of a second, of a third, until
  the soul is filed and the heart utterly corrupted, and the wretch given
  wholly up to the dominion of foul sin, and plunged into thorough
  degradation.</p>

  <p>Arvina had thought lightly, if at all, of his first luxurious sin, but now
  to the depth of his secret soul, he felt that he was emmeshed and entangled
  in the deepest villainy.</p>

  <p>All that he ever had yet heard hinted darkly or surmised of Catiline's
  gigantic schemes of wickedness, rushed on him, all at once! He doubted
  nothing any longer; it was clear to him as noonday; distinct and definite as
  if it had been told to him in so many words; the treason to the state
  concealed by individual murder; and he, a sworn accomplice&mdash;nay, a sworn
  slave to this murderer and traitor!</p>

  <p>Nor was this all; his peril was no less than his guilt; equal on either
  side&mdash;sure ruin if he should be true to his country, and scarce less
  sure, if he should join its parricides. For, though he had not dared say so
  much to Catiline, he had already sent the poniard to the house of Cicero, and
  a brief letter indicating all that he had learned from Volero. This he had
  done in the interval between the Campus and his unlucky visit to the house of
  Catiline, whom he then little deemed to be the man of whom he was in
  quest.</p>

  <p>Doubtless, ere this time, the cutler had been summoned to the consul's
  presence, and the chief magistrate of the Republic had learned that the
  murderer of his slave was the very person, whom he had bound himself by
  oaths, so strong that he shuddered at the very thought of them, to support
  and defend to the utmost.</p>

  <p>What was he then to do? how to proceed, since to recede appeared
  impossible?</p>

  <p>How was he to account to the conspirator for his inability to produce the
  poniard at their appointed meeting? how should he escape the pursuit of his
  determined vengeance, if he should shun the meeting?</p>

  <p>And then, Lucia! The recollection, guilty and degraded as he knew her to
  be, of her soft blandishments, of her rare beauty, of her wild and
  inexplicable manner, adding new charms to that forbidden bliss, yet thrilled
  in every sense. And must he give her up? No! madness was in the very thought!
  so strangely had she spread her fascinations round him. And yet did he love
  her? no! perish the thought! Love is a high, a holy, a pure feeling&mdash;the
  purest our poor fallen nature is capable of experiencing; no! this fierce,
  desperate, guilty passion was no more like true love, than the whirlwind that
  upheaves the tortured billows, and hurls the fated vessel on the treacherous
  quicksands, is like to the beneficent and gentle breeze that speeds it to the
  haven of its hopes, in peace and honor.</p>

  <p>After a little while consumed in anxious and uneasy thoughts, he
  determined&mdash;as cowards of the mind determine ever&mdash;to temporise, to
  await events, to depend upon the tide of circumstance. He would, he thought,
  keep the appointment with his master&mdash;for such he felt that Catiline now
  was indeed&mdash;however he might strive to conceal the fact; endeavor to
  learn what were his real objects; and then determine what should be his own
  course of action. Doubtful, and weak of principle, and most infirm of
  purpose, he shrunk alike from breaking the oath he had been entrapped into
  taking, and from committing any crime against his country.</p>

  <p>His country!&mdash;To the Roman, patriotism stood for
  religion!&mdash;Pride, habit, education, honor, interest, all were combined
  in that word, country; and could he be untrue to Rome? His better spirit
  cried out, no! from every nerve and artery of his body. And then his evil
  genius whispered Lucia, and he wavered.</p>

  <p>Meantime, had no thought crossed him of his own pure and noble Julia,
  deserted thus and overlooked for a mere wanton? Many times! many times, that
  day, had his mind reverted to her. When first he went to Cataline's house, he
  went with the resolution of leaving it at an early hour, so soon as the feast
  should be over, and seeking her, while there should yet be time to ramble
  among the flower-beds on the hill of gardens, or perchance, to drive out in
  his chariot, which he had ordered to be held in readiness, toward the falls
  of the Anio, or on the proud Emilian way.</p>

  <p>Afterward, in the whirl of his mad intoxication for the fascinating Lucia,
  all memory of his true love was lost, as the chaste moon-light may be dimmed
  and drowned for a while by the red glare of the torches, brandished in some
  licentious orgy. Nor did he think of her again, till he found himself
  saddened, and self-disgusted, plunged into peril&mdash;perhaps into ruin, by
  his own guilty conduct; and then, when he did think, it was with remorse, and
  self-reproach, and consciousness of disloyalty, so bitterly and keenly
  painful&mdash;yet unaccompanied by that repentance, which steadily envisages
  past wrong, and determines to amend in future&mdash;that he shook off the
  recollection, whenever it returned, with wilful stubbornness; and resolved on
  forgetting, for the present, the being whom a few short hours before, he
  would have deemed it impossible that he should ever think of but with joy and
  rapturous anticipation.</p>

  <p>Occupied in these fast succeeding moods and fancies, Paullus had made his
  way homeward from the house of Catiline, so far as to the Cerolian place, at
  the junction of the Sacred Way and the Carinae. He paused here a moment; and
  grasping his fevered brow with his hand, recalled to mind the strange
  occurrences, most unexpected and unfortunate, which had befallen him, since
  he stood there that morning; each singly trivial; each, unconnected as it
  seemed with the rest, and of little moment; yet all, when united, forming a
  chain of circumstances by which he was now fettered hand and foot&mdash;his
  casual interview with Catiline on the hill; his subsequent encounter of
  Victor and Aristius Fuscus; the recognition of his dagger by the stout cutler
  Volero; the death of Varus in the hippodrome; his own victorious exercises on
  the plain; the invitation to the feast; the sumptuous banquet; and last,
  alas! and most fatal, the too voluptuous and seductive Lucia.</p>

  <p>Just at this moment, the doors of Cicero's stately mansion were thrown
  open, and a long train came sweeping out in dark garments, with blazing
  torches, and music doleful and piercing. And women chanting the shrill
  funereal strain. And then, upon a bier covered with black, the rude wooden
  coffin, peculiar to the slave, of the murdered Medon! Behind him followed the
  whole household of the Consul; and last, to the extreme astonishment of
  Paullus, preceded by his lictors, and leaning on the arm of his most faithful
  freedman, came Cicero himself, doing unusual honor, for some cause known to
  himself alone, to the manes of his slaughtered servant.</p>

  <p>As they passed on toward the Capuan gate of the city, the Consul's eyes
  fell directly on the form of Arvina, where he stood revealed in the full
  glare of the torch-light; and as he recognised him, he made a sign that he
  should join him, which, under those peculiar circumstances, he felt that he
  could not refuse to do.</p>

  <p>Sadly and silently they swept through the splendid streets, and under the
  arched gate, and filed along the celebrated Appian way, passing the tomb of
  the proud Scipios on the left hand, with its superb sarcophagi&mdash;for that
  great house had never, from time immemorial, been wont to burn their
  dead&mdash;and on the right, a little farther on, the noble temple and the
  sacred slope of Mars, and the old statue of the god which had once sweated
  blood, prescient of Thrasymene. On they went, frightening the echoes of the
  quiet night with their wild lamentations and the clapping of their hands,
  sending the glare of their funereal torches far and wide through the cultured
  fields and sacred groves and rich gardens, until they reached at length the
  pile, hard by the columbarium, or slave-burying-place of Cicero's
  household.</p>

  <p>Then, the rites performed duly, the dust thrice sprinkled on the body, and
  the farewell pronounced, the corpse was laid upon the pile, and the tall
  spire of blood-red flame went up, wavering and streaming through the night,
  rich with perfumes, and gums, and precious ointment, so noble was the
  liberality of the good Consul, even in the interment of his more faithful
  slaves.</p>

  <p>No words were uttered to disturb the sound of the ceremony, until the
  flames died out, and, the smouldering embers quenched with wine, Thrasea, as
  the nearest relative of the deceased, gathered the ashes and inurned them,
  when they were duly labelled and consigned to their niche in the columbarium;
  and then, the final <i>Ilicet</i> pronounced, the sad solemnity was
  ended.</p>

  <p>Then, though not until then, did Cicero address the young man; but then,
  as if to make up for his previous silence, he made him walk by his side all
  the way back to the city, conversing with him eagerly about all that had
  passed, thanking him for the note and information he had sent concerning
  Volero, and anticipating the immediate discovery of the perpetrators of that
  horrid crime.</p>

  <p>"I have not had the leisure to summon Volero before me," he added. "I
  wished also that you, Arvina, should be present when I examine him. I judge
  that it will be best, when we shall have dismissed all these, except the
  lictors, to visit him this very night. He is a thrifty and laborious artisan,
  and works until late by lamp light; we will go thither, if you have naught to
  hinder you, at once."</p>

  <p>Arvina could do no otherwise than assent; but his heart beat violently,
  and he could scarcely frame his words, so dreadful was his agitation. Yet, by
  dint of immense exertion, he contrived to maintain the outward appearance of
  composure, which he was very far from feeling, and even to keep up a
  connected conversation as they walked along. Returning home at a much quicker
  pace than they had gone out, it was comparatively but a short time before
  they arrived at the house of Cicero, and there dismissed their followers,
  many of the slaves and freedmen of Arvina having joined the procession in
  honour of their fellow-servant Thrasea.</p>

  <p>Thence, reserving two lictors only of the twelve, the consul with his
  wonted activity hurried directly forward by the Sacred Way to the arch of
  Fabius; and then, as the young men had gone in the morning, through the Forum
  toward the cutler's shop, taking the shortest way, and evidently well
  acquainted with the spot beforehand.</p>

  <p>"I caused the funeral to take place this night," he said to Arvina,
  "instead of waiting the due term of eight days, on purpose that I might
  create no suspicion in the minds of the slayers. They never will suspect him,
  we have buried even now, to be the man they slew last night, and will fancy,
  it may be, that the body is not discovered even."</p>

  <p>"It will be well if it prove so," replied Paullus, feeling that he must
  say something, and fearful of committing himself by many words.</p>

  <p>"It will, and I think probably it may," answered Cicero. "But see, I was
  right; there shines the light from Volero's shop, though all the other booths
  have been closed long ago, and the streets are already silent. There are but
  few men, even in this great city, of whom I know not something, beyond the
  mere names. Think upon that, young man, and learn to do likewise; cultivate
  memory, above all things, except virtue."</p>

  <p>"I should have thought such things too mean to occupy a place, even, in
  the mind of Cicero," answered Arvina.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, young man, that pertains to our fellow men, is too mean to
  occupy the mind of the noblest. Why should it, since it doth occupy the mind
  of the Gods, who are all great and omnipotent?"</p>

  <p>"You lean not then to the creed of Epicurus, which
  teaches&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who, I?" interrupted Cicero, almost indignantly. "No! by the immortal
  Gods! nor I trust, my young friend, do you. Believe me&mdash;but ha!" he
  added in a quick and altered tone, "what have we here? there is some villainy
  in the wind&mdash;away! away! there! lictors apprehend that fellow."</p>

  <p>For as they came within about a bow-shot of the booth of Volero, the sound
  of a slight scuffle was heard from within, and the light of the lamp became
  very dim and wavering, as if it had been overset; and in a moment went out
  altogether. But its last glimmering ray shewed a tall sinewy figure making
  out of the door and bounding at a great pace up the street toward the
  Carmental gate.</p>

  <p>Arvina caught but a momentary glance of the figure; yet was that glance
  enough. He recognized the spare but muscular form, all brawn and bone and
  sinew; he recognized the long and pardlike bounds!&mdash;It was his tyrant,
  and, as he thought, his Fate!</p>

  <p>The lictors rushed away upon his track, but there seemed little chance
  that, encumbered with their heavy fasces, they would overtake so swift a
  runner, as, by the momentary sight they had of him, the fugitive appeared to
  be.</p>

  <p>Arvina and the Consul speedily reached the booth.</p>

  <p>"Volero! Volero!"</p>

  <p>But there came forth no answer.</p>

  <p>"Volero! what ho! Volero!"</p>

  <p>They listened eagerly, painfully, with ears sharpened by excitement. There
  came a sound&mdash;a plash, as of a heavy drop of water falling on the stone
  floor; another, and another&mdash;the trickling of a continuous stream.</p>

  <p>All was dark as a moonless midnight. Yet Cicero took one step forward, and
  laid his hand upon the counter. It splashed into a pool of some warm
  liquid.</p>

  <p>"Now may the Gods avert!" he cried, "It is blood! there has been murder
  here! Run, my Arvina, run to Furbo's cookshop, across the way there,
  opposite; they sit up there all night&mdash;cry murder, ho! help!
  murder!"</p>

  <p>A minute had scarcely passed before the heavy knocking of the young man
  had aroused the house&mdash;the neighborhood. And at the cry of murder, many
  men, some who had not retired for the night, and some half dressed as they
  had sprung up from their couches, came rushing with their weapons, snatched
  at random, and with torches in their hands.</p>

  <p>It was but too true! the laborious artizan was dead; murdered, that
  instant, at his own counter, at his very work. He had not moved or risen from
  his seat, but had fallen forward with his head upon the board; and from
  beneath the head was oozing in a continuous stream the dark red blood, which
  had overflowed the counter, and trickled down, and made the paved floor one
  great pool!</p>

  <p>"Ye Gods! what blood! what blood!" exclaimed the first who came in.</p>

  <p>"Poor Volero! alas!" cried Furbo, "it is not an hour since he supped on a
  pound of sausages at my table, and now, all is over!"</p>

  <p>They raised his head. His eyes were wide open; and the whole face bore an
  expression neither of agony or terror, so much as of wild surprise.</p>

  <p>The throat was cut from ear to ear, dividing the windpipe, the carotid
  arteries and jugular veins on both sides; and so strong had been the hand of
  the assassin, and so keen the weapon, that the neck was severed quite to the
  back bone.</p>

  <p>Among the spectators was a gladiator; he whose especial task it was to cut
  the throats of the conquered victims on the arena; he looked eagerly and
  curiously at the wound for a moment, and then said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"A back stroke from behind&mdash;a strong hand, and a broadbacked
  knife&mdash;the man has been slain by a gladiator, or one who knows the
  gladiator's trick!"</p>

  <p>"The man," said the Consul calmly, "has been killed by an acquaintance, a
  friend, or a familiar customer; he had not even risen from his seat to speak
  with him; and see, the burnisher is yet grasped in his hand, with which he
  was at work. Ha!" he exclaimed, as his lictors entered, panting and tired by
  their fruitless chase, "could you not overtake him?"</p>

  <p>"We never saw him any more, my consul," replied both men in one
  breath.</p>

  <p>"Let his head down, my friend," said Cicero, turning, much disappointed as
  it seemed, to Furbo, "let it lie, as it was when we found it; clear the shop,
  lictors; take the names of the witnesses; one of you keep watch at the door,
  until you are relieved; lock it and give the key to the praetor, when he
  shall arrive; the other, go straightway, and summon Cornelius Lentulus; he is
  the praetor for this ward. Go to your homes, my friends, and make no tumult
  in the streets, I pray you. This shall be looked to and avenged; your Consul
  watches over you!"</p>

  <p>"Live! live the Consul! the good Consul, the man of the people!" shouted
  the crowd, as they dispersed quietly to their homes.</p>

  <p>"Arvina, come with me. To whom told you, that you had found, and Volero
  sold, this dagger?" he asked very sternly.</p>

  <p>"To no one, Cicero. Marcus Aurelius Victor, and Aristius Fuscus were with
  me, when he recognized it for his work?"</p>

  <p>"No one else?"</p>

  <p>"No one, save our slaves, and they," he added in a breath, "could not have
  heard what passed."</p>

  <p>"Hath no one else seen it?"</p>

  <p>"As I was stripping for the contests on the Campus, Catiline saw it in my
  girdle, and admired its fabric."</p>

  <p>"Catiline!"</p>

  <p>"Ay! Consul?"</p>

  <p>"And you told <i>him</i> that Volero had made it?"</p>

  <p>"Consul, no!" But, with the word, he turned as white as marble. Had it
  been daylight, his face had betrayed him; as it was, Cicero observed that his
  voice trembled.</p>

  <p>"Catiline is the man!" he said solemnly, "the man who slew Medon
  yesternight, who has slain Volero now. Catiline is the man; but this craves
  wary walking. Young man, young man, beware! methinks you are on the verge of
  great danger. Get thee home to thy bed; and again I say, Beware!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch108"
     name="ch108"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE TRUE LOVE</h2>

  <p class="cp"
     style="text-align:center"><i>Dear, my Lord, make me acquainted with your
     cause of grief.</i> &mdash;Julius Caesar.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE sun rose clear and bright on the following morning; the
  air was fresh and exhilarating, and full of mirthful inspiration. But Paullus
  Arvina rose unrefreshed and languid, with his mind ill at ease; for the
  reaction which succeeds ever to the reign of any vehement excitement, had
  fallen on him with its depressing weight; and not that only, but keen remorse
  for the past, and, if possible, anxiety yet keener for the future.</p>

  <p>Disastrous dreams had beset his sleeping hours; and, at his waking, they
  and the true occurrences of the past day, seemed all blended and confused
  into one horrible and hideous vision.</p>

  <p>Now he envisaged the whole dark reality of his past conduct, of his
  present situation. Lucia, the charming siren of the previous evening,
  appeared in her real colors, as the immodest, passionate wanton; Catiline as
  the monster that indeed he was!</p>

  <p>And yet, alas! alas! as the clear perception of the truth dawned on him,
  it was but coupled with a despairing sense, that to these he was linked
  inevitably and forever.</p>

  <p>The oath! the awful oath which he had sworn in the fierce whirl of
  passion, registered by the arch-traitor&mdash;the oath involving, not alone,
  his own temporal and eternal welfare, but that of all whom he loved or
  cherished; his own pure, beautiful, inimitable Julia, to whom his heart now
  reverted with a far deeper and more earnest tenderness, after its brief
  inconstancy; as he compared her strong, yet maidenly and gentle love, with
  the wild and ungovernable passions of the wanton, for whom he had once
  sacrificed her.</p>

  <p>Paullus Arvina was not naturally, not radically evil. Far from it, his
  impulses were naturally virtuous and correct, his calm sober thoughts always
  honorable and upright; but his passions were violent and unregulated; his
  principles of conduct not definitively formed; and his mind wavering,
  unsettled, and unsteady.</p>

  <p>His passions on the previous day had betrayed him fatally, through the
  dark machinations of the conspirator, and the strange fascinations of his
  lovely daughter, into the perpetration of a great crime. He had bound
  himself, by an oath too dreadful to be thought of without shuddering, to the
  commission of yet darker crimes in future.</p>

  <p>And now the mists of passion had ceased to bedim his mental vision, his
  eyes were opened, that he saw and repented most sincerely the past guilt. How
  was he to avoid the future?</p>

  <p>To no man in these days, could there be a doubt even for a
  moment&mdash;however great the sin of swearing such an oath! No one in these
  days, knowing and repenting of the crime, would hesitate a moment, or fancy
  himself bound, because he had committed one vile sin in pledging himself thus
  to guilt, to rush on deeper yet into the perpetration of wickedness.</p>

  <p>The sin were in the swearing, not in the breaking of an oath so vile and
  shameful.</p>

  <p>But those were days of dark heathenish superstition, and it was far beyond
  the reach of any intellect perhaps of that day to arrive at a conclusion,
  simple as that to which any mind would now leap, as it were
  instinctively.</p>

  <p>In those days, an omitted rite, an error in the ceremonial tribute paid to
  the marble idol, was held a deeper sin than adultery, incest, or blood
  shedding. And the bare thought of the vengeance due for a broken oath would
  often times keep sleepless, with mere dread, the eyes of men who could have
  slumbered calmly on the commission of the deadliest crimes.</p>

  <p>Such, then, was the state of Arvina's mind on that morning&mdash;grieving
  with deep remorse for the faults of which he confessed himself guilty;
  trembling at the idea of rushing into yet more desperate guilt; and at the
  same time feeling bound to do so, in despite of his better thoughts, by the
  fatal oath which bound him to the arch traitor.</p>

  <p>While he was sitting in his lonely chamber, with his untasted meal of ripe
  figs, and delicate white bread, and milk and honeycomb before him, devouring
  his own heart in his fiery anguish, and striving with all his energies of
  intellect to devise some scheme by which he might escape the perils that
  seemed to hem him round on every side, his faithful freedman entered, bearing
  a little billet, on which his eye had scarcely fallen before he recognized
  the shapely characters of Julia's well-known writing.</p>

  <p>He broke the seal which connected the flaxen band, and with a trembling
  eye, and a soul that feared it knew not what, from the very consciousness of
  guilt, he read as follows:</p>

  <p>"A day has passed, my Paullus, and we have not met! The first day in which
  we have not met and conversed together, since that whereon you asked me to be
  yours! I would not willingly, my Paul, be as those miserable and most foolish
  girls, of whom my mother has informed me, who, given up to jealousy and
  doubt, torment themselves in vain, and alienate the noble spirits, which are
  bound to them by claims of affection only, not of compulsion or restraint.
  Nor am I so unreasonable as to think, that a man has no duties to perform,
  other than to attend a woman's leisure. The Gods forbid it! for whom I love,
  I would see great, and famous, and esteemed in the world's eyes as highly as
  in mine! The house, it is true, is our sphere&mdash;the Forum and the Campus,
  the great world with its toils, its strifes, and its honors, yours! All this
  I speak to myself often. I repeated it many, many times yesterday&mdash;it
  ought to have satisfied me&mdash;it did satisfy my reason, Paul, but it spoke
  not to my heart! That whispers ever, 'he came not yesterday to see me! he
  promised, yet he came not!' and it will not be answered. Are you sick,
  Paullus, that you came not? Surely in that case you had sent for me.
  Hortensia would have gone with me to visit you. No! you are not sick, else
  most surely I had known it! Are you then angry with me, or offended?
  Unconscious am I, dearest, of any fault against you in word, thought, or
  deed. Yet will I humble myself, if you are indeed wroth with me. Have I
  appeared indifferent or cold? oh! Paul, believe it not. If I have not
  expressed the whole of my deep tenderness which is poured out all, all on
  thee alone&mdash;my yearning and continued love, that counts the minutes when
  thou art not near me; it is not that I cease ever to think of thee, to adore
  thee, but that it were unmaidenly and overbold to tell thee of it. See, now,
  if I have not done so here; and my hand trembles, and my cheek burns, and
  almost I expect to see the pallid paper blush, to find itself the bearer of
  words so passionate as these. But you will pardon me, and come to me
  forthwith, and tell me, if anything, in what I have displeased thee.</p>

  <p>"It is a lovely morning, and Hortensia has just learned from Caius
  Bibulus, that at high noon the ambassadors of the wild Allobroges will march
  in with their escort over the Mulvian Bridge. She wishes much to see the
  pomp, for we are told that their stature is gigantic and their presence
  noble, and their garb very wild, yet magnificent withal and martial. Shall we
  go forth and see them? Hortensia will carry me in her carpentum, and you can
  either ride with us on horseback, or if you be not over proud take our reins
  yourself as charioteer, or, what will perhaps be the best of all, come in
  your own car and escort us. I need not say that I wish to see you <i>now</i>,
  for <i>that</i> I wish always. Come, then, and quickly, if you would pleasure
  your own Julia."</p>

  <p>"Sweet girl," he exclaimed, as he finished reading it, "pure as the snow
  upon Soracte, yet warm and tender as the dove. Inimitable Julia! And
  I&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, ye gods! ye gods! that beheld it!" and he smote his brow
  heavily with his hand, and bit his lip, till the blood almost sprang beneath
  the pressure of his teeth; but recovering himself in a moment, he turned to
  Thrasea&mdash;"Who brought this billet? doth he wait?"</p>

  <p>"Phaedon, Hortensia's Greek boy, brought it, noble Paullus. He waits for
  your answer in the atrium."</p>

  <p>"Quick, then, quick, Thrasea, give me a reed and paper."</p>

  <p>And snatching the materials he wrote hastily:</p>

  <p>"Chance only, evil chance, most lovely Julia, and business of some weight,
  restrained me from you most unwilling yesterday. More I shall tell you when
  we meet&mdash;indeed all! for what can I wish to conceal from you, the better
  portion of my soul. Need I say that I come&mdash;not, alas, on the wings of
  my love, or I should be beside you as I write, but as quickly as the speed of
  horses may whirl me to your presence; until then, fare you well, and confide
  in the fidelity of Paullus."</p>

  <p>"Give it to Phaedon," he said, tossing the note to Thrasea, "and say to
  him, 'if he make not the better haste, I shall be at Hortensia's house before
  him.' And then, hark ye, tell some of those knaves in the hall without, to
  make ready with all speed my light chariot, and yoke the two black horses
  Aufidus and Acheron. With all speed, mark ye! And then return, good Thrasea,
  for I have much to say to you, before I go."</p>

  <p>When he was left alone, he arose from his seat, walked three or four times
  to and fro his chamber, in anxious and uneasy thought; and then saying, "Yes!
  yes! I will not betray him, but I will take no step in the business any
  farther, and I will tell him so to-night. I will tell him, moreover, that
  Cicero has the dagger, for now that Volero is slain, I see not well how it
  can be identified. The Gods defend me from the dark ones whom I have invoked.
  I will not be untrue to Rome, nor to Julia, any more&mdash;perish the whole
  earth, rather! Ay! and let us, too, perish innocent, better than to live
  guilty!"</p>

  <p>As he made up his mind, by a great effort, to the better course, the
  freedman returned, and announcing that the car would be ready forthwith,
  inquired what dress he should bring him.</p>

  <p>"Never mind that! What I have on will do well enough, with a
  <i>petasus</i>;(15) for the sun shines so brightly that it will be scarce
  possible to drive bare headed. But I have work for you of more importance.
  You know the cave of Egeria, as men call it, in the valley of the Muses?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">15. The Petasus was a broad brimmed hat of felt with a
  low round crown. It was originally an article of the Greek dress, but was
  adopted by the</p>

  <p>"Surely, my Paullus."</p>

  <p>"I know, I know; but have you ever marked the ground especially around the
  cave&mdash;what opportunities there be for concealment, or the like?"</p>

  <p>"Not carefully," he answered, "but I have noticed that there is a little
  gorge just beyond the grotto, broken with crags and blocks of tufo, and
  overgrown with much brushwood, and many junipers and ivy."</p>

  <p>"That will do then, I warrant me," replied Arvina. "Now mark what I tell
  you, Thrasea; for it may be, that my life shall depend on your acting as I
  direct. At the fourth hour of the night, I am to meet one in the grotto, on
  very secret business, whom I mistrust somewhat; who it is, I may not inform
  you; but, as I think my plans will not well suit his councils, I should not
  be astonished were he to have slaves, or even gladiators, with him to attack
  me&mdash;but not dreaming that I suspect anything, he will not take many. Now
  I would have you arm all my freedmen, and some half dozen of the trustiest
  slaves, so as to have in all a dozen or fifteen, with corslets under their
  tunics, and boarspears, and swords. You must be careful that you are not seen
  going thither, and you were best send them out by different roads, so as to
  meet after nightfall. Hide yourselves closely somewhere, not far from the
  cavern's mouth, whence you may see, unseen yourselves, whatever passes. I
  will carry my light hunting horn; and if you hear its blast rush down and
  surround the cave, but hurt no man, nor strike a blow save in self-defence,
  until I bid you. Do you comprehend me?"</p>

  <p>"I comprehend, and will obey you to the letter, Paullus," answered the
  grave freedman, "but will not you be armed?"</p>

  <p>"I will, my Thrasea. Leave thou a leathern hunting helmet here on the
  table, and light scaled cuirass, which I will do on under my toga. I shall be
  there at the fourth hour precisely; but it were well that ye should be on
  your posts by the second hour or soon after. For it may be, he too will lay
  an ambuscade, and so all may be discovered."</p>

  <p>"It shall be done, most noble master."</p>

  <p>"And see that ye take none but trustworthy men, and that ye all are
  silent&mdash;to would be ruin."</p>

  <p>"As silent as the grave, my Paullus," answered the freedman.</p>

  <p>"The car and horses are prepared, Paullus," exclaimed a slave, entering
  hastily.</p>

  <p>"Who goes with me to hold the reins?" asked his master.</p>

  <p>"The boy Myron."</p>

  <p>"It is well. Fetch me a petasus, and lay the toga in the chariot. I may
  want it. Now, Thrasea, I rely on you! Remember&mdash;be prudent, sure, and
  silent."</p>

  <p>"Else may I perish ill," replied the faithful servitor, as his master,
  throwing the broad brimmed hat carelessly on his curly locks, rushed out, as
  if glad to seek relief from his own gloomy thoughts in the excitement of
  rapid motion; and, scarcely pausing to observe the condition or appearance of
  his beautiful black coursers, sprang into the low car of bronze, shaped not
  much differently from an old fashioned arm chair with its back to the horses;
  seized the reins, and drove rapidly away, standing erect&mdash;for the car
  contained no seats&mdash;with the boy Myron clinging to the rail behind
  him.</p>

  <p>A few minutes brought him through the Cyprian lane and the Suburra to the
  Virbian slope, by which he gained the Viminal hill, and the Hortensian villa;
  at the door of which, in a handsome street leading through the Quirinal gate
  to the Flaminian way, or great northern road of Italy, stood the carpentum,
  drawn by a pair of noble mules, awaiting its fair freight.</p>

  <p>This was a two-wheeled covered vehicle, set apart mostly for the use of
  ladies; and, though without springs, was as comfortable and luxurious a
  carriage as the art of that day could produce; nor was there one in Rome,
  with the exception of those kept for public use in the sacred processions,
  that could excel that of the rich and elegant Hortensia.</p>

  <p>The pannels were beautifully painted, and the arched top or tilt supported
  by gilded caryatides at the four corners. Its curtains and cushions were of
  fine purple cloth; and altogether, though far less convenient, it was a much
  gayer and more sumptuous looking vehicle than the perfection of modern coach
  building.</p>

  <p>The ladies were both waiting in the atrium, when the young man dismounted
  from his car; and never had his Julia, he thought, looked more lovely than
  she did this morning, with the redundant masses of her rich hair confined by
  a net of green and gold, and a rich <i>pallium</i>, or shawl of the same
  colors, gracefully draped over her snowy stola, and indicating by the soft
  sweep of its outlines the beauties of a figure, which it might veil but could
  not conceal.</p>

  <p>Joyously, in the frank openness of her pure nature, she sprung forward to
  meet him, with both her fair hands extended, and the ingenuous blood rising
  faintly to her pale cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Dear, dearest Paul&mdash;I am so happy, so rejoiced to see you."</p>

  <p>Nothing could be more tender, more affectionate, than all her air, her
  words, her manner. Love flashed from her bright eyes irrepressible, played in
  the dimples of her smiling mouth, breathed audible in every tone of her soft
  silvery voice. Yet was there nothing that the gravest and most rigid censor
  could have wished otherwise&mdash;nothing that he could have pronounced, even
  for a moment, too warm, or too free for the bearing of the chariest
  maiden.</p>

  <p>The very artlessness of her emotions bore evidence to their purity, their
  holiness. She was rejoiced to see her permitted lover, she felt no shame in
  that emotion of chaste joy, and would no more have dreamed of concealing it
  from him whom she loved so devotedly, than of masking her devotion to the
  Gods under a veil of indifference or coldness.</p>

  <p>Here was the very charm of her demeanor, as here was the difference
  between her manner, and that of her rival Lucia.</p>

  <p>In Julia, every thought that sprang from her heart, was uttered by her
  lips in frank and fearless innocence; she had no thought she was ashamed of,
  no wish she feared to utter. Her clear bright eyes dwelt unabashed and fondly
  on the face of him she loved; and no scrutiny could have detected in their
  light, one glance of unquiet or immodest passion. Her manner was warm and
  unreserved toward Paul, because she had a right to love him, and cared not
  who knew that she did so. Lucia's was as cold as snow, on the contrary; yet
  it required no second glance to perceive that the coldness was but the cover
  superinduced to hide passions too warm for revelation. Her eye was downcast;
  yet did its stolen glances speak things, the secret consciousness of which
  would have debased the other in her own estimation beyond the hope of pardon.
  Her tongue was guarded, and her words slow and carefully selected, for her
  imaginations would have made the brazen face of the world blush for shame
  could it have heard them spoken.</p>

  <p>Hortensia smiled to witness the manifest affection of her sweet child; but
  the smile was, she knew not why, half mournful, as she said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You are unwise, my Julia, to show this truant how much you prize his
  coming; how painfully his absence depresses you. Sages declare that women
  should not let their lords guess, even, how much they are loved."</p>

  <p>"Why, mother," replied Julia, her bright face gleaming radiantly with the
  pure lustre of her artless spirit, "I <i>am</i> glad to see him; I
  <i>do</i>prize his coming; I <i>do</i> love Paullus. Why, then, should I
  dissemble, when to do so were dishonest, and were folly likewise?"</p>

  <p>"You should not tell him so, my child," replied the mother, "I fear you
  should not tell him so. Men are not like us women, who love but the more
  devotedly, the more fondly we are cherished. There is, I fear, something of
  the hunter's, of the conqueror's, ardour, in their passion; the pursuit is
  the great allurement; the winning the great rapture; and the prize, once
  securely won, too often cast aside, and disregarded."</p>

  <p>"No! no!" returned the girl eagerly, fixing her eyes on her lover's
  features, as if she would read therein the outward evidences of that nobility
  of soul, which she believed to exist within. "I will not believe it; it were
  against all gratitude! all honor! all heart-truth! No, I will not believe it;
  and if I did, Hortensia, by all the Gods, I had rather live without love,
  than hold it on so vile a tenure of deceit. What, treasure up the secrets of
  your soul from your soul's lord? No! no! I would as soon conceal my devotion
  from the powers of heaven, as my affections from their rightful master. I,
  for one, never will believe that all men are selfish and unfaithful."</p>

  <p>"May the Gods grant, my Julia, that sad experience shall never teach you
  that they are so. I, at least, will believe, and pray, that, what his sex may
  be soever, our Paullus will prove worthy ever of that best gift of God, a
  pure woman's pure and unselfish love."</p>

  <p>"Oh! may it be so," answered Paullus, clasping his hands fervently
  together. "May I die ere I wrong my Julia! and be you sure, sweet girl, that
  your simple trust is philosophy far truer than the sage's lore. Base must his
  nature be, and his heart corrupt, who remains unsubdued to artlessness and
  love, such as yours, my Julia."</p>

  <p>"But tell us, now," said the elder lady, "what was it that detained you,
  and where were you all the day? We expected you till the seventh hour of the
  night, yet you came not."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you, Hortensia," he replied; "as we drive along; for I had
  rather do so, where there be no ears to overhear us. You must let me be your
  charioteer to-day, and your venerable grey-headed coachman shall ride with my
  wild imp Myron, in the car, if you will permit it."</p>

  <p>"Willingly," she replied. "Then something strange has happened. Is it not
  so?"</p>

  <p>"I knew it," exclaimed Julia, clasping her snowy hands together, "I knew
  it; I have read it in his eye this half hour. What can it be? it is something
  fearful, I am certain."</p>

  <p>"Nay! nay! be not alarmed; if there were danger, it is passed already. But
  come, let me assist you to the carriage; I will tell you all as we go. But if
  we do not make good speed, the pomp will have passed the bridge before we
  reach it."</p>

  <p>The ladies made no more delay, but took their places in the carriage, Paul
  occupying the front seat, and guiding the sober mules with far more ease,
  than Hortensia's aged charioteer experienced in restraining the speed of
  Arvina's fiery coursers, and keeping them in their place, behind the heavier
  carpentum.</p>

  <p>The narrow streets were now passed, and threading the deep arch of the
  Quirinal gate, they struck into a lane skirting the base of the hill of
  gardens, on the right hand, by which they gained the great Flaminian way,
  just on the farther confines of the Campus; when they drove rapidly toward
  the Milvian bridge, built a few years before by AEmilius Scaurus, and
  esteemed for many a year the masterpiece of Roman architecture.</p>

  <p>As soon as they had cleared the confines of the busy city, within which
  the throng of vehicles, and the passengers, as well on foot as on horseback,
  compelled Arvina to give nearly the whole of his attention to the guidance of
  the mules&mdash;he slackened the reins, and leaving the docile and
  well-broken animals to choose their own way, giving only an occasional glance
  to their movements, commenced the detail of his adventures at the point,
  where he parted from them on the night before the last.</p>

  <p>Many were the emotions of fear, and pity, and anxiety which that tale
  called forth; and more than once the tears of Julia were evoked by sympathy,
  first, with her lover's daring, then with the grief of Thrasea. But not a
  shade of distrust came to cloud her pure spirit, for Paullus mentioned
  nothing of his interview with Catiline on the Caelian, or in the Campus; much
  less of his dining with him, or detecting in him the murderer of the hapless
  Volero.</p>

  <p>Still he did not attempt to conceal, that both Cicero and himself had
  suspicions of the identity of the double murderer, or that he was about to go
  forth that very evening, for the purpose of attempting&mdash;as he
  represented it&mdash;to ascertain, beyond doubt, the truth of his
  suspicions.</p>

  <p>And here it was singular, that Julia evinced not so much alarm or
  perturbation as her mother; whether it was that she underrated the danger he
  was like to run, or overrated the prowess and valor of her lover. But so it
  was, for though she listened eagerly while he was speaking, and gazed at him
  wistfully after he had become silent, she said nothing. Her beautiful eyes,
  it is true, swam with big tear-drops for a moment, and her nether lip
  quivered painfully; but she mastered her feelings, and after a short space
  began to talk joyously about such subjects as were suggested by the pleasant
  scenery, through which their road lay, or the various groups of people whom
  they met on the way.</p>

  <p>Ere long the shrill blast of a cavalry trumpet was heard from the
  direction of the bridge, and a cloud of dust surging up in the distance
  announced the approach of the train.</p>

  <p>There was a small green space by the wayside, covered with short mossy
  turf, and overshadowed by the spreading branches of a single chesnut, beneath
  which Paullus drew up the mules of Hortensia's carriage, directing the old
  charioteer, who seemed hard set to manage his high-bred and fiery steeds, to
  wheel completely off the road, and hold them well in hand on the green behind
  him.</p>

  <p>By this time the procession had drawn nigh, and two mounted troopers,
  glittering in casques of highly polished bronze, with waving crests of
  horsehair, corslets of burnished brass, and cassocks of bright scarlet cloth,
  dashed by as hard as their fiery Gallic steeds could trot, their harness
  clashing merrily from the rate at which they rode. Before these men were out
  of sight, a troop of horse rode past in serried order, five abreast, with a
  square crimson banner, bearing in characters of gold the well-known initials,
  S. P. Q. R., and surmounted by a gilded eagle.</p>

  <p>Nothing could be more beautifully accurate than the ordered march and
  exact discipline of this little band, their horses stepping proudly out, as
  if by one common impulse, in perfect time to the occasional notes of the
  <i>lituus</i>, or cavalry trumpet, by which all their manoeuvres were
  directed; and the men, hardy and fine-looking figures, in the prime of life,
  bestriding with an air of perfect mastery their fiery chargers, and bearing
  the weight of their heavy panoply beneath the burning sunshine of the Italian
  noon, as though a march of thirty miles were the merest child's play.</p>

  <p>About half a mile in the rear of this escort, so as to avoid the dust
  which hung heavily, and was a long time subsiding in the breathless
  atmosphere, came the train of the ambassadors from the Gaulish Highlands, and
  on these men were the eyes of the Roman ladies fixed with undisguised wonder,
  not unmixed with admiration. For their giant stature, strong limbs, and wild
  barbaric dresses, were as different from those of the well-ordered
  legionaries, as were their long light tresses, their blue eyes, keen and
  flashing as a falcon's, and their fair ruddy skins, from the clear brown
  complexions, dark locks, and black eyes of the Italian race.</p>

  <p>The first of these wild people was a young warrior above six feet in
  height, mounted on a superb grey charger, which bore his massive bulk as if
  it were unconscious of his burthen. His large blue eyes wandered around him
  on all sides with a quick flashing glance that took in everything, yet seemed
  surprised at nothing; though almost everything which he beheld must have been
  strange to him. His long red hair flowed down in wavy masses over his neck
  and shoulders, and his upper lip, though his cheeks and his chin were closely
  shaven, was clothed with an immense moustache, the ends of which curled
  upward nearly to his eyes.</p>

  <p>Upon his head he wore a casque of bronze, covered with studs of silver,
  and crested by two vast polished horns, the spoil of the fiercest animal of
  Europe's forests&mdash;the gigantic and indomitable Urus. A coat of mail,
  composed of bright steel rings interwoven in the Gaulish fashion, covered his
  body from the throat downward to the hips, leaving his strong arms bare to
  the shoulder, though they were decorated with so many chains, bracelets, and
  armlets, and broad rings of gold and silver, as would have gone far to
  protect them from a sword cut.</p>

  <p>His legs were clothed, unlike those of any southern people, in
  tightly-sitting pantaloons&mdash;<i>braccae</i>, as they were called&mdash;of
  gaily variegated tartans, precisely similar to the trews of the Scottish
  Highlander&mdash;a much more ancient part of the costume, by the way, than
  the kilt, or short petticoat, now generally worn&mdash;and these trews, as
  well as the streaming plaid, which he wore belted gracefully about his
  shoulders, shone resplendent with checkers of the brightest scarlet, azure,
  and emerald, and white, interspersed here and there with lines and squares of
  darker colors, giving relief and harmony to the general effect.</p>

  <p>A belt of leather, studded with bosses and knobs of coral and polished
  mountain pebbles, girded his waist, and supported a large purse of some rich
  fur, with a formidable dirk at the right side, and, at the left, suspended by
  gilt chains from the girdle, a long, straight, cutting broadsword, with a
  basket hilt&mdash;the genuine claymore, or great sword&mdash;to resist the
  sweep of which Marcellus had been fain, nearly five hundred years before, to
  double the strength of the Roman casque, and to add a fresh layer of wrought
  iron to the tough fabric of the Roman buckler.</p>

  <p>This ponderous blade constituted, with the dagger, the whole of his
  offensive armature; but there was slung on his left shoulder a small round
  targe, of the hide of the mountain bull, bound at the rim, and studded
  massively with bronze, and having a steel pike projecting from the
  centre&mdash;in all respects the same instrument as that with which the clans
  received the British bayonet at Preston Pans and Falkirk.</p>

  <p>The charger of this gallantly-attired chief was bedecked, like his rider,
  with all the martial trappings of the day; his bridle, mounted with bits of
  ponderous Spanish fabric, was covered with bosses gemmed with amber and
  unwrought coral; his housings, of variegated plaid, were elaborately fringed
  with embroideries of gold; and his rich scarlet poitrel was decked, in the
  true taste of the western savage, with tufts of human hair, every tuft
  indicating a warrior slain, and a hostile head embalmed in the coffers of the
  valiant rider.</p>

  <p>"See, Julia, see," whispered Arvina, as he passed slowly by their chariot,
  "that must be one of their great chiefs, and a man of extraordinary prowess.
  Look at the horns of the mighty Urus on his helmet, a brute fiercer, and well
  nigh as large as a Numidian elephant. He must have slain it, single-handed in
  the forest, else had he not presumed to wear its trophies, which belong only
  to the greatest of their champions. For every stud of silver on his casque of
  bronze he must have fought in a pitched battle; and for each tuft of hair
  upon his charger's poitrel he must have slain a foe in hand-to-hand
  encounter. There are eighteen tufts on this side, and, I warrant me, as many
  on the other. Doubtless, he has already stricken down thirty-six foemen."</p>

  <p>"And he numbers not himself as yet so many years! Ye Gods! what monsters,"
  exclaimed Julia, shuddering at the idea of human hair used as a decoration.
  "Are they not anthropophagi, the Gauls, my Paullus?"</p>

  <p>"No, by the Gods! Julia," answered Arvina, laughing; "but very valiant
  warriors, and hospitable beyond measure to those who visit their native
  mountains; admirers, too, of women, whom they regard as almost divine, beyond
  all things. I see that stout fellow looking wild admiration at you now, from
  his clear blue eyes, though he would fain be thought above the reach of
  wonder."</p>

  <p>"Are they believers in the Gods, or Atheists, as well as barbarous?"</p>

  <p>"By Jupiter! neither barbarous, to speak the truth, nor Atheists; they
  worship Mercury and Jove, Mars and Apollo, and Diana, as we do; and though
  their tongues be something wild, and their usages seem strange to us, it
  cannot be denied that they are a brave and noble race, and at this time good
  friends to the Roman people. Mark that old chieftain; he is the headman of
  the tribe, and leader of the embassy, I doubt not."</p>

  <p>While he was speaking, a dozen other chiefs had ridden by, accompanied by
  the chiefs of the Roman escort, some men in the prime of life, some grizzled
  and weather-beaten, and having the trace of many a hard-fought field in the
  scars that defaced their sunburnt visages. But the last was an old man, with
  long silver hair, and eyebrows and mustachios white as the snow on his native
  Jura; the principal personage evidently of the band, for his casque was
  plated with gold, and his shirt of mail richly gilded, and the very plaid
  which he wore, alternately checked with scarlet, black, and gold.</p>

  <p>He also, as he passed, turned his deep grey eye toward the little group on
  the green, and his face lightened up, as he surveyed the athletic form and
  vigorous proportions of the young patrician, and he leaned toward the
  officer, who rode beside him, a high crested tribune of the tenth legion, and
  enquired his name audibly.</p>

  <p>The soldier, who had been nodding drowsily over his charger's neck, tired
  by the long and dusty ride, looked up half bewildered, for he had taken no
  note of the spectators, but as his eyes met those of Arvina, he smiled and
  waved his hand, for they were old companions, and he laughed as he gave the
  required information to the ancient warrior.</p>

  <p>The gaze of the old man fell next on the lovely lineaments of Julia, and
  dwelt there so long that the girl lowered her eyes abashed; but, when she
  again raised them, supposing that he had passed by, she still met the firm,
  penetrating, quiet gaze, rivetted on her face, for he had turned half round
  in the saddle as he rode along.</p>

  <p>A milder light came into his keen, hawk-like eye, and a benignant smile
  illuminated his gray weather-beaten features, as he surveyed and marked the
  ingenuous and artless beauty of her whole form and face; and he whispered
  into the tribune's ear something that made him too turn back, and wave his
  hand to Paul, and laugh merrily.</p>

  <p>"Now, drive us homeward, Paullus," said Hortensia, as the cohort of
  infantry which closed the procession, marched steadily along, dusty and dark
  with sweat, yet proud in their magnificent array, and solid in their iron
  discipline. "Drive us homeward as quickly as you may. You will dine with us,
  and if you must need go early to your meeting, we will not hinder you."</p>

  <p>"Gladly will I dine with you; but I must say farewell soon after the third
  hour!"</p>

  <p>They soon arrived at the hospitable villa, and shortly afterward the
  pleasant and social meal was served. But Paul was not himself, though the
  lips he loved best poured forth their fluent music in his ear, and the eyes
  which he deemed the brightest, laughed on him in their speaking fondness.</p>

  <p>Still he was sad, silent, and abstracted, and Julia marked it all; and
  when he rose to say farewell, just as the earliest shades of night were
  falling, she arose too; and as she accompanied him to the door, leaning
  familiarly on his arm, she said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You have not told me all, Paullus. I thought so while you were yet
  speaking; but now I am sure of it. I will not vex you at this time with
  questions, but will devour my anxiety and grief. But to-morrow, to-morrow,
  Paullus, if you love me indeed, you will tell me all that disturbs you. True
  love has no concealment from true love. Do not, I pray you, answer me; but
  fare you well, and good fortunes follow you."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch109"
     name="ch109"></a>IX. &mdash; THE AMBUSH</h2>

  <p class="cp"
     style="text-align:center"><i>My friends, That is not so. Sir, we are your
     enemies.</i> &mdash;Two Gentlemen of Verona.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT was already near the fourth hour of the Roman night, or
  about a quarter past eight of our time, when Paullus issued from the Capuan
  gate, in order to keep his appointment with the conspirator; and bold as he
  was, and fearless under ordinary circumstances, it would be useless to deny
  that his heart beat fast and anxiously under his steel cuirass, as he strode
  rapidly along the Appian way to the place of meeting.</p>

  <p>The sun had long since set, and the moon, which was in her last quarter,
  had not as yet risen; so that, although the skies were perfectly clear and
  cloudless, there was but little light by which to direct his foot-steps
  toward the valley of the Muses, had he not been already familiar with the
  way.</p>

  <p>Stepping out rapidly, for he was fearful now of being too late at the
  place appointed, he soon passed the two branches of the beautiful and
  sparkling Almo, wherein the priests of Cybele were wont to lave the statue of
  their goddess, amid the din of brazen instruments and sacred song; and a
  little further on, arrived at the cross-road where the way to Ardea, in the
  Latin country, branched off to the right hand from the great Appian
  turnpike.</p>

  <p>At this point there was a small temple sacred to Bacchus, and a little
  grove of elms and plane trees overrun with vines, on which the ripe clusters
  consecrated to the God were hanging yet, though the season of the vintage had
  elapsed, safe from the hand of passenger or truant school-boy.</p>

  <p>Turning around the angle of this building, Arvina entered a dim lane,
  overshadowed by the tall trees of the grove, which wound over two or three
  little hillocks, and then sweeping downward to the three kindred streamlets,
  which form the sources of the Almo, followed their right bank up the valley
  of the Muses.</p>

  <p>Had the mind of Arvina been less agitated than it was by dark and ominous
  forebodings, that walk had been a pleasant one, in the calm and breezeless
  evening. The stars were shining by thousands in the deep azure sky; the
  constant chirrup of the shrill-voiced cicala, not mute as yet, although his
  days of tuneful life were well nigh ended, rose cheerfully above the rippling
  murmurs of the waters, and the mysterious rustling of the herbage rejoicing
  to drink up the copious dew; and heard by fits and starts from the thick
  clumps of arbutus on the hills, or the thorn bushes on the water's brink, the
  liquid notes of the nightingale gushed out, charming the ear of darkness.</p>

  <p>For the first half mile of his walk, the young patrician met several
  persons on the way&mdash;two or three pairs of lovers, as they seemed, of the
  lower orders, strolling affectionately homeward; a party of rural slaves
  returning from their labours on some suburban farm, to their master's house;
  and more than one loaded chariot; but beyond this all was lonely and silent,
  with the exception of the stream, the insects, and the vocal night-bird.</p>

  <p>There was no sound or sight that would seem to indicate the vicinity of
  any human being, as Arvina, passing the mouth of a small gorge or hollow
  scooped out of the bosom of a soft green hill, paused at the arch of a low
  but richly ornamented grotto, hollowed out of the face of the rock, and
  supported by a vault of reticulated brick-work, decorated elegantly with
  reliefs of marble and rich stucco. The soft green mosses and dark tendrils of
  the waving ivy, which drooped down from the rock and curtained well nigh half
  the opening, rendered the grotto very dark within. And it was a moment or two
  before Paullus discovered that he was alone in that secluded place, or in the
  company only of the old marble god, who, reclining on a couch of the same
  material at the farther end of the cave, poured forth his bright waters from
  an inverted jar, into the clear cool basin which filled the centre of the
  place.</p>

  <p>He was surprised not a little at finding himself the first at the place of
  meeting, for he was conscious that he was behind his time; and had, indeed,
  come somewhat late on purpose, with a view of taking his stand as if
  naturally during the interview, between the conspirator and the cave
  mouth.</p>

  <p>It was not, however, altogether a matter of regret to him, that he had
  gained a little time, for the folds of his toga required some adjustment, in
  order to enable him to get readily at the hilt of his sword, and the
  mouth-piece of his hunting-horn, which he carried beneath his gown. And he
  applied himself to that purpose immediately, congratulating himself, as he
  did so, on the failure of his first project, and thinking how much better it
  would be for him to stand as far as possible from the entrance, so as to
  avoid even the few rays of dim star-light, which crept in through the tangled
  ivy.</p>

  <p>This was soon done; and in accordance with his afterthought, he sat down
  on a projecting angle of the statue's marble couch, in the inmost corner of
  the vault, facing the door, and having the pool of the fountain interposed
  between that and himself.</p>

  <p>For a few moments he sat thinking anxiously about the interview, which he
  believed, not without cause, was likely to prove embarrassing, at least, if
  not perilous. But, when he confessed to himself, which he was very soon
  compelled to do, that he could shape nothing of his own course, until he
  should hear what were the plans in which Catiline desired his cooperation;
  and when time fled and the man came not, his mind began to wander, and to
  think about twenty gay and pleasant subjects entirely disconnected with the
  purpose for which he had come thither. Then he fell gradually into a sort of
  waking dream, or vision, as it were, of wandering fancies, made up partly of
  the sounds which he actually heard with his outward ears, though his mind
  took but little note of them, and partly of the occurrences in which he had
  been mixed up, and the persons with whom he had been brought into contact
  within the last two or three days. The gory visage of the murdered slave, the
  sweet and calm expression of his own Julia, the truculent eyes and sneering
  lip of Catiline, and the veiled glance and voluptuous smile of his too
  seductive daughter, whirled still before him in a strange sort of human
  phantasmagoria, with the deep searching look of the consul orator, the wild
  glare of the slaughtered Volero, and the stern face, grand and proud in his
  last agony, of the dying Varus.</p>

  <p>In this mood he had forgotten altogether where he was, and on what
  purpose, when a deep voice aroused him with a start, and though he had
  neither heard his footstep, nor seen him enter, Catiline stood beside his
  elbow.</p>

  <p>"What ho!" he exclaimed, "Paullus, have I detained you long in this dark
  solitude."</p>

  <p>"Nay, I know not how long," replied the other, "for I had fallen into
  strange thoughts, and forgotten altogether the lapse of time; but here have I
  been since the fourth hour."</p>

  <p>"And it is now already past the fifth," said Cataline, "but come, we must
  make up for the loss of time. Some friends of mine are waiting for us, to
  whom I wish to introduce you, that you may become altogether one of us, and
  take the oaths of fidelity. Give me the dagger now, and let us be going on
  our way."</p>

  <p>"I have it not with me, Catiline."</p>

  <p>"Have it not with you! Wherefore not? wherefore not, I say, boy?" cried
  the conspirator, very savagely. "By all the furies in deep hell, you were
  better not dally with me."</p>

  <p>"Because it is no longer in my possession; and therefore I could not bring
  it with me," he replied firmly, for the threats of the other only inflamed
  his pride, and so increased his natural courage.</p>

  <p>"By the Gods, you brave me, then!" exclaimed Catiline; "fool! fool! beware
  how you tamper with your fate. Speak instantly, speak out: to whom have you
  dared give it?"</p>

  <p>"There was no daring in the matter, Catiline," he answered steadily,
  keeping an eye on the arch-traitor's movements; "before I knew that it was
  yours, I sent it, as I had promised, to Cicero, with word that Volero could
  tell him who was the owner of it."</p>

  <p>"Ha, didst thou so?" said the other, mastering instantly his fury, in his
  desire to make himself fully acquainted with all that had passed. "When was
  all this? has he seen Volero, and learned the secret of him, then?"</p>

  <p>"I sent it, Catiline, within an hour of the time I left the Campus
  yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Before coming to my house to dinner?"</p>

  <p>"Before going to thy house to dinner, Sergius."</p>

  <p>"Before seducing Lucia Orestilla?" again sneered the desperate
  villain.</p>

  <p>"Before yielding," answered the young man, who was now growing angry, for
  his temper was not of the meekest, "to her irresistible seduction."</p>

  <p>"Ha! yielding&mdash;well! we will speak of that hereafter. Hath the consul
  seen Volero?"</p>

  <p>"He hath seen him dead; and how dead, Catiline best knoweth."</p>

  <p>"It was, then, thou, whom I saw in the feeble lamplight with the accursed
  wretch that crosses my path everywhere, the dastard, drivelling dotard of
  Arpinum; thou that despite thine oath, didst lead him to detect the man, thou
  hadst sworn to obey, and follow! Thou! it is thou, then, that houndest mine
  enemies upon my track! By the great Gods, I know not whether most to marvel
  at the sublime, unrivalled folly, which could lead thee to fancy, that thou,
  a mere boy and tyro, couldst hoodwink eyes like mine; or at the daring which
  could prompt thee to rush headlong on thine own ruin in betraying me! Boy,
  thou hast but one course left; to join us heart and hand; to go and renew
  thine oath in such fashion as even thou, premeditated perjurer, wilt not
  presume to break, and then to seal thy faith by the blood"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Of whom?"</p>

  <p>"Of this new man; this pendant consul of Arpinum."</p>

  <p>"Aye!" exclaimed Paullus, as if half tempted to accede to his proposal;
  "and if I do so, what shall I gain thereby?"</p>

  <p>"Lucia, I might say," answered Catiline, "but&mdash;seeing that possession
  damps something at all times the fierceness of pursuit&mdash;what if I should
  reply, the second place in Rome?"</p>

  <p>"In Rome?"</p>

  <p>"When we have beaten down the proud patricians to our feet, and raised the
  conquering ensign of democratic sway upon the ramparts of the capitol; when
  Rome and all that she contains of bright and beautiful, shall be our heritage
  and spoil; the second place, I say, in regenerated Rome, linked, too, to
  everlasting glory."</p>

  <p>"And the first place?"</p>

  <p>"By Mars the great avenger! dost soar so high a pitch already? ho! boy,
  the first is mine, by right, as by daring. How say you? are you mine?"</p>

  <p>"If I say no!"</p>

  <p>"Thou diest on the instant."</p>

  <p>"I think not," replied Arvina quietly, "and I do answer No."</p>

  <p>"Then perish, fool, in thy folly."</p>

  <p>And leaping forward he dealt him a blow with a long two-edged dagger,
  which he had held in his hand naked, during the whole discussion, in
  readiness for the moment he anticipated; and at the same instant uttered a
  loud clear whistle.</p>

  <p>To his astonishment the blade glanced off the breast of the young man, and
  his arm was stunned nearly to the shoulder by the unexpected resistance of
  the stout corslet. The whistle was answered, however, the very moment it was
  uttered; and just as he saw Paullus spring to the farther side of the cavern,
  and set his back against the wall, unsheathing a heavy broadsword of the
  short Roman fashion, three stout men entered the mouth of the cave, heavily
  armed with weapons of offence, although they wore no defensive armor.</p>

  <p>"Give me a sword," shouted the fierce conspirator, furious at being
  foiled, and perceiving that his whole enterprise depended on the young man's
  destruction. "He is armed under his gown with a breast-plate! Give me a
  sword, and then set on him all at once. So that will do, now, on."</p>

  <p>"Hold, Sergius Catiline," exclaimed Arvina, "hold, or by all the Gods you
  will repent it. If you have three men at your back I have full five times
  three within call."</p>

  <p>"Call them, then!" answered the other, making at him, "call them! think
  you again to fool me? Ho, Geta and Arminius, get round the fountain and set
  on him! make haste I say&mdash;kill&mdash;kill."</p>

  <p>And with the word he rushed at him, aiming a fierce blow at his head,
  while the others a moment afterward charged on him from the other side.</p>

  <p>But during the brief parley Arvina had disengaged the folds of his gown
  from his light shoulder, and wrapped it closely about his left arm, and when
  Catiline rushed in he parried the blow with his sword, and raising the little
  horn he carried, to his lips, blew a long piercing call, which was answered
  by a loud shout close at hand, and by the rush of many feet without the
  grotto.</p>

  <p>Catiline was himself astonished at the unexpected aid, for he had taken
  the words of the young patrician for a mere boast. But his men were alarmed
  and fell back in confusion, while Paul, profiting by their hesitation, sprang
  with a quick active bound across the basin of the fountain, and gained the
  cavern's mouth just as his stout freedman Thrasea showed himself in the
  entrance with a close casque and cuirass of bronze, and a boar spear in his
  hand, the heads and weapons of several other able-bodied men appearing close
  behind.</p>

  <p>At the head of these Arvina placed himself instantly, having his late
  assailants hemmed in by a force, against which they now could not reasonably
  hope to struggle.</p>

  <p>But Paullus showed no disposition to take undue advantage of his
  superiority, for he said in a calm steady voice, "I leave you now, my friend;
  and it will not be my fault, if aught that has passed here, is remembered any
  farther. None here have seen you, or know who you are; and you may rest
  assured that for <i>her</i> sake and mine own honor, if I join not your
  plans, I will not betray you, or reveal your counsels. To that I am sworn,
  and come what may, my oath shall not be broken."</p>

  <p>"Tush," cried the other, maddened by disappointment, and filled with
  desperate apprehensions, "men trust not avowed traitors. Upon them, I say,
  you dogs. Let there be forty of them, but four can stand abreast in the
  entrance, and we can front them, four as good as they."</p>

  <p>And he again dashed at Arvina, without waiting to see if his gladiators
  meant to second his attack; but they hung back, reluctant to fight against
  such odds; for, though brave men, and accustomed to risk their lives, without
  quarrel or excitement, for the gratification of the brute populace of Rome,
  they had come to the cave of Egeria, prepared for assassination, not for
  battle; and their antagonists were superior to them as much in accoutrement
  and arms&mdash;for their bronze head-pieces were seen distinctly glimmering
  in the rays of the rising moon&mdash;as in numbers.</p>

  <p>The blades of the leaders clashed together, and several quick blows and
  parries had been interchanged, during which Thrasea, had he not been
  restrained by his young master's orders, might easily have stabbed the
  conspirator with his boar-spear. But he held back at first, waiting a fresh
  command, until seeing that none came, and that the unknown opponent was
  pressing his lord hard; while the gladiators, apparently encouraged by his
  apathy, were beginning to handle their weapons, he shifted his spear in his
  hands, and stepping back a pace, so as to give full scope to a sweeping blow,
  he flourished the butt, which was garnished with a heavy ball of metal, round
  his head in a figure of eight, and brought it down so heavily on the felt
  skull-cap of the conspirator, that his teeth jarred audibly together, a quick
  flash sprang across his eyes, and he fell, stunned and senseless, at the feet
  of his intended victim.</p>

  <p>"Hold, Thrasea, hold," cried Paullus, "by the Gods! you have slain
  him."</p>

  <p>"No, I have not. No! no! his head is too hard for that," answered the
  freedman; "I felt my staff rebound from the bone, which it would not have
  done, had the skull been fractured. No! he is not dead, though he deserved to
  die very richly."</p>

  <p>"I am glad of it," replied Paullus. "I would not have him killed, for many
  reasons. Now, hark ye, ye scoundrels and gallows-birds! most justly are your
  lives forfeit, whether it seem good to me, to take them here this moment, or
  to drag you away, and hand you over to the lictors of the city-praetor, as
  common robbers and assassins."</p>

  <p>"That you cannot do, whilst we live, most noble," answered the boldest of
  the gladiators, sullenly; "and you cannot, I think, take our lives, without
  leaving some of your own on our swords' points."</p>

  <p>"Brave me not," cried the young man, sternly, "lest you drive me to do
  that I would not. Your lives, I say, are forfeit; but, seeing that I love not
  bloodshed, I leave you, for this time, unpunished. Take up the master whom
  you serve, and bear him home; and, when he shall be able to receive it, tell
  him Paullus Arvina pardons his madness, pities his fears, and betrays no
  man's trust&mdash;least of all his. For the rest, let him choose between
  enmity and friendship. I care not which it be. I can defend my own life, and
  assail none. Beware how you follow us. If you do, by all the Gods! you die.
  See, he begins to stir. Come, Thrasea, call off your men; we will go, ere he
  come to his senses, lest worse shall befal."</p>

  <p>And with the words he turned his back contemptuously on the crest-fallen
  gladiators, and strode haughtily across the threshold, leaving the fierce
  conspirator, as he was beginning to recover his scattered senses, to the keen
  agony of conscious villainy frustrated, and the stings of defeated pride and
  disappointed malice.</p>

  <p>The night was well advanced, when he reached his own house, having met no
  interruption on the way, proud of his well-planned stratagem, elated by
  success, and flattered by the hope that he had extricated himself by his own
  energy from all the perils which had of late appeared so dark and difficult
  to shun.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch110"
     name="ch110"></a>X. &mdash; THE WANTON</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>Duri magno sed amore dolores<br>
  Pollute, notumque furens quid femina possit.</i><br>
  &mdash;Aen. V. 6. Virgil.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT was not till a late hour on the following day, that
  Catiline awoke from the heavy and half lethargic slumber, which had fallen
  upon him after the severe and stunning blow he received in the grotto of
  Egeria.</p>

  <p>His head ached fearfully, his tongue clove to his palate parched with
  fever, and all his muscular frame was disjointed and unstrung, so violently
  had his nerves been shattered.</p>

  <p>For some time after he awoke, he lay tossing to and fro, on his painful
  couch, scarce conscious of his own identity, and utterly forgetful of the
  occurrences of the past evening.</p>

  <p>By slow degrees, however, the truth began to dawn upon him, misty at first
  and confused, until he brought to his mind fairly the attack on Arvina, and
  the affray which ensued; with something of an indistinct consciousness that
  he had been stricken down, and frustrated in his murderous attempt.</p>

  <p>As soon as the certainty of this was impressed on him, he sprang up from
  his bed, with his wonted impetuosity, and inquired vehemently of a freedman,
  who sat in his chamber motionless as a statue in expectation of his
  waking&mdash;</p>

  <p>"How came I home, Chaerea? and at what hour of night?"</p>

  <p>"Grievously wounded, Catiline; and supported in the arms of the sturdy
  Germans, Geta and Arminius; and, for the time, it was past the eighth
  hour."</p>

  <p>"The eighth hour! impossible!" cried the conspirator; "why it was but the
  fifth, when that occurred. What said I, my good Chaerea? What said the
  Germans? Be they here now? Answer me quick, I pray you."</p>

  <p>"There was but one word on your lips, Catiline; a constant cry for water,
  water, so long as you were awake; and after we had given you of it, as much
  as you would take, and you had fallen into a disturbed and feverish sleep,
  you still muttered in your dreams, 'water!' The Germans answered nothing,
  though all the household questioned them; and, in good truth, Catiline, it
  was not very long that they were capable of answering, for as soon as you
  were in bed, they called for wine, and in less than an hour were thoroughly
  besotted and asleep. They are here yet, I think, sleeping away the fumes of
  their potent flagons."</p>

  <p>"Call me Arminius, hither. Hold! What is the time of day?"</p>

  <p>"The sun is high already; it must be now near the fourth hour!"</p>

  <p>"So late! you did ill, Chaerea, to let me lie so long. Call me Arminius
  hither; and send me one of the boys; or rather go yourself, Chaerea, and pray
  Cornelius Lentulus the Praetor, to visit me before he take his seat on the
  Puteal Libonis. It is his day, I think, to take cognizance of criminal
  matters. Begone, and do my bidding!"</p>

  <p>Within a moment the Athenian freedman, for he was of that proud though
  fallen city, returned conducting the huge German gladiator, whose bewildered
  air and bloodshot eyes seemed to betoken that he had not as yet recovered
  fully from the effect of his last night's potations.</p>

  <p>No finer contrast could be imagined by poet or painter, than was presented
  by those three men, each eminently striking in his own style, and
  characteristic of his nation. The tall spare military-looking Roman, with his
  hawk nose and eagle eye, and close shaved face and short black hair, his
  every attitude and look and gesture full of pride and dominion; the versatile
  and polished Greek, beautiful both in form and face, as a marble of
  Praxiteles, beaming with intellect, and having every feature eloquent of
  poetry and imagination, and something of contempt for the sterner and harder
  type of mind, to which he and his countryman were subjugated; and last, the
  wild strong-limbed yet stolid-looking German, glaring out with his bright
  blue eyes, full of a sort of stupid fierceness, from the long curls of his
  auburn hair, a type of man in his most primitive state, the hunter and the
  warrior of the forest, enslaved by Rome's insatiate ambition.</p>

  <p>Catiline looked at him fiercely for a moment, and then nodded his head, as
  if in assent to some of his own meditations; then muttering to himself, "the
  boar! the mast-fed German boar!" he turned to the Greek, saying
  sharply&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Art thou not gone to Lentulus? methought thou hadst been thither, and
  returned ere this time! Yet tarry, since thou art here still. Are any of my
  clients in the atrium&mdash;any, I mean, of the trustiest!"</p>

  <p>"Rufinus, surnamed Lupus, is without, and several others. Stolo, whom you
  preserved from infamy, when accused of <i>dolus malus</i>, in the matter of
  assault with arms on Publius Natro, is waiting to solicit you, I fancy, for
  some favor."</p>

  <p>"The very man&mdash;the Wolf is the very man! and your suitor for favors
  cannot refuse to confer what he requests. Stay my Chaerea. Send Glycon to
  summon Lentulus, and go yourself and find out what is Stolo's suit. Assure
  him of my friendship and support; and, hark you, have him and Rufinus into an
  inner chamber, and set bread before them and strong wine, and return to me
  presently. Now, then, Arminius," he continued, as the Greek left the room,
  "what did we do last night, and what befel us?&mdash;for I can remember
  nothing clearly."</p>

  <p>The giant shook his tawny locks away from his brow, and gazed into his
  employer's face with a look of stolid inquiry, and then answered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do! we did nothing, that I know! We followed thee as in duty bound to
  that cave by the Almo; and when we had stayed there awhile, we brought thee
  back again, seeing thou couldst not go alone. What can I tell? you know
  yourself why you took us thither."</p>

  <p>"Thou stupid brute!" retorted Catiline, "or worse than brute,
  rather&mdash;for brutes augment not their brutishness by gluttony and
  wine-bibbing&mdash;thou art asleep yet! see if this will awaken thee!"</p>

  <p>And with the word he snatched up a large brazen ewer full of cold water,
  which stood on a slab near him, and hurled it at his head. The gladiator
  stood quite still, and merely bent his neck a little to avoid the heavy
  vessel, which almost grazed his temples, and then shook himself like a water
  spaniel, as the contents flashed full into his face and eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do not do that again," he grunted, "unless you want to have your throat
  squeezed."</p>

  <p>"By Pollux the pugilist! he threatens!" exclaimed Catiline, laughing at
  his dogged anger. "Do you not know, cut-throat, that one word of mine can
  have your tough hide slashed with whips in the common gaol, till your very
  bones are bare?"</p>

  <p>"And do you know what difference it makes, whether my hide be slashed with
  dog-whips in the gaol, or with broadswords in the amphitheatre? A man can
  only die! and it were as well, in my mind, to die having killed a Roman in
  his own house, as a countryman on the arena."</p>

  <p>"By all the Gods!" cried Catiline, "he is a philosopher! but, look you
  here, my German Solon, you were better regard me, and attend to what I tell
  you; so may you escape both gaol and amphitheatre. Tell me, briefly,
  distinctly, and without delay, what fell out last evening."</p>

  <p>"You led us to assault that younker, whom you know; and when we would have
  set upon him, and finished his business easily, he blew a hunting horn, and
  fifteen or sixteen stout fellows in full armor came down the bank from behind
  and shut up the cave's mouth&mdash;you know as well as I do."</p>

  <p>"So far I do, most certainly," replied the conspirator, "but what
  then?"</p>

  <p>"Why, then, thou wouldest not hear reason; but, though the youth swore he
  would not betray thee, must needs lay on, one man against sixteen; and so, as
  was like, gottest thine head broken by a blow of a boar-spear from a great
  double-handed Thracian. For my part, I wondered he did not put the spear-head
  through and through you. It was a great pity that he did not; it would have
  saved us all, and you especially, a world of trouble."</p>

  <p>"And you, cowardly dogs, forsook me; and held back, when by a bold rush we
  might easily have slain him, and cut our way through the dastard slaves."</p>

  <p>"No! no! we could not; they were all Thracians, Dacians, and Pannonians;
  and were completely armed, too. We might have killed him, very likely, but we
  could never have escaped ourselves."</p>

  <p>"And he, he? what became of him when I had fallen?"</p>

  <p>"He bade us take you up," replied the German, "and carry you home, and
  tell you 'to fear nothing, he would betray no man, least of all you.' He is a
  fine young fellow, in my judgment; for he might just as well have killed us
  all, as not, if he had been so minded; and I can't say but that it would have
  served us rightly, for taking odds of four to one upon a single man. That is,
  I know, what you Romans call fighting; beyond the Rhine we style it cowardly
  and murder! Then, after that he went off with his men, leaving us scratching
  our heads, and looking as dastardly and crest-fallen as could be. And then we
  brought you home hither, after it had got late enough to carry you through
  the streets, without making an uproar; and then Lydon and Chaerea put you to
  bed; and I, and Geta, and Ardaric, as for us, we got drunk, seeing there was
  no more work to do last night, and not knowing what might be to do, to-day.
  And so it is all well, very well, as I see it."</p>

  <p>"Well, call you it, when he has got off unscathed, and lives to avenge
  himself, and betray me?"</p>

  <p>"But he swore he would do neither, Catiline," answered the simple-minded
  son of the forest.</p>

  <p>"Swore!" replied the conspirator, with a fell sneer.</p>

  <p>"Ay did he, master! swore by all that was sacred he would never betray any
  man, and you least of all; and I believe he will keep his promise."</p>

  <p>"So do I," answered Catiline, bitterly, "I swear he shall; not for the
  lack of will, but of means to do otherwise! You are a stupid brute, Arminius;
  but useful in your way. I have no need of you to-day, so go and tell the
  butler to give you wine enough to make all three of you drunk again; but mind
  that ye are sound, clear-headed, and alert at day-break to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"But will he give it to me at my bidding?"</p>

  <p>"If not, send him to me for orders; now, begone."</p>

  <p>"I ask for nothing better," replied the gladiator, and withdrew, without
  any word or gesture of salutation, in truth, despising the Roman in his heart
  as deeply for what he deemed his over-craftiness and over-civilization, as
  the more polished Greek did, for what on his side he considered the utter
  absence of both.</p>

  <p>Scarce had the German left the room, before the Greek returned, smiling,
  and seemingly well satisfied with the result of his mission.</p>

  <p>Catiline looked at him steadily, and nodding his head, asked him
  quietly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Are they prepared, Chaerea?"</p>

  <p>"To do anything you would have them, Catiline. Stolo, it seems, is again
  emperilled&mdash;another charge of attempt to murder&mdash;and he wants you
  to screen him."</p>

  <p>"And so I will; and will do more. I will make him rich and great, if he do
  my bidding. Now go, and make them understand this. They must swear that they
  came hither this morning to claim my aid in bringing them to speech with
  Lentulus, the Praetor, and then thou must be prepared to swear, Chaerea, that
  I have had no speech or communication with them at all&mdash;which is quite
  true."</p>

  <p>"That is a pity," answered the Greek, coolly; "for any one can swear
  steadily to the truth, but it requires genius to carry out a lie
  bravely."</p>

  <p>"Oh! never fear, thou shalt have lies enough to swear to! Now mark me,
  when Lentulus comes hither, they must accuse to him Paullus Caecilius Arvina,
  whose person, if they know him not, you must describe to them&mdash;him who
  dined with me, you know, the day before yesterday&mdash;of subornation to
  commit murder. The place where he did so, the top of the Caelian hill. The
  time, sunrise on that same day. The person whom he desired them to slay,
  Volero the cutler, who dwelt in the Sacred Way. They must make up the tale
  their own way, but to these facts they must swear roundly. Do you understand
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly; they shall do it well, and both be in one tale. I will help
  them to concoct it, and dress it up with little truthful incidents that will
  tell. But are you sure that he cannot prove he was not there?"</p>

  <p>"Quite sure, Chaerea. For he <i>was</i> there."</p>

  <p>"And no witnesses who can prove to whom he spoke?"</p>

  <p>"Only one witness, and he will say nothing, unless called upon by
  Paullus."</p>

  <p>"And if so called upon?"</p>

  <p>"Will most reluctantly corroborate the tale of Stolo and Rufinus!"</p>

  <p>"Ha! ha!" laughed the freedman, "thou shouldst have been a Greek,
  Catiline, thou art too shrewd to be a mere Roman."</p>

  <p>"A <i>mere</i> Roman, hang-dog!" answered Catiline, "but thou knowest
  thine opportunity, and profitest by it! so let it pass! Now as for thee,
  seeing thou dost love lying, thou shalt have thy part. Thou shalt swear that
  the night before that same morning, at a short time past midnight, thou wert
  returning by the Wicked street, from the house of Autronius upon the
  Quirinal, whither I sent thee to bid him to dinner the next day&mdash;he
  shall confirm the tale&mdash;when thou didst hear a cry of murder from the
  Plebeian graveyard on the Esquiline; and hurrying to the spot, didst see
  Arvina, with his freedman Thrasea bearing a torch, conceal a fresh bleeding
  body in a broken grave; and, hidden by the stem of a great tree thyself,
  didst hear him say, as he left the ground, 'That dog will tell no tales!'
  Thou must swear, likewise, that thou didst tell me the whole affair the next
  morning, and that I bade thee wait for farther proof ere speaking of the
  matter. And again, that we visited the spot where thou saw'st the deed, and
  found the grass trampled and bloody, but could not find the body. Canst thou
  do this, thinkest thou?"</p>

  <p>"Surely I can," said the Athenian, rubbing his hands as if well pleased,
  "so that no one shalt doubt the truth of it! And thou wilt confirm the
  truth?"</p>

  <p>"By chiding thee for speaking out of place. See that thou blurt it out
  abruptly, as if unable to keep silence any longer, as soon as the others have
  finished their tale. Begone and be speedy. Lentulus will be here anon!"</p>

  <p>The freedman withdrew silently, and Catiline was left alone in communion
  with his own bad and bitter thoughts; and painful, as it seemed, and
  terrible, even to himself, was that communion, for he rose up from his seat
  and paced the room impetuously, to and fro, gnashing and grinding his teeth,
  and biting his lips till the blood sprang out.</p>

  <p>After a while, however, he mastered his passions, and began to dress
  himself, which he did by fits and starts in a manner perfectly characteristic
  of the man, uttering hideous imprecations if the least thing ran counter to
  his wishes, and flinging the various articles of his attire about the chamber
  with almost frantic violence.</p>

  <p>By the time he had finished dressing himself, Lentulus was announced, and
  entered with his dignified and haughty manner, not all unmixed with an air of
  indolence.</p>

  <p>"All hail, my Sergius," he exclaimed, as he crossed the threshold. "What
  hast thou of so grave importance, that thou must intercept me on my way to
  the judgment seat? Nothing has gone wrong in our councils&mdash;ha?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing that I know," answered Catiline, "but here are two of my
  trustiest clients, Stolo and Rufinus, have been these three hours waiting for
  my awakening, that I might gain your ear for them. They sent me word they had
  a very heavy charge to make to you; but for my part, I have not seen them,
  and know not what it is."</p>

  <p>"Tush! tush! man; never tell me that," replied Lentulus, with a grim
  smile. "Do you think I will believe you have sent for me all the way hither
  this morning, without some object of your own to serve? No! no! my friend;
  with whomsoever that may pass, it will not go current with Cornelius
  Lentulus!"</p>

  <p>"Just as you please," said the traitor; "you may believe me or not exactly
  as you choose; but it is true, nevertheless, that I have neither seen the
  men, nor spoken with them. Nor do I know at all what they want."</p>

  <p>"I would, then, you had not sent for me," answered the other. "Come, let
  us have the knaves in. I suppose they have been robbing some one's hen-roost,
  and want to lay the blame on some one else!"</p>

  <p>"What ho! Chaerea."</p>

  <p>And as he spoke the word, the curtain which covered the door-way was
  withdrawn, and the keen-witted freedman made his appearance.</p>

  <p>"Admit those fellows, Stolo and Rufinus. The praetor is prepared to give
  them a hearing."</p>

  <p>It would have been difficult, perhaps, to have selected from the whole
  population of Rome at that day, a more murderous looking pair of
  scoundrels.</p>

  <p>"Well, sirrahs, what secrets of the state have you that weigh so
  ponderously on your wise thoughts?" asked Lentulus, with a contemptuous
  sneer.</p>

  <p>"Murder, most noble Lentulus&mdash;or at least subornation thereof,"
  answered one of the ruffians.</p>

  <p>"Most natural indeed! I should have thought as much. Well, tell us in a
  word&mdash;for it is clear that nobody has murdered either of you&mdash;whom
  have you murdered?"</p>

  <p>"If we have murdered no one, it was not for the lack of prompting, or of
  bribes either."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! I should have thought a moderate bribe would have arranged the
  matter easily. But come! come! to the point! whom were ye bribed or
  instigated to get rid of? speak! I am in haste!"</p>

  <p>"The cutler, Caius Volero!"</p>

  <p>"Volero! Ha!" cried Lentulus, starting. "Indeed! indeed! that may well be.
  By whom, then, were you urged to the deed, and when?"</p>

  <p>"Paullus Caecilius Arvina tempted us to the deed, by the offer of ten
  thousand sesterces! We met him by appointment upon the Caelian hill, at the
  head of the Minervium, a little before sunrise, the day before
  yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" and for a moment or two Lentulus fixed his eyes upon the ground, and
  pondered deeply on what he had just heard. "Have ye seen Volero since?"</p>

  <p>"No, Praetor."</p>

  <p>"Nor heard anything concerning him?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing!" said Stolo. But he spoke with a confused air and in an
  undecided tone, which satisfied the judge that he was speaking falsely.
  Rufinus interposed, however, saying&mdash;</p>

  <p>"But I have, noble Lentulus. I heard say that he <i>was</i> murdered in
  his own booth, that same night!"</p>

  <p>"And having heard this, you told it not to Stolo?"</p>

  <p>"I never thought about it any more," answered Rufinus doggedly, seeing
  that he had got into a scrape.</p>

  <p>"That was unfortunate, and somewhat strange, too, seeing that you came
  hither together to speak about the very man. Now mark me. Volero
  <i>was</i>that night murdered, and it appears to me, that you are bringing
  this accusation against a young patrician, in order to conceal your own base
  handiwork in the deed. Fellows, I grievously suspect you."</p>

  <p>"Wrongfully, then, you do so," answered Stolo, who was the bolder and more
  ready witted of the two. "Rufinus ever was a forgetful fool; and I trow I am
  not to be brought into blame for his folly."</p>

  <p>"Well for you, if you be not brought into more than blame! Now, mark me
  well! can you prove where you were that night of the murder, excellent
  Stolo?"</p>

  <p>"Ay! can I," answered the man boldly. "I was with stout Balatro, the
  fisherman, helping to mend his nets until the fourth hour, and all his boys
  were present, helping us. And then we went to a cookshop to get some supper
  in the ox forum, and thence at the sixth hour we passed across to Lydia's
  house in the Cyprian lane, and spent a merry hour or two carousing with her
  jolly girls. Will that satisfy you, Lentulus?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, if it can be proved," returned the Praetor. "And you, Rufinus; can
  you also show your whereabout that evening?"</p>

  <p>"I can," replied the fellow, "for I was sick abed; and that my wife can
  show, and Themison the druggist, who lives in the Sacred Way. For she went to
  get me an emetic at the third hour; and I was vomiting all night. A poor hand
  should I have made that night at murder."</p>

  <p>"So far, then," replied Lentulus, "you have cleared yourselves from
  suspicion; but your charge on Arvina needs something more of confirmation,
  ere I dare cite a Patrician to plead to such a crime! Have you got witnesses?
  was any one in sight, when he spoke with you on the Minervium?"</p>

  <p>"There was one; but I know not if he will choose to speak of it?"</p>

  <p>"Who was it?" exclaimed Lentulus, growing a little anxious on the subject,
  for though he cared little enough about Arvina, he was yet unwilling to see a
  Patrician arraigned for so small a matter, as was in his eyes the murder of a
  mechanic.</p>

  <p>"Why should he not speak? I warrant you I will find means to make
  him."</p>

  <p>"It was my patron, Lentulus."</p>

  <p>"Your patron! man!" he cried, much astonished. "What, Catiline, here?"</p>

  <p>"Catiline it was! my Praetor."</p>

  <p>"And have you consulted with him, ere you spoke with me?"</p>

  <p>"Not so! most noble, for he would not admit us!"</p>

  <p>"Speak, Sergius. Is this so? did you behold these fellows in deep converse
  with Caecilius Arvina, in the Minervium? But no! it must be folly! for what
  should you have been doing there at sunrise?"</p>

  <p>"I prithee do not ask me, Lentulus," answered Catiline, with an air of
  well feigned reluctance. "I hate law suits and judicial inquiries, and I love
  young Arvina."</p>

  <p>"Then you did see them? Nay! nay! you must speak out. I do adjure you,
  Catiline, by all the Gods! were you, at sunrise, on the Caelian, and did you
  see Arvina and these two?"</p>

  <p>"I was, at sunrise, on the Caelian; and I did see them."</p>

  <p>"And heard you what they said?"</p>

  <p>"No! but their faces were grave and earnest; and they seemed angry as they
  separated."</p>

  <p>"Ha! In itself only, this were a little thing; but when it turns out that
  the man <i>was</i> slain that same night, the thing grows serious. You,
  therefore, I shall detain here as witnesses, and partially suspected. Some of
  your slaves must guard them, Catiline, and I will send a lictor to cite
  Paullus, that he appear before me after the session at the Puteal Libonis. I
  am in haste. Farewell!"</p>

  <p>"Me! me! hear me! good Lentulus&mdash;hear me!" exclaimed Chaerea,
  springing forward, all vehemence and eagerness to speak, as it would seem,
  ere he should be interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Chaerea?" cried Catiline, looking sternly at him, and shaking his finger,
  "Remember!"</p>

  <p>"No! no!" replied Chaerea&mdash;"no! no! I will not hold my peace! No!
  Catiline, you may kill me, if you choose, but I will speak; to keep this
  secret any longer would kill me, I tell you."</p>

  <p>"If it do not, I will," answered his master, angrily.</p>

  <p>"This must not be, my Sergius," interposed Lentulus, "let the man speak if
  he have any light to throw on this mysterious business. Say on, my good
  fellow, and I will be your mediator with your master."</p>

  <p>The freedman needed no more exhortation, but poured out a flood of eager,
  anxious narrative, as had been preconcerted between himself and Catiline,
  speaking with so much vehemence, and displaying so much agitation in all his
  air and gestures, that he entirely imposed his story upon Lentulus; and that
  Catiline had much difficulty in restraining a smile at the skill of the
  Greek.</p>

  <p>"Ha! it is very clear," said Lentulus, "he first slew the slave with his
  own hand, and then would have compassed&mdash;nay! I should rather say,
  <i>has</i> compassed&mdash;Volero's slaughter, who must some how or other
  have become privy to the deed. I must have these detained, and him arrested!
  There can be no doubt of his guilt, and the people will be, I think, disposed
  to make an example; there have of late been many cases of assassination!"</p>

  <p>As soon as they were left alone, Lentulus looked steadily into the face of
  his fellow-conspirator for a moment, and then burst into a hoarse laugh.</p>

  <p>"Why all this mummery, my Sergius?" he added, as soon as he had ceased
  from laughing, "Or wherefore would you have mystified me too?"</p>

  <p>"I might have wished to see whether the evidence was like to seem valid to
  the Judices, from its effect upon the Praetor!" answered the other.</p>

  <p>"And are you satisfied?"</p>

  <p>"I am."</p>

  <p>"You may be so, my Sergius, for, of a truth, until Chaerea swore as he did
  touching Medon, I was myself deceived."</p>

  <p>"You believe, then, that this will be sufficient to secure his
  condemnation?"</p>

  <p>"Beyond doubt. He will be interdicted fire and water, if these men stick
  to their oaths only. It would be well, perhaps, to convict one of Arvina's
  slaves of the actual death of Volero. That might be done easily enough, but
  there must be care taken, that you select one who shall not be able to prove
  any alibi. But wherefore are you so bent on destroying this youth, and by the
  law, too, which is ever both perilous and uncertain?"</p>

  <p>"He knows too much, to live without endangering others."</p>

  <p>"What knows he?"</p>

  <p>"Who slew Medon&mdash;Who slew Volero&mdash;What we propose to do, ere
  long, in the Campus!" answered Catiline, steadily.</p>

  <p>"By all the Gods?" cried Lentulus, turning very pale, and remaining silent
  for some moments. After which he said, with a thoughtful manner, "it would be
  better to get rid of him quietly."</p>

  <p>"That has been tried too."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"It failed! He is now on his guard. He is brave, strong, wary. It cannot
  be done, save thus."</p>

  <p>"He will denounce us. He will declare the whole, ere we can spring the
  mine beneath him."</p>

  <p>"No! he will not; he dares not. He is bound by oaths which&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oaths!" interrupted Lentulus, with a sneer, and in tones of contemptuous
  ridicule. "What are oaths? Did they ever bind you?"</p>

  <p>"I do not recollect," answered Catiline; "perhaps they did, when I was a
  boy, and believed in Lemures and Lamia. But Paullus Arvina is not Lucius
  Catiline, nor yet Cornelius Lentulus; and I say that his oaths shall bind
  him, until&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And I say, they shall not!" A clear high voice interrupted him, coming,
  apparently, through the wall of the chamber.</p>

  <p>Lentulus started&mdash;his very lips were white, and his frame shook with
  agitation, if it were not with fear.</p>

  <p>Catiline grew pale likewise; but it was rage, not terror, that blanched
  his swarthy brow. He dashed his hand upon the table&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Furies of Hell!"</p>

  <p>While the words were yet trembling on his lips, the door was thrown
  violently open, the curtains which concealed it torn asunder, and, with her
  dark eyes gleaming a strange fire, and two hard crimson spots gleaming high
  up on her cheek bones&mdash;the hectic of fierce passion&mdash;her bosom
  throbbing, and her whole frame dilated with anger and excitement, young Lucia
  stood before them.</p>

  <p>"And I say," she repeated, "that they shall not bind him! By all the Gods!
  I swear it! By my own love! my own dishonor! I swear that they shall not!
  Fool! fool! did you think to outwit me? To blind a woman, whose every fear
  and passion is an undying eye? Go to! go to! you shall not do it."</p>

  <p>Audacious, as he was, the traitor was surprised, almost daunted; and while
  Lentulus, a little reassured, when he saw who was the interlocutor, gazed on
  him in unmitigated wonder, he faltered out, in tones strangely dissimilar to
  his accustomed accents of indomitable pride and decision&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You mistake, girl; you have not heard aright, if you have heard at all; I
  would say, you are deceived, Lucia!"</p>

  <p>"Then would you lie!" she answered, "for I am not deceived, though you
  would fain deceive me! Not heard? not heard?" she continued. "Think you the
  walls in the house of Catiline have no eyes nor ears?" using the very words
  which he had addressed to her lover; "Lucius Catiline! I know all!"</p>

  <p>"You know all?" exclaimed Lentulus, aghast.</p>

  <p>"And will prevent all!" replied the girl, firmly, "if you dare cross my
  purposes!"</p>

  <p>"Dare! dare!" replied Catiline, who now, recovering from his momentary
  surprise, had regained all his natural haughtiness and vigor. "Who are you,
  wanton, that dare talk to us of daring?"</p>

  <p>"Wanton!" replied the girl, turning fiery red. "Ay! But who made me the
  wanton that I am? Who fed my youthful passions? Who sapped my youthful
  principles? Who reared me in an atmosphere, whose very breath was luxury,
  voluptuousness, pollution, till every drop of my wholesome blood was turned
  to liquid flame? till every passion in my heart became a fettered earthquake?
  Fool! fool! you thought, in your impotence of crime, to make Lucia Orestilla
  your instrument, your slave! You have made her your mistress! You dreamed, in
  your insolence of fancied wisdom, that, like the hunter-cat of the Persian
  despots, so long as you fed the wanton's appetite, and basely pandered to her
  passions, she would leap hood-winked on the prey you pointed her. Thou fool!
  that hast not half read thy villain lesson! Thou shouldst have known that the
  very cat, thou thoughtest me, will turn and rend the huntsman if he dare rob
  her of her portion! I tell you, Lucius Catiline, you thought me a mere
  wanton! a mere sensual thing! a soulless animal voluptuary! Fool! I say,
  double fool! Look into thine own heart; remember what blood runs in these
  female veins! Man! Father! Vitiator! My spirit is not female! my blood, my
  passions, my contempt of peril, my will indomitable and immutable, are, like
  my mortal body, your begetting! My crimes, and my corruption, are your
  teaching! Beware then, as you know the heat of your own appetites, how you
  presume to hinder mine! Beware, as you know your own recklessness in doing
  and contempt in suffering, how you stir me, your child, to do and suffer
  likewise! Beware, as you know the extent of your own crimes, the depth of
  your own pollution, how you drive me, your pupil, to out-do her master!
  Beware! I say! beware! This man is mine. Harm but one hair upon his head, and
  you shall die, like a dog, with the dogs who snarl at your bidding, and your
  name perish with you. I have spoken!"</p>

  <p>There needed not one tenth part of the wisdom, which the arch-traitor
  really possessed, to shew him how much he had miscalculated the range of his
  daughter's intellect; the fierce energies of her powerful but misdirected
  mind.</p>

  <p>He felt, for a moment, as the daring archimage whose spells, too potent
  for their master's safety, have evoked and unchained a spirit that defies
  their guidance. But, like that archimage, conscious that all depends on the
  exertion of his wonted empire, he struggled hard to regain his lost
  authority.</p>

  <p>"Girl," he replied, in those firm deep tones of grave authority, which he
  deemed the best calculated to control her excitement, "You are mad! Mad, and
  ungrateful; and like a frantic dog would turn and rend the hand that feeds
  you, for a shadow. I never thought of making you an instrument; fool indeed
  had I been, to think I could hoodwink such an intellect as yours! If I have
  striven to clear away the mists of prejudice from before your eyes, which, in
  your senseless anger, you now call corrupting you, it was because I saw in
  you a kindred spirit to mine own, capable to soar fearless and undazzled into
  the very noon of reason. If I have taught you to indulge your passions,
  opened a universe of pleasures to your ken, it was that I saw in you a woman
  of mind so manly, that all the weaknesses, which fools call affections, would
  be but powerless to warp it from its purpose. I would have made
  you"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The world's scorn!" she interrupted him, bitterly; but he went on,
  without noticing the interruption&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The equal of myself in intellect, in energy, and wisdom; else how had you
  dared to brave me thus, whom never man yet braved and lived to boast of it!
  And now for a mere girlish fancy, a weak feminine caprice for a man, who
  cares not for you; who has betrayed you; who, idiot and inconsistent that he
  is, fresh from your fiery kisses, was whimpering within an hour at the feet
  of his cold Julia; who has, I doubt not, boasted of your favors, while he
  deplored his own infatuation, to her, his promised wife!&mdash;For a fond
  frivolous liking of a moment, you would forego gratification, rank,
  greatness, power, and vengeance! Is this just toward me, wise toward
  yourself? Is this like Lucia Orestilla? You would preserve a traitor who
  deserts you, nay, scorns you in his easy triumph! You would destroy all those
  who love you; you would destroy yourself, to make the traitor and his minion
  happy! Awake! awake, my Lucia, from this soft foolish fancy! Awake, and be
  yourself once more! Awake to wisdom, to ambition, to revenge!"</p>

  <p>His words were spirited and fiery; but they struck on no kindred chord in
  the bosom of his daughter. On the contrary, the spark had faded from her eye
  and the flush from her cheek, and her looks were dispirited and downcast. But
  as he ceased, she raised her eye and met his piercing gaze firmly, and
  replied in a sorrowful yet resolute tone.</p>

  <p>"Eloquent! aye! you are eloquent! Catiline, would I had never learned it
  to my cost; but it is too late now! it is all too late! for the rest, I am
  awake; and so far, at least, am wise, that I perceive the folly of the past,
  and decipher clearly the sophistry of your false teaching. As for the future,
  hope is dead, and ambition. Revenge, I seek not; if I did so, thou art there,
  on whom to wreak it; for saving thou, and myself only, none have wronged me.
  More words are needless. See that thou lay aside thy plans, and dare not to
  harm him, or her. He shall not betray thee or thine; for that will I be his
  surety and hostage! Injure them, by deed or by word, and, one and all, you
  perish! I ask no promise of you&mdash;promises bind you not!&mdash;but let
  fear bind you, for <i>I</i> promise <i>you</i>, and be sure that my plight
  will be kept!"</p>

  <p>"Can this be Lucia Orestilla?" exclaimed Catiline, "this puling love-sick
  girl, this timorous, repentant&mdash;I had nearly called thee&mdash;maiden!
  Why, thou fool, what would'st thou with the man farther? Dost think to be his
  wife?"</p>

  <p>"Wife!" cried the wretched girl, clasping her hands together, and looking
  piteously in her destroyer's face. "Wife! wife! and me!&mdash;alas! alas!
  that holy, that dear, honored name!&mdash;Never! never for me the sweet
  sacred rites! Never for me the pure chaste kiss, the seat by the happy
  hearth, the loving children at the knee, the proud approving smile
  of&mdash;Oh! ye gods! ye just gods!&mdash;a loved and loving
  husband!&mdash;Wife! wife!" she continued, lashing herself, as she proceeded,
  into fresh anger; "there is not in the gaols of Rome the slave so base as to
  call Lucia Orestilla wife! And wherefore, wherefore not?&mdash;Man! man! if
  that thou be a man, and not a demon, but for thee, and thy cursed teachings,
  I might have known all this&mdash;pure bliss, and conscious rectitude, and
  the respect and love of men. I might have been the happy bride of an
  honorable suitor, the cherished matron of a respected lord, the proud glad
  mother of children, that should not have blushed to be sprung from the wanton
  Lucia! Thou! it is thou, thou only that hast done all this!&mdash;And why, I
  say, why should I not revenge? Beware! tempt me no farther! Do my bidding!
  Thou slave, that thought'st but now to be the master, obey my bidding to the
  letter!" And she stamped her foot on the ground, with the imperious air of a
  despotic queen. And in truth, crest-fallen and heavy in spirit, were the
  proud men whom she so superbly threatened.</p>

  <p>She gazed at them contemptuously for a moment, and then, shaking her fore
  finger menacingly, "I leave ye," she said, "I leave ye, but imagine not, that
  I read not your councils. Me, you cannot deceive. With yourselves only it
  remains to succeed or to perish. For if ye dare to disobey me, the gods
  themselves shall not preserve you from my vengeance!"</p>

  <p>"I fear you not, my girl," cried Catiline, "for all that you are now mad
  with disappointment, and with anger. So you may go, and listen if you will,"
  he added, pointing to the secret aperture concealed in the mouldings of the
  wall. "We shall not speak the less freely for your hearing us."</p>

  <p>"There is no need to listen now," she answered, "for I know everything
  already."</p>

  <p>"Every thing that we <i>have</i> said, Lucia."</p>

  <p>"Everything that you <i>will</i> do, Sergius Catiline!"</p>

  <p>"Aye?"</p>

  <p>"Aye! and everything that I shall do, likewise!" and with the word she
  left the room.</p>

  <p>"A perilous girl, by all the Gods!" said Lentulus, in Greek, as she
  disappeared. "Will she do as she threatens?"</p>

  <p>"Tush!" replied Catiline in Latin, "she speaks Greek like an Athenian. I
  am not sure, however, that she could understand such jargon as that is. No!
  she will do none of that. She is the cleverest and best girl living, only a
  little passionate, for which I love her all the more dearly. No! she will do
  none of that. Because she will not be alive, to do it, this time to-morrow,"
  he added, putting his mouth within half an inch of the ear of Lentulus, and
  speaking in the lowest whisper.</p>

  <p>Lentulus, bold as he was and unscrupulous, started in horror at his words,
  and his lips were white as he faltered&mdash;"Your own daughter, Lucius!"</p>

  <p>"Ha! ha!" laughed the fierce conspirator, aloud; "ha! ha! yes, she is my
  own daughter, in everything but beauty. She is the loveliest creature in all
  Rome! But we must yield, I suppose, to her wishes; the women rule us, after
  all is said, and I suppose I was alarmed needlessly. Doubtless Arvina will be
  silent. Come, I will walk with you so far on your way to the Forum. What ho!
  Chaerea, see that Rufinus and Stolo lack nothing. I will speak with them,
  when I return home; and hark you in your ear. Suffer not Lucia Orestilla to
  leave the house a moment; use force if it be needed; but it will not. Tell
  her it is my orders, and watch her very closely. Come, Lentulus, it is
  drawing toward noon."</p>

  <p>They left the house without more words, and walked side by side in silence
  for some distance, when Catiline said in a low voice, "This is unpleasant,
  and may be dangerous. We must, however, trust to fortune till to-morrow, when
  my house shall be void of this pest. Then will we proceed, as we had
  proposed."</p>

  <p>Lentulus looked at him doubtfully, and asked, with a quick shudder running
  through his limbs, as he spoke: "And will you really?&mdash;" and there he
  paused, unable to complete the question.</p>

  <p>"Remove her?" added Catiline, completing the sentence which he had left
  unfinished, "Ay! will I. Just as I would a serpent from my path!"</p>

  <p>"And that done, what is to follow?" Lentulus inquired, with an assumption
  of coolness, which in truth he did not feel.</p>

  <p>"We will get rid of Arvina. And then, as it wants but four days of the
  elections, we may keep all things quiet till the time."</p>

  <p>"Be it so!" answered the other. "When do we meet again to settle these
  things finally?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow, at the house of Laeca, at the sixth hour of night."</p>

  <p>"Will all be there?"</p>

  <p>"All the most faithful; until then, farewell!"</p>

  <p>"Farewell."</p>

  <p>And they parted; Lentulus hurrying to the Forum, to take his seat on the
  praetor's chair, and there preside in judgment&mdash;fit magistrate!&mdash;on
  men, the guiltiest of whom were pure as the spotless snow, when compared with
  his own conscious guilt; and Catiline to glide through dark streets, visiting
  discontented artizans, debauched mechanics, desperate gamblers, scattering
  dark and ambiguous promises, and stirring up that worthless rabble&mdash;who,
  with all to gain and nothing to lose by civil strife and tumult, abound in
  all great cities&mdash;to violence and thirst of blood.</p>

  <p>Three or four hours at least he spent thus; and well satisfied with his
  progress, delighted by the increasing turbulence of the fierce and
  irresponsible democracy, and rejoicing in having gained many new and fitting
  converts to his creed, he returned homeward, ripe for fresh villainy. Chaerea
  met him on the threshold, with his face pale and haggard from excitement.</p>

  <p>"Catiline," he exclaimed, "she had gone forth already, before you bade me
  watch her!"</p>

  <p>"She!&mdash;Who, slave? who?" and knowing perfectly who was meant, yet
  hoping, in his desperation, that he heard not aright, he caught the freedman
  by the throat, and shook him furiously.</p>

  <p>"Lucia Orestilla," faltered the trembling menial.</p>

  <p>"And has not returned?" thundered the traitor.</p>

  <p>"Catiline, no!"</p>

  <p>"Liar! and fool!" cried the other, gnashing his teeth with rage, as he
  gave way to his ungovernable fury, and hurling him with all his might against
  the marble door-post.</p>

  <p>The freedman fell, like a dead man, with the blood gushing from his nose
  and mouth; and Catiline, striding across the prostrate body, retired sullenly
  and slowly to muse on the disappointment of this his most atrocious project,
  in the darkness and solitude of his own private chamber whither none dared
  intrude unsummoned.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch111"
     name="ch111"></a>XI. &mdash; THE RELEASE</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>And, for that right is right, to follow right<br>
  Were wisdom, in the scorn of consequence.</i><br>
  &mdash;Tennyson. None.</p><br>

  <p class="first">PAULLUS ARVINA sat alone in a small chamber of his own
  house. Books were before him, his favorites; the authors, whose words struck
  chords the most kindred in his soul; but though his eye rested on the fair
  manuscripts, it was evident that his mind was absent. The slender
  preparations for the first Roman meal were displayed temptingly on a board,
  not far from his elbow; but they were all untouched. His hair was
  dishevelled; his face pale, either from watching or excitement; and his eye
  wild and haggard. He wore a loose morning gown of colored linen, and his bare
  feet were thrust carelessly into unmatched slippers.</p>

  <p>It was past noon already; nor, though his favorite freedman Thrasea had
  warned him several times of the lateness of the hour, had he shewn the least
  willingness to exert himself, so far even as to dress his hair, or put on
  attire befitting the business of the day.</p>

  <p>It could not but be seen, at a glance, that he was ill at ease; and in
  truth he was much perturbed by what had passed on the preceding night, and
  very anxious with regard to the future.</p>

  <p>Nor was it without ample cause that he was restless and disturbed; within
  the last three days he had by his own instability of purpose, and vacillating
  tastes and temper brought himself down from as enviable a position as well
  can be imagined, to one as insecure, unfortunate, and perilous.</p>

  <p>That he had made to himself in Catiline an enemy, as deadly, as
  persevering, as relentless as any man could have upon his track; an enemy
  against whom force and fraud would most likely be proved equally unavailing,
  he entertained no doubt. But brave as he was, and fearless, both by principle
  and practice, he cared less for this, even while he confessed to himself,
  that he must be on his guard now alway against both open violence and secret
  murder, than he did for the bitter feeling, that he was distrusted; that he
  had brought himself into suspicion and ill-odor with the great man, in whose
  eyes he would have given so much to stand fairly, and whose good-will, and
  good opinion, but two little days before, he flattered himself that he had
  conciliated by his manly conduct.</p>

  <p>Again, when he thought of Julia, there was no balm to his heart, no
  unction to his wounded conscience! What if she knew not, nor suspected
  anything of his disloyalty, did not he know it, feel it in every nerve? Did
  he not read tacit reproaches in every beam of her deep tranquil eye? Did he
  not fancy some allusion to it, in every tone of her low sweet voice? Did he
  not tremble at every air of heaven, lest it should waft the rumor of his
  infidelity to the chaste ears of her, whom alone he loved and honored? Did he
  not know that one whisper of that disgraceful truth would break off, and
  forever, the dear hopes, on which all his future happiness depended? And was
  it not most possible, most probable, that any moment might reveal to her the
  fatal tidings?&mdash;The rage of Catiline, frustrated in his foul designs,
  the revengeful jealousy of Lucia, the vigilance of the distrustful consul,
  might each or all at any moment bring to light that which he would have given
  all but life to bury in oblivion.</p>

  <p>For a long time he had sat musing deeply on the perils of his false
  position, but though he had taxed every energy, and strained every faculty to
  devise some means by which to extricate himself from the toils, into which he
  had so blindly rushed, he could think of no scheme, resolve upon no course of
  action, which should set him at liberty, as he had been before his unlucky
  interview with the conspirator.</p>

  <p>At times he dreamed of casting himself at the feet of Cicero, and
  confessing to that great and generous statesman all his temptations, all his
  trials, all his errors; of linking himself heart and soul with the determined
  patriots, who were prepared to live or die with the constitution, and the
  liberties of the republic; but the oath!&mdash;the awful imprecation, by
  which he had bound himself, by which he had devoted all that he loved to the
  Infernal Gods, recurred to his mind, and shook it with an earth-quake's
  power. And he, the bold free thinker, the daring and unflinching soldier,
  bound hand and foot by a silly superstition, trembled&mdash;aye, trembled,
  and confessed to his secret soul that there was one thing which he ought to
  do, yet dared not!</p>

  <p>Anon, maddened by the apparent hopelessness of ever being able to recur to
  the straight road; of ever more regaining his own self-esteem, or the respect
  of virtuous citizens&mdash;forced, as he seemed to be, to play a neutral
  part&mdash;the meanest of all parts&mdash;in the impending struggle&mdash;of
  ever gaining eminence or fame under the banners of the commonwealth; he
  dreamed of giving himself up, as fate appeared to have given him already up,
  to the designs of Catiline! He pictured to himself rank, station, power,
  wealth, to be won under the ensigns of revolt; and asked himself, as many a
  self-deluded slave of passion has asked himself before, if eminence, however
  won, be not glory; if success in the world's eyes be not fame, and rectitude
  and excellence.</p>

  <p>But patriotism, the old Roman virtue, clear and undying in the hardest and
  most corrupt hearts, roused itself in him to do battle with the juggling
  fiends tempting him to his ruin; and whenever patriotism half-defeated
  appeared to yield the ground, the image of his Julia&mdash;his Julia, never
  to be won by any indirection, never to be deceived by any sophistry, never to
  be deluded into smiling for one moment on a traitor&mdash;rose clear and
  palpable before him and the mists were dispersed instantly, and the foes of
  his better judgment scattered to the winds and routed.</p>

  <p>Thus wavering, he sat, infirm of purpose, ungoverned&mdash;whence indeed
  all his errors&mdash;by any principle or unity of action; when suddenly the
  sound of a faint and hesitating knock of the bronze ring on the outer door
  reached his ear. The chamber, which he occupied, was far removed from the
  vestibule, divided from it by the whole length of the atrium, and fauces; yet
  so still was the interior of the house, and so inordinately sharpened was his
  sense of hearing by anxiety and apprehension, that he recognized the sound
  instantly, and started to his feet, fearing he knew not what.</p>

  <p>The footsteps of the slave, though he hurried to undo the door, seemed to
  the eager listener as slow as the pace of the dull tortoise; and the short
  pause, which followed after the door had been opened, he fancied to be an
  hour in duration. Long as he thought it, however, it was too short to enable
  him to conquer his agitation, or to control the tumultuous beating of his
  heart, which increased to such a degree, as he heard the freedman ushering
  the new comer toward the room in which he was sitting, that he grew very
  faint, and turned as pale as ashes.</p>

  <p>Had he been asked what it was that he apprehended, he could assuredly have
  assigned no reasonable cause to his tremors. Yet this man was as brave, as
  elastic in temperament, as tried steel. Oppose him to any definite and real
  peril, not a nerve in his frame would quiver; yet here he was, by imaginary
  terrors, and the disquietude of an uneasy conscience, reduced to more than
  woman's weakness.</p>

  <p>The door was opened, and Thrasea appeared alone upon the threshold, with a
  mysterious expression on his blunt features.</p>

  <p>"How now?" asked Paullus, "what is this?&mdash;Did I not tell you, that I
  would not be disturbed this morning?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! master," answered the sturdy freedman; "but she said that it was a
  matter of great moment, and that she would&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>She!</i>&mdash;Who?" exclaimed Arvina, starting up from the chair,
  which he had resumed as his servant entered. "Whom do you mean by
  <i>She</i>?"</p>

  <p>"The girl who waits in the tablinum, to know if you will receive her."</p>

  <p>"The girl!&mdash;what girl? do you know her?"</p>

  <p>"No, master, she is very tall, and slender, yet round withal and
  beautifully formed. Her steps are as light as the doe's upon the Haemus, and
  as graceful. She has the finest foot and ancle mine eyes ever looked upon. I
  am sure too that her face is beautiful, though she is closely wrapped in a
  long white veil. Her voice, though exquisitely sweet and gentle, is full of a
  strange command, half proud and half persuasive. I could not, for my life,
  resist her bidding."</p>

  <p>"Well! well! admit her, though I would fain be spared the trouble. I doubt
  not it is some soft votary of Flora; and I am not in the vein for such
  dalliance now."</p>

  <p>"No! Paullus, no! it is a Patrician lady. I will wager my freedom on it,
  although she is dressed plainly, and, as I told you, closely veiled."</p>

  <p>"Not Julia? by the Gods! it is not Julia Serena?" exclaimed the young man,
  in tones of inquiry, blent with wonder.</p>

  <p>But, as he spoke, the door was opened once more; and the veiled figure
  entered, realizing by her appearance all the good freedman's eulogies. It
  seemed that she had overheard the last words of Arvina; for, without raising
  her veil, she said in a soft low voice, full of melancholy pathos,</p>

  <p>"Alas! no, Paullus, it is not your Julia. But it is one, who has perhaps
  some claim to your attention; and who, at all events, will not detain you
  long, on matters most important to yourself. I have intruded thus, fearing
  you were about to deny me; because that which I have to say will brook no
  denial."</p>

  <p>The freedman had withdrawn abruptly the very moment that the lady entered;
  and, closing the door firmly behind him, stood on guard out of earshot, lest
  any one should break upon his young lord's privacy. But Paullus knew not
  this; scarce knew, indeed, that they were alone; when, as she ceased, he made
  two steps forward, exclaiming in a piercing voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ye Gods! ye Gods! Lucia Orestilla!"</p>

  <p>"Aye! Paul," replied the girl, raising her veil, and showing her beautiful
  face, no longer burning with bright amorous blushes, her large soft eyes, no
  longer beaming unchaste invitation, but pale, and quiet, and suffused with
  tender sadness, "it is indeed Lucia. But wherefore this surprise, I might say
  this terror? You were not, I remember, so averse, the last time we were alone
  together."</p>

  <p>Her voice was steady, and her whole manner perfectly composed, as she
  addressed him. There was neither reproach nor irony in her tones, nor
  anything that betokened even the sense of injury endured. Yet was Arvina more
  unmanned by her serene and tranquil bearing, than he would have been by the
  most violent reproaches.</p>

  <p>"Alas! alas! what shall I say to you," he faltered, "Lucia; Lucia, whom I
  dare not call mine."</p>

  <p>"Say nothing, Paullus Arvina," she replied, "thou art a noble and generous
  soul?&mdash;Say nothing, for I know what thou would'st say. I have said it to
  myself many times already. Oh! wo is me! too late! too late! But I have come
  hither, now, upon a brief and a pleasant errand. For it <i>is</i> pleasant,
  let them scoff who will! I say, it <i>is</i> pleasant to do right, let what
  may come of it. Would God, that I had always thought so!"</p>

  <p>"Would God, indeed!" answered the young man, "then had we not both been
  wretched."</p>

  <p>"Wretched! aye! most, most wretched!" cried the girl, a large bright tear
  standing in either eye. "And art thou wretched, Paullus."</p>

  <p>"Utterly wretched!" he said, with a deep groan, and buried his face for a
  moment in his hands. "Even before I looked upon you, thought of you, I was
  miserable! and now, now&mdash;words cannot paint my anguish, my
  self-degradation!"</p>

  <p>"Aye! is it so?" she said, a faint sad smile flitting across her pallid
  lips. "Why I should feel abased and self-degraded, I can well comprehend. I,
  who have fallen from the high estate, the purity, the wealth, the
  consciousness of chaste and virtuous maidenhood! I, the despised, the
  castaway, the fallen! But thou, thou!&mdash;from thee I looked but for
  reproaches&mdash;the just reproaches I have earned by my faithless folly! I
  thought, indeed, to have found you wretched, writhing in the dark bonds which
  I, most miserable, cast around you; and cursing her who fettered you!"</p>

  <p>"Cursing myself," he answered, "rather. Cursing my own insane and selfish
  passion, which alone trammelled me, which alone ruined one, better and
  brighter fifty fold than I!&mdash;alas! alas! Lucia."</p>

  <p>And forgetful of all that he had heard to her disparagement from her bad
  father's lips, or, if he half remembered discrediting all in that moment of
  excitement, he flung himself at her feet, and grovelled like a crushed worm
  on the floor, in the degrading consciousness of guilt.</p>

  <p>"Arise, arise for shame, young Arvina!" she said. "The ground, at a
  woman's feet, is no place for a man ever; least of all <i>such</i> a woman's.
  Arise, and mark me, when I tell you that, which to tell you, only, I came
  hither. Arise, I say, and make me not scorn the man, whom I admire,
  whom&mdash;wo is me! I love."</p>

  <p>Paullus regained his feet slowly, and abashed; it seemed that all the
  pride and haughtiness of his character had given way at once. Mute and
  humiliated, he sank into a chair, while she continued standing erect and
  self-sustained before him by conscious, though new, rectitude of purpose.</p>

  <p>"Mark me, I say, Arvina, when I tell you, that you are as free as air from
  the oath, with which I bound you. That wicked vow compels you only so long as
  I hold you pledged to its performance. Lo! it is nothing any more&mdash;for
  I, to whom alone of mortals you are bound, now and forever release you. The
  Gods, above and below, whom you called to witness it, are witnesses no more
  against you. For I annul it here; I give you back your plight. It is as
  though it never had been spoken!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed? indeed? am I free?&mdash;Good, noble, generous, dear, Lucia, is
  it true? can it be? I am free, and at thy bidding?"</p>

  <p>"Free as the winds of heaven, Paullus, that come whence no man knoweth,
  and go whither they will soever, and no mortal hindereth them! As free as the
  winds, Paullus," she repeated, "and I trust soon to be as happy."</p>

  <p>"But wherefore," added the young man, "have you done this? You said you
  would release me <i>never</i>, and now all unsolicited you come and say 'you
  are free, Paullus,' almost before the breath is cold upon my lips that swore
  obedience. This is most singular, and inconsistent."</p>

  <p>"What in the wide world <i>is</i> consistent, Paullus, except virtue? That
  indeed is immutable, eternal, one, the same on earth as in heaven, present,
  and past, and forever. But what else, I beseech you, is consistent, or here
  or anywhere, that you should dream of finding me, a weak wild wanton girl, of
  firmer stuff than heroes? Are you, even in your own imagination, are you, I
  say, consistent?"</p>

  <p>She spoke eagerly, perhaps wildly; for the very part of self-denial, which
  she was playing, stirred her mind to its lowest depths; and the great change,
  which had been going on within for many hours, and was still in powerful
  progress, excited her fancy, and kindled all her strongest feelings; and, as
  is not unfrequently the case, all the profound vague thoughts, which had so
  long lain mute and dormant, found light at once, and eloquent expression.</p>

  <p>Paullus gazed at her, in astonishment, almost in awe. Could this be the
  sensual, passionate voluptuary he had known two days since?&mdash;the
  strange, unprincipled, impulsive being, who yielded like the reed, to every
  gust of passion&mdash;this deep, clear, vigorous thinker! It was indeed a
  change to puzzle sager heads than that of Arvina! a transformation, sudden
  and beautiful as that from the torpid earthy grub, to the swift-winged
  etherial butterfly! He gazed at her, until she smiled in reply to his look of
  bewilderment; and then he met her smile with a sad heavy sigh, and
  answered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Most inconsistent, I! alas! that I should say it, far worse than
  inconsistent, most false to truth and virtue, most recreant to honor! Have
  not I, whose most ardent aspirations were set on glory virtuously won, whose
  soul, as I fancied, was athirst for knowledge and for truth, have not I bound
  myself by the most dire and dreadful oaths, to find my good in evil, my truth
  in a lie, my glory in black infamy?&mdash;Have not I, loving another better
  than my own life, won thee to love, poor Lucia, and won thee by base
  falsehood to thy ruin?"</p>

  <p>"No! no!" she interrupted him, "this last thing you have not done, Arvina.
  Awake! you shall deceive yourself no longer! Of this last wrong you are as
  innocent as the unspotted snow; and I, I only, own the guilt, as I shall bear
  the punishment! Hear first, why I release you from your oath; and then, if
  you care to listen to a sad tale, you shall know by what infamy of others,
  one, who might else have been both innocent and happy, has been made infamous
  and foul and vile, and wretched; a thing hateful to herself, and loathsome to
  the world; a being with but one hope left, to expiate her many crimes by one
  act of virtue, and then to die! to die young, very young, unwept, unhonored,
  friendless, and an orphan&mdash;aye! from her very birth, more than an
  orphan!"</p>

  <p>"Say on," replied the young man, "say on, Lucia; and would to heaven you
  could convince me that I have not wronged you. Say on, then; first, if you
  will, why you have released me; but above all, speak of yourself&mdash;speak
  freely, and oh! if I can aid, or protect, or comfort you, believe me I will
  do it at my life's utmost peril."</p>

  <p>"I do believe you, Paullus. I did believe that, ere you spoke it. First,
  then, I set you free&mdash;and free you are henceforth, forever."</p>

  <p>"But wherefore?"</p>

  <p>"Because you are betrayed. Because I know all that fell out last night.
  Because I know darker villainy plotted against you, yet to come; villainy
  from which, tramelled by this oath, no earthly power can save you. Because, I
  know not altogether why or how, my mind has been changed of late completely,
  and I will lend myself no more to projects, which I loathe, and infamy which
  I abhor. Because&mdash;because&mdash;because, in a word, I love you Paullus!
  Better than all I have, or hope to have on earth."</p>

  <p>"But you must not," he replied, gravely yet tenderly,
  "because"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You love another," she interrupted him, very quickly, "You love Julia
  Serena, Hortensia's lovely daughter; and she loves you, and you are to be
  wedded soon. You see," she added, with a faint painful smile, "that I know
  everything about you. I knew it long since; long, long before I gave myself
  to you; even before I loved you, Paul&mdash;for I have loved you, also,
  long!"</p>

  <p>"Loved me long!" he exclaimed, in astonishment, "how can that be, when you
  never saw me until the day before yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! yes I have," she answered sadly. "I have seen you and known you many
  years; though you have forgotten me, if even, which I doubt, you ever noticed
  me at all. But I can bring it to your mind. Have you forgotten how, six
  summers since, as you were riding down the Collis Hortulorum, you passed a
  little girl weeping by the wayside?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Over a wounded kid? No, I remember very well. A great country boor had
  hurt it with a stone."</p>

  <p>"And you," exclaimed the girl, with her eyes flashing fire, "you sprang
  down from your horse, and chastised him, till he whined like a beaten hound,
  though he was twice as big as you were; and then you bound up the kid's
  wound, and wiped away the tears&mdash;innocent tears they were&mdash;of the
  little girl, and parted her hair, and kissed her on the forehead. That little
  girl was I, and I have kept that kiss upon my brow, aye, and in my heart too!
  until now. No lips of man or woman have ever touched that spot which your
  lips hallowed. From that day forth I have loved you, I have adored you,
  Paullus. From that day forth I have watched all your ways, unseen and
  unsuspected. I have seen you do fifty kind, and generous, and gallant
  actions; but never saw you do one base, or tyrannous, or cowardly, or
  cruel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Until that fatal night!" he said, with a deep groan. "May the Gods pardon
  me! I never shall forgive my self."</p>

  <p>"No! no! I tell you, no!" cried the girl, impetuously. "I tell you, that I
  was not deceived, if I fell; but I did not fall then! I knew that you loved
  Julia, years ago. I knew that I never could be yours in honor; and that put
  fire and madness in my brain, and despair in my heart. And my home was a
  hell, and those who should have been my guides and saviours were my
  destroyers; and I am&mdash;<i>what I am</i>; but in that you had no share. On
  that night, I but obeyed the accursed bidding of the blackest and most
  atrocious monster that pollutes Jove's pure air by his breath!"</p>

  <p>"Bidding," he exclaimed, starting back in horror, "Catiline's
  bidding?"</p>

  <p>"My father's," answered the miserable girl. "My own father's bidding!"</p>

  <p>"Ye gods! ye gods! His own daughter's purity!"</p>

  <p>"Purity!" she replied, with a smile of sad bitter irony. "Do you think
  purity could long exist in the same house with Catiline and Orestilla?
  Paullus Arvina, the scenes I have beheld, the orgies I have shared, the
  atmosphere of voluptuous sin I have breathed, almost from my cradle, had
  changed the cold heart of the virgin huntress into the fiery pulses of the
  wanton Venus! Since I was ten years old, I have been, wo is me! familiar with
  all luxury, all infamy, all degradation!"</p>

  <p>"Great Nemesis!" he cried, turning up his indignant eyes toward heaven.
  "But, in the name of all the Gods! wherefore, wherefore? Even to the worst,
  the most debased of wretches, their children's honor is still dear."</p>

  <p>"Nothing is dear to Catiline but riot, and debauchery, and murder! Sin,
  for its own sake, even more than for the rewards its offers to its votaries!
  Paullus, men called me beautiful! But what cared I for beauty, that charmed
  all but him, whom alone I desired to fascinate? Men called me beautiful, I
  say! and in my father's sight that beauty became precious, when he foresaw
  that it might prove a means of winning followers to his accursed cause! Then
  was I educated in all arts, all graces, all accomplishments that might
  enhance my charms; and, as those fatal charms could avail him nothing, so
  long as purity remained or virtue, I was taught, ah! too easily! to esteem
  pleasure the sole good, passion the only guide! Taught thus, by my own
  parents! Curses, curses, and shame upon them! Pity me, pity me, Paullus. Oh!
  you are bound to pity me! for had I not loved you, fatally, desperately
  loved, and known that I could not win you, perchance&mdash;perchance I had
  not fallen. Oh! pity me, and pardon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pardon you, Lucia," he interrupted her. "What have you done to me, or who
  am I, that you should crave my pardon?"</p>

  <p>"What have I done? Do you ask in mockery? Have not I made you the partaker
  of my sin? Have not I lured you into falsehood, momentary falsehood it is
  true, yet still falsehood, to your Julia? Have I not tangled you in the nets
  of this most foul conspiracy? Betrayed you, a bound slave, to the
  monster&mdash;the soul-destroyer?"</p>

  <p>Arvina groaned aloud, but made no answer, so deeply did his own thoughts
  afflict, so terribly did her strong words oppress him.</p>

  <p>"But it is over&mdash;it is over now!" She exclaimed exultingly. "His
  reign of wickedness is over! The tool, which he moulded for his own purposes,
  shall be the instrument to quell him. The pitfall which he would have digged
  in the way of others, shall be to them a door whereby they shall escape his
  treason, and his ruin. You are saved, my Arvina! By all the Gods! you are
  saved! And, if it lost me once, it has preserved me now&mdash;my wild,
  unchangeable, and undying love for you, alone of men! For it has made me
  think! Has quenched the insane flames that burned within me! Has given me new
  views, new principles, new hopes! Evil no more shall be my good, nor infamy
  my pride! If, myself, I am most unhappy, I will live henceforth, while I do
  live, to make others happy! I will live henceforth for two
  things&mdash;revenge and retribution! By all the Gods! Julia and you, my
  Paullus, shall be happy! By all the Gods! he who destroyed me for his
  pleasure, shall be destroyed in turn, for mine!"</p>

  <p>"Lucia! think! think! he is your father!"</p>

  <p>"Perish the monster! I have not&mdash;never had father, or home,
  or&mdash;&mdash;Speak not to me; speak not of him, or I shall lose what poor
  remains of reason his vile plots have left me. Perish!&mdash;by all the
  powers of hell, he shall perish, miserably!&mdash;miserably! And you, you,
  Paullus, must be the weapon that shall strike him!"</p>

  <p>"Never the weapon in a daughter's hand to strike a father," answered
  Paullus, "no! though he were himself a parricide!"</p>

  <p>"He is!&mdash;he is a parricide!&mdash;the parricide of Rome
  itself!&mdash;the murderer of our common mother!&mdash;the sacrilegious
  stabber of his holy country! Hear me, and tremble! It lacks now two days of
  the Consular election. If Catiline go not down ere that day cometh, then Rome
  goes down, on that day, and forever?"</p>

  <p>"You are mad, girl, to say so."</p>

  <p>"You are mad, youth, if you discredit me. Do not I know? am not I the
  sharer? the tempter to the guilt myself? and am not I the mistress of its
  secrets? Was it not for this, that I gave myself to you? was it not unto this
  that I bound you by the oath, which now I restore to you? was it not by this,
  that I would have held you my minion and my paramour? And is it not to reveal
  this, that I now have come? I tell you, I discovered, how he would
  yesternight have slain you by the gladiator's sword; discovered how he now
  would slay you, by the perverted sword of Justice, as Medon's, as Volero's
  murderer; convicting you of his own crimes, as he hath many men before, by
  his suborned and perjured clients&mdash;his comrades on the Praetor's chair!
  I tell you, I discovered but just now, that me too he will cut off in the
  flower of my youth; in the heat of the passions, he fomented; in the rankness
  of the soft sins, he taught me&mdash;cut me off&mdash;me, his own ruined and
  polluted child&mdash;by the same poisoned chalice, which made his house clear
  for my wretched mother's nuptials!"</p>

  <p>"Can these things be," cried Paullus, "and the Gods yet withhold their
  thunder?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes I think," the girl answered wildly, "that there are
  <i>no</i>Gods, Paullus. Do you believe in Mars and Venus?"</p>

  <p>"In Gods, whose worship were adultery and murder?" said Arvina. "Not I,
  indeed, poor Lucia."</p>

  <p>"If these be Gods, there is no truth, no meaning in the name of virtue. If
  not these, what is God?"</p>

  <p>"All things!" replied the young man solemnly. "Whatever moves, whatever
  <i>is</i>, is God. The universe is but the body, that clothes his eternal
  spirit; the winds are his breath; the sunshine is his smile; the gentle dews
  are the tears of his compassion! Time is the creature of his hand, eternity
  his dwelling place, virtue his law, his oracles the soul of every living
  man!"</p>

  <p>"Beautiful," cried the girl. "Beautiful, if it were but true!"</p>

  <p>"It is true&mdash;as true, as the sun in heaven; as certain as his course
  through the changeless seasons."</p>

  <p>"How? how?" she asked eagerly. "What makes it certain?"</p>

  <p>"The certainty of death!" he answered.</p>

  <p>"Ah! death, death! that is a mystery indeed. And after that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Everlasting life!"</p>

  <p>"Ha! do you believe that too? They tell me all that is a fable, a folly,
  and a falsehood!"</p>

  <p>"Perchance it would be well for them it were so."</p>

  <p>"Yes!" she replied. "Yes! But who taught you?"</p>

  <p>"Plato! Immortal Plato!"</p>

  <p>"Ha! I will read him; I will read Plato."</p>

  <p>"What! do you understand Greek too, Lucia?"</p>

  <p>"How else should I have sung Anacreon, and learned the Lesbian arts of
  Sappho? But we have strayed wide of our subject, and time presses. Will you
  denounce, me, Catiline?"</p>

  <p>"Not I! I will perish sooner."</p>

  <p>"You will do so, and all Rome with you."</p>

  <p>"Prove that to me, and&mdash;&mdash;But it is impossible."</p>

  <p>"Prove that to you, will you denounce him?"</p>

  <p>"I will save Rome!"</p>

  <p>"Will you denounce him?"</p>

  <p>"If otherwise, I may preserve my country, no."</p>

  <p>"Otherwise, you cannot. Speak! will you?"</p>

  <p>"I must know all."</p>

  <p>"You shall. Mark me, then judge." And rapidly, concisely, clearly, she
  revealed to him the dread secret. She concealed nothing, neither the ends of
  the conspiracy, nor the names of the conspirators. She asseverated to him the
  appalling fact, that half the noblest, eldest families of Rome, were either
  active members of the plot, sworn to spare no man, or secret well-wishers,
  content at first to remain neutral, and then to share the spoils of empire.
  According to her shewing, the Curii, the Portii, the Syllae, the Cethegi, the
  great Cornelian house, the Vargunteii, the Autronii, and the Longini, were
  all for the most part implicated, although some branches of the Portian and
  Cornelian houses had not been yet approached by the seducers. Crassus, she
  told him too, the richest citizen of Rome, and Caius Julius Caesar, the most
  popular, awaited but the first success to join the parricides of the
  Republic.</p>

  <p>He listened thoughtfully, earnestly, until she had finished her narration,
  and then shook his head doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "you must be deceived, poor Lucia. I do not see how
  these things can be. These men, whom you have named, are all of the first
  houses of the state; have all of them, either themselves or their
  forefathers, bled for the commonwealth. How then should they now wish to
  destroy it? They are men, too, of all parties and all factions; the Syllae,
  the proudest and haughtiest aristocrats of Rome. Your father, also, belonged
  to the Dictator's faction, while the Cornelii and the Curii have belonged
  ever to the tribunes' party. How should this be? or how should those whose
  pride, whose interest, whose power alike, rest on the maintenance of their
  order, desire to mow down the Patrician houses, like grass beneath the
  scythe, and give their honors to the rabble? How, above all, should Crassus,
  whose estate is worth seven thousand talents,(16) consisting, too, of
  buildings in the heart of Rome, join with a party whose watch-words are fire
  and plunder, partition of estates, and death to the rich? You see yourself
  that these things cannot be; that they are not consistent. You must have been
  deceived by their insolent and drunken boasting!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">16. Seven thousand talents, about 7,500,000 dollars.</p>

  <p>"Consistent!" she replied, with vehement and angry irony. "Still harping
  on consistency! Are virtuous men then consistent, that you expect vicious men
  to be so? Oh, the false wisdom, the false pride of man! You tell me these
  things cannot be&mdash;perhaps they cannot; but they <i>are!</i> I know
  it&mdash;I have heard, seen, partaken all! But if you can be convinced only
  by seeing that the plans of men, whose every action is insanity and frenzy,
  are wise and reasonable, perish yourself in your blindness, and let Rome
  perish with you! I can no more. Farewell! I leave you to your madness!"</p>

  <p>"Hold! hold!" he cried, moved greatly by her vehemence, "are you indeed so
  sure of this? What, in the name of all the Gods, can be their motive?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! sure!" she answered scornfully; "I thought I was speaking to a
  capable and clever man of action; I see that it is a mere dreamer, to whose
  waking senses I appeal vainly. If <i>you</i> be not sure, also, you must be
  weaker than I can conceive. Why, if there was no plot, would Catiline have
  slaughtered Medon, lest it should be revealed? Why would he, else, have
  striven to bind you by oaths; and to what, if not to schemes of sacrilege and
  treason? Why would he else have murdered Volero? why planted ambushes against
  your life? why would he now meditate my death, his own child's death, that I
  am forced to fly his house? Oh! in the wide world there is no such folly, as
  that of the over wise! Motive&mdash;motive enough have they! While the
  Patrician senate, and the Patrician Consuls hold with firm hands the
  government, full well they know, that in vain violence or fraud may strive to
  wrest it from them. Let but the people hold the reins of empire, and the
  first smooth-tongued, slippery demagogue, the first bloody, conquering
  soldier, grasps them, and is the King, Dictator, Emperor, of Rome! Never yet
  in the history of nations, has despotism sprung out of oligarchic sway! Never
  yet has democracy but yielded to the first despot's usurpation! <i>They</i>
  have not read in vain the annals of past ages, if you have done so,
  Paullus."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed, "look they so far ahead? Ambition, then, it is but a
  new form of ambition?"</p>

  <p>"Will you denounce them, Paullus?"</p>

  <p>"At least, I will warn the Consul!"</p>

  <p>"You must denounce them, or he will credit nothing."</p>

  <p>"I will save Rome."</p>

  <p>"Enough! enough! I am avenged, and thou shalt be happy. Go to the Consul,
  straightway! make your own terms, ask office, rank, wealth, power. He will
  grant all! and now, farewell! Me you will see no more forever! Farewell,
  Paullus Arvina, fare you well forever! And sometimes, when you are happy in
  the chaste arms of Julia, sometimes think, Paullus, of poor, unhappy, loving,
  lost, lost Lucia!"</p>

  <p>"Whither, by all the Gods, I adjure you! whither would you go, Lucia?"</p>

  <p>"Far hence! far hence, my Paullus. Where I may live obscure in tranquil
  solitude, where I may die when my time comes, in peace and innocence. In Rome
  I were not safe an hour!"</p>

  <p>"Tell me where! tell me Lucia, how I may aid, how guard, console, or
  counsel you."</p>

  <p>"You can do none of these things, Paullus. All is arranged for the best.
  Within an hour I shall be journeying hence, never to pass the gates, to hear
  the turbulent roar, to breathe the smoky skies, to taste the maddening
  pleasures, of glorious, guilty Rome! There is but one thing you can do, which
  will minister to my well-being&mdash;but one boon you can grant me. Will
  you?"</p>

  <p>"And do you ask, Lucia?"</p>

  <p>"Will you swear?" she inquired, with a faint melancholy smile. "Nay! it
  concerns no one but myself. You may swear safely."</p>

  <p>"I do, by the God of faith!"</p>

  <p>"Never seek, then, by word or deed, to learn whither I have gone, or where
  I dwell. Look! I am armed," and she drew out a dagger as she spoke. "If I am
  tracked or followed, whether by friend or foe, this will free me from
  persecution; and it shall do so, by the living lights of heaven! This, after
  all, is the one true, the last friend of the wretched. All hail to thee,
  healer of all intolerable anguish!" and she kissed the bright blade, before
  she consigned it to the sheath; and then, stretching out both hands to
  Paullus, she cried, "You have sworn&mdash;Remember!"</p>

  <p>"And you promise me," he replied, "that, if at any time you need a friend,
  a defender, one who would lay down life itself to aid you, you will call on
  me, wheresoever I may be, fearless and undoubting. For, from the festive
  board, or the nuptial bed, from the most sacred altar of the Gods, or from
  the solemn funeral pyre, I will come instant to thy bidding. 'Lucia needs
  Paullus,' shall be words shriller than the war-trumpet's summons to my
  conscious soul."</p>

  <p>"I promise you," she said, "willingly, most willingly. And now kiss me,
  Paullus. Julia herself would not forbid this last, sad, pious kiss! Not my
  lips! not my lips! Part my hair on my brows, and kiss me on the forehead,
  where your lips, years ago, shed freshness, and hope that has not yet died
  all away. Sweet, sweet! it is pure and sweet, it allays the fierce burning of
  my brain. Fare you well, Paul, and remember&mdash;remember Lucia
  Orestilla."</p>

  <p>She withdrew herself from his arm modestly, as she spoke, lowered her
  veil, turned, and was gone. Many a day and week elapsed, and weeks were
  merged in months, ere any one, who knew her, again saw Catiline's unhappy,
  guilty daughter.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch112"
     name="ch112"></a>XII. &mdash; THE FORGE</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>I saw a smith stand with his hammer thus,<br>
  The whilst his iron did on anvil cool.</i><br>
  &mdash;King John.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT was the evening of the sixteenth day before the calends
  of November, or, according to modern numeration, the eighteenth of October,
  the eve of the consular elections, when a considerable number of rough
  hardy-looking men were assembled beneath the wide low-browed arch of a
  blacksmith's forge, situated near the intersection of the Cyprian Lane with
  the Sacred Way, and commanding a full view of the latter noble
  thoroughfare.</p>

  <p>It was already fast growing dark, and the natural obscurity of the hour
  was increased by the thickness of the lowering clouds, which overspread the
  whole firmament of heaven, and seemed to portend a tempest. But from the jaws
  of the semicircular arch of Roman brick, within which the group was
  collected, a broad and wavering sheet of light was projected far into the
  street, and over the fronts of the buildings opposite, rising and falling in
  obedience to the blast of the huge bellows, which might be heard groaning and
  laboring within. The whole interior of the roomy vault was filled with a
  lurid crimson light, diversified at times by a brighter and more vivid glare
  as a column of living flame would shoot up from the embers, or long trains of
  radiant sparks leap from the bounding anvil. Against this clear back ground
  the moving figures of the strong limbed grimy giants, who plied their mighty
  sledges with incessant zeal on the red hot metal, were defined sharply and
  picturesquely; while alternately red lights and heavy shadows flickered
  across the forms and features of many other men, who stood around watching
  the progress of the work, and occasionally speaking rapidly, and with a good
  deal of gesticulation, at intervals when the preponderant din of hammers
  ceased, and permitted conversation to be carried on audibly.</p>

  <p>At this moment, however, there was no such pause; for the embers in the
  furnace were at a white heat, and flashes of lambent flame were leaping out
  of the chimney top, and vanishing in the dark clouds overhead. A dozen bars
  of glowing steel had been drawn simultaneously from the charcoal, and thrice
  as many massive hammers were forging them into the rude shapes of weapons on
  the anvils, which, notwithstanding their vast weight, appeared to leap and
  reel, under the blows that were rained upon them faster than hail in
  winter.</p>

  <p>But high above the roar of the blazing chimney, above the din of the
  groaning stithy, high pealed the notes of a wild Alcaic ode, to which,
  chaunted by the stentorian voices of the powerful mechanics, the clanging
  sledges made a stormy but appropriate music. "Strike, strike the iron," thus
  echoed the stirring strain,</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Strike, strike the iron, children o' Mulciber,<br>
  Hot from the charcoal cheerily glimmering!<br>
  Swing, swing, my boys, high swing the sledges!<br>
  Heave at it, heave at it, all!<br>
  Together! Great Mars, the war God, watches ye laboring<br>
  Joyously. Joyous watches the gleam o' the<br>
  Bright sparkles, upsoaring the faster,<br>
  Faster as our merry blows revive them.<br>
  Well knoweth He that clang. It arouses him,<br>
  Heard far aloof! He laughs on us hammering<br>
  The sword, the clear harness of iron,<br>
  Armipotent paramour o' Venus.&mdash;<br>
  Red glows the charcoal. Bend to the task, my boys,<br>
  Time flies apace, and speedily night cometh,<br>
  When we no more may ply the anvil;<br>
  Fate cometh eke, i' the murky<br>
  midnight. Mark ye the pines, which rooted i' rocky ground,(17)<br>
  Brave Euroclydon's onset at evening.<br>
  Day dawns. The tree, which stood the tallest,<br>
  Preeminent i' the leafy greenwood,<br>
  Now lies the lowest. Safely the arbutus,<br>
  Which bent before him, flourishes, and the sun<br>
  Wakens the thrush, which slept securely<br>
  Nestled in its emerald asylum.<br>
  So, when the war-shout peals i' the noon o' night,<br>
  Rousing the sleepers fearful, in ecstacy<br>
  When slaves avenge their wrongs, arising<br>
  Strong i' the name o' liberty new born,<br>
  When fury spares not beauty nor innocence,<br>
  First flame the grandest domes. I' the massacre,<br>
  First fall the noblest. Lowly virtue<br>
  Haply the shade o' poverty defends.<br>
  Forge then the broad sword. Quickly the night cometh,<br>
  When red the streets with gore o' the mightiest<br>
  Shall fiercely flow, like Tiber in flood.<br>
  Rise then, avenger, the time it hath come!<br>
  Wake bloody tyrants from merry banquetting,<br>
  From downy couches, snowy-bosomed women<br>
  And ruby wine-cups, wake&mdash;The avenger<br>
  Springs to his arms, for the time it hath come!</p>

  <p class="footnote">17. The classical reader will perhaps object to the
  introduction of the Alcaic measure at this date, 62 B. C., it being generally
  believed that the Greek measures were first adapted to the Latin tongue by
  Horace, a few years later. The desire of giving a faint idea of the rhythm
  and style of Latin song, will, it is hoped, plead in mitigation of this very
  slight deviation from historical truth&mdash;the rather that, in spite of
  Horace's assertion, <i>Non ante vulgatas per artes Verba loquor sociata
  chordis,</i> it is not certain, that no imitations of the Greek measures
  existed prior to his success.</p><br>

  <p>The wild strain ceased, and with it the clang of the hammers, the bars of
  steel being already beaten into the form of those short massive two-edged
  blades, which were the Roman's national and all victorious weapon. But, as it
  ceased, a deep stern hum of approbation followed, elicited probably by some
  real or fancied similitude between the imagery of the song, and the
  circumstances of the auditors, who were to a man of the lowest order of
  plebeians, taught from their cradles to regard the nobles, and perhaps with
  too much cause, as their natural enemies and oppressors. When the brief
  applause was at an end, one of the elder bystanders addressed the principal
  workman, at the forge, in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"You are incautious, Caius Crispus, to sing such songs as this, and at
  such a time, too."</p>

  <p>"Tush, Bassus," answered the other, "it is you who are too timid. What
  harm is there, I should like to know, in singing an old Greek song done into
  Latin words? I like the rumbling measure, for my part; it suits well with the
  clash and clang of our rude trade. For the song, there is no offence in it;
  and, for the time, it is a very good time; and, to poor men like us, a better
  time is coming!"</p>

  <p>"Oh! well said. May it be so!" exclaimed several voices in reply to the
  stout smith's sharp words.</p>

  <p>But the old man was not so easily satisfied, for he answered at once. "If
  any of the nobles heard it, they would soon find offence in it, my
  Caius!"</p>

  <p>"Oh! the nobles&mdash;the nobles, and the Fathers! I am tired of hearing
  of the nobles. For my part, I do not see what makes them noble. Are they a
  whit stronger, or braver, or better man than I, or Marcus here, or any of us?
  I trow not."</p>

  <p>"Wiser&mdash;they are at least wiser, Caius," said the old man once more,
  "in this, if in nothing else, that they keep their own councils, and stand by
  their own order."</p>

  <p>"Aye! in oppressing the poor!" replied a new speaker.</p>

  <p>"Right, Marcus," said a second; "let them wrangle as much as they may with
  one another, for their dice, their women, or their wine; in this at least
  they all agree, in trampling down the poor."</p>

  <p>"There is a good time coming," replied the smith; "and it is very near at
  hand. Now, Niger," he continued, addressing one of his workmen, "carry these
  blades down to the lower workshop; let Rufus fit them instantly with horn
  handles; and then, see you to their grinding! Never heed polishing them very
  much, but give them right keen edges, and good stabbing points."</p>

  <p>"I do not know," answered the other man to the first part of the smith's
  speech. "I am not so sure of that."</p>

  <p>"You don't know what I mean," said Crispus, scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I do&mdash;right well. But I am not so confident, as you are, in
  these new leaders."</p>

  <p>The smith looked at him keenly for a moment, and then said significantly,
  "<i>do</i> you know?"</p>

  <p>"Aye! do I," said the other; and, a moment afterward, when the eyes of the
  bystanders were not directly fixed on him, he drew his hand edgewise across
  his throat, with the action of one severing the windpipe.</p>

  <p>Caius Crispus nodded assent, but made a gesture of caution, glancing his
  eye toward one or two of the company, and whispering a moment afterward, "I
  am not sure of those fellows."</p>

  <p>"I see, I see; but they shall learn nothing from what I say." Then raising
  his voice, he added, "what I mean, Caius, is simply this, that I have no so
  very great faith in the promises of this Sergius Catiline, even if he should
  be elected. He was a sworn friend to Sylla, the people's worst enemy; and
  never had one associate of the old Marian party. Believe me, he only wants
  our aid to set himself up on the horse of state authority; and when he is
  firm in the saddle, he will ride us down under the hoofs of patrician
  tyranny, as hard as any Cato, or Pompey, of them all."</p>

  <p>Six or seven of the foremost group, immediately about the anvil when this
  discourse was going on, interchanged quick glances, as the man used the word
  elected, on which he laid a strong and singular emphasis, and nodded
  slightly, as indicating that they understood his more secret meaning. All,
  however, except Crispus, the owner of the forge, seemed to be moved by what
  he advanced; and the foreman of the anvil, after musing for a moment, as he
  leaned on his heavy sledge, said, "I believe you are right; no one but a
  Plebeian can truly mean well, or be truly fitted for a leader to
  Plebeians."</p>

  <p>"You are no wiser than Crispus," interposed the old man, who had spoken
  first, in a low angry whisper. "Do you want to discourage these fellows from
  rising to the cry, when it shall be set up? If this be all that you can do,
  it were as well to close the forge at once."</p>

  <p>"Which I shall do forthwith," said Caius Crispus; "for I have got through
  my work and my lads are weary; but do not you go away, my gossips; nor you
  either," he added, speaking to the man whom he had at first suspected, "tarry
  you, under one pretext or other; we will have a cup of wine, as soon as I
  have got rid of these fellows. Here, Aulus," turning to his foreman, "take
  some coin out of my purse, there it hangs by my clean tunic in the corner,
  and go round to the wine shop, and bring thence a skinful of the best Sabine
  vintage; and some of you bar up the door, all but the little wicket. And now,
  my friends, good night; it is very late, and I am going to shut up the shop.
  Good night; and remember that the only hope of us working men lies in the
  election of Catiline tomorrow. Be in the Campus early, with all your friends;
  and hark ye, you were best take your knives under your tunics, lest the proud
  nobles should attempt to drive us from the ballot."</p>

  <p>"We will, we will!" exclaimed several voices. "We will not be cozened out
  of our votes, or bullied out of them either. But how is this? do not you vote
  in your class?"</p>

  <p>"I vote <i>with</i> my class! with my fellow Plebeians and mechanics, I
  would say! What if I be one of the armorers of the first class, think you
  that I will vote with the proud senators and insolent knights? No, brethren,
  not one of us, nor of the carpenters either, nor of the trumpeters, or
  horn-blowers! Plebeians we are, and Plebeians we will vote! and let me tell
  you to look sharp to me, on the Campus; and whatever I do, so do ye. Be sure
  that good will come of it to the people!"</p>

  <p>"We will, we will!" responded all his hearers, now unanimous. "Brave
  heart! stout Caius Crispus! We will have you a tribune one of these days! but
  good night, good night!"</p>

  <p>And, with the words, all left the forge, except the smith and his peculiar
  workmen, and two or three others, all clients of the Praetor Lentulus, and
  all in some degree associates in the conspiracy. None of them, however, were
  initiated fully, except Caius himself, his foreman, Aulus, the aged Bassus,
  and the stranger; who, though unknown to any one present, had given
  satisfactory evidence that he was privy to the most atrocious portions of the
  plot. The wine was introduced immediately, and after a deep draught,
  circulated more than once, the conversation was resumed by the initiated, who
  were now left alone.</p>

  <p>"And do you believe," said the stranger, addressing Caius Crispus, "that
  Catiline and his companions have any real view to the redress of grievances,
  the regeneration of the state, or the equalization of conditions?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least, I," answered the swordsmith. "Do you?"</p>

  <p>"I did once."</p>

  <p>"I never did."</p>

  <p>"Then, in the name of all the Gods, why did you join with them?"</p>

  <p>"Because by the ruin of the great and noble, the poor must be gainers.
  Because I owe what I can never pay. Because I lust for what I can never
  win&mdash;luxury, beauty, wealth, and power! And if there come a civil
  strife, with proscription, confiscation, massacre, it shall go hard with
  Caius Crispus, if he achieve not greatness!"</p>

  <p>"And you," said the man, turning short round, without replying to the
  smith, and addressing the aged Bassus, "why did you join the plotters, you
  who are so crafty, so sagacious, and yet so earnest in the cause?"</p>

  <p>"Because I have wrongs to avenge," answered the old man fiercely; a fiery
  flush crimsoning his sallow face, and his eye beaming lurid rage. "Wrongs, to
  repay which all the blood that flows in patrician veins were but too small a
  price!"</p>

  <p>"Ha?" said the other, in a tone half meditative and half questioning, but
  in truth thinking little of the speaker, and reflecting only on the personal
  nature of the motives, which seemed to instigate them all. "Ha, is it indeed
  so?"</p>

  <p>"Man," cried the old conspirator, springing forward and catching him by
  the arm. "Have you a wife, a child, a sister? If so, listen! you can
  understand me! I am, as you see old, very old! I have scars, also, all in
  front; honorable scars, of wounds inflicted by the Moorish assagays, of
  Jugurtha's desert horsemen&mdash;by the huge broad swords of the Teutones and
  Cimbri. My son, my only son fell, as an eagle-bearer, in the front rank of
  the hastati of the brave tenth legion&mdash;for we had wealth in those days,
  and both fought and voted in the centuries of the first class. But our fields
  were uncultivated, while we were shedding our best blood for the state; and
  to complete the ruin, my rural slaves broke loose, and joined Spartacus the
  gladiator. Taken, they died upon the cross; and I was quite undone. Law suits
  and usury ate up the rest; and, for these eight years past, old Bassus has
  been penniless, and often cold, and always hungry. But if this had been all,
  it is a soldier's part to bear cold and hunger&mdash;but not to bear
  disgrace. Man, there have been gyves on these legs&mdash;the whip has scarred
  these shoulders! Ye great Gods! the whip! for what have the poor to do with
  their Portian or Valerian laws? Nor was this all&mdash;the eagle-bearer left
  a child, a sweet, fair, gentle girl, the image of my gallant boy, the only
  solace of my famishing old age. I told you she was fair&mdash;fatally
  fair&mdash;too fair for a plebeian's daughter, a plebeian's wife! Her beauty
  caught the lustful eyes, inflamed the brutal heart of a patrician, one of the
  great Cornelii. It is enough! She was torn from my house, dishonored, and
  sent home, to die by her own hand, that would not pardon that involuntary
  sin! She died; the censors heard the tale; and scoffed at the teller of it!
  and that Cornelius yet sits in the senate; those censors who approved his
  guilt yet live&mdash;I say <i>live</i>! Is not that cause enough why I should
  join the plotters?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot answer, No!" replied the other; "and you, Aulus, what is your
  reason?"</p>

  <p>"I would win me a noble paramour. Hortensia's Julia is very soft and
  beautiful."</p>

  <p>The stranger looked at him steadily for a moment, and an expression of
  disgust and horror crept over his bold face. "Alas!" he said at length,
  speaking, it would seem, to himself rather than to the others, "poor Rome!
  unhappy country!"</p>

  <p>But, as he spoke, the strong smith, whose suspicion would seem to have
  been excited, stepped forward and laid his hand upon the stranger's shoulder.
  "Look you," he said, "master. None of us know you here, I think, and we
  should all of us be glad to know, both who you are, and, if indeed you be of
  the faction, wherefore <i>you</i> joined it, that you so closely scrutinize
  our motives."</p>

  <p>"Because I was a fool, Caius Crispus; because I believed that, for a great
  stake, Romans might yet forget <i>self</i>, base and sordid <i>self</i>, and
  act as becomes patriots and men! Because I dreamed, smith, till morning light
  came back, and I awakened, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And the dream!" asked the smith eagerly, grasping the handle of his heavy
  hammer firmly, and setting his teeth hard.</p>

  <p>"Had vanished," replied the other calmly, and looking him full in the
  eye.</p>

  <p>"Bar the door, Aulus," cried the smith, hastily. "This fellow must die
  here, or he will betray us," and he caught him by the throat, as he spoke,
  with an iron grip, to prevent him from calling out or giving the alarm.</p>

  <p>But the stranger, though not to be compared in bulk or muscular
  proportions with the gigantic artizan, shook off his grasp with contemptuous
  ease, and answered with a scornful smile,</p>

  <p>"Betray you!&mdash;tush, I am Fulvius Flaccus."</p>

  <p>Had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of the smith, he could not have
  recoiled with wilder wonder.</p>

  <p>"What, Fulvius Flaccus, to whose great wrongs all injuries endured by us
  are but as flea-bites! Fulvius, the grandson of that Fulvius Flaccus,
  who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Was murdered by Opimius, while striving for the liberties of Romans. But
  what is this! By Mars and Quirinus! there is something afoot without!"</p>

  <p>And, as he uttered the words, he sprang to the wicket, which Aulus had not
  fastened, and gazed out earnestly into the darkness, through which the
  regular and steady tramp of men, advancing in ordered files, could now be
  heard distinctly.</p>

  <p>The others were beside him in an instant, with terror and amazement on
  their faces.</p>

  <p>They had not long to wait, before the cause of their alarm became visible.
  It was a band of some five hundred stout young men of the upper classes, well
  armed with swords and the oblong bucklers of the legion, though wearing
  neither casque nor cuirass, led by a curule aedile, who was accompanied by
  ten or twelve of the equestrian order, completely armed, and preceded by his
  <i>apparitores</i> or beadles, and half a dozen torch-bearers.</p>

  <p>These men passed swiftly on, in treble file, marching as fast as they
  could down the Sacred Way, until they reached the intersection of the street
  of Apollo; by which they proceeded straight up the ascent of the Palatine,
  whereon they were soon lost to view, among the splendid edifices that covered
  its slope and summit.</p>

  <p>"By all the Gods!" cried Caius Crispus, "This is exceedingly strange! An
  armed guard at this time of night!"</p>

  <p>"Hist! here is something more."</p>

  <p>And, as old Bassus spoke, Antonius, the consul, who was supposed to be
  attached to the faction of Catiline, came down a bye-street, from the lower
  end of the Carinae, preceded by his torch-bearers, and followed by a
  lictor(18) with his fasces. He was in full dress too, as one of the presiding
  magistrates of the senate, and bore in his hand his ivory sceptre, surmounted
  by an eagle.</p>

  <p class="footnote">18. The senior consul, or he whose month it was to
  preside, had twelve lictors; the junior but one, while within the city.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had passed the door of the forge, Crispus stepped out into
  the street, motioning his guests to follow him, and desiring his foreman to
  lock the door.</p>

  <p>"Let us follow the Consul, at a distance," he exclaimed, "my Bassus; for,
  as our Fulvius says, there is assuredly something afoot; and it may be that
  it shall be well for us to know it: Come, let us follow quickly."</p>

  <p>They hurried onward, as he proposed; and keeping some twenty or thirty
  paces in the rear of the Consul's train, soon reached the foot of the street
  of Apollo. At this point, however, Antonius paused with his lictor; for, in
  the opposite direction coming up from the Cerolian place toward the Forum,
  another line of torches might be seen flaming through the darkness, and, even
  at that distance, the axe heads of the lictors were visible, as they flashed
  out by fits in the red torch-light.</p>

  <p>"By all the Gods!" whispered Bassus, "it is the other consul, the new man
  from Arpinum. Believe me, my friends, this bodes no good to us! The Senate
  must have been convoked suddenly&mdash;and lo! here come the fathers. Look,
  look! this is stern Cato."</p>

  <p>And, almost as he said the words, a powerfully made and very noble looking
  man passed so near as to brush the person of the mechanic with the folds of
  his toga. His face, which was strongly marked, was stern certainly; but it
  was with the sternness of gravity and deep thought, coupled perhaps with
  something of melancholy&mdash;for it might be that he despaired at times of
  man's condition in this world, and of his prospects in the next&mdash;not of
  austerity or pride. His garb was plain in the extreme, and, although his
  tunic displayed the broad crimson facings, and his robe the passmenting of
  senatorial rank, both were of the commonest materials, and the narrowest and
  most simple cut.</p>

  <p>"Hail, noble Cato!" said the mechanic, as the senator passed by; but his
  voice faltered as he spoke, and there was something hollow and heartless in
  the tones, which conveyed the greeting.</p>

  <p>Cato raised his eyes, which had been fixed on the ground in meditation,
  and perused the features of the speaker with a severe and scrutinizing gaze;
  and then, shaking his head sternly, as if dissatisfied with the result of his
  observation, "This is no time of night, sirrah smith," he said, "for thee, or
  such as thou, to be abroad. Thy daily work done, thou shouldst be at home
  with thy wife and children, not seeking profligate adventures, or breeding
  foul sedition in the streets. Go home! go home! for shame on thee! thou art
  known and marked."</p>

  <p>And the severe and virtuous noble strode onward, unattended he by any
  torch-bearer, or freedman, and soon joined his worthy friend, the great Latin
  orator, who had come up, and having united his train to that of the other
  consul, was moving up the Palatine.</p>

  <p>In the meantime senator after senator arrived, some alone, with their
  slaves or freedmen lighting them along the streets; others in groups of two
  or three, all hurrying toward the Palatine. The smith and his friends, who
  had been at first the sole spectators of the shew, were now every moment
  joined by more and more of the rabble, until a great concourse was assembled;
  through which the nobles had some difficulty in forcing their way toward the
  Temple of Apollo, in which their order was assembling, wherefore as yet they
  knew not.</p>

  <p>At first the crowd was orderly enough, and quiet; but gradually beginning
  to ferment and grow warm, as it were by the closeness of its packing, cheers
  were heard, and loud acclamations, as any member of the popular faction made
  his way through it; and groans and yells and even curses succeeded, as any of
  the leaders of the aristocratic party strove to part its reluctant
  masses.</p>

  <p>And now a louder burst of acclamations, than any which had yet been heard,
  rang through the streets, causing the very roofs to tremble.</p>

  <p>"What foolery have we here?" said the smith very sullenly, who, though he
  responded nothing to it, had by no means recovered from the rebuke of Cato.
  "Oh! yes! I see, I see," and he too added the power of his stentorian lungs
  to the clamor, as a young senator, splendidly dressed, and of an aspect that
  could not fail to attract attention, entered the little space, which had been
  kept open at the corner of the two streets, by the efforts of an aedile and
  his beadles, who had just arrived on the ground.</p>

  <p>He was not much, if at all, above the middle size, but admirably
  proportioned, whether for feats of agility and strength, or for the lighter
  graces of society. But it was his face more especially, and the magnificent
  expression of his features, that first struck the beholder&mdash;the broad
  imaginative brow, the keen large lustrous eye, pervading, clear, undazzled as
  the eagle's, the bold Roman nose, the resolute curve of the clean-cut mouth,
  full of indomitable pride and matchless energy&mdash;all these bespoke at
  once the versatile and various genius of the great statesman, orator, and
  captain, who was to be thereafter.</p>

  <p>At this time, however, although he was advancing toward middle age, and
  had already shaken off some of the trammels which luxurious vice and heedless
  extravagance had cast around his young puissant intellect, he had achieved
  nothing either of fame or power. He had, it is true, given signs of rare
  intellect, but as yet they were signs only. Though his friends looked forward
  confidently to the time, when they should see him the first citizen of the
  republic; and it is more than possible, that in his own heart he contemplated
  even now the attainment of a more glorious, if more perilous elevation.</p>

  <p>The locks of this noble looking personage, though not arranged in that
  effeminate fashion, which has been mentioned as characteristic of Cethegus
  and some others, were closely curled about his brow&mdash;for he, as yet,
  exhibited no tendency to that baldness, for which in after years he was
  remarkable&mdash;and reeked with the choicest perfumes. He wore the
  crimson-bordered toga of his senatorial rank, but under it, as it waved
  loosely to and fro, might be observed the gaudy hues of a violet colored
  banqueting dress, sprinkled with flowers of gold, as if he had been disturbed
  from some festive board by the summons to council.</p>

  <p>As he passed through the crowd, from which loud rose the shout, following
  him as he moved along&mdash;"Hail, Caius Caesar! long live the noble
  Caesar!"&mdash;his slaves scattered gold profusely among the multitude, who
  fought and scrambled for the glittering coin, still keeping up their
  clamorous greeting; while the dispenser of the wasteful largesse appearing to
  know every one, and to forget no face or name, even of the humblest, had a
  familiar smile and a cheery word for each citizen.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Bassus, my old hero!" he exclaimed, "it is long since thou hast been
  to visit me. That proves, I hope, that things go better now-a-days at home.
  But come and see me, Bassus; I have something for thee to keep the cold from
  thy hearth, this freezing weather."</p>

  <p>And he paused not to receive an answer, but moved forward a step or two,
  till his eye fell upon the swordsmith.</p>

  <p>"What, Caius," he said, "sturdy Caius, absent from his forge so
  early&mdash;but I forgot, I forgot! you are a politician, perhaps you can
  tell me why they have roused me from the best cup of Massic I have tasted
  this ten years. What is the coil, Caius Crispus?"</p>

  <p>"Nay! I know not," replied the mechanic, "I was about to ask the same of
  you, noble Caesar!"</p>

  <p>"I am the worst man living of whom to inquire," replied the patrician,
  with a careless smile. "I cannot even guess, unless perchance"&mdash;but as
  he spoke, he discovered, standing beside the smith, the man who had called
  himself Fulvius Flaccus, and interrupting himself instantly, he fixed a long
  and piercing gaze upon him, and then exclaimed "Ha! is it thou?" with an
  expression of astonishment, not all unmixed with vexation.</p>

  <p>The next moment he stepped close up to him, whispered a word into his ear,
  and hurried with an altered air up the steep street which scaled the
  Palatine.</p>

  <p>A minute or two afterward, Crispus turned to address this man, but he too
  was gone.</p>

  <p>In quick succession senator after senator now came up the gentle slope of
  the Sacred Way, until almost all the distinguished men in Rome, whether for
  good or for evil, had undergone the scrutiny of the group collected around
  Caius Crispus.</p>

  <p>But it was not till among the last that Catiline strode by, gnawing his
  nether lip uneasily, with his wild sunken eyes glaring suspiciously about
  him. He spoke to no one, until he came opposite the smith, on whom he frowned
  darkly, exclaiming, "What do you here? Go home, sirrah, go home!" and as
  Caius dropped his bold eyes, crest-fallen and abashed, he added in a lower
  tone, so that, save Bassus only, none of the crowd could hear him, "Wait for
  me at my house. Evil is brewing!"</p>

  <p>Not a word more was spoken. Crispus and the old man soon extricated
  themselves from the throng and went their way; and in a little time afterward
  the multitude was dispersed, rather summarily, by a band of armed men under
  the Praetor Pomptinus, who cleared with very little delicacy the confines of
  the Palatine, whereon it was announced that the senate were now in secret
  session.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch113"
     name="ch113"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE DISCLOSURE</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>Maria montesque polliceri caepit,<br>
  Minari interdum ferro, nisi obnoxia foret.</i> &mdash; Sallust.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>A woman, master.</i> &mdash;Love's Labour Lost.</p><br>

  <p class="first">AMONG all those of Senatorial rank&mdash;and they were very
  many&mdash;who were participants of the intended treason, one alone was
  absent from the assemblage of the Order on that eventful night.</p>

  <p>The keen unquiet eye of the arch-traitor missed Curius from his place, as
  it ran over the known faces of the conspirators, on whom he reckoned for
  support.</p>

  <p>Curius was absent.</p>

  <p>Nor did his absence, although it might well be, although indeed it
  <i>was</i>, accidental, diminish anything of Catiline's anxiety. For, though
  he fully believed him trusty and faithful to the end, though he felt that the
  man was linked to him indissolubly by the consciousness of common crimes, he
  knew him also to be no less vain than he was daring. And, while he had no
  fear of intentional betrayal, he apprehended the possibility of involuntary
  disclosures, that might be perilous, if not fatal, in the present
  juncture.</p>

  <p>It has been left on record of this Curius, by one who knew him well, and
  was himself no mean judge of character, that he possessed not the faculty of
  concealing any thing he had heard, or even of dissembling his own crimes; and
  Catiline was not one to overlook or mistake so palpable a weakness.</p>

  <p>But the truth was, that knowing his man thoroughly, he was aware that,
  with the bane, he bore about with him, in some degree, its antidote. For so
  vast and absurd were his vain boastings, and so needless his exaggerations of
  his own recklessness, blood-thirstiness, and crime, that hitherto his
  vaporings had excited rather ridicule than fear.</p>

  <p>The time was however coming, when they were to awaken distrust, and lead
  to disclosure.</p>

  <p>It was perfectly consistent with the audacity of Catiline&mdash;an
  audacity, which, though natural, stood him well in stead, as a mask to cover
  deep designs&mdash;that even now, when he felt himself to be more than
  suspected, instead of avoiding notoriety, and shunning the companionship of
  his fellow traitors, he seemed to covet observation, and to display himself
  in connection with his guilty partners, more openly than heretofore.</p>

  <p>But neither Lentulus, nor Vargunteius, nor the Syllae, nor any other of
  the plotters had seen Curius, or could inform him of his whereabout. And, ere
  they separated for the night, amid the crash of the contending elements
  above, and the roar of the turbulent populace below, doubt, and almost
  dismay, had sunk into the hearts of several the most daring, so far as mere
  mortal perils were to be encountered, but the most abject, when superstition
  was joined with conscious guilt to appal and confound them.</p>

  <p>Catiline left the others, and strode away homeward, more agitated and
  unquiet than his face or words, or anything in his demeanor, except his
  irregular pace, and fitful gestures indicated.</p>

  <p>Dark curses quivered unspoken on his tongue&mdash;the pains of hell were
  in his heart already.</p>

  <p>Had he but known the whole, how would his fury have blazed out into
  instant action.</p>

  <p>At the very moment when the Senate was so suddenly convoked on the
  Palatine, a woman of rare loveliness waited alone, in a rich and voluptuous
  chamber of a house not far removed from the scene of those grave
  deliberations.</p>

  <p>The chamber, in which she reclined alone on a pile of soft cushions, might
  well have been the shrine of that bland queen of love and pleasure, of whom
  its fair tenant was indeed an assiduous votaress. For there was nothing,
  which could charm the senses, or lap the soul in luxurious and effeminate
  ease, that was not there displayed.</p>

  <p>The walls glowed with the choicest specimens of the Italian pencil, and
  the soft tones and harmonious colouring were well adapted to the subjects,
  which were the same in all&mdash;voluptuous and sensual love.</p>

  <p>Here Venus rose from the crisp-smiling waves, in a rich atmosphere of
  light and beauty&mdash;there Leda toyed with the wreathed neck and ruffled
  plumage of the enamoured swan&mdash;in this compartment, Dana lay warm and
  languid, impotent to resist the blended power of the God's passion and his
  gold&mdash;in that, Ariadne clung delighted to the bosom of the rosy
  wine-God.</p>

  <p>The very atmosphere of the apartment was redolent of the richest perfumes,
  which streamed from four censers of chased gold placed on a tall candelabra
  of wrought bronze in the corners of the room. A bowl of stained glass on the
  table was filled with musk roses, the latest of the year; and several
  hyacinths in full bloom added their almost overpowering scent to the aromatic
  odours of the burning incense.</p>

  <p>Armed chairs, with downy pillows, covered with choice embroidered cloths
  of Calabria, soft ottomans and easy couches, tables loaded with implements of
  female luxury, musical instruments, drawings, and splendidly illuminated
  rolls of the amatory bards and poetesses of the Egean islands, completed the
  picture of the boudoir of the Roman beauty.</p>

  <p>And on a couch piled with the Tyrian cushions, which yielded to the soft
  impress of her lovely form, well worthy of the splendid luxury with which she
  was surrounded, lay the unrivalled Fulvia, awaiting her expected lover.</p>

  <p>If she was lovely in her rich attire, as she appeared at the board of
  Catiline, with jewels in her bosom, and her bright ringlets of luxuriant gold
  braided in fair array, far lovelier was she now, as she lay there reclined,
  with those bright ringlets all dishevelled, and falling in a flood of wavy
  silken masses, over her snowy shoulders, and palpitating bosom; with all the
  undulating outlines of her superb form, unadorned, and but scantily concealed
  by a loose robe of snow-white linen.</p>

  <p>Her face was slightly flushed with a soft carnation tinge, her blue eyes
  gleamed with unusual brightness. And by the fluttering of her bosom, and the
  nervous quivering of her slender fingers, as they leaned on a tripod of
  Parian marble which stood beside the couch, it was evident that she was
  labouring under some violent excitement.</p>

  <p>"He comes not," she said. "And it is waxing late. He has again failed me!
  and if he have&mdash;ruin&mdash;ruin!&mdash;Debts pressing me in every
  quarter, and no hope but from him. Alfenus the usurer will lend no
  more&mdash;my farms all mortgaged to the utmost, a hundred thousand sesterces
  of interest, due these last Calends, and unpaid as yet. What can I
  do?&mdash;what hope for? In him there is no help&mdash;none! Nay! It is vain
  to think of it; for he is amorous as ever, and, could he raise the money,
  would lavish millions on me for one kiss. No! <i>he</i> is bankrupt too; and
  all his promises are but wild empty boastings. What, then, is left to me?"
  she cried aloud, in the intensity of her perturbation. "Most miserable me! My
  creditors will seize on all&mdash;all&mdash;all! and poverty&mdash;hard,
  chilling, bitter poverty, is staring in my face even now. Ye Gods! ye Gods!
  And I can not&mdash;can not live poor. No more rich dainties, and rare wines!
  no downy couches and soft perfumes! No music to induce voluptuous slumbers!
  no fairy-fingered slaves to fan the languid brow into luxurious coolness! No
  revelry, no mirth, no pleasure! Pleasure that is so sweet, so enthralling!
  Pleasure for which I have lived only, without which I must die! <i>Die</i>!
  By the great Gods! I <i>will</i> die! What avails life, when all its joys are
  gone? Or what is death, but one momentary pang, and then&mdash;quiet? Yes! I
  will die. And the world shall learn that the soft Epicurean can vie with the
  cold Stoic in carelessness of living, and contempt of death&mdash;that the
  warm votaress of Aphrodite can spend her glowing life-blood as prodigally as
  the stern follower of Virtue! Lucretia died, and was counted great and noble,
  because she cared not to survive her honour! Fulvia will perish, wiser, as
  soon as she shall have outlived her capacity for pleasure!"</p>

  <p>She spoke enthusiastically, her bright eyes flashing a strange fire, and
  her white bosom panting with the strong and passionate excitement; but in a
  moment her mood was changed. A smile, as if at her own vehemence, curled her
  lip; her glance lost its quick, sharp wildness. She clapped her hands
  together, and called aloud,</p>

  <p>"Ho! AEgle! AEgle!"</p>

  <p>And at the call a beautiful Greek girl entered the chamber, voluptuous as
  her mistress in carriage and demeanor, and all too slightly robed for
  modesty, in garments that displayed far more than they concealed of her rare
  symmetry.</p>

  <p>"Bring wine, my girl," cried Fulvia; "the richest Massic; and, hark thee,
  fetch thy lyre. My soul is dark to-night, and craves a joyous note to kindle
  it to life and rapture."</p>

  <p>The girl bowed and retired; but in a minute or two returned, accompanied
  by a dark-eyed Ionian, bearing a Tuscan flask of the choice wine, and a
  goblet of crystal, embossed with emeralds and sapphires, imbedded, by a
  process known to the ancients but now lost, in the transparent glass.</p>

  <p>A lyre of tortoiseshell was in the hands of AEgle, and a golden plectrum
  with which to strike its chords; she had cast loose her abundant tresses of
  dark hair, and decked her brows with a coronal of myrtle mixed with roses,
  and as she came bounding with sinuous and graceful gestures through the door,
  waving her white arms with the dazzling instruments aloft, she might have
  represented well a young priestess of the Cyprian queen, or the light Muse of
  amorous song.</p>

  <p>The other girl filled out a goblet of the amber-coloured wine, the
  fragrance of which overpowered, for a moment, as it mantled on the goblet's
  brim, the aromatic perfumes which loaded the atmosphere of the apartment.</p>

  <p>And Fulvia raised it to her lips, and sipped it slowly, and delightedly,
  suffering it to glide drop by drop between her rosy lips, to linger on her
  pleased palate, luxuriating in its soft richness, and dwelling long and
  rapturously on its flavour.</p>

  <p>After a little while, the goblet was exhausted, a warmer hue came into her
  velvet cheeks, a brighter spark danced in her azure eyes, and as she motioned
  the Ionian slave-girl to replenish the cup and place it on the tripod at her
  elbow, she murmured in a low languid tone,</p>

  <p>"Sing to me, now&mdash;sing to me, AEgle."</p>

  <p>And in obedience to her word the lovely girl bent her fair form over the
  lute, and, after a wild prelude full of strange thrilling melodies, poured
  out a voice as liquid and as clear, aye! and as soft, withal, as the
  nightingale's, in a soft Sapphic love-strain full of the glorious poetry of
  her own lovely language.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Where in umbrageous shadow of the greenwood<br>
  Buds the gay primrose i' the balmy spring time;<br>
  Where never silent, Philomel, the wildest<br>
  Minstrel of ether,</p>

  <p class="verse">Pours her high notes, and caroling, delighted<br>
  In the cool sun-proof canopy of the ilex<br>
  Hung with ivy green or a bloomy dog-rose<br>
  Idly redundant,</p>

  <p class="verse">Charms the fierce noon with melody; in the moonbeam<br>
  Where the coy Dryads trip it unmolested<br>
  All the night long, to merry dithyrambics<br>
  Blissfully timing</p>

  <p class="verse">Their rapid steps, which flit across the knot grass<br>
  Lightly, nor shake one flower of the blue-bell;<br>
  Where liquid founts and rivulets o' silver<br>
  Sweetly awaken</p>

  <p class="verse">Clear forest echoes with unearthly laughter;<br>
  There will I, dearest, on a bank be lying<br>
  Where the wild thyme blows ever, and the pine tree<br>
  Fitfully murmurs</p>

  <p class="verse">Slumber inspiring. Come to me, my dearest,<br>
  On the fresh greensward, as a downy bride-bed,<br>
  Languid, unzoned, and amorous, reclining;<br>
  Like Ariadne,</p>

  <p class="verse">When the blythe wine-God, from Olympus hoary,<br>
  Wooed the soft mortal tremulously yielding<br>
  All her enchantments to the mighty victor&mdash;<br>
  Happy Ariadne!</p>

  <p class="verse">There will I, dearest, every frown abandon;<br>
  Nor do thou fear, nor hesitate to press me,<br>
  Since, if I chide, 'tis but a girl's reproval,<br>
  Faintly reluctant.</p>

  <p class="verse">Doubt not I love thee, whether I return thy<br>
  Kisses in delight, or avert demurely<br>
  Lips that in truth burn to be kissed the closer,<br>
  Eyes that avoid thee,</p>

  <p class="verse">Loth to confess how amorously glowing<br>
  Pants the fond heart. Oh! tarry not, but urge me<br>
  Coy to consent; and if a blush alarm thee,<br>
  Shyly revealing</p>

  <p class="verse">Sentiments deep as the profound of Ocean,<br>
  If a sigh, faltered in an hour of anguish,<br>
  Seem to implore thee&mdash;pity not. The maiden<br>
  Often adores thee</p>

  <p class="verse">Most if offending. Never, oh! believe me,<br>
  Did the faint-hearted win a girl's devotion,<br>
  Nor the true girl frown when a youth disarmed her<br>
  Dainty denial.</p><br>

  <p>While she was yet singing, the curtains which covered the door were put
  quietly aside, and with a noiseless step Curius entered the apartment, unseen
  by the fair vocalist, whose back was turned to him, and made a sign to Fulvia
  that she should not appear to notice his arrival.</p>

  <p>The haggard and uneasy aspect, which was peculiar to this man&mdash;the
  care-worn expression, half-anxious and half-jaded, which has been previously
  described, was less conspicuous on this occasion than ever it had been
  before, since the light lady loved him. There was a feverish flush on his
  face, a joyous gleam in his dark eye, and a self-satisfied smile lighting up
  all his features, which led her to believe at first that he had been drinking
  deeply; and secondly, that by some means or other he had succeeded in
  collecting the vast sum she had required of him, as the unworthy price of
  future favours.</p>

  <p>In a minute or two, the voluptuous strain ended; and, ere she knew that
  any stranger listened to her amatory warblings, the arm of Curius was wound
  about her slender waist, and his half-laughing voice was ringing in her
  ear,</p>

  <p>"Well sung, my lovely Greek, and daintily advised!&mdash;By my faith!
  sweet one, I will take thee at thy word!"</p>

  <p>"No! no!" cried the girl, extricating herself from his arms, by an elastic
  spring, before his lips could touch her cheek. "No! no! you shall not kiss
  me. Kiss Fulvia, she is handsomer than I am, and loves you too. Come, Myrrha,
  let us leave them."</p>

  <p>And, with an arch smile and coquettish toss of her pretty head, she darted
  through the door, and was followed instantly by the other slave-girl, well
  trained to divine the wishes of her mistress.</p>

  <p>"<i>AEgle</i> is right, by Venus!" exclaimed Curius, drawing nearer to his
  mistress; "you are more beautiful to-night than <i>ever</i>."</p>

  <p>"Flatterer!" murmured the lady, suffering him to enfold her in his arms,
  and taste her lips for a moment. But the next minute she withdrew herself
  from his embrace, and said, half-smiling, half-abashed, "But flattery will
  not pay my debts. Have you brought me the moneys for Alfenus, my sweet
  Curius? the hundred thousand sesterces, you promised me?"</p>

  <p>"Perish the dross!" cried Curius, fiercely. "Out on it! when I come to
  you, burning with love and passion, you cast cold water on the flames, by
  your incessant cry for gold. By all the Gods! I do believe, that you love me
  only for that you can wring from my purse."</p>

  <p>"If it be so," replied the lady, scornfully, "I surely do not love you
  much; seeing it is three months, since you have brought me so much as a ring,
  or a jewel for a keepsake! But you should rather speak the truth out plainly,
  Curius," she continued, in an altered tone, "and confess honestly that you
  care for me no longer. If you loved me as once you did, you would not leave
  me to be goaded by these harpies. Know you not&mdash;why do I ask? you
  <i>do</i> know that my house, my slaves, nay! that my very jewels and my
  garments, are mine but upon sufferance. It wants but a few days of the
  calends of November, and if they find the interest unpaid, I shall be cast
  forth, shamed, and helpless, into the streets of Rome!"</p>

  <p>"Be it so!" answered Curius, with an expression which she could not
  comprehend. "Be it so! Fulvia; and if it be, you shall have any house in Rome
  you will, for your abode. What say you to Cicero's, in the Carinae? or the
  grand portico of Quintus Catulus, rich with the Cimbric spoils? or, better
  yet, that of Crassus, with its Hymettian columns, on the Palatine? Aye! aye!
  the speech of Marcus Brutus was prophetic; who termed it, the other day, the
  house of <i>Venus</i> on the Palatine! And you, my love, shall be the goddess
  of that shrine! It shall be yours <i>to-morrow</i>, if you will&mdash;so you
  will drive away the clouds from that sweet brow, and let those eyes beam
  forth&mdash;by all the Gods!"&mdash;he interrupted himself&mdash;"I
  <i>will</i> kiss thee!"</p>

  <p>"By all the Gods! thou shalt not&mdash;now, nor for evermore!" she
  replied, in her turn growing very angry.&mdash;"Thou foolish and mendacious
  boaster! what? dost thou deem me mad or senseless, to assail me with such
  drivelling folly? Begone, fool! or I will call my slaves&mdash;I <i>have</i>
  slaves yet, and, if it be the last deed of service they do for me, they shall
  spurn thee, like a dog, from my doors.&mdash;Art thou insane, or only
  drunken, Curius?" she added, breaking off from her impetuous railing, into a
  cool sarcastic tone, that stung him to the quick.</p>

  <p>"You shall see whether of the two, Harlot!" he replied furiously,
  thrusting his hand into the bosom of his tunic, as if to seek a weapon.</p>

  <p>"Harlot!" she exclaimed, springing to her feet, the hot blood rushing to
  her brow in torrents&mdash;"dare you say this to me?"</p>

  <p>"Dare! do you call this daring?" answered the savage. "This? what would
  you call it, then, to devastate the streets of Rome with flame and
  falchion&mdash;to hurl the fabric of the state headlong down from the blazing
  Capitol&mdash;to riot in the gore of senators, patricians,
  consulars!&mdash;What, to aspire to be the lords and emperors of the
  universe?"</p>

  <p>"What mean you?" she exclaimed, moved greatly by his vehemence, and
  beginning to suspect that this was something more than his mere ordinary
  boasting and exaggeration. "What can you mean? oh! tell me; if you do love
  me, as you once did, tell me, Curius!" and with rare artifice she altered her
  whole manner in an instant, all the expression of eye, lip, tone and accent,
  from the excess of scorn and hatred, to blandishment and fawning
  softness.</p>

  <p>"No!" he replied sullenly. "I will not tell you&mdash;no! You doubt me,
  distrust me, scorn me&mdash;no! I will tell you nothing! I will have all I
  wish or ask for, on my own terms&mdash;you shall grant all, or die!"</p>

  <p>And he unsheathed his dagger, as he spoke, and grasping her wrist
  violently with his left hand, offered the weapon at her throat with his
  right&mdash;"You shall grant all, or die!"</p>

  <p>"Never!"&mdash;she answered&mdash;"never!" looking him steadily yet softly
  in the face, with her beautiful blue eyes. "To fear I will never yield,
  whatever I may do, to love or passion. Strike, if you will&mdash;strike a
  weak woman, and so prove your daring&mdash;it will be easier, if not so
  noble, as slaying senators and consuls!"</p>

  <p>"Perdition!" cried the fierce conspirator, "I <i>will</i> kill her!" And
  with the word he raised his arm, as if to strike; and, for a moment, the
  guilty and abandoned sensualist believed that her hour was come.</p>

  <p>Yet she shrunk not, nor quailed before his angry eye, nor uttered any cry
  or supplication. She would have died that moment, as carelessly as she had
  lived. She would have died, acting out her character to the last sand of
  life, with the smile on her lip, and the soft languor in her melting eye, in
  all things an Epicurean.</p>

  <p>But the fierce mood of Curius changed. Irresolute, and impotent of evil,
  in a scarce less degree than he was sanguinary, rash, unprincipled, and
  fearless, it is not one of the least strange events, connected with a
  conspiracy the whole of which is strange, and much almost inexplicable, that
  a man so wise, so sagacious, so deep-sighted, as the arch traitor, should
  have placed confidence in one so fickle and infirm of purpose.</p>

  <p>His knitted brow relaxed, the hardness of his eye relented, he cast the
  dagger from him.</p>

  <p>The next moment, suffering the scarf to fall from her white and dazzling
  shoulders, the beautiful but bad enchantress flung herself upon his bosom, in
  the abandonment of her dishevelled beauty, winding her snowy arms about his
  neck, smothering his voice with kisses.</p>

  <p>A moment more, and she was seated on his knee, with his left arm about her
  waist, drinking with eager and attentive ears, that suffered not a single
  detail to escape them, the fullest revelation of that atrocious plot, the
  days, the very hours of action, the numbers, names, and rank of the
  conspirators!</p>

  <p>A woman's infamy rewarded the base villain's double treason! A woman's
  infamy saved Rome!</p>

  <p>Two hours later, the crash and roar of the hurricane and earthquake cut
  short their guilty pleasures. Curius rushed into the streets headlong, almost
  deeming that the insurrection might have exploded prematurely, and found
  it&mdash;more than half frustrated.</p>

  <p>Fulvia, while yet the thunder rolled, and the blue lightning flashed above
  her head, and the earth reeled beneath her footsteps, went forth, strong in
  the resolution of that Roman patriotism, which, nursed by the institutions of
  the age, and the pride of the haughty heart, stood with her, as it did with
  so many others, in lieu of any other principle, of any other virtue.</p>

  <p>Closely veiled, unattended even by a single slave, that delicate luxurious
  sinner braved the wild fury of the elements; braved the tumultuous frenzy,
  and more tumultuous terror, of the disorganised and angry populace; braved
  the dark superstition, which crept upon her as she marked the awful portents
  of that night, and half persuaded her to the belief that there were Powers on
  high, who heeded the ways, punished the crimes of mortals.</p>

  <p>And that strange sense grew on her more and more, though she resisted it,
  incredulous, when after a little while she sat side by side with the wise and
  virtuous Consul, and marked the calmness, almost divine, of his thoughtful
  benignant features, as he heard the full details of the awful crisis,
  heretofore but suspected, in which he stood, as if upon the verge of a scarce
  slumbering volcano.</p>

  <p>What passed between that frail woman, and the wise orator, none ever fully
  knew. But they parted&mdash;on his side with words of encouragement and
  kindness&mdash;on her's with a sense of veneration approaching almost to
  religious awe.</p>

  <p>And the next day, the usurer Alfenus received in full the debt, both
  principal and interest, which he had long despaired of touching.</p>

  <p>But when the Great Man stood alone in his silent study, that strange and
  unexpected interview concluded, he turned his eyes upward, not looking, even
  once, toward the sublime bust of Jupiter which stood before him, serene in
  more than mortal grandeur; extended both his arms, and prayed in solemn
  accents&mdash;</p>

  <p>"All thanks to thee, Omnipotent, Ubiquitous, Eternal, ONE! whom we, vain
  fools of fancy, adore in many forms, and under many names; invest with the
  low attributes of our own earthy nature; enshrine in mortal shapes, and human
  habitations! But thou, who wert, before the round world was, or the blue
  heaven o'erhung it; who wilt be, when those shall be no longer,&mdash;thou
  pardonest our madness, guidest our blindness, guardest our weakness. Thou, by
  the basest and most loathed instruments, dost work out thy great ends. All
  thanks, then, be to thee, by whatsoever name thou wouldest be addressed; to
  thee, whose dwelling is illimitable space, whose essence is in every thing
  that we behold, that moves, that is&mdash;to thee whom I hail, GOD! For thou
  hast given it to me to save my country. And whether I die now, by this
  assassin's knife, or live a little longer to behold the safety I establish, I
  have lived long enough, and am content to die!&mdash;Whether this death be,
  as philosophers have told us, a dreamless, senseless, and interminable
  trance; or, as I sometimes dream, a brief and passing slumber, from which we
  shall awaken into a purer, brighter, happier being&mdash;I have lived long
  enough! and when thou callest me, will answer to thy summons, glad and
  grateful! For Rome, at least, survives me, and shall perchance survive, 'till
  time itself is ended, the Queen of Universal Empire!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch114"
     name="ch114"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE WARNINGS</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>These late eclipses in the sun and moon
     portend no good to us.</i> &mdash;King Lear.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE morning of the eighteenth of October, the day so eagerly
  looked forward to by the conspirators, and so much dreaded by the good
  citizens of the republic, had arrived. And now was seen, as it will
  oftentimes happen, that when great events, however carefully concealed, are
  on the point of coming to light, a sort of vague rumour, or indefinite
  anticipation, is found running through the whole mass of society&mdash;a
  rumour, traceable to no one source, possessing no authority, and deserving no
  credibility from its origin, or even its distinctness; yet in the main true
  and correct&mdash;an anticipation of I know not what terrible, unusual, and
  exaggerated issue, yet, after all, not very different from what is really
  about to happen.</p>

  <p>Thus it was at this period; and&mdash;though it is quite certain, that on
  the preceding evening, at the convocation of the senate, no person except
  Cicero and Paullus, unconnected with the conspiracy, knew anything at all of
  the intended massacre and conflagration; though no one of the plotters had
  yet broken faith with his fellows; and though none of the leaders dared avow
  their schemes openly, even to the discontented populace, with whom they felt
  no sympathy, and from whom they expected no cordial or general
  cooperation&mdash;it is equally certain that for many days, and even months
  past, there had been a feverish and excited state of the public mind; an
  agitation and restlessness of the operative classes; an indistinct and vague
  alarm of the noble and wealthy orders; which had increased gradually until it
  was now at its height.</p>

  <p>Among all these parties, this restlessness had taken the shape of
  anticipation, either dreadful or desirable, of some great change, of some
  strange novelty&mdash;though no one, either of the wishers or fearers, could
  explain what it was he wished or feared&mdash;to be developed at the consular
  comitia.</p>

  <p>And amid this confusion, most congenial to his bold and scornful spirit,
  Catiline stalked, like the arch magician, to and fro, amid the wild and
  fantastic shapes of terror which he has himself evoked, marking the hopes of
  this one, as indications of an unknown, yet sure friend; and revelling in the
  terrors of that, as certain evidences of an enemy too weak and powerless to
  be formidable to his projects.</p>

  <p>It is true, that a year before, previous to Cicero's elevation to the
  chief magistracy, and previous to the murder of Piso by his own adherents on
  his way to Spain, the designs of Catiline had been suspected dangerous; and,
  as such, had contributed to the election of his rival; his own faction
  succeeding only in carrying in Antonius, the second and least dreaded of
  their candidates.</p>

  <p>Him Cicero, by rare management and much self-sacrifice, had contrived to
  bring over to the cause of the commonwealth; although he had so far kept his
  faith with Catiline, as to disclose none, if indeed he knew any of his
  infamous designs.</p>

  <p>In consequence of this defeat, and this subsequent secession of one on
  whom they had, perhaps, prematurely reckoned, the conspirators, all but their
  indomitable and unwearied leader, had been for some time paralyzed. And this
  fact, joined to the extreme caution of their latter proceedings, had tended
  to throw a shade of doubt over the previous accusation, and to create a sense
  of carelessness and almost of disbelief in the minds of the majority, as to
  the real existence of any schemes at all against the commonwealth.</p>

  <p>Under all these circumstances, it cannot be doubted, for a moment, that
  had Catiline and his friends entertained any real desire of ameliorating the
  condition of the masses, of extending the privileges, or improving the
  condition, of the discontented and suffering plebeians, they could have
  overturned the ancient fabric of Rome's world-conquering oligarchy.</p>

  <p>But the truth is, they dreamed of nothing less, than of meddling at all
  with the condition of the people; on whom they looked merely as tools and
  instruments for the present, and sources of plunder and profit in the
  future.</p>

  <p>They could not trust the plebeians, because they knew that the plebeians,
  in their turn, could not trust them.</p>

  <p>The dreadful struggles of Marius, Cinna, and Sylla, had convinced those of
  all classes, who possessed any stake in the well being of the country; any
  estate or property, however humble, down even to the tools of daily labour,
  and the occupation of permanent stalls for daily traffic, that it was neither
  change, nor revolution, nor even larger liberty&mdash;much less proscription,
  civil strife, and fire-raising&mdash;but rest, but tranquillity, but peace,
  that they required.</p>

  <p>It was not to the people, therefore, properly so called, but to the
  dissolute and ruined outcasts of the aristocracy, and to the lowest rabble,
  the homeless, idle, vicious, drunken <i>poor</i>, who having nothing to love,
  have necessarily all to gain, by havoc and rapine, that the conspirators
  looked for support.</p>

  <p>The first class of these was won, bound by oaths, only less binding than
  their necessities and desperation, sure guaranties for their good faith.</p>

  <p>The second&mdash;Catiline well knew that&mdash;needed no winning. The
  first clang of arms in the streets, the first blaze of incendiary flames, no
  fear but they would rise to rob, to ravish, and slay&mdash;ensuring that
  grand anarchy which he proposed to substitute for the existing state of
  things, and on which he hoped to build up his own tyrannous and
  blood-cemented empire.</p>

  <p>So stood affairs on the evening of the seventeenth; and, although at times
  a suspicion&mdash;not a fear, for of that he was incapable&mdash;flitted
  across the mind of the traitor, that things were not going on as he could
  wish them; that the alienation of Paullus Arvina, and the absence of his
  injured daughter, must probably work together to the discomfiture of the
  conspiracy; still, as hour after hour passed away, and no discovery was made,
  he revelled in his anticipated triumph.</p>

  <p>Of the interview between Paullus and Lucia, he was as yet unaware; and,
  with that singular inconsistency which is to be found in almost every mind,
  although he disbelieved, as a principle, in the existence of honor at all, he
  yet never doubted that young Arvina would hold himself bound strictly by the
  pledge of secrecy which he had reiterated, after the frustration of the
  murderous attempt against his life, in the cave of Egeria.</p>

  <p>Nor did he err in his premises; for had not Arvina been convinced that new
  and more perilous schemes were on the point of being executed against
  himself, he would have remained silent as to the names of the traitors;
  however he might have deemed it his duty to reveal the meditated treason.</p>

  <p>With his plans therefore all matured, his chief subordinates drilled
  thoroughly to the performance of their parts, his minions armed and ready, he
  doubted not in the least, as he gazed on the setting sun, that the next
  rising of the great luminary would look down on the conflagration of the
  suburbs, on the slaughter of his enemies, and the triumphant elevation of
  himself to the supreme command of the vast empire, for which he played so
  foully.</p>

  <p>The morning came, the long desired sun arose, and all his plots were
  countermined, all his hopes of immediate action paralyzed, if not utterly
  destroyed.</p>

  <p>The Senate, assembled on the previous evening at a moment's notice, had
  been taken by surprise so completely by the strange revelations made to them
  by their Consul, that not one of the advocates or friends of Catiline arose
  to say one syllable in his defence; and he himself, quick-witted, ready,
  daring as he was, and fearing neither man nor God, was for once
  thunderstricken and astonished.</p>

  <p>The address of the Consul was short, practical, and to the point; and the
  danger he foretold to the order was so terrible, while the inconvenience of
  deferring the elections was so small, and its occurrence so frequent&mdash;a
  sudden tempest, the striking of the standard on the Janiculum, the
  interruption of a tribune, or the slightest informality in the augural rites
  sufficing to interrupt them&mdash;that little objection was made in any
  quarter, to the motion of Cicero, that the comitia should be delayed, until
  the matter could be thoroughly investigated. For he professed only as yet to
  possess a clue, which he promised hereafter to unravel to the end.</p>

  <p>Catiline had, however, so far recovered from his consternation, that he
  had risen to address the house, when the first words he uttered were drowned
  by a strange and unearthly sound, like the rumbling of ten thousand chariots
  over a stony way, beginning, as it seemed, underneath their feet, and rising
  gradually until it died away over head in the murky air. Before there was
  time for any comment on this extraordinary sound, a tremulous motion crept
  through the marble pavements, increasing every moment, until the doors flew
  violently open, and the vast columns and thick walls of the stately temple
  reeled visibly in the dread earthquake.</p>

  <p>Nor was this all, for as the portals opened, in the black skies, right
  opposite the entrance, there stood, glaring with red and lurid light, a
  bearded star or comet; which, to the terror-stricken eyes of the Fathers,
  seemed a portentous sword, brandished above the city.</p>

  <p>The groans and shrieks of the multitude, rushed in with an appalling sound
  to increase their superstitious awe; and to complete the whole, a pale and
  ghastly messenger was ushered into the house, announcing that a bright
  lambent flame was sitting on the lance-heads of the Praetor's guard, which
  had been summoned to protect the Senate in its deliberations.</p>

  <p>A fell sneer curled the lip of Catiline. He was not even superstitious.
  Self-vanity and confidence in his own powers, and long impunity in crime, had
  hardened him, had maddened him, almost to Atheism. Yet he dared not attack
  the sacred prejudices of the men, whom, but for that occurrence, he had yet
  hoped to win to their own undoing.</p>

  <p>But, as he saw their blanched visages, and heard their mutterings of
  terror, he saw likewise that an impression was made on their minds, which no
  words of his could for the present counteract. And, with a sneering smile at
  fears which he knew not, and a smothered curse at the accident, as he termed
  it, which had foiled him, he sat down silent.</p>

  <p>"The Gods have spoken!" exclaimed Cicero, flinging his arms abroad
  majestically. "The guilty are struck dumb! The Gods have spoken aloud their
  sympathy for Rome's peril; and will ye, ye its chosen sons, whose all of
  happiness and life lie in its sanctity and safety, will ye, I say, love your
  own country, your own mother, less than the Gods love her?"</p>

  <p>The moment was decisive, the appeal irresistible. By acclamation the vote
  was carried; no need to debate or to divide the House&mdash;'that the
  elections be deferred until the eleventh day before the Calends, and that the
  Senate meet again to-morrow, shortly after sunrise, to deliberate what shall
  be done to protect the Republic?'</p>

  <p>Morning came, dark indeed, and lurid, and more like the close, than the
  opening of day. Morning came, but it brought no change with it; for not a
  head in Rome had lain that night upon a pillow, save those of the unburied
  dead, or the bedridden. Young men and aged, sick and sound, masters and
  slaves, had wooed no sleep during the hours of darkness, so terribly, so
  constantly was it illuminated by the broad flashes of blue lightning, and the
  strange meteors, which rushed almost incessantly athwart the sky. The winds
  too had been all unchained in their fury, and went howling like tormented
  spirits, over the terrified and trembling city.</p>

  <p>It was said too, that the shades of the dead had arisen, and were seen
  mingling in the streets with the living, scarcely more livid than the
  half-dead spectators of portents so ominous. No rumour so absurd or
  fanatical, but it found on that night, implicit credence. Some shouted in the
  streets and open places, that the patricians and the knights were arming
  their adherents for a promiscuous massacre of the people. Some, that the
  gladiators had broken loose, and slain thousands of citizens already! Some,
  that there was a Gallic tumult, and that the enemy would be at the gates in
  the morning! Some that the Gods had judged Rome to destruction!</p>

  <p>And so they raved, and roared, and sometimes fought; and would have rioted
  tremendously; for many of the commoner conspirators were abroad, ready to
  take advantage of any casual incident to breed an affray; but that a strong
  force of civil magistrates patrolled the streets with armed attendants; and
  that, during the night several cohorts were brought in, from the armies of
  Quintus Marcius Rex, and Quintus Metellus Creticus, with all their armor and
  war weapons, in heavy marching order; and occupied the Capitol, the Palatine,
  and the Janiculum, and all the other prominent and commanding points of the
  city, with an array that set opposition at defiance.</p>

  <p>So great, however, were the apprehensions of many of the nobles, that Rome
  was on the eve of a servile insurrection, that many of them armed their
  freedmen, and imprisoned all their slaves; while others, the more generous
  and milder, who thought they could rely on the attachment of their people,
  weaponed their slaves themselves, and fortified their isolated dwellings
  against the anticipated onslaught.</p>

  <p>Thus passed that terrible and tempestuous night; the roar of the elements,
  unchained as they were, and at their work of havoc, not sufficing to drown
  the dissonant and angry cries of men, the clash of weapons, and the shrill
  clamor of women; which made Rome more resemble the Pandemonium than the
  metropolis of the world's most civilized and mightiest nation.</p>

  <p>But now morning had come at length; and gradually, as the storm ceased,
  and the heavens resumed their natural appearance, the terrors and the fury of
  the multitude subsided; and, partly satisfied by the constant and well-timed
  proclamations of the magistrates, partly convinced that for the moment there
  was no hope of successful outrage, and yet more wearied out with their own
  turbulent vehemence, whether of fear or anger, the crowd began to retire to
  their houses, and the streets were left empty and silent.</p>

  <p>As the day dawned, there was no banner hoisted on the Janiculum, although
  its turrets might be seen bristling with the short massive javelins of the
  legions, and gleaming with the tawny light that flashed from their brazen
  casques and corslets.</p>

  <p>There was no augural tent pitched on the hills without the city walls,
  wherefrom to take the auspices.</p>

  <p>And above all, there were no loud and stirring calls of the brazen
  trumpets of the centuries, to summon forth the civic army of the Roman people
  to the Campus, there to elect their rulers for the ensuing year.</p>

  <p>It was apparent therefore to all men, that the elections would not be held
  that day, though none knew clearly wherefore they had been deferred.</p>

  <p>While the whole city was loud with turbulent confusion&mdash;for, as
  morning broke, and it was known that the comitia were postponed, the
  agitation of terror succeeded to that of insubordination&mdash;Hortensia and
  her daughter sat together, pale, anxious, and heartsick, yet firm and free
  from all unworthy evidences of dismay.</p>

  <p>During the past night, which had been to both a sleepless one, they had
  sate listening, lone and weak women, to the roar of tumultuous streets, and
  expecting at every moment they knew not what of violence and outrage.</p>

  <p>Paullus Arvina had come in once to reassure them: and informed them that
  the vigilance of the Consul had been crowned with success, and that the
  danger of a conflict in the streets was subsiding every moment.</p>

  <p>Still, the care which he bestowed on examining the fastenings of the
  doors, and such windows as looked into the streets, the earnestness with
  which he inculcated watchful heed to the armed slaves of the household, and
  the positive manner in which he insisted on leaving Thrasea and a dozen of
  his own trustiest men to assist Hortensia's people, did more to obliterate
  the hopes his own words would otherwise have excited, than the words
  themselves to excite them.</p>

  <p>Nor was it, indeed, to be wondered that Hortensia should be liable, above
  other women, not to base terror,&mdash;for of that from her high character
  she was incapable&mdash;but to a settled apprehension and distrust of the
  Roman Populace.</p>

  <p>It was now four-and-twenty years since the city had been disturbed by
  plebeian violence or aristocratic vengeance. Twenty-four years ago, the
  avenging sword of Sylla had purged the state of its bloodthirsty demagogues,
  and their brute followers; twenty-four years ago his powerful hand had
  reestablished Rome's ancient constitution, full of checks and balances, which
  secured equal rights to every Roman citizen; which secured all equality, in
  short to all men, save that which no human laws can give, equality of social
  rank, and equality of wealth.</p>

  <p>The years, however, which had gone before that restoration, the dreadful
  massacres and yet more dreadful proscriptions of Cinna and Marius, had left
  indelible and sanguinary traces on the ancestral tree of many a noble house;
  and on none deeper than on that of Hortensia's family.</p>

  <p>Her brother, Caius Julius, an orator second to none in those days, had
  been murdered by the followers of Marius, almost before his sister's eyes,
  with circumstances of appalling cruelty. Her house had been forced open by
  the infuriate rabble, her husband hewn down with unnumbered wounds, on his
  own hearth-stone, and her first born child tossed upon the revolutionary pike
  heads.</p>

  <p>Her husband indeed recovered, almost miraculously, from his wounds, and
  lived to see retribution fall upon the guilty partizans of Marius; but he was
  never well again, and after languishing for years, died at last of the wounds
  he received on that bloody day.</p>

  <p>Good cause, then, had Hortensia to tremble at the tender mercies of the
  people.</p>

  <p>Nor, though they struck the minds of these high-born ladies with less
  perplexity and awe than the vulgar souls without, were the portents and
  horrors of the heaven, without due effect. No mind in those days, however
  clear and enlightened, but held some lingering belief that such things were
  ominous of coming wrath, and sent by the Gods to inform their faithful
  worshippers.</p>

  <p>It was moreover fresh in her memory, how two years before, during the
  consulship of Cotta and Torquatus, in a like terrible night-storm, the fire
  from heaven had stricken down the highest turrets of the capitol, melted the
  brazen tables of the law, and scathed the gilded effigy of Romulus and Remus,
  sucking their shaggy foster-mother, which stood on the Capitoline.</p>

  <p>The augurs in those days, collected from Etruria and all parts of Italy,
  after long consultation, had proclaimed that unless the Gods should be
  appeased duly, the end of Rome and her empire was at hand.</p>

  <p>And now&mdash;what though for ten whole days consecutive the sacred games
  went on; what though nothing had been omitted whereby to avert the immortal
  indignation&mdash;did not this heaven-born tempest prove that the wrath was
  not soothed, that the decree yet stood firm?</p>

  <p>In such deep thoughts, and in the strong excitement of such expectation,
  Hortensia and her daughter had passed that awful night; not without high
  instructions from the elder lady, grave and yet stirring narratives of the
  great men of old&mdash;how they strove fiercely, energetically, while strife
  could avail anything; and how, when the last hope was over, they folded their
  hands in stern and awful resignation, and met their fate unblenching, and
  with but one care&mdash;that the decorum of their deaths should not prove
  unworthy the dignity of their past lives.</p>

  <p>Not without generous and noble resolutions on the part of both, that they
  too would not be found wanting.</p>

  <p>But there was nothing humble, nothing soft, in their stern and proud
  submission to the inevitable necessity. Nothing of love toward the hand which
  dealt the blow&mdash;nothing of confidence in supernal justice, much less in
  supernal mercy! Nothing of that sweet hope, that undying trust, that
  consciousness of self-unworthiness, that full conviction of a glorious
  future, which renders so beautiful and happy the submission of a dying
  Christian.</p>

  <p>No! there were none of these things; for to the wisest and best of the
  ancients, the foreshadowings of the soul's immortality were dim, faint, and
  uncertain. The legends of their mythology held up such pictures of the
  sensuality and vice of those whom they called Gods, that it was utterly
  impossible for any sound understanding to accept them. And deep thinkers were
  consequently driven into pure Deism, coupled too often with the Epicurean
  creed, that the Great Spirit was too grand and too sublime to trouble himself
  with the brief doings of mortality.</p>

  <p>The whole scope of the Roman's hope and ambition, then, was limited to
  this world; or, if there was a longing for anything beyond the term of
  mortality, it was for a name, a memory, an immortality of good report.</p>

  <p>And pride, which the christian, better instructed, knows to be the germ
  and root of all sin, was to the Roman, the sole spring of honourable action,
  the sole source of virtue.</p>

  <p>Now, with the morning, quiet was restored both to the angry skies, and to
  the restless city.</p>

  <p>Worn out with anxiety, and watching, sleep fell upon the eyes of Julia, as
  she sat half recumbent in a large softly-cushioned chair of Etruscan bronze.
  Her fair head fell back on the crimson pillow, with all its wealth of auburn
  ringlets flowing dishevelled; and that soft still shadow, which is yet, in
  its beautiful serenity, half terrible, so nearly is it allied to the shadow
  of that sleep from which there comes no waking, fell over her pale
  features.</p>

  <p>The mother gazed on her for a moment, with more gentleness in her eye, and
  a milder smile on her face, than her indomitable pride often permitted her to
  manifest.</p>

  <p>"She sleeps"&mdash;she said, looking at her wistfully&mdash;"she sleeps!
  Aye! the young sleep easily, even in their affliction. They sleep, and forget
  their sorrows, and awaken, either to fresh woes, as soon to be obliterated,
  or to vain joys, yet briefer, and more fleeting. Thoughtlessness to the
  young&mdash;anguish to the old&mdash;such is mortality! And what
  beyond?&mdash;aye, what?&mdash;what that we should so toil, so suffer, to be
  virtuous? Is it a dream, all a dream&mdash;this futurity? I fear
  so"&mdash;and, with the words, she lapsed into a fit of solemn meditation,
  and stood for many minutes silent, and absorbed. Then a keen light came into
  her dark eyes, a flash of animation coloured her pale cheeks, she stretched
  her arms aloft, and in a clear sonorous voice&mdash;"No! no!" she said,
  "Honour&mdash;honour&mdash;immortal honour; thou, at least, art no
  dream&mdash;thou art worth dying, suffering, aye! worth <i>living</i>to
  obtain! For what is life but the deeper sorrow, to the more virtuous and the
  nobler?"</p>

  <p>A few minutes longer she stood gazing on her daughter's beautiful face,
  until the sound of voices louder than usual, and a slight bustle, in the
  peristyle, attracted her attention. Then, after throwing a pallium, or shawl,
  of richly embroidered woollen stuff over the fair form of the sleeper, she
  opened the door leading to the garden colonnade, and left the room
  silently.</p>

  <p>Scarcely had Hortensia disappeared, before the opposite door, by which the
  saloon communicated with the atrium, was opened, and a slave entered, bearing
  a small folded note, secured by a waxen seal, on a silver plate.</p>

  <p>He approached Julia's chair, apparently in some hesitation, as if he felt
  that it was his duty, and was yet half afraid to awaken her. At length,
  however, he made up his mind, and addressed a word or two to her, which were
  sufficiently distinct to arouse her&mdash;for she started up and gazed wildly
  about her&mdash;but left no clear impression of their meaning on her
  mind.</p>

  <p>This, however, the man did not appear to notice; at all events, he did not
  wait to observe the effect of his communication, but quitted the room
  hastily, and in considerable trepidation, leaving the note on the table.</p>

  <p>Julia was sleeping very heavily, at the moment when she was so startled
  from her slumber; and, as is not unfrequently the case, a sort of
  bewilderment and nervous agitation fell upon her, as she recovered her
  senses. Perhaps she had been dreaming, and the imaginary events of her dream
  had blended themselves with the real occurrence which awakened her. But for a
  minute or two, though she saw the note, and the person who laid it on the
  table, she could neither bring it to her mind who that person was, nor divest
  herself of the impression that there was something both dangerous and
  supernatural in what had passed.</p>

  <p>In a little while this feeling passed away, and, though still nervous and
  trembling, the young girl smiled at her own alarm, as she took up the billet,
  which was directed to herself in a delicate feminine hand, with the usual
  form of superscription&mdash;</p>

  <p>"To Julia Serena, health"&mdash;</p>

  <p>although the writer's name was omitted.</p>

  <p>She gazed at it for a moment, wondering from whom it could come; since she
  had no habitual correspondent, and the hand-writing, though beautiful, was
  strange to her. She opened it, and read, her wonder and agitation increasing
  with every line&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You love Paullus Arvina," thus it ran, "and are loved by him. He is
  worthy all your affection. Are you worthy of him, I know not. I love him
  also, but alas! less happy, am not loved again, nor hope to be, nor indeed
  deserve it! They tell me you are beautiful; I have seen you, and yet I know
  not&mdash;they told me once that I too was beautiful, and yet I know not! I
  know this only, that I am desperate, and base, and miserable! Yet fear me
  not, nor mistake me. I love Paullus, yet would not have him mine, now; no!
  not to be happy&mdash;as to be his would render me. Yet had it not been for
  you, I might have been virtuous, honourable, happy, <i>his</i>&mdash;for
  winning him from me, you won from me hope; and with hope virtue; and with
  virtue honour! Ought I not then to hate you, Julia? Perchance I
  ought&mdash;to do so were at least Roman&mdash;and hating to avenge!
  Perchance, if I <i>hoped</i>, I should. But hoping nothing, I hate nothing,
  dread nothing, and wish nothing.&mdash;Yea! by the Gods! I wish to know
  Paullus happy&mdash;yea! more, I wish, even at cost of my own misery, to make
  him happy. Shall I do so, by making him yours, Julia? I think so, for be
  sure&mdash;be sure, he loves you. Else had he yielded to my blandishments, to
  my passion, to my beauty! for I am&mdash;by the Gods! I am, though he sees it
  not, as beautiful as thou. And I am proud likewise&mdash;or was proud
  once&mdash;for misery has conquered pride in me; or what is weaker yet, and
  baser&mdash;love!"</p>

  <p>"I think you will make him happy. You can if you will. Do so, by all the
  Gods! I adjure you do so; and if you do not, tremble!&mdash;tremble, I
  say&mdash;for think, if I sacrifice myself to win bliss for him&mdash;think,
  girl, how gladly, how triumphantly, I would destroy a rival, who should fail
  to do that, for which alone I spare her.</p>

  <p>"Spare her! nay, but much more; for I can save her&mdash;can and will.</p>

  <p>"Strange things will come to pass ere long, and terrible; and to no one so
  terrible as to you.</p>

  <p>"There is a man in Rome, so powerful, that the Gods, only, if there be
  Gods, can compare with him&mdash;so haughty in ambition, that stood he second
  in Olympus, he would risk all things to be first&mdash;so cruel, that the
  dug- drawn Hyrcanian tigress were pitiful compared to him&mdash;so reckless
  of all things divine or human, that, did his own mother stand between him and
  his vengeance, he would strike through her heart to gain it.</p>

  <p>"This man hath Paullus made his foe&mdash;he hath crossed his path; he
  hath <i>foiled</i> him!</p>

  <p>"He never spared man in his wrath, or woman in his passion.</p>

  <p>"He hateth Paullus!</p>

  <p>"He hath looked on Julia!</p>

  <p>"Think, then, when lust and hate spur such a man together, what will
  restrain him.</p>

  <p>"Now mark me, and you shall yet be safe. All means will be essayed to win
  you, for he would torture Paul by making him his slave, ere he make you his
  victim.</p>

  <p>"And Paul may waver. He hath wavered once. Chance only, and I, rescued
  him! I can do no more, for Rome must know me no longer! See, then, that thou
  hold him constant in the right&mdash;firm for his country! So may he defy
  secret spite, as he hath defied open violence.</p>

  <p>"Now for thyself&mdash;beware of women! Go not forth alone ever, or
  without armed followers! Sleep not, but with a woman in thy chamber, and a
  watcher at thy door! Eat not, nor drink, any thing abroad; nor at home, save
  that which is prepared by known hands, and tasted by the slave who serves
  it!</p>

  <p>"Be true to Paullus, and yourself, and you have a friend ever watchful. So
  fear not, nor despond!</p>

  <p>"Fail me&mdash;and, failing truth and honour, failing to make Paullus
  happy, you <i>do</i> fail me! Fail me, and nothing, in the world's history or
  fable, shall match the greatness of my vengeance&mdash;of your anguish!</p>

  <p>"Fail me! and yours shall be, for ages, the name that men shall quote,
  when they would tell of untold misery, of utter shame, and desolation, and
  despair.</p>

  <p>"Farewell."</p>

  <p>The letter dropped from her hand; she sat aghast and speechless, terrified
  beyond measure, and yet unable to determine, or divine, even, to what its
  dark warnings and darker denunciations pointed.</p>

  <p>Just at this instant, as between terror and amazement she was on the verge
  of fainting, a clanging step was heard without; the crimson draperies that
  covered the door, were put aside; and, clad in glittering armour, Paullus
  Arvina stood before her.</p>

  <p>She started up, with a strange haggard smile flashing across her pallid
  face, staggered a step or two to meet him, and sank in an agony of tears upon
  his bosom.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch115"
     name="ch115"></a>XV. &mdash; THE CONFESSION</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>To err is human; to
     forgive&mdash;divine!</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">THE astonishment of Paullus, at this strange burst of
  feeling on the part of one usually so calm, so self-controlled, and seemingly
  so unimpassioned as that sweet lady, may be more easily imagined than
  described.</p>

  <p>That she, whose maidenly reserve had never heretofore permitted the
  slightest, the most innocent freedom of her accepted lover, should cast
  herself thus into his arms, should rest her head on his bosom, was in itself
  enough to surprise him; but when to this were added the violent convulsive
  sobs, which shook her whole frame, the flood of tears, which streamed from
  her eyes, the wild and disjointed words, which fell from her pale lips, he
  was struck dumb with something not far removed from terror.</p>

  <p>That it was fear, which shook her thus, he could not credit; for during
  all the fearful sounds and rumours of the past night, she had been as firm as
  a hero.</p>

  <p>Yet he knew not, dared not think, to what other cause he might attribute
  it.</p>

  <p>He spoke to her soothingly, tenderly, but his voice faltered as he
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Nay! nay! be not alarmed, dear girl!" he said. "The tumults are all, long
  since, quelled; the danger has all vanished with the darkness, and the storm.
  Cheer up, my own, sweet, Julia."</p>

  <p>And, as he spoke, he passed his arm about her graceful form, and drew her
  closer to his bosom.</p>

  <p>But whether it was this movement, or something in his words that aroused
  her, she started from his arms in a moment; and stood erect and rigid, pale
  still and agitated, but no longer trembling. She raised her hands to her
  brow, and put away the profusion of rich auburn ringlets, which had fallen
  down dishevelled over her eyes, and gazed at him stedfastly, strangely, as
  she had never gazed at him before.</p>

  <p>"Your own Julia!" she said, in slow accents, scarce louder than a whisper,
  but full of strong and painful meaning. "Oh! I adjure you, by the Gods! by
  all you love! or hope! Are you false to me, Paullus!"</p>

  <p>"False! Julia!" he exclaimed, starting, and the blood rushing consciously
  to his bold face.</p>

  <p>"I am answered!" she said, collecting herself, with a desperate effort.
  "It is well&mdash;the Gods guard you!&mdash;Leave me!"</p>

  <p>"Leave you!" he cried. "By earth, and sea, and heaven, and all that they
  contain! I know not what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Know you this writing, then?" she asked him, reaching the letter from the
  table, and holding it before his eyes.</p>

  <p>"No more than I know, what so strangely moves you," he answered; and she
  saw, by the unaffected astonishment which pervaded all his features, that he
  spoke truly.</p>

  <p>"Read it," she said, somewhat more composed; "and tell me, who is the
  writer of it. You must know."</p>

  <p>Before he had read six lines, it was clear to him that it must come from
  Lucia, and no words can describe the agony, the eager intense torture of
  anticipation, with which he perused it, devouring every word, and at every
  word expecting to find the damning record of his falsehood inscribed in
  characters, that should admit of no denial.</p>

  <p>Before, however, he had reached the middle of the letter, he felt that he
  could bear the scrutiny of that pale girl no longer; and, lowering the strip
  of vellum on which it was written, met her eye firmly.</p>

  <p>For he was resolute for once to do the true and honest thing, let what
  might come of it. The weaker points of his character were vanishing rapidly,
  and the last few eventful days had done the work of years upon his mind; and
  all that work was salutary.</p>

  <p>She, too, read something in the expression of his eye, which led her to
  hope&mdash;what, she knew not; and she smiled faintly, as she said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You know the writer, Paullus?"</p>

  <p>"Julia, I know her," he replied steadily.</p>

  <p>"Her!" she said, laying an emphasis on the word, but how affected by it
  Arvina could not judge. "It <i>is</i> then a woman?"</p>

  <p>"A very young, a very beautiful, a very wretched, girl!" he answered.</p>

  <p>"And you love her?" she said, with an effort at firmness, which itself
  proved the violence of her emotion.</p>

  <p>"By your life! Julia, I do not!" he replied, with an energy, that spoke
  well for the truth of his asseveration.</p>

  <p>"Nor ever loved her?"</p>

  <p>"Nor ever&mdash;<i>loved</i> her, Julia." But he hesitated a little as he
  said it; and laid a peculiar stress on the word loved, which did not escape
  the anxious ears of the lovely being, whose whole soul hung suspended on his
  speech.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she asked, after a moment's pause, "if she be so very young,
  and so very beautiful?"</p>

  <p>"I might answer, because I never saw her, 'till I loved one more
  beautiful. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you will not!" she interrupted him vehemently. "Oh! if you love me?
  if you <i>do</i> love me, Paullus, do not answer me so."</p>

  <p>"And wherefore not?" he asked her, half smiling, though little mirthful in
  his heart, at her impetuosity.</p>

  <p>"Because if you descend to flatter," answered the fair girl quietly, "I
  shall be sure that you intended to deceive me."</p>

  <p>"It would be strictly true, notwithstanding. For though, as she says, we
  met years ago, she was but a child then; and, since that time, I never saw
  her until four or five days ago&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And since then, how often?" Julia again interrupted him; for, in the
  intensity of her anxiety, she could not wait the full answer to one question,
  before another suggested itself to her mind, and found voice at the
  instant.</p>

  <p>"Once, Julia."</p>

  <p>"Only once?"</p>

  <p>"Once only, by the Gods!"</p>

  <p>"You have not told me wherefore it was, that you never loved her!"</p>

  <p>"Have I not told you, that I never saw her till a few days, a few hours, I
  might have said, ago? and does not that tell you wherefore, Julia?"</p>

  <p>"But there is something more. There is another reason. Oh! tell me, I
  adjure you, by all that you hold dearest, tell me!"</p>

  <p>"There is another reason. I told you that she was very young, and very
  beautiful; but, Julia, she was also very guilty!"</p>

  <p>"Guilty!" exclaimed the fair girl, blushing fiery red, "guilty of loving
  you! Oh! Paullus! Paullus!" and between shame, and anger, and the repulsive
  shock that every pure and feminine mind experiences in hearing of a sister's
  frailty, she buried her face in her hands, and wept aloud.</p>

  <p>"Guilty, before I ever heard her name, or knew that she existed," answered
  the young man, fervently; but his heart smote him somewhat, as he spoke;
  though what he said was but the simple truth, and it was well for him perhaps
  at the present moment, that Julia did not see his face. For there was much
  perturbation in it, and it is like that she would have judged even more
  hardly of that perturbation than it entirely deserved. He paused for a
  moment, and then added,</p>

  <p>"But if the guilt of woman can be excusable at all, she can plead more in
  extenuation of her errors, than any of her sex that ever fell from virtue.
  She is most penitent; and might have been, but for fate and the atrocious
  wickedness of others, a most noble being&mdash;as she is now a most glorious
  ruin."</p>

  <p>There was another pause, during which neither spoke or moved, Julia
  overpowered by the excess of her feelings&mdash;he by the painful
  consciousness of wrong; the difficulty of explaining, of extenuating his own
  conduct; and above all, the dread of losing the enchanting creature, whom he
  had never loved so deeply or so truly as he did now, when he had well nigh
  forfeited all claim to her affection.</p>

  <p>At length, she raised her eyes timidly to his, and said,</p>

  <p>"This is all very strange&mdash;there must be much, that I have a right to
  hear."</p>

  <p>"There is much, Julia!&mdash;much that will be very painful for me to
  tell; and yet more so for you to listen to."</p>

  <p>"And will you tell it to me?"</p>

  <p>"Julia, I will!"</p>

  <p>"And all? and truly?"</p>

  <p>"And all, and truly, if I tell you at all; but you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"First," she said, interrupting him, "read that strange letter to the end.
  Then we will speak more of these things. Nay?" she continued, seeing that he
  was about to speak, "I will have it so. It must be so, or all is at an end
  between us two, now, and for ever. I do not wish to watch you; there is no
  meanness in my mind, Paullus, no jealousy! I am too proud to be jealous.
  Either you are worthy of my affection, or unworthy; if the latter, I cast you
  from me without one pang, one sorrow;&mdash;if the first, farther words are
  needless. Read that wild letter to the end. I will turn my back to you." And
  seating herself at the table, she took up a piece of embroidery, and made as
  if she would have fixed her mind upon it. But Paullus saw, as his glance
  followed her, that, notwithstanding the firmness of her words and manner, her
  hand trembled so much that she could by no means thread her needle.</p>

  <p>He gazed on her for a moment with passionate, despairing love, and as he
  gazed, his spirit faltered, and he doubted. The evil genius whispered to his
  soul, that truth must alienate her love, must sever her from him for ever.
  There was a sharp and bitter struggle in his heart for that moment&mdash;but
  it passed; and the better spirit was again strong and clear within him.</p>

  <p>"No!" he said to himself, "No! I have done with fraud, and falsehood! I
  will not win her by a lie! If by the truth I must lose her, be it so! I will
  be true, and at least I can&mdash;die!"</p>

  <p>Thereon, without another word, he read the letter to the end, neither
  faltering, nor pausing; and then walked calmly to the table, and laid it
  down, perfectly resolute and tranquil, for his mind was made up for the
  worst.</p>

  <p>"Have you read it?" she asked, and her voice trembled, as much as her hand
  had done before.</p>

  <p>"I have, Julia, to the end. It is very sad&mdash;and much of it is
  true."</p>

  <p>"And who is the girl, who wrote it?"</p>

  <p>"Her name is Lucia Orestilla."</p>

  <p>"Orestilla! Ye Gods! ye Gods! the shameless wife of the arch villain
  Catiline!"</p>

  <p>"Not so&mdash;but the wretched, ruined daughter of that abandoned
  woman!"</p>

  <p>"Call her not woman! By the Gods that protect purity! call her not woman!
  Did she not prompt the wretch to poison his own son! Oh! call her anything
  but woman! But what&mdash;what&mdash;in the name of all that is good or holy,
  can have brought you to know that awful being's daughter?"</p>

  <p>"First, Julia, you must promise me never, to mortal ears, to reveal what I
  now disclose to you."</p>

  <p>"Have you forgotten, Paullus, that I am yet but a young maiden, and that I
  have a mother?"</p>

  <p>"Hortensia!" exclaimed the youth, starting back, aghast; for he felt that
  from her clear eye and powerful judgment nothing could be concealed, and that
  her iron will would yield in nothing to a woman's tenderness, a woman's
  mercy.</p>

  <p>"Hortensia," replied the girl gently, "the best, the wisest, and the
  tenderest of mothers."</p>

  <p>"True? she is all that you say&mdash;more than all! But she is resolute,
  withal, as iron; and stern, and cold, and unforgiving in her anger!"</p>

  <p>"And do you need so much forgiveness, Paullus?"</p>

  <p>"More, I fear, than my Julia's love will grant me."</p>

  <p>"I think, my Paullus, you do not know the measure of a girl's honest love.
  But may I tell Hortensia? If not, you have said enough. What is not fitting
  for a girl to speak to her own mother, it is not fitting that she should hear
  at all&mdash;least of all from a man, and that man&mdash;her lover!"</p>

  <p>"It is not that, my Julia. But what I have to say contains many
  lives&mdash;mine among others! contains Rome's safety, nay! existence! One
  whisper breathed abroad, or lisped in a slave's hearing, were the World's
  ruin. But be it as you will&mdash;as you think best yourself and wisest. If
  you will, tell Hortensia."</p>

  <p>"I shall tell her, Paullus. I tell her everything. Since I could babble my
  first words, I never had a secret from her!"</p>

  <p>"Be it so, sweet one. Now I implore you, hear me to the end, before you
  judge me, and then judge mercifully, as the Gods are merciful, and mortals
  prone to error."</p>

  <p>"And will you tell me the whole truth?"</p>

  <p>"The whole."</p>

  <p>"Say on, then. I will hear you to the end; and your guilt must be great,
  Paullus, if you require a more partial arbitress."</p>

  <p>It was a trying and painful task, that was forced upon him, yet he went
  through it nobly. At every word the difficulties grew upon him. At every word
  the temptation, to swerve from the truth, increased. At every word the dread
  of losing her, the agony of apprehension, the dull cold sense of despair,
  waxed heavier, and more stunning. The longer he spoke, the more certain he
  felt that by his own words he was destroying his own hope; yet he manned his
  heart stoutly, resisted the foul tempter, and, firm in the integrity of his
  present purpose, laid bare the secrets of his soul.</p>

  <p>Beginning from his discovery of Medon's corpse upon the Esquiline, he now
  narrated to her fully all that had passed, including much that in his
  previous tale he had omitted. He told of his first meeting with Cataline upon
  the Caelian; of his visit to Cicero; of his strange conversation with the
  cutler Volero; of his second encounter with the traitor in the field of Mars,
  not omitting the careless accident by which he revealed to him Volero's
  recognition of the weapon. He told her of the banquet, of the art with which
  Catiline plied him with wine, of the fascinations of that fair fatal girl.
  And here, he paused awhile, reluctant to proceed. He would have given worlds,
  had he possessed them, to catch one glance of her averted eye, to read her
  features but one moment. But she sat, with her back toward him, her head
  downcast, tranquil and motionless, save that a tremulous shivering at times
  ran through her frame perceptible.</p>

  <p>He was compelled perforce to continue his narration; and now he was bound
  to confess that, for the moment, he had been so bewitched by the charms of
  the siren, that he had bound himself by the fatal oath, scarce knowing what
  he swore, which linked him to the fortunes of the villain father. Slightly he
  touched on that atrocity of Catiline, by telling which aloud he dared not
  sully her pure ears. He then related clearly and succinctly the murder of the
  cutler Volero, his recognition of the murderer, the forced deception which he
  had used reluctantly toward Cicero, and the suspicions and distrust of that
  great man. And here again he paused, hoping that she would speak, and
  interrupt him, if it were even to condemn, for so at least he should be
  relieved from the sickening apprehension, which almost choked his voice.</p>

  <p>Still, she was silent, and, in so far as he could judge, more tranquil
  than before. For the quick tremors had now ceased to shake her, and her
  tears, he believed, had ceased to flow.</p>

  <p>But was not this the cold tranquillity of a fixed resolution, the firmness
  of a desperate, self-controlling effort?</p>

  <p>He could endure the doubt no longer. And, in a softer and more humble
  voice,</p>

  <p>"Now, then," he said, "you know the measure of my sin&mdash;the extent of
  my falsehood. All the ill of my tale is told, faithfully, frankly. What
  remains, is unmixed with evil. Say, then; have I sinned, Julia, beyond the
  hope of forgiveness? If to confess that, my eyes dazzled with beauty, my
  blood inflamed with wine, my better self drowned in a tide of luxury unlike
  aught I had ever known before, my senses wrought upon by every art, and every
  fascination&mdash;if to confess, that my head was bewildered, my reason lost
  its way for a moment&mdash;though my heart never, never failed in its
  faith&mdash;and by the hopes, frail hopes, which I yet cling to of obtaining
  you&mdash;the dread of losing you for ever! Julia, by these I swear, my heart
  never did fail or falter! If, I say, to confess this be sufficient, and I
  stand thus condemned and lost for ever, spare me the rest&mdash;I may as well
  be silent!"</p>

  <p>She paused a moment, ere she answered; and it was only with an effort,
  choking down a convulsive sob, that she found words at all.</p>

  <p>"Proceed," she said, "with your tale. I cannot answer you."</p>

  <p>But, catching at her words, with all the elasticity of youthful hope, he
  fancied that she <i>had</i> answered him, and cried joyously and
  eagerly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Sweet Julia, then you can, you will forgive me."</p>

  <p>"I have not said so, Paullus," she began. But he interrupted her, ere she
  could frame her sentence&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No! dearest; but your speech implied it, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But here, in her turn, she interrupted him, saying&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Then, Paullus, did my speech imply what I did not intend. For I have
  <i>not</i> forgiven&mdash;do not know if I can forgive, all that has passed.
  All depends on that which is to come. You made me promise not to interrupt
  your tale. I have not done so; and, in justice, I have the right to ask that
  you should tell it out, before you claim my final answer. So I say, once
  again, Proceed."</p>

  <p>Unable, from the steadiness of her demeanour, so much even as to
  conjecture what were her present feelings, yet much dispirited at finding his
  mistake, the young man proceeded with his narrative. Gaining courage,
  however, as he continued speaking, the principal difficulties of his story
  being past, he warmed and spoke more feelingly, more eloquently, with every
  word he uttered.</p>

  <p>He told her of the deep depression, which had fallen on him the following
  morning, when her letter had called him to the house of Hortensia. He again
  related the attack made on him by Catiline, on the same evening, in Egeria's
  grotto; and spoke of the absolute despair, in which he was plunged, seeing
  the better course, yet unable to pursue it; aiming at virtue, yet forced by
  his fatal oath to follow vice; marking clearly before him the beacon light of
  happiness and honour, yet driven irresistibly into the gulf of misery, crime,
  and destruction. He told her of Lucia's visit to his house; how she released
  him from his fatal oath! disclaimed all right to his affection, nay! to his
  respect, even, and esteem! encouraged him to hold honour in his eye, and in
  the scorn of consequence to follow virtue for its own sake! He told her, too,
  of the conspiracy, in all its terrible details of atrocity and
  guilt&mdash;that dark and hideous scheme of treason, cruelty, lust, horror,
  from which he had himself escaped so narrowly.</p>

  <p>Then, with a glow of conscious rectitude, he proved to her that he had
  indeed repented; that he was now, howsoever he might have been deceived into
  error and to the brink of crime, firm, and resolved; a champion of the right;
  a defender of his country; trusted and chosen by the Great Consul; and, in
  proof of that trust, commissioned by him now to lead his troop of horsemen to
  Praeneste, a strong fortress, near at hand, which there was reason to expect
  might be assailed by the conspirators.</p>

  <p>"And now, my tale is ended," he said. "I did hope there would have been no
  need to reveal these things to you; but from the first, I have been resolved,
  if need were, to open to you my whole heart&mdash;to show you its dark spots,
  as its bright ones. I have sinned, Julia, deeply, against you! Your purity,
  your love, should have guarded me! Yet, in a moment of treacherous
  self-confidence, my head grew dizzy, and I fell. But oh! believe me, Julia,
  my heart never once betrayed you! Now say&mdash;can you pardon me&mdash;trust
  me&mdash;love me&mdash;be mine, as you promised? If not&mdash;speed me on my
  way, and my first battle-field shall prove my truth to Rome and Julia."</p>

  <p>"Oh! this is very sad, my Paullus," she replied; "very
  humiliating&mdash;very, very bitter. I had a trust so perfect in your love. I
  could as soon have believed the sunflower would forget to turn to the
  day-god, as that Paul would forget Julia. I had a confidence so high, so
  noble, in your proud, untouched virtue. And yet I find, that at the first
  alluring glance of a frail beauty, you fall off from your truth to
  me&mdash;at the first whispering temptation of a demon, you half fall off
  from patriotism&mdash;honour&mdash;virtue! Forgive you, Paullus! I can
  forgive you readily. For well, alas! I know that the best of us all are very
  frail, and prone to evil. Love you? alas! for me, I do as much as
  ever&mdash;but say, yourself, how can I trust you? how can I be yours? when
  the next moment you may fall again into temptation, again yield to it. And
  then, what would then remain to the wretched Julia, but a most miserable
  life, and an untimely grave?"</p>

  <p>The proud man bowed his head in bitter anguish; he buried his face in his
  hands; he gasped, and almost groaned aloud, in his great agony. His heart
  confessed the truth of all her words, and it was long ere he could answer
  her. Perhaps he would not have collected courage to do so at all, but would
  have risen in his agony of pride and despair, and gone his way to die,
  heart-broken, hopeless, a lost man.</p>

  <p>But she&mdash;for her heart yearned to her lover&mdash;arose and crossed
  the room with noiseless step to the spot where he sat, and laid her fair hand
  gently on his shoulder, and whispered in her voice of silvery music,</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Paullus, how can I trust you?"</p>

  <p>"Because I have told you all this, truly! Think you I had humbled myself
  thus, had I not been firm to resist? think you I have had no temptation to
  deceive you, to keep back a part, to palliate? and lo! I have told you
  all&mdash;the shameful, naked truth! How can I ever be so bribed again to
  falsehood, as I have been in this last hour, by hope of winning, and by dread
  of losing you, my soul's idol? Because I have been true, now to the last, I
  think that you may trust me."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure, Paullus?" she said, with a soft sad smile, yet suffering
  him to retain the little hand he had imprisoned while he was
  speaking&mdash;"very, very sure?"</p>

  <p>"Will you believe me, Julia?"</p>

  <p>"Will you be true hereafter, Paullus?"</p>

  <p>"By all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nay! swear not by the Gods," she interrupted him; "they say the Gods
  laugh at the perjury of lovers! But oh! remember, Paullus, that if you were
  indeed untrue to Julia, she could but die!"</p>

  <p>He caught her to his heart, and she for once resisted not; and, for the
  first time permitted, his lips were pressed to hers in a long, chaste, holy
  kiss.</p>

  <p>"And now," he said, "my own, own Julia, I must say fare you well. My horse
  awaits me at your door&mdash;my troopers are half the way hence to
  Praeneste."</p>

  <p>"Nay!" she replied, blushing deeply, "but you will surely see Hortensia,
  ere you go."</p>

  <p>"It must be, then, but for a moment," he answered. "For duty calls me; and
  <i>you</i> must not tempt me to break my new-born resolution. But say, Julia,
  will you tell all these things to Hortensia?"</p>

  <p>She smiled, and laid her hand upon his mouth; but he kissed it, and drew
  it down by gentle force, and repeated his question,</p>

  <p>"Will you?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word of it, Paul. Do you think me so foolish?"</p>

  <p>"Then I will&mdash;one day, but not now. Meanwhile, let us go seek for
  her."</p>

  <p>And, passing his arm around her slender waist, he led her gently from the
  scene of so many doubts and fears, of so much happiness.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch116"
     name="ch116"></a>XVI. &mdash; THE SENATE</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>Most potent, grave, and reverend Seniors.</i>
     &mdash;Othello.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE second morning had arrived, after that regularly
  appointed for the Consular elections.</p>

  <p>No tumult had occurred, nor any overt act to justify the apprehensions of
  the people; yet had those apprehensions in no wise abated. The very
  indistinctness of the rumored terror perhaps increased its weight; and so
  wide-spread was the vague alarm, so prevalent the dread and excitement, that
  in the haggard eyes and pale faces of the frustrated conspirators, there was
  little, if anything, to call attention; for whose features wore their natural
  expression, during those fearful days, each moment of which might bring forth
  massacre and conflagration? Whose, but the great Consul's?</p>

  <p>The second morning had arrived; and the broad orb of the newly risen sun,
  lurid and larger than his wont, as it struggled through the misty haze of the
  Italian autumn, had scarcely gained sufficient altitude to throw its beams
  over the woody crest of the Esquiline into the hollow of the Sacred Way.</p>

  <p>The slant light fell, however, full on the splendid terraces and shrines
  of the many-templed Palatine, playing upon their stately porticoes, and
  tipping their rich capitals with golden lustre.</p>

  <p>And at that early hour, the ancient hill was thronged with busy
  multitudes.</p>

  <p>The crisis was at hand&mdash;the Senate was in solemn session. The knights
  were gathered in their force, all armed. The younger members of the patrician
  houses were mustered with their clients. The fasces of the lictors displayed
  the broad heads of the axes glittering above the rods, which bound
  them&mdash;the axes, never borne in time of peace, or within the city walls,
  save upon strange emergency.</p>

  <p>In the old temple of Jupiter Stator, chosen on this occasion for the
  strength of its position, standing on the very brink of the steep declivity
  of the hill where it overlooked the great Roman forum, that grand assembly
  sate in grave deliberation.</p>

  <p>The scene was worthy of the actors, as were the actors of the strange
  tragedy in process.</p>

  <p>It was the cella, or great circular space of the inner temple. The brazen
  doors of this huge hall, facing the west, as was usual in all Roman temples,
  were thrown open; and without these, on the portico, yet so placed that they
  could hear every word that passed within the building, sat on their benches,
  five on each side of the door, the ten tribunes(19) of the people.</p>

  <p class="footnote">19. The Tribunes of the people were, at this period of
  the Republic, Senators; the Atinian law, the date of which is not exactly
  fixed, having undoubtedly come into operation soon after B. C. 130. I do not,
  however, find it mentioned, that their seats were thereupon transferred into
  the body of the Senate; and I presume that such was not the case; as they
  were not real senators, but had only the right of speaking without voting, as
  was the case with all who sat by the virtue of their offices, without regular
  election.</p>

  <p>Within the great space, surrounded by a double peristyle of tall Tuscan
  columns, and roofed by a vast dome, richly carved and gilded, but with a
  circular opening at the summit, through which a flood of light streamed down
  on the assembled magnates, the Senate was in session.</p>

  <p>Immediately facing the doors stood the old Statue of the God, as old, it
  was believed by some, as the days of Romulus, with the high altar at its
  base, hung round with votive wreaths, and glittering with ornaments of
  gold.</p>

  <p>Around this altar were grouped the augurs, each clad, as was usual on
  occasions of high solemnity, in his <i>trabea</i>, or robe of horizontal
  stripes, in white and purple; each holding in his hand his <i>lituus</i>, a
  crooked staff whereby to designate the temples of the heaven, in which to
  observe the omens.</p>

  <p>On every side of the circumference, except that occupied by the altar and
  the idol, were ranged in circular state the benches of the order.</p>

  <p>Immediately to the right of the altar, were placed the curule chairs, rich
  with carved ivory and crimson cushions, of the two consuls; and behind them,
  erect, with their shouldered axes, stood the stout lictors.</p>

  <p>Cicero, as the first chosen of the consuls, sat next the statue of the
  God; calm in his outward mien, as the severe and placid features of the
  marble deity, although within him the soul labored mightily, big with the
  fate of Rome. Next him Antonius, a stout, bold, sensual-looking soldier,
  filled his place&mdash;worthily, indeed, so far as stature, mien, and bearing
  were concerned; but with a singular expression in his eye, which seemed to
  indicate embarrassment, perhaps apprehension.</p>

  <p>After these, the presiding officers of the Republic, were present, each
  according to his rank, the conscript fathers&mdash;first, the Prince of the
  Senate, and then the Consulars, Censorians, and Praetorians, down to those
  who had filled the lowest office of the state, that of Quaestor, which gave
  its occupant, after his term of occupancy expired, admission to the grand
  representative assembly of the commonwealth.</p>

  <p>For much as there has been written on all sides of this subject, there now
  remains no doubt that, from the earliest to the latest age of Rome, the
  Senate was strictly, although an aristocratical, still an elective
  representative assembly.</p>

  <p>The Censors, themselves, elected by the Patricians out of their own order,
  in the assembly of the Curiae, had the appointment of the Senators; but from
  those only who had filled one of the magistracies, all of which were
  conferred by the popular vote of the assembly of the centuries; and all of
  which, at this period of the Republic, might be, and sometimes were,
  conferred on Plebeians&mdash;as in the case of Marius, six times elected
  Consul in spite of Patrician opposition.</p>

  <p>Such was the constitution of the Senate, purely elective, though like all
  other portions of the Roman constitution, under such checks and balances as
  were deemed sufficient to ensure it from becoming a democratical
  assembly.</p>

  <p>And such, in fact, it never did become. For having been at first an
  elective body chosen from an hereditary aristocracy, it was at that time,
  save in the varying principles of individuals, wholly aristocratic in its
  nature. Nor, after the tenure of the various magistracies, which conferred
  eligibility to the Senate, was thrown open to the plebeians, did any great
  change follow; since the preponderance of patrician influence in the assembly
  of the centuries, and the force perhaps of old habit, combined to continue
  most of the high offices of state in the hands of members of the Old Houses.
  Again, when plebeians were raised to office, and became, as they were styled,
  New Men, they speedily were merged in the nobility; and were no less
  aristocratic in their measures, than the oldest members of the
  aristocracy.</p>

  <p>For when have plebeians, anywhere, when elevated to superior rank, been
  true to their origin; been other than the fellest persecutors of
  plebeians?</p>

  <p>The senate was therefore still, as it had been, a calm and conservative
  assembly.</p>

  <p>It was not indeed, what it had been, before Marius first, and then Sylla,
  the avenger, had decimated it of their foes with the sword; and filled the
  vacancies with unworthy friends and partizans.</p>

  <p>Yet it was still a grand, a wise, a noble body&mdash;when viewed as a
  body&mdash;and, for the most part, its decisions were worthy of its dignity
  and power&mdash;were sage, conservative, and patriotic.</p>

  <p>On this occasion, all motives had conspired to produce a full house;
  doubt, anger, fear, excitement, curiosity, the love of country, the strong
  sense of right, the fiery impulses of interest, hate, vengeance, had urged
  all men of all parties, to be participants in the eventful business of the
  day.</p>

  <p>About five hundred senators were present; men of all ages from thirty-two
  years(20) upward&mdash;that being the earliest at which a man could fill this
  eminent seat. But the majority were of those, who having passed the prime of
  active life, might be considered to have reached the highest of mental power
  and capacity, removed alike from the greenness of inconsiderate youth, and
  the imbecility of extreme old age.</p>

  <p class="footnote">20. The age of senatorial eligibility is nowhere
  distinctly named. But the quaestorship, the lowest office which gave
  admission to the Curia, required the age of thirty-one in its occupant.</p>

  <p>The rare beauty of the Italian race&mdash;the strength and symmetry of the
  unrivalled warrior nation, of which these were, for the most part, the
  noblest and most striking specimens; the grand flow of the snow-white
  draperies, faced with the broad crimson laticlave&mdash;the classic grace of
  their positions&mdash;the absence of all rigid angular lines, of anything
  mean or meagre, fantastic or tawdry in the garb of the solemn concourse,
  rendered the meeting of Rome's Fathers a widely different spectacle from the
  convention of any other representative assembly, the world has ever
  witnessed.</p>

  <p>There was no flippancy, no affectation, no light converse&mdash;The
  members, young or old, had come thither to perform a great duty, in strength
  of purpose, singleness of spirit&mdash;and all felt deeply the weight of the
  present moment, the vastness of the interests concerned. The good and the
  true were there convened to defend the majesty, perhaps the safety, of their
  country&mdash;the wicked to strive for interest, for revenge, for life
  itself!</p>

  <p>For Catiline well knew, and had instilled his knowledge carefully into the
  minds of his confederates, that now to conquer was indeed to triumph; that
  now to be defeated was to fail, probably, forever&mdash;to die, it was most
  like, by the dread doom of the Tarpeian.</p>

  <p>Not one of the conspirators but was in his appointed place, firm,
  seemingly unconscious, and unruffled; and as the eye of the great consul
  glanced from one to another of that guilty throng, he could not, even amid
  his detestation of their crimes, but admire the cool hardihood with which
  they sat unmoved on the brink of destruction; could not but think, within
  himself, how vast the good that might be wrought by such resolution, under a
  virtuous leader, and in an upright cause. Catiline noticed the glance; and as
  he marked it run along the crowded benches, dwelling a moment on the face of
  each one of his own confederates, he saw in an instant, that all was
  discovered; and, as he saw, resolved that since craft had failed to conceal,
  henceforth he would trust audacity alone to carry out his detected
  villainy.</p>

  <p>But now the augurs had performed their rites; the day was pronounced
  fortunate; the assembly formal; and nothing more remained, but to proceed to
  the business of the moment.</p>

  <p>A little pause ensued, after the sanction of the augurs had been given; a
  short space, during which each man drew a deep breath, as though he were
  aware that ere long he should hear words spoken, that would thrill his every
  nerve with excitement, and hold him breathless with awe and apprehension.</p>

  <p>There was not a voice, not a motion, not the rustling of a garment,
  through the large building; for every living form was mute, as the marble
  effigies around them, with intense expectation.</p>

  <p>Every eye of conspirator, or patriot, was riveted upon the consul, the new
  man of Arpinum.</p>

  <p>He rose, not unobservant of the general expectation, nor ungratified; for
  that great man, with all his grand genius, solid intellect, sound virtue, had
  one small miserable weakness; he was not proud, but vain; vain beyond the
  feeblest and most craving vanity of womanhood.</p>

  <p>Yet now he showed it not&mdash;perhaps felt it, in a less degree than
  usual; it might be, it was crushed within him for the time, by the magnitude
  of vast interests, the consciousness of right motives, the necessity of
  extraordinary efforts.</p>

  <p>He rose; advanced a step or two, in front of his curule chair, and in a
  clear slow voice gave utterance to the solemn words, which formed the
  exordium to all senatorial business.</p>

  <p>"May this be good, and of good omen, happy, and fortunate to the Roman
  people, the Quirites; which now I lay before you, Fathers, and Conscript
  Senators."</p>

  <p>He paused, emphatically, with the formula; and then raising his voice a
  little, and turning his eyes slowly round the house, as if in mute appeal to
  all the senators.</p>

  <p>"For that," he said, "on which you must this day determine, concerns not
  the majesty or magnitude of Rome&mdash;the question is not now of insolent
  foes to be chastised, or of faithful friends to be rewarded&mdash;is not, how
  the city shall be made more beautiful, the state more proud and noble, the
  empire more enduring. No, conscript fathers; for the round world has never
  seen a city, so flourishing in all rare beauty, so decorated with the virtue
  of her living citizens, so noble in the memories of her dead heroes&mdash;the
  sun has never shone upon a state, so solidly established; upon an empire so
  majestical and mighty; extending from the Herculean columns, the far limits
  of the west, beyond the blue Symplegades; from Hyperborean snows, to the
  parched sands of Ethiopia!&mdash;no! Conscript Fathers, for we have no foes
  unsubdued, from the wild azure-tinctured hordes of Gaul to the swart Eunuchs
  of the Pontic king&mdash;for we have no friends unrewarded, unsheltered by
  the wings of our renown.</p>

  <p>"No! it is not to beautify, to stablish, to augment&mdash;but to preserve
  the empire, that I now call upon you; that I now urge you, by all that is
  sweet, is sacred, is sublime in the name of our country; that I implore you,
  by whatever earth contains of most awful, and heaven of most holy!</p>

  <p>"I said to preserve it! And do you ask from whom? Is there a Gallic
  tumult? Have Cimbric myriads again scaled the Alps, and poured their famished
  deluge over our devastated frontiers? Hath Mithridates trodden on the neck of
  Pompey? By the great gods! hath Carthage revived from her ashes? is Hannibal,
  or a greater one than Hannibal, again thundering at our gates, with Punic
  engines visible from the Janiculum?</p>

  <p>"If it were so, I should not despair of Rome&mdash;my heart would not
  throb, as it now does, nor my voice tremble with anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Cisalpine Gaul is tranquil as the vale of Arno! No bow is bended in the
  Teutonic forests, unless against the elk or urus! The legions have not turned
  their backs before the scymetars of Pontus! The salt sown in the market-place
  of Carthage hath borne no crop, but desolation. The one-eyed conqueror is
  nerveless in the silent grave!</p>

  <p>"But were all these, now peaceful, subjugated, lifeless, were all these, I
  say, in arms, victorious, present, upon this soil of Italy, around these
  walls of Rome, I should doubt nothing, fear nothing, expect nothing, but
  present strife, and future victory!</p>

  <p>"There is&mdash;there is, that spark of valor, that clear light of Roman
  virtue, alive in every heart; yea! even of our maids and matrons, that they
  would brook no hostile step even upon the threshold of our empire!</p>

  <p>"What then do I foresee? what fear?
  Massacre&mdash;parricide&mdash;conflagration&mdash;treason! Treason in Rome
  itself&mdash;in the Forum&mdash;in the Campus&mdash;<i>here!</i> Here in this
  holiest and safest spot! Here in the shrine of that great God, who, ages
  since, when this vast Rome was but a mud-built hamlet, that golden capitol, a
  straw-thatched shed, rolled back the tide of war, and stablished here, here,
  where my foot is fixed, the immortal seat of empire!</p>

  <p>"Even now as I turn my eyes around me they fall abhorrent on the faces,
  they read indignant the designs, of their country's parricides!</p>

  <p>"Aye! Conscript Fathers, praetorians, patricians of the great old houses,
  I see them in their places here; ready to vote immediately on their own
  monstrous schemes! I see them here, adulterers, forgers of wills, assassins,
  spendthrifts, poisoners, defilers of vestal virgins, contemners of the Gods,
  parricides of the Republic! I see them, with daggers sharpened against all
  true Romans, lurking beneath their fringed and perfumed tunics! Misled by
  strange ambition, maddened with lust, drunk with despairing guilt, athirst
  for the blood of citizens!</p>

  <p>"I see them! you all see them! Will you await in coward apathy, until they
  shake you from your lethargy&mdash;until the outcries of your murdered
  children, of your ravished wives arouse you, until you awake from your sleep
  and find Rome in ashes?</p>

  <p>"You hear me&mdash;you gaze on me in wonder, you ask me with your eyes
  what it is that I mean I who are the traitors? Lend me your ears then, and
  fix well your minds, lest they shrink in disgust and wonder. Lend me your
  ears only, and I fear not that you will determine, worthily of yourselves,
  and of the Republic!</p>

  <p>"You all well know that on the 16th day before the calends of November,
  which should have been the eve of the consular Elections, I promised that I
  would soon lay before you ample proofs of the plot, which then I foretold to
  you but darkly.</p>

  <p>"Mark, now, the faces of the men I shall address, and judge whether I then
  promised vainly; whether what I shall now disclose craves your severe
  attention&mdash;your immediate action."</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment, as if to note the effect of his words; then
  turning round abruptly upon the spot, where Catiline sat, writhing with rage
  and impatience, and gnawing his nether lip, until the blood trickled down his
  chin, he flung forth his arm with an indignant gesture, and instantly
  addressed him by his name, in tones that rang beneath the vaulted roof, over
  the heads of the self-convicted traitors, like heaven's own thunder, and
  found a fearful echo in their dismayed and guilty souls.</p>

  <p>"Where wert thou, Catiline?" he thundered forth the charge, amid the mute
  astonishment of all&mdash;"Where wert thou on the evening of the Ides? what
  wert thou doing? Speak! Unless guilt and despair hold thee silent, I say to
  thee, speak, Catiline!"</p>

  <p>Again he stopped in mid-speech, as if for an answer, fixed his eye
  steadily on the face of the arch conspirator. But he, though he spoke not to
  reply, quailed not, nor shunned that steady gaze, but met it with a terrible
  and portentous glare, pregnant with more than mortal hatred.</p>

  <p>"Thou wilt not&mdash;can'st not&mdash;darest not! Now hear and tremble!
  Hear, and know that no step of thine, or deed, or motion escapes my
  eye&mdash;no, traitor, not one movement!</p>

  <p>"On the eve of the Ides, thou wert in the street of the Scythemakers! Ha!
  does thy cheek burn now? In the house of a senator&mdash;of Marcus Porcius
  Laeca. But thou wert not there, till thou hadst added one more deed of murder
  to those which needed no addition. Thou wert, I say, in the house of Laeca;
  and many whom I now see around me, with trim and well-curled beards, with
  long-sleeved tunics and air-woven togas, many whom I could name, and will, if
  needs be, were there with thee!</p>

  <p>"What beverage didst thou send around? what oath didst thou administer,
  thou to thy foul associates? and on the altar of what God?</p>

  <p>"Fathers, my mind shrinks, as I speak, with horror&mdash;that bowl mantled
  to the brim with the gore of a human victim; those lips reeked with that
  dread abomination! His lips, and those of others, fitter to sip voluptuous
  nectar from the soft mouths of their noble paramours than to quaff such
  pollution!</p>

  <p>"That oath was to destroy Rome, utterly, with fire and the sword, till not
  one stone should stand upon another, to mark the site of empire!</p>

  <p>"The silver eagle was the god to whom he swore! The silver eagle, whose
  wings were dyed so deep in massacre by Marius&mdash;to whom he had a shrine
  in his own house, consecrated by what crimes, adored by what sacrilege, I say
  not!</p>

  <p>"The consular election was the day fixed; and, had the people met on that
  day in the Campus, on that day had Rome ceased to be!</p>

  <p>"To murder me in my robes of peace, at the Comitia, to murder the consuls
  elect, to murder the patricians to a man, was his own task, most congenial to
  his own savage nature!</p>

  <p>"To fire the city in twelve several places was destined to his worthy
  comrades, whose terror my eye now beholds, whose names for the present my
  tongue shall not disclose. For I would give them time to repent, to change
  their frantic purpose, to cast away their sin&mdash;oh! that they would do
  so! oh! that they would have compassion on their prostrate and imploring
  country&mdash;compassion on themselves&mdash;on me, who beseech them to turn
  back, ere it be too late, to the ways of virtue, happiness, and honor!</p>

  <p>"But names there are, which I will speak out, for to conceal them would
  avail nothing, since they have drawn the sword already, and raised the banner
  of rebellion against the majesty of Rome.</p>

  <p>"Septimius of Camerinum has stirred the slaves even now to a fresh servile
  war! has given out arms! has appointed leaders! by the Gods! has a force on
  foot in the Picene district! Julius is soliciting the evil spirits of Apulia;
  and, ere four days have flown, you shall have tidings from the north, that
  Caius Manlius is in arms at Faesulae. Already he commands more than two
  legions; not of raw levies, not of emancipated slaves, or enfranchised
  gladiators&mdash;though these ere long will swell his host. No! Sylla's
  veterans muster under his banner&mdash;the same swords gleam around him which
  conquered the famed Macedonian phalanx at bloody Chaeronea, which stormed the
  long walls of Piraeus, which won Bithynia, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia, which
  drove great Mithridates back to his own Pontus!</p>

  <p>"Nor is this all&mdash;for, if frustrated by the postponement of the
  consular comitia, believe not that the rage of the parricide is averted, or
  his thirst for the blood of Romans quenched forever.</p>

  <p>"No, Fathers, he hath but deferred the day; and even now he hath
  determined on another. The fifth before the calends! Await that day in quiet,
  and ye will never rue your apathy. For none of you shall live to rue it, save
  those who now smile grimly, conscious of their own desperate resolve,
  expectant of your apathy.</p>

  <p>"Nor is his villainy all told, even now; for so securely and so wisely has
  he laid his plans, that, had not the great Gods interfered and granted it to
  me to discover all, he must needs have succeeded! On the night of the calends
  themselves he would have been the master of Praeneste, that rich and
  inaccessible strong-hold, by a nocturnal escalade! That I myself have already
  made impossible&mdash;the magistrates are warned, the free burghers armed,
  and the castle garrisoned by true men, and impregnable.</p>

  <p>"Do ye the like, Fathers and Conscript Senators, and Rome also shall be
  safe, inaccessible, immortal. Give me the powers to save you, and I devote my
  mind, my life. I am here ready to die at this instant&mdash;far worse than
  death to a noble mind, ready to go hence, and be forgotten, if I may rescue
  Rome from this unequalled peril!"</p>

  <p>Again, he ceased speaking for a moment, and many thought that he had
  concluded his oration; but in a second's space he resumed, in a tone more
  spirited and fiery yet, his eyes almost flashing lightning, and his whole
  frame appearing to expand, as he confronted the undaunted traitor.</p>

  <p>"Dost thou not now see, Catiline, that in all things thou art my inferior?
  Dost thou not feel thyself caught, detected like a thief? baffled? defeated?
  beaten? and wilt thou not now lay down thine arms, thy rage, thy hate,
  against this innocent republic? wilt thou not liberate me now from great
  fear, great peril, and great odium?</p>

  <p>"No! thou wilt not&mdash;the time hath flown! thou canst not
  repent&mdash;canst not forgive, or be forgiven&mdash;the Gods have maddened
  thee to thy destruction&mdash;thy crimes are full-blown, and ripening fast
  for harvest&mdash;earth is aweary of thy guilt&mdash;Hades yawns to receive
  thee!</p>

  <p>"Tremble, then, tremble! Yea! in the depths of thy secret soul&mdash;for
  all thine eye glares more with hate than terror, and thy lip quivers, not
  with remorse but rage&mdash;yea! thou dost tremble&mdash;for thou dost see,
  feel, know, thy schemes, thy confederates, thyself, detected, frustrated,
  devoted to destruction!</p>

  <p>"Enough! It is for you, my Fathers, to determine; for me to act your
  pleasure. And if your own souls, your own lives, your own interests, yea!
  your own fears, cry not aloud to rouse you, with a voice stronger than the
  eternal thunder, why should I seek to warn you? Whom his own, his wife's,
  children's, country's safety, the glory of his great forefathers, the
  veneration of the everlasting Gods awaiting his decision from the tottering
  pinnacle of Rome's capitol&mdash;whom all these things excite not to
  action&mdash;no voice of man, no portent of the Gods themselves can stir to
  energy or valor; and I but waste my words in exhorting you to manhood!</p>

  <p>"But they <i>will</i> burst the bonds of your long stupor; they
  <i>will</i> re-kindle, in your hearts, that blaze of Roman virtue, which may
  sleep for a while, but never can be all extinguished!&mdash;and ye
  <i>will</i> stir yourselves like men; ye <i>will</i> save your country! For
  this thing I do not believe; that the immortal Gods would have built up this
  commonwealth of Rome to such a height of beauty, of glory, of puissance, had
  they foredoomed it to destruction, by hands so base as those now armed
  against it. Nor, had it been their pleasure to abolish its great name, and
  make it such as Troy and Carthage, would they have placed me here, the
  consul, endowed by themselves with power to discern, but with no power to
  avert destruction!"</p>

  <p>His words had done their work. The dismayed blank faces of all the
  conspirators, with the exception of the arch traitor only, whom it would seem
  that nothing could disconcert or dismay, confirmed the impression made upon
  all minds by that strong appeal. For, though he had mentioned no man's name
  save Catiline's and Laeca's only, suspicion was called instantly to those who
  were their known associates in riot and debauchery; and many eyes were
  scrutinizing the pale features, which struggled vainly to appear calm and
  unconcerned.</p>

  <p>The effect of the speech was immediate, universal. There were not three
  men of the order present who were not now convinced as fully in their own
  minds of the truth of Cicero's accusation, as they would, had it come forth
  in thunder from the cold lips of the marble God, who overlooked their proud
  assembly.</p>

  <p>There was a long drawn breath, as he ceased speaking&mdash;one, and
  simultaneous through the whole concourse; and, though there were a few men
  there, Crassus, especially, and Caius Julius Caesar, who, though convinced of
  the existence of conspiracy, would fain have defended the conspirators, in
  the existing state of feeling, they dared not attempt to do so.</p>

  <p>Then Cicero called by name on the Prince of the Senate, enquiring if he
  would speak on the subject before the house, and on receiving from him a
  grave negative gesture, he put the same question to the eldest of the
  consulars, and thence in order, none offering any opinion or showing any wish
  to debate, until he came to Marcus Cato. He rose at once to speak, stern and
  composed, without the least sign of animation on his impassive face, without
  the least attempt at eloquence in his words, or grace in his gestures; yet it
  was evident that he was heard with a degree of attention, which proved that
  the character of the man more than compensated the unvarnished style and
  rough phraseology of the speaker.</p>

  <p>"As it appears to me," he said, "Fathers and Conscript Senators, after the
  very luminous and able oration which our wise consul has this day held forth,
  it would be great folly, and great loss of time, to add many words to it.
  This I am not about to do, I assure you, but I arise in my place to say two
  things. Cicero has told you that a conspiracy exists, and that Catiline is
  the planner, and will be the executor of it. This, though I know not by what
  sagacity or foresight, unless from the Gods, he discovered it&mdash;this, I
  say, I believe confidently, clearly&mdash;all things declare it&mdash;not
  least the faces of men! I believe therefore, every word our consul has
  spoken; so do you all, my friends. Nevertheless, it is just and right, that
  the man, villain as he may be, shall be heard in his own behalf. Let him then
  speak at once, or confess by his silence! This is the first thing I would
  say&mdash;the next follows it! If he admit, or fail clearly to disprove his
  guilt, let us not be wanting to ourselves, to our country, or to the great
  and prudent consul, who, if man can, will save us in this crisis. Let us, I
  say, decree forthwith, 'THAT THE CONSULS SEE THE REPUBLIC TAKES NO HARM!' and
  let us hold the consular election to-morrow, on the field of
  Mars&mdash;There, with our magistrates empowered to act, our clients in arms
  to defend us, let us see who will dare to disturb the Roman people! Let who
  would do so, remember that not all the power or favor of Great Marius could
  rescue Saturninus from the death he owed the people&mdash;remember that we
  have a consul no less resolute and vigorous, than he is wise and
  good&mdash;that there are axes in the fasces of the Lictors&mdash;that there
  stands the Tarpeian!"</p>

  <p>And as he spoke, he flung wide both his arms; pointing with this hand to
  the row of glittering blades which shone above the head of the chief
  magistrate, with that, through the open door-way of the temple, to the bold
  front of the precipitous and fatal rock, all lighted up by the gay sunbeams,
  as it stood fronting them, beyond the hollow Velabrum, crowned with the
  ramparts of the capitol.</p>

  <p>A general hum, as if of assent, followed, and without putting the motion
  to the vote, Cicero turned his eye rapidly to every face, and receiving from
  every senator a slight nod of assent, he looked steadily in the fierce and
  ghastly face of the traitor, and said to him;</p>

  <p>"Arise, Catiline, and speak, if you will!&mdash;But take my counsel,
  confess your guilt, go hence, and be forgiven!"</p>

  <p>"Forgiven!" cried the traitor, furious and
  desperate&mdash;"Forgiven!&mdash;this to a Roman citizen!&mdash;this to a
  Roman noble! Hear me, Fathers and Conscript Senators&mdash;hear me!&mdash;who
  am a soldier and a man, and neither driveller nor dotard. I tell you, there
  is no conspiracy, hath been none, shall be none&mdash;save in the addled
  brains of yon prater from Arpinum, who would fain set his foot upon the neck
  of Romans. All is, all shall be peace in Rome, unless the terror of a few
  dastards drive you to tyranny and persecution, and from persecution come
  resistance? For myself, let them who would ruin me, beware. My hand has never
  yet failed to protect my head, nor have many foes laughed in the end at
  Sergius Catiline!&mdash;unless," he added with a ferocious sneer&mdash;"they
  laughed in their death-pang. For my wrongs past, I have had some vengeance;
  for these, though I behold the axes, though I see, whence I stand, the steep
  Tarpeian, I think I shall have more, and live to feast my eyes with the
  downfall of my foes. Fathers, there are two bodies in the State, one weak,
  with a base but crafty head&mdash;the other powerful and vast, but headless.
  Urge me a little farther, and you shall find that a wise and daring head will
  not be wanting long, to that bold and puissant body. Urge me, and I will be
  that head; oppress me, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But insolence such as this, was not tolerable. There was an universal
  burst, almost a shout, of indignation from that assembly, the wonted mood of
  which was so stern, so cold, so gravely dignified, and silent. Many among the
  younger senators sprang to their feet, enraged almost beyond the control of
  reason; nor did the bold defiance of the daring traitor, who stood with his
  arms folded on his breast, and a malignant sneer of contempt on his lip,
  mocking their impotent displeasure, tend to disarm their wrath.</p>

  <p>Four times he raised his voice, four times a cry of indignation drowned
  his words, and at length, seeing that he could obtain no farther hearing, he
  resumed his seat with an expression fiendishly malignant, and a fierce
  imprecation on Rome, and all that it contained.</p>

  <p>After a little time, the confusion created by the audacity of that strange
  being moderated; order and silence were restored, and, upon Cato's motion,
  the Senate was divided.</p>

  <p>Whatever might have been the result had Catiline been silent, the majority
  was overwhelming. The very partisans and favorers of the conspiracy, not
  daring to commit themselves more openly, against so strong a manifestation,
  passed over one by one, and voted with the consul.</p>

  <p>Catiline stood alone, against the vote of the whole order. Yet stood and
  voted resolute, as though he had been conscious of the right.</p>

  <p>The vote was registered, the Senate declared martial law, investing the
  consuls with dictatorial power, by the decree which commanded them to SEE
  THAT THE REPUBLIC TAKES NO HARM.</p>

  <p>The very tribunes, factious and reckless as they were, potent for ill and
  powerless for good, presumed not to interpose. Not even Lucius Bestia, deep
  as he was in the design&mdash;Bestia, whose accusation of the consul from the
  rostrum was the concerted signal for the massacre, the
  conflagration&mdash;not Bestia himself, relied so far on the inviolability of
  his person, as to intrude his VETO.</p>

  <p>The good cause had prevailed&mdash;the good Consul triumphed! The Senate
  was dismissed, and as the stream of patrician togas flowed through the temple
  door conspicuous, the rash and reckless traitor shouldered the mass to and
  fro, dividing it as a brave galley under sail divides the murmuring but
  unresisting billows.</p>

  <p>Once in the throng he touched Julius Caesar's robe as he brushed onward,
  and as he did so, a word fell on his ear in the low harmonious tones which
  marked the orator, second to none in Rome, save Cicero alone!&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Fear not," it said&mdash;"another day will come!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fear!&mdash;" exclaimed the Conspirator in a hoarse cry, half fury, half
  contempt. "What is fear?&mdash;I know not the thing, nor the word!&mdash;Go,
  prate of fear to Cicero, and he will understand you!"</p>

  <p>These words perhaps alienated one who might have served him well.</p>

  <p>But so it ever is! Even in the shrewdest and most worldly wise of men,
  passion will often outweigh interest; and plans, which have been framed for
  years with craft and patience, are often wrecked by the impetuous rashness of
  a moment.</p>

  <h2><a id="bk2"
     name="bk2"></a>BOOK II</h2>

  <h2><a id="ch201"
     name="ch201"></a>I. &mdash; THE OLD PATRICIAN</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>A Roman father of the olden time.</i>
     &mdash;MS. Play.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IN a small street, not far from the Sacred Way and the Roman
  Forum, there was a large house, occupying the whole of one <i>insula</i>, as
  the space contained between four intersecting streets was called by the
  ancients.</p>

  <p>But, although by its great size and a certain rude magnificence, arising
  from the massy stone-work of its walls, and the solemn antiquity of the old
  Oscan columns which adorned its entrance, it might be recognised at once as
  the abode of some Patrician family; it was as different in many respects from
  the abodes of the aristocracy of that day, as if it had been erected in a
  different age and country.</p>

  <p>It had no stately colonnades of foreign marbles, no tesselated pavement to
  the vestibule, no glowing frescoes on the walls, no long lines of exterior
  windows, glittering with the new luxury of glass. All was decorous, it is
  true; but all, at the same time, was stern, and grave, and singular for its
  antique simplicity.</p>

  <p>On either hand of the entrance, there was, in accordance with the custom
  of centuries long past, when Rome's Consulars were tillers of the ground, a
  large shop with an open front, devoted to the sale of the produce of the
  owner's farm. And, strange to say, although the custom had been long disused
  in these degenerate times, it seemed that the owner of this time-honored
  mansion adhered sturdily to the ancient usage of his race.</p>

  <p>For, in one of these large cold unadorned vaults, a tall grayheaded slave,
  a rural laborer, as it required no second glance to perceive, was presiding
  over piles of cheese, stone-jars of honey, baskets of autumn fruits, and
  sacks of grain, by the red light of a large smoky flambeau; while a younger
  man, who from his resemblance to the other might safely be pronounced his
  son, was keeping an account of the sales by a somewhat complicated system of
  tallies.</p>

  <p>In the other apartment, two youths, slaves likewise from the suburban or
  rustic farm, were giving samples, to such as wished to buy, of different
  qualities of wine from several amphora or earthen pitchers, which stood on a
  stone counter forming the sill of the low-browed window.</p>

  <p>It was late in the evening already, and the streets were rapidly growing
  dark; yet there were many passengers abroad, more perhaps than was usual at
  that hour; and now and then, a little group would form about one or the other
  of the windows, cheapening and purchasing provisions, and chatting for a few
  minutes, after their business was finished, with their gossips.</p>

  <p>These groups were composed altogether of the lowest order of the free
  citizens of Rome, artizans, and small shop keepers, and here and there a
  woman of low origin, or perhaps a slave, the house steward of some noble
  family, mingling half reluctantly with his superiors. For the time had not
  arrived, when the soft eunuchs of the East, and the bold bravoes of the
  heroic North, favorites and tools of some licentious lord, dared to insult
  the freeborn men of Rome, or gloried in the badges of their servitude.</p>

  <p>The conversation ran, as it was natural to expect, on the probable results
  of the next day's election; and it was a little remarkable, that among these,
  who should have been the supporters of the democratic faction, there appeared
  to be far more of alarm and of suspicion, concerning the objects of Catiline,
  than of enthusiasm for the popular cause.</p>

  <p>"He a man of the people, or the people's friend!" said an old
  grave-looking mechanic; "No, by the Gods! no more than the wolf is the friend
  of the sheepfold!"</p>

  <p>"He may hate the nobles," said another, "or envy the great rich houses;
  but he loves nothing of the people, unless it be their purses, if he can get
  a chance to squeeze them"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Or their daughters," interrupted a third, "if they be fair and
  willing"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Little cares he for their good-will," cried yet a fourth, "so they are
  young and handsome. It is but eight days since, that some of his gang carried
  off Marcus', the butcher's, bride, Icilia, on the night of her bridal. They
  kept her three days; and on the fourth sent her home dishonored, with a
  scroll, 'that she was <i>now</i> a fit wife for a butcher'!"</p>

  <p>"By the Gods!" exclaimed one or two of the younger men, "who was it did
  this thing?"</p>

  <p>"One of the people's friends!" answered the other, with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"The people have no friends, since Caius Marius died," said the deep voice
  of Fulvius Flaccus, as he passed casually through the crowd.</p>

  <p>"But what befel the poor Icilia?" asked an old matron, who had been
  listening with greedy sympathy to the dark tale.</p>

  <p>"Why, Marcus would yet have taken her to his bosom, seeing she had no
  share in the guilt; but she bore a heart too Roman to bring disgrace upon one
  she loved, or to survive her honor. Icilia <i>is</i> no longer."</p>

  <p>"She died like Lucretia!" said an old man, who stood near, with a clouded
  brow, which flashed into stormy light, as the same deep voice asked
  aloud,</p>

  <p>"Shall she be so avenged?"</p>

  <p>But the transient gleam faded instantly away, and the sad face was again
  blank and rayless, as he replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;for who should avenge her?"</p>

  <p>"The people! the people!" shouted several voices, for the mob was
  gathering, and growing angry&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The Roman People should avenge her!"</p>

  <p>"Tush!" answered Fulvius Flaccus. "There is no Roman people!"</p>

  <p>"And who are you," exclaimed two or three of the younger men, "that dare
  tell us so?"</p>

  <p>"The grandson," answered the republican, "of one, who, while there yet
  <i>was</i> a people, loved it"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"His name? his name?" shouted many voices.</p>

  <p>"He hath no name"&mdash;replied Fulvius. "He lost that, and his life
  together."</p>

  <p>"Lost them for the people?" inquired the old man, whom he had first
  addressed, and who had been scrutinizing him narrowly.</p>

  <p>"And <i>by</i> the people," answered the other. "For the people's cause;
  and by the people's treason!&mdash;as is the case," he added, half
  scornfully, half sadly, "with all who love the people."</p>

  <p>"Hear him, my countrymen," said the old man. "Hear him. If there be any
  one can save you, it is he. It is Fulvius, the son of Caius, the son of
  Marcus&mdash;Flaccus. Hear him, I say, if he will only lead you."</p>

  <p>"Lead us! speak to us! lead us!" shouted the fickle crowd. "Love us, good
  Fulvius, as your fathers did of old."</p>

  <p>"And die, for you, as they died!" replied the other, in a tone of
  melancholy sarcasm. "Hark you, my masters," he added, "there are none now
  against whom to lead you; and if there were, I think there would be none to
  follow. Keep your palms unsoiled by the base bribes of the nobles! Keep your
  ears closed to the base lies of the demagogues! Keep your hearts true and
  honest! Keep your eyes open and watchful! Brawl not, one with the other; but
  be faithful, as brethren should. Be grave, laborious, sober, and above all
  things humble, as men who once were free and great, and now, by their own
  fault, are fallen and degraded. Make yourselves fit to be led gloriously;
  and, when the time shall come, there will be no lack of glorious
  leaders!"</p>

  <p>"But to-morrow? what shall we do to-morrow?" cried several voices; but
  this time it was the elder men, who asked the question, "for whom shall we
  vote to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"For the friend of the people!" answered Flaccus.</p>

  <p>"Where shall we find him?" was the cry; "who is the friend of the
  people?"</p>

  <p>"Not he who would arm them, one against the other," he replied. "Not he,
  who would burn their workshops, and destroy their means of daily sustenance!
  Not he, by all the Gods! who sports with the honor of their wives, the
  virtue"&mdash;</p>

  <p>But he was interrupted here, by a stern sullen hum among his audience,
  increasing gradually to a fierce savage outcry. The mob swayed to and fro;
  and it was evident that something was occurring in the midst, by which it was
  tremendously excited.</p>

  <p>Breaking off suddenly in his speech, the democrat leaped on a large block
  of stone, standing at the corner of the large house in front of which the
  multitude was gathered, and looked out anxiously, if he might descry the
  cause of the tumult.</p>

  <p>Nor was it long ere he succeeded.</p>

  <p>A young man, tall and of a slender frame, with features singularly
  handsome, was making his way, as best he could, with unsteady steps, and a
  face haggard and pale with debauchery, through the tumultuous and angry
  concourse.</p>

  <p>His head, which had no other covering than its long curled and perfumed
  locks, was crowned with a myrtle wreath; he wore a long loose saffron-colored
  tunic richly embroidered, but ungirt, and flowing nearly to his ankles; and
  from the dress, and the torch-bearers, who preceded him, as well as from his
  wild eye and reeling gait, it was evident that he was returning from some
  riotous banquet.</p>

  <p>Fulvius instantly recognised him. It was a kinsman of his own, Aulus, the
  son of Aulus Fulvius, the noblest of the survivors of his house, a senator of
  the old school, a man of stern and rigid virtue, the owner of that grand
  simple mansion, beside the door of which he stood.</p>

  <p>But, though he recognised his cousin, he was at a loss for a while to
  discover the cause of the tumult; 'till, suddenly, a word, a female name,
  angrily murmured through the crowd, gave a clue to its meaning.</p>

  <p>"Icilia! Icilia!"</p>

  <p>Still, though the crowd swayed to and fro, and jostled, and shouted,
  becoming evidently more angry every moment, it made way for the young noble,
  who advanced fearlessly, with a sort of calm and scornful insolence,
  contemning the rage which his own vile deed had awakened.</p>

  <p>At length one of the mob, bolder than the rest, thrust himself in between
  the torch bearers and their lord, and meeting the latter face to face, cried
  out, so that all the crowd might hear,</p>

  <p>"Lo! Aulus Fulvius! the violator of Icilia! the friend of the people!"</p>

  <p>A loud roar of savage laughter followed; and then, encouraged by the
  applause of his fellows, the man added,</p>

  <p>"Vote for Aulus Fulvius, the friend of the people! vote for good Aulus,
  and his virtuous friend Catiline!"</p>

  <p>The hot blood flashed to the brow of the young noble, at the undisguised
  scorn of the plebeian's speech. Insolence he could have borne, but
  contempt!&mdash;and contempt from a plebeian!</p>

  <p>He raised his hand; and slight and unmuscular as he appeared, indignation
  lent such vigor to that effeminate arm, that the blow which he dealt him on
  the face, cast the burly mechanic headlong, with the blood spouting from his
  mouth and nostrils.</p>

  <p>A fearful roar of the mob, and a furious rush against the oppressor,
  followed.</p>

  <p>The torch-bearers fought for their master gallantly, with their tough
  oaken staves; and the young man showed his patrician blood by his patrician
  courage in the fray. Flaccus, too, wished and endeavored to interpose, not so
  much that he cared to shield his unworthy kinsman, as that he sought to
  preserve the energies of the people for a more noble trial. The multitude,
  moreover, impeded one another by their own violent impetuosity; and to this
  it was owing, more than to the defence of his followers, or the intercession
  of the popular Flaccus, that the young libertine was not torn to pieces, on
  the threshold of his own father's house.</p>

  <p>The matter, however, was growing very serious&mdash;stones, staves, and
  torches flew fast through the air&mdash;the crash of windows in the
  neighboring houses was answered by the roar of the increasing mob, and every
  thing seemed to portend a very dangerous tumult; when, at the same moment,
  the door of the Fulvian House was thrown open, and the high-crested helmets
  of a cohort were seen approaching, in a serried line, above the bare heads of
  the multitude.</p>

  <p>Order was restored very rapidly; for a pacific party had been rallying
  around Fulvius Flaccus, and their efforts, added to the advance of the
  levelled pila of the cohort, were almost instantly successful.</p>

  <p>Nor did the sight, which was presented by the opening door of the Fulvian
  mansion, lack its peculiar influence on the people.</p>

  <p>An old man issued forth, alone, from the unfolded portals.</p>

  <p>He was indeed extremely old; with hair as white as snow, and a long
  venerable beard falling in waves of silver far down upon his chest. Yet his
  eyebrows were black as night, and these, with the proud arch of his Roman
  nose, and the glance of his eagle eyes, untamed by time or hardship, almost
  denied the inference drawn from the white head and reverend chin.</p>

  <p>His frame, which must once have been unusually powerful and athletic, was
  now lean and emaciated; yet he held himself erect as a centennial pine on
  Mount Algidus, and stood as firmly on his threshold, looking down on the
  tumultuous concourse, which waved and fluctuated, like the smaller trees of
  the mountain side, beneath him.</p>

  <p>His dress was of the plain and narrow cut, peculiar to the good olden
  time; yet it had the distinctive marks of the senatorial rank.</p>

  <p>It was the virtuous, severe, old senator&mdash;the noblest, alas! soon to
  be the last, of his noble race.</p>

  <p>"What means this tumult?" he said in a deep firm sonorous voice,
  "Wherefore is it, that ye shout thus, and hurl stones about a friendly door!
  For shame! for shame! What is it that ye lack? Bread? Ye have had it ever at
  my hands, without seeking it thus rudely."</p>

  <p>"It is not bread, most noble Aulus, that we would have," cried the old
  man, who had made himself somewhat conspicuous before, "but vengeance!"</p>

  <p>"Vengeance, on whom, and for what?" exclaimed the noble Roman.</p>

  <p>But ere his question could be answered, the crowd opened before him, and
  his son stood revealed, sobered indeed by the danger he had run, but pale,
  haggard, bleeding, covered with mud and filth, and supported by one of his
  wounded slaves.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" cried the old man, starting back aghast, "What is this? What fresh
  crime? What recent infamy? What new pollution of our name?"</p>

  <p>"Icilia! Icilia! vengeance for poor Icilia!" cried the mob once again; but
  they now made no effort to inflict the punishment, for which they clamored;
  so perfect was their confidence in the old man's justice, even against his
  own flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>At the next moment a voice was heard, loud and clear as a silver trumpet,
  calling upon the people to disperse.</p>

  <p>It was the voice of Paullus, who now strode into the gap, left by the
  opening concourse, glittering in the full panoply of a decurion of the horse,
  thirty dismounted troopers arranging themselves in a glittering line behind
  him.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the soldiery, led by one whose face was familiar to him,
  the audacity of the young man revived; and turning round with a light laugh
  toward Arvina,</p>

  <p>"Here is a precious coil," he said, "my Paullus, about a poor plebeian
  harlot!"</p>

  <p>"I never heard that Icilia was such," replied the young soldier sternly,
  for the dark tale was but too well known; "nor must you look to me, Aulus
  Fulvius, for countenance in deeds like these, although it be my duty to
  protect you from violence! Come my friends," he continued, turning to the
  multitude, "You must disperse, at once, to your several homes; if any have
  been wronged by this man, he can have justice at the tribunal of the Praetor!
  But there must be no violence!"</p>

  <p>"Is this thing true, Aulus?" asked the old man, in tones so stern and
  solemn, that the youth hung his head and was silent.</p>

  <p>"Is this thing true?" the Senator repeated.</p>

  <p>"Why, hath he not confessed it?" asked the old man, who had spoken so many
  times before; and who had lingered with Fulvius Flaccus, and a few others of
  the crowd. "It is true."</p>

  <p>"Who art thou?" asked the old Patrician, a terrible suspicion crossing his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"The father of that daughter, whom thy son forcibly dishonored!"</p>

  <p>"Enter!" replied the senator, throwing the door, in front of which he
  stood, wide open, "thou shalt have justice!"</p>

  <p>Then, casting a glance full of sad but resolute determination upon the
  culprit, all whose audacity had passed away, he said in a graver tone,</p>

  <p>"Enter thou likewise; thou shalt have punishment!"</p>

  <p>"Punishment!" answered the proud youth, his eye flashing, "Punishment! and
  from whom?"</p>

  <p>"Punishment from thy father! wilt thou question it? Punishment, even unto
  death, if thou shalt be found worthy to die!&mdash;the law is not dead, if it
  have slept awhile! Enter!"</p>

  <p>He dared not to reply&mdash;he dared not to refuse. Slow, sullen, and
  crest-fallen, he crossed his father's threshhold; but, as he did so, he
  glared terribly on Paullus, and shook his hand at him, and cried in tones of
  deadly hatred,</p>

  <p>"This is thy doing! curses&mdash;curses upon thee! thou shalt rue it!"</p>

  <p>Arvina smiled in calm contempt of his impotent resentment.</p>

  <p>The culprit, the accuser, and the judge passed inward; the door closed
  heavily behind them; the crowd dispersed; the soldiery marched onward; and
  the street, in front of the Fulvian House, was left dark and silent.</p>

  <p>An hour perhaps had passed, when the door was again opened, and the aged
  plebeian, Icilia's father, issued into the dark street.</p>

  <p>"Scourged!" he cried, with a wild triumphant laugh, "Scourged, like a
  slave, at his own father's bidding! Rejoice, exult, Icilia! thy shame is half
  avenged!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch202"
     name="ch202"></a>II. &mdash; THE CONSULAR COMITIA</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>Your voices!</i> &mdash;Coriolanus.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE morning had at length arrived, big with the fate of
  Rome. The morning of the Consular elections.</p>

  <p>The sun shone broad and bright over the gorgeous city, and the wide green
  expanse of the field of Mars, whereon, from an hour before the first peep of
  dawn, the mighty multitude of Roman citizens had stood assembled.</p>

  <p>All the formalities had been performed successfully. The Consul Cicero,
  who had gone forth beyond the walls to take the auspices, accompanied by an
  augur, had declared the auguries favorable.</p>

  <p>The separate enclosures, with the bridges, as they were termed, across
  which the centuries must pass to give their votes, had been erected; the
  distributors of the ballots, and the guardians of the ballot-boxes, had been
  appointed.</p>

  <p>And now, as the sun rushed up with his crown of living glory into the
  cloudless arch of heaven, the brazen trumpets of the centuries pealed long
  and loud, calling the civic army to its ranks, in order to commence their
  voting.</p>

  <p>That was the awful moment; and scarce a breast was there, but beat high
  with hope or fear, or dark and vague anticipation.</p>

  <p>The Consul and the friends of order were, perhaps, calmer and more
  confident, than any others of that mighty concourse; for they were satisfied
  with their preparations; they were firm in the support of the patrician
  houses, and in the unanimity of the Roman knights conciliated by Cicero.</p>

  <p>Scarcely less confident were the conspirators; for with so much secrecy
  had the arrangements of the Consul been made, that although Catiline knew
  himself suspected, knew that his motives were perspicuous, and his measures
  in some sort anticipated, he yet believed that the time was propitious.</p>

  <p>He hoped, and believed as fully as he hoped, that Cicero and his party,
  content with the triumph they had obtained in the Senate, and with the
  adjudication by that body of dictatorial power to the consuls, were now
  deceived into the idea that the danger was already over.</p>

  <p>Still, his fierce heart throbbed violently; and there was a feeling of hot
  agonizing doubt blent with the truculent hope, the savage ambition, the
  strong thirst of blood, which goaded him almost to madness.</p>

  <p>From an early hour he had stood surrounded by his friends, the leaders of
  that awful faction, hard by the portico of the <i>diribitorium</i>, or pay-
  office, marking with a keen eye every group that entered the field of Mars,
  and addressing those, whom he knew friendly to his measures, with many a
  fiery word of greeting and encouragement.</p>

  <p>Cassius and Lentulus, a little way behind him, leaned against the columns
  of the gateway, with more than a thousand of the clients of their houses
  lounging about in groups, seemingly inattentive, but really alive to every
  word or glance of their leaders.</p>

  <p>These men were all armed secretly with breast plates, and the puissant
  Roman sword, beneath their peaceful togas.</p>

  <p>These men, well-trained in the wars of Sylla, hardy and brave, and acting
  in a body, were destined to commence the work of slaughter, by slaying the
  Great Consul, so soon as he should open the comitia.</p>

  <p>Cethegus had departed, already, to join his gladiators, who, to the number
  of fifteen hundred, were gathered beyond the Janiculum, ready to act upon the
  guard, and to beat down the standard which waved there, the signal of
  election.</p>

  <p>Statilius, Gabinius, and Caeparius, were ready with their armed households
  and insurgent slaves, prepared at a moment's notice to throw open the prison
  doors, and fire the city in twelve places.</p>

  <p>Fearless, unanimous, armed, and athirst for blood, the foes of the
  republic stood, and marked with greedy eyes and visages inflamed and fiery,
  their victims sweep through the gates, arrayed in their peaceful robes,
  unarmed, as it would seem, and unsuspecting.</p>

  <p>Not a guard was to be seen anywhere; not a symptom of suspicion; much less
  of preparation. The wonted cohort only was gathered about the standard on the
  bridge gate of the Janiculum; but even these bore neither shields, nor
  javelins; and sat or lounged about, unconcerned, and evidently off their
  guard.</p>

  <p>But the keen eye of Catiline, could mark the band of grey-tunicked
  Gladiators, mustered, and ready to assume the offensive at a moment's notice,
  though now they were sauntering about, or sitting down or lying in the shade,
  or chatting with the country girls and rustic slaves, who covered the sloping
  hill-sides of the Janiculum, commanding a full view of the Campus
  Martius.</p>

  <p>"The Fools!" muttered Catiline. "The miserable, God-deserted idiots! Does
  the man of Arpinum deem me then so weak, to be disarmed by an edict, quelled
  by a paltry proclamation?"</p>

  <p>Then, as the stout smith, Caius Crispus, passed by him, with a gang of
  workmen, and a rabble of the lowest citizens,</p>

  <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed, "hail, Crispus&mdash;hail, brave hearts!&mdash;all
  things look well for us to-day&mdash;well for the people! Your voices,
  friends; I must have your voices!"</p>

  <p>"You shall&mdash;Catiline!" replied the smith&mdash;"and our hands also!"
  he added, with a significant smile and a dark glance.</p>

  <p>"Catiline! Catiline&mdash;all friends of the good people, all foes of the
  proud patricians, give noble Catiline your voices!"</p>

  <p>"Catiline! Catiline for the persecuted people!" and, with a wild and
  stirring shout, the mob passed inward through the gate, leaving the smith
  behind, however; who stopped as if to speak with one of the Cornelian
  clients, but in reality to wait further orders.</p>

  <p>"When shall we march"&mdash;he asked, after a moment or two, stealthily
  approaching the chief conspirator. "Before they have called the prerogative
  century to vote, or when the knights are in the bridges?"</p>

  <p>"When the standard goes down, fool!" replied Catiline, harshly. "Do not
  you know your work?"</p>

  <p>At this moment, a party of young and dissipated nobles came swaggering
  along the road, with their ungirded tunics flowing down to their heels, their
  long sleeves fringed with purple falling as far as to their wrists, and their
  curled ringlets floating on their shoulders. Among them, with a bloodshot
  eye, a pale and haggard face, and a strange terrible expression, half-sullen,
  half-ashamed, on all his features, as if he fancied that his last night's
  disgrace was known to all men, strode Aulus Fulvius, the son of that stern
  senator.</p>

  <p>"Your voices! noblemen, your voices!" cried Catiline, laughing with
  feigned gayety&mdash;"Do but your work to-day, and to-night"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Wine and fair women!" shouted one; but Aulus smiled savagely, and darkly,
  and answered in one word "Revenge!"</p>

  <p>Next behind them, came Bassus, the veteran father of the dead
  eagle-bearer; he who had told so sad a tale of patrician cruelty to Fulvius
  Flaccus, in the forge.</p>

  <p>"Why, Bassus, my brave veteran, give me your hand," cried the conspirator,
  making a forward step to meet him. "For whom vote you to-day, for Muroena and
  Silanus? Ha?"</p>

  <p>"For Catiline and justice!" answered the old man, "justice on him who
  wronged the Eagle-bearer's child! who sits in the senate even yet, defiled
  with her pure blood!&mdash;the infamous Cornelius!"</p>

  <p>Another man had paused to listen to these words, and he now interposed,
  speaking to Bassus,</p>

  <p>"Verily Catiline is like to do thee justice, my poor Bassus, on a member
  of the Cornelian house! Is't Lentulus, I prithee, or Cethegus, on whom thou
  would'st have justice?"</p>

  <p>But the old man replied angrily, "The people's friend shall give the
  people justice! who ever knew a noble pity or right a poor man?"</p>

  <p>"Ask Aulus Fulvius"&mdash;replied the other, with a sarcastic tone, and a
  strange smile lighting up his features. "Besides, is not Catiline a
  noble?"</p>

  <p>At the word Aulus Fulvius leaped on him like a tiger, with his face
  crimsoning, and his heart almost bursting with fury.</p>

  <p>He could not speak for rage, but he seized the man who had uttered those
  mysterious words by the throat, and brandished a long poniard, extricated in
  a second's space from the loose sleeve of his tunic, furiously in the
  air.</p>

  <p>As the bright blade flashed in the sunlight, there was a forward rush
  among the conspirators, who, anxious to avert any casual affray, that might
  have created a disturbance, would have checked the blow.</p>

  <p>But their aid would have come too late, had not the man thus suddenly
  assaulted, by an extraordinary exertion of strength, vigor, and agility,
  wrenched the dagger from Aulus' hand, and, tripping him at the same moment
  with his foot, hurled him upon his back in the dust, which surged up in a
  great cloud, covering his perfumed hair and snow-white toga, with its filthy
  and faetid particles.</p>

  <p>"Ha! ha!" he cried with a loud ringing laugh, as he tossed the weapon high
  into the sunny air, that all around might see it&mdash;"Here is one of your
  <i>noble</i> people's friends!&mdash;Do they wear daggers <i>all</i>, for the
  people's throats? Do they wave torches <i>all</i>, against the people's
  workshops?"</p>

  <p>The matter seemed to be growing serious, and while two or three of the
  conspirators seized Aulus, and compelled him with gentle violence to desist
  from farther tumult, Caeparius whispered into the ear of Catiline, "This
  knave knows far too much. Were it not best three or four of our friend
  Crispus' men should knock him on the head?"</p>

  <p>"No! no!" cried Catiline&mdash;"By Hades! no! It is too late, I tell you.
  The whole thing will be settled within half an hour. There goes the second
  trumpet."</p>

  <p>And as he spoke, the shrill blast of the brazen instruments rose
  piercingly and almost painfully upon the ear; and the people might be seen
  collecting themselves rapidly into the centuries of their tribes, in order to
  give their votes in their places, as ascertained by lot.</p>

  <p>"And the third"&mdash;exclaimed Cassius, joyfully&mdash;"Will give the
  signal for <i>election</i>!" Catiline interrupted him, as if fearful that he
  would say some thing that should commit the party. "But see," he added,
  pointing with his hand across the wide plain toward a little knoll, on which
  there stood a group of noble-looking men, surrounded by a multitude of
  knights and patricians, "See yonder, how thickly the laticlavian tunics
  muster, and the crimson-edged togas of the nobles&mdash;all the knights are
  there too, methinks. And look! look the consuls of the year! and my
  competitors! Come, my friends, come; we must toward the consul. He is about
  to open the comitia."</p>

  <p>"Catiline! Catiline! the people's friend!" again shouted Caius Crispus;
  and Bassus took the word, and repeated it in the shrill quavering accents of
  old age&mdash;"All those who love the people vote for the people's
  friend&mdash;vote for the noble Catiline!"</p>

  <p>And at once thousands of voices took the cry, "Catiline! Catiline! Hail,
  Catiline, that shall be Consul!"</p>

  <p>And, in the midst of these triumphant cries, hardened and proud of heart,
  and confident of the success of his blood-thirsty schemes, he hurried
  forward, accompanied by Lentulus and his armed satellites, panting already
  with anticipated joy, and athirst for slaughter.</p>

  <p>But, as he swept along, followed by the faction, a great body of citizens
  of the lower orders, decent substantial men, came crowding toward the Campus,
  and paused to inquire the cause of the tumult, which had left its visible
  effects in the flushed visages and knotted brows of many present.</p>

  <p>Two or three voices began to relate what had passed; but the smith
  Crispus, who had lingered with one or two of his ruffians, intent to murder
  the man who had crossed his chief, so soon as the signal should be given,
  rudely broke in, and interrupted them with the old cry, "The people's friend!
  All ye who love the people, vote for the people's friend, vote for the noble
  Catiline!"</p>

  <p>"Had mighty Marius been alive, Marius of Arpinum, or the great Gracchi,
  they had cried, 'Vote rather for the man of the people!&mdash;vote for Cicero
  of Arpinum!'"</p>

  <p>"Tush, what knows he of Marius?" replied the smith.</p>

  <p>"What knows he of the great Gracchi?" echoed one of his followers.</p>

  <p>"Whether should best know Marius, they who fought by his side, or they who
  slew his friends? Who should best know the great Gracchi if not Fulvius, the
  grandson of that Fulvius Flaccus, who died with them, in the forum, by the
  hands of Saturninus?"</p>

  <p>"Vote for Catiline! vote for Catiline! friends of the people!" shouted the
  smith again, rechoed by all his savage and vociferous gang, seeking to drown
  the voice of the true man of the people.</p>

  <p>"Aye" exclaimed Fulvius, ironically, springing upon a stone horse-block,
  thence to address the people, who shouted "Flaccus! Flaccus!" on all sides.
  "Live Fulvius Flaccus! Speak to us, noble Fulvius!"</p>

  <p>"Aye!" he exclaimed, "friends of the people, followers of Marius, vote, if
  ye be wise men, for the murderer of his kinsman&mdash;for Catiline, who slew
  Marius Gratidianus!"</p>

  <p>"No! no! we will none of them! no Catiline! no follower of Sylla? To your
  tribes, men of Rome&mdash;to your tribes!"</p>

  <p>The mingled cries waxed wild and terrible; and it was clear that the
  popular party was broken, by the bold words of the speaker, into two bodies,
  if ever it had been united. But little cared the conspirators for that, since
  they had counted, not upon winning by a majority of tribes, but by a civic
  massacre.</p>

  <p>And now&mdash;even as that roar was the loudest, while Flaccus in vain
  strove to gain a hearing, for the third time the brazen trumpets of the
  centuries awoke their stirring symphonies, announcing that the hour had
  arrived for the tribes to commence their voting.</p>

  <p>Those who were in the secret looked eagerly over the field. The hour had
  come&mdash;the leader was at their head&mdash;they waited but the signal!</p>

  <p>That signal, named by Catiline, in the house of Laeca,&mdash;the blood of
  Cicero!</p>

  <p>They saw a mass of men, pressing on like a mighty wedge through the dense
  multitude; parting the waves of the living ocean as a stout galley parts the
  billows; struggling on steadily toward the knoll, whereon, amid the magnates
  of the land, consulars, senators, and knights, covering it with the pomp of
  white and crimson gowns, gemmed only by the flashing axe-heads of the
  lictors, stood the great Consul.</p>

  <p>They saw the gladiators forming themselves into a separate band, on the
  slopes of the Janiculum, with a senator's robe distinct among the dark gray
  tunics.</p>

  <p>Catiline and his clients were not a hundred paces distant from Cicero, and
  the assembled nobles. They had halted! Their hands were busy in the bosom of
  their gowns, griping the hilts of their assassin's tools!</p>

  <p>Cethegus and his gladiators were not a hundred paces distant from the
  bridge-gate of the Janiculum, and the cohort's bannered eagle.</p>

  <p>They, too, had halted! they, too, were forming in battle order&mdash;they
  too were mustering their breath for the dread onset&mdash;they too were
  handling their war weapons!</p>

  <p>Almost had Caius Crispus, in his mad triumph, shouted victory.</p>

  <p>One moment, and Rome had been the prize for the winner in the gladiators'
  battle.</p>

  <p>And the notes of the brazen trumpets had not yet died away, among the
  echoing hills.</p>

  <p>They had not died away, before they were taken up and repeated, east,
  west, and north and south, by shriller, more pervading clangors.</p>

  <p>It burst over the heads of the astonished people like heaven's thunder,
  the wild prolonged war-flourish of the legions. From the Tarpeian rock, and
  the guarded Capitol; from the rampired Janiculum; from the fortress, beyond
  the Island bridge; from the towered steeps of the Quirinal, broke
  simultaneously the well known Roman war note!</p>

  <p>Upsprang, along the turreted wall of the Janiculum, with crested casques,
  and burnished brazen corslets, and the tremendous javelins of the cohorts, a
  long line of Metellus' legionaries.</p>

  <p>Upsprang on the heights of the Capitol, and on each point of vantage, an
  answering band of warriors, full armed.</p>

  <p>And, last not least, as that warlike din smote the sky, Cicero, on whom
  every eye was riveted of that vast concourse, flung back his toga, and stood
  forth conspicuous, armed with a mighty breastplate, and girded with the sword
  that won him, at an after day, among the mountains of Cilicia, the high style
  of Imperator.</p>

  <p>A mighty shout burst from the faithful ranks of the knights; and, starting
  from their scabbards, five thousand sword-blades flashed in a trusty ring
  around the savior of his country.</p>

  <p>"Catiline would have murdered Him!" shouted the voice of Fulvius
  Flaccus&mdash;"Catiline would have burned your workshops! Catiline would have
  made himself Dictator, King! Vote, men of Rome, vote, friends of the people I
  vote now, I say, for Catiline!"</p>

  <p>Anticipated, frustrated, outwitted,&mdash;the conspirators glared on each
  other hopeless.</p>

  <p>Against forces so combined, what chance of success?</p>

  <p>Still, although ruined in his hopes, Catiline bore up bravely, and with an
  insolence of hardihood that in a good cause had been heroism.</p>

  <p>Affecting to laugh at the precautions, and sneer at the pusillanimous mind
  that had suggested them, he defied proof, defied suspicion.</p>

  <p>There was no overt act&mdash;no proof! and Cicero, satisfied with his
  triumph&mdash;for alarmed beyond measure, and astonished, all ranks and
  classes vied with each other in voting for Silanus and Muraena&mdash;took no
  step to arrest or convict the ringleaders.</p>

  <p>It was a moral, not a physical victory, at which he had aimed so
  nobly.</p>

  <p>And nobly had he won it.</p>

  <p>The views of the conspiracy frustrated; the hearts of its leaders chilled
  and thunder-stricken; the loyalty and virtue of all classes aroused; the eyes
  of the Roman people opened to knowledge of their friends; two wise and noble
  consuls chosen, by who were on the point of casting their votes for a
  murderer and traitor; the city saved from conflagration; the commonwealth
  preserved, in all its majesty; these were the trophies of the Consular
  Comitia.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch203"
     name="ch203"></a>III. &mdash; <i>THE PERIL</i></h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>Things, bad begun, make strong themselves by
     ill.</i> &mdash;Macbeth.</p><br>

  <p class="first">SIXTEEN days had elapsed, since the conspirators were again
  frustrated at the Consular Comitia.</p>

  <p>Yet not for that had the arch-traitor withdrawn his foot one hair's
  breadth from his purpose, or paused one moment in his career of crime and
  ruin.</p>

  <p>There is, beyond doubt, a necessity&mdash;not as the ancients deemed,
  supernatural, and the work of fate, but a natural moral
  necessity&mdash;arising from the very quality of crime itself, which spurs
  the criminal on to new guilt, fresh atrocity.</p>

  <p>In the dark path of wickedness there is no halting place; the wretched
  climber must turn his face for ever upward, for ever onward; if he look
  backward his fall is inevitable, his doom fixed.</p>

  <p>So was it proved with Catiline. To gain impunity for his first deed of
  cruelty and blood, another and another were forced on him, until at last,
  harassed and maddened by the consciousness of untold guilt, his frantic
  spirit could find no respite, save in the fierce intoxication of excitement,
  the strange delight of new atrocity.</p>

  <p>Add to this, that, knowing himself anticipated and discovered, he knew
  also that if spared for a time by his opponent, it was no lack of will, but
  lack of opportunity alone to crush him, that held the hands of Cicero
  inactive.</p>

  <p>Thus, although for a time the energies of his weaker comrades sank
  paralysed by the frustration of their schemes, and by the certainty that they
  were noted and observed even in their most secret hours, his stronger and
  more vehement spirit found only in the greater danger the greater stimulus to
  action.</p>

  <p>Sixteen days had elapsed, and gradually, as the conspirators found that no
  steps were taken by the government for their apprehension or punishment, they
  too waxed bolder, and began to fancy, in their insolent presumption, that the
  republic was too weak or too timid to enforce its own laws upon undoubted
  traitors.</p>

  <p>All the causes, moreover, which had urged them at first to councils so
  desperate, existed undiminished, nay, exaggerated by delay.</p>

  <p>Their debts, their inability to raise those funds which their boundless
  profusion rendered necessary, still maddened them; and to these the
  consciousness of detected guilt, and that "necessity which," in the words of
  their chief, "makes even the timid brave," were superadded.</p>

  <p>The people and the Senate, who had all, for a time, been vehemently
  agitated by a thousand various emotions of anger, fear, anxiety, revenge,
  forgetting, as all popular bodies are wont to do, the past danger in the
  present security, were beginning to doubt whether they had not been alarmed
  at a shadow; and were half inclined to question the existence of any
  conspiracy, save in the fears of their Consul.</p>

  <p>It was well for Rome at that hour, that there was still in the
  commonwealth, a counterpoise to the Democratic Spirit; which, vehement and
  energetical beyond all others in sudden and great emergencies, is ever
  restless and impatient of protracted watchfulness and preparation, and lacks
  that persistency and resolute endurance which seems peculiar to aristocratic
  constitutions.</p>

  <p>And now especially were demonstrated these opposite characteristics; for
  while the lower orders, and the popular portion of the Senate, who had been
  in the first instance most strenuous in their alarm, and most urgent for
  strong measures, were now hesitating, doubting, and almost compassionating
  the culprits, who had fallen under such a load of obloquy, the firmer and
  more moderate minds, were guarding the safety of the commonwealth in secret,
  and watching, through their unknown emissaries, every movement of the
  traitors.</p>

  <p>It was about twelve o'clock at night, on the eighth day before the Ides,
  corresponding to our seventh of November, when the Consul was seated alone in
  the small but sumptuous library, which has been described above, meditating
  with an anxious and care-worn expression, over some papers which lay before
  him on the table.</p>

  <p>No sound had been heard in the house for several hours; all its
  inhabitants except the Consul only, with the slave who had charge of the
  outer door, and one faithful freedman, having long since retired to rest.</p>

  <p>But from without, the wailing of the stormy night-wind rose and fell in
  melancholy alternations of wild sobbing sound, and breathless silence; and
  the pattering of heavy rain was distinctly audible on the flat roofs, and in
  the flooded tank, or <i>impluvium</i>, which occupied the centre of the
  hall.</p>

  <p>It was in one of the lulls of the autumnal storm, that a heavy knock was
  heard on the pannel of the exterior door, reverberating in long echoes,
  through the silent vestibule, and the vast colonnades of the Atrium and
  peristyle.</p>

  <p>At that dead hour of night, such a summons would have seemed strange in
  any season: it was now almost alarming.</p>

  <p>Nor, though he was endowed pre-eminently with that moral strength of mind
  which is the highest quality of courage, and was by no means deficient in
  mere physical bravery, did Cicero raise his head from the perusal of his
  papers, and listen to that unwonted sound, without some symptoms of anxiety
  and perturbation.</p>

  <p>So thoroughly acquainted as he was, with the desperate wickedness, the
  infernal energy, and absolute fearlessness of Catiline, it could not but
  occur to him instantly, when he heard that unusual summons, at a time when
  all the innocent world was buried in calm sleep, how easy and obvious a mode
  of liberation from all danger and restraint, his murder would afford to men
  so daring and unscrupulous, as those against whom he was playing, for no less
  a stake than life or death.</p>

  <p>There was, he well knew, but a single slave, and he old and unarmed, in
  the vestibule, nor was the aged and effeminate Greek freedman, one on whom
  reliance could be placed in a deadly struggle.</p>

  <p>All these things flashed suddenly upon the mind of Cicero, as the heavy
  knocking fell upon his ear, followed by a murmur of many voices, and the
  tread of many feet without.</p>

  <p>He arose quietly from the bronze arm-chair, on which he had been sitting,
  walked across the room, to a recess beside the book-shelves, and reached down
  from a hook, on which it hung, among a collection of armor and weapons, a
  stout, straight, Roman broad-sword, with a highly adorned hilt and
  scabbard.</p>

  <p>Scarcely, however, had he taken the weapon in his hand, before the door
  was thrown open, and his freedman ushered in three men, attired in the full
  costume of Roman Senators.</p>

  <p>"All hail, at this untimely hour, most noble Cicero," exclaimed the first
  who entered.</p>

  <p>"By all the Gods!" cried the second, "rejoiced I am, O Consul, to see that
  you are on your guard; for there is need of watchfulness, in truth, for who
  love the republic."</p>

  <p>"Which need it is, in short," added the third, "that has brought us
  hither."</p>

  <p>"Most welcome at all times," answered Cicero, laying aside the broad-sword
  with a smile, "though of a truth, I thought it might be less gracious
  visitors. Noble Marcellus, have you good tidings of the commonwealth? and
  you, Metellus Scipio, and you Marcus Crassus? Friends to the state, I know
  you; and would trust that no ill news hath held you watchful."</p>

  <p>"Be not too confident of that, my Consul," replied Scipio. "Peril there
  is, at hand to the commonwealth, in your person."</p>

  <p>"We have strange tidings here, confirming all that you made known to the
  Senate, on the twelfth day before the Calends, in letters left by an unknown
  man with Crassus' doorkeeper this evening," said Marcellus. "We were at
  supper with him, when they came, and straightway determined to accompany him
  hither."</p>

  <p>"In my person!" exclaimed Cicero&mdash;"Then is the peril threatened from
  Lucius Sergius Catiline! were it for myself alone, this were a matter of
  small moment; but, seeing that I hold alone the clues of this dark plot, it
  were disastrous to the state, should ought befall me, who have set my life on
  this cast to save my country."</p>

  <p>"Indeed disastrous!" exclaimed the wealthy Crassus; "for these most
  horrible and cursed traitors are sworn, as it would seem, to consume this
  most glorious city of the earth, and all its stately wealth, with the sword
  and fire."</p>

  <p>"To destroy all the noble houses," cried Scipio, "and place the vile and
  loathsome rabble at the helm of state."</p>

  <p>"All this, I well knew, of old," said Cicero calmly. "But I pray you, my
  friends, be seated; and let me see these papers."</p>

  <p>And taking the anonymous letters from the hands of Crassus, he read them
  aloud, pausing from time to time, to meditate on the intention of the
  writer.</p>

  <p>"Marcus Licinius Crassus," thus ran the first, "is spoken of by those, who
  love not Rome, as their lover and trusty comrade! Doth Marcus Licinius
  Crassus deem that the flames, which shall roar over universal Rome, will
  spare his houses only? Doth Marcus Crassus hope, that when the fetters shall
  be stricken from the limbs of every slave in Rome, his serfs alone will hold
  their necks beneath a voluntary yoke?&mdash;Doth he imagine that, when all
  the gold of the rich shall be distributed among the needy, his seven thousand
  talents shall escape the red hands of Catiline and his associates? Be wise!
  Take heed! The noble, who forsakes his order, earns scorn alone from his new
  partisans! When Cicero shall fall, all noble Romans shall perish lamentably,
  with him&mdash;when the great Capitol itself shall melt in the conflagration,
  all private dwellings shall go down in the common ruin. Take counsel of a
  friend, true, though unknown and humble! Hold fast to the republic! rally the
  nobles and the rich, around the Consul! Ere the third day hence, he shall be
  triumphant, or be nothing!&mdash;Fare thee well!"</p>

  <p>"This is mysterious, dark, incomprehensible," said Cicero, as he finished
  reading it. "Had it been sent to me, I should have read it's secret thus, as
  intended to awake suspicion, in my mind, of a brave and noble Roman! a true
  friend of his country!" he added, taking the hand of Crassus in his own.
  "Yet, even so, it would have failed. For as soon would I doubt the truth of
  heaven itself, as question the patriotic faith of the conqueror of Spartacus!
  But left at thy house, my Crassus, it seems almost senseless and unmeaning.
  What have we more?</p>

  <p>"The snake is scotched, not slain! The spark is concealed, not quenched!
  The knife is sharp yet, though it lie in the scabbard! When was conspiracy
  beat down by clemency, or treason conquered by timidity? Let those who would
  survive the ides of November, keep their loins girded, and their eyes
  wakeful. What I am, you may not learn, but this much only&mdash;I was a
  noble, before I was a beggar! a Roman, before I was a&mdash;traitor!"</p>

  <p>"Ha!" continued the consul, examining the paper closely, "This is somewhat
  more pregnant&mdash;the Ides of November!&mdash;the Ides&mdash;is it
  so?&mdash;They shall be met withal!&mdash;It is a different hand-writing
  also; and here is a third&mdash;Ha!"</p>

  <p>"A third, plainer than the first," said Metellus Scipio&mdash;"pray mark
  it."</p>

  <p>"Three men have sworn&mdash;who never swear in vain&mdash;a knight, a
  senator, and yet a senator again! Two of the three, Cornelii! Their knives
  are keen, their hands sure, their hearts resolute, against the new man from
  Arpinum! Let those who love Cicero, look to the seventh day, before
  November's Ides."</p>

  <p>"The seventh day&mdash;ha? so soon? Be it so," said the undaunted
  magistrate. "I am prepared for any fortune."</p>

  <p>"Consul," exclaimed the Freedman, again entering, "I watched with Geta, in
  the vestibule, since these good fathers entered; and now there have come two
  ladies clad in the sacred garb of vestals. Two lictors wait on them. They ask
  to speak with the consul."</p>

  <p>"Admit them, madman!" exclaimed Cicero; "admit them with all honor. You
  have not surely kept them in the vestibule?"</p>

  <p>"Not so, my Consul. They are seated on the ivory chairs in the
  Tablinum."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, noble friends. I go to greet the holy virgins. This is a
  strange and most unusual honour. Lead the way, man."</p>

  <p>And with the words, he left the room in evident anxiety and haste; while
  his three visitors stood gazing each on the other, in apprehension mingled
  with wonder.</p>

  <p>In a few moments, however, he returned alone, very pale, and wearing on
  his fine features a singular expression of awe and dignified
  self-complacency, which seemed to be almost at variance with each other.</p>

  <p>"The Gods," he said, as he entered, in a deep and solemn tone, "the Gods
  themselves attest Rome's peril by grand and awful portents. The College of
  the Vestals sends tidings, that 'The State totters to its fall'!"</p>

  <p>"May the Great Gods avert!" cried his three auditors, simultaneously,
  growing as pale as death, and faltering out their words from ashy lips in
  weak or uncertain accents.</p>

  <p>"It is so!" said Cicero; who, though a pure Deist, in truth, and no
  believer in Rome's monstrous polytheism, was not sufficiently emancipated
  from the superstition of the age to dispute the truth of prodigies and
  portents. "It is so. The priestess, who watched the sacred flame on the
  eternal hearth, beheld it leap thrice upward in a clear spire of vivid and
  unearthly light, and lick the vaulted roof-stones&mdash;thrice vanish into
  utter gloom! Once, she believed the fire extinct, and veiled her head in more
  than mortal terror. But, after momentary gloom, it again revived, while three
  strange sighs, mightier than any human voice, came breathing from the inmost
  shrine, and waved the flame fitfully to and fro, with a dread pallid lustre.
  The College bids the Consul to watch for himself and the republic, these
  three days, or ill shall come of it."</p>

  <p>Even as he spoke, a bustle was again heard in the vestibule, as of a fresh
  arrival, and again the freedman entered.</p>

  <p>"My Consul, a veiled patrician woman craves to confer with you, in
  private."</p>

  <p>"Ha! all Rome is afoot, methinks, to-night. Do you know her, my
  Glaucias?"</p>

  <p>"I saw her once before, my Consul. On the night of the fearful storm, when
  the falchion of flame shook over Rome, and the Senate was convened
  suddenly."</p>

  <p>"Ha! She! it is well&mdash;it is very well! we shall know all anon." And
  his face lighted up joyously, as he spoke. "Excuse me, Friends and Fathers.
  This is one privy to the plot, with tidings of weight doubtless. Thanks for
  your news, and good night; for I must pray you leave me. Your warning hath
  come in good season, and I will not be taken unaware. The Gods have Rome in
  their keeping, and, to save her, they will not let <i>me</i> perish. Fare ye
  well, nobles. I must be private with this woman."</p>

  <p>After the ceremonial of the time, his visitors departed; but as they
  passed through the atrium, they met the lady, conducted by the old Greek
  freedman.</p>

  <p>Little expecting to meet any one at that untimely hour, she had allowed
  her veil to fall down upon her shoulders; and, although she made a movement
  to recover it, as she saw the Senators approaching her by the faint light of
  the single lamp which burned before the household gods on the small altar by
  the <i>impluvium</i>, Marcus Marcellus caught a passing view of a pair of
  large languishing blue eyes, and a face of rare beauty.</p>

  <p>"By the great Gods!" he whispered in Crassus' ear, "that was the lovely
  Fulvia."</p>

  <p>"Ha! Curius' paramour!" replied the other. "Can it be possible that the
  stern Consul amuses his light hours, with such high-born harlotry?"</p>

  <p>"Not he! not he!" said Scipio. "I doubt not Curius is one of them! He is
  needy, and bold, and bloody."</p>

  <p>"But such a braggart!" answered Marcellus.</p>

  <p>"I have known braggarts fight," said Crassus. "There was a fellow, who
  served in the fifth legion; he fought before the standard of the hastati; and
  I deemed him a coward ever, but in the last strife with Spartacus he slew six
  men with his own hand. I saw it."</p>

  <p>"I have heard of such things," said Scipio. "But it grows late. Let us
  move homeward." And then he added, as he was leaving the Consul's door, "If
  he can trust his household, Cicero should arm it. My life on it! They will
  attempt to murder him."</p>

  <p>"He has given orders even now to arm his slaves," said the Freedman, in
  reply; "and so soon as they have got their blades and bucklers, I go to
  invite hither the surest of his clients."</p>

  <p>"Thou shalt do well to do so&mdash;But see thou do it silently."</p>

  <p>And with the words, they hurried homeward through the dark streets,
  leaving the wise and virtuous magistrate in conference with his abandoned,
  yet trustworthy informant, Fulvia.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch204"
     name="ch204"></a>IV. &mdash; THE CRISIS</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>He is about it. The doors are open.</i>
     &mdash;Macbeth.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE morning had scarcely dawned, after that dismal and
  tempestuous night, when three men were observed by some of the earlier
  citizens, passing up the Sacred Way, toward the Cerolian Place.</p>

  <p>It was not so much that the earliness of the hour attracted the notice of
  these spectators&mdash;for the Romans were a matutinal people, even in their
  most effeminate and luxurious ages, and the sun found few loiterers in their
  chambers, when he came forth from his oriental gates&mdash;as that the manner
  and expression of these men themselves were singular, and such as might well
  excite suspicion.</p>

  <p>They all walked abreast, two clad in the full garb of Senators, and one in
  the distinctive dress of Roman knighthood. No one had heard them speak aloud,
  nor seen them whisper, one to the other. They moved straight onward, steadily
  indeed and rather slowly, but with something of consciousness in their
  manner, glancing furtively around them from beneath their bent brows, and
  sometimes even casting their eyes over their shoulders, as if to see whether
  they were followed.</p>

  <p>At about a hundred paces after these three, not however accompanying them,
  or attached to their party, so far at least as appearances are considered,
  two large-framed fellows, clothed in the dark gray frocks worn by slaves and
  gladiators, came strolling in the same direction.</p>

  <p>These men had the auburn hair, blue eyes, and massive, if not stolid cast
  of features peculiar to northern races, at that time the conquered slaves,
  though destined soon to be the victors, of Rome's gigantic power.</p>

  <p>When the first three reached the corner of the next block of buildings, to
  the corner of that magnificent street called the Carinoe, they paused for a
  few moments; and, after looking carefully about them, to mark whether they
  were observed or not, held a short whispered conversation, which their stern
  faces, and impassioned gestures seemed to denote momentous.</p>

  <p>While they were thus engaged, the other two came sauntering along, and
  passed them by, apparently unheeded, and without speaking, or saluting
  them.</p>

  <p>Those three men were the knight Caius Cornelius, a friend and distant
  kinsman of Cethegus, who was the second of the number, and Lucius
  Vargunteius, a Senator, whose name has descended only to posterity, through
  the black infamy of the deed, which he was even at that moment
  meditating.</p>

  <p>Spurred into action by the menaces and violence of Catiline, who had now
  resolved to go forth and commence open warfare from the entrenched camp
  prepared in the Appenines, by Caius Manlius, these men had volunteered, on
  the previous night, at a second meeting held in the house of Laeca, to murder
  Cicero, with their own hands, during his morning levee.</p>

  <p>To this end, they had now come forth thus early, hoping so to anticipate
  the visit of his numerous clients, and take him at advantage, unprepared and
  defenceless.</p>

  <p>Three stout men were they, as ever went forth armed and determined for
  premeditated crime; stout in frame, stout of heart, invulnerable by any
  physical apprehension, unassailable by any touch of conscience, pitiless,
  fearless, utterly depraved.</p>

  <p>Yet there was something in their present enterprise, that half daunted
  them. Something in the character of the man, whom they were preparing to
  assassinate&mdash;something of undefined feeling, suggesting to them the
  certainty of the whole world's reproach and scorn through everlasting ages,
  however present success "might trammel up the consequence."</p>

  <p>Though they would not have confessed it to their own hearts, they were
  reluctant toward their task; and this unadmitted reluctance it was, which led
  them to pause and parley, under the show of arranging their schemes, which
  had in truth been fully organized on the preceding night.</p>

  <p>They were too far committed, however, to recede; and it is probable that
  no one of them, although their hearts were full almost to suffocation, as
  they neared the good Consul's door, had gone so far as to think of
  withdrawing his hand from the deed of blood.</p>

  <p>The outer door of the vestibule was open; and but one slave was stationed
  in the porch; an old man quite unarmed, not having so much even as a porter's
  staff, who was sitting on a stone bench, in the morning sunshine.</p>

  <p>As the conspirators ascended the marble steps, which gave access to the
  vestibule, and entered the beautiful Tuscan colonnade, the two Germans, who
  had stopped and looked back for a moment, seeing them pass in, set off as
  hard as they could run, through an adjoining street toward the house of
  Catiline, which was not very far distant.</p>

  <p>It was not long ere they reached it, and entered without question or
  hindrance, as men familiar and permitted.</p>

  <p>In a small room, adjoining the inner peristyle, the master of the house
  was striding to and fro across the tesselated floor, in a state of
  perturbation, extreme even for him; whose historian has described him with
  bloodless face, and evil eyes, irregular and restless motions, and the
  impress of frantic guilt, ever plain to be seen in his agitated features.</p>

  <p>Aurelia Orestilla sat near him, on a low cushioned stool, with her superb
  Italian face livid and sicklied by unusual dread. Her hands lay tightly
  clasped upon her knee&mdash;her lips were as white as ashes. Her large
  lustrous eyes, burning and preternaturally distended, were fixed on the
  haggard face of her husband, and followed him, as he strode up and down the
  room in impotent anxiety and expectation.</p>

  <p>Yet she, privy as she was to all his blackest councils, the instigator and
  rewarder of his most hideous crime, knowing the hell of impotent agony that
  was consuming his heart, she dared not address him with any words of hope or
  consolation.</p>

  <p>At such a crisis all ordinary phrases of comfort or cheering love, seem
  but a mockery to the spirit, which can find no rest, until the doubts that
  harass it are ended; and this she felt to be the case, and, had her own
  torturing expectation allowed her to frame any speech to soothe him, she
  would not have ventured on its utterance, certain that it would call forth a
  torrent of imprecation on her head, perhaps a burst of violence against her
  person.</p>

  <p>The very affections of the wicked, are strangely mixed at times, with more
  discordant elements; and it would have been a hard question to solve, whether
  that horrible pair most loved, or hated one another.</p>

  <p>The woman's passions, strange to relate, had been kindled at times, by the
  very cruelty and fury, which at other moments made her almost detest him.
  There was a species of sublimity in the very atrocity of Catiline's
  wickedness, which fascinated her morbid and polluted fancy; and she almost
  admired the ferocity which tortured her, and from which, alone of mortal
  ills, she shrank appalled and unresisting.</p>

  <p>And Catiline loved her, as well as he could love anything, loved her the
  more because she too, in some sort, had elicited his admiration; for she had
  crossed him many times, and once braved him, and, alone of human beings, he
  had not crushed her.</p>

  <p>They were liker to mated tigers, which even in their raptures of
  affection, rend with the fang, and clutch with the unsheathed talon, until
  the blood and anguish testify the fury of their passion, than to beings of
  human mould and nature.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the traitor stopped short in his wild and agitated walk, and
  seemed to listen intently, although no sound came to the ears of the woman,
  who was no less on the alert than he, for any stir or rumor.</p>

  <p>"It is"&mdash;he said at length, clasping his hands above his
  head&mdash;"it is the step of Arminius, the trusty gladiator&mdash;do you not
  hear it, Orestilla?"</p>

  <p>"No," she replied, shaking her head doubtfully. "There is no sound at all.
  My ear is quicker of hearing, too, than yours, Catiline, and if there were
  any step, I should be first to mark it."</p>

  <p>"Tush! woman!" he made answer, glaring upon her fiercely. "It is my
  <i>heart</i> that hears it."</p>

  <p>"You have a heart, then!" she replied bitterly, unable even at that time
  to refrain from taunting him.</p>

  <p>"And a hand also, and a dagger! and, by Hell and all its furies! I know
  not why I do not flesh it in you. I will one day."</p>

  <p>"No, you will not," she answered very quietly.</p>

  <p>"And wherefore not? I have done many a worse deed in my day. The Gods
  would scarce punish me for that slaughter; and men might well call it
  justice.&mdash;Wherefore not, I say? Do you think I so doat on your beauty,
  that I cannot right gladly spare you?"</p>

  <p>"Because," answered the woman, meeting his fixed glare, with a glance as
  meaning and as fiery, "because, when I find that you meditate it, I will act
  quickest. I know a drug or two, and an unguent of very sovereign virtue."</p>

  <p>"Ha! ha!" The reckless profligate burst into a wild ringing laugh of
  triumphant approbation. "Ha! ha! thou mightst have given me a better reason.
  Where else should I find such a tigress? By all the Gods! it is your clutch
  and claws that I prize, more than your softest and most rapturous caress! But
  hist! hist! now&mdash;do you not hear that step?"</p>

  <p>"I do&mdash;I do," she replied, clasping her hands again, which she had
  unclinched in her anger&mdash;"and it <i>is</i> Arminius' step! I was wrong
  to cross thee, Catiline; and thou so anxious! we shall hear now&mdash;we
  shall hear all."</p>

  <p>Almost as she spoke, the German gladiator rushed into the room, heated and
  panting from his swift race; and, without any sign of reverence or any
  salutation, exclaimed abruptly,</p>

  <p>"Catiline, it is over, ere this time! I saw them enter his house!"</p>

  <p>The woman uttered a low choking shriek, her face flushed crimson, and then
  again turned paler than before, and she fell back on her cushioned seat,
  swooning with joy at the welcome tidings.</p>

  <p>But Catiline flung both his arms abroad toward heaven, and cried
  aloud&mdash;"Ye Gods, for once I thank ye! if there be Gods indeed!" he
  added, with a sneer&mdash;"thou sawest them enter, ha?&mdash;thou art not
  lying?&mdash;By all the furies! If you deceive me, I will take care that you
  see nothing more in this world."</p>

  <p>"Catiline, these eyes saw them!"</p>

  <p>"At length! at length!" he exclaimed, his eye flashing, and his whole
  countenance glowing with fiendish animation, "and yet curses upon
  it!&mdash;that I could not slay him&mdash;that I should owe to any other hand
  my vengeance on my victim. Thou hast done well&mdash;ha! here is gold,
  Arminius! the last gold I own&mdash;but what of that,
  to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow, I will have millions! Away! away! bold heart,
  arouse your friends and followers&mdash;to arms, to arms, cry havoc through
  the streets, and liberty and vengeance!"</p>

  <p>While he was speaking yet, the door was again opened, and Cethegus entered
  with the others, dull, gloomy, and crest-fallen; but Catiline was in a state
  of excitement so tremendous, that he saw nothing but the men.</p>

  <p>At one bound he reached Cethegus, and catching him by both
  hands&mdash;"How!" he exclaimed&mdash;"How was it?&mdash;quick, tell me,
  quick! Did he die hard? Did he die, conscious, in despair, in
  anguish?&mdash;Tell me, tell me, you tortured him in the slaying&mdash;tell
  me, he died a coward, howling and cursing fate, and knowing that I, <i>I</i>
  slew him, and&mdash;speak Cethegus?&mdash;speak, man! By the Gods! you are
  pale! silent!&mdash;these are not faces fit for triumph! speak, man, I say,
  how died he?&mdash;show me his blood, Cethegus! you have not wiped it from
  your dagger, give me the blade, that I may kiss away the precious
  death-drops."</p>

  <p>So rapidly and impetuously had he spoken, heaping query on query, that
  Cethegus could not have answered, if he would. But, to say the truth, he was
  in little haste to do so. When Catiline ceased, however, which he did at
  length, from actual want of breath to enquire farther, he answered in a low
  smothered voice.</p>

  <p>"He is not dead at all&mdash;he refused"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Not dead!" shrieked Catiline, for it was a shriek, though articulate, and
  one so piercing that it roused Aurelia from her swoon of joy&mdash;"Not dead!
  Yon villain swore that he saw you enter&mdash;not dead!" he repeated, half
  incredulously&mdash;"By heaven and hell! I believe you are jesting with me!
  Tell me that you have lied, and I&mdash;I&mdash;I will worship you,
  Cethegus."</p>

  <p>"His porter refused us entrance, and, as the door was opened, we saw in
  the Atrium the slaves of his household, and half a hundred of his clients,
  all armed from head to foot, with casque and corslet, pilum, broad-sword, and
  buckler. And, to complete the tale, as we returned into the street baffled
  and desperate, a window was thrown open in the banquet-hall above, and we
  might see the Consul, with Cato, and Marcellus, and Scipio, and a score of
  Consulars beside, gazing upon us in all the triumph of security, in all the
  confidence of success. We are betrayed, that is plain&mdash;our plans are all
  known as soon as they are taken, all frustrated ere acted! All is lost,
  Catiline, for what remains to do?"</p>

  <p>"To dare!" answered the villain, all undaunted even by this
  reverse&mdash;"and, if need be, to die&mdash;but to despair, never!"</p>

  <p>"But who can be the traitor?&mdash;where shall we look to find him?"</p>

  <p>"Look there," exclaimed Catiline, pointing to the German gladiator, who
  stood all confounded and chap-fallen. "Look there, and you shall see one; and
  see him punished too! What ho! without there, ho! a dozen of you, if you
  would shun the lash!"</p>

  <p>And, at the summons, ten or twelve slaves and freedmen rushed into the
  room in trepidation, almost in terror, so savage was the temper of the lord
  whom they served, and so merciless his wrath, at the most trivial fault or
  error.</p>

  <p>"Drag that brute, hence!" he said, waving his hand toward the unhappy
  gladiator, "put out his eyes, fetter him foot and hand, and cast him to the
  congers in the fish-pond."</p>

  <p>Without a moment's pause or hesitation, they cast themselves upon their
  miserable comrade; and, though he struggled furiously, and struck down two or
  three of the foremost, and shouted himself hoarse, in fruitless efforts to
  explain, he was secured, and bound and gagged, within a shorter time than is
  required to describe it.</p>

  <p>This done, one of the freedmen looked toward his dreaded master, and
  asked, with pale lips, and a faltering voice,</p>

  <p>"Alive, Catiline?"</p>

  <p>"Alive&mdash;and hark you, Sirrah, fasten his head above the water, that
  he die not too speedily. Those biggest congers will lug him manfully,
  Cethegus; we will go see the sport, anon. It will serve to amuse us, after
  this disappointment. There! away with him, begone!"</p>

  <p>The miserable creature struggled desperately in his bonds, but in vain;
  and strove so terribly to speak, in despite his gag, that his face turned
  almost black, from the blood which rushed to every pore; but no sound could
  he utter, as he was dragged away, save a deep-mouthed groan, which was
  drowned by the laughter of the remorseless wretches, who gazed on his anguish
  with fiendish merriment; among which, hideous to relate, the thrilling sounds
  of Aurelia's silvery and contagious mirth were distinctly audible.</p>

  <p>"He will take care to see more truly in Hades!" said Catiline, with his
  sardonic smile, as he was dragged out of the room, by his appalled and
  trembling fellows. "But now to business. Tell me, did you display any weapon?
  or do aught, that can be proved, to show your intent on the Consul?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, my Catiline," replied Cethegus, firmly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, indeed, Cethegus? By all our hopes! deceive me not!"</p>

  <p>"By your head! nothing, Catiline."</p>

  <p>"Then I care nothing for the failure!" answered the other. "Keep good
  hearts, and wear smiling faces! I will kill him myself to-morrow, if, like
  the scorpion, I must die in the deed."</p>

  <p>"Try it not, Catiline. You will but fail&mdash;and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Fail! who ever knew me fail, in vengeance?"</p>

  <p>"No one!" said Orestilla&mdash;"and no one can hinder you of it. No! not
  the Gods!"</p>

  <p>"There are no Gods!" exclaimed the Traitor, "and if there be, it were all
  one&mdash;I defy them!"</p>

  <p>"Cicero says there is ONE, they tell me," said Cethegus, half mocking,
  half in earnest&mdash;"and he is very wise."</p>

  <p>"Very!" replied the other, with his accustomed sneer&mdash;"Therefore that
  ONE may save him&mdash;if he can!"</p>

  <p>"The thing is settled," cried Aurelia Orestilla, "I told him yesterday he
  ought to do it, himself&mdash;I should not be content, unless Catiline's hand
  dealt him the death blow, Catiline's eye gloated upon him in the
  death-struggle, Catiline's tongue jeered him in the death-pang!"</p>

  <p>"You love him dearly, Orestilla," said Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"And clearly he has earned it," she replied.</p>

  <p>"By Venus! I would give half my hopes, to see him kiss you."</p>

  <p>"And I, if my lips had the hydra's venom. But come," she added, with a
  wreathed smile and a beaming eye, "Let us go see the fishes eat yon varlet;
  else shall we be too late for the sport."</p>

  <p>"Rare sport!" said Cethegus, "I have not seen a man eaten, by a tiger
  even, these six months past; and by a fish, I think, never!"</p>

  <p>"The fish do it better," replied Catiline&mdash;"Better, and
  cleaner&mdash;they leave the prettiest skeleton you can imagine&mdash;they
  are longer about it, you will say&mdash;True; but I do not grudge the
  time."</p>

  <p>"No! no! the longer, the merrier!" said Aurelia, laughing
  melodiously&mdash;"The last fellow I saw given to the tigers, had his head
  crushed like a nut-shell, by a single blow. He had not time to shriek even
  once. There was no fun in that, you know."</p>

  <p>"None indeed," said Cethegus&mdash;"but I warrant you this German will
  howl gloriously, when the fish are at him." "Yes! yes!" exclaimed the lovely
  woman, clapping her hands joyously. "We must have the gag removed, to give
  free vent to his music. Come, come, I am dying to see him."</p>

  <p>"Some one must die, since Cicero did not."</p>

  <p>"Happy fellow this, if he only knew it, to give his friends so much
  pleasure!"</p>

  <p>"One of them such a fair lady too!"</p>

  <p>"Will there be more pleasure, think you, in seeing the congers eat the
  gladiator, or in eating the congers afterward?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! no comparison! one can eat fat congers always."</p>

  <p>"We have the advantage of them truly, for they cannot always eat fat
  gladiators."</p>

  <p>And they walked away with as much glee and expectation, to the scene of
  agony and fiendish torture, vitiated by the frightful exhibitions of the
  circus and the arena, as men in modern days would feel, in going to enjoy the
  fictitious sorrows of some grand tragedian.</p>

  <p>Can it be that the contemplation of human wo, in some form or other, is in
  all ages grateful to poor corrupt humanity?</p>

  <h2><a id="ch205"
     name="ch205"></a>V. &mdash; THE ORATION</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>Quo usque tandem abutere...</i>
     &mdash;Cicero.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE Senate was assembled in the great temple on the
  Palatine, built on the spot where Jupiter, thence hailed as Stator, had
  stayed the tide of flight, and sent the rallied Romans back to a glorious
  triumph.</p>

  <p>A cohort was stationed on the brow of the hill, its spear-heads glancing
  in the early sunshine.</p>

  <p>The Roman knights, wearing their swords openly, and clad in their girded
  tunics only, mustered around the steps which led to the colonnade and doors
  of the temple, a voluntary guard to the good consul.</p>

  <p>A mighty concourse had flowed together from all quarters of the city, and
  stood in dense masses in all the neighboring streets, and in the area of the
  temple, in hushed and anxious expectation.</p>

  <p>The tribunes of the people, awed for once by the imminence of the peril,
  forgot to be factious.</p>

  <p>Within the mighty building, there was dead silence&mdash;silence more
  eloquent than words.</p>

  <p>For, to the wonder of all men, undismayed by detection, unrebuked by the
  horror and hate which frowned on him from every brow, Catiline had assumed
  his place on the benches of his order.</p>

  <p>Not one, even of his most intimate associates, had dared to salute him;
  not one, even of the conspirators, had dared to recognize the manifest
  traitor.</p>

  <p>As he assumed his place, the senators next to him had arisen and withdrawn
  from the infamous vicinity, some of them even shaking their gowns, as if to
  dissipate the contamination of his contact.</p>

  <p>Alone he sat, therefore, with a wide vacant space around him&mdash;alone,
  in that crowded house&mdash;alone, yet proud, unrebuked, undaunted.</p>

  <p>The eyes of every man in the vast assembly were riveted in fear, or
  hatred, or astonishment, on the set features and sullen scowling brow, of the
  arch conspirator.</p>

  <p>Thus sat they, thus they gazed for ten minutes' space, and so deep was the
  all-absorbing interest, that none observed the Consul, who had arisen to his
  feet before the curule chair, until the great volume of his clear sonorous
  voice rolled over them, like the burst of sudden thunder amid the hush of
  nature which precedes it.</p>

  <p>It was to no set form of words, to no premeditated speech, that he gave
  utterance; nor did he in the usual form address the Conscript Fathers.</p>

  <p>With his form drawn to its fullest height, his arm outstretched as if it
  was about to launch the thunderbolt, he hurled his impassioned indignation
  against the fearless culprit.</p>

  <p>"Until how long, O Catiline, wilt thou abuse our patience? Until how long,
  too, will thy frantic fury baffle us? Unto what extremity will thy unbridled
  insolence display itself? Do the nocturnal guards upon the Palatine nothing
  dismay you, nothing the watches through the city, nothing the terrors of the
  people, nothing the concourse hitherward of all good citizens, nothing this
  most secure place for the senate's convocation, nothing the eyes and faces of
  all these?" And at the words, he waved both arms slowly around, pointing the
  features and expression of every senator, filled with awe and aversion.</p>

  <p>"Dost thou not feel that all thy plots are manifest? Not see that thy
  conspiracy was grasped irresistibly, so soon as it was known thoroughly to
  all these? Which of us dost thou imagine ignorant of what thou didst, where
  thou wert, whom thou didst convoke, what resolution thou didst take last
  night, and the night yet preceding? Oh! ye changed Times! Oh, ye degenerate
  customs! The Senate comprehends these things, the Consul sees them! Yet this
  man lives! Lives, did I say? Yea, indeed, comes into the Senate, bears a part
  in the public councils, marks out with his eyes and selects every one of us
  for slaughter. But we, strenuous brave men, imagine that we do our duty to
  the state, so long as we escape the frenzy, the daggers of that villain. Long
  since it had been right, Catiline, that thou shouldst have been led to death
  by the Consul's mandate&mdash;Long since should that doom have been turned
  upon thyself, which thou hast been so long devising for all of us here
  present. Do I err, saying this? or did that most illustrious man, Publius
  Scipio, pontifex maximus, when in no magisterial office, take off Tiberius
  Gracchus, for merely disturbing the established order of the state? And shall
  we, Consuls, endure Catiline aiming to devastate the world with massacre and
  conflagration? For I omit to state, as too ancient precedents, how Caius
  Servilius Ahala slew with his own hand Spurius Melius, when plotting
  revolution! There was, there was, of old, that energy of virtue in this
  commonwealth, that brave men hedged the traitorous citizen about with heavier
  penalties than the most deadly foe! We hold a powerful and weighty decree of
  the Senate against thee, O Catiline. Neither the counsel nor the sanction of
  this order have been wanting to the republic. We, we, I say it openly, we
  Consuls are wanting in our duty.</p>

  <p>"The Senate decreed once, that Lucius Opimius, then Consul, should see
  THAT THE REPUBLIC TOOK NO HARM; not one night intervened. Caius Gracchus was
  slain on mere suspicions of sedition, the son of a most noble father, most
  noble grandfather, most noble ancestry. Marcus Fulvius, a consular, was slain
  with both his children. By a like decree of the Senate, the charge of the
  republic was committed to Caius Marius and Lucius Valerius, the
  Consuls&mdash;did the republic's vengeance delay the death of Lucius
  Saterninus, a tribune of the people, of Caius Servilius, a praetor, even a
  single day? And yet, we Consuls, suffer the edge of this authority to be
  blunted, until the twentieth day. For we have such a decree of the Senate,
  but hidden in the scroll which contains it, as a sword undrawn in its
  scabbard. By which decree it were right, O Catiline, that thou shouldst have
  been slaughtered on the instant. Thou livest; and livest not to lay aside,
  but to confirm and strengthen thine audacity. I desire, O Conscript fathers,
  to <i>be</i> merciful; I desire, too, in such jeopardy of the republic, not
  to <i>seem</i> culpably neglectful. Yet I condemn myself of inability, of
  utter weakness. There is a camp in Italy! hostile to the republic, in the
  defiles that open on Etruria! Daily the numbers of the foe are increasing!
  And yet the general of that camp, the leader of that foe, we see within the
  walls, aye, even in the Senate, day by day, plotting some intestine blow
  against the state. Were I to order thee to be arrested, to be slain now, O
  Catiline, I should have cause, I think, to dread the reproaches of <i>all</i>
  good citizens, for having stricken thee too late, rather than that of
  <i>one</i>, for having stricken thee too severely. And yet, that which should
  have been done long ago, I am not yet for a certain reason persuaded to do
  now. Then&mdash;then at length&mdash;will I slay thee, when there is not a
  man so base, so desperately wicked, so like to thee in character, but he
  shall own thy slaying just. So long as there shall be one man, who dares to
  defend thee, thou shalt live. And thou shalt live, as now thou livest, beset
  on every side by numerous, and steady guards, so that thou canst not even
  stir against the commonwealth. The eyes moreover, and the ears of many, even
  as heretofore, shall spy thee out at unawares, and mount guard on thee in
  private.</p>

  <p>"For what is there, Catiline, which thou now canst expect more, if neither
  night with all its darkness, could conceal thy unholy meetings, nor even the
  most private house contain within its walls the voice of thy conspiracy? If
  all thy deeds shine forth, burst into public view? Change now that hideous
  purpose, take me along as thy adviser, forget thy schemes of massacre, of
  conflagration. Thou art hemmed in on every side. Thy every council is more
  clear to me than day; and these thou canst now review with me. Dost thou
  remember, how I stated in the Senate, on the twelfth day before the Calends
  of November(21), that Caius Manlius, the satellite and co-minister of thy
  audacity, would be in arms on a given day, which day would be the sixth (22)
  before the Calends of November?&mdash;Did I err, Catiline, not in the fact,
  so great as it was, so atrocious, so incredible, but, what is much more
  wondrous, in the very day? Again I told thee in the Senate, that thou hadst
  conspired to slay the first men of the state, on the fifth (23) day before
  the Calends of November, when many leading men of Rome quitted the city, not
  so much to preserve their lives, as to mar thy councils. Canst thou deny that
  thou wert hemmed in on that day by my guards, and hindered by my vigilance
  from stirring thy hand against the state, when, frustrate by the departure of
  the rest, thou saidst that our blood, ours who had remained behind, would
  satisfy thee? What? When thou wert so confident of seizing Praeneste, by
  nocturnal escalade, upon the very (24) Calends of November, didst thou not
  feel that it was by my order that colony was garrisoned, guarded, watched,
  impregnable?&mdash;Thou doest nothing, plottest nothing, thinkest nothing
  which I shall not&mdash;I say not&mdash;hear&mdash;but shall not see, shall
  not conspicuously comprehend.</p>

  <p class="footnote">21. The 21st of October.<br>
  22 The 27th of October.<br>
  33 The 28th of October<br>
  24 The first of November.</p><br>

  <p>"Review with me now, the transactions of the night before the last, so
  shalt thou understand that I watch far more vigilantly for the safety, than
  thou for the destruction of the state. I say that on that former (25) night,
  thou didst go to the street of the Scythemakers, I will speak plainly, to the
  house of Marcus Laeca; that thou didst meet there many of thy associates in
  crime and madness. Wilt thou dare to deny it? Why so silent? If thou deniest,
  I will prove it. For I see some of those here, here in the Senate, who were
  with thee. Oh! ye immortal Gods! in what region of the earth do we dwell? in
  what city do we live? of what republic are we citizens? Here! they are here,
  in the midst of us, Conscript Fathers, here in this council, the most sacred,
  the most solemn of the universal world, who are planning the slaughter of
  myself, the slaughter of you all, planning the ruin of this city, and therein
  the ruin of the world. I the consul, see these men, and ask their opinions on
  state matters. Nay, those whom it were but justice to slaughter with the
  sword, I refrain as yet from wounding with a word. Thou wert therefore in the
  house of Laeca, on that night, O Catiline. Thou didst allot the districts of
  Italy; thou didst determine whither each one of thy followers should set
  forth; thou didst choose whom thou wouldst lead along with thee, whom leave
  behind; thou didst assign the wards of the city for conflagration; thou didst
  assert that ere long thou wouldst go forth in person; thou saidst there was
  but one cause why thou shouldst yet delay a little, namely, that I was alive.
  Two Roman knights were found, who offered themselves to liberate thee from
  that care, and promised that they would butcher me, that very night, a little
  before daylight, in my own bed. Of all these things I was aware, when your
  assembly was scarce yet broken up. I strengthened my house, and guarded it
  with an unwonted garrison. I refused admittance to those whom thou hadst sent
  to salute me, when they arrived; even as I had predicted to many eminent men
  that they would arrive, and at that very time.</p>

  <p class="footnote">25. The 6th of November. This oration was delivered on
  the 8th.</p>

  <p>"Since then these things stand thus, O Catiline, proceed as thou hast
  begun; depart when thou wilt from the city; the gates are open; begone; too
  long already have those camps of Manlius lacked their general. Lead forth,
  with the morrow, all thy men&mdash;if not all, as many at least as thou art
  able; purify the city of thy presence. Thou wilt discharge me from great
  terror, so soon as a wall shall be interposed between thee and me. Dwell
  among us thou canst now no longer. I will not endure, I will not suffer, I
  will not permit it! Great thanks must be rendered to the immortal Gods, and
  to this Stator Jove, especially, the ancient guardian of this city, that we
  have escaped so many times already this plague, so foul, so horrible, so
  fraught with ruin to the republic. Not often is the highest weal of a state
  jeoparded in the person of a single individual. So long as you plotted
  against me, merely as Consul elect, O Catiline, I protected myself, not by
  public guards, but by private diligence. When at the late Comitia, thou
  wouldst have murdered me, presiding as Consul in the Field of Mars, with thy
  competitors, I checked thy nefarious plans, by the protection and force of my
  friends, without exciting any public tumult.&mdash;In a word, as often as
  thou hast thrust at me, myself have I parried the blow, although I perceived
  clearly, that my fall was conjoined with dread calamity to the republic. Now,
  now, thou dost strike openly at the whole commonwealth, the dwellings of the
  city; dost summon the temples of the Immortal Gods, the lives of all
  citizens, in a word, Italy herself, to havoc and perdition.
  Wherefore&mdash;seeing that as yet, I dare not do what should be my first
  duty, what is the ancient and peculiar usage of this state, and in accordance
  with the discipline of our fathers&mdash;I will, at least, do that which in
  respect to security is more lenient, in respect to the common good, more
  useful. For should I command thee to be slain, the surviving band of thy
  conspirators would settle down in the republic; but if&mdash;as I have been
  long exhorting thee, thou wilt go forth, the vast and pestilent contamination
  of thy comrades will be drained out of the city. What is this, Catiline? Dost
  hesitate to do that, for my bidding, which of thine own accord thou wert
  about doing? The Consul commands the enemy to go forth from the state. Dost
  thou enquire of me, whether into exile? I do not order, but, if thou wilt
  have my counsel, I advise it.</p>

  <p>"For what is there, O Catiline, that can delight thee any longer in this
  city, in which there is not one man, without thy band of desperadoes, who
  does not fear, not one who does not hate thee?&mdash;What brand of domestic
  turpitude is not burnt in upon thy life? What shame of private bearing clings
  not to thee, for endless infamy? What scenes of impure lust, what deeds of
  daring crime, what horrible pollution attaches not to thy whole
  career?&mdash;To what young man, once entangled in the meshes of thy
  corruption, hast thou not tendered the torch of licentiousness, or the steel
  of murder? Must I say more? Even of late, when thou hadst rendered thy house
  vacant for new nuptials, by the death of thy late wife, didst thou not
  overtop that hideous crime, by a crime more incredible? which I pass over,
  and permit willingly to rest in silence, lest it be known, that in this
  state, guilt so enormous has existed, and has not been punished. I pass over
  the ruin of thy fortunes, which all men know to be impending on the next Ides
  (26), I proceed to those things which pertain not to the private infamy of
  thy career, not to thy domestic difficulties and baseness, but to the supreme
  safety of the state, and to the life and welfare of us all. Can the light of
  this life, the breath of this heaven, be grateful to thee, Catiline, when
  thou art conscious that not one of these but knows how thou didst stand armed
  in the comitium, on the day previous (27) to the calends of January, when
  Lepidus and Tullus were the Consuls? That thou hadst mustered a band of
  assassins to slay the Consuls, and the noblest of the citizens? That no
  relenting of thy heart, no faltering from fear, opposed thy guilt and frenzy,
  but the wonted good fortune of the commonwealth? And now I pass from these
  things, for neither are these crimes not known to all, nor have there not
  been many more recently committed. How many times hast not thou thrust at me
  while elect, how many times when Consul? How many thrusts of thine so nearly
  aimed, that they appeared inevitable; have I not shunned by a slight
  diversion, and, as they say of gladiators, by the movements of my body? Thou
  doest nothing, attemptest nothing, plannest nothing, which can escape my
  knowledge, at the moment, when I would know it. Yet thou wilt neither cease
  from endeavoring nor from plotting. How many times already hath that dagger
  been wrested from thy hand? how many times hath it fallen by chance, and
  escaped thy grasp? Still thou canst not be deprived of it, more than an
  instant's space!&mdash;And yet, I know not with what unhallowed rites it has
  been consecrated and devoted by thee, that thou shouldst deem it necessary to
  flesh it in the body of a Consul.</p>

  <p class="footnote">26. The 13th of November.<br>
  27 The 31st of December.</p>

  <p>"Now then, what life is this of thine? For I will now address thee, not so
  that I may seem moved by that detestation which I feel toward thee, but by
  compassion, no portion of which is thy due. But a moment since, thou didst
  come into the Senate, and which one man, from so vast a concourse, from thine
  own chosen and familiar friends, saluted thee? If this has befallen no one,
  within the memory of man, wilt thou await loud contumely, condemned already
  by the most severe sentence of this silence? What wouldst thou have, when all
  those seats around thee were left vacant on thy coming? When all those
  Consulars, whom thou so frequently hadst designated unto slaughter, as soon
  as thou didst take thy seat, left all that portion of the benches bare and
  vacant? With what spirit, in one word, can thou deem this endurable? By
  Hercules! did my slaves so dread me, as all thy fellow citizens dread thee, I
  should conceive it time for leaving my own house&mdash;dost thou not hold it
  time to leave this city?&mdash;And if I felt myself without just cause
  suspected, and odious to my countrymen, I should choose rather to be beyond
  the reach of their vision, than to be gazed upon by hostile eyes of all men.
  Dost thou hesitate, when conscious of thine own crimes thou must acknowledge
  that the hate of all is just, and due long ago&mdash;dost thou, I say,
  hesitate to avoid the presence and the sight of those whose eyes and senses
  thine aspect every day is wounding? If thine own parents feared and hated
  thee, and could by no means be reconciled, thou wouldst, I presume, withdraw
  thyself some-whither beyond the reach of their eyes&mdash;now thy country,
  which is the common parent of us all, dreads and detests thee, and has passed
  judgment on thee long ago, as meditating nothing but her parricide. Wilt thou
  now neither revere her authority, nor obey her judgment, nor yet dread her
  violence? Since thus she now deals with thee, Catiline, thus speaks to thee
  in silence.</p>

  <p>"'No deed of infamy hath been done in these many years, unless through
  thee&mdash;no deed of atrocity without thee&mdash;to thee alone, the murder
  of many citizens, to thee alone the spoliation and oppression of our allies,
  hath been free and unpunished. Thou hast been powerful not only to escape
  laws and prosecutions, but openly to break through and overturn them. To
  these things, though indeed intolerable, I have submitted as best I
  might&mdash;but it can now no longer be endured that I should be in one
  eternal dread of thee only&mdash;that Catiline, on what alarm soever, alone
  should be the source of terror&mdash;that no treason against me can be
  imagined, such as should be revolting to thy desperate criminality. Wherefore
  begone, and liberate me from this terror, so that, if true, I may not be
  ruined; if false I may at least shake with fear no longer.'</p>

  <p>"If thy country should thus, as I have said, parley with thee, should she
  not obtain what she demands, even if she lack force to compel it? What more
  shall I say, when thou didst offer thyself to go into some private custody?
  What, when to shun suspicion, thou didst profess thy willingness to take up
  thy residence under the roof of Manius Lepidus? Refused by whom, thou hadst
  audacity to come to me, and request that I would admit thee to my house. And
  when thou didst receive from me this answer, that I could not exist within
  the same house with that man, whose presence even inside the same city walls,
  I esteemed vast peril to my life, thou didst then go to the praetor Quintus
  Metellus; and, then, repulsed by him, to Marcus Marcellus, thine own comrade,
  a virtuous man truly, one whom past doubt thou didst deem likely to be most
  vigilant in guarding, most crafty in suspecting, most strenuous in bringing
  thee to justice. And how far shall that man be believed distant from
  deserving chains and a dungeon, who judges himself to be worthy of
  safekeeping?&mdash;Since, then, these things are so, dost hesitate, O
  Catiline, since here thou canst not tarry with an equal mind, to depart for
  some other land, and give that life, rescued from many just and deserved
  penalties, to solitude and exile? 'Lay the matter,' thou sayest, 'before the
  Senate,' for that it is which thou requirest, 'and if this order shall
  command thee into banishment, thou wilt obey their bidding.' I will not lay
  it before them&mdash;for to do so is repugnant to my character, yet I will so
  act, that thou shalt clearly see what these think of thee. Depart from the
  city, Catiline! Deliver the state from terror! begone into banishment, if
  that be the word for which thou tarriest!"</p>

  <p>Then the great Orator paused once again, not to breathe, though the
  vehement and uninterrupted torrent of his eloquence, might well have required
  an interval of rest, but to give the confounded listener occasion to note the
  feelings of the assembled Senate, perfectly in accordance with his words.</p>

  <p>It was but a moment, however, that he paused, and, that ended, again burst
  out the thunderous weight of his magnificent invective.</p>

  <p>"What means this, Catiline? Dost thou note these, dost thou observe their
  silence? They permit my words, they are mute. Why dost thou wait that
  confirmation of their words, which thou seest given already by their silence?
  But had I spoken these same words to that admirable youth Publius Sextius, or
  to that very valiant man, Marcus Marcellus, I tell thee that this very Senate
  would have, already, in this very temple, laid violent hands on me, the
  Consul, and that too most justly! But with regard to thee, when quiescent
  they approve, when passive they decree, when mute they cry aloud! Nor these
  alone, whose authority it seems is very dear, whose life most cheap, in your
  eyes, but all those Roman knights do likewise, most honorable and most worthy
  men, and all those other valiant citizens, who stand about the Senate house,
  whose dense ranks thou couldst see, whose zeal thou couldst discover, whose
  patriotic cries thou couldst hear, but a little while ago; whose hands and
  weapons I have scarcely, for a long time, restrained from thee, whom I will
  yet induce to escort thee to the gates of Rome, if thou wilt leave this city,
  which thou hast sought so long to devastate and ruin.</p>

  <p>"And yet what say I? Can it be hoped that anything should ever bend thee?
  that thou shouldst ever be reformed? that thou shouldst dream of any flight?
  that thou shouldst contemplate any exile? Would, would indeed that the
  immortal Gods might give thee such a purpose! And yet I perceive, if
  astounded by my voice thou shouldst bend thy spirit to go into voluntary
  exile, how vast a storm of odium would hang over me, if not at this present
  time, when the memory of thy villanies is recent, at least from the passions
  of posterity. But to me it is worth this sacrifice, so that the storm burst
  on my individual head, and be connected with no perils to the state. But that
  thou shouldst be moved by thine own vices, that thou shouldst dread the
  penalties of the law, that thou shouldst yield to the exigences of the
  republic, this indeed is not to be expected; for thou art not such an one, O
  Catiline, that any sense of shame should ever recall thee from infamy, any
  sense of fear from peril, any glimmering of reason from insanity. Wherefore,
  as I have said many times already, go forth from among us; and if thou
  wouldst stir up against me, as constantly thou sayest, against me thine enemy
  a storm of enmity and odium, then begone straightway into exile. Scarcely
  shall I have power to endure the clamors of the world, scarcely shall I have
  power to sustain the burthen of that odium, if thou wilt but go into
  voluntary banishment, now, at the consul's bidding. If, on the contrary, thou
  wouldst advance my glory and my reputation, then go forth with thy lawless
  band of ruffians! Betake thyself to Manlius! stir up the desperate citizens
  to arms! withdraw thyself from all good men! levy war on thy country! exult
  in unhallowed schemes of robbery and murder, so that thou shalt not pass for
  one driven forth by my tyranny into the arms of strangers, but for one
  joining by invitation his own friends and comrades. Yet why should I invite
  thee, when I well know that thy confederates are sent forth already, who nigh
  Forum Aurelium shall wait in arms for your arrival? When I well know that
  thou hast already a day promised and appointed whereon to join the camp of
  Manlius? When I well know that the silver eagle hath been prepared
  already&mdash;the silver eagle which will, I trust, prove ruinous and fatal
  to thee and all thine host, to which a shrine has been established in thine
  own house, thy villanies its fitting incense? For how shalt thou endure its
  absence any longer, thou who wert wont to adore it, setting forth to
  sacrilege and slaughter, thou who so often hast upraised that impious right
  hand of thine from its accursed altars to murder citizens of Rome?</p>

  <p>"At length, then, at length, thou must go forth, whither long since thy
  frantic and unbridled passions have impelled thee. Nor shall this war against
  thy country vex or afflict thee. Nay, rather shall it bring to thee a strange
  and unimaginable pleasure, for to this frantic career did nature give thee
  birth, to this hath thine own inclination trained, to this, fortune preserved
  thee&mdash;for never hast thou wished&mdash;I say not peaceful
  leisure&mdash;but war itself, unless that war were sacrilegious. Thou hast
  drawn together from the most infamous of wretches, wretches abandoned not
  only by all fortune, but all hope, a bodyguard of desperadoes! Among these
  what pleasure wilt thou not experience, in what bliss not exult, in what
  raptures not madly revel, when thou shalt neither see nor hear one virtuous
  man in such a concourse of thy comrades? To this, this mode of life tended
  all those strenuous toils of thine, which are so widely talked of&mdash;to
  lie on the bare ground, not lying in wait merely for some occasion of
  adultery, but for some opportunity of daring crime! To watch through the
  night, not plotting merely against the sleep of betrayed husbands, but
  against the property of murdered victims! Now, then, thou hast a notable
  occasion for displaying those illustrious qualities of thine, that wonderful
  endurance of hunger, of cold, of destitution, by which ere long thou shalt
  feel thyself undone, and ruined. This much, however, I did accomplish, when I
  defeated thee in the comitia, that thou shouldst strike at the republic as an
  exile, rather than ravage it as a consul; and that the warfare, so
  villanously evoked by thee, should be called rather the struggle of a base
  banditti, than the fair strife of warriors.</p>

  <p>"Now, Conscript Fathers, that I may solemnly abjure and deprecate the just
  reproaches of my country, listen, I pray you, earnestly to what I say, and
  commit it deeply to your memories and minds. For if my country, who is much
  dearer to me than my life, if all Italy, if the whole commonwealth should
  thus expostulate with me, 'What dost thou, Marcus Tullius? Him, whom thou
  hast proved to be my enemy, whom thou seest the future leader in the war
  against me, whom thou knowest even now the expected general in the camp of my
  foes&mdash;him, the author of every crime, the head of this conspiracy, the
  summoner of insurgent slaves, and ruined citizens&mdash;him wilt thou suffer
  to go forth, and in such guise, that he shall not be as one banished from the
  walls, but rather as one let loose to war against the city? Wilt thou not,
  then, command that he shall be led away to prison, that he shall be hurried
  off to death, that he shall be visited with the last torments of the law?
  What is it, that dissuades thee? Is it the custom of thine ancestors? Not
  so&mdash;for many times in this republic have men, even in private stations,
  inflicted death on traitors!&mdash;Is it the laws, enacted, concerning the
  punishment of Roman citizens? Not so&mdash;for never, in this city, have
  rebels against the commonwealth been suffered to retain the rights of
  Citizens or Romans! Dost thou shrink from the odium of posterity? If it be
  so, in truth, thou dost repay great gratitude unto the Roman people, who hath
  elevated thee, a man known by thine own actions only, commended by no
  ancestral glory, so rapidly, through all the grades of honor, to this most
  high authority of consul; if in the fear of any future odium, if in the dread
  of any present peril, thou dost neglect the safety of the citizens! Again, if
  thou dost shrink from enmity, whether dost deem most terrible, that,
  purchased by a severe and brave discharge of duty, or that, by inability and
  shameful weakness? Or, once more, when all Italy shall be waste with civil
  war, when her towns shall be demolished, her houses blazing to the sky, dost
  fancy that thy good report shall not be then consumed in the fierce glare of
  enmity and odium?'</p>

  <p>"To these most solemn appeals of my country, and to the minds of those men
  who think in likewise, I will now make brief answer. Could I have judged it
  for the best, O Conscript Fathers, that Catiline should have been done to
  death, then would I not have granted one hour's tenure of existence to that
  gladiator. For if the first of men, noblest of citizens, were graced, not
  polluted, by the blood of Saturninus, and the Gracchi, and Flaccus, and many
  more in olden time, there surely is no cause why I should apprehend a burst
  of future odium for taking off this parricide of the republic. Yet if such
  odium did inevitably impend above me, I have ever been of this mind, that I
  regard that hatred which is earned by honorable duty not as reproach, but
  glory! Yet there are some in this assembly, who either do not see the perils
  which are imminent above us, or seeing deny their eyesight. Some who have
  nursed the hopes of Catiline by moderate decrees; and strengthened this
  conspiracy from its birth until now, by disbelieving its existence&mdash;and
  many more there are, not of the wicked only, but of the inexperienced, who,
  if I should do justice upon this man, would raise a cry that I had dealt with
  him cruelly, and as a regal tyrant.</p>

  <p>"Now I am well assured that, if he once arrive, whither he means to go, at
  the camp of Manlius, there will be none so blind as not to see the reality of
  this conspiracy, none so wicked as to deny it. But on the other hand, were
  this man slain, alone, I perceive that this ruin of the state might indeed be
  repressed for a season, but could not be suppressed for ever&mdash;while, if
  he cast himself forth, and lead his comrades with him, and gather to his host
  all his disbanded desperate outlaws, not only will this full grown pestilence
  of Rome be utterly extinguished and abolished, but the very seed and germ of
  all evil will be extirpated for ever.</p>

  <p>"For it is a long time, O Conscript Fathers, that we have been dwelling
  amid the perils and stratagems of this conspiracy. And I know not how it is
  that the ripeness of all crime, the maturity of ancient guilt and frenzy,
  hath burst to light at once during my consulship. But, this I know, that if
  from so vast a horde of assassins and banditti this man alone be taken off,
  we may perchance be relieved for some brief space, from apprehension and
  dismay, but the peril itself will strike inward, and settle down into the
  veins and vitals of the commonwealth. As oftentimes, men laboring under some
  dread disease, if, while tossing in feverish heat, they drink cold water,
  will seem indeed to be relieved for some brief space, but are thereafter much
  more seriously and perilously afflicted, so will this ulcer, which exists in
  the republic, if relieved by the cutting off this man, grow but the more
  inveterate, the others left alive. Wherefore, O Conscript Fathers, let the
  wicked withdraw themselves, let them retire from among the good, let them
  herd together in one place, let them, in one word, as often I have said
  before, be divided from us by the city wall. Let them cease to plot against
  the consul in his own house, to stand about the tribunal of the city praetor
  deterring him from justice, to beset even the senate house with swords, to
  prepare blazing brands and fiery arrows for the conflagration of the city.
  Let it, in one word, be borne as an inscription upon the brow of every
  citizen, what are his sentiments toward the republic. This I can promise you,
  O Conscript Fathers, that there shall be such diligence in us consuls, such
  valor in the Roman knights, such unanimity in all good citizens, that you
  shall see, Catiline once departed, all that is secret exposed, all that is
  dark brought to light, all that is dangerous put down, all that is guilty
  punished. Under these omens, Catiline, to the eternal welfare of the state,
  to thine own ruin and destruction, to the perdition of all those who have
  linked themselves with thee in this league of infamy and parricide, go forth
  to thine atrocious and sacrilegious warfare! And do thou Jove, who wert
  consecrated by Romulus under the same auspices with this city, whom we truly
  hail as the Stator, and supporter of this city, of this empire, chase forth
  this man, and this man's associates, from thine own altars, and from the
  shrines of other Gods, from the roofs and hearths of the city, from the lives
  and fortunes of the citizens, and consummate the solemn ruin of all enemies
  of the good, all foes of their country, all assassins of Italy, linked in one
  league of guilt and bond of infamy, living or dead, by thine eternal
  torments."</p>

  <p>The dread voice ceased&mdash;the terrible oration ended.</p>

  <p>And instantly with flushed cheek, and glaring eye, and the foam on his
  gnashed teeth, fierce, energetical, undaunted, Catiline sprang to his feet to
  reply.</p>

  <p>But a deep solemn murmur rose on all sides, deepening, swelling into a
  vast overwhelming conclamation&mdash;"Down with the Traitor&mdash;away with
  the Parricide!"</p>

  <p>But unchecked by this awful demonstration of the popular mind, he still
  raised his voice to its highest pitch, defying all, both gods and men, till
  again it was drowned by that appalling torrent of scorn and imprecation.</p>

  <p>Then, with a furious gesture, and a yelling voice that rose clear above
  all the din and clamor,</p>

  <p>"Since," he exclaimed, "my enemies will drive me headlong to destruction I
  will extinguish the conflagration which consumes me in their universal
  ruin!"</p>

  <p>And pursued by the yells, and groans, and curses of that great concourse,
  and hunted by wilder furies within his own dark soul, the baffled Traitor
  rushed precipitately homeward.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch206"
     name="ch206"></a>VI. &mdash; THE FLIGHT</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>Abiit, excessit, evasit, erupit.</i>
     &mdash;Cicero.</p><br>

  <p class="first">HIS heart was a living hell, as he rushed homeward. Cut off
  on every side, detected, contemned, hated, what was left to the Traitor?</p>

  <p>To retrace his steps was impossible,&mdash;nor, if possible, would his
  indomitable pride have consented to surrender his ambitious schemes, his
  hopes of vengeance.</p>

  <p>He rushed homeward; struck down a slave, who asked him some officious
  question; spurned Orestilla out of his way with a bitter earnest curse;
  barred himself up in his inmost chamber, and remained there alone one
  hour.</p>

  <p>One hour; but in that hour what years, what ages of time, what an eternity
  of agony, was concentrated!</p>

  <p>For once in many years he sat still, motionless, silent, while thought
  succeeded thought, and passion passion, with indescribable rapidity and
  vividness.</p>

  <p>In that one hour all the deeds of his life passed before him, from his
  wild and reckless boyhood to his atrocious and dishonored manhood.</p>

  <p>The victims of his fiendish passions seemed to fleet, one by one, before
  his eyes, with deathlike visages and ghastly menace.</p>

  <p>The noble virgin, whom he had first dishonored, scarcely as yet a boy,
  pointed with bloody fingers to the deep self-inflicted wound, which yawned in
  her snowy bosom.</p>

  <p>The vestal, who had broken through all bounds of virtue, piety, and honor,
  sacrificed soul and body to his unpitying lust, gazed at him with that
  unearthly terror in her eyes, which glared from them as they looked their
  last at earth and heaven, when she descended, young and lovely, into a living
  grave.</p>

  <p>The son, whom he had poisoned, to render his house vacant for unhallowed
  nuptials, with his whole frame convulsed in agony, and the sardonic grin of
  death on his writhing lips, frowned on him.</p>

  <p>His brother, who had drawn life from the same soft bosom, but whose
  kindred blood had pleaded vainly against the fratricidal dagger, frowned on
  him.</p>

  <p>His sister's husband, that mild and blameless knight, whose last breath
  was spent in words of peace and pardon to his slayer, now frowned on him.</p>

  <p>The stern impassive face of Marius Gratidianus, unmoved alike by agony or
  insult, frowned on him, in the serene dignity of sustaining virtue.</p>

  <p>Men of all ranks and ages, done to death by his hand or his head, by
  poison, by the knife, by drowning, by starvation&mdash;women deceived or
  violated, and then murdered, while their kisses were yet warm on his
  lips&mdash;infants tortured to death in the very wantonness of cruelty, and
  crime that must have been nigh akin to madness, gibbered, and glared upon
  him.</p>

  <p>These things would seem impossible, they are in truth incredible, but they
  are true beyond the possibility of cavil.</p>

  <p>He was indeed one of those unaccountable and extraordinary monsters, who,
  thanks to nature! appear but once in many ages, to whom sin is dear for its
  own naked self, to whom butchery is a pastime (28), and blood and agonies and
  tears a pleasurable excitement to their mad morbid appetites.</p>

  <p class="footnote">28. Let those who doubt this, think of Couthon and
  Carrier, Fouch and Marat, and Barere!</p>

  <p>And in this hour of downfall, one by one, did his fancy conjure up before
  him the victims of his merciless love, his merciless hatred&mdash;both alike,
  sure and deadly.</p>

  <p>It was a strange combination of mind, for there must have been in the
  spirit that evoked these phantoms of the conscience, something of remorse, if
  not of repentance. Pale, ghastly, grim, reproachful, they all seemed to him
  to be appealing to the just heavens for justice and revenge. Yet there was
  even more of triumph and proud self-gratulation in his mood, than of remorse
  for the past, or of apprehension for the future.</p>

  <p>As he thought of each, as he thought of all, he in some sort gloated over
  the memory of his success, in some sort derived confidence from the very
  number of his unpunished crimes.</p>

  <p>"They crossed me," he muttered to himself, "and where are they?&mdash;My
  fate cried out for their lives, and their lives were forfeit. Who ever stood
  in my path, that has not perished from before my face? Not one! Who ever
  strove with me, that has not fallen? who ever frowned upon me, that has not
  expiated the bended brow by the death-grin?&mdash;Not one! not one! Scores,
  hundreds, have died for thwarting me! but who of men has lived to boast of
  it!&mdash;Not one!"</p>

  <p>He rose from his seat, stalked slowly across the room, drew his hand
  across his brow twice, with a thoughtful gesture, and then said,</p>

  <p>"Cicero! Cicero! Better thou never hadst been born! Better&mdash;but it
  must be&mdash;my Fate, my fate demands it, and neither eloquence nor wisdom,
  virtue nor valor, shall avail to save thee. These were brave, beautiful,
  wise, pious, eloquent; and what availed it to them? My Fate, my fate shall
  prevail! To recede is to perish, is to be scorned&mdash;to advance is to
  win&mdash;to win universal empire," and he stretched out his hand, as if he
  clutched an imaginary globe&mdash;"to win fame, honor, the applause of
  ages&mdash;for with the people&mdash;the <i>dear</i> people&mdash;failure
  alone and poverty are guilt&mdash;success, by craft or crime, success is
  piety and virtue!&mdash;On! Catiline! thy path is onward still, upward, and
  onward! But not here!"</p>

  <p>Then he unbarred the door, "What ho, Chaerea!" and prompt, at the word,
  the freedman entered. "Send out my trustiest slaves, summon me hither
  instantly Lentulus and the rest of those, who supped here on the Calends. Ha!
  the Calends." He repeated the word, as if some new idea had struck him, on
  the mention of that day, and he paused thoughtfully. "Aye! Paullus Arvina! I
  had well nigh forgotten&mdash;I have it; Aulus is the man; he hath some
  private grudge at him! and beside those," he added, again addressing the
  freedman, "go thyself and bring Aulus Fulvius hither, the son of the
  Senator&mdash;him thou wilt find with Cethegus, the others at the house of
  Decius Brutus, near the forum. They dine with Sempronia. Get thee gone, and
  beshrew thy life! tarry not, or thou diest!"</p>

  <p>The man quitted the room in haste; and Catiline continued muttering to
  himself&mdash;"Aye! but for that cursed boy, we should have had Praeneste on
  the Calends! He shall repent it, ere he die, and he shall die too; but not
  yet&mdash;not till he is aweary of his very life, and then, by tortures that
  shall make the most weary life a boon. I have it all, the method, and the
  men! Weak fool, thou better hadst been mine."</p>

  <p>Then turning to the table he sat down, and wrote many letters, addressed
  to men of Consular dignity, persons of worth and honor, declaring that, borne
  down on all sides by false accusations, and helpless to oppose the faction of
  his enemies, he yielded to the spite of fortune, and was departing for
  Marseilles a voluntary exile, not conscious of any crime, but careful of the
  tranquillity of the republic, and anxious that no strife should arise from
  his private griefs.</p>

  <p>To one, who afterward, almost deceived by his profound and wonderful
  dissimulation, read it aloud in the Senate, in proof that no civil war was
  impending, he wrote:</p>

  <p>"Lucius Catiline to Quintus Catulus, sends health. Your most distinguished
  faith, known by experience, gives me in mighty perils a grateful confidence,
  thus to address you. Since I have resolved to prepare no defence in the new
  steps which I have taken, I am resolved to set forth my apology, conscious to
  myself of no crime, which&mdash;So may the God of Honor guard me!&mdash;you
  may rely upon as true. Goaded by injury and insult, robbed of the guerdon of
  my toils and industry, that state of dignity at which I aimed, I publicly
  have undertaken, according to my wont, the cause of the unhappy and
  oppressed; not because I am unable to pay all debts contracted on my own
  account, from my own property&mdash;from those incurred in behalf of others,
  the generosity of Orestilla and her daughter, by their treasures, would have
  released me&mdash;but because I saw men honored who deserve no honor, and
  felt myself disgraced, on false suspicion. On this plea, I now take measures,
  honorable in my circumstances, for preserving that dignity which yet remains
  to me. I would have written more, but I learn that violence is about to be
  offered me. Now I commend to you Orestilla, and trust her to your faith. As
  you love your own children, shield her from injury. Farewell."</p>

  <p>This strange letter, intended, as after events evidently proved, to bear a
  double sense, he had scarce sealed, when Aulus Fulvius was announced.</p>

  <p>For a few moments after he entered, Catiline continued writing; then
  handing Chaerea, who at a sign had remained in waiting, a list of many names,
  "Let them," he said, "be here, prepared for a journey, and in arms at the
  fifth hour. Prepare a banquet of the richest, ample for all these, in the
  Atrium; in the garden Triclinium, a feast for ten&mdash;the rarest meats, the
  choicest wines, the delicatest perfumes, the fairest slave-girls in most
  voluptuous attire. At the third hour! See to it! Get thee hence!"</p>

  <p>The freedman bowed low, and departed on his mission; then turning to the
  young patrician,</p>

  <p>"I have sent for you," he said, "the first, noble Aulus, because I hold
  you the first in honor, bravery, and action; because I believe that you will
  serve me truly, and to the utmost. Am I deceived?"</p>

  <p>"Catiline, you have judged aright."</p>

  <p>"And that you cannot serve me, more gratefully to yourself, than in
  avenging me on that young pedant, Paullus Arvina."</p>

  <p>The eyes of the youthful profligate flashed dark fire, and his whole face
  beamed with intense satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"By all the Powers of Tartarus!" he cried, "Show me but how, and I will
  hunt him to the gates of Hades!"</p>

  <p>Catiline nodded to him, with an approving smile, and after looking around
  him warily for a minute, as if fearful even of the walls' overhearing him, he
  stepped close up to him, and whispered in his ear, for several moments.</p>

  <p>"Do you conceive me, ha?" he said aloud, when he had ended.</p>

  <p>"Excellent well!" cried the other in rapturous triumph, "but how gain an
  opportunity?"</p>

  <p>"Look you, here is his signature, some trivial note or other, I kept it,
  judging that one day it might serve a purpose. You can write, I know, very
  cleverly&mdash;I have not forgotten Old Alimentus' will&mdash;write to her in
  his name, requesting her to visit him, with Hortensia, otherwise she will
  doubt the letter. Then you can meet her, and do as I have told you. Will not
  that pass, my Fulvius?"</p>

  <p>"It <i>shall</i> pass," answered the young man confidently. "My life on
  it! Rely on me!"</p>

  <p>"I hold it done already," returned Catiline, "But you comprehend
  all&mdash;unstained, in all honor, until she reach me; else were the
  vengeance incomplete."</p>

  <p>"It shall be so. But when?"</p>

  <p>"When best you can accomplish it. This night, I leave the city."</p>

  <p>"You leave the city!"</p>

  <p>"This night! at the sixth hour!"</p>

  <p>"But to return, Catiline?"</p>

  <p>"To return with a victorious, an avenging army! To return as destroyer!
  with a sword sharper than that of mighty Sylla, a torch hotter than that of
  the mad Ephesian! To return, Aulus, in such guise, that ashes and blood only
  show where Rome&mdash;<i>was</i>!"</p>

  <p>"But, ere that, I must join you?"</p>

  <p>"Aye! In the Appenines, at the camp of Caius Manlius"</p>

  <p>"Fear me not. The deed is accomplished&mdash;hatred and vengeance, joined
  to resolve, never fail."</p>

  <p>"Never! but lo, here come the rest. Not a word to one of these. The burly
  sword-smith is your man, and his fellows! Strike suddenly, and soon; and,
  till you strike, be silent. Ha! Lentulus, Cethegus, good friends
  all&mdash;welcome, welcome!" he cried, as they entered, eight in number, the
  ringleaders of the atrocious plot, grasping each by the hand. "I have called
  you to a council, a banquet, and, thence to action!"</p>

  <p>"Good things all," answered Lentulus, "so that the first be brief and
  bold, the second long and loud, the last daring and decisive!"</p>

  <p>"They shall be so, all three! Listen. This very night, I set forth to join
  Caius Manlius in his camp. Things work not here as I would have them; my
  presence keeps alive suspicion, terror, watchfulness. I absent, security will
  grow apace, and from that boldness, and from boldness, rashness! So will you
  find that opportunity, which dread of me, while present, delays fatally.
  Watch your time; choose your men; augment, by any means, the powers of our
  faction; gain over friends; get rid of enemies, secretly if you can; if not,
  audaciously. Destroy the Consul&mdash;you will soon find occasion, or, if not
  find, make it. Be ready with the blade and brand, to burn and to slaughter,
  so soon as my trumpets shall sound havoc from the hills of Fiesol. Metellus
  and his men, will be sent after me with speed; Marcius Rex will be ordered
  from the city, with his cohorts, to Capua, or Apulia, or the Picene district;
  for in all these, the slaves will rise, so soon as my Eagle soars above the
  Appenine. The heart of the city will then lie open to your daggers."</p>

  <p>"And they shall pierce it to the core," cried Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"Wisely you have resolved, my Catiline, as ever," said Longinus Cassius.
  "Go, and success sit upon your banners!"</p>

  <p>"Be not thou over slow, my Cassius, nor thou, Cethegus, over daring.
  Temper each one, the metal of the other. Let your counsels be, as the
  gathering of the storm-clouds, certain and slow; your deeds, as the
  thunderbolt, rash, rapid, irresistible!"</p>

  <p>"How will you go forth, Catiline? Alone? in secret?" asked Autronius.</p>

  <p>"No! by the Father of Quirinus! with my casque on my head, and my
  broad-sword on my thigh, and with three hundred of my clients at my back!
  They sup in my Atrium, at the fifth hour of the night, and at the sixth, we
  mount our horses. I <i>think</i> Cicero will not bar our passage."</p>

  <p>"By Mars! he would beat the gates down rather, to let you forth the more
  easily."</p>

  <p>"If he be wise he would."</p>

  <p>"He <i>is</i> wise," said Catiline. "Would God that he were less so."</p>

  <p>"To be overwise, is worse, sometimes, than to be foolish," answered
  Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"And to be over bold, worse than to be a coward!" said Catiline.
  "Therefore, Cethegus, be thou neither. Now, my friends, I do not say leave
  me, but excuse me, until the third hour, when we will banquet. Nay! go not
  forth from the house, I pray you; it may arouse suspicion, which I would have
  you shun. There are books in the library, for who would read; foils in the
  garden, balls in the fives-court, for who would breathe themselves before
  supper; and lastly, there are some fair slaves in the women's chamber, for
  who would listen to the lute, or kiss soft lips, and not unwilling. I have
  still many things to do, ere I depart."</p>

  <p>"And those done, a farewell caress to Orestilla," said Cethegus,
  laughing.</p>

  <p>"Aye! would I could take her with me."</p>

  <p>"Do you doubt her, then, that you fear to leave her?"</p>

  <p>"If I doubted, I would <i>not</i> leave her&mdash;or I would leave her
  <i>so</i>, as not to doubt her. Alexion himself, cannot in general cure the
  people, whom I doubt."</p>

  <p>"I hope you never will doubt me," said Curius, who was present, the Judas
  of the faction, endeavoring to jest; yet more than half feeling what he
  said.</p>

  <p>"I hope not"&mdash;replied Catiline, with a strange fixed glance, and a
  singular smile; for he did in truth, at that very moment, half doubt the
  speaker. "If I do, Curius, it will not be for long! But I must go," he added,
  "and make ready. Amuse yourselves as best you can, till I return to you.
  Come, Aulus Fulvius, I must speak with you farther."</p>

  <p>And, with the words, he left them, not indeed to apply themselves to any
  sport or pleasure, but to converse anxiously, eagerly, almost fearfully, on
  the events which were passing in succession, so rapid, and so unforeseen.
  Their souls were too much absorbed by one dominant idea, one devouring
  passion, to find any interest in any small or casual excitement.</p>

  <p>To spirits so absorbed, hours fly like minutes, and none of those guilty
  men were aware of the lapse of time, until Catiline returned, dressed in a
  suit of splendid armor, of blue Iberian steel, embossed with studs and
  chasings of pure silver, with a rich scarlet sagum over it, fringed with deep
  lace. His knees were bare, but his legs were defended by greaves of the same
  fabric and material with his corslet; and a slave bore behind him his bright
  helmet, triply crested with crimson horsehair, his oblong shield charged with
  a silver thunderbolt, and his short broad-sword of Bilboa steel, which was
  already in those days, as famous as in the middle ages. He looked, indeed,
  every inch a captain; and if undaunted valor, unbounded energy, commanding
  intellect, an eye of lightning, unequalled self-possession, endless resource,
  incomparable endurance of cold, heat, hunger, toil, watchfulness, and
  extremity of pain, be qualities which constitute one, then was he a great
  Captain.</p>

  <p>A captain well formed to lead a host of demons.</p>

  <p>The banquet followed, with all that could gratify the eye, the ear, the
  nostril, or the palate. The board blazed with lights, redoubled by the glare
  of gold and crystal. Flowers, perfumes, incense, streamed over all, till the
  whole atmosphere was charged with voluptuous sweetness. The softest music
  breathed from the instruments of concealed performers. The rarest wines
  flowed like water. And flashing eyes, and wreathed smiles, and bare arms, and
  bare bosoms, and most voluptuous forms, decked to inflame the senses of the
  coldest, were prodigal of charms and soft abandonment.</p>

  <p>No modest pen may describe the orgies that ensued,&mdash;the drunkenness,
  the lust, the frantic mirth, the unnatural mad revelry. There was but one at
  that banquet, who, although he drank more deeply, rioted more sensually,
  laughed more loudly, sang more wildly, than any of the guests, was yet as
  cool amid that terrible scene of excitement, as in the council chamber, as on
  the battle field.</p>

  <p>His sallow face flushed not; his hard clear eye swam not languidly, nor
  danced with intoxication; his voice quivered not; his pulse was as slow, as
  even as its wont. That man's frame, like his soul, was of trebly tempered
  steel.</p>

  <p>Had Catiline not been the worst, he had been the greatest of Romans.</p>

  <p>But his race in Rome was now nearly ended. The water-clocks announced the
  fifth hour; and leaving the more private triclinium, in which the ringleaders
  alone had feasted, followed by his guests,&mdash;who were flushed, reeling,
  and half frenzied,&mdash;with a steady step, a cold eye, and a presence like
  that of Mars himself, the Arch Traitor entered the great open hall, wherein
  three hundred of his clients, armed sumptuously in the style of legionary
  horsemen, had banqueted magnificently, though they had stopped short of the
  verge of excess.</p>

  <p>All rose to their feet, as Catiline entered, hushed in dread
  expectation.</p>

  <p>He stood for one moment, gazing on his adherents, tried veterans every man
  of them, case-hardened in the furnace of Sylla's fiery discipline, with proud
  confidence and triumph in his eye; and then addressed them in clear high
  tones, piercing as those of an adamantine trumpet.</p>

  <p>"Since," he said, "it is permitted to us neither to live in Rome securely,
  nor to die in Rome honorably, I go forth&mdash;will you follow me?"</p>

  <p>And, with an unanimous cry, as it had been the voice of one man, they
  answered,</p>

  <p>"To the death, Catiline!"</p>

  <p>"I go forth, harming no one, hating no one, fearing no one! Guiltless of
  all, but of loving the people! Goaded to ruin by the proud patricians,
  injured, insulted, well nigh maddened, I go forth to seek, not power nor
  revenge, but innocence and safety. If they will leave me peace, the lamb
  shall be less gentle; if they will drive me into war, the famished lion shall
  be tamer. Soldiers of Sylla, will you have Sylla's friend in peace for your
  guardian, in war for your captain?"</p>

  <p>And again, in one tumultuous shout, they replied, "In peace, or in war,
  through life, and unto death, Catiline!"</p>

  <p>"Behold, then, your Eagle!"&mdash;and, with the word, he snatched from a
  marble slab on which it lay, covered by tapestry, the silver bird of Mars,
  hovering with expanded wings over a bannered staff, and brandished it on
  high, in triumph. "Behold your standard, your omen, and your God! Swear, that
  it shall shine yet again above Rome's Capitol!"</p>

  <p>Every sword flashed from its scabbard, every knee was bent; and kneeling,
  with the bright blades all pointed like concentric sunbeams toward that
  bloody idol, in deep emotion, and deep awe, they swore to be true to the
  Eagle, traitors to Rome, parricides to their country.</p>

  <p>"One cup of wine, and then to horse, and to glory!"</p>

  <p>The goblets were brimmed with the liquid madness; they were quaffed to the
  very dregs; they clanged empty upon the marble floor.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes more, and the hall was deserted; and mounted on proud horses,
  brought suddenly together, by a perfect combination of time and place, with
  the broad steel heads of their javelins sparkling in the moonbeams, and the
  renowned eagle poised with bright wings above them, the escort of the Roman
  Traitor rode through the city streets, at midnight, audacious, in full
  military pomp, in ordered files, with a cavalry clarion timing their steady
  march&mdash;rode unresisted through the city gates, under the eyes of a Roman
  cohort, to try the fortunes of civil war in the provinces, frustrate of
  massacre and conflagration in the capitol.</p>

  <p>Cicero knew it, and rejoiced; and when he cried aloud on the following
  day, <span class="smcap">"abiit, excessit, evasit, erupit</span>&mdash;He
  hath departed, he hath stolen out, he hath gone from among us, he hath burst
  forth into war"&mdash;his great heart thrilled, and his voice quivered, with
  prophetic joy and conscious triumph. He felt even then that he had
  <span class="smcap">"saved his country."</span></p>

  <h2><a id="ch207"
     name="ch207"></a>VII &mdash; THE AMBASSADORS</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.</i>
     &mdash;Hamlet.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT wanted a short time of noon, on a fine bracing day in the
  latter end of November.</p>

  <p>Something more than a fortnight had elapsed since the flight of Catiline;
  and, as no further discoveries had been made, nor any tumults or disturbances
  arisen in the city, men had returned to their former avocations, and had for
  the most part forgotten already the circumstances, which had a little while
  before convulsed the public mind with fear or favor.</p>

  <p>No certain tidings had been received, or, if received, divulged to the
  people, of Catiline's proceedings; it being only known that he had tarried
  for a few days at the country-house of Caius Flaminius Flamma, near to
  Arretium, where he was believed to be amusing himself with boar-hunting.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the letters of justification, and complaint against
  Cicero, had been shewn to their friends by all those who had received them,
  all men of character and weight; and their contents had thus gained great
  publicity.</p>

  <p>The consequence of this was, naturally enough, that the friends and
  favorers of the conspiracy, acting with singular wisdom and foresight,
  studiously affected the utmost moderation and humility of bearing, while
  complaining every where of the injustice done to Catiline, and of the false
  suspicions maliciously cast on many estimable individuals, by the low-born
  and ambitious person who was temporarily at the head of the state.</p>

  <p>The friends of Cicero and the republic, on the contrary, lay on their
  oars, in breathless expectation of some new occurrence, which should confirm
  the public mind, and approve their own conduct; well aware that much time
  could not elapse before Catiline would be heard of at the head of an
  army.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the city wore its wonted aspect; men bought and sold, and
  toiled or sported; and women smiled and sighed, flaunted and wantoned in the
  streets, as if, a few short days before, they had not been wringing their
  hands in terror, dissolved in tears, and speechless from dismay.</p>

  <p>It was a market day, and the forum was crowded almost to overflowing. The
  country people had flocked in, as usual, to sell the produce of their farms;
  and their wagons stood here and there laden with seasonable fruits, cheeses,
  and jars of wine, pigeons in wicker cages, fresh herbs, and such like
  articles of traffic. Many had brought their wives, sun-burned, black-haired
  and black-eyed, from their villas in the Latin or Sabine country, to purchase
  city luxuries. Many had come to have their lawsuits decided; many to crave
  justice against their superiors from the Tribunes of the people; many to get
  their wills registered, to pay or borrow money, and to transact that sort of
  business, for which the day was set aside.</p>

  <p>Nor were the townsmen absent from the gay scene; for to them the
  <i>nundinae</i>, or market days, were holydays, in which the courts of law
  were shut, and the offices closed to them, at least, although open to the
  rural citizens, for the despatch of business.</p>

  <p>The members of the city tribes crowded therefore to the forum many of
  these too accompanied by their women, to buy provisions, to ask for news from
  the country, and to stare at the uncouth and sturdy forms of the farmers, or
  admire the black eyes and merry faces of the country lasses.</p>

  <p>It was a lively and gay scene; the bankers' shops, distinguished by the
  golden shields of the Samnites, suspended from the lintels of their doors,
  were thronged with money-changers, and alive with the hum of traffic.</p>

  <p>Ever and anon some curule magistrate, in his fringed toga, with his
  lictors, in number proportioned to his rank, would come sweeping through the
  dense crowd; or some plebeian officer, with his ushers and beadles; or,
  before whom the ranks of the multitude would open of their own accord and bow
  reverentially, some white-stoled vestal virgin, with her fair features
  closely veiled from profane eyes, the sacred fillets on her head, and her
  lictor following her dainty step with his shouldered fasces. Street musicians
  there were also, and shows of various kinds, about which the lower orders of
  the people collected eagerly; and, here and there, among the white stoles and
  gayly colored shawls of the matrons and maidens, might be seen the flowered
  togas and showy head-dresses of those unfortunate girls, many of them rare
  specimens of female beauty, whose character precluded them from wearing the
  attire of their own sex.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Fabius Sanga, whither thou in such haste through the crowd?" cried a
  fine manly voice, to a patrician of middle age who was forcing his way
  hurriedly among the jostling mob, near to the steps of the Comitium, or
  building appropriated to the reception of ambassadors.</p>

  <p>The person thus addressed turned his head quickly, though without
  slackening his speed.</p>

  <p>"Ah! is it thou, Arvina? Come with me, thou art young and strong; give me
  thy arm, and help me through this concourse."</p>

  <p>"Willingly," replied the young man. "But why are you in such haste?" he
  continued, as he joined him; "you can have no business here to-day."</p>

  <p>"Aye! but I have, my Paullus. I am the patron to these Gallic ambassadors,
  who have come hither to crave relief from the Senate for their people. They
  must receive their answer in the Comitium to-day; and I fear me much, I am
  late."</p>

  <p>"Ah! by the Gods! I saw them on that day they entered the city. Right
  stout and martial barbarians! What is their plea? will they succeed?"</p>

  <p>"I fear not," answered Sanga, "They are too poor. Senatorial relief must
  be bought nowadays. The longest purse is the most righteous cause! Their case
  is a hard one, too. Their nation is oppressed with debt, both private and
  public; they have been faithful allies to the state, and served it well in
  war, and now seek remission of some grievous tributes. But what shall we say?
  They are poor&mdash;barbarians&mdash;their aid not needed now by the
  republic&mdash;and, as you know, my Paullus, justice is sold now in Rome,
  like silk, for its weight in gold!"</p>

  <p>"The more shame!" answered Paullus. "It was not by such practices, that
  our fathers built up this grand edifice of the republic."</p>

  <p>"Riches have done it, Paullus! Riches and Commerce! While we had many
  tillers of the ground, and few merchants, we were brave in the field, and
  just at home!"</p>

  <p>"Think you, then, that the spirit of commerce is averse to justice, and
  bravery, and freedom?"</p>

  <p>"No, I do not think it, Arvina, I know it!" answered Fabius Sanga, who,
  with the truth and candor of a patrician of Rome's olden school, possessed,
  and that justly, much repute for wisdom and foresight. "All mercantile
  communities are base communities. Look at Tyre, in old times! Look at
  Carthage, in our grandfathers' days! at Corinth in our own! Merchants are
  never patriots! and rich men seldom; unless they be landholders! But see,
  see, there are my clients, descending the steps of the Comitium! By all the
  Gods! I am too late! their audience is ended! Now, by Themis, the goddess of
  justice! will they deem me also venal!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, they had come to the foot of the grand flight of marble
  steps, leading up to the doors of the Graecostasis, or comitium; or rather
  had come as near to the foot, as the immense concourse, which had gathered
  about that spot to stare at the wild figures and foreign gait of the
  ambassadors, would allow them to approach.</p>

  <p>"It is in vain to press forward yet, my Sanga. A moment or two, and these
  clowns will be satisfied with gazing; yet, by Hercules! I cannot blame them.
  For these Highlanders are wondrous muscular and stout warriors to look upon,
  and their garb, although somewhat savage, is very martial and striking."</p>

  <p>And, in truth, their Celtic bonnets, with their long single eagle
  feathers, set somewhat obliquely on their abundant auburn hair; their
  saffron-colored shirts, tight-fitting trews of tartan plaid, and variegated
  mantles floating over their brawny shoulders, their chains and bracelets of
  gold and silver, their long daggers in their girdles, and their tremendous
  broad-swords swinging at their thighs, did present a strange contrast to the
  simple tunics of white woollen, and plain togas of the same material, which
  constituted the attire of nine-tenths of the spectators.</p>

  <p>"I must&mdash;must get nearer!" replied Sanga, anxiously; "I must speak
  with them! I can see by the moody brows, and sullen looks of the elder
  nobles, and by the compressed lips and fiery glances of the young warriors,
  that matters have gone amiss with them. I shall be blamed, I know, for
  it&mdash;but I have failed in my duty as their patron, and must bear it.
  There will be mischief; I pray you let us pass, my friends," he continued,
  addressing the people, "I am the patron of their nation; let us pass."</p>

  <p>But it was in vain that they besought and strove; the pressure of the mob
  was, if anything, augmented; and Paullus was compelled to remain motionless
  with his companion, hoping that the Allobroges would move in their
  direction.</p>

  <p>But, while they were thus waiting, a thin keen-looking man pressed up to
  the ambassadors, from the farther side, while they were yet upon the steps,
  and saluting them cordially, pressed their hands, as if he were an old and
  familiar friend.</p>

  <p>Nor did the Highlanders appear less glad to see him, for they shook his
  hand warmly, and spoke to him with vehement words, and sparkling eyes.</p>

  <p>"Who is that man, who greets our Allobroges so warmly?" asked Arvina of
  his companion. "Know you the man?"</p>

  <p>"I know him!" answered Sanga, watching the gestures which accompanied
  their conversation with an eager eye, although too far off to hear anything
  that was passing. "It is one of these traders, of whom we spoke but now; and
  as pestilent a knave and rogue as ever sold goods by short measure, and paid
  his purchases in light coin! Publius Umbrenus is the man. A Gallic trader. He
  hath become rich by the business he hath carried on with this same tribe,
  bartering Roman wares, goldsmith's work, trinkets, cutlery, wines, and the
  like, against their furs and hides, and above all against their amber. He
  gains three hundred fold by every barter, and yet, by the God of Faith! he
  brings them in his debt after all; and yet the simple-minded, credulous
  Barbarians, believe him their best friend. I would buy it at no small price,
  to know what he saith to them. See! he points to the Comitium. By your head,
  Paullus! he is poisoning their minds against the Senate!"</p>

  <p>"See!" said Arvina. "They descend the steps in the other direction. He is
  leading them away with him some-whither."</p>

  <p>"To no good end!" said Sanga emphatically; and then smiting his breast
  with his hand, he continued, evidently much afflicted, "My poor clients! my
  poor simple Highlanders! He will mislead them to their ruin?"</p>

  <p>"They are going toward Vesta's temple," said Arvina. "If we should turn
  back through the arch of Fabius, and so enter into the western branch of the
  Sacred Way, we might overtake them near the Ruminal Fig-tree."</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> might, for you are young and active. But I am growing old,
  Paullus, and the gout afflicts my feet, and makes me slower than my years.
  Will you do so, and mark whither he leads them; and come back, and tell me?
  You shall find me in Natta's, the bookseller's shop, at the corner of the
  street Argiletum."</p>

  <p>"Willingly, Sanga," answered the young man. "The rather, if it may profit
  these poor Gauls anything."</p>

  <p>"Thou art a good youth, Paullus. The Gods reward it to thee. Remember
  Natta's book-shop."</p>

  <p>"Doubt me not," said Arvina; and he set off at a pace so rapid, as brought
  him up with those, whom he was pursuing, within ten minutes.</p>

  <p>The ambassadors, six or eight in number, among whom the old white-headed
  chief he had observed&mdash;when he went with Hortensia and his betrothed, to
  see their ingress into Rome&mdash;together with the young warrior whose
  haughty bearing he had noticed on that occasion, were most eminent, had been
  joined by another Roman beside Umbrenus.</p>

  <p>Him, Paullus recognised at once, for Titus Volturcius, a native and
  nobleman of Crotona, a Greek city, on the Gulf of Tarentum, although a
  citizen of Rome.</p>

  <p>He was a man of evil repute, as a wild debauchee, a gambler, and seducer;
  and Arvina had observed him more than once in company with Cornelius
  Lentulus.</p>

  <p>This led him to suspect, that Sanga was perhaps more accurate in his
  suspicions, than he himself imagined; and that something might be in progress
  here, against the republic.</p>

  <p>He watched them warily, therefore; and soon found an ample confirmation of
  the worst he imagined, in seeing them enter the house of Decius Brutus, the
  husband of the beautiful, but infamous Sempronia.</p>

  <p>It must not be supposed, that the privity of these various individuals to
  the conspiracy, was accurately known to young Arvina; but he was well aware,
  that Lentulus and Catiline were sworn friends; and that Sempronia was the
  very queen of those abandoned and licentious ladies, who were the instigators
  and rewarders of the young nobles, in their profligacy and their crimes; it
  did not require, therefore, any wondrous degree of foresight, to see that
  something dangerous was probably brewing, in this amalgamation of ingredients
  so incongruous, as Roman nobles and patrician harlots, with wild barbarians
  from the Gallic highlands.</p>

  <p>Without tarrying, therefore, longer than to ascertain that he was not
  mistaken in the house, he hurried back to meet Sanga, at the appointed place,
  promising himself that not Sanga only, but Cicero himself, should be made
  acquainted with that which he had discovered so opportunely.</p>

  <p>The Argiletum was a street leading down from the vegetable mart, which lay
  just beyond the <i>Porta Fluminiana</i>, or river gate, to the banks of the
  Tiber, at the quays called <i>pulchrum littus</i>, or the beautiful shore; it
  was therefore a convenient place of meeting for persons who had parted
  company in the forum, particularly when going in that direction, which had
  been taken by Umbrenus and the Ambassadors.</p>

  <p>Hastening onward to the street appointed&mdash;which was for the most part
  inhabited by booksellers, copyists, and embellishers of illuminated
  manuscripts, beside a few tailors&mdash;he was hailed, just as he reached the
  river gate, by a well-known voice, from a cross street; and turning round he
  felt his hand warmly grasped, by an old friend, Aristius Fuscus, one of the
  noble youths, with whom he had striven, in the Campus Martius, on that
  eventful day, when he first visited the house of Catiline.</p>

  <p>"Hail! Paullus," exclaimed the new comer, "I have not seen you in many
  days. Where have you been, since you beat us all in the quinquertium?"</p>

  <p>"Absent from town, on business of the state, part of the time, my Fuscus,"
  answered Arvina, shaking his friend's hand gayly. "I was sent to Praeneste,
  with my troop of horse, before the calends of November; and returned not
  until the Ides."</p>

  <p>"And since that, I fancy"&mdash;replied the other laughing, "You have been
  sunning yourself in the bright smiles of the fair Julia. I thought you were
  to have led her home, as your bride, ere this time."</p>

  <p>"You are wrong for once, good friend," said Paullus, with a well-pleased
  smile. "Julia is absent from the city also. She and Hortensia are on a visit
  to their farm, at the foot of Mount Algidus. I have not seen them, since my
  return from Praeneste."</p>

  <p>"Your slaves, I trow, know every mile-stone by this time, on the via
  Labicana! Do you write to her daily?"</p>

  <p>"Not so, indeed, Aristius;" he replied. "We are too long betrothed, and
  too confident, each in the good faith of the other, to think it needful to
  kill my poor slaves in bearing amatory billets."</p>

  <p>"You are wise, Paullus, as you are true, and will, I hope, be happy
  lovers!"</p>

  <p>"The Gods grant it!" replied Paullus.</p>

  <p>"Do they return shortly? It is long since I have visited Hortensia. She
  would do justly to refuse me admittance when next I go to salute her."</p>

  <p>"Not until after the next market day. But here I must leave you; I am
  going to Natta's shop, in the Argiletum."</p>

  <p>"To purchase books? Ha! or to the tailor's? the last, I presume, gay
  bridegroom&mdash;there are, you know, two Nattas."</p>

  <p>"Natta, the bookseller, is my man. But I go thither, not as a buyer, but
  to meet a friend, Fabius Sanga."</p>

  <p>"A very wise and virtuous Roman," replied the other, stopping at the
  corner of the street Argiletum, "but tarry a moment; when shall we meet
  again? I am going down to the hippodrome, can you not join me there, when you
  have finished your business with Sanga?"</p>

  <p>"I can; gladly." answered Arvina.</p>

  <p>As they stopped, previous to separating, a young man, who had been walking
  for some distance close at their heels, passed them, nodding as he did so, to
  Arvina, who returned his salutation, very distantly.</p>

  <p>"Aulus Fulvius!" said Aristius, as Paullus bowed to him, "as bad a
  specimen of a young patrician, as one might see for many days, even if he
  searched for rascals, as the philosopher did for an honest man, by lanthorn's
  light at noon. He has been following our steps, by my head!&mdash;to pick up
  our stray words, and weave them into calumnies, and villainy."</p>

  <p>"I care not," answered Arvina, lightly. "He may make all he can of what he
  heard, we were talking no treason!"</p>

  <p>"No, truly; not even lover's treason," said his friend. "Well, do not
  tarry long, Arvina."</p>

  <p>"I will not; be assured. Not the fourth part of an hour. See! there is
  Fabius Sanga awaiting me even now. Walk slowly, and I will overtake you,
  before you reach the Campus."</p>

  <p>And with the word, he turned down the Argiletum, and joined the patron of
  the Allobroges, at the bookseller's door.</p>

  <p>In the meantime Aulus Fulvius, who had heard all that he desired, wheeled
  about, and walked back toward the Carmental gate. But, as he passed the head
  of the Argiletum, he cast a lurid glance of singular malignity upon Arvina,
  who was standing in full view, conversing with his friend; and muttered
  between his teeth,</p>

  <p>"The fool! the hypocrite! the pedant! well said, wise Catiline, 'that it
  matters not much whether one listen to his friends, so he listen well to his
  enemies!' The fool&mdash;so he thinks he shall have Julia. But he never
  shall, by Hades! never!"</p>

  <p>A slenderly made boy, dressed in a succinct huntsman's tunic, with
  <i>subligacula</i>, or drawers, reaching to within a hand's breadth of his
  knee, was loitering near the corner, gazing wistfully on Arvina; and, as
  Aulus muttered those words half aloud, he jerked his head sharply around, and
  looked very keenly at the speaker.</p>

  <p>"Never shall have Julia!" he repeated to himself, "he must have spoken
  that concerning Arvina. I wonder who he is. I never saw him before. I must
  know&mdash;I must know, forthwith! For he <i>shall</i> have her, by heaven
  and Him, who dwells in it! he <i>shall</i> have her!"</p>

  <p>And, turning a lingering and languid look toward Paullus, the slight boy
  darted away in pursuit of Aulus.</p>

  <p>A moment afterward Arvina, his conference with Sanga ended, and ignorant
  of all that by-play, took the road leading to the Campus, eager to overtake
  his friend Aristius.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch208"

  <p class="quote"><i>I come, O Agamemnon's daughter fair,<br>
  To this thy sylvan lair.</i><br>
  &mdash;Electra.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THROUGH a soft lap in the wooded chain of Mount Algidus, a
  bright pellucid stream, after wheeling and fretting among the crags and
  ledges of the upper valleys, winds its way gently, toward the far-famed
  Tiber.</p>

  <p>Shut in, on every side, except the south, by the lower spurs of the
  mountain ridge, in which it is so snugly nestled, covered with rich groves of
  chesnut-trees, and sheltered on the northward by the dark pines of the
  loftier steeps, it were difficult to conceive a fairer site for a villa, than
  that sweet vale.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, on a little knoll in the jaws of the gorge, whence issued
  that clear streamlet, facing the pleasant south, yet sheltered from its
  excessive heats by a line of superb plane trees, festooned with luxuriant
  vines, there stood a long low building of the antique form, built of
  dark-colored stone.</p>

  <p>A villa, in the days of Cicero, was a very different thing from the
  luxurious pleasure-houses which came into vogue in the days of the later
  Emperors, of which Pliny has given us descriptions so minute and glowing; yet
  even his Tusculan retreat was a building of vast pretension, when compared
  with this, which was in fact neither more nor less than an old Roman
  Farmhouse, of that innocent and unsophisticated day, when the Consulars of
  the Republic were tillers of the soil, and when heroes returned, from the
  almost immortal triumph, to the management of the spade and the
  ploughshare.</p>

  <p>This villa had, it is true, been adorned somewhat, and fitted to the
  temporary abode of individuals more refined and elegant, than the rough
  steward and rustic slaves, who were its usual tenants. Yet it still retained
  its original form, and was adapted to its original uses.</p>

  <p>The house itself, which was but two stories high, was in form a hollow
  square, to the courts enclosed in which access was gained by a pair of lofty
  wooden gates in the rear. It had, in the first instance, presented on all
  sides merely a blank wall exteriorly, all the windows looking into the court,
  the centre of which was occupied by a large tank of water, the whole interior
  serving the purpose of a farm yard. The whole ground floor of the building,
  had formerly been occupied by stables, root-houses, wine-presses, dairies,
  cheese-rooms and the like, and by the slaves' kitchen, which was the first
  apartment toward the right of the entrance. The upper story contained the
  granaries and the dormitories of the workmen; and three sides still remained
  unaltered.</p>

  <p>The front, however, of the villa had been pierced with a handsome doorway,
  and several windows; a colonnade of rustic stonework had been carried along
  the faade, and a beautiful garden had been laid out before it, with grassy
  terraces, clipped hedges, box trees, transmuted by the gardener's art into
  similitudes of Peacocks, Centaurs, Tritons, Swans, and many other forms of
  fowls or fishes, unknown alike and unnamed by Gods or mortals.</p>

  <p>The sun was within about half an hour of his setting, and his slant beams,
  falling through a gap in the western hills, streamed down into the little
  valley, casting long stripes of alternate light and shadow over the smoothly
  shaven lawn, sparkling upon the ripples of the streamlet, and gilding the
  embrowned or yellow foliage of the sere hill-sides, with brighter and more
  vivid colors.</p>

  <p>At this pleasant hour, notwithstanding the lateness of the season, and
  looking upon this pleasant scene, a group of females were collected, under
  the rustic colonnade of Italian marble, engaged in some of those light toils,
  which in feminine hands are so graceful.</p>

  <p>The foremost of these, seated apart somewhat from the others, were the
  stately and still beautiful Hortensia, and her lovely daughter, both of them
  employed in twirling the soft threads from the merrily revolving spindle,
  into large osier baskets; and the elder lady, glancing at times toward the
  knot of slave girls, as if to see that they performed their light tasks; and
  at times, if their mirth waxed too loud, checking it by a gesture of her
  elevated finger.</p>

  <p>A little while before, Julia had been singing in her sweet low voice, one
  of those favorite old ballads, which were so much prized by the Romans, and
  to which Livy is probably so much indebted for the redundant imagery of his
  "pictured page," commemorative of the deeds and virtues of the Old
  Houses.</p>

  <p>But, as her lay came to its end, her eye had fallen on the broad blood-red
  disc of the descending day-god, and had followed him upon his downward path,
  until he was lost to view, among the tangled coppices that fringed the brow
  of the western hill.</p>

  <p>Her hands dropped listlessly into her lap, releasing the snow-white
  thread, which they had drawn out so daintily; and keeping her eyes still
  fixed steadily on the point where he had disappeared, she gave vent to her
  feelings in a long-drawn 'heigho!' in every language, and in all times,
  expression of sentimental sadness.</p>

  <p>"Wherefore so sad a sigh, my Julia?" asked Hortensia, gazing
  affectionately at the saddened brow of the fair girl&mdash;"methinks! there
  is nothing very melancholy here; nothing that should call forth
  repining."</p>

  <p>"See, see Hortensia, how he sinks like a dying warrior, amid those
  sanguine clouds," cried the girl, pointing to the great orb of the sun, just
  as its last limb was disappearing.</p>

  <p>"And into a couch of bays and myrtles, like that warrior, when his duty is
  done, his fame won!" exclaimed Hortensia, throwing her arm abroad
  enthusiastically; and truly the hill-side, behind which he was lost to view,
  was feathered thick with the shrubs of which she spoke&mdash;"methinks! there
  is nought for which to sigh in such a setting, either of the sun, or the
  hero!"</p>

  <p>"But see, how dark and gloomy he has left all behind him!&mdash;the river
  which was golden but now, while he smiled upon it, now that he is gone, is
  leaden."</p>

  <p>"But he shall rise again to-morrow, brighter and yet more glorious; and
  yet more gloriously shall the stream blaze back his rising than his setting
  lustre."</p>

  <p>"Alas! alas! Hortensia!"</p>

  <p>"Wherefore, alas, my Julia?"</p>

  <p>"For so will not the warrior rise, who sinks forever, although it may be
  into a bed of glory! And if the setting of the sun leave all here lustreless
  and dark and gloomy, although <i>that</i> must arise again to-morrow, what
  must the setting do of one who shall arise no more for ever; whose light of
  life was to one heart, what the sunbeam was to the streamlet, but which,
  unlike that sunbeam, shall never shine on the heart any more, Hortensia."</p>

  <p>"My poor child," cried the noble matron, affected almost to tears, "you
  are thinking of Paullus."</p>

  <p>"When am I not thinking of him, mother?" said the girl. "Remember, we have
  left the city, seeking these quiet shades, in order to eschew that turmoil,
  that peril, in the heat of which <i>he</i> is now striving for his country!
  Remember, that he will plunge into all that strife, the more desperately,
  because he fancies that he was too remiss before! Remember this, Hortensia;
  and say, if thou canst, that I have no cause for sad forebodings!"</p>

  <p>"That can I not, my Julia," she replied&mdash;"For who is there on earth,
  who knoweth what the next sun shall bring forth? The sunshine of to-day, oft
  breeds the storm of to-morrow&mdash;and, again, from the tempest of the eve,
  how oft is born the brightest and most happy morning. Wisest is he, and
  happiest, my child, who wraps himself in his own virtue, careless of what the
  day shall bring to pass, and confident, that all the shafts of fortune must
  rebound, harmless and blunted, from his sure armor of philosophy."</p>

  <p>"Must not the heart have bled, Hortensia, before it can so involve itself
  in virtue?&mdash;must not such philosophy be the tardy offspring of great
  sorrow?"</p>

  <p>"For the most part I fear it is so, Julia," answered the matron, "but some
  souls there are so innocent and quiet, so undisturbed by the outward world,
  that they have that, almost by nature, which others only win by suffering and
  tears."</p>

  <p>"Cold and unfeeling souls, I fancy," replied the girl. "For it appears to
  me that this philosophy which smiles on all spite of fortune, must be akin to
  selfish and morose indifference. I see not much to love, Hortensia, or to
  admire in the stoic!"</p>

  <p>"Nor much more, I imagine," said Hortensia, not sorry to draw her mind
  from the subject which occupied it so painfully, "in the Epicurean!"</p>

  <p>"Much less!" answered Julia, quickly, "his creed is mere madness and
  impiety. To believe that the Gods care nothing for the good or evil&mdash;ye
  Gods!" she interrupted herself suddenly, almost with a shriek. "What is this?
  a slave riding, as if for life, on a foaming horse, from the cityward. Oh! my
  prophetic soul, Hortensia!"</p>

  <p>And she turned pale as death, although she remained quite firm and
  self-possessed.</p>

  <p>"It may be nothing, Julia; or it may be good tidings," answered Hortensia,
  although she was in truth scarce less alarmed, than her daughter, by the
  unexpected arrival.</p>

  <p>"Good tidings travel not so quickly. Beside, what can there be of good, so
  unexpected? But we shall know&mdash;we shall know quickly," and she arose, as
  if to descend the steps into the garden, but she sank back again into her
  seat, crying, "I am faint, I am sick, <i>here</i>, Hortensia," and she laid
  her hand on her heart as she spoke. "Nay! do not tarry with me, I pray thee,
  see what he brings. Anything but the torture of suspense!"</p>

  <p>"I go, I go, my child," cried the matron, descending the marble steps to
  the lawn, on which the slave had just drawn up his panting horse. "He has a
  letter in his hand, be of good courage."</p>

  <p>And a moment afterward she cried out joyously, "It is in his hand, Julia,
  Paullus Arvina's hand. Fear nothing."</p>

  <p>And with a quick light step, she returned, and gave the little slip of
  vellum into the small white hand, which trembled so much, that it scarcely
  could receive it.</p>

  <p>"A snow-white dove to thee, kind Venus!" cried the girl, raising her eyes
  in gratitude to heaven, before she broke the seal.</p>

  <p>But as she did so, and read the first lines, her face was again overcast,
  and her eyes were dilated with wild terror.</p>

  <p>"It is so&mdash;it is so&mdash;Hortensia! I knew&mdash;oh! my soul! I knew
  it!" and she let fall the letter, and fell back in her seat almost
  fainting.</p>

  <p>"What?&mdash;what?" exclaimed Hortensia. "It is Arvina's hand&mdash;he
  must be in life!&mdash;what is it, my own Julia?"</p>

  <p>"Wounded almost to death!" faltered the girl, in accents half choked with
  anguish. "Read! read aloud, kind mother."</p>

  <p>Alarmed by her daughter's suffering and terror, Hortensia caught the
  parchment from her half lifeless fingers, and scanning its contents hastily
  with her eyes, read as follows;</p>

  <p>"Paullus Arvina, to Julia and Hortensia, greeting! Your well known
  constancy and courage give me the confidence to write frankly to you,
  concealing nothing. Your affection makes me sure, that you will hasten to
  grant my request. Last night, in a tumult aroused by the desperate followers
  of Catiline, stricken down and severely wounded, I narrowly missed death.
  Great thanks are due to the Gods, that the assassin's weapon failed to
  penetrate to my vitals. Be not too much alarmed, however; Alexion, Cicero's
  friend and physician, has visited me; and declares, that, unless fever
  supervene, there is no danger from the wound. Still, I am chained to my
  couch, wearily, and in pain, with none but slaves about me. At such times,
  the heart asks for more tender ministering&mdash;wherefore I pray you, Julia,
  let not one day elapse; but come to me! Hortensia, by the Gods! bring her to
  the city! Catiline hath fled, the peril hath passed over&mdash;but lo! I am
  growing faint&mdash;I can write no more, now&mdash;there is a swimming of my
  brain, and a cloud over my eyes. Farewell. Come to me quickly, that it prove
  not too late&mdash;come to me quickly, if you indeed love ARVINA."</p>

  <p>"We will go, Julia. We will go to him instantly," said
  Hortensia&mdash;"but be of good cheer, poor child. Alexion declares, that
  there is no danger; and no one is so wise as he! Be of good cheer, we will
  set forth this night, this hour! Ere daybreak, we will be in Rome. Hark,
  Lydia," she continued, turning to one of the slave girls, "call me the
  steward, old Davus. Let the boy Gota, take the horse of the messenger; and
  bring thou the man hither." Then she added, addressing Julia, "I will
  question him farther, while they prepare the carpentum! Ho, Davus,"&mdash;for
  the old slave, who was close at hand, entered forthwith&mdash;"Have the mules
  harnessed, instantly, to the carpentum, and let the six Thracians, who
  accompanied us from Rome, saddle their horses, and take arms. Ill fortune has
  befallen young Arvina; we must return to town this night&mdash;as speedily as
  may be."</p>

  <p>"Within an hour, Hortensia, all shall be in readiness, on my head be it,
  else."</p>

  <p>"It is well&mdash;and, hark you! send hither wine and bread&mdash;we will
  not wait until they make supper ready; beside, this youth is worn out with
  his long ride, and needs refreshment."</p>

  <p>As the steward left the room, she gazed attentively at the young slave,
  who had brought the despatch, and, not recognising his features, a half
  feeling of suspicion crossed her mind; so that she stooped and whispered to
  Julia, who looked up hastily and answered,</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;but what matters it? It is <i>his</i> handwriting, and
  his signet."</p>

  <p>"I do not know," said Hortensia, doubtfully&mdash;"I think he would have
  sent one of the older men; one whom we knew; I think he would have sent
  Medon"&mdash;Then she said to the boy, "I have never seen thy face before, I
  believe, good youth. How long hast thou served Arvina?"</p>

  <p>"Since the Ides of October, Hortensia. He purchased me of Marcus
  Crassus."</p>

  <p>"Purchased thee, Ha?" said Hortensia, yet more doubtfully than
  before&mdash;"that is strange. His household was large enough already. How
  came he then to purchase thee?"</p>

  <p>"I was hired out by Crassus, as is his wont to do, to Crispus the
  sword-smith, in the Sacred Way&mdash;a cruel tyrant and oppressor, whom, when
  he was barbarously scourging me for a small error, noble Arvina saw; and
  then, finding his intercession fruitless, purchased me, as he said, that
  thereafter I should be entreated as a man, not as a beast of burthen."</p>

  <p>"It is true! by the Gods!" exclaimed the girl, clasping her hands
  enthusiastically, and a bright blush coming up into her pale face. "Had I
  been told the action, without the actor's name, I should have known therein
  Arvina."</p>

  <p>"Thou shouldst be grateful, therefore, to this good Arvina"&mdash;said
  Hortensia, gazing at him with a fixed eye, she knew not wherefore, yet with a
  sort of dubious presentiment of coming evil.</p>

  <p>"Grateful!" cried the youth, clasping his hands fervently
  together&mdash;"ye Gods! grateful! Hortensia, by your head! I worship
  him&mdash;I would die for him."</p>

  <p>"How came he to send thee on this mission? Why sent he not Medon, or
  Euphranor, or one of his elder freedmen?"</p>

  <p>"Medon, he could not send, nor Euphranor. It went ill with them both, in
  that affray, wherein my lord was wounded. The older slaves keep watch around
  his bed; the strongest and most trusty, are under arms in the Atrium."</p>

  <p>"And wert thou with him, in that same affray?"</p>

  <p>"I was with him, Hortensia,"</p>

  <p>"When fell it out, and for what cause?"</p>

  <p>"Hast thou not heard, Hortensia?&mdash;has he not told you? by the Gods! I
  thought, the world had known it. How before Catiline, may it be ill with him
  and his, went forth from the city, he and his friends and followers attacked
  the Consuls, on the Palatine, with armed violence. It was fought through the
  streets doubtfully, for near three hours; and the fortunes of the Republic
  were at stake, and well nigh despaired of, if not lost. Cicero was down on
  the pavement, and Catiline's sword flashing over him, when, with his slaves
  and freedmen, my master cut his way through the ranks of the conspiracy, and
  bore off the great magistrate unharmed. But, as he turned, a villain buried
  his <i>sica</i> in his back, and though he saved the state, he well nigh lost
  his life, to win everlasting fame, and the love of all good citizens!"</p>

  <p>"Hast seen him since he was wounded?" exclaimed Julia, who had devoured
  every word he uttered, with insatiable longing and avidity.</p>

  <p>"Surely," replied the boy. "I received that scroll from his own
  hands&mdash;my orders from his own lips&mdash;'spare not an instant,' he
  said, 'Jason; tarry not, though you kill your steed. If you would have me
  live, let Julia see this letter before midnight.' It lacks as yet, four hours
  of midnight. Doth it not, noble Julia?"</p>

  <p>"Five, I think. But how looked, how spoke he? Is he in great pain, Jason?
  how seemed he, when you left him?"</p>

  <p>"He was very pale, Julia&mdash;very wan, and his lips ashy white. His
  voice faltered very much, moreover, and when he had made an end of speaking,
  he swooned away. I heard that he was better somewhat, ere I set out to come
  hither; but the physician speaks of fever to be apprehended, on any
  irritation or excitement. Should you delay long in visiting him, I fear the
  consequences might be perilous indeed."</p>

  <p>"Do you hear? do you hear that, Hortensia? By the Gods! Let us go at once!
  we need no preparation!"</p>

  <p>"We will go, Julia. Old Davus' hour hath nearly passed already. We will be
  in the city before day-break! Fear not, my sweet one, all shall go well with
  our beloved Paullus."</p>

  <p>"The Gods grant it!"</p>

  <p>"Here is wine, Jason," said Hortensia. "Drink, boy, you must needs be
  weary after so hard a gallop. You have done well, and shall repose here this
  night. To-morrow, when well rested and refreshed, you shall follow us to
  Rome."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, lady," said the youth. "I am not weary; love for Arvina hath
  prevailed over all weariness! Furnish me, I beseech you, with a fresh horse;
  and let me go with you."</p>

  <p>"It shall be as you wish," said Hortensia, "but your frame seems too
  slender, to endure much labor."</p>

  <p>"The Gods have given me a willing heart, Hortensia&mdash;and the strong
  will makes strong the feeble body."</p>

  <p>"Well spoken, youth. Your devotion shall lose you nothing, believe me.
  Come, Julia, let us go and array us for the journey. The nights are cold now,
  in December, and the passes of the Algidus are bleak and gusty."</p>

  <p>The ladies left the room; and, before the hour, which Davus had required,
  was spent, they were seated together in the rich carpentum, well wrapped in
  the soft many-colored woollen fabrics, which supplied the place of furs among
  the Romans&mdash;it being considered a relic of barbarism, to wear the skins
  of beasts, until the love for this decoration again returned in the last
  centuries of the Empire.</p>

  <p>Old Davus grasped the reins; two Thracian slaves, well mounted, and armed
  with the small circular targets and lances of their native land, gallopped
  before the carriage, accompanied by the slave who had brought the message,
  while four more similarly equipped brought up the rear; and thus, before the
  moon had arisen, travelling at a rapid pace, they cleared the cultivated
  country, and were involved in the wild passes of Mount Algidus.</p>

  <p>Scarcely, however, had they wound out of sight, when gallopping at mad and
  reckless speed, down a wild wood-road on the northern side of the villa,
  there came a horseman bestriding a white courser, of rare symmetry and
  action, now almost black with sweat, and envelopped with foam-flakes.</p>

  <p>The rider was the same singular-looking dark-complexioned boy, who had
  overheard the exclamation of Aulus Fulvius, concerning young Arvina, uttered
  at the head of the street Argiletum.</p>

  <p>His body was bent over the rude saddle-bow with weariness, and he reeled
  to and fro, as if he would have fallen from his horse, when he pulled up at
  the door of the villa.</p>

  <p>"I would speak," he said in a faint and faltering voice, "presently, with
  Hortensia&mdash;matters of life and death depend on it."</p>

  <p>"The Gods avert the omen!" cried the woman, to whom he had addressed
  himself, "Hortensia hath gone but now to Rome, with young Julia, on the
  arrival of a message from Arvina."</p>

  <p>"Too late! too late!"&mdash;cried the boy, beating his breast with both
  hands. "They are betrayed to death or dishonor!"</p>

  <p>"How? what is this? what say you?" cried the chief slave of the farm, a
  person of some trust and importance, who had just come up.</p>

  <p>"It was a tall slight fair-haired slave who bore the message&mdash;he
  called himself Jason&mdash;he rode a bay horse, did he not?" asked the new
  comer.</p>

  <p>"He was! He did! A bay horse, with one white foot before, and a white star
  on his forehead. A rare beast from Numidia, or Cyrenaica," replied the
  steward, who was quite at home in the article of horse-flesh.</p>

  <p>"He brought tidings that Arvina is sorely wounded?"</p>

  <p>"He brought tidings! Therefore it was that they set forth at so short
  notice! He left the horse here, and was mounted on a black horse of the
  farm."</p>

  <p>"Arvina is not wounded! That bay horse is Cethegus', the conspirator's!
  Arvina hath sent <i>no</i> message! They are betrayed, I tell you, man. Aulus
  Fulvius awaits them with a gang of desperadoes in the deep cleft of the
  hills, where the cross-road comes in by which you reach the Flaminian from
  the Labican way. Arm yourselves speedily and follow, else will they carry
  Julia to Catiline's camp in the Appenines, beside Fiesol! What there will
  befall her, Catiline's character best may inform you! Come&mdash;to
  arms&mdash;men! to horse, and follow!"</p>

  <p>But ignorant of the person of the messenger, lacking an authorized head,
  fearful of taking the responsibility, and incurring the reproach, perhaps the
  punishment, of credulity, they loitered and hesitated; and, though they did
  at length get to horse and set out in pursuit, it was not till Hortensia's
  cavalcade had been gone above an hour.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, unconscious of what had occurred behind them, and eager only to
  arrive at Rome as speedily as possible, the ladies journeyed onward, with
  full hearts, in silence, and in sorrow.</p>

  <p>There is a deep dark gorge in the mountain chain, through which this road
  lay, nearly a mile in length; with a fierce torrent on one hand, and a sheer
  face of craggy rocks towering above it on the other. Beyond the torrent, the
  chesnut woods hung black and gloomy along the precipitous slopes, with their
  ragged tree-tops distinctly marked against the clear obscure of the nocturnal
  sky.</p>

  <p>Midway this gorge, a narrow broken path comes down a cleft in the rocky
  wall on the right hand side, as you go toward Rome, by which through a wild
  and broken country the Flaminian way can be reached, and by it the district
  of Etruria and the famous Val d'Arno.</p>

  <p>They had just reached this point, and were congratulating themselves, on
  having thus accomplished the most difficult part of their journey, when the
  messenger, who rode in front, uttered a long clear whistle.</p>

  <p>The twang of a dozen bowstrings followed, from some large blocks of stone
  which embarrassed the pass at the junction of the two roads, and both the
  Thracians who preceded the carnage, went down, one of them killed outright,
  the other, with his horse shot dead under him.</p>

  <p>"Ho! Traitor!" shouted the latter, extricating himself from the dead
  charger, and hurling his javelin with fatal accuracy at the false slave,
  "thou at least shalt not boast of thy villainy! Treachery! treachery! Turn
  back, Hortensia! Fly, avus! to me! to me, comrades!"</p>

  <p>But with a loud shout, down came young Aulus Fulvius, from the pass,
  armed, head to foot, as a Roman legionary soldier&mdash;down came the
  gigantic smith Caius Crispus, and fifteen men, at least, with blade and
  buckler, at his back.</p>

  <p>The slaves fought desperately for their mistress' liberty or life; but the
  odds were too great, both in numbers and equipment; and not five minutes
  passed, before they were all cut down, and stretched out, dead or dying, on
  the rocky floor of the dark defile.</p>

  <p>The strife ended, Aulus Fulvius strode quickly to the carpentum, which had
  been overturned in the affray, and which his lawless followers were already
  ransacking.</p>

  <p>One of these wretches, his own namesake Aulus, the sword-smith's foreman,
  had already caught Julia in his licentious grasp, and was about to press his
  foul lips to her cheek, when the young patrician snatched her from his arms,
  and pushed him violently backward.</p>

  <p>"Ho! fool and villain!" he exclaimed, "Barest thou to think such dainties
  are for thee? She is sacred to Catiline and vengeance!"</p>

  <p>"This one, at least, then!" shouted the ruffian, making at Hortensia.</p>

  <p>"Nor that one either!" cried the smith interposing; but as Aulus, the
  foreman, still struggled to lay hold of the Patrician lady, he very coolly
  struck him across the bare brow with the edge of his heavy cutting sword,
  cleaving him down to the teeth&mdash;"Nay! then take that, thou
  fool."&mdash;Then turning to Fulvius, he added; "He was a brawler always, and
  would have kept no discipline, now or ever."</p>

  <p>"Well done, smith!" replied Aulus Fulvius. "The same fate to all who
  disobey orders! We have no time for dalliance now; it will be day ere long,
  and we must be miles hence ere it dawns! Bind me Hortensia, firmly, to yon
  chesnut tree, stout smith; but do not harm her. We too have mothers!" he
  added with a singular revulsion of feeling at such a moment. "For you, my
  beauty, we will have you consoled by a warmer lover than that most
  shallow-pated fool and sophist, Arvina. Come! I say come! no one shall harm
  you!" and without farther words, despite all her struggles and remonstrances,
  he bound a handkerchief tightly under her chin to prevent her cries, wrapped
  her in a thick crimson pallium, and springing upon his charger, with the
  assistance of the smith, placed her before him on the saddle-cloth, and set
  off a furious pace, through the steep by-path, leaving the defile tenanted
  only by the dying and the dead, with the exception of Hortensia, who rent the
  deaf air in vain with frantic cries of anguish, until at last she fainted,
  nature being too weak for the endurance of such prolonged agony.</p>

  <p>About an hour afterward, she was released and carried to her Roman
  mansion, alive and unharmed in body, but almost frantic with despair, by the
  party of slaves who had come up, too late to save her Julia, under the
  guidance of the young unknown.</p>

  <p>He, when he perceived that his efforts had been useless, and when he
  learned how Julia had been carried off by the conspirators, leaving the party
  to escort Hortensia, and bear their slaughtered comrades homeward, rode
  slowly and thoughtfully away, into the recesses of the wild country whither
  Aulus had borne his captive, exclaiming in a low silent voice with a clinched
  hand, and eyes turned heavenward, "I will die, ere dishonor reach her! Aid
  me! aid me, thou Nemesis&mdash;aid me to save, and avenge!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch209"

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>Under which king, Bezonian? Speak, or
     die!</i> &mdash;Two Gentlemen of Verona.</p><br>

  <p class="first">ON that same night, and nearly at the same hour wherein the
  messenger of Aulus Fulvius arrived at the Latin villa, there was a splendid
  banquet given in a house near the forum.</p>

  <p>It was the house of Decius Brutus, unworthy bearer of a time-honored name,
  the husband of the infamous Sempronia.</p>

  <p>At an earlier hour of the evening, a great crowd had been gathered round
  the doors, eager to gaze on the ambassadors of the Highland Gauls, who, their
  mission to Rome ended unsuccessfully, feasted there for the last time
  previous to their departure.</p>

  <p>As it grew dark, however, tired of waiting in the hope of seeing the
  plaided warriors depart, the throng had dispersed, and with exception of the
  city watches and the cohorts, which from hour to hour perambulated them, the
  streets were unusually silent, and almost deserted.</p>

  <p>There was no glare of lights from the windows of Brutus' house, as there
  would be in these days, and in modern mansions, to indicate the scene of
  festivity; for it was in the inmost chamber, of the most secluded suite of
  apartments, that the boards had been spread for the <i>comissatio</i>, or
  nocturnal revel.</p>

  <p>The <i>caena</i>, or dinner, had been partaken by all the guests previous
  to their arrival at their entertainer's, and the tables were laid only with
  light dainties and provocatives to thirst, such as salted meats and fishes,
  the roe of the sturgeon highly seasoned, with herbs and fruits, and pastry
  and confections, of all kinds.</p>

  <p>Rich urns, with heaters, containing hot spiced wines, prepared with honey,
  smoked on the boards of costly citrean wood, intermixed with crystal vases
  filled with the rarest vintages of the Falernian hills, cooled and diluted
  with snow-water.</p>

  <p>And around the circular tables, on the tapestried couches, reclined the
  banqueters of both sexes, quaffing the rich wines to strange toasts, jesting,
  and laughing wildly, singing at times themselves as the myrtle branch and the
  lute went round, at times listening to the licentious chaunts of the unveiled
  and almost unrobed dancing girls, or the obscene and scurrilous buffoonery of
  the mimes and clowns, who played so conspicuous a part in the Roman
  entertainments of a later period.</p>

  <p>Among these banqueters there was not a single person not privy to the
  conspiracy, and few who have not been introduced already to the acquaintance
  of the reader, but among these few was Sempronia&mdash;Sempronia, who could
  be all things, at all times, and to all persons&mdash;who with all the
  softness and grace and beauty of the most feminine of her sex, possessed all
  the daring, energy, vigor, wisdom of the bravest and most intriguing
  man&mdash;accomplished to the utmost in all the liberal arts, a poetess and
  minstrel unrivalled by professional performers, a dancer more finished and
  voluptuous than beseemed a Roman matron, a scholar in both tongues, the Greek
  as well as her own, and priding herself on her ability to charm the gravest
  and most learned sages by the modesty of her bearing and the wealth of her
  intellect, as easily as the most profligate debauchees by her facetious
  levity, her loose wit, and her abandonment of all restraint to the wildest
  license.</p>

  <p>On this evening she had strained every nerve to fascinate, to dazzle, to
  astonish.</p>

  <p>She had danced as a bacchanal, with her luxuriant hair dishevelled beneath
  a crown of vine leaves, with her bright shoulders and superb bust displayed
  at every motion by the displacement of the panther's skin, which alone
  covered them, timing her graceful steps to the clang of the silver cymbals
  which she waved and clashed with her bare arms above her stately head, and
  showing off the beauties of her form in attitudes more classically graceful,
  more studiously indelicate, than the most reckless figurante of our days.</p>

  <p>She had sung every species of melody and rythm, from the wildest
  dithyrambic to the severest and most grave alcaic; she had struck the lute,
  calling forth notes such as might have performed the miracles attributed to
  Orpheus and Amphion.</p>

  <p>She had exerted her unrivalled learning so far as to discourse eloquently
  in the uncouth and almost unknown tongues of Germany and Gaul.</p>

  <p>For she had Gaulish hearers, Gaulish admirers, whom, whether from mere
  female vanity, whether from the awakening of some strange unbridled passion,
  or whether from some deeper cause, she was bent on delighting.</p>

  <p>For mixed in brilliant contrast with the violet and flower enwoven tunics,
  with the myrtle-crowned perfumed love-locks of the Roman feasters, were seen
  the gay and many-chequered plaids, the jewelled weapons, and loose lion-like
  tresses of the Gallic Highlanders, and the wild blue eyes, sharp and clear as
  the untamed falcon's, gazing in wonder or glancing in childlike simplicity at
  the strange scenes and gorgeous luxuries which amazed all their senses.</p>

  <p>The tall and powerful young chief, who had on several occasions attracted
  the notice of Arvina, and whom he had tracked but a few days before into this
  very house, reclined on the same couch with its accomplished mistress, and it
  was on him that her sweetest smiles, her most speaking glances were levelled,
  for him that her charms were displayed so unreservedly and boldly.</p>

  <p>And the eyes of the young Gaul flashed at times a strange fire, but it was
  difficult to tell, if it were indignation or desire that kindled that sharp
  flame&mdash;and his cheek burned with a hectic and unwonted hue, but whether
  it was the hue of shame or passion, what eye could determine.</p>

  <p>One thing alone was evident, that he encouraged her in her wild licence,
  and affected, if he did not feel, the most decided admiration for her
  beauty.</p>

  <p>His hand had toyed with hers, his fingers had strayed through the mazes of
  her superb raven ringlets, his lip had pressed hers unrebuked, and his ear
  had drunk in long murmuring low-breathed sighs, and whispers unheard by any
  other.</p>

  <p>Her Roman lovers, in other words two-thirds of those present, for she was
  no chary dame, looked at each other, some with a sneering smile, some with a
  shrewd and knowing glance, and some with ill-dissembled jealousy, but not one
  of them all, so admirable was her dissimulation&mdash;if that may be called
  admirable, which is most odious&mdash;could satisfy himself, whether she was
  indeed captivated by the robust and manly beauty of the young barbarian, or
  whether it was merely a piece of consummate acting, the more to attach him to
  their cause.</p>

  <p>It might have been observed had the quick eye of Catiline been there,
  prompt to read human hearts as if they were written books&mdash;that the
  older envoys looked with suspicious and uneasy glances, at the demeanor of
  their young associate, that they consulted one another from time to time with
  grave and searching eyes, and that once or twice, when Sempronia, who alone
  of those present understood their language, was at a distance, they uttered a
  few words in Gaelic, not in the most agreeable or happiest accent.</p>

  <p>Wilder and wilder waxed the revelry, and now the slaves withdrew, and
  breaking off into pairs or groups, the guests dispersed themselves among the
  peristyles, dimly illuminated with many twinkling lamps, and shrubberies of
  myrtle and laurestinus which adorned the courts and gardens of the proud
  mansions.</p>

  <p>Some to plot deeds of private revenge, private cruelty&mdash;some to
  arrange their schemes of public insurrection&mdash;some to dally in secret
  corners with the fair patricians&mdash;some to drain mightier draughts than
  they had yet partaken, some to gamble for desperate stakes, all to drown care
  and the anguish of conscious guilt, in the fierce pleasure of excitement.</p>

  <p>Apart from the rest, stood two of the elder Gauls, in deep and eager
  conference&mdash;one the white-headed chief, and leader of the embassy, the
  other a stately and noble-looking man of some forty-five or fifty years.</p>

  <p>They were watching their comrade, who had just stolen away, with one arm
  twined about the fair Sempronia's waist, and her hand clasped in his, through
  the inner peristyle, into the women's chambers.</p>

  <p>"Feargus, I doubt him," said the old man in a low guarded whisper. "I
  doubt him very sorely. These Roman harlots are made to bewitch any man, much
  more us Gael, whose souls kindle at a spark!"</p>

  <p>"It is true, Phadraig," answered the other, still speaking in their own
  tongue. "Saw ever any man such infamy?&mdash;And these&mdash;these dogs, and
  goats, call us barbarians! Us, by the Spirit of Thunder! who would die fifty
  deaths every hour, ere we would see our matrons, nay! but our matrons' basest
  slaves, demean themselves as these patricians! Base, carnal, bloody-minded
  beasts are they&mdash;and yet forsooth they boast themselves the masters of
  the world."</p>

  <p>"Alas! that it should be so, Feargus," answered the other. "But so it is,
  that they <i>are</i> masters, and shall be masters yet awhile, but not long.
  I have heard, I have seen among the mist of our water-falls, the avalanches
  of our hills, the voices and the signs of Rome's coming ruin, but not yet.
  Therefore it is that I counselled peace."</p>

  <p>"I know that thou art Taishatr, the great seer of our people," replied the
  other with an expression of deep awe on his features&mdash;"Shall Rome indeed
  so perish!"</p>

  <p>"She shall, Feargus. Her sons shall forget the use of the blade, her
  daughters of the distaff&mdash;for heroes and warriors she shall bring forth
  pipers and fiddlers, pandars and posturers; for heroines and matrons,
  songstresses, dancing girls, and harlots. The beginning thou seest now, the
  end cometh not in ages."</p>

  <p>"And our people, Phadraig, our northern races"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Shall govern and despise them! our arms shall carry devastation into
  regions of which their Consuls never heard, and under Gaelic eagles; our
  <i>men</i> shall wield thunder louder and deadlier, than the bolts of Roman
  GODS. I have said, Feargus. It shall be, but not yet; nor shall our eyes
  behold it; but it shall soothe us yet, in these days of our country's
  desolation, to know how great she shall be hereafter, and these how less than
  little&mdash;the very name of Roman synonimous with slavery and
  degradation!"</p>

  <p>There was a long pause, during which neither of the chieftains spoke, the
  one musing over the strange visions, which are phenomena by no means unusual
  to mountaineers, in all ages; the other dreaming of future glory to his race,
  and aroused by the predictions of the seer, to an ecstacy, as it were, of
  expectant triumph.</p>

  <p>"Enough of this"&mdash;said the old man, at length. "As I said but now, I
  doubt Eachin sorely."</p>

  <p>"If he prove false, I will stab him to the heart, with my own hand, though
  he be my father's brother's grandson, and the best warrior of our tribe; but
  no, no, Phadraig, the boy is young, and his blood is hot and fiery; and the
  charms of that witch might well move a colder spirit&mdash;but he is true as
  steel, and wise and wary for one so young. He may sun himself in her smiles,
  or revel on her lips, but trust me, Eachin of the iron hand, will never
  betray council."</p>

  <p>"Keep your eye on him, nevertheless, Feargus," said the other, "and, as
  you said but now, kill him at once, if you perceive him false."</p>

  <p>"Ha! what! noble Patricius?" cried Lentulus, coming up to them suddenly,
  and addressing the old chief by his latinized name&mdash;"what is this that
  thou arguest so sagely, in thy sonorous and male tongue."</p>

  <p>"The might and majesty of Rome," answered the old man quietly, "and our
  people's misery and degradation."</p>

  <p>"Nay! nay! chief, be not downhearted. Look upward now, after dark night
  comes brilliant morning," said the Roman. "Your people shall rise ere long,
  to power and glory and dominion."</p>

  <p>"So I told Feargus."</p>

  <p>"Ha! the brave Ferragus! and doth he not credit your wisdom's
  prophecy."</p>

  <p>"I put all faith in Rome's gratitude, in Catiline's valor and
  justice."</p>

  <p>"Aye! when we once have put down this faction, we will do justice to our
  friends."</p>

  <p>"And we are of the number!"</p>

  <p>"Surely, the twenty thousand horse, which you have promised us, are twenty
  thousand pledges of your friendship, as many claims on our favor."</p>

  <p>"See, here comes Eachin," said the old man; "and time wears onward, it is
  nigh midnight. We must away to our lodgings. Our train awaits us, and we but
  tarry for your envoy and the letters."</p>

  <p>"Titus Volturcius! I will go fetch him hither. He hath our letters sealed
  and ready. He is but draining a last cup, with our brave Cethegus. I will go
  fetch him." And, with the words, he turned away, gathering his toga in superb
  draperies about his stately person, and traversing the corridor with proud
  and measured strides, and as he went, muttered through his teeth&mdash;"The
  fool barbarians! As if we would give them anything but chains and scourges!
  The poor benighted idiots!"</p>

  <p>"Ho, Eachin, where left you our fair hostess?" asked Feargus in
  Latin&mdash;"methinks you are smitten somewhat with her beauty!"</p>

  <p>"She is very beautiful!" said the old chieftain gravely.</p>

  <p>"Beautiful! Feargus! Phadraig! beautiful, did ye say?" and the youth gazed
  at them in wonder, "That vile sensual, soulless harlot! she beautiful! Then
  virtue must be base indeed, and honor shameful!" he cried, with noble
  indignation, in his own Galic tongue, his eyes flashing, and his cheek
  burning crimson.</p>

  <p>"Why, if you held her then so cheaply, have you so much affected her
  society?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! you suspect me, Feargus. But it needs not. The barbarian hath some
  shrewdness, and some honesty. Sempronia too, suspected us, and would have won
  my secret from me, had I indeed a secret, by sweet words and sweeter
  kisses."</p>

  <p>"And thou"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Gave kiss for kiss, with interest; and soft word for soft word. I have
  sighed as if I were any Roman&mdash;but no secret, Feargus; Phadraig, no
  secret. Do you doubt me?"</p>

  <p>"Not I, boy," answered the warrior. "Your father was my cousin, and I
  think you are not a bastard."</p>

  <p>"I think not either. But see, here come these <i>noble</i> Romans!"</p>

  <p>"It is their envoy with the letters for their leader. We shall be
  dismissed now, from this haunt of thieves and harlots!"</p>

  <p>"And laughed at, when dismissed, for fools and barbarians!"</p>

  <p>"One never knows who is the fool, till the game is lost."</p>

  <p>"Nor who is laughed at 'till it is won!"</p>

  <p>"Here is our Titus, my good friends," said Lentulus, coming forward,
  leading along with him a slightly-made but well-formed and active-looking
  man, with a downcast yet roving eye, and a sneering lip, as if he were one
  who believing nothing, deserved not to be believed in anything himself. "He
  hath the letters, and credentials secured on his person. On his introduction,
  our Catiline shall know you as true friends, and as such receive and reward
  you!"</p>

  <p>"Titus Volturcius, is welcome. We tarried but for him, we will now take
  our leaves, with thanks for your gracious courtesies."</p>

  <p>"A trifle, a mere trifle," said Sempronia, who had that moment
  returned&mdash;"We only desired to teach you how we Romans live in our homes
  daily."</p>

  <p>"A very pleasant lesson, ha! my young friend"&mdash;said Lentulus to
  Eachin; and then he said out to Cethegus, in Greek, "I am compelled to call
  the Highland bull my friend, for his accursed name would break the jaws of
  any Roman&mdash;there is no twisting it into Latin!"</p>

  <p>"Hush! he will hear you, Lentulus," said the other. "I believe the brutes
  hear with their eyes, and understand through their finger-ends," and he too
  used the same language; yet, strange to say, it would have seemed as if the
  young man did in some sort comprehend his words, for his cheek turned fiery
  red, and he bit his lip, and played nervously with the hilt of the
  claymore.</p>

  <p>"Thou will not forget the lesson!" whispered Sempronia.</p>

  <p>"Never!" replied the Highlander. "Never while one red drop runs in these
  veins. And the last drop in them will I shed gladly, to teach these noble
  Romans how grateful a barbarian can be, poor though he be and half savage,
  for being thus instructed in Roman hospitality and Roman virtue! Farewell, ye
  noble Senators, farewell most beautiful and noble matron!"</p>

  <p>And with deep salutations, half dignified, half awkward, the Gauls strode
  away, into the quiet and moon-lighted streets, strange contrast to the glare
  and riot of those patrician halls and polluted chambers.</p>

  <p>"A singular speech that!" said Cethegus musing. "It sounded much as if it
  might bear a double meaning! could it be irony and cover treason?"</p>

  <p>"Irony in a stupid Gaul! thou art mad, Cethegus, to think of it!" said
  Autronius with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"I should as soon look for wit in an elephant," said Longinus Cassius.</p>

  <p>"Or I for love in a cold lizard!" cried Sempronia, laughing.</p>

  <p>"You found some love in the barbarian, I think, my Sempronia?" exclaimed
  Cethegus.</p>

  <p>"More warmth than wit, I assure you," she replied still laughing. "I acted
  my part with him rarely. If he were inclined once to play us false, he is
  bound to us now by chains"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Of roses, fair one?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind. If he break them, call me"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Chaste? Sempronia"&mdash;enquired Caeparius, interrupting her.</p>

  <p>"Audacious!" she answered with an affected frown, amid the laugh which
  followed the retort.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of it, my Lentulus?" asked Cethegus, who although he
  had jested with the others, did not by any means appear satisfied in his
  mind, or convinced of the good faith of the Highlanders.</p>

  <p>"That it is two hours now past midnight," answered Lentulus yawning, "and
  that I am amazing sleepy. I was not in bed till the third watch last night,
  writing those letters, ill luck to them. That is what I think, Cethegus. And
  that I am going to bed now, to trouble myself about the matter no more, until
  the Saturnalia."</p>

  <p>And so that company broke up, never to meet again, on this side Hades.</p>

  <p>Not long thereafter the Gauls, having reached their lodgings at the house
  of their patron Fabius Sanga, where everything had been prepared already for
  their departure, mounted their horses, and set forth on their way homeward,
  accompanied by a long train of armed followers; Titus Volturcius riding in
  the first rank, between the principal chiefs of the party.</p>

  <p>The moon had risen; and the night was almost as clear as day, for a slight
  touch of frost had banished all the vapors from the sky, and the stars
  sparkled with unusual brilliancy.</p>

  <p>Although it was clear and keen, however, the night was by no means cold,
  as it would have been under the like circumstances in our more northern
  climes; and the gardens in the suburbs of the city with their numerous clumps
  of stone-pine, and thickets of arbutus and laurestinus, looked rich and gay
  with their polished green foliage, long after the deciduous trees had dropped
  their sere leaves on the steamy earth.</p>

  <p>No sounds came to the ears of the travellers, as they rode at that dead
  hour of night through the deserted streets; the whole of the vast city
  appeared to be hushed in deep slumber, soon, Caius Volturcius boasted as they
  rode along, to burst like a volcano into the din and glare of mighty
  conflagration.</p>

  <p>They met not a single individual, as they threaded the broad suburra with
  their long train of slaves and led-horses; not one as they passed through the
  gorge between the Viminal and Quirinal hills, nor as they scaled the summit
  of the latter eminence, and reached the city walls, where they overlooked
  Sallust's gardens in the valley, and on the opposite slope, the perfumed hill
  of flowers.</p>

  <p>A sleepy sentinel unbarred the gate for the ambassadors, while four or
  five of his comrades sat dozing in their armor around a stove, in the centre
  of the little guard-house, or replenishing their horn cups, at short
  intervals, from an urn of hot wine, which hissed and simmered on the
  hearth.</p>

  <p>"Excellent guard they keep!" said Volturcius sneeringly, "right trusty
  discipline! of much avail would such watchers be, were Catiline without the
  walls, with ten thousand men, of Sylla's veterans."</p>

  <p>"And is your Catiline so great a captain?" asked the Highlander.</p>

  <p>"The best in Rome, since Sylla is no more! He learned the art of war under
  that grand, that consummate soldier! He was scarce second to him in his life
  time!"</p>

  <p>"Why, then, hath Rome found no service for him?" asked the Gaul. "If he,
  as you say, is so valiant and so skillful, why hath he not commanded in the
  east, in place of Pompey, or Lucullus?"</p>

  <p>"Jealousy is the bane of Rome! jealousy and corruption! Catiline will not
  pander to the pride of the insolent patricians, nor buy of them employments
  or honors with his gold."</p>

  <p>"And is <i>he</i> free from this corruption?"</p>

  <p>"No man on earth of more tried integrity! While all of Rome beside is
  venal, his hand alone is conscious of no bribe, his heart alone
  incorruptible!"</p>

  <p>"Thou must be a true friend of his; all men speak not so highly of this
  Catiline."</p>

  <p>"Some men lie! touching <i>him</i> specially, they lie!"</p>

  <p>"By the Gods! I believe so!" answered the old Gaul, with calm irony.</p>

  <p>"By Mars! and Apollo! they lie foully!"</p>

  <p>"I think I have heard one, at least, do so."</p>

  <p>"Thou shalt hear hundreds, if thou listen to them."</p>

  <p>"So many?"</p>

  <p>"Aye! by the Gods!&mdash;most of the&mdash;by your head! Patricius, that
  was a man, I think; armed too; who looked forth from behind yon buttress of
  the bridge."</p>

  <p>"No! no! Volturcius, 'twas but the shadow of yon pine tree, waving athwart
  the moonlight. I marked it long since," answered the wily Gaul. "Proceed, I
  pray you&mdash;most of the what, wert thou about to say?"</p>

  <p>But, by this time, the speakers had advanced to the centre of the long
  Mulvian bridge, a magnificent stone structure crossing the broad and sluggish
  Tiber, two miles below the city; and giving access to the far-famed Flaminian
  way.</p>

  <p>Their train, following closely after them, had all entered into the
  defile, the last of them having already passed the abutment nearest to Rome,
  when a loud shout arose from either side the bridge; and from the thickets
  and gardens at each extremity forth rushed a band of stout youths armed with
  casques and cuirasses of bronze, with the oblong shields and Spanish stabbing
  swords of the legionaries.</p>

  <p>Each band was led by a Praetor, Lucius Valerius Flaccus commanding at the
  end next Rome, and Caius Pomptinus, on the Emilian way, and each fell into
  accurate and beautiful array, barring the outlets of the bridge with a triple
  file of bright blades and sturdy bucklers.</p>

  <p>Nor was this all; for a little party was pushed forward on each flank,
  with bows and javelins, ready to enfilade the narrow pass with cross shot of
  their missiles, in case any attempt should be made to force a passage. And at
  the end, moreover, of the bridge toward Etruria and the camp of Catiline, at
  which such an attempt was most likely to occur, the glittering helmets and
  crimson horsehair crests of a troop of cavalry were seen glancing in the
  moonbeams, as they wheeled into line behind the footmen, ready to charge at
  once should the infantry be broken.</p>

  <p>"Stand! stand!" cried the soldiery at each end. "Stand and surrender!"</p>

  <p>But the younger men of the Gauls, unsheathing their claymores, set up
  their terrible slogan, or Celtic battle cry; and, plunging their spurs into
  the sides of their fiery horses came thundering across the bridge with a
  charge that would probably have trodden the Praetor's infantry under foot,
  had not the old chief, whom the Romans called Patricius, and Ferragus reined
  their steeds suddenly across the way, calling upon their men to halt and be
  steady.</p>

  <p>But Volturcius, knowing too well the consequence of being taken, dashed
  forward with his sword drawn; and made a desperate attempt to cut his way
  through the infantry, striking down two or three, slashing and stabbing to
  the right and left, displaying singular skill in the use of his weapon, and
  extreme personal intrepidity.</p>

  <p>"Treason! treason, my friends!" he shouted. "Ho, Ferragus, Patricius, ho!
  Charge, charge, men, gallantly. They are but a handful!" and still he plied
  his blade, which was now crimson to the hilt, with fearful energy.</p>

  <p>"No! no! not so!" cried the ambassadors&mdash;"lay down your arms! it is
  the praetor's train. Lay down your arms! all shall be well, if you resist
  not."</p>

  <p>And at the same time, "Yield thee! yield thee! Volturcius," cried
  Pomptinus. "We are friends all; and would not hurt thee&mdash;but have thee
  we must, and thy letters.&mdash;Dost thou not know me, Titus?"</p>

  <p>"Very well, Caius," cried the other, still fighting desperately against a
  host; for the men were commanded not to kill, but to take him alive at all
  hazards. "I know thee very well; but I will not yield to thee! So take that,
  Praetor!" and, with the word, he dealt him a blow on his crest that brought
  him to his knee in a moment.</p>

  <p>"He is a mad man!" cried a veteran legionary. "We must kill him!"</p>

  <p>"Not for your lives," shouted Pomptinus, and springing to his feet he
  plunged his sword home into his horse's chest, up to the very hilt; and then
  leaping on one side nimbly, as the animal fell headlong, being slain
  outright, he seized Volturcius by the shoulder, and pulled him down from the
  saddle.</p>

  <p>But even at this disadvantage, the conspirator renewed the single combat
  with the praetor; until at length, assured by his repeated promises that his
  life should be spared, he yielded his sword to that officer, and adjuring him
  in the name of all the Gods! to protect him, gave himself up a prisoner, as
  if to avowed enemies.</p>

  <p>Those of the Gauls, who had been ignorant, at first, what was in progress,
  perceiving now that the whole matter had been arranged with the concurrence
  of their chiefs, submitted quietly; and two or three of the praetor's people
  who had been wounded being accommodated with temporary litters made of
  bucklers and javelins with watch cloaks thrown over them, the whole party
  turned their horses' heads, and directed their march toward Rome.</p>

  <p>And silence, amid which the gentle murmur of the river, and the sigh of
  the breeze were distinctly audible, succeeded to the clang of arms, and the
  shouts of the combatants, unheard for many a year, so near to the walls of
  the world's metropolis.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch210"
     name="ch210"></a>X. &mdash; THE ARREST</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>Rebellious subjects; enemies of peace.</i>
     &mdash;Romeo and Juliet.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT was already daylight, when the loud clang and clatter of
  a squadron passing along the streets, at a sharp trot, aroused the citizens
  of Rome from their beds, for though the morning had broke, it was still very
  early.</p>

  <p>Many a lattice was opened, and many a head thrust out, as the troopers
  swept along with all their accoutrements jingling and clashing through the
  early silence, a spectacle which in ordinary times, would have excited much
  astonishment, perhaps aroused a tumult, since it was in direct opposition to
  the laws, that armed soldiers should enter the city walls in time of
  peace.</p>

  <p>But so much had the public mind been disturbed of late, that the sight,
  which a month before would have filled the streets with anxious or angry
  multitudes, now hardly seemed to merit a second glance, and the spectators
  hurried back to their couches, invoking the aid of the good Consul, who
  watched so well over the liberties and lives of Rome, or muttering curses on
  his head, according as they were well or ill-afflicted toward the state.</p>

  <p>One man there was, however, who was awakened by the clatter from the deep
  sleep of drunkenness, with a flushed face and an aching head, in a house on
  the Clivus Scauri, a steep street running down the southern slope of the
  Palatine, into the Cerolian Place, and overlooking the mansion of Cicero.</p>

  <p>Starting up from his low couch, he called out sharply and with a querulous
  accent to a freedman, who was watching his feverish slumbers, desiring him to
  look out and see what made that clatter.</p>

  <p>The man passed quickly into an adjoining room which commanded a view of
  the street, and returned instantly, saying,</p>

  <p>"It is a squadron of horse, Caeparius. Young Arvina's, I think; and they
  appear to be conducting a prisoner, for there is one man among them, in his
  tunic and abolla only, while the troopers around him have their swords
  drawn."</p>

  <p>Sobered at once, the conspirator leaped from his couch, and almost
  overthrew the attendant, in his eagerness to reach the window in time to
  observe the troopers.</p>

  <p>They were just halting in the Cerolian place, when he saw them, and
  dismounting, chargers and men in a confused and dusty group before the door
  of Cicero.</p>

  <p>He gazed, as if his eyes would burst from their sockets, if possibly he
  might distinguish the wearer of the rich blue riding cloak, of which he could
  catch glimpses among the glittering corslets and scarlet cassocks of the
  legionary horse. But for a while he gazed in vain.</p>

  <p>At length two figures mounted the marble steps, leading to the Tuscan
  colonnade, and were thus brought clearly into view, above the crested casques
  of the soldiery.</p>

  <p>One, a tall well-made figure, splendidly accoutred in the cavalry armor of
  the day, he recognized at once for Arvina, and in the stouter person, clad in
  the blue abolla, the color of which he had already connected with one whom he
  knew&mdash;his worst fears all realized&mdash;he discovered the messenger of
  treason, Titus Volturcius of Crotona.</p>

  <p>"By the Gods! all is lost," he muttered, striking his hand violently on
  his thigh. "Escape alone, is left to us. Ha!" he continued, addressing his
  freedman, "I will arise, and go forth speedily. Give me my tunic.
  So&mdash;never mind the feminalia; there, clasp my sandals! Death and furies!
  how slow thou art, now my dagger, and my toga. Hark, now. I go to the house
  of Lentulus. See thou, and have my chariot harnessed for a journey, with the
  four Thracian steeds; put into it my armor, a sword, casque and buckler for
  thyself; and all the gold which is locked in the great chest in the Atrium.
  Here is the key. Tarry not for thy life, and bring the car thyself to the
  arch of Fabius Allobrox; wait there until I come to thee. I will be there
  within the hour."</p>

  <p>"It shall be done, Caeparius."</p>

  <p>"See that it <i>be</i> done, if thou wouldst scape the scourge!" and with
  the word he rushed out of the chamber, as if the avenger of blood were at his
  heels.</p>

  <p>But the freedman looked after him, with a bitter and scornful smile, and
  muttered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The scourge!&mdash;the scourge! and I a freedman! This is another friend
  of the people. His villanies, I fancy, are near upon detection, and he would
  fly to join Catiline, but I will thwart him."</p>

  <p>In the meantime, quitting his own house in great trepidation, the
  conspirator walked very rapidly through the streets, until he reached the
  house of Lentulus, which was not far distant from the forum.</p>

  <p>He was admitted instantly, and without question, for all the slaves knew
  him, as the intimate friend of their master; but at the bed room door, he was
  stopped by the favorite freedman of Lentulus, who urged that his lord had not
  retired till morning, and had desired that he should not be disturbed earlier
  than noon.</p>

  <p>Caeparius, on the other hand insisted, raising his voice so loudly that
  the sleeper was awakened, and recognizing the accent of his friend, cried out
  peevishly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Oh! let him in, Agathon; let him in quickly, or he will talk thee deaf,
  and me frantic! What in the name of Proserpine and Pluto! is it now?"</p>

  <p>"The plot is discovered! all is lost!" exclaimed the other, forgetting all
  prudence in the haste and terror of the moment.</p>

  <p>"To the abyss of Tartarus with the plot, and thee also!" replied the other
  savagely. "I hope it <i>is</i> discovered, for I shall get some sleep then. I
  have had none these six months."</p>

  <p>And turning on his other side, he drew the embroidered coverlid over his
  head, and appeared to court the interrupted slumber.</p>

  <p>"By all Gods! I tell thee, Lentulus, Volturcius is arrested. These eyes
  beheld him dragged into the house of Cicero. My chariot waits me now, at the
  arch of Fabius. I go to join Catiline."</p>

  <p>"I prithee, then, go quickly&mdash;thou torturest me, man, I say. Get thee
  gone! get thee gone! Better to die, than to live thus sleepless."</p>

  <p>"Whom the Gods wish to ruin, they first dementate!" exclaimed
  Caeparius&mdash;"thou wilt be seized, within the hour."</p>

  <p>"I care not. So that till then I can sleep; once more, I
  say&mdash;Begone!"</p>

  <p>Caeparius shrugged his shoulders, and shook his head as he left the room;
  and then made the best of his way to the arch of Fabius; but he found not his
  chariot there, not though he waited well nigh two hours, did it arrive at
  all.</p>

  <p>Hopeless at length, and desperate, he set forth alone and on foot, in the
  vain hope of escaping the pursuit of Cicero's unerring justice.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, disturbed more than he would admit by Caeparius' tidings,
  Lentulus did, in some sort, arouse himself to consideration.</p>

  <p>"It may be so," he said to himself. "Caeparius declared he saw him. If it
  be so, 'twere better perhaps, indeed, to leave the city. And yet," he
  continued pondering deeply, "to fly is to admit guilt, and it is too late,
  moreover. Tush! tush! I daresay, it is but Caeparius' terror&mdash;he was a
  fool always, and I believe a coward also. Beside, if it be true, there is no
  proof; and what dare Cicero against me&mdash;against me, a Consular of
  Rome?&mdash;At the worst, he will implore me to deliver the city of my
  presence, as he did Catiline. Ha! Ha! I will to sleep again. Yet stay, I am
  athirst, after Sempronia's revel! Fool, that I was, not to drink more last
  night, and quench this fiery craving. Ho! Agathon, my boy, fetch me the great
  goblet, the double sextarius (29), of spiced mulse with a snow-water."</p>

  <p class="footnote">29. The latin Sextarius contained about 99-100 parts of
  an English pint.</p>

  <p>This order was obeyed instantly, and after draining the huge beaker to the
  bottom, the indolent and reckless traitor, rolled himself over, and was
  asleep again as soundly in five minutes, as if he were not in truth
  slumbering upon the brink of a volcano.</p>

  <p>Not long however did he sleep in peace, for Caeparius had scarcely been
  gone an hour, when he was again startled from his doze, by a knocking so
  violent, at the outer door, that the whole house rechoed with the din.</p>

  <p>He heard the doors opened, and a short angry parle, broken short by the
  raised voice of the new comers, and the clanging of armed footsteps, along
  the marble corridor which led toward his chamber.</p>

  <p>A moment afterward, pale as death, with his hair starting and a wild eye,
  Agathon entered the room.</p>

  <p>"How now?" exclaimed Lentulus, who fully aroused by this time, was sitting
  on the edge of the low bedstead, with a purple gown cast carelessly around
  him, "what is this new disturbance."</p>

  <p>"The Atrium is full of armed soldiers, Lentulus," replied the man with a
  faltering accent.</p>

  <p>"Well! hast thou never seen a soldier before, that thou starest so
  wildly?" asked his master with a sneer, which even the extremity of danger
  could not restrain.</p>

  <p>"Their leader insists on present speech with thee. I told him that thou
  wert asleep; but he replied that, waking or asleep, he must have speech with
  thee."</p>

  <p>"Truly a valiant leader," answered the Praetor. "Hath he a name, this bold
  centurion?"</p>

  <p>"Paullus Caecilius Arvina," replied the young man, who having followed the
  freedman to the door had overheard all that was passing, "is my name&mdash;no
  centurion, as thou mayest see, Lentulus. Loth am I to disturb thy
  slumbers."</p>

  <p>"Then wherefore do it, youth?" asked Lentulus, quickly. "Most broken
  things may be repaired, but I know not how you shall mend a broken nap, or
  recompense the loss of it, if irreparable."</p>

  <p>"Not of my own will, but by the Consul's order."</p>

  <p>"The Consul's? What? Antonius? He scarce need have sent a troop of horse,
  to ask an old friend to breakfast!"</p>

  <p>"Cicero sent me, Praetor, to crave your instant presence at his house,
  touching affairs of state."</p>

  <p>"Ha! Cicero!" said he, affecting to be much surprised. "Cicero scarcely is
  on such terms with me, as to take such a liberty, waking me thus at the dead
  of night."</p>

  <p>"It is well nigh the fourth hour, Lentulus."</p>

  <p>"What if it be, an I choose to call it midnight? and what, if I refuse to
  obey such unceremonious bidding?"</p>

  <p>"In that case, Lentulus, my orders are to compel your attendance. I have
  two decuries of men in your Atrium. But I trust that you will drive me to no
  such necessity."</p>

  <p>"Two decuries!" replied Lentulus scornfully. "I have but to lift my little
  finger, and my freedmen and slaves would kick your decuries, and yourself
  after them into the velabrum."</p>

  <p>The blood mounted to the brow of the young soldier. "I have endured," he
  said, "something too much of this. Will you go with us peacefully, Lentulus,
  or will you force us to take you through the street like a felon?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! peacefully, Arvina, peacefully. I did but jest with you, my hero. But
  I knew not that the cavalry of the seventh legion&mdash;the legion of Mars I
  think they call it&mdash;had become so degraded, as to do the work of
  thieftakers."</p>

  <p>"Nor I, Lentulus," answered Paul. "But you should know best in this
  matter. If it be theft for which thou art summoned before Cicero, then are we
  indeed thieftakers. But if so, not only I believe should we be the first
  legionaries of Rome so employed, but thou the first Roman Consular so
  guilty."</p>

  <p>"So proud! ha!" exclaimed the haughty conspirator, gazing at him with a
  curled lip and flashing eye. "Well, I could quell that pride in one moment,
  with <i>one</i> word."</p>

  <p>"Even so proud, because honest" answered the young man, as haughtily as
  the other. "For the rest, will you clothe yourself at once?&mdash;I can wait
  babbling here no longer."</p>

  <p>"I <i>will</i> quell it. Look you, boy, you love Julia, the bright
  daughter of Hortensia&mdash;she is worth loving, by the way, and Catiline
  hath noted it. You fancy that she is safe now, at the Latin villa of her
  mother. She is not safe&mdash;nor at the Latin villa! I have touched you,
  have I not?"</p>

  <p>Arvina started, as if a serpent had bitten him; but in a moment he
  recovered himself, saying calmly, "Tush! it is a poor deceit! you cannot
  alarm me."</p>

  <p>"In truth it was a deceit, but not so very poor after all, since it
  succeeded. You were sorely wounded a few days since, Arvina, and wrote, I
  think, to Julia, requesting her to set forth at once to Rome, with
  Hortensia."</p>

  <p>"Folly!" replied Arvina, "Drivelling folly! Come, hasten your dressing,
  Lentulus! You need not perfume your hair, and curl your beard, as if you were
  going to a banquet."</p>

  <p>"I never hasten anything, my Paullus. Things done hastily, are rarely
  things done well. What? thou dids't not write such a letter?&mdash;I thought
  thou hadst&mdash;of this at least I am sure, that she received such an one;
  and set out for Rome, within an hour after."</p>

  <p>"By the Gods!" exclaimed Paullus, a little eagerly, for Lentulus had
  changed the slight bantering tone in which he had been speaking, for a quick
  short decided accent seeming to denote that he was in earnest. "Where is she
  now. Speak, Lentulus, I adjure thee. Tell me, if thou wouldst have me serve
  thee!"</p>

  <p>"I thought I could abate that pride somewhat," said Lentulus sneeringly.
  "I thought so indeed. But, by all the Gods! Arvina, I know not where your
  Julia may be <i>now</i>. I know whither they are conveying her&mdash;where
  she soon will be&mdash;but I fancy that the knowing it, would give you but
  little pleasure; unless, indeed, you could prevent it, my poor youth!"</p>

  <p>"To know, is something at least toward preventing it. If, therefore, thou
  art not, as I believe indeed thou art, merely mocking me, I pray thee tell
  me, whither are they conveying her? Where will she soon be?"</p>

  <p>"To the camp of Manlius, nigh Fiesol! In the arms of one Lucius Sergius
  Catiline&mdash;a great admirer of your auburn-haired, blue-eyed beauties, my
  Arvina."</p>

  <p>The young man, with his eyes gleaming and his face crimsoning with furious
  rage, made two steps forward, and seizing the burly traitor by the throat,
  compressed his gullet, as if in an iron vice, and shook him to and fro as
  easily as if he had been a stripling.</p>

  <p>"Shame on thee, filth and carrion that thou art, so to speak of a
  betrothed bride to her promised husband! If it were true, wretched villain! I
  would save the hangman his task, and break your traitor's throat with this
  hand&mdash;but thou liest! thou liest!" he shouted, pushing him to the other
  end of the narrow sleeping chamber. "In poor revenge thou liest! But if you
  wish to live, beware how you so lie any more!"</p>

  <p>"I do not lie indeed, my dear Arvina," replied the other in a bland
  fawning voice full of mock humility. "But, I prithee, boy, keep thy hands
  from my throat in future, unless thou wouldst desire to know how a
  crook-bladed sica some sixteen inches long feels in the region of thy heart.
  Such an one as this, Arvina," he added, showing a long keen weapon not unlike
  a Turkish yatagan in shape, which he drew from beneath his pillow. Then
  casting it aside, with a contemptuous gesture, he continued&mdash;"But this
  is mere child's play. Now mark me. I did not lie, nor do! Aulus Fulvius wrote
  the letter&mdash;Aulus Fulvius' slave carried it, yester-even&mdash;Aulus
  Fulvius beset the road by which they must come&mdash;Aulus Fulvius is ere
  this time on his road many a league conveying her to Catiline&mdash;and
  this," he said, putting a small slip of parchment into the hands of the
  astonished Paullus, "is Aulus Fulvius' handwriting. Yes! certainly, that is
  his S in the word Salutem. He affects ever the Greek sigma in his writing. He
  is a very pretty penman, Aulus Fulvius!"</p>

  <p>The strip of parchment bore these words:</p>

  <p>"Whom I am you will know by the matter. The camp in Etruria will receive
  the dove from the Latin villa. All hath succeeded&mdash;health!"</p>

  <p>"I found it on my desk, when I returned from supper this morning. Aulus's
  slave brought it hither. He is within, if thou wouldst speak him."</p>

  <p>Arvina staggered back like a man who has received a mortal stab, as he
  read those fatal words; and stared about him with a wild and wandering
  eye.</p>

  <p>It was a moment or two before he could find any speech, and when he did
  speak at length, it was in tones so altered and broken that his nearest
  friend would not have recognized his voice.</p>

  <p>"Wherefore"&mdash;he gasped&mdash;"Wherefore have you done this to
  me."</p>

  <p>"For vengeance!" thundered the proud conspirator, casting his
  crimson-bordered toga over his laticlavian tunic. "For vengeance, boy. Lead
  on&mdash;lead on to your consul."</p>

  <p>"In what have I wronged you?" cried Arvina, in a paroxysm of almost
  unspeakable despair. "In what, that you should take such infernal
  vengeance?"</p>

  <p>"For Julia's love thou didst betray Catiline! betray <i>us</i>! In Julia's
  infamy thou shalt be punished!"</p>

  <p>"Anything! anything! anything but this&mdash;strike here, strike here with
  that sica, thou didst unsheath but now. Slay me, by inches if thou
  wilt&mdash;but spare her, oh! by your mother's memory! oh! by your sister's
  honor! spare her, and I will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lead on! To your consul!" exclaimed Lentulus waving his hand proudly to
  the door. "I can but die&mdash;the Gods be thanked for it! Thy life is
  bitterer than many deaths already! I say, coward and fool, lead on! Where is
  thy boasted pride? In the dust! at my feet! I trample, I spit on it! once
  again to your consul!"</p>

  <p>"And thou couldst save her!"</p>

  <p>"By a word! At a hint from me Fulvius will set her free."</p>

  <p>"But that word? but that hint?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My lips shall never utter&mdash;my hand indite; unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Unless? unless what?&mdash;speak! speak, Lentulus. By the Gods! By your
  head! By your life! speak."</p>

  <p>"Place me beyond the walls of Rome, with twenty of my freedmen, armed and
  mounted&mdash;it can be done on the instant; they are here; they are
  ready!&mdash;and Julia shall be in thy bosom ere to-morrow's sun shall sink
  behind the hills of Latium!"</p>

  <p>"A Traitor to my country! Lentulus, never!"</p>

  <p>"Tush! boy! think upon beautiful, soft, weeping, <i>innocent</i> Julia
  rescued by thee from Catiline&mdash;from pollution&mdash;think on her
  gratitude, her love, her kiss! Think on a life, a whole long life, of
  rapture!&mdash;and then balance against it one small foolish word&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dishonor!" Arvina interrupted him fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Aye! to which thou consignest Julia, whom thou <i>lovest</i>! Kind Venus
  guard me from such lovers!"</p>

  <p>"Dishonor never can come nigh her," replied Arvina, who had recovered his
  senses completely, and who, though unutterably wretched, was now as firm and
  as cold as marble. "Death it may be, but not dishonor!"</p>

  <p>"Be it so," answered Lentulus. "We will leave her the option of the two,
  but believe me, when dishonor is pleasant, women rarely choose death in
  preference to it. You have had your option too, my Arvina. But I, it seems,
  can have none, but must wait upon your consul."</p>

  <p>"You have the same which you give Julia!" answered Paullus, sternly.
  "There is your dagger, and your heart here!" he added, laying his hand on the
  broad breast of the infamous Patrician.</p>

  <p>"True! count its pulses&mdash;cooler, I think, and more regular than
  thine, Paullus. Tush! man! I know a hundred wiser things and pleasanter than
  dying. But once more, lead on! I will speak no word again till I speak to the
  consul!"</p>

  <p>And without farther words he strode to the door, followed closely by the
  young soldier, resolute and determined to perform his duty, let what might
  come of it! He passed through his marble peristyles, looked with a cool eye
  on his flowery parterres and sparkling fountains, nodded a careless adieu to
  his slaves and freedmen, and entered the Atrium where Arvina's troopers
  awaited him, wondering and impatient at the long delay.</p>

  <p>With a proud gesture he waved his hand toward the door, and six of the
  number marched forward, three and three, while the rest falling into regular
  array behind him, escorted him with all respect, but with stern watchfulness,
  along the Via Sacra to the Carinae.</p>

  <p>Quickly arriving at the Atrium of Cicero's house, which was filled with
  his friends and clients all in arms, and with many knights and patricians,
  whom he knew, but no one of whom saluted or seemed to recognize him, he was
  admitted into the Tablinum, or saloon, at the doors of which six lictors were
  on guard with their fasces.</p>

  <p>On entering this small but sumptuous chamber he found assembled there
  already, Cethegus, Statilius, and Gabinius, silent, with white lips, in an
  agony of terror worse than death.</p>

  <p>"Ha! my friends!" he exclaimed, with an unaltered mien and voice, "We are
  met once again. But we seem not, by all the Gods! to be well pleased with the
  meeting. Why so downcast, Cethegus?"</p>

  <p>"Because on earth it is our last meeting," he replied. And it was clear to
  see that the boldest and fiercest, and most furious of the band, while danger
  was afar, was the most utterly appalled now, when fate appeared imminent and
  certain.</p>

  <p>"Why, then!" answered Lentulus, "we shall meet in Hell, Cethegus."</p>

  <p>"By the Gods! jest not so foully&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wherefore not, I prithee? If that this be our last meeting, good faith!
  let it be a merry one! I know not, for my part, what ails ye all."</p>

  <p>"Are you mad? or know you not that Volturcius is a prisoner, and our
  letters in the hands of the consul? They will kill us ere noon."</p>

  <p>"Then they must make haste, Caius. It is noon already. But, cheer thee up,
  be not so much afraid, my brave Cethegus&mdash;they dare not slay us."</p>

  <p>"Dare not?"</p>

  <p>"For their own lives, they dare not!" But as he spoke, raising his voice
  to its highest pitch, the curtains which closed the other end of the Tablinum
  were suddenly drawn back, and Cicero appeared, clad in his consular robes,
  and with his ivory staff in his hand. Antonius his colleague stood in the
  intercolumniation, with all the lictors at his back, and many knights in
  their appropriate tunics, but with military cloaks above them in place of the
  peaceful toga, and with their swords girded by their sides.</p>

  <p>"Praetor," said Cicero in a dignified but serene voice, with no show of
  taunting or of triumph over his fallen enemy. "The Senate is assembled in the
  temple of Concord. The Fathers wait but for your coming. Give me your hand
  that I may conduct you thither."</p>

  <p>"My hand, consul? Not as a friend's, I trust," said the undaunted
  Traitor.</p>

  <p>"As a magistrate's, Cornelius Lentulus," replied Cicero severely, "whose
  hand, even if guilty, may not be polluted by an inferior's grasp."</p>

  <p>"As a magistrate's you have it, consul. We go?"</p>

  <p>"To the shrine of Concord! Antonius, my noble colleague, let us begone.
  Senators, follow us; escape you cannot, if you would; and I would spare you
  the disgrace of chains."</p>

  <p>"We follow, Cicero," answered Cethegus in a hollow voice, and casting his
  eyes with a wild and haggard expression on Gabinius, he added in a whisper,
  "to our death!"</p>

  <p>"Be it so!" replied the other. "One can but die once; and if his time be
  come, as well now as hereafter. I fear not death now, when I see it face to
  face. I think, I have heard thee say the same."</p>

  <p>"He spoke," answered Statilius, with a bitter and sarcastic laugh, "of the
  death of others then. Would God, he <i>then</i> had met his own! So should we
  <i>now</i> have been innocent and fearless!"</p>

  <p>"I at least, if not innocent, <i>am</i> fearless."</p>

  <p>And watched on every side by the knights, and followed by the lictors, two
  behind each, the ringleaders of the plot, all save Caeparius who had fled,
  and Catiline&mdash;who was in open arms, an outlaw and proclaimed enemy of
  his country&mdash;the ringleaders were led away to trial.</p>

  <p>The fate of Rome hung on the firmness of their judges.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch211"
     name="ch211"></a>XI. &mdash; THE YOUNG PATRICIAN</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>Not always robes of state are worn,<br>
  Most nobly by the nobly born.</i><br>
  &mdash; H. W. H.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE light of that eventful morning, which broke, pregnant
  with ruin to the conspiracy, found Aulus Fulvius and his band, still
  struggling among the rugged defiles which it was necessary to traverse, in
  order to gain the Via Cassia or western branch of the Great North Road.</p>

  <p>It had been necessary to make a wide circuit, in order to effect this,
  inasmuch as the Latin road, of which the Labican way was a branch, left the
  city to the South-eastward, nearly opposite to the Flaminian, or north road,
  so that the two if prolonged would have met in the forum, and made almost a
  right line.</p>

  <p>Nor had this been their only difficulty, for they had been compelled to
  avoid all the villages and scattered farm houses, which lay on their route,
  in the fear that Julia's outcries and resistance&mdash;for she frequently
  succeeded in removing the bandage from her mouth&mdash;would awaken suspicion
  and cause their arrest, while in the immediate vicinity of Rome.</p>

  <p>At one time, the party had been within a very few miles of the city,
  passing over the Tiber, scarce five miles above the Mulvian bridge, about an
  hour before the arrest of the ambassadors; and it was from this point, that
  Aulus sent off his messenger to Lentulus, announcing his success, thereby
  directly disobeying the commands of Catiline, who had enjoined it on him
  almost with his last words, to communicate this enterprise to none of his
  colleagues in guilt.</p>

  <p>Crossing the Flaminian, or great northern road, they had found a relay of
  fresh horses, stationed in a little grove, of which by this time they stood
  greatly in need, and striking across the country, at length reached the
  Cassian road, near the little river Galera, just as the sun rose above the
  eastern hills.</p>

  <p>At this moment they had not actually effected above ten miles of their
  journey, as reckoned from the gates of Rome to the camp of Catiline, which
  was nearly two hundred miles distant, though they had traversed nearly forty
  during the night, in their wearisome but unavoidable circuit.</p>

  <p>They were, however, admirably mounted on fresh horses, and had procured a
  <i>cisium</i>, or light carriage for two persons, not much unlike in form to
  a light gig, in which they had placed the unhappy Julia, with a slight boy,
  the son of Caius Crispus, as the driver.</p>

  <p>By threats of the most atrocious nature, they had at length succeeded in
  compelling her to temporary silence. Death she had not only despised, but
  implored, even when the point of their daggers were razing the skin of her
  soft neck; and so terribly were they embarrassed and exasperated by her
  persistence, that it is probable they would have taken her life, had it not
  been for fear of Catiline, whose orders were express to bring her to his camp
  alive and in honor.</p>

  <p>At length Aulus Fulvius had threatened in the plainest language outrages
  so enormous, that the poor girl's spirit sank, and that she took an oath, in
  order to avoid immediate indignities, and those the most atrocious, to remain
  silent during the next six hours.</p>

  <p>Had she been able to possess herself of any weapon, she would undoubtedly
  have destroyed herself, as the only means she could imagine of escaping what
  to her was worse than loss of life, the loss of honor; and it was chiefly in
  the hope of effecting this ere nightfall, that she took the oath prescribed
  to her, in terms of such tremendous sanctity, that no Roman would dream of
  breaking it, on any pretext of compulsion.</p>

  <p>Liberated by their success in this atrocious scheme, from that
  apprehension, they now pushed forward rapidly, and reached the station at
  Baccanae, in a wooded gorge between a range of low hills, and a clear lake,
  at about nine in the morning, of our time, or the third hour by Roman
  computation.</p>

  <p>Here they obtained a fresh horse for the vehicle which carried Julia, and
  tarrying so long only as to swallow a draught of wine, they pressed onward
  through a steep defile along which the road wound among wooded crags toward
  Sutrium.</p>

  <p>At this place, which was a city of some note, they were joined by forty or
  fifty partisans, well armed and mounted on good horses, all veteran soldiers
  who had been settled on the confiscated estates of his enemies by the great
  usurper Sylla, and thenceforth feeling themselves strong enough to overawe
  any opposition they might meet on the way, they journeyed at a slower rate in
  perfect confidence of success, numbering now not less than sixty
  well-equipped Cavaliers.</p>

  <p>Before noon, they were thirty miles distant from Rome, and had reached the
  bottom of a long and almost precipitous ascent where the road, scorning any
  divergence to the right or left, scaled the abrupt heights of a craggy hill,
  known at the present day as the Monte Soriano, the ancient name of which has
  not descended to these times.</p>

  <p>Scarcely however had they reached the first pitch of the hill, in loose
  and straggling order, when the rearmost rider, came spurring furiously to the
  head of the column, and announced to Aulus Fulvius, that they were pursued by
  a body of men, nearly equal to themselves in number, who were coming up at a
  rate so rapid, as made it certain that they would be overtaken, encumbered as
  they were with the wheeled carriage conveying the hapless Julia.</p>

  <p>A brief council was held, in which, firmly resisting the proposal of the
  new-comers to murder their captive, and disperse in small bodies among the
  hills, Aulus Fulvius and Caius Crispus determined on dividing their men into
  two parties. The first of these, commanded by the smith, and consisting of
  two-thirds of their whole force, was destined to press forward as rapidly as
  possible; while Fulvius, with the second, should make a charge down hill upon
  the pursuers, by which it was hoped that they might be so effectually checked
  and alarmed as to give up the pursuit.</p>

  <p>No time was lost in the execution, a second horse was attached to the
  <i>cisium</i>, for they had many sumpter animals along with them, and several
  spare chargers; and so much speed did they make, that Crispus had reached the
  summit of the ridge and commenced the descent before the pursuers had come up
  with Fulvius and the rear.</p>

  <p>There is a little hollow midway the ascent, which is thickly set with
  evergreen oaks, and hollies, and in the centre of this hollow, the road makes
  a turn almost at right angles.</p>

  <p>Behind the corner of the wood, which entirely concealed them from any
  persons coming up the hill, Aulus drew up his men in double lines, and as the
  band, whom he suspected to be in pursuit of him, came into the open space, in
  loose array, and with their horses blown and weary, he charged upon them with
  a fierce shout, and threw them into disorder in a moment.</p>

  <p>Nothing could indicate more clearly, the utter recklessness of the
  Catilinarian party, and the cheap estimate at which they held human life,
  than the perfect unconcern with which they set upon a party of men, whose
  identity with those whom they feared was so entirely unproved.</p>

  <p>Nothing, at the same time, could indicate more clearly, the fury and
  uncalculating valor which had grown up among them, nurtured by the strange
  policy of Catiline, during a peace of eighteen years' duration.</p>

  <p>Eighteen men, for, Aulus Fulvius included, they numbered no more, set
  fiercely upon a force of nearly three times their number, with no advantage
  of arms or accoutrement, or even of discipline, for although all old
  soldiers, these men had not, for years, been accustomed to act together, nor
  were any of them personally acquainted with the young leader, who for the
  first time commanded them.</p>

  <p>The one link which held them together, was welded out of crime and
  desperation. Each man knew that his neighbor, as well as himself, must win or
  die&mdash;there was no compromise, no half-way measure that could by any
  possibility preserve them.</p>

  <p>And therefore as one man they charged, as one man they struck, and death
  followed every blow.</p>

  <p>At their first onset, with horses comparatively fresh, against the blown
  chargers and disordered mass of their pursuers, they were entirely
  successful. Above a dozen of their opponents went down horse and man, and the
  remainder were driven scattering along the slope, nearly to the foot of the
  declivity.</p>

  <p>Uncertain as he had been at the first who were the men, whom he thus
  recklessly attacked, Aulus Fulvius had not well turned the angle of the wood,
  before he recognized the faces of almost all the leading men of the opposite
  party.</p>

  <p>They were the oldest and most trusty of the clients of his house; and half
  a dozen, at the least, of his own name and kindred led them.</p>

  <p>It needed not a moment therefore, to satisfy him that they were in quest
  of himself, and of himself alone&mdash;that they were no organized troop and
  invested with no state authority, but merely a band suddenly collected from
  his father's household, to bring him back in person from the fatal road on
  which he had entered so fatally.</p>

  <p>Well did he know the rigor of the old Roman law, as regarded the paternal
  power, and well did he know, the severity with which his father would execute
  it.</p>

  <p>The terrors inspired by the thought of an avenging country, would have
  been nothing&mdash;the bare idea of being surrendered a fettered captive to
  his dread father's indignation, maddened him.</p>

  <p>Fiercely therefore, as he rushed out leading his ambushed followers, the
  fury of his first charge was mere boy's play when compared to the virulent
  and concentrated rage with which he fought, after he had discovered fairly
  against whom he was pitted.</p>

  <p>Had his men shared his feeling, the pursuers must have been utterly
  defeated and cut to pieces, without the possibility of escape.</p>

  <p>But while he recognized his personal enemies in the persons he attacked,
  the men who followed him as quickly perceived that those, whom they were
  cutting down, were not regular soldiers, nor led by any Roman magistrate.</p>

  <p>They almost doubted, therefore, as they charged, whether they were not in
  error; and when the horsemen of the other faction were discomfitted and
  driven down the hill on the instant, they felt no inclination to pursue or
  harass them farther.</p>

  <p>Not so, however, Aulus. He had observed in the first onset, the features
  of a cousin, whom he hated; and now, added to other motives, the fierce
  thirst for his kinsman's blood, stirred his blood almost into frenzy.
  Knowing, moreover, that he was himself the object of their pursuit, he knew
  likewise that the pursuit would not be given up for any casual check, but
  that to conquer, he must crush them.</p>

  <p>Precipitately, madly therefore he drove down the hill, oversetting
  horseman after horseman, the greater part of them unwounded&mdash;for the
  short Roman sword, however efficient at close quarters and on foot, was a
  most ineffective weapon for a cavalier&mdash;until he reached the bottom of
  the hill.</p>

  <p>There he reined up his charger for a moment, and looked back, waving his
  hand and shouting loudly to bring on his comrades to a second charge.</p>

  <p>To his astonishment, however, he saw them collected in a body at nearly a
  mile's distance, on the brow of the first hill, beckoning him to come back,
  and evidently possessed by no thought, less than that of risking their lives
  or liberty by any fresh act of hostility.</p>

  <p>In the mean time, the fugitives, who had now reached the level ground and
  found themselves unpressed, began to halt; and before Aulus Fulvius had well
  made up his mind what to do, they had been rallied and reformed, and were
  advancing slowly, with a firm and unbroken front, well calculated to deter
  his handful, which had already been diminished in strength, by one man
  killed, and four or five more or less severely wounded, from rashly making
  any fresh attack.</p>

  <p>Alone and unsupported, nothing remained for him but to retreat if
  possible, and make his way back to his people, who, he felt well assured
  would again charge, if again menaced with pursuit. To do this, however, had
  now ceased to be an easy, perhaps to be a feasible matter.</p>

  <p>Between himself and his own men, there were at least ten of his father's
  clients; several of them indeed were wounded, and all had been overthrown in
  the shock either by himself or his troopers; but they had all regained their
  horses, and&mdash;apparently in consequence of some agreement or tacit
  understanding with his comrades, were coming down the hill at a gentle trot
  to rejoin their own party.</p>

  <p>Now it was that Aulus began to regret having sent forward the smith, and
  those of the conspirators to whom he was individually known, with Julia in
  the van. Since of the fellows who had followed him thus far, merely because
  inferior will always follow superior daring, and who now appeared mightily
  inclined to desert him, not three were so much as acquainted with his name,
  and not one had any intimacy with him, or indeed any community of feeling
  unless it were the community of crime.</p>

  <p>These things flashed upon Aulus in an instant; the rather that he saw the
  hated cousin, whom he had passed unnoticed in his headlong charge, quietly
  bringing the clients into line between himself and his wavering
  associates.</p>

  <p>He was in fact hemmed in on every side; he was alone, and his horse, which
  he had taxed to the uttermost, was wounded and failing fast.</p>

  <p>His case was indeed desperate, for he could now see that his own faction
  were drawing off already with the evident intention of rejoining the bulk of
  the party, careless of his fate, and glad to escape at so small a
  sacrifice.</p>

  <p>Still, even in this extremity he had no thought of surrender&mdash;indeed
  to him death and surrender were but two names for one thing.</p>

  <p>He looked to the right and to the left, if there were any possibility of
  scaling the wooded slopes and so rejoining the sturdy swordsmith without
  coming to blows again with his father's household; but one glance told him
  that such hopes were vain indeed. On either hand the crags rose inaccessible
  even to the foot of man, unless he were a practised mountaineer.</p>

  <p>Then rose the untamed spirit of his race, the firm Roman hardihood,
  deeming naught done while anything remains to do, and holding all things
  feasible to the bold heart and ready hand&mdash;the spirit which saved Rome
  when Hannibal was thundering at her gates, which made her from a petty town
  the queen and mistress of the universe.</p>

  <p>He gathered his reins firmly in his hand, and turning his horse's head
  down the declivity put the beast to a slow trot, as if he had resolved to
  force his way toward Rome; but in a moment, when his manoeuvre had, as he
  expected caused the men in his rear to put their horses to their speed, and
  thus to break their line, he again wheeled, and giving his charger the spur
  with pitiless severity drove up the steep declivity like a thunderbolt, and
  meeting his enemies straggling along in succession, actually succeeded in
  cutting down two, before he was envelopped, unhorsed and disarmed, which, as
  his cousin's men came charging up and down the road at once, it was
  inevitable that he must be from the beginning.</p>

  <p>"Curses upon thee! it is thou!" he said, grinding his teeth and shaking
  his weaponless hand at his kinsman in impotent malignity&mdash;"it is thou!
  Caius. Curses upon thee! from my birth thou hast crossed me."</p>

  <p>"It were better thou hadst died, Aulus," replied the other solemnly, but
  in sorrow more than anger, "better that thou hadst died, than been so led
  back to Rome."</p>

  <p>"Why didst <i>thou</i> not kill me then?" asked Aulus with a sneer of
  sarcastic spite&mdash;"Why dost thou not kill me now."</p>

  <p>"Thou art <i>sacro sanctus</i>!" answered the other, with an expression of
  horror in his eyes&mdash;"doomed, set apart, sanctified unto
  destruction&mdash;words, alas! henceforth avail nothing. Bind him"&mdash;he
  continued, turning toward his men&mdash;"Bind him, I say, hard, with his
  hands behind his back, and his legs under his horse's belly! Go your way," he
  added, "Go to your bloody camp, and accursed leader"&mdash;waving his hand as
  he spoke, to the veterans above, who seemed half inclined to make an effort
  to rescue the prisoner. "Go your way. We have no quarrel with you now; we
  came for him, and having got him we return."</p>

  <p>"What?" cried the dark-eyed boy who had come up too late to the Latin
  villa on the preceding night, and who, strange to state, was riding with the
  clients of the Fulvian house, unwearied&mdash;"What, will you not save
  <i>her</i>? will you not do that for which alone I led ye hither? will you be
  falsifiers of your word and dishonored?"</p>

  <p>"Alas!" answered Caius Fulvius, "it is impossible.&mdash;We are
  outnumbered, my poor boy, and may not aid you, as we would; but be of good
  cheer, this villain taken, they will not dare to harm her."</p>

  <p>The youth shook his head mournfully; but made no reply.</p>

  <p>Aulus, however, who had heard all that was said, glared savagely upon the
  boy, and after examining his features minutely for a moment
  exclaimed&mdash;"I know thy face! who art thou! quick thy name?"</p>

  <p>"I have no name!" replied the other gloomily.</p>

  <p>"That voice! I know thee!" he shouted, an expression of infernal joy
  animating his features. "Thou miserable fool, and driveller! and is it for
  this&mdash;for this, that thou hast brought the bloodhounds on my track, to
  restore <i>her</i> to <i>him</i>? Mark me, then, mark me, and see if I am not
  avenged&mdash;her dishonor, her agony, her infamy are no less certain than my
  death. Catiline, Catiline shall avenge me upon her&mdash;upon him&mdash;upon
  thee&mdash;thou weaker, more variable thing than&mdash;woman! Catiline!
  think'st thou he will fail?"</p>

  <p>"He hath failed ere now!" replied the boy proudly.</p>

  <p>"Failed! when?" exclaimed Aulus, forgetting his own situation in the
  excitement of the wordy contest.</p>

  <p>"When he crossed me"&mdash;then turning once more to the leader of the
  Fulvian clients, the dark-eyed boy said in a calm determined voice, "You will
  not, therefore, aid me?"</p>

  <p>"We cannot."</p>

  <p>"Enough! Look to him, then, that he escape you not."</p>

  <p>"Fear us not. But whither goest thou?"</p>

  <p>"To rescue Julia. Tell thou to Arvina how these things have fallen out,
  and whither they have led her; and, above all, that one is on her traces who
  will die or save her."</p>

  <p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Aulus savagely in the glee of his vengeful triumph,
  "Thou wilt die, but not save her. I am avenged, already&mdash;avenged in
  Julia's ruin!"</p>

  <p>"Wretch!" exclaimed his kinsman, indignant and disgusted&mdash;"almost it
  shames me that my name is Fulvius! Fearful, however, is the punishment that
  overhangs thee! think on that, Aulus! and if shame fetter not thy tongue, at
  least let terror freeze it."</p>

  <p>"Terror? of whom? perhaps of thee, accursed?"</p>

  <p>"Aulus. Thou hast&mdash;a father!"</p>

  <p>At that word father, his eyes dropped instantly, their haughty insolence
  abashed; his face turned deadly pale; his tongue <i>was</i> frozen; he spoke
  no word again until at an early hour of morning, they reached the house he
  had so fatally dishonored.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as the party, who had captured him, returned slowly with their
  prisoner down the mountain side, the last of the rebels having gallopped off
  long before to join the swordsmith and his gang, the boy, who took so deep an
  interest in Julia, dismounted from the white horse, which had borne him for
  so many hours with unabated fire and spirit, and leaving the high road,
  turned into a glade among the holm oaks, watered by a small streamlet,
  leading his courser by the rein.</p>

  <p>Having reached a secluded spot, quite removed from sight of the highway,
  he drew from a small wallet, which was attached to the croupe, some pieces of
  coarse bread and a skin of generous wine, of which he partook sparingly
  himself, giving by far the larger portion to his four-footed friend, who
  greedily devoured the cake saturated with the rich grape-juice.</p>

  <p>This done he fastened the beast to a tree so that he could both graze and
  drink from the stream; and then throwing himself down at length on the grass,
  he soon fell into a heavy and quiet sleep.</p>

  <p>It was already sunset, when he awoke, and the gray hues of night were
  gathering fast over the landscape; but he seemed to care nothing for the
  approaching darkness as he arose reinvigorated and full of spirit, and walked
  up to his horse which whinnied his joyful recognition, and tossed his long
  thin mane with a spirited and fiery air, as he felt the well-known hand
  clapping his high arched crest.</p>

  <p>"Courage! brave horse," he cried&mdash;"Courage, White Ister. We will yet
  save her, for&mdash;Arvina!"</p>

  <p>And, with the words he mounted, and cantered away through the gloom of the
  woodland night, on the road toward Bolsena, well assured of the route taken
  by Caius Crispus and his infernal crew.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch212"
     name="ch212"></a>XII &mdash; THE ROMAN FATHER</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>"Daughter, he fled.... That Flight was
     parricide."</i> &mdash;Mason's Caractacus.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE streets of Rome were in fierce and terrible confusion
  all that day long, on which the conspirators were arrested, and all the night
  that followed it.</p>

  <p>Late on the evening of that day, when it was already dark, the Consul had
  addressed the people by torch-light in the forum, delivering that superb
  speech, known as the third oration against Catiline.</p>

  <p>In it, he had informed them clearly of all the events which had occurred
  in the last twenty-four days, since the delivery of his second speech, more
  especially treating of those which had taken place in the preceding day and
  night.</p>

  <p>The conspiracy made manifest by overwhelming evidence&mdash;the arrest of
  the ambassadors, the seizure of the letters, the acknowledgment of those
  letters for their own by the terrified and bewildered traitors, and lastly
  the committal of the ringleaders of the plot to close custody, previous to
  the discussion of their fate&mdash;such were the wondrous and exciting facts,
  which he had announced to the assembled multitudes, inviting them to join him
  in a solemn thanksgiving to the Gods, and public celebration, decreed by the
  Senate to his honor; congratulating them on their escape from a danger so
  imminent and so general; and calling on them, in conclusion, to watch over
  the safety of the city by nocturnal guards and patroles, as they had done so
  diligently during all that emergency.</p>

  <p>The thundering acclamations, which greeted the close of that luculent and
  powerful exposition, the zeal with which the concourse hailed him unanimously
  Savior of Rome and Father of his country, the eagerness of affection with
  which all ranks and ages thronged around him, expressing their gratitude and
  their devotion, by all means imaginable, proved satisfactorily that, whatever
  might have been the result had massacre, plunder, and conflagration fallen
  upon them unawares, the vast mass of the people were now loyal, and true to
  their country.</p>

  <p>The seven hills never had resounded with louder din of civic triumph, than
  they did on that glorious night; not when the noble Scipio triumphed for
  Carthage overthrown; not when the mighty Marius (30), begirt with a host of
  captives and all the pomp of war, dismounted, happiest of men, from his
  Teutonic Car.</p>

  <p class="footnote">30. <i>Quid illo cive tulisset<br>
  Natura in terris quid Roma beatius unquam,<br>
  Si circumducto captivoum agmine, et omni<br>
  Belloram pomp, animam exhalasset opimam,<br>
  Quum de Teutonico vellet descendere Curru.</i></p><br>

  <p>The streets were as light as day with the glare of lamps, and torches, and
  bonfires blazing on all the circumjacent heights, as with tremendous shouts,
  and unpremeditated triumph, the mighty multitude escorted the great Consul
  home, not to his own house, where the rites of the Good Goddess were in
  celebration, and whither no male could be admitted, but to his next-door
  neighbor's mansion, in which he and his friends were entertained with more
  than regal splendor.</p>

  <p>What could have been more glorious, what more unmixed with any touch of
  bitterness, or self reproach, than Cicero's position on that evening?</p>

  <p>His country saved from miseries unparalleled&mdash;saved by himself
  alone&mdash;no aid of rival generals, no force of marshalled hosts to detract
  from the greatness of his own achievement&mdash;all the strife borne, all the
  success won, all the glory conquered by the force of his own genius, of his
  own moral resolution. No blood of friends had been spilt to buy that
  conquest, and wring its tribute of anguished sorrow from eyes bright with the
  mixed excitement of regret and triumph&mdash;no widow's tears, no orphan's
  sighs, had mounted heavenward amid those joyous conclamations.</p>

  <p>With no sword drawn, with no army arrayed, alone in his peaceful toga, he
  had conquered the world's peace; and, for that night at least, he enjoyed, as
  his great merit's meed, a world's gratitude.</p>

  <p>All night long had the streets been crowded with fond and ardent throngs
  of all ages, sexes, ranks, conditions, questioning, cheering, carolling,
  carousing&mdash;all, in appearance at least, unanimous in joy; for none dared
  in such an ebullition of patriotic feeling to display any disaffection.</p>

  <p>And the morrow dawned upon Rome, still noisy, still alive with tumultuous
  joy, still filled, through the whole area within its walls, by thousands, and
  tens of thousands, hoarse with shouting, weary almost of revelling, haggard
  and pale from the excess of excitement.</p>

  <p>Such was the scene, which the metropolis of the world presented, when at
  the second hour of the morning, on the day following the arrest of Lentulus,
  a small party consisting of about fifty horsemen, conducting a prisoner, with
  his arms bound behind his back, gagged, and with the lappet of his cloak so
  disposed as to conceal his face, entered the Quirinal gate, from the
  direction of the Flaminian way.</p>

  <p>They were the clients of the Fulvian House, leading the miserable Aulus
  homeward, under the command of his cousin. The horses were jaded, and
  bleeding from many a spur gall; the men were covered with dust and sweat; and
  several of their number were wounded; but, what at once struck the minds of
  all who beheld them, was that their faces, although stern and resolute, were
  grave, dejected and sad, while still it would seem that they were returning
  in triumph from some successful expedition.</p>

  <p>At any other time, the entrance of such a party would have awakened much
  astonishment and surprise, perhaps might have created a tumult among the
  excitable and easily agitated Romans; but now so strangely had the popular
  mind been stimulated during the last days, that they either paid no attention
  to the train at all, or observed, pointing to the prisoner, that there went
  another of the parricides.</p>

  <p>Just, however, as the new-comers entered the gate, another armed band met
  them, moving outward; the latter being a full troop, thirty in number, of
  cavalry of the seventh legion, with a banner, and clarion, and Paullus Arvina
  at their head, in complete armor, above which he wore a rich scarlet cloak,
  or <i>paludamentum</i>, floating over his left shoulder.</p>

  <p>The face of the young man was as pale as that of a corpse, his eyes were
  sunken, and surrounded by dark circles, his cheeks were hollow, and among the
  short black curls, which were visible beneath the brazen peak of his
  sculptured casque, there was one as white as snow.</p>

  <p>Since the dread news had reached him of Julia's abduction, he had not
  closed his eyes for a moment; and, although scarcely eight and forty hours
  had elapsed, since he received the fatal intelligence, he had grown older by
  many years.</p>

  <p>No one, who looked upon him, would have judged him to be younger than
  thirty-five or forty years, when he was in truth little more than half way on
  life's journey toward the second period.</p>

  <p>There was a cold firm determination too written on all his features, such
  as is rarely seen in young men; and the wild vacillating light which used to
  flicker so changefully over his fine face, was lost in an expression of
  mournful and despairing resolution.</p>

  <p>Still his attitude on his charger's back was fine and spirited; his head
  was proudly erect; and his voice, as from time to time, he uttered some
  command to his troopers, was clear, steady, and sonorous.</p>

  <p>So much indeed was he altered, that Caius Fulvius, who knew him well,
  gazed at him doubtfully for half a minute ere he addressed him, as the two
  troops came almost into contact, the mounted clients of the Fulvian House,
  withdrawing to the wayside to allow the legionaries to pass.</p>

  <p>Assured at last that it was indeed Arvina, he called out as he
  passed&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Tell me, I pray thee, Paullus, what means this concourse in the streets?
  hath aught of ill befallen?"</p>

  <p>"Ha! is it thou, Caius Fulvius?" replied Arvina. "I will speak with thee
  anon. Lead the men forward," he added, turning round in his saddle to the
  second Decurion of his troop, "my good Drusus. I will overtake you, ere you
  shall reach the Mulvian bridge." Here wheeling his horse to the side of the
  young nobleman, "Where hast thou been, Caius, that thou hast not heard? All
  the conspirators have been arrested. Lentulus, and Cethegus, Gabinius,
  Statilius, and Caeparius! They have confessed their letters&mdash;the Gaulish
  ambassadors, and Titus Volturcius have given evidence against them. The
  senate is debating even now on their doom."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! indeed! when did all this fall out?" enquired the other evidently
  in great astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday morning they were taken. The previous night, in the third
  watch, the ambassadors were stopped on the Mulvian bridge, and the
  treasonable papers found on Volturcius."</p>

  <p>"Ha! this is indeed news!" cried Caius. "What will befall Lentulus and the
  rest? Do men know anything!"</p>

  <p>"Death!" answered Arvina gravely.</p>

  <p>"Death! art thou certain? A Praetor, a consular of Rome! and all the
  others Senators! Death! Paullus?"</p>

  <p>"Death!" replied the other still more solemnly, than before. "Yet
  methinks! that rather should be a boon, than the fit penalty of such guilt!
  But where have you been, that you are ignorant of all this, and whom have you
  there?"</p>

  <p>Caius Fulvius shook his head sorrowfully, and a deep groan burst from the
  lips of the muffled man, a groan of rage mingled with hate and terror.</p>

  <p>"I will tell <i>thee</i>, Arvina," said the young man, after a moment's
  pause, during which Paullus had been gazing with a singular, and even to
  himself incomprehensible, emotion at the captive horseman. "We have been sent
  to fetch <i>him</i> back," and he pointed to his wretched cousin, "as he fled
  to join Catiline. We overtook him nigh to Volsinii."</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;who&mdash;" exclaimed Arvina in a terrible hoarse
  voice&mdash;"By all the Gods! who is he?&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aulus&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ha! villain! villain! He shall die by my hand!" burst from Arvina's lips
  with a stifled cry, and drawing his sword as he spoke, he made toward
  him.</p>

  <p>But Caius Fulvius, and several others of the clients threw themselves into
  the way, and the former said quietly but very firmly, "No&mdash;no, my
  Paullus, that must not be. His life is devoted to a baser doom; nor must his
  blood be shed by a hand so noble! But wherefore&mdash;Ha!" he exclaimed,
  interrupting himself in mid speech. "Ha! Julia, I remember&mdash;I
  remember&mdash;would to the Gods I could have rescued her."</p>

  <p>For one second's space Paullus Arvina glared upon the speaker, as if he
  would have stabbed him where he sat on his horse motionless and unresisting;
  then, shaking his head with an abrupt impatient motion as if to rid himself
  of some fixed image or impression, he said,</p>

  <p>"You are right, Caius. But tell me! by the Gods! was she with him? saw you
  aught of her, as you took him?"</p>

  <p>"She was in his power, my poor Paullus, as we were told at Sutrium; but
  when we overtook him, he had sent forward all his band but a small party, who
  fought so hard and handled us so roughly, that, he once taken, we dared not
  set on them again. But, be of good cheer, my Paullus. There is a gallant
  youth on the track of them; the same youth who went to save her at the Latin
  villa but arrived too late; the same who brought us the tidings of yon
  villain's flight, who led us in pursuit of them. He follows still, and swears
  that he will save her! The Gods grant it?"</p>

  <p>"A youth, ha! who is he?"</p>

  <p>"I know not. He refused to tell us, still saying that he was nameless. A
  slight slender black-eyed youth. Exceeding dark-complexioned, but handsome
  withal. You would have said, to look on him, he would lack strength to ride
  an hour; yet, by the God of Faith! he was in the saddle incessantly for
  nearly forty hours, and shewed less weariness than our sturdiest men. Never
  saw I such fiery will, and resolute endurance, in one so young and
  feeble."</p>

  <p>"Strange!" muttered Paullus&mdash;"strange! why came he not to me?"</p>

  <p>"He did go to your mansion, but found you not. You were absent on state
  business&mdash;then came he to the father of this demon, who sent us in
  pursuit, and we have, as I tell you, succeeded. May you do so likewise! He
  charged me to say to you 'there was one on her track who would die to save
  her.'"</p>

  <p>"'Tis passing strange! I may not even guess who it should be," he added
  musing, "the Gods give him strength. But tell me, Caius, can I, by any speed,
  overtake them?"</p>

  <p>"I fear me not, Paullus, ere they have reached the camp. They were nigh to
  Volsinii at noon yesterday; of course they will not loiter on the way."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" replied the unhappy youth, "Curses! curses! ten thousand curses on
  his head!" and he glanced savagely upon Aulus as he spoke&mdash;"to what doom
  do ye lead him?"</p>

  <p>"To an indignant father's pitiless revenge!"</p>

  <p>"May he perish ill!&mdash;may his unburied spirit wander and wail forever
  upon the banks of Acheron, unpardoned and despairing!"</p>

  <p>And turning suddenly away, as if afraid to trust himself longer in sight
  of his mortal enemy, he plunged his spurs deep into his charger's flank, and
  gallopped away in order to overtake his troop, with which he was proceeding
  to join the army which Antonius the consul and Petreius his lieutenant were
  collecting on the sea-coast of Etruria in order to act against Catiline.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the others rode forward on their gloomy errand toward the
  Fulvian House.</p>

  <p>They reached its doors, and at the trampling of their horses' feet, before
  any summons had been given, with a brow dark as night and a cold determined
  eye, the aged Senator came forth to meet his faithful clients.</p>

  <p>At the first glance he cast upon the party, the old man saw that they had
  succeeded; and a strange expression of satisfaction mixed with agony crossed
  his stern face.</p>

  <p>"It is well!" he said gravely. "Ye have preserved the honor of my house. I
  give ye thanks, my friends. Well have ye done your duty! It remains only that
  I do my own. Bring in your prisoner, Caius, and ye, my friends, leave us, I
  pray you, to our destiny."</p>

  <p>The young man to whom he addressed himself, leaped down from his horse
  with one or two of the clients, and, unbuckling the thong which fastened his
  cousin's legs under the belly of the beast he rode, lifted him to the ground;
  for in a sort of sullen spite, although unable to resist, he moved neither
  hand nor foot, more than a marble statue would have done; and when he stood
  on the pavement, he made no step toward the door, and it was necessary to
  carry him bodily up the steps of the colonnade, and through the vestibule
  into the atrium.</p>

  <p>In that vast hall a fearful group was assembled. On a large arm chair at
  the upper end sat an aged matron, perfectly blind, with hair as white as
  snow, and a face furrowed with wrinkles, the work of above a century. She was
  the mother of the Senator, the grandmother of the young culprit. At her right
  hand stood another large chair vacant, the seat of the master of the house;
  and at her left sat another lady, already far advanced in years, yet stately,
  firm, and unflinching&mdash;the wretched, but proud mother. Behind her stood
  three girls of various ages, the youngest not counting above sixteen years,
  all beautiful, and finely made, but pale as death, with their superb dark
  eyes dilated and their white lips mute with strange horror.</p>

  <p>Lower down the hall toward the door, and not far removed from the altar of
  the household gods, near the impluvium, stood a black wooden block, with a
  huge broad axe lying on it, and a grim-visaged slave leaning against the wall
  with folded arms in a sort of stoical indifference&mdash;the butcher of the
  family. By his trade, he little cared whether he practised it on beasts or
  men; and perhaps he looked forward with some pleasurable feelings to the
  dealing of a blow against one of the proud lords of Empire.</p>

  <p>No one could look upon that mute and sad assemblage without perceiving
  that some dread domestic tragedy was in process; but how dreadful no one
  could conceive, who was not thoroughly acquainted with the strange and
  tremendous rigor of the old Roman Law.</p>

  <p>The face of the mother was terribly convulsed, as she heard the clanging
  hoof tramps at the door; and in an agony of unendurable suspense she laid her
  hand upon her heart, as if to still its wild throbbing.</p>

  <p>Roman although she was, and trained from her childhood upward in the
  strictest school of Stoicism, he, on whom they were gathered there to sit in
  judgment, was still her first-born, her only son; and she could not but
  remember in this hour of wo the unutterable pleasure with which she had
  listened to the first small cry of him, then so innocent and weak and gentle,
  who now so strong in manhood and so fierce in sin, stood living on the verge
  of death.</p>

  <p>But now as the clanging of the horse hoofs ceased, different sounds
  succeeded; and in a moment the anxious ears of the wife and mother could
  discern the footsteps of the proud husband, and the fallen child.</p>

  <p>They entered the hall, old Aulus Fulvius striding with martial steps and a
  resolute yet solemn brow toward the chair of judgment, like to some warlike
  Flamen about to execute the wrath of the Gods upon his fated victim; the son
  shuffling along, with downcast eyes and an irregular pace, supported on one
  hand by his detested cousin, and on the other by an aged freedman of the
  house.</p>

  <p>The head of the younger Aulus was yet veiled with the lappet of his gown;
  so that he had seen none of those who were then assembled, none of the fatal
  apparatus of his fore-ordered doom.</p>

  <p>But now, as the old man took his seat, he made a movement with his hand,
  and Caius, obedient to the gesture, lifted the woollen covering from the
  son's brow, and released his hold of his arm. At a second wafture, the nephew
  and the freedman both departed, glad to be spared the witnessing a scene so
  awful as that which was about to ensue.</p>

  <p>The sound of their departing footsteps fell with an icy chill on the stout
  heart of the young conspirator; and although he hated the man, who had just
  left the room, more than any living being, he would yet willingly have
  detained him at that crisis.</p>

  <p>He felt that even hatred was less to be apprehended than the cold hard
  decision of the impassive unrelenting father, in whose heart every sentiment
  was dead but those of justice and of rigorous honor.</p>

  <p>"Aulus, lift up your eyes!"</p>

  <p>And, for the first time since he had entered the hall, the culprit looked
  up, and gazed with a wild and haggard eye on the familiar objects which met
  his glance on every side; and yet, familiar as they were, all seemed to be
  strange, altered, and unusual.</p>

  <p>The statues of his dead ancestors, as they stood, grim and uncouth in
  their antique sculpture, between the pillars of the wall, seemed to dilate in
  size, and, become gigantic, to frown stern contempt on their degenerate
  descendant. The grotesque forms of the Etruscan household Gods appeared to
  gibber at him; the very flames upon the altar, before them, cast lurid gleams
  and ominous to his distempered fancy.</p>

  <p>It was singular, that the last thing which he observed was that, which
  would have been the first to attract the notice of a stranger&mdash;the
  block, the axe, and the sullen headsman.</p>

  <p>A quick shudder ran through every limb and artery of his body, and he
  turned white and livid. His spirit was utterly appalled and broken; his
  aspect was that of a sneaking culprit, a mean craven.</p>

  <p>"Aulus, lift up your eyes!"</p>

  <p>And he did lift them, with a strong effort, to meet the fixed and
  searching gaze of his father; but so cold, so penetrating was that gaze, that
  his glance fell abashed, and he trembled from head to foot, and came well
  nigh to falling on the earth in his great terror.</p>

  <p>"Aulus, art thou afraid to die?&mdash;thou, who hast sworn so deeply to
  dye thine hands in <i>my</i> gore, in the gore of all who loved their
  country? Art thou afraid to die, stabber, adulterer, poisoner, ravisher,
  parricide, Catilinarian? Art thou afraid to die? I should have thought, when
  thou didst put on such resolves, thou wouldst have cast aside all that is
  human! Once more, I say, art thou afraid to die?"</p>

  <p>"To die!" he exclaimed in husky tones, which seemed to stick in his
  parched throat&mdash;"to die! to be nothing!"</p>

  <p>And again the convulsive shudder ran through his whole frame.</p>

  <p>But ere the Senator could open his lips to reply, the blind old grandam
  asked, in a voice so clear and shrill that its accents seemed to pierce the
  very souls of all who heard it&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Is he a coward, Aulus Fulvius? Is he a coward, too, as well as a villain?
  The first of our race, is he a coward?"</p>

  <p>"I fear it," answered the old man gloomily. "But, cowardly or brave, he
  must disgrace our house no farther. His time is come! his fate cries out for
  him! Aulus must die! happy to die without the taint of public and detected
  infamy&mdash;happy to die unseen in his father's house, not in the base and
  sordid Tullianum."</p>

  <p>"Mother! mother!" exclaimed the wretched youth in a paroxysm of agony.
  "Sisters, speak for me&mdash;plead for me! I am young, oh, too young to
  die!"</p>

  <p>"The mother, whom thou hast sworn to murder&mdash;the sisters, whose
  virgin youth thou hast agreed to yield to the licentious arms of thy foul
  confederates!" answered the old man sternly; while the women, with blanched
  visages, convulsed with agony, were silent, even to that appeal.</p>

  <p>"Speak, speak! will you not speak for me, for your first-born son, my
  mother?"</p>

  <p>"Farewell!"&mdash;the cold word came forth from her pallid lips, with a
  mighty effort&mdash;"Farewell, unhappy!" And, unable to endure the dreadful
  scene any longer, she arose from her seat, and laid her hand on the blind
  woman's arm. "Come," she said, "mother of my lord! our task is ended! his
  doom spoken! Let us go hence!"</p>

  <p>But the youngest sister, overcoming her fear of the stern father, her
  modesty of youth, and her sense of high-strained honor, cast herself at the
  old man's feet, and clung about his knees, crying with a shrill painful
  cry&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Oh, father! by your right hand! by your gray head! by all the Gods! I
  implore you, pardon, spare him!"</p>

  <p>"Up! up! base girl!" cried the old man; "wouldst have the infamy of our
  house made public? and thou, most miserable boy, spare her, thou, this
  disgrace, and me this anguish&mdash;veil thy head! bow thee to the block! bid
  the slave do his office! At least, Aulus, if thou hast not lived, at least
  die, a Roman!"</p>

  <p>The second of the girls, while her sister had made that fruitless appeal
  to the father's mercy, walked steadily to her brother, kissed his brow with a
  tearless eye, and in a low voice bade him "Farewell for ever!" then turned
  away, impassive as her father, and followed her mother and the blind grandam
  from the fatal hall.</p>

  <p>But the third daughter stepped up to the faltering youth with a hectic
  flush on her cheek, and a fitful fire in her eye, and whispered in his
  ear,</p>

  <p>"Aulus, my brother! unhappy one, it is vain! Thou <i>must</i> die, for our
  house's honor! Die, then, my brother, as it becomes a Fulvius, bravely, and
  by a free hand! Which of our house perished ever by a base weapon, or a
  slavish blow? Thou wert brave ever,&mdash;be brave now, oh! my brother!"</p>

  <p>And at her words, his courage, his pride, rallied to his aid; and he met
  her eye with a flashing glance, and answered in a firm tone, "I <i>will</i>,
  sister, I will die as becomes a Roman, as becomes a Fulvius! But how shall I
  die by a free hand, bound as I am, and weaponless?"</p>

  <p>"Thus, brother," she replied, drawing a short keen knife from the bosom of
  her linen stola; and severing the bonds which confined his elbows, she placed
  it in his hands. "It is keen! it will not fail you! it is the last gift of
  the last who loves you, Aulus!"</p>

  <p>"The best gift! Farewell, sister!"</p>

  <p>"Farewell, Aulus, for ever!" And she too kissed him on the brow; and as
  she kissed him, a hot tear fell upon his cheek. Then, turning toward her
  sister who was still clinging to the old man's knees, embarrassing him with
  useless prayers, so that he had observed none of that by-play, she said to
  her firmly,</p>

  <p>"Come, little girl, come! It is fruitless! Bid him farewell! he is
  prepared to die! he cannot survive his honor!"</p>

  <p>And she drew her away, screaming and struggling, with eyes deluged in
  tears, from the apartment wherein the Senator now stood face to face with his
  first born, the slave alone present as a witness of the last struggle.</p>

  <p>But Aulus had by this time recovered all the courage of his race, all his
  own natural audacity; and waving his hand with a proud gesture toward the
  slave, he exclaimed in tones of severe authority:</p>

  <p>"Dismiss that wretched slave, Aulus Fulvius. Ready I am to die&mdash;nay!
  I wish not to live! But it becomes not <i>thee</i> to doom me to such a
  death, nor <i>me</i> so to die! Noble I am, and free; and by a free hand will
  I die, and a noble weapon!"</p>

  <p>There was so much command, so much high pride, and spirit, in his tone,
  his expression, and his gesture, that an answering chord was struck in the
  mind of the old man; so that without reply, and without evincing any surprise
  at seeing the youth's arms unbound, he waved a signal to the slave to depart
  from the atrium.</p>

  <p>Then the youth knelt down on one knee before the altar, and cried aloud in
  a solemn voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, ye Gods of our house, for this dishonor which I have brought
  upon you; absolve me, ye grand ancestors; mine eyes are open now, and I
  perceive the sin, the shame, the sorrow of my deeds! Absolve me, ye great
  Gods, and ye glorious men; and thou, my father, think sometimes of the son,
  whom it repented of his guilt, but whom it pained not"&mdash;he raised his
  arm aloft, and the bright knife-blade glittered in the rays of the
  altar-fire, when the old Senator sprang forward, with all his features
  working strangely, and cried "Hold!"</p>

  <p>It might be that he had relented; but if it were so, it was too late; for,
  finishing his interrupted sentence with these words&mdash;</p>

  <p>&mdash;"to die for his house's honor!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>the young man struck himself one quick blow on the breast, with a hand so
  sure and steady, that the knife pierced through his ribs as if they had been
  paper, and clove his heart asunder, standing fixed hilt-deep in his chest;
  while, without word, or groan, or sigh or struggle, he dropped flat on his
  back beside the <i>impluvium</i>, and was dead in less time than it has taken
  to describe the deed.</p>

  <p>The father looked on for a moment calmly; and then said in a cool hard
  voice, "It is well! it is well! The Gods be thanked! he died as a Roman
  should!"</p>

  <p>Then he composed his limbs, and threw a white cloth which lay nigh the
  block, over the face and body of the wretched youth.</p>

  <p>But, as he turned to leave the atrium, nature was too strong for his
  philosophy, for his pride; and crying out, "My son! my son! He was yet mine
  own son! mine own Aulus!" and burying his face in his toga, he burst into a
  paroxysm of loud grief, and threw himself at length on the dead body: father
  and son victims alike to the inexorable Roman honor!</p>

  <h2><a id="ch213"
     name="ch213"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE DOOM</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>Without debatement further, more or less,<br>
  He should the bearers put to sudden death,<br>
  Not striving time allowed.</i><br>
  &mdash;Hamlet.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE nones of November (31) were perilous indeed to Rome.</p>

  <p class="footnote">31. The fifth day of November.</p>

  <p>The conspirators, arrested two days previously, and fully convicted on the
  evidence of the Gaulish ambassadors, of Titus Volturcius of Crotona, and of
  Lucius Tarquinius,&mdash;convicted on the evidence of their own
  letters&mdash;and lastly convicted by their own admissions, were yet
  uncondemned and in free custody, as it was termed; under the charge of
  certain senators and magistrates, whose zeal for the republic was
  undoubted.</p>

  <p>There was still in the city a considerable mass of men, turbulent,
  disaffected, ripe for tumult&mdash;there was still in the Senate a large
  party, not indeed favorable to the plot, but far from being unfavorable to
  the plotters,&mdash;Catiline was at the head of a power which had increased
  already to nearly the force of two legions, and was in full march upon
  Rome.</p>

  <p>Should the least check of the armies sent against him occur under such
  circumstances, there was but little doubt that an eruption of the Gladiators,
  and a servile insurrection, would liberate the traitors, and perhaps even
  crown their frantic rashness with success.</p>

  <p>Such was the state of things, on the morning of the nones; and the brow of
  the great Consul was dark, and his heart heavy, as he entered the Senate,
  convened on this occasion in the temple of Jupiter Stator, in order to take
  the voice of that body on the fate of Lentulus and the rest.</p>

  <p>But scarcely had he taken his seat, before a messenger was introduced,
  breathless and pale, the herald of present insurrection.</p>

  <p>The freedmen and clients of Lentulus were in arms; the gladiators and the
  slaves of Cethegus were up already, and hurrying through the streets toward
  the house of Quintus Cornificius, wherein their master was confined.</p>

  <p>Many slaves of other houses, and no small number of disaffected citizens
  had joined them; and the watches were well nigh overpowered.</p>

  <p>Ere long the roar of the mob might be heard even within those hallowed
  precincts, booming up from the narrow streets about the Forum, like the
  distant sound of a heavy surf.</p>

  <p>Another, and another messenger followed the first in quick
  succession&mdash;one manipule of soldiers had been overpowered, and driven
  into some houses where they defended themselves, though hard set, with their
  missiles&mdash;the multitude was thundering at the gates of the City Prisons;
  and, if not quelled immediately, would shortly swell their numbers by the
  accession of all the desperate criminals, convicted slaves, and reckless
  debtors, who were crowded together in those abodes of guilt and
  wretchedness.</p>

  <p>Then was it seen, when the howls of the rabble were echoing through the
  arches of the sanctuary wherein they sate; when massacre and conflagration
  were imminent, and close at hand; then was it seen, how much of real majesty
  and power resided still in the Roman Senate.</p>

  <p>Firm, as when Hannibal was thundering at their gates, solemn as when the
  Gaul was ravaging their city, they sat, and debated, grave, fearless, and
  unmoved.</p>

  <p>Orders were issued to concentrate forces upon the spot where the tumult
  was raging; the knights, who were collected under arms, in the whole force of
  their order, without the gates of the Temple as a guard to the Senate, were
  informed that the Fathers were sufficiently defended by their own sanctity;
  and were requested to march down upon the forum, and disperse the
  rioters.</p>

  <p>The heavy tramp of their solid march instantly succeeded the transmission
  of the order; and, in a short time after, the deep swell of their charging
  shout rose high above the discordant clamors of the mob, from the hollow of
  the Velabrum.</p>

  <p>Still, not a Senator left his seat, or changed countenance; although it
  might be seen, by the fiery glances and clinched hands of some among the
  younger nobles, that they would have gladly joined the knights, in charging
  their hereditary enemies, the Democratic rabble.</p>

  <p>The question which was then debating was of more weight, however, than any
  triumph over the mob; for by the decision of that question it was to be
  determined whether the traitors and the treason should be crushed
  simultaneously and forever, or whether Rome itself should be abandoned to the
  pleasure of the rebels.</p>

  <p>That question was the life or death of Lentulus, Cethegus, Gabinius,
  Statilius, and Caeparius; all of whom were in separate custody, the last
  having been brought in on the previous evening, arrested on his way to the
  camp of Catiline and Manlius.</p>

  <p>Should the Senate decree their death, the commonwealth might be deemed
  safe&mdash;should it absolve them, by that weakness, the republic must be
  lost.</p>

  <p>And on the turn of a die did that question seem to hang.</p>

  <p>Decius Junius Silanus, whose opinion was first asked, spoke briefly, but
  strenuously and to the point, and as became the Consul elect, soon to be the
  first magistrate of that great empire. He declared for the capital punishment
  of all those named above, and of four others, Lucius Cassius, Publius Furius,
  Publius Umbrenus, and Quintus Annius, if they should be thereafter
  apprehended.</p>

  <p>Several others of the high Patrician family followed on the same side; and
  no one had as yet ventured openly to urge the impunity of the parricides,
  although Tiberius Nero had recommended a delay in taking the question, and
  the casting of the prisoners meanwhile into actual incarceration under the
  safeguard of a military force.</p>

  <p>But it had now come to the turn of Caius Julius Caesar, the great leader
  then of the Democratic faction, the great captain that was to be in after
  days, and the first Emperor of subjugated Rome.</p>

  <p>An orator second, if second, to Cicero alone, ardent, impassioned, yet
  bland, clement, easy; liberal both of hand and council; averse to Cicero from
  personal pique, as well as from party opposition; an eager candidate for
  popular applause and favor, it was most natural that he should take side with
  the conspirators.</p>

  <p>Still, his name having been coupled obscurely with their infamous designs,
  although Cicero had positively refused to suffer his accusation or
  impeachment, it required so much boldness, so much audacity indeed, to enable
  him to stand forward as their open champion, that many men disbelieved that
  he would venture on a step so hazardous.</p>

  <p>The greatest possible anxiety was manifested, therefore, in the house,
  when that distinguished Senator arose, and began in low, deep, harmonious
  tones, and words which rolled forth like a gentle river in an easy and
  silvery flow.</p>

  <p>"It were well," he said, "Conscript Fathers, that all men who debate on
  dubious matters, should be unbiassed in opinion by hate or friendship,
  clemency or anger. When passions intervene, the mind can rarely perceive
  truth; nor hath at one time any man obeyed his interests and his pleasures.
  The intellect there prevails, where most it is exerted. If passion governs
  it, passion hath the sole sway; reason is powerless. It were an easy task for
  me, Conscript Fathers, to quote instances in which kings and nations,
  impelled by enmity or pity, have taken unadvised and evil counsels; but I
  prefer to cite those, wherein our ancestors, defying the influence of
  passion, have acted well and wisely. During the Macedonian war which we waged
  against King Perseus, the state of Rhodes, splendid then and stately, which
  had been built up by the aid and opulence of Rome, proved faithless to us,
  and a foe. Yet, when, the war being ended, debate was had concerning her, our
  fathers suffered her citizens to go unpunished, in order that no men might
  infer that Rome had gone to war for greed, and not for just resentment.
  Again, in all the Punic wars, although the Carthaginians repeatedly committed
  outrages against them, in violation both of truce and treaties, never once
  did they follow that example, considering rather what should seem worthy of
  themselves, than what might be inflicted justly on their foes.</p>

  <p>"This same consideration you should now take, Conscript Fathers; having
  care that the crimes of Publius Lentulus and his fellows weigh not upon your
  minds with greater potency, than your own dignity and honor; and that ye obey
  not rather the dictates of resentment, than the teachings of your old renown.
  For if a punishment worthy their crimes can be discovered, I approve of it,
  of how new precedent soever; but if the enormity of their guilt overtop the
  invention of all men, then, I shall vote that we abide by the customs,
  prescribed by our laws and institutions.</p>

  <p>"Many of those who have already spoken, have dilated in glowing and set
  phrases on the perils which have menaced the republic. They have descanted on
  the horrors of warfare, on the woes which befall the vanquished. The rape of
  virgins; the tearing of children from parental arms; the ransacking of human
  homes and divine temples; the subjecting of matrons to the brutal will of the
  conquerors; havoc and conflagration, and all places filled with arms and
  corpses, with massacre and misery&mdash;But, in the name of the immortal
  Gods! to what do such orations tend? Do they aim at inflaming your wrath
  against this conspiracy? Vain, vain were such intent; for is it probable that
  words will inflame the mind of any one, if such and so atrocious facts have
  failed to inflame it? That is indeed impossible! Nor hath any man, at any
  period, esteemed his own injuries too lightly. Most persons, on the contrary,
  hold them more heavy than they are. But consequences fall not equally on all
  men, Conscript Fathers. They who in lowly places pass their lives in
  obscurity, escape the censure of the world, if they err on occasion under the
  influences of passion. Their fortunes and their fame are equal. They who,
  endowed with high commands, live in exalted stations, perform every action of
  their lives in the full gaze of all men. Thus to the greatest fortunes, the
  smallest licence is conceded. The great man must in no case consult his
  affections, or his anger. Least of all, must he yield to passion. That which
  is styled wrath in the lowly-born, becomes tyranny and cruel pride in the
  high and noble.</p>

  <p>"I indeed think, with those who have preceded me, that every torture is
  too small for their atrocity and crime. But it is human nature's trick to
  remember always that which occurs the last in order. Forgetful of the
  criminal's guilt, the world dwells ever on the horror of his punishment, if
  it lean never so little to the side of severity. Well sure am I, that the
  speech of Decius Silanus, a brave and energetic man, was dictated by his love
  for the republic&mdash;that in a cause so weighty he is moved neither by
  favor nor resentment. Yet his vote to my eyes appears, I say not cruel
  &mdash;for what could be cruel, inflicted on such men?&mdash;but foreign to
  the sense of our institutions. Now it is clear, Silanus, that either fear of
  future peril, or indignation at past wrong, impelled you to vote for an
  unprecedented penalty! Of fear it is needless to speak farther; when through
  the active energy of that most eminent man, our consul, such forces are
  assembled under arms! concerning the punishment of these men we must speak,
  however, as the circumstances of the case require. We must admit that in
  agony and wo death is no penalty, but rather the repose from sorrow. Death
  alone is the refuge from every mortal suffering&mdash;in death alone there is
  no place for joy or grief. But if this be not so, wherefore, in the name of
  the Gods! have ye not added also to your sentence, that they be scourged
  before their execution? Is it, that the Porcian law forbids? That cannot
  be&mdash;since other laws as strenuously prohibit the infliction of capital
  punishment on condemned citizens, enjoining that they be suffered to go into
  exile. Is it, then, that to be scourged is more severe and cruel than to be
  slain? Not so&mdash;for what can be too severe or too cruel for men convicted
  of such crime. If on the other hand it be less severe, how is it fitting to
  obey that law in the lesser, which you set at naught in the greater article?
  But, you will ask me perchance, who will find fault with any punishment
  inflicted upon the parricides of the republic? Time&mdash;future
  days&mdash;fortune, whose caprice governs nations! True, these men merit all
  that can befall them; but do ye, Conscript Fathers, pause on the precedent
  which you establish against others? Never did bad example arise but from a
  good precedent&mdash;only when the reins of empire have fallen from wise
  hands into ignorant or wicked guidance, that good example is perverted from
  grand and worthy to base and unworthy ends. The men of Lacedemon, when they
  had conquered Athens, set thirty tyrants at the helm who should control the
  commonwealth. They at the first began to take off the guiltiest individuals,
  wretches hated by all, without form of trial. Thereat the people were
  rejoiced, and cried out that their deaths were just and merited. Ere long,
  when license had gained ground, they slew alike the virtuous and the guilty,
  and governed all by terror. Thus did that state, oppressed by slavery, rue
  bitterly its insane mirth. Within our memory, when victorious Sylla commanded
  Damasippus and his crew, who had grown up a blight to the republic, to be put
  to the sword's edge, who did not praise the deed? Who did not exclaim
  earnestly that men, factious and infamous, who had torn the republic by their
  tumults, were slain justly? And yet that deed was the commencement of great
  havoc. For, when one envied the city mansion or the country farm, nay, but
  the plate or garment of another, he strove with all his energy to have him on
  the lists of the proscription. Therefore, they who exulted at the death of
  Damasippus were themselves, ere long, dragged to execution; nor was there an
  end put to the massacre, until Sylla had satiated all his men with plunder.
  These things, indeed, I fear not under Marcus Tullius, nor at this day; but
  in a mighty state there are many and diverse dispositions. It may be at
  another time, under another consul, who shall perhaps hold an army at his
  back, that the wrong shall be taken for the right. If it be so when&mdash;on
  this precedent, by this decree, of this Senate&mdash;that consul shall have
  drawn the sword, who will compel him to put it back into the scabbard, who
  moderate his execution? Our ancestors, O Conscript Fathers, never lacked
  either wisdom in design, or energy in action; nor did their pride restrain
  them from copying those institutions of their neighbors, which they deemed
  good and wise. Their arms offensive and defensive they imitated from the
  Samnites&mdash;most of the ensigns of their magistracies they borrowed of the
  Tuscans. In a word, whatsoever they observed good and fitting, among their
  allies or their foes, they followed up with the greatest zeal at home. They
  chose to imitate, rather than envy, what was good. But in those days, after
  the fashion of the Greeks, they punished citizens with stripes; they took the
  lives of condemned criminals. As the republic grew in size, and party strife
  arose among its multitudinous citizens, innocent persons were taken off under
  the pretext of the law, and many wrongful deeds were committed with impunity.
  Then was the Porcian Law enacted, with others of like tenor, permitting
  convicts to depart into exile. This I esteem, O Conscript Fathers, the first
  great cause wherefore this novel penalty be not established as a precedent.
  The wisdom and the valor of our ancestors who from a small beginning created
  this vast empire, were greater far than we, who scarcely can retain what they
  won so nobly. Would I have, therefore, you will ask, these men suffered to go
  at large, and so to augment the hosts of Catiline? Far from it. But I shall
  vote thus, that their property be confiscated, and they themselves detained
  in perpetual fetters, in those municipalities of Italy which are the
  wealthiest and the strongest. That the Senate never again consider their
  case, or bring their cause before the people&mdash;and that whosoever shall
  speak for them, be pronounced, of the Senate, an enemy to his country, and to
  the common good of all men."</p>

  <p>This specious and artful oration, in which, while affecting to condemn
  what he dared not defend openly, he had more than insinuated a doubt of the
  legality of sentencing the traitors, was listened to by all present, with
  deep attention; and by the secret partizans of the conspiracy with joy and
  exultation. So sure did they esteem it that, in the teeth of this insidious
  argument, the Senate would not venture to inflict capital punishment on their
  friends, that they evinced their approbation by loud cheers; while many of
  the patrician party were shaken in their previous convictions; and many of
  those who perceived the fallacy of his sophistical reasoning, and detected
  his latent determination to screen the parricides of the state, felt the
  hazard and difficulty of proceeding as the exigencies of the case
  required.</p>

  <p>Cicero's brow grew dark; as Silanus avowed openly that he had altered his
  opinion, and should vote for the motion of Tiberius Nero, to defer
  judgment.</p>

  <p>Then Cicero himself arose, and in the noblest perhaps of all his orations,
  exerted himself strenuously to controvert the arguments and abolish the evil
  influence of the noble demagogue.</p>

  <p>He did not, indeed, openly urge the death of the traitors; but he dwelt
  with tremendous force on the atrocious nature of the crimes, and on the
  consequence of their success. He showed the fallacy of Caesar's insinuation,
  that death was a less severe enactment than perpetual imprisonment. He
  pointed out the impossibility and injustice of compelling the municipalities
  to take charge of the prisoners&mdash;the insecurity of those towns, as
  places of detention&mdash;the almost entire certainty, that the men would ere
  long be released, either by some popular tumult, or some party measure; and
  he concluded with a forcible and earnest peroration, appealing to the
  Senators, by their love of life, of their families, of their country, to take
  counsel worthily of themselves, and of their common mother; entreating them
  to decree firmly, and promising that he would execute their sentence, be it
  what it might, fearlessly.</p>

  <p>As he sat down, the order was agitated like a sea in the tumultuous calm,
  which succeeds to the wrath and riot created by a succession of gales blowing
  from different quarters. Murmurs of approbation and encouragement were mixed
  with groans and loud evidences of displeasure.</p>

  <p>The passions of the great concourse were aroused thoroughly, and the
  debate waxed wild and stormy.</p>

  <p>Senator arose after Senator, advocating some the death, some the
  banishment, and some, emboldened by Caesar's remarks, even proposing the
  enlargement of the conspirators.</p>

  <p>At length, when all arguments appeared to be exhausted, and no hope left
  of anything like an unanimous decision being adopted, Marcus Portius Cato
  arose from his seat, stern, grave, composed, and awful from the severe
  integrity of his grand character.</p>

  <p>The turbulent assembly was calm in a moment. All eyes were fixed on the
  harsh features of the stoic; all ears hung rivetted in expectation, on his
  deep guttural intonations, and short vigorous sentences. It was evident,
  almost ere he began to speak, that his opinion would sway the votes of the
  order.</p>

  <p>"My mind is greatly different," he said, "Conscript Fathers, when I
  consider the perils of our case, and recall to my memory the speeches of some
  whom I have heard to-day. Those Senators, it seems to me, have descanted on
  the punishment of the men who have levied war against their country and their
  parents, against their healths and their altars. But the facts of the case
  require not punishment of their crimes, but defence from their
  assaults.&mdash;Other crimes you may punish after their
  commission&mdash;unless you prevent this from being done, when it is done,
  vainly shall ye ask for judgment. The city stormed, nothing remains to the
  vanquished. Now, in the name of the immortal Gods! I call upon you,
  <i>you</i>, who have always set more store on your mansions, your farms, your
  statues and your pictures, than on the interests of the state, if you desire
  to retain these things, be they what they may, to which you cling so
  lovingly, if you desire to give yourselves leisure for your luxuries, arouse
  yourselves, now or never, and take up the commonwealth! It is no question now
  of taxes! No question of plundering our allies! The lives, the liberties of
  every one of us, are hanging on your doubtful decision. Oftentimes, Conscript
  Fathers, have I spoken at length in this assembly. Oftentimes have I
  inveighed against the luxury and avarice of our citizens, and, therefore,
  have I many men my enemies. I, who have never pardoned my own soul even for
  any trivial error, could not readily excuse in others the lusts which result
  in open criminality. But, although you neglected those crimes as matters of
  small moment, still the republic, by its stability and opulence, sustained
  the weight cast on it by your negligence. Now, however, we ask not whether we
  shall live, corrupt or virtuous; we ask not how we shall render Rome most
  great, and most magnificent; we ask this&mdash;whether we ourselves, and with
  ourselves all that we possess whatsoever, shall be yielded up to the enemy?
  Who here will speak to me of clemency and pity? Long, long ago have we cast
  away the true names of things; for now to be lavish of the goods of others is
  termed liberality; audacity in guilt is denominated valor. Into such
  extremity has the republic fallen. Let Senators, therefore, since such are
  their habitudes and morals, be liberal of the fortunes of our allies, be
  merciful to the pilferers of the treasury; but let them not be lavish in
  bestowing our blood upon them! Let them not, in pity for a few scoundrels,
  send all good citizens to perdition. Caius Caesar spoke a while since,
  eloquently and in set terms, in this house, concerning life and death;
  esteeming those things false, I presume, which are believed by most men of a
  future state that the wicked, I mean, journey on a different road from the
  righteous, and inhabit places aloof from them, dark, horrid, waste, and
  fearful.</p>

  <p>"He hath declared his intent, therefore, to vote for the confiscation of
  their property; and the detention of themselves in the borough towns in close
  custody. Fearing, forsooth, that if they be kept in Rome, they may be rescued
  forcibly, either by the confederates in their plot, or by a hireling rabble.
  Just as if there were only rogues and villains in this city, and none
  throughout all Italy.&mdash;Just as if audacity cannot effect the greatest
  things there, where the means of defence are the smallest. Wherefore his plan
  is absurd, if he fear peril from these men. And if he alone, in the midst of
  consternation so general, do not fear, the more need is there that you and I
  do fear them. Wherefore, when you vote on the fate of Publius Lentulus and
  the rest, hold this assured, that you are voting also on the fate of
  Catiline's army, on the fate of the whole conspiracy. With the more energy
  you act, the more will their courage fail them. If they shall see you falter
  but a little, all at once they will fall on fiercely. Be far from believing
  that our ancestors raised this republic from a small state to a great empire,
  by dint of arms alone. Had it been so, much greater should we have rendered
  it, who have much greater force than they, of citizens and of allies, of arms
  and of horses. But there were other things which made them great, which we
  lack altogether. At home, industry, abroad justice! A mind free to take
  counsel, unbiassed by crime or passion. Instead of these things we possess
  luxury and avarice. Public need, private opulence. We praise wealth, and
  practice indolence. Between righteous and guilty we make no distinction.
  Ambition gains all the rewards of virtue. Nor is this strange, when
  separately every one of you takes counsel for himself alone. When at home,
  you are slaves to pleasure; here in the Senate house, to bribery or favor.
  Thence it arises that a general charge is made from all quarters against the
  helpless commonwealth.</p>

  <p>"But this I will pass over.</p>

  <p>"The noblest of our citizens have conspired to put the torch to the
  republic. They have called to their aid, in open war, the Gallic nation most
  hostile to the name of Roman. The chief of your enemy is thundering above
  your very heads; and are you hesitating even now what you shall do with
  enemies taken within your very walls?&mdash;Oh! you had better pity them, I
  think&mdash;the poor young men have only erred a little, misled by
  ambition&mdash;you had better send them away in arms! I swear that, should
  they once take those arms, that clemency and mercifulness of yours will be
  changed into wo and wailing. Forsooth, it is a desperate crisis; and yet you
  fear it not. Yea, by the Gods! but you do fear it vehemently. Yet, in your
  indolence and feebleness of mind, waiting the one upon the other, you
  hesitate, relying, I presume, on the protection of the Immortals, who have so
  many times preserved this republic in its greatest dangers. The aid of the
  Gods is not gained by prayers or womanish supplication. To those who watch,
  who act, who take counsel, wisely, all things turn out successful. Yield
  yourselves up to idleness and sloth, and in vain you shall implore the
  Gods&mdash;they are irate and hostile.</p>

  <p>"In the time of our forefathers, Titus Manlius Torquatus during the Gallic
  war commanded his own son to be slain, because he had fought against orders;
  and that illustrious youth suffered the penalty of his immoderate
  valor.&mdash;Do ye know this, and delay what ye shall decide against the
  cruellest parricides? Is it forsooth that the lives of these men are in their
  character repugnant to this guilt.&mdash;Oh! spare the dignity of Lentulus,
  if he have ever spared his own modesty, his own good report; if he have ever
  spared any man or any God! Oh! pardon the youth of Cethegus, if this be not
  the second time that he has waged war on his country. For wherefore should I
  speak of Gabinius, Statilius or Caeparius?&mdash;who if they ever felt any
  care for the republic, would never have taken these councils. To conclude,
  Conscript Fathers, if there were any space for a mistake, I would leave you
  right willingly, by Hercules, to be corrected by facts, since you will not be
  warned by words! But we are hemmed in on all sides. Catiline with his army is
  at our very throats&mdash;others of our foes are within our walls in the
  bosom of the state. Nothing can be prepared, nor any counsel taken, so
  privately but they must know it.&mdash;Wherefore I shall vote thus, seeing
  that the republic is plunged into most fearful peril by the guilty plot of
  atrocious citizens, seeing that these men are convicted on the evidence of
  Titus Volturcius, and of the ambassadors of the Allobroges, and seeing that
  they have confessed the intent of murder, conflagration, and other foul and
  barbarous crimes, against their fellow citizens and native country&mdash;I
  shall vote, I say, that execution, according to the custom of our ancestors,
  be done upon them having thus confessed, as upon men manifestly convicted of
  capital treason."</p>

  <p>The stern voice ceased. The bitter irony, which had stung so many souls to
  the quick, the cutting sarcasm, which had demolished Caesar's sophistry, the
  clear reasoning, which had so manifestly found the heart of the mystery, were
  silent. And, folding his narrow toga closely about him, the severe patriot
  resumed his seat, he alone unexcited and impassive.</p>

  <p>But his words had done their work. The guilty were smitten into silence;
  even the daring eloquence and high heart of the ambitious Caesar, were
  subdued and mute.&mdash;The friends of their country were encouraged to shake
  off their apathy.</p>

  <p>With one voice, unanimous, the consulars of Rome cried out for the
  question, applauding loudly the energy and fearlessness of Cato, and accusing
  one another of timidity and weakness.</p>

  <p>A great majority of the Senate, likewise, exclaimed aloud that they
  required no more words, but were prepared to vote.</p>

  <p>And convinced that the time had arrived for striking, Cicero put it to the
  vote, according to the regular form, requiring those who thought with Marcus
  Porcius Cato, to pass over to the right of the curule chair.</p>

  <p>The question was not in doubt a moment; for above three-fourths of the
  whole body arose, as a single man, and passed over to the right of the chair,
  and gathered about the seat of Cato; while very few joined themselves openly
  to Julius Caesar, who sat, somewhat crest-fallen and scarcely able to conceal
  his disappointment, immediately on the left of the consul.</p>

  <p>Rallying, however, before the vote of the Senate had been taken, the
  factious noble sprang to his feet and loudly called upon the tribunes in
  general, and upon Lucius Bestia, in particular, a private friend of Catiline,
  and understood by all to be one of the conspirators, to interpose their
  VETO.</p>

  <p>That was too much, however, even for tribunician daring. No answer was
  made from the benches of the popular magistrates, for once awed into
  patriotic silence.</p>

  <p>But a low sneering laugh ran through the crowded ranks of the Patricians,
  and the vote was taken, now nearly unanimous; for many men disgusted by that
  last step, who had believed the measure to be unconstitutional, passed across
  openly from Caesar's side to that of Cato.</p>

  <p>A decree of the Senate was framed forthwith, and committed to writing by
  the persons appointed, in presence of Marcus Porcius Cato and Decius Julius
  Silanus, as authorities or witnesses of the act, empowering the consul to see
  execution done upon the guilty, where and when it should to him seem
  fitting.</p>

  <p>Thus was it that Cicero and Cato for a while saved the commonwealth, and
  checked the future Dictator in his first efforts to subvert the liberties of
  Rome, happy for him and for his country if it had been his last.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch214"
     name="ch214"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE TULLIANUM</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>To be, or not be, that is the question.</i>
     &mdash;Hamlet.</p><br>

  <p class="first">NIGHT was at hand.</p>

  <p>The Roman Senate might not sit after the sun had set.</p>

  <p>Although the Tribunes had failed, in the consternation of the moment, to
  respond to the call of Caesar, there was no doubt, that, if one night should
  intervene, those miscalled magistrates would check the course of justice.</p>

  <p>Confined, apart one from the other, in free custody, the traitors had not
  failed to learn all that was passing, almost ere it passed.</p>

  <p>Their hopes had been high, when the rabble were alert and thundering at
  the prison gates&mdash;nor when the charge of the knights had beaten back the
  multitude, did they despair; for simultaneously with those evil tidings, they
  learned the effect of Caesar's speech; and shortly afterward the news reached
  them that Cicero's reply had found few willing auditors.</p>

  <p>Confined, apart one from the other, they had eaten and drunken, and their
  hearts were "jocund and sublime"; the eloquence of Caesar, the turbulence of
  the tribunes, were their predominant ideas. Confined, apart one from the
  other, one thought was common to them all,&mdash;immediate liberation, speedy
  vengeance.</p>

  <p>And, in truth, immediate was the liberation; speedy the vengeance.</p>

  <p>Night was at hand.</p>

  <p>The Triumvirs, whose duty it was to superintend all capital
  punishments&mdash;a thing almost unknown in Rome&mdash;had been instructed to
  prepare whatever should be needful.</p>

  <p>Lentulus sat alone in an inner chamber of the house of Publius Lentulus
  Spintherus, an AEdile at that time. There was, it is true, a guard at the
  door, and clients under arms in the atrium; but in his own apartment the
  proud conspirator was still master of himself indeed, soon to be master of
  Rome, in his own frantic fantasy.</p>

  <p>Bright lights were burning in bronze candelabra; rich wines were before
  him; his own favorite freedman leaned on the back of his ivory arm chair, and
  jested lightly on the discomfiture of <i>noble</i> Cicero, on the sure
  triumph of <i>democratic</i> Caesar.</p>

  <p>"Fill up the glass again, my Phormio," cried the exhilarated parricide;
  "this namesake of my own hath good wine, at the least&mdash;we may not taste
  it again shortly&mdash;fill up, I say; and do not spare to brim your own.
  What if our boys were beaten in the streets to-day. Brave Caesar was not
  beaten in the Senate."</p>

  <p>"By Hercules! no!" cried the wily Greek, base inheritor of a superb
  name&mdash;"and if he had been checked, there are the tribunes."</p>

  <p>"But he was <i>not</i> checked, Phormio?" asked the conspirator in evident
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>"By your head, no! You shall yet be the THIRD CORNELIUS!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"WHO SHALL RULE ROME!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>The door of the small room was suddenly thrown open, and the tall form of
  Cicero stood in the shadow of the entrance. The gleam of the lamps fell full
  on his white robes, and glittered on his ivory sceptre; but behind him it
  showed the grim dark features of the Capital Triumvirs, and flickered on the
  axe-heads of the lictors.</p>

  <p>The glass fell from the hand of Lentulus, the wine untasted; and so deep
  was the silence of that awful moment, that the gurgling of the liquor as it
  trickled from the shattered fragments of the crystal goblet, was distinctly
  audible.</p>

  <p>There was a silent pause&mdash;no word, no motion followed the entrance of
  the Consul. Face to face, he stood with the deadliest of his foes, Catiline
  absent. Face to face, he stood with his overthrown and subdued enemy. And yet
  on his broad tranquil brow there was no frown of hatred; on his calm lip
  there there was no curl of gratified resentment, of high triumph.</p>

  <p>Raising his hand, with a slow but very solemn gesture, he uttered in his
  deep harmonious accents, accents which at that moment spoke in almost an
  unnatural cadence, this one word&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Come."</p>

  <p>And calm, and proud, as the Consul, the degraded Senator, the fallen
  Consul replied, with a question,</p>

  <p>"To death, Consul?"</p>

  <p>"Come!"</p>

  <p>"Give me my toga, Phormio."</p>

  <p>And robing himself, with an air as quiet and an expression as unconcerned
  as if he had been setting forth to a banquet, the proud Epicurean gazed with
  a calmer eye upon the Consul, than that good man could fix upon his
  victim.</p>

  <p>"This signet to Sempronia&mdash;that sword to&mdash;no! no!&mdash;this
  purse to thyself, Phormio! Consul, precede. I follow."</p>

  <p>And the step of the convicted Traitor, as he descended from the portico of
  that mansion, for the last time, was firmer, statelier, prouder, than that of
  his conductor.</p>

  <p>The streets were thronged&mdash;the windows crowded&mdash;the housetops
  heaped&mdash;with glaring mute spectators.</p>

  <p>Some twenty knights, no more, unarmed, with the exception of their swords,
  composed the Consul's escort. Lentulus knew them, man by man, had drunk with
  them, played with them, lent money to them, borrowed of them.</p>

  <p>He looked upon them.</p>

  <p>They were the handful leading him to death! What made them break the ties
  which bound them to their brother noble? What made them forget mutual
  pleasures enjoyed, mutual perils incurred, mutual benefits accepted?</p>

  <p>They were the nobles, true to their order.</p>

  <p>He looked upon the thronged streets&mdash;upon the crowded
  windows&mdash;upon the heaped housetops, he saw myriads, myriads who had fed
  on his bounty, encouraged his infamy, hoped from his atrocity, urged him to
  his crime, myriads who now frowned upon him&mdash;cursed him&mdash;howled at
  him&mdash;or&mdash;more cowardly&mdash;were silent. Myriads, who might have
  saved him, and did not.</p>

  <p>Wherefore?</p>

  <p>They were the people, false to their leader.</p>

  <p>He looked from the handful to the myriad&mdash;and shook himself, as a
  lion in his wrath; and stamped the dust from his sandals.</p>

  <p>Cicero saw the movement, and read its meaning. He met the glance, not
  humiliated, but prouder for the mob's reprobation; and said, what he would
  not have said had the glance been conscious&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Thou seest!&mdash;Hearest!"</p>

  <p>"The voice of the People!" answered the traitor with a bitter sneer.</p>

  <p>"The voice of God!" replied the Consul, looking upward.</p>

  <p>"That voice of God shall shout for joy at thy head on the rostrum! Such is
  the fate of all who would serve the people!"</p>

  <p>The eloquent tongue, stabbed with the harlot's bodkin, the head and the
  hand, nailed on the beaked column in after days, showed which best knew the
  people, their savior, or their parricide.</p>

  <p>There is a place in Rome&mdash;there <i>is</i> a place&mdash;reader, thou
  mayest have seen it&mdash;on the right hand as thou goest up the steps of the
  Asylum ascending from the forum to the capitol.</p>

  <p>"There <i>is</i> a place," wrote Sallust, some nineteen hundred years
  ago&mdash;"There <i>is</i> a place, within the prison, which is called
  Tullianum, after you have ascended a little way to the left, about twelve
  feet underground. It is built strongly with walls on every side, and arched
  above with a stone vaulting. But its aspect is foul and terrible from
  neglect, darkness, and stench."</p>

  <p>It is there <i>now</i>&mdash;thou mayest have seen it, reader. Men call it
  the Mamertine Prison. It was then called Tullianum, because it was so antique
  at that time, that vague tradition only told of its origin long centuries
  before, built by the fabulous King Tullius.</p>

  <p>The Tullianum&mdash;The Mamertine Prison.</p>

  <p>The <i>bath</i>, which Jugurtha found very cold, when the earrings had
  been torn from his bleeding ears, and, stript of his last vestment, he was
  let down to die by the hangman's noose.</p>

  <p>The prison, in which, scarce one century later, Saint Paul was held in
  durance, what time "Agrippa said unto Festus, This man might have been set at
  liberty, had he not appealed unto <i>Caesar</i>."</p>

  <p>Unto <i>Caesar</i>?</p>

  <p>Caesar the third Emperor, the third tyrant of the Roman people.</p>

  <p>Lentulus <i>had</i> appealed unto Caesar, and was cast likewise into the
  Tullianum.</p>

  <p>The voice of the people, is the voice of God.</p>

  <p>Whether of the twain slew Lentulus? whether of the twain set free Paul,
  from the Tullianum?</p>

  <p>In those days, there was a tall and massive structure above that sordid
  and tremendous vault, on the right hand as you go up towards the capitol.</p>

  <p>The steps of the asylum were lined on either side by legionaries in full
  armor; and as the Consul walked up with his victim, side by side, each
  soldier faced about, and, by a simple movement, doubling their files,
  occupied the whole space of the steep ascent with a solid column; while all
  the heights above, and the great capitol itself, bristled with spears, and
  flashed with tawny light from the dense ranks of brazen corslets.</p>

  <p>The Capital Triumvirs received the Consul at the door; and with his
  prisoner he passed inward.</p>

  <p>It was in perfect keeping with the Roman character, that a man, hopeless
  of success, should die without an effort; and to the fullest, Lentulus acted
  out that character.</p>

  <p>Impassive and unmoved, he went to his death. He disgraced his evil life by
  no cowardice in death; by no fruitless call upon the people for assistance,
  by no vain cry to the nobles for mercy.</p>

  <p>But it was the impassibility of the Epicurean, not of the Stoic, that
  sustained him.</p>

  <p>He went to die, like his brother democrats of France, with the madness of
  Atheism in his heart, the mirth of Perdition on his tongue.</p>

  <p>They two, the Convict and the Consul, ascended a little, two or three
  steps, to the left, and entered a large apartment, paved, walled, and roofed
  with stone; but in the centre of the floor there was a small round
  aperture.</p>

  <p>There were a dozen persons in that guard-room, four of whom were his
  fellow-traitors&mdash;Gabinius, Statilius, Caeparius, and Cethegus&mdash;two
  praetors, four legionaries, and two Moorish slaves composed the group, until
  with the Triumvirs, and his twelve lictors, Cicero entered.</p>

  <p>"Ha! my Caeparius!" exclaimed Lentulus, who had not seen him since the
  morning of his arrest. "We have met again. But I slept my sleep out. Thou
  might'st as well have slept too; for we are both met here"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"To die! to die! Great Gods! to die!" cried Caeparius utterly overcome,
  and almost fainting with despair.</p>

  <p>"Great Gods indeed!" replied Lentulus with his accustomed half-sardonic,
  half-indolent sneer. "They must be great, indeed, to let such a puppet as
  that," and he pointed to Cicero, as he spoke, "do as he will with us. To die!
  to die! Tush&mdash;what is that but to sleep? to sleep without the trouble of
  awaking, or the annoyance of to-morrow? What sayest thou, my Cethegus?"</p>

  <p>"That thou art a sluggard, a fool, and a coward; curses! curses! curses
  upon thee!" And he made an effort to rush against his comrade, as if to
  strike him; and, when the guards seized him and dragged him back, he shook
  his fist at Cicero, and gnashed his teeth, and howling out, "Thou too! thou
  too shalt die proscribed, and thy country's foe!" by a sudden effort cast off
  the men who held him, and crying, "Slaves and dastards, see how a Roman noble
  dies," rushed, with his head down, at the solid wall, as a buffalo rushes
  blindly against an elephant.</p>

  <p>He fell as if he were dead, the blood gushing from eyes, nose, and mouth,
  and lay senseless.</p>

  <p>Lentulus thought he was killed, gazed on him for a moment tranquilly, and
  then said with a quiet laugh&mdash;</p>

  <p>"He was a fool always&mdash;a rash fool!" Then turning to Cicero, he
  added&mdash;"By Hercules! this is slow work. I am exceeding hungry, and
  somewhat dry; and, as I fancy I shall eat nothing more to-day, nor drink, I
  would fain go to sleep."</p>

  <p>"Would'st thou drink, Lentulus?" asked one of the Triumvirs.</p>

  <p>"Would I not, had I wine?"</p>

  <p>"Bring wine," said the magistrate to one of the Moorish slaves; who went
  out and returned in an instant with a large brazen platter supporting several
  goblets.</p>

  <p>Lentulus seized one quickly, and swallowed it at a mouthful&mdash;there is
  a hot thirst in that last excitement&mdash;but as the flavor reached his
  palate, when the roughness of the harsh draught had passed away, he flung the
  cup down scornfully and said,</p>

  <p>"Finish it! Take this filthy taste from my lips! Let me rest!"</p>

  <p>And with the words, he advanced to the Moors who stood beside the
  well-like aperture, and without a word suffered them to place the rope under
  his arms, and lower him into the pit.</p>

  <p>Just as his head, however, was disappearing, he cast his eyes upward, and
  met the earnest gaze of the Consul.</p>

  <p>"The voice of the people! the man of the people!" he cried sarcastically.
  "Fool! fool! <i>they</i> shall avenge me! Think upon me near Formiae!"</p>

  <p>Was that spite, or a prophecy?</p>

  <p>The eyes of the dying sometimes look far into futurity.</p>

  <p>The haughty traitor was beyond the sight, before his words had ceased to
  ring in the ears of the spectators.</p>

  <p>There was a small low sound heard from below&mdash;not a groan, not a
  struggle&mdash;but a rustle, a sob, a flutter&mdash;silence.</p>

  <p>'So did that Patrician, of the most noble house of the Cornelii, who once
  held consular dominion in Rome, meet his end, merited by his course of life,
  and his overt actions.' (32)</p>

  <p class="footnote">32. Sallust.</p>

  <p>Cethegus perished senseless, half dead by his own deed.</p>

  <p>Caeparius died sullen; Gabinius weak and almost fainting; Statilius
  struggling and howling. All by a hard and slavish death, strangled by the
  base noose of a foreign hangman.</p>

  <p>An hour afterward, their corpses were hurled down the Gemonian Stairs,
  among the shouts and acclamations of the drunken slavish rabble.</p>

  <p>An hour afterward, Cicero stood on the rostrum, near the Libonian
  well&mdash;that rostrum whereon, at a later day Lentulus' prophecy was
  fulfilled&mdash;and called out, in a voice as solemn and almost as deep as
  thunder,</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">"they were!"</span></p>

  <p>And the voice of the people yelled out its joy, because they <i>were</i>
  no longer; and hailed their slayer the Savior and Father of his country.</p>

  <p>A few years afterward, how did they not hail Anthony?</p>

  <h2><a id="ch215"
     name="ch215"></a>XV. &mdash; THE CAMP IN THE APPENNINES</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>With that he gave his able horse the
     head.</i> &mdash;Henry IV.</p><br>

  <p>class="first"THERE is a wild gorge in the very summit of the Appennines,
  not quite midway between Florence and Pistoia, the waters of which, shed in
  different directions, flow on the one hand tributaries to the Po, and on the
  other to the Arno, swelling the Adriatic, and the Mediterranean seas.</p>

  <p>The mountains rise abruptly in bare crags, covered here and there by a low
  growth of myrtle and wild olives, on either hand this gorge, quite
  inaccessible to any large array of armed men, though capable of being
  traversed by solitary foresters or shepherds. Below, the hills fall downward
  in a succession of vast broken ridges, in places rocky and almost
  perpendicular, in places swelling into rounded knolls, feathered with dark
  rich forests of holm oak and chesnut.</p>

  <p>In the highest part of this gorge, where it spreads out into a little
  plain, perched like the eyry of some ravenous bird of prey, the camp of
  Catiline was pitched, on the second evening after the execution of his
  comrades.</p>

  <p>Selected with rare judgment, commanding all the lower country, and the
  descent on one hand into the Val d'Arno and thence to Rome, on the other into
  the plain of the Po and thence into Cisalpine Gaul, the whole of which was
  ripe for insurrection, that camp secured to him an advance upon the city,
  should his friends prove successful, or a retreat into regions where he could
  raise new levies in case of their failure.</p>

  <p>A Roman camp was little less than a regular fortification, being formed
  mostly in an oblong square, with a broad ditch and earthen ramparts garnished
  by a stockade, with wooden towers at the gates, one of which pierced each
  side of the intrenchment.</p>

  <p>And to such a degree of perfection and celerity had long experience and
  the most rigid discipline brought the legions, that it required an incredibly
  short time to prepare such a camp for any number of men; a thing which never
  was omitted to be done nightly even during the most arduous marches and in
  the face of an enemy.</p>

  <p>Catiline was too able and too old a soldier to neglect such precaution
  under any circumstances; and assuredly he would not have done so now, when
  the consul Antonius lay with two veteran legions within twenty miles distance
  in the low country east of Florence, while Quintus Metellus Celer, at the
  head of a yet larger force, was in the Picene district on his rear, and not
  so far off but he might have attempted to strike a blow at him.</p>

  <p>His camp, capable of containing two full legions, the number of which he
  had completed, all free-born men and Roman citizens, for he had refused the
  slaves who flocked at first to his standard in great force, was perfectly
  defended, and provided with all the usual tents and divisions; so that every
  cohort, manipule, and century, nay every man, knew his own station.</p>

  <p>The sun had just sunk beneath the horizon and the night watches had been
  set by sound of trumpets, the horsemen had been appointed for the rounds, and
  an outpost of light-armed soldiers pushed forward in front of all the
  gates.</p>

  <p>There was a rosy tinge still lingering in the sky, and a few slant rays
  were shot through the gaps in the mountain ridge, gilding the evergreen
  foliage of the holm-oaks with bright lustre, and warming the cold grey stones
  which cumbered the sides and summits of the giant hills; but all the level
  country at their feet was covered with deep purple shadow.</p>

  <p>Catiline sat alone in his <i>praetorium</i>, as the general's pavilion was
  entitled, situated on a little knoll nearly in the centre of the camp between
  the tents of the tribunes, and the quarters of the extraordinary horse.</p>

  <p>He was completely armed, all but his head, and wore a rich scarlet cloak
  above his panoply, his helmet and buckler lying upon the ground beside him in
  easy reach of his hand. A pen was in his fingers, and a sheet of parchment
  was stretched on the board before him; but he was not writing, although there
  were several lines scrawled on it in a bold coarse hand.</p>

  <p>His face was paler and more livid than usual, and his frame thinner,
  almost indeed emaciated, yet every sinew and muscle was hard as tempered
  steel.</p>

  <p>But now there was a strange expression in his features; it was not doubt
  nor hesitation, much less fear; and consisted perhaps rather in the absence
  of his wonted characteristics, the unquiet and quick changes, the passionate
  restlessness, the fell deadly sneer, and the blighting flash of the dark eye,
  than in any token of peculiar meaning.&mdash;There was a cold and almost
  vacant expression in his gaze; and an impassive calmness in all his
  lineaments, that were in singular contrast with the character of the man; and
  he sat, a thing most unusual for him, perfectly motionless, buried in deep
  thought.</p>

  <p>The night was very cold, and, without, a heavy hoar frost was falling; so
  that a fire of charcoal had keen kindled in a bronze brazier, and as the
  light of the sky died away strange lurid gleams and fantastic shadows rose
  and fell, upon the walls of the large tent, rendered more fickle and
  grotesque by the wavering of the canvass in the gusty night air. There was
  wine with several goblets upon the board, at which he sat, with his eyes
  fixed straight before him; and at his elbow there stood a tall brazen tripod
  supporting a large lamp with several burners; but none of these were lighted,
  and, but for the fitful glare of the charcoal, the tent would have been
  completely dark.</p>

  <p>Still he called not to any slave, nor appeared to observe the growing
  obscurity, but sat gloomily pondering&mdash;on what?</p>

  <p>Once or twice he drew his hand across his eyes, and then glared still more
  fixedly upon the dark and waving shadows, as if he saw something more than
  common in their uncertain outlines.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he spoke, in a hoarse altered voice&mdash;"This is strange," he
  said, "very strange! Now, were I one of these weak fools who believe in
  omens, I should shake. But tush! tush! how should there be omens? for who
  should send them? there must be Gods, to have omens! and that is too absurd
  for credence! Gods! Gods!" he repeated half dubiously&mdash;"Yet, if there
  should&mdash;ha! ha! art thou turned dotard, Catiline! There are <i>no</i>
  Gods, or why sleep their thunders? Aye! there it is again," he added, gazing
  on vacancy. "By my right hand! it is very strange! three times last night,
  the first time when the watch was set, and twice afterward I saw him! And
  three times again tonight, since the trumpet was blown. Lentulus, with his
  lips distorted, his face black and full of blood, his eyes starting from
  their sockets, like a man strangled! and he beckoned me with his pale hand! I
  saw him, yet so shadowy and so transparent, that I might mark the waving of
  the canvass through his figure!&mdash;But tush! tush! it is but a trick of
  the fancy. I am worn out with this daily marching; and the body's fatigue
  hath made the mind weak and weary. And it is dull here too, no dice, no
  women, and no revelling. I will take some wine," he added, starting up and
  quaffing two or three goblets' full in quick succession, "my blood is thin
  and cold, and wants warming. Ha! that is better&mdash;It is right old
  Setinian too; I marvel whence Manlius had it." Then he rose from his seat,
  and began to stride about the room impatiently. After a moment or two he
  dashed his hand fiercely against his brow, and cried in a voice full of
  anguish and perturbation, "Tidings! tidings! I would give half the world for
  tidings! Curses! curses upon it! that I began this game at all, or had not
  brave colleagues! It is time! can it be that their hearts have failed them?
  that they have feared or delayed to strike, or have been overthrown,
  detected?&mdash;Tidings, tidings! By Hades! I must have tidings! What ho!" he
  exclaimed, raising his voice to a higher pitch, "Ho, I say, ho! Chaerea!"</p>

  <p>And from an outer compartment of the tent the Greek freedman entered,
  bearing a lighted lamp in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Chaerea, summon Manlius hither, and leave the lamp, have been long in the
  darkness!"</p>

  <p>"Wert sleeping, Catiline?"</p>

  <p>"Sleeping!" exclaimed the traitor, with a savage cry, hoarse as the roar
  of a wounded lion&mdash;"sleeping, thou idiot! Do men sleep on volcanoes? Do
  men sleep in the crisis of their fortunes? I have not slept these six nights.
  Get thee gone! summon Manlius!" and then, as the freedman left the room, he
  added; "perchance I shall sleep no more until&mdash;I sleep for ever! I would
  I could sleep, and not see those faces; they never troubled me till now. I
  would I knew if <i>that</i> sleep is dreamless. If it were so&mdash;perhaps,
  perhaps! but no! no! By all the Furies! no! until my foot hath trodden on the
  neck of Cicero."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Manlius entered the room, a tall dark sinister-looking
  scar-seamed veteran, equipped in splendid armor, of which the helmet alone
  was visible, so closely was he wrapped against the cold in a huge shaggy
  watch-cloak.</p>

  <p>As his subordinate appeared, every trace of the conflict which had been in
  progress within him vanished, and his brow became as impassive, his eye as
  hard and keen as its wont.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, my Caius," he exclaimed. "Look you, we have present need of
  council. The blow must be stricken before this in Rome, or must have failed
  altogether. If it have been stricken, we should be nearer Rome to profit by
  it&mdash;if it have failed, we must destroy Antonius' army, before Metellus
  join him. I doubt not he is marching hitherward even now. Besides, we must,
  we <i>must</i> have tidings&mdash;we <i>must</i> know all, and all
  truly!"</p>

  <p>Then, seeing that Manlius doubted, "Look you," he continued. "Let us march
  at daybreak to-morrow upon Faesulae, leaving Antonius in the plain on our
  right. Marching along the crest of the hills, he cannot assail our flank. We
  can outstrip him too, and reach Arretium ere the second sunset. He, thinking
  we have surely tidings from our friends in the city, will follow in
  disordered haste; and should we have bad news, doubling upon him on a sudden
  we may overpower him at one blow. It is a sure scheme either
  way&mdash;think'st thou not so, good friend? nay more, it is the only
  one."</p>

  <p>"I think so, Sergius," he replied. "In very deed I think so. Forage too is
  becoming scarce in the camp, and the baggage horses are dying. The men are
  murmuring also for want of the pleasures, the carouses, and the women of the
  cities. They will regain their spirits in an hour, when they shall hear of
  the march upon Rome."</p>

  <p>"I prithee, let them hear it, then, my Caius; and that presently. Give
  orders to the tribunes and centurions to have the tents struck, and the
  baggage loaded in the first hour of the last night-watch. We will advance
  at&mdash;ha!" he exclaimed, interrupting himself suddenly, and listening with
  eager attention. "There is a horse tramp crossing from the gates. By the
  Gods! news from Rome! Tarry with me, until we hear it."</p>

  <p>Within five minutes, Chaerea re-entered the tent, introducing a man
  dressed and armed as a light-horseman, covered with mudstains, travelworn,
  bending with fatigue, and shivering with cold, the hoar-frost hanging white
  upon his eyebrows and beard.</p>

  <p>"From Rome, good fellow?" Catiline inquired quickly. "From Rome,
  Catiline!" replied the other, "bearing a letter from the noble Lentulus."</p>

  <p>"Give&mdash;give it quick!" and with the word he snatched the scroll from
  the man's hand, tore it violently open, and read aloud as follows.</p>

  <p>"Who I may be, you will learn from the bearer. All things go bravely. The
  ambassadors have lost their suit, but we have won ours. They return home
  to-morrow, by the Flaminian way, one Titus of Crotona guiding them, who shall
  explain to you our thoughts and hopes&mdash;but, of this doubt not, thoughts
  shall be deeds, and hopes success, before this hour to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"By all the Gods!" cried Catiline with a shout of joy, "Ere this time all
  is won! Cicero, Cicero, I have triumphed, and thou, mine enemy, art nothing;"
  then turning to the messenger, he asked, "When didst leave Rome, with these
  joyous tidings? when sawest the noble Lentulus?"</p>

  <p>"On the fourth day (33) before the nones, at sunset."</p>

  <p class="footnote">33. The second of December.</p>

  <p>"And we are now in the sixth (34) before the Ides. Thou hast loitered on
  the way, Sirrah."</p>

  <p class="footnote">34. The eighth of December.</p>

  <p>"I was compelled to quit my road, Catiline, and to lie hid four days among
  the hills to avoid a troop of horse which pursued me, seeing that I was
  armed; an advanced guard, I think, of Antonius' army."</p>

  <p>"Thou didst well. Get thee gone, and bid them supply thy wants. Eat,
  drink, and sleep&mdash;we march upon Rome at day-break to-morrow."</p>

  <p>The man left the apartment, and looking to Manlius with a flushed cheek
  and exulting aspect, Catiline exclaimed,</p>

  <p>"Murmuring for pleasure, and for women, are they? Tell them, good friend,
  they shall have all the gold of Rome for their pleasure, and all its
  patrician dames for their women. Stir up their souls, my Manlius, kindle
  their blood with it matters not what fire! See to it, my good comrade, I am
  aweary, and will lay me down, I can sleep after these good tidings."</p>

  <p>But it was not destined that he should sleep so soon.</p>

  <p>He had thrown himself again into a chair, and filled himself a brimming
  goblet of the rich wine, when he repeated to himself in a half musing
  tone&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Murmuring for their women? ha!&mdash;By Venus! I cannot blame the knaves.
  It is dull work enough without the darlings. By Hercules! I would Aurelia
  were here; or that jade Lucia! Pestilent handsome was she, and then so
  furious and so fiery! By the Gods! were she here, I would bestow one caress
  on her at the least, before she died, as die she shall, in torture by my
  hand! Curses on her, she has thwarted, defied, foiled me! By every fiend and
  Fury! ill shall she perish, were she ten times my daughter!"</p>

  <p>Again there was a bustle without the entrance of the pavilion, and again
  Chaerea introduced a messenger.</p>

  <p>It was Niger, one of the swordsmith's men. Catiline recognized him in an
  instant.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Niger, my good lad, from Caius Crispus, ha?"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"From Caius Crispus, praying succor, and that swift, lest it be too
  late."</p>

  <p>"Succor against whom? succor where, and wherefore?"</p>

  <p>"Against a century of Antonius' foot. They came upon us unawares, killed
  forty of our men, and drove the stout smith for shelter into a ruined
  watch-tower, on the hill above the cataract, near to Usella, which happily
  afforded him a shelter. They have besieged us there these two days; but
  cannot storm us until our arrows fail, or they bring up engines. But our food
  is finished, and our wine wakes low, and Julia"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Who? Julia?" shouted Catiline, scarce able to believe his ears, and
  springing from his chair in rapturous agitation&mdash;"By your life! speak!
  what Julia?"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Hortensia's daughter, whom"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Enough! enough! Chaerea"&mdash;he scrawled a few words on a strip of
  parchment&mdash;"this to Terentius the captain of my guard. Three hundred
  select horsemen to be in arms and mounted within half an hour. Let them take
  torches, and a guide for Usella. Saddle the black horse Erebus. Get me some
  food and a watch-cloak. Get thee away. Now tell me all, good fellow."</p>

  <p>The man stated rapidly, but circumstantially, all that he knew of the
  occurrences of Julia's seizure, of the capture of Aulus, and of their
  journey; and then, his eyes gleaming with the fierce blaze of excited passion
  and triumphant hatred, Catiline cross-questioned him concerning the unhappy
  girl. Had she been brought thus far safely and with unblemished honor? Had
  she suffered from hunger or fatigue? Had her beauty been impaired by
  privation?</p>

  <p>And, having received satisfactory replies to all his queries, he gave
  himself up to transports of exultation, such as his own most confidential
  freedman never before had witnessed.</p>

  <p>Dismissing the messenger, he strode to and fro the hut, tossing his arms
  aloft and bursting into paroxysms of fierce laughter.</p>

  <p>"Ha! ha! too much!&mdash;it is too much for one night! Ha! ha! ha! ha!
  Love, hatred, passion, triumph, rage, revenge, ambition, all, all gratified!
  Ha! ha! Soft, gentle Julia&mdash;proud, virtuous one that did despise me,
  thou shalt writhe for it&mdash;from thy soul shalt thou bleed for it! Ha! ha!
  Arvina&mdash;liar! fool! perjurer! but this will wring thee worse than
  Ixion's wheel, or whips of scorpions!&mdash;Ha! ha! Cicero! Cicero!&mdash;No!
  no! Chaerea. There are no Gods! no Gods who guard the innocent! no Gods who
  smile on virtue! no gods! I say, no Gods! no Gods, Chaerea!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>But, as he spoke, there burst close over head an appaling crash of
  thunder, accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid and pervading that the
  whole tent seemed to be on fire. The terrified Greek fell to the earth,
  stunned and dazzled; but the audacious and insane blasphemer, tossing his
  arms and lifting his front proudly, exclaimed with his cynical sneer, "If ye
  be Gods! strike! strike! I defy your vain noise! your harmless thunder!"</p>

  <p>For ten minutes or more, blaze succeeded blaze, and crash followed crash,
  with such tremendous rapidity, that the whole heavens, nay, the whole
  atmosphere, appeared incandescent with white, sulphureous, omnipresent fire;
  and that the roar of the volleyed thunder was continuous and incessant.</p>

  <p>Still the fierce traitor blenched not. Crime and success had maddened him.
  His heart was hardened, his head frenzied, to his own destruction.</p>

  <p>But the winter storm in the mountains was as brief as it was sudden, and
  tremendous; and it ceased as abruptly as it broke out unexpectedly. A tempest
  of hail came pelting down, the grape-shot as it were of that heavenly
  artillery, scourging the earth with furious force during ten minutes more;
  and then the night was as serene and tranquil as it had been before that
  elemental uproar.</p>

  <p>As the last flash of lightning flickered faintly away, and the last
  thunder roll died out in the sky, Catiline stirred the freedman with his
  foot.</p>

  <p>"Get up, thou coward fool. Did I not tell thee that there are no Gods? lo!
  you now! for what should they have roused this trumpery pother, if not to
  strike me? Tush, man, I say, get up!"</p>

  <p>"Is it thou, Sergius Catiline?" asked the Greek, scarce daring to raise
  his head from the ground. "Did not the bolt annihilate thee? art thou not
  indeed dead?"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Judge if I be dead, fool, by this, and this, and this!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>And, with each word, he kicked and trampled on the grovelling wretch with
  such savage violence and fury, that he bellowed and howled for mercy, and was
  scarce able to creep out of the apartment, when he ceased stamping upon him,
  and ordered him to begone speedily and bring his charger.</p>

  <p>Ere many minutes had elapsed, the traitor was on horse-back.</p>

  <p>And issuing from the gates of his camp into the calm and starry night, he
  drove, with his escort at his heels, with the impetuosity and din of a
  whirlwind, waking the mountain echoes by the clang of the thundering hoofs,
  and the clash of the brazen armor and steel scabbards, down the steep defile
  toward Usella.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch216"
     name="ch216"></a>XVI. &mdash; THE WATCHTOWER OF USELLA</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>Our castle's strength will laugh a siege to
     scorn.</i> &mdash;Macbeth.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE watchtower in which Caius Crispus and his gang had taken
  refuge from the legionaries, was one of those small isolated structures, many
  of which had been perched in the olden time on the summits of the jutting
  crags, or in the passes of the Appennines, but most of which had fallen long
  before into utter ruin.</p>

  <p>Some had been destroyed in the border wars of the innumerable petty
  tribes, which, ere the Romans became masters of the peninsula, divided among
  themselves that portion of Italy, and held it in continual turmoil with their
  incessant wars and forays.</p>

  <p>Some had mouldered away, by the slow hand of ruthless time; and yet more
  had been pulled down for the sake of their materials, which now filled a more
  useful if less glorious station, in the enclosures of tilled fields, and the
  walls of rustic dwellings.</p>

  <p>From such a fate the watchtower of Usella had been saved by several
  accidents. Its natural and artificial strength had prevented its sack or
  storm during the earlier period of its existence&mdash;the difficulty of
  approaching it had saved its solid masonry from the cupidity of the rural
  proprietors&mdash;and, yet more, its formidable situation, commanding one of
  the great hill passes into Cisalpine Gaul, had induced the Roman government
  to retain it in use, as a fortified post, so long as their Gallic neighbors
  were half subdued only, and capable of giving them trouble by their
  tumultuous incursions.</p>

  <p>Although it had consisted, therefore, in the first instance, of little
  more than a rude circular tower of that architecture called Cyclopean,
  additions had been made to it by the Romans of a strong brick wall with a
  parapet, enclosing a space of about a hundred feet in diameter, accessible
  only by a single gateway, with a steep and narrow path leading to it, and
  thoroughly commanded by the tower itself.</p>

  <p>In front, this wall was founded on a rough craggy bank of some thirty feet
  in height, rising from the main road traversing the defile, by which alone it
  could be approached; for, on the right and left, the rocks had been scarped
  artificially; and, in the rear, there was a natural gorge through which a
  narrow but impetuous torrent raved, between precipices a hundred feet in
  depth, although an arch of twenty foot span would have crossed the ravine
  with ease.</p>

  <p>Against the wall at this point, on the inner side, the Romans had
  constructed a small barrack with three apartments, each of which had a narrow
  window overlooking the bed of the torrent, no danger being apprehended from
  that quarter.</p>

  <p>Such was the place into which Crispus had retreated, under the guidance of
  one of the Etruscan conspirators, after the attack of the Roman infantry;
  and, having succeeded in reaching it by aid of their horses half an hour
  before their pursuers came up, they had contrived to barricade the gateway
  solidly with some felled pine trees; and had even managed to bring in with
  them a yoke of oxen and a mule laden with wine, which they had seized from
  the peasants in the street of the little village of Usella, as they gallopped
  through it, goading their blown and weary animals to the top of their
  speed.</p>

  <p>It was singularly characteristic of the brutal pertinacity, and perhaps of
  the sagacity also, of Caius Crispus, that nothing could induce him to release
  the miserable Julia, who was but an incumbrance to their flight, and a
  hindrance to their defence.</p>

  <p>To all her entreaties, and promises of safety from his captors, and reward
  from her friends, if he would release her, he had replied only with a sneer;
  saying that he would ensure his own safety at an obolus' fee, and that, for
  his reward, he would trust noble Catiline.</p>

  <p>"For the rest," he added, "imagine not that you shall escape, to rejoice
  the heart of that slave Arvina. No! minion, no! We will fight 'till our flesh
  be hacked from our bones, ere they shall make their way in hither; and if
  they do so, they shall find thee&mdash;dead and dishonored! Pray, therefore,
  if thou be wise, for our success."</p>

  <p>Such might in part indeed have been his reasoning; for he was cruel and
  licentious, as well as reckless and audacious; but it is probable that,
  knowing himself to be in the vicinity of Catiline's army, he calculated on
  finding some method of conveying to him information of the prize that lay
  within his grasp, and so of securing both rescue and reward.</p>

  <p>If he had not, however, in the first instance thought of this, it was not
  long ere it occurred to him; when he at once proceeded to put it into
  execution.</p>

  <p>Within half an hour of the entrance of the little party into this
  semi-ruinous strong-hold, the legionary foot came up, about a hundred and
  fifty men in number, but without scaling ladders, artillery, or engines.</p>

  <p>Elated by their success, however, they immediately formed what was called
  the <i>tortoise</i>, by raising their shields and overlapping the edges of
  them above their heads, in such a manner as to make a complete penthouse,
  which might defend them from the missiles of the besieged; and, under cover
  of this, they rushed forward dauntlessly, to cut down the palisade with their
  hooks and axes.</p>

  <p>In this they would have probably succeeded, for the arrows and ordinary
  missiles of the defenders rebounded and rolled down innocuous from the tough
  brass-bound bull-hides; and the rebels were already well nigh in despair,
  when Caius Crispus, who had been playing his part gallantly at the barricade,
  and had stabbed two or three of the legionaries with his pilum, in hand to
  hand encounter, through the apertures of the grating, rushed up to the
  battlements, covered with blood and dust, and shouting&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ho! by Hercules! this will never do, friends. Give me yon crow-
  bar&mdash;So! take levers, all of you, and axes! We must roll down the coping
  on their heads,"&mdash;applied his own skill and vast personal strength to
  the task. In an instant the levers were fixed, and grasping his crow-bar with
  gigantic energy, he set up his favorite chaunt, as cheerily as he had done of
  old in his smithy on the Sacred Way&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Ply, ply, my boys, now ply the lever!<br>
  Heave at it, heave at it, all! Together!<br>
  Great Mars, the war God, watches ye laboring<br>
  Joyously. Joyous watches"&mdash;</p><br>

  <p>But his words were cut short by a thundering crash; for, animated by his
  untamed spirit, his fellows had heaved with such a will at the long line of
  freestone coping, that, after tottering for a few seconds, and reeling to and
  fro, it all rushed down with the speed and havoc of an avalanche, drowning
  all human sounds with the exception of one piercing yell of anguish, which
  rose clear above the confused roar and clatter.</p>

  <p>"Ho! by the Thunderer! we have smashed them beneath their tortoise, like
  an egg in its shell! Now ply your bows, brave boys! now hurl your javelins!
  Well shot! well shot indeed, my Niger! You hit that high-crested centurion
  full in the mouth, as he called on them to rally, and nailed his tongue to
  his jaws. Give me another pilum, Rufus! This," he continued, as he poised and
  launched it hurtling through the air, "This to the ensign-bearer!" And,
  scarce was the word said, ere the ponderous missile alighted on his extended
  shield, pierced its tough fourfold bull-hide, as if it had been a sheet of
  parchment; drove through his bronze cuirass, and hurled him to the ground,
  slain outright in an instant. "Ha! they have got enough of it! Shout, boys!
  Victoria! Victoria!"</p>

  <p>And the wild cheering of the rebels pealed high above the roar of the
  torrent, striking dismay into the soul of the wretched Julia.</p>

  <p>But, although the rebels had thus far succeeded, and the legionaries had
  fallen back, bearing their dead and wounded with them, the success was by no
  means absolute or final; and this no man knew better than the swordsmith.</p>

  <p>He watched the soldiers eagerly, as they drew off in orderly array into
  the hollow way, and after a short consultation, posting themselves directly
  in front of the gate with sentinels thrown out in all directions, lighted a
  large watch fire in the road, with the intention, evidently, of converting
  the storm into a blockade.</p>

  <p>A few moments afterward, he saw a soldier mount the horse of the slain
  centurion, and gallop down the hill in the direction of Antonius' army, which
  was well known to be lying to the south-eastward. Still a few minutes later a
  small party was sent down into the village, and returned bringing provisions,
  which the men almost immediately began to cook, after having posted a chain
  of videttes from one bank to the other of the precipitous ravine, so as to
  assure themselves that no possibility of escape was left to the besieged in
  any direction, by which they conceived escape to be practicable.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Crispus, as he watched their movements, "they will give us
  no more trouble to-night, but we will make sure of them by posting one
  sentinel above the gate, and another on the head of the watch-tower. Then we
  will light us a good fire in the yard below, and feast there on the beef and
  wine of those brute peasants. The legionaries fancy that they can starve us
  out; but they know not how well we are provided. Hark you, my Niger. Go down
  and butcher those two beeves, and when they are flayed and decapitated, blow
  me a good loud trumpet blast and roll down the heads over the battlements.
  Long ere we have consumed our provender, Catiline will be down on them in
  force! I go to look around the place, and make all certain."</p>

  <p>And, with the words, he ascended to the summit of the old watch-tower and
  stood there for many minutes, surveying the whole conformation of the
  country, and all the defences of the place, with a calm and skilful eye.</p>

  <p>The man was by no means destitute of certain natural talents, and an
  aptitude for war, which, had it been cultivated or improved, might possibly
  have made him a captain. He speedily perceived, therefore, that the defences
  were tenable so long only as no ladders or engines should be brought against
  them; which he was well assured would be done, within twenty-four hours at
  the latest. He knew also that want of provisions must compel him to surrender
  at discretion before many days; and he felt it to be very doubtful whether,
  without some strong effort on their part Catiline would hear at all of their
  situation, until it should be entirely too late.</p>

  <p>He began, therefore, at once, to look about him for means of despatching
  an envoy, nothing doubting that succor would be sent to him instantly, could
  the arch traitor be informed, that the lovely Julia was a prisoner awaiting
  his licentious pleasure.</p>

  <p>Descending from the battlements, he proceeded at once to the barrack rooms
  in the rear, hoping to find some possibility of lowering a messenger into the
  bed of the stream, or transporting him across the ravine, unseen by the
  sentinels of the enemy.</p>

  <p>Then, casting open a door of fast decaying wood-work, he entered the first
  of the low mouldering unfurnished rooms; and, stepping across the paved floor
  with a noiseless foot, thrust his head out of the window and gazed anxiously
  up and down the course of the ravine.</p>

  <p>He became satisfied at once that his idea was feasible; for the old wall
  was built, at this place, in salient angles, following the natural line of
  the cliffs; and the window of the central room was situated in the bottom of
  the recess, between two jutting curtains, in each of which was another
  embrasure. It was evident, therefore, that a person lowered by the middle
  window, into the gorge beneath, would be screened from the view of any
  watchers, by the projection of the walls; and Crispus nothing doubted but
  that, once in the bottom of the ravine, a path might be found more or less
  difficult by which to reach the upper country.</p>

  <p>Beyond the ravine rose many broken knolls covered with a thick undergrowth
  of young chesnut hollies, wild laurels, and the like; and through these, a
  winding road might be discovered, penetrating the passes of the hills, and
  crossing the glen at a half mile's distance below on a single-arched brick
  bridge, by which it joined the causeway occupied by the legionaries.</p>

  <p>Having observed so much, Caius Crispus was on the point of withdrawing his
  head, forgetting all about his prisoner, who, on their entrance into this
  dismantled hold, had been thrust in hither, as into the place where she would
  be most out of harm's way, and least likely to escape.</p>

  <p>But just as he was satisfied with gazing, the lovely face of Julia, pale
  as an image of statuary marble, with all her splendid auburn hair unbound,
  was advanced out of the middle window; evidently looking out like himself for
  means of escape. But to her the prospect was not, as to him, satisfactory;
  and uttering a deep sigh she shook her head sadly, and wrung her hands with
  an expression of utter despair.</p>

  <p>"Ha! ha! my pretty one, it is too deep, I trow!" cried Crispus, whom she
  had not yet observed, with a cruel laugh, "Nothing, I swear, without wings
  can descend that abyss; unless like Sappho, whom the poets tell us of, it
  would put an end to both love and life together. No! no! you cannot escape
  thus, my pretty one; and, on the outside, I will make sure of you. For the
  rest I will send you some watch cloaks for a bed, some supper, and some wine.
  We will not starve you, my fair Julia, and no one shall harm you here, for I
  will sleep across your door, myself, this night, and ere to-morrow's sunset
  we shall be in the camp with Catiline."</p>

  <p>He was as good as his word, for he returned almost immediately, bringing a
  pile of watch-cloaks, which he arranged into a rude semblance of a bed, with
  a pack saddle for the pillow, in the innermost recess of the inner room, with
  some bread, and beef broiled hastily on the embers, and some wine mixed with
  water, which last she drank eagerly; for fear and anxiety had parched her,
  and she was faint with thirst.</p>

  <p>Before he went out, again he looked earnestly from the unlatticed window,
  in order to assure himself that she had no means of escape. Scarce was he
  gone, before she heard the shrill blast of the Roman trumpets blown clearly
  and scientifically, for the watch-setting; and, soon afterward, all the din
  and bustle, which had been rife through the livelong day, sank into silence,
  and she could hear the brawling of the brook below chafing and raving against
  the rocks which barred its bed, and the wind murmuring against the leafless
  treetops.</p>

  <p>Shortly after this, it became quite dark; and after sitting musing awhile
  with a sad and despairing heart, and putting up a wild prayer to the Gods for
  mercy and protection, she went once more and leaned out of the window, gazing
  wistfully on the black stones and foamy water.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she said to herself sadly, repeating Caius Crispus' words,
  "could descend hence, without wings, and live. It is too true! alas! too
  true!&mdash;" she paused for a moment, and then, while a flash of singular
  enthusiastic joy irradiated all her pallid lineaments, she exclaimed, "but
  the Great Gods be praised? one can leap down, and die! Let life go! what is
  life? since I can thus preserve my honor!" She paused again and considered;
  then clasped her hands together, and seemed to be on the point of casting
  herself into that awful gulf; but she resisted the temptation, and said, "Not
  yet! not yet! There is hope yet, on earth! and I will live awhile, for hope
  and for Paullus. I can do this at any time&mdash;of this refuge, at least,
  they cannot rob me. I will live yet awhile!" And with the words she turned
  away quietly, went to the pile of watch-cloaks, and lying down forgot ere
  long her sorrows and her dread, in calm and innocent slumber.</p>

  <p>She had not been very long asleep, however, when a sound from without the
  door aroused her; and, as she started to her feet, Caius Crispus looked into
  the cell with a flambeau of pine-wood blazing in his right hand, to ascertain
  if she was still within, and safe under his keeping.</p>

  <p>"You have been sleeping, ha!" he exclaimed. "That is well, you must be
  weary. Will you have more wine?"</p>

  <p>"Some water, if you will, but no wine. I am athirst and feverish."</p>

  <p>"You shall have water."</p>

  <p>And thrusting the flambeau into the earth, between the crevices in the
  pavement, he left the room abruptly.</p>

  <p>Scarce was he gone, leaving the whole apartment blazing with a bright
  light which rendered every object within clearly visible to any spectator
  from the farther side of the ravine, before a shrill voice with something of
  a feminine tone, was heard on the other brink, exclaiming in suppressed
  tones&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Hist! hist! Julia?"</p>

  <p>"Great Gods! who calls on Julia?"</p>

  <p>"Julia Serena, is it thou?"</p>

  <p>"Most miserable I!" she made answer. "But who calls me?"</p>

  <p>"A friend&mdash;be wary, and silent, and you shall not lack aid."</p>

  <p>But Julia heard the heavy step of the swordsmith approaching, and laying
  her finger on her lips, she sprang back hastily from the window, and when her
  gaoler entered, was busy, apparently, in arranging her miserable bed.</p>

  <p>It was not long that he tarried; for after casting one keen glance around
  him, to see that all was right; he freed her of his hated presence, taking
  the torch along with him, and leaving her in utter darkness.</p>

  <p>As soon as his footstep had died away into silence, she hurried back to
  the embrasure, and gazed forth earnestly; but the moon had not yet risen, and
  all the gulf of the ravine and the banks on both sides were black as night,
  and she could discern nothing.</p>

  <p>She coughed gently, hoping to attract the attention of her unknown friend,
  and to learn more of her chances of escape; but no farther sound or signal
  was made to her; and, after watching long in hope deferred, and anxiety
  unspeakable, she returned to her sad pallet and bathed her pillow with hot
  tears, until she wept herself at length into unconsciousness of suffering,
  the last refuge of the wretched, when they have not the christian's hope to
  sustain them.</p>

  <p>She was almost worn out with anxiety and toil, and she slept soundly,
  until the blowing of the Roman trumpets in the pass again aroused her; and
  before she had well collected her thoughts so as to satisfy herself where she
  was and wherefore, the shouts and groans of a sudden conflict, the rattling
  of stones and javelins on the tiled roof, the clang of arms, and all the
  dread accompaniments of a mortal conflict, awoke her to a full sense of her
  situation.</p>

  <p>The day lagged tediously and slow. No one came near her, and, although she
  watched the farther side of the gorge, with all the frantic hope which is so
  near akin to despair, she saw nothing, heard nothing, but a few wood-pigeons
  among the leafless tree-tops, but the sob of the torrent and the sigh of the
  wintry wind.</p>

  <p>At times indeed the long stern swell of the legionary trumpets would again
  sound for the assault, and the din of warfare would follow it; but the
  skirmishes were of shorter and shorter duration, and the tumultuous cheering
  of the rebels at the close of every onslaught, proved that their defence had
  been maintained at least, and that the besiegers had gained no advantage.</p>

  <p>It was, perhaps, four o'clock in the afternoon; and the sun was beginning
  to verge to the westward, when, just after the cessation of one of the brief
  attacks&mdash;by which it would appear that the besiegers intended rather to
  harass the garrison and keep them constantly on the alert, than to effect
  anything decided&mdash;the sound of armed footsteps again reached the ears of
  Julia.</p>

  <p>A moment afterward, Caius Crispus entered the room hastily, accompanied by
  Niger and Rufus, the latter bearing in his hand a coil of twisted rope,
  manufactured from the raw hide of the slaughtered cattle, cut into narrow
  stripes, and ingeniously interwoven.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed, starting for a moment, as he saw Julia. "I had
  forgotten you. We have been hardly pressed all day, and I have had no time to
  think of you; but we shall have more leisure now. Are you hungry, Julia?"</p>

  <p>For her only reply she pointed to the food yet untouched, which he had
  brought to her on the previous evening, and shook her head sadly; but uttered
  not a word.</p>

  <p>"Well! well!" he exclaimed, "we have no time to talk about such matters
  now; but eat you shall, or I will have you crammed, as they stuff fat-livered
  geese! Come, Niger, we must lose no minute. If they attack again, and miss me
  from the battlements, they will be suspecting something, and will perhaps
  come prying to the rear.&mdash;Have you seen any soldiers, girl, on this
  side? I trow you have been gazing from the window all day long in the hope of
  escaping, but I suppose you will not tell me truly."</p>

  <p>"If I tell you not truly, I shall hold my peace. But I will tell you, that
  I have seen no human being, no living thing, indeed; unless it be a thrush,
  and three wood pigeons, fluttering in the treetops yonder."</p>

  <p>"That is a lie, I dare be sworn!" cried Niger. "If it had been the truth
  she would not have breathed a word of it to us. Beside which, it is too cool
  altogether!"</p>

  <p>"By Mulciber my patron! if I believed so, it should go hardly with her;
  but it matters not. Come, we must lose no time."</p>

  <p>And passing into the central room of the three, they made one end of the
  rope fast about the waist of Niger, and the other to an upright mullion in
  the embrasure, which, although broken half way up, afforded ample purchase
  whereby to lower him into the chasm.</p>

  <p>This done, the man clambered out of the window very coolly, going
  backward, as if he were about to descend a ladder; but, when his face was on
  the point of disappearing below the sill, as he hung by his hands alone,
  having no foothold whatever, he said quietly, "If I shout, Caius Crispus,
  haul me up instantly. I shall not do so, if there be any path below. But if I
  whistle, be sure that all is right. Lower away. Farewell."</p>

  <p>"Hold on! hold on, man!" replied Crispus quickly, "turn yourself round so
  as to bring your back to the crag's face, else shall the angles of the rock
  maim, and the dust blind you. That's it; most bravely done! you are a right
  good cragsman."</p>

  <p>"I was born among the crags, at all events," answered the other, "and I
  think now that I am going to die among them. But what of that? One must die
  some day! Fewer words! lower away, I say, I am tired of hanging here between
  Heaven and Tartarus!"</p>

  <p>No words were spoken farther, by any of the party; but the smith with the
  aid of Rufus paid out the line rapidly although steadily, hand under hand,
  until the whole length was run out with the exception of some three or four
  feet.</p>

  <p>Just at this moment, when Crispus was beginning to despair of success, and
  was half afraid that he had miscalculated the length of the rope, the strain
  on it was slackened for a moment, and then ceased altogether.</p>

  <p>The next instant a low and guarded whistle rose from the gorge, above the
  gurgling of the waters, but not so loud as to reach any ears save those for
  which it was intended.</p>

  <p>A grim smile curled the swordsmith's lip, and his fierce eye glittered
  with cruel triumph. "We are safe now.&mdash;Catiline will be here long before
  daybreak. Your prayers have availed us, Julia; for I doubt not," he added,
  with malicious irony, "that you have prayed for us."</p>

  <p>Before she had time to reply to his cruel sarcasm, a fresh swell of the
  besiegers' trumpets, and a loud burst of shouts and warcries from the
  battlement announced a fresh attack. The smith rushed from the room instantly
  with Rufus at his heels, and Julia had already made one step toward the
  window, intending to attempt the perilous descent, alone and unaided, when
  Crispus turned back suddenly, crying,</p>

  <p>"The Rope! the Rope! By the Gods! do not leave the rope! She hath enough
  of the Amazon's blood in her to attempt it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of the <i>Roman's</i> blood, say rather!" she exclaimed, springing toward
  the casement, half maddened in perceiving her last hope frustrated.</p>

  <p>Had she reached it, she surely would have perished; for no female head and
  hands, how strong and resolute so ever, could have descended that frail rope,
  and even if they could, the ruffian, rather than see her so escape, would
  have cut it asunder, and so precipitated her to the bottom of the rocky
  chasm.</p>

  <p>But she did not attain her object; for Caius Crispus caught her with both
  arms around the waist and threw her so violently to the after end of the
  room, that, her head striking the angle of the wall, she was stunned for the
  moment, and lay almost senseless on the floor, while the savage, with a rude
  brutal laugh at her disappointment, rushed out of the room, bearing the rope
  along with him.</p>

  <p>Scarce had he gone, however, when, audible distinctly amid the dissonant
  danger of the fray, the same feminine voice, which she had heard on the
  previous night, again aroused her, crying "Hist! hist! hist! Julia."</p>

  <p>She sprang to her feet, and gained the window in a moment, and there, on
  the other verge of the chasm, near twenty feet distant from the window at
  which she stood, she discovered the figure of a slender dark-eyed and
  dark-complexioned boy, clad in a hunter's tunic, and bearing a bow in his
  hand, and a quiver full of arrows on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>She had never seen that boy before; yet was there something in his
  features and expression that seemed familiar to her; that sort of vague
  resemblance to something well known and accustomed, which leads men to
  suppose that they must have dreamed of things which mysteriously enough they
  seem to remember on their first occurrence.</p>

  <p>The boy raised his hand joyously, and cried aloud, without any fear of
  being heard, well knowing that all eyes and ears of the defenders of the
  place were turned to the side when the fight was raging, "Be of good cheer;
  you are saved, Julia. Paullus is nigh at hand, but ere he come, <i>I</i> will
  save you! Be of good courage, watch well these windows, but seem to be
  observing nothing."</p>

  <p>And with the words, he turned away, and was lost to her sight in an
  instant, among the thickly-set underwood. Ere long, however, she caught a
  glimpse of him again, mounted upon a beautiful white horse, and gallopping
  like the wind down the sandy road, which wound through the wooded knolls
  toward the bridge below.</p>

  <p>Again she lost him; and again he glanced upon her sight, for a single
  second, as he spurred his fleet horse across the single arch of brick, and
  dashed into the woods on the hither side of the torrent.</p>

  <p>Two weary hours passed; and the sun was nigh to his setting, and she had
  seen, heard nothing more. Her heart, sickening with hope deferred, and all
  her frame trembling with terrible excitement, she had almost begun to doubt,
  whether the whole appearance of the boy might not have been a mere illusion
  of her feverish senses, a vain creation of her distempered fancy.</p>

  <p>Still, fiercer than before, the battle raged without, and now there was no
  intermission of the uproar; to which was added the crashing of the roofs
  beneath heavy stones, betokening that engines of some kind had been brought
  up from the host, or constructed on the spot.</p>

  <p>At length, however, her close watch was rewarded. A slight stir among the
  evergreen bushes on the brink of the opposite cliff caught her quick eye, and
  in another moment the head of a man, not of the boy whom she had seen before,
  nor yet, as her hope suggested, of her own Paullus, but of an aquiline-nosed
  clean-shorn Roman soldier, with an intelligent expression and quick eye, was
  thrust forward.</p>

  <p>Perceiving Julia at the window, he drew back for a second; and the boy
  appeared in his place, and then both showed themselves together, the soldier
  holding in his hand the bow and arrows of the hunter youth.</p>

  <p>"He is a friend," said the boy, "do all that he commands you."</p>

  <p>But so fiercely was the battle raging now, that it was his signs, rather
  than his words, which she comprehended.</p>

  <p>The next moment, a gesture of his hand warned her to withdraw from the
  embrasure; and scarcely had she done so before an arrow whistled from the bow
  and dropped into the room, having a piece of very slender twine attached to
  the end of it.</p>

  <p>Perceiving the intention at a glance, the quick witted girl detached the
  string from the shaft without delay, and, throwing the latter out of the
  window lest it should betray the plan, drew in the twine, until she had some
  forty yards within the room, when it was checked from the other side, neither
  the soldier nor the youth showing themselves at all during the operation.</p>

  <p>This done, however, the boy again stood forth, and pitched a leaden
  bullet, such as was used by the slingers of the day, into the window.</p>

  <p>Perceiving that the ball was perforated, she secured it in an instant to
  the end of the clue, which she held in her hand, and, judging that the object
  of her friends was to establish a communication from their side, cast it back
  to them with a great effort, having first passed the twine around the
  mullion, by aid of which Crispus had lowered down his messenger.</p>

  <p>The soldier caught the bullet, and nodded his approbation with a smile,
  but again receded into the bushes, suffering the slack of the twine to fall
  down in an easy curve into the ravine: so that the double communication would
  scarce have been perceived, even by one looking for it, in the gathering
  twilight.</p>

  <p>The boy's voice once more reached her ears, though his form was concealed
  among the shrubbery. "Fear nothing, you are safe," he said, "But we can do no
  more until after midnight, when the moon shall give us light to rescue you.
  Be tranquil, and farewell."&mdash;</p>

  <p>Be tranquil!&mdash;tranquil, when life or death&mdash;honor or
  infamy&mdash;bliss or despair, hung on that feeble twine, scarce thicker than
  the spider's web! hung on the chance of every flying second, each one of
  which was bringing nigher and more nigh, the hoofs of Catiline's atrocious
  band.</p>

  <p>When voice of man can bid the waves be tranquil, while the north-wester is
  tossing their ruffian tops, and when the billows slumber at his bidding, then
  may the comforter assay, with some chance of success, to still the throbbings
  of the human heart, convulsed by such hopes, such terrors, as then were all
  but maddening the innocent and tranquil heart of Julia.</p>

  <p>Tranquil she could not be; but she was calm and self-possessed, and
  patient.</p>

  <p>Hour after hour lagged away; and the night fell black as the pit of
  Acheron, and still by the glare of pale fires and torches, the lurid light of
  which she could perceive from her windows, reflected on the heavens, the
  savage combatants fought on, unwearied, and unsparing.</p>

  <p>Once only she went again to that window, wherefrom hung all her hopes; so
  fearful was she, that Crispus might find her there, and suspect what was in
  process.</p>

  <p>With trembling fingers she felt for the twine, fatal as the thread of
  destiny should any fell chance sever it; and in its place she found a stout
  cord, which had been quietly drawn around the mullion, still hanging in a
  deep double bight, invisible amid the gloom, from side to side of the
  chasm.</p>

  <p>And now, for the first time, she comprehended clearly the means by which
  her unknown friends proposed to reach her. By hauling on one end of the rope,
  any light plank or ladder might be drawn over to the hither from the farther
  bank, and the gorge might so be securely bridged, and safely traversed.</p>

  <p>Perceiving this, and fancying that she could distinguish the faint clink
  of a hammer among the trees beyond the forest knoll, she did indeed become
  almost tranquil.</p>

  <p>She even lay down on her couch, and closed her eyes, and exerted all the
  power of her mind to be composed and self-possessed, when the moment of her
  destiny should arrive.</p>

  <p>But oh! how day-long did the minutes seem; how more than year-long the
  hours.</p>

  <p>She opened her curtained lids, and lo! what was that faint pale lustre,
  glimmering through the tree-tops on the far mountain's brow?&mdash;all glory
  to Diana, chaste guardian of the chaste and pure! it was the signal of her
  safety! it was! it was the ever-blessed moon!&mdash;</p>

  <p>Breathless with joy, she darted to the opening, and slowly, warily
  creeping athwart the gloomy void, she saw the cords drawn taught, and running
  stiffly, it is true, and reluctantly, but surely, around the mouldering stone
  mullion; while from the other side, ghost-like and pale, the skeleton of a
  light ladder, was advancing to meet her hand as if by magic.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes more and she would be free! oh! the strange bliss, the
  inconceivable rapture of that thought! free from pollution, infamy! free to
  live happy and unblemished! free to be the beloved, the honored bride of her
  own Arvina.</p>

  <p>Why did she shudder suddenly? why grew she rigid with dilated eyes, and
  lips apart, like a carved effigy of agonized surprise?&mdash;</p>

  <p>Hark to that rising sound, more rapid than the rush of the stream, and
  louder than the wailing of the wind! thick pattering down the rocky gorge!
  nearer and nearer, 'till it thunders high above all the tumult of the battle!
  the furious gallop of approaching horse, the sharp and angry clang of
  harness!&mdash;</p>

  <p>Lo! the hot glare, outfacing the pale moonbeam, the fierce crimson blaze
  of torches gleaming far down the mountain side, a torrent of rushing
  fire!</p>

  <p>Hark! the wild cheer, "Catiline! Catiline!" to the skies! mixed with the
  wailing blast of the Roman trumpets, unwillingly retreating from the half-won
  watchtower!&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Pull for your lives!" she cried, in accents full of horror and appalling
  anguish&mdash;"Pull! pull! if ye would not see me perish!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>But it was all too late. Amid a storm of tumultuous acclamation, Catiline
  drew his panting charger up before the barricaded gateway, which had so long
  resisted the dread onset of the legionaries, and which now instantly flew
  open to admit him. Waving his hand to his men to pursue the retreating
  infantry, he sprang down from his horse, uttering but one word in the deep
  voice of smothered passion&mdash;"Julia!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>His armed foot clanged on the pavement, ere the bridge was entirely
  withdrawn; for they, who manned the ropes, now dragged it back, as vehemently
  as they had urged forward a moment since.</p>

  <p>"Back from the window, Julia!"&mdash;cried the voice&mdash;"If he perceive
  the ropes, all is lost! Trust me, we never will forsake you! Meet him! be
  bold! be daring! but defy him not!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>Scarce had she time to catch the friendly admonition and act on it, as she
  did instantly, before the door of the outer room was thrown violently open;
  and, with his sallow face inflamed and fiery, and his black eye blazing with
  hellish light, Catiline exclaimed, as he strode in hot haste across the
  threshold,</p>

  <p>"At last! at last, I have thee, Julia!"</p>

     style="text-align:center"><i>Time and the tide wear through the longest
     day.</i> &mdash;Shakspeare.</p><br>

  <p class="first">"AT last, I have thee, Julia!"</p>

  <p>Mighty indeed was the effort of the mind, which enabled that fair slight
  girl to bear up with an undaunted lip and serene eye against the presence of
  that atrocious villain; and hope, never-dying hope, was the spirit which
  nerved her to that effort.</p>

  <p>It was strange, knowing as she did the character of that atrocious and
  bloodthirsty tyrant, that she should not have given way entirely to feminine
  despair and terror, or sought by tears and prayers to disarm his purpose.</p>

  <p>But her high blood cried out from every vein and artery of her body; and
  she stood calm and sustained by conscious virtue, even in that extremity of
  peril; neither tempting assault by any display of coward weakness, nor
  provoking it by any show of defiance.</p>

  <p>There is nothing, perhaps, so difficult to any one who is not a butcher or
  an executioner by trade, with sensibilities blunted by the force of habit, as
  to attack or injure any thing, which neither flies, nor resists, neither
  braves, nor trembles.</p>

  <p>And Catiline himself, savage and brutal as he was, full of ungoverned
  impulse and unbridled passion, felt, though he knew not wherefore, this
  difficulty at this moment.</p>

  <p>Had she fallen at his feet, trembling, and tearful, and implored his
  mercy, he would have gloated on her terrors, laughed tears and prayers to
  scorn, yea! torn her from an altar's foot, to pour out upon her the vials of
  agony and foul pollution.</p>

  <p>Had she defied, or braved his violence, his fury would have trampled her
  to the earth in an instant, and murder would have followed in the footsteps
  of worse violence.</p>

  <p>But as she stood there, firm, cold, erect, and motionless as a statue of
  rare marble, with scarcely a pulse throbbing in her veins, and her clear
  azure eyes fixed on him with a cold and steady gaze, as if she would have
  fascinated him by their serene chaste influence, he likewise stood and gazed
  upon her with a strange mixture of impressions, wherein something akin to
  love and admiration were blent with what, in minds of better mould, should
  have been reverence and awe.</p>

  <p>He felt, in short, that he lacked 'a spur to prick the sides of his
  intent,' a provocation to insult and aggression yet stronger than the passion
  and hot thirst of vengeance, which had been well nigh chilled by her severe
  and icy fortitude.</p>

  <p>'Tis said that a lion will turn and flee, From a maid in the pride of her
  purity;</p>

  <p>and here a fiercer and more dangerous savage stood powerless and daunted
  for the moment, by the same holy influence of virtue, which, it is said, has
  potency to tame the pinched king of the desert.</p>

  <p>It was not, however, in the nature of that man to yield himself up long to
  any influence, save that of his own passions, and after standing mute for
  perhaps a minute, during which the flush on his sallow cheek, and the glare
  of his fiery eye, were blanched and dimmed somewhat, he advanced a step or
  two toward her, repeating the words,</p>

  <p>"I have thee; thou art mine, Julia."</p>

  <p>"Thy prisoner, Catiline," she replied quietly&mdash;"if you make women
  prisoners."</p>

  <p>"My slave, minion."</p>

  <p>"I am free-born, and noble. A patrician of a house as ancient as thine
  own. My ancestors, I have heard say, fought side by side with Sergius
  Silo."</p>

  <p>"The more cause, that their daughter should sleep side by side with
  Sergius Catiline!" he replied with bitter irony; but there was less of actual
  passion in his tones, than of a desire to lash himself into fury.</p>

  <p>"The less cause that a free-born lady should be disgraced by the grandson
  of his comrade in arms, who gave her father being."</p>

  <p>Thus far her replies had been conducted in the spirit most likely to
  control, if any thing could control, the demon that possessed him; but seeing
  that her words had produced more effect on him than she had deemed possible,
  she made an effort to improve her advantage, and added, looking him firmly in
  the eye,</p>

  <p>"I have heard tell that thou art proud, Catiline, as thou art nobly born.
  Let, then, thine own pride"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Proud! Proud! Ha! minion! What have your <i>nobles</i> left me that I
  should glory in&mdash;what of which I may still be proud? A name of the
  grandest, blasted by their base lies, and infamous! Service converted into
  shame! valor warped into crime! At home poverty, degradation, ruin! Abroad,
  debt, mockery, disgrace! Proud! proud! By Nemesis! fond girl. I am
  proud&mdash;to be the thing that they have made me, a terror, and a curse to
  all who call themselves patrician. For daring, remorseless! for brave, cruel!
  for voluptuous, sensual! for fearless, ruthless! for enterprising, reckless!
  for ambitious, desperate! for a man, a monster! for a philosopher, an
  atheist! Ha! ha! ha! ha! I am proud, minion, proud to be that I am&mdash;that
  which thou, Julia, shalt soon find me!"</p>

  <p>She perceived, when it was too late, the error which she had made, and
  fearful of incensing him farther, answered nothing. But he was not so to be
  set at naught, for he had succeeded now in lashing himself into a fit of
  fury, and advancing upon her, with a face full of all hideous passions, a
  face that denoted his fell purpose, as plainly as any words could declare
  them.</p>

  <p>"Dost hear me, girl, I say? Thou art mine, Julia."</p>

  <p>"Thy prisoner, Catiline," she again repeated in the same steady tone as at
  first; but the charm had now failed of its effect, and it was fortunate for
  the sweet girl, that the fell wretch before whom she stood defenceless, had
  so much of the cat-like, tiger-like spirit in his nature, so much that
  prompted him to tantalize and torment before striking, to teaze and harass
  and break down the mind, before doing violence to the body of his subject
  enemies, or of those whom he chose to deem such.</p>

  <p>Had he suspected at this moment that any chance of succor was at hand,
  however remote, he lacked neither the will nor the occasion to destroy her.
  He fancied that she was completely at his mercy; and perceiving that, in
  despite of her assumed coolness, she writhed beneath the terrors of his
  tongue, he revelled in the fiendish pleasure of triumphing in words over her
  spirit, before wreaking his vengeance on her person.</p>

  <p>"My slave! Julia. My slave, soul and body! my slave, here and for ever!
  Slave to my passions, and my pleasures! Wilt yield, or resist, fair girl?
  Resist, I do beseech thee! Let some fire animate those lovely eyes, even if
  it be the fire of fury&mdash;some light kindle those pallid cheeks, even if
  it be the light of hatred! I am aweary of tame conquests."</p>

  <p>"Then wherefore conquer; or conquering, wherefore not spare?"&mdash;she
  answered.</p>

  <p>"I conquer, to slake my thirst of vengeance. I spare not, for the wise
  man's word to the fallen, is still, VAE VICTIS. Wilt yield, or resist, Julia?
  wilt be the sharer, or the victim of my pleasures? speak, I say, speak!" he
  shouted savagely, perceiving that she sought to evade a direct answer. "Speak
  and reply, directly, or I will do to thee forthwith what most thou dreadest!
  and then wipe out thy shame by agonies of death, to which the tortures of old
  Regulus were luxury."</p>

  <p>"If I must choose, the victim!" she replied steadily. "But I believe you
  will not so disgrace your manhood."</p>

  <p>"Ha! you believe so, you shall feel soon and know. One question more, wilt
  thou yield or resist?"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Resist," she answered, "to the last, and when dishonored, die, and by
  death, like Lucretia, win back greater honor! Lucretia's death had witnesses,
  and her tale found men's ears."</p>

  <p>"Thy death shall be silent, thy shame loud. I will proclaim the first my
  deed, the last thy voluntary&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

  <p>"Proclaim it!"&mdash;she interrupted him, with her eyes flashing bright
  indignation, and her lip curling with ineffable disdain; as she forgot all
  prudence in the scorn called forth by his injurious words&mdash;"Proclaim it
  to the world! who will believe it?"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The world. Frailty's name is woman!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And Falsehood's&mdash;Catiline!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"By Hades!"&mdash;and he sprang upon her with a bound like that of a
  tiger, and twined his arms about her waist, clasping her to his breast with
  brutal violence, and striving to press his foul lips on her innocent mouth;
  but she, endowed with momentary strength, infinitely unwonted and unnatural,
  the strength of despair and frenzy, caught his bare throat with both her
  hands, and writhing herself back to the full length of her arms, uttered a
  volume of shrieks, so awfully shrill and piercing, that they struck terror
  into the souls of the brutal rebels without, and harrowed up the spirits of
  her friends, who lay concealed within earshot, waiting, now almost in
  despair, an opportunity to aid her.</p>

  <p>So strong was the clutch which her small hands had fixed upon his throat,
  that ere he could release himself, sufficiently to draw a full breath, he was
  compelled to let her go; and ere he fully recovered himself, she had made a
  spring back toward the window, with the evident purpose of throwing herself
  out into the yawning gulf below it.</p>

  <p>But something caught her eye which apparently deterred her, and turning
  her back upon it quickly, she faced her persecutor once again.</p>

  <p>At this moment, there was a loud and angry bustle in the outer court,
  immediately followed by a violent knocking at the door; but so terrible was
  the excitement of both these human beings, her's the excitement of innocence
  in trial, his of atrocity triumphant, that neither heard it, though it was
  sudden and strong enough to have startled any sleepers, save those of the
  grave.</p>

  <p>"Ha! but this charms me! I knew not that you had so much of the Tigress to
  fit you for the Tiger's mate. But what a fool you are to waste your breath in
  yells and your strength in struggles, like to those, when there are none to
  hear, or to witness them."</p>

  <p>"Witnesses are found to all crimes right early and avengers!" she
  exclaimed with the high mien of a prophetess; and still that vehement
  knocking continued, unheeded as the earthquake which reeled unnoticed beneath
  the feet of the combatants at Thrasymene.</p>

  <p>"To this at least there are no witnesses! there shall be no avengers!"</p>

  <p>"The Gods are my witnesses! shall be my avengers!"</p>

  <p>"Tush! there are no Gods, Julia!"</p>

  <p>And again he rushed on her and caught her in his arms. But as he spoke
  those impious words, sprang to do that atrocious deed, a witness was found,
  and it might be an avenger.</p>

  <p>Unnoticed by the traitor in the fierce whirlwind of his passion, that
  hunter boy stood forth on the further brink; revealed, a boy no longer; for
  the Phrygian bonnet had fallen off, and the redundant raven tresses of a girl
  flowed back on the wind. Her attitude and air were those of Diana as she bent
  her good bow against the ravisher Orion. Her right foot advanced firmly, her
  right hand drawn back to the ear, her fine eye glaring upon the arrow which
  bore with unerring aim full on the breast of her own corrupter, her own
  father, Catiline.</p>

  <p>Who had more wrongs to avenge than Lucia?</p>

  <p>Another second, and the shaft would have quivered in the heart of the arch
  villain, sped by the hand from which he deserved it the most dearly. The room
  within was brighter than day from the red torch light which filled it,
  falling full on the gaunt form and grim visage of the monster. Her hand was
  firm, her eye steady, her heart pitiless. But in the better course of her
  changed life, heaven spared her the dread crime of parricide.</p>

  <p>Just as the chord was at the tightest, just as the feathers quivered, and
  the barb thrilled, about to leap from the terse string, the tall form of the
  soldier sprang up into the clear moonlight from the underwood, and crying
  "Hold! hold!" mastered her bowhand, with the speed of light, and dragged her
  down into the covert.</p>

  <p>Well was it that he did so. For just as Catiline seized Julia the second
  time in his resistless grasp, and ere his lips had contaminated her sweet
  mouth, the giant Crispus, who had so long been knocking unheeded, rushed into
  the room, and seized his leader by the shoulder unseen, until he literally
  touched him.</p>

  <p>"Another time for this;" he said, "Catiline. There are tidings from Rome;
  which&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To Tartarus with thy tidings! Let them tarry!"</p>

  <p>"They will not tarry, Catiline," replied the smith, who was as pale as a
  ghost and almost trembling&mdash;"least of all for such painted woman's flesh
  as this is!"</p>

  <p>"Get thee away! It were better, wiser, safer to stand between the Lion and
  his prey, than between Catiline and Julia."</p>

  <p>"Then have it!" shouted the smith. "All is discovered! all undone!
  Lentulus and Cethegus, Gabinius and Statilius, and Caeparius all dead by the
  hangman's noose in the Tullianum!"</p>

  <p>"The idiots! is that all? thy precious tidings! See! how I will avenge
  them." And he struggled to shake himself free from the grasp of Crispus.</p>

  <p>But the smith held him firmly, and replied, "It is not all, Catiline.
  Metellus Celer is within ten leagues of the camp, at the foot of the
  mountains. We have no retreat left into Gaul. Come! come! speak to the
  soldiers! You can deal with this harlotry hereafter."</p>

  <p>Catiline glared upon him, as if he would have stabbed him to the heart;
  but seeing the absolute necessity of enquiring into the truth of this report,
  he turned to leave the room.</p>

  <p>"The Gods be praised! the Gods have spoken loud! The Gods have saved me!"
  cried Julia falling on her knees. "Are there no Gods now, O Catiline?"</p>

  <p>"To Hades! with thy Gods!" and, striking the unhappy girl a coward blow,
  which felled her to the ground senseless, he rushed from the room with his
  confederate in crime, barring the outer door behind him.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch218"
     name="ch218"></a>XVIII. &mdash; THE RESCUE</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>Speed, Malise, speed, the dun deer's hide<br>
  On fleeter foot was never tied.</i><br>
  &mdash;Lady of the Lake.</p><br>

  <p class="first">SCARCELY had the door closed behind Catiline, who rushed
  forth torch in hand, as if goaded by the furies of Orestes, when half a dozen
  stout men, sheathed in the full armor of Roman legionaries, sprang out of the
  brushwood on the gorge's brink, and seizing the ropes which had hung idle
  during that critical hour, hauled on them with such energetical and zealous
  power, that the ladder was drawn across the chasm with almost lightning
  speed.</p>

  <p>The hooks, with which its outer end was garnished, caught in the crevices
  of the ruined wall, and a slender communication was established, although the
  slight structure which bridged the abyss was scarcely capable of supporting
  the weight of a human being.</p>

  <p>The soldiers, accustomed, as all Roman soldiers were, to all the
  expediences and resources of warfare, had prepared planks which were to be
  run forward on the ladder, in order to construct a firm bridge. For the plan
  of the besiegers, until interrupted by Catiline's arrival, had been to take
  the stronghold in reverse, while a false attack in front should be in
  progress, and throwing ten or twelve stout soldiers into the heart of the
  place, to make themselves masters of it by a coup-de-main.</p>

  <p>This well-devised scheme being rendered unfeasible by the sudden charge of
  Catiline's horse, and the rout of the legionaries, the small subaltern's
  detachment which had been sent round under Lucia's guidance&mdash;for it was
  she, who had discerned the means of passing the chasm, while lying in wait to
  assist Julia, and disclosed it to the centurion commanding&mdash;had been
  left alone, and isolated, its line of retreat cut off, and itself without a
  leader.</p>

  <p>The singular scenes, however, which they had witnessed, the interest which
  almost involuntarily they had been led to take in the fate of the fair girl,
  her calm and dauntless fortitude, and above all the atrocious villainy of
  Catiline, had inspired every individual of that little band with an heroic
  resolution to set their lives upon a cast, in order to rescue one who to all
  of them was personally unknown.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, the discovery of Lucia's sex&mdash;for they had
  believed her to be what she appeared, a boy&mdash;which followed immediately
  on the loss of her Phrygian bonnet, and the story of her bitter wrongs, which
  had taken wind, acted as a powerful incentive to men naturally bold and
  enterprising.</p>

  <p>For it is needless to add, that with the revelation of her sex, that of
  her character as the arch-traitor's child and victim went, as it were, hand
  in hand.</p>

  <p>They had resolved, therefore, on rescuing the one, and revenging the other
  of these women, at any risk to themselves whatsoever; and now having waited
  their opportunity with the accustomed patience of Roman veterans, they acted
  upon it with their habitual skill and celerity.</p>

  <p>But rapid as were their movements, they were outstripped by the almost
  superhuman agility of Lucia, who, knowing well the character of the human
  fiend with whom they had to contend, his wondrous promptitude in counsel, his
  lightning speed in execution, was well assured that there was not one moment
  to be lost, if they would save Arvina's betrothed bride from a fate worse
  than many deaths.</p>

  <p>As soon therefore as she saw the hooks of the scaling ladder catch firm
  hold of the broken wall, before a single plank had been laid over its frail
  and distant rungs, she bounded over it with the light and airy foot of a
  practised dancer&mdash;finding account at that perilous moment in one of
  those indelicate accomplishments in which she had been instructed for
  purposes the basest and most horrible.</p>

  <p>Accustomed as they were to deeds of energy and rapid daring, the stout
  soldiers stood aghast; for, measuring the action by their own weight and
  ponderous armature, they naturally overrated its peril to one so slightly
  made as Lucia.</p>

  <p>And yet the hazard was extreme, for not taking it into account that a
  single slip or false step must precipitate her into the abyss, the slender
  woodwork of the ladder actually bent as she alighted on it, from each of her
  long airy bounds.</p>

  <p>It was but a second, however, in which she glanced across it, darted
  through the small embrasure, and was lost to the eyes of the men within the
  darkness of the old barrack.</p>

  <p>Astonished though they were at the girl's successful daring, the soldiers
  were not paralyzed at all, nor did they cease from their work.</p>

  <p>In less than a minute after she had entered the window, a board was thrust
  forward, running upon the framework of the ladder, and upon that a stout
  plank, two feet in breadth, capable of supporting, if necessary, the weight
  of several armed men.</p>

  <p>Nor had this bridge been established many seconds before the soldier in
  command ran forward upon it, and met Lucia at the embrasure, bearing with
  strength far greater than her slight form and unmuscular limbs appeared to
  promise, the still senseless form of Julia.</p>

  <p>Catching her from the arms of Lucia, the robust legionary cast the
  fainting girl across his shoulder as though she had been a feather; and
  rushed back with her toward his comrades, crying aloud in haste
  alarm&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Quick! quick! follow me quick, Lucia. I hear footsteps, they are
  coming!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>The caution was needless, for almost outstripping the heavy soldier, the
  fleet-footed girl stood with him on the farther bank.</p>

  <p>Yet had it come a moment later, it would have come all too late.</p>

  <p>For having with his wonted celerity ascertained the truth of these fatal
  tidings, and ordered the body of horse whom he had brought up with him, and
  who had returned from pursuing the infantry, on seeing a larger body coming
  up from Antonius' army, to return with all speed to the camp of Manlius,
  retaining only a dozen troopers as a personal escort, Catiline had come back
  to bear off his lovely captive.</p>

  <p>The clang of his haughty step had reached the ears of the legionary just
  as he drew poor Julia, unconscious of her rescue, through the barrack window;
  and as they stood on the brink of the ravine, thus far in safety, the red
  glare of the torches streaming through the embrasures, announced the arrival
  of their enemies, within almost arm's length of them.</p>

  <p>The awful burst of imprecations which thundered from the lips of Catiline,
  as he perceived that his victim had been snatched from him, struck awe even
  into the hearts of those brave veterans.</p>

  <p>A tiger robbed of its young is but a weak and poor example of the frantic,
  ungovernable, beast-like rage which appeared to prevail entirely above all
  senses, all consideration, and all reason.</p>

  <p>"May I perish ill! may I die crucified! may the fowls of the air, the
  beasts of the field devour me, if she so escape!" he shouted; and perceiving
  the means by which she had been carried off, he called loudly for his men to
  follow, and was in the very act of leaping out from the embrasure upon the
  bridge, which they had not time to withdraw, when one of the legionaries
  spurned away the frail fabric with his foot, and drawing his short falchion
  severed the cords which secured it, at a single blow.</p>

  <p>Swinging off instantly in mid air, it was dashed heavily against the rocky
  wall of the precipice, and, dislodged by the shock, the planks went
  thundering down into the torrent, at the bottom of the gorge; while upheld by
  the hooks to the stone window sill, the ladder hung useless on Catiline's
  side of the chasm, all communication thus completely interrupted.</p>

  <p>At the same moment three of the heavy pila, which were the peculiar
  missiles of the legion, were hurled by as many stout arms at the furious
  desperado; but it was not his fate so to perish. One of the pondrous weapons
  hurtled so close to his temple that the keen head razed the skin, the others,
  blunted or shivered against the sides or lintel of the window, fell harmless
  into the abyss.</p>

  <p>"Thou fool!" cried the man who had rescued Julia, addressing him who had
  cut away the bridge, "thou shouldst have let him reach the middle, ere thou
  didst strike that blow. Then would he have lain there now," and he pointed
  downward with his finger into the yawning gulf.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," replied the other. "By the Gods! Catiline is near enough
  to me, when he is twenty paces distant."</p>

  <p>"Thou art right, soldier, and didst well and wisely," said Lucia, hastily.
  "Hadst thou tarried to strike until he reached the middle, thou never wouldst
  have stricken at all. One foot without that window, he would have cleared
  that chasm, as easily as I would leap a furrow. But come! come! come! we must
  not loiter, nor lose one instant. He will not so submit to be thwarted, I
  have two horses by the roadside yonder. Their speed alone shall save us."</p>

  <p>"Right! right!" replied the soldier, "lead to them quickly. It is for life
  or death! Hark! he is calling his men now to horse. We shall have a close run
  for it, by Hercules!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And we?"&mdash;asked one of the veterans&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Disperse yourselves among the hills, and make your way singly to the
  camp. He will not think of you, with us before him!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Farewell! The Gods guide and guard thee!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We shall much need, I fear, their guidance!" answered the legionary,
  setting off at a swift pace, still bearing Julia, who was now beginning to
  revive in the fresh air, following hard on Lucia, who ran, literally like the
  wind, to the spot where she had tied her own beautiful white Ister, and
  another horse, a powerful and well-bred Thracian charger, to the stems of two
  chesnut trees, in readiness for any fortunes.</p>

  <p>Rapidly as the soldier ran, still the light-footed girl outstripped him,
  and when he reached the sandy road, she had already loosened the reins from
  the trees to which they had been attached, and held them in readiness.</p>

  <p>"Mount, mount" cried Lucia, "for your life! I will help you to lift
  her."</p>

  <p>"I am better now," exclaimed Julia&mdash;"Oh ye Gods! and safe too! I can
  help myself now! and in an instant she was seated behind the stout
  man-at-arms, and clinging with both hands to his sword belt.</p>

  <p>"If you see me no more, as I think you will not, Julia, tell Paullus,
  Lucia saved you, and&mdash;died, for love of him! Now&mdash;ride! ride! ride!
  for your life ride!"</p>

  <p>And giving their good horses head they sprang forth, plying the rein and
  scourge, at headlong speed.</p>

  <p>As they ascended the first little hillock, they saw the troopers of
  Catiline pouring out of the watch-tower gate, and thundering down the slope
  toward the bridge, with furious shouts, at a rate scarcely inferior to their
  own.</p>

  <p>They had but one hope of safety. To reach the little bridge and pass it
  before their pursuers should gain it, and cut off their retreat toward their
  friends, whom they knew to be nigh at hand; but to do so appeared well nigh
  impossible.</p>

  <p>It was a little in their favor that the steeds of Catiline's troopers had
  been harassed by a long and unusually rapid night march, while their own were
  fresh and full of spirit; but this advantage was neutralized at least by the
  double weight which impeded the progress and bore down the energies of the
  noble Thracian courser, bearing Julia and the soldier.</p>

  <p>Again it was in their favor that the road on their side the chasm was
  somewhat shorter and much more level than that by which Catiline and his
  riders were straining every nerve, gallopping on a parallel line with the
  tremulous and excited fugitives; but this advantage also was diminished by
  the fact that they must turn twice at right angles&mdash;once to gain the
  bridge, and once more into the high road beyond it&mdash;while the rebels had
  a straight course, though down a hill side so steep that it might well be
  called precipitous.</p>

  <p>The day had by this time broken, and either party could see the other
  clearly, even to the dresses of the men and the colors of the horses, not
  above the sixth part of a mile being occupied by the valley of the stream
  dividing the two roads.</p>

  <p>For life! fire flashed from the flinty road at every bound of the brave
  coursers, and blood flew from every whirl of the knotted thong; but gallantly
  the high-blooded beasts answered it. At every bound they gained a little on
  their pursuers, whose horses foamed and labored down the abrupt descent, one
  or two of them falling and rolling over their riders, so steep was the
  declivity.</p>

  <p>For life! Catiline had gained the head of his party, and his black horse
  had outstripped them by several lengths.</p>

  <p>If the course had been longer the safety of the fugitives would have been
  now certain; but so brief was the space and so little did they gain in that
  awful race, that the nicest eye hardly could have calculated which first
  would reach the bridge.</p>

  <p>So secure of his prize was Catiline, that his keen blade was already out,
  and as he bowed over his charger's neck, goring his flanks with his bloody
  spurs, he shouted in his hoarse demoniacal accents, "Victory and
  vengeance!"</p>

  <p>Still, hopeful and dauntless, the stout legionary gallopped
  on&mdash;"Courage!" he exclaimed, "courage, lady, we shall first cross the
  bridge!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>Had Lucia chosen it, with her light weight and splendid horsemanship, she
  might easily have left Julia and the soldier, easily have crossed the defile
  in advance of Catiline, easily have escaped his vengeance. But she reined in
  white Ister, and held him well in hand behind the others, muttering to
  herself in low determined accents, "She shall be saved, but my time is
  come!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly there was a hasty shout of alarm from the troopers on the other
  side, "Hold, Catiline! Rein up! Rein up!" and several of the foremost riders
  drew in their horses. Within a minute all except Catiline had halted.</p>

  <p>"They see our friends! they are close at hand! We are saved! by the
  Immortal Gods! we are saved!" cried the legionary, with a cry of triumph.</p>

  <p>But in reply, across the narrow gorge, came the hoarse roar of Catiline,
  above the din of his thundering gallop.&mdash;"By Hades! Death! or
  vengeance!"</p>

  <p>"Ride! ride!" shrieked Lucia from behind, "Ride, I say, fool! you are
  <i>not</i> saved! He will not halt for a beat when revenge spurs him! For
  your life! ride!"</p>

  <p>It was a fearful crisis.</p>

  <p>The Thracian charger reached the bridge. The hollow arch resounded but
  once under his clanging hoofs&mdash;the second stride cleared it. He wheeled
  down the road, and Julia, pale as death, whose eyes had been closed in the
  agony of that fearful expectation, unclosed them at the legionary's joyous
  shout, but closed them again in terror and despair with a faint shriek, as
  they met the grim countenance of Catiline, distorted with every hellish
  passion, and splashed with blood gouts from his reeking courser's side,
  thrust forward parallel nearly to the black courser's foamy jaws&mdash;both
  nearly within arm's length of her, as it appeared to her excited fancy.</p>

  <p>"We are lost! we are lost!" she screamed.</p>

  <p>"We are saved! we are saved!" shouted the soldier as he saw coming up the
  road at a gallop to meet them, the bronze casques and floating horse-hair
  crests, and scarlet cloaks, of a whole squadron of legionary cavalry, arrayed
  beneath a golden eagle&mdash;the head of their column scarcely distant three
  hundred yards.</p>

  <p>But they were not saved yet, nor would have been&mdash;for Catiline's
  horse was close upon their croupe and his uplifted blade almost flashed over
  them&mdash;when, with a wild cry, Lucia dashed her white Ister at full speed,
  as she crossed the bridge, athwart the counter of black Erebus.</p>

  <p>The thundering speed at which the black horse came down the hill, and the
  superior weight of himself and his rider, hurled the white palfrey and the
  brave girl headlong; but his stride was checked, and, blown as he was, he
  stumbled, and rolled over, horse and man.</p>

  <p>A minute was enough to save them, and before Lucia had regained her feet,
  the ranks of the new comers had opened to receive the fugitives, and had
  halted around them, in some slight confusion.</p>

  <p>"The Gods be blessed for ever!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands, and
  raising her eyes to heaven. "I have saved her!"</p>

  <p>"And lost thyself, thrice miserable fool!" hissed a hoarse well known
  voice in her ear, as a heavy hand seized her by the shoulder, and twisted her
  violently round.</p>

  <p>She stood face to face with Catiline, and met his horrid glare of hate
  with a glance prouder than his own and brighter. She smiled triumphantly, as
  she said in a clear high voice,</p>

  <p>"I have saved her!"</p>

  <p>"For which, take thy reward, in this, and this, and this!"</p>

  <p>And with the words he dealt her three stabs, the least of which was
  mortal; but, even in that moment of dread passion, with fiendish ingenuity he
  endeavored to avoid giving her a wound that should be directly fatal.</p>

  <p>"There writhe, and howl, 'till slow death relieve you!"</p>

  <p>"Meet end to such beginning!" cried the unhappy girl. "Adulterous parent!
  incestuous seducer! kindred slayer! ha! ha! ha! ha!" and with a wild laugh
  she fell to the ground and lay with her eyes closed, motionless and for the
  moment senseless.</p>

  <p>But he, with his child's blood smoking on his hand, shook his sword aloft
  fiercely against the legionaries, and leaping on his black horse which had
  arisen from the ground unhurt by its fall, gallopped across the bridge; and
  plunging through the underwood into the deep chesnut forest was lost to the
  view of the soldiers, who had spurred up in pursuit of him, that they
  abandoned it ere long as hopeless.</p>

  <p>It was not long that Lucia lay oblivious of her sufferings. A sense of
  fresh coolness on her brow, and the checked flow of the blood, which gushed
  from those cruel wounds, were the first sensations of which she became
  aware.</p>

  <p>But, as she opened her eyes, they met well known and loving faces; and
  soft hands were busy about her bleeding gashes; and hot tears were falling on
  her poor pallid face from eyes that seldom wept.</p>

  <p>Julia was kneeling at her side, Paullus Arvina was bending over her in
  speechless gratitude, and sorrow; and the stern cavaliers of the legion,
  unused to any soft emotions, stood round holding their chargers' bridles with
  frowning brows, and lips quivering with sentiments, which few of them had
  experienced since the far days of their gentler boyhood.</p>

  <p>"Oh! happy," she exclaimed, in a soft low tone, "how happy it is so to
  die! and in dying to see thee, Paullus."</p>

  <p>"Oh! no! no! no!" cried Julia, "you must not, shall not die! my friend, my
  sister! O, tell her, Paullus, that she will not die, that she will yet be
  spared to our prayers, our love, our gratitude, our veneration."</p>

  <p>But Paullus spoke not; a soldier, and a man used to see death in all
  shapes in the arena, he knew that there was no hope, and, had his life
  depended on it, he could not, at that moment have deceived her.</p>

  <p>Little, however, cared the dying girl for that; even if she had heard or
  comprehended the appeal. Her ears, her mind, were full of other thoughts, and
  a bright beautiful irradiation played over her wan lips and ashy features, as
  she cried joyously, although her voice was very tremulous and weak.</p>

  <p>"Paullus, do you hear that? her friend! her sister! Paullus, Paullus, do
  you hear that? Julia calls me her friend&mdash;me, me her sister! me the
  disgraced&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Peace! peace! Dear Lucia! you must not speak such words!" said Paullus.
  "Be your past errors what they may&mdash;and who am I, that I should talk of
  errors?&mdash;this pure high love&mdash;this delicate devotion&mdash;this
  death most heroical and glorious no! no! I cannot&mdash;" and the strong man
  bowed his head upon his hands, and burst into an agony of tears and
  passion.</p>

  <p>No revelation from on high had taught those poor Romans, that 'joy shall
  be in heaven, over the sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine
  just persons that need no repentance.'</p>

  <p>Yet groping darkly on their way by the dim lights of nature and
  philosophy, they had perceived, at least, that it is harder far for one
  corrupted from her very childhood, corrupted by the very parents who should
  have guided, with all her highest qualities of mind and body perverted
  studiously till they had hardened into vices, to raise herself erect at once
  from the slough of sensuality and sin, and spring aloft, as the butterfly
  transmuted from the grub, into the purity and loveliness of virtue&mdash;than
  for one, who hath known no trial, suffered no temptation, to hold the path of
  rectitude unswerving.</p>

  <p>And Julia, whose high soul and native delicacy were all incapable of
  comprehending the nature, much less the seductions, of such degradation, as
  that poor victim of parental villainy had undergone, saw clearly and
  understood at a glance, the difficulty, the gloriousness, the wonder of that
  beautiful regeneration.</p>

  <p>"No, no. Dear Lucia, dear sister, if you love that name," she said in
  soothing tones, holding her cold hands clasped in her own quivering fingers,
  "indeed, indeed you must not think or speak of yourself thus. Your sins, if
  you have sinned, are the sins of others, your virtues and your excellence,
  all, all your own. I have heard many times of women, who have fallen from
  high virtue, in spite of noble teachings, in spite of high examples, and whom
  neither love nor shame could rescue from pollution&mdash;but never, never,
  did I hear of one who so raised herself, alone, unaided, in spite of evil
  teaching, in spite the atrocity of others, in spite of infamous examples, to
  purity, devotion such as thine! But, fear not, Lucia. Fear not, dearest girl,
  you shall not die, believe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do not fear, I desire it," said the dying girl, who was growing weaker
  and fainter every moment. "To a life, and a love like mine, both guilty, both
  unhappy, death is a refuge, not a terror; and if there be, as you believe,
  who are so wise and virtuous, a place beyond the grave, where souls parted
  here on earth, may meet and dwell in serene and tranquil bliss, perhaps, I
  say, perhaps, Julia, this death may compensate that life&mdash;this blood may
  wash away the sin, the shame, the pollution."</p>

  <p>"Believe it, O believe it!" exclaimed Julia earnestly. "How else should
  the Gods be all-great and all-wise; since vice triumphs often <i>here</i>,
  and virtue pines in sorrow. Be sure, I say, be sure of it, there is a place
  hereafter, where all sorrows shall be turned to joy, all sufferings
  compensated, all inequalities made even. Be sure of that, dear Lucia."</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it," she replied, a brighter gleam of pleasure crossing her
  features, on which the hues of death were fast darkening. "I am sure of it
  <i>now</i>. I think my mind grows clearer, as my body dies away. I
  see&mdash;I see&mdash;there <i>is</i> God! Julia&mdash;there is an
  hereafter&mdash;an eternity&mdash;rest for the weary, joy for the woful! yes!
  yes! I see&mdash;I feel it. We shall meet, Julia. We shall meet, Paullus,
  Paullus!" And she sank back fainting and overpowered upon Julia's bosom.</p>

  <p>In a moment or two, however, she opened her eyes again, but it was clear
  that the spirit was on the point of taking its departure.</p>

  <p>"I am going!" she said in a very low voice. "I am going. His sword was
  more merciful than its master.&mdash;Bury me in a nameless grave. Let no
  stone tell the tale of unhappy, guilty Lucia. But come sometimes, Julia,
  Paullus, and look where I lie; and sometimes&mdash;will you not sometimes
  remember Lucia?"</p>

  <p>"You shall live in our souls forever!" replied Julia, stooping down to
  kiss her.</p>

  <p>"In your arms, Paullus, in your arms! will you not let me, Julia? 'Twere
  sweet to die in your arms, Paullus."&mdash;</p>

  <p>"How can you ask?" cried Julia, who scarce could speak for the tears and
  sobs, which almost choked her.</p>

  <p>"Here, Paullus, take her, gently, gently."</p>

  <p>"Oh! sweet&mdash;oh! happy!" she murmured, as she leaned her head against
  his heart, and fixed her glazing eyes upon his features, and clasped his hand
  with her poor dying fingers. "She told you, Paullus, that for your love I
  died to save her!"</p>

  <p>"She did&mdash;she did&mdash;dear, dearest Lucia!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Kiss me," she whispered; "I am going very fast. Kiss me on the brow,
  Paullus, where years ago you kissed me, when I was yet an innocent child."
  Then, fancying that he hesitated, she cried, "you will let him kiss me, now,
  will you not, Julia? He is yours"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Oh! kiss her, kiss her, Paullus," exclaimed Julia eagerly, "how could you
  fancy, Lucia, that I should wish otherwise? kiss her lips, not her brow,
  Paullus Arvina."</p>

  <p>"Kiss me first thou, dear Julia. I <i>may</i> call you dear."</p>

  <p>"Dear Lucia, dearest sister!"</p>

  <p>And the pure girl leaned over and pressed a long kiss on the cold lips of
  the unhappy, guilty, regenerated being, whose death had won for her honor,
  and life, and happiness.</p>

  <p>"Now, Paullus, now," cried Lucia, raising herself from his bosom by a last
  feeble effort, and stretching out her arms, "now, ere it be too
  late!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>He bowed down to her and kissed her lips, and she clasped her arms close
  about his neck, and returned that last chaste caress, murmuring "Paullus,
  mine own in death, mine own, own Paullus!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>There was a sudden rigor, a passing tremulous spasm, which ran through her
  whole frame for a moment&mdash;her arms clasped his neck more tightly than
  before, and then released their hold, all listless and unconscious&mdash;her
  head fell back, with the eyes glazed and visionless, and the white lips half
  open.</p>

  <p>"She is dead, Julia!" exclaimed Paullus, who was not ashamed to weep at
  that sad close of so young and sorrowful a life, "dead for our
  happiness!"</p>

  <p>"Hush! hush!" cried Julia, who was still gazing on the face of the
  dead&mdash;"There is a change&mdash;see! see! how beautiful, how
  tranquil!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>And in truth a sweet placid smile had settled about the pallid mouth, and
  nothing can be conceived more lovely than the calm, holy, pure expression
  which breathed from every lineament of the lifeless countenance.</p>

  <p>"She is gone, peace to her manes."</p>

  <p>"She is at rest, now, Paullus, she is happy!" murmured Julia. "How
  excellent she was, how true, how brave, how devoted! Oh! yes! I doubt not,
  she is happy."</p>

  <p>"The Gods grant it!" he replied fervently. "But I have yet a duty," and
  drawing his short straight sword he severed one long dark curl from the
  lifeless head, and raising it aloft in his left hand, while with the right he
  pointed heavenward the gleaming steel, "Ye Gods!" he cried, "supernal and
  infernal! and ye spirits and powers, shades of the mighty dead! Hear earth,
  and heaven, and thou Tartarus! by this good steel, by this right hand, in
  presence of this sacred dead, I swear, I devote Catiline and his hated head
  to vengeance! By this sword may he perish; may this hair be steeped in his
  lifeblood; may he know himself, when dying, the victim of my
  vengeance&mdash;may dogs eat his body&mdash;and his unburied spirit know
  neither Tartarus nor Elysium!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>It was strange, but as he ceased from that wild imprecation, a faint flash
  of lightning veined the remote horizon, and a low clap of thunder rumbled
  afar off, echoing among the hills&mdash;perchance the last of a storm,
  unheard before and unnoticed by the distracted minds of the spectators of
  that scene.</p>

  <p>But the superstitious Romans accepted it as an omen.</p>

  <p>"Thunder!"&mdash;cried one.</p>

  <p>"The Gods have spoken!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I hail the omen!" exclaimed Paullus, sheathing his sword, and thrusting
  the tress of hair into his bosom. "By my hand shall he perish!"</p>

  <p>And thenceforth, it was believed generally by the soldiers, that in the
  coming struggle Catiline was destined to fall, and by the hand of Paul
  Arvina.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch219"
     name="ch219"></a>XIX. &mdash; THE EVE OF BATTLE</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>Canst thou not minister to a mind
     diseased.</i> &mdash;Macbeth.</p><br>

  <p class="first">NEARLY a fortnight had elapsed since the rescue of Julia,
  and the sad death of Catiline's unhappy daughter, and yet the battle which
  was daily and hourly expected, had not been fought.</p>

  <p>With rare ability and generalship, Catiline had avoided an action with the
  troops of Antonius, marching and countermarching among the rugged passes of
  the Appennines, now toward Rome, now toward Gaul, keeping the enemy
  constantly on the alert, harassing the consul's outposts, threatening the
  city itself with an assault, and maintaining with studious skill that
  appearance of mystery, which is so potent an instrument whether to terrify or
  to fascinate the vulgar mind.</p>

  <p>During this period the celerity of his movements had been such that his
  little host appeared to be almost ubiquitous, and men knew not where to look
  for his descent, or how to anticipate the blow, which he evidently had it in
  contemplation to deliver.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, he had given such of his adherents as fled from Rome
  immediately on the execution of the conspirators, an opportunity to join him,
  and many had in fact done so with their clients, and bands of gladiators.</p>

  <p>The disaffected of the open country had all united themselves to him; and
  having commenced operations with a force not exceeding two thousand men, he
  was now at the head of six times that number, whom he had formed into two
  complete legions, and disciplined them with equal assiduity and success.</p>

  <p>Now, however, the time had arrived when it was for his advantage no longer
  to avoid an encounter with the troops of the commonwealth; for having gained
  all that he proposed to himself by his dilatory movements and Fabian policy,
  time namely for the concentration of his adherents, and opportunity to
  discipline his men, he now began to suffer from the inconveniences of the
  system.</p>

  <p>Unsupplied with magazines, or any regular supply of provisions, his army
  like a flight of locusts had stripped the country bare at every halting
  place, and that wild hill country had few resources, even when shorn by the
  licentious band of his desperadoes, upon which to support an army. The
  consequence, therefore, of his incessant hurrying to and fro, was that the
  valleys of the mountain chain which he had made the theatre of his campaign,
  were now utterly exhausted; that his beasts of burden were broken down and
  foundered; and that the line of his march might be traced by the carcasses of
  mules and horses which had given out by the wayside, and by the flights of
  carrion birds which hovered in clouds about his rear, prescient of the coming
  carnage.</p>

  <p>His first attempt was to elude Metellus Celer, who had marched down from
  the Picene district on the Adriatic sea, with great rapidity, and taken post
  at the foot of the mountains, on the head waters of the streams which flow
  down into the great plain of the Po.</p>

  <p>In this attempt he had been frustrated by the ability of the officer who
  was opposed to him, who had raised no less than three legions fully equipped
  for war.</p>

  <p>By him every movement of the conspirator was anticipated, and met by some
  corresponding measure, which rendered it abortive. Nor was it, any longer,
  difficult for him to penetrate the designs of Catiline, since the peasantry
  and mountaineers, who had throughout that district been favorable to the
  conspiracy in the first instance, and who were prepared to favor any design
  which promised to deliver them from inexorable taxation, had been by this
  time so unmercifully plundered and harassed by that banditti, that they were
  now as willing to betray Catiline to the Romans, as they had been desirous
  before of giving the Romans into his hands at disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Fully aware of all these facts, and knowing farther that Antonius had now
  come up so close to his rear, with a large army, that he was in imminent
  danger of being surrounded and taken between two fires, the desperate traitor
  suddenly took the boldest and perhaps the wisest measure.</p>

  <p>Wheeling directly round he turned his back toward Gaul, whither he had
  been marching, and set his face toward the city. Then making three great
  forced marches he came upon the army of Antonius, as it was in column of
  march, among the heights above Pistoria, and had there been daylight for the
  attack when the heads of the consul's cohorts were discovered, it is possible
  that he might have forced him to fight at disadvantage, and even defeated
  him.</p>

  <p>In that case there would have been no force capable of opposing him on
  that side Rome, and every probability would have been in favor of his making
  himself master of the city, a success which would have gone far to insure his
  triumph.</p>

  <p>It was late in the evening, however, when the hostile armies came into
  presence, each of the other, and on that account, and, perhaps, for another
  and stronger reason, Catiline determined on foregoing the advantages of a
  surprise.</p>

  <p>Caius Antonius, the consul in command, it must be remembered, had been one
  of the original confederates in Catiline's first scheme of massacre and
  conflagration, which had been defeated by the unexpected death of Curius
  Piso.</p>

  <p>Detached from the conspiracy only by Cicero's rare skill, and
  disinterested cession to him of the rich province of Macedonia, Antonius
  might therefore justly be supposed unlikely to urge matters to extremities
  against his quondam comrades; and it was probably in no small degree on this
  account that Catiline had resolved on trying the chances of battle rather
  against an old friend, than against an enemy so fixed, and of so resolute
  patrician principles as Metellus Celer.</p>

  <p>He thought, moreover, that it was just within the calculation of chances
  that Antonius might either purposely mismanoeuvre, so as to allow him to
  descend upon Rome without a battle, or adopt such tactics as should give him
  a victory.</p>

  <p>He halted his army, therefore, in a little gorge of the hills opening out
  upon a level plain, flanked on the left by the steep acclivities of the
  mountain, which towered in that direction, ridge above ridge, inaccessible,
  and on the right by a rugged and rocky spur, jutting out from the same ridge,
  by which his line of battle would be rendered entirely unassailable on the
  flanks and rear.</p>

  <p>In this wild spot, amid huge gray rocks, and hanging woods of ancient
  chesnuts and wild olive, as gray and hoary as the stones among which they
  grew, he had pitched his camp, and now lay awaiting in grim anticipation what
  the morrow should bring forth; while, opposite to his front, on a lower
  plateau of the same eminence, the great army of the consul might be descried,
  with its regular entrenchments and superb array of tents, its forests of
  gleaming spears, and its innumerable ensigns, glancing and waving in the cold
  wintry moonshine.</p>

  <p>The mind of the traitor was darker and more gloomy than its wont. He had
  supped with his officers, Manlius and a nobleman of Faesulae, whose name the
  historian has not recorded, who held the third rank in the rebel army, but
  their fare had been meagre and insipid, their wines the thin vintage of that
  hill country; a little attempt at festivity had been made, but it had failed
  altogether; the spirits of the men, although undaunted and prepared to dare
  the utmost, lacked all that fiery and enthusiastic ardor, which kindles
  patriot breasts with a flame so pure and pervading, on the eve of the most
  desperate encounters.</p>

  <p>Enemies of their country, enemies almost of mankind, these desperadoes
  were prepared to fight desperately, to fight unto the death, because to win
  was their only salvation, and, if defeated, death their only refuge.</p>

  <p>But for them there was no grand heart-elevating spur to action, no fame to
  be won, no deathless name to be purchased&mdash;their names deathless
  already, as they knew too well, through black infamy!&mdash;no grateful
  country's praises, to be gained cheaply by a soldier's death!&mdash;no! there
  were none of these things.</p>

  <p>All their excitements were temporal, sensual, earthy. The hope to conquer,
  the lust to bask in the sunshine of power, the desire to revel at ease in
  boundless luxury and riot.</p>

  <p>And against these, the rewards of victory, what were the penalties of
  defeat&mdash;death, infamy, the hatred and the scorn of ages.</p>

  <p>The wicked have no friends. Never, perhaps, was this fact exemplified more
  clearly than on that battle eve. Community of guilt, indeed, bound those
  vicious souls together&mdash;community of interests, of fears, of perils,
  held them in league&mdash;yet, feeling as they did feel that their sole
  chance of safety lay in the maintenance of that confederation, each looked
  with evil eyes upon his neighbor, each almost hated the others, accusing them
  internally of having drawn them into their present perilous peril, of having
  failed at need, or of being swayed by selfish motives only.</p>

  <p>So little truth there is in the principle, which Catiline had set forth in
  his first address to his banded parricides, "that the community of desires
  and dislikes constitutes, in one word, true friendship!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>And now so darkly did their destiny lower on those depraved and ruined
  spirits, that even their recklessness, that last light which emanates from
  crime in despair, had burned out, and the furies of conscience,&mdash;that
  conscience which they had so often stifled, so often laughed to scorn, so
  often drowned with riot and debauch, so often silenced by fierce
  sophistry&mdash;now hunted them, harpies of the soul, worse than the fabulous
  Eumenides of parricide Orestes.</p>

  <p>The gloomy meal was ended; the parties separated, all of them, as it would
  seem, relieved by the termination of those mock festivities which, while they
  brought no gayity to the heart, imposed a necessity of seeming mirthful and
  at ease, when they were in truth disturbed by dark thoughts of the past, and
  terrible forebodings of the future.</p>

  <p>As soon as his guests had departed and the traitor was left alone, he
  arose from his seat, according to his custom, and began to pace the room with
  vehement and rapid strides, gesticulating wildly, and muttering sentences,
  the terrible oaths and blasphemies of which were alone audible.</p>

  <p>Just at this time a prolonged flourish of trumpets from without, announced
  the changing of the watch. It was nine o'clock. "Ha! the third hour!"
  already, he exclaimed, starting as he heard the wild blast, "and Chaerea not
  yet returned from Antonius. Can it be that the dog freedman has played me
  false, or can Antonius have seized him as a hostage?&mdash;I will go forth,"
  he added, after a short pause, "I will go forth, and observe the night."</p>

  <p>And throwing a large cloak over his armor, and putting a broad-brimmed
  felt hat upon his head, in lieu of the high crested helmet, he sallied out
  into the camp, carrying in addition to his sword a short massive javelin in
  his right hand.</p>

  <p>The night was extremely dark and murky. The moon had not yet risen, and
  but for the camp-fires of the two armies, it would have been impossible to
  walk any distance without the aid of a torch or lantern. A faint lurid light
  was dispersed from these, however, over the whole sky, and thence was
  reflected weakly on the rugged and broken ground which lay between the
  entrenched lines of the two hosts.</p>

  <p>For a while, concealed entirely by his disguise, Catiline wandered through
  the long streets of tents, listening to the conversation of the soldiers
  about the watch-fires, their strange superstitious legends, and old
  traditionary songs; and, to say truth, the heart of that desperate man was
  somewhat lightened by his discovery that the spirits of the men were alert
  and eager for the battle, their temper keen and courageous, their confidence
  in the prowess and ability of their chief unbounded.</p>

  <p>"He is the best soldier, since the days of Sylla," said one gray-headed
  veteran, whose face was scarred by the Pontic scymetars of Mithridates.</p>

  <p>"He is a better soldier in the field, than ever Sylla was, by Hercules!"
  replied another.</p>

  <p>"Aye! in the field! Sylla, I have heard say, rarely unsheathed his sword,
  and never led his men to hand and hand encounter," interposed a younger man,
  than the old colonists to whom he spoke.</p>

  <p>"It is the head to plan, not the hand to execute, that makes the great
  captain. Caius, or Marcus, Titus or Tullus, can any one of them strike home
  as far, perhaps farther, than your Syllas or your Catilines."</p>

  <p>"By Mars! I much doubt it!" cried another. "I would back Catiline with
  sword and buckler against the stoutest and the deftest gladiator that ever
  wielded blade. He is as active and as strong as a Libyan tiger."</p>

  <p>"Aye! and as merciless."</p>

  <p>"May the foe find him so to-morrow!"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow, by the Gods! I wish it were to-morrow. It is cold work this,
  whereas, to-morrow night, I promise you, we shall be ransacking Antonius'
  camp, with store of choice wines, and rare viands."</p>

  <p>"But who shall live to share them is another question."</p>

  <p>"One which concerns not those who win."</p>

  <p>"And by the God of Battles! we will do that to-morrow, let who may fall
  asleep, and who may keep awake to tell of it."</p>

  <p>"A sound sleep to the slumberers, a merry rouse to the quick boys, who
  shall keep waking!" shouted another, and the cups were brimmed, and quaffed
  amid a storm of loud tumultuous cheering.</p>

  <p>Under cover of this tumult, Catiline withdrew from the neighborhood, into
  which he had intruded with the stealthy pace of the beast to which the
  soldiers had compared him; and as he retired, he muttered to
  himself&mdash;"They are in the right frame of mind&mdash;of the right stuff
  to win&mdash;and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;" he paused, and shook his head
  gloomily, as if he dared not trust his own lips to complete the sentence he
  had thus begun.</p>

  <p>A moment afterward he exclaimed&mdash;"But Chaerea! but Chaerea! how long
  the villain tarries! By heaven! I will go forth and meet him."</p>

  <p>And suiting the action to the word, he walked rapidly down the Quintana or
  central way to the Praetorian gate, there giving the word to the night-watch
  in a whisper, and showing his grim face to the half-astonished sentinel on
  duty, he passed out of the lines, alone and unguarded.</p>

  <p>After advancing a few paces, he was challenged again by the pickets of the
  velites, who were thrust out in advance of the gates, and again giving the
  word was suffered to pass on, and now stood beyond the farthest outpost of
  his army.</p>

  <p>Cautiously and silently, but with a swift step and determined air, he now
  advanced directly toward the front of the Roman entrenchments, which lay at a
  little more than a mile's distance from his own lines, and ere long reached a
  knoll or hillock which would by daylight have commanded a complete view of
  the whole area of the consul's camp, not being much out of a sling's cast
  from the ramparts.</p>

  <p>The camp of the consul lay on the slope of a hill, so that the rear was
  considerably higher than the front; Catiline's eye, as he stood on that
  little eminence, could therefore clearly discern all the different streets
  and divisions of the camp, by the long lines of lamps and torches which
  blazed along the several avenues, and he gazed anxiously and long, at that
  strange silent picture.</p>

  <p>With the exception of a slight clash and clang heard at times on the
  walls, where the skirmishers were going on their rounds, and the neigh of
  some restless charger, there was nothing that should have indicated to the
  ear that nearly twenty thousand men were sleeping among those tented lines of
  light&mdash;sleeping how many of them their last natural slumber.</p>

  <p>No thoughts of that kind, however, intruded on the mind of the
  desperado.</p>

  <p>Careless of human life, reckless of human suffering, he gazed only with
  his enquiring glance of profound penetration, hoping to espy something,
  whereby he might learn the fate&mdash;not of his messenger, that was to him a
  matter of supreme indifference&mdash;but of his message to Antonius.</p>

  <p>Nor was he very long in doubt on this head; for while he was yet gazing,
  there was a bustle clearly perceptible about the praetorium, lights were seen
  flitting to and fro, voices were heard calling and answering to one another,
  and then the din of hammers and sounds of busy preparation.</p>

  <p>This might have lasted perchance half an hour, to the great amazement of
  the traitor, who could not conceive the meaning of that nocturnal hubbub,
  when the clang of harness succeeded by the heavy regular tramp of men
  marching followed the turmoil, and, with many torches borne before them, the
  spears and eagle of a cohort were seen coming rapidly toward the Praetorian
  Gate.</p>

  <p>"By Hecate!" cried Catiline&mdash;"what may this mean, I wonder. They are
  too few for an assault, nay! even for a false alarm. They have halted at the
  gate! By the Gods! they are filing out! they march hitherward! and lo!
  Manlius is aware of them. I will risk something to tarry here and watch
  them."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the cohort marched forward, straight on the hillock where he
  stood; and so far was it from seeking to conceal its whereabout, that its
  trumpets were blown frequently and loudly, as if to attract observation.</p>

  <p>Meantime the camp of Catiline was on the alert also, the ramparts were
  lined with torches, by the red glare of which the legionaries might be seen
  mustering in dense array with shields in serried order, and spear heads
  twinkling in the torch-light.</p>

  <p>As the cohorts approached the hill, Catiline fell back toward his own camp
  a little, and soon found shelter in a small thicket of holleys and wild
  myrtle which would effectually conceal him from the enemy, while he could
  observe their every motion from its safe covert.</p>

  <p>On the hillock, the cohort halted&mdash;one manipule stood to its arms in
  front, while the rest formed a hollow square, all facing outward around its
  summit. The torches were lowered, so that with all his endeavors, Catiline
  could by no means discover what was in process within that guarded space.</p>

  <p>Again the din of hammers rose on his ear, mixed now with groans and
  agonizing supplications, which waxed at length into a fearful howl, the
  utterance of one, past doubt, in more than mortal agony.</p>

  <p>A strange and terrible suspicion broke upon Catiline, and the sweat
  started in beadlike drops from his sallow brow. It was not long ere that
  suspicion became certainty.</p>

  <p>The clang of the hammers ceased; the wild howls sank into a continuous
  weak pitiful wailing. The creak of pullies and cordage, the shouts of men
  plying levers, and hauling ropes, succeeded, and slowly sullenly uprose,
  hardly seen in the black night air, a huge black cross. It reached its
  elevation, and was made fast in almost less time than it has taken to relate
  it, and instantly a pile of faggots which had been raised a short distance in
  front if it, and steeped in oil or some other unctuous matter, was set on
  fire.</p>

  <p>A tall wavering snowwhite glare shot upward, and revealed, writhing in
  agony, and wailing wofully, the naked form of Chaerea, bleeding at every pore
  from the effects of the merciless Roman scourging, nailed on the fatal
  cross.</p>

  <p>So near was the little thicket in which Catiline lay, that he could mark
  every sinew of that gory frame working in agony, could read every twitch of
  those convulsed features.</p>

  <p>Again the Roman trumpets were blown shrill and piercing, and a centurion
  stepping forward a little way in front of the advanced manipule, shouted at
  the pitch of his voice,</p>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">"THUS PERISH ALL THE MESSENGERS OF PARRICIDES
     AND TRAITORS!"</p>

  <p>Excited, almost beyond his powers of endurance, by what he beheld and
  heard, the fierce traitor writhed in his hiding place, not sixty paces
  distant from the speaker, and gnashed his teeth in impotent malignity. His
  fingers griped the tough shaft of his massive pilum, as if they would have
  left their prints in the close-grained ash.</p>

  <p>While that ferocious spirit was yet strong within him, the wretched
  freedman, half frenzied doubtless by his tortures, lifted his voice in a wild
  cry on his master&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Catiline! Catiline!" he shrieked so thrillingly that every man in both
  camps heard every syllable distinct and clear. "Chaerea calls on Catiline.
  Help! save! Avenge! Catiline! Catiline!"</p>

  <p>A loud hoarse laugh burst from the Roman legionaries, and the centurion
  shouted in derision.</p>

  <p>But at that instant the desperate spectator of that horrid scene sprang to
  his feet reckless, and shouting, as he leaped into the circle of bright
  radiance,</p>

  <p>"Catiline hears Chaerea, and delivers,"&mdash;hurled his massive javelin
  with deadly aim at his tortured servant.</p>

  <p>It was the first blow Catiline ever dealt in mercy, and mercifully did it
  perform its errand.</p>

  <p>The broad head was buried in the naked breast of the victim, and with one
  sob, one shudder, the spirit was released from the tortured clay.</p>

  <p>Had a thunderbolt fallen among the cohort, the men could not have been
  more stunned&mdash;more astounded. Before they had sufficiently recovered
  from their shock to cast a missile at him, much less to start forth in
  pursuit, he was half way toward his own camp in safety; and ere long a
  prolonged burst, again and again reiterated, of joyous acclamations, told to
  the consular camp that the traitors knew and appreciated the strange and
  dauntless daring of their almost ubiquitous leader.</p>

  <p>An hour afterward that leader was alone, in his tent, stretched on his
  couch, sleeping. But oh! that sleep&mdash;not gentle slumber, not nature's
  soft nurse&mdash;but nature's horrible convulsion! The eyes wide open,
  glaring, dilated in their sockets as of a strangled man&mdash;the brow beaded
  with black sweat drops&mdash;the teeth grinded together&mdash;the white lips
  muttering words too horrible to be recorded&mdash;the talon-like fingers
  clutching at vacancy.</p>

  <p>It was too horrible to last. With a wild cry, "Lucia! Ha! Lucia! Fury!
  Avenger! Fiend!" he started to his feet, and glared around him with a
  bewildered eye, as if expecting to behold some ghastly supernatural
  visitant.</p>

  <p>At length, he said, with a shudder&mdash;which he could not repress, "It
  was a dream! A dream&mdash;but ye Gods! what a dream! I will sleep no
  more&mdash;'till to-morrow. To-morrow," he repeated in a doubtful and
  enquiring tone, "to-morrow. If I should fall to-morrow, and such dreams come
  in that sleep which hath no waking, those dreams should be reality&mdash;that
  reality should be&mdash;HELL! I know not&mdash;I begin to doubt some things,
  which of yore I held certain! What if there should be Gods! avenging,
  everlasting torturers! If there should be a HELL! Ha! ha!" he laughed wildly
  and almost frantically. "Ha! ha! what matters it? Methinks this is a hell
  already!" and with the words he struck his hand heavily on his broad breast,
  and relapsed into gloomy and sullen meditation.</p>

  <p>That night he slept no more, but strode backward and forward hour after
  hour, gnawing his nether lip till the blood streamed from the wounds
  inflicted by his unconscious teeth.</p>

  <p>What awful and mysterious retribution might await him in the land of
  spirits, it is not for mortals to premise; but in this at least did he speak
  truth that night&mdash;conscience and crime may kindle in the human heart a
  Hell, which nothing can extinguish, so long as the soul live identical
  self-knowing, self-tormenting.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch220"
     name="ch220"></a>XX. &mdash; THE FIELD OF PISTORIA</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,<br>
  Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.</i><br>
  &mdash;Macbeth.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE first faint streaks of day were scarcely visible in the
  east, when Catiline, glad to escape the horrors which he had endured through
  the dark solitude of the night watches, issued from his tent, armed at all
  points, and every inch a captain.</p>

  <p>All irresolution, all doubt, all nervousness had passed away. Energy and
  the strong excitement of the moment had overpowered conscience; and looking
  on his high, haughty port, his cold hard eye, his resolute impassive face,
  one would have said that man, at least, never trembled at realities, far less
  at shadows.</p>

  <p>But who shall say in truth, which are the shadows of this world, which the
  realities? Many a one, it may be, will find to his sorrow, when the great day
  shall come, that the hard, selfish, narrow fact, the reality after which his
  whole life was a chase, a struggle, is but the shadow of a shade; the
  unsubstantial good, the scholar's or the poet's dream, which he scorned as an
  empty nothing, is an immortal truth, an everlasting and immutable
  reality.</p>

  <p>Catiline shook at shadows, whom not the 'substance of ten thousand
  soldiers armed in proof,' could move, unless it were to emulation and
  defiance.</p>

  <p>Which were in truth more real, more substantial causes of dismay, those
  shadows which appalled him, or those realities which he despised.</p>

  <p>Ere that sun set, upon whose rising he gazed with an eye so calm and
  steadfast, that question, to him at least, was solved for ever&mdash;to us it
  is, perhaps, still a question.</p>

  <p>But, at that moment, he thought nothing of the past, nothing of the
  future. The present claimed his whole undivided mind, and to the present he
  surrendered it, abstracted from all speculations, clear and unclouded, and
  pervading as an eagle's vision.</p>

  <p>All his arrangements for the day had been made on the previous night so
  perfectly, that the troops were already filing out from the Praetorian gate
  in orderly array, and taking their ground on the little plain at the mouth of
  the gorge, in the order of battle which had been determined by the chiefs
  beforehand.</p>

  <p>The space which he had selected whereon to receive the attack of Antonius'
  army, was indeed admirably chosen. It front it was so narrow, that eight
  cohorts, drawn up in a line ten deep, according to the Roman usage, filled it
  completely; behind these, the twelve remaining cohorts, which completed the
  force of his two legions, were arrayed in reserve in denser and more solid
  order, the interval between the mountains on the left, and the craggy hill on
  the right, which protected his flanks, being much narrower as it ascended
  toward the gorge in which the rebel camp was pitched.</p>

  <p>In front of the army, there was a small plain, perfectly level, lying in
  an amphitheatre, as it were, of rocks and mountains, with neither thicket,
  brake, nor hillock to mar its smooth expanse or hinder the shock of armies,
  and extending perhaps half a mile toward the consular army. Below this, the
  ground fell off in a long abrupt and rugged declivity, somewhat exceeding a
  second half mile in length, with many thickets and clumps of trees on its
  slope, and the hillock at its foot, whereon still frowned Chaerea's cross
  with the gory and hideous carcase, already blackened by the frosty night
  wind, hanging from its rough timbers, an awful omen to that army of desperate
  traitors.</p>

  <p>Beyond that hillock, the ground swelled again into a lofty ridge, facing
  the mouth of the gorge in which Catiline had arrayed his army, with all
  advantages of position, sun and wind in his favor.</p>

  <p>The sun rose splendid and unclouded, and as his long rays streamed through
  the hollows in the mountain top, nothing can be conceived more wildly
  romantic than the mountain scene, more gorgeous and exciting than the living
  picture, which they illuminated.</p>

  <p>The hoary pinnacles of the huge mountains with their crowns of
  thunder-splintered rocks, the eyries of innumerable birds of prey, gleaming
  all golden in the splendors of the dawn&mdash;their long abrupt declivities,
  broken with crags, feathered with gray and leafless forests, and dotted here
  and there with masses of rich evergreens, all bathed in soft and misty
  light&mdash;and at the base of them the mouth of the deep gorge, a gulf of
  massive purple shadow, through which could be descried indistinctly the lines
  of the deserted palisades and ramparts, whence had marched out that mass of
  living valor, which now was arrayed in splendid order, just where the broad
  rays, sweeping down the hills, dwelt in their morning glory.</p>

  <p>Motionless they stood in their solid formation, as living statues, one
  mass, as it appeared, of gold and scarlet; for all their casques and shields
  and corslets were of bright burnished bronze, and all the cassocks of the
  men, and cloaks of the officers of the vivid hue, named from the flower of
  the pomegranate; so that, to borrow a splendid image of Xenophon describing
  the array of the ten thousand, the whole army lightened with brass, and
  bloomed with crimson.</p>

  <p>And now, from the camp in the rear a splendid train came sweeping at full
  speed, with waving crests of crimson horse-hair dancing above their gleaming
  helmets, and a broad banner fluttering in the air, under the well-known
  silver eagle, the tutelar bird of Marius, the God of the arch-traitor's
  sacrilegious worship.</p>

  <p>Armed in bright steel, these were the body guard of Catiline, three
  hundred chosen veterans, the clients of his own and the Cornelian houses, men
  steeped to the lips in infamy and crime, soldiers of fifty victories, Sylla's
  atrocious colonists.</p>

  <p>Mounted on splendid Thracian chargers, with Catiline at their head,
  enthroned like a conquering king on his superb black Erebus, they came
  sweeping at full gallop through the intervals of the foot, and, as they
  reached the front of the array, wheeled up at once into a long single line,
  facing their infantry, and at a single wafture of their leader's hand, halted
  all like a single man.</p>

  <p>Then riding forward at a foot's pace into the interval between the horse
  and foot, Catiline passed along the whole line from end to end, surveying
  every man, and taking in with his rapid and instinctive glance, every minute
  detail in silence.</p>

  <p>At the right wing, which Manlius commanded, he paused a moment or two, and
  spoke eagerly but shortly to his subordinate; but when he reached the extreme
  left he merely nodded his approbation to the Florentine, crying aloud in his
  deep tones the one word, "Remember!"</p>

  <p>Then gallopping back at the top of his horse's speed to the eagle which
  stood in front of the centre, he checked black Erebus so suddenly that he
  reared bolt upright and stood for a second's space pawing the vacant air,
  uncertain if he could recover that rude impulse. But the rare horsemanship of
  Catiline prevailed, and horse and man stood statue-like and immoveable.</p>

  <p>Then, pitching his voice so high and clear that every man of that dense
  host could hear and follow him, he burst abruptly into the spirited and
  stirring speech which has been preserved complete by the most elegant (35) of
  Roman writers.</p>

  <p class="footnote">35. Sallust.</p>

  <p>"Soldiers, I hold it an established fact, that words cannot give
  valor&mdash;that a weak army cannot be made strong, nor a coward army brave,
  by any speech of their commander. How much audacity is given to each man's
  spirit, by nature, or by habit, so much will be displayed in battle. Whom
  neither glory nor peril can excite, you shall exhort in vain. Terror deafens
  the ears of his intellect. I have convoked you, therefore, not to exhort, but
  to admonish you in brief, and to inform you of the causes of my counsel.
  Soldiers, you all well know how terrible a disaster the cowardice and sloth
  of Lentulus brought on himself and us; and how, expecting reinforcements from
  the city, I was hindered from marching into Gaul. Now I would have you
  understand, all equally with me, in what condition we are placed. The armies
  of our enemy, two in number, one from the city, the other from the side of
  Gaul, are pressing hard upon us. In this place, were it our interest to do
  so, we can hold out no longer, the scarcity of corn and forage forbid that.
  Whithersoever we desire to go, our path must be opened by the sword.
  Wherefore I warn you that you be of a bold and ready spirit; and, when the
  battle have commenced, that ye remember this, that in your own right hand ye
  carry wealth, honor, glory, moreover liberty and your country. Victorious,
  all things are safe to us, supplies in abundance shall be ours, the colonies
  and free boroughs will open their gates to us. Failing, through cowardice,
  these self-same things will become hostile to us. Not any place nor any
  friend shall protect him, whom his own arms have not protected. However,
  soldiers, the same necessity doth not actuate us and our enemies. We fight
  for our country, our liberty, our life! To them it is supererogatory to do
  battle for the power of a few nobles. Wherefore, fall on with the greater
  boldness, mindful of your own valor. We might all of us, have passed our
  lives in utter infamy as exiles; a few of you, stripped of your property,
  might still have dwelt in Rome, coveting that of your neighbors. Because
  these things appeared too base and foul for men's endurance, you resolved
  upon this career. If you would quit it, you must perforce be bold. No one,
  except victorious, hath ever exchanged war for peace. Since to expect safety
  from flight, when you have turned away from the foe, that armor which defends
  the body, is indeed madness. Always in battle to who most fears, there is
  most peril. Valor stands as a wall to shield its possessor. Soldiers, when I
  consider you, and recall to mind your deeds, great hopes of victory possess
  me. Your spirit, age, and valor, give me confidence; moreover that necessity
  of conquest, which renders even cowards brave. As for the numbers of the
  enemy, the defiles will not permit them to surround you. And yet, should
  Fortune prove jealous of your valor, beware that ye lose not your lives
  unavenged; beware that, being captured, ye be not rather butchered like
  sheep, than slain fighting like men, and leaving to your foes a victory of
  blood and lamentation."</p>

  <p>He ceased, and what a shout went up, seeming to shake the earth-fast hill,
  scaring the eagles from their high nests, and rolling in long echoes, like
  reverberated thunder among the resounding hills. Twice, thrice, that soul
  fraught acclamation pealed up to heaven, sure token of resolution unto death,
  in the hardened hearts of that desperate banditti.</p>

  <p>Catiline drank delighted inspiration from the sound, and cried in
  triumphant tones:</p>

  <p>"Enough! your shout is prophetic! Soldiers, already we have
  conquered!"</p>

  <p>Then leaping from his charger to the ground, he turned to his body-guard,
  exclaiming,</p>

  <p>"To fight, my friends, we have no need of horses; to fly we desire them
  not! On foot we must conquer, or on foot die! In all events, our peril as our
  hope must be equal. Dismount then, all of ye, and leading your chargers to
  the rear slay them; so shall we all run equal in this race of death or
  glory!"</p>

  <p>And, with the word, leading his superb horse through the intervals between
  the cohorts of the foot, he drew his heavy sword, and smote him one
  tremendous blow which clove through spine and muscle, through artery and vein
  and gullet, severing the beauteous head from the graceful and swanlike neck,
  and hurling the noble animal to the earth a motionless and quivering
  mass.</p>

  <p>It was most characteristic of the ruthless and brutal temper of that
  parricidal monster, that he cut down the noble animal which had so long and
  so gallantly borne him, which had saved his life more than once by its speed
  and courage, which followed him, fed from his hand, obeyed his voice, like a
  dog, almost like a child, without the slightest show of pity or
  compunction.</p>

  <p>Many bad, cruel, savage-hearted men, ruthless to their own fellows, have
  proved themselves not devoid altogether of humanity by their love to some
  faithful animal, but it would seem that this most atrocious of mankind lacked
  even the "one touch of nature which makes the whole world kin."</p>

  <p>He killed his favorite horse, the only friend, perhaps, that he possessed
  on earth, not only unreluctant, but with a sort of savage glee, and a
  sneering jest&mdash;</p>

  <p>"If things go ill with us to day, I shall be fitly horsed on Erebus, by
  Hades!"</p>

  <p>Then, hurrying to the van, he took post with his three hundred, and all
  the picked centurions and veterans of the reserve, mustered beneath the
  famous Cimbric Eagle, in the centre of the first rank, prepared to play out
  to the last his desperate and deadly game, the ablest chief, and the most
  daring soldier, that ever buckled blade for parricide and treason.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch221"
     name="ch221"></a>XXI. &mdash; THE BATTLE</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>At least we'll die with harness on our
     back.</i> &mdash;Macbeth.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT was indeed time that the last arrangements of the traitor
  were completed; for, long since, from the gates of the Consular camp the
  great army of the enemy had been filing out, and falling into order, not a
  mile distant.</p>

  <p>One third, at least, superior to the rebel host in numbers, the loyal
  soldiers were as high in spirit, as firm in resolution; were better armed,
  better officered, and, above all, strong in a better cause.</p>

  <p>Nor if those had the incentive of despair to spur them to great deeds, did
  these lack a yet stronger stimulus to action. There were bright eyes, and
  fair forms in their camp, dependent on their victory for life, and, yet
  dearer, honor. So great was the terror spread through those regions by the
  name of Catiline, and by the outrages committed already by his barbarous
  banditti, that all the female nobility of the provinces, wherein the war was
  waging, had fled to the Roman camp, as to their only place of safety.</p>

  <p>For all that district was ripe for insurrection; the borough towns awaited
  only the first sunshine of success, to join the rebellion; the rural slaves
  were, to a man, false at heart; and it was evident to all that the slightest
  check of the Consular forces would be the signal for tumult, massacre, and
  conflagration in the provincial towns, for all the horrors of a servile
  rising in the champaign.</p>

  <p>Flight to Rome was impossible, since all the villainy and desperate crime
  of the land was afloat, and every where, beyond the outposts of Antonius'
  head quarters, the roads were infested with banditti, runaway slaves, and
  rustic robbers.</p>

  <p>To the camp, therefore, had all the patricians of the district flocked,
  the men as volunteers, with such of their clients as they could trust, and
  such of their wealth as was portable; the women as suppliants, tearful and
  terrified, for Rome's powerful protection.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, for leagues around, by day the open country was seen blackened
  by numberless columns of smoke, by night flashing with numberless pyres of
  flame, the blaze of country seats and villas; and terror was on all sides,
  murder and rape, havoc and desolation.</p>

  <p>The minds of the Roman soldiery were inflamed, therefore, to the utmost;
  the sight of the ravaged country, the charms, the tears, the terrors of the
  suppliant ladies, had kindled all that was patriotic, all that was generous,
  all that was manly in their nature; and it was with deep-recorded vows of
  vengeance that they had buckled on their armor, and grinded their thirsty
  swords for the conflict.</p>

  <p>But throughout all that ardent host there was not one so determined, so
  calm in his resolved ire, so deadly bent on vengeance, as Paullus Arvina.</p>

  <p>Julia was in the camp; for no means had occurred of sending her to Rome in
  safety, and her high counsels, her noble feminine courage, would have given
  birth alone to contagious valor in her lover's spirit, had he been weak and
  faltering as of old between his principles and his passions.</p>

  <p>But it was not so. The stern trials to which his constancy had been
  subjected, the fearful strife of the hottest passions which had raged so long
  in his bosom, had hardened him like steel thrice tempered in the furnace, and
  he was now no longer the impulsive, enthusiastic, changeful stripling, in
  whom to-day's imagination swept away yesterday's resolve, but a cool,
  resolute, thoughtful man.</p>

  <p>It is events, not years, which make men old or young. It is adversity and
  trial, not ease and prosperity, which make men, from dwarfs, giants.</p>

  <p>And events had so crowded on the boy in the last few months, that those
  months had matured his wisdom more than all the years of his previous life.
  Adversity and trial had so swelled his mental stature, that aged men might
  have been proud to cope with him in counsel, strong men to rival him in
  execution.</p>

  <p>The sun was already high in heaven, when the cavalry of the seventh
  legion, which had been selected to act as the general's escort, in addition
  to the Praetorian cohort of infantry, swept forth from the gates, following
  Petreius, who, although holding the second rank only in the army, was
  actually in command; Antonius, on the pretext of a fit of the gout, having
  declined to lead that day.</p>

  <p>The men were already marshalled at the base of the ascent, leading to the
  narrow plain on which, as in the amphitheatre, the fight was to be fought out
  hand to hand, with little room for generalship, or intricate manoeuvring, but
  every opportunity for the display of mortal strength and desperate
  gallantry.</p>

  <p>Here they had halted, on the verge of the broken ground, awaiting the
  arrival of their general in chief to reform their array, and complete their
  preparations, before advancing to the attack.</p>

  <p>The lines of the enemy were concealed from them by the abrupt acclivity,
  and the level space on the top of the plateau, which intervened between the
  hosts; and it seemed probable that an officer of Catiline's intuitive eye and
  rapid resource, would not fail to profit by the difficulties of the ground,
  in order to assail the consular troops while struggling among the rocks and
  thickets which encumbered the ascent. It behoved, therefore, to hold the men
  well in hand, to fortify the heads of the advancing columns with the best
  soldiers, and to be ready with reinforcements at all points; and to this end
  Petreius had ordered a brief halt, before attacking.</p>

  <p>So eager were the spirits of the men, however, and so hot for the
  encounter, that they were murmuring already almost angrily, and calling on
  their centurions and tribunes to lead them at once to the shock.</p>

  <p>The fierce acclamations of the rebels, consequent on the address of
  Catiline, had kindled not daunted the brave indignation which possessed them;
  and stung, as it were, by some personal insult, each soldier of the array
  burned to be at it.</p>

  <p>So stood the case, when, escorted by the magnificent array of the
  legionary horse, Petreius gallopped through the ranks. A military man, by
  habit as by nature, who had served for more than thirty years as tribune,
  praefect of allies, commander of a legion, and lastly praetor, all with
  exceeding great distinction, he knew nearly all the men in his ranks by
  sight, was acquainted with their services and honors, had led them oftentimes
  to glory, and was their especial favorite.</p>

  <p>He made no set speech, therefore, to his legions, but as he gallopped
  through the lines called to this man or that by name, bidding him recollect
  this skirmish, or think upon that storm, fight, as he did in this pitched
  battle, or win a civic crown as in that sally, and finally shouted to them
  all in a high voice, entreating them to remember that they were Roman
  soldiers, fighting against a rabble of unarmed banditti, for their country,
  their wives, their children, their hearths and their altars.</p>

  <p>One full-mouthed shout replied to his brief address.</p>

  <p>"Lead on! Petreius, we will conquer!"</p>

  <p>He waved his hand toward the trumpeters, and nodded his high crested
  helmet; and instant there pealed forth that thrilling brazen clangor, "that
  bids the Romans close."</p>

  <p>Nor less sonorously did the war music of the rebels make reply, ringing
  among the hills their bold defiance.</p>

  <p>Then onward rolled that bright array, with a long steady sweep, like that
  of an unbroken line of billows rushing in grand and majestical upon some
  sandy cape.</p>

  <p>In vain did the sinuosities of the broken ground, in vain did crag and
  thicket, ravine and torrents' bed impede their passage; closing their files
  or serrying them, as the nature of the ascent required, now wheeling into
  solid column, deploying now into extended line, still they rolled onward,
  unchecked, irresistible&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">A long array of helmets bright,<br>
  A long array of spears.</p><br>

  <p>The glorious eagles glittered above them in the unclouded sunshine, the
  proud initials, which had gleamed from their crimson banners over one half
  the world, shone out conspicuous, SPQR, as the broad folds streamed to their
  length upon the frosty air.</p>

  <p>A solitary trumpet spoke at times, to order their slow terrible advance;
  there was no hum of voices, no shout, no confusion; only the solemn and
  continuous tramp of their majestic march, shaking the earth like an incessant
  roll of thunder&mdash;only the clang of their brazen harness, as buckler
  clashed with buckler.</p>

  <p>All the stern discipline, all the composed and orderly manoeuvres, all the
  cold steadiness of modern war was there, combined with all the gorgeousness
  and glitter of the chivalric ages.</p>

  <p>Contrary to all expectation, no opposition met them as they scaled that
  abrupt hill side. Fearful of exposing his flanks, Catiline wisely held his
  men back, collecting all their energies for the dread onset.</p>

  <p>In superb order, regular and even, Petreius' infantry advanced upon the
  plateau, their solid front filling the whole space with a mass of brazen
  bucklers, ten deep, and thrice ten hundred wide, without an interval, or
  break, or bend in that vast line.</p>

  <p>Behind these came the cavalry, about a thousand strong, and the Praetorian
  cohort, with the general in person, forming a powerful reserve, whereby he
  proposed to decide the day, so soon as the traitors should be shaken by his
  first onset.</p>

  <p>Once more the line was halted; once more Petreius gallopped to the van;
  and passed from left to right across the front, reconnoitering the
  dispositions of the enemy. Then taking post, at the right, he unsheathed his
  broadsword, and waved it slowly in the air, pointing to the impassive ranks
  of Catiline.</p>

  <p>Then the shrill trumpets flourished once again, and the dense mass bore
  onward, steady and slow, the enemy still motionless and silent, until scarce
  sixty yards intervened between the steadfast ranks, and every man might
  distinguish the features and expression of his personal antagonist.</p>

  <p>There was a pause. No word was given. No halt ordered. But intuitively, as
  if by instinct, every man stopped, and drew a deep breath, unconscious that
  he did so, collecting himself for the dread struggle.</p>

  <p>The point was reached, from which it was customary to hurl the tremendous
  volley of ponderous steel-headed pila, which invariably preceded the sword
  charge of the legions, and for the most part threw the first rank of the
  enemy into confusion, and left them an easy conquest to the short stabbing
  sword, and sturdy buckler.</p>

  <p>But now not a javelin was raised on either side&mdash;the long stern swell
  of the trumpets, ordering the charge, was drowned by a deep solemn shout,
  which pealed wilder and higher yet into a terrible soul-stirring cheer; and
  casting down their heavy missiles, both fronts rushed forward simultaneously,
  with their stout shields advanced, and their short broadswords levelled to
  the charge.</p>

  <p>From flank to flank, they met simultaneous, with a roar louder than that
  of the most deafening thunder, a shock that made the earth tremble, the
  banners flap upon their staves, the streams stand still, as if an earthquake
  had reeled under them.</p>

  <p>Then rose the clang of blades on helm and buckler, clear, keen, incessant;
  and charging shouts and dying cries, and patriotic acclamations, and mad
  blasphemies; and ever and anon the piercing clangor of the screaming brass,
  lending fresh frenzy to the frantic tumult.</p>

  <p>From right to left, the plain was one vast arena full of single
  combats&mdash;the whole first ranks on both sides had gone down at the first
  shock; the second and the third had come successively to hand to hand
  encounter; and still, as each man fell, stabbed to death by the pitiless
  sword, another leaped into his place; and still the lines, though bent on
  each side and waving like a bow, were steadfast and unbroken; and still the
  clang of brazen bucklers and steel blades rang to the skies, rendering all
  commands, all words, inaudible.</p>

  <p>Officers fought like privates; skirmishers, hand to hand, like
  legionaries. Blood flowed like water; and so fierce was the hatred of the
  combatants, so deadly the nature of the tremendous stabbing broadswords of
  the Romans, that few wounds were inflicted, and few men went down 'till they
  were slain outright.</p>

  <p>The dust stood in a solid mass over the reeling lines; nor could the wind,
  though it blew freshly, disperse the dense wreaths, so constantly did they
  surge upward from the trampling feet of those inveterate gladiators. At
  times, the waving of a banner would be seen, at times a gleamy brazen
  radiance, as some rank wheeled forward, or was forced back in some desperate
  charge; but, for the most part, all was dim and dark, and the battle still
  hung balanced.</p>

  <p>Wherever the fight was the fiercest, there rang the warshout "Catiline!
  Catiline!" to the darkened skies; and there ever would the Roman army waver,
  so furiously did he set on with his best soldiers, still bringing up reserves
  to the weakest points of his army, still stabbing down the fiercest of the
  consular host, fearless, unwearied, and unwounded.</p>

  <p>But his reserves were now all engaged, and not one point of the Roman line
  was broken; Manlius had fallen in the front rank, playing a captain's and a
  soldier's part. The Florentine had fallen in the front rank, battling with
  gallantry worthy a better cause. All the most valiant officers, all the best
  veterans had fallen, in the first rank, all with their faces to the foe, all
  with their wounds in front, all lying on the spot which they had held living,
  grim-visaged, and still terrible in death.</p>

  <p>"Paullus Arvina!" exclaimed Petreius, at this juncture, after having
  observed the equal strife long and intently, and having discerned with the
  eagle eye of a general's instinct what had escaped all those around him, that
  Catiline's last reserves were engaged. "The time is come; ride to the tribune
  of the horse, and bid him dismount his men. Horse cannot charge here! command
  the tribune of the Praetorian cohort to advance! We will strike full at the
  centre!"</p>

  <p>"I go, Petreius!" and bowing his head, till his crimson crest mingled with
  his charger's mane, he spurred furiously to the rear, and had delivered his
  message and returned, while the shouts, with which the reserve had greeted
  the command to charge, were yet ringing in the air.</p>

  <p>When he returned, the general had dismounted, and one of his freedmen was
  unbuckling the spurs from his steel greaves. His sword was out, and it was
  evident that he was about to lead the last onset in person.</p>

  <p>"A boon, noble Petreius!" cried the youth, leaping from his
  horse&mdash;"By all the Gods! By all your hopes of glory! grant me one boon,
  Petreius."</p>

  <p>"Ha! what?" returned the general quickly&mdash;"Speak out, be
  brief&mdash;what boon?"</p>

  <p>"Be it mine to head the charge!"</p>

  <p>"Art thou so greedy of fame, boy; or so athirst to die!"</p>

  <p>"So greedy of Revenge, Petreius. I have a vow in Heaven, and in Hell, to
  slay that parricide. If he should die by any hand but mine, I am forsworn and
  infamous!"</p>

  <p>"Thou, boy, and to slay Catiline!"</p>

  <p>"Even I, Petreius."</p>

  <p>"Thou art mad to say it."</p>

  <p>"Not mad, not mad, indeed, Petreius&mdash;."</p>

  <p>"He <i>will</i> slay him, Petreius," cried an old veteran of Arvina's
  troop. "The Gods thundered when he swore it. We all heard it. Grant his
  prayer, General; we will back him to the death. But be sure, he will slay
  him."</p>

  <p>"Be it so," said Petreius, struck despite himself by the confidence of the
  youth, and the conviction of the veterans. "Be it so, if ye will. But,
  remember, when we have broken through the centre, wheel to the right with the
  dismounted horse&mdash;the Praetorians must charge to the left. Ho! we are
  all in line. Forward! Ho! Victory, and Rome!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>And with the word, he rushed forward, himself a spear's length in front of
  his best men, who, with a long triumphant shout, dashed after him.</p>

  <p>Passing right through the wearied troops, who had sustained the shock and
  brunt of the whole day, and who now opened their ranks gladly to admit the
  reinforcement, these fresh and splendid soldiers fell like a thunderbolt upon
  the centre of Catiline's army, weakened already by the loss of its best men;
  and clove their way clean through it, solid and unbroken, trampling the dead
  and dying under foot, and hurling a small body of the rebels, still combating
  in desperation, into the trenches of their camp, wherein they perished to a
  man refusing to surrender, and undaunted.</p>

  <p>Then, wheeling to the left and right, they fell on the naked flanks of the
  reeling and disordered mass, while the troops whom they had relieved,
  re-forming themselves rapidly, pressed forward with tremendous shouts of
  victory, eager to share the triumph which their invincible steadiness had
  done so much to win.</p>

  <p>It was a battle no longer; but a route; but a carnage. Yet still not one
  of the rebels turned to fly; not one laid down his arms, or cried for
  quarter.</p>

  <p>Broken, pierced through, surrounded, overwhelmed by numbers, they fought
  in single lines, in scattered groups, in twos or threes, back to back,
  intrepid to the last, and giving mortal wounds in their extreme agony.</p>

  <p>More of the consular troops fell, after the field was won, than during all
  the previous combat. No lances, no long weapons, no missiles were at hand,
  wherewith to overwhelm the desperadoes; no horse wherewith to tread them
  under foot; hand to hand, man to man, it was fought out, with those short
  stabbing blades, against which the stoutest corslet was but as parchment, the
  hardest shield of brass-bound bull's hide, but as a stripling's wicker
  target.</p>

  <p>Still in the front, abreast still with the bravest veterans shouting
  himself hoarse with cries of "To me! to me, Catiline, to me, Paul Arvina!"
  The young man had gone through the whole of that dreadful melee; striking
  down a man at every blow, and filling the soldiers' mouths with wonder at the
  boy's exploits&mdash;he had gone through it all, without a scratch,
  unwounded.</p>

  <p>More than once had his mortal enemy been almost within arm's length of
  him; their eyes had glared mutual hatred on each other, their blades had
  crossed once, but still the throng and rush of combatants and flyers had
  forced them asunder; and now the strife was almost ended, the tide of
  slaughter had receded toward the rebel camp, the ramparts of which the
  legionaries were already storming.</p>

  <p>Weary and out of breath and disappointed, Paullus Arvina halted alone,
  among piles of the dying and the dead, with groans and imprecations in his
  ears, and bitterness and vexation at his heart.</p>

  <p>His comrades had rushed away on the track of the retreating rebels; and
  their shouts, as they stormed the palisades, reached him, but failed to awake
  any respondent note of triumph in his spirit.</p>

  <p>He had no share in the vulgar victory, he cared not to strike down and
  slaughter the commoners of the rebellion. Catiline was the quarry at which he
  flew, and with no game less noble could he rest contented. Catiline, it would
  seem, had escaped him for the moment; and he stood leaning on his red sword,
  doubtful.</p>

  <p>Instinctively he felt assured that his enemy had not retreated. Almost he
  feared that his death had crowned some other hand with glory.</p>

  <p>When suddenly, a mighty clatter arose in the rear, toward the Roman camp,
  and turning swiftly toward the sound, he perceived a desperate knot of rebels
  still charging frantically onward, although surrounded by thrice their
  numbers of inveterate and ruthless victors.</p>

  <p>"By the Gods! he is there!" and with the speed of the hunted deer, he
  rushed toward the spot, bounding in desperate haste over the dying and the
  dead, blaspheming or unconscious.</p>

  <p>He reached the mle. He dashed headlong into the thick of it. The Romans
  were giving way before the fury of a gory madman, as he seemed, who bore down
  all that met him at the sword's point.</p>

  <p>"Catiline! Catiline!" and at the cry, the boldest of the consular army
  recoiled. "Ho!&mdash;Romans! Ho! who will slay Sergius Catiline? Ho! Romans!
  Ho! His head is worth the winning! Who will slay Sergius Catiline?"</p>

  <p>And, still at every shout, he struck down, and stabbed, and maimed, and
  trampled, even amid defeat and ruin victorious, unsubdued, a terror to his
  victors.</p>

  <p>"Who will slay Sergius Catiline?"</p>

  <p>And, as Arvina rushed upon the scene, the veteran who had so confidently
  announced his coming triumph, crossed swords with the traitor, and went down
  in a moment, stabbed a full span deep in his thigh.</p>

  <p>"Ho! Romans! Ho! who will slay Sergius Catiline?"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Paullus Arvina!"&mdash;cried the youth, springing forward, and dealing
  him with the word a downright blow upon the head, which cleft his massive
  casque asunder.</p>

  <p>"I will! I, even I, Paullus Arvina!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>But he shouted too soon; and soon rued the imprudence of raising his arm
  to strike, when at sword's point with such a soldier.</p>

  <p>As his own blow fell on the casque of the traitor, <i>his</i> shortened
  blade, aimed with a deadly thrust tore through the sturdy shield, tore
  through the strong cuirass, and pierced his side with a ghastly wound.</p>

  <p>Arvina staggered&mdash;he thought he had received his death blow; and had
  not the blade of Catiline, bent by the violence of his own effort, stuck in
  the cloven shield, resisting every attempt to withdraw it, the next blow must
  have found him unprepared, must have destroyed him.</p>

  <p>But ere the desperado could recover his weapon, Arvina rallied and closed
  with him, grasping him by the throat, and shouting "Lucia!
  Vengeance!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>Brave as he was and strong, not for a single moment could Arvina have
  maintained that death-grapple, had his foe been unwounded.</p>

  <p>But the arch traitor was bleeding at every pore; gashed in every limb of
  his body; he had received three mortal wounds already; he was fast failing
  when Arvina grappled him, and at the name of his injured child, his
  conscience conquered. His sword at length came away, extricated when too late
  from the tough bull-hide; but, ere he could nerve his arm to strike again,
  Arvina's point had torn his thigh, had gored his breast, had pierced his
  naked throat, with three wounds, the least of them mortal.</p>

  <p>But even in that agony he struck home! He could not even curse, but he
  struck home, and a fierce joyous smile illuminated his wan face, as he saw
  his slayer stumble forward, and fall beside him on the bloody greensward.</p>

  <p>In a moment, however, Paullus rallied, recovered his feet, drew from his
  bosom the long black ringlet of poor Lucia, and bathed it in the life blood
  of her slayer.</p>

  <p>"Lucia! Ho! Lucia! Rejoice! my vow, my vow is kept! Thou art avenged,
  avenged! Ah! Lucia!&mdash;Julia!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>And he fell sick and swooning upon the yet living bleeding body of his
  mortal foeman.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch222"
     name="ch222"></a>XXII. &mdash; A NIGHT OF HORROR</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center"><i>Rider and horse, friend, foe, in one red
     burial blent</i>. &mdash;Childe Harold.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE battle was at an end; the sun had set; the calm and
  silvery moon was sailing through the azure skies; as peaceful as though her
  pure light shone upon sights of happiness alone, and quiet. The army of the
  commonwealth had returned to their camp victorious, but in sadness, not
  triumph.</p>

  <p>Of the magnificent array, which had marched out that morning from the
  Praetorian gate, scarce two-thirds had returned at sun-set.</p>

  <p>And the missing were the best, the bravest, the most noble of the host;
  for all the most gallant had fallen dead in that desperate struggle, or had
  sunk down faint, with wounds and bloodshed, beside the bodies of their
  conquered foemen.</p>

  <p>Of the rebels there was not a remnant left; some had escaped from that
  dread route; and of that mighty power, which at the close of day was utterly
  exterminated, it is on record that neither in the combat, while it lasted,
  nor in the slaughter which followed it, was any free born citizen
  taken&mdash;a living captive.</p>

  <p>For the numbers engaged on both sides it is probable that never in the
  annals of the world was there the like carnage; nor is this wonderful, when
  the nature of the ground, which rendered flight almost impossible to the
  vanquished, the nature of the weapons, which rendered almost every wound
  surely mortal, and the nature of the strife, which rendered the men of either
  party pitiless and desperate, are all taken into consideration.</p>

  <p>In long ranks, like grass in the mower's swathes, the rebel warriors lay,
  with their grim faces, and glazed eyes, set in that terrible expression of
  ferocity which is always observed on the lineaments of those who have died
  from wounds inflicted by a stabbing weapon; and under them, or near them, in
  ghastly piles were heaped, scarce less in number, the corpses of their
  slaughtered conquerors. So equal was the havoc; so equal the value which the
  men had set on their own lives, and on those of their enemies.</p>

  <p>Never perhaps had there been such, or so signal, a retribution. They who
  had taken to the sword had perished by the sword, not figuratively but in the
  literal meaning of the words. Stabbers by trade, they had fallen stabbed, by
  the hands of those whom they had destined to like massacre.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the five chiefs who had already wrestled out their
  dark spirits, in the Tullianum, slavishly strangled, there was no traitor
  slain save by the steel blade's edge.</p>

  <p>The field of Pistoria was the tribunal, the ruthless sword the judge and
  executioner, by which to a man the conspirators expiated their atrocious
  crimes.</p>

  <p>No chains, no scaffolds followed that tremendous field. None had survived
  on whom to wreak the vengeance of the state. Never was victory so complete or
  final.</p>

  <p>But in that victory there was no triumph, no joy, no glory to the
  victors.</p>

  <p>So long, and so desperate had been the battle, so furiously contested the
  series of single combats into which it was resolved, after the final and
  decisive charge of the Praetorian cohort, that the shades of the early winter
  night were already falling over the crimson field, when, weak and shattered,
  sorrowful and gloomy, the Roman host was recalled by the wailing notes of the
  brazen trumpets from that tremendous butchery.</p>

  <p>The watches were set, as usual, and the watch fires kindled; but no shouts
  of the exulting soldiers were to be heard hailing their general "Imperator;"
  no songs of triumph pealed to the skies in honor of the great deeds done, the
  deathless glory won; no prizes of valor were distributed; no
  triumph&mdash;not an oration even&mdash;was to be hoped for by the victorious
  leader of that victorious host, which had conquered indeed for the liberties
  of Rome, but had conquered, not on foreign earth, in no legitimate warfare,
  against no natural foe, but on the very soil of the republic, at the very
  gates of Rome, in an unnatural quarrel, against Romans, citizens, and
  brothers.</p>

  <p>The groans of the wounded, the lamentations of friends, the shrieks of
  women, went up the livelong night from that woful camp. To hear that grievous
  discord, one would have judged it rather the consequences of defeat than of
  victory, however sad and bloody.</p>

  <p>No words can express the anguish of the ladies, with whom the camp was
  crowded, as rushing forth to meet the returning legions, they missed the
  known faces altogether, or met them gashed and pallid, borne home, perhaps to
  die after long suffering, upon the shields under which they had so boldly
  striven.</p>

  <p>Enquiries were fruitless. None knew the fate of his next neighbor, save in
  so much as this, that few of those who went down in such a mle, could be
  expected ever again to greet the sunrise, or hail the balmy breath of
  morning.</p>

  <p>Averted heads and downcast eyes, were the sole replies that met the wives,
  the mothers, the betrothed maidens, widowed ere wedded, as with rent
  garments, and dishevelled hair, and streaming eyes, they rushed into the
  sorrowful ranks, shrieking, "Where are they," and were answered only by the
  short echo, "Where."</p>

  <p>Such was the fate of Julia. No one could tell her aught of her Arvina;
  until at a late hour of the night, remembering her solitary situation and
  high birth, and taking a deep interest in her sorrows, Petreius himself
  visited her, not to instil false hope, but to console if possible her wounded
  spirit by praises of her lost lover's conduct.</p>

  <p>"He fought beside my right hand, Julia, through the whole of that deadly
  struggle; and none with more valor, or more glory. He led the last bloody
  onset, and was the first who cut his way through the rebel centre. Julia, you
  must not weep for him, you must not envy him such glory. Julia, he was a
  hero."</p>

  <p>"<i>Was</i>!" replied the poor girl, with clasped hands and streaming
  eyes&mdash;"then he <i>is</i> no longer?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know, but fear it," said the stout soldier; "He had vowed
  himself to slay Catiline with his own hands. Such vows are not easy, Julia,
  nor safe of performance."</p>

  <p>"And Catiline?" asked Julia,&mdash;"the parricide&mdash;the monster?"</p>

  <p>"Has not survived the strife. None of the traitors have survived it,"
  replied Petreius. "But how he fell, or where, as yet we know not."</p>

  <p>"Paullus hath slain him! my own, my noble Paullus."</p>

  <p>"I think so, Julia," answered the general.</p>

  <p>"I know it," she said slowly&mdash;"but what availeth that to me&mdash;to
  me who had rather hear one accent of his noble voice, meet one glance of his
  glorious eye&mdash;alas! alas! my Paullus! my Lord! my Life! But I will not
  survive him!"</p>

  <p>"Hold, Julia, hold! I would not nurse you to false hopes, but he may yet
  be living; many are wounded doubtless, who shall be saved to-
  morrow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow?" she exclaimed, a gleam of hope bursting upon her soul, like
  the dayspring. "Why not to-night?&mdash;Petreius, I say, why not to-
  night?"</p>

  <p>"It is impossible. The men are all worn out with wounds and weariness, and
  must have daylight to the task. Dear girl, it is impossible."</p>

  <p>"I will go forth myself, alone, unaided, I will save him."</p>

  <p>"You must not, Julia."</p>

  <p>"Who shall prevent me? Who dare to part a betrothed maiden from her true
  lover,&mdash;true, alas! in death! in death!"</p>

  <p>"I will," replied Petreius firmly. "You know not the perils of such a
  night as this. The gaunt wolves from the Appennines; the foul and carrion
  vultures; the plundering disbanded soldiers; the horrid unsexed women, who
  roam the field of blood more cruel than the famished wolf, more sordid than
  the loathsome vulture. I will prevent you, Julia. But with the earliest dawn
  to-morrow I will myself go with you. Fare you well, try to sleep, and hope,
  hope for the best, poor Julia."</p>

  <p>And with a deep sigh at the futility of his consolation, the noble Roman
  left the tent, giving strict orders to the peasant girls who had been pressed
  into her service, and to Arvina's freedmen who were devoted to her, on no
  account to suffer her to leave the camp that night, and even, if need were,
  to use force to prevent her.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the frost wind had risen cold and cutting over the field of
  blood. Its chilly freshness, checking the flow of blood and fanning the brow
  of many a maimed and gory wretch, awoke him to so much at least of life, as
  to be conscious of his tortures; and loud groans, and piercing shrieks, and
  agonizing cries for water might beheard now on all sides, where, before the
  wind rose, there had been but feeble wailings and half-unconscious
  lamentations.</p>

  <p>Then came a long wild howl from the mountain side, another, and another,
  and then the snarling fiendish cry of the fell wolf-pack.</p>

  <p>Gods! what a scream of horrid terror rose from each helpless sufferer,
  unanimous, as that accursed sound fell on their palsied ears, and tortured
  them back into life.</p>

  <p>But cries were of no avail, nor prayers, nor struggles, nor even the
  shouts, and trumpet blasts, and torches of the legionaries from the camp, who
  hoped thus to scare the bloodthirsty brutes from their living prey, of friend
  and foe, real comrade and false traitor.</p>

  <p>It was all vain, and ere long to the long-drawn howls and fierce snarls of
  the hungry wolves, battening upon their horrid meal, were added the flapping
  wings and croaking cries of innumerable night birds flocking to the carnage;
  and these were blended still with the sharp outcries, and faint murmurs, that
  told how keener than the mortal sword were the beak and talon, the fang and
  claw, of the wild beast and the carrion fowl.</p>

  <p>Such, conquerors, such a thing is glory!</p>

  <p>That frost wind, among others awakened Paullus to new life, and new
  horrors. Though gashed and weak from loss of blood, none of his wounds were
  mortal, and yet he felt that, unaided, he must die there, past doubt, even if
  spared by the rending beak, and lacerating talon.</p>

  <p>As he raised himself slowly to a sitting posture, and was feeling about
  for his sword, which had fallen from his grasp as he fainted, he heard his
  name called feebly by some one near him.</p>

  <p>"Who calls Arvina?" he replied faintly. "I am here."</p>

  <p>"I, Caius Pansa," answered the voice; it was that of the old legionary
  horseman, who had predicted so confidently the fall of Catiline by the hand
  of Paullus. "I feared thou wert dead."</p>

  <p>"We shall both be dead soon, Caius Pansa," replied the young man. "Hark!
  to those wolves! It makes my very flesh creep on my bones! They are sweeping
  this way, too."</p>

  <p>"No! no! cheer up, brave heart," replied the veteran. "We will not die
  this bout. By Hercules! only crawl to me, thou. My thigh is broken, and I
  cannot stir. I have wine here; a warming draught, in a good leather bottle.
  Trust to old Caius for campaigning! I have life enough in me to beat off
  these howling furies. Come, Paullus; come, brave youth. We will share the
  wine! You shall not die this time. I saw you kill that dog&mdash;I knew that
  you would kill him. Courage, I say, crawl hitherward."</p>

  <p>Cheered by the friendly voice, the wounded youth crept feebly and with
  sore anguish to the old trooper's side, and shared his generously proffered
  cup; and, animated by the draught, and deriving fresh courage from his
  praises, endured the horrors of that awful night, until the day breaking in
  the east scared the foul beasts and night birds to their obscene haunts in
  the mountain peaks and caverns.</p>

  <p>Many times the gory wings had flapped nigh to them, and the fierce
  wolf-howls had come within ten feet of where they sat, half recumbent,
  propped on a pile of dead, but still their united voices and the defensive
  show which they assumed drove off the savages, and now daylight and new hopes
  dawned together, and rescue was at hand and certain.</p>

  <p>Already the Roman trumpets were heard sounding, and the shouts of the
  soldiers, as they discerned some friend living, or some leader of the rebels
  dead or dying, came swelling to their ears, laden with rapture, on the fresh
  morning air.</p>

  <p>At this moment, some groans broke out, so terribly acute and bitter, from
  a heap of gory carcasses hard by Arvina and the old trooper, that after
  calling several times in vain to enquire who was there, the veteran said,</p>

  <p>"It were pity, Paullus, that after living out such a mle as this, and
  such a night as the last, any poor fellow should die now. Cannot you crawl to
  him with the flask, and moisten his lips; try, my Paullus."</p>

  <p>"I will try, Caius, but I am stiffer than I was, and my hurts shoot
  terribly, but I will try."</p>

  <p>And with the word, holding the leathern bottle in his teeth, he crawled
  painfully and wearily toward the spot whence the sounds proceeded; but ere he
  reached it, creeping over the dead, he came suddenly on what seemed a corpse
  so hideous, and so truculently savage, so horribly distorted in the death
  pang, that involuntarily he paused to gaze upon it.</p>

  <p>It was Catiline, although at first he recognised him not, so frightfully
  was his face altered, his nether lip literally gnawed half-through, by his
  own teeth in the death agony, and his other features lacerated by the beak
  and talons of some half-gorged vulture.</p>

  <p>But, while he gazed, the heavy lids rose, and the glazed eyes stared upon
  him in ghastly recognition; Paullus knew him at the same moment, and started
  back a little, drawing a deep breath through his set teeth, and murmuring,
  "Ah! Catiline!"</p>

  <p>The dying traitor's lips were convulsed by a fearful sardonic grin, and he
  strove hard to speak, but the words rattled in his throat inarticulate, and a
  sharp ruckling groan was the only sound that he uttered.</p>

  <p>But with a mighty effort he writhed himself up from the ground, and drove
  his sword, which he still clasped in his convulsed fingers, by a last
  desperate exertion through Paullus' massive corslet, and deep into his
  bosom.</p>

  <p>With a sharp cry the youth fell prone, and after two or three struggles to
  arise, lay on his face motionless, and senseless.</p>

  <p>Catiline dropped back with a fiendish grin, and eyes rolling in a strange
  mixed expression of agony and triumph; while old Pansa, after crying, twice
  or thrice, "Paullus, ho! noble Paullus!" exclaimed mournfully, "Alas! He is
  dead! He is dead! And I it is who have slain him."</p>

  <p>Within half an hour, Petreius and his guards with several mounted
  officers, and a lady upon a white palfrey, came riding slowly toward the
  fatal spot, pausing from time to time to examine every pile of carcasses, and
  after causing his men to dismount and turn over the bodies, in the hope of
  finding him they sought.</p>

  <p>Their search had hitherto been fruitless, and unrewarded even by the
  discovery of any wounded friends or comrades, for this was the place in which
  the battle had been most desperately contested, and few had fallen here but
  to die almost on the instant.</p>

  <p>But now a weak voice was heard calling to the general.</p>

  <p>"Petreius, he is here! here! He is here, noble Petreius!"</p>

  <p>"The immortal Gods be praised!" cried Julia, interpreting the casual words
  at once to signify Arvina, and giving her palfrey the rein, she gallopped to
  the spot, followed by Petreius shaking his head gloomily; for he was not so
  deceived.</p>

  <p>"Who? who is here?" exclaimed the general. "Ha! my stout Pansa, right glad
  am I to find you living. See to him, quickly, Postumus, and Capito. But whom
  do you mean? Who is here?"</p>

  <p>"Catiline! Paullus Arvina slew him!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"By all the Gods!" exclaimed Petreius, leaping down from his horse and
  gazing at the hideous mutilated carcase, still breathing a little, and
  retaining in its face that ferocity of soul which had distinguished it while
  living!</p>

  <p>But swifter yet than he, Julia sprang from her saddle, and rushed heedless
  and unconscious, through pools of blood, ancle deep, treading on human
  corpses, in her wild haste, and cast herself down on the well known armor,
  the casque crested and the cloak embroidered by her own delicate hands, which
  could alone be distinguished of her lover's prostrate form.</p>

  <p>"Aye! me! aye me! dead! dead! my own Arvina!"</p>

  <p>"Alas! alas!"&mdash;cried Petreius, "Raise her up; raise them both, this
  is most lamentable!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Never heed me!" said the veteran Pansa, eagerly, to the officers who were
  busy raising him from the ground. "Help the poor girl! Help the brave youth!
  He may be living yet, though I fear me not. It is my fault, alas! that he is
  not living now!"</p>

  <p>"Thy fault, old Pansa, how can that be, my friend?&mdash;who slew
  him?"</p>

  <p>Once more the rigid features of Catiline relaxed into a horrid smile, the
  glaring eyes again opened, and starting half upright he shook his hand aloft,
  and with a frightful effort, half laugh, half groan, half words articulate,
  sneered fiendishly&mdash;"I! I. Ha! ha! I did. Ha! ha! ha! ha!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>But at the same instant there was a joyous cry from the officers who had
  lifted Paullus, and a rapturous shriek from Julia.</p>

  <p>"He is not dead!"</p>

  <p>"His hurts are not mortal, lady, it is but loss of blood,"</p>

  <p>"He lives! he lives!"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Curses! cur&mdash;cur&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;this&mdash;this
  is&mdash;Hades!"</p>

  <p>The fierce sneer died from the lips, a look of horror glared from the
  savage eyes, the jaw gibbered and fell, a quick spasm shook the strong frame,
  and in a paroxysm of frustrated spite, and disappointed fury, the dark
  spirit, which had never spared or pitied, went to its everlasting home.</p>

  <p>It was the dead of winter, when the flame of rebellion was thus quenched
  in rebel blood; Cicero still was consul. But it was blithesome springtide,
  and the great orator had long since sworn <span class="smcap">that he had
  saved his country</span>, among the acclamations of a people for once
  grateful; had long since retired into the calm serenity of private life and
  literary leisure, when Paullus was sufficiently recovered from his wounds to
  receive the thanks of his friend and benefactor; to receive in the presence
  of the good and great Consular his best reward in the hand of his sweet
  Julia. It was balmy Italian June, and all in Rome was peace and prosperity,
  most suitable to the delicious season, when on the sacred day of Venus (36),
  clad in her snowwhite bridal robe, with its purple ribands and fringes, her
  blushing face concealed by the saffron-colored nuptial veil, the lovely girl
  was borne, a willing bride, over the threshold of her noble husband's
  mansion, amid the merry blaze of waxen torches, and the soft swell of
  hymeneal music, and the congratulations of such a train of consuls,
  consulars, senators and patricians, as rarely had been seen collected at any
  private festival. In a clear voice, though soft and gentle, she addressed
  Paullus with the solemn formula&mdash;</p>

  <p class="footnote">36. Friday.</p>

  <p>"Where thou art Caius, I am Caia."</p>

  <p>Thenceforth their trials ceased; their happiness began; and thenceforth,
  they two were one for ever. And, for years afterward, when Roman maidens
  called blessings down upon a kindred bride, they had no fairer fate to wish
  her than to be happy as Arvina's Julia.</p>

  <p>And how should any man be blessed, in this transitory life, if not by the
  love of such a girl as Julia, the friendship of such a man as Cicero, the
  fame of such a deed, as the death of <span class="smcap">The Roman
  Traitor.</span></p>

  <h2><a id="notes"
     name="notes"></a>NOTES TO <i>THE ROMAN TRAITOR</i></h2>

  <p class="first">It is perhaps hardly necessary to state, that the oration of
  Cicero in the 37th page of the second volume, those of Caesar and Cato in the
  137th and 142d pages, and that of Catiline in the 217th page of the same, are
  all literal translations from the actual speeches delivered on those
  occasions, and recorded by Cicero and Sallust.</p>

  <p>It was absolutely necessary for the truth and spirit of the romance, that
  these speeches should be inserted; and the author considered that it would be
  equally vain and absurd to attempt fictitious orations, when these
  master-pieces of ancient eloquence were extant.</p>

  <p>This brief explanation made, no farther notes will, I believe, be found
  necessary; as the few Latin words which occur in the body of the work are
  explained therein; and the costumes and customs are described so much in
  detail, that they will be readily comprehended even by the unclassical
  reader.</p>

  <p>A table is appended, containing the Roman and English Calendars of the
  three months during which all the events of the conspiracy occurred,
  illustrating the complicated and awkward mode of Roman computation; and this,
  I believe, is all that is needful in the way of simplifying or elucidating
  the narrative.</p>
