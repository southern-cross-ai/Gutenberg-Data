<h2>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2>

<p class="first">British-born and educated at Berlin and Oxford,
Ernest Favenc (1845-1908; the name is of Huguenot origin) arrived
in Australia aged 19, and while working on cattle and sheep
stations in Queensland wrote occasional stories for the
<i>Queenslander</i>. In 1877 the newspaper sponsored an
expedition to discover a viable railway route from Adelaide to
Darwin, which was led by Favenc. He later undertook further
explorations, and then moved to Sydney.</p>

<p>He wrote some novels and poems and a great many short stories,
reputedly 300 or so. Three volumes of his stories were published
in his lifetime:</p>

<p><i>The Last of Six, Tales of the Austral Tropics</i>, 1893</p>

<p><i>Tales of the Austral Tropics</i>, 1894</p>

<p><i>My Only Murder and Other Tales</i>, 1899</p>
<br>

<p>His short stories range from bush humor to horror,
supernatural to strange, and to the privations of late 19th
century exploration in Australia's unforgiving inland. His first
two short story books (consolidated into one volume, as there is
considerable overlap), are available free as an ebook from
Project Gutenberg Australia.</p>

<h2><a id="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="first">IN this, the seventh and probably last, compilation of prolific author Ernest Favenc's hitherto
uncollected short stories, I have included a number of stories
that were, in fact, <i>previously collected</i> in the now
extremely rare book <i>My Only Murder and Other</i> Tales (George
Robertson and Co., Melbourne, 1899).</p>

<p>I had hoped to track down all the stories in that volume to
recreate it digitally, but some of them are, so far at least,
unobtainable. Those that I have recovered are scattered through
this series, with several in this volume.</p>

<p>There are still other stories not yet collected due to
shortcomings in the OCR texts of newspapers at TROVE, the digital archive of the Australian National Library, and the
sometimes poor condition of the original 120-140-year-old
newspapers themselves. There are, almost certainly, a number
of other stories as yet unknown to me. Sometimes story headings
in these old newspapers were in graphics, rather than typeset;
the OCR software at TROVE cannot read them, so they don't find their way into the index.</p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>01. &mdash; A VERY DRUNKEN GHOST</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 23 Jan 1897</h3>

<p class="first">
I HAD not heard of or from my old friend Jim for more than a
year when to my great surprise, I got a letter from him to say
that he was married to the little girl he had met when he was
coach-driving. Her husband had drunk himself into his grave, and
Jim, following his fate, had espoused the widow. He wrote and
asked me to visit him, if ever I was up in that district, and in
course of time I did.</p>

<p>I found Jim much more comfortable than the generality of
Australian small farmers. As a rule, they are a class whose
principal virtue is a capacity for hard, continuous work, but in
other respects they have not the faintest notions of decency with
regard to everyday life. The better off they are the more they
delight in living roughly and coarsely. A shilling spent on
comforts is regarded as wicked waste by the generality of
them.</p>

<p>Jim, however, had knocked about a good deal, and thought
differently, and little Mrs. Parks agreed with him. He had a
comfortable house, and he lived in it; didn't pig in the kitchen,
as most of his neighbors did. Jim was unfeignedly glad to see me;
said he hadn't enjoyed an edifying conversation for months, and
implored me to stop a week, at least.</p>

<p>'I'm in trouble, old man,' he said, the second day of my
visit.</p>

<p>'Why, you and the wife are as jolly as sandboys; you don't
look it anyhow.'</p>

<p>'Ah, that's on the surface; I'm wasting away with worry.'</p>

<p>'Well, out with it, I know that it will do you good to tell
it.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I want your advice. Fact is, I am haunted, and I don't
know how to act; I, of all men in the world. Haunted by the ghost
of that drunken galoot who first married my Tilly.'</p>

<p>'That's very awkward,' I remarked.</p>

<p>'It is so particularly when he is such a lowdown, sneaking
kind of ghost. You know I told you, how I pitched him into a
creek once? Well, he makes out that that was primarily the cause
of his death, which it wasn't; he drank himself to death.
However, he holds that I am his murderer, and that he has a right
to haunt me, and intends doing so. Now it's worrying Tilly. She
put up with enough from him during his life, without having to be
tormented now he's dead. I'm going to stop it somehow.'</p>

<p>'How does he appear?' I asked.</p>

<p>'In all sorts of ways. Sometimes by knocking where you don't
expect it; sometimes you'll feel something very cold and wet
touch you&mdash;that's to remind me of the creek business; and
sometimes he'll begin cursing and swearing like he used to when
he was drunk.'</p>

<p>'Why don't you try your old game of ridiculing him, if he
won't listen to reason. I suppose he's got a down on you for
marrying his widow?'</p>

<p>'That's just it. Now while you're here I intend to proceed to
extreme measures. You will give Tilly more confidence, for it's
made her nervous. He hasn't shown up since you've been here. I
suppose he's taking your measure before he plays up.'</p>

<p>Jim and I then constructed a plot which was to be carried out
immediately the ghost put in an appearance.</p>

<p>We had not long to wait. That evening at tea there came a
thundering rap in the middle of the table, that jarred everything
standing on it. Mrs. Parks turned pale, and Jim looked at me
significantly.</p>

<p>'I thought table-rapping had gone out,' I remarked. 'I
understood that the respectable ghosts boycotted all the low
brutes who went in for that sort of thing.'</p>

<p>'There are some ghosts too mean for anything,' returned
Jim.</p>

<p>Here there were three or four angry raps on the table.</p>

<p>'Go it, old man,' said Jim, 'break the crockery, it's what you
used to do when you were alive, and very drunk.'</p>

<p>'Don't irritate him, Jim,' said Mrs. Parks, as several
sounding thumps came on the table.</p>

<p>'Is it a Chinaman's ghost?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Yes; it must be, for he's not game to show himself.'</p>

<p>'I am,' said a voice.</p>

<p>'No, don't on any account,' said Mrs. Parks.</p>

<p>'Jim,' I said, 'surely he will not have the bad taste to show
himself when Mrs. Parks is present; let him fix a time with us to
argue the question, end show him the error of his ways.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but he's such a sneaking brute, he won't.'</p>

<p>I gave a start and a jump at that moment, for something cold
and wet touched my hand, but it was only the nose of Jim's dog
who seemed interested in the conversation.</p>

<p>'Will you materialise, and meet me to-night? I think I can
show you reason in the matter.'</p>

<p>'Very well, I'll see you at 12.'</p>

<p>Jim and I had agreed that he should not appear personally in
the matter, for his temper was naturally ruffled at his wife's
late husband insisting on making things so disagreeable.</p>

<p>Twelve o'clock found me awaiting the ghost armed with a bottle
of whisky. He was a long shambling, unhealthy looking fellow, not
at all up to the mark as a ghost, but perhaps his death and
burial had not improved his appearance. I inquired if it would
incommode him to take a seat. He replied 'no,' and sitting down,
cast a greedy eye at the whisky.</p>

<p>'Perhaps in your materialised form you can partake of some
refreshment?' I said.</p>

<p>'You bet,' he replied, and helped himself to about half a
tumbler, which he tossed off without more than an apology for
water.</p>

<p>'Now, what's your little game?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Simply to annoy Jim Parks. 'I'll make his life burden to
him.'</p>

<p>'And you won't do yourself any good.'</p>

<p>'Won't I?' he said, reaching out for the whisky bottle again.
'I'll have the pleasure of tormenting him.'</p>

<p>'Well, you are a contemptible kind of ghost,' I said: 'I
always thought ghosts were of a better disposition.'</p>

<p>'Disposition! I'll disposition Mr. Jim Parks; he'll chuck me
into a waterhole, will he? And marry my wife? Here, what yer
hugging that whisky bottle for? Pass it over here.'</p>

<p>It was evidently taking effect upon him, and in a short time
he began to talk incoherently, addressing some invisible person
in the room, who was seemingly striving to get him to come away.
After a few more nips he became unconscious, and went to sleep,
breathing stertorously.</p>

<p>Jim came in, and we both regarded the sottish ghost.</p>

<p>'He'll be precious bad when he wakes; let's brand him.' He
took the cork of the whisky bottle, burnt it in the candle, and
blackened the ghost's face with it.</p>

<p>'I reckon I'll get rid of him for the price of a case of
whisky,' he said.</p>

<p>It was a shattered ghost that appeared the next Bight. 'Give
me a drink,' he prayed.</p>

<p>'I don't see why I should,' I replied. 'Jim's scarcely likely
to keep you in free drinks when you're doing all you can to make
his life miserable. However, here's a glass of water for
you.'</p>

<p>'Water!' he exclaimed, with scorn; I want whisky. I nearly
overslept myself; only just woke up in time to dematerialise
before daylight, and haven't been getting slops ever since. They
say I have utterly disgraced the profession coming back with my
face blackened. That was a shabby trick to play on a poor
ghost&mdash;an orphan, in a strange land.'</p>

<p>'Good enough for you. 'What do you mean by coming here at
all?'</p>

<p>'Don't talk; give me a nip. A recovery is bad enough when you
are alive, but it's ten times worse when you are dead.'</p>

<p>'If I give you a good stiff nip will you consent to discuss
this question, from both points of view.'</p>

<p>'O glory! yes.' I gave him a stiffener, and sighed deeply, and
remained quiet until it worked a little. 'What do you want me to
do?'</p>

<p>'Stop coming here.'</p>

<p>'I won't.' As he said it he gave a howl, and jumped in his
chair.</p>

<p>'What did you do that for?' he cried.</p>

<p>'What's the matter,' I asked, 'somebody from your side of the
world trying to teach you good manners?'</p>

<p>He grabbed the whisky bottle, and tossed off half a
tumbler.</p>

<p>'There,' he said, defiantly, addressing the unseen person. 'I
defy you. Just you hit me again.'</p>

<p>The next instant he received a blow in the face that knocked
him back into his chair, where he sat gaping with his mouth
open.</p>

<p>'I say, that's not fair,' he gasped. 'Well, come down to
conditions,' I said, 'your friend evidently does not approve of
your conduct.'</p>

<p>'What'll you do?' he muttered.</p>

<p>'You can have a right royal spree to last all the rest of the
time you are in eternity if you promise to leave off this
foolery.'</p>

<p>He spoke in some unknown tongue, and apparently got an answer,
for he said, 'I've got to or else I'll be degraded to the
seventeenth circle, whence I can't come back to earth.'</p>

<p>'Jolly good job,' I said, 'but how do I know that you will
keep your word?'</p>

<p>'I will answer for him,' said a clear voice, full of authority
and dignity. I had now got so accustomed to mixing with spirits
that I did not even start at hearing this. I bowed towards the
direction the voice came from, and expressed my sense of the
honor done by his using the influence.</p>

<p>'He will have a week's leave, and I trust to your honor not to
let him expose himself to strangers, nor play practical jokes on
him when he is unconscious.</p>

<p>You hear,' he went on in a voice of great severity, 'mind you
obey, or the seventeenth circle for 600 years.'</p>

<p>The voice ceased, and the wretched spectre remarked, 'He's
gone,' and stretched out his hand to the bottle.</p>

<p>I told Jim of my success, and the next morning Mrs. Parks went
off on a visit to a friend. What a time that ghost gave us; he
used to stop all day, for he was so drunk that he could not
dematerialise himself, and used to make frantic efforts, and
fail. He'd vanish as far as his waist, and then his power would
fail, and we'd look in to see the upper half of a man's body,
holding on to his glass, and singing, or trying to sing
uproarious songs. He got Jim an awful, bad name, for, as his
presence was kept secret, people put down all the racket either
to Jim or me.</p>

<p>Never was there such a drunken ghost since the beginning of
time. He used to knock himself about fearfully, and was bruised
all over. At last, <i>delirium tremens</i> got hold of him, and
he used to talk about things that it was not nice to hear. He was
so bad that his shaking hand could not hold the glass to his
lips, and we were able to control his potations, so that by the
end of the week he was shaky and comparatively sober. We were
afraid that he would not be able to disappear, but the unseen
presence came, and gave him a hand, I think, and he faded
gradually upwards, his eyes disappearing last, and they were
fixed on one nip left in the bottle. I think he regretted losing
that nip more than anything. Jim harnessed up, and went over to
fetch his wife back, and I left Jim in a few days, relieved and
happy.</p>

<p><br>
SOME time after that I saw an account of mysterious
proceedings in Sydney. A tall, shambling man had made himself
notorious by appearing in hotel bars, demanding a drink, and
immediately he had swallowed it, disappearing, naturally without
paying. His movements created the utmost alarm, but all efforts
to secure him failed. At last he must have made too many calls,
for he fell asleep in one place, and was secured by two trembling
policemen, who, however, managed to convey him to the lockup.
Needless to say, when they went for him he was gone.</p>

<p>He has not appeared since, so I suppose he has been banished
to the seventeenth circle.</p>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>02. &mdash; THE OLDEST INHABITANT</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney,  9 Jan 1897</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
LARRIMOOR was an important township in New South Wales. That
is to say, important in the eyes of the inhabitants, who
considered they were justified in regarding it so. It was a very
conservative township. Most of the residents in and around it
were of long standing, and had risen with the town.</p>

<p>It also possessed an oldest inhabitant, but the people were
only partially proud of him. He knew too much. If he had confined
his recollections to floods and droughts, etc, it would have been
right enough; but he mixed social matters up with other matters
in a way that was quite unnecessary. When a man distinctly
remembers the arrival of wealthy townspeople with the proverbial
half-crown, or nothing, it is inconvenient.</p>

<p>Watkins, for that was his name, was a standing trap for the
verdant young reporter. When anything happened out of the usual,
and the verdant ones came up to give it world-wide publicity,
they invariably struck Watkins, and they all of them thought that
they had discovered Watkins, when, in fact he had figured over
and over again, as the oldest inhabitant, whose memory was
something marvellous.</p>

<p>Watkins was a stubborn democrat, to neither man, woman, nor
child would he give the slightest title; he called the local
C.M.G. 'Moe,' and so with everybody else. He was feared, was the
oldest inhabitant, and he knew it. You might set them up again
till further orders; but that would not prevent him from
reminding you of the time when you were slushy to the shearers'
cook at Mindambin.</p>

<p>Mindambin had been the swell station of the place; far and
wide at one time spread its ample acres, but time bad changed all
this. Small grazing farms extended throughout its leaseholds, and
the bank was about to take possession of the last little spot
held by young Dalton, the sole survivor of those who had been on
Mindambin for three generations. His grandfather had made the
station, his father had lost it, and died, leaving him a hopeless
legacy.</p>

<p>One of the wealthiest men about there was one Edkins. He had
been a fencer, and got many good contracts on Mindambin. His
knowledge of the country stood him in good stead, and he soon had
the choicest spots selected. Dalton awoke to the fact, too late,
that his best country was being eaten away from him. He borrowed
money to select in his turn, and then the ruin commenced. Young
Dalton returned to the station to find everything going to the
devil, and his father drinking heavily.</p>

<p>Edkins, the ex-fencer, throve mightily. Watkins and he had
been former workmen, and the oldest inhabitant hated him
cordially. Yet, strange to say, Bell Edkins, the youngest
daughter of the family&mdash;a pretty girl of 18&mdash;was one of
the only two beings that the old man entertained any feelings of
kindness for. The other was young Frank Dalton. To both he
retained his surly, defiant manner; but he would have done
anything in his power to serve them. The self-made Edkins and
himself never met without snarling. It galled the former bitterly
to be addressed as Jim, with an insolent familiarity that
sharpened the sting; but he could not help or avoid it. Nothing
short of death would have stopped old Watkins; and he seemed
tougher the older he grew.</p>

<p>The old man had massed his chance of making much money, but he
possessed some allotments which rendered him independent. Poor
Frank Dalton had fallen deeply in love with Bell Edkins, and as
he was likely to be a pauper in a few weeks, there was not much
chance of his suit being successful. It was right enough as far
as Bell herself was concerned; but Edkins would not think of such
a thing. Although nothing open could be brought against him, he
knew in his heart that he had deeply injured his old master, and
hated his son accordingly.</p>

<p><br>
WATKINS stood in the main street, looking out for some
amusement. Mary Edkins, the eldest daughter, came riding down
with a man in attendance. She was a most distinguished young
lady, and had spent two seasons in Sydney, where, according to
her own account, she had made many conquests. She was bound for
the store, near where Watkins was standing, and had to pass
him.</p>

<p>'Good morning, Mary,' said the old man, affably.</p>

<p>'Be kind enough to address your betters properly.'</p>

<p>'Oh! This comes of going down to Sydney and mixing with dooks.
I suppose you didn't tell them that you used to go barefooted the
first ten years of your life?'</p>

<p>Mary muttered something about telling her man to horsewhip
him, and escaped into the store, accompanied by the old man's
mocking laughter. Bell then put in an appearance, having been
delayed behind her sister. Her too the old man greeted by her
Christian name, but there was a note of affection in it.</p>

<p>'He's going to Coolgardie,' he said, approaching. 'He'll have
just enough to pay his passage, and something in hand when he
gets there.'</p>

<p>Bell nodded and blushed. She did not need to be told who 'he'
was.</p>

<p>'Keep your heart up, little one. I'll manage that you see him
before he goes.'</p>

<p>Bell followed her sister into the store, and the oldest
inhabitant chuckled. Soon afterwards he saw Frank Dalton, and had
a long conversation with him.</p>

<p>'It's the best thing you can do,' he said. 'New South Wales is
played out for a poor man, and you'll have to keep your eyes open
for a man named Davis who was land clerk here. I'm not in a
position to say for certain, but I'm pretty sure that there was
some hanky-panky work about those three valley selections. Davis
was Edkin's tool in the matter, and I believe he played up with
the books and then got money to resign. I heard that he was seen
over in West Australia, but as likely as not he has taken another
name. It's only a fluke whether you meet him, but remember, he's
a man about your height and build, dark, with a white scar on his
left temple, and a bracelet tattooed round his left wrist. Rogues
are sure to fall out, and I expect he'll give you all the
information you want, as he's safe enough over there.'</p>

<p>That the lovers met and vowed eternal fidelity need not be
told, and Frank departed in search of a doubtful fortune, and
Bell remained to wait.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
FORTUNE did not come near Frank. All sorts of other things
did. Fever and hardship and bad luck. Now haunting the very
outskirts of the field; now in the centres, he made enough to
keep himself from starvation, and through it all he kept his eyes
open for ex-land clerk Davis, but he never saw him. Making a
small rise, he went up to the northern fields, but only to be
dogged by the same misfortune.</p>

<p>Meanwhile things had not gone very happily with Edkins. One
daughter had married against his will, Mary had developed into a
shrewish old maid, and the two sons were repeatedly bolting off
the course. Financially, he was as prosperous as ever, but Bell,
who had changed to a very staid and sober maiden, was his only
help and consolation. Naturally, the oldest inhabitant had acted
as post office, and the lovers had the melancholy satisfaction of
exchanging bad news.</p>

<p>At last, after two years, the time came when Frank had to go
east or die; repeated attacks of fever had brought him very low.
Fortunately, he had made enough money to pay his passage, and he
landed in Sydney a broken man, without hope of any sort. He went
to a mean and shabby lodging, and wrote to old Watkins, telling
of the hopeless state of the case, and bidding Bell farewell.</p>

<p>By return came a letter containing a cheery message from Bell,
and an enclosure of £60 from the old man, who urged him to accept
it, as he had no use far his savings, and no relations. This
somewhat cheered Frank up, and he started on a search for work.
He was lying reading one night, when he heard restless groans
from the next room.</p>

<p>He got up and went to the door of the room, and receiving no
answer entered. A man lay on the bed, evidently suffering from a
course of heavy solitary drinking. The eyes were bloodshot, he
shook the bed with his trembling, and he seemed unconscious of
the stranger's presence. Frank spoke to him, but got no answer;
so putting a wet towel round the sufferer's head, he went to the
nearest chemist for a strong sleeping draught. Returning, he
induced the man, after some trouble, to take it, and watched by
him till it took effect.</p>

<p>As he looked at the unconscious man, a strange thought came
over him. Was not this the very man whom he had looked for in
the outskirts of the desert, in the most remote and outlandish
places; here he was, next door to him in a cheap boarding-house.
There was the scar on the temple and the tattooed bracelet round
the wrist.</p>

<p>He told the people of the house that he was an old friend, and
they, nothing loath, let him nurse the drunkard back to life and
reason.</p>

<p>'What is your name?' said the sick man to-him, after he had
been gazing curiously at him for some time.'</p>

<p>'Dalton.'</p>

<p>'Your father lost everything, then?'</p>

<p>'He did.'</p>

<p>'And I was the cause, or at least was bribed by that fellow
Edkins to alter the dates in the book. He paid the first amount
he promised me, but I have not been able to get anything from him
since. He had me under the whip.'</p>

<p>'I have been looking for you all over West Australia. If you
will make a declaration of what you have told me; I think I can
assure your safety and bring Mr. Edkins to his knees.'</p>

<p>'Who told you there was anything fishy?'</p>

<p>'Old Watkins</p>

<p>'Ha! he's a sly old dog. Well, it can't do me much harm, for
I'm nearly played out, and it will be revenge on Edkins.'</p>

<p><br>
WATKINS undertook the task of settling with Edkins.</p>

<p>'You see here, Jim,' he said, while the man writhed, 'honesty
is always the best policy in the long run. Now, we'll deal fairly
with you. Bell's a charming little girl, and Frank's one of the
right sort. Give the young people a start, and we'll cry quits.
There'll be a lot of dirty water stirred up if you don't. Lord,
what evidence could not I give.'</p>

<p>Edkins took the advice, and the oldest inhabitant saw his
long-cherished project fulfilled.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>03. &mdash; THE SHILLING REEF</h2>

<h3><i>Tasmanian</i>, 22 and 29 Sep 1894</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THE English language does not contain sufficient objectionable
adjectives to adequately describe old Monson. He was simply a
human blister who made life unbearable, not only for himself but
for all those who had the ill fortune to be forced to put up with
him. He lived seemingly for one object, to find fault with
anything and everything, with anybody and everybody.</p>

<p>The family of this amiable old gentleman consisted of his
wife, who took her daily bullying as an unfortunate dispensation
of Providence which was not to be evaded, and without which,
indeed, she would have felt uncomfortable; a daughter, who,
fortunately for herself, was a chip of the old block and held her
own valiantly, having, moreover, the advantage over her father of
a woman's greater fluency of speech; there was also a son, adrift
in the world somewhere, for, after putting up with his irascible
parent for many stormy years, Tom Monson had shaken the dust of
his childhood's home from off his feet, and that home knew him no
more. He had faded away into that vague region known as 'up
country,' but whenever a bank was stuck up, or a particularly
notorious swindle perpetrated, old Monson always informed his
wife that the culprit was their son Tom under a false name. This
was a very ingenious mode of torture, for if there was anything
in the world the poor woman had left to cling to, it was Tom, or
his memory.</p>

<p>Cornelia Monson was by no means a bad-looking girl, although,
as before stated, she inherited her father's temper in addition
to the share Nature had bestowed on her by right of sex;
consequently she did not want for admirers. Tom having been cast
into outer darkness, it seemed fairly patent that Cornelia would
eventually come in for the old man's money, which was reported to
be considerable. So many bold men ignored the obvious fact that
the young lady had the makings of a very pretty spitfire in her,
and laid siege to the affections of Miss Monson. As the damsel
was not in possession of what is popularly supposed to be a
heart, it came about that the favoured suitor was an elderly
widower of means, a man after her father's own views, a
recommendation sufficient to condemn anybody. Her mother's
opinion was not asked in the matter.</p>

<p>Everybody who knew Monson predicted that he would depart this
life in a fit induced by an outbreak of temper, and for once what
everybody said nearly came true. Cornelia had been married nearly
six months, when a stranger called one morning at Monson's office
and intimated a wish to see that gentleman. He was a sunburnt,
keen-eyed man of sinewy' build, who gave his name as Hazel.</p>

<p>'I have the pleasure of knowing your son Tom,' he said, when
seated opposite Monson.</p>

<p>'Then, sir, I cannot compliment you on the choice of your
acquaintances, retorted the old man, fiercely. 'If he owes you
any money you won't get it out of me, I can assure you.'</p>

<p>His visitor was quite unmoved.</p>

<p>'Tom does not owe me any money; on the contrary, I owe him my
life, which he once saved at considerable risk to himself. I was
led to understand that your opinion of him was a most unjust one,
and that you were quite undeserving of such a son; but for all
that I have come here to say what I intend to say.'</p>

<p>'Did that disgraceful scamp dare to insinuate that I did not
deserve to have a son like him?' bellowed Monson.</p>

<p>'<i>I</i> say so,' returned Hazel, 'but keep quiet; an old man
like you should know how to behave himself.'</p>

<p>Monson choked with ire, and stared at the cool intruder with
eyes nearly starting from their sockets. The other leaned forward
in his chair and shook an audacious forefinger at him.</p>

<p>'Tom is as fine a young fellow as there is in Australia, and I
am here to-day without his knowledge, for he is far too proud to
approach you himself.'</p>

<p>'Finish what you have to say, quick!' gasped Monson.</p>

<p>'Tom would be on my place now; but I have suffered the fate of
many more, and my station has been foreclosed on.'</p>

<p>'I am delighted to hear it,' interrupted his listener.</p>

<p>Hazel went on unheeding. 'We are now off together to try our
luck at the new gold-fields in Western Australia, and, as you may
suppose, cash is not too plentiful. Considering that your son has
never received anything from you but unmerited abuse, I think it
is only just that you should open your heart, or your cheque
book, which I presume to be the same thing, to the amount of a
hundred or two, to give him a start. I undertake to say that if
things turn up trumps, he will pay you with interest.'</p>

<p>'You undertake to say! A bankrupt squatter! Now, listen to me;
if you have quite finished.'</p>

<p>Hazel intimated, with perfect calmness, that he had.</p>

<p>'Then all I have to answer to your insolent request is, that
if Tom were waiting for the rope at the foot of the gallows, and
a hundred or two would save him, I would not find it. He was a
disobedient, rebellious fool from his boyhood. This is what I
will do,' he went on, with somewhat unnatural calmness. He
paused, took a shilling from his pocket and laid it on the table,
Hazel looking on with a scornful smile. 'Give him this, all he
shall ever have from me, unless'&mdash;and once more he paused
and laughed, harshly and discordantly&mdash;'unless be can turn
this shilling into a couple of thousand pounds with in twelve
months. I will put a clause in my will that, if by the aid of
this shilling he can make two thousand pounds within the next
twelve months, I will leave him all I die possessed of.'</p>

<p>Hazel picked up the coin.</p>

<p>'I had not intended to tell Tom of my visit, nor what a low
brute you have become. Now I will, and give him this'&mdash;and
he put the shilling in his pocket. 'I have not yet told you that
your son is married and has a child&mdash;your grandchild. It was
to get some ready money to leave with his wife that I made this
application.'</p>

<p>He stopped and looked hard at the other; but in the sullen,
scowling face of the old man there was no sign of relenting.</p>

<p>'I dare say, went on Hazel, 'that I can fix things up
financially without your assistance, although I am only a
bankrupt squatter. It is lucky that I am not your son instead of
easy-going Tom; for I would take you by the scruff of the neck
and shake you until the money jumped out of your breeches'
pocket.'</p>

<p>Speechless with fury, Monson lifted his fist, and brought it
down with a crash on the little hand-gong.</p>

<p>'Turn this man out!' he roared to the clerk, who came hastily
in. The clerk smiled sadly, and, glancing at the stranger, rubbed
his hands apologetically, as if he did not quite understand the
order in a literal sense.</p>

<p>Hazel laughed. 'Good morning, 'Mr Monson. You'll go off in a
fit one of these days if you don't keep your temper under,' he
said, as he walked out of the room.</p>

<p>Then Monson let loose the vials of his wrath upon all and
sundry of his dependents, and when he had cursed them to a
standstill he went but and ate a hearty luncheon.</p>

<p>Next he visited his lawyers, and finally, when he went home in
the evening, he had the fit that everybody had long predicted.
All through a weary night he fought with death, at intervals
vainly trying to say something, to utter words his disobedient
tongue refused to form. As nobody could understand the strange
language that came bubbling inarticulately from his lips, nor
read the unmeaning strokes; and dashes his useless fingers tried
to write, his message remained undelivered until the morning,
when Death let him off for a time.</p>

<p>A very different Monson got up out of the bed where he had had
such a tussle for his life. True, his fits of rage were worse
than ever, but that was because he found his memory failing.
Sometimes he could not remember from the morning to the
afternoon, and at other times he was quite his old self again.
Gradually his son-in-law, the man after his own heart, and not
very far off his own age, slipped into his place in the office,
and by the time the next fit came, and Death was the victor, had
pretty well got the reins of power into Iris hands.</p>

<p>Mrs Monson had positively kept a secret from her husband
during the last months of his existence, for she had actually
seen Tom when he was in Sydney with Hazel, and not alone that,
but had made the acquaintance of Tom's wife and taken a great
liking to the girl, and never mentioned it to her husband. The
secret was also at first jealously guarded from Cornelia, as well
as the fact of Mrs Tom's residence in Sydney. For Cornelia was
rapidly developing into one of the shrewest of shrews&mdash;a
feminine reproduction of her father, as her husband, the more
than middle-aged Mr Witton, knew, to his cost.</p>

<p>When Monson's will was brought to light the curious clause
last inserted relative to Tom caused some discussion. The old man
had made a fair provision for his widow, the bulk of his fortune
going to Cornelia, provided that absurd last clause was not
fulfilled. Witton treated the matter scornfully, as something
that could be easily set aside on the plea of unsound mind, but
his lawyers were not very hopeful. Nay, they were so unkind as to
point out that if Tom heard of the will and his father's death he
might find an unscrupulous speculator to advance the necessary
two thousand pounds; and this, with a plausible story, might
necessitate a compromise at any rate.</p>

<p>This made Witton and his Cornelia very uneasy, and they prayed
earnestly that Tom might be located beyond the reach of any news
of any sort. Judge, then, of Cornelia's dismay when she found
out, by accident, that not only was there a Mrs Tom and son in
Sydney, but that the traitress&mdash;her own mother&mdash;was on
terms of close friendship with the enemy. Needless to say their
efforts at secrecy had all been thrown away, as Mrs Monson,
senior, had told Mrs Monson, junior, everything; and, of course
Mrs Monson, junior, had written to her husband all about his
father's, death and last will and testament.</p>

<p>Having been told to hold her tongue for thirty years of her
life, Mrs Monson, senior, had, on becoming independent, developed
hitherto, undreamed of resources of garrulous loquacity. Her
loose tongue revealed the existence of Mrs Tom to her daughter,
and Cornelia's keen cross-examination did the rest. The Wittons
had a very uneasy time of it, and nobody ever more ardently
desired Time to hurry up his hour-glass than did this worthy
couple.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
ONE glorious star blazed in the east, killing with its
brilliancy the lesser lights around&mdash;the star of Lucifer,
the beautiful, radiant forerunner of the morn. Underneath it the
horizon was brightening with the first cold, grey light of dawn,
soon to change to warmer tints of pink and glowing scarlet.</p>

<p>In the growing light the silhouette of a low range was
visible, a square topped range cleft here and there with jagged
rifts. This vanished as the sun rose, and when daylight grew
strong nothing was to be seen but the hazy line that marked the
limit of sight on what appeared to be a boundless plain. An
unhealthy-looking plain. A plain which seemed to have been
afflicted with the mange, for spinifex grew on it in patches
only, leaving naked, pebbly spots uncovered with any growth. Two
men who had been riding during the late watches of the night
looked weariedly at the desolate outlook before them.</p>

<p>'How far do you reckon that range is we saw just now?' said
Tom Monson.</p>

<p>'Between twenty and thirty miles,' returned Hazel.</p>

<p>'It's a bare chance that we may get a rock-hole there, but
it's ten chances to one that our horses give in first.'</p>

<p>He looked anxiously around as he spoke. Suddenly his gaze
became! fixed on one point, and with, an exclamation he drew his
companion's attention to a column of smoke rising, apparently,
only a few miles away.</p>

<p>'White smoke by Jove! That means, grass; spinifex always burns
black,' said Hazel after regarding it for a few minutes.</p>

<p>'May be only niggers travelling,' suggested Tom.</p>

<p>'Possibly, but there may be a dip in the country which
prevents us seeing the timber, if there is any.'</p>

<p>He was right. A short five miles took them over an
imperceptible rise, and before them lay some scattered patches of
mulga with the filmy white smoke rising from their midst. Here
they found a low mound of granite and at its base the remains of
what had once been a fine supply of water in a rock hole. So
scanty was it now that it barely sufficed to relieve their
thirsty horses and fill their water bags. Some blacks had camped
there the night before and one of their fires had ignited the
short dry mulga grass; fortunately for the two men, who would
otherwise not have found the place.</p>

<p>The horses watered and turned out and their meal finished, the
two friends discussed the situation.</p>

<p>'If we go on,' said Hazel, 'and get no water at the range we
are done for, as there is no more here to help us back.'</p>

<p>'I've brought you awful bad luck, old man,' returned Tom.
'Here we are on our beam ends. We have not made five pounds since
we came here, and now this prospecting trip appears likely to put
the finish on everything.'</p>

<p>'Don't whip the cat. I don't like turning back, but it is a
great fluke to go on.'</p>

<p>'I wonder whether that range we saw is the one the fellows
were talking about.'</p>

<p>'What about the fellow coming in with the specimens, and then
going out again and never coming back?'</p>

<p>'Yes, he brought in some yarn of a range.'</p>

<p>'Well we must speedily settle the question of going or turning
back. Which is it to be?'</p>

<p>'We're dead, broke, so it does not seem much use going back;
but, then, our luck is so bad, that we shall probably come to
grief if we go on.'</p>

<p>'Let's toss up for it.'</p>

<p>The two looked at each other and burst out laughing.</p>

<p>'We haven't got a coin between us,' said Hazel, as though it
were a brilliant joke.</p>

<p>'Stay,' said Tom, gravely, 'I have a coin.'</p>

<p>'What! The shilling!'</p>

<p>'Yes; I have stuck to it.'</p>

<p>'We shan't get much luck out of that; but never mind, up with
it. Heads, go on; tails, turn back.'</p>

<p>Tom spun the coin, and it fell jingling on the flat rock.</p>

<p>'Heads it is,' he cried stooping down.</p>

<p>It was a characteristic of the men that as soon as the oracle
of chance had decided their movement not another word was said
about going back. The horses were soon packed and saddled, the
last drop of water scraped out of the hole, and a start made
about noon. That night they camped in a scanty patch of scrub,
with short commons of water and little feed for their horses;
Next morning the low range rose black and forbidding in front of
them. Tom seemed depressed by the desolation around, but Hazel
was in high spirits.</p>

<p>'I dreamt of your governor last night, Tom. He looked as black
as thunder, so I think there's some luck for us ahead,' he
said.</p>

<p>By midday they were, at the foot of the range, which was of
inconsiderable height, with low scrub growing over most part of
it.</p>

<p>'Right or left?' asked Tom, as they sat on their tired-out
horses and gazed at the gloomy, lifeless wilderness before
them.</p>

<p>'Toss again,' returned Hazel with a reckless laugh.</p>

<p>Tom took out the fateful shilling and clapped it on his
thigh.</p>

<p>'Heads, right; tails, left!' cried Hazel.</p>

<p>'Head again,' said Monson, uncovering the coin.</p>

<p>Hazel turned to the right and rode slowly on; skirting the
scrub. Tom drove the pack horses after him. On one side a barren
desert on the other a stony thicket. So they kept on until the
sun sank low, and it was evident that unless they soon came to
water their horses would give in.</p>

<p><br>
THE sun was about an hour high when Hazel pulled up and waited
for his companion.</p>

<p>'I am going to see if I can get up the range to look around,'
he said; 'but I am afraid the scrub is too thick to see
anything.'</p>

<p>He dismounted and went into the scrub. Tom sat down and lit
his pipe. He had become pretty well acquainted with adversity,
but this seemed about, the tightest fix he had yet been in; and
the worst of it was that Hazel was in it too. The man who had,
stood by him always.</p>

<p>Suddenly a melancholy, wailing note sounded above his head,
and there was the beat of broad wings&mdash;wild geese and flying
low.</p>

<p>He sprang up, and was just in time to seethe last two or three
birds disappear over the scrub. He shouted and called loudly. In
about ten minutes Hazel returned.</p>

<p>'Can't get a sight at all,' he said. 'What were you singing
out for?'</p>

<p>'A flock of wild geese went overhead; they were flying quite
low, in the direction we are going, only a little to the left. I
don't believe they were going half-a-mile away; let's go on while
it's light.'</p>

<p>'There must be a salt lake about,' returned Hazel, as he
mounted and rode on.</p>

<p>Suddenly the scrub rounded away to the left following the
range, which, also turned abruptly. Hazel was right, and so were
the geese. Before them lay the salt lake, a broad belt of mud
with a centre of clear water, which was covered with wild fowl.
On one side some desert gums showed where a small creek found its
way from the low range to the salt pan, for the lake was little
more. In this watercourse they were lucky enough to find a small
soakage spring of fresh water, quite sufficient for their
wants.</p>

<p>Both men slept the sound sleep of fatigue and relief that
night. In the morning Tom, when he returned with the horses,
remarked that they were not the first party that had passed the
salt pan, as there were old horse tracks about. The range being
no distance away, they started for it on foot, so as to make a
close examination of it and see if the country was worth
'trying.'</p>

<p>About half a mile from their camp they came to a larger water
hole than the one they had struck the night before. Here was also
an old, torn tent, still standing, though sadly rent and damaged
by the wind. By the look of the tracks, no one had been there for
some weeks. The hobbles for two horses were lying on the ground,
but neither saddle nor pack horse could be seen. In the tent were
a pair of blankets and a good supply of rations; but the
surrounding desert held the secret of the mystery of the
disappearance. Some unhappy wretch it must have been who, after a
long search for fortune, had fallen with the prize within his
grasp, for in the tent were several rich specimens of stone.</p>

<p>'Tom,' said Hazel, 'we have got to stop here until we find
where these came from. I think it's a good way off, by the look
of the country, but it is evident that this is the nearest
water.'</p>

<p>'How about the owner of them?'</p>

<p>'It's too late, I'm afraid, to look for him: it must be weeks
since he left this camp.'</p>

<p><br>
THREE weeks after that Hazel and Tom were gazing admiringly at
some specimens from what promised to turn out one of the richest
reefs in the district. In another three weeks the place was alive
with men and eager agents of Eastern syndicates were offering
large sums for a share in the famous 'Shilling Reef' as it had
been named, in honour of the coin with which Monson had cut off
his only son.</p>

<p>'Tom,' remarked Hazel, about this time, 'if that stern parent
of yours, whom we can afford to laugh at now, really inserted
that clause he spoke of, I should imagine that your claim to his
property at his death is indisputable.'</p>

<p>Tom, who was slow, looked in enquiry.</p>

<p>'Why, was it not by the aid of that shilling we got here, and
dropped on, this reef; and isn't it worth, a good deal more than
two thousand; and the twelve months is not nearly up yet?'</p>

<p>Two days afterwards one of the intermittent mails common to
new goldfields arrived, and had received letters which put him in
possession of the information that his father was dead, and had
inserted the clause in his will.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
IT is one of those perverse things so characteristic of this
uncertain life that after devoting many busy days and sleepless
nights to the accomplishment of one object, another man, by a
mere fluke, steps in and snatches the coveted prize from within
an inch of our grasp. Certainly, that was the feeling of Mr and
Mrs Witton when the fame of the 'Shilling
Reef'&mdash;considerably exaggerated, of course&mdash;was duly
wired over to the eastern colonies, together with the names of
the discoverers.</p>

<p>Neither of them doubted for an instant that Tom would avail
himself of the windfall to claim his inheritance. Already a
garbled and distorted story of the romantic finding of the reef
and the mysterious fate of the first prospector had gone the
rounds of the papers, and the public sympathy would probably be
in favour of the disinherited son, should the case ever come into
the courts. Even if the most favourable view were taken it would
mean an interminable lawsuit, which would swallow up the best
part of the estate. Under the circumstances, it was evident that
a friendly compromise would be the best thing.</p>

<p>Here, however, they had to reckon with Mrs Tom, whom Cornelia,
unfortunately, had treated with contempt and neglect. Naturally
she resented the sudden attempt at friendship inaugurated on
receipt of the astonishing news from the west, and was evidently
determined to use her influence to make Tom insist on his rights.
Matters were in this state of doubt when Hazel persuaded Tom to
take a trip home, leaving him to stay and watch over the
development of their property; and Tom, nothing loth to return a
rich man, in prospect, to the spot where he had most undeservedly
been exiled, consented. His presence was expected with much
anxiety by the people interested.</p>

<p>Three months still had to pass 'ere twelve months from the
signing of the clause elapsed when Tom stepped ashore at Sydney,
and was received with rejoicing by all his relatives and friends,
who quite ignored the previous, cold shoulders they had offered
him.</p>

<p>Everything went on smoothly and on greased ways, until a
thunderbolt suddenly burst in the shape of a telegram that the
original prospector of the 'Shilling Reef' had turned up and laid
claim to the ground held by Hazel and Monson. His story was that,
in making his way to the nearest camp to report the find, he had
lost his way, killed his horses, and nearly died, himself. He had
been rescued by some natives, and had lived with them until the
rain fell, and he was enabled to get back on foot.</p>

<p>The yarn had a new chum flavour about it that rendered it
somewhat unworthy of credence. Under the strong circumstances,
the deputy-warden referred the matter to headquarters for
consideration, and the result was that, as the twelve, months was
drawing to a close, the title to the mine was in dispute.
Although there was little doubt as to how the affair would end
Tom would not be in a position to say. He was in undisputed
possession of two thousand pounds unless the case were speedily
decided.</p>

<p>Urged on by the infatuation of greed, the Wittons now scorned
the idea of a compromise of any sort, and gave Tom to understand
that he was nothing more or less than a daylight robber.</p>

<p>Witton was seated in his office, lording it after the style of
the deceased Monson, when Tom was announced. As it was now only a
matter of days to the end of the year, he naturally jumped at the
idea that Tom had come to beg for a settlement of some sort. But
he was rather undeceived when young Monson, whose somewhat
sluggish nature could be roused on occasions, strode in with his
hat on, and, throwing a telegram on the table, said
fiercely&mdash;</p>

<p>'There, you infernal scoundrel&mdash;look at that!'</p>

<p>Witton took it up with shaking hand, for he guessed, that he
had been bowled out, and for good.</p>

<p>'It strikes me that there's something like a good sentence of
penal servitude hanging to that,' went on Tom, sternly, regarding
his trembling enemy.</p>

<p><br>
OUT at the 'Shilling Reef' Camp Hazel was fuming, and
inactively waiting for the expected decision which, of course,
could have been given at once, when he was accosted one day by a
new-comer on the field, one of his old station hands, who had
lately arrived from the East. Jim Blackwell and his mate had been
just as unlucky as his former employer at the start, and was what
is popularly known as 'dead broke.' He had been years with Hazel
in the old days, and naturally the latter at once helped him and
advanced him enough to keep him going until times changed.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards he came hastily into Hazel's tent, and,
collapsing on to his stretcher, began to laugh as though he had
come across the finest joke out. Hazel concluded that he had made
a lucky find, and, accordingly asked the question, at the same
time becoming conscious that there was an unusual stir and bustle
in the camp.</p>

<p>'They going to hang that fellow who claims the reef,' he
admitted at last, for he could hardly speak for laughing.</p>

<p>'Hang him&mdash;what for?'</p>

<p>'Dick and I spotted him for the first time, this morning. God
bless you, he came over in the <i>Australian</i> same time as we
did!'</p>

<p>The noise now increased, and Hazel thought it was about time
to go out and take a hand.</p>

<p>'It's all right,' said Jim, as they went towards the crowd.
'They only intend to give him a jolly good fright.'</p>

<p>The man had been fool enough to talk big and flourish a
revolver, so he had been a little roughly used and his nose was
bleeding, which did not improve his personal appearance, although
even an innocent man does not always look innocent under the
pressure of circumstances. Hazel, whose genial way and open
handedness had naturally made him popular in the camp, was hailed
with congratulations on his arrival. The culprit, who was without
tact, continued to bluster, and accused Hazel of setting the men
on to him.</p>

<p>'Divil a tree is there tall enough about here,' said a big
Irishman, who might have 'stood' for Terence Mulvaney.</p>

<p>'Let's put him against a tree and practice at him,' suggested
another.</p>

<p>'No, I'm bint on the hanging,' returned the Irishman. 'There's
a mulga there will about take his toes off the ground.'</p>

<p>Immediately the crowd started for the tree indicated; a sailor
struck up a shanty, and the rolling air was taken up by them all
as they marched along, the culprit in their midst.</p>

<p>By the time they had reached the tree, the poor devil's tune
had quite changed. The Irishman had fixed up a noose on the end
of a rope as they went on, and he threw one end over a branch and
put the loop round the neck of the man, who was now begging and
praying for mercy, and entreating Hazel to save him. Some of the
fellows tailed on to the end of the rope, and the Irishman said,
'Wait till I give the word, boys.'</p>

<p>'Suppose we hear what he has to say first?' suggested Hazel,
solemnly.</p>

<p>'That would be more satisfactory,' returned the other. 'Sure
there may be some more scoundrels mixed up in it. Now make a full
confession,' he said to the trembling wretch.</p>

<p>'I was put up to it in Sydney by a man named Witton. He paid
my passage, gave me all the details, and found me in money. I was
to get a couple of thousand if I could keep the case stringing on
for a certain time, on one excuse or the other, I was hard up,
and the times are very bad in Sydney, so I did what a good many
others would do, in my shoes.'</p>

<p>This was the gist of what he said.</p>

<p>'Is this a true yarn, think you?' said the Irishman to
Hazel.</p>

<p>'Yes, it fits in right enough. If they could have kept this
trumpery case going for a certain time my mate Monson would have
been cheated out of his father's money. This man Witton is his
brother-in-law.'</p>

<p>'Then it strikes me as he is the man as should be hanged. What
do you say, boys? If he takes an almighty oath to clear straight
back to Sydney and bate the life out of old Witton, shall we give
him a run for it?'</p>

<p>There was a general assent, and the Irishman was about to let
him go, when Hazel asked if the man had enough money to take him
back. He had.</p>

<p>'Then be off, and the sooner you're out of this colony the
better, for you'll be known from Dundas Hill to Kimberley before
very long.'</p>

<p>Amidst a prolonged howl and much noise, the culprit was
allowed to pack up his traps and go; and, as there had been a few
showers lately, the road was in good travelling order.</p>

<p>This was the substance of the telegram Tom received the
morning he confronted his brother-in-law. Needless to say,
Witton, after a very brief show of resistance, collapsed and
allowed Tom to dictate his own terms, which were far too generous
in the eyes of Mrs Monson, junior.</p>

<p>The 'Shilling Reef,' according to latest accounts, is keeping
its record and going down in a most satisfactory manner.</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
George Pichrel was brought up at the Water Police Court,
Sydney, for a violent assault on Mr E.L. Witton. The accused
pleaded guilty to a common assault, and paid the fine, although
the arresting constable stated that the assault was of the most
savage character, and that it was with difficulty that he dragged
the accused off his victim. The prosecutor, however, expressed
himself satisfied.</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>04. &mdash; BENSON'S BRIDE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, 6 Feb 1897</h3>

<p class="first">
BENSON was the undisputed magnate of Berringawatta&mdash;he
had risen to that dignity by industry, and an eye to Number One.
He commenced with the township as a humble saddler, and had grown
with it to greatness. Some of his old friends of early days
pursued the undignified avocations about the town that men who
have come to grief fall back on, but this did not trouble Benson.
They should have kept their money when they made it; consequently
Benson gave them the cold shoulder, and did not see his way to
any small loans for the sake of old times.</p>

<p>In this Benson was wise. He was the owner of many corner
allotments, and many men called him master. He was Mayor, and at
the coming change in the Electoral Act he intended to put up as
member for Berringawatta. But as Benson stood at the door of his
own prosperous store looking on the usual objects to be seen in
the main street he was a man, sad at heart. The fact was that
Benson's social manners had not kept pace with his rise in the
world, and he knew it. He had endeavored to rectify it by
employing an ex-college man, given to rum and romance, as a
tutor, but he had lately begun to entertain, wild suspicions that
this man, inspired by the devil, was taking a rise out of
him.</p>

<p>Benson began to think of getting married as a better
investment, but there, too, he was puzzled. He had his pick of
the district certainly, but he doubted if the local beauties knew
much more than himself, and if he went abroad in the world he
might be taken in. Still, as he was determined to rise out of the
little local world he lived in, something had to be done. His
cheeks burned when he recalled the fearful blunders he made, in
his confusion, at the Premier's visit. How he three times
addressed that plebeian-looking individual as 'Your Majesty.'</p>

<p>He sacked the ex-college man that day, for that dazed
individual in a pot-valiant state of mind, had told him that it
was fashionable in the best society for men to wear diamond
earrings. Benson, although ignorant in some matters, was not by
any means a fool, and the tutor straightway found himself
homeless and liquorless.</p>

<p>'I've suspected you for some time,' said Benson, 'and the
first time I catch you tripping I'll log you like a shot.' So the
M.A. subsided into nothingness once more, rather the worse off by
some debts he had contracted during his short spell of
tutorship.</p>

<p>Benson then looked with a worried eye upon the world, as
represented by the main street of Berringawatta.</p>

<p>At last a bright and happy thought occurred to him&mdash;he
would consult Mrs. Gonsalvo. The lady in question resided in
Berringawatta, her husband having left her a good deal of
property there. She was too old for his motives to be
misconstrued, and she had always been a good friend to him, he
thought. She was supposed to be very well connected, and spent a
portion of each year, regularly, in Sydney. She also had the
reputation of being clever.</p>

<p>Benson consulted the old lady, who seemed highly complimented
at his applying to her for advice, which, after some delay, she
gave him in plain terms.</p>

<p>'I quite agree with you, Mr. Benson, that a smart, capable
wife, a lady who knew her way about, would be the very thing,
would be the making of you, but though there are hundreds
knocking about, the difficulty is in finding one. You scarcely
would get what you want by going about with a placard on your
breast stating that you were a man of property, wanting a wife;
you would be the mark for every adventuress, and they would
assuredly take you in, my poor Benson.'</p>

<p>'I believe they would. A man is really no match for some
women.'</p>

<p>'My friends are all old fogies like myself, so I cannot help
you by any introductions, but I will do something for you. I am
going to Sydney as usual next month, and I may hear of somebody
who would make you a good wife; if so I will let you know.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Mr. Benson, I'll find you a wife,' said the old woman to
herself as he left, 'one that will comb your hair for you; the
impudence of your coming to me, as if I cared what sort of
thing.'</p>

<p>In point of fact, the old woman was a malevolent old witch who
had a special down upon Benson on account of some fancied lack of
politeness. Benson had delivered himself into the hands of the
enemy without doubt. In course of time the message came, and
Benson departed to Sydney, prepared for conquest. He went to call
on Mrs Gonsalvo the first thing, and found that lady all
smiles.</p>

<p>'The very woman for you, Mr. Benson. She's a widow&mdash;'
Benson made a wry face, '&mdash;and comes of a distinguished
Irish family.'</p>

<p>Benson's face grew still more elongated. He didn't quite like
widows, but he didn't say so.</p>

<p>'She is stopping at present at a very refined boarding house
in M&mdash;street, and I should advise you to take a room there,
and then you have a fair field and no favor.'</p>

<p>Benson proceeded to the refined boarding house, kept by the
usual scraggy lady widow, and secured a room there. At dinner,
which was refined down to starvation point, Benson met the widow,
Mrs Fitzgerald, and was introduced to her after the fashion of
refined boarding houses. She was middle-aged but comely,
well-dressed, and excessively reserved in manner. Benson was
rather taken.</p>

<p><br>
HE was sauntering about town next morning when he was hailed
by a voice he knew, and young Matson, the owner of one of the
stations about his district, advanced to meet him, accompanied by
a friend.</p>

<p>'Hallo, Benson! You down on a spree; how are you? This is my
friend Mr. Willow; Jack, Mr. Benson's too haughty now to do such
things; but at one time he could make as good a rough saddle as
anybody.'</p>

<p>From anybody else Benson might have resented this, but Matson
was a privileged man.</p>

<p>'Where are you staying?' asked the latter.</p>

<p>'At Mount de St. Clair, M&mdash;street,' said Benson,
proudly.</p>

<p>'God help you,' was the answer. 'I know those places&mdash;a
box of sardines, cheese, and flowers for lunch, two grass widows
and a young man who vamps the piano. Come and have a drink.'</p>

<p>They went, and it struck Benson what a fool he was not to have
consulted Matson instead of Mrs. Gonsalvo. Matson knew everybody,
good family, careless devil but perfectly honest and
straightforward. Was it too late? He might still take him into
his confidence. He obtained Matson's address, and promised to
call and see him.'</p>

<p>That evening he made great progress with the widow, on the
strength of their mutual friend Mrs. Gonsalvo, and began to think
very highly of her. In a day or two their relations had become
intimate enough for him to propose a visit to the theatre in
company with the mistress of the refined boarding-house, which
was graciously accepted, and that afternoon, he met Matson.</p>

<p>He felt in a confidential humor, and, in want of guidance, and
after swearing Matson to secrecy, he confided to him that he was
in search of a wife, and how far he had proceeded.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Gonsalvo? I know the old cat of course, hates me like
poison. What on earth made you go to her?'</p>

<p>'She has behaved most kindly, I assure you.'</p>

<p>'Has she? Well, it's the first time I ever knew her do such a
thing. My dear Benson, you would be much better standing on your
own merits, just as you are, and waiting for the right woman to
turn up. I don't believe in widows who live in refined
boarding-houses. Better ask me to dinner tonight.'</p>

<p>'Will you come? I will be delighted.'</p>

<p>'All right, I will come.'</p>

<p>Matson came duly, and it was a good-natured act to leave his
own good dinner for the refined boarding-house one, but he was
good natured. Mrs Fitzgerald was nervous that evening, and once
or twice dropped into what sounded like a brogue, but it was not
very pronounced.</p>

<p>'I've seen that woman before, somewhere,' said Matson, when up
in Benson's room, superintending that man getting into his dress
clothes, and cutting him down in the matter of studs and rings.
'But if you want my disinterested opinion, Benson, she
drinks.'</p>

<p>'Drinks?' echoed Benson, aghast.</p>

<p>'Yes, she had a drop too much to-night. You lay low, old man,
and she'll come out in her true colors.'</p>

<p>Matron departed; and Benson passed an unpleasant evening,
although Mrs. Fitzgerald behaved with the most perfect
propriety.</p>

<p><br>
'LOOK here, Sarah,' said Mrs. Gonsalvo, in tears in Mrs
Fitzgerald's room the next day, 'It's too bad after buying you
dresses and paying your board here, that you couldn't keep
straight long enough to catch that silly, vulgar fool.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzgerald, lightly and airily attired, arose from her
bed.</p>

<p>'It's ould Benson, is it? And what was the good of keeping up
the play-acting after that divil Matson had seen me. Shure he
knew me when I was barmaid at the Shearers' Arms, but he couldn't
place me. No, old Gonsalvo, me husband was an M.A., or he used to
say so, and do you think I'd disgrace his memory? There's four
bottles of lovely whisky in that cupboard, and I'm going to have
a right, royal spree on it, and wreck this old caboose
afterwards. Whoop!' and she gave vent to a yell that made Mrs
Gonsalvo shudder.</p>

<p>'Besides, I don't know whether me husband is dead or alive,
and I'll be surely had for trigometry or something if I be doing
your dirty work.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Gonsalvo departed in tears, and Mrs. Fitzgerald arrayed
herself in purple and fine linen and sailed out with a very red
face.</p>

<p>The first persons she met were Matson and Benson, and she
boisterously saluted them.</p>

<p>'You remember me at the Shearers' Arms, don't you?' she said
to the former; 'sure its many a time you were there. I married
that worthless wretch M'Ginty, M.A. Is he alive or dead?'</p>

<p>'Good God!' said Benson, for M'Ginty, M.A. had been his late
instructor in deportment. 'He's alive,' he gasped.</p>

<p>'Well, I'm sorry to hear it; for that old Gonsalvo cat put me
on to marry you, and the old thafe would have had me run in for
trigometry. I'll tear the fringe off her bald head, I will.'</p>

<p>Benson was too horrified at his narrow escape to say much. He
intimated to Mrs. Fitzgerald that if she gave him an address he
would send her a cheque out of gratitude, and then they went
where, as Matson said, they could have their laugh out.</p>

<p>'Hanged if I could place her,' he said, 'but her guilty
conscience gave her away, and the whisky did the rest.'</p>

<p>Mrs. M'Ginty had a great spree, and brought shame and
everlasting disgrace on the refined boarding house, and Mrs.
Gonsalvo dared not show up again at the township. As for Benson,
well, he took Matson's advice, depended on himself, was a much
better man for it, and the right woman came round in time.</p>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>05. &mdash; NATURAL HISTORY OF A THOUSAND YEARS AGO</h2>

<h3>As by "Dramingo"</h3>

<h3><i>Queenslander</i>, 3 Feb 1872</h3>

<p class="chaphead">
BEING a paper read by Professor Allinamess on the 1st of
January, A.D. 2872, at the opening of the new Social Science
Theatre on Central Mount Stuart. Our report is abridged from one
of the newspapers of the period:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">
ON Thursday, January 1, the new Social Science Theatre, on
Central Mount Stuart, was opened with due ceremony. The learned
professor, S. M. Allinamess, read a paper on "The Natural History
of a Thousand Years Ago." The arrangements were perfect in every
respect. A brilliant and fashionable audience, estimated at ten
thousand, attended. The improved "sound diffusing machine,"
placed directly over the professor, worked admirably; though
speaking in ordinary conversational tones, the learned savant was
distinctly heard by every one present. Our "automaton reporter,"
though placed in the most remote portion of the building,
recorded every word as it was spoken as clearly and rapidly as it
would have done had the figure been placed in close proximity to
the speaker. Every vibration of the air caused by the voice of
the lecturer must have therefore been as distinctly felt by the
artificial tympanum of the machine as if the paper had been read
close to its ear. The following is the substance of the learned
professor's lecture:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="first">
NATURAL HISTORY is a science that the vast strides made in the
use of machinery has rendered almost a forgotten and neglected
lore. Amongst the many forms of creation once swarming on the
earth few have survived, and, with two exceptions, they only
survive in a degenerate and useless form. The only animals known
to us as living in our day are horses, cattle, dogs, cats, and
pigs, and what we term domestic animals, the kangaroo and
alligator, and it is upon those lost to us, who but live in
tradition, that I would speak.</p>

<p>I will here mention one fact in connection with the horse not
generally known. It was formerly used for purposes of locomotion.
It was ridden in the same manner as we now ride the kangaroo on
land or the alligator in water; and attached to wheeled vehicles
it drew heavy loads from place to place. How our ancestors could
have preferred a clumsy four legged beast like the horse to the
agile kangaroo seems astonishing to us. But when we reflect how
little was then known of the laws of propulsion, our wonder
ceases.</p>

<p>Those, too, were the days of carriages with four wheels,
chairs and tables with four legs; everything depending for
support on artificial aid; nothing known of the true principle of
gravity.</p>

<p>To my subject:</p>

<p>The wild animals and birds of Australia were, it is well
known, the most ferocious and savage of any country. The kangaroo
and alligator alone showed any signs of a friendly disposition
towards man, and they, by the ignorant settlers, were hunted down
as pests.</p>

<p><i>The Jumbuck</i>.&mdash;This, though an animal of most
savage disposition, was kept in a partly domestic state by our
forefathers. They kept them in large herds guarded by armed men,
bribed to this perilous duty by means of high rewards; or by
prisoners sentenced to death and allowed the choice of this
employment. Its flesh was greatly esteemed. The origin of the
name seems to be that the jumbuck was an animal partial to
frisking on rocks. In the neighborhood of the Gulf of
Carpentaria, where large flocks were depastured, there are few or
no rocks. The alligators, knowing the jumbuck's weakness, would
approach the shore and elevate its back only out of the mud. The
jumbuck would approach, and seeing what it supposed was a rock,
would spring on it. Quick as thought the alligator would turn,
and receive the quadruped in his jaws. The guards, always on the
look out for these imitation rocks, seeing the jumbuck about to
spring, would cry, "Jump back, jump back!" and so the jumbucks
soon learned to know the warning cry, and thence were called
"jump backs," transmitted to us as "jumbucks."</p>

<p><i>The Emu, or Aymu</i>.&mdash;This ferocious bird was of the
same species as the "mower bird" of New Zealand, so called from
its scythe; shaped beak, with which it could mow down several men
at a time. The emu differed from the mower in having a short
sharp beak and capacious throat. Even better than human flesh it
liked eat, and from the mode in which it secured them derived its
name. Knowing the fondness cats have for making love during the
midnight hours, the emu approached the dwelling of the settler
after dark, and would utter a mew of seductive sweetness. The
cats, poor victims to misplaced confidence, would leave the
shelter of the roof to join their lovers, as they thought, and be
forthwith devoured by their relentless enemy. They were thus
called "mews," and, to distinguish the sexes, "he-mews" and
"she-mews." As they died out, the male's appellation got applied
to both, and thus we have emu.</p>

<p><i>The Possum.</i>&mdash;This was not an indigenous animal, as
has long been supposed. It was imported from Ireland by some of
the first immigrants, its original name being the O'Possum. It
ran wild in course of time, and grew to a great size; in fact, so
dire were the onslaughts it made on the more thinly settled
districts that the inhabitants had to provide themselves with a
kind of defensive armour, known as 'possum rugs' or 'possum
cloaks'. They were at last got under by Act of Parliament.'</p>

<p><i>The Native Companion</i>.&mdash;This is a mythical animal;
it is now clearly proved never to have had any existence. The
tradition originated thus: the black aboriginals had a
superstition extant amongst them that on their decease they would
arise again with white skins. On the advent of the whites amongst
them, the blacks landed they could detect a resemblance to
defunct relatives in various individuals, and to them would they
attach themselves, and with the devotedness and truth which had
rendered the name of the Australian black famous to this day, be
their friend and servant throughout life. These were called by
the whites their native companions.</p>

<p><i>The Laughing Jackass</i>.&mdash;An animal which combined
deep animosity against mankind with the most fiendish form of
treachery. The traveller on the lonely roads of the interior
would see the smoke of a fire rising out of some shady bushes. He
would draw near and be rejoiced to hear the sound of merry
laughter proceeding from the thicket, telling of the welcome
companionship of his fellow men. Unsuspecting would he plunge
into the scrub, only to form food for this monster. The peculiar
formation of its legs prevented it proceeding fast along the
ground; its only chance, therefore, was to lure its prey into
some thickly-timbered spot. Professor Makeitworse holds the
opinion that its real name was "the laughing jaguar," and as we
find the jaguar mentioned elsewhere as a much-dreaded beast of
prey, I consider this to have great weight.</p>

<p><i>The Morepork</i>&mdash;A species of bird identical, it is
supposed, with one mentioned in very ancient writings&mdash;the
"harpey." Like the emu this bird had a favorite description of
food&mdash;namely, pigs. But instead of using any art to entrap
its victims, relying on its enormous size and strength, it used
to enter the huts of the inhabitants and utter its awe-inspiring
cry, consisting of the two words: "More pork!" A pig would be
immediately sacrificed, in order to bribe it to depart. Instances
even have been known in which inhuman parents have, in the
absence of pork, presented the monster with a young child, in
order to secure its departure.</p>

<p>The other domestic animals of the ancients, now extinct, were
the lion and tiger, both harmless and inoffensive quadrupeds,
noted for their love towards men. The lion was so domesticated
that it was commonly used as a pillow, from whence it was called
"lie on." The tiger also performed the part of a faithful
servant. Its name is supposed to be a corruption of "tried
guard," so called on account of the devoted attachment and
gentleness of its character.</p>

<p><br>
THE professor concluded his lecture amidst expressions of
universal satisfaction, and, the revolving walls being put in
motion, the immense audience departed without experiencing the
slightest squeezing or annoyance. The central position of the
theatre favored the presence of visitors from all parts of
Australia. Several excursionists from the Great Barrier Reef were
also present.</p>

<p>To-morrow, Professor Wrongend will lecture on "The Discovery
of Australia," with some account of "Jackson the cook, the first
discoverer," whose tragical end on board the <i>Bounty</i>, at
the hands of the mutineer Adam Bligh, formed the subject of the
most attractive picture exhibited in the Royal Brisbane Academy
last year.</p>

<p class="footnote">
<i>Editor's footnote: "Jumbuck" is obsolete Australian slang
for a sheep; the common "possum" is a cat-sized tree-dwelling
marsupial, a "native companion" is a brolga, a tall wetland
wading bird of the tropics; a "laughing jackass" is a kookaburra;
and a "morepork" is an owl.</i></p>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>06. &mdash; THE ASKINVILLE FEUD</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 19 Aug 1899</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THERE was great excitement in Askinville, a small but growing
township in South Antarctica, when it was known that the Mayor
and Council had actually invited the Governor-General of
Antarctica to visit the town; and, moreover, that the Minister
for the Department of Ice Creams and the Minister for Scrub and
Sand, would accompany him, these two being the principal members
of the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Askinville had several small grievances and more serious
wants, but unfortunately there was a division of opinion on the
importance of these wants. One party wanted a gaol, the other
parry wanted a hospital. The first party urged that when the gaol
was not required, and that would be but seldom, for crime was
infrequent in South Antarctica, and offenders were generally let
off with a caution, it could be used as a hospital. On the other
hand, the hospital party said the same thing about the hospital.
The convenience, or inconvenience, of the prisoners on one hand,
and the patients on the other, did not enter into the
question.</p>

<p>The Mayor remarked with great wisdom: 'Gentlemen, we must get
this matter amicably settled before our distinguished visitors
arrive, or we certainly shall get neither.'</p>

<p>Both parties agreed most cordially with the Mayor, and
further, both agreed that the other side should give way. This
left things very much as they were before, and had it not been
for woman's wit, the town would hare been divided into anti-gaol
and anti-hospital factions when the important visit came off. In
fact, Askinville would have been in as bad a state as
Dreyfus-torn France if it had not been for the brains of one
shrewd little girl.</p>

<p>She was the daughter of the Mayor, the acknowledged belle of
Askinville, and just at a sensible age, when the frivolity of
girlhood merges into, the sagacity of the woman. What that age is
must remain a secret. Anyhow, she had a graceful figure, plump
and rounded, features more <i>piquante</i> than classical, and a
very pretty wit. She had more admirers than she wanted, but she,
no more than anybody else, could decide which was the most
favored knight. Possibly she might have had a lurking suspicion,
but at any rate nobody, else had.</p>

<p>'Mr. Conlon,' she said to one, 'I wish you'd be very ill; so
I'll that the doctor (the doctor was another admirer) 'would say
that you must be taken to a hospital.'</p>

<p>'Very kind of you to talk like that, Miss Morley, but what
particular disease would you like me to contract?'</p>

<p>'Oh, something terribly deadly and contagious.'</p>

<p>'Very well. As the plague has not yet reached Antarctica, and
there's no smallpox scare on at present, I'll choose typhoid;
will that suit you?'</p>

<p>'As good as anything; don't come near me after you have got
it.'</p>

<p>'Doctor,' said Conlon half an hour or so afterwards,' Miss
Morley has instructed me to contract typhoid as soon as possible,
so just oblige me by injecting some bacillus into my system, and
also finding out what her little game is.'</p>

<p>Dr. Whetsone reached out for the whisky and a couple of
glasses, and said: 'This will do for the present. I suppose she
has got some idea about settling this foolish dispute going on
just now as to which is most required in this town&mdash;a gaol
or a hospital. Of course, the hospital is the thing, but the
hospital will be a case of pound for pound&mdash;whereas, the
gaol will have to be built by Government.'</p>

<p>'Never mind,' said Dick Conlon; 'it is evident that it is the
hospital she wants, and the hospital she shall get if I have to
pay most of the pounds.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' said the doctor; 'I'll try to find out what she
intends. Meantime, drink your whisky, and consider yourself
infected with the typhoid microbe.'</p>

<p>The doctor meditated much over this interview. As formerly
stated, the doctor was an admirer of Miss Morley, and knew that
Conlon was a rival in the field, and Conlon was a comparatively
wealthy squatter. It's as well to say 'comparatively,' as at that
time the banks of Antarctica were wonderfully liberal in the
matter of overdrafts, and no question of foreclosure was ever
mooted amongst them. Consequently the matter of overdraft meant a
question of riches, more or less. Conlon was a squatter with
assets; Whetsone was only a struggling doctor. The inequality of
the combat was apparent.</p>

<p>The doctor consulted the damsel, and, as he expected, learned
from her the scheme she had hatched in her active brain.</p>

<p>'I want the hospital,' she said, 'and you are going to be the
resident doctor of it. Will you help me?'</p>

<p>Dr. Whetsone's reply need not be recorded, for of course it
was in agreement.</p>

<p>'Mr Jackwins,' said Miss Morley to another admirer, also a man
of wealth and substance, 'I want you to become a criminal.'</p>

<p>'A criminal?' asked Jackwins. 'What especial kind of crime
would you like me to commit. Murder at the least, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Exactly. Would you mind murdering Mr. Conlon for me?'</p>

<p>'With pleasure. He is a dear friend of mine; but,
nevertheless, he is also, I now remember, a dear friend of yours,
I will kill him with pleasure.'</p>

<p>Jackwins went away, and the first man he consulted was Dr.
Whetsone.</p>

<p>'Miss Morley wants me to kill Conlon,' said Jackwins. 'Have
you any objection to doing it for me?'</p>

<p>'I've done it already,' replied the doctor. 'I have just
infected his system with typhoid fever, at the request of Miss
Morley.'</p>

<p>'Then the matter is settled,' said Jackwins. 'Come and have a
drink.'</p>

<p>When the doctor and Miss Morley met there ensued a secret
conference, which cannot well be here repeated.</p>

<p><br>
THE then Governor-General of Antarctica was a man who was
supremely bored by everything. He had been for a long time the
Imperial inspector of the Lost Whales of Victoria Land, and the
fatigue of sitting on the edge of an ice floe and waiting for a
lost whale to come up and show his brand, and ask him to whom he
belonged, had caused him to wear a perpetual yawn. But he was a
very good fellow nevertheless.</p>

<p>The Minister for the Department of Ice Creams was a sarcastic
with a bad digestion, and the Minister for Scrub and Sand was a
sunburned fellow who did not know he had such a thing as a
liver.</p>

<p>These were the men who had to determine the burning question
then agitating Askinville, and until their visit was paid Miss
Morley and the doctor carried their plot on so nicely, that the
contending factions were united, and howled, so to speak, in one
voice for a Hospital.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
THE eventful day arrived; the Mayor was there ready, and so
was Miss Morley and with course, a most beautiful bouquet which
was to be presented to the Governor-General of Antarctica in the
approved and conventional manner current then when governors
arrive.</p>

<p>Neither Mr. Conlon nor Mr. Jackson were present, a fact which
is easily enough accounted for when one was supposed to be down
with raging typhoid and the other was supposed to be a criminal,
who had taken his friend's life, by poison. Beyond these two,
everybody in Askinville was there, and when the train arrived,
the cheer which rent the air was enough to astonish all the town,
if all the town had not been assembled at the railway
station.</p>

<p>All the town, however, was there to join In the cheers, so
that nobody was astonished, except the Governor-General, who, as
he stepped out on the platform, said in a stage aside to the
Minister for Scrub and Sand:</p>

<p>'Gracious! Am I supposed to shake hands with everybody?'</p>

<p>'No; only the pretty girls. Please yourself, your
Excellency.'</p>

<p>The G.G. smothered a yawn; it was the first time that he had
been G.G., and the first G.G. that Antarctica had yet had, so
that he was rather uncertain about the correct mode of procedure.
However, as the first person, after the Mayor and other
functionaries, was Miss Morley and the bouquet, which the
Minister for Scrub and Sand kindly took charge of, and as no man
could feel anything but warm when she was smiling on him, the
yawn vanished, and the G.G. forgot all about Victoria Land and
the chilly whales.</p>

<p>It was, of course, not until the banquet was over, the usual
toasts honored, and all things requisite to a Governor's
reception finished, that the G.G. found himself in the Mayer's
verandah taking a cup of tea from the fair hands of Miss
Morley.</p>

<p>'You won't be frightened, Sir Agnew,' said she in the course
of conversation, 'but we have a sad case of typhoid fever in
town, and, as there is no hospital in Askinville, I have
volunteered to go and nurse him, so perhaps I may not see you
again during your visit.'</p>

<p>'No hospital in a large town like this!' said the G.G.</p>

<p>'So prosperous and progressive,' interrupted the Mayor,
softly.</p>

<p>'Why that should be seen to at once. At any rate, Miss Morley,
you must not dream of endangering your life by such a
course.'</p>

<p>'This place, I understand,' broke in the Minister for Ice
Creams, 'wants a gaol badly.'</p>

<p>'On the contrary,' said the Mayor, 'our criminal-record is
very low indeed.'</p>

<p>'That's not what I've heard since coming here,' said the
Minister,' who was in the most cantankerous humor. 'I will go
farther, and mention that I have been informed that there is at
present a desperate criminal loose who has lately attempted to
commit an atrocious murder. A gaol should, I think, then be
the first necessity of this thriving and rising township.'</p>

<p>'Good heavens! Mr. Sangston,' interjected Miss Morley,
'whatever can you mean by such an assertion. There has been no
desperate criminal known in Askinville ever since its settlement.
If there was, I should never sleep a wink at nights,' which was
the proper and regular thing to say under the circumstances.</p>

<p>'Well, Miss Morley, I have heard, on good authority, that
there is such an individual at large. I was told so by your
doctor&mdash;your local doctor&mdash;who should know all about
the place.'</p>

<p>Miss Morley said merely, 'Dr. Whetsone told you?' and said no
more.</p>

<p>'I have not heard of any murder,' said the Mayor. 'In point of
fact no distinguished citizen is missing. Do you know of any,
Lily?'</p>

<p>Lily was Miss Morley.</p>

<p>'No, pa; only Mr. Jackwins. I have not seen him for some time.
He might have committed a murder and ran away.'</p>

<p>'I don't think so,' said the Mayor. 'On consideration I do not
believe Mr. Jackwins would even kill the harmless but necessary
cat when it yowled underneath his window.'</p>

<p>'This matter is easily settled,' said 'Scrub and Land;' 'if
the criminal is at large, he will not be found easily, and made
to prove his existence; but as to the typhoid patient, he should
be producible at any moment. Where's the doctor?'</p>

<p>'He's just coming up the street fortunately,' said Miss
Morley.</p>

<p>The doctor duly arrived, and joined the party.</p>

<p>Said the Minister for Ice Creams, 'Dr. Whetsone, I mast ask
you a very important question. There is, I believe, a disputed
question in this town as to which is most necessary at the
present juncture&mdash;a gaol or a hospital? The question, your
Excellency,' is of some importance, as the finances of South
Antarctica are much affected by the matter&mdash;I might say the
finances of my especial department; for, if a hospital were
established, our especial department would have to find all the
ice creams required by the patients during this torrid
weather.'</p>

<p>'I know a lot about ice,' said the G.G.; 'but I know nothing
about cream. Still, I am all attention.'</p>

<p>'Very well, your Excellency. Speaking officially, I understand
that the gaol is an imperative necessity; and, supposing that the
criminal is not caught, it would serve to isolate the typhoid
patient in, and, perhaps, when they caught the criminal, and
incarcerated, him there, he might catch it, and save law
expenses.'</p>

<p>'The idea is ingenious,' said the G.G.; 'but I must leave it
to you, my constitutional advisers. Only, Miss Morley should on
no account go into a gaol to nurse a patient, which was the
charitable intention she expressed just now.'</p>

<p>'Looking at it from my point of view, Sir Agnew,' said 'Land
and Scrub,' 'I think that the idea of a hospital is most to be
entertained. If you, Sir Agnew, were taken ill just now, would
you like to be taken off to a gaol?'</p>

<p>'Goodness forbid!' replied Sir Agnew. 'But you will forget
that I have nothing to say in the matter,' Said Mr. Sangston
tersely and with curtness, 'The supply vote for ice creams does
not come out of 'the Department of Scrub and Land.'</p>

<p>'All this time Dr. Whetsone has not been consulted,'
interjected Miss Morley.</p>

<p>'Very true, and to the point, as the sayings of your admirable
sex generally are,' said the G.G.</p>

<p>'Dr. Whetsone, you ought to know a great deal of this
matter.'</p>

<p>'I do, Sir Agnew, and I think the best way to decide the
question will be to produce both the criminal and the typhoid
patient. I can fortunately lay my hands on both.'</p>

<p>There was silence on the verandah. 'Out of regard for the
health of Sir Agnew,' said 'Scrub and Land,' at last, 'may I ask
if the complaint is especially infectious and dangerous?'</p>

<p>'Most 'emphatically so.'</p>

<p>'Then I think, and I believe, I have the consent of my worthy
colleague to say that we will excuse the presence of the typhoid
patient, and consent to the presence of the Criminal.'</p>

<p>'Very good,' said the doctor; 'he is just coming up the
street.'</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards Jackwins came up smiling on the
verandah.</p>

<p>'How are you, old man?' said 'Scrub and Land,' as they shook
hands; 'haven't seen you since we swam across the Lockerbar
together.'</p>

<p>'I'm first-rate,' returned Jackwins, after paying his respects
to Miss Morley and the G.G., and accepting a cup of tea.</p>

<p>'This is the criminal,' said the doctor, quietly.</p>

<p>'Ah! ah!' laughed' 'Scrub and Land;' 'why, Jackwins and I were
neighbors for years. Is this the desperate ruffian you want a
gaol for?'</p>

<p>'It is.'</p>

<p>'I quite agree with you,' returned Miss Morley.</p>

<p>'The idea of putting Mr. Jackwins in gaol!' said the Minister
for Ice Creams, 'This is a serious charge. Might I ask what
particular offence has been committed by this gentleman?'</p>

<p>'Not much,' retorted Jackwins, coolly, thinking he saw Miss
Morley's lead. 'Only trying to poison a friend, who is now
unfortunately recovering.'</p>

<p>'Then I see the greatest necessity for a gaol at once,' said
'Ice Cream.'</p>

<p>'Land and Scrub,' whose name was Wilton, leaned back in his
chair and laughed.</p>

<p>'Produce the typhoid patient,' he said. There came a dismal
groan from round the corner of the verandah and the doctor,
hastening forward, extended his arm to help along a tottering
figure, who stumbled round with his assistance. He looked the
picture of speedy dissolution, and the Minister for Ice Cream
jumped up at once.</p>

<p>'I give in,' he said. 'The hospital is the one thing needful
for this afflicted town. Let the blood-stained culprit go
ungaoled.'</p>

<p>'What do you say, Miss Morley?' asked the G.G. 'Is it really
worth while discussing the question? If they could run up a
hospital in a few weeks, do you think that the poor fellow would
live without your undergoing the danger of nursing him?'</p>

<p>'He would, I think. He would try to, I am sure,' said Miss
Morley.</p>

<p>THE Governor-General had departed, promising that he would
revisit Askinville, and lay the foundation-stone of the new
hospital. Conlon, Jackwins, the Mayor, and his daughter were
having tea once more in the Mayor's verandah.</p>

<p>'We did that very well,' said Jackwins. 'I think the way we
procured the Government grant to the hospital is past all
admiration.'</p>

<p>'I agree with you,' said Conlon. 'We worked it most
wonderfully.'</p>

<p>Miss Morley smiled. 'Dr. Whetsone has just got his official
appointment as resident doctor,' she said. 'And I am happy to be
able to tell you two old friends that we are to be married on the
day after the building is completed.'</p>

<p>'Don't say any more, old man,' said Conlon, as the two walked
home. 'The Askinville feud is no more, and she worked it
wonderfully, didn't she?'</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>07. &mdash; A TALE OF THE SIXTIES</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney,  24 Apr 1897</h3>

<p class="first">
ABOUT ten miles to the south of Fellworth Station was a jumble
of rugged basalt rocks which extended fifty miles in length, and
was ten miles broad in some places, in some only five. A running
creek rose in this maze of huge boulders of lava, and intersected
it, from one side to the other, at times taking a bend into the
open country on either hand. At the end of the maze it ran into a
small lake surrounded by reed beds.</p>

<p>Naturally this place was a great fastness for the blacks, who,
when the country was settled, did not fail to find out its
strategic advantages and avail themselves of them for the
purposes of cattle-killing. No one could track or follow them
across those blocks of naked scoria; and as the good grazing
country joined the black maze, they had no distance to go for
their beef.</p>

<p>One day a stockman belonging to the station saw smoke arising
at the edge of the maze, and a number of ovens cooking the joints
of a young heifer, whose head and lower limbs lay scattered
about. No blacks were visible, but as the little nook that had
been converted into a kitchen was surrounded on three sides by
the basalt rocks, they were probably not far off.</p>

<p>'I'll spoil their feed at any rate,' he said to himself,
getting off, and with a stick he demolished the earth ovens, and
scattered their contents abroad. It was a poor retaliation, for
the blacks are by no means particular as to a greater or less
amount of dirt with their food. However, it was very natural
under the circumstances, and the only punishment possible just
then.</p>

<p>Balkan, the stockman, rode round the semicircular wall that
hemmed in the little plot of level land, for it was a feature of
the maze, as it was called, that it met the good country sharply
and abruptly. He rode round with his revolver in his hand looking
to see if, any track led away from this spot, which seemed to be
a favorite haunt of the natives. He was rewarded; he saw what no
man had ever found before in the maze, a trail that seemed to
enter and wind out of sight among the boulders. Of course it was
only possible to follow it on foot, and he turned away determined
at some future time to come and trace it up with some companions,
for it was too hazardous a feat to encounter alone.</p>

<p>About six weeks afterwards the weekly mailman brought word to
Fellworth that the blacks were killing cattle on Rockfall, a
station on the opposite side of the maze to where Balkan had
been. As this seemed to intimate that the natives had, for a
time, vacated their side, Balkan suggested to the super that now
would be a good opportunity to examine the track and see where it
led to. Accordingly, with a good black boy and a man to look
after their horses while they were away, they started.</p>

<p>The remains of the ovens and the bones of the heifer were
still lying about, but there were no traces of the blacks having
revisited the place since. The track was soon found, and, leaving
their horses with the guard, the two men and the black boy
disappeared amongst the gloomy rocks.</p>

<p>The man with the horses went a little distance away, hobbled
the horses out on good grass near a waterhole, and set himself
down to wait. The adventurers did not come back that day, nor the
next.</p>

<p>In the evening the man rode in to the station and reported. At
the outside, the two men had expected to return at dusk the day
they started, as the maze at this point was only about seven
miles broad. Word was sent in to the neighboring native police
barracks, and the officer in charge came down with three of his
best trackers; but their efforts were unavailing. They were able
to follow the tortuous course of the pad the men had started on,
for about a mile and a half, then it was utterly lost, and on the
rasp-like rocks and boulders they could obtain no sign or trace
of the missing men.</p>

<p>They pushed on and came to the running creek that flowed
through the wall, and then came, back; the task of finding
anybody dead or alive in such a mad jumble of lava was hopeless.
A good lookout was kept along the edge of the wall, and the
result was that in a day or two the superintendent was found on
the running creek where it emerged from the wall for a short
space. He was worn to a skeleton, and his wits had deserted him.
He could tell them nothing of his companions, only stare before
him in a sort of crazy terror, and mutter in frightened tones of
awful things.</p>

<p>Painfully and slowly they followed the creek back through the
maze in hopes of finding Balkan and the blackfellow, but could
come across no trace of them. Slowly Banks, the super, recovered
his health and reason; and the story he told was as follows:</p>

<p><br>
CAUTIOUSLY and slowly the three had followed the track to the
place where the native police had lost it. They had lost it there
too, and halted to search, but could come across no indication of
its continuation in any direction. Ascending one of the highest
boulders they could find in the neighborhood, they saw from that
outlook a low flat-topped hill to the north-west. In default of
any other landmark, for all else was a sea of black basalt, they
made for this hill, seemingly about a mile distant. With the
obstacles they had to surmount and avoid it took them some time
to reach it.</p>

<p>They found it surrounded by a ring of disintegrated matter,
from which sprang a row of bottle trees completely encircling the
base of the hill, which they could see was an elevation of smooth
naked rock. Balkan stepped into the ring of bottle trees first,
and immediately raised the shot-gun he was carrying and fired at
a snake who, seemingly roused by his tread, raised its venomous
head directly afterwards he blew the head off another with the
second barrel.</p>

<p>'Come on, quick,' he said, slipping two more cartridges in;
'this infernal place is alive with snakes.'</p>

<p>It seemed so; from both sides there came a universal rustle
and movement, and two more shots were fired before they emerged
on the bare rock. The cone was soon surmounted, and then the men
found that they were standing, as might have been expected, on
the edge of the crater of a long extinct volcano. They looked
around, and could see the serpentine creek in places, but beyond
that all was black and repellant; the elevation was not high
enough even for them to see the open country they had left.</p>

<p>The interior of the crater was cumbered with detached boulders
of basalt, and there seemed to be nothing of interest therein.
They agreed to go on to the creek, and descended the hill.</p>

<p>'By heavens! we've roused every snake in Queensland,' said
Balkan, recoiling from the edge of the bottle-tree scrub.</p>

<p>The thin belt of scrub seemed alive with the reptiles; look
whichever way they would they were encircled by a loathsome ring
of writhing bodies and cruel eyes. Most people have an
instinctive antipathy to a snake; some exceptional persons seem
to be able to handle them without fear or repulsion, but this
want of feeling is very rare; almost everyone hates the sight and
touch of a snake. This dread was intensified in Banks, who had an
abnormal horror of a snake, and he shuddered at the idea of
finding himself hemmed in by these detested reptiles. Balkan and
the boy made a circuit, with no avail&mdash;the snakes were
aroused and active everywhere. They discussed the matter. The
scrub belt was no distance through; twenty vigorous steps would
carry a man out on the far side. It was ridiculous to suppose
they could be kept prisoners like that.</p>

<p>Balkan counted his cartridges; he was the only one carrying a
shot-gun, the others had Snider carbines.</p>

<p>'Let's try and clear a way with a cannonade,' he said. They
commenced, but soon saw they were uselessly wasting their
cartridges. For every snake killed and wounded two took its
place; so they had to cease firing.</p>

<p>'Perhaps they'll go away at night,' suggested Banks.</p>

<p>'I hope so,' said Balkan. 'Meanwhile let's have a feed.'</p>

<p>They had brought food and water-bags with them, so sat down on
the hot rock and ate their meal. There seemed no way of getting
through the belt of snakes unless they could fly; if they had
been able to obtain wood they could have scared them with fire,
but wood was unobtainable. Suddenly the black boy raised his
hand.</p>

<p>'My word, cattle come up!' he said.</p>

<p>All listened. There was a dull rattling sound approaching,
exactly resembling the noise of a rush of cattle. It came close,
seemed to pass by them like a wind, accompanied by a slight
trembling of the rock, and then it died away in the distance.</p>

<p>'An earth tremor,' said Banks.</p>

<p>The black boy got up; he was nearly shaking with fear.</p>

<p>'By-and-bye, night come up, we all bury,' he said. 'Me go
quick along a scrub, you plenty shoot.'</p>

<p>He commenced to tuck his trousers in side his Blucher boots,
evidently intending to make a desperate rush through the scrub.
The earth tremor had frightened him to desperation. It was no
good trying to stop him, and if he got through he would be able
to bring them help.</p>

<p>Balkan and Banks poured in a deadly fire, and he made his
rush. But the vengeful snakes were on him before he reached the
outer edge. They saw him stagger out with them twisting and
twining round arms, legs, and body, while he fought and tore at
them with screams and cries. Banks covered his face with
shuddering horror at the sight. Balkan watched the boy stagger,
fall, and lie still.</p>

<p>'It's no good&mdash;we're doomed,' said Banks, when he removed
his hands.</p>

<p>'It looks devilish like it,' returned his companion.</p>

<p>All the afternoon the men passed parading the heated rock and
pondering on a means of escape from their situation. Their only
hope appeared to lie in someone coming to seek them, but there
seemed scarcely the shadow of a chance that anyone would be able
to track them up.</p>

<p>At night they laid themselves down on the bare lava and
watched the full moon rise, cold and cruel, in the heavens.</p>

<p>'That's how they live!' exclaimed Balkan, sitting up and
looking around. Amazed at the irrelevant remark, Banks sat up
too. The surface of the rock was swarming with little moving
objects&mdash;bush rats, the little rodents of Northern
Queensland, who shift about in countless swarms. They appeared to
be issuing from the crater and running up the bottle trees to
feed on the young foliage; and the snakes were preying on them.
Luckily they did not come far outside the scrub, but what with
the hardness of their couch and the chance of a snake more daring
than the others paying them a visit, the tired-out men were kept
awake all night, cheered up by the fallacious hope that the
snakes would be gorged and quiet in the morning.</p>

<p>Towards daylight Banks dozed off, and when awakened by the sun
he missed his companion. Alarmed, he arose and searched around
for him. He called and coo-eed, but without success, and
mystified at the strange disappearance, he walked round the
scrub, thinking he might have made a desperate attempt to get
through. The snakes were as lively as ever, but he could only see
the body of the black boy on the other side; he began to hope
that Balkan had surprised the snakes in a gorged condition, and
got through in safety.</p>

<p>Turning away with a mixed feeling of desolate loneliness and
feeble hope, he saw, to his astonishment, the missing man
descending the hill.</p>

<p>'I have been having a look down the crater,' explained Balkan.
'I have found an opening or tunnel in there; I went inside! some
distance, but it got pitch dark in no time; the passage seemed to
keep on, however. What do you say if we tackle it; it's a poor
chance that it might come out somewhere, but it's our only
one.'</p>

<p>'Let's follow it wherever it goes; anything to get out of
sight of these devils,' replied Banks, whose nerves were
completely unhinged.</p>

<p>'Very well; we've got enough tucker left for a feed, so we'll
have it and start.'</p>

<p>'Don't strike a match without need,' said Balkan, who took the
lead in the matter; 'and feel every step with your gun when we
get in the dark.'</p>

<p>They entered the low tunnel-looking entrance, which was,
however, high enough for them to stand upright in. Darkness,
dense and overwhelming, soon encompassed them as they proceeded
slowly tapping their way. The rock beneath them seemed to slope a
little, but not much. After what appeared a long time, Balkan,
who was ahead, uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>'Can you still feel the wall?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied Banks.</p>

<p>'Stop then, and keep your hand on it; the passage has opened
out suddenly. I will feel my way on a bit.'</p>

<p>Banks stood motionless in the black darkness, his hand on the
wall. He heard his companion call to him now and again and
answered; then he heard Balkan say, 'Can you come to where I
am!'</p>

<p>He replied, and started to go cautiously in the direction of
his companion's voice. He heard him speak once or twice to
indicate his position; then, in reply to a call, he received no
answer. He shouted once or twice. Silence, and awful darkness,
which now seemed more impenetrable than ever.</p>

<p>To all his cries there was no answer; his companion, whose
nerve and courage had borne him up, had suddenly and mysteriously
disappeared. He felt his way in the direction he had last heard
the voice, but found nothing. He tried to make back to the place
he had left to return along the passage to light; but he had
hopelessly lost his way.</p>

<p>Of what passed he remembered little; his senses must have
mercifully left him. He had confused ideas of stumbling at last
into light on the bank of the rippling stream after what seemed
days of darkness, but that was all.</p>

<p>The mysterious disappearance of Balkan was never accounted
for, and Banks went south with a shattered nervous system that
brought him to the grave in twelve months.</p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>08. &mdash; A TALE OF CARPENTARIA</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 11 Aug 1900</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was in the earliest days of Carpentaria that the following
incident occurred. I say 'earliest' with intention, for
Carpentaria, which, by the way, now possesses a bishop of its
own, went through two stages of 'early days.'</p>

<p>First, it was settled in the early sixties, when the pastoral
rush took place to Northern Queensland. Then pastoral property
went down, and the expenses of keeping stations going in such a
far country were found to be too costly for anything, and
gradually the stock was withdrawn, and the country abandoned for
years.</p>

<p>Gradually it was re-occupied, and has remained so ever since.
Some of the old-time inhabitants came back again, and fondly
alluded to themselves ever after as 'old Gulf hands,' meaning
thereby members of the first settlement in contradistinction to
the second settlers. Beyond being, as a rule, foul-mouthed old
loafers, one was unable to see what especial claim this was to
merit.</p>

<p>In relating this incident it must, therefore, be borne in mind
that I refer to the first settlement, when Blanktown was the
capital of Carpentaria, and Normanton was unknown.</p>

<p>One reads much of the lawlessness of western towns in the
United States in the pages of Bret Harte; but let no one suppose
that the lawlessness of Blanktown resembled that of Red Dog and
Poker Flat. There were no Hamlynns or Oakhursts, there was no
humor except of the coarsest kind, there was no money except
paper orders, (mostly on Sydney), and there was very little
decency of any sort whatever. But there was plenty of heat, there
were more flies and mosquitoes, and sand-flies to the square inch
than in any other part of the world; there was Gulf fever, there
was a universal thirst, there, was plenty of square gin and rum
to quench it&mdash;at times, and at times there was nothing but
tepid water; to wind up, there was blasphemy enough to supply a
wilderness of bullock-drivers.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that Blanktown was not a choice
place of residence suitable for genteel families and young
ladies' seminaries. Some men stayed long enough to make a decent
cheque, came inside, and were lucky enough to get it cashed.
Other stayed too long, came inside, and were unlucky enough to
find the cheque worthless. Others, again&mdash;and how many who
can say?&mdash;stayed there altogether, not of their own accord,
but because they got put underground, and were left there when
the exodus took place.</p>

<p>There was a rude jingle composed in those days, which was sung
to the air of <i>To the West, to the West</i>.</p>

<p>It ran somehow:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
To the Gulf! To the Gulf! To the land of the flies!<br>

Where each insect tormentor for mastery tries;<br>

Where a cheque is a cheque if you live till it's got,<br>

But the chances are twenty to one you will not.<br>

To the Gulf! To the Gulf! To the land of the flea!<br>

Where the mighty old Flinders rolls down to the sea.</p>

<br>

<p>I forget the rest, but that does not matter. The above is
quite sufficient to show the merit of the production.</p>

<p><br>
A MAN lay dying of fever in the sweltering heat of a 'tin'
shed, as it is the fashion to call it now. In those days it was
galvanised iron. However, the name is indifferent. The heat was
just as unbearable and sweltering. Flies everywhere, in loathsome
masses on the man's eyes lips, nostrils, and ears; beside him for
sola comfort a pannikin of tepid water. Nobody knew much about
him, 'except the unmistakable fact that he was dying.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a name spoken amidst the noisy conversation
going, on in the next room, which stirred the dying man's dim
faculties, and brought him back from the borderland be was so
near crossing. He mustered up strength to brush away the flies,
which rose in a buzzing swarm, and called in a weak voice.</p>

<p>Fortunately there was a lull in the talk, and he was heard. A.
man came in the little room, or den rather, and asked in a rough
but not unkindly way what he wanted. The dying man looked up with
imploring eyes, and the' other stooped over him to catch what he
said.</p>

<p>'Did I hear Mordaunt's name?'</p>

<p>'Yes; Jacky Mordaunt. Just come in from the Gregory.'</p>

<p>'For God's sake, ask him to come here.'</p>

<p>The man nodded and left.</p>

<p>Immediately after a tall middle-aged man came into the room.
Like all others in that region, he was burnt a mahogany color,
but his blue eyes shone out clear and kindly. He went up to the
sick man, and bent down to see him more plainly.</p>

<p>'Mordaunt!' said the sick man feebly.</p>

<p>'Can it be possibly you? Dick Grey?'</p>

<p>'It is, old man, and you are just in time, as you can
see.'</p>

<p>'Stop; don't talk any more. Let me make you more easy. Here,
I'll wash your face and hands and keep the files away as well as
I can. I can get you nothing but a little weak gin; but I suppose
that will help to revive you.'</p>

<p>Mordaunt performed his various offices with a gentleness that
was astonishing, considering, and somewhat refreshed, the dying
man lay back and spoke to his friend.</p>

<p>'Jacky, where did I see you last&mdash;on Flamingo Downs,
wasn't it?'</p>

<p>'Yes, old man.'</p>

<p>'Well, when you leave this God-forgotten country, which I
shall never do, I want you to go back there. Will you?</p>

<p>'Certainly I will. What to do?'</p>

<p>'That's what I want to tell you. When I was there I came
across a beautiful piece of opal in a black's camp&mdash;a really
fine specimen. But where it came from is the question. I searched
and searched; gave up my billet to search. Hunted for the blacks
who had it, and couldn't find them. My money, ran out, and as
they were giving high wages droving to the Gulf at that time, I
came out here to make a cheque to go back and search. I shall
never go back, but you might have better luck, and if you find
the place I will tell you what to do with my share of it. Go down
to an address in Sydney I will give you, and you will find there
a girl who ought to be my wife, but isn't&mdash;you understand.
She must be in poverty&mdash;might be starving. Oh, how I have
writhed in agony lying here helpless, and thinking about it. This
is what I want you to do, and God has sent you, the only man I
can trust.'</p>

<p>Grey did not, of course, make this speech in the connected way
it is given above, but in a weak and fragmentary manner, which
Mordaunt found it hard to understand.</p>

<p>'Have you the specimen with you?' he asked.</p>

<p>'In my pack. There are two horses of mine knocking about
somewhere, and you will find the receipts there too. Sell them,
and use the money for the same purpose.'</p>

<p>The few other directions he had to give were given, and then
Grey leaned back with a relieved look on his face. His old friend
stopped with him all the afternoon, tending him with what care he
could give, keeping the swarming flies off and bathing his
forehead; alas, wet with the dews of death. Towards evening Grey
opened his eyes again, and spoke feebly:</p>

<p>'I never thought I should die as happy as this, Mordaunt. I
know, I feel, that you will not be too late. Good-bye, dear boy,
good-bye.'</p>

<p>And so, 'midst all the dirt and discomfort and torture of the
old Carpentarian times, he passed away, and, it being naturally a
necessity that in that climate a dead man should be buried at
once, before the red, hot sun had quite vanished he was laid to
rest in a shallow grave, for deep ones were too much trouble to
dig. After Mordaunt had disposed of the dead man's poor
belongings, and sold the horses, for no one questioned his right,
as he was well known and popular, he reflected that the best
thing he could do was to go straight down to Sydney, as he had
intended doing and then go on the opal search.</p>

<p>It was a long, weary ride in those days from the Gulf to
Bowen, the then port of the district; so it was some months
before Mordaunt saw Sydney Heads, but at last he was at liberty
to find out the person his dead friend had consigned to his
care.</p>

<p>Application at the address given at first proved
fruitless.</p>

<p>'I know nothing of the Miss Jones you speak of. She did stay
with me once, I admit,' the woman said in a severe voice.</p>

<p>'But,' Mordaunt pleaded, 'my business is really important; it
concerns a dead friend.'</p>

<p>Mordaunt had the manly sort of personality that no woman, old
of young, can refuse a small favor to.</p>

<p>'Well, if it's about a dead friend; and if he was a friend of
hers, all I can say it's the best thing for him he is dead, not
speaking uncharitably, you mind. Miss Jones is now Mrs.
Brown&mdash;at least I'm given to understand that's what she
calls herself. Mind you, I don't wish you to understand that I
say she is not really married to the man.'</p>

<p>Mordaunt stood aghast for a moment under this torrent of
explanation.</p>

<p>'Can you tell me her address?'</p>

<p>'Try the directory.'</p>

<p>'But there are so many of that same in the directory, and I
have not much time to spare.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said the woman, 'I have heard&mdash;mind you, I know
nothing myself&mdash;that Mrs. Brown lives at Matson Villa,
Jatson-street.'</p>

<p>'Thank you very much,' said Mordaunt, raising his hat and
turning away, 'you have saved me a lot of trouble.'</p>

<p>The woman gazed curiously after him, then shook her head and
shut the door as though she gave it up.</p>

<p>'I suppose that woman was not lying,' thought Mordaunt.
'Anyhow, I'll get it over at once.'</p>

<p>Matson Villa, Jatson-street, was unpretentious and pretty. In
reply to his request to, if possible, see Mrs. Brown, as he had a
message from an old friend to deliver, Mordaunt was asked in, and
told that Mrs. Brown would see him in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown, young, pretty, and all smiles, came in, but
somehow, whether Mordaunt's look checked the smiles or not, they
faded away, and she gave him a polite bow, and asked him to be
seated.</p>

<p>'I have taken the liberty of calling, Mrs. Brown, to deliver a
packet which a friend of mine up north asked me to deliver. It is
a fine specimen of opal.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown was all smiles again as she received the packet,
and very enthusiastic over the stone, which was really a
beautiful specimen.</p>

<p>'And who is the friend I have to thank for this?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Grey.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown considered. 'O, yes. Joe Grey, I remember. He
promised to send me something pretty from the north, and really
this is too exquisite. And how is the dear fellow?'</p>

<p>Before Mordaunt's eyes rose a vision of a man dying in the
heated atmosphere of the Gulf, amidst swarming flies and all the
abominations of the pit. Telling him (Mordaunt) with his last
words how he had writhed in agony lying there helpless, thinking
that she might be in poverty, or even starving.</p>

<p>'His name was Dick, Mrs. Brown.'</p>

<p>'Of course; how forgetful I am.'</p>

<p>'He is very well. He is dead.'</p>

<p>'Oh, how sad. But thank, you so much for bringing me this
piece of opal.'</p>

<p><br>
'HANG the opal mine,' thought Mordaunt when he got outside.
'Anyone can have it for me; I always heard that opals were
unlucky. I'll go back to the cattle; they're honest at any rate.
I'll give the little money of Dick's that I have to charity.'</p>

<p>'What's your opinion of horses, cabby?' he said as he lit a
cigar, before getting into the cab he had kept waiting.</p>

<p>'My opinion of horses, sir, is that they're dear at
present.'</p>

<p>'But, as far as regards character, which would you sooner
trust&mdash;a horse or a human being?'</p>

<p>'I understand, sir. I think that the horse is the superior
hanimal.'</p>

<p>'So do I,' said Mordaunt, as he stepped into the cab.</p>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>09. &mdash; A SUBURBAN MYSTERY</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney,  17 March 1900</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was not a fashionable part of Sydney by any means. The
houses were built in terraces, the gardens in front of them were
small; the street was narrow, and the wail of the smitten
time-payment piano resounded throughout the morning, sometimes
accompanied by a high-pitched shriek. But that was only where the
daughter of the house was supposed to be a budding genius, and
was allowed to shirk the house work in order to practise, against
the time when she was coming out to paralyse the musical world
and carry all before her.</p>

<p>Up this street one day came an elderly man, who inspected the
various cards hanging in the windows announcing 'vacancies' and
'apartments to let,' until, one house seemingly taking his fancy,
he knocked at the door, and asked, to see the room which the card
stated was vacant. On inspection, he approved of the 'apartment,'
and, stating that he would return that evening with his luggage,
paid a week's rent and left.</p>

<p>All the neighbors within hail of the place immediately went
over and discussed him, rather favorably on the whole. Mrs
Pennington, the landlady who had just let her room, sent out for
some beer to accompany her lunch, in order to fittingly mark the
occasion.</p>

<p>In due time the new lodger arrived, bringing a good supply of
luggage, and took possession at his room. It may be mentioned
that in securing his new abode the new lodger had found out that
Mrs. Pennington had neither a piano nor a musical daughter; in
fact, no greater or less encumbrance than a husband.</p>

<p>'But if it's music you want, there's plenty of it all round,'
said Mrs Pennington, mistaking the bent of her lodger's
query.</p>

<p>He assured her earnestly that music was the very thing he did
not want. He said this so vehemently that Mrs. Pennington felt it
rather a slight on the musical talent of the neighborhood, and
assured him that they had some real good musicians in the street,
and that Miss Tinkler, at 27, could be heard right at the end of
the street when she fairly got started.</p>

<p>The new lodger said that Miss Tinkler was an invaluable person
to have in the street in case of a fire or a murder, and the
conversation ended.</p>

<p>On the whole, Mrs. Pennington liked her new lodger; he paid
her well for his breakfast, which was the only meal he partook of
in the house, because he insisted on his eggs being fresh and his
steak of the best cut, and Mrs. Pennington was able to charge him
famine prices, under the plea that such articles were hard to
get; in fact, only obtainable by dint of great stress of labor
and business acumen. Still, he never grumbled, never gave any
trouble, departed every morning at 10 o'clock, and returned
punctually at 11, just when Miss Tinkler had finished asserting
that 'He will return, I know he will.'</p>

<p>There was only one thing that distressed Mrs. Pennington, and
that was that she did not know her lodger's business. Private
investigations were of no use whatever. Not a letter or a scrap
of paper was left about, and all his luggage was secured by locks
which defied spare keys of all descriptions. This was
aggravating, maddeningly aggravating, and there seemed no remedy
for it Mrs. Pennington felt that if the mystery lasted much
longer she would become ill.</p>

<p>Time went on, however, and Mrs. Pennington did not become ill;
she thought better of it. Mr. Blackstone, that was the lodger's
name, came home early one night, and brought a friend with him.
This was a thing unknown hitherto, and what it portended Mrs.
Pennington could not imagine, particularly as the friend was of a
swarthy color, evidently a gentleman whom Mrs. Pennington
included under the generic name of Indians. Mrs. Pennington did
not disdain to listen at the door.</p>

<p>'You have brought them over then in glycerine?' she thought
she heard Mr. Blackstone say.</p>

<p>'Just as they were delivered to me,' she heard the 'Indian'
answer.</p>

<p>Then followed the unpacking of something and silence for a
good while, until Mrs. Pennington nearly grew frantic. Then there
was the sound of unlocking, and locking a box or portmanteau, and
Mr. Blackstone said:</p>

<p>'You see, I had to come here to be quiet. No one would ever
have thought of looking for me here, and as I did not know when
to expect you, and the Health officers were on the look out, I
could not let you bring them to my house.'</p>

<p>'No, I understand,' replied the Indian, who, in point of fact,
was a Parsee doctor. 'However, they are all safe now, and nobody
knows anything about it but ourselves.'</p>

<p>At this moment, as Mrs. Pennington remarked to a neighbor, 'I
got the biggest fright I ever had in my life. Mr. Blackstone had
come to the door without my knowing it, and suddenly threw it
open. I nearly fainted.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Pennington,' says he, 'you have saved me the trouble of
calling you. I want some boiling water, if you have some, or as
near boiling as possible. Can you get me some?'</p>

<p>I found my voice, and said that the kettle was just boiling,
and went down to get it, but I daren't listen any more. Presently
the two went out together, and would you believe it, Mr.
Blackstone never came home at all that night.'</p>

<br>

<p class="cp"><i>
(The remainder of the mystery can be best told in Mrs.
Pennington's own words.)</i></p>

<p><br>
NEXT day he came home, and said, 'Mrs. Pennington, I am going
away for a week; here's the rent ahead. I am leaving that big box
behind; take great care of it, and don't shake it.'</p>

<p>'What's in it, Mr. Blackstone?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Something brittle,' he says, then shuts himself up in his
room for a while, and presently comes out with his portmanteaux
packed, and goes out and tells a boy to fetch a cab, and away he
goes.</p>

<p>Well, I can't tell you how that box preyed on my mind. I tried
every key I had, and borrowed from the neighbors, but not a one
would fit. I got desperate, and one day me and Mrs Simmonds
heaved it up and shook it. There was a strange gurgling sound
come from the inside.</p>

<p>'There's something alive,' screamed Mrs. Simmonds, and dropped
her end of the box with a crash.</p>

<p>'Now, you've done it,' I said, and as I spoke there came out
of the box the most awful smell you ever smelt. Five corpses who
had been kept a week in hot weather couldn't smell worse.</p>

<p>'It's something inside who's been murdered!' said that fool
Mrs. Simmonds, and without more ado she starts downstairs for the
street shouting murder at the top of her voice. And that other
fool Miss Tinkler joined in with her, and between them we soon
had a fine crowd and the police. Well, the police could make
nothing of it beyond the awful corpse-like smell, and so they
decided to break the box open, and had just sent for a carpenter
when Mr. Blackstone himself turned up.</p>

<p>'What's the matter?' he said.</p>

<p>'Well, we think there's a dead body in this box. It smells
uncommon like one,' said one of the police.</p>

<p>'So you've been shaking the box, have you, Mrs. Pennington?'
said he. He took out the key and unlocked the box, and the smell
that came out was something horrid, but there was nothing in the
box but a few old clothes and a half-empty bottle lying on its
side.</p>

<p>'I thought you could not resist it, Mrs Pennington,' he says,
'so I just left that bottle of potash with a loose stopper, so
that the least shake would let it out. Smells good, doesn't it?
That's the corpse.'</p>

<p>One of the policemen says, 'Why, you're Dr. Johns.'</p>

<p>'Yes. I expected a friend over from India with some plague
germs, but I was not sure when he would come, so I took this
room, where he could bring them to me quietly, without being seen
at my house. You see, the health people might kick up a row about
it. However, I've found out what I wanted to, and have destroyed
the germs, so now it does not matter. I'll make you a present of
the box and it's contents, the dead body, Mrs. Pennington,' and
the wretch went out laughing.</p>

<p>The crowd trampled down the front garden, and it was days and
days before I got the smell of that box out of the room. Neither
Mrs. Simmonds nor Miss Tinkler and I speak now.</p>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>10. &mdash; THE FRECKLETON FOUNTAIN</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 8 Jan 1898</h3>

<p class="first">
FRECKLETON, generally supposed to be so called after the
sun-kissed faces of the residents, was in a state of subdued
excitement. At 12 noon the Member for the district was going to
unveil, or declare open for public use, a drinking fountain
presented to the town by its generous and public-spirited Mayor.
Everybody was in good spirits&mdash;the Member at the chance of
displaying his eloquence; the Mayor at the public parade of his
generosity; and the general populace at the chance of a holiday,
and possibly free drinks.</p>

<p>The important hour was approaching; the band was mustering up
in its uniform, and the townsfolk beginning to assemble; when a
somewhat seedy-looking swagman came up the main street. He looked
around at the festive signs on either hand, and addressed a
passer-by with the remark: 'Seems to be some kind of a shivoo
going on here.'</p>

<p>The one addressed, glad to have a fresh listener, informed the
swagman of the importance of the approaching ceremony.</p>

<p>'And what's the name of your worthy Mayor?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Doolittle; we have hopes of seeing him a C.M.G. after this
display of his patriotism and benevolence. Why, fifty dogs have
been kept tied up all night without water, to be released
immediately after the ceremony, so that they will rush to the
fountain and revel in its sparkling waters.'</p>

<p>'Benevolent, to the dogs,' said the swagman, 'and the people
who tried to sleep.'</p>

<p>'They certainly disturbed our slumbers' somewhat, but one must
put up with a little inconvenience during a great time like
this.'</p>

<p>'I'm travelling agent for a G.M.C. myself,' said the
swagman.</p>

<p>'I don't quite understand?'</p>

<p>'Oh! G.M.C. stands for Great Magical Company.'</p>

<p>'Indeed!'</p>

<p>'Yes. I look a little down on it, I know; but wait till the
show comes along in its turnout; they're up to Dick, I can tell
you. I'm on ahead just to put up a few bills and notices and
secure a loan. Hope to see you at our show.'</p>

<p>'Possibly,' returned the other, and the two parted.</p>

<p>The stranger proceeded on his way to one of the humbler pubs,
where he deposited his swag on the verandah floor and went into
the bar. After a conference with the landlord and a display of
the necessary coin, he obtained the use of a bedroom, and took
himself and his swag there. When he emerged he had changed his
dress and much smartened himself up in every way. He carried some
posters, which he took round the town, and by permission affixed
to the walls of the various inns; and then went to the local
newspaper office and made arrangements for the insertion of a
notice in the inevitable 'special' that would come out after the
function. All this being done in a businesslike manner, he gave
himself up to leisure and curiosity, of which he displayed a good
deal.</p>

<p>The posters set forth the advent of the G.M.C., or Great
Magical Company, and their appearance ing their celebrated
divining performance, wherein the wonderful witch Desracoolas
would divine the past, and foretell the future of anyone amongst
the audience who liked to step on the stage.</p>

<p>The opening of the Fountain came off with, great <i>éclat</i>,
as the paper said afterwards. The dogs, however, were a failure.
Not knowing anything about the Fountain, they never thought of
going there when released, and instead of tumbling joyously over
each other and lapping the sparkling fluid, they capsized
buckets, invaded kitchens, bedrooms, and other places, and had a
small rampage all to themselves.</p>

<p>The Member, however, did his duty. He held a glass up between
his eye and the sun, spoke of its sparkle and purity,
then&mdash;to the intense astonishment of those who knew his
habits&mdash;drank it off. The advance agent for the G.M.C. noted
everything, and conversed with anybody and everybody who would
converse with him.</p>

<p>At about 3 o'clock the G.M.C. arrived, but truth to tell the
turnout was not so imposing as the agent had vouched for. An
overloaded trap, containing a veiled female and two men, was the
whole of the show. They drove to the room secured for their
performance by their agent at the local School of Arts, and then
pulled up. The veiled female, popularly supposed to be the witch
Desracoolas, disappeared within the doors, and the men busied
themselves with unloading the trap, and the advance agent then
took it and the two sorry steeds round to the small pub where he
had put up. Public curiosity was quenched and disappointed. The
younger people had expected a cheap show, such as the entrance of
a circus company with all its tawdry finery on; and an ordinary
dust-covered buggy did not fill the bill.</p>

<p>The Mayor entertained the Member for the district and several
leading citizens at dinner at one of the principal hotels. The
meal had to be held at 3 p.m., in consequence of the member
having to depart that evening to the distant railway station to
catch the Sydney train; it being understood, in Freckleton that
the work of Parliament was stagnated until his return. Under the
influence of something more potent than fountain water, the
Member waxed eloquent, and before leaving assured them that with
the influence he possessed they would have a railway brought to
their doors six months was over. He then complimented them, on
the beauty of their women, which considering that all were
freckled alike, was a wide stretch of imagination, and the
gallantry of their men; and departed in a buggy amidst what the
<i>Freckleton Advertiser</i> described as tumultuous cheering;
five dogs who had not been tied up all night pursuing the buggy
for nearly a quarter of a mile.</p>

<p>The Mayor returned to his domicile smiling complacently. He
was an abstemious man, and a hard one. But like most men of that
stamp, was vain and self-sufficient. The empty compliments that
had been paid him that day pleased him as much as a peerage would
have some men.</p>

<p>Mayor Doolittle of Freckleton was a great and important man in
his own estimation. He reached home and found his wife lying
down, in tears.</p>

<p>'Crying again,' he said.</p>

<p>'I can't help it; you know how I feel when I see other people
with their grown-up daughters with them, and I think of our's,
roaming about the world, perhaps, without a home or a meal. Our
only child, too.'</p>

<p>'Hold your silly tongue, woman. On a day like this to remind
me of that ungrateful slut. If she is hungry, and homeless it's
her own fault. I won't be upset by any reference to the matter.
To-day especially.'</p>

<p>He flounced out of the room, indignant at his wife reminding
him of his hard-hearted conduct towards their only daughter, whom
he had discarded on account of a poor marriage, made in defiance
of his consent. True, as he had to confess, there was nothing
against the young fellow but his poverty, and a helping, hand
would have put him on the road to competence; but that was no
palliation in his mind. It was against his autocratic will.</p>

<p>The show, such, as it was, at the School of Arts attracted a
good audience. The people of Freckleton thought that an
entertainment was a fitting wind-up to such, a day, and parted
with their shilling and two shillings cheerfully. The advance
agent stood at the receipt of customs, one man in shabby evening
dress played the much-punished School of Arts piano, and another,
also in shabby evening dress, was arranging some conjuring
properties on the table standing on the little stage. Of the
wonderful witch Desracoolas nothing could be seen; probably she
was preparing incantations somewhere.</p>

<p>The Mayor, but not the Mayoress, and other notables arrived,
and were given front seats, and the man on, the platform
announced the commencement of the performance, which would be
some wonderful feats of legerdemain. Afterwards would come the
divination and marvellous reading of the witch Desracoolas, in
the mirror of the future.</p>

<p>The feats of legerdemain were sufficiently good to please the
unsophisticated Freckletonians. Then came the divination of the
witch. The stage was prepared by removing the conjuring
properties and substituting mirror at a peculiar angle, but
visible to all the spectators.</p>

<p>Then the wonderful Desracoolas came forward shrouded in a
fancy dress, but with her face still veiled. Anyone of the
audience was then invited to step on the stage arid nave their
past revealed and their future told. At this there was much
giggling, but no one would bell the cat. At last Boosey Bill,
pot-valiant, advanced. The witch withdrew out of sight behind a
curtain, and Bill took a seat, feeling very uncomfortable at
being in such a conspicuous position. The conjuror stepped
forward and asked Bill his name, which was given in a husky voice
as William Hawkins.</p>

<p>'Desracoolas!' said the conjuror, 'do you know anything, about
this gentleman?'</p>

<p>'I do,' came a woman's voice from behind the curtain. Would
he like to hear 'something about his past?'</p>

<p>'Yes; if you like,' said Bill.</p>

<p>'Shall I say it out loud!'</p>

<p>'Oh; say it out,' said Bill.</p>

<p>'You were for some time a hard-worked Government servant.'</p>

<p>For a minute or two the slow-going wits of the Freckletonians
did not take in the small joke; then, as they remembered the
well-known fact that Boosey Bill had once served twelve months'
hard labor, they began to laugh.</p>

<p>'One moment,' said the voice. 'You are now in love, deeply in
love; would you like to see the object of your young
affections?'</p>

<p>'Yes; bring her along,' said Bill, savagely, and defiantly.
'Look in that mirror.'</p>

<p>Everybody looked on the mirror, on the surface of which
immediately appeared the reflection of a bottle of whisky. A howl
of delight greeted this palpable hit, and Bill got up
growling.</p>

<p>'Blimey! I've had enough of this,' he said, and get down off
the platform, muttering lurid imprecations, for which he was
reproved by the Mayor.</p>

<p>For some time there was much hesitation to make the second
one; but at length one young fellow, who felt conscious of a
harmless record, made the attempt, and came out of the ordeal
with honor.</p>

<p>Then the girls began to troop up, and were all mightily
astonished at being told perfectly true incidents of their pasts,
and, of course, received favorable predictions for the future.
Presently the elders tried their fate, and the oracle behind the
curtain seemed equally well acquainted with their antecedents. At
last the Mayor himself&mdash;the great man of the
day&mdash;stepped on to the dais amidst applause. He nodded
benignly when some one of his past deeds were reported to him.
Then said the voice&mdash;</p>

<p>'Would you like to see the face of the one you have most
injured during your life?'</p>

<p>'I am not aware that I ever injured anyone; but I may have had
occasion to act justly,' returned his Worship, pompously.</p>

<p>'Look on the mirror,' said the voice. All looked, and on the
surface appeared the face of a young woman, careworn and
distressed, looking with sad, pleading eyes at the Mayor of
Freckleton.</p>

<p>The Mayor started from the chair, and his face paled; whilst
throughout the audience ran a sort of universal
whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>'Maggie Doolittle!'</p>

<p>The face vanished; and the Mayor became himself again.</p>

<p>'What is this trickery?' he demanded of the conjuror. 'Who is
behind that curtain? I will see!'</p>

<p>And before the man could stop him he had lifted the curtain.
But there was no one there. Unnerved, in spite of himself, the
Mayor returned to his seat, muttering something about warrants
and police. But the performance was over. The man at the ill-used
piano struck up 'God Save the Queen,' and the audience filed out,
talking mostly about the last item in the show.</p>

<p>Mr. Doolittle went home upset and ill at ease; it seemed very
hard that, first his wife's reproachful tears, and then this
incident should have occurred to overcast the most important day
of his life. He answered his wife, when asked about the show,
that he was sorry he had attended, which was absolutely true; but
would give her no clue as to what had upset him. He thought, and
wisely, that she would hear of it soon enough in the morning from
other, sources. Nothing remains hidden in a country town.</p>

<p>He was an early riser, and strolled off to the fountain before
anyone was up to notice him, to refresh his eyes with the
inscription setting forth how it was the gift of Robert
Doolittle, Mayor of Freckleton, etc. He had had a bad night, and
was reflecting on the possibility of his actually having made a
mistake. He knew that his wife fretted and grieved continually.
In his own way he had been fond of his daughter, and&mdash;but
there he came to a full stop, he could see nothing beyond.</p>

<p>The G.M.C. were putting their belongings on their shabby buggy
as he passed the School of Arts, but he could not find it in his
heart, as yet, to return their morning greeting civilly. He
walked on home. His wife, not an early riser as a rule, was
absent. He did not ask after her, but sat down and ruminated on.
that strange and life-like face he had seen last night. How was
it done? Then he went into his breakfast-room. The meal was
neatly laid, but he missed many of the little touches his
daughter used to bestow&mdash;touches only noticed by their
absence. Then he began to wonder where his wife was. He arose and
glanced in the glass over the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>Good God! There was the face of last night.</p>

<p>He turned quickly to find his wife and daughter standing
behind him. There was an instant struggle in his heart, and then
his better self conquered. He lifted them both from their knees,
where they had fallen before him, and gave his daughter the kiss
of forgiveness.</p>

<p>'So you were the witch?' he said, after a short time had
passed. 'That accounts for your intimate acquaintance with
everybody's past life. Was your husband there?'</p>

<p>'Yes. He played the piano, so you did not notice him.'</p>

<p>'Where is he?'</p>

<p>'Not far,' said Maggie. 'Shall I bring him in?'</p>

<p>'Of course; we'll all have breakfast together. I must find you
something better to do than strolling about the country.'</p>

<p>'There's nothing to be done in town, and Will is not strong
enough for bush work.'</p>

<p>'Well bring him in.'</p>

<p><br>
'FATHER,' said Maggie, after the breakfast of reconciliation
was eaten, 'it was hearing of the fountain about to be opened

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>11. &mdash; THE REVENGE OF BANKSON'S GHOST</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 30 May 1896</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
'THERE is no fool like an old fool' was generally remarked
about old Bankson when he married a girl about a third of his
age&mdash;a pretty, and somewhat fast, society-girl of Melbourne,
and brought her up to live at his station. Most people said that
she would run away in a month, but she did nothing of the sort.
Sordid as the surroundings were for such a wealthy man as
Bankson, Mrs. Bankson had known, worse, for she had known genteel
poverty.</p>

<p>She was one of the daughters of a family desperately striving,
like many others, to keep up appearances on very limited means.
Butcher and baker might be sacrificed, but the Government House
and charity balls must be attended. This is the class of people
who write to the editor and ask him to mention the fact that 'in
our report of the fancy fair in aid of stray cats, the name of
one of the stallholders&mdash;Mrs. Dodson Smythe&mdash;was
inadvertently spelt Mrs. Dobson Smith.' Mrs. Bankson, then, was
quite clever enough to know when she was well off; and though the
life was monotonous enough, the weather trying, and the food
somewhat coarse, it was a relief to know that there were no duns
eternally rapping at the door, and no daily budget of bills by
post.</p>

<p>Cleverly, and by degrees, she worked a thorough change in the
establishment, until Bankson, much to his own surprise, found
himself growing quite a stickler for the proprieties. Needless to
say, she soon became popular everywhere, and all the fellows on
the other stations swore by her, and begged her, jokingly, if she
had a twin sister to send for her to come up on a visit.</p>

<p><br>
SO two years passed and Bankson found his married life a very
happy one, save for one thing&mdash;he recognised the disparity
in their ages, and felt inordinately jealous of her&mdash;not
that she ever gave him the least occasion for it; nor did he
outwardly show the feeling. One time he had to go down on some
business to Port Fairlight, the port of the district. When he
came back he seemed more enamored of his wife than ever, and
finally, falling sick, she nursed him with the most tender
devotion.</p>

<p>Bankson recovered; but Death had left the bruises of his
clutch upon him. He knocked about the run as usual, saw
everything in order, and then died suddenly one
night&mdash;suddenly and quietly, without a groan or sign to tell
that the departing spirit had any tale to tell before silence
smote the tongue for ever.</p>

<p>The widow's grief was calm and resigned. There were no
children, no fatherless orphans to grieve over; and he was an old
man. So there was no extravagant demonstration of grief for her
friends to sneer at and designate 'affectation.'</p>

<p>The will proved a surprise. Everything was left to his widow
on condition that she did not marry again.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
MOST people, of course, said that it was an unjust and foolish
will, especially those who longed to make eyes at the pretty
widow; and so the matter dropped. Had they seen a wild-eyed woman
pacing up and down her room, at times throwing herself on her bed
in a passionate convulsion of sorrow, they would have probably
concluded there was something more in it, especially had they
heard her scarce articulate cry of 'Will! Will! I did it all for
you, and now&mdash;now&mdash;it is useless!'</p>

<p>Mrs. Bankson, however, soon became herself again. She had made
her mind up to a certain course of conduct, and with her evident
firmness of character was carrying it steadily out. Two years
passed, during which Mrs. Bankson led a quiet and retired life,
and the station work, by the aid of a good manager, was carried
on as usual.</p>

<p>One night about this time Mrs. Bankson had a strange dream.
She dreamed that she was awakened by somebody moving about the
room, and sitting up and listening, felt sure of the fact. She
had plenty of pluck, and taking a revolver that, in her lonely
condition, she kept beneath her pillow, she was about to
challenge the intruder, when, whoever it was in the room, began
to talk and mutter.</p>

<p>It was her husband's voice!</p>

<p>For a moment the sudden beating of her heart almost choked
her. Then she regained command of herself, and remained quite
still.</p>

<p>'Oh, where is it?' moaned the voice. 'Where is it? I cannot
remember where I put it.'</p>

<p>Thus the mutterings went on, and the woman lay and listened,
so she thought, until she awoke to a sudden, outcry from the
dogs. Still full of her dream, she got out of bed, went to the
window, drew the blind aside, and looked out. The grey of dawn
was just mingling with the coming red of day; but the dogs were
now quiet, and there seemed no one stirring. Returning to her bed
she felt under the pillow, and found the revolver apparently
undisturbed during the night.</p>

<p>Several times was this dream repeated, until at last, in spite
of all, Mrs. Bankson found herself worked up into a state of
intense nervousness, and made up her mind to go away for a change
the next day. That night the dream recurred, when suddenly the
fretful, repining voice changed to one of exultation.</p>

<p>'Oh! Now I can rest at last&mdash;at last! How could I have
forgotten it. The old saddle-pouch.'</p>

<p>The presence, so the woman dreamt, came close to the bed, and
repeated once more, 'The old saddle-pouch!' Then all seemed
silent, and she awoke with a fast-beating heart and the last
words ringing in her ears. What could it all mean? What old
saddlepouch?</p>

<p>She lit her candle, and looked all round the room, but there
was nobody visible. Putting on her dressing-gown, and taking her
revolver, she went coolly and quietly to a small room occupied as
a kind of office. Here she looked about amongst some old
saddlery, and finally found two old saddle pouches. She opened
one&mdash;empty, save for a cockroach or two, at which she did
not even shudder. The second&mdash;a paper. She put her candle on
the rude desk, opened and read the paper. It was a will, in her
husband's handwriting. It revoked the former one, and left
everything to her unconditionally. The witnesses were two men,
still employed on the station, who probably did not understand
the purport of what they were signing. It seemed perfectly
valid.</p>

<p>She remained there dreaming, a happy smile on her face. Once
she murmured, 'Not in vain after all.'</p>

<p>The candle burned down, flickered, and went out; but she still
remained there until daylight came, and with it the sun. Then she
rose and returned to her room.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
THE next morning she left for the seaport, and handed the will
over to the lawyer her husband usually employed. After
examination, he assured her that the will was perfectly good. She
had taken the precaution to bring down one of the men who had
witnessed the signature of her deceased husband, so there would
be no suspicion of forgery. Haying been satisfied that the will
was good, she returned to the station, happy and light-hearted,
seeing nothing but a rosy future ahead, with her old lover for
her husband.</p>

<p>She made all her preparations for a trip to Melbourne, and was
on the point of starting&mdash;the horses were being harnessed
even, when the mailman arrived.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bankson opened the bag. Three or four station letters,
some papers, and one for herself, in her sister's handwriting.
Some time afterwards, as she did not make her appearance, the
manager went in to warn her that it was getting late.</p>

<p>She was sitting by the table, gazing straight before her. In
her hand, tightly clenched, was a letter; on the table the
contents of the mailbag. He went up and spoke to her, but she
never answered, so he ventured to put his hand on her shoulder.
She started at the touch, and asked angrily what he wanted. He
replied that it was getting late.</p>

<p>'I will be there, directly,' she replied. 'I am not sure yet
whether I shall go down or not.'</p>

<p>He took the letters from the table and left the room. Mrs.
Bankson got up and paced the floor. Then she stopped and read the
letter once more. The passage she dwelt on ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
Your old sweetheart was married the other day. He married
a little girl called Mabertey. I don't think you know her. She
was supposed to have had £20,000; but it turned out to be only
£2,000, so Master Will Halstead has been mightly sold.</p>

<br>

<p>She went down to the port as she intended, got the lawyer to
draw up a will, by which she left everything to her sisters, then
she returned to the station; and the next morning the woman found
her dead in her bed.</p>

<p><br>
DOWN in Melbourne a man is gloomily looking at an open letter.
A girl comes in to the room.</p>

<p>'What's the news, Will?' she says.</p>

<p>'Curse you; you've ruined me; that's the news,' he says, with
a savage look and tone that brings the tears to her eyes. 'My old
sweetheart, now a rich widow, is coming down, and but for you we
would be married.'</p>

<p>Bankson's ghost had the best of it after all.</p>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>12. &mdash; THE EIGHT-MILE TRAGEDY</h2>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, 14 May 1892</h3>

<h3><i>My Only Murder and Other Tales, 1899</i></h3>

<p class="first">
"THE EIGHT-MILE" was one of the finest sheets of water on the
run on the river for that matter, for it was one of the dry,
inland rivers in Western Queensland wherein the water-holes are
few and far between. It was a warm part of the world, and in
summer the broad plains through which the many-channelled stream
wound its way were full of gaping holes and cracks, and the hot
winds came across them like blasts from a stoke-hole.</p>

<p>The Eight-Mile was a favourite camping-place, and, induced by
this consideration, an individual proceeded to erect a rough
accommodation house there. He was a pallid, unhealthy-looking
man, whose pasty face contrasted strangely with the sun-blackened
complexions of the station men, and he had an unhealthy-looking
wife and was accompanied by an equally unhealthy-looking
rouseabout, who assisted in the erection of the accommodation
house.</p>

<p>The prejudice of the district was decidedly against
new-comers; as one of the men said: 'They looked too much like so
many kopsuses,' but as they all proved quiet, kept a decent
table, and were not much suspected of either sly grog-selling or
horse-stealing, they rose in public estimation, and when Butler
(for that was the man's name) enlarged his habitation and applied
for a publican's license, it was granted without much
trouble.</p>

<p>Naturally things altered Somewhat. Timothy J. Butler was
rather more self-assertive when lording it behind the bar, and
the rouseabout, promoted to be barman suddenly developed a
sporting, horsey vein hitherto unsuspected. Still Timothy B.
retained his credit. No outrageous cases of hocussing or
lambing-down were ever reported, and as he now kept a Chinese
cook and gardener and spared no pains to provide good meals, his
place was well patronised and prosperity appeared to loom
ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. Butler, however, was still a woman of mystery. Timothy
and the promoted barman grew browner in face and more genial in
their manner, but she still remained pale, silent and reserved.
If addressed she answered in the fewest possible words, and took
the first opportunity of leaving the room.</p>

<p><br>
ONE afternoon there was a goodly number of people assembled at
Tim's, as the place was now known. Three teams were camped at the
waterhole, some of the men from the neighbouring station were
down, and a traveller or two were staying there. A few of the
boys were playing quoits with horse-shoes, some were pitching
competition yarns, and the balance talking horse with the barman.
At this juncture a stranger rode up to the place. He was a
big-boned, black-bearded man with enormous feet and hands. He was
riding a miserably poor, knocked-up horse which fairly staggered
when his rider dismounted, with some difficulty extricating his
large feet from the stirrups.</p>

<p>Mrs. Butler was just coming into the verandah when the
new-comer alighted, but at sight of him she beat a hasty
retreat.</p>

<p>"Good day to yez all," said the stranger in a rich brogue, as
he glanced around, and then, as Butler appeared, he gave a shout,
and exclaimed: "And 'tis yerself, Tim, ould man, after all,
then!"</p>

<p>Tim, however, did not appear to reciprocate the effusive
greeting of his friend, but he treated him civilly, sent the
black boy to hobble the wretched horse out on the nearest bit of
feed, and asked his guest in. The stranger drew one of his huge
hands across his mouth and followed with alacrity. Public opinion
in the verandah decided that he was an ex-policeman and a
new-chum in the bush.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon Tim mentioned the stranger as
his brother-in-law, John Dwyer, It was noticeable that he spoke
of him as John, not the more familiar Jack, although Dwyer
affectionately dubbed him Tim at every opportunity. Mrs. Butler
did not appear as usual to dispense the tea from the big tin
teapot at the evening meal, and the only person who seemed elated
at the visit was Dwyer himself. He was in high good-humour,
"shouted" for everybody who would drink with him, as though the
place belonged to him; and, after an uproarious carouse, fell
asleep with his head under the table and his legs dangling over a
form.</p>

<p>From that time forth Tim's was an altered place. Dwyer, who
appeared to be in his proper element, lolled behind the bar from
morning till night, and his broad fingers were continually
clutching a whisky-bottle. Trade fell off, for his assertive ways
disgusted everybody, high and low, master and man, and much
wonder was expressed that Butler stood it.</p>

<p>There came an end, however, to his patience. It was soon
rumoured that Butler wanted to sell out, and as the district had
increased in importance during his sojourn in it, he was not long
without a suitable offer. He accepted it, and it was soon known
that Mr. Dwyer had departed without beat of drum. Shortly
afterwards the Butlers and their faithful henchman left, and the
new people entered into possession.</p>

<p><br>
THREE months had elapsed since Tim's&mdash;by which name it
was, and probably is still, known&mdash;had changed hands, and
three or four teams had turned out at the Eight-Mile to camp. It
was only about 2 o'clock, and the black boy, bucket and billy in
hand, went down to the water-hole to bring up water. The men who
were unyoking were suddenly startled by flying footsteps, and a
scared nigger rushed into their midst with the astounding
assertion that an alligator was in the water-hole.</p>

<p>Big Bob elevated his tall, sinewy frame, six foot four in his
bare feet, and accompanied by his mates strode down the track. On
the surface of the water floated a remarkable-looking object.</p>

<p>The men gazed in silence for some time,</p>

<p>"If it was possible," said Big Bob at last, "I should say
those were Dwyer's feet." He flicked his bullock whip at it, but
it fell short. "Lend us a lash," he said.</p>

<p>One of the men unbent his whip from the keeper and handed it
to him. He fastened it on to his own, made a noose at the end,
and with one skilful east sent it over the strange object and
towed it ashore.</p>

<p>It was Dwyer's feet, and there was a body attached to it. A
horrible body, so bloated in places, so shrunken in others, so
mutilated by fish, so unlike anything human, and yet still
bearing a horrid likeness of humanity about it, that some of the
men retired.</p>

<p>With the aid of another whip, Big Bob and two or three others
got the thing on to the bank. A bag full of stones had been tied
to it, but the fastenings had parted and the corpse had come to
the surface.</p>

<p>"We camped here a fortnight ago," said Big Bob, looking at the
others.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply. They were on the up-trip then, now they
were returning empty.</p>

<p>"And," said Bob, solemnly, "we made our tea and our bread of
this water, and boiled our beef in it. By&mdash;&mdash;, if ever
I catch Butler, I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>Words failed him here.</p>

<p>Everybody put it down to Butler, but no trace of him could be
discovered. No marks of violence were found on the body; Dwyer's
hands and feet had been tied together, probably when he was in a
drunken stupor, and so he had been chucked into the
waterhole.</p>

<p>"I'll never forgive him," said Big Bob.</p>

<p>"Why the devil didn't he bury him?"</p>

<p>"Too many niggers about," replied his mate. "Bound to have
tracked him up out of sheer curiosity." Which was true, as a camp
of blacks had established themselves near the place. There were
some startling telegrams in the metropolitan papers, and a
verdict of wilful murder against Timothy Butler; but that was
all.</p>

<p><br>
I WAS jackerooing on the next station, at the time, and ten
years afterwards accidentally heard the "rights" of Dwyer's
fate.</p>

<p>It came about in this way. I was in Sydney walking down
George-street; at that time the totalisators were in full and
open swing, and one fellow who was standing in the street taking
a customer's name, was knocked down by a cab. I recognised his
white face as they lifted him up; it was Butler's barman. I
called at the hospital next morning and found that he had been
badly injured and could not possibly live. He recognised me, and
presently told me about Dwyer.</p>

<p>Butler and he, it seems, had been mixed up in a swindling
racing transaction, which, connected as it was with the
suspicious death of a man, made a great stir at the time.</p>

<p>Butler and the ex-barman got eight years over it. Mrs. Butler
had secreted most of the money, and, by bribing Dwyer, then a
warder, the two escaped. They made out back to the most
uncivilised part they could find, and were doing well by honest
means when Dwyer, who had lost his billet, tracked them down and
established himself at free quarters. He was ruining the business
and Butler, despairing of ever getting free from his incubus, got
rid of him in the way mentioned. The Butlers, it seems, had since
gone to America, and their accomplice died a few days after he
told me the story.</p>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>13. &mdash; WHAT PUZZLED BALLADUNE</h2>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, 12 May 1894</h3>

<h3><i>My Only Murder and Other Tales</i>, 1899</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
STRANGERS were uncommon in Balladune, a small township in
Western Queensland, though once upon a time the residents had
indulged in hopeful visions of a railway, and locomotives
dragging thither long trains of carriages full of opulent
passengers with much money to spend. Of course this prospective
railway was not to go past Balladune, which was to remain for
ever the terminus, and wax fat in consequence. But these fond
hopes were born but to die young. Trade, somehow, drifted further
away, and the coming railway never came. Those who had
speculatively invested in town lots were unable to realise, and
Balladune settled down, discontentedly enough, to stagnation and
a weekly coach.</p>

<p>Balladune, therefore, presented no attractions for strangers
to visit it. Attempts had indeed been made, on more than one
occasion, to institute half-yearly races and a pastoral show, but
they came to nothing. The coach-fares, even kept away any poor
players who might otherwise have sought to rake in a scanty
hay-crop in the back-blocks, and the arrival of the said coach
was the one local distraction.</p>

<p>It was therefore with mingled surprise and admiration that the
inhabitants, who systematically turned out in force on these
occasions, saw a stout, pleasant-faced, well-dressed gentleman
alight from the box-seat.</p>

<p>The coachman, upon being at once interviewed, stated that he
believed the passenger had come up by train to Mount Bastion, the
hated rival town which had cut them out with the railway; and
that, so far as he was concerned, he found him a thundering good
sort, and he wished he always had one of the same brand on the
box with him. Of the stranger's business&mdash;he knew absolutely
nothing.</p>

<p>It was generally felt that the coachman had failed
disgracefully in his duty, but as he was too important a
personage to offend, nobody told him to. It was also considered
that the senior constable, who had charge of the peace of the
township, should keep a strict eye upon the stranger, as in these
days of levanting financial, there was no knowing where one might
turn up.</p>

<p>When, however, the pound-keeper suggested that in that case a
man of noticeable presence would seek a crowded place where he
would not be an object of popular interest, public opinion veered
somewhat, and it was agreed that (a general election being then
pending) the stranger was going to run for a seat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the gentleman under discussion, who gave the
hotel-keeper the somewhat well-known name of John Smith, did
nothing to indicate a desire to represent the district or
otherwise throw light upon the burning question of the day. What
had brought him to Balladune? He chatted affably on the weather,
the diet and the fall in silver, but not one word escaped by
which he could be "placed." In appearance he was equally
non-committal. He could have been anybody, from a retired
publican to an ex-Governor.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith made but little use of the telegraph during his
stay. Possibly he laboured under the absurd, though common
delusion that telegrams in a small township soon become public
property; anyhow, he did not utilise the wire, but on the return
mail after his arrival despatched a bulky, sealed epistle, duly
registered, which, on being eagerly scrutinised by the
postmistress, was found to bear the simply maddening address,
"John Smith, Esq., Box 009, G.P.O., Sydney."</p>

<p>"I could have smacked his face," said the disappointed lady to
an equally curious and disappointed friend who agreed that it
was a shame and should not be allowed; for her part she did not
believe that there were two John Smiths in Australia.</p>

<p>Meantime, as Mr. Smith paid his bill and simply smoked, read
and chatted about the season in a most exemplary manner, the
landlord of the Royal Hotel resented any impertinent prying,
fearing it might annoy his guest and lose him that rare bird of
passage, a profitable customer. Mr. Smith, therefore, was, or
pretended to be, in ignorance of the burning curiosity he had
aroused in the minds of the Balladune gossips.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
FIFTEEN miles from Balladune was one of the few stations which
assisted to prevent the utter abandonment of that struggling
township. It was not a large and flourishing station with
artesian water, shearing-machines, a big overdraft, and all the
proper equipments of high-class grazing. The owner had worked
hard on it himself ever since the district was first settled. He
had experienced bad and good times, had suffered from drought and
flood, had hung on through all with the grim pertinacity of his
nature, and now, in spite of the fallen value of stock and
stations, was still clear of debt.</p>

<p>He was a gaunt and grizzled man, by name Hemmings. A man who
neither spared himself nor his men. The wandering swagman met
with but a snarling reception, and his dole of begrudged rations
was thrown to him with contempt. As Hemmings' neighbours were
treated with little more hospitality, the owner of Red Dyke was
by no means popular.</p>

<p>Still, in a certain way, he was much respected. He dealt for
his stores locally, and spent what little he did spend in the
district. He was scrupulously honest, and, above all, his word,
for good or evil, was inviolable. So far as was known, he had
neither friends nor relations. Imagine, then, the surprise of the
inhabitants of Balladune when he drove into the township, pulled
up at the Royal, and demanded to see the mysterious Mr.
Smith.</p>

<p>When the two met it was noticed that, although Mr. Smith was
beamingly genial in his greeting, Hemmings did not reciprocate.
But this was according to his well-known disposition.</p>

<p>"We cannot say all we have to say here, without having some
long-eared gaby on his knees at the keyhole; you had better come
out to my place and stop the night," said the visitor.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith nodded a cheery assent, then slowly drew his finger
and thumb round his throat, and, with a waggish smile, remarked,
"It is safe, I presume?"</p>

<p>The other scowled silently and strode out to his buggy. Smith
went up to his room and in less than a minute descended, joined
him, and they drove off.</p>

<p>Everyone who had the price of a drink on him went into the bar
to discuss the event, still mere strange than even the coming of
Mr. Smith himself.</p>

<p>"Mark my words," said the pound keeper, who professed to have
made a study of human nature, "there's no love lost on the side
of that Hemmings, and it licks me what a simple, affable chap
like Smith can have to do with him."</p>

<p>"I've got it," said the storekeeper, smiting the counter.
"That's a deep cove, that Smith, for all he's a good-natured one.
He's a detective, that's what he is, and he's just gone out to
Red Dyke to take Hemmings quietly without any scandal. When he
went upstairs," he added, in impressive tones, "it was to slip
the handcuffs in his pocket."</p>

<p>Everyone finished his drink in solemn silence, the idea was so
novel and entrancing.</p>

<p>"Wonder what he's done?" said one open-mouthed lounger at
last.</p>

<p>"You may be bound," went on the storekeeper, encouraged by his
success, "that it was done years and years ago, most likely in
some other country."</p>

<p>This was delightful. Why, it might be another Deeming tracked
down.</p>

<p>"He sent a note out to Red Dyke yesterday, said the
landlord.</p>

<p>"And you never told us!" cried a reproachful chorus.</p>

<p>"Come," said the pound keeper, who had been silenced for a
while. "If he is a detective which I don't say he ain't, would he
have sent out a note to tell Hemmings he was here?"</p>

<p>This was beyond the reasoning powers of the conclave, and even
the storekeeper left the question unanswered.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
THE two men in the buggy were silent for some time. After
leaving the township the road passed for some miles through a
dark and barren scrub.</p>

<p>Smith uttered the first remark:</p>

<p>"I was unexpected, I presume?"</p>

<p>"I have never left off expecting you."</p>

<p>"I suppose if a body were deposited a mile or two back in this
scrub&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Before it was found it would be unrecognisable, and put down
to some foot-traveller who had lost himself and died of
thirst."</p>

<p>"Ah! So much better than burying."</p>

<p>"Quite true," replied the other, who seemed to force himself
by strong effort to answer coolly the gibing remarks of his
companion.</p>

<p>"Burying is clumsy, but you have not come here to discuss such
questions?"</p>

<p>"I have not. I have come to claim the fulfilment of your
word."</p>

<p>"After twenty years?" asked Hemmings, in a firm tone.</p>

<p>"After twenty years," repeated Smith, in a tone as firm.</p>

<p>There was silence once more, and, in a short while, the buggy
emerged on a track of open country, grateful to the eye after the
close scrub.</p>

<p>"Supposing we defer further conversation until we reach
home&mdash;at least, what I now call home? I will fulfil my
word."</p>

<p>The other nodded, and not a word more was uttered until the
station was reached.</p>

<p>There was little to recommend the place to any one with an eye
to comfort or beauty, for the buildings were rude, and Hemmings,
in his love of loneliness, had built his own house at some
distance from the others; but an expert would at once have
recognised the value of the grazing country. Hemmings drove up to
an outhouse and they dismounted and walked up. When they stood on
the verandah, Smith, all whose geniality had departed, turned and
looked round.</p>

<p>"You have been alone here for&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I have been here fifteen years. Alone&mdash;for
thirteen."</p>

<p>"Mrs.&mdash;ah&mdash;Hemmings then?"</p>

<p>"Lies buried there. The rough life and climate killed
her."</p>

<p>"The property is unencumbered, I understand?"</p>

<p>"The property, such as it is, is unencumbered. Listen! I have
gone through such hardships on this place, have fought against
famine and the elements so fiercely, knowing all the while that
at any time the summons from you might come; that I tell you I
love it, by the very memory of my sufferings." His voice, which
had not faltered when he spoke of the death of the woman who
should have been, but was not, his wife, trembled at the
remembrance of his years of toil.</p>

<p>"I give you your choice. You demand the fulfilment of my vow.
I will mortgage this place to the hilt, and work it free once
more with this"&mdash;and he held forth his brown and sinewy
hand&mdash;"or take a change of clothes and a blanket and leave
you here, to wander forth in the world. I ask you but one favour,
Farrars, give me your answer quickly."</p>

<p>The other kept silence for a few moments; then, as if to
change the subject, said:</p>

<p>"My name is Smith, just now, as yours is now Hemmings. I will
give you my answer early to-morrow morning. Meanwhile&mdash;not
that I mistrust you, in spite of all&mdash;I may mention that
yesterday I posted to a safe hand a notification of my presence
here, and my motive in coming. It will be read if a fortnight
elapses without hearing from me, so that, even if you deposit my
body in that convenient scrub, I shall soon be missed."</p>

<p>The other waved his hand as though the idea was too
contemptuous for serious discussion; then he motioned his
unwelcome guest inside and showed him to a rudely-furnished
bedroom. "My accommodation is but limited," he remarked, "but as
you come of your own accord you must be content with it."</p>

<p>"I shall be satisfied," returned Smith. "I have fared worse
since the smash."</p>

<p>"You are then ruined?"</p>

<p>"Or I should not be here."</p>

<p>"I had thought better of you. If your coming had been only
inspired by the desire for just vengeance I could have understood
it; as it is I must despise the feeling to which you
confess."</p>

<p>"I intend to combine business and&mdash;pleasure," was the
calm reply.</p>

<p><br>
IT was midnight before Smith, who had retired early, fell into
a troubled sleep on his hard bed almost immediately to awake
again. Someone moving in the house had aroused him. In spite of
his protestations of confidence his hand stole under his pillow.
He listened, and the sound he heard made him arise noiselessly
and steal on to the verandah.</p>

<p>In the brilliant moonlight stood Hemmings gazing out on the
familiar scene, the rugged outlines of which not even the silver
rays could soften or beautify. But it was his. He had come there
when the land was a wilderness, had seen the country alter and
become fruitful under his care. He had defied sickness, the
brazen sky and the devastating storm to dispossess him. It had
been to him a refuge from the past and his fellow men. Smith
watched the tall, lean figure shaken with emotion, then he spoke
sternly:</p>

<p>"Walters&mdash;for I will call you by your own name&mdash;I
came here only on an errand of vengeance, to turn you forth
naked. I am not a ruined man. Let me speak," for the other would
have interrupted. "Nearly 20 years ago you stole my wife from me.
You made a fatal mistake. You allowed her, or she did it without
your knowledge to take both money and jewels in her flight. I
could have cast you into prison branded as a thief. But you know,
and I admit, that in the encounter between us you spared my life.
Then you swore that at any future time when I demanded it you
would strip yourself of all your possessions and give them up to
me in tenfold payment of that of which I had been robbed. I knew
your character knew you would keep the vow, although a poor man
when you made it, and I thought that it would be sweet vengeance
to come unexpectedly upon you and demand fulfilment. I have come
and what have I found? One sleeps beneath that mound under a name
she has no right to&mdash;dead, I doubt not, of the remorse which
would be stimulated by your solitary life in this waste. You, the
other one, a younger man than I, look ten years older. You have
not a friend in the world; here you will live and die without a
companion but those whose services you hire. I am amply revenged.
Keep your lonely acres out here. I give you back your
promise."</p>

<p>He paused. The dark figure against the moonlit sky said
nothing, but put its hands up to it's face.</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning," went on the other quietly relapsing into
his natural tone, "send a man to drive me into the township, for
you and I must never look on each other again." He turned and
re-entered his room.</p>

<p>The Balladune people have never yet accounted for the visit of
Mr. Smith.</p>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>14. &mdash; TOMMY'S GHOST</h2>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, 22 Feb 1890</h3>

<h3><i>My Only Murder and Other Tales</i>, 1899</h3>

<p class="first">
TOMMY came back from the township full to the chin, and, in
addition, brought two bottles of rum with him. He began to talk
long before he got in sight of the hut, where he lived with
George, another stockman, and old Ben, who cooked for them. So
reprehensibly careless was he in getting off his horse when he
did arrive that only for the presence of mind of old Ben the two
bottles would assuredly have been smashed. Ben, however,
thoughtfully saved the bottles and let Tommy fall, instead of
doing as a new-chum would have done&mdash;saving Tommy and
letting the bottles fall. George took the saddle off his horse,
and Tommy subsided on to his bunk and went off smiling
peacefully.</p>

<p>"Doesn't seem to have touched them," said Ben, examining the
two bottles carefully, whilst George got a couple of
pannikins.</p>

<p>"I expect he had another one with him," suggested George,
after they had taken a swill at the water-bag and each had sighed
deeply.</p>

<p>"What! and drank the whole blessed lot of it!" cried Ben, with
an air of the deepest and most awful disgust.</p>

<p>George nodded. "Think he'd have come all the way without a
nip?" he retorted, with conviction in his voice.</p>

<p>Ben looked more than convinced. "The mean little dog! Hang it
all, we'll run his track back in the morning to make sure.
Perhaps he dropped the other bottle," he added, hopefully.</p>

<p>George shook his head as he refilled his pannikin and passed
the bottle to Ben. "Might be some left in it, perhaps," he
hazarded.</p>

<p>Then they both sat down for a while, filled their pipes and
looked with disdain on the snoring culprit.</p>

<p>Presently Ben got the tea ready, and after an appetiser the
two sat down to their meal. In the middle of it Tommy woke up and
demanded a drink, and George promptly supplied him with water.
But this was not all to Tommy's taste,&mdash;rum was what he
wanted.</p>

<p>The two looked doubtfully at each other: such a pity to waste
good liquor on a man incapable of appreciating it. Then Ben rose
to the occasion. He took the rum-bottle and poured a mere trifle
in a pannikin, then he put in a fair allowance of cold tea from a
billy that had been standing since dinner-time. Tommy drank it
and was content, there was the colour and smell of rum about it,
and that was enough; he subsided again.</p>

<p>After the decks had been cleared George and the cook sat down
to a game of euchre, and were just enjoying the first nip out of
the second bottle when Tommy commenced to make himself a nuisance
again, and this time no amount of cold tea would satisfy him.</p>

<p>"Hang the little beggar!" said George at last, after putting
him back in his bunk fur the third time; "I'll tie him down."</p>

<p>"That's it," said Ben, "then we can have our game in
 peace."</p>

<p>George got the greenhide leg-rope and between them they took
two good turns right round Tommy, bunk and all, pinioning his
arms to his side. Having made all fast with two half-hitches they
returned to their unfinished game, leaving Tommy to howl and
swear horribly, of which permission he took the fullest
advantage.</p>

<p>"What do you say?" said Ben when they were about to turn in,
and he meditatively regarded the last half of the second bottle
which they had agreed to keep until the morning; "shall we give
him one and then untie him?" Tommy had been quiet for some time
and George looked at him critically.</p>

<p>"He might be foxing, you know, and get up when we were asleep
and' polish all this off, no matter where we plant it."</p>

<p>"And if he didn't find it he might get the horrors and knock
one of us on the head when we were asleep," said Ben.</p>

<p>"Just so. I'll stop awake and untie him in about an hour's
time," suggested George.</p>

<p><br>
THIS they both agreed was the very best plan, but,
unfortunately, the rum was potent, and, although George meant to
stop awake to watch Ben in order to see he didn't tap the
morning's supply, and Ben meant to do the same with Bob, they had
no sooner laid down than both were fast asleep at once and the
sun up an hour before they awoke.</p>

<p>"Tommy's very quiet," said Ben, "look how he's twisted his
head over the bunk?"</p>

<p>George went over to him, lifted his head back, and untied the
leg-rope; then, his eyes having got some of the sleep out of
them, he looked a little closer.</p>

<p>"Yow!" he yelled, "He's dead!"</p>

<p>"Be hanged!" roared George, rushing over. There was no doubt
about it, and the unfortunate little fellow must have died of
apoplexy.</p>

<p>One looked piteously at the other, and then, with shaking
hands, they sought out the half bottle, and after a couple of
stiff drinks felt a little more courage. The next question was,
what was to be done?</p>

<p>Go into the head station and report, and say nothing about the
rope business. Agreed <i>nem. con.</i>.</p>

<p>George went down the paddock for a couple of horses, and Ben
carefully waited outside the hut until he returned. Then they
saddled up and started to ride in the ten miles leaving poor
Tommy dead on the bunk.</p>

<p>Naturally there was consternation at the head station, and the
super, who was a J.P., started back with the two survivors,
accompanied by a jackeroo who owned a prayer-book, to inspect and
inter poor Tommy. Still greater was the consternation when they
arrived at the out-station for there was no Tommy to inter. The
corpse had disappeared. In vain Ben and George pointed to the
bunk as if that was sufficient proof of Tommy's decease. The
super was not to be convinced; the whole thing was a drunken
spree, and in high wrath he gave the culprits a week to clear out
or find Tommy, and departed home.</p>

<p>Ben and George sat and looked at each other, and the situation
was beyond them; they smoked sullenly till darkness came before
they thought of turning to get some tea. Then Ben went to work to
light a fire and George picked up the bucket and went down to the
creek for water.</p>

<p>Ben was busy fanning the smoky embers with his hat, when he
heard a yell of terror that nearly took the roof off the hut,
then came the sounds of flying feet towards the place. Ben's
heart stood still, but his presence of mind did not desert him.
With great pluck and promptitude he slammed the door in the face
of George and his pursuer, and left them to fight it out
outside.</p>

<p>In vain George beat frantically at the slabs and appealed for
help. Ben was adamant. "If the devil takes it out of George he'll
let me off," he thought. But despair made George desperate, and
he burst the door in at length and appeared with his face full of
terror and his hands full of splinters.</p>

<p>"Tommy's ghost!" was all he could exclaim, "tackled me at the
creek and beat me up here with a leg-rope."</p>

<p>Ben trembled with horror, and they both looked helplessly at
each other. "Listen," whispered George, "he's coming!"</p>

<p><br>
STEPS were certainly approaching, and, trembling with fright,
the two crouched under the furthest bunk, which certainly was not
the one where Tommy died. The fire had now burnt up bright and
clear and, to their horror, the hidden pair saw the corpse of
poor Tommy walk into the hut. The apparition stalked over to the
fire and, to their added horror, they noticed that it carried a
bottle of rum under its arm. The ghost looked sternly round, and
the guilty ones wondered that it did not hear the drops of sweat
pattering off their foreheads to the ground. At last it seemed to
find what it wanted&mdash;a pannikin&mdash;but a further search
revealed no water, and, with a sigh of heartfelt relief, they
watched it depart towards the creek. They stole out, moist with
fear and spoke in whispers.</p>

<p>"Shall we hook it before it comes back?"</p>

<p>"It might catch us in the dark&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ooh! here it is again," and there in the doorway stood the
ghost, sternly contemplating them. It raised the pannikin to its
lips, drained it, and then, shaking the rum-bottle at the
trembling couple, said, tauntingly, in sepulchral tones: "Not one
blooming drop shall you coves have, if you've got your tongues
out a yard for it." Then Ben rose to the occasion. He always did.
He smelt the rum, and he knew a ghost ought to smell of
brimstone.</p>

<p>"It's Tommy alive, after all!" he cried.</p>

<p>And so it appeared. He had come to himself after they left,
and, inspired and upheld by a diabolical thirst of forty
alligator power, he had followed his tracks back and found the
lost bottle full. Returning to the hut and finding no water in it
he had gone to the creek, and, after a good swig, had fallen
asleep again until aroused by George coming down with the
bucket.</p>

<p>They squared it with the super, somehow, but they never trust
Tommy in the township alone now.</p>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>15. &mdash; MRS. STAPLETON NO. 2</h2>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, 20 Apr 1893</h3>

<h3><i>My Only Murder and Other Tales</i>, 1899</h3>

<p class="first">
THE deceased Mrs. Stapleton had been always noted as slightly
the better horse of the team, and I am afraid matters were not
improved by some of Stapleton's wild and unthinking friends, who,
because he became pot-valiant in his cups, would seduce him into
that condition and then send him home to defy the late Mrs.
Stapleton.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these outbreaks of bravado always resulted in
Stapleton's protracted seclusion from the public gaze. Cuts and
bruises don't easily heal on the man who "nips."</p>

<p>To everyone's astonishment, however, Stapleton took the loss
greatly to heart. He shunned company, went about in deep
mourning, and vowed that his heart was buried in his wife's
grave.</p>

<p>It was at this period that he met that interesting little
widow, Mrs. Beausant, who had buried her husband and her heart
just about the time when Mrs. Stapleton died. There was a good
deal of sympathy between them, and they entertained one another
with long eulogiums on the respective dears-departed. They even
went in company to the respective cemeteries, and each
complimented the other on the taste displayed in the matter of
tombstones. Death is a weird thing. Love is weirder still.</p>

<p>"Had my darling but survived me," said Stapleton, "this is
exactly the stone I should have dreamt of her
selecting"&mdash;indicating the ponderous block of marble which
held down the remains of the defunct Beausant.</p>

<p>"And," said the little widow, as they gazed at the tomb of the
gone-before Mrs. Stapleton, "if my angel had lived to bury me,
this is just the tribute he would have paid to his."</p>

<p>Such a mingling of tears could lead but to one result. They
agreed to comfort each other, and proceeded to do so.</p>

<p>The marriage promised to turn out happily, and Stapleton soon
resumed his former habits and became a jolly dog once more. One
midnight he reached home in a state of obfuscation; so confused
was he that next morning he remembered nothing about his arrival.
However, there he was in his own bed "with a head on him."</p>

<p>He crept out, went over to the glass, and examined his face.
Not a mark on it! Mrs. Stapleton, No. 2, had not served him as
had been the wont of Mrs. Stapleton, No. 1. He slipped into bed
again, just as his wife appeared.</p>

<p>"Well, ducky," she said. "How's its little head this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" thought Stapleton, "What a lucky dog I am! I
must take advantage of this. No weakness, now," he groaned,
dismally.</p>

<p>"Could you get me some brandy and soda, cold, old girl? Selina
(No. 1) always had some ready for me."</p>

<p>Now, the fact was, that Selina used not only to give him no
cold soda and brandy&mdash;but she used to bang him soundly and
take away his clothes, so that he could not go out to get
any.</p>

<p>"Yes, lovey," said the model No. 2; "he shall have it iced,"
and she left the room.</p>

<p>Stapleton almost capered about in anticipation of the glorious
times he would have with such an obedient spouse.</p>

<p>Little No. 2 came back with some brandy and iced soda; then
she brought him in an appetising breakfast of devilled kidney,
hot toast and strong tea, and after he had consumed it and taken
a tub, he felt a new man. How much better this was than being
locked up with yesterday's paper and a black-eye!</p>

<p>"No weakness," he murmured to himself. "I must keep this up;"
and I regret to say that he did. Instead of showing his gratitude
for such a jewel of a wife by trying to reform, he seemed to
consider that he had taken out a license for bad behaviour.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stapleton No. 2 was a plump, pleasing little woman of
about six-or-seven and twenty, who never showed that she
possessed any temper at all, despite the airs Stapleton now began
to assume&mdash;for there is no worse tyrant than your
emancipated slave. One evening he got home early, and, on
entering the drawing-room, found his wife just bidding farewell
to a good-looking middle-aged man, who, without taking the
slightest notice of him, put his arm round Mrs. Stapleton's waist
and gave her several hearty kisses, to which she made no
objection. The utter coolness of the proceeding so paralysed the
husband that he did not find voice for anything but a half-choked
yell of rage ere the stranger had left the house. Then his wife
turned to him and smilingly remarked; "What a nice man Captain
Johnson is, I do love him so!"</p>

<p>The yell now broke forth in dead earnest.</p>

<p>"You wretched woman!" he shouted, dancing about the room, "How
dare you! Leave my house!"</p>

<p>"Why, Charley, what's the matter?" she cried, in mock
surprise.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? A man kisses her before my face and she
asks me what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Why, Charley, surely you don't mind that. Beausant didn't
mind it."</p>

<p>"Beausant didn't mind men kissing you before his face!"</p>

<p>"No, not if they liked it," she returned, blushing coyly.</p>

<p>"Not if they liked it!" he sneered. "And I suppose they often
liked it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am afraid they did."</p>

<p>"And how often has Captain Johnson been to see you,
madam?"</p>

<p>"Oh! only sometimes when you've left me alone."</p>

<p>"And" (sarcastically) "anybody else?"</p>

<p>"Just a few nice fellows."</p>

<p>Stapleton shook his fist wildly and plunged for his hat.</p>

<p>"Charley," she cried "what is the matter? Poor Beausant never
found fault with me. Oh you are cruel!" and she shed a few bitter
tears.</p>

<p>"Madam, I am going to consult my lawyer."</p>

<p>"But, Charley dear, dinner will be ready directly,
and&mdash;he's left his office by this time."</p>

<p><br>
THE door banged behind Stapleton, and the next moment he was
nerving himself for the ordeal by draining a bumper of Dutch
courage. It did him good, and he tried another. Then a friend
came in and they took a drink together; other potations followed,
and Stapleton began to bemoan his fate and vow he would never go
home again. But he did; he got home somehow and awoke with at
least three heads on him. Nobody came near him now; there was no
brandy and cold soda. He called the servant and asked after his
wife. She had gone out. Where? To the races. This was a
staggerer. It was nearly 11 o'clock; he would get up and see
about it. He dressed and descended. The girl brought him some
breakfast&mdash;cold mutton and weak tea! Ugh! he put on his hat
and went out. This time he did go to the lawyer's&mdash;but the
lawyer, he found, had likewise gone to the races.</p>

<p>Stapleton passed a sad day, and when Mrs. S. came home at
nearly seven o'clock, radiant and smiling, he was fairly boiling
with wrath.</p>

<p>"Well, Charley." she said. "I had a splendid day. I hope Mary
looked after you properly!"</p>

<p>"Mary did not look after me properly. I have had a most
miserable headache all day. Your heartless conduct&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not at all, Charley&mdash;yesterday's whisky, and no little
wifey to doctor him up as Selina used to do."</p>

<p>"Selina, madam, knew how to behave herself. She did not allow
men to kiss her."</p>

<p>The trouble was that no man would have cared to kiss
Selina.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stapleton laughed. "Charley, a fair thing is a fair
thing. I've tried to act up to the memory of the departed Selina.
Why can't you imitate the lamented Beausant?"</p>

<p>"Because! Because! Because I won't&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>"Then I won't nurse you up any more when you take too much
overnight."</p>

<p>The worm had turned.</p>

<p>"You'd better make a bargain, and if you promise to be a good
boy in future, I won't let any fresh men kiss me," she
continued.</p>

<p>"I'll take care of that, madam, or at least my lawyer
will."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stapleton laughed gaily. "Now, Charlie, behave yourself
for the future, and I'll do the same. Not that I've done anything
very dreadful yet, for Captain Johnson&mdash;as I called
him&mdash;is my brother Dick from up-country, who's been here to
meet you several times, but you were always out with your
friends, getting&mdash;well, drunk. He was in the house once when
you came home, but you had taken too much whisky to see him."</p>

<p>Stapleton is now as reformed a character as Tommy Walker.</p>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>16. &mdash; A TRADITION OF THE MACARTHUR RIVER</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 6 Jun 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
THAT was a wild goose chase, and I tried hard to dissuade
Parker from going; but the blacks had brought in such detailed
particulars that he was determined on testing the truth of their
tale. It was on a newly formed cattle station on the Upper
Macarthur, and Packer was in charge. We had not very much to do;
the cattle had settled down, and the season was a good, one; so
we were principally occupied in exploring the run.</p>

<p>Now the niggers had brought in a yarn&mdash;and stuck to
it&mdash;that, among a tribe who lived in the mass of broken
ranges between us and the overland telegraph line, there was an
old, old white man living with the blacks. According to their
statement, he had been amongst the tribe as long as they could
remember; and was now so aged and feeble that he could only crawl
about by the aid of two short sticks. They indicated the way his
back was bent, and how he looked like an animal on four legs,
when walking.</p>

<p>All these circumstantial particulars impressed Parker with the
idea that there was some admixture of truth in the report, and he
determined to investigate it. I was not by any means so cock-sure
on the matter. I had heard of the supposed existence of Klassen,
the second in charge of Leichhardt's party, in many parts of
Australia, and I had also heard the blacks minutely describe
events which toad never happened. However, I consented in go, and
accompanied by a native belonging to the country, we started,
intending to be away only a week or ten days. It was more than a
month before one of us saw the station again.</p>

<p>After leaving the good country which extended some miles back
from the river, we came to a formidable range about 4 o'clock in
the afternoon. It was nothing but barren, naked sandstone, and as
we did not care about tackling it at that time in the day, we
turned back and followed down a small creek heading from the
range, wherein we were lucky enough to find a little water and
sufficient grass for camping purposes. Next morning early we
scrambled up the range.</p>

<p>From the top we got a wide view to the westward, but it was by
no means a prepossessing one. Far as we could see was a jumble of
broken country. In the distance, almost due west, one fantastic,
square-topped hill rose high against the horizon. Mutually,
Parker and I came to the conclusion to make for that hill. I may
mention here that the native we had with us was taken simply as a
possible interpreter. As a guide he was useless, for the tribe of
blacks we were in search of were avowedly at enmity with their
neighbors, and allowed no trespassing on their hunting
grounds.</p>

<p>It was a terribly rough journey that day, and early in the
afternoon we were glad to turn out beside a big water hole in a
river which cut its way through a spinifex tableland. We were
still some distance from the square-topped mountain; but
evidently the country was thickly populated, for the tracks of
the natives and their old camps were to be seen everywhere. About
the middle of the nest day we arrived at the hill we had been
making for. It stood on the bank of a well-watered creek, and
around the foot of it was a patch of good grazing country. The
hill itself sloped until within about a hundred feet of the
summit; then its cap or peak rose abruptly and precipitously, the
top being square and flat. On the bank of the creek was a very
permanent-looking native camp, with the fires in it still
burning, as though but lately abandoned.</p>

<p>A shrill yell soon attracted our attention. Halfway up the
hill, on a bare boulder, stood a blackfellow. He shouted,
gesticulated, danced, and went through all the performances and
antics natives do to show contempt. We made our nigger call out
to him, but it only seemed to increase his rage, until we both of
us felt very much inclined to send a bullet after him. Pity we
didn't. However, this would not do, as we were anxious to come on
friendly terms with them; so we fell to examining the camp, to
see if we could discover any trace of a white man's presence
there. We found nothing.</p>

<p>The hill being apparently isolated, we determined to ride
around it before doing anything else. This took some time, but
we saw no more blacks, and found it equally rugged on all sides.
We had come to a standstill. We could not, with safety, leave our
horses and climb the hill on foot, for the natives might easily
spear the nags while we were away; so we were as far off as ever
from achieving anything. We had something to eat, and gazed
longingly at the unattainable hill before us.</p>

<p>Suddenly Parker drew my attention to a thin smoke rising from
the black top. Evidently the blacks were camped up there, and
quite beyond our reach. We therefore determined to select the
most open place we could find a short distance away, and watch
events. Perhaps we might catch some of the natives on the level
country and run them down.</p>

<p>It was full-moon, that meat, and we thought it best to keep
watch. Barker took the first watch, and woke me shortly after
midnight, having seen nothing disturbing during the time he had
been on the lookout. He had brought the horses up close to the
camp just before he called me, and they were well in sight when I
took his place and the turned in. The first hour passed wearily
enough. Then, as I looked around, noting the position of the
constellations, I became aware of a lurid red light visible
through the tree-tops. Looking at it steadily, I came to the
conclusion that it was a fire on top of the hill. Leaving the
camp and manoeuvring about a little, I managed to get sight of
the hill, and satisfied myself that this was the case. No flames
were visible, but a flickering red glow, sometimes intensely
bright, sometimes duller, but always unmistakably the reflection
of a fire.</p>

<p>I aroused Parker, and together we watched this strange
appearance. He was as positive as I was that It was not visible
when I went on watch. We shook up toe boy, but he could make
nothing of it, and, in fact, seemed very much frightened. Parker
turned in again, and I continued my vigil until daylight.
Naturally, the fire-glow of the night before was discussed from
every point of view, and after breakfast we walked over to the
mysterious mount, leaving the horses and blackfellow in camp. We
never saw either of them again&mdash;in a sound condition.</p>

<p><br>
ARRIVED at the mountain foot, we commenced to go slowly round
it. All was silent and still. Suddenly Parker drew my attention
to a trail of naked feet leading away to the westward, evidently
freshly made. The same thought struck us both&mdash;the blacks
had cleared off at daybreak that morning. Now was the time to
examine the mountain top. We picked out the easiest-looking
place, and commenced the ascent. When we came to the precipitous
sides of the cone we had some difficulty, but at last found a
jugged path, evidently used by the blacks.</p>

<p>We reached the top, and found we were on the edge of a
cup-like hollow which occupied the whole of the apparently flat
summit. Into this seeming crater we peered curiously. A strange
smell arose, a compound of sulphur and burnt meat. The bottom was
a curious jumble of boulders, from between which rose light
wreaths of white smoke.</p>

<p>'This must be the long-talked-of burning mountain,' said
Parker at last.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I returned; 'I have often heard yarns about it, but
never expected to find it.'</p>

<p>'Feel inclined to go down?'</p>

<p>'Not if I know It,' I was just replying, when suddenly from
the pit arose a long wail of anguish and pain. 'Look! look there'
cried Parker. I strained my eyes, and saw a hideous human figure,
hairless and scorched, holding up long, lean arms in
supplication. It was impossible to tell whether it was a man or
woman, for as we gazed an earth tremor shook the mountain, a
split or crack seemed to open in the bottom of the hollow, and
before Parker pulled me back and we threw ourselves down as far
away as the ledge would let us, I caught a glimpse that I shall
never forget.</p>

<p>Down, down an inconceivable depth I saw a sea of living
flames. Over the edges of the crack fell the great boulders of
scoria, and the black, writhing figure went down with them. There
was a blast from hell in my face, and then, as we lay expectant,
came another shock, which shook the mountain. The chasm had
re-closed.</p>

<p>When we mustered our courage to get up and look over the edge,
the air was stifling, and the smoke wreaths were rising once
more.</p>

<p>'My curiosity is satisfied,' said Parker. 'Let's go back to
camp.'</p>

<p><br>
WE commenced the descent, but when half-way down were startled
by the outcries of blacks at the foot of the mountain. We were
nicely caught. There was a mob of them below watching for us. We
kept out of spear-throw, and made as many signs of peace and
amity as our experience suggested; but without avail, and they
presently commenced climbing up towards us. There was no longer
any time for ceremony. We of course took our rifles and revolvers
with us, and from our post of vantage were able to use the former
with effect. But it did not seem to deter these niggers, who
acted in an entirely different manner to any blacks I have ever
seen before. They were evidently mad with rage at our presence
there, and the one who had danced on the rock the day before
seemed leading them on. Parker shot him twice, and he was covered
with blood; but still he kept on, and he was close to us when he
finally fell. The others then drew back, and we had a spell,
although it had been a very near shave. As soon as the natives
were far enough away we went out and examined the body of the
leader. In spite of being covered with grease, charcoal, paint,
and blood, there was no doubt about it that, he was a half-caste,
and, moreover, had tattoo marks on him, after the manner of a
sailor.</p>

<p>We were very thirsty, and determined to endeavor to make our
way back to camp, as it was evident the blacks had been,
disheartened by the fate of this man. We got to where our camp
had been without molestation, but it had been sacked, and both
the blackfellow and the horses were gone. These last we tracked
up and soon found, speared and hacked to death. Whilst looking at
them and cursing our imprudence in leaving them, we heard men
yelling and shouting from the hill. Collecting some cartridges
lying about, we hastened towards it, and saw the niggers carrying
the dead and wounded up the hill to throw into the crater. One,
however, kicked and struggled furiously, and we both thought that
it was the unhappy blackboy we had brought with us, to meet such
a fate. Suddenly Parker seemed struck with a new idea.</p>

<p>'Come on!' he cried, and hurried off to where we had seen the
big fresh trail. 'Their camp can't be far away,' he said, 'and
there will be only the gins there now. Let's find out about that
white man, at any rate.'</p>

<p>Parker was right&mdash;the camp, a very large one, was empty
of all save some gins, and they ran yelling in front of one large
humpy. We knocked them on one side with little ceremony, and sure
enough, there, at the entrance, appeared an ancient,
white-bearded, swarthy-faced man, bent double with age, and
supporting himself on two short sticks. In fact, he looked, as
the blacks described him, like some strange four-legged animal.
His filmy eyes did not recognise us. It was the loud cries of the
gins which had roused him. It had aroused others, too; for before
we had time to try and speak to the white man the natives came
back, furious.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we were both good shots, or we should never have
kept them at bay. They hurled every weapon they had at us, and
killed their own gins and the unfortunate old white, whom I saw
fall down with his head split open. I got two or three nasty
cuts, but Parker was badly hit, and it was with the greatest
difficulty I got him back, when there was a lull, to the site of
our old camp. The blacks had got a sickener, however, and gave us
another spell. I managed to gather up some of the rations which
had not been destroyed, only scattered, and then nursed Parker
until he died, about a fortnight afterwards.</p>

<p>The natives never came near me, although I used to hear them
crying out at times, and I at last got back to the station on
foot, in a very miserable and forlorn condition. The hill where
we came to such utter grief I take to be somewhere on the head of
the Limmen River, and anybody who feels any curiosity in the
matter can go there and satisfy it.</p>

<p>For myself, I am not going back&mdash;I am perfectly
satisfied.</p>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>17. &mdash; THE EXTRA HAND</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 11 and 18 Nov 1899</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
'DID you ever hear about that island?' said the engineer as he
pointed to a low, sandy islet, one of the few visible portions of
the Great Barrier Reef.</p>

<p>'No,' I replied. 'It does not look very interesting.'</p>

<p>No more it did, being all sand, save a melancholy growth of
stunted bushes on the highest point, and the skeleton frame-work
of what had been once a drying shed for <i>bêche de mer</i>.</p>

<p>'Thought you might have heard about it, as you've been up and
down the coast pretty often. Why, the yarn is that whenever a
boat passes there, about midnight&mdash;any sort of boat, from a
first-class steamer to a dinghy&mdash;an extra man is found on
board. He comes aboard just before reaching the island, and after
passing it a mile or two he jumps overboard and disappears.'</p>

<p>'Good old legend,' I said.</p>

<p>'I've never seen him myself,' went on the chief, 'but I know
that several steamers have stopped here, and lowered a boat,
under the impression that someone has jumped overboard. But the
tally has been always found right, and although people have sworn
to seeing the man jump, none of them could find out anything, and
they just had to log it and go ahead.'</p>

<p>'What's the story connected with this appearance?'</p>

<p>'Ah, only one man knows, and he's a leper on Friday
Island.'</p>

<p>'That's queer. How is that known?'</p>

<p>'It's not exactly known, only guessed. This man was taken from
that island to the leper station when that old trepang station
was abandoned. Ever since he was taken away that extra
hand&mdash;that's his name among we&mdash;has taken to coming
aboard. There were two men there at the station, but only one
came away. He signalled a steamer, and got them to leave word at
Cooktown that he had contracted leprosy, and wanted to be taken
off the island, so the Government launch came out with the
doctor, and he's now at Friday Island.'</p>

<p>'Didn't he say what had become of his companion?' I asked.</p>

<p>'He absolutely refused to give any information, and as the
natives that the men had employed had gone over to the mainland,
and dispersed amongst their own tribes, there was nothing to be
done but to cart him off.'</p>

<p>'I'm stopping at Thursday Island for a week or two. I'll try
and find out some more.'</p>

<p>'I don't think you will, for they say he never
speaks&mdash;just gets his rations and camps by himself.'</p>

<p><br>
I COULD find out no more about this mysterious extra hand,
save that most of the men who went up and down the coast
implicitly believed in the apparition.</p>

<p>While at Thursday Island I made the acquaintance of the doctor
who had charge of the leper station, and asked him about the
patient who came there from the Barrier.</p>

<p>'Vantroop, you mean,' he answered. 'I can tell you nothing at
all about him, for the very good reason that the man never utters
a word if he can help it. A short and curt reply to an absolutely
necessary question is the utmost you can get from him.'</p>

<p>'Vantroop!' I echoed. 'I knew a Vantroop once, but surely it
cannot be he. He was fairly well off, and had no need to go
<i>bêche-de-mer</i> fishing on the Barrier. His wife and family
are still in Sydney, for I saw Mrs. Vantroop when I passed
through Sydney the other day.'</p>

<p>'Did you ask after her husband?' said the doctor.</p>

<p>'To tell you the truth, I did not; nor did she say anything
about him.'</p>

<p>'I shouldn't be surprised if this is your Mend, for this man,
when he was first taken there, and had to make the necessary
statements, denied that his name was Vantroop, but said that that
was the name of the man who had been his partner. But people at
Cooktown, who knew them both, say that this man was always known
as Vantroop. If he has a wife and family, I can quite imagine
that the poor devil wishes himself to be thought dead, and would
hide his name.'</p>

<p>'What is he like?'</p>

<p>'A tall, fair man, very fair, in fact; about 45 years old or
so.'</p>

<p>'That fairly' answers the description. I wonder whether I
could 'see him?'</p>

<p>'What would be the good?' said the doctor. 'You may be sure
that he, a leper, does not want to see anyone he has known when
he was a clean man.'</p>

<p>'That's true. But perhaps if I keep his secret I may be able
to do something for him. We used to be good friends once, many
years ago, if this is the game man.'</p>

<p>'Well, I could get you an order, if you think you can do the
man any good.'</p>

<p>'Is he very bad?'</p>

<p>'Not yet; he is not repulsive to look at, if that is what you
mean. He will be soon, though; I can see the disease getting
worse during the last few months.'</p>

<p><br>
THE doctor got me an order or permit to go with him on his
periodical visit to the leper station. All of the patients, save
Vantroop, were Chinamen or islanders, and it was not until after
the stores had been landed and distributed, and the wretched
creatures had drawn back, that Vantroop advanced.</p>

<p>The doctor had some special things for him, and he told him
about my coming. I was standing by the boat, where she had been
run up on the beach, and from where I was I could see him gaze
earnestly at me, but he made no sign. I had recognised him as
soon as he had appeared, for he was one of those men whose
appearance is unmistakable. Presently the doctor returned.</p>

<p>'He will see you, Whitcombe,' he said; 'but I can't give you
long.'</p>

<p>'Can't I stop here, and you send for me presently?'</p>

<p>'It would be against the rules altogether, and some busybody
on the island would be writing to the Government, saying that men
were allowed to go backwards and forwards to the leper station,
just as they liked, spreading the germs of leprosy everywhere.
Personally, I don't care a cent, but you know how many meddling
fools there are in the world.'</p>

<p>I went up to Vantroop.</p>

<p>'Well, Whitcombe,' he said, 'I suppose you never dreamt of
finding me here? I won't shake hands, thank you; my right hand is
going bandy.'</p>

<p>What could I answer? What could I say? To express sympathy
with a man slowly undergoing a living death, would seem a
mockery. I tried to say something, but he interrupted me.</p>

<p>'Never mind, old man, I guess all you would like to say, so
take it as said. Don't you think I have broken myself in to the
inevitable by this time? Now, is there anything you can tell me
about the other world?'</p>

<p>'I met your wife in Sydney a few weeks ago; she was well, and
I understood that the children were the same.' f course, she
Imagines I am dead?' he said calmly.</p>

<p>'I was not aware of it. I only met her in the street, and just
when I was about to speak of you somebody interrupted us. I was
then going aboard the steamer, and did not see her again. She was
not to mourning?'</p>

<p>'No. I have been here more than two years. When you go back
make a point of seeing her, and giving her some details of my
death. I will furnish you with them.'</p>

<p>I thought a few minutes, and then said I would.</p>

<p>'How did the ghost story come about?' I asked. 'I hear that
you occupied the island where the "extra hand" is supposed to
board the boats.'</p>

<p>'What extra hand? What ghost story? Remember, I am buried
alive, and never hear anything.'</p>

<p>His tone was more excited than it had been yet, and I told him
the story as the chief had told it to me. A look of keen
satisfaction stole over his face.</p>

<p>'It works, it works! Thank God!' he muttered.</p>

<p>I gazed at him wonderingly, and as I did so a warning whistle
came from the boat. I had only a quarter of an hour more, and
told Vantroop so.</p>

<p>'Never mind,' he said. 'The doctor must stick to red tape, but
I will write down what I want you to do, and you write me all you
know about my people. Do you think you can get me photographs of
the youngsters?'</p>

<p>'Rather a difficult task without a decent lie to back me up,
but I'll try.'</p>

<p>'Would you go to No. 14 Island for me? There are some pearls
there worth, getting. Take some for your expenses, and give the
rest to my wife.'</p>

<p>'More lies!' I said, my sense of humor overcoming me at the
thought of the net of deceit I should soon be entangled in.</p>

<p>'Never mind. You have done me a world of good&mdash;that is,
if anything can do a rotting leper any good. The extra hand!' and
he turned abruptly away, and went off, laughing strangely.</p>

<p>'I suppose he's your man?' queried the doctor, when I took my
seat in the stern, and we backed out.</p>

<p>'He's the man. But, doctor, he is dead&mdash;let him die. His
name is probably not Vantroop.'</p>

<p>'I understand,' said the doctor. 'Vantroop is dead, as far as
I am concerned.'</p>

<p><br>
I STAYED a fortnight longer at Thursday Island, and during
that time I exchanged communications with Vantroop. I did not see
him again; he asked me not to, and I well understood his reason.
The time came when I had to leave on my return, but, in
accordance with my promise to Vantroop, I meant to go first to
Cooktown; there procure a lugger, visit No. 14 Island, and get
the pearls he spoke of, then return to Sydney.</p>

<p>He had sent me the story of his adventures, which had finally
landed him in the leper station at Friday Island, and this is how
it ran:</p>

<h3>VANTROOP'S STORY</h3>

<p class="first">
I WAS tired of easy living; the restlessness of the born
wanderer had come upon me, and I felt that I must be off once
more to the freedom of semi-civilised society. Wife and children
were dear to me, but the smell of the salt sea breeze, the love
of savagedom, the wild unrestraint of an outside life, were hot
in my veins, and the force, the unknown force that has always
dragged men of our race away, dragged me away from the position
of a respectable citizen of Sydney to the fate of a leper on
Friday Island.</p>

<p>I had not quite made up my mind when I came across an old
friend&mdash;you met him, Whitcombe, you remember Charley
Bancroft? He had been pearling up in the northern seas, and was
doing well. I did not want for money, but I wanted adventure, for
the remembrance of old times, and old frays still coursed hotly
in my brain, so I consented to join him on a trip. I made every
arrangement for my wife and family, in case of my death;
fortunately, as I am dead, as you know. Then I started on a
pearling voyage with Bancroft, I finding some of the needful
capital. So far as a pearling voyage was concerned, our trip was
not much of a success. Bancroft had wild ideas about banks of
shell amongst the islands to the east of Java, and we got a
permit from the Dutch Government, which claims sovereignty over
those seas, and sailed amongst the many islands, and led a lazy,
roving life, but found neither shell nor pearls.</p>

<p>At last we came to an island, seldom visited by
whites&mdash;one of the group east of Ceram. At one of these
islands we made the acquaintance of an old Rajah, who was paid by
the Dutch, and held great state in consequence. He had two
daughters, and both Bancroft and myself fell under the spell of
their dark eyes. In this lotus-eating kind of life we were
leading a dusky love seemed a necessity, and, in consequence of
yielding to the spell, I am now what I am, a leper on Friday
Island.</p>

<p>Let me tell the story as I know it now, and, though I do not
seek to find any excused for myself, still there are excuses
which another may find. I have said there were two daughters,
Nuhu Raka and Nuhu Rota, Raka being the eldest and the most
beautiful. Both Bancroft and myself fell in love with her, but
Raka favored me, and Bancroft transferred his devotion to Nuhu
Rota, the younger. We stayed on at the island, and gave the old
Rajah rifles and cartridges, and other European things that his
soul hankered after, and forgot the world. But I had aroused a
feeling of hatred in Bancroft's heart, which did not cause him to
forget anything, and especially that I had won the love of Raka.
Then came the catastrophe.</p>

<p>A Dutch gunboat came to the island. The old Rajah made much of
his visitors, but they, with the boorishness of their
nature&mdash;the Dutch naval officer is far beneath those of
other nations&mdash;looked askance at us. Trouble followed. The
first lieutenant made violent love to the youngest daughter,
Rota, and aroused Bancroft's wrath, and they quarrelled.
Quarrelled to blows, and Bancroft gave the Dutchman a neat pair
of black eyes, A challenge followed&mdash;a secret one, by the
way, for the Dutch officer feared arrest if his Commander came to
hear of it. Bancroft shot his opponent through the heart and then
there was no help for it&mdash;we had to fly, but how? The
gunboat could overhaul our schooner if we; attempted flight by
sea; and, in fact, as soon as the party got on board with the
officer's boat, an armed boat's crew went off and seized her.
Fortunately, we were not on board.</p>

<p>The Rajah concealed us, and promised to see us conveyed over
to the other side of the island, and shipped away. The duel had
been fair enough, but we knew we would get no justice from the
Dutch. A lifelong prison would be our doom, a death amongst
colored men of the lowest, of the most criminal class, and our
fate kept secret. This is the sort of justice the Dutch of the
East Indies deal out.</p>

<p>Well, the old Rajah wanted his price for assisting us away,
and that price was my marriage with Raka. Bancroft plied me with
reasons, for it was our only hope, and I consented in a fit of
partial intoxication, Bancroft assuring me that a marriage by
island rites meant nothing, knowing all the time the horrible
secret that made the Rajah wish to get rid of Raka.</p>

<p>I will not say any more of my mad sin, which has brought on me
much dire punishment, save that we were safely escorted across
the island, and at parting the Rajah bestowed upon me as a
wedding gift a magnificent lot of pearls, the value of which even
the old fellow himself did not know.</p>

<p>Our destination was a station on the southern coast, occupied
by a Jesuit missionary, at which an occasional schooner called at
times. There we stayed until the schooner should
arrive&mdash;myself, Raka, and Bancroft. That priest! He was a
relic of The Middle Ages. Devoted to his faith, good,
self-sacrificing, and rejoicing in a possible martyrdom from
fever. It was after we had been there some week or two that the
father spoke to me&mdash;we had become friends.</p>

<p>'Son,' he said, 'you are a sinful man. That I know, for you
have wedded this woman, who Is not of your race, but a heathen,
and I believe yon have a wife in your own country. So says your
friend.'</p>

<p>'My friend!'</p>

<p>'God's hand is heavy upon you. You will never see them more;
the punishment falls on you in this world, and by God's mercy you
may gain peace after death. But you must suffer,' and the good
priest hid his face in his hands.</p>

<p>'Father, what do you mean?' I shouted.</p>

<p>'I mean the worst. Son, misguided and sinful, know the worst.
The heathen wife you have married is a leper, and you, too, will
become one.'</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="verse">
When manned by more than signed with us,<br>

We passed the Isle o' Ghosts.</p>

<p class="first">
IT did not take long for the whole truth to become apparent to
me. The marriage of Raka had been insisted on because the secret
of her leprosy evidently could not be kept much longer, and it
being made public would, perhaps, cause the deposition of the old
Rajah; her marriage would at once relieve him from this fear.
Bancroft knew of it, probably from Rahu, and, anxious only to
escape from the vengeance of the Dutch, had connived at my
ruin.</p>

<p>Naturally, my first and only consuming thought was one of
revenge, and if it had not been for the restraining influence of
that wonderful priest I would at once have choked the life out of
Bancroft. But I feigned to listen to his exhortations not to
stain my hands with his blood, and I know now that it has given
me a surer and more lingering vengeance. The unhappy Raka found a
friend in the priest, who promised to see that she would be cared
for at his station; but before we left that accursed spot where
first I learnt that I was an outcast leper, she came to me and
told me something ere she bade me good-bye, something that you
will not believe; but you will; before you return from No. 14
Island. She told me of a charm, a spell, one practised amongst
her people, by which one could bring the soul of another under
his sway before and after death. Without believing at the time, I
grasped eagerly at what promised, in however wild a way, to
satisfy the desire for some abnormal form of vengeance which
madly possessed me. From her I learnt the heathenish rites which
gave me a power over Bancroft, during life as I know, and now,
from what you have told me, during death also. When we finally
got to Queensland, I told him that he must hide himself from the
vengeance of the Dutch Government, though he stood in no real
danger from its power. Therefore, I advised that we took an
island on the Barrier, and started fishing. Goodness knows, I,
too, had cause enough to hide myself from my fellow men.</p>

<p>So we came to No. 14 Island, and got some Binghis from the
mainland and started fishing for <i>bêche-de-mer</i>, and I led
him a life of torture from that out. I was in hopes that he would
catch the leprosy from me, but he did not, and as my disease got
worse, I had to make up my mind to bring things to a climax. I
sent the blacks away; then one night I told Bancroft that I was
going to board a steamer going up to Thursday Island, and we
would put off and get in her track. Now, Bancroft always had a
horror of drowning, and when we got well away from the island I
forced him overboard, and told him to swim behind till he was
tired, and then I would pick him up again. He swam behind,
calling out to me in terror now and again, until at last, when I
heard him getting faint, I hailed him and told him that when he
died he should pass his time in vainly swimming off to passing
boats and being taken on board, but it would avail him nothing,
for my curse would compel him to jump overboard again and swim
back to the island. And he is doing it, and I shall die happy, as
happy as I was when I heard his last choking cry.</p>

<p><br>
THIS was practically the end of Vantroop's letter, beyond
directions for finding the pearls and what to do with them when
realised on. This was a nice sort of legacy to leave a man, to
search over a ghost-haunted islet for some pearls which might,
after all, be only the mad creation of a leper.</p>

<p>However, it suited me to go, and, after returning to Cooktown,
I leased a lugger, got an old friend to accompany me, and, with a
couple of kanakas and an old Malay, started for No. 14. We
reached there, and rigged up a camp, and that night the old Malay
came and asked who the white man was walking about the
island.</p>

<p>I told him I knew nothing about any white man, and he retired,
vowing something in his native tongue which did not sound like a
blessing. However, he could not do much harm to a ghost, and by
to-morrow I hoped to be away. Before dark I had noted down the
spot where we had to look for the pearls, which were enclosed in
a box much too big for them; and after tea my friend and I took a
spade and lantern, and went to dig them up.</p>

<p>'There's the old <i>serang</i> sitting on the very place,'
said Rental, as we approached. But it was not the old
<i>serang</i>, and as we approached the figure glided away in a
very uncanny fashion. While we were digging up the box, which was
there right enough, although I scarcely expected to find it, it
flitted around us; but as it did not approach us, it did not
disturb our labors, and we got safely back to camp with the box,
but I swear that I heard a sound of wailing and sobbing as we
left the spot.</p>

<p><br>
NEXT morning it was a dead calm, and one of the hottest days I
think I ever experienced, even in the torrid north. The sea had
not a ripple on it, and the sky was without a cloud. We could not
start, and had to spend the day on that oven of a place. Towards
dusk a wind came up, and we made a start. Just as the sails were
drawing, and the boat was getting way on, we all heard a cry, and
in the dim light saw a figure dashing along the reef, through the
shallow water, to overtake us.</p>

<p>'Don't let him on board! He no man!' screamed the old Malay,
but the next minute the thing was alongside, and had scrambled on
board. It was dark, but a lantern had been lit, and we could see
that the thing that had boarded us had the semblance of a man,
and I knew it must be the 'extra hand.'</p>

<p>Then a horrible thing happened. The old Malay, with the 'amok'
fire in his eyes, threw himself on the stranger, and they fought
together until they both went over the low side of the lugger.
And they never came up again.</p>

<p>I delivered the pearls all right, but I heard from the doctor
at Thursday Island that Vantroop, the leper, had committed
suicide, and, as near as I could make out, it was about the very
time we were leaving No. 14. I suppose Vantroop's death took the
spell off the other fellow, and he was able to drown in
peace.</p>

<h2><a id="ch18"></a>18. &mdash; FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 13 May 1899</h3>

<p class="first">
'I WOULDN'T sell that dog for any money,' said Tom Miles, as
he filled his pipe in a meditative manner befitting an act of
such importance. 'He saved my life many a time.'</p>

<p>The dog in question was the veriest mongrel and canine scamp
to be found anywhere. The animal was a kind of liver and white
color, and had only one sound eye and one good ear. To say it was
white was wrong, for it was so abominably dirty that one could
only suppose that it had been white once. Everybody hated it,
including Tom Miles himself, for it was a regular Artful Dodger
of a thief, would bite horses' heels on the sly, and make them
buck; it would, in fact, do everything that a dog ought not to
do, and leave undone all that a dog ought to do. The other dogs
hated the creature. It would never fight, at least fight fair,
but it had the quick snap of a native dog, and would come upon
them suddenly when they were asleep, or not thinking of anything.
Still, Tom was a good man, and popular on the station, so nobody
shot or poisoned his dog, and put up with it. Tom often mentioned
the fact that the dog had saved his life many times, but no one
had ever heard the details, nor did anyone believe that such a
wretched object ever did any good in his life.</p>

<p>One evening Tom enlightened us over one of these providential
circumstances.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">
'I'LL tell you how Johnson Jones' (which was the name of the
monster) 'came to get his name. Out west beyond the Wakero there
lived a squatter called Johnson Jones, who was considered the
meanest and most disagreeable old hunks about that part at that
time. There might be worse than him since. Well, I was short of
money and rations, so I concluded that I would tackle Mr.
Johnson-Jones, although I had been warned that he never gave
travellers a feed. However, at the worst, he could only say
"No."'</p>

<p>'Mr. Jones was that mean that he had built his homestead on
the worst and scrubbiest bit of land he could find, his reasons
being that he wanted all the good country for his stock, and that
if there was never any grass about the homestead, why, the
"loafing travellers" would not be always camping there. The
blacks were precious bad just at that time, and Jones had his
place right in the heart of a brigalow scrub, as dull, dark, and
horrible a place as ever a man chose to live in. The smell of the
gidyea trees, distributed through the brigalow, was enough to
poison a crocodile in wet weather. It was dusk when I got there,
and I went up to the verandah to ask if I could stop the night,
just as old Jones had finished telling his cook that if he ever
opened more than two tins of jam in six months, he'd sack him on
the spot. To my request he snarled out, "No," stating that he was
being eaten out of house and home by wandering vagabonds like me.
As I saw I could not get a feed, I up and answered him back, and
we got to high words. In the end he said, "I'll set the dogs on
you it you don't leave," and suddenly that brute there rushed at
me, and commenced snapping at my legs. I kicked at the wretch,
and somehow he got between my legs, and I tumbled over him. Just
at that very moment-came a shower of spears from' a mob of
blacks, who had crept up to attack the place. They went over me,
but fetched Jones, and down he went. I jumped up and dragged him
inside, where, fortunately, the cook was laying tea. He showed me
where the firearms were, and with the assistance of the stockman
we beat the niggers off; but poor Jones was past praying for, and
so would I have been but for falling over that confounded tyke.
That's the first time he saved my life.'</p>

<p>'But how did you come by him, Tom?' asked somebody.</p>

<p>'Oh! just before old Jones died I had done all I could for
him, and he was a bit grateful. He sent for me and said: "You're
not a bad fellow after all, and I'd like to show that I was
thankful, just that somebody might say a good word for me when
I'm dead. Now, I'll give you that dog;" then he turned his face
to the wall, and that was the end of Hungry Jones. The dog took
to me for some reason, and I christened him Johnson Jones after
his old boss. That's how he got his name.'</p>

<p>'And how about the next time he saved your life?' asked the
same inquisitive individual.</p>

<p>'Well, that was swimming across a flooded river. I was
travelling down the Bundegar River, and had to cross it or
starve, for the rations had given out, and all the stations were
on the other side of the river; so I determined to swim over. I
had a little tucker left that Johnson Jones had not succeeded in
stealing, and in case I did not hit the bank near a station, I
took the precaution of fastening it round my neck, so that It
should be kept dry. My horse was a good swimmer, and Johnson
Jones swims like a duck; but when I was halfway over my horse
came against a snag, and I got a kick that nearly finished me.
But I managed to struggle on a bit. Then I was about going under;
but suddenly I heard a bark, and that faithful dog was hauling
and tearing at the swag round my neck, and brought my head above
water again. How we struggled ashore I don't know; but I remember
lying on the sand, with Johnson Jones tearing at my neck, and
devouring all the grub there was left. Then I realised that
Johnson Jones had been anxious to rescue the rations and not
me.'</p>

<p>'And the next time he saved you?' said the same voice.</p>

<p>'Ah! that was a near shave! It was on the boundary of New
South Wales and Queensland, and we had all gone in for a spree.
When I say 'in' I mean into a small township that marked the line
between the two colonies. Johnson Jones distinguished himself. He
bit the landlord, the barmaid, the landlords wife and children,
and finally bit the half-caste groom, and that made him sick.
Well, the landlord bucked around, and said that either I must
kill that dog or he would. This ended in my leaving, and going
out to a water-hole, about a mile away, to camp and await my
mates.</p>

<p>'They came after three days&mdash;four of them in a dray, a
common tip dray, nothing on them but their trousers, for they had
all been fighting before they were carted away, and when the man
reached my camp he tipped the whole lot out to sort themselves
out as best they could. I asked the driver, who was one part
sober, If he had any liquor to pick them up with, and he grinned
and brought out some bottles of black-strap, which would do for
foot-rotting sheep.</p>

<p>'I wrestled with those, four men in mad D.T.s. for two days,
giving them small doses of hell-fire occasionally; but they all
died. You might have seen it in the papers under the title of
"Shocking Outbreak of Cholera." Now, if Johnson Jones had not
bitten those people, I should have been stiff too. That's the
third time the dog saved my life.'</p>

<p><br>
TOM ended, and nobody, spoke for a while. Then the seeker
after information said:</p>

<p>'Was there a fourth time?'</p>

<p>'Certainly there was,' said Miles. 'The fourth time was me
queerest shave of me lot. I was on the Mukki, and Jones, the dog,
was, of course, with me. Well, we travelled down the blessed
river looking for work until we came to a small township. It was
about the smallest township I ever came across. There was one
pub, a blacksmith's shop, and a store. Beyond that only a few
houses, mostly carriers' wives. I was told I could get a cheap
bed at one of these, as they mainly let out lodgings for
travellers. As soon as I went into the one I was directed to,
Johnson Jones distinguished himself my attacking the decent woman
of the house and tearing her child's frock off. She told me she
would take me in if I got rid of my dog, so I got an old bullock
yoke and half killed him, and after biting me twice on the ankle
he departed.</p>

<p>'That night there was a murder committed at a small pub about
four miles outside the township. I went out early in the morning
for a stroll, and found Johnson Jones outside. He expressed his
readiness to forgive me, and accompanied me on my walk, during
which I met two mounted troopers, who immediately dismounted and
arrested me, charging me with the murder that had been committed
the former night. I had nothing to do but accompany them, and was
put in the lockup in company with that artful dog.</p>

<p>'It seems that I was identified as the assassin by means of
the dog, who, after I had hammered him with the yoke, had gone
away, and witnessed all the murder, and made but that he belonged
to the murderer. Only, for the evidence of the woman who had been
my landlady, who testified, in consequence of the dog, that I and
he came there together, and that I remained like a respectable
lodger, after hunting the dog away&mdash;this, and the real man
being found soon, afterwards, got me off, but I believe if it had
not been for Jones biting the children, I should have been
hanged.'</p>

<p><br>
A YEAR or two afterwards I met one of the chaps who had sat
there that night, and I asked after Tom Miles.</p>

<p>'He's dead, poor fellow,' he answered.</p>

<p>'Dead?'</p>

<p>'Yes; got a spill, and his horse fell on him. He was not found
for some days. You remember his dog?'</p>

<p>'Yes, the faithful Jones.'</p>

<p>'Well, he stayed beside poor Tom all the time, and when they
found him he had pretty well eaten half of him.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>19. &mdash; THE NEW SUPER OF OAKLEY DOWNS</h2>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, 29 Mar 1890</h3>

<h3><i>My Only Murder and Other Tales</i>, 1899</h3>

<p class="first">
OAKLEY DOWNS, as it was called by courtesy, was noted
throughout the district as a station warranted to ruin the
proprietor quicker than any other two in the neighbourhood. The
number of times it had changed hands was not on record, but the
many men who had lost small piles on it were to be found all over
the-colonies. Why in bitter irony it was called Downs nobody
could understand, as from start to finish it was nothing but one
mass of brigalow and gidya scrub. As for the cattle&mdash;well,
the constant change of ownership and resulting neglect had
rendered them notorious as the wildest scrubbers in
Australia.</p>

<p>But in Sydney or Melbourne Oakley Downs was quite a different
place. There, in the hands of the plausible stock and station
agent, it became a gem of the first water. "Scrub, sir, of course
there are small belts of scrub on it, and they form one of the
most attractive features. All the best kinds of saltbush grow in
the scrubs, and on Oakley Downs want of feed is never felt; fat
cattle when you couldn't get a beast elsewhere, and, as for
water, why, on some of the holes you could float the
<i>Orlando</i>. Certainly there was plenty of water. The Bignargo
river ran through the centre, a river of billabongs, wherein were
long, serpentine holes of milky, clayey water, bordered on either
side by the grey monotony of the brigalow. A more depressing,
melancholy spot never existed than Oakley Downs."</p>

<p>It was with a feeling of commiseration, then, that the news
was heard in the district that one more unfortunate had invested
in the ill-starred place. Various rumours were afloat concerning
the new proprietor. Some said he was an innocent new-chum, who
had been shamefully taken in. Others would have it that it was a
confident old hand, who had vowed to make the place pay when
everybody else had failed, and altogether speculation was rife to
an alarming extent. The old hutkeeper only grinned to himself. He
was a fixture on the place and was passed on from one to another
as the successive owners retired stone broke; as a rule, he gave
each man eighteen months to get sick of his bargain, and then he
calculated on six months of inglorious ease.</p>

<p>This misanthropic guardian sat outside the hut smoking his
evening pipe and wondering when the new owner would make his
appearance, when his eye was caught by a thin trail of dust
rising over the scrub giving notice of the approach of a
traveller. It was a feature of Oakley Downs that it was either
bog up to the girths or dust. Presently the rider came in sight
leading a pack-horse, and the nearer he came the more old Bill
the hutkeeper stared. Such a peculiar figure had never been seen
on Oakley Downs before. A sallow youth of about two-and-twenty,
riding all over his moke as though he had never had much practice
in horsemanship, and painfully pulling along a reluctant
packhorse. He was dressed in black clothes, wore low shoes, had
on a white shirt-collar, etc., and, to complete the
"flabbergastion" of old Bill, a tall silk hat!</p>

<p>Bill was bereft of all powers of speech, but managed to come
forward and take the packhorse, while the new-comer awkwardly and
stiffly dismounted.</p>

<p>"This is Oakley Downs station?" he asked.</p>

<p>Bill intimated that it was.</p>

<p>"I've come up to take charge of it for my uncle," was the
astounding answer. Bill could only gasp in silence. Oakley Downs,
that had scared the best scrub-riders of the continent, in charge
of this strange object!</p>

<p>"Are you a stockman?" was the next query. Bill replied that he
was everything just then, and, overcome with pity, he led the two
horses up to the verandah of the house, followed by the new
Super, who walked very uncomfortably.</p>

<p>Bill unpacked and unsaddled the horses, and then told his new
boss that he would bring him in some tea directly. The stranger
thanked him effusively.</p>

<p>"You know," he said, "I get so confused with all those straps
and things on the saddle; I had such a job to get that tail strap
on this morning."</p>

<p>"That what?" asked Bill. The Super indicated the article which
Bill recognised as the crupper, yet he said nothing, he was too
far gone for surprise; but straightway went on to the kitchen and
lay down on his bunk to enjoy the situation for five minutes.</p>

<p>When Bill took the tea in he found Mr. Melrose, for that, he
informed Bill, was his name, seated reading a book. He had
brushed his clothes and hair, and, as Bill said, "reminded him of
church more than ever."</p>

<p>"I will get you to come over and talk to me a little after
tea," he said to his astounded assistant, "I want to learn
something about the run, and I suppose you know all about
it."</p>

<p>In obedience to this summons Bill proceeded to the house and
found Mr. Melrose with a number of books on the table, evidently
produced from his voluminous pack-bags.</p>

<p>"I hear the oxen are considered very intractable," he said,
after Bill had sat down.</p>

<p>Bill pondered a minute. "Do you mean," he said, "that the
cattle are as wild as hell?"</p>

<p>The young man flushed painfully. "Do not use such strong
expressions," he remarked. "Now I have been thinking over several
devices whereby we might manage to bring them to subordination,
and I should like your opinion of them. Here is an account of a
man meeting a lion unexpectedly, and how, retaining his presence
of mind, he stared fixedly at the animal, when the king of beasts
slunk back into the jungle. How do you think that would work?"</p>

<p>"Is that a true bill, mister?" said Bill.</p>

<p>"Certainly; it's in a book published by the Religious Tract
Society."</p>

<p>"Well," returned the puzzled cook, "if you're going to walk
through these blooming scrubs until you meet a bullock, and then
stare at him till he gets into the yard, you'll be a thundering
old man before you get the first one in."</p>

<p>"Here is another plan which with the aid of some of our black
brethren may be effectual. You see this engraving&mdash;it is in
a book of African travel. The natives dig a great pit and put
sharp stakes in it. Then they form a half-circle and drive all
the game to this point and the game fall into the pit. Do you
think we could do this with the cattle?"</p>

<p>"And how do you get 'em out of the pit?" asked Bill.</p>

<p>"They would have to be left there, I suppose," replied the
young man, "I only thought of this as a last resource. Then there
are pitfalls we might dig in the forest; traps we might set so
that the ox would be caught by the leg when his bellowing would
attract attention."</p>

<p>Bill began to feel uncomfortable. What did all this point to?
Was he alone on the station with a howling lunatic?</p>

<p>"And now, before we separate for the night, I will read
prayers, and then we will supplicate that the hearts of these
savage beasts may be tamed and rendered gentle as they will be
during the millennium."</p>

<p>Bill said afterwards he was afraid to cross him, so he sat out
meekly half-an-hour of reading and praying and then departed.</p>

<p><br>
ABOUT twelve o'clock, when all was silent, the noise of a
horse leaving the station might have been heard. It was Bill,
making tracks to the next station as hard as he could to report
the arrival of a hopeless monomaniac. Cameron Vale, the next
station, was only eight miles away, and when the owner, who was a
good-natured fellow, heard Bill's strange story, he determined to
ride over and investigate matters the first thing the next
morning. Bill accompanied him, and the two of them arrived about
seven o clock. Bill went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast, and
Dermott (the owner of Cameron Vale) introduced himself to Melrose
as his neighbour. Melrose, in spite of his strange attire, was
evidently a gentleman and as they sat at breakfast he returned to
the subject of the cattle.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, in his feebly solemn voice, "that you
trust too much to skill in horsemanship to gather the herds in. I
was thinking of stretching fencing-wire from tree to tree
throughout the forest at about two feet from the ground. It would
thus form a perfect maze in which the animals would be completely
bewildered, and over which they would constantly stumble. Do you
not think they would speedily become frightened and tame?"</p>

<p>Dermott thought not, and, without betraying surprise, turned
the conversation into the subject of the purchase of the station.
Melrose informed him that the purchaser was his uncle, Dean
Melrose, of Culquone, and that the place was bought cheaply for
himself and his brother.</p>

<p>"Do you expect your brother up?" asked Dermott.</p>

<p>"I hope not," was the reply; "he will interfere a good deal
with my plans. You see he has been used to station-life and got
all the old-fashioned notions."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been on a station before?" asked Dermott.</p>

<p>"No," replied the other, with the first symptoms of
irritability he had shown. "I have had a great disappointment. I
was dedicated to quite a different work, but it matters
not&mdash;I have my talent. I understand there is a large supply
of water," here he continued after a pause.</p>

<p>"Yes, you've plenty of water," said Dermott</p>

<p>"So I understood; now I think that we could utilise it this
way. Pump it into reservoirs high up in the trees in different
places, then, by means of hose, use it to drive the cattle to
where you wanted them to go. They would not face a strong stream
of water. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Well, not quite," returned his companion.</p>

<p>"Ah! perhaps so, I know I am a good deal ahead of the
time."</p>

<p>Dermott soon after took his leave, reassuring old Bill that
there was no harm in the supposed lunatic, and he would probably
have easy times of it. He himself determined to wire down to the
agents and find out the truth of the matter, but in this design
he was frustrated. Just as he was preparing to leave a horseman
came riding rapidly up to the station. Whenever Melrose caught
sight of him he uttered an exclamation of disgust.</p>

<p>"Now, here's Ned come to upset everything!"</p>

<p>The new-comer dismounted and saluted his brother laughingly.
"You stole a march on me, old man, but I've managed to come up to
tune after all." Melrose turned into the house with a dejected
air, and Dermott introduced himself to the stranger, who was
evidently the brother.</p>

<p>"Has Jim been saying anything funny?" asked the new-comer.
"Fancy his riding up to the station in such a rig! I expected to
pick up his pieces on the road."</p>

<p>Dermott said that some of his remarks showed a decidedly
strong imagination.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said the younger man, "he was going to be a
clergyman, but he overdid it. Broke down and had brain-fever from
overwork. Since then he's got an idea that he can invent
anything. He was coming up here with me, as we thought the change
would do him good, but at Port Royal he gave me the slip and
started off by himself, to commence some of his experiments, I
suppose."</p>

<p>Oakley Downs was quite true to its name. Eighteen months quite
satisfied the younger Melrose; but the next occupant found all
manner of strange fixtures about the place, which Bill told him
were due to the misdirected genius of the would-be
cattle-tamer.</p>

<h2><a id="ch20"></a>20. &mdash; BILL SOMERS</h2>

<h3><i>The Bulletin</i>, 16 Feb 1895</h3>

<h3><i>My Only Murder and Other Tales</i>, 1899</h3>

<p class="first">
BILL SOMERS cheated me out of a nice little fortune of some
fifty or sixty thousand pounds. Now, I never saw Bill Somers in
my life; and he never saw or heard of me, and did not gain a
single cent by the transaction. Nevertheless, Bill Somers is the
man I have to thank for the present unsatisfactory condition of
my finances.</p>

<p>I was managing my uncle's station&mdash;it ought to be mine,
now. He lived in Sydney, paying only an annual visit to the
place. He was a bachelor, and as he was a crusty and most
argumentative old dog, I used to think it was just as well we
only met occasionally.</p>

<p>Now, I myself am not argumentative except when people don't
agree with me; still, one cannot live with a Sir Oracle for long
without feeling obliged to differ from him occasionally.
Naturally, my uncle supposed himself an authority on nearly every
question under the sun, and I have no doubt he persuaded himself
that he had really gone through the many experiences he used to
relate. He was never at a loss for information to bolster his
inventions; for he could always quote a man he used to know who
knew all about it. That's how I came to hear about Bill
Somers.</p>

<p>I was in Sydney for a few days on station business, and was
dining with my uncle. Charming cottage and grounds (ought also to
be mine).</p>

<p>Having finished all the "shop" we had to talk about, the old
gentleman was holding forth on some sharp practices lately
brought to light amongst the provision-shipping merchants.</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "in my time we would as soon&mdash;" There he
hesitated, and I chipped in, jocularly, as I filled my glass:
"Come, governor! you know you were never in the
provision-shipping line."</p>

<p>My uncle was speechless for some time, whether from rage or
because he was making something up I don't know; the latter, I
suspect.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he said slowly at last; "I was never in the
provision line, as you justly remark. But, was not my friend,
Bill Somers, one of the leading provision-merchants in Sydney,
and&mdash;" here he almost shouted&mdash;"don't I know all the
ins and outs of the business from him?"</p>

<p>My uncle glowered at me for the rest of the meal, and I was
glad to get back to town.</p>

<p>I was engaged at that time to one of the nicest girls in
Sydney (who also ought to be mine). She was a great favorite of
my uncle's; and as I was then fully justified in considering
myself his heir, I had not much thought for the future. I told
Kate all about my taking a rise out of the old man, and, to my
surprise, she told me that I was very foolish. What was the good
of contradicting my uncle about such a trivial thing? This
annoyed me; and although, as I said before, I am not at all of an
argumentative disposition, still I feel it my duty to assert
myself and not allow statements to pass unchallenged when I know
them untrue. I told Kate something like this; but she did not
agree with me, and we parted rather coldly.</p>

<p><br>
I WENT out to lunch at Nardoo Cottage next day; but, as
ill-luck would have it, we had not got half-way through the meal
when my uncle a subject on which I hold strong
views&mdash;strong, simply because they are right. I like meat
well-done, and contend that is the proper and healthy way to cook
it. My uncle likes meat underdone&mdash;raw, I call it; and most
absurdly insists that it is more nutritious when taken so. Over
this apparently insignificant subject we fell out; and, my uncle
being somewhat bitter and personal in his remarks, I retorted
rather smartly (I can be very sarcastic when it pleases me):</p>

<p>"I suppose Bill Somers liked his meat raw?"</p>

<p>I thought he was going to throw something at me.</p>

<p>"Bill Somers was not a jackanapes like you, so he liked his
food properly cooked," he growled.</p>

<p>"Let me see," I returned, reflectively, as I opened a bottle
of soda water. "You say he traded down to the Cannibal Islands. I
suppose that is where he acquired the taste."</p>

<p>"Leave my house!" shouted my uncle at the top of his voice. I
laughed, and remarked that I would look rather queer appearing in
the street bareheaded, with a glass in one hand and a bottle of
soda in the other. This maddened him still more, but I did not
let it disturb me, for we had rows like this whenever we met.
Really, I must admit that the old fellow had been very kind to
me.</p>

<p><br>
WHEN I met Kate that evening she said, "How can you be so
silly as to keep irritating your uncle? He called here this
afternoon, and I could see that you have offended him very
deeply. You will go too far some day."</p>

<p>This annoyed me very much. Kate evidently meant that my
conduct might make a difference in my prospects; and this, I
consider, hardly showed a proper appreciation of me. I knew that
my uncle had in reality far too much admiration for my talents
and ability to quarrel seriously. In fact, I was quite sure that
he respected me all the more for my sturdy independence. Kate did
not agree with me, and made a most uncalled-for remark to the
effect that my conceit would be the ruin of me. We parted still
more coldly than before, but I felt that Kate needed a lesson as
well as my uncle.</p>

<p>I had to return to the station in a day or two, but was
invited to dinner at Nardoo Cottage, to meet a few friends of my
uncle. He was a forgiving old boy, I must say.</p>

<p>"Now, Harry," said Kate, "do not go out of your way to
contradict your uncle this evening. Remember the difference in
your ages and positions, and what you owe him."</p>

<p>I gave Kate a bit of my mind in return, and reduced her to
tears before I left.</p>

<p><br>
THERE were a bank-manager and two squatters at dinner that
evening, and the talk was mostly "shop." I rather flatter myself
on having stated my opinions upon stock-breeding and
station-management confidently and in a way that left an
impression. We were smoking with our wine, and the subject of
cigars came up. Now, I am as good a judge of a cigar as any man,
so, when my uncle praised those we were smoking, I lost my
patience, for they were really nothing to brag about.</p>

<p>"They aren't bad," I commenced, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the old gentleman snapped in: "Confound your impudence!
Not bad, indeed! You conceited young blockhead! do you know the
difference between a cigar and a cabbage?"</p>

<p>All the other old fogies chuckled; and, very naturally, I felt
nettled. However, I knew how to rub it in, so I exhaled a long
puff of smoke and drawled out: "I presume Bill Somers selected
them."</p>

<p>My uncle went purple. If apoplexy had only carried him off
just then, I should have been right. He gasped, and then
restraining his passion by a great effort, said quite quietly,
"I have a word to say to you later on."</p>

<p>I was very facetious the rest of the evening. Emboldened by
the way I had put the old man down, I had two or three more sly
little hits about Bill Somers, until I felt that I must not wear
the joke threadbare. That's the best of my wit&mdash;I always
know when to stop; I don't run a thing to death like most men.
At a sign from my uncle, I stayed behind when the others
left.</p>

<p>"Henry Jamison," he said, "you appear to have deliberately
gone out of your way to insult me every time you have accepted my
hospitality. To-morrow you will return to Grimgums (the station),
and remain there until you hear from me. Good night."</p>

<p>He certainly had the last word, and as I strolled townward I
felt very wroth at the mean and unjust accusation he had brought
against me. Just because he was too dense to understand my
perhaps rather subtle humor and certainly harmless chaff, he said
that I "insulted" him. I returned to Grimgums feeling very sure
that my uncle would be extremely sorry for his conduct.</p>

<p>Scarcely had I been a week on the station when I received the
following astounding epistle:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Jamison</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">
If you look back, as I have done, you will, I am sure,
agree with me that our tempers are not sufficiently sympathetic
to hold out any prospect of happiness in the future. I have no
wish to enter into details, as I know a little reflection will
convince you that I am acting for the best. Your uncle, who was
always in favor of our engagement, reluctantly admits that lam
right. We will, therefore, consider the engagement at an end, but
I shall always remain your sincere friend,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Kate Denby.</span></p>

<br>

<p>Was there ever such a shameful thing? Just because a girl
cannot have everything her own way, she deliberately throws a man
over. This letter was enough to give me food for thought, but I
was fairly puzzled by one I received from my uncle a few days
later. In it there was the following passage:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
So through your infernal conceit and foolish want of tact
you have lost one of the best girls in the world; but there is
one thing I can tell you: you will be the only loser in the
matter&mdash;she certainly shall not.</p>

<br>

<p>Fancy! I, conceited! A more modest man does not live. I may
have sufficient self-respect to estimate myself at my right
value, but that is all.</p>

<p>Explanation of my uncle's remark came to me in the form of a
newspaper with a marked paragraph some six weeks later. My uncle
and Kate Denby were married!!!</p>

<p>I was so justly incensed that I resigned my billet at
once.</p>

<p>This happened three years ago, and the other day my uncle
died&mdash;leaving a widow and a son and heir.</p>

<p>I suppose the brat's godfather was Bill Somers.</p>

<h2><a id="ch21"></a>21. &mdash; A BUSH IDYLL</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney,  9 Jun 1900</h3>

<p class="cp"><i>(Sis, Ciss and Cissie are common 19th century
pet names for "Elizabeth".)</i></p>
<br>

<p class="first">
THE girl sat on the trunk of a fallen tree, apparently in
maiden meditation, fancy free, but, in reality, deep in a brown
study of quite a different nature. She was fair to look upon; she
had not 'a wealth of golden hair,' but she had a sufficiently
substantial pig-tail of her own, tied up at the end with a piece
of soiled blue ribbon. Also, she had on a short serviceable
riding skirt, and a pair of boy's boots. She was in tears, and in
trouble, and although she did not quite fill out all the details
of a heroine of romance, she approached that fair young creature
sufficiently near to be able to appropriate the character.</p>

<p>She sat on the fallen tree, and flicked her boot with her
riding whip, and sobbed. Something had evidently gone wrong with
her, for she murmured at intervals that 'he' was a beast; and she
would never forgive him. Birds flitted about her, and gurgled
melodious music in her ears; but she heeded them not, and when a
playful kangaroo-rat, encouraged by the stillness, came and fed
right in front of her and even wiped the nose of its timid son,
who had a cold in his head; beyond throwing her whip at it she
stirred not. The kangaroo-rat fled in terror, the birds whispered
together, and the girl, finally got up, and, wiping her eyes,
proceeded to first pick up her whip, and then continue her
way.</p>

<p>The track was but a bridle track, leading, now amongst forest
gums, and at times amongst the close scrub lining the banks of a
creek, from Which trilled the blithe notes of the bell-bird.
Still the girl kept steadily on. At times, she would look at the
track, and mutter to herself, 'The beast, he has gone straight
home;' then she plodded wearily on her way once more.</p>

<p>Presently the trampling of approaching hoofs was heard, and a
long, lean, freckled youth appeared on the scene, riding an
ancient-looking horse of the generally-useful breed.</p>

<p>'Ullo, Sis,' he said, when he met the girl.</p>

<p>'Ullo, yourself,' returned the maiden. 'See my pony as yer
come along?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I saw him about two miles back. Get away from yer?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Yer must be a great fool; yer couldn't catch him, and
bring him back. Must 'ave known that he'd got away from me.'</p>

<p>'Never thought of it,' returned the youth, hanging negligently
on the neck of his steed. 'He'd broken his bridle in two places.
I supposed he'd chucked you, and got away.'</p>

<p>'So he did. Anyhow, he fell down. Much you seem to care
whether I was hurt or not.'</p>

<p>'Well, you know, it was this way. I was thinking about that
grey mare of yourn that yer father is thinking about swapping for
one of ours, and there now, I quite forgot to tell you, but
father was a bit muzzy to-day, and there was a mob of travelling
stores came through the township, and he, being a bit on you
know, came out on the street, and says he to one of the men,
"Young fellow, you don't know how to drive cattle more'n a crow;
just let me show yer," and before that fellow could get away he
snatched the whip out 'r his hand, and commenced cracking the
whip right in front of the mob. Lor', Sis, there was a
hullabaloo. Away they went, and all the fellows after them, and
some of 'em got pulled off by clothes lines, and some went over
the wire fences, and father and the man in charge fought it out
in front of MacJoyce's and father got a black eye, and what with
laughing over that and thinking of them cattle clearing out, and
seeing your pony, and thinking how you must have got a spill, I
was very near choking myself with laughing.'</p>

<p>'Well, look here, Tom Livingstone, I don't think it was kind
of you to laugh at the idea of my getting chucked off.'</p>

<p>'Well, Sis I know you never got hurt, but I was that tickled
at the cattle rushing, and father getting a black eye, that I
couldn't help laughing at anything.'</p>

<p>'I'm tired, Tom; lend me your horse to go home&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I hate walking, and I've got to look for that working bullock
as was lost four weeks ago.'</p>

<p>'Go away. You've got to do nothing of the sort. You're going
down to see Lizzie Trueboy, the cat. That's were you're going.
Well, like takes to like; she's got red hair, and your's is close
up the same.'</p>

<p>'She hasn't got red hair.'</p>

<p>'As red as red can be. Why, you could light yer pipe at
it.'</p>

<p>'Now, don't be nasty, Sis. I didn't say as I wouldn't lend you
the horse.'</p>

<p>The youth slowly and languidly got off. Then he threw the
off-side stirrup-iron over the seat of the saddle, which,
according to bush tradition, transforms a man's saddle into a
side-saddle with ease and celerity. He put the girl up in a slow,
methodical manner, which seemed to please her, for she remarked
that she couldn't bear fellows who nearly chucked you over the
horse, and then he said, 'Give us a cheeker, Sis.'</p>

<p>'Go awn, get Lizzie to give you a cheeker. You know your going
down there.'</p>

<p>'I'm not. Honour bright, I'm going for one of Jack Smalley's
pups.'</p>

<p>'Get me one, Tom; I want a pup badly.'</p>

<p>'Well, all right; if you give me a cheeker.'</p>

<p>The girl stooped down, and under the rays of the setting sun
bestowed a chaste salute on the freckled cheek of the youth. Then
she straightened herself up, and gave him a cut with her
whip.</p>

<p>'Now, don't let me hear any more of your going to see Lizzie,'
she said.</p>

<p>'You won't; is it fair play, Sis?'</p>

<p>The girl laughed, and rode off, and the youth with a contented
smile on his face, proceeded on his way.</p>

<p><br>
SIX months had passed, and the same girl was riding her pony
along the same bush track, when the freckled youth who had shot
up with remarkable diligence into something approaching a man,
met her once more.</p>

<p>'Sis, do you remember that time as you lost your pony, and I
lent you my horse?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Tom. I hope you kept your promise.'</p>

<p>'Didn't know as I made any promise. Anyhow, you remember
father getting a black eye from a drover chap?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Tom.'</p>

<p>'Well, blessed if he hasn't got muzzy again, and challenged
all the township to wrastle him. Tom M'Shure took him up, and
threw him, and broke his leg. Now, Sis, he's laid up there in
splints. Wot d'ye say if we get spliced; we mightn't have such a
chance for a long time?'</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>'Yes, Tom,' she said, coyly.</p>

<h2><a id="ch22"></a>22. &mdash; THE PITURI CURSE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney,  25 Mar 1899</h3>

<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>

<p class="first">
TWO men are camped at a small waterhole in a creek running a
serpentine course through level, treeless country.</p>

<p>The course of the creek is marked by warped and crooked
coolabah trees and occasional bushes of lignum. The horses are
feeding on the dry Mitchell grass, one man was sauntering around
the waterhole, the other was standing by the fire with the tea
bag in his hand watching for the quart pots to boil. Presently
his companion came up to him, holding something in his hand.</p>

<p>'Those niggers must have left in a hurry, Dick, All the fires
are still alight over there.'</p>

<p>'They would see us coming a long way off in this sort of
country,' replied Dick.</p>

<p>'And one of them left this behind.'</p>

<p>And Butler held up a sort of pouch made of the skin of a
bandicoot. Dick took it and inspected the contents, which looked
like chopped dry grass.</p>

<p>'Pituri,' he said.</p>

<p>'Yes, they were in a hurry to leave that behind, for there's
none to be got anywhere near here.'</p>

<p>'All the blacks here pituri-eaters?'</p>

<p>'Pretty well all, I think; but it comes from right away west,
and they swop from tribe to tribe.'</p>

<p>'I'll take this back with me. I know a doctor in Sydney who is
always going in for experiments. He'd give anything for
this.'</p>

<p>'Ullo! Here's a nigger coming,' said Dick. A blackfellow was
visible, wandering about the deserted blacks' camp.</p>

<p>'Blessed if he isn't looking for the pituri,' whispered Dick
to Butler. 'I've heard that when they become confirmed
pituri-eaters they will risk anything to get a fresh supply.'</p>

<p>The native presently approached the camp, and as he came up he
held both hands up to show he was unarmed. The men beckoned to
him to come on, and he advanced. When within a few paces he saw
the skin pouch in Dick's hand, and held out his hand entreatingly
for it.</p>

<p>'All right, old man,' said Butler. 'You shall have it back,
but I want a pinch first.'</p>

<p>His words were of course unintelligible to the native, but he
seemed to construe it into a refusal. His face became that of a
madman's. He jerked his leg up, and they saw he had been dragging
a spear held between his toes. But quick as he was the whites
were quicker. Before he could pick up and hurl his spear, two
revolver bullets brought him to the ground.</p>

<p>Dick had let the pituri pouch fall when he drew his revolver,
and the dying native dragged himself over to it. He spat out at
the men, blood and froth, and spat at the pituri; men, turning
slowly over, with a shudder, died.</p>

<p>'He was a nice vicious old party,' said Dick. 'If we hadn't
been smart it would have been all up with one of us.'</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
'DOCTOR, lend me five or ten bob, will you? I'm clean stumped,
and had to sleep in the park last night.'</p>

<p>The speaker was a man not yet in rags, but in the last degree
of shabbiness, and pervading him was the air of the gentleman who
had come down with a quick run. The man he addressed was
clean-shaved, severe-looking, with M.D. written all over him.</p>

<p>'Look here, Graham, this sort of thing cannot go on for ever.
You had a chance to go away where you were not known, but you got
drunk and missed it. Now, you are trying to live on borrowing
from old friends, and you know that cannot last.'</p>

<p>Graham looked down at his shabby, broken boots, and said, 'I'd
go away now if I could, but I can't go without money, and you
know I'm ostracised in Sydney.'</p>

<p>The doctor took half a crown from his pocket.</p>

<p>'That's quite enough for you to get drunk on. Don't bother me
any more.'</p>

<p>Graham took the coin greedily, and was turning to shuffle
away, when a strange look came suddenly over the doctor's face,
and he called him back.</p>

<p>'I could put you in the way of making some money,' he said.
'Come home with me now, and I'll tell you how.'</p>

<p>'I'll come in an hour's time,' returned Graham. 'No, you will
not. If you want this chance you must come now. In an hour's time
you will be drunk with that half-crown, and have for gotten
everything. Will you come or not&mdash;this is a last
chance?'</p>

<p>'I will come,' said Graham.</p>

<p>Dr. Sparker hailed a hansom, and the two got in, and were
driven to the doctor's residence.</p>

<p>'I suppose I must give you a nip to straighten you up,' said
the doctor, as he took his shabby guest into the dining-room. He
poured out a stiff nip of brandy, then locked the doors of the
sideboard, and put the key in his pocket.</p>

<p>'Wait here until I come back. I have some things to attend to.
Then we can talk.'</p>

<p>Left to himself Graham sat quiet, enjoying the feeling of the
strong stimulant causing a glow through his system, and wondering
what was expected of him. Sparker was by no means a charitable
man, nor one who would have any thing to do with an ex-solicitor
struck off the rolls for embezzlement, and now sunk to the status
of a street loafer. He looked round the room, with its somewhat
solid furniture, and recalled the time when he, too, had a
comfortable, well-furnished house, before speculation made him a
thief. He was still pondering over things when the doctor came
back.</p>

<p>'I am at leisure now,' he said, 'come with me and I will tell
you what you can do for a living&mdash;for enough to take you to
another country and give you a start there, at any rate.'</p>

<p>He led the way to a room fitted up partly as a library and
partly as a laboratory. Sparker motioned him to a chair, and sat
down himself.</p>

<p>'I am engaged on a very interesting experiment just now. A
friend of mine brought me some of the leaves of a plant which
grows in the interior, and which possesses peculiar properties.
Some of these properties are known, some&mdash;and I believe the
most valuable&mdash;are not known. I am convinced that I know
what they are, but I am anxious to see their effect exemplified.
In fact, I want somebody to experiment on.'</p>

<p>'No, thank you,' said Graham, rising shakily. 'I'm not on for
the job.'</p>

<p>'Sit down, you d&mdash;&mdash;d fool, and listen. Here, I
suppose I must give you another nip to strengthen those bits of
thread you call nerves.'</p>

<p>He took down a bottle, and gave Graham another dose.</p>

<p>'Now, do you think I'm such an idiot as to give you anything
likely to prove fatal? Do you imagine I want to be hanged for
poisoning a dead beat? You can set your mind at rest about that.
The stuff may give you a headache or make you a bit sick, but
that is not much to stand. What I want to find but is the effect
on the brain. Yours is pretty well gone, I suppose, but there's
enough left for my purpose.'</p>

<p>'I don't like the idea,' said Graham, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>'Stuff and nonsense! Look here, I'll pay your passage to the
Cape if you like, and give you a decent rig-out and a few pounds
against you land. Nobody knows you there, and you can make a
fresh start.'</p>

<p>Graham still seemed doubtful. Sparker had strolled over to the
window.</p>

<p>'Come here,' he said.</p>

<p>Graham went over to him. The window looked on the street,
outside on the pavement stood the most tattered wreck of an old
loafer that could well be found, even in Sydney, the city of
loafers and beggars. Blear-eyed, sodden, and abject, he was
applying for alms to each well dressed passer-by with some
cringing tale.</p>

<p>'Refuse my offer, and in less than two years that's what
you'll be. You're little better now.'</p>

<p>'There's absolutely no danger?'</p>

<p>'None whatever.'</p>

<p>'Very well; I consent.'</p>

<p>'That's right. Now, I think I've got a suit of clothes that
will fit you. We're much of a size. You can go to the bath room,
and have a good bath, and change, then you will have lunch here
with me, and spend a quiet afternoon afterwards with a book. That
will steady your nerves.'</p>

<p>Graham ate a good lunch, and went up to the doctor's
sitting-room, promising to stop quietly there and amuse himself
with a book while the doctor went on his afternoon rounds. He
read for an hour or so, then the craving for something to drink
came back again. He thought he would just stroll out and get a
nip, and come straight back. He had the half crown in his
pocket.</p>

<p>No, he hadn't. He had left it in his old clothes. He went up
to the bathroom to get it; but every thing had been tidied up,
and put away. The doctor kept a well-ordered household. Now that
he saw no chance of getting anything the craving grew worse and
worse. He tried the library door, but that was locked. He went
back to the sitting-room, and rang the electric bell. The man who
had waited on them at lunch appeared.</p>

<p>'I have to wait until Dr. Sparker returns. I am not very well.
Could you get me a glass of spirits?'</p>

<p>'Certainly, sir. The doctor left word to bring you what you
wanted.'</p>

<p>The man left the room, and presently returned with a glass of
brandy and a bottle of soda water. He opened the soda, and Graham
swallowed it contentedly. The man left the room, and Graham sat
down to his book once more. Gradually a feeling of annoyance
crept over him. He would ring for the man, and ask him to get the
half-crown out of the pocket of his old clothes; then he could go
out and get what he wanted. He had not the slightest feeling of
shame in the matter&mdash;he was past all such things. He sat
there thinking about ringing the bell, and gradually dropped off
fast asleep.</p>

<p>The doctor had not trusted to his promise to remain quietly in
the house.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
WHEN Graham awoke the gas was alight, and the doctor sitting
in the room reading the evening paper.</p>

<p>'Just in time for dinner,' he said. 'You have had a good
sleep; it will do you a world of good. How do you feel?'</p>

<p>Graham replied truthfully that he felt very well, and greatly
refreshed.</p>

<p>'Your room is ready,' went on his host; 'I'll take you there,
and you had better have a good wash to get the sleep out of your
eyes.'</p>

<p>Graham followed this advice, and when he descended to the
dining-room, and had a glass of sherry and bitters, life began to
look pleasant again, and he sat down to dinner with a good
appetite.</p>

<p>About 10 o'clock Sparker approached his guest, and said, 'Now,
if you're ready, we'll try our little experiment.'</p>

<p>Graham had almost forgotten his part of the contract, and he
rose rather reluctantly.</p>

<p>'Go to your room, and turn in,' continued the doctor, 'and I
will bring you the dose.'</p>

<p>Graham had no option but to comply, and he went to his room,
undressed, and got into bed. Sparker soon appeared, holding in
his hand a medicine glass containing a colorless liquid.</p>

<p>'Don't look so scared, man; it will only make you
sleep&mdash;I don't anticipate anything more.'</p>

<p>Graham swallowed the potion, which he told the doctor was
almost tasteless, and then composed himself for the sleep, which
came almost immediately. The doctor sat by the bedside, note book
in hand, watching the sleeper carefully, and occasionally feeling
his pulse. Time crept on, the traffic in the street died down to
stillness, an occasional step only was heard along the pavement;
but still the doctor kept his untiring watch until the clock
boomed the hour after midnight. Then the man in the bed suddenly
sat up, and began to talk&mdash;to talk in a strange tongue
totally incomprehensible to the watcher. Graham's eyes were open,
but perfectly vacant, and he gabbled on in this unknown language
in a way that made the doctor shiver. Sometimes he would seem to
be angry, sometimes he broke into a chant like a blackfellows'
corroboree; but always was it perfectly unintelligible. At last
he fell back, and was silent, and the doctor sat and pondered
over the strange proceeding. What language had he been talking
in, and what strange effect had the pituri drug had on his brain
to induce such a performance?</p>

<p>He sat there wondering and pondering; this was certainly an
unheard of property in the pituri plant, and it had been
developed by his method of preparing the drug. It was interesting
but not satisfactory, and Sparker foresaw that a long course of
experiments would be necessary. At the end of them Graham would
only be fit for a lunatic asylum; but that did not matter to the
doctor.</p>

<p>While thinking and making notes a movement on the bed
disturbed him. Before he could rise Graham, now apparently under
the influence of a fit of raging lunacy, threw himself on him,
and the next moment the doctor found himself fighting for his
life. It would have fared badly with the doctor had not his
opponent suddenly been smitten by what appeared to be an
epileptic fit, and fallen on the floor, showing all the symptoms
of that dire affliction.</p>

<p>The doctor, when he got his breath, put pillows under him, and
let him lie there till morning; then, finding him still
unconscious, he went and refreshed him self with a bath and a
change of clothes.</p>

<p>Graham slept on till 8 o'clock, when the doctor aroused him.
There was a queer look in his eyes that the doctor could not
understand, but he got up and dressed himself carefully with out
speaking, and came down to the breakfast table. He looked at the
doctor something like the dog looks at his master, then commenced
to eat the food off his plate with his fingers.</p>

<p>'What on earth are you doing, Graham?' said the doctor, in
utter astonishment.</p>

<p>Graham grinned vacantly, said something that was quite
unintelligible, and, picking up his knife and fork, began to eat
properly.</p>

<p>'He must have bitten his tongue badly,' thought the doctor,
'when he had that fit.'</p>

<p><br>
FOR three days Sparker had to nurse his patient, and gradually
he came back to his ordinary state and the use of his voice. He
was very quiet, evinced a strange docility with regard to
anything that the doctor required of him, and seemed to have lost
his craze for drink.</p>

<p>Callous as Sparker was where scientific research was
concerned, he yet hesitated at giving his patient a fresh dose of
pituri&mdash;for the present, at any rate. One evening a
messenger came to him requesting him to visit a man named Butler,
whom he knew well&mdash;the same who had given him the pituri
plant. On arriving at the house indicated in the message, he
found his friend in bed suffering great pain, both mentally and
physically. After prescribing for him, Butler said he had
something to say.</p>

<p>'Doctor, you remember the pituri I gave you. What have you
done with it?'</p>

<p>'I have analysed it, and am making some important discoveries
with the preparation I have made from it.'</p>

<p>'Throw it away,' cried the sick man, excitedly; 'don't make
any experiments with it It's cursed, I tell you. Cursed!'</p>

<p>'Here, Butler, you are making yourself worse by going on like
this. What's the matter with the pituri?'</p>

<p>Butler, a little calmer, told him the story of the finding of
the pituri.</p>

<p>'Now, listen. In a letter I got yesterday from a friend I
heard that Dick Cummings, as good a fellow as ever breathed, was
killed through his horse falling on him. Now I'm booked.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense,' said Sparker. 'I'll pull you through.'</p>

<p>'That you never will. But, doctor, promise to throw that stuff
away. Go and throw it over the South Head.'</p>

<p>'All right, old man I'll see about it. Now, go to sleep.'</p>

<p>Sparker went home and meditated on what he had heard, which he
naturally pooh-poohed. Graham was still up, reading quietly.
Sparker went up to his laboratory. He lit the gas, and took up
the bottle containing the pituri decoction. He looked at it, and
was half inclined to throw it out of the window, but he could.
not bring him self to do it.</p>

<p>'I will try once more with a smaller dose,' he said to
himself. 'I must find out the effect on the brain that made
Graham talk in that strange language. I believe for a time it
turned him into a savage.'</p>

<p>Graham had put down his book, and was about to go to his room
when Sparker returned.</p>

<p>'Will you try another dose to-night?' he said.</p>

<p>'Certainly,' answered Graham, in the quiet, even tone he now
spoke in. 'The last one did you good; seemed to take all the
liquor thirst out of you.'</p>

<p>Graham smiled feebly in reply. He appeared to have fallen
entirely under the dominion of the doctor, and was ready to obey
his slightest hint. He left the room, and went upstairs. Sparker
soon appeared with the medicine in a glass. Graham drank it off
without a word, and then lay back on the pillows, and apparently
went to sleep. Sparker sat down, and commenced to read, and so
the night wore on.</p>

<p><br>
JONSON, the doctor's factotum, got up in the morning, and was
informed by the housemaid that she had found the front door
unlocked and ajar when she came down. Jonson went up to his
master's room, but he was not there. Then he bethought him of the
patient's room, for Graham passed as a patient the doctor was
treating for dipsomania. He opened the door, and on the floor lay
the doctor. His eyes had been struck dead and blind when they
were staring with horror at impending death. Round his throat was
the clutch of the mad hands which had strangled the life out of
him.</p>

<p><br>
BUTLER felt better the next day, but when the attendant came
up to him in the afternoon he found him dead, and in his hands
the evening paper, with the account of the tragic death of Dr.
Sparker.</p>

<h2><a id="ch23"></a>23. &mdash; A SNAKE STORY</h2>

<h3><i>Murrurundi Times and Liverpool Plains Gazette</i>, 27 Oct
1900</h3>

<p class="first">
'SOME bush publicans,' said Jim Parks, 'try all manner of
tricks to attract custom. You mightn't think it, but they do. You
would imagine that if a man kept a good table and sold decent
liquor it would be sufficient attraction, but it is not so. They
are always trying some little dodge or other.</p>

<p>'Some try barmaids; that's a mistake, for you can't get a
decent girl to go up the bush. Others go in for a bit of
horseflesh; but they generally lose over that in the long run.
Others keep pets about the place&mdash;pet emus and kangaroos;
but they generally make horses break their bridles, and chaps
don't like that.</p>

<p>'The man I know who did best out of that kind of game was a
man who had some pet snakes. Mind you, he never let anybody know
about these snakes as a rule, but kept it dark. When a man was
getting a bit jumpy from drink, he would bring out his snakes,
and the man would make sure he had 'got 'em again,' and drink
more to steady his nerves. Well, this got about, that you could
get D.T.s. cheaper at Balmer's than any other place in the
district, and people began to flock there.</p>

<p>'Well this tort of thing went on swimmingly. Balmer got a
regular circle of clients, who need to go as often as three times
a year to get cheap horrors at Balmer's. They found that the
recovery was not nearly so bad. At other places, it took a couple
or three days of steady drinking before a man got a sign of the
jumps; but at Balmers you could see snakes after a dozen good
rums. The people got quite fascinated with the idea; and when
Balmer hit upon the notion of coloring them red, green, and
purple, his custom rose 50 per cent. I tell you, it was a real
treat to watch those old jossers swallowing the rum till Balmer
would produce a snake. Then one would cry, "I see him, it's a
green snake with a red head." Then Balmer would juggle with the
snakes, and another would cry, "No, he's a red 'un with a blue
head," and then they would argue and drink more rum.</p>

<p>'Well Balmer was doing very well out of the snakes, and if he
had only left well alone, he might have carried on the game for a
year of two longer; but, like every other man, he must try and
improve things. He imported a monkey; he thought it would give
zest to the snakes. Unfortunately, the monkey had a bad temper,
and the sight of the snake made it worse, so that when he tried
the experiment the first time on one of the regular snake men,
the old fellow gave a yell, and struck out wildly at the monkey,
and knocked it over. Then the monkey leaped on the man's back and
had hold of his ear. The man started bucking and yelling and
tearing his clothes off, he made straight for the river, and
plunged in. It was lucky for Balmer that they fished him out
before he was quite drowned. Anyhow, Balmer had to own up that
the monkey was a real monkey, for it had bitten the man's ear
through. Then they demanded the snakes. It was no use Balmer
denying that he had any; they would have them, and when it was
proved that they were real snakes, and not alcoholic ones, their
indignation knew no bounds. They would have forgiven anything but
such vile deceit. Balmer got twenty-hours to quit, or have the
place burnt down, and he decided to go.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch24"></a>24. &mdash; CLARISSA</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney,  29 Jul 1899</h3>

<p class="first">
THE editor of the <i>Platinum Beacon</i> sat in his small
office meditating on his weary lot. The day was hot, the main
street, as usual at that time of day, deserted, save for a couple
of horses with jangling bells on, and a working bullock. The
editor had just had some extremely tough mutton for his lunch,
and he was picking his teeth and cursing his fate.</p>

<p>Through the thin deal partition came the murmur of voices,
from his staff&mdash;one man and a boy&mdash;discussing the
merits of the last international cricket match. Neither of them
knew anything about cricket, any more than they did about
counterpoint but still they discussed the players and their play,
with an easy familiarity that seemed to have been born of long
acquaintance with first-class cricket.</p>

<p>A footstep came along the quiet street, turned into his door,
and the editor of the reptile contemporary, the <i>Platinum
Star</i>, entered the office. Even such a small place as West
Platinum possessed rival papers. The two editor-proprietors were
privately the best of friends, although they abused one another
roundly in their small journals.</p>

<p>'This can't go on, Dick,' said the new-comer, sitting down
gingerly on a rickety chair. 'One of us must clear out, and let
the other earn an honest penny. You stuck me for that theatrical
show the other day.'</p>

<p>The <i>Beacon</i> man laughed. 'How was that?</p>

<p>'Why, the man who is trotting them round came to me and said
that you had refused his advertisements unless the money was paid
strictly beforehand. He appealed to me as to whether this was
worthy of a high-minded and pure-toned press. He was quite sure I
was above all such unworthy scruples, degrading alike both to
himself and the press of this country?'</p>

<p>'And you were above it?'</p>

<p>'It seems to me that I was, for his ad got in. Then he
apologised for not having a shilling in his pocket, as he would
have asked me to have a glass of wine, in which to wish me a long
and prosperous career in the fourth estate.'</p>

<p>'And you went over and shouted for him, and he borrowed five
bob?'</p>

<p>'He tried to; but for once I was adamant. However, if you buy
me out you must take over the debts, so it's all the same.'</p>

<p>The <i>Beacon</i> man, whose name was Richard Fowndes, pulled
out a drawer in his table and took out a pack of cards.</p>

<p>'Draw up, Bob,' he said. 'We'll play three games of euchre for
it, and the winner has the chance of clearing out if he likes,
which assuredly he will. Nobody will be about for hours.'</p>

<p>Bob Masters drew the chair up to the ink-stained table, and
Fowndes spread an 'exchange' out to play on. Both soon became so
immersed in the game that they did not notice the trampling of a
horse outside, thinking it merely one of the usual quadrupeds who
rambled about the streets at midday. A sharp rap on the open door
aroused them, and I they both sprang up in surprise.</p>

<p>Standing at the door was a young and pretty girl, of about
eighteen. She had an evidently home-made riding-habit on her; but
even then it fitted her rounded figure very fairly. She was a
stranger to both of them.</p>

<p>'Is this the <i>Beacon</i> office?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied Fowndes.</p>

<p>The girl had two envelopes in her hand. She selected one, and
gave it to him.</p>

<p>'It is an advertisement,' she said. 'Can you tell me where the
<i>Star</i> office is? I am a stranger here.'</p>

<p>'The <i>Star</i> office is a little lower down, but this
gentleman is the editor, if you want to see him,' and he
indicated Masters.</p>

<p>'It is only a duplicate of the advertisement. If you will
kindly read it over, and say what it comes to, I will pay you,'
and she gave the <i>Star</i> man the other envelope.</p>

<p>The two opened their respective missives and a look of
bewilderment stole over both their faces.</p>

<p>'I should not have thought that you needed to put such an ad in?' said Fowndes, gently.</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' said the girl, blushing a bright red.
'It's for my uncle; he has lost a horse.'</p>

<p>'There's some mistake then; this is a matrimonial
advertisement.'</p>

<p>The girl almost, snatched it from his hand, glanced over it,
and with a horrified cry threw it down, and rushed out. Masters
sprang after her to help her mount, but she waved him off with
her whip, led her horse to a stump, and next minute was in the
saddle galloping down the main street as though she was riding
for the doctor. Masters did not attempt to speak when she waved
him away, for he saw the tears glistening in her eves.</p>

<p>'Whew!' said he, sitting down again, 'that's a queer go!'</p>

<p>This was the advertisement:</p>

<br>

<p class="headline"><i>MATRIMONIAL</i></p>

<p class="quote">
<i>The advertiser wishes to meet with a middle-aged gentleman,
of good means, with a view to matrimony. She is young, considered
to possess considerable personal charms, thoroughly domestic, and
of a fond and loving disposition. Photos exchanged. Address
'Clarissa,' care of this paper.</i></p>

<br>

<p>'Dick,' said Masters, 'we were game and game; we'll play the
rubber out some other time. I want to see this through. Any idea
who she is?'</p>

<p>'Evidently a niece of one of the farmers about here on a
visit. I am afraid somebody has been playing a coarse joke on
her, and she'll never forgive us for having seen her
discomfiture.'</p>

<p>'Well, good-bye for the present. Have a game of billiards
after dinner, as usual?' and Masters strolled out to his temple
of literature.</p>

<p><br>
CLARISSA NEWBERRY pulled in her horse when she got well
outside the town, took out her pocket-handkerchief, and dried her
bright eyes.</p>

<p>'It's that cat of a cousin of mine,' she murmured. 'She
changed the advertisements, and thought it would be a fine
joke.'</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought flashed across her mind that made her pull
her horse up short and sharp. Supposing they put the
advertisement in after all? She had never told them not to; only
that the advertisement should have been about a lost horse. No,
they did not look as if they would do that; but the suspense was
too much of a strain, even at the ordeal of having to face the
pair again she must go back and make things clear.</p>

<p>Fowndes had fallen into a doze, and was blissfully unconscious
of there being such a place as West Platinum in the universe,
when he was startled by a knock on the door, which he had closed
in order to put his feet on the table with comfort and without
observation.</p>

<p>'Come in!' he shouted; and the young lady of the advertisement
appeared.</p>

<p>'I trust, sir,' she said in a distant tone of voice, evidently
assumed for the occasion, 'that you do not imagine I wanted that
ridiculous advertisement inserted. My name is Clarissa Newberry,
and it was some absurd joke of my cousin's, I suppose.'</p>

<p>For a moment it flashed across Fowndes's mind to tell her that
it was too late, and that it would have to appear, but he saw
that it would be carrying a joke too far, and hastened to assure
her that neither of them ever dreamt of taking the ad.
seriously.</p>

<p>'By the way,' he said, 'could you not remember the proper
advertisement?' and he offered her his own chair, and sat down
gingerly on the crazy one Masters had been sitting on. He was
afraid to offer it to her, for she was a well developed young
woman, and not being used to the chair there might have been an
accident.</p>

<p>'Do you know the color and brands of the horse?' he asked.</p>

<p>'I think so, for I heard my uncle dictating it to my
cousin.'</p>

<p>'That's all right; then we'll soon fix it up,' and he wrote
out the usual 'strayed' ad, gravely mentioned the price, and
took the money.</p>

<p>'Would you mind writing one out for the other paper?' Clarissa
asked. 'Uncle said it was to be in both.'</p>

<p>'What!' said Fowndes, 'Write out an ad for our reptile
contemporary! I am afraid, Miss Newberry, you do not understand
the etiquette of journalism!'</p>

<p>'Good gracious! What's the matter?' said the girl in surprise,
taking him quite seriously. 'You seemed very friendly. You were
playing cards with him.'</p>

<p>'That was a matter of business only. We were I deciding which
of us should clear out of this gay and giddy town.'</p>

<p>'It seems a very dull place certainly,' said Miss Newberry,
who, now that her fears were allayed, seemed inclined to be
friendly and conversational; 'but you surely must have a lot to
do. I thought newspaper people were writing all day, and dared
not stop a moment.'</p>

<p>At this instant there came a deep snore, an unmistakable
snore, from the interior of the building. The man and the boy
were enjoying the regular siesta of West Platinum.</p>

<p>'Yes, the intellectual strain is occasionally very great,'
said Fowndes, rising. 'Sit still, Miss Newberry, I am just going
to put your advertisement in hand,' and he left the room.</p>

<p>Clarissa sat still in the editorial chair, and noticed that
the snoring stopped suddenly and abruptly; when there came a
voice at the door.</p>

<p>'I say, Dick, what a lark it would be&mdash;' here the speaker
stopped in amazement, not unmixed with horror, at seeing whom he
was addressing in mistake for his friend.</p>

<p>'Miss Newberry,' said Fowndes, who fortunately appeared at
that moment, 'this is Mr. Masters, the reptile whose nefarious
attempts to worm himself into the confidence of Platinum society
I am successfully checking. I will soon unmask him, and chase him
from the field.'</p>

<p>'I sincerely hope so,' returned Masters, sitting down on the
broken chair with great deliberation.</p>

<p>'Miss Newberry,' went on Fowndes, 'if you will wait and give
this poor struggling reptile your advertisement&mdash;the
creature must live, you understand&mdash;I will send a myrmidon
over the road for some tea.'</p>

<p>Miss Newberry assented; she understood their talk by this, and
by the time the tea arrived the three were on a good footing.
When the young lady departed she did not refuse to be assisted to
her saddle.</p>

<p>'Heavens!' said Masters, 'I had a narrow squeak. I was just
proposing to you to put the ad in over another name, but I
stopped in time. Very mean of you to set such a trap.'</p>

<p>'Nothing of the sort; very mean of you to come in and make
three.'</p>

<p>'Never mind, old man, you'll get another chance soon. I vote
we go out together, and pay a visit to her uncle; he's a
subscriber of mine, I believe.'</p>

<p>'Then I repudiate his acquaintance, and I cannot understand
how any man who subscribes to the Platinum <i>Star</i> could have
such a pretty niece.'</p>

<p>'No more can I; come over and have a drink. The Platinumists
are waking up, and coming out into the road to stretch themselves
and yawn.'</p>

<p><br>
MISS NEWBERRY reflected as she rode home.</p>

<p>'I am very glad that I went back. I really believe there was
some joke on. However, I've put it all straight now. Better not
let that cat of a cousin know that her joke missed fire, but I'll
pay her for it,' and quite contented with her day's work,
Clarissa Newberry rode on to her temporary home.</p>

<p>Needless to say that the two editors went out and visited the
uncle; that, on account of this unexpected and welcome break in
their lives, the two plunged into all the revelry going in the
hope of meeting Miss Newberry. Also that she never failed to
visit the offices of these two great organs of the press, and
take tea alternately with them, whenever she came into town.</p>

<p><br>
ONE day Clarissa rode in, looking, as they both thought, nice
enough to eat.</p>

<p>'I have come to say goodbye,' she said. 'I am going away
tomorrow&mdash;going home.'</p>

<p>'But you will come back some time?' they both asked
together.</p>

<p>Clarissa looked down and smiled.</p>

<p>'I cannot say exactly. I want you both to do something for
me.'</p>

<p>They both assured her of their willingness to do anything in
their power.</p>

<p>Clarissa handed them each an envelope. 'That is an
advertisement&mdash;a real matrimonial advertisement this time;
but it is not to go in for a fortnight, and you are both to
promise, on your honor, that you will not open the envelope until
that time has elapsed.'</p>

<p>Scenting a joke at the expense of her cousin, in payment of
her debt, both men assured her solemnly that the envelopes should
be held sacred.</p>

<p>'Goodbye,' she said, 'try and amuse yourselves in this dull
place,' and she rode away, and they watched her out of sight.</p>

<p>'What I like about her is her complete innocence; she has no
idea of flirting at all,' said Masters, as they strolled across
the road.</p>

<p>'Flirt!' returned Fowndes, 'there's not a bit of a flirt in
her disposition.'</p>

<p><br>
THE fortnight passed, and the two met to open the envelopes in
company. The contents of both was the same. 'Marriages' then
followed the usual announcement of a marriage in the neighboring
town, and the name of the bride was Clarissa Newberry.</p>

<p>Underneath was written:</p>

<p class="letter">
I forgot to tell you that I was engaged, and going home to
get married. I will not forget to send you some cake, and send me
the paper.</p>

<br>

<p>'Look here, Dick,' said Masters, 'we'll just sit down and
finish the rubber of euchre that the hussy interrupted.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch25"></a>25. &mdash; THE COOK'S LOVE STORY</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney,  18 Jun 1898</h3>

<p class="first">
IT is now more than 20 years ago that the little love affair I
am going to tell of came under my notice. It affected me greatly
at the time, and now that I am old it still moves me almost to
tears to think of it. It was not my love story, but one that was
enacted before me, as it were, and that's where the sad-like kind
of memory comes in, for if the young fellow had taken my advice,
he would now be a happy man instead of a desolate and melancholy
wanderer.</p>

<p>I had a job of cooking up in the north of Queensland. There
were two stockmen in the hut and two fencers. The fencers don't
come into this story. They were outer barbarians, never touched
by the tender passion. One of the stockmen, Bill Binders, was a
tall, silent man, who when he had nothing to do was either
plaiting greenhide or playing cut-throat euchre with the fencers.
Jerry Jackson, the other one, was a young man of twenty-two
summers. He had the soul of a poet in him, and a spirit that
would have adorned any station in life. To see him after killing
day, rendering down marrow to make pomade for his hair, was truly
a melting sight.</p>

<p>He confided his aspirations to me tor, as he said I was the
only one who could comprehend him. He loathed the Right Bower,
and greenhide made him feel ill. I liked that lad, and when he
used to put on a pair of riding breeches, Bedford cords made to
order, and a pair of long riding boots nicely oiled, on a Sunday,
I tell you he looked like an outlawed noble of high descent. He
could read poetry, too. He had a collection of song-books, that
had some of the sweetest verses in them that I ever heard; the
rhymes were just lovely, and he could read without having to stop
to spell the words.</p>

<p>About twenty miles away was where the main road crossed the
river, and, as usual, there was a little township growing up
there&mdash;pub, store, blacksmith's and saddler's shop, as
usual. The man who kept the store was married, and his wife's
sister came up on a visit, and Jerry and all the other young
fellows got spoons on her at once. She lived in Sydney, and
brought up all manner of dressy things that nobody up there had
ever seen before.</p>

<p>'Sammy!' Jerry said to me the first time he had seen her,
'she's an angel, and I mean to win her.'</p>

<p>Then he went away, and pored over his song-books, putting her
name in where the nice girls' names were. I had made quite a
friend of Jerry, so I felt rather jealous of this girl, and said
something about her that hurt his soul, so he begged me to go
down with him one Sunday and see her. So I went.</p>

<p>She was a nice enough girl, as girls go, for I don't care
about them very much, but I didn't think she was good enough for
Jerry. Anyhow, the people were very nice and polite, and Jerry
took me up to see them in the evening, and I put on a coat the
publican lent me, which was a little too tight to be comfortable,
and said 'yes' whenever the storekeeper asked me if I didn't
think it was a wicked shame that the Government didn't make
Bunthorn's Crossing a Municipality, so that he could be elected
mayor and work for the advancement of the country, which he said
was all he wanted to see. He didn't care a bit about himself, he
only wanted to see the country go ahead.</p>

<p>Meantime Jerry sat still and watched the girl. I confess that
he did not come out in the conversational line like I expected a
man of his attainments to do, but he looked a lot, and the girl
seemed to like it, so I suppose it was the right and proper thing
to do.</p>

<p><br>
AS we went home the next morning Jerry kept asking me if I
thought there could be a more perfectly lovely creature in the
world than Lucy Crowder, which was her name. I felt a bit chippy,
for after we left the storekeeper's house there had been a bit of
shouting at the pub, and as Jerry had brought a bottle with him,
whenever we came to some water I drank her health. Jerry would
not touch anything. He said that the remembrance of her beauty
was intoxicating enough without liquor.</p>

<p>Jerry was always down at the Crossing as long as the girl was
there. Fortunately it was dry weather, and there was nothing to
do, or he would have got the sack. The girl stopped three months,
and then she went back to Sydney, and that broke Jerry up, for
she told him that she held, him in great respect, but she could
not consent to live in the bush, but if he would settle down in a
town she would consider his offer.</p>

<p>Jerry was very gloomy, and used to talk about his life being
blighted and his young hopes withered, until the fencers used bad
language, and even Binders told Jerry to shut his head. At last
Jerry, who had saved up a bit of a cheque, made up his mind to go
to Sydney and try to get work there. I tried to persuade him not
to, and told him to stick to the bush and forget her, but he
wouldn't take my advice but chucked up his billet and started. I
heard from him in a few months. I had to get Binders to read the
letter, and what with Jerry's writing and Binders' reading I
could make very little of it until I got the Jackeroo at the head
station to make it out.</p>

<p>Jerry had got a billet at a livery stable. He was a smart
little fellow with horses, and liked It. He told me that amidst
all the giddy whirl and dazzle of the circle in which he now
moved, and the smiles of the beautiful sirens by whom he was
surrounded, he was true to the one love of his life. He had not
seen her. He found Sydney a bigger place than he had reckoned on.
He had thought to meet her in the main street, or mayhap they
would know her at the post office, but no-one seemed to know her,
although, as he said, her beauty should have drawn all eyes on
her. He asked me to obtain her address from the storekeeper's
wife, but I did not succeed.</p>

<p><br>
THE first time I went to the Crossing I met two old chums, and
we got a bit on the burst, and the second time, the store keeper
had just gone bankrupt, and his wife was that stuck up and
haughty in consequence, that I couldn't get an answer from her.
So I got the Jackeroo to write Jerry a letter telling him that I
might come down to Sydney myself at the end of the year, and I
went.</p>

<p>Jerry scarcely knew me when I turned up at the yard, and no
wonder, for I had my hair and beard cut, and wore store clothes,
a paper collar, and had socks on. But he was very glad to see me,
and as he was just knocking off, he took me up into a little room
he had and we sat down for a yarn.</p>

<p>'I have found her, Sam,' he said, 'and now I almost wish I
hadn't.'</p>

<p>'What's up Jerry?' I said. 'Some bloke cut you out?'</p>

<p>'No, it is not that quite; but fancy, she is a waitress in a
restaurant. That peerless creature has to carry round plates of
stewed tripe and grilled chops for hungry people who pay
sixpence, I went to a sixpenny show to get my dinner once, and
sat down, never thinking such a moment was near. A girl came
behind me, and I heard a voice that is woven in my heart-strings,
saying "Stewed steak, grill'd steak, grill'd chops, lambs' fry,
Irish stew&mdash;O Lord! It's Jerry!" I turned and saw Lucy
Crowder. She looked lovely, even in the cap and apron, that a
despotic keeper of a restaurant made her wear, but oh, to see her
thus.</p>

<p>'"So you've come down to Sydney, Mr. Jackson," she said, much
cooler than I was. I scarcely knew what I said, for how could I
utter what I felt amidst the clatter of knives, forks and plates
and the murmur of conversation. But I made an appointment to meet
her after hours. Fancy, Sam, how I sat through that meal
listening to that adorable woman being told to hurry up with the
stew and look sharp with the sauce, but, Sammy, it cut me to the
heart. We have met since, but Sam, I have a rival.</p>

<p>'"Why, of course," I said. "A fine girl like that is bound to
have more nor one bloke after her. Who is he, can you plug
him?"</p>

<p>'I tell you, Sam, how I found it out. I noticed that Lucy kept
regarding me curiously, and one day she said in that artless
manner, which is her greatest charm, "Jerry, why don't you
cultivate a fringe?" "A fringe?" I said. "Yes," she replied, "I
know, several gentlemen who wear them. You'd look so elegant in
one. Mr. Topkins has got a splendid one. He looks a real toff."
"Who's Mr. Topkins?" I demanded. "O, he'd a gentleman friend of
mine." She would not tell me more, but I soon traced out the
miserable Topkins. He is a barber. I own, for I will not slander
even a rival, that he has a magnificent wavy fringe, but I will
have one too before long.'</p>

<p>Jerry took up a comb, and standing before a little
looking-glass, he combed his hair down over his forehead.</p>

<p>'How do I look, Sammy?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Not so well, Jerry; your hair's too straight, lad; it won't
curl.'</p>

<p>'It shall curl,' he replied gloomily; 'Listen to me, Sam; I
have a scheme in view. I have seen my hated rival, but he does
not know that he is my rival. He has advantages, he has a
beautiful fringe, and unlimited command of pomalum and hair oil,
and he belongs to a push. But I will grow a fringe if I spends a
fortune on it, and I will join a push.</p>

<p>'Go on, Jerry.' I said, 'you look better without a fringe, and
if you join a push they'll lead you into trouble, and you'll lose
your billet. Go and stoush the barber if you like, then the girl
won't think about him.'</p>

<p>'But listen to my plan, Sam. I intend to make my hated rival
grow the fringe. That will be sweet revenge, and to-morrow I
commence.'</p>

<p>'Come on, Jerry, and have some beer,' I said.</p>

<p>I went to the eating house with Jerry, and saw Lucy, who
pretended not to remember me in my town togs, but she did, I'm
sure. Then, to carry on the game, I went and got trimmed up at
the Topkins shop.</p>

<p>Jerry soon grew desperate. No matter what pains he went to,
the barber could not make his hair stop in curl; plaster it down
ever so, it would be straight in his eyes before half an hour was
over. And the torments he suffered. After Topkins had finished
with Jerry he picked up a comb, and, smirking in the glass, gave
his own fringe one dexterous twist, and looked at it as much as
to say, that's something like a fringe, my boy.</p>

<p>Poor Jerry, I used to pity him, but I told him what a fool he
was&mdash;that the barber would take his money and sell him hair
oil and bear's grease to further orders, and promise him that the
fringe was coming on; but it would never come.</p>

<p>'Your hair's not built that way, Jerry. It's just like cattle
and horses, and you ought to know it. It's all breeding. That
barber's folks always had fringes, and your people didn't.'</p>

<p>It was drawing near the end of my holiday, when Jerry said to
me one day, 'Come to me after six o'clock.'</p>

<p>I went.</p>

<p>'Sammy,' said he, 'you must swear that you will never reveal
to mortal man what I am going to show you. I have done it; no
more shall the arrogant Topkins flourish his fringe in front of
me, and, pocket my money. Miss Crowder shall be mine.'</p>

<p>I looked at Jerry. His hair was just as straight and lank as
ever, but he seemed confident.</p>

<p>'You see what I have tried, Sammy,' he went on, waving his
hand round the little room, where there were rows of empty
bottles of patent hair restorers, waffles, etc.</p>

<p>'Now, I know better. I agree with you it is useless, It's
breeding, as you say. Now, shut your eyes, and don't open them
till I tell you.'</p>

<p>I did so, wondering what was up. Perhaps Jerry had suddenly
gone mad and meant to stab me unawares. I heard him moving
about the room, and then he suddenly said: 'Behold!'</p>

<p>I opened my eyes, and there stood Jerry. His hat was wall back
on his head, after the style of the push he had joined, and
above his eyes was a magnificent fringe of curly hair. The effect
was imposing, and it was some minutes before I dropped to it.</p>

<p>'Why, Jerry,' I said, you've been and bought a wig.'</p>

<p>'Not a wig, Sam; a fringe, a bang. Isn't it fine?'</p>

<p>'But, Lord! Miss Crowder wouldn't believe that that fringe
growed in a day.'</p>

<p>'Hush. Topkins has a rival in trade, Professor Stropper. He
sells a magic wash that grows hair on an egg. I keep quiet for a
week. Stropper's magic wash does the business. Topkins will lose
both his trade and his bride. Do you see?'</p>

<p>I entreated Jerry to give up his mad scheme, but no, he set to
work, and wrote a testimonial for Stropper, which that worthy
would have printed. A week passed, and Jerry, who had kept out of
sight, under the plea of illness, went out with the fringe on to
meet his sweetheart. He came back an accepted man.</p>

<p><br>
FOR a week there was great joy in the heart of Jerry, and
Topkins was nowhere. Stropper left printed bills in his shop, and
otherwise annoyed him. Then Topkins and Jerry met at a picnic
down the harbor. The eye of the barber detected the fraud at
once. Backed up by his push, he got close to Jerry, and, by a
sudden dash, plucked the false fringe from his forehead in the
presence of his betrothed. They had it out, and I am glad to say
Jerry thrashed the barber, but he lost his wife. Poor lad, he
showed me her letter.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
'No, Mr. Jackson,' it read, 'I lost my heart to you in that
fringe, but without it you are as any other man to me. I could
not bear to see my husband putting on his bang of a morning, and
taking it off at night. Henceforth we are friends, if you like,
but not lovers. Now the fringe of Mr. Topkins is natural, and his
own. He bears no malice, and bids me say that after we are
married, and time has soothed the feeling you once entertained,
he will always be glad to cut your hair for nothing. Farewell, I
forgive you the deception, but it was too cruel.'</p>

<p><br>
JERRY took to running mails; he says that the constant
exercise keeps him from thinking. Stropper had to shut up shop,
as Topkins threatened him with fraud, false pretences, and I
don't know what all.</p>

<h2><a id="ch26"></a>26. &mdash; A YARN OF A PUB</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney,  3 Apr 1897</h3>

<p class="first">
JIM wrote to me the other day as follows:</p>

<p>I have got a yarn for you, and though you know I much prefer
telling tales to writing one, in this case I have to write
it.</p>

<p>An old friend mine, called Jerry Downes, you will remember his
name was Jerry, because there was a Sam Downes, who got into
trouble. He came to see me the other night&mdash;Jerry, not
Sam&mdash;and he told me this yarn of what happened to him a
short time back away up in Queensland.</p>

<p>Jerry was travelling at the time, and he came to a small
roadside pub about 3 o'clock. It was dry weather at the time, and
Jerry thought it one of the prettiest places he'd seen. There was
a good spring and a patch of black soil, and everything was green
just about; while there was a good garden. The house was well
built, with a broad, shady verandah, an altogether very inviting
look to a tired man on a hot day. Says Jerry, 'I'll make a short
day of it, and turn out.' There was another horse tied up outside
the verandah; so Jerry rode up, tied his prad up, too, and went
inside.</p>

<p>What he saw nearly struck him silly. It was a neat, tidy bar,
and inside stood a decent old man and a pretty girl, seemingly
his daughter, for just as Jerry got inside she screamed out,
'Owch, father! there's one gone down my back; stop him for
me.'</p>

<p>Her father did so, and then commenced chasing some invisible
object over the counter with the bottom of a thick 'free-fight'
tumbler.</p>

<p>The other occupants of the room were an old bummer, sitting on
a bench with a glass of rum, and a young fellow standing just in
front of Jerry. Presently the old bummer jumped up with a yell,
and hopped round swearing that something or other had gone up the
leg of his trousers. Then the girl hopped put of the bar, holding
her skirts tightly round her ankles; while the landlord still
kept pursuing nothing across the counter with the tumbler.</p>

<p>The other man turned to look at Jerry, and said, 'What the
blazes is this? Is it loonies or jumps?'</p>

<p>'It's triantalopes!' yelled the old bummer. (As you know, some
people call those big spiders triantalopes.)</p>

<p>'Triantalopes be absquatulated,' said Jerry; 'there's no
triantalopes here!'</p>

<p>'Oh! ain't there,' said the landlord. 'What's this? and this?'
and he banged and thumped.</p>

<p>'If that's the styles of brands you keep,' said the man, 'I'll
get my drink elsewhere.'</p>

<p>Jerry looked all round, but not a trace of a spider could he
see.</p>

<p>'Look here!' he said. There's two men says that the place is
full of blooming triantalopes, or whatever you call them, and
there's two men as says there's not one on the place. Now, we'll
have drinks on that, and chance the jim-jams.'</p>

<p>The girl I may mention, had retired to investigate matters in
private.</p>

<p>Jerry and the man went up to the bar, and the landlord left
off his pursuit, and put the bottles down.</p>

<p>'Now produce your triantalopes!' said Jerry.</p>

<p>'There's one, and there's one,' said the landlord.</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened. The man who had entered just
before Jerry suddenly exclaimed; 'By&mdash;&mdash;! he's right!'
and lifting his whip struck at something on the counter. Jerry
looked down, and suddenly caught sight of a great hairy spider on
his shirt sleeve.</p>

<p>Then they saw them everywhere&mdash;great brutes with red eyes
and long hairy legs, running about all ever the place.</p>

<p>'Here!' said the man; 'I'm off. I don't like this kind of
stock on a run.' And he went out, get on his horse, and rode
away.</p>

<p>Jerry was nearly following, but he thought he would like to
find out how it was that they did not see these wretches, when
they first came in. Now they were plain enough. Above all, they
did not seem to bite, and it was impossible to hit one, no matter
how you tried.</p>

<p>'What's the meaning of this?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Don't I wish I could tell you,' says the landlord.</p>

<p>'But where do they come from; and why didn't we two see them
when we first came in?'</p>

<p>'Ask me something easy. I bought them with the place that's
all I know.'</p>

<p>'What did you buy them for? Hanged if I'd have done it.'</p>

<p>'Bought them because I didn't see them, like you. I'll tell
you all about it. These triantalopes have made up their minds
nobody shall live in this place, and when there's buying and
selling going on they keep quiet and don't show. This place has
changed hands scores of times. It's a nice little spot, barring
these scarecrows. They're as cunning as camels, and almost as
big. I'm afraid the place is too well known for me to sell.</p>

<p>'Do you get used to them?'</p>

<p>'No; just look at 'em. Now, could you? A spider's not a
racehorse, as a rule, but you might as well try to catch one as
the other. They don't bite, only stare at you and run over you,
and drive all the custom away.'</p>

<p>'They're not natural spiders, seemingly.'</p>

<p>'They are not; they're demons, that's just what they are. If
you like to stop and see more of 'em you' can&mdash;for they go
away at eight.</p>

<p><br>
JERRY felt interested, and thought he would, and in fact
stopped two or three days. He had a good lock through the place,
and saw that it would pay well. There was a good paddock and
stables and it stood on freehold ground. For a man like myself,
thought Jerry, a bit of a racing man, it would be a little
paradise; but those spiders would have to clear out first.</p>

<p>Jerry didn't let on, but just watched and observed the habits
of those spiders, and he was convinced that they were spooks of
some sort&mdash;you could never get used to their blamed ugly
ways.</p>

<p>Now, he knew my taste on the matter, and as soon as he'd
finished his yarn he says: 'Jim, this is right into your hand.
You go up with me and have a look at the house, and if you think
you can do anything towards curing the place, why, it's a
bargain. We'd get it for a song between us.'</p>

<p>I've been thinking over Jerry's proposal, and have concluded
it's a deal. I can get away for a few months without much,
trouble, and there's evidently money in it. Now, what I want of
you is to get me all the books you know about spooks and send
them to me to study. I must go up prepared. If you'd look through
them and mark any part you think applies to the case, I should
feel greatly obliged.</p>

<p><br>
I GOT the books, and I had a look through, but found nothing
to apply to the case of a house haunted by demon tarantulas, so I
sent them on and asked him to write me how he got on. It was
nearly three months before I heard as follows:</p>

<p>I beat them all right, but it was a hard job&mdash;the hardest
I ever tackled. They were demons. Jerry and I went up there, and
I found it just all he said&mdash;the completest and snuggest
little crib going&mdash;and I felt bound to have it, spiders or
no spiders. The landlord was more worried than when Jerry had
seen him, and when he asked him about business he just laughed a
hideous, joyless laugh, and says:</p>

<p>'Business! The business I do would astonish you. It's no use
pretending, because your mate here knows all about it; but
business is just this way. Men ride along here and pull up and
sing out underneath, the verandah, "How's spiders today?" or
"What price triantalopes?" That's the brisk and lively trade that
I'm doing.'</p>

<p><br>
WE were very cautious about it, and at last got the place for
a trifle. Then, when Jerry and I were alone, I started to work
studying the books, and meanwhile tried a few experiments of my
own. I'd lecture them on their evil ways, point out to them that
their proper place was in the wood-yard, ask them why they didn't
take their drinks and go, and all that. But I it didn't do a bit
of good; and, in fact, I never expected it would, but I was just
keeping my hand in. I went into their habits, and found that they
must be spooks, from their complete way of disappearing at night.
If they'd been genuine spiders they'd have been, knocking about
just the same. But no! they went clean away. I may as well tell
you that while the negotiations for the sale were going on they
had evacuated the premises.</p>

<p>I wondered very much what sort of spooks they were? Had they
any right to the place before the whites came? Were they the
souls of niggers who had been murdered? I could make nothing of
them at all. I stuck to those books, and I must say that they
were the heaviest reading I ever tackled. I soon saw the modern
ones were no good, so I turned to the ancient ones. I tried the
different methods of expelling devils, but I might as well have
tried castor oil. I saw plenty of charms for warts, and how to
make love potions; but it was useless trying those. I began to
think that I was going to be licked this time, and Jerry began to
get down-hearted, for scarcely a soul came near us only out of
curiosity, and to ask what the market value of spiders was, and
whether there was a boom in them. I began to think we would have
to find some mug to sell it to, and all Jerry's visions of a neat
racing stable and a horse or two for country meetings began to
disappear.</p>

<p>I'd been reading one day about witches in an old book amongst
them&mdash;a tattered old one you bought second-hand&mdash;and I
didn't take much stock of it. Turning over a page, I went on, and
began to get interested. Jerry had gone to bed, and the spiders
had all vanished, as usual, and, of course, there were no
customers.</p>

<p>I found out that witches put on all kinds of appearances,
daytime as well as night; but it said nothing about their turning
themselves into spiders&mdash;only cats and hares. The only thing
I had found about spiders was in the matter of charms, in which
they were very useful. Suddenly I came on these words in faint
black letters:</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">ARUZEEANNACOMZABAL<br>
ZABAL. ZABAL. ZABAL!</p>

<br>

<p>A very potent charm against Finland and Lapland witches,
making them show themselves in their true shapes, and
straightaway vanish, sometimes with loud cries.</p>

<p>Somehow that word fascinated me. There was a taking sort of
sound, that was fetching about it. I tried it over several times
until I had got the hang of it, and read the directions. It was
to be said slowly, in a distinct and commanding voice,
particularly the last three repetitions. It also pleased me to
find that there was no danger connected with using it. I got
quite excited, and went and woke Jerry up, to try how at felt on
him; but the only thing he said was, 'Jim, you've been, at the
whisky.'</p>

<p>I explained matters, and went to bed with my precious book
under my pillow. In the morning we were up nearly; in fact, you
had to be, because the spiders took to running over you.</p>

<p>I had gone out in the paddock and made myself perfect, and
then we went in the bar, and I started. 'At the first syllable
there was a commotion amongst the spiders. When I got to the end
of the long word every tarantula bad gathered round and was
gazing at me with fiery eyes of hate. It was an awful feeling to
foe so surrounded by these repulsive things, knowing they were
not natural. I stuck to it, though, and at the second Zabal they
commenced to swell in size.</p>

<p>'Oh Lord! Jim, you've done it now!' cried Jerry, and ducked
behind the bar.</p>

<p>'Zabal!' I cried the third time, in as commanding a voice as I
knew how; and instantly they changed into native cats&mdash;wild
cats. O, the row! Spitting, screaming, growling, they rushed out
of the door, across the verandah, and vanished in the bush. The
string looked half a mile long.</p>

<p>The house was cleaned, and Jerry and I sat down and finished a
bottle of whisky. The next smarty that came along and inquired
about spiders, we called him in, told him to see that there
wasn't one in the place; then we gave him a drink and told him to
tell the people in town.</p>

<p>Lord, what a rush we had! We were drunk out. But we would not
tell how we did it; but an old nigger who had seen the mob of
cats bolting, and nearly turned white with fear, gave us away.
But they never heard the whole truth.</p>

<p>Jerry wrote to his wife and children, and made some
improvements at once, and I left him up there to it, and I think
we'll both make a good thing of it.</p>

<p>Now, can you tell me what those Finland and Lapland witches
wanted there? how they came there? when they came there? why they
came there? and where they've gone to?</p>

<p><br>
I WROTE back:</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Jim,</span>&mdash;

<p class="letter">I can only answer your last question. They've
probably gone where you will go when you die if you dabble with
any more magic, or have any more dreams, or see any more sights
from drinking whisky at bush pubs.</p>

<h2><a id="ch27"></a>27. &mdash; THE STORY OF A ROCK HOLE</h2>

<h3><i>Australian Town and Country Journal</i>, 21 Dec 1895</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THE granite mounds of West Australia are a distinctive feature
of that colony. Nothing like them are to be found in the east.
Aloft, from an apparently limitless expense of black scrub of
stunted, crooked trees, with a red and barren soil underneath,
rises a cone of bare granite to the height of about one hundred
feet. At the bases of these naked mounds are often deep holes in
the solid rock, almost like artificial tanks blasted out by the
hands of man. The mounds are not always conical; sometimes they
are round-backed. Always the sides are bare and steep, and down
them rushes the rainfall to fill the rock holes, or, if none are
there, the catchment forms a surface spring or soak. The origin
of these holes must be attributed to a submergence of ancient
times, as in many respects they resemble the holes found in the
rocks of the sea shore, only on a much larger scale.</p>

<p>One good purpose they undoubtedly fulfil is the economy of
nature. The rain water remains fresh and drinkable to the end, if
it is not polluted by the carelessness of man; whereas if it is
caught in a depression of one of the rare creeks of that region
the saline nature of the soil soon renders it undrinkable. Round
the bases of these rock mounds there is often a small space of
open country, fairly well grassed; and these naturally form
excellent camping grounds. Others rise abruptly from the
scrub.</p>

<p>A couple of men had just halted at one of these rocks, and,
leaving their riding and pack horses to nibble the short grass,
went a little distance up the incline of the rock to see if there
was water In any of the holes.</p>

<p>"Here's a good deep one, Jim!" called one to the other. His
mate came over to him. "Looks pretty black and scummy," he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes. Looks as if it had got a dead nigger or two in it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps there's another one about?"</p>

<p>A short search revealed a shallower hole, wherein the water
was clear-and inviting in appearance. They paused at the first
hole as they returned to their horses; Howson said:</p>

<p>"I should have to be perishing before I'd take a drink of that
water."</p>

<p>"Or I either," returned Jim; and they both strolled back to
bring up their horses, and then, after watering them, commenced
the work of unsaddling, hobbling, etc.</p>

<p>Silence was unbroken for hours, when both men wore roused by
what sounded like a cry of mortal agony, that seemed to ring in
their ears long after they were sitting up listening.</p>

<p>"What was it, not a night bird?" said Howson. "No bird ever
yelled like that," replied Jim. "Keep quiet and listen."</p>

<p><br>
FOR five minutes nothing was heard save one of the horses
shaking his bell. When, as if this familiar sound had roused
it, the cry was repeated, accompanied by a distinct splashing,
and a last exclamation that seemed suddenly cut short.</p>

<p>"By God, it's somebody in that hole there!" exclaimed Howson,
as they simultaneously started to their feet.</p>

<p>"How can anybody be there?" asked Jim, turning to accompany
his mate, for in that part of the world men cannot afford the
luxury of nerves, and neither man hesitated a moment to start in
the direction of the sound. They reached the gloomy hole, but the
dark waters reflected the stars directly overhead without a
ripple on its surface.</p>

<p>"Impossible that that splashing we heard could have subsided
in this time," said Howson.</p>

<p>"Couldn't have been anyone in here after all. It wasn't fancy
at any rate." Jim drew his revolver, which he had hastily belted
on when leaving camp, and fired a shot in the air. There was no
response. He fired again, unavailingly.</p>

<p>"No good fooling round in the dark," said Howson after they
had waited. "Let's go back and make the fire up. There's no
niggers about."</p>

<p>They turned, when between them, seemingly, passed a waft of
icy cold air, and they thought they heard a sigh. The night was
calm and sultry.</p>

<p>"Did you feel that?" asked Jim.</p>

<p>"I did. Can't understand it." And they returned to camp and
made up the fire.</p>

<p><br>
IN the morning they examined the waterhole, even sounded it
with a sapling; but it afforded no explanation of the mystery.
Howson returned to camp to put the quarts on; Jim went round the
mound after the horses, who had fed round there during the
night.</p>

<p>"There's an old camp there," he said when he returned.</p>

<p>"How old?" asked Howson.</p>

<p>"Quite two years."</p>

<p>"Any more holes on that side?"</p>

<p>"No. Seems funny that, whoever it was, did not camp here close
to the water."</p>

<p>"Yes; can't make it out. Hope we shall have a more cheerful
camp to-morrow night," Howson said, as they rose from their
breakfast.</p>

<p>They packed up and mounted. Jim rode ahead to pick a good road
through the scrub, the packhorses trailed after him, Howson
followed, and the granite mound stood up once more solitary and
lifeless.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
ON top of the rock was a depression, not sufficiently deep to
hold water long, but deep enough to conceal a man sitting or
lying down. Out of this now uprose a man, who, after making sure
that the late visitors had, actually departed for good, picked up
a billy and descended to the hole whereat the two men had watered
their horses. Filling it, he went on to the lately deserted camp
and made up the smouldering fire. He put tho billy on the fire,
and then ascended the rock again. Here, in his lair, were some
ration bags and an old blanket. With the bags, he descended
again, carrying also some damper and mutton. Sitting down at the
fire, he made a ravenous meal, and, that finished, he commenced
to smoke, muttering and talking to himself as a solitary man
does. He was a gaunt, half-starved figure, and his clothes were
ragged, and his boots but mere apologies. His hair, however, was
not long, and his beard was a grizzly stubble.</p>

<p>"I was a fool not to show myself. They were only prospectors,
and might have helped me. But I have no nerves; and those police
get themselves up in all manner of rigs in the bush," he
soliloquised. Then he smoked on in silence for a time. "Well, I
must make a start again. I've rested well, and Lave enough
rations left. Ha!"</p>

<p>Absorbed in his meditations, he had not heard the silent
approach of a horseman from behind. Howson was sitting on his
horse quietly regarding him.</p>

<p>"So you were playing ghost last night, I suppose. Why didn't
you come to our camp? There's something wrong here."</p>

<p>The ex-ghost looked at him. Howson had a kindly face.</p>

<p>"I will tell you. I don't think you look the man to go back on
a poor devil. You may have heard some time ago of a prisoner
escaping from Fremantle Gaol?" Howson shook his head. "Well, I'm
the man; and I've led the life of a hunted dog ever since."</p>

<p>"How did you get right up here?"</p>

<p>"You see, I was known pretty well on the Murchison Field
itself and on Cue, as I know something of the lay of the country.
I thought, that I could work round by degrees and make my way to
the big crowds on the rushes north of Coolgardie, and so right
down."</p>

<p>"How did you get the rations and clothes?"</p>

<p>The man hesitated. "You're a good sort," he said, coming up
fawningly beside Howson's horse; "and I'll tell you open. I stole
them from a fencer's camp on Magardoo Run, twenty miles from
here. A man must do these things when he's in my plight."</p>

<p>"What did you want to play that foolery for last night?"</p>

<p>"I was frightened you might spell here all day, and also that
you might be police. I was planted on top of the rock."</p>

<p>"How did you manage that sigh and cold air business?"</p>

<p>"I sighed, but the cold air must have been fancy. I splashed
in the other Hole, not in the deep one."</p>

<p>"Stop that!" cried Howson suddenly. "What the devil are you
fumbling with my revolver pouch for?"</p>

<p>"Accident, nervousness. I'm that nervous that, I assure you, I
can't keep my hands still."</p>

<p>Howson regarded him sternly. "You're an awful liar," he said.
"But it's lucky for you I came back for my knife. I can't hound
down such a miserable wretch as you, and if you wait here I'll
fetch my mate back and we'll camp here to-day and see what we can
do for you. Hand me up that knife, and no tricks."</p>

<p>He pointed to a sheath-knife lying on the ground, which had
escaped the vagrant's eye. The man took it up submissively and
handed it to Howson, holding it by the blade. Howson turned and
rode back on his tracks, and the escaped prisoner was left
alone.</p>

<p><br>
THE two prospectors were soon back, Jim having waited for his
friend's return with the missing knife. They were speedily
unpacked and camped in the old camp. But the convict noticed that
a sharp eye was kept on him by one or other of the men at all
times. Evidently that attempt on the revolver had been a false
move. Howson and Jim undid their swags and selected such clothes
as they could spare and an old pair of boots, still in good
order, this last being the most precious gift of all for a man
out there to dispose of.</p>

<p>"Now," said Howson, "we can't spare you a horse, but we'll rig
you up, give you a few good feeds to-day, and some more rations
and a water-bag. With this you can easily reach Wandimp Station,
fifteen miles south of here. Jim's got a razor he'll lend you,
and if you shave your cheeks and chin you'll look a good deal
better, and can go up boldly to the station, instead of
stealing."</p>

<p>The outcast professed the greatest gratitude, and taking the
tin dish they lent him and other things, went off to the
waterhole to effect the transformation which was to restore him
to an equal level with, his fellows; that is to say,
outwardly.</p>

<p>He returned in half an hour's time greatly improved; so much
so that he now looked rather the swell of the party.</p>

<p>"Let's go and have a look at your camp up there," said
Jim.</p>

<p>The other made no objection, and they ascended the rock. In
the hollow was little left but some stale damper and salt mutton
and the old blanket. The convict-looked at these things now with
great disgust, although but a short time before they had been
very precious to him.</p>

<p>"You had better collect all these rags," remarked Howson.
"They might be found some day and afford a clue."</p>

<p>The convict obeyed, and tying them into a rude bundle in the
old blanket, he and Howson commenced the descent. Jim stayed
behind having a look round.</p>

<p>"What shall I do with these things?" asked the convict.</p>

<p>"Tie a stone to them and sink them in tho ghost's waterhole,"
returned Howson, in jest.</p>

<p>The convict turned a ghastly white. "Don't say that," he
said.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Howson, in surprise.</p>

<p>At this moment Jim overtook them. In his hand he held a
tattered sheet of newspaper.</p>

<p>"Were there not two of you who escaped?" he suddenly
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," returned the other. "I see you picked up
that piece of newspaper with an account of it."</p>

<p>"How long have you camped on this rock?"</p>

<p>"Just a week."</p>

<p>"Liar! You have been here longer; three weeks. Look where
somebody has marked here with a pencil, 'Came to top of
rock,&mdash;&mdash;13, '95.'"</p>

<p>The convict looked helplessly around, and muttered something
about, "He must have written that," in tremulous tones.</p>

<p>"Where is your fellow-prisoner?" demanded Howson.</p>

<p>"We parted some time ago."</p>

<p>"Then how did he come to the top of the rock and write on this
paper?"</p>

<p>"The rations were short, and we quarrelled."</p>

<p>"You murdered him, you mean."</p>

<p>"And the body is in that hole!" exclaimed Howson, with a flash
of conviction.</p>

<p>"No, no," cried the wretch. "Did you not try yourselves? I saw
you myself. There is nothing there! nothing!"</p>

<p>"There's the body of a man, and you have covered it with
stones. That's why we felt nothing."</p>

<p>"We'll make you clean it out," said Jim.</p>

<p>But the horror of this proposal was too much for the wretched
man. With a quick bound he was away and racing for the scrub. He
reached it, in spite of one or two revolver shots fired after
him, and the two men could neither overtake nor track him. A
body, found some months after, was supposed to be his.</p>

<p>The rock hole still keeps its secret. The two prospectors
simply scratched indelibly on the rock:</p>
<br>

<p class="sign">DRINK NOTHING HERE.<br>
SOMETHING DEAD IN THE HOLE.</p>
<br>

<p>This was the epitaph of the other man. Jim said; "It would be
too sweet a contract to start cleaning it out."</p>

<h2><a id="ch28"></a>28. &mdash; DARKIE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 14 Aug 1897</h3>

<p class="cp"><i>Contains a couple of obsolete slang terms:<br>
"spieler" = con-man; "dead marines" = empty beer bottles.</i></p>
<br>

<p class="first">
THE races were on at Bungleton, and the town, was full of
undesirable and desirable strangers.</p>

<p>The desirable ones came to spend money, the undesirable ones
came to try to make some, and, as they were not particular in
their methods, they were not enthusiastically welcomed by the
residents. Amongst them was Mr. Conway Delawbon, who by his name
should have been included amongst the desirable ones, but of whom
the landlord of the inn he patronised felt doubtful.</p>

<p>In the first place if Mr. Conway Delawbon was the swell he
represented himself to be, why did he not stay at the swell
hotel, and if he was a spieler why did he not stop amongst that
fraternity? His own house was only frequented by bushies, amongst
whom a detected spieler would have stood little chance, and they
consequently gave it a wide berth. Mr. Delawbon, however, did not
attempt any little tricks, but made himself rather popular with
the stockmen, boundary riders, and drovers who patronised the
Golden Harp. The second day of the races saw everybody out on the
course, and the township was a town of dead marines. The sport,
was exciting, and when the' ladies' race was won by the barmaid
of the Golden Harp, the public-house mentioned above, the joy of
the patrons of that hostelry was loud and deep.</p>

<p>Mr. Delawbon, who had made himself very agreeable to pretty
Maggie, was as excited as anybody, and shouted as
enthusiastically as anybody. Then he slipped quietly and quickly
away, and cut across the bush to the township. Another man was
before him, and they met in the yard of the hotel.</p>

<p>'It's our horse right enough,' said Conway; 'but when the
devil he got up here I can't make put.'</p>

<p>'Who owns him, or claims to own him now?'</p>

<p>'Deeling, who has the station just across the river. I've
sounded all the fellows at the hotel, but they know nothing
beyond the fact that Deeling has him in charge for some young
fellow or other.'</p>

<p>'And they only entered him for that ladies' race; they are
either a lot of chumps or they know all about him.'</p>

<p>'Looks like it, but there must be some amongst them who know
all about him. That girl could scarcely hold him. If she hadn't
been a first-class rider, they would have noticed how she pulled
him.'</p>

<p>'Bet you two to one she knows. She's our mark. You'll to have
to make the running there.'</p>

<p>'I'll try, but Miss Maggie knows a thing or two, and just now
she can pick and choose.'</p>

<p>'Here are the jolterheads coming back again; well we must
settle something. Pity we can't bluff Deeling with a
warrant.'</p>

<p>'No chance; what have we got to show in the matter? It's all
that confounded brother of mine. I should like to get hold of him
for five minutes, the young wretch to go back on us like
that.'</p>

<p>'Well, we have not come this far to go back empty-handed, if
we have to steal him again.'</p>

<p><br>
THE two men parted without more words, and Delawbon, as he
called himself, went back to the house. That evening when Maggie
was off for an hour or two she slipped out and went to the small
hospital standing on the outskirts of the town. She went up to
the ward wherein were but two inmates, an old man and a young
one. The youngster had evidently broken his leg by the way the
bedclothes were arranged over it on a cradle. Maggie went up and
greeted him.</p>

<p>'Did you win?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Of course, but he nearly bolted with me.'</p>

<p>'It was risky of Deeling to run him, but I couldn't tell him
the real reason I didn't want him run.'</p>

<p>'It's my fault, said the girl; 'I persuaded him. I wanted to
win the race. But I think there's someone after the house.
There's a fellow stopping at our place whom we can't make out at
all. He calls himself Delawbon, but that's not his same. He's not
a 'tec, and I can't put a name to him.'</p>

<p>'What makes you think he's after the horse?'</p>

<p>'The way he looked at him when I came in, and he took the
opportunity of coming up and speaking to me when I was going to
start, and I'm certain he knew the horse.'</p>

<p>'Good heaven! It's not my brother?'</p>

<p>'Is your brother like you?'</p>

<p>'No, not a bit. He'd kill me if he found me.'</p>

<p>'Well, Jimmy, there's only one thing to do. I must find out
all about this man, and if he is your brother, after you and the
horse, I must clear out and meet you somewhere else.'</p>

<p>'But you'd be followed and known anywhere.'</p>

<p>'Not I. It won't be the first time I've ridden in boy's
clothes, and, as for Darkie, I'd take him us a pack-horse,
looking like a regular old moke.'</p>

<p>'Confound this broken, leg. If it wasn't for that I'd have
been out of this long ago.'</p>

<p>'Well, good-bye. I must be back at once,' said Maggie, as she
departed.</p>

<p><br>
SIX months before the young fellow had come there, looking for
work, and obtained it on Deeling's station. A month afterwards,
hearing that the Golden Harp wanted a barmaid, he had told the
landlord that his sister wanted a billet, had written to her, and
she had come up and taken the place. The young fellow, who called
himself O'Reilly, had two horses with him when he arrived, one of
them the horse that had that had won the little race. While laid
up with his broken leg, his ostensible sister had persuaded
Deeling to lend her Darkie for the race, and, seeing that ha
thought it was her brother's home, be did not like to refuse.</p>

<p>That evening Maggie was in the bar, when she overheard a
conversation between, the man she suspected and one of the men
working on Deeling's station. They were talking of the horse.</p>

<p>'So, he belongs to this young O'Reilly. Where is he?'</p>

<p>'In the hospital, with a broken leg.'</p>

<p>'What's he like; perhaps I know him?'</p>

<p>The man described him tolerably well, and Maggie saw the scowl
on the other's face, which he could not repress. It was the
brother evidently, and Jimmy had often told her of his dread of
this brother ever finding him. She knew some of the rights of the
case, but not all; she knew, however, that the horse in question
was a valuable stolen racer, but that was enough. Maggie's
morality was nowhere, but her loyalty was great, she must act at
once, to-morrow would be too late. She knew the matron at the
hospital, and could manage to get to see her alleged brother that
night, and get him to give her an order to Deeling to take his
horses and clothes. For the rest, she could manage herself.</p>

<p><br>
WHEN Maggie did not turn up the next morning there was
consternation, and, when it was found that she' had gone, the
usual expression of opinion was, whom has she gone with? She had
gone over to, Deeling's late at night, had obtained her brother's
horses and things, and vanished. Opinion veered to the conclusion
that Maggie had played very low down on her brother, and cleared
off with somebody, and his horses, while he was down on his
back. But, although the girl would not have felt at all shocked
at these aspersions on her character, they were not true, and she
had carried out the programme she had hastily sketched out
alone.</p>

<p>The effect on Delawbon was crushing, and he could do nothing,
except by moving in the matter he would probably set five years'
penal servitude. He could not follow Maggie, for, born and bred
in the bush, she had kept off the road. She knew as well as any
man how to strap down a wire fence and get a horse over it, and
she left no sign as to which way she had departed. His only
course was to keep an eye on his brother, who, as he guessed, had
a place appointed to meet Maggie. He could not, unfortunately, as
he thought, go into the hospital and half kill him.</p>

<p>Two years before a valuable racing colt had been stolen from a
station in New South Wales, and its body was found afterwards
with the brands cut out of the hide, and otherwise disfigured.
That is to say, some people swore it was the colt, some swore it
was not. It was not, the colt being then in the possession of the
three men who had stolen the horse. Then the younger brother
stole it from his brother and mate, and they had vainly looked
for him since, until, at the race meeting at Bungleton, they had
come on the horse, only to lose it again.</p>

<p><br>
IT was some two months afterwards, and Maggie, who had managed
her escape with the cleverness of an old hand, had taken service
at a rather thriving roadside pub and the horses were safely in
a neighboring paddock, when she received a letter from Jim,
informing her that he would join her the next week. On the day
appointed two men arrived, and rode up to the house, and Maggie's
heart leaped as she recognised in one the brother whom Jim so
dreaded, riding amicably with him. She felt somehow that her
recreant lover had betrayed her to save his own skin.</p>

<p>And so it had proved. Jim had thrown all the blame on her,
and, under threats, had confessed the place where she was in
hiding with the horses. Maggie took it quietly enough, the horses
were run up from the paddock, and put in the yard. She did not
utter a word of reproach to the young cur for whom she had worked
so loyally, but simply said:</p>

<p>'I want to go down by myself and say good-bye to Darkie. I
have got very fond of him since we have been so long
together.'</p>

<p>She went into the bar, and took something out of the drawer,
then went out to the yard. The two men did not follow her, but
sat down to the meal they had ordered. They were in the middle of
it, when they were startled by a shot outside. Hastening out to
see what was the matter, they met Maggie walking back to the
house, a revolver in her hand. In the yard lay poor Darkie, the
capital of the two thieves, now worth nothing. Maggie had shot
him fair and square through the brain.</p>

<p>'You daren't do anything,' she said, coolly, 'or you will get
into quod. Besides, so far as I know, he was my horse. I have
kept that order you gave me for Deeling; I gave him a receipt for
it.'</p>

<p>Maggie is now the mistress of the thriving roadside pub, the
owner, a widower, having lately married her.</p>

<h2><a id="ch29"></a>29. &mdash; A FUSION OF INTELLECTS</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney,  1 and 8 Oct 1898</h3>

<p class="first">
HE was about the shabbiest kind of dead- and stone-broke
traveller one could have dropped across, and somehow he did not
at all seem to suit, or fit in, to the surroundings.</p>

<p>One naturally expects that when a swagman loafs up to your
camp at night he will begin to discourse on the usual subjects,
namely, the iniquity and meanness of the neighboring squatters,
the state of the roads, and the prevailing dullness of
everything.</p>

<p>This man did nothing of the sort. He asked for a feed, and
having got it he commenced to scorch his brains by the fire,
endeavoring, as far as I could make out, to figure up abstruse
calculations on the pages of a dirty notebook by means of a stump
of a pencil. The thing got worrying at last, and I felt
constrained to ask him what the devil he was doing. He knocked
off his occupation, and looked into the fire with a grim sort of
smile.</p>

<p>'Making my fortune,' he said.</p>

<p>'Backing the favorite, and reckoning up the odds?' I
asked.</p>

<p>'No. Mathematically speaking, racing cannot be reduced to a
science. The element of uncertainty is too prominent. I might say
the universal element of uncertainty, namely, human life and
intelligence, and also animal life. How can you provide against
any man making a mistake of judgment? How can you provide a
jockey without nerves or a liver? How can you provide a horse
without unreliable muscles, or sinews guaranteed against breaking
down? No, figures can't lie, but you must not bring the accidents
of nature into the calculation.'</p>

<p>I sat up and looked at the man. He was regarding the fire in a
pensive, smiling sort of manner, and continued rambling on.</p>

<p>'No. The uncertainty of natural things&mdash;I mean things
according to the ordinary course of nature&mdash;is one of the
most upsetting questions in the world. Take figures, say 2 and 2
make 4. No one can upset that; but say that you will not break
your neck to-morrow, or will break your neck, and who is to
answer if?'</p>

<p>'Hang it, man,' I said, 'are you an insurance agent?'</p>

<p>'No, I'm a fusion.'</p>

<p>'What on earth do you mean?'</p>

<p>'Just what I say. I'm a fusion of intellects. I am two men in
one.'</p>

<p>'You don't seem to have much sense between you.'</p>

<p>'That is your ignorant notion. Now I combine two intellects,
the practical and the romantic. But it's a mistake altogether.
They don't combine properly. Now I am going to make my fortune I
know, and have proved it properly on paper; but I have never yet
succeeded in pulling it off, although the thing is as correct, as
figures can make it. Now this prospective fortune is based on the
uncertain element of you lending me ten bob.'</p>

<p>'Very uncertain,' I interrupted.</p>

<p>'Just so. But supposing I show you how easily I figure the
thing out. You lend me ten shillings, I go into Blatherville
to-morrow, and expend it in the purchase of popular journals. I
retail them through the stations at about 200 per cent, and
continue to retail them until my profits admit of my purchasing a
horse and cart. When I have purchased this, I make far more than
I did before, you must admit. I amass capital, and see several
other avenues of investment. My capacity for figures leads me
into the safest ones, where there is no risk and great profit.
You follow me, I hope? A matter of a few years makes me a
millionaire. Then the outlook is unlimited.'</p>

<p>'How is it you are so hard up now?'</p>

<p>'That is due to the element of uncertainty introduced by
nature. If nature would confine herself to faithfully making 2
and 2 into 4 all would be well. But she doesn't. She introduces
ail manner of risks, and I have been the victim of them.'</p>

<p>'Evidently,' was my natural rejoinder. 'Well, do you feel
inclined to help me to make a fresh start. Say, ten shillings;
and I will hand you over the full and more than remarkable
details of my life. I wrote them out in case of any accident
happening to me. Fate is so unkind. I will let you have them as
security for the ten shillings.'</p>

<p>He undid his swag, and took out a number of sheets of
closely-written paper. They did not appear very valuable, but as
I happened to have what is popularly known as 'a cheque' in my
pocket I finally agreed to advance the necessary capital to make
him a millionaire. In return I received the papers, which
contained the account of a marvellous fusion of characters, which
seemed to have been borne out by the experience of one of the
experiments.</p>

<p>Of the man who sold me the history of this wonderful, but
rather disappointing, venture I know nothing, beyond the fact
that he camped with me that night, and that afterwards I saw a
paragraph in a country newspaper referring to the finding of the
body of a man whose description somewhat answered the appearance
of the hero of the following statement:</p>

<h3>ROGER MOULTON'S STORY</h3>

<p class="first">
BANKER and I had always been friends, although quite
dissimilar in character and pursuits. He was intensely
methodical, and I was equally imaginative. Still Banker and I
remained fast friends for many years, until the decree of fate,
and the outcome of our joint experiment separated us for ever. I
have said that Banker was practical to a high degree, but he was
more so. He had reduced all things to a level of mathematical
accuracy that was simply astounding. He could prove anything when
put to it. On the other hand, I, as an imaginative man, did not
care for proof of any sort. It was sufficient for a thing to be
beautiful and probable; then it at once became possible, as far
as I was concerned, and I accepted it as a fact.</p>

<p>For instance, Banker would give me statistics to show how many
criminals there were in different countries, and that, therefore,
the decrease or cessation of crime was an impossibility. Whereas
I had rapturous thoughts of a millennium, when all evil should
be overcome by the influence of good, and crime, and wickedness
cease in the world. When I thought of such a consummation, it
seemed to me almost a fact that would brook no denial. But when
Barker brought his irresistible array of figures to bear on the
matter, I was at once convinced that the world was steeped in
wickedness too deeply for any hope of salvation.</p>

<p>In the course of many conversations it had become a common
subject of comment between us, as to the desirability of welding
my romantic and emotionally trustful nature with his prosaic and
hard matter-of-fact common sense. The subject became fascinating
in the extreme, and as we were both men of comparatively easy,
fortunes, we had ample leisure to discuss it. Finally we became
acquainted with a scientist much versed in abstruse questions,
who became imbued with the idea, and devoted himself to
experiments with regard to its realisation. I will not mention
his name, the number of murders he was guilty of in the cause of
science would alone condemn him to death and universal
execration, but he succeeded. He finally decided that a transfer
of nature was possible, but that It would involve entire loss of
mind to one of the two parties. That is to say, that it would
enrich one man at the expense of the other becoming a hopeless
maniac.</p>

<p>The idea had got such a firm hold of both Banker and myself
that even this thought did not deter us, and we agreed to draw
lots in the matter. One to lose his senses, and the winner to
imbibe two men's. We drew lots; the experiment was a grand
success, speaking from a psychological point of view, and Banker
is at present the inhabitant of an asylum for incurable
imbeciles; while I am the proud possessor of two men's
intellects.</p>

<p>To pass over the details of the experiment, it may suffice
that we both came out of it uninjured in our bodily health, and
actually the same in person as we were before. Only that in
abolition to the highly strung imagination already possessed I
became proprietor of Banker's practical and mathematical mind.
And Banker had no mind left. Perhaps he was to be envied.</p>

<p>How did I feel with this sudden accession of another man's
character?</p>

<p>Rather bothered, I must confess. My dreams, which formerly
were but dreams, suddenly, developed into possible facts. I had
only to sit down and work it out in figures, and I find it
possible to do anything. Figures cannot lie, I kept assuring
myself; my newly-acquired power of manipulating figures made me
capable of proving my wildest dreams possible and
practicable.</p>

<p>I admit that I did not feel sufficient compassion for the fate
which my sudden accession of double power entailed upon Banker.
But really, the sudden and unexpected chain of circumstances that
all at once befell me, must excuse this. I may state that, under
a the deed of gift, the winner became entitled to the loser's
fortune, barring the payment of his keep in a lunatic asylum.
This, I at once provided for. Fortunately, as it happened. Then I
was free to conquer the world, and I proceeded to do so.</p>

<p><br>
MY thoughts were rather crowded by the number of channels that
seemed open to me and which at once suggested themselves to the
imaginative side or my character. They all seemed so easy of
accomplishment, so long as the romantic side dominated my
practical one, that I proceeded to regard them one by one.</p>

<p>Stockbroking opened up limitless visions; but when I came to
regard it from the other view my mental faculties took of it I
saw that It was all open to the same fatal objection, namely, the
uncertain element of chance that Nature allowed to creep into
human affairs. I could see the most magnificent vistas of
gorgeous avenues to wealth open before me; but, unfortunately,
human weakness was the doubtful point, in all of them. The
elements of success in such roads to wealth and fortune as share
speculations, horse-racing, or gambling, were all mixed up with
chance, and my practical nature would not permit of my engaging
in them. This element of chance I found entered into so many of
the paths of human commerce that my practical nature arose in
alarm at all of them. Turn where I would I could not see one safe
avenue open to me. It was very pleasant to dream of these things,
and my success in them, until my vivid imagination led me to
believe that the thing was accomplished.</p>

<p>Then suddenly my practical side awoke, and I started to find
that I had done nothing. This went on for nearly a year, Until I
found that I really must do something, or else I had consented to
an experiment which reduced my friend to a mindless imbecile, and
wherein I gained greatly, and, now, was doing nothing for it. I
was practically worse than a murderer. At this my sensitive
nature revolted greatly; but my callous and blunter business
side saw nothing very heinous in it.</p>

<p>And now commenced an inward strife that almost tore me
asunder. My two natures struggled for mastery, and neither would
give in to the other. The consequence was disastrous, for at
certain periods I was domineered by my imaginative side, and for
another period by my practical side. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde were
not in it with me, for my disposition changed without my physical
appearance changing. My romantic and sanguine temperament made
me, one day, take to speculations, which sometimes would have
succeeded, but that the cautious and mathematical turn of my mind
made me sell out the next day at a loss.</p>

<p>Just the same was the reverse side. Safe investments that my
business self had put money into were recklessly sacrificed by my
romantic self as being unworthy of consideration. Between the two
I was rapidly being reduced to beggary. Just at this time I fell
in love&mdash;that is, my romantic nature fell in love; my
business mature did not approve of it. Consequently, when I met
my lady love in my business mood she found me irritably different
to what I was in my passionate moods, and scant wonder that she
felt aggrieved.</p>

<p>However, the absorption of my romantic side in love affairs,
and the healing of the wounds my other side had made, occupied
that particular side so much that it had no time to look after
business matters, and of that my practical mind took advantage,
and worked so well that I recouped the money I had lost. Then my
practical side took advantage of the situation. It seemed to say
to me: See what I can do. Go into a good retail trade, I will
work it. Let your romantic mind do all the domestic bliss, and
that sort of thing, I'll run the business. I should suggest a
drapery establishment. Grand profits in a drapery
establishment.</p>

<p>Now, when I was under the influence of my practical mentor,
he, of course, had his own way, consequently I invested part of
my capital in a drapery business, and Roger Moulton figured over
the resplendent plate glass windows. My disgusted romantic side
refused to say anything of this to my fiance, who was nothing if
not poetical, and consequently we were married without her
knowing anything about it. But my romantic nature had also taken
advantage of the situation by compelling me to make large
settlements upon her&mdash;that is, large compared to my fortune.
When we came back from the honeymoon my business side, in the joy
of its heart, took my bride round to see the drapery
establishment, and there was a scene, I can assure you.</p>

<p>Well, she made the best of it, and managed to reconcile
herself to business by running up an enormous private account,
and when my business side protested we quarrelled, and she
finally eloped with the shopwalker. Then my romantic side sold
off the business in disgust, much against the advice of my other
mind, and I took a passage out here.</p>

<p>I was considerably straitened in circumstances again, and I
landed here with very little capital, and my two minds were now
so antagonistic that I believe they hated one another land took
pleasure in spiting one another whenever the chance came. I was
always up and flown like a shuttlecock, and finally was reduced
to my present condition of a penniless wanderer. But now the most
fatal thing occurred. The fusion of the two intellects had not
evidently been successful, they had never properly amalgamated,
as they were meant to. Hence there was constant friction.</p>

<p>Now they began to assimilate. My romantic side began to lose
its sensitiveness and high sense of honor, and my business side
consequently lost its scrupulous sense of business, and began, in
plain words, to cheat when it saw a chance, a safe chance. But my
deteriorated romantic side did not wait for a safe opportunity,
and consequently I often found the seclusion that a prison
grants.</p>

<p>This is the bad experience of our fusion of intellects. It's
no good. They may fuse in time, but by that time you will find
yourself utterly ruined in soul and body, like I am.</p>

<h2><a id="ch30"></a>30. &mdash; DIARY OF A SYDNEY OFFICE BOY</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney,  23 Jul 1898</h3>

<p class="first">
July 1.&mdash; Got a billet at last. About time. Jess Perkins
told me last night she'd chuck me, said she didn't like a boy
without coppers.</p>

<p class="first">
July 2.&mdash; Don't think I like this fellow; he's too mighty
particular. Sent me out with a letter yesterday, and told me to
bring an answer sharp. Well, I stopped to see a horse get on his
legs that had tumbled down. I had a look at a man posting bills,
new ones, about the Theatre Royal. I just watched him to see that
he got the big letters straight, then I went on and delivered the
letter. Had a yarn with a boy in the building that I
knew&mdash;why shouldn't a fellow speak to old friends?&mdash;and
the man I brought the letter to roars out to me to come and take
the answer; said it had been ready ten minutes. I only stopped
once going back, to watch some men laying gas pipes, and blowed
it the boss didn't ask me where the devil I'd been loitering.
Seems to me that there's not much of a free country about this
place after all. Why can't a boy indulge his natural
curiosity?</p>

<p class="first">
July 3.&mdash; Went to the post office to get the letters. Two
cops were taking a man to the lockup. Followed 'em round to see
the fun. To save time, got on the tail of a trolley for a ride.
After a bit, found it was going in the wrong direction, so got
down again, and saw a man selling eighteen oranges for sixpence.
Had a yarn with him, but he wouldn't give me an orange. Went back
to the post office, and couldn't find the key of the box.
Remembered that I'd forgot to bring it; so I went back for it.
Found the boss in a tearing rage. He'd sent someone else and got
his letters, so I don't see why he wanted to swear so. His
language is very bad. I don't think he'll suit me long.</p>

<p class="first">
July 4.&mdash; Going up to Macquarie-street to deliver a letter
I met Scrammy Joe on a bike. He's a telegraph boy. We took the
bike into Phillip-street, where it was quiet, and he gave me a
few lessons. I fell off and barked my nose. Went on to
Macquarie-street, and couldn't find the letter; must have fallen
out of my pocket when I got the spill. Went back to look for it,
but it wasn't there. Volunteers with a band came by; marches with
'em for a bit. Told the boss I'd delivered the letter when I got
back. He used bad language again, said that I'd been away long
enough to deliver the whole English mail. If he makes such a fuss
about a trifle what would, he say if he knew that I'd lost the
letter? He was so cross all the afternoon that I chummed up with
the lift boy and rode up and down for an hour. Old gentleman
called in the evening; nice-looking old bloke. Should like to get
a decent boss like him. Heard him ask my man why he had not sent
something up early in the morning as he promised. My cove said he
had sent his boy with it; that was me. Old gentleman said strange
man delivered it in the afternoon, who'd picked it up in
Phillip-street, and wanted a shilling for his trouble, and got
it. Lord, how my cove did perform. I'd be ashamed of myself to
use such language to a boy before a respectable white-haired old
gent. But the old gent should have taken my part. He got his
letter in the end, and a shilling was nothing to him. The more I
see of the world the more I despise it. There's no gratitude in
it. Scrammy Joe met me in the evening, and gave me licking,
'cause he said I broke something in his blooming bike, and he'd
been charged with it. I wouldn't act like that, but Scrammy never
was much account.</p>

<p class="first">
July 5.&mdash; Boss said he'd give me one more chance, but if I
got up to any more monkey tricks he'd leather my inside out, and
turn me out. Sent me to get some flowers ordered at a flower
shop. My, they were beauties! Met Jess Perkins, and she said
she'd never speak to me again if I didn't give her one. Then a
friend of hers came along, and she must have one, and between
them they made a show of the flowers; but what's a fellow to do
when the girls get hold of him, especially when he's a bit of a
masher? Took them home, and the boss asked me if that was the
condition I got them in. Of course I said it was, and he wrote a
note and told me to take 'em back with the note. There was a fine
old row at that shop, and the man sent me back with another note.
I went with a boy who said he knew where there was a shark in a
fishmonger's shop. He was a liar. It wasn't a shark; it was a
schnapper. I didn't care about going back at once, as I thought
the cove would be showing his nasty temper, and I wouldn't give
him a chance, so I just knocked about with some fellows who were
out on messages like myself. When it struck 1 o'clock I went
back. I thought he might come back from his lunch in a decent
temper. I had eaten my lunch, and I and a boy from the next floor
were doing some Tivoli business, when in walks my noble as black
me sin. He hunted the other boy in a very rude fashion,
considering that he was my guest; then he got me by the ear, and
as for calling names, why a Turk wouldn't have gone on like he
did. And the worse names he called me the harder he milled my
ear. Seems the flower shop people had written back to him, and
said that I was everything that was bad, and sent their own boy
with more flowers 'cause they couldn't trust me. What he wanted
to go for for I couldn't make out. He got his flowers all right
in the end. There's no pleasing everybody in this world; blowed
if I ever seen such a place. There's been no harm done, and all
this racket is just because a boy takes a little innocent
diversion. Are we slaves?</p>

<p class="first">
July 6, 9 a.m.&mdash; Me and the boy from upstairs were making
it up to go fishing this afternoon, when my nibbs came half an
hour before his proper time. Low sort of thing that. He told the
upstairs boy that if he ever caught him loafing to his office
again he'd see that he got the run. Meaning that he'd tell his
employer about him. Mean sort of thing that. Would a gentleman do
it? Then he froze on to me, and ratted me like a good 'un, just
because I'd been busy over my private business, and hadn't swept
and tidied the office; and would anyone believe it? When I
started in big licks and began to rattle round, he told me to go
to blazes and keep quiet. What can you do with such a man?
Presently he sent me out on an errand to Erskine-street, and told
me if I wasn't back in half an hour he'd have my blood. Seems to
think a boy can fly. Went through Wynyard Square, and just
stopped to watch some boys playing with a football. Then the band
was playing, and I had to wait till they'd gone through all their
selection. There was a man painting a sign, and he did it very
well too. Some boys were going down to swim a dog, and wanted me
to go, but I wouldn't. I told them I was in a hurry. How the time
flies! I found that I'd been gone an hour already. Seems as
though a fellow hadn't time to turn round, the days are so short.
I delivered my message, and just had a look at the men laying the
drain pipes, and started back, for I remembered that the office
shut at 12 o'clock. Got back in nice time, ten minutes before;
and before I could say a single word the cove told me that he
couldn't afford to keep a boy of my tastes any longer.</p>

<p class="first">
12 Noon.&mdash; Sacked! I despise a man who won't give a boy a
character after working him like a nigger all the week.</p>

<h2><a id="ch31"></a>31. &mdash; THE FIRST DISCOVERERS OF THE WEST AUSTRALIAN GOLDFIELDS</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney,  29 Jan and 12 Feb 1898</h3>

<p class="first">
THE view from the crest of the rise whereon the two men were
standing was not particularly inviting&mdash;mostly scrub, with
here and there a bare mound of rock rising out of the dark
foliage. These rocky hills, however, were what the two men were
gazing on most curiously. For at the base of these hills was
often a good supply of water in the curious rock holes peculiar
to West Australia.</p>

<p>'Which one do you pick on, Joe?' said one man.</p>

<p>'That camel-backed one there, nearly due west.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I like the look of that one the best. I'll just get the
bearing, and we'll start; it only wants a couple of hours to
sundown.'</p>

<p>The speaker took out his pocket compass and got their course;
then he and his companion rode slowly down the rough descent, and
the blackboy they had with them drove the spare and pack horses
after them. In about an hour's time they reached the foot of the
rock mound, and found there was a cavity at the base of it, well
filled with water. Around the hill, as is usually the case, there
was a ring of open country, fairly well grassed, so that they
had, much to their satisfaction, a comfortable camp for
themselves and horses.</p>

<p>The men were prospectors, returning from a long trip in the
interior, and an unsuccessful one to boot.</p>

<p>Joe Jackson had been sauntering round the base of the rock
where, as usual, the blacks had scratched many signs, including
the favorite one of the devil's tracks&mdash;a footprint with six
toes&mdash;when something peculiar attracted his attention, and
he called his companion, Harmston, to come to him. Harmston came
over to him.</p>

<p>'That's a queer looking inscription for a nigger to make,' he
said, pointing to what appeared to be the rude representation of
a tricolored flag on the rock.</p>

<p>'A French flag,' said Harmston, in surprise.</p>

<p>'I thought so at first, and now I think it is meant for the
German.'</p>

<p>He took Harmston over to another place, and showed him a rough
scrawl of a double-headed eagle.</p>

<p>'Who could have made this?' said Harmston.</p>

<p>'Goodness knows,' answered Jackson. Suddenly he put his hands
to his forehead, and, with an effort, said, 'I did! I remember
now. I was sailor on the <i>Freistadt</i>, wrecked on the west
coast of New Holland. Taken by the blacks, and brought out here.
<i>I!</i> <i>I!</i> <i>I!</i> put those marks on that rock, for I
was dying, and my grave is close here.'</p>

<p>Harmston gazed at his mate in astonishment and awe. Jackson's
eyes were dilated, and his face was distorted in a way that made
him look another man.</p>

<p>'How long ago was that?' asked Harmston, recovering himself
sufficiently to put the question.</p>

<p>'How long ago? How can I tell? One, two hundred years! Search
out the records when the good ship <i>Freistadt</i> was lost,
then you will know. I was one of two survivors, and saw and found
strange things. Here! Quick! quick!' and with the last
exclamation Harmston sprang forward in time to catch his mate,
who was falling down in an epileptic fit.</p>

<p>He loosened his collar, and called loudly to the blackboy to
bring some water. After a time Jackson revived, and, after
mumbling for some few minutes, looked around and spat a mouthful
of blood out of his mouth.</p>

<p>'Have I had a fit?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, or I never saw a man in a fit before,' replied
Harmston.</p>

<p>'I thought they had left me for ever,' returned Jackson, in a
tone of genuine grief. 'What could have brought such a curse on
me again? That I was subject to them as a boy I know, but I
thought I had long since grown out of any fear of a relapse.
Otherwise, old man, I would have told you before we started. Ugh!
I've bitten my tongue nearly through.'</p>

<p>Harmston helped Jackson back to camp, for he was weak after
the violent fit that had overcome him.</p>

<p><br>
WHEN Jackson was recovered Harmston told him of the strange
words he had spoken while the epilepsy held him in its grip, but
Jackson could make nothing of them. The thought that after having
outgrown, as he thought, the terrible infliction, he should again
suffer from it seemed to weigh heavily on his spirits.</p>

<p>The next morning Harmston ascended the granite mound to take a
look round. To the south was a jumble of hills, with red, bluff
faces, and somehow he felt attracted towards going to examine
them. Coming back to breakfast he proposed the trip to Jackson,
intending to return to their present camp at night. Jackson
agreed to this, and the two started, leaving the blackboy in camp
to look after it.</p>

<p>The red hills were not more than about seven miles away, and
they soon reached them. As they approached, Harmston noticed that
there were several caves in the face of one of the bluffs&mdash;a
not uncommon feature in that region. They fastened their horses
up, and ascended the hill of the caves. Entering the first one, a
large and deep one, Harmston saw in the marks of fire and other
signs that it had been much used by the natives as an encampment
place.</p>

<p>Suddenly Harmston heard Jackson speaking in the same peculiar
tone he had used the night before.</p>

<p>'It was here! here, that Fritz died, and I wrote his name over
there, where I left his body. It was after we had found the gold
down south&mdash;the gold that was of no use to us! Look! look
over there!'</p>

<p>His face suddenly became convulsed again, and Harmston,
catching him in his arms, let him down on the floor of the
cavern. Hastily drawing his sheath-knife, he inserted the handle
between Jackson's teeth, to save the laceration of his tongue.
He recovered slowly, and looked somewhat wildly about him, but
the mood soon passed.</p>

<p>'Have I had one of those fits again?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Yes,' returned Harmston. 'Now, if you are well, I want to go
over and look at that corner.'</p>

<p>'I will sit here for a while,' said Jackson, and Harmston went
over to the place pointed out by Jackson. The cave was quite
light enough to see plainly, and Harmston looked along the walls
seeking to find some inscription. He was successful in
discovering some sort of lettering, rudely and imperfectly
scratched, but evidently not aboriginal work. He could make
nothing of it without more light, so struck a match. This
attracted Jackson, who came over.</p>

<p>'What are you looking at?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Something like letters on the wall,' returned Harmston.</p>

<p>Together they examined the inscription, which read in German
characters 'Fritz Greben.'</p>

<p>This was all, and it was not without much difficulty they made
out that much. There appeared to be a date, but they could not
decipher it. Looking about on the floor, Harmston found a
tarnished buckle, but nothing else. He walked back to the
entrance of the cavern, and with his companion descended to where
their horses were tied up.</p>

<p>They had brought a meal and their water bags with them, and
while sitting over it Harmston broached the subject of Jackson's
strange sayings.</p>

<p>'I can make nothing of it,' returned the other. 'Try as I may,
I have no remembrance of being here before in a former state of
existence, as you would seem to suggest. Besides, what German
ships ever came here? In fact, there were no German ships until
of late years, at least out here.'</p>

<p>'Granted,' returned his mate; 'but might there not have been
German sailors on Dutch ships, or even Portuguese or Spanish
vessels?'</p>

<p>'Of course there might, and that name and the buckle form a
very strange coincidence. When we have finished we will make
another attempt to find out that date.'</p>

<p>Their meal finished, they reascended to the cave and pored
over the date. They made out clearly that the concluding letters
were <i>87</i>, but what the century was had become obliterated
by time. Baffled, they returned to their camp.</p>

<p>'Shall we go south?' asked Harmston of his mate when smoking
their last pipe that night.</p>

<p>'I would, but I am frightened at the return of these epileptic
fits. They might come on me when alone. No, I should much like to
solve the mystery, but I think we'll go on to civilisation. Get
another mate, old man, and follow the thing up.'</p>

<p>'Not much good that. That there is something in it the buckle
and inscription prove; but you, I believe, possess the clue; and
without you it would only be searching for the needle we have all
heard so much about.'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry, but these fits have upset me; I want to get back.
Some day, perhaps, we will try it. Not now, old fellow, not
now.'</p>

<p>Harmston saw that his companion and old friend was completely,
unnerved, and pressed him no further.</p>

<p><br>
NEXT morning they continued on their way, and soon reached the
outskirts of settlement. Harmston and Jackson parted finally at
the seaport of Geraldton&mdash;one to go east, the other to the
new gold field, just broken out, in the south, now known as
Coolgardie.</p>

<p>IT WAS two years afterwards that Harmston, then making fairly
good wages on a western gold field, received a letter from
Jackson, his former mate. The whole tone was despairing. He said
that the recurrence of the epileptic fits had completely ruined
him; that he was now engaged in the most degrading occupation in
the world to keep himself from starvation. It was hiring himself
out as a subject to a professional mesmeriser, to whom his
epileptic affliction made him a ready subject. He entreated his
old mate to rescue him from this abject position, if he was in a
position to do so.</p>

<p>Harmston, a steady-going fellow, had some money laid by, and
lost no time it sending over enough to enable Jackson to join
him. He came in a few months&mdash;the wreck of the man he once
knew. Harmston got him work, and gradually the man came out
again, and, under healthy influences and surroundings, became his
old self. As his nervous system was restored to its balance so
did his hatred of his whilom master, who had exhibited his
infirmity to the public for money, grow in intensity, and it
promised to be a bad time for Professor Stukes, as he called
himself, if ever he showed up on Katinnup, West Australia.</p>

<p><br>
IT came about that the man did appear. The announcements of
the 'famous mesmeric king,' Professor Stukes, who was about to
pay a visit to the gold fields of West Australia, were in time
displayed in the mining township, and, after a tour amongst the
other gold fields, the man came to Katinnup. By the time he had
given two or three performances Harmston noticed that Jackson
grew restless and uneasy. He had tried to persuade him to go on a
prospecting trip, but without avail, and the fourth night Jackson
was missing.</p>

<p>Harmston went to the mesmeriser's show without thinking over
the matter. To his plain sense it seemed obvious that his
weak-minded and afflicted comrade had succumbed once more to the
charlatan's influence. He entered the rough hall where
entertainments were held, and watched the performance. True
enough, amongst the poor degraded wretches paraded on the stage
was his mate, Jackson.</p>

<p>Without a word, Harmston arose and walked forward; he was too
well known and popular to be detained by anybody in that place,
and he mounted the platform without any opposition, and put his
hand upon Jackson's shoulder, and called him by name. The
professor, a man with bright eyes and a scrubby moustache, of no
evident nationality, stepped forward, and said:</p>

<p>'Sir! how dare you interfere with one of my subjects in this
way?'</p>

<p>'Go to the devil,' returned Harmston, 'Take your infernal
control off this man, or I'll wreck you and your show in two
minutes.'</p>

<p>The so-called professor stood aghast. He gazed at the cold,
blue eyes of Harmston, and found nothing to say. Harmston looked
round at the audience, many of whom had arisen, and were crowding
towards the stage, and the professor recognised that at a word
from him the threat would be accomplished. He made some passes,
and Jackson, dazed and silly, passed out with his old friend.</p>

<p>The remainder of the show was not desired, and Professor
Stukes got immediate notice to quit, before there was
trouble.</p>

<p>'I can't make it out,' said Jackson, as, half recovered, he
sat with Harmston in his old home, 'but that man dragged me away
in spite of myself. What an unhappy being I am to be cursed like
this. No will to fight against that miserable creature.'</p>

<p>The door opened as he spoke, and the 'miserable creature' in
question stood before them. Jackson started to his feet, his face
blazing with rage end fury. Harmston put a restraining hand upon
him, and held him back.</p>

<p>'Mr. Harmston,' said the professor, 'I want a private word
with you. Would you mind stepping outside with me?'</p>

<p><br>
HARMSTON went out and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>'That man has a secret, a forgotten one, of a former life
which I have not the right kind of influence to obtain from him,'
said the mesmerist.</p>

<p>'How do you know?' asked Harmston.</p>

<p>'Because he has told me of what happened when you and he were
out prospecting together, naturally I tried my utmost to find out
all about it, but I have always failed.'</p>

<p>'Well, what can I do in the matter?'</p>

<p>'Take us to the place where it happened; perhaps on the
original spot I may succeed.'</p>

<p>'You propose then to mesmerise him on the locality?'</p>

<p>'Yes; or you might do it if you possess the mesmeric power,
and more people have it than they think.'</p>

<p>Harmston thought for some time; then he replied.</p>

<p>'I don't believe in your jugglery, and I don't believe in
subduing any man's will and robbing him of independent action.
But I will ask Joe himself, and if he consents I will take you to
the spot; but, mind you, I don't undertake to hold your life safe
from him. You have brought him to that state that he is
dangerous. Remember, he is an epileptic.'</p>

<p>The mesmerist quailed a little.</p>

<p>'That is so, but I must take my chance. However, I will think
of some scheme by which my going could be obviated. If you will
try an experiment or two on him, it might answer as well.'</p>

<p>'I won't give you any answer until I have talked with Jackson.
I know I have great influence over him, but whether I can
hypnotise I don't know. Now, you had better keep out of his sight
and meet me in town to-morrow. Where are you stopping?'</p>

<p>'At the Better Luck.'</p>

<p>'Very well. I'll be there some time tomorrow.'</p>

<p>Harmston returned to the hut and told Jackson of the
conversation; but as he saw that his friend was still very
excited he proposed postponing his discussion of it till the
morning.</p>

<p><br>
IN the morning Jackson was much calmer, and agreed that
Harmston should try the experiment on him, as he could not trust,
himself alone for such a long time with the mesmeriser.</p>

<p>Harmston therefore went out to keep his appointment. He met
the man he sought, and from him received certain instructions. On
his return he put them in force and obtained a partial success.
Repeated efforts for some days, however, produced a successful
result and then he desisted, thinking they could practise on the
road to the spot. Of course, the mesmerist had stipulated for a
certain share of the result.</p>

<p>Fortunately the season was good, and as settlement had much
increased the two friends safely reached the spot where the
buckle had formerly been picked up.</p>

<p>'We will camp here to-night,' said Harmston, 'and start fair
in the morning.'</p>

<p>The morning of the eventful day broke fair, and moderately
cool. Then the crucial experiment commended. Stukes having
advised it should take place before breakfast.</p>

<p>In the cavern the morning sun was just entering when Jackson
commenced talking, and in response to Harmston's questions he
told the following tale:</p>

<p><br>
IN 1784 the ship <i>Freistadt</i>, bound for Batavia, was
wrecked on a reef of rocks called the Abrolhos on the west coast
of Australia, (whereon many Dutch ships had already been
wrecked), and only two Prussian sailors escaped. This was
strange, for there were only two men of this nationality amongst
the crew, and Prussian sailors were not common in those days.
Although fellow countrymen, these two men had never been friends:
but thrown together on a lonely uninhabited continent they
naturally buried the hatchet, and put their heads together and
discussed their best plan of action. The best plan was rather a
problem, for there seemed no best plan. It was a choice of
sitting still to wait for death or walking out to meet him.</p>

<p>Jackson, or Gandoon, the name belonging to his former
existence, was for walking on somewhere and seeing what the
country was like, and if the inhabitants were peaceful and
friendly. Greben preferred to stop where they were and die in
despair, proclaiming that the natives of that country were
monsters and giants, horrible cannibals. So Gandoon left him, and
fell in with some natives, who proved peaceful, but miserable,
and as hungry as himself, Matters were not improved by this,
excepting that they showed him where to obtain water, and also
gave him some wretched vermin to eat.</p>

<p>He went back to where he had left Greben, and coming
unexpectedly upon him found out the reason of his disinclination
to accompany him. He had found some provisions which had been
washed ashore, but had said nothing of his find to his
shipwrecked mate; and was now enjoying a meal, slightly damaged
it is true, and washed down with a bottle of wine which had come
safely ashore.</p>

<p>Naturally there was a quarrel, and Gandoon insisted on his
share and got it. They then made a closer investigation of the
shore, and found many more, useful and edible objects. But the
seeds of mistrust had been sown between them, and even in their
misery and loneliness they looked on each other with suspicion.
In the end they had to join the natives and lead the wretched
wandering life that they did. Gradually they worked back, finding
that more game was to be obtained in the more inland parts of the
great unknown land they were in. They, of course, went nude like
the blacks, but carried with them some of their metal
accoutrements. Time went on, and they found themselves in the
country to be afterwards known as the Murchison, and south of
that region also. Here the catastrophe occurred that brought on
the end.</p>

<p>Sitting in the cave in which they then were they had one of
their oft-recurring disputes, and Greben tauntingly said, 'If I
could only reach civilisation I should be one of the richest men
in Europe.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' asked the other.</p>

<p>'I mean that I know where there is gold piled in
heaps&mdash;heaps, I tell you.'</p>

<p>'And why have you not told me before?'</p>

<p>'Why? Why should I? It is useless to us here, but it was grand
to watch it, and think and dream of all it would bring me away
from here.'</p>

<p>'You kept your pleasure to yourself seemingly.'</p>

<p>'It would have been worth nothing shared with you. No, I must
imagine that I was the sole owner, the sole possessor of such
wonderful wealth. That thought brought me nearer to my
fellow-men.'</p>

<p>'You selfish brute; we have no pleasures in this wilderness
where we are doomed to die, and you kept one to yourself.'</p>

<p>'I did, and it was grand to think of you not knowing all the
time.'</p>

<p>'I will not! it is far from here!'</p>

<p>'You lie, you cur; it is close at hand.'</p>

<p>Greben only sneered, which so infuriated the other man that he
sprang on him and hurled him to the ground. A savage combat then
ensued in the desert cave; the two men fighting, and cursing each
other as they did so; two brutes whom the gold was of no earthly
value, tearing each other like wild beasts because one had not
told the other of its existence.</p>

<p>At last Gandoon conquered, and Greben, a naked, battered piece
of humanity, lay gasping and dying in the cave.</p>

<p>'Mark me!' he growled; 'There are other lives but this; and in
the next will come my turn. I shall be master then! Remember!' He
died, almost, with the words on his lips. Gandoon was alone. But
reason had deserted him for a time.</p>

<p><br>
GOLD! the useless gold! ran riot in his brain, and he spurned
his dead foe. But his own wounds were stiff and painful, and he
dragged himself to a rock-hole to bathe and wash them. There he
lay in little better condition than his enemy. Three days passed,
and he was tended and nursed by the tribe they were then amongst,
and he was strong again. Meantime they had raised their death
wail over the other dead white man after the way of their
people.</p>

<p>Still impressed with the gold craze, he started out to look
for it, feeling sure that he could identify the place near an old
camp where he remembered he had often wondered at Greben's long
absences&mdash;hunting as he went, for he was now expert at it.
He found the old camp, and then he found the reef of
gold&mdash;as he thought&mdash;for shining lumps were visible on
a long line of reef.</p>

<p>All the fascination that had possessed the dead Greben entered
into him. He found where Greben had broken off pieces and played
with them; built cairns of them; laughed, doubtless, at the idea.
that they were no more to him than pebbles. And then suddenly his
reason returned. He saw all the folly of it&mdash;the madness! He
had slain his only white companion for what were really but
common pebbles, as, far as they were concerned. Henceforth he
must live out his life amongst savages&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>This thought oppressed him almost to suicide; but he held his
hand, and, a solitary Cain, went forth to return to the cave. The
blacks had left when he reached there; but that did not trouble
him. He was thenceforth as solitary with them as by himself, and
he knew how to sustain life in that region. He went and looked at
the body of his late companion, but the dogs had been in and torn
it. Then, in pity, he scrawled the dead man's name and the date
on the wall of the cave, and left the place. His wayward
footsteps took him to the granite mound, where he scrawled the
double-headed eagle and the Prussian flag. There, too, he found
his former companions, the natives, camped, and amongst them,
after a week or two, died, and was buried after their
fashion.</p>

<p><br>
IT was not to be supposed that this story was obtained at
once, or in such detail; but Harmston pieced it together as he
got it, and the substance was as above. Nor did he tell Jackson
all he had learned, but enough for his purpose. He thought from
the scanty directions that he was quite bushman enough to find
the place.</p>

<p>When Jackson was sufficiently recovered from the somewhat
severe ordeal he had passed through, he and Harmston started to
look for the mysterious reef that had cost the lives of the two
forlorn outcasts in the last century. It took some time and
trouble. Nature, had changed somewhat, even in that slow-changing
land. But they found it at last, and their work was done. But to
Harmston's eyes it appeared a better reef to sell than to work. A
reef peculiar to that part of Australia, where a rich blow on the
surface deceives the inexperienced. However, they tested it, and
found that it went down sufficiently far to render it quite
valuable enough to take up. So it was taken up under the name of
the 'Dream Reef,' and in due course a small mining nucleus formed
about the place.</p>

<p>Stukes was duly informed of the find and its prospects, but
Harmston advised him not to come up, as Jackson was, not to he
trusted in his presence; but in spite of all Stukes
came&mdash;his avarice made him risk the danger.</p>

<p><br>
IT was a dull night, and the little township round the "Dream
Reef" had retired, for the place had not yet become large enough
for much gorgeous dissipation. Jackson, in his bunk awoke with a
strange feeling in him that there was something, wrong going on
down at the reef, and he must go and see what it was. He arose
quietly without disturbing Harmston, and went down there. In the
dim half light he could both see and hear that somebody was
moving about. Somebody! His instinct at once told him who. He
felt that Stukes, the man he most hated in the world was there;
and he was.</p>

<p>The two men met.</p>

<p>'Oh, Jackson, how are you?' he said. 'Good thing we met,
wasn't it, after all?'</p>

<p>'Met!' said Jackson, in a low mutter. 'But we have met
hereabouts many times before. Met here more than a hundred years
ago! You are Greben come back. You have had your revenge, and now
I'll have mine!'</p>

<p>And he sprang on his ancient foe. A dim memory of something
came back to Stukes as he spoke; then somehow he remembered all,
and the re-incarnated enemies joined once more in fierce and
savage combat. They made little noise, but fought as before, like
human beasts. A sleepy miner awoke, and remarked that two dogs
were fighting somewhere, that was all.</p>

<p>When Harmston awoke at daylight and missed Jackson he
suspected something was wrong. Naturally he went to the reef
first. There he found the story, he alone knew of, ended for the
second time in a grim and ghastly fashion. Both men were
dead.</p>

<p>He got assistance, but would give no explanation. How could
he?</p>

<p>'Is the story ended only till the end of the next century?' he
thought with a shudder. 'A feud to the death to be fought out
through eternity!'</p>

<h2><a id="ch32"></a>32. &mdash; THE GREAT CATACLYSM OF 1897</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 22 May 1897</h3>

<p class="first">
WHEN the news came of the earthquake shocks in eastern South
Australia, nobody guessed that it was the first ominous message
of a change in our continent to one phase of its former
condition. We might receive slight tremors but we were not over
the active earthquake belt, that had ceased in Australia
thousands and thousands or years ago.</p>

<p>The catastrophe cause suddenly. Suddenly it was flashed
through that the earthquake shocks were travelling east, and that
the dead old volcanoes in south-west Victoria were showing signs
of strange commotion. The panic in that colony was great, but as
nothing serious occurred it calmed down. In Sydney nothing
happened, and the people, believing themselves secure in the
mountain barrier between them and the scene of disturbance, did
not deem it possible that anything could happen.</p>

<p>It was on the night of June 20 that a strange phenomenon was
observable in the heavens to the south-west. Clouds of beautiful
but fiery red obscured the sky long after darkness set in. People
remained in the streets watching and discussing the strange
sight. Gradually these clouds took on a more beautiful change;
the tints became the hues of the rainbow; changing rapidly, now
steady, as the bow. So glorious was the sight that all the
population must have been watching it. None regarded it as a
portent, nothing of such radiant loveliness could be a dire
messenger of an awful cataclysm?</p>

<p>Gradually it got whispered about that this was so. None could
tell how the disquieting rumor stole through the air and
gathered, but it soon became prevalent, and men looked at each
other beneath that ominous light with awe and fear.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became known that all communication between the
southern colonies had been destroyed, and that messages were
coming rapidly from Brisbane and the north asking the meaning of
this wondrous glow to the south. This aroused wild terror in
many, for what great convulsion could it be that was rending the
continent, when the dwellers in the distant north of Queensland
were gazing at it like themselves?</p>

<p>And then arose a wail throughout the crowded thousands that
Melbourne, Adelaide, and all the prosperous cities of the former
colony had perished under a fiery outbreak such as belonged to
the past ages of the world's birth. Many shrieked out that it was
the long-predicted last day, and others lost their wits, for now
the clouds changed their form, and darted upward in streamers,
fiery red once more. Some called out in frantic terror that it
was the flames of hell made visible, and wild appeals arose from
religious enthusiasts that all should hasten to implore God's
mercy.</p>

<p>And in the midst of this mad frenzy of distraction and appeal,
a great and awful darkness fell like a pall. At once the silence
of death seemed to hush the terrified cries. So dense and
impenetrable was that darkness that the electric lights could not
pierce it, and men stopped, trembling, where they were, afraid to
move. None hoped for dawn; truly it was the end at last, and they
could only wait for death in silence. Many died and many lost
their reason during the awful hours passed waiting for the last
trump.</p>

<p>But dawn broke, gloomy and sullen, with fog and vapor, and the
braver spirits cheered up the weaker, and life resumed its
interrupted round. Vigorous efforts were at ones instituted to
communicate with the outlying portions, and find out what had
happened, but it was found impossible to do this as the wires
would not act; they had suddenly become dumb. The electric
currents refused to work; so all must wait until news crept
slowly in.</p>

<p>In the city was universal mourning, for so many weak and
ailing had died from the shock. No business was done, for the day
had a strange depressing effect that affected everybody; and the
sun shone redly through a bank of vapor. Vessels went out, but
made no progress, for the fog hung over the sea and refused to
lift. And all waited through that day in terror for the night,
for none could surmise the extent of the catastrophe that had
befallen the continent; only it must have been something to which
Krakatoa had been a rushlight.</p>

<p><br>
THAT night the sky again loomed red, as though the clouds were
incandescent, but had the more sullen appearance of the red coals
of a fire without the flame. Men sought the open places, and few
remained within their houses, for a slight tremor had been felt,
very slight, but enough to show that danger lurked beneath the
earth.</p>

<p>It was in the early part of the night that a strange sensation
was felt that the earth had become unsteady. Many sickened and
fainted, but those that analysed the feeling knew that it was no
fancy; the earth was rising. At what awful depth the propulsion
originated could only be guessed by the fact that the centre of
gravity was not disturbed in any of the buildings. It was a
certain, steady upheaval of the whole country. Suddenly arose a
great cry of dismay from the foreshores of Port Jackson; and with
it merged a rushing sound that gathered force and volume. The
waters of the harbor were retreating into the sea.</p>

<p>The confusion and dismay was appalling as the ships turned on
their flashlights to see where they were settling down, and
louder and louder, mingling and finally domineering the more
human sounds, came the mighty roar of the waters rushing out
through the narrow entrance of the Heads. This night seemed to
surpass the former one in Nature's terrors. All they were
thankful for was that the darkness of the former night was not
repeated. The lurid sky still glowed with ominous light. But
perhaps this was even more appalling, for the waters of the
harbor reflected the red light and a sea of blood swirled and
rushed to the parent ocean. Nothing could be done by the ships;
the wild tumult at the Heads, always increasing, forbade any
attempt to get to sea.</p>

<p>And so another morning of horror dawned upon the people of
Sydney. More horrible was it to those who looked upon the bottom
of the harbor now laid bare to the eyes of man. For awful
creatures, such as the surface never sees, had been caught in
pools and left behind, and these fought with the sharks which had
met the same fate. The slimy seaweed waved and dosed over their
struggles; and there, too, lay the ribs of lost vessels and the
white bones of drowned men.</p>

<p>The upheaval seemed to have ended and men walked the Streets
again, but still in fear stood trembling, for who knew what was
yet to come? Despair was in their hearts, for was not the
commerce of the city destroyed for ever by this relentless act of
nature's wrath?</p>

<p>But there were no more manifestations of unrest, and gradually
they took heart, and set about to try find out what changes had
taken place. It was no good sitting down and looking about upon
what once had been their harbor, now only stranded vessels and
rotting sea monsters. That was a danger that must be disposed of,
else a pestilence would come and devastate the land. The nebulous
red clouds only appeared at sundown the following night, and did
not remain long after dusk. And the next day the telegraph lines
worked once more. Then they got news.</p>

<p><br>
ALL along the eastern coast the upheaval had been the same. No
damage had been done to buildings, but every seaport had been
rendered worthless. The Great Barrier Reef stood high above the
water, and the whole face of the coast was changed.</p>

<p>But from south came news that confirmed their worst
apprehensions. Melbourne, the Marvellous, had disappeared,
vanished in a fiery outbreak that still smoked ominously. The
whole of the Victorian towns of the centre and east were more or
less destroyed, and repetitions of the outbreaks, on a smaller
scale, still continued. Soon the leading spirits rose to the
occasion. If they had lost their ports they would find and found
others, and gradually they would rise once more. But more
misfortune was in store for them.</p>

<p>As news came in it was found that the upheaval of the land had
diverted the courses of the rivers. The Murray, Murrumbidgee, and
Darling were no longer navigable&mdash;the steamers lay wrecked
and grounded. That this even could be remedied they thought, for
the snows of Townsend and Kosciusko must melt as formerly, and
run their course to the sea in new channels. Man reasserts
himself always after a time, and as they thought of all the help
that would pour in from other lands if they, too, had not
suffered under the same calamity, they walked erect again.</p>

<p><br>
THEN came the end. One night the same slight but steady
tremor was experienced, and again the trembling crowds waited in
the streets. But this time the land was subsiding. Men began to
congratulate themselves, the harbor would be refilled, the land
restored to its former aspect and, only for the loss of a fair
province and a million of people, it would be the Australia of
before.</p>

<p>The sea re-entered the harbor and with the brightening they
saw its familiar waters once more. They crept into the old bays
and nooks and came on and on. Then came loud cries of alarm, for
Australia was returning to its very old condition. The subsidence
went on and on; and now the panic of fear took everybody; for
this enemy was one that none could hope to meet or stem. On came
the waters, more riotous as they proceeded, as if in joy over
their reconquered territory. On and on went the steady and grim
subsidence of the land, the submergence of life, of towns, of all
the works of man. This was no petty rain-flood; thousands of
years ago the ocean had gambolled there, and now she was coming
back to her old playground.</p>

<p>When the subsidence ceased Australia was a continent no
longer. The highlands of the east and the mountain ranges
remained alone intact as a continuous narrow island, but the
waters of Spencer's Gulf had shaken hands with Carpentaria, and
only an archipelago of islands here and there remained to show
what was once the lost Atlantis of Australia. The fertile and
populous littoral of the east and south, the hearts of the
continent, were beneath the Indian, Southern, and Pacific
Oceans.</p>

<h2><a id="ch33"></a>33. &mdash; HALF A POEM</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney,  10 March 1900</h3>

<p class="first">
IT is in a shabby office, in a small, up-country town, that
the scene of this sketch is laid.</p>

<p>Under other and better circumstances the editor might not have
been considered a very old man, although he was sixty years of
age. But as he sat in his hot little oven of an office, broken
down with the weight of disappointed hopes, misused
opportunities, and all the cares that come upon a man as life
grows long and weary, he looked his three score and ten. He sat
there doing nothing, not even caring to read the exchanges which
lay upon the table, thinking, as he had lately taken to doing
very often, of all the blasted hopes of his early youth, and his
declension in his old age into being the editor of the smallest
of small journals in a poor little country township. What was
there in front of him? Nothing, but a grave in the cemetery,
where the cattle strolled through the gaps in the fence, and
browsed amongst the 'cold <i>hic jacets</i>' of the dead.</p>

<p>He was roused from his gloomy reverie by a halting footstep,
and a man as old-looking as himself; but crippled, broken, and
bent, looked in at the door.</p>

<p>'Ullo! old fellow! In the dumps?'</p>

<p>'Not more than usual. Come in and have a yarn about old
times.'</p>

<p>The man came in and sat down.</p>

<p>'Everett,' he said, 'we are getting old, no doubt of it, but I
never expected to settle down to die as a sixth-class overseer on
a very seventh-class station, any more than you did to end like
this. Strange how we should have drifted together in this manner,
after the old days on Saltop, when I hadn't a bone broken, and
you, my jackeroo, had a bright career before you whenever you
chose to chuck up station work, and take to better things.'</p>

<p>'I was just thinking about it all. Why come in and make it
worse?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, only for companionship.'</p>

<p>There was the rattle of wheels and the sound of hoofs on, the
road, and both men glanced up, with a surprised look, for the
vehicle had stopped in front of the newspaper office&mdash;a most
unusual thing at this time of the day, in the hot little
township.</p>

<p>Everett got up, and went to the door. A buggy drawn by a neat
little horse had stopped. The girl who was driving might have
been any age between 12 and 16. She wore a big, shady hat, and
looked up at Everett with bright and winning eyes. Beside her sat
an old man; he wore goggles, and seemed rather helpless. The girl
beckoned to Everett, who stepped out to see what she wanted, for
she was a stranger to him.</p>

<p>'You're Mr. Everett?' she asked.</p>

<p>'I am.'</p>

<p>'Would you please help my grandfather out; he has came to see
you. His name is Logan; but his eyesight has failed,' she ran on
in a delightful prattle.</p>

<p>Everett helped the old man out, and led him into the office,
while the girl, in a workman-like manner, took a halter out of
the buggy, and made the pony secure to one of the posts of the
small verandah. That done, she followed into the place, where her
grandfather had been deposited in a chair, of which there were
only two in the place.</p>

<p>'You are Miss Logan, then?' Queried Everett.</p>

<p>'No,' said the girl, who was unceremoniously unbuttoning and
taking off her gloves. 'I am Jessie Marks; grandfather is my
mother's father. Now, I'll tell you all about it,' she continued,
taking the only other chair, which Everett offered her, while he
perched himself on the table, and the lame man did the same,
which was a rash proceeding, for the table was not by any means
strong.</p>

<p>'You see,' the girl rambled on confidentially, 'I've always
looked after grandfather&mdash;read to him and all that. Now, the
other day I got hold of one of your papers, and grandfather asked
me where it came from; and I read out that it was published and
printed and so on by G. R. Everett. Then grandfather suddenly
said, "Everett! why, Jessie, that's the young fellow I've so
often told you about, and our trip together for five days, when
we took the cattle up along the back of the Wall, and he told me
all about the way to look at the bush." So, as I had heard so
much about your son, I said, "Grandfather, we'll go and see him;"
we live forty miles away, but my sister's place is only fifteen
miles, so we stopped there last night, and came on this morning.
Now, Mr. Everett, where is your son?'</p>

<p>All this had been rushed put without pause for breath, and
Everett stood aghast.</p>

<p>'My dear young lady, I never had a son.'</p>

<p>The lame man leaned forward.</p>

<p>'Did you say that your grandfather's name was Logan?' he
asked. 'Is he deaf?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied the girl, with a surprised look on her face.
The lame man, whose name was Brown, put his hand on Everett's
shoulder.</p>

<p>'It's Jack Logan&mdash;Deaf Jack! My stockman at Saltop. You
and he did come up together at the back of the Wall, bringing
back the store cattle that had got away. A good trip it was, too.
Don't you remember it?'</p>

<p>'Do I remember it? Of course I do; it was a lovely trip, and
the track had never been taken before. Forty years ago, and this
is Jack Logan&mdash;Deaf Jack?'</p>

<p>They had almost forgotten the girl, but she had been listening
intently. 'And you have no son, Mr. Everett? Who was the man who
went that trip with my grandfather? The young man with the bright
eyes, who told him the wonderful stories of the bush, and showed
him what it really was? Are you the man?'</p>

<p>In her excitement the girl had arisen, and laid her hand on
the editor's arm.</p>

<p>'I was the man,' replied Everett sadly, but looking kindly in
the girl's face. 'Time has no more stood still with me than it
has with your grandfather.'</p>

<p>The girl rested her pretty-shaped chin on her hand, and
thought. The old man, deaf and nearly blind, dozed easily in the
chair. Brown leant forward and listened.</p>

<p>'You see,' she said, taking Everett's hand, and tapping on it
with her other forefinger, as a sort of accompaniment, 'it was
all this way. I've always been grandfather's girl, and the
favorite story he always told me was about the time that he lived
on a station called Saltop. The owner was a Mr. Brown, a young
man, who could do anything, or ride anything&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I am the man,' said Brown, as sadly as Everett had said the
words.</p>

<p>'But most of all,' went on the young, fresh voice, 'he loved
to tell me of a trip he had once, with a young fellow named
Everett. They went after some stray cattle, and brought them back
by a way that only one or two had been before. This was my
favorite story. How they camped one night at a small waterhole,
and the young man talked nearly half the night, for the cattle
were still and quiet. Drew his attention to the wonderful voices
of the bush night. The whirr of the widgeon bursting into the
still water, as if from the skies. The chatter of the wood ducks
to each other. The cry of the curlews, and the baby squeak-like
voices of the dab-chicks.'</p>

<p>The girl went on reciting, like a poem she had learned in
childhood.</p>

<p>'Then my grandfather&mdash;he was not so deaf in those days,
but was always a little deaf&mdash;found a new voice and
expression in these things that had yet always been familiar to
him, and a new joy.</p>

<p>'Next morning, too, this young man, as they rode behind the
cattle, drew my grandfather's attention to the sweet smell of the
crushed bush herbs as the cattle trod them down, in the early
morning air. The next night they camped at a swamp, and in the
morning when they were eating their breakfasts this young man
drew my grandfather's attention to the native-companions dancing
on the short green grass at the water's edge, in the first glad
gleams of the sun. My grandfather had never seen any beauty in it
before; he would have taken his gun and shot one of them. But
when it was pointed out to him he saw how beautiful the bush was,
and ever since then has loved it in a different wa.'</p>

<p>The men were silent, and Everett was looking down. Presently
the girl went on:</p>

<p>'Then this young man went down to live near the great basalt
wall seventy miles long, to keep back the store cattle which were
being broken in on the station, and twice a week my grandfather
used to come down to see him, and they would sit out under the
stars and talk&mdash;talk about the great basalt range, where
there was a stream of constantly flowing water that rose from no
one knew where, flowed on for many miles, then, sank, and was
known no more. And what a wonderful thing it was, this water,
coming up like this and disappearing again, whether the weather
was wet or dry, and going on thus for ever and ever!</p>

<p>'I thought in my foolish way&mdash;I see now how
foolish&mdash;that surely this young man who opened my
grandfather's eyes to the wonderful beauty of the bush was surely
still young, and, and'&mdash;the girl caught her breath with a
sob&mdash;'and so I brought grandfather to see you, the man he
knew forty years ago.'</p>

<p>'And you are disappointed?' said Everett.</p>

<p>'No,' said the girl, 'I see now how foolish I was; but it was
a great thing for grandfather to awake to beautiful things that,
he had never noticed before, and so I wanted to see what the man
was like. You are kind not to laugh at me.'</p>

<p>Neither Brown nor Everett felt much inclined to laugh. They
felt the other way. The bright, joyous description of the girl;
the wonders she had expected to find, all brought home to them
their own shattered lives.</p>

<p>'Tell me,' said the girl, appealing to Everett. 'You have
often told the same sort of beautiful things to other people that
you did to my grandfather?'</p>

<p>Everett looked down. 'Perhaps, I forgot. Perhaps, they would
not listen. I forget.'</p>

<p>'O, I am sorry, more sorry than when I found that you were not
a young man with bright eyes.'</p>

<p>'Listen, child!' said Everett, and his faded eyes looked
bright for a moment. He took the girl's face between both his
hands, and turned it up to his.</p>

<p>'Some day, I feel sure, some young man, with bright eyes will
tell you more beautiful things than I told your grandfather. And
listen, if he is what I hope he will be, then, when his hair is
as grey as mine, and yours the same, you will still see him as a
young man, with bright eyes.'</p>

<p>He stooped, and kissed the child on the forehead.</p>

<p><br>
THEY had talked to the old man, through the medium of Jessie,
and put him back in the buggy.</p>

<p>'You will come and see us,' said the little maiden, as she
waved them good-bye, and they both said they would. Then, when
the pair were gone, they looked at each other.</p>

<p>'There's too much sentiment in this world,' said Brown at
last.</p>

<p>'Too much sentiment altogether,' returned Everett. 'Come over
the road and have a drink. There's no sentiment about that.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch345"></a>34. &mdash; A HYPNOTISED DOG</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, 5 Jun 1897</h3>

<p class="first">
WHEN Fitzbrassie started trying hypnotic experiments on his
fox terrier. I told him that it was an extremely foolish thing to
do; but be was so taken up with the idea that he refused to
listen to reason. He persisted in it, and I must confess obtained
a partial success, but only partial. The dog tried his best to
follow the train of thought suggested, but his canine ideas did
not run on the same lines as his master's, so the result was
often disastrous.</p>

<p>Fitzbrassie and I shared a couple of rooms together, and at
times, like most young men of uncertain income, were pushed, to
put it mildly, for ready money. This necessitated occasional
visits to 'our uncle,'* and on several occasions Dan, the
terrier, had accompanied Fitzbrassie there; in fact, it was a
wonder that Dan had not been 'popped' sometimes. However, we were
flush at this period, and Fitzbrassie was engaged to an
exceedingly nice girl. He came home one evening with an expensive
little fancy workbox, one of those things that look well as a
present, but no one thinks of using afterwards, and they
gradually wear out through the ravages of time. This was a
present for his lady love, and he told me that before he left in
the morning he was going to hypnotise Dan and suggest to him to
carry it round there.</p>

<p class="footnote">* The pawn shop.</p>

<p>Dan was naturally a clever dog, and could fetch and carry
things against any dog. In the morning Fitz hypnotised Dan, and
informed him of his wishes. I was engaged at home that day, and
agreed to watch the progress of the experiment. After awhile I
noticed that Dan got very uneasy, and evidently troubled in his
mind. He knew Miss Romilly very well, and approved of her, for
She was kind to him, and generous in the matter of sweet
biscuits, etc. I could see that Dan was impressed with the
importance of his mission, but had not got the hang of the thing
properly.</p>

<p>Suddenly he started up with a look of relief on his face, and
trotted downstairs and into the back yard. My window commanded a
view of the yard, and I watched him go into a secret corner (as
he considered it) and unearth a savory bone that he had hidden
some weeks before; then, after his usual custom, he overed the
back gate and vanished. In about an hour he came back, dejected
and forlorn. He did not come near me; he was evidently ashamed of
himself.</p>

<p>I read the workings of his mind; he had evidently mixed up
Fitz's suggestion with his own ideas of Miss Romilly, end
understanding that he was to take her something, had selected the
most precious thing that he knew of, and carried it there. That
his gift had been received with horror and disgust, and he
himself cast forth with kicks and abuse was evident, and just as
evident was it that he was trying to sort things out and find out
what it meant. After about an hour he suddenly startled me by
leaping on the table, seizing the packet in which was the
work-box done up neatly with straps for him to hold it by, and
trotting rapidly off with it. Naturally I thought he was going to
retrieve his error, and in about another hour he returned and
came up to me wagging his tail, well pleased.</p>

<p>He had a paper in his mouth, and I took it. It was a blank
pawn ticket; on the back of it was written in pencil a message to
the owner of the dog, stating that the dog had brought a parcel
to the shop containing a lady's new work-box. The dog had taken
Miss Romilly's present to the pawn shop.</p>

<p>I took Dan and recovered the box before Fitz came home, went
round to Miss Romilly, and, without entering in full details,
explained matters. Being a very kind-hearted girl she forgave
Dan, and we agreed to keep the matter secret and leave Fitz under
the impression that everything had gone smoothly.</p>

<p>Fitzbrassie was immensely proud at the success of his
hypnotising, and put on the most unbearable frills, so much so
that I often felt inclined to tell him of the disgraceful mess
Dan had made of this suggestions. Things went on smoothly enough
until Fitz got to work again with his confounded suggestions, and
then he preserved a suspicious mystery about the affair that
foretold trouble.</p>

<p>'Wait and you'll see,' was all he would condescend to say.</p>

<p>We did see.</p>

<p><br>
THAT evening Dan was quietly sleeping in his accustomed place,
when without any warning, he suddenly sprang up, flew wildly
round the room, and bit Fitzbrassie savagely in the calf of the
leg. Then he suddenly seemed to remember himself, and wisely
slunk out of the room. Poor Fitz raved and swore frightfully, and
pulled up his trousers to look at the wound, which was a very
deep bite.</p>

<p>'What the devil have you been doing to the dog?' I asked, for
Dan was the best tempered dog in existence.</p>

<p>'I only suggested to him that when he woke up he would be a
mad dog, and rush round and bite people.'</p>

<p>'By Jove, old man,' I said, smothering my laughter, 'this is
serious; you must go to a doctor and get the wound cauterised at
once, if you don't want to die of hydrophobia.'</p>

<p>'Great Scott! do you think so?'</p>

<p>'I do indeed. If the dog was hypnotised into believing he was
mad, he was actually mad while the illusion lasted, and his bite
would be just as dangerous as the bite of a real mad dog. I'm
sorry for you, old man, for its the most agonising form of death
to die.'</p>

<p>Fitz limped off to a doctor, as white as a sheet; in fact, I
had to go with him. The doctor, who knew us, looked very grave,
and backed up my view of the case, but he said he would not
proceed to extreme measures, such as cutting the leg off at once.
He told me privately that the wound was a clean one, and that
there was no danger, but it was as well to give Fitz a
fright.</p>

<p><br>
FOR days afterwards Fitzbrassie used to go to his bath in fear
and trembling, for he had heard that one of the symptoms of
hydrophobia was an insane dread of water. He also was continually
finding that his jaw did not work properly, and was certain that
lockjaw was setting in.</p>

<p>He made me a present of Dan when he recovered from his fright,
and you may he sure that I never try hypnotic experiments on the
dog.</p>

<h2><a id="ch35"></a>35. &mdash; IN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney,  25 Feb and 18 Mar 1899</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THE filmy vapor that had enveloped us so long gradually
cleared away. Lifting slowly, it developed a pageant of scenery
which none of us expected to see&mdash;if, in point of fact we
had ever expected to see anything again&mdash;for from the time
we were precipitated out of the car of the balloon from the
unfortunate and unforeseen collision with the top of an iceberg,
we had been enveloped in what seemed a freezing, blinding fog.
True, some part of the time we had been semi-unconscious, and not
able to exactly realise our position, but mostly, when we came
partly to our senses, we saw nothing around us but stifling fog
or mist.</p>

<p>Now it cleared off, and before us we saw a country,
beautifully green, mellow-tinted, and lovely, lying on the verge
of a frozen sea. The frozen sea that we ourselves were lying on
bereft of our means of locomotion and without food or anything.
The lifting of the mist seemed to create a different climate, and
my two companions, like myself, sat up and gazed around.</p>

<p>'It is a civilised country,' said Gotthelm. 'Look at the
houses and gardens. But God in heaven! how can there be gardens'
here in the Arctic circle?'</p>

<p>'It is only a dream before death,' said Heimrich, the Swede,
and he laid himself down on the ice again to die.</p>

<p>'It is a reality and a fact!' I exclaimed, having risen to my
feet, and assured myself that the prospect was actual. As I spoke
the mist&mdash;the cold, moist mist&mdash;swooped down again and
blotted out all that we had been gazing at.</p>

<p>'Ach! It is but death and dream!' repeated Heimrich.</p>

<p>But now, through the blinding, suffocating folds of the
enwrapping fog came the sound of bells. Bells so welcome in their
sounds that they seemed to have been welded out of silver and
gold. Bells that came nearer and nearer, as though hastening to
our deliverance. And they were, too, for out of the misty
surroundings came a voice&mdash;a human voice&mdash;evidently
calling on us to show our whereabouts. I could not understand
what was said; but I shouted in reply, and soon I heard the
ringing sound of skates and sleighs coming towards us.</p>

<p>Again the mist lifted, and close to us was a party consisting
of men and women clad in furs. Tall, handsome, and comely; no
squat-shaped Esquimaux. They came quickly up, and Gotthelm and
Heimrich got on their feet, and stared wonderingly at our
rescuers. Rescuers without doubt they were, for we were bereft
outcasts, on a frozen ice floe; and now suddenly we were
surrounded by a crowd of human beings, evidently friendly
disposed, and evidently anxious to succor and comfort us. And in
all appearance these people were of our own kind, and permeated
with the same sympathetic thrills that worked in our own
organisations. And, above all, they were tall and fair. From such
a people we could expect nothing but kindness, and we found
it.</p>

<p><br>
OUR balloon had long ago gone out of sight and direction. The
collision against the crest of the iceberg, and the fall from
that height, had so stunned and confused us that what had become
of the machine was a hopeless puzzle. I, Dr. Germain, know that
the most beautiful woman I ever saw or dreamt of pushed forward
through the crowd and put to my lips a cordial that penetrated
all my senses, and restored health and vigor to each. In a short
space my companions were likewise invigorated, and then suddenly
the mist closed down again, and all was blank, only that through
the obscurity I felt the touch, of that hand resting on my
shoulder, and felt that I was safe until the coming lights dawned
once more.</p>

<p>It was some time before the mist rose once again and things
were clear. One, who seemed to be the leader, gave some orders,
and then we were helped into sleighs, and went quickly spinning
across the ice towards the beautiful country we had seen on the
margin of the frozen sea. Now commences the first, series of our
adventures amongst the people who inhabit the innermost confines
of the frozen Arctic circle&mdash;the circle wherein the heat
necessary for human life is maintained by the strange
precipitation of the mist accumulated in the tropics, and carried
to the arctic circle during nine months in the year by the
constant current of the south-east trades, which blow throughout
the southern hemisphere for that period.</p>

<p>When we started on our balloon voyage we never calculated upon
any southern wind-currents affecting us, yet, strange to say,
these very currents, acting upon an upper strata of air, had
borne us to a destination that we had despaired of reaching. Now
it had landed us, thanks to an unhappy contact with the iceberg,
amongst the most wonderful and curious race of people in the
world, as yet unknown to the rest of humanity.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
AS soon as we reached the land, and were helped out of the
sledges and conveyed to a large house, we were fed with strange
food, amongst which, however, I easily recognised bear's flesh,
and given a warm, sweet drink of some sort which made us all
drowsy. We were shown skins to lie on, and left to ourselves.</p>

<p>Gottheim muttered, 'It's a dream, it's a dream!' Then he was
asleep, and directly afterwards Heimrich was the same. I stayed
awake a little longer pondering on our position, and, while
thankful for our marvellous rescue, half regretful that I could
see no chance now of our ever returning with the tale of our
wonderful discovery wherewith to astonish the world, and so
thinking I, too, lost consciousness.</p>

<p>We were awakened by a gentle voice asking us something in a
soft, strange tongue, and opened our eyes easily, showing that we
must have slept a long time, and were now thoroughly rested. The
room must have been lit by artificial light, though I could not
then detect its source, but it was a beautiful soft, mellow
light, that did not hurt the eyes, and yet made everything almost
as clear and distinct as by day. Over us stood the same splendid
woman who had appeared to us through the fog like an angel of
succor. She was tall, like all her race, and fair-haired, as the
others were also.</p>

<p>But her face was the face of one of the fairest of our own
women of northern Europe. By her gestures she indicated to us to
rise and go into another room, where we found suits of skin ready
for us to change our stiff and dirty clothes, and means to wash
our dirt encrusted skins. Everywhere was that soft glow of
warmth, and everywhere that beautiful light.</p>

<p>Washed, refreshed, and experiencing a strange feeling of rest
and safety, we ventured to endeavor to find our way out, and by
good luck came e to the very room in which our hosts were. There
we found the woman who had come to our rescue with the party, the
man who had been the leader, and an old man we had not seen
before. All rose and welcomed us in dumb show, and never did I
see such a stately trio; and it seemed to me that the venerable
white-bearded old man was not the least distinguished of the
party.</p>

<p>Heimrich, who was a celebrated linguist, tried several of the
northern dialects in which to address our hosts, but for a long
time without avail. At last, however, he struck upon a phrase or
word at which they all started. Eagerly the man spoke a word in
reply, to which Heimrich responded, and then a strange thing
happened.</p>

<p>A glow and fire suddenly shone in Heimrich's face, and, as one
inspired, he stepped forward and began a kind of chant in a
strange tongue that I never heard before. But for all that, the
language sounded bold and stirring. The three people of the
Arctic Circle listened, entranced, the old man especially. He
stood forward, staring at Heimrich as if he saw a spirit from the
dead. At last the chant stopped, and then in his turn the old man
commenced what seemed to be a reply. It was certainly in the same
mysterious language, and had the same swing or rhythm. In turn he
ceased, and we all stood amazed.</p>

<p>'Where on earth did you get that performance?' growled
Gottheim, as the Arctic people stood eagerly talking
together.</p>

<p>'It suddenly came to me. It is an ancient rune, a saga; I
learnt it from an old nurse, and have scarcely thought of it
since.'</p>

<p>The old man advanced, and endeavored to communicate with.
Heimrich, but it was a disappointment.</p>

<p>'Never mind,' said Heimrich, 'before a week is out I shall be
able to talk with them.'</p>

<p><br>
I NEED not go into further detail about our life for the next
few days. While Heimrich studied with the old man, Gottheim and I
wandered about the town, or rather scattered settlement, and saw
what we could of it. Everywhere we found the people courteous,
kind, and attentive. They, were curious, but not obtrusive in any
way. I wondered they showed as little curiosity as they did,
until I found out the reason. Our two younger hosts, brother and
sister, whose names I may as well say at once were Signy, the
man's name, and Sinjof, the woman's, insisted on accompanying us
everywhere, lest we went astray in one of the mists that kept
descending during these summer months.</p>

<p>One day they led us away from the abodes of the people, and
took-Tis to a place where there was an immense ice floe. As yet
we could not speak to each other, but they silently pointed to
some object in the ice. Gotthelm looked first, and started back
with an exclamation of astonishment. I looked, and what did I
see?</p>

<p>In the ice lay entombed and preserved the bodies of two men.
Europeans, and European sailors, in the dress of at least three
centuries ago. Probably they had died two thousand leagues or
more away, and had been carried in their icy shroud into the
region we now were in by the set of some current, which has done
the same with wreckage. Every detail was plain and perceptible,
and their faces were calm, placid, and peaceful. It was wonderful
to look at these survivals of a bygone century, of the days when
men went out to dare the elements in their tiny cockleshells as
confidently as we now start in a modern steam whaler.</p>

<p>Who could they have been? Two of the mutineers who put Hudson
adrift to find an unknown grave, or members of the crew of some
vessel of discovery, whose name has been lost?</p>

<p>Afterwards I learned that this strange sepulchre had gradually
come into view about fifty years before our coming, and that was
the reason, that and their traditions, why so little surprise had
been expressed at our appearance.</p>

<p>The fertility of this region during the summer months is
wonderful. The mists, which keep being precipitated through the
coming of the warm southern winds into the Arctic Circle,
encourage the rapid growths peculiar to the country. These mostly
consist of lichens and mosses and a few low bushes, nearly all
tasty and edible. Trees there are none.</p>

<p>For building material, the people use clay, and with it make
substantial bricks of a larger size than ours. Iron abounds, and
they understand the working of the ore, and the higher parts of
the country are covered with quantities of mica, of a size not
equalled in any other part of the world. Gold may probably be
also present, but this I did not look for, and the inhabitants,
of Giukings, to give them their proper name, seemed to know
nothing of it. The mica is used by them as we use glass, and
affords an admirable material for the illuminating apparatus that
they use.</p>

<p>In the open sea that surrounds the North Pole, seals, whales,
etc., abound, for it is never frozen over, the fringe of ice upon
which we fell, only extends from the land about one-hundred
miles; it was lucky for us that we did not fall into the open
sea, instead of striking against the frozen berg, imbedded in the
ice tract. There are also hot lakes on the land, the presence of
which helps to raise the temperature of the country. Bears
frequent the district, and are caught in traps and pits.</p>

<p>When I spoke of summer and winter, I should have said night
and day, for the climate is always the same. The sun appears in
summer, but it affords no heat, and the Giukings only know the
difference in the year by the six months day, and six months
night. This knowledge, of course, obtained during my stay there.
All fuel and light are easily supplied by the immense supply of
oil they can so easily obtain.</p>

<p><br>
IN about a week, Heimrich had mastered the language
sufficiently to be able to glean the history of this Arctic race
as known to them by their own traditions. Originally they must
have come from Sweden; driven north in the earlier days by
constant warfare; they had been harassed from island to island,
until, to escape the desolation into which they had been hunted,
they took to the open sea in what galleys they had left. What
followed is not known. They must have got into a warm current,
which carried them&mdash;alive, but nearly starving and
unconscious&mdash;away north through some passage in the eternal
ice into the warmer region and open sea of the North Pole.</p>

<p>There is a legend that one man of heroic build and mind, named
Lyngi, kept them all in heart, and never quailed, but predicted
that they would yet come to a land whereon they could live and
thrive. And his words proved true, for at last they came to the
land we were then in, and this Lyngi made laws for them, and made
them vow to keep them. This was the tradition of the origin of
the Giukings.</p>

<p>Naturally Heimrich, from being able to talk with them, held
the highest place in the estimation of these people; and
gradually a desire to return settled down heavily upon our
hearts. The stagnant color of the country afflicted us There was
never anything happened to disturb the peaceful quiet of the
place. Even atmospherical disturbances were rare; and above all,
the regular rising and falling of the mist which was the life of
the place made us feel like the men who sailed with Maeldune:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
And round it we went, and thro' it,<br>

but never a murmur, a breath&mdash;<br>

It was all of it fair as life,<br>

it was all of it quiet as death,<br>

And we hated the beautiful Isle,<br>

for whenever we strove to speak<br>

Our voices were thinner and fainter<br>

than any flitter-mouse shriek.</p>

<p><br>
SIGNY saw our dissatisfaction, and strove to entertain us by
inviting us to make long excursions to different points of
interest, for now the last months of day were setting in, and
Gotthelm and I dreaded the thought of six months' darkness
amongst these people, who, though kind and hospitable, had, from
the very circumstances surrounding them, and in which they lived,
a certain nerveless apathy that was inexpressibly wearying to our
quicker and more active blood, fresh from the living world.</p>

<p>All the people were the same&mdash;tall, handsome, kind, and
awfully monotonous. Even the trapping and fishing were done in a
calm, methodical, and unsportsmanlike manner. The only touch of
real excitement I had seen amongst any of them was in the old
man, Signy's father, when Heimrich recited the ancient Rune or
Edda. As for Heimrich, he was content. The beautiful Sinjof had
won his heart, and he, I thought, had won hers.</p>

<p>Signy proposed to us one day, through Heimrich, that we should
go and see one of the hot lakes some distance away, and we
agreed. There were many rises to cross, some covered with iron
ore outcrops, and the glistening sheets of mica sticking up from
the ground. At last we approached our destination, and reached
the crest of the low ridge that overlooked the depression where
lay the hot lake. What was the sight that at once made us stop
and exclaim with surprise and joy? There was our
balloon&mdash;captive, anchored by the trailing grapnel that had
become detached when we were thrown from the car.</p>

<p>Next moment we were bounding down the slope, visions of the
world before us. We could only make the balloon more secure, and
await assistance which Signy went for. Then we managed to haul it
down, so that Gotthelm was able to get into the car and examine
the contents. So well had our arrangements been made, and so
admirably had everything been stowed, that nothing had been
injured nor displaced.</p>

<p>We managed to tow the balloon back to the main cluster of
buildings, and there made it secure and fast. Next day we
examined the machine thoroughly, and decided that it was as safe
as ever; and our hopes of home rose high, as we commenced to make
our preparations.</p>

<p>Our trouble now was Heimrich. Would he accompany us, or would
he remain and cast in his lot with this strange Arctic race for
the love of Sinjof? He looked troubled and distressed; but
neither Gotthelm nor myself strove to influence him by a single
word. It was a case where a man has to decide for himself. Sinjof
herself seemed more troubled than I should have expected from one
of her placid race.</p>

<p>But there was more fire than I dreamt of in the nature of the
Giukings, only circumstances never arose to bring it to the
surface. Time drew on, and the last day of light had come, and we
were ready to go. From the old man we learned that at that period
there was generally a good wind, and as from our position on the
globe it scarcely mattered in what direction it blew, we chose
that day for our departure. What had passed between Heimrich and
Sinjof I know not, but now I believe that he promised her that he
would stay.</p>

<p>I looked around before we took our places, and saw that dusk
was rapidly shutting everything out of view. Gottheim and I had
taken our places, and Heimrich was to follow&mdash;that is, if he
was coming or not. Signy had been instructed how to release the
last rope if Heimrich intended to stay. Heimrich stood,
uncertain, and Sinjof stood by his side. I pitied the man, on one
side the chance of returning to the world; on the other a
beautiful woman of another race and stagnation for life.</p>

<p>'Are you coming?' said Gottheim, for the gloom was fast
gathering. Heimrich stooped, and released the last rope. At the
same moment Sinjof sprang forward with a knife in her hand, and
seized the rope with the other strong hand. The balloon shot up
suddenly carrying them both off the ground, and at the same
moment the blackness of utter darkness shut down on us. Then the
balloon made another jump, and we heard a thud&mdash;the thud of
two bodies striking the ground. Next the wind caught us, and all
was blackness and deep silence. Gottheim clasped my hand, and I
returned the pressure&mdash;that was all we could do at the
moment. What had happened?</p>

<p>Thinking it over, I believe that Heimrich was going to stay;
but that Sinjof mistook his action in going to release the rope,
and rushed forward with a knife to cut it, and both clutching it,
they were jerked off their feet Heimrich must have lost his
presence of mind, and held on, and Sinjof must have cut the rope.
But how high did the balloon carry them before that happened?
That we shall never know.</p>

<p><br>
THE cold increased, and we crawled into the lower compartment
of the car and closed the trap. At times one of us would strike a
match to read the barometer, otherwise we were silent. From the
gauge and compass we seemed to be travelling south at a high rate
of speed before a high but steady wind, which, of course, we
could not feel in any way. It was an awful time to have to lie
quiet knowing we were being carried swiftly through a pitch-dark
void, we knew not where.</p>

<p>Once Gottheim aroused me. At the bottom of the lower
compartment a port hole of thick glass was let in. Looking
through this, we saw what seemed like a lake of seething fire far
below us. We were passing over the crater of an active volcano.
It was gone like a flash. Without referring to my journal, I
cannot say what number of days we thus remained in darkness
awaiting our fate; but at last Gottheim, putting his head out of
the trap in his turn, pulled it back, and said in a tone of joy,
'It is growing light.'</p>

<p>When light came we were looking down on a sea of clouds; but
dropping below them we saw&mdash;beneath us the pine forests and
green, fields of Norway.</p>

<p>We were saved.</p>

<h2><a id="ch36"></a>36. &mdash; TOMMY'S FALL</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 26 May 1900</h3>

<p class="first">
TOMMY was excessively fond of argument and whisky: therefore
for the super of the station to dispatch him to the township with
a packhorse to bring up some whisky with which to celebrate the
Relief of Ladysmith was a stance of rash and hasty
confidence.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, from the conjunction of certain untoward
circumstances, there was no one else to send, and Tommy departed
with many fervent protestations of good behavior if he was only
trusted this once. Tommy fell, of course. He got to the township
right enough; he withstood the temptations it held forth; he
started away full of self-satisfied virtue and pride at his
rectitude, and, of course, this feeling preceded a fall.</p>

<p>The fall was bad, and owed its origin to a friend, a common
cause of falls. The friend was a Scotchman, and lived in a small
abode on the outskirts of the scattered township. The friend was
also a shoemaker, and as argumentative as Tommy was, Tommy had to
call at his place for a pair of boots, and he got off his horse
and tied him up in company with the pack-horse to a convenient
sapling, then went inside.</p>

<p>He sat down and entered into conversation with his
friend&mdash;into argument rather, for argument was the one joy
of Tommy's monotonous life. Then the Devil entered into Tommy,
and suggested that argument was dry work, and outside on the
pack-horse were six bottles of whisky neatly and safely packed in
their straw envelopes. Surely one could be broken accidentally.
Tommy listened to the Devil's suggestion, and one was broached.
This inspired the Scotch shoemaker, who launched himself out on
his favorite theme of Shakespeare being in reality a Scotchman.
This Tommy controverted with all the eloquence at his command,
and as their eloquence increased in proportion to the decrease in
the whisky bottle, it became absolutely necessary to broach
another bottle. This was done, and thenceforth oblivion.</p>

<p>Tommy awoke to darkness, and a loss of identity. He got up and
moved about, and immediately fell over somebody, who was asleep
on the floor, and muttered strange Scotch oaths at being
disturbed. Tommy got a match from his pouch, and managed to
strike it? On the floor lay his host; and his pack bags and
saddles were placed neatly enough against the slab-wall; but from
their appearance they were evidently not so bulky as they should
be. Tommy sat down in the dark and meditated with a troubled
mind.</p>

<p>Could he and the Scotchman have possibly polished off the
whole of the consignment of whisky? And where were his horses?
And who had unpacked and unsaddled his horses? He had no idea of
having done it.</p>

<p>'Duncan!' he cried, in desperation; 'wake up, man!'</p>

<p>After much calling Duncan woke up, growling at people who
could not sleep their liquor off like gentlemen. He informed
Tommy that when he (Tommy) became vanquished in argument, and
prostrate with liquor, Duncan had unsaddled his horses, and
hobbled them out on the bank of the neighboring creek, where
there was very fair feed. That afterwards a friend or two had
dropped in, and had just a drappie in both eyes.</p>

<p>Duncan lit a kerosene lamp, and Tommy, who was very shaky,
asked If there wasn't any whisky left. Duncan opined that there
might be a couple of bottles still left, but it was useless to
think of going back to the station with such a small cargo. Tommy
took a nip out of one of the bottles to steady his nerves, and
Duncan took one to keep him company. Duncan, it may be added, was
whisky-proof, and unfortunately thought that everybody else was
the same, hence the deadliness of his friendship. Deliberation
led to nothing. Neither had sufficient credit, nor anything else,
to get a fresh supply, and no sufficiently valid excuse could be
found to account for the disappearance of six bottles of
whisky.</p>

<p>'I've got it!' suddenly exclaimed Duncan. 'The packhorse
bucked everything off! There; I give you the idea for
nothing.'</p>

<p>'Pretty idea, too!' said Tommy, scornfully, 'Why, old Dozey,
the packhorse, wouldn't buck if you put a crate of fireworks on
top of him and set them going.'</p>

<p>'Well, think of something else,' said Duncan, in a lordly
manner, helping himself to another nip.</p>

<p>'All very well for you to say "Think of something else,"'
sneered Tommy; 'but you don't have to suffer, and I have, and you
had more than your share of the whisky.'</p>

<p>Duncan rose in his wrath, a gaunt, red-headed phantom.</p>

<p>'A gentleman who says that another gentleman has had more than
his share of the whisky is no gentleman, Leave my house!'</p>

<p>'Wish I had never come in it!' said Tommy. 'Where are the
boots?'</p>

<p>'The boots are not mended yet, and I will not deliver them to
a drunken blackguard who cannot take six bottles of whisky home
safely.'</p>

<p>Tommy stared aghast at this heartless retort, but Duncan was
twice his size, so he opened the door and stepped out into the
dim light of a just risen moon in its last quarter. He took his
saddle and packsaddle outside, sternly watched by Duncan, who sat
with one hand round the broached whisky-bottle. Then Tommy took
the one still intact, and reached for the other.</p>

<p>'The face of him!' said Duncan, somewhat vaguely; 'would take
a man's bottle of whisky out of his house before his very face,
after partaking of his hospitality all the night, and me putting
up with his profligate goings on. Leave my house!'</p>

<p>Tommy left. After all, it made no difference; he was bound to
get in for it. Duncan slammed the door after him, and Tommy,
picking up his bridle and halter, strolled down to the creek to
see if he could find his horses, first planting the bottle of
whisky.</p>

<p><br>
A WAGGON was standing at the creek&mdash;a loaded waggon.
Tommy looked about and underneath; but there was no one sleeping
there. Evidently the teamster and his mate had gone up to the
township, after turning their horses out, and seemingly had gone
to sleep there.</p>

<p>Again the devil entered into Tommy, and he examined the
loading with the practised eye of a station hand, who had loaded
many drays and waggons, Some people had a detestable habit of
sending up cases of whisky concealed in drapery and other goods;
but here there was no deception&mdash;a case of spirits stood in
a most handy and convenient manner, and Tommy&mdash;still
listening to the voice of the tempter&mdash;took it down and
carried it off. Guessing his horses would have joined the
carriers', he went down to them, guided by the bells, and found
them feeding there.</p>

<p>After saddling them, he got Duncan's wood-axe and opened the
case. Rapidly he put the bottles in the pack-bags in their straw
envelopes, and filled with a feeling of making righteous
restitution for his slip from rectitude, he took the whole dozen
instead of six. Then a desire for revenge on his false friend
took possession of him, and he carried the empty case up to
Duncan's and deposited it, together with the incriminating
wood-axe, outside the door, Then he opened the door and looked
in.</p>

<p>Duncan had fallen asleep, with his hand still grasping the
whisky bottle, and Tommy, with a slight feeling of remorse,
extinguished the lamp and left. He had thirteen full bottles with
him Instead of six, and upon Duncan would the blame fall.</p>

<p><br>
IT was about 10 o'clock in the morning when Tommy reached the
station, Grey's (the Super.) guests had arrived, and he was
looking anxiously out for Tommy's arrival. Tommy had helped
himself liberally along the road to the one bottle of whisky
saved put of the first consignment, and was in a condition which
prevented him from inventing an excuse to account for the
presence of twelve bottles of whisky instead of six. He had the
sense to plant the extra bottle at the slip-rails, and then,
pulling himself together, rode up to the store.</p>

<p>'How is it you were not home last night?'</p>

<p>'Horse get away, and I didn't get him again till after dark.
Everything's all right, sir.'</p>

<p>Grey went forward, and carefully unhooked the bags, for Tommy
seemed incapable, of doing anything but smile. There was a pause,
then said Grey:</p>

<p>'I sent you in for half a dozen of whisky, and you bring me
back a dozen of three star pale brandy. How's that?'</p>

<p>A brilliant idea shot through Tommy's bemuzzed brain.</p>

<p>'Mr. Kirkbutt' (the publican) 'said as how he was so delighted
at the Relief of Ladysmith that he hoped you'd accept the extra
half-dozen as a present from him, just in honor of the
occasion.'</p>

<p>Grey stared at him, speechless.</p>

<p>'Fact, sir,' said Tommy.</p>

<p>'Well, I'm blessed,' said Grey. 'Brown!' he called out to the
owner of the next station, who was one of his guests. 'Just come
here, and listen to this.'</p>

<p>Brown came over, and Tommy had to repeat his message.</p>

<p>'Meet extraordinary. However, we'd better swamp it before he
repents of his generosity. By the way, Tommy, did you see
anything of my team; it ought to be at the township by this time?
I have a case of three-star on board. I hope that old Kirkbutt
has not been shaking it.'</p>

<p>Tommy laughed feebly, and effaced himself.</p>

<p><br>
OVER the extraordinary complications that followed Tommy's
exploit a veil must be drawn. Duncan got locked up, and has ever
since been seeking to get Tommy in a quiet place alone. Kirkbutt
repudiated the very idea of such generosity, and wanted Grey to
pay him for the case of brandy. But the maddest man of all was
Brown when he found he had been invited to make merry with his
own purloined liquor.</p>

<h2><a id="ch37"></a>37. &mdash; THE LOST TRIBE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney,  12 and 19 May 1900</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
JACK WILLS crouched shivering over a small fire of sticks,
thanking whatever gods that he acknowledged that it was about the
time of breaking day. He had spent a miserably cold night, mostly
occupied in collecting sticks to keep his fire alight, and
crouching over it with his sodden saddlecloth over his shoulders,
for it was an open, almost treeless, country on which he was
camped, and the southeast wind which sprang up a little before
daylight was bleak and penetrating. 'Enough to freeze the tail
off a brass monkey,' as he shiveringly remarked to himself. The
stars overhead were bright, but, over those lying low above the
east a horizon was already stealing the paling light of coming
dawn.</p>

<p>Jack rose from his crouching position, and looked around and
listened for any sound of his horse, but the light was not yet
strong enough, and all was silence.</p>

<p>'Nice go if old Dingo has cleared out, and left me. Pretty
walk home I shall have,' he went on, talking to himself after the
manner of solitary men.</p>

<p>It was on an inland station in the Northern Territory, on the
boundless downs country of the northern tableland, and although
in the tropics; the winter nights and winter night winds are
bitterly keen there, Jack had not intended to camp out when he
left the station; but he came on the fresh tracks of two horses,
which he took to be two that had been missing for some time, and
he followed them up, expecting every hour to catch sight of them,
until, darkness falling, he camped on the track without food,
water, or blankets. This, however, is a common enough experience
to men living in outside country, and Jack was used to it. The
only thing that troubled him was that he was in a portion of the
run which was generally considered dry, and consequently unused,
and he was puzzling his brains where these two horses, whose
tracks he was following, got water.</p>

<p>'Can't be far ahead, at any rate. Now where the deuce is
Dingo?'</p>

<p>The light broke suddenly, as it does in low latitudes, and
revealed the wide, sloping downs, with here and there a group of
<i>bauhinia</i> trees, or cork trees. Jack heaved a sigh of
relief as he distinguished his horse in the shelter of one of the
<i>bauhinias</i>.</p>

<p>'Old Dingo's had sense to get a breakwind; trust him for
that,' he said, as he shouldered his saddle, and walked towards
where the horse was standing.</p>

<p>'Cold, old fellow!' he went on, as he stooped and undid the
stirrup leather with which he had hobbled his steed the night
before. Dingo looked decidedly cold; his coat was rough, and he
had a tucked up appearance, and horse and rider were both glad to
get away on the tracks.</p>

<p><br>
THE sun was just rising as they reached the crest of a swell
on the rolling downs they were riding over; and beyond there was
a wide prospect. Jack pulled up and looked eagerly about in hopes
of seeing some indication of water or the missing horses,
otherwise it would mean going back through a long day
empty-handed and hungry on a tired and thirsty horse.</p>

<p>What he saw did not encourage him, for at the bottom of the
slope, though there was certainly timber, it had more the
appearance of the desert timber than the timber bordering a
creek. Jack knew well how in that country rich rolling downs
suddenly meet the desert forest without any warning, and he shook
his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sun sprang above the horizon with the peculiar
jump so strangely distinctive of tropical latitudes. It made a
globe of red fire before him.</p>

<p>If it was a creek ahead of him, well and good; if not, why,
that it was only a belt, and beyond was open country. A belt
meant a watercourse, a creek. A creek of whose existence they as
yet, on the station, knew nothing. If there was water in this
creek ahead of him, well and good, if not, why, as it was two or
three miles ahead, it might mean knocking up his horse and
himself. But Jack Wills was not the man to hesitate when there
was an unknown creek before him, and horses' tracks leading
towards it. He drew his belt a hole tighter, for his stomach was
beginning to feel very empty, then jogged slowly down the slope,
still following the tracks.</p>

<p>The sunlight was now strong, and he saw that the timber was
alive with corellas and other birds, and the morning wind caused
his horse to sniff eagerly, for he scented water. The creek,
when the pair reached it, turned out to be large and
well-defined, with some good waterholes in it, but where it came
from or where it went to. Jack, a good bushman, could not
conjecture. He knew of no creek about this part into which the
strange watercourse could possibly run.</p>

<p>While looking around him after giving his horse a drink and
having on himself, a bustard walked past a short distance away,
with that sublime indifference to danger which characterises
birds unaccustomed to hunters. Jack drew his revolver and, by a
lucky shot, brought him down. There was a good meal to hand, and
letting his horse go and feed, he set to work making a fire, and
when that was started fell to and plucked the bird. In about an
hour's time Jack and his horse felt warm, and well fed, and fit
to investigate any number of mysterious, creeks.</p>

<p>Wills cooked the remainder of the turkey and put it into his
saddle pouch against future contingencies, then started down the
creek. As he turned the first bend Dingo gave a whinny of
greeting, and there were the two missing horses looking by no
means glad to see their old mate with a rider on his back. Jack
meditated whether to turn back or not. He had tracked up the two
horses that had been missing for so long, and found a
well-watered creek not known before, which would greatly enhance
the value of the run.. Was that not enough honor and glory for
one trip?</p>

<p>Jack thought that somehow he had a vested right to the creek
which he had found, and no one else must find out the mystery of
its being but himself. He had the remains of the turkey, two
fresh horses, and water. He determined to stay and investigate.
The horses were quiet, and Jack caught one and removed the saddle
from Dingo's back, much to the animal's selfish relief and put it
on the fresh horse, much to that quadruped's disgust It is not
pleasant when you are grazing in undisturbed freedom, in an
equine paradise to suddenly come under the thraldom of girths and
saddle once more.</p>

<p>However, habit is everything, and the fresh horse submitted
quietly, and Jack mounted and changed his course, having
determined to follow the creek up instead of down. He would see
where it came from first, and then where it went to.</p>

<p><br>
THE process of finding out where it came from did not occupy
more than an hour or so. The creek was formed by a sudden
breakaway, at the junction of several dry channels, down which in
wet weather a good deal of water would run, and uniting their
forces they had cut out a creek and made several., permanent
waterholes, which had induced the growth of timber. The dry
channels terminated in blue bush flats, which in their turn
probably died out.</p>

<p>Jack did not follow them up to see; he knew that sort of
country by heart. He turned back and rode to where he had left
the horses, wondering much at seeing no signs of natives,
particularly in such a good game country. Arrived at the horses,
he ate a portion of his broiled turkey and continued his course
down the creek. It still retained its denned character for some
miles, and then unexpectedly broadened out into a flat, on which
its course was untraceable.</p>

<p>On a bare part of this flat Jack saw a collection of white
objects, and rode over to see what they were. On the flat lay
thirty or forty bleached skeletons of all sizes. Not perfect, but
as though the wild dogs had been busy with them, for the skulls
and the bones of the feet and of the hands had been dragged from
the body bones and lay about in grinning confusion.</p>

<p>At first Jack thought he had stumbled on a native burying
ground, but a short examination soon convinced him that this was
not the case. The blacks had died, or been killed there, for the
remains were of all sizes, and must have been of men, women, and
children. It must have been long, long years since the tragedy
happened, for the bones were clean, and there were no signs of a
camp left, nor tools, nor weapons. On the bare ground they lay,
why bare of grass Jack couldn't tell. But it was bare, as though
banned and cursed, while outside the damned circle there was
luxuriant and beautiful grass.</p>

<p>Jack dismounted, and walked amongst the bones. Instinctively
he looked at the skulls for bullet holes, but naturally found
none.</p>

<p>This massacre must have been a tribal affair, long before the
whites came to the country, which had not been settled many
years. It was a little tribe inhabiting this oasis of a creek,
and they had all been killed by some revengeful foe. And since
they had been slaughtered the creek had been unvisited by human
beings, black or white, until his coming. He went back pondering
on these things, and as it was now late, and he still had some
turkey left, he determined to camp there that night and start
home with the recovered horses early in the morning. He managed
to replenish his larder by shooting a black duck before sundown;
and pulling himself an ample bed of grass, and making up a
comfortable fire, he fell asleep soon after dark.</p>

<p><br>
HE awoke suddenly, and when he had got his eyes properly open,
he saw, to his amazement, that it was a bright full moon, which,
considering that it should have been only in its first quarter,
was rather a surprising circumstance. There were no signs of a
fire, no signs of his horses, no signs of anything, save that
down the creek, in the direction of the bones, came the
monotonous chant of a blackfellows' corroboree.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
JACK WILLS almost mechanically went down the creek in the
direction of the corroboree chant. When in sight of the fires he
naturally approached with caution, and managed to obtain a
position whence he could survey the whole scene. He had a dim
idea that the whole proceeding was irregular, and that he must be
dreaming, but the notion was not strong enough to arouse him; he
simply, gave himself up to a vague sense of wonder, and watched
the proceedings.</p>

<p>These differed in no way from the many corroborees that Jack
had seen before. Some dozen young bucks were engaged in the
stamping-about business, and a few gins were seated around
keeping up the chorus and tending the fires; further round the
circle were the old men and boys, and the remainder of the little
tribe. Jack watched them for some time, and all the dim notion of
it being a dream vanished before the regular thud of the dancers'
feet and the chants of the gins, accompanied by their rhythmic.
beating of two sticks together.</p>

<p>Presently Jack became conscious that other forms were about.
Stealthily they glided past him, so close that he could have
touched them; but, for all that, these creeping, gliding phantoms
took no notice whatever of him. Jack knew what was about to
happen, and strove to alarm the guileless party who were unaware
of the sudden death creeping closely and surely around them; but
his tongue refused to second his will, and in spite of all his
efforts he could not utter a sound.</p>

<p>Then a signal cry was heard, and the air was thick with
whizzing spears and hurtling boomerangs and clubs. All the
dancers fell at once, and the attacking party rushed in and
commenced to slaughter the old women and children. Jack's horror
at the scene was agonising, but his limbs seemed rooted to the
ground, and he was unable to move. Gradually the moaning and
groaning of the victims died down, and the work of murder was
complete, all being apparently dead save some young gins, who had
been left alive as captives. The attacking party made up the
fires, dragged aside the dead bodies which were in their way,
and, surrounded by the victims of the raid, commenced a hideous
corroboree of triumph, the captured gins having to furnish the
accompaniment.</p>

<p>While this horrible revel was going on, Jack, the unseen
witness, saw a movement amongst the bodies, and an attenuated old
gin arose and staggered forth amongst the dancers. Covered with
blood and wounds, she stood swaying about, and, in a shrieking
voice, addressed her enemies in what, to the affrighted listener,
was an unknown tongue. She stretched her thin arm out at them in
denunciation, and, even in the act, fell dead at their feet. The
blacks seemed scarcely to heed the frenzied outcries of the dying
old woman, but tossed her body aside, and went on with their
corroboree. The moon was sinking, and daylight evidently drawing
hear, when they stopped, and making up the fires lay down beside
and around them, and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>Jack still felt bound by the strange feeling of inaction that
he could not overcome, and could only wait and watch. As the moon
sank low, and the air grew chill with the breath of the coming
morning, he saw one of the captured gins arise. She looked round
the sleeping camp, and aroused the others&mdash;five in all. Jack
expected to see them steal away, but that was not their
intention. Securing the weapons of their captors, they began to
use them with deadly effect on the sleepers.</p>

<p>Just before dawn blacks sleep like the dead, and when the dawn
finally broke only the five gins stood alive in that
slaughter-place. Then they broke into wild crying and wailing,
and Jack, relieved from the strange feeling of restraint, stole
back to his camp, where, overcome with fatigue, he fell into a
deep sleep.</p>

<p>How long his sleep lasted he knew not, but when he awoke it
was again night, and, as before, there was no sign or trace of
his horses, and the camp seemed unfamiliar. He could see a fire
down the creek, and he went towards it. Crouched over it were
five old, withered figures, wailing and crooning to themselves as
they fed the fire with sticks.</p>

<p>Jack Wills approached, and spoke to these ancient witches; but
his voice seemingly had no sound, and when he touched them they
did not feel his touch. They had some roots and rats, which they
were roasting and eating, and without feeling any surprise Jack
felt certain that they were the same five gins who had avenged
their tribe, and whom he had seen the night before, young and
vigorous.</p>

<p>Once more the deep sleep overcame him, and he awoke in the
middle or a dark night and an approaching thunderstorm. A
carrion-like smell was in his nostrils, and when he sat up he put
his hand on what seemed like the withered skin of a dead horse or
bullock. A brilliant flash of lightning showed him the grim
remains of some blacks, dried and shrivelled to the shape of
mummies. He waited for the next flash, and rapidly took in the
situation. Yes; there were five bodies rotting away&mdash;the
same, he felt certain, he had lately seen eating their wretched
meal over a fire. Here, then, those five survivors had lived and
died. The horror of the thing overcame him, and he lost
consciousness once more.</p>

<p><br>
GRADUALLY his senses came back to him. It was broad daylight,
and he tried to rise, but felt too weak. Then he slowly gathered
that he was lying under a bough shade, and that he had blankets
thrown over him. Outside somebody was moving about, and when he
called feebly, his mate, who ought to have been at the station,
appeared.</p>

<p>'Ullo, right again, Jack?' he said.</p>

<p>'Yes; where am I?'</p>

<p>'Well, the creek's got no name as yet; but when you did not
come back we tracked you up and found you here, as looney as
possible. You'd got fever to rights. As we could not take you in
to the station we built a bough shade over you, and I stopped
here with you.'</p>

<p>'How long ago was that?'</p>

<p>'It's a week since we found you, and you'd been away four days
then. So you see you've been pretty bad.'</p>

<p>'The horses here?'</p>

<p>'Dingo and two that have been lost for some time were here
right enough.'</p>

<p>'Find any bones about?'</p>

<p>'Look here, Jack. Now you've got your wits back, stop all that
talk about bones. You've done nothing else but let on about dead
niggers all the time. Lucky I've got no nerves.'</p>

<p>'No; but aren't there a lot of bones down the creek? I saw
them before I got bad.'</p>

<p>'Well, there are a few; but the boss said I was not to
encourage you to talk about them.'</p>

<p>'But I know all about it, and must find the other five.'</p>

<p>'Presently, old man; you'll have to get well first.'</p>

<p>Jack did get well; and before leaving the creek insisted upon
searching for the remains of the five gins, and, strangely
enough, five dead bodies, which might have answered for them,
were found apart by themselves.</p>

<h2><a id="ch38"></a>38. &mdash; THE MEMBER FOR TURRAWILLIGAR</h2>

<h3>A ROMANCE OF A GENERAL ELECTION</h3>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney,  16 Jul 1898</h3>

<p class="first">THE inhabitants of Turrawilligar were excited.</p>

<p>Groups of people stood in the street in the middle of the day,
a time when usually one could perform pistol practice without
hitting anything else but a dog or a hobbled horse. A stranger
would have thought, knowing the inhabitants and their habits,
that a Russian force was approaching, and that they were
discussing means of defence; but it was something far more
important than that. It was the eve of a general election, and
the candidates for the district, through an unhappy conjunction
of train and coach, were doomed to meet in Turrawilligar.</p>

<p>There were three of them. The free trade candidate was driving
across country in a buggy, the protectionist man was expected by
the up-coach, and the labor candidate in the down one. These
coaches met in Turrawilligar and stopped the night, and they were
timed to arrive early. It was not known if the three opposing
candidates even knew that Fate had ordained their meeting there
that night; probably they did not, and the more fun might be
expected.</p>

<p>Active canvassers, the strange, wild-eyed, brassy-voiced men
with unquenchable thirsts, who emerge from dim obscurity into
life at all general elections, already pervaded the place, and
barracked for their various candidates. Men with looks of strange
importance perused printed lists with a gloomy, pre-occupied air;
and an army of loafers glared around with bloodshot eyes, and
wondered when the shouting was going to begin. All things pointed
to a busy time and an excited political meeting.</p>

<p>Turrawilligar, though a town which was usually in a state of
chronic rest, where the inhabitants mostly died of feeling tired,
was the centre of the district, and the votes of the town and
surrounding country would probably control the election;
therefore, it was now an important place, and put on airs. Men
who acted as 'our occasional correspondent' for different
metropolitan papers were button-holed as to their opinion and
gave it with an air of great mystery and caution.</p>

<p>Time hung heavily until the first coach should arrive, and the
war commence. At last the anxiously-looked-for cloudlet of dust
appeared in the distance, and at the same time the coach from the
other direction put in an appearance. Urged on by bounteous
promises and stimulants, the drivers had made extra efforts to
arrive first, and it turned out a dead heat. Both coaches drew up
in the main street at the same time, and a double-barrelled cheer
rent the air. The labor candidate proved to be of the usual kind,
young, self-important, and effusive to a degree; the other, an
old hand in Parliament, black-coated, bland, and smiling. Each
was pounced upon by their friends and committee, and taken to
their different quarters, and the other passengers had a chance.
There was nothing particular about these, beyond the fact that in
the up-coach was a young lady, whose face was screened from sun,
wind, and dust by a gauze veil, but whose figure, in a dress
fitted for travelling, was very satisfactory. She stood for a
minute, and pointed out her portmanteau to the groom, then went
into the hotel and inquired about accommodation.</p>

<p>'Who's she, Dick?' inquired one or two who had the proud
privilege of being on conversational terms with the driver.</p>

<p>Dick replied that he knew nothing about her, beyond that he
believed she had come up by the express from Sydney to the town
whence the coach started from, and was going right through.</p>

<p>The hotel where the coaches changed&mdash;the Royal&mdash;had
been secured for the still absent free trade candidate. The
protectionist put up at the Commercial, and the labor man was to
orate at the Union.</p>

<p>Excitement settled down for a time, and people began to find
the sun hot, and some went round the corner to see a man, some
went home, and some got in the shade where they could spit
comfortably. The labor man was making himself common and popular
in the bar of the Union. The protectionist shrewdly kept himself
from the public gaze, and enjoyed some refreshment in private
with his personal friends. He knew too much to cheapen his
presence. Both his opponents were young aspirants for their first
seat, and he calculated on an easy victory.</p>

<p>In the Royal a voluble chambermaid was chattering to the lady
passenger on the enthralling topic of the election, and bewailing
the absence of the free trade man, who would have made things
still livelier. The Royal felt hurt and indignant; the other
hotels had each a candidate, and their man had not turned up.</p>

<p>'What is his name?' asked the lady.</p>

<p>'Macdonald. I suppose you don't read the papers much, m'am,'
replied the confidential chambermaid, who thought that all the
continent was breathlessly watching Turrawilligar.</p>

<p>'Do you know his Christian name?' asked the visitor, ignoring,
the remark upon her literary studies.</p>

<p>'No; but I'll get you our paper, if you like; there's his
address to the electors in it.'</p>

<p>'I should be much obliged,' said the lady.</p>

<p>The girl returned with the local organ, and the lady glanced at
the foot of the column where the name of C.Z. Macdonald was
written.</p>

<p>'Don't you feel well, m'am?' asked the curious maiden. 'Can I
bring you anything?'</p>

<p>'No, thanks. I'm tired from the coach travelling. I'll sit
here quietly, thank you. You may bring me up a cup of tea.'</p>

<p>The girl departed, and informed a friend that that passenger
in No. 9 had gone all white when she read the candidate's name,
then turned red.</p>

<p>'She knows him well, or I'm much mistaken,' added the
damsel.</p>

<p>Left alone, the lady, who, without her veil, proved to be both
young and pretty, sat down and commenced to read the conventional
cut and dried address.</p>

<p>'Poor Chris,' she thought, 'he's no hand at this sort of
thing; what a mess he'll make of his speech; I feel quite sorry I
left him.'</p>

<p>The young woman leant back musingly, and her thoughts ran on
the silly quarrel that had caused her to insist upon her
returning to the shelter of her father's roof in a fit of
childish temper. We were both donkeys.</p>

<p>'I do hope he'll turn up tonight; I won't see him, but I'll
listen to him, humming and hawing till he breaks down. I hope
they won't pelt with flour and eggs; I never could make it up
with him again if I saw him looking like an omelette before it
was cooked.'</p>

<p><br>
THE committees were holding a solemn and momentous meeting.
They agreed that under the circumstances it would be rank folly
for the candidates to speak at one and the same time, and split
up the small population into three scattered audiences. The
weather was fine; there would be a glorious full moon, and one
could speak after the other.</p>

<p>The protectionist committeemen stated that their man would
generously leave it to the labor candidate to open the ball. The
labor candidate, on hearing, it, said it was a handsome offer,
and he would show his sense of his opponent's generous treatment
by accepting it. The protectionist laughed. He who speaks last
has the pull of his opponent always. So it was arranged, and the
free trader would have to take his chance when he arrived.</p>

<p>He did arrive.</p>

<p>The buggy came unawares into the town, and almost unseen the
candidate in the free trade interest descended and entered the
Royal. He had travelled far and fast, and was anxious for a wash
and change before interviewing anybody.</p>

<p>As the young man followed the maid along the corridor, he met
a lady who seemed anxious to avoid him, but it was too late,
escape was cut off, and he stood face to face with his wife.</p>

<p>'My dear Dora,' he stammered.</p>

<p>'Excuse me, Christopher; I am not nor ever will be your dear
Dora again.'</p>

<p>'But where are you going? Do let us speak at any rate.'</p>

<p>'I am going to my father, to Ranksmead. I have been staying
with Aunt Rachel.'</p>

<p>'Is there a private sitting-room up here?' said Macdonald to
the delighted and attentive maid.</p>

<p>'Yes sir.'</p>

<p>'Dora, will you come and sit down and talk?'</p>

<p>'Well, I see no harm in it, and I have something important to
say to you.'</p>

<p>The girl ushered the couple into a prim and conventional
sitting-room with six stiff chairs, a round table, and two
hundred and fifty antimacassars in it, then flew down stairs,
three at a time to communicate the stupendous news of the gay
being the candidate's wife or sweetheart, she didn't know which,
to the assembled household. They've had a quarrel, and they're in
No. 12 now, making it up.'</p>

<p>'Shall we go and peep through the keyhole?' suggested one
daring spirit, but the landlady appearing blocked that
proposal.</p>

<p>In No. 12, when the door closed, the dusty candidate was about
to embrace his wife, but was haughtily repulsed.</p>

<p>'I wish to speak on business,' she said, motioning him to a
chair on the far side of the round table, which had twelve wool
mats, a glass case of wax fruit, and three books on it.</p>

<p>'Who composed this?' she said, vindictively pointing to the
paper she still held in her hand.</p>

<p>'I did, or, at least, Tom helped me.'</p>

<p>She read but several sentences, smooth, bald, conventional,
and flat.</p>

<p>'They're nice, convincing, and original. A woman couldn't
write like that, could she?'</p>

<p>'It's the way you read them,' said the candidate, feeling
nettled. He himself had polished those sentences, and had thought
them neat and just the right thing, which from, one point of view
they were.</p>

<p>'Read them yourself, then,' She passed the paper to him. He
commenced, then threw the paper down, while she laughed
mockingly. He got up and went over to the window.</p>

<p>'Have you your speech for to-night written out?' she
asked.</p>

<p>'Yes; notes of it.'</p>

<p>'May I see them?'</p>

<p>He took them out of his coat pocket, and gloomily gave them to
her. She commenced to read, while he moodily stuck his hands in
his pockets. The atmosphere was electric. She read half-way
through, then put the notes down.</p>

<p>'Oh, Chris! I did think you could do better than that.'</p>

<p>'It doesn't matter; I won't speak to-night.'</p>

<p>'Don't speak that. Why it's a hash-up of all the dead and gone
speeches for years. Why didn't you commence, "unaccustomed as I
am to public speaking" at once?'</p>

<p>'Oh, never mind, tear it all up. I'll tell my committee I
withdraw. You've made a fool of me, and now we'll quarrel
again.'</p>

<p>Dora Macdonald laughed. She went, over to her husband and took
his arm, and, of course, he turned his head away.</p>

<p>'Chris, what did we quarrel about?'</p>

<p>'I'm sure I don't know. Woman's franchise or some
rubbish.'</p>

<p>'It was not rubbish,' she said, drawing away. 'Oh, I don't
mean exactly that that particular thing is rubbish, but it was
not worth quarrelling about,' he replied, relentingly.</p>

<p>'Then why don't you own up you were wrong?'</p>

<p>'Well, I will if you like. I'm sick of politics already.
Anyone can have the franchise for me. Babies in arms
admitted.'</p>

<p>'I want a convert, Chris,' she said, stealing her hand into
his. 'It's been very miserable since we made fools of ourselves,
hasn't it.'</p>

<p>'I've not been particularly jolly.'</p>

<p>'No more have I. I quarrelled with Aunt Rachel because she
agreed with me that you were a brute. Will you go on with the
election, and advocate the franchise for women, just to oblige
me?'</p>

<p>The political traitor bent down and kissed her.</p>

<p>'Now I'll help you; go down and talk to your friends, while I
write and plan. I'll pull you through. But I wish you could speak
better. Shall I stand by you and hold your hand?'</p>

<p>The interested maid who had been listening on the stairs new
down to inform all hands that they must have made it up, as the
gentleman had gone in to the lady's room to wash his hands. The
candidate came downstairs and met his friends, while his wife
worked hard upstairs.</p>

<p><br>
EIGHT o'clock came; there was stir and bustle in the streets,
and a full moon, looked down upon a crowd of Turrawilligar
citizens assembled outside the Union Hotel to hear Mr. Marmaduke
Price address the free and independent electors on the subject of
his merits and fitness to represent them. Like the enthusiastic
parson in the <i>Bab Ballads</i>, 'He argued here, he argued
there, he also argued round about him.'</p>

<p>At last some unruly spirits got bored, and began to pelt the
candidate with questions and flour bags. Mr. Price lost his
temper when the first egg spoilt the new coat he had invested in
for the occasion. Then the fun grew fast; Turrawilligar was
having a great time.</p>

<p>At last, when he ceased, a loud voice asked him if he was in
favor of womanhood suffrage? This was an interesting question,
and there was silence while Mr. Pries explained that he had given
the question, deep consideration, and that he thought women were
more suited for the domestic hearth than the political arena.
Then a tempest arose, amid which the chairman put the motion that
Mr. Price was a fit and proper person to represent the
electorate. To himself he declared it carried by a unanimous show
of hands, and gladly and hastily retired.</p>

<p>Then the crowd had drinks, said they were having a rare old
time, and adjourned to hear Mr. Bagshaw, at the Commercial. Mr.
Bagshaw, though not exactly a local man, was well known in the
district, and always passed politically for being Local. It was
good capital. He would have preferred being last man, but
Macdonald pleaded fatigue. Bagshaw had a good stock of repartee.
It was Did, and had seep much service, but it always went down
with, a country crowd. He got them in a good humor, and kept them
in one, end they gave three cheers for good old Bagshaw; and
didn't pelt him worth speaking of. Then came the questions, and
the same loud voice demanded whether he was in favor of women's
suffrage. Bagshaw war not to be caught so easily.</p>

<p>'Am I in favor of giving women the franchise? Yes, certainly,
under conditions. I would not undertake to bring forward a bill
myself, for I feel that it as a change, a revolution, that might
entail...'</p>

<p>Here he went off into a string of platitudes that quite
satisfied his hearers, and left him where he was, pledged to
nothing. Bagshaw's meeting was a success, but the restless ones
felt that the fun had not been fast enough for them. Never mind,
there was the free trade candidate at the Royal, and they would
take it out of him.</p>

<p>The balcony of the Royal was brilliantly lit up, whereas the
others had not been. The crowd assembled, expectant. The
chairman, a well-known and popular squatter, was there to
introduce Mr. Macdonald, but first he had a few words to say. Mr.
Macdonald had seen fit to add an additional plank to his
political, platform; he had pledged himself to uphold women's
suffrage through thick and thin. There was a lady present, who
wished to address a few words to them. He led forward a
stranger&mdash;the lady passenger of the coach.</p>

<p>The crowd looked on silently and admiringly. She was
charmingly and befittingly dressed in a costume with but a slight
touch of mannishness about it in the collar, necktie, and
nattily-cut coat. She was very pretty, and had a clear, musical
laugh. The flour-bags dropped out of their hands, and the eggs
were discarded, as she addressed them on the subject of the
franchise for women. It was very old stuff, of course, but to her
hearers it was quite fresh and novel. The silence was
painful.</p>

<p>'People say,' she concluded, 'that a woman's nerves would not
stand the rough work and riot of the hustings; but I have had
nothing to complain of. I certainly heard you making a good deal
of noise down there,' indicating the Union, 'but I have proved
that you can give a woman a quiet and respectful hearing.'</p>

<p>She went on to ask for the same favor for her husband, and as
this was the first intimation the crowd had of the relationship,
a frantic cheer went up.</p>

<p>Macdonald advanced, but there were shouts of 'No! no!'</p>

<p>'What's the matter?' asked his wife.</p>

<p>'We'll vote for you!' called out one.</p>

<p>'Yes!' came an universal shout. 'You stand for the district!
We'll put you in! We'll make you member!'</p>

<p>The chairman fell into step with them.</p>

<p>'Am I to put the question to the meeting whether you consider
Mrs. Christopher Macdonald a fit and proper person to represent
you in Parliament?'</p>

<p>'Yes! yes!' yelled the delighted crowd. As gravely and
formally as he could the chair-man put the question; and a forest
of hands was held up, everyone holding up two.</p>

<p>'Carried unanimously without any dissent,' he said; and Mrs.
Macdonald gravely thanked them.</p>

<p>After that Macdonald was scarcely listened to, the crowd
dwindling away until about three men who were stupid with beer
listened to the end of his speech and promised to put him at the
head of the poll.</p>

<p><br>
'FANCY! I'm the member for Turrawilligar,' said Mrs.
Macdonald, as they offered her laughing congratulations.</p>

<p>'We'll consider you so for the present,' said the Chairman.
'You are member till polling day.'</p>

<p>'It's all a joke, then,' she said, in a tone of real
disappointment. 'Do you think Chris will get in?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Well, no; I don't honestly think so.'</p>

<p>'And I don't want to now,' her husband said. He finished the
speech afterwards in private.</p>

<p>Bagshaw, of course, waltzed in hands down; but Mrs. Macdonald
didn't care. She has given up advocating woman suffrage, but
still thinks there's something in it&mdash;for single women. She
herself has too much to do.</p>

<h2><a id="ch39"></a>39. &mdash; OUTLAW-TRACKING</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 6 May 1899</h3>

<p class="first">
THE storm had ceased, and, with one of those rapid changes
peculiar to the tropics, the star studded sky was now serene and
cloudless. But we were miserably wet and cold. The fire had been
put out in spite of our best endeavors, and we crouched down with
our sodden blankets over our shoulders, making strenuous efforts
to relight it.</p>

<p>Brient went down the bank of the creek to try and get a dry
underlayer of tea-tree bark. I heard a fall and a splash,
followed by bad language, and guessed that he had gone over a
steep piece of bank in the dark. However, as the creek was not
deep, and he could not get much wetter than he was already, I did
not trouble to go to his assistance.</p>

<p>Presently he came, still mildly blasphemous, but he had got
some dry bark and twigs from under a heap of drift wood, and with
these we soon had the fire alight and going. We put some water on
to make tea and started our pipes.</p>

<p>'Funny thing we can't hear we bells,' said Brient. 'The horses
ought to be feeding now.'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid they have started walking before the wind and
rain, like they are very fend of doing,' I replied.</p>

<p>'They'll be a jolly long way off in the morning then,'
returned my mate. It's scarcely worth while turning in again in
these wet blankets.'</p>

<p>'No. Let's get a couple of saplings and hang them up, they'll
dry a bit, and keep the cold air from our backs.'</p>

<p>We did as I had suggested, and sat smoking and yarning until
the glorious morning star was over the tree tops.</p>

<p>'Things will be safe enough,' said Brient, 'I think we had
better both go after the horses, as they have very likely split
up in the storm.'</p>

<p>First putting our traps a bit together, we started for where
we had last heard the horse bells, and soon picked up the tracks.
As I had suspected, they had been shuffling along before the fury
of the wind and driving rain and were probably I now several
miles away. We walked on through I the wet grass rather sulkily,
until about an hour after sunrise. Brient, who was ahead, uttered
an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>'Niggers!' he said. 'Look at that.'</p>

<p>A big trail came across in a slanting direction, and followed
the horse tracks we were following.</p>

<p>'They're only just ahead; the tracks are red hot,' said
Brient. 'All bucks, too; not a gin's nor piccaninny's track
amongst them.'</p>

<p>'They'll spear the horses if they pull them up first,' I said.
'And we have only got our revolvers with us.'</p>

<p>'No time to go back for the carbines,' said Brient, 'we must
push on, and trust to providence.'</p>

<p><br>
AND we did push on. If we overtook the blacks before they
reached the horses, who must be pretty close now, we might be
able to give them a sudden fright, and scare them. We had
scarcely gone half a mile, however, when a quick jangling of the
bells ahead told us that we were a few minutes too late. Running
through a belt of scrub which separated us from the scene, we
came right on top of the blacks unseen by them, and had used our
revolvers to some effect before they were aware of our presence,
and took to their heels.</p>

<p>One, a tall fellow stopped when he got to the timber, for the
horses had been feeding on a small plain when attacked, and made
an insulting gesture, crying out as he did so in English:</p>

<p>'Whitefellow next time.'</p>

<p>Brient had a long shot at him, but he was too far off for a
revolver, and, with a laugh, he disappeared.</p>

<p>'It's that Corny who ran away from Holt's Station, and joined
the blacks. Holt ought to have gone after him at once; but he's
such a lazy pig,' said Brient, disgustedly.</p>

<p>We went over to the horses, and Brient broke out in
imprecations on the heads of the niggers. His favorite horse was
just dying. There were three spears in his body, and as his
master knelt down by him, he stretched out his quivering limbs,
and gave up the ghost. Poor Brient had tears in his eyes, and I
left him, and went to look at the others.</p>

<p>Out of the six remaining two were wounded, but not badly, but
the others were unhurt, or comparatively so. We went back to
camp, leaving the body of poor Rattler on the plain, covered with
mulga boughs, for, said Brient, those cursed crows shan't come
mauling him about if I can help it. They can have the dead
niggers.'</p>

<p>'Look here, Ned,' said Brient suddenly, after we had got to
camp, and doctored the wounded horses up a bit, 'I'll never rest
till I get that internal Corny. Let's go after him and his lot
before we go to the range.' (We were bound on a prospecting trip
at the time.)</p>

<p>'These horses must have a spell, and we'll leave them here
until we come back.'</p>

<p>'And the niggers will come along and finish I them,' I
remarked.</p>

<p>'Oh well, we must chance all that. I don't think that any of
Corny's mob will turn back when we are on their tracks. There are
three out there at any rate who won't.'</p>

<p>Brient was more excited than ever I had seen ten before, but
then his horse Battler had been the apple of his eye. He had
broken him in as a colt, and scarcely anybody but Brient had ever
crossed his back. This runaway blackboy Corny, too, was suspected
of more than one murder, and, by unwritten law, was a prescribed
outlaw. So we planted such of our belongings as we did not wish
to take with us, and started at once to pick up the tracks,
which, thanks to the storm, were remarkably plain.</p>

<p>Although they had some hours' start of us, we were able to
travel pretty quickly, and we came to the camp where it was
evident that they had picked up their women and children, and
this camp showed signs of hasty departure, for a good deal of
their impedimenta had been left behind. Worthless most of it, but
still, as a rule, a blackfellow leaves nothing behind if he can
help it.</p>

<p>From the deserted camp the track turned direct to the range,
almost to the very spot where we had&mdash;on account of a wild
tale told by a man whom we once picked up dying of thirst, and
whom we could not keep alive&mdash;intended to go prospecting. On
we went, and the tracks, as Brient said, were getting red
hot.</p>

<p>'Remember,' said Brient, 'we have taken it out of the others
already for killing the horses, and Corny is the man we want. We
can easily pick him out by his height.'</p>

<p>I nodded, to intimate that I understood, and we pressed
on.</p>

<p><br>
IT was about 4 o'clock that we came on the rear of the blacks,
who were straggling along, evidently making for the range, in
order to gain it before the native police were on their heels,
some old gin caught sight of us in spite of all our care, for we
turned off, hoping to get round to the lead unobserved, for we
guessed that Corny would be there.</p>

<p>The old hag set up a scream or warning that could be heard.
for a mile, and there was nothing for it but to dash straight
ahead. Some of the blacks took to trees, after the very foolish
custom that they have, and others crawled in the undergrowth, for
we had overtaken them just in the middle of a scrub. Not taking
any notice of these, we kept on ahead, and presently caught sight
of a bunch of niggers trotting along, with Corny's tall form well
in the lead.</p>

<p>Brient took after him in such desperate haste that he never
looked where he was riding, and his horse came down with him, and
gave him a nasty spill. I pulled up to see if he was hurt, and by
the time he had got over his shaking there was not a native to be
seen, and the silence of the grave reigned over the scrub lately
ringing with yellings and howlings. Not a black was in sight,
Corny had made good use of the time afforded him, and
vanished.</p>

<p>The first thing Brient did was, of course, to use bad language
towards me for stopping to took after him instead of following
Corny.</p>

<p>'If we could get hold of one of those gins, they could find
him,' he said. 'They can't be far away. Goodness knows there were
enough of them in the scrub just now.'</p>

<p>'Just as well look for the proverbial needle,' I answered.</p>

<p>Brient remounted and started on a fount through the scrub,
and, as I thought I might as well see the thing through, I
accompanied him. Just as we were on the point of giving it up, my
horse nearly trod on a young, gin, cowering under a bush of what
is known locally as 'wait-a-bit.' She frightened the soul out of
both of us by suddenly jumping up with a scream of fright. So
clever was she hiding that neither of us suspected her close
presence.</p>

<p>After soothing her fears, Brient sounded her as well as he was
able on the subject of Corny, whose name was perfectly familiar
with the blacks. She intimated her willingness to go on his
tracks but, as by this time it was growing dusk, we had to defer
the start until the morning. We camped at a email creek, and
secured the gin, who did not understand a buckle, by a rein to a
sapling. We gave her a good feed, and Brient remarked as we lay
smoking on our blankets, 'I hope she won't do what I knew two
blackfellows do once in West Australia.'</p>

<p>A constable was taking them down to Fremantle, and when he
camped one night he chained them to a sapling. Next morning there
were no prisoners and no sapling. They had managed to uproot it
and carried it away. Finally the sapling was found with the chain
fastened to it.</p>

<p>Brient's yarn sent me off into a sound sleep, and in the
morning the gin was there, apparently very comfortable after her
feed. She proved a splendid tracker, and seemed to stick to
Corny's track in a wonderful way, until it separated from the
others, and made off for the nearest point of the range.</p>

<p><br>
AT about 12 o'clock we were amongst the rocks of the higher
portions of the range.</p>

<p>'By Jove!' said Brient, 'this is the very spot the poor old
beggar described to us.'</p>

<p>Before us lay a small plateau from the centre of which rose an
outcrop of quartz; rather a big reef in fact.</p>

<p>The gin was ahead picking out Corny's tracks with the accuracy
of a trained hound, and we were riding leisurely behind, when the
black woman suddenly gave a frightened shriek, and, before we
could draw our revolvers, or rightly comprehend what was
happening, she was stretched dying on the ground.</p>

<p>Corny had been concealed behind the rocky wall of reef; he had
glided out and speared the unfortunate gin at our horses' feet.
Brient took after him like a madman; but I stopped to see after
the gin. One look showed that I could do nothing, so I galloped
after Brient, who was now nearly out of sight.</p>

<p>Corny was doubling in amongst the rocks and boulders, so that
I easily overtook Brient, and the hunt became very keen. With the
two of us he had no chance, and he soon recognised it, for,
taking advantage of Brient being on the lower side of the
mountain slope, he managed to start the boulder behind which he
had been sheltering, and send it down on top of Brient. The
latter tried to pull his horse aside, but failed, and the boulder
knocked the pair of them headlong. Corny gave a shout of
exultation, but he had exposed himself and my carbine was ready.
That was the last shout he ever uttered. To my surprise Brient
was almost unhurt. The horse had its shoulder broken, and had to
be shot.</p>

<p>We went up to the body of the outlaw.</p>

<p>'He nearly had me, old man,' said my companion, 'but what's
this?'</p>

<p>The stone dislodged by Corny was part of another outcrop, and
there was gold unmistakably showing in the face of the unearthed
portion.</p>

<p>The reef on the plateau described to us by the dying traveller
was worthless. The real reef was where the outlaw died, as we
afterwards found to our mutual benefit.</p>

<h2><a id="ch40"></a>40. &mdash; TOMLINSON'S TRANSFORMATION</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney,  21 Jul 1900</h3>

<p class="first">
HE was such a perfectly hopeless and unlucky person that
everybody on the station took pity on him. If he was sent to
milk, the cow always kicked the bucket over. If he went out to
look for horses, he came back late at night without them, or else
got lost. He was an amiable young fellow, learning the colonial
experience, and said to be of good family, if not heir to a
title; but station work was beyond him, although he was painfully
anxious to learn, Naturally be was at first made the subject of
many practical jokes, which he took with, the greatest good
humor, so good-humouredly, in fact, that the jokers left off
playing them.</p>

<p>There was one thing, however, he thought he could do, and that
was play the concertina; and play it he did in such an
excruciating fashion that as soon as he commenced every dog on
the station raised its voice in one long howl of remonstrance.
After that he was banished into the lonely bush when he wanted to
practice&mdash;which he resented very much, but went
nevertheless&mdash;and his distant wailings could be heard far
into the night, awakening an occasional howl of lamentation from
a susceptible dog suddenly aroused to the fact that another dog,
or some unknown animal, was bowling in the dim distance.</p>

<p>Taken in conjunction with his supposed aristocratic descent,
this love for concertina music was somewhat strange. He never
spoke of his home or people. He came up to the station under a
mysterious mandate from the owners; and the manager simply cursed
his luck, and tried to do his best, but without much avail; so he
let the youth slide, and although he did not actually earn his
tucker that was the business of the owners, not the manager.</p>

<p>So Tomlinson (or that was the jackeroo's name) mooned about,
got in everybody's way, and played melancholy airs on the
concertina on moonlight nights. The boys on the station had
decided that he was a shingle short, in spite of his handsome,
intelligent face and nice, cultured manner; and, having come to
that conclusion, they left Tomlinson alone, like the manager
did.</p>

<p>There was one thing about Tomlinson, that, although in
appearance a man who would enjoy field sports to the utmost,
still he had the greatest horror of firearms, and could never be
persuaded to take a gun in his hands.</p>

<p>Tomlinson had been on the station nearly two years when the
blacks, who had hitherto been very quiet, made a raid on the
cattle, and all hands turned out to punish them, The station was
nearly deserted, save for the manager's wife with her two
children, a maid-servant, an old man, and Tomlinson.</p>

<p>Not the slightest suspicion was entertained that the blacks
would come near the station, and consequently no precautions had
been taken. The blacks after a cattle-killing raid generally
decamp as fast as they can, but on this occasion they did not do
so, and appeared at sundown to the affrighted gaze of the two
women, the old man, and&mdash;Tomlinson.</p>

<p>The manager's wife had plenty of pluck, and could shoot well,
the maid servant was helpless, the old man was willing, but,
seeing that his eyesight was bad, not of much use, and, Tomlinson
absolutely refused to discharge a firearm. The jeers, taunts, and
pleadings of the women were of no avail; he evinced no fear of
the situation, but simply would not fire a shot in defence of the
place.</p>

<p>The blacks came on, and the manager's wife, who found that she
had the command thrust on her, rose to the situation and took
charge. She hailed the approaching blacks, and told them that
they must come no nearer. Still they came on, and taking good aim
she fired, and shot the leader.</p>

<p>There was a cry from the black, and a cry from Tomlinson. The
woman looked round to see him standing with a ghastly look on his
face watching the fallen blackfellow; then he, too, fell in a fit
on the floor. Fortunately the blacks drew back for a while,
frightened at the deadly aim of the woman's gun. During that
abort spell Tomlinson came to himself, and rose from the
floor.</p>

<p>But it was not the same man who got up in place of the man who
had fallen. A different light was in his eyes and in his face.
For a moment he seemed bewildered, and looked around as though he
scarcely knew where he was. Then, as the yell of the blacks rang
out again and they advanced once more, a change came over him,
and he went up to the manager's wife and took the rifle from her.
He picked up a packet of cartridges from the table, and without
hesitation stepped out on the verandah, and stood exposed to
every spear and missile. But not one touched him, and with deadly
precision he fired upon the savages till they broke and fled,
this time for good.</p>

<p>Tomlinson followed them some distance; then came back to the
house.</p>

<p>'I am sorry I said what I did,' said the manager's wife; 'but
why at such a moment did you play the fool?'</p>

<p>'I really don't know that I played the fool in any way, my
dear Madam, but really I should like to know where I am, or
whether this is all a nightmare or not.'</p>

<p>'Well, Mr. Tomlinson, considering you have been here for two
years, you ought to know where you are.'</p>

<p>'And is my name Tomlinson?'</p>

<p>'So you say and the owner, of the station who sent you up here
with a letter of introduction.'</p>

<p>'How long ago?'</p>

<p>'I told you two years.'</p>

<p>'What is the date now?'</p>

<p>The woman told him.</p>

<p>'Three years,' he muttered. 'Three years since that night;
have I committed any more murders since then?'</p>

<p>The woman got frightened at his strange manner.</p>

<p>'Don't worry yourself thinking now,' she said, 'wait until my
husband and the others come home.'</p>

<p>'Call me if I am wanted,' said Tomlinson; and, staggering
slightly, he walked into the bedroom, and lying down fell into a
heavy sleep, or rather stupor. The others came home quickly; they
had crossed the tracks of the blacks making towards the station,
and turned back at once.</p>

<p><br>
WHEN Tomlinson woke up the next morning his mind was clear,
and he was in possession of his right senses. In an interview
with the manager, the latter told him that he had a letter for
him entrusted to his care by the owners of the station who had
been the means of his coming on to the place. But he was warned
that he must not give it to him unless he saw an alteration for
the better in his mental state. 'For,' said the manager, 'you
must excuse me for saying so, but we have always considered you
mentally weak.'</p>

<p>Tomlinson took the letter, and opened it. He read it, gave a
cry of relief, and dropped his head on his hands.</p>

<p>'I owe you an explanation,' he said, raising it again;
'although there are some things I cannot explain myself. My name
is Rodney really. I am the eldest son of Sir George Rodney, a
baronet. One day, when out shooting, through, carelessness on my
part, I shot my favorite brother; and from that day to when I
tackled the blacks last night my existence is a blank. How I came
out here; how I came to Wilkins and Watt; the owners of this
station, I cannot explain; perhaps, they can. The only
explanation I can give is that a dear old friend of mine, seeing
my condition, had me shipped off here; he was for many years a
squatter himself. This letter is to tell me that my brother did
not die of the wound; but is now alive and well. Last night; I
suppose, the sight of the blackfellow being shot, recalled the
shock of the former tragedy, and restored my reason. Was I a very
bad sort of lunatic?'</p>

<p>'Quite harmless, save for liking to play the concertina at
unseasonable hours.'</p>

<p>'The concertina! It's an instrument I detest.'</p>

<p>'Well, you used to play it; and you never would touch a gun;
and were the biggest duffer at station work I ever was cursed
with, as a new chum, to break in.'</p>

<p>'A nice character: I hope I'll show you another side to it
before I go.'</p>

<p>This is the transformation of Tomlinson into Gilbert Rodney,
which so surprised everyone on Roxana Station, which be
subsequently purchased.</p>

<h2><a id="ch41"></a>41. &mdash; THE TRUE STORY OF<br>
THE MARVELLOUS FOSSIL DISCOVERY</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i> 11 Dec 1897</h3>

<p class="first">
WHAT with the roaring and raving of the wind, the incessant
downpour, of the rain, and the Egyptian darkness that surrounded
us, it was impossible to say from which direction the sound came.
But both Dave and I were assured we had heard a human cry. We
were close to the bank of one of the principal Northern
Queensland rivers, one with a belt of scrub on either bank, and
there we hoped to get sufficient shelter from the wind to put up
our tent and make a little cover for the night against the
pitiless tropical rain.</p>

<p>We listened, but without avail, then proceeded along the
cleared track through the scrub, and wheeled round on to a little
open patch on the crest of the river's bank, where we intended to
make our camp. Here the storm was not so bad, and the swirling
expanse of water and wet sand reflected a certain amount of
light.</p>

<p>As we unsaddled our horses we were startled by the same cry we
had heard before, now much closer.</p>

<p>'It is someone in the river,' said Dave. Then he gave a
ringing cry in answer. There was a lull in the storm just then,
and he shouted, 'Where are you?'</p>

<p>'On a sandbank,' came the answer, 'and the water is rising,
and I can't swim.'</p>

<p>'Keep your pecker up!' shouted Dave. 'We'll come for you.'</p>

<p>We quickly hobbled and belled the horses, threw what we could
over our packs, then undressed and went down the bank to the
water's edge. Both Dave and I could swim like fishes, and,
barring the chance of crocodiles, did not much trouble about a
swim in the night.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the bank we hailed the castaway again to get
his position, and found we were exactly opposite to him; his
voice, now that we were at the surface of the water, coming much
clearer. Bidding him wait, we went up stream and waded; into the
water. We found that the channel dividing us from the sandbank
was not over our heads; so that if the man had had confidence he
could have got off easily himself.</p>

<p>When we got to the sandbank we found a drenched figure in
shirt and trousers only eagerly awaiting us. He had attempted to
across the main channel&mdash;the one between us and the opposite
bank&mdash;got into deep water and parted company with his horse,
which sagacious animal had swum back to the point of departure,
while his rider got to the sandbank. The man was a gaunt,
big-framed fellow, and Daye and I congratulated ourselves that we
had not to swim and help him over.</p>

<p>We landed him safely where we had left our traps, and turned
to to make a camp of some sort, and get a fire alight. After some
trouble we succeeded, and after hot tea and a meal felt a little
better, and stretched ourselves on some twigs under our hastily
constructed shelter for a smoke.</p>

<p>'Good job you sang out,' said Dave; 'but an awful fluke that
anyone was here to hear you'.</p>

<p>'Yes it was, but I can tell you I was more scared of
crocodiles than drowning. I'm doomed, to die by means of a
crocodile.'</p>

<p>'Then I'd go and live south, where there are none, if I were
you,' said Dave.</p>

<p>'I would only for one thing; I know where there's a pile of
money to be made, and crocodiles or no crocodiles I intend to
have a plunge for it. I was going down to try and find a good
mate when I got adrift in this river. Now, I owe you fellows a
good turn, and you'd suit me altogether as mates. What do you
say? If you are doing nothing will you turn back with me and
tackle the adventure?'</p>

<p>'We're doing nothing at present,' I said, 'and if the spec
looks promising we don't mind going in for it.'</p>

<p>Dave grunted acquiescence.</p>

<p>'What does this pile consist of&mdash;gold?'</p>

<p>The stranger shook his head.</p>

<p>'Opals or diamonds?' suggested Dave.</p>

<p>'It's no good,' said the stranger, grinning. 'If you guessed
for a month you'd never find out. What you think of bones?'</p>

<p>'Bones!' we exclaimed.</p>

<p>'Yes, bones; but not common bones. Fossilised bones of all
sorts of creatures that lived in the Silurian, Devonian, and the
Carboniferous periods, not to mention the Eocene and Miocene, and
all the rest of them. What do you think of that?'</p>

<p>We were so aghast at the stranger's volubility that we did not
know what to think of it.</p>

<p>'The worst of it is that the place is guarded by crocodiles,
and, especially by one huge brute about 250 years old&mdash;king
of all crocodiles.'</p>

<p>'Better tell us the whole yarn straight off,' said Dave,
adding, 'How much are these bones worth by the pound?'</p>

<p>The stranger laughed. 'These things are not sold by the pound
like cheese. Their value greatly depends on them being perfect or
not. Now, these are perfect specimens. Some of them the British
Museum, or any of the large Continental or American museums would
give a couple or three thousand pounds for. I reckon there's at
least £150,000 knocking about in that place.'</p>

<p>'They weigh a devil of a lot I suppose?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Tons, and hundreds, of tons; that's the worst of it. We will
have to conceive some plan to get them away; but it's a bit of a
poser to me.'</p>

<p>'Tell us the yarn,' I said.</p>

<p>'My name's. Newman&mdash;Tom Newman&mdash;and I have spent
many years in Australia collecting as a naturalist and a
geologist. I was up towards the head of the Nicholson River,
where there is a great field for a geologist, and fell in with
some blacks, and managed to make friends with them. Blacks are of
great assistance to a collector. Everybody said I would be killed
wandering about there by myself, but I wasn't, and I got very
friendly with one old fellow whom I cut the flint head of a spear
out of, so that he got back the use of a stiff shoulder again.
When he and I came to understand one another, and he found out
what I wanted, he told me of this place and the giant bones
there; but said we could never get there on account of the
crocodiles. However, I determined to go and look at it; so one
day he and I started. It was lower down the river, where it
flowed through gorges amidst almost inaccessible ranges, and took
us some days to reach it, so rough was the country.</p>

<p>'The place, I found, was a hollow, surrounded by precipitous
cliffs. Through the centre of the depression ran the river, which
here took the form of a deep, serpentine waterhole, which the
black-fellow assured me was alive with crocodiles; and there was
one in particular&mdash;this big one that I spoke of&mdash;that
he seemed to be in great dread of; and no wonder. Some of the
fossils were in the wall-like side of the cliff, and some lying
on the ground. With my glasses I could make them out distinctly,
and the sight drove me wild to go down there.</p>

<p>'The nigger assured me there was only one way, and that was by
the gorge, where the river flowed out. It was very dangerous, as
it was only a narrow track on the steep face of the cliff, and a
slip would precipitate anyone into the crocodile hole; but I
determined to chance everything.</p>

<p><br>
'NEXT morning we started for the lower gorge, and reached it
about noon. The path looked certainly dangerous, enough, but I
was, resolute, and we started, the nigger leading, and I by
exercising great care and caution reached the inner entrance. I
tell you it was a very nasty feeling walking; along that narrow
ledge with a lot of hungry crocodiles waiting for you to fall in.
However, we, reached the hollow in safety, and I commenced, my
glorious investigations. What a wonderful sight it was; the
skeletons of those antediluvians, all perfect in every fossilised
bone. I could not imagine what had brought them all there to die,
but have thought since that they must have been frozen up there
when the Antarctic circle extended to Australia, and the change
of climate then released them. This would account for their
wonderfully complete state of preservation.</p>

<p>'Well, we thoroughly examined the place and found a safe spot,
inaccessible to the crocodiles, to camp that night. Next morning
after taking all the notes I intended to we started to leave. The
old fellow had told me on no account to have a row with the king
of the crocodiles if we met him, but if did not matter about the
others so much. As I had only my revolver with me, I did not feel
able to do much damage to any of the crocodiles. However, we
started back for the gorge, and there, just at the point where we
had to enter, on the ledge was the great crocodile himself.</p>

<p>'A frightful monster he was, about 40 ft long, with, all manner
of strange growths upon him, like a wreck covered with weed and
barnacles. The old nigger, shook with fear, and I did not feel at
all comfortable, I assure you, particularly as the creature did
not seemingly intend to move, and until he did so we could not
get out of the valley. At last, after we had looked at each other
long enough, I felt desperate, and determined to try my revolver
on him. I did not expect to make much impression, but at the
first shot I hit him in the eye. He reared up, giving a sort of
bellow at the same time, and scores of heads of crocodiles came
to the surface at once. He lashed about a bit in pain, and then
plunged into the water. Calling to the old blackfellow to follow
me, I sprang for the ledge while the way was clear, and commenced
to follow it. The monster came to the surface, and during the
whole of the perilous passage swam parallel with me showing the
bleeding socket of his eye. How I got through I know not; a dozen
times I nearly slipped and fell into his jaws, but I reached the
end in safety and looked round for my black companion, but he was
nowhere to be seen, and all my coo-eeing and calling brought no
response.</p>

<p>'I am afraid in his terror ice slipped and fell in. And somehow
I feel that I shall follow his example. I made my way back to
where I left my horses and hastened to civilisation. Now, will
you join me? there are three fortunes in it!'</p>

<p>'But can't we manage to go down by a rope from the top of the
cliffs, and gave nothing to do with the beastly gorge?' I
asked.</p>

<p>'I have thought of that,' said Newman, 'and I believe it to be
feasible; but we shall have plenty of time to discuss our plans
if you agree to go.'</p>

<p>'We'll go,' said Dave; 'and as the rain has stopped I think
we'll try and get some sleep.'</p>

<p><br>
THE morning broke fine and clear, every trace of the storm
having disappeared. Newman's horse was visible, feeding on the
other side of the river, and the river had not risen at all. We
crossed and made a short stage; then halted to dry our traps and
discuss our future proceedings. Both Dave and I ridiculed the
presence of the crocodiles as any hindrance, but the serious part
of the business was the excessive weight of the specimens. How
were we to transport them?</p>

<p>Dave had an idea, not a bad one. The country was evidently not
likely to be held under lease by anybody. Why not ascertain its
exact whereabouts and take it up. We could then work at our
leisure, and sell specimens on the ground, the purchasers having
to remove them, at their own risk. The idea seemed plausible; but
Newman at once said:</p>

<p>'Certainty, take the country up, but float it into a limited
liability company. That's our dart.'</p>

<p>Evidently that was the correct thing to do, but we must secure
one or two specimens at any rate as samples; so we made our plans
for taking a dray out to bring them back, and the dray would also
serve to carry out the ropes, and tackle for descending the
cliff. Newman said that he thought with a little trouble we could
find an easy spur up which to take the dray round to the edge of
the valley. We purchased what we wanted at Normanton; fortunately
we all three had a little money of our own; then started for the
valley of the antediluvians with high hopes.</p>

<p>I need not recount our journey there. Dave was an expert horse
driver, and as we had taken plenty of good rations; we travelled
very comfortably to the Nicholson, where we left the road and
turned into the untraversed country. Newman, who knew something
of surveying, kept an accurate dead reckoning, as it was
necessary to make sure whether the valley was in Queensland or
South Australia&mdash;it would make all the difference in the
terms on which we could secure it. In due time we arrived at the
lower gorge which led into the pocket, or valley, and had a look
at the narrow ledge which was the road to the place.</p>

<p>'I'm not taking any at present,' said Dave; and then we found
a convenient place to camp, and amused ourselves for the rest of
the afternoon, shooting at every crocodile that showed his nose
above water. I think we made a good many of them feel very sick,
but of course they all sank. Next day we soon discovered a spur
that led us upward and onward, and early in the afternoon found
ourselves on the edge of the cliffs looking down into the valley
of the fossils. We were fortunate in finding water And grass, and
turned out with much satisfaction.</p>

<p>Newman pointed out to us the different objects down below, and
particularly impressed upon us the skeleton of a gigantic lizard,
which was lying immediately beneath us. This he called by some
inhuman name, a Megalosaurus I think, and said that it had only
been found in Europe, and its discovery in Australia was a
fortune in itself.</p>

<p>Thus we passed the evening, and next morning went searching
for a place to descend. The cliffs were not much more than 100
feet high, but they were sheer, and descent without assistance
was impossible. At last, near the upper gorge, we found a place
which suggested some hope; a sort of crevice ran down, and there
was a stout tree near the brink; that would support our
tackle.</p>

<p>We soon brought the rope up, and made it fast to the tree, and
Dave, who was an old sailor, went down first. I followed without
much trouble, for the crevice afforded foothold here and there,
and then came Newman. We next proceeded to go round and examine
the specimens, and Newman, nearly went mad with excitement. There
was one he called a Megatherium, which he said had only been
found in South America; there were all manner of sauruses.
Ichthyosaurus and Plesiosaurus, and a thing like a tremendous
elephant, which he said was a Mastodon. Dave opined that it was
an old world zoological garden we had got amongst.</p>

<p>Newman could not make up his mind which of the specimens he
should select as samples, they were all so beautiful, according
to him, but at last he chose two and said he would take the bones
apart and number them, whilst Dave and I rigged up something to
hoist them up, and keep them clear of the cliff. We soon managed
this, and for the next few days were pretty busy, and finally had
the satisfaction of having the two specimens neatly packed and
put into the dray.</p>

<p>We had found out that we were not in Queensland, but in the
Northern Territory of South Australia, so our next proceeding was
to lay out the four square miles we intended to apply for, and
put down a detailed description of it. All the time we kept a
lookout for the big crocodile, shot in the eye by Newman, but he
did not put in an appearance. No doubt he was watching us on the
quiet. We started away with our load; although Newman sadly
wanted to take another specimen; but Dave and I decided we had
enough on board.</p>

<p>To shorten matters, we arrived safely in Normanton, caught a
steamer, and came south. The excitement amongst scientific
circles all over the world was immense when our discovery was
made known by cable. I went down to Adelaide to secure the
country, and Newman went to work to superintend the
reconstruction of the specimens. We were both, successful. I
obtained the country, with a right to all found on it, for a
comparatively small sum; and offers began to pour in from all
places for the two specimens. Finally we disposed of them for
£1500 the two, and then commenced the company promoting. The
thing was so novel, and the value of the samples we had brought
down so great, that the affair caught on like wild fire. A
company was formed with a capital of £200,000, to purchase our
right to the land and fossils for £150,000; we to give all
needful assistance in putting the company on the valley.
Accordingly, with a strong party, including many scientists, and
all needful appliances we returned north. In due course we
arrived at our destination, and formally handed the valley of
fossils over to the two directors who had accompanied us, and
transferred the title deeds.</p>

<p>The scientists were a peppery lot; some of them actually came
to blows over an argument about the fossil skeletons, and, only
for Dave, one would nave been put into the river amongst the
crocodiles; However, all agreed upon the extreme value of the
find, and acknowledged that it was worth twice the purchase
money.</p>

<p>Then work commenced in earnest, and one by one the specimens
were taken apart, numbered, and sent down the river to the end of
the waterhole, below the gorge, in a strong punt, which we had
recommended should be brought up. This flummoxed the crocodiles
altogether, and Newman, Dave, and I often went with our rifles
simply to watch for the king of the crocodiles, but we only saw
him twice, and on those two occasions there occurred a
tragedy.</p>

<p><br>
ON the first meeting we were accompanied by one of the most
cantankerous of the geologists, Professor Curley. Of course
before we had been in the punt two minutes he and Newman were in
the midst of a heated argument. In his excitement Newman rose to
his feet to enforce his views. The men were pulling the punt
pretty smartly, and nobody was looking ahead but Dave and I. What
we saw was this:</p>

<p>Immediately in front of the punt suddenly arose a
horrid-looking scaly back, with weeds and slime on it; the punt
struck it, and the shock overbalanced Newman, and into the water
he went. With a cry of horror Dave and I rushed to his
assistance, but it was too late: his doom had fallen. The hideous
head of a monstrous crocodile appeared, and his enormous jaws
closed on the struggling man, but before they vanished beneath
the surface Dave and I saw the eyeless socket, and knew that it
was the king of the crocodiles.</p>

<p>Newman's loss was a bitter grief to us, for we had grown to
like the man, and Dave swore that he would not leave the place
while the old saurian lived. Amongst other things a quantity of
dynamite cartridges had been brought up to blast a road down the
cliff, in case of the punt not answering expectations. Dave got
one of these and some fuse, and proceeded to wait for the king of
the crocodiles, I naturally thought that he intended to explode
the cartridge under water in the neighborhood of the
disappearance of Newman, but that was not his intention.</p>

<p>We watched diligently, and I waited with him at the entrance
to the gorge, where the ledge commenced. At last we were rewarded
for our pains. There, one morning, was the monster crocodile,
like a huge dragon of ancient story. He glared at us with his one
eye, and Dave whispered to me, 'Bolt sharp to one side if he
makes a rush at us!'</p>

<p>Then he quietly put a cap on the fuse and shoved it into the
cartridge. He lit it and boldly advanced, telling me to keep the
brute covered, and fire on the least move.</p>

<p>'Inside or out, old man,' he said, and I found out afterwards
what he meant The king of the crocodiles opened his enormous jaws
as if to terrify the oncomer, but he did not move, and quiet as
thought Dave skilfully threw the cartridge and hissing fuse down
his throat, and bolted off at right angles, and I followed his
example.</p>

<p>The crocodile closed his jaws with a snap in surprise and that
made him swallow the morsel that Dave had given him.</p>

<p>Then ensued a most extraordinary scene. The huge creature,
feeling the fuse inside him, commenced to skip and dance about,
not knowing what was up with him. Dave and I kept retiring, for
we knew the end was not far off. It came suddenly. There was a
loud report, and the King of the crocodiles was distributed all
over the country in thousands of fragments.</p>

<p>'Newman is avenged,' said Dave.</p>

<h2><a id="ch42"></a>42. &mdash; THE TWO MAYORS</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 2 May 1896</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THE Mayor of Bingleton was a troubled man, and to soothe his
spirit was taking a walk in the early morning outside the
township that he ruled with the assistance of some very
troublesome and cantankerous aldermen.</p>

<p>His re-election was worrying the Mayor. He actually wanted to
enjoy his dignity for another term of office, and a very
determined alderman, the wealthy butcher of the town, was
opposing him; and the butcher had nearly as much influence as the
Mayor.</p>

<p>There was also to be a little civic display that day. The
Mayor of a neighboring town was expected on a visit, and it was
intended to give him a public reception, and as the Mayor was not
a very fluent orator, he was taking the opportunity of the quiet,
early morning to con over the few sentences of welcome he was
expected to utter.</p>

<p>He had reached a pretty creek, spanned by a light bridge,
which he proudly and fondly remembered was his work when he
noticed a stranger in the centre of it, meditatively leaning
against the railing. He was respectably dressed, and the Mayor,
being inclined for conversation after his solitary walk, went up
and saluted him.</p>

<p>'I presume you are a resident?' returned the stranger (who had
a melancholy cast of countenance), after the state of the country
and weather had been fully discussed.</p>

<p>'I am the Mayor of Bingleton,' was the reply, given with
proper pride.</p>

<p>'And do you like being Mayor?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir, I do. And I think may venture to hope that I have
fulfilled the duties of the office creditably.'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't.'</p>

<p>The Mayor started at the apparently rude remark; but before he
could reply the sad-eyed stranger went on&mdash;'Does your wife
like being Mayoress?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' was the answer, In a stiff tone.</p>

<p>'So does mine, worse luck.'</p>

<p>'My good sir, I cannot imagine what the liking of my wife or
myself have to do with you&mdash;'</p>

<p>'O! it's not you being Mayor; it's my being Mayor that I'm
troubled about.'</p>

<p>The worthy Mayor started once more; this time in surprise.
'You are, then&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The Mayor of Burrabagan. Yes.'</p>

<p>'Our expected guest! Allow me to welcome you to this rising
and prosperous town,' and he shook hands effusively with his
fellow-Mayor.</p>

<p>'May I ask,' he went on, 'How you come to be here on foot at
this early hour?'</p>

<p>'I stopped at a little place two miles back last night, and
came out for a stroll, as I understand that I am not supposed to
be here until 11 o'clock.'</p>

<p>'No. We have prepared a small official reception for you.'</p>

<p>'Very well, I will be on hand at that time. I am just about
turning back. I suppose you have a band?'</p>

<p>'We have, and it is considered a very good one.'</p>

<p>'Ah! So have we, and it's considered a damned bad one. How do
you like your aldermen?'</p>

<p>'Mostly intractably-made beasts,' which for his Worship was
very strong language to use.</p>

<p>'And what is your opinion of butchers?'</p>

<p>'Don't mention them!' cried the ruler of Bingleton.</p>

<p>'I endorse every word you have said,' returned the Burrabagan
man, waking up into cordiality for the first time. 'Well, we must
be saying good-bye for the present, as you must be getting
back.'</p>

<p>'By the way,' said the visiting Mayor, as they shook hands,
'are you a good hand at a speech?'</p>

<p>The Bingleton Mayor blushed. As has already hinted, it was his
weak point. What he prided himself on was his administrative
ability.</p>

<p>'I do not shine there,' he said.</p>

<p>'Now, there's where I come in. I'm just a dog at a speech.
I'll guarantee to make everybody in the room as miserable as a
bandicoot within a quarter of an hour.'</p>

<p>Without going into the truth of such a subject of accepted
natural history as the proverbial melancholy of a bandicoot, the
two saluted and parted.</p>

<p>The Mayor walked back ruminating on the strange meeting, and
pondering on the singular fact that a man who held the proud
position of Mayor should look on everything with a jaundiced
eye.</p>

<p>'It's butchers troubling him,' he thought, and shook his head;
'they are mostly at the bottom of all worry.'</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
THE mayor had a pretty daughter, and the objectionable butcher
had a son, who had started for himself on a farm, some five miles
out of Bingleton. Far from sharing the sentiments of their
parents (for Mrs. Mayor also snorted at Mrs. Butcher, who bravely
reciprocated), these two young people had engaged themselves; but
their respective fathers and mothers refused to acknowledge the
fact. This naturally added to the animosity of the butcher, who
was a full-blooded man, as a butcher should be, and he accused
the Mayor's daughter of angling for his son, and called her hard
names, to which his wife added the epithet, so dear to the heart
of woman, that she was a 'designing minx.'</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Mayoress insinuated that the butcher's
son, knowing that their daughter had a little money coming to
her, had designs upon that.</p>

<p>This was the highly disagreeable complication at the time of
the arrival of the melancholy Mayor of Burrabagan. He came in due
course, was formally welcomed, and might generally have been
considered as presented with the freedom of the town, if there
had been any particular brand of freedom to present him with. He
became the guest of his brother Mayor, and a banquet was to be
held at the Royal (there is a Royal in every town to Australia),
which was to be on a scale of unparalleled magnificence. All on
account of a man who claimed to be able to make a more mournful,
miserable speech than anybody else.</p>

<p>For all his misanthropy, the Mayor of Burrabagan had a common
masculine weakness, and that was for a pretty girl, and Jenny
Oldridge was a very pretty girl. Mind you, it was a purely
paternal feeling. Jenny had a bright, taking way with her, which
at once touched a tender spot in the heart of their visitor.
Before long he was fully acquainted by her parents with the
undesirable connection she desired to form, and their sorrow at
the fact. In the course of the afternoon he met the young farmer,
and formed a different conclusion.</p>

<p>In point of fact, the butcher's son was a manly, clever young
fellow, and it was only family dissension blinded the eyes of the
parents to the suitability of the match.</p>

<p>The banquet was a delirious success.</p>

<p>The local <i>Chronicle</i> next day stated that 'Host Thompson
had surpassed himself,' and the band, before they got too drunk,
did wonders. At last, in a somewhat baiting speech Mayor Oldridge
proposed the health of their guest, F. Bonnor, Esq., Mayor of
Burrabagan.</p>

<p>Then the guest, after a decent interval, got up to return
thanks, He commenced by dilating on the beauty of the country he
had passed through that morning. He told of his early walk, and
how he saw evidences of peace, coming prosperity, and present
comfort on every side, until the hearts of his hearers glowed
with pride. Next he touched on the beauty of the town, its noble
architecture and magnificent streets. Here he paused, and went
on:</p>

<p>'But when I think of the quick and sudden destruction which
cant come, even to a place seemingly so secure from misfortune as
this is. I feel inclined to weep. The floods may devastate your
farm lands. The raging hurricane uproot your now thriving town,
and, in spite of the efforts of your gallant brigade, fire, in
its consuming wrath, may sweep away whole blocks of buildings.
Again, the ravages of some fell epidemic disease may bring death
and mourning into your happy homes. This town, now so festive,
resound with wailing and lamentation. That pretty creek that I
passed this morning is deceptive in the shallowness of Its banks.
I feel assured that only a long-continued run of moderate seasons
has hitherto kept it within bounds. And even this again is a
source of danger, for without the cleansing waters the seeds of
such an epidemic might be sown which a hot summer would
germinate, to the devastation of the town. I sincerely hope that
none of these troubles may overtake you; but, at least, let me
congratulate you on the possession of two active and energetic
undertakers.'</p>

<p>After again thanking them for the cordial manner to which they
had drunk his health, he sat down amidst a gloomy silence, which
the Mayor failed to arouse into even the tardiest spark of
applause. Several of those present felt inclined, to arise and
denounce their prophet of woe in strong and vigorous terms.</p>

<p>He forestalled them, however, by once more rising to propose
the health of the Mayor and aldermen. This he did by reminding
them of the uncertainty, of life; of the many accidents always
lying in wait for man. How they might be sitting there at the
groaning board one day and the next be stricken down by apoplexy.
In conclusion, he begged them to cultivate life and fire
insurances, and contemplate the thought of a life beyond the
grave. He wound up by wishing them long life and prosperity, but
he was doubtful; life was such a lottery.</p>

<p>After this the gloom was only relieved by heavy drinking on
the part of the aldermen, to drown the thought of their coming
demise. The band woke up to play the 'Dead March in Saul,' as
fitting and appropriate. The Mayor went away early, accompanied
by his brother Mayor, to when he addressed the nearest approach
to a joke he was ever known to have made.</p>

<p>'You are right, sir. You are a dog at a speech.'</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
DURING the days following the banquet people grew somewhat
accustomed to the tone of melancholy pervading all he said. It
was agreed that he must have a murder at least on his conscience,
perhaps two. Those who knew him said there was no cause for his
misery, as he had been eminently successful in his business, and
was now a wealthy man.</p>

<p>During his stay in Bingleton he cultivated all classes,
especially the obnoxious butcher, Burston, with whom be seemed to
have found an endless number of mutual subjects of interest. This
was much to the chagrin of the worthy Oldridge and his family;
but Jenny seemed more than satisfied. Perhaps, she and Mayor
Bonnor had a secret.</p>

<p>The popularity of the Burrabagan man, however, took an upward
turn when it was known that, in acknowledgment of the hospitality
he had received, he was going to give a very swell picnic, and a
return dinner to the Mayor and aldermen before leaving. The young
people declared the picnic to have been a marvellous success
after that event came off, more especially as there had been no
speechmaking. That, they concluded, was reserved for the
dinner.</p>

<p>As before, it was held at the Royal, and once more 'our genial
host' surpassed himself. Bonnor seemed for once to have roused
himself out of his habitual depression, so that when he got up to
speak, and commenced by saying, 'Gentlemen, I am going to tell
you why I dislike butchers,' everybody was astounded. Burston
gasped, and looked cutting-up knives at his quondam friend. This
antipathy to butchers had never been betrayed before to anyone
but Oldridge.</p>

<p>'I was once happy,' went on the speaker. Here Burston grunted
out something about being glad to hear it.</p>

<p>'I was solvent and in middling circumstances. My wife and
family were contented, and life was comparatively a dream of
poetry. A friend in the shape of a relative&mdash;a
butcher&mdash;died, and left me his wealth. Money obtained by the
sale of meat&mdash;let me assure my friend Burston that I see no
harm in that, it was the money itself was the source of trouble.
From that day out I have had no peace. My wife has got high
notions, and my children the same. My fellow-townsmen, who had
formerly let me alone, made me first an alderman, then the Mayor.
I had to preside at dinners and public meetings, and make
speeches. I have always I hope made them as miserable as I could.
Now, gentlemen, I have determined that my wealth shall return to
the channel of commerce it was in before. I had thoughts of
founding a large vegetarian society; but, instead, I am going to
open a huge butchering business. My friend Burston, if he will
allow me to call him so, has assured me that the profits are
large&mdash;I think he said enormous.'</p>

<p>'No, I didn't,' yelled Burston, who was growing purple in the
face to a dangerous extent.</p>

<p>'Large, then. As I have noticed how rapidly your township is
growing in size and population, I have decided to invest my money
here, and start an immense butchering establishment in this, the
prosperous town of Bingleton.'</p>

<p>'It's all your infernal doing!' roared Burston to Oldridge, as
the speaker ceased.</p>

<p>The latter was mildly disclaiming, when the infuriated butcher
got up, and stamped out, stopping to shake his fist in the
doorway. By the others, who saw a good deal to be gained in an
opposition shop, the speech was well received, and the evening
broke up in what the reporter termed, 'a most harmonious
manner.'</p>

<p><br>
MORNING brought calmer feeling to the aggrieved killer of
beeves. He determined to temporise first, and fight afterwards,
if necessary. Therefore, when he next met Bonnor his tone was
more conciliatory. In fact, they entered into a long interview,
which extended into several others during the time Bonnor
remained. Finally, after his departure, it was made known that
Burston withdrew his candidature for the mayoralty, and as he and
Oldridge soon after publicly shook hands, it may be surmised that
all opposition to the marriage of the young people was soon
removed.</p>

<p>The last heard of Bonnor was that he intended to devote his
surplus cash to the improvement of firearms and other weapons of
destruction. They being connected with wholesale
slaughtering.</p>

<h2><a id="ch43"></a>43. &mdash; CHING HOW'S REVENGE</h2>

<h3><i>The Critic</i>, Adelaide, 14 Dec 1904</h3>

<p class="first">
THE injured man was carried into the hut and laid on his bunk.
Andrews, the man temporarily in charge of the station through the
absence of the owner, began to examine the hurt. Outside two
lanky boys discussed the situation.</p>

<p>"Ever seen a dead man, Mick?"</p>

<p>"Can't say for certain," returned Mick, thus giving Tom the
opportunity he wanted.</p>

<p>"Ah! I have&mdash;Lots of 'em. Seen one with his head busted
open and his brains running about like a smashed egg."</p>

<p>Mick sighed, not at the fate of the man, which he knew to be a
lie, but at his weakness in, giving Tom the opportunity to lie
with safety, by admitting only a distant acquaintanceship with
dead men. He ought to have affirmed that he had been to school
with them.</p>

<p>"Hurry up," said the sharp voice of Andrews behind them.
"Catch a horse, Mick, and go over to Ralingford and tell Mr.
Allnutt that Billy Kemp's cracked his skull against a post. You
can get back easy before sundown if he's at home."</p>

<p>Mick departed to the yard with his saddle on his head, while
Tom went down the paddock to drive the horses up. Andrews turned
into the hut again. Billy Kemp had been trying conclusions with
an equine outlaw, and had got the worst of it. Unfortunately he
had been thrown head-first against a corner-post, and now lay
still and insensible.</p>

<p>Andrews was of the opinion that he was done for; but wanting
some superior judgment in the matter had sent for Allnutt, the
owner of the neighboring station, seven miles away. Allnutt was
also a J.P., so if Billy Kemp pegged out it would save
trouble.</p>

<p>The unconscious man lay on his bunk breathing heavily in a
snoring kind of way that got on the cook's nerves. The eyes,
half-opened, showed only the dull whites, and these unseeing eyes
and the blood-smeared face fascinated the cook and gave him what
he called "the creeps." Andrews, after hunting around, found a
pair of scissors that he had been searching for and stooped over
the recumbent figure.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked the cook, evidently thinking
that he was going to perform some weird surgical operation.</p>

<p>"Only cut his hair off and wash the place. When Allnutt comes
we'll see what the wound looks like. Give us some hot water."</p>

<p>Andrews worked steadily at his task, and, when he had
finished, bathed the sufferer's head and cleaned the face of the
dried blood. He put wet bandages on, and the patient seemed to
breathe easier. Tom, who had come back from the yard, watched the
performance with deep interest.</p>

<p>"Think he'll die?" he said to the cook.</p>

<p>"Can't say," answered the oracle&mdash;(all bush cooks are
oracles). "Men mostly do die when they get a crack on the skull
like that and there ain't no doctor nearer than the bounds of
blazes."</p>

<p>"Quiet fellow was Billy," hazarded the boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, Billy was a good sort, but what did he want to tackle
that brute for? I says to him, 'Billy, that horse is as old and
wicked as sin. What's the good of him when you've conquered him?
'That's just it, Joe,' says he to me; 'it's the pleasure of
conquering him.' This wouldn't have happened if the cove had been
at home, 'cos he said he was going to shoot the old rip next time
he was yarded; he was always leading some of the horses away back
and making 'em as wild as hawks. But, there, Billy reckoned he
could ride anything that had a tail to hitch a crupper on."</p>

<p><br>
EARLY in the afternoon Allnutt, the neighbor, arrived.</p>

<p>"I met Mick half-way, and turned back with him," he said to
Andrews as they entered the hut and went up to the bunk. Allnutt,
a man over middle age, with a good resolute face, removed the
bandages and inspected the battered skull. He pressed it lightly,
and as he did so the sufferer gave a convulsive start, and from
his lips came a hoarse cry that sounded like "The Chinaman."</p>

<p>Allnutt shook his head and replaced the wet bandages. "It's
past my surgery," he said. "I'm afraid it's a bad fracture."</p>

<p>"What's to be done?" demanded Andrews.</p>

<p>"We can do nothing but try and keep him alive. A broken skull
is not like a broken arm. I could manage to set that, or a leg,
but the skull's a different thing. A proper surgeon, and a good
one, too, is wanted. He'll have to be taken to the hospital."</p>

<p>"To Randimble. That's two hundred and fifty miles away. How's
it to be done?"</p>

<p>"It will be a risk. When do you expect Mr. Carlton back?"</p>

<p>"Any time; might be to-night. He won't mind the trouble,
though, for he always liked Billy."</p>

<p>"I'd drive him down for that matter; but I can t say whether
he could stand it or not. There's no doctor I know of we could
get to come here."</p>

<p>"Only that little fellow at Mackay's Crossing, and he's always
on the booze."</p>

<p>"He's no good; he's no nerve left. I'll stop here to-night and
see how he gets on. Perhaps he'll settle the question himself by
dying. If he is alive, and seems strong enough in the morning,
I'll take him down myself and chance it. See, if nothing's done
the risk is that it will be left too long, and, even if he lives,
he must be a lunatic for life."</p>

<p><br>
SUDDENLY the two boys burst in with the announcement that the
boss and another mail were coming. Then they issued out again,
each anxious to be the first to greet Carlton with the newts that
"Boko Bill had chucked Billy Kemp and busted his skull open."</p>

<p>Carlton and his companion rode up to the rude stable, and
Allnutt and Andrew went over to meet them.</p>

<p>"'Ullo, Allnutt," said Carlton, "glad to see you over. This
is an old friend of mine, coming up here for a month's
change&mdash;Dr. Curtis, been overworking himself. Curtis, this
is my nearest neighbor, Mr. Allnutt. Andrews, what is this yam
the boys have got hold of?"</p>

<p>"Sorry to say it's true. Kemp's had a bad accident."</p>

<p>"Hang 'em, they came rushing up with it as though it was the
best joke out. What did you let him go fooling about with Boko
Bill for? You know I meant to shoot the beast for a nuisance. Is
he in the yard now?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I kept him in."</p>

<p>"Well, catch him and lead him a bit away and shoot the brute.
I'll have no more trouble with him. Will you come and look at the
man now, Curtis?" he went on, turning to the doctor.</p>

<p>They went to the hut, Mick and Tom going down with the horses
to the paddock, and eager to witness justice done to Boko Bill,
the outlaw. This promised to be a day of delirious excitement for
them.</p>

<p>Curtis examined the injured skull with, his thin, delicate
fingers. He was a clever-looking man, but evidently suffering
from the effects of a temporary breakdown.</p>

<p>"Has he spoken?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Once when I was feeling the wound. It was nothing
intelligible; sounded as though he shouted out 'The
Chinaman!'"</p>

<p>Again Curtis carefully examined the injury. As he dad so the
man gave a convulsive start, as he did before, and cried out. It
was unmistakable this time. "The Chinaman!"</p>

<p>Curtis looked satisfied. "I think I can locate it," he said;
"but nothing more can be done just now. His blood will be pretty
healthy, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Kemp's not much of a man for spreeing, and he's not been
off the station for nearly two years; I suppose that's what you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'll pull him through, I hope. I suppose you've got
simple medicines on the place?"</p>

<p>"The usual things; now lets go and get something to eat. Joe,
there are some things in my pack bags for you. Let's have tea
soon."</p>

<p>Allnutt soon came to the conclusion that Curtis was a clever
man, and having, like Carlton, rather a regard for Kemp, looked
upon his coming as decidedly providential.</p>

<p>Curtis went to look at the patient again after their meal was
finished, and came back and asked Carlton if he had a handy man
about the place.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "Andrews is a born mechanician; here's a
bit of work of his." He produced a sheath knife, the blade
mounted in a handle of carved brigalow. "It's made out of a
rasp," he said. "I believe it would out iron."</p>

<p>Curtis examined it curiously, particularly the neat riveting
and general finish.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked. Then raised his hand
enquiringly. Carlton nodded.</p>

<p>"That's it. A perfect genius away in the bush. A blithering
idiot when he gets into a town."</p>

<p>"He'll do," said the doctor, putting the knife down. "You've
got a forge here?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I'll get him to make me something tomorrow."</p>

<p>They took it by turns to watch the insensible man, who lay
snoring heavily all night. When daylight broke Andrews had the
forge going, and, under the doctor's instructions, worked busily
all the morning.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Curtis at lunch, "that man of yours is a
genius. Look at this." He produced a pair of forceps. The handles
were rough and unfinished, but the remainder of the work was
delicately wrought.</p>

<p>"Made it out of some scraps of iron and the springs of an old
revolver. Blessed if I know how he did it, just from drawings I
made for him. What an awful pity that he's a hopeless case."</p>

<p>Both men looked enquiringly at him.</p>

<p>"Men have been cured before," said Allnutt.</p>

<p>"Ordinary men, but not extraordinary men, worse luck,
especially when they are as old as he is. Let him overtire his
brain and he's bound to take something to freshen himself up. No;
this sort of thing seems a dispensation of Nature for some
reason. Seen so many cases. Too many clever men in the world
otherwise, I suppose."</p>

<p>"When will you operate?" asked Carlton.</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning. He's keeping splendidly; no fever
showing."</p>

<p>"How about assistance?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't be better off," returned Curtis, who seemed better
already. "There are you two and Andrews; men with nerves, and
who'll do exactly what I tell them. Mind, that's what you've go
to do, just exactly what I say. Nothing more nor less."</p>

<p>The tinkling and hammering went on in the forge all the
afternoon, and Curtis was ready in the morning.</p>

<p><br>
THE operation was over. Carlton had gone over to the house,
very white, for a glass of whisky, and Allnutt looked rather
sick. Delicate and complicated surgical operations are trying to
amateur assistants.</p>

<p>Kemp, with his head bandaged, was lying, breathing easily.</p>

<p>"Will he be conscious when he wakes?" asked Allnutt.</p>

<p>"I think so, but we must shift him over to the house before
then. Quiet's what he must have."</p>

<p>Curtis had a satisfied look on his face, and was regarding the
home-made instruments he was cleaning with strong admiration. In
due time Kemp came to a weak consciousness of his surroundings,
but a cloud seemed to rest on his intellect, although he quickly
recovered his bodily strength. He would start suddenly, and,
after looking suspiciously round him, go to the door and peer
out, as though expecting to see some dreadful object there. Then
he would return, muttering. He spoke rationally, but his eyes
were always on the alert, and the cook declared that his nervous
system was worn in rags.</p>

<p>Curtis found the fresh, dry inland air so invigorating that he
determined to prolong his visit. He was greatly disappointed at
the mental state of his patient, and stated that another
operation would be necessary. Something or some portion of the
bone was evidently pressing on the brain. He sent down for some
things that he wanted, including chloroform, and decided to wait
until he thought the time was ripe. Any attempts to find out what
was meant by the allusion to the Chinaman only excited Kemp, and
the doctor strictly forbade such experiments.</p>

<p>Mick and Tom, disregarding this mandate in the thoughtlessness
of youth, got into difficulties with a greenhide cutting whip
wielded by Andrews. Allnutt was now often over for a visit.
Curtis, with his improved health, was a rare companion to get on
an outside cattle station.</p>

<p><br>
ONE night when he was over there he felt sleepless, and,
getting up, went out on the verandah for a smoke. It was full
moon, and the white light made everything clear and distinct. The
snort of a horse attracted his attention, and, looking down the
paddock, he saw a little lot of horses approaching the yard,
evidently being driven. He waited, and made sure that there was a
man on foot behind them, and then awakened Carlton. Slipping on
their trousers, they stole out with their boots in their hand, so
as not to arouse Curtis, and were in the shadow of the yard as
the man put one of the rails up.</p>

<p>"It's Kemp," whispered Carlton.</p>

<p>"Don't disturb him," replied Allnutt, "this may lead to
something."</p>

<p>Kemp caught a horse and led it out of the yard. Allnutt stole
forward and blocked the other horses from following. "We must get
horses and follow him," he said, as he put up the rail again.</p>

<p>The two men rode quietly after the solitary figure ahead. They
might have ridden close to him, and the clouded brain of Kemp,
engrossed with the one dominating idea, would not have noticed
him.</p>

<p>Unseen by them, they had another follower. Mick, too, had been
awakened by Kemp leaving the hut. While the attention of the two
men was concentrated on the man ahead, he had caught a quiet
horse, and, jumping on bare backed, was following in the rear. He
was not going to be out of the fun this time. Across the open
downs, where the light was strong and bright, through the belts
of scrub, where it was dark and chequered, and the unsavory
acacia smell was very noticeable, they rode on, until at last
they came on an old disused road, which the leading figure
followed. Carlton gave vent to a low whistle, under his
breath.</p>

<p>"Where is he going?" asked Allnutt.</p>

<p>"To the Gap Hut. This is the old Gap-road. It is nearly grown
over. You can just see it here and there. Kemp lived at the hut
for some time while I was breaking in the last mob of store
cattle."</p>

<p><br>
ON they kept through bands of light and shadow, always
followed by the curious urchin, until at last the black range was
visible ahead. A small patch of clear ground was reached, where
stood a hut and a horseyard. The bark roof of the hut shone
silvery white under the moon's rays. Kemp pulled up, dismounted,
and hung his horse up to a forked sapling. His pursuers halted a
little further back, where they could watch his proceedings. Mick
kept further back still, and watched, too.</p>

<p>Kemp inspected the ground about the doorway; then pushed the
door open and entered. Carlton and Allnutt stole up silently on
foot, and peered in. Kemp was in one corner muttering to himself;
then he came to the door, and, too absorbed to notice the
slinking figures in the shadow, strode around the hut, and
ascended! a little rocky pinnacle that formed one side of the
Gap, from which the hut took its name. The two followed him until
he stopped between two boulders and struck a match. When it burnt
out he struck another, and another, and seemed to be inspecting
the bottom of the narrow gap between the two boulders.</p>

<p>Apparently satisfied, he returned, and the two spies heard him
mutter as he passed, "He's there; there still. All fancy."</p>

<p>He went back to the hut, unhitched his horse, and rode back
the way he came.</p>

<p>"He's satisfied," said Carlton; "let's see what he was
after."</p>

<p>A search about the hut revealed nothing but a snake in one
corner and a frog sitting on the tie-beam. Then they went back to
the place between the boulders, where they had seen Kemp
searching. The narrow gap between the rocks had overgrown with
rank grass and undergrowth. In the early hours of the morning it
smelt dank and moist.</p>

<p>"We'll go home, and come back with Curtis, and have a good
search by daylight," said Carlton.</p>

<p>"Right you are," returned his friend, and they went to their
horses and rode home in their turn. They had hardly gone fifty
yards when they were greeted with a joyous whinny. Ahead of them
was a horse with a bridle on, which he was trailing between his
feet. Carlton got off and caught the animal.</p>

<p>"It's old Combo," he said. "What's the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>Allnutt could not tell him. Carlton jumped at the truth.</p>

<p>"One of those infernal boys was awake, and came after us. I'll
give him rats. Meantime, he shall have a walk for it."</p>

<p>He tied the reins round the horse's neck and started him on
ahead. Mick heard their retreating hoof-strokes with despair. His
faithless steed had got his bridle loose and left him. Left him
alone at the Gap Hut, which, like all deserted huts, was supposed
to be haunted. With all love of adventure quenched suddenly, Mick
started off home, only hoping he could cover the distance before
daylight, which was a pretty hard task to perform. Dawn was red
in the east when the two friends met Joe, the cook, going down to
the yard with the milk buckets.</p>

<p>"Have you had a look at Kemp this morning?" asked Carlton.</p>

<p>"Yes; he's sleeping like a top. Where have you been, Mr.
Carlton?" returned Joe, with an astonished face.</p>

<p>"Never mind now. Are the boys after the cows?"</p>

<p>"Yes; at least there's Tom bringing them up now."</p>

<p>"Tell Tom to get the buggy horses up as soon as he's yarded
the milkers, and when you see Mack give him the father of a
hiding on your own account, and then give him one on mine."</p>

<p>"Blue me," muttered the astonished cook as they left him. "Who
can make head or tail of such goings on? It's cattle duffing,
that's my belief. Cattle duffing they've been after. Full moon,
too, of course."</p>

<p>Curtis met them on the verandah, and naturally asked what was
up. They told him, and he was at once eager to be off, and as
soon as they had finished their breakfast they drove away,
leaving Andrews to keep a watch on Kemp when he awoke from the
deep slumber into which he had fallen.</p>

<p>Mick, the disconsolate, saw the buggy drive by, and limped
home to receive, under strong protest, the two threatened hidings
faithfully bestowed by the exasperated cook.</p>

<p>The secret hidden between the two boulders was soon unearthed.
A skeleton with a covering of dried shrunken skin lay under a
thin layer of earth.</p>

<p>"I could have sworn it by the look of the grass," said Allnutt
when their task was finished.</p>

<p>"It's the body of a Chinaman, and his throat has been cut,"
said Curtis, who had been examining the remains.</p>

<p>"What next?"</p>

<p>"Search the hut," said Curtis. They went back
there and commenced a minute scrutiny. They were rewarded. On the
wall-plate was a pouch neatly made of pigskin, with two Chinese
characters stamped on the flap; inside were thirty
sovereigns.</p>

<p>"Shall I speak first?" asked Curtis. The two nodded
assent.</p>

<p>"I think it's time to perform that other operation. Don't form
any opinion till Kemp's brought back to his right senses. I ask
you this in the interest of justice. The Chinaman can stop where
he is till we know the truth. It won't hurt him. Are you
agreeable?"</p>

<p>They agreed with him, and, taking the pouch with them, they
drove home.</p>

<p>"Still asleep," reported Andrews when they called him up to
the house. They told him what had happened, and showed him the
pouch and money. He looked curiously at it, with a smile of
recognition.</p>

<p>"I made this pouch," he said, "and I'll tell you how. I was on
a 'bender' down at Yankamanna, and the publican rooked me of
everything. Swore I shouted champagne for all hands, and all that
sort of thing. He had a Chinese cook&mdash;decent fellow,
too&mdash;but a bit off his chump at times. I'd had it out with
the darned shanty-keeper, and was going off with nothing but a
blanket and what I stood in. This fellow met me at the back of
the kitchen and said, 'Anderth, you all sort of silly fool. First
night you cashee check, lay down, there dlunk. I thinkee me,
bimeby want money. Takee ten pound from pouchee. Keep 'em,
savey,' and the heathen handed me ten notes he had saved from the
Christian. There was a friend of mine, a saddler, and before I
left the township I sat down in his shop and made that pouch.
Stamped the Chow's name on it, too, and gave it to
him&mdash;Ching How. That's what it reads."</p>

<p>"When Kemp comes to his wits we shall know the truth," said
Curtis. "This heavy sleep is a good sign. When he wakes I'll
operate."</p>

<p><br>
THE operation required turned out to be but slight, and Billy
Kemp awoke one morning restored to his proper mind.</p>

<p>"Lord, Bill," said Joe, the cook, "you are an obstinate
beggar. Why didn't you get well before? You've ruined my nervous
system, and the hidings Mick and Tom have got through you has
made them feel like early Christian martyrs."</p>

<p>"Now, Kemp, we're all ready; tell us how the Chinaman with his
throat cut came to be at the Gap Hut?" said Curtis when Billy was
well enough to come up and stand questioning.</p>

<p>"I wish I had told you before, Mr. Carlton; it's all through
that beggar I got chucked so bad. You know when I was living out
there keeping those J.L. cattle back? Well, I came home one night
dog-tired. They used to give me fits at first. There I found a
Chow in my hut; he'd come along the old road, and gone into my
hut, and was just making himself at home cooking a feed, calm as
you please. You know how I hate Chows, and I commenced to
perform. 'What the Salvation: Army are you doing here?' I asked.
'Alri, cookee tea,' he said smiling' sweetly. Then I let out at
him, but he would only stare and say, 'Wha for.' He riled me so
at last that I chucked him and the rations he was cooking outside
the hut. He stopped there all night, and every hour he'd sing out
to me to let him in and he'd pay me, and I had to come out and
chase him.</p>

<p>"In the morning I put him on the road to here, and told him
I'd give him 'wha for' if he came back again. Blessed if he
didn't turn up again that night just as I was dropping off to
sleep. He said he lost the road, and had been in the bush all
day, and if I didn't let him in he'd cut his throat. Out I went
and chivvied him round the hut; you see, I didn't know the poor
devil was loony. I turned in again, and back he came. 'Good-by,'
he shouted out; 'money, Ching Hong, gardener-man. You savey?
Ching Hong.' I yelled out to him that I'd come out and cut his
throat if he didn't do it himself; then I went fast asleep, for I
was dead tired out.</p>

<p>"I thought I heard a queer kind of noise just as I was
dropping off, but I never woke until morning, and when I opened
the door the pouch of money was lying on the sill, and there sat
the Chow, right opposite, with his back against a stump. Blessed
if he hadn't cut his throat, and he was as dead as a poisoned
dog. The cattle were giving me rats at the time, and I was kept
going from daylight to dark. So I put him away between the two
boulders, meaning to tell you about it, but I put it off until
you'd have been asking why I hadn't spoken before, and there had
been trouble. The money belongs to Ching Hong, whoever he
is."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by the Chinaman causing you to get a
spill?"</p>

<p>"Why, just as I was getting my seat on Boko, suddenly it all
came back to me, and I seemed to see that Chow sitting on the cap
of the fence grinning at me, with the blood on his white jumper.
My knees got quite slack, and I lost my hold altogether, and I
don't know any more."</p>

<p><br>
CHING HONG, who was Ching How's brother, got the money through
Andrews remembering the whereabouts of the pair.</p>

<p>He said it was "Welly good, alri'," but did not express any
surprise, for, as he blandly remarked, his brother 'always
foolee.'</p>
