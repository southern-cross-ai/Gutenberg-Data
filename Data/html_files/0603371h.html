<h1>PROLOGUE</h1>

<h3>I - HIS HIGHNESS THE MUMMY</h3>

<p>'Ah, what a thing it would be for us if his Inca Highness were
really only asleep, as he looks to be! Just think what he could tell
us--how easily he could re-create that lost wonderland of his for us,
what riddles he could answer, what lies he could contradict. And then
think of all the lost treasures that he could show us the way to. Upon
my word, if Mephistopheles were to walk into this room just now, I
think I should be tempted to make a bargain with him. Do you know,
Djama, I believe I would give half the remainder of my own life,
whatever that may be, to learn the secrets that were once locked up in
that withered, desiccated brain of his.'</p>

<p>The speaker was one of two men who were standing in a large room,
half-study, half-museum, in a big, old-fashioned house in Maida Vale.
Wherever the science of archoeology was studied, Professor Martin
Lamson was known as the highest living authority on the subject of the
antiquities of South America. He had just returned from a year's
relic-hunting in Peru and Bolivia, and was enjoying the luxury of
unpacking his treasures with the almost boyish delight which, under
such circumstances, comes only to the true enthusiast. His companion
was a somewhat slenderly-built man, of medium height, whose clear,
olive skin, straight, black hair, and deep blue-black eyes betrayed a
not very remote Eastern origin.</p>

<p>Dr Laurens Djama was a physiologist, whose rapidly-acquired fame--he
was barely thirty-two--would have been considered sounder by his
professional brethren if it had not been, as they thought, impaired by
excursions into by-ways of science which were believed to lead him
perilously near to the borders of occultism. Five years before he had
pulled the professor through a very bad attack of the calentura in
Panama, where they met by the merest traveller's chance, and since then
they had been fast friends.</p>

<p>They were standing over a long packing-case, some seven feet in
length and two and a-half in breadth, in which lay, at full length,
wrapped in grave-clothes that had once been gaily coloured, but which
were now faded and grey with the grave-dust, the figure of a man with
hands crossed over the breast, dead to all appearances, and yet so
gruesomely lifelike that it seemed hard to believe that the broad,
muscular chest over which the crossed hands lay was not actually
heaving and falling with the breath of life.</p>

<p>The face had been uncovered. It was that of a man still in the early
prime of life. The dull brown hair was long and thick, the features
somewhat aquiline, and stamped even in death with an almost royal
dignity. The skin was of a pale bronze, though darkened by the hues of
death. Yet every detail of the face was so perfect and so life-like
that, as the professor had said, it seemed to be rather the face of a
man in a deep sleep than that of an Inca prince who must have been dead
and buried for over three hundred years. The closed eyes, though
somewhat sunken in their sockets, were the eyes of sleep rather than of
death, and the lids seemed to lie so lightly over them that it looked
as though one awakening touch would raise them.</p>

<p>'It is beyond all question the most perfect specimen of a mummy that
I have seen,' said the doctor, stooping down and drawing his thin,
nervous fingers very lightly over the dried skin of the right cheek.
'On my honour, I simply can't believe that His Highness, as you call
him, ever really went to the other world by any of the orthodox routes.
If you could imagine an absolute suspension of all the vital functions
induced by the influence of something--some drug or hypnotic process
unknown to modern science, brought into action on a human being in the
very prime of his vital strength--then, so far as I can see, the
results of that influence would be exactly what you see here.'</p>

<p>'But surely that can't be anything but a dream. How could it be
possible to bring all the vital functions to a dead stop like that, and
yet keep them in such a state that it might be possible--for that's
what I suppose you are driving at--to start them into activity again,
just as one might wind up a clock that had been stopped for a few weeks
and set it going?'</p>

<p>'My dear fellow, the borderland between life and death is so utterly
unknown to the very best of us that there is no telling what frightful
possibilities there may be lying hidden under the shadows that hang
over it. You know as well as I do that there are perfectly well
authenticated instances on record of Hindoo Fakirs who have allowed
themselves to be placed in a state of suspended animation and had their
tongues turned back into their throats, their mouths and noses covered
with clay, and have been buried in graves that have been filled up and
had sentries watching day and night over them for as long a period as
six weeks, and then have been dug up and restored to perfect health and
strength again in a few hours. Now, if life can be suspended for six
weeks and then restored to an organism which, from all physiological
standpoints, must be regarded as inanimate, why not for six years or
six hundred years, for the matter of that? Given once the possibility,
which we may assume as proved, of a restoration to life after total
suspension of animation, then it only becomes a question of
preservation of tissue for more or less indefinite periods. Granted
that tissue can be so preserved, then, given the other possibility
already proved, andwell, we will talk about the other possibility
afterwards. Now, tell me, don't you, as an archaeologist, see anything
peculiar about this Inca prince of yours?'</p>

<p>The professor had been looking keenly at his friend during the
delivery of this curious physiological lecture. He seemed as though he
were trying to read the thoughts that were chasing each other through
his brain behind the impenetrable mask of that smooth, broad forehead
of his. He looked into his eyes, but saw nothing there save a cold,
steady light that he had often seen before when the doctor was
discussing subjects that interested him deeply. As for his face, it was
utterly impassive--the face of a dispassionate scientist quietly
discussing the possible solution of a problem that had been laid before
him. Whether his friend was really driving at some unheard-of and
unearthly solution of the problem which he himself had raised, or
whether he was merely discussing the possible issue of some abstract
question in physiology, he was utterly unable to discover, and so he
thought it best to confine himself to the matter in hand, without
hazarding any risky guesses that might possibly result in his own
confusion. So he answered as quietly as he could:</p>

<p>'Yes, I must confess that there are two perhaps very important
points of difference between this and any other Peruvian mummy that I
have ever seen or heard of.'</p>

<p>'Ah, I thought so,' said Djama, half closing his eyes and allowing
just the ghost of a smile to flit across his lips. 'I thought I knew
enough about arch&aelig;ology and the science of mummies in general to
expect you to say that. Now, just for the gratification of my own
vanity, I should like to try and anticipate what you are going to say;
and if I'm wrong, well, of course, I shall only be too happy to be
contradicted.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' laughed the professor; 'say on!'</p>

<p>'Well, in the first place, I believe I'm right in saying that all
Peruvian mummies that have so far been discovered have been found in a
sitting posture, with the legs drawn close up to the body by means of
bindings and burial-clothes, so that the chin rested between the knees,
while the arms were brought round the legs and folded over them. Then,
again, these mummies have always been found in an upright position,
while you found this one lying down.'</p>

<p>'Quite so, quite so!' said the professor. 'In fact, I may say that
no one save myself has ever discovered such a mummy as this among all
the thousands that have been taken out of Peruvian burying-places. And
now, what is your other point?'</p>

<p>'Simply this,' said Djama, kneeling down beside the case, and laying
his hands over the abdomen of the recumbent figure. 'In the case of all
mummies, whether Egyptian or Peruvian, it was the invariable practice
of the embalmers to take out the intestines and fill the abdominal
cavity with preservative herbs and spices. Now, this has not been done
in this case. Look here.'</p>

<p>And deftly and swiftly he moved the dusty, half-decayed coverings
from the body of the mummy, while the professor looked on
half-wondering and half-frightened for the safety of his treasure.</p>

<p>'That has not been done here. You see the man's body is as perfect
as it was on the day he died--to use a conventional term. Now, am I not
right?'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; perfectly right,' answered the professor, who felt
himself fast losing his grip of the conversation which had taken so
strange a turn. 'But what has all this got to do with the most unique
mummy that ever was brought from South America? Surely, in the name of
all that's sacred, you don't mean-'</p>

<p>'My dear fellow, never mind what I mean for the present,' replied
Djama, with another of his half smiles. 'If I mean anything at all, the
meaning will keep, and if I don't it doesn't matter. Now, do you mind
telling me exactly how and where you came across this extraordinary
specimen of--well, for want of a better term--we will say, Inca
embalming?'</p>

<p>'Yes, willingly,' said the professor, glad to get back again on to
the familiar ground of his own experiences. 'I found it almost by
accident in a little valley about four days' ride to the westward of
Cuzco. I was on my way to Abancay across the Apurimac. My mule had
fallen lame, and so I got belated. Night came on, and somehow we got
off the track crossing one of the Punas--those elevated tablelands, you
know, up among the mountains--and when the mule could go no farther we
camped, and the next morning I found myself in an almost circular
valley, completely walled in by enormous mountains, save for the
narrow, crooked gorge through which we had stumbled by the purest
accident. The bottom of this valley was filled by a little lake, and
while I was exploring the shores of this I saw, hidden underneath an
overhanging ledge of rock, a couple of courses of that wonderful
mortarless masonry which the Incas alone seemed to know how to build. I
had no sooner seen it than all desire of getting to Abancay or anywhere
else had left me. I made my arriero turn the animals loose for the day,
and then I sent him back to a village we had passed through the day
before to buy more provisions and bring them to me.</p>

<p>'As soon as he had got out of sight I set to work to get some of the
stones out and see what there was behind them. I knew there must be
something, for the Incas never wasted labour. It was hard work, for the
stones were fitted together as perfectly as the pieces of a Chinese
puzzle; but at last I got one out and then the rest was easy. Behind
the stones I found a little chamber hollowed out of the rock, perfectly
clean and dry, and on the floor of this I found, without any other
covering than what you see there, the mummy of His Highness lying on
what had once been a bed of soft Vicuna skins, as perfect and as
lifelike as though he had only crept in there twelve hours before, and
had laid down for a good night's rest.</p>

<p>'You may imagine how delighted I was at such a find. I hardly knew
how to contain myself until my man came back. I put the stones back
into their places as well as I could, and when Patricio returned the
next day I had the animals saddled up, and started off in a hurry to
Cuzco. There I had this case made, bought two extra mules, brought them
to the valley, packed up my mummy, took it back to Cuzco, and from
there to the railway terminus at Sicuani and took it down by train to
Arequipa, where I left it in safe keeping until I had finished the rest
of my exploration. Then I went back, took it down to Mollendo, got it
on board the steamer, and here it is.'</p>

<p>'And you didn't find any traces of other treasure-places, I suppose,
in the valley?' said Djama, who had listened with the most perfect
attention to the professor's story.</p>

<p>'No, I didn't, though I must confess that one side of the cave in
which I found this was walled up with the same kind of masonry as there
was in front of it; but, to tell you the truth, the Peruvian Government
has such insane ideas about treasure-hunting; and the life of a man who
is believed to have discovered anything worth stealing is worth so
little in the wilder districts of the interior, that I was afraid of
losing the treasure I had got, perhaps for the sake of a few little
gold ornaments which I might have dug out of the hill, and so I decided
to be content with what I'd found.'</p>

<p>H'm!' said the doctor. 'Well, you may have been wise under the
circumstances; I daresay you were. But we can see about that
afterwards. Meanwhile there is something else to be talked about.'</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, took a quick turn or two up and down the room,
with his hands clasped behind him and his eyes fixed on the floor. Then
he went to the door, opened it, looked out, shut it and locked it, and
then came back again and sat down without a word in his chair, staring
steadily at the impassive face of the mummy in the packing--case.</p>

<p>'Why, what's the matter, doctor?' said the professor, a trifle
sharply. 'You don't suppose I am afraid of anyone coming to steal my
treasure, do you?'</p>

<p>'My dear fellow,' said Djama, looking him straight in the eyes, and
speaking very slowly, as though his mind was doing something else
besides shaping the thoughts to which he was giving utterance, 'I don't
for a moment suppose that there are thieves about, or that, if there
were, any burglar with a competent knowledge of his profession would
think of stealing your mummy, priceless as it may prove to be. I locked
the door because I don't want to be interrupted. I want to talk to you
about a very important matter.'</p>

<p>'And that is?'</p>

<p>'Mephistopheles.'</p>

<p>'WHAT?'</p>

<p>'Gently, my friend, gently, don't get excited yet. You will want all
your nerves soon, I can assure you. Yes, I am quite serious. You know
that in the good old days, when people still believed in His Majesty of
Darkness, such a speech as the one you remember making a short time ago
was quite enough to call up one of his agents, armed with full powers
to make contracts and do all necessary business.'</p>

<p>'Look here, Laurens, if you go on talking like that, I shall begin
to think you have gone out of your mind.'</p>

<p>'My dear fellow, to be quite candid with you, I don't care two pins
what you think on that subject. I have been called mad too many times
for that. Now, suppose, just for argument's sake, that I were
Mephistopheles, and staked my diabolic reputation on the statement that
in that thing you possess a possible key to those lost treasures of the
Incas, which ten generations of men have hunted for in vain, what kind
of a bargain would you be inclined to make with me on the strength of
it? Half the rest of your life, I think you said, and as that wouldn't
be very much good to me, suppose we say the half of any treasures we
may discover by the help of our silent friend there? Eh?--will that
suit you?'</p>

<p>'Are you really serious, Djama, or are you only dreaming another of
these wild scientific dreams of yours?' exclaimed the professor, taking
a couple of quick strides towards him. 'What connection can there
possibly be between a mummy, about four centuries years old, and the
lost treasures of the Incas?'</p>

<p>'This man was an Inca, wasn't he?' said the doctor, abruptly, 'and
one of the highest rank, too, from what you have said. He lived just
about the time of the Conquest, didn't he--the time when the priests
stripped their temples, and the nobles emptied their palaces of their
treasures to save them from the Spaniards? Is it not likely that he
would know where, at anyrate, a great part of them was buried? Nay, may
he not even have known the localities of the lost mines that the Incas
got their hundredweights of gold from, and of the emerald mines which
no one has ever been able to find? Why, Lamson, if these dead lips
could speak, I believe they could make you and me millionaires in an
hour. And why shouldn't they speak?'</p>

<p>'Don't talk like that, Djama, for Heaven's sake! It is too serious a
thing to joke about,' said the professor, with a half-frightened glance
in his set and shining eyes. 'I should have thought you, of all men,
knew enough of the facts of life and death not to talk such nonsense as
that.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense!' said the physiologist, interrupting him almost angrily;
'may I not know enough of the facts of life and death, as you call
them, to know that that is not nonsense? But there, it's no use arguing
about things like this. Will you allow this mummy of yours to be made
the subject of--well, we will say, an experiment in physiology?'</p>

<p>'What! the finest and most unique huaca that was ever brought to
Europe-'</p>

<p>'It would only be made finer still by the experiment, even if it
failed. I know what you are going to say, and I will give you my word
of honour, and, if you like, I'll pledge you my professional
reputation, that not a hair of its head shall be injured. Let me take
it to my laboratory, and I promise you solemnly that in a week you
shall have it back, not as it is now, but either the body of your Inca,
as perfect as it was the day he died, or-'</p>

<p>He stopped, and looked hard at his friend, as if wondering what the
effects of his next words would be upon him.</p>

<p>'Or what?' asked the professor, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>'Your Inca prince, roused from his three-hundred-year sleep, and
able to answer your questions and guide us to his lost mines and
treasure houses.'</p>

<p>'Are you in earnest, Djama?' the professor whispered, catching him
by the arm and looking round at the mummy as though he half thought
that the silent witness in the packing-case might be listening to the
words which, if it could have heard, would have had such a terrible
significance for it. 'Do you really mean to say in sober earnest that
there is the remotest chance of your science being able to work such a
miracle as that?'</p>

<p>'A chance, yes,' replied Djama, steadily. 'It is not a certainty, of
course, but I believe it to be possible. Will you let me try?'</p>

<p>'Yes, you shall try,' answered the professor in a voice nothing like
as steady as his. 'If any other man but you had even hinted at such a
thing, I would have seen him--well, in a lunatic asylum first. But
there, I will trust my Inca to you. It seems a fearful thing even to
attempt, and yet, after all, if it fails there will be no harm done,
and if it succeeds--ah, yes, if it succeeds--it will mean-'</p>

<p>'Endless fame for you, my friend, as the recreator of a lost
society, and for both of us wealth, perhaps beyond counting. But stop a
moment--granted success, how shall we talk with our Inca revenant? Have
I not heard you say that the Aymaru dialect of the Quichua tongue is
lost as completely as the Inca treasures?'</p>

<p>'Not quite, though I believe I am now the only white man on earth
who understands it.'</p>

<p>'Good! then let me get to work at once, and in a week--well, in a
week we shall see.'</p>

<h3>II - A PHYSIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT</h3>

<p>LAURENS DJAMA dined with the professor that night, and the small
hours were growing large before they ended the long talk of which their
strange bargain, and the still stranger experiment which was to result
from it, formed the subject. The next day the packing-case containing
the mummy was transferred to Djama's laboratory, and then for a whole
week neither the professor nor any of his friends or acquaintances had
either sight or speech of him.</p>

<p>Every caller at his house in Brondesbury Park was politely but
firmly denied admittance on professional grounds, and three letters and
two telegrams which the professor had sent to him, after being himself
denied admittance, remained unanswered.</p>

<p>At last, on the Thursday following the Friday on which the mummy had
been sent to the laboratory, the professor received a telegram telling
him to come at once to the doctor. Three minutes after he had read it
he was in a hansom and on his way to Kilburn, wondering what it was
that he was to be brought face to face with during the next half
hour.</p>

<p>This time there was no denial. The door opened as he went up the
steps, and the servant handed him a note. He tore it open and
read,--</p>

<p>'Come round to the laboratory and make a new acquaintance who will
yet be an old one.'</p>

<p>His heart stood still, and he caught his breath sharply as he read
the words which told him that the unearthly experiment for which he had
furnished the subject had been successful.</p>

<p>The doctor's laboratory stood apart from the house in the long,
narrow garden at the back, and as he approached the door he stopped for
a moment, and an almost irresistible impulse to go away and have
nothing more to do with the unholy work in hand took possession of him.
Then the love of his science and the longing to hear the marvels which
could only be heard from the lips that had been silent for centuries
overcame his fears, and he went up to the door and knocked softly.</p>

<p>It was opened by a haggard, wild-eyed man, whom he scarcely
recognised as his old friend. Djama did not speak; he simply caught
hold of the sleeve of his coat with a nervous, trembling grasp, drew
him in, shut the door, and led him to a corner of the room where there
was a little camp bed, curtained all round with thin, transparent
muslin, through which he could see the shape of a man lying under the
sheets.</p>

<p>Djama pulled the curtain aside, and said in a hoarse whisper,--</p>

<p>'Look, it has been hard work, and terrible work, too, but I have
succeeded. Do you see, he is breathing!'</p>

<p>The professor stared wide-eyed at the white pillow on which lay the
head of what, a week before, had been his mummy. Now it was the head of
a living man; the pale bronze of the skin was clear and moist with the
dew of life; the lips were no longer brown and dry, but faintly red and
slightly parted, and the counterpane, which was pulled close up under
the chin, was slowly rising and falling with the regular rhythm of a
sleeper's breathing. He looked from the face of him who had been dead
and was alive again to the face of the man whose daring science and
perfect skill had wrought the unholy miracle, and then he shrank back
from the bedside, pulling Djama with him, and whispering,--</p>

<p>'Good God, it is even more awful than it is wonderful! How did you
do it?'</p>

<p>'That is my secret,' whispered Djama, his dry lips shaping
themselves into a ghastly smile, 'and for all the treasures that that
man ever saw, I wouldn't tell it to a living soul, or do such hideous
work again. I tell you I have seen life and death fighting together for
two days and nights in this room--not, mind you, as they fight on a
deathbed, but the other way, and I would rather see a thousand men die
than one more come back out of death into life. You see, he is sleeping
now. He opened his eyes just before daybreak this morning--that's
nearly ten hours ago--but if I lived ten thousand years I should never
forget that one look he gave me before he shut them again. Since then
he has slept, and I stood by that bed testing his pulse and his
breathing for eight hours before I wired you. Then I knew he would
live, and so I sent for you.'</p>

<p>The professor looked at his friend with an involuntary and
unconquerable aversion rising in his heart against him; an aversion
that was half fear, half horror, and then he remembered that he himself
had a share in the fearful work which had been done--a work that could
not now be undone without murder.</p>

<p>With another backward look at the bed, he said, in a whisper that
was almost a smothered groan,--</p>

<p>'When will he wake?'</p>

<p>Before Djama could reply, the question was answered by a faint
rustle, and a low, long-drawn sigh from the bed. They looked and saw
the Inca's face turned towards them, and two fever-bright eyes shining
through the curtains.</p>

<p>'He is awake already, two hours sooner than I expected,' said Djama,
in a voice that he strove vainly to keep steady. 'Come, now, you are
the only man on earth who can talk to him. Let us see if he has come
back to reason as well as to life.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I will try,' said the professor, faintly. He took a couple of
trembling steps. Then the lights in the room began to dance, the
whitewashed walls reeled round him, and he pitched forward and fell
unconscious by the side of the bed.</p>

<p>When he came to himself he was lying on the floor of the laboratory,
out of sight of the bed, behind a great cupboard, glass-doored and
filled with bottles. Djama was kneeling beside him. A strong smell of
ammonia dominated the other smells peculiar to a laboratory, and his
brow was wet with the spirit that Djama was gently rubbing on it with
his hand.</p>

<p>'What have I been doing?' he said, as, with the other's assistance,
he got up into a sitting position and looked stupidly about him. 'It
isn't true, that is it, I really saw--Good God no, it can't be; it's
too horrible. I must have dreamt it.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense, my dear fellow, nonsense! I should have thought you would
have had better nerves than that. Come, take a nip of this, and pull
yourself together. There is nothing so very horrible about it for you.
Now, if you had had the actual work to do-'</p>

<p>'Then it is true! You really have brought him back to life again?
That was him I saw lying on the bed?' He looked up at Djama as he spoke
with a half-inquiring, half-frightened glance. His voice was weak and
unsteady, like the voice of a man who has been stunned by some terrible
shock, and is still dazed with the fear and wonder of it.</p>

<p>'Yes, of course it was,' said Djama; 'but I can tell you, I should
have hesitated before I introduced you so suddenly, if I hadn't thought
that the nerves of an old traveller like you would have been a good
deal stronger than they seem to be. It's a very good job that His
Highness was only about half conscious himself when you collapsed, or
you might have given him a shock that would have killed him again.'</p>

<p>'Again?' said the professor, echoing the last word as he got up
slowly to his feet. 'That sounds queer, doesn't it, to talk of killing
a man again? I am more sorry than I can say that I was weak enough to
let my feelings overcome me in such a ridiculous fashion. However, I am
all right now. Give me another drain of that brandy of yours, and then
let us talk. Is he still awake?'</p>

<p>'No, he dozed off again almost immediately, and you have been here
about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. Do you think you can stand
another look at him?'</p>

<p>'Oh, certainly,' said the professor, who, as a matter of fact, felt
a trifle ashamed of himself and his weakness, and was anxious to do
something that would restore his credit. He followed the doctor out
into the laboratory again, and stood with him for some moments without
speaking by the Inca's bedside. He was sleeping very quietly, and his
breathing seemed to be stronger and deeper than it had been. He had
slightly shifted his position, and was lying now half turned on his
right side, with his right cheek on the pillow.</p>

<p>'You see he has moved,' whispered Djama. 'That shows that muscular
control has been re-established. We shall have him walking about in a
day or so. Ah! he is dreaming, and of something pleasant, too. Look at
his lips moving into a smile. Poor fellow, just fancy a man dreaming of
things that happened three hundred years ago, and waking up to find
himself in another world. I'll be bound he is dreaming about his wife
or sweetheart, and we shall have to tell him, or rather you will, that
she has been a mummy for three centuries. Look now, his lips are
moving; I believe he is going to say something. See if you can hear
what it is?'</p>

<p>The professor stooped down and held his ear so close that he could
feel on his cheek the gentle fanning of the breath that had been still
for three centuries. Then the Inca's lips moved again, and a soft
sighing sound came from them, and in the midst of it he caught the
words,--</p>

<p>'Cori-Coyllur, Nustallipa, &Ntilde;usta mi!'</p>

<p>Then there came a long, gentle sigh. The Inca's lips became still
again, shaped into a very sweet and almost womanly smile, as though his
vision had passed and left him in a happy, dreamless slumber.</p>

<p>'What did he say?' whispered Djama. 'Were you able to understand
it?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the professor, 'yes, and you were right about the
subject of his dream. Come away, in case we wake him, and I will tell
you.'</p>

<p>They went to the other end of the laboratory, and the professor went
on, still speaking in a low, half-whisper,--</p>

<p>'Poor fellow, I am afraid we have incurred a terribly heavy debt to
him. What he said meant, "Golden Star, my princess, my darling!" So you
see you were right, but poor Golden Star has been dead three hundred
years and more--that is, at least, if his Golden Star is the same as
the heroine of the tradition.'</p>

<p>'What tradition?' asked Djama.</p>

<p>'It's too long a story to tell you now, but if she is the same, then
our Inca's name is Vilcaroya, and he is the hero of the strangest
story, and, thanks to you, the strangest fate that the wildest romancer
could imagine. However, the story must keep, for I wouldn't spoil it by
cutting it short. The principal question now is--what are we going to
do with him? We can't keep him here, of course?'</p>

<p>No, certainly not,' replied Djama, with knitted brows and faintly
smiling lips. 'His Highness must be cared for in accordance with his
rank and our expectations. I shall have him taken into the house and
properly nursed.'</p>

<p>'But what about your sister? You will frighten her to death if you
take in a living patient that has been dead for three hundred
years.'</p>

<p>'Not if we manage it properly; there will be no need to tell Ruth
the story yet, at anyrate. I'll tell her that I am going to receive a
patient who is suffering from a mysterious disease unknown to medical
science. I'll say I picked him up in the Oriental Home in Whitechapel,
and have brought him here to study him, and you and I must smuggle him
into the house and put him to bed some time when she is out of the way.
Then I'll instal her as nurse; in fact, she will do that for herself;
and as there is no chance of her learning anything from him, we can
break the truth to her by degrees, and when His Highness is well enough
to travel we'll all be off to Peru and come back millionaires, if you
can only persuade him to tell you the secret of his
treasure-houses.'</p>

<p>That night the doctor and the professor took turns in watching by
the bedside of their strange patient, whose slumber became lighter and
lighter until, towards midnight, he got so restless and apparently
uneasy that Djama considered that the time had come to wake him and see
if he was able to take any nourishment. So he set the professor to
work, warming some chicken broth over a spirit lamp, and mixing a
little champagne and soda-water in one glass and brandy and water in
another. Meanwhile, he filled a hypodermic syringe with colourless
fluid out of a little stoppered bottle, and then turned the sheet down
and injected the contents of the syringe under the smooth, bronze skin
of the Inca's shoulder. He moved slightly at the prick of the needle,
then he drew two or three deep breaths, and suddenly sat up in bed and
stared about him with wide open eyes, full, as they well might be, of
inquiring wonder.</p>

<p>The professor, who had turned at the sound of the hurried breathing,
saw him as he raised himself, and heard him say in the clear and
somewhat high-pitched tone of a dweller among the mountains,--</p>

<p>"Am I only dreaming that the death-sleep is over?"</p>

<p>'Has the morning dawned again for the Children of the Sun? Am I
truly awake, or am I only dreaming that the death-sleep is over? Where
is Golden Star, and where am I? Tell me--you who have doubtless brought
me back to the life we forsook together--was it last night or how many
nights or moons ago?'</p>

<p>The words came slowly at first, like those of a man still on the
borderland between sleep and waking; but each one was spoken more
clearly and decisively than the one before it, and the last sentence
was uttered in the strong, steady tones of a man in full possession of
his faculties.</p>

<p>'Come here, Lamson,' said Djama, a trifle nervously; 'bring the soup
with you, and some brandy, though I don't think he needs it. Do you
understand what he said?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied the professor, coming to the bedside with a cup of
soup in one hand and a glass of brandy and water in the other. Both
hands trembled as he set the cup and the glass down on a little table.
He looked at the Inca like a man looking at a re-embodied spirit, and
said to him in Quichua,--</p>

<p>I am not he who has brought you back to life, but my friend here,
who is a great and skilled physician, and master of the arts of life
and death. You are in his house, and safe, for we are friends, and have
nursed you back to health and waking life after your long sleep.'</p>

<p>'But Golden Star,' said the Inca, interrupting him with a flash of
impatience in his eyes. Where is she--my bride who went with me into
the shades of death? Have you not brought her, too, back to life?'</p>

<p>The professor stared in silence at the strange speaker of these
strange words, which told him so plainly that the old legend of the
death-bridal of Vilcaroya-Inca and Golden Star was now no legend at
all, but a true story which had come down almost unchanged from
generation to generation. Then an infinite pity filled his heart for
this lonely wanderer from another age, whose friends and kindred had
been dead for centuries, and whose very nation was now only a shadowy
name on a half-forgotten page of history.</p>

<p>'What does he say?' said Djama, breaking in upon his reverie. 'I
suppose he wants to know where he is, and what has become of that
sweetheart of his he was dreaming about?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied the professor; 'but you won't understand properly
until I have told you the story. Poor fellow! I suppose we shall have
to tell him the ghastly truth. Good Heavens! fancy telling a man that
his wife has been dead for three hundred years or more! Look here,
Djama, this business can't stop here, you know. What a fool I was,
after all, not to see if there wasn't another chamber beside the one I
found him in! Of course there must be, and I have no doubt she is lying
there at this present moment. We shall have to go and find her, and you
must restore her as you have done him. Phew! where is it all going to
end, I wonder!'</p>

<p>'And suppose we can't find her, or suppose I fail, even if I can
bring myself to undertake that horrible work all over again?' said
Djama, looking almost fearfully at the Inca, who was still sitting up
in the bed glancing mutely from one to the other, as though waiting for
an answer to his question. Then, keeping his voice as steady as he
could, the professor told him the story of his resuscitation,
addressing him by his own name and ending by asking him if he
remembered when he and Golden Star had devoted themselves to die
together, as the tradition said they had done.</p>

<p>'Yes, I remember!' said Vilcaroya, with brightening eyes and faintly
flushing cheeks. 'How could I forget it? It was when the bearded
strangers from the north had come and taken the usurper Atahuallpa
prisoner in the midst of his conquering host at Cajamarca. It was after
the Inca Huascar had been slain by stealth with a traitor's knife. It
was on the night of the feast of Raymi, when our Father the Sun had
left the Sacred Fleece unkindled, and when was fulfilled the prophecy
that the night should fall over the land of the Children of the Sun.
Now, tell me, you who speak the language of my people, how long have I
been sleeping?'</p>

<p>Instead of replying directly, he offered the Inca the cup of broth,
and asked him first to take the nourishment that he must need so
greatly after his long fast, telling him that it was needful to prevent
him losing his new-found strength again. When he had eaten and drunk a
little, then he would tell him what he could.</p>

<p>He took the broth and a little bread obediently, and while he was
eating and drinking, the professor translated what he had said to the
doctor. When he had finished, Djama looked at the Inca, sitting there
taking food and drink like any other human being, and with evident
relish, too, and said,--</p>

<p>'That happened in 1532--three hundred and sixty-five years ago! It
sounds utterly incredible, doesn't it, and yet there he is, eating and
drinking and talking with us just like any other man. I can hardly
believe the work of my own hands, and I am beginning to half wish I had
never begun it. Just imagine the awful loneliness to which we shall
have condemned this poor fellow, supposing we can't find his Golden
Star and restore her to him! Still perhaps you had better tell him the
truth at once. I think he can stand it. He has been a long time coming
round, but I don't think there is much the matter with him now.</p>

<p>Then the professor told Vilcaroya theto him, so terrible truth, that
of all men in the world he was the most lonely, separated as he was
from all that he had known and loved by an impassable gulf of nearly
four long centuries--that his well-loved Golden Star was but a memory
known to few, a name in a vague tradition; that the resting-place, even
of her mummy, was unknown, and that all that the darkest prophecy could
have foretold had in very truth fallen upon the land of the Incas and
the Children of the Sun.</p>

<p>Vilcaroya heard him to the end in silence; then, raising his hands
to his forehead, he bowed his head and said,--</p>

<p>'It is the will of our Father, foretold by the lips of his priests,
but other things were foretold which shall be fulfilled as well as
these. Golden Star is not dead; she only sleeps as I did. If I have
awakened, why shall not she? I know where she lies--where Anda-Huillac
swore to me they would lay her. Come, let us go! I will take you to the
place, and you shall restore her to me, warm and living and loving as
she was when I kissed her good-bye in the Sanctuary of the Sun, and I
will give you treasures of gold and silver and jewels such as you have
never dreamed of in exchange for her.'</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF VILCAROYA</h2>

<h2>CHAPTER I - BACK THROUGH THE SHADOWS</h2>

<p>As the time passes between dreaming and waking, so for me did the
long years pass, flowing like a smooth and silent stream seen from
afar, out of the darkness that fell so slowly and so sweetly over my
eyes that night when I sank into the death-trance beside Golden Star,
my beloved, in the bridal chamber that they made for us in the Temple
of the Sun, into the light that shone into them when they opened upon a
scene so different, and saw a white, haggard face bending over me, and
two black, burning eyes looking into them.</p>

<p>Then I closed them again and slept, and when I woke again there were
two faces looking at me, both white and full of fear and wonder, and I
saw two beings who seemed very strange to me, such as I had never seen
among the Children of the Sun, standing by the couch on which I lay,
and one of them fell down as though sore stricken, and I tried to think
what this could mean, and, thinking, fell asleep again.</p>

<p>Then I dreamt a long, sweet dream of the days that I now know were
far past, when I, Vilcaroya, son of the great Huayna-Capac, lived in
the Land of the Four Regions, a prince among princes, a warrior and a
child of the Sacred Race, whose blood had flowed unmixed through many
generations from the divine fountain of life and light, our Father the
Sun. I dreamt of Golden Star, and the days when I loved her in timid
silence, for she was the fairest of all our race, and so, as it seemed
to me, destined to no less a lot than the motherhood of a long line of
Incas, in whom should live and grow to ever greater splendour the
glories of the race that owned no earthly origin.</p>

<p>I called her in my dream, but she made no answer. I saw her lying by
my side in that well-remembered chamber, with the shadowy forms of the
priests standing about us as I had seen them long before; but, alas!
she lay still with closed eyes and lips which seemed to have forgotten
how sweetly they once could smile. I whispered her name, mingled with
many a loving word, into her ear, and still she moved not. I put my
arms about her and kissed her, and instantly I shrank back shivering
with a fear unspeakable, for the form that should have been so warm and
soft and yielding, was chilled and pulseless and rigid, as though some
foul magic had changed it into stone, and the lips that should have
given me back kiss for kiss were still and cold and senseless.</p>

<p>Then I saw, as it seemed with half-closed eyes, that dear shape of
hers being borne away from me, while I, longing to snatch her from the
hands of those who were robbing me of her, yet lay helpless on the
couch, without strength to move or speak, until all grew dim around me,
and I felt myself raised by invisible hands, and borne far away through
the darkness--and so my dream melted away into the night of sleep.</p>

<p>Then, yet again, I woke and saw the two strange men that I had seen
before, and one came and spoke to me kindly in my own tongue, and
called me by my own name, and gave me food and drink, and told me in a
few, but to me terrible, words that the dreams I had dreamed were
dreams indeed--dreams of a time that was long gone by, of things that
had passed away, perchance for ever, and men and women whose names were
only memories.</p>

<p>Thus did I come from the evening of one age into the morning of
another, falling asleep in the prime of my strength and manhood, and
waking again even as I had fallen asleep--though those who had closed
my eyes had been dead for many generations, and the name of our ancient
race was but a bitter memory to the sons and daughters of my own land
amidst the mountains.</p>

<p>Then I went forth into the wondrous new world into which I had
awakened, the world which you who read this hold so common, and which I
found crowded with wonders so many and marvellous that if it had not
been for the loving care of her who guided my first footsteps on my new
journey, as she might have guided those of a little child, my
re-awakening reason must soon have been quenched in the night of
madness.</p>

<p>Many and strange as were the things that happened to me during the
first days and months of my awakening, there is little need that I
should now write of them at any length. Yet something I must say of
them in order that the still stranger things of which I shall have to
tell may be the better understood.</p>

<p>And first I must tell of her whose gentle hand led me from weakness
to strength, and guided my unwonted footsteps through the mazes of that
new wonderland in which I had awakened, and from whose lips I learnt
the first words that I spoke of the strong and stately English speech
in which I am striving so lamely and imperfectly to write down the
story of my new life.</p>

<p>This was Ruth, the sister of Djama, whose smile was the first ray of
sunshine that shone into my second life, and whose laugh was so sweet
and gladsome, that when it first sounded in my ears, like an echo from
the dear dead past, I named her forthwith Cusi-Coyllur, which in
English means Joyful Star--after that royal maiden of my own race who
loved the handsome rebel Ollantay, and, refusing all others, waited for
him in the House of the Virgins of the Sun until he came in triumph to
claim her. She came with us to the south, rejecting all contrary
counsel and braving the labours of the long, toilsome journey, so that
she might be the first woman to welcome Golden Star back into the world
of life.</p>

<p>Yet what words can I find in this new speech that I have yet but
half learnt to tell fitly of her beauty and sweet graciousness, and of
all the magic which made her seem in my eyes like an angel that had
come down from the Mansions of the Sun to greet me in a world in which
I was a stranger? Better that you who may read what I write should
learn to know her for yourself through the sweetness and grace of her
own words and deeds, as I shall strive, however unworthily, to tell of
them. So, then, let it be.</p>

<p>But there is another of whom I must say something before I go on to
tell of my return to my own land--now, alas! mine no longer--and that
is Francis Hartness, a captain among the warriors of the English, and a
friend of him who was called the professor, because of his learning--he
who had helped Djama to bring me back into the world of living men.</p>

<p>He was a man of about thirty years, tall of stature and strong of
limb, brief of speech and straight of tongue, with eyes as blue as the
skies which shine on Yucay, and hair and beard golden and bright as the
rays which flow from the smile of our Father the Sun. Him we met by
chance one evening in the square of the town which is called Panama,
named, they told me, after that older city, whence the conquerors of my
people sailed to ravish the realms of Huayna-Capac. There was peace in
his own land and all the neighbouring countries, and so he was
journeying to the region which is now called South America, where the
descendants of the Spaniards are nearly always fighting among
themselves over the spoils of my people, to see what work he could find
to keep his sword from rusting.</p>

<p>As he was greatly skilled in that strange, new warfare of flame and
thunder and far-smiting bolts, which had but begun to be when our
Father the Sun hid his face from the eyes of his children, I took
counsel with Joyful Star--who was ever my wisest as well as my most
faithful guide in all things--and we together told him my story as we
went south, and after that I had asked him if he would help me in the
task which I was going to essay, which was nothing less than the taking
back of the land of my fathers, and the raising of the children of my
people to the ancient glories of that state which I alone of living men
remembered. To this, after some shrewd questioning, he consented--for
it was a desperate venture, such as his brave heart loved--and when he
had given me his hand on it, and promised, after the simple fashion of
his nation, to be true to me in peace and war, I told him of the means
that I could employ to gain my end, and how I would use that lust of
gold which had led to the ruin of my people, so that it should conquer
the children of their conquerors and give me back the empire that had
been my father's.</p>

<p>At Panama we took ship again and travelled swiftly and straightly
south, driven by that wondrous power which had come into the world to
serve men like a tireless giant since I had fallen asleep; and day
after day on the southward voyage I walked alone up and down the deck,
or stood gazing, rapt in thought, at the desert foreshore along which
the steamer was running, and at the great masses of the dark brown
barren mountains, as they towered range beyond range till they
overtopped the clouds themselves and stood serene and sharply outlined
against the blue background of the upper sky.</p>

<p>Behind those mighty, rock-built ramparts lay the well-loved,
well-remembered land over which my fathers had ruled in the days of
peace, before the stranger and the oppressor had come. On the other
side of them I knew that I was now fated to find only the poor
fragments of the great cities and stately pleasure-houses that I had
known in all their strength and beauty--only the silent and deserted
ruins of the mighty fortresses which had guarded the confines of our
lost empire, and were the portals through which the Children of the Sun
had marched to unvarying conquest.</p>

<p>I thought, too, of the broad, green, level plain of Cajamarca,
surrounded by its guardian ramparts of terraced hills; of the long,
verdant valley of Cuzco with its hundred towns and villages nestling
amidst the foliage which shaded their streets and squares, and looking
out over the level fields of the valley and the countless tiers of
terraces that rose green and gold with maize, or glowing with flowers,
to the summits of the hills; and of that earthly paradise of Yucay,
wherein the Gardens of the Sun, the golden shrines of my ancient faith,
and the wondrous pleasure-palaces of many generations of Incas had
glowed in almost heavenly beauty, embosomed in green and gold and
scarlet in the midst of inaccessible mountains which themselves were
overtopped by the mighty peaks of eternal snow that I had so often seen
glimmering white and ghostly in the moonlight, like guardian spirits
round an enchanted realm, on many a night of delicious revelry now far
past and lost in the swift flood of the years that had rolled by since
then.</p>

<p>It was to the poor remnants of all these glories that I was
returning--returning to find, as they had told me, the homes of my
ancestors laid waste and the descendants of my people the slaves of
strangers. The desolation which it had taken centuries to accomplish
would be to me but the swift, magical change of a day and a night and a
morning.</p>

<p>Think, you who read, of the dread and the horror of it! I had seen
the last day of the stately empire of my fathers the Incas! I had
fallen asleep and I had awakened, and now, on the morrow of my sleep, I
was coming back to the silent and ghastly ruins which the slow,
pitiless work of the years and centuries had left behind it!</p>

<p>But over the gulf of these same centuries the hand of my Father the
Sun was swiftly stretched out to help and uphold me, for no sooner did
I again tread that soil which had once been sacred to Him, than my
fainting heart grew strong with the memory of that ancient prophecy
which I had come to fulfil, and of which this new life of mine was of
itself a part fulfilment. If one part, and that not the least, had
already been made good, then why not the rest?</p>

<p>Far away behind those towering tiers of mountains lay Golden Star in
that resting-place to which she had been borne with me, sleeping
soundly in the impassive embrace of their mighty arms; and within the
safe-keeping of those arms lay, too, that uncounted treasure, that vast
legacy which the long-dead leaders of my people had bequeathed to me
for the sacred purpose of restoring those glories which all men, save
myself, believed to be but a dream of the distant past, that
incomparable inheritance of which I was the sole lawful heir on earth,
and which I was coming to share with Golden Star when I had once more
raised the Rainbow Banner above the restored throne of the divine
Manco.</p>

<p>As I thought of all this, the blood that had lain stagnant through
the long years of my magical death-sleep began to pulse like living
fire through my veins. My new life with all its marvels became
glorified into a waking vision of new conquests and re-won empire. The
past was a dream both sweet and bitter in its vivid memories, but still
a dream that had been dreamt and was done with. The present and the
future were realities, golden and glorious with a hope justified by the
miracle that had made them possible. I had learnt enough of the new age
in which I had awakened to know that the lust of gold which had brought
the conqueror and the oppressor into the land of the children of the
Sun burnt every whit as fiercely in the hearts of the men who were
living now as it had done in theirs, and that lust, as I had told
Hartness and the others, should now work for me and for the redemption
of my people so that that which had been their ruin should yet prove
their salvation.</p>

<p>Thus, through the long sunny days and cool, starlit nights did I,
Vilcaroya, last of the Incas, muse and dream until I once more stood in
the Land of the Four Regions, hale and strong, and burning with the
ardour of my sacred mission, ready to dare and do all things, and to
use without ruth or scruple that dread power which would so soon lie
within my hands to fulfil my oath and Golden Star's, and to accomplish
the work that I had come through the shadows of death to do.</p>

<p>So I came back to the shores of that well-loved land of mine which,
by the reckoning of the new time into which I had come, had been for
more than three hundred years the sport and prey of the generations of
strangers and oppressors who had followed those first conquerors of the
Children of the Sun, whose coming had sounded the hour of doom and ruin
through the length and breadth of that glorious land of green plains
and verdant valleys, of terraced hills and towering mountains, which
had once been our empire and our home.</p>

<p>From the mean coast town of wooden houses where the railway begins
we travelled ever upward over great, grey, sloping deserts, and by
rugged ravines with steep, broken walls of red earth and ragged rock;
through range after range of mountains that were all strange and
hateful to me, until we swung round the shoulder of a great
crag-crowned mountain, and I saw across a vast plain, into which range
after range of lesser hills sloped down, the crystal-white peaks of the
snow-mountains towering far beyond the clouds into the blue sky above
them.</p>

<p>Then I knew that I was coming nearer to the land that had once been
mine, and ere many hours had passed we stopped in a great city which
still bore its old name of Arequipa, the Place of Rest, which my own
ancestors had given to it. It was no longer the place of palaces and
pleasure-houses, of flowery gardens and leafy woods that I had seen it,
but above it still gleamed the white snow-fields and shining peaks of
Charchani and Pichu-Pichu, and between the two great white ranges still
towered the vast, black, snow-crowned cone of Misti, the
smoke-mountain, rising sheer in its lonely grandeur twelve thousand
feet above the sloping plain on which the city lay.</p>

<p>As I looked at it again for the first time after so many years, I
asked the professor, as we all called him, if, since I had been asleep,
the mountain had been rent asunder again as it had been in the olden
times, long before the Spaniards came to seek gold and blood in the
Land of the Four Regions. He was very learned in such matters, even as
Djama, his friend, was learned in secrets of life and death, and when
he told me that the fires within it had slept for more years than men
could remember, I was glad. Yet I said nothing of my inward joy, for
had I told them all that I knew about the valley of black sand and
yellow rock that was hidden behind the far-off wall of snow which shone
so whitely against the blue of the midway heaven, it might have been
many a long day before we had again set out on our journey towards the
place that was the goal at once of my hopes and fears.</p>

<p>We stayed seven days in Arequipa, making our last preparations for
the work that lay before us and then we went on again by train to
Sicuani, in the valley of the Vilcariota. Then from Sicuani we
journeyed on by road, riding on mules through a land that was lovely
even in my eyes, though its loveliness was to me only the beauty of
ruin and decay, for this was the heart and centre of that vanished
empire whose glories no living eyes but mine had ever seen.</p>

<p>I saw wildernesses where there had been gardens, and gaunt, treeless
mountains lying bare to the glare of the sun. Lakes that had shone
encircled with gardens now spread out dull and stagnant over the
neglected fields. A few ragged fragments of grey clay walls still rose
from the green plain of Cacha, where I had last seen, in all its glory
of gold and rainbow colours, the holy Temple of Viracocha; and the
great guardian fortress of Piquillacta, which I had seen stretching its
impregnable length and rearing its unscalable height from mountain to
mountain across the entrance to the once lovely valley of Cuzco, lay, a
huge ragged mass of towering ruins, splendid even in decay.</p>

<p>As we passed through the one half-choked portal that still lay open,
I thought, with heavy heart and bowed-down head, of the great fortress
as I had seen it in the glory of its pride and strength, of the gallant
warriors that had defended it, and the gay processions that I had seen
winding in and out of its stately gates, making its hoary walls ring
with songs and laughter, and, farther on, as we rode along the valley
on that sad and yet eager three days' march of ours, I saw, on the
hill-spurs about me, the black and ragged ruins of the fair cities and
stately temples and palaces that I had seen crowded with happy throngs,
bright with gold and colours, and so fair and strong that no man could
have dreamed of the ruin the oppressor had brought upon them.</p>

<p>And so, journeying amidst all these sad memories through a land
which, for me, was peopled with the ghosts of my long-dead friends and
kindred, we came out at length on the broad, green Plain of the Oracle,
and there before me, still nestling under her guardian hills, lay,
glimmering white and grey under the slanting sun-rays, all that was
left of what had once been Cuzco, the City of the Sun and the home of
his children. Then, as I lifted my eyes and gazed upon it through the
rising mist of my tears, I bowed my bared head towards it and swore, in
the sadness and silence of my desolate heart, that, to the full extent
of the power which I believed was soon to be mine, I would take life
for life and blood for blood, and I would give sorrow for sorrow and
shame for shame, until I had paid to the full the debt which the long
years of plunder and cruelty and oppression had heaped up against those
who, from generation to generation, had brought this shame and ruin on
the once bright home of the Children of the Sun.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II - BROTHERS OF THE BLOOD</h2>

<p>I SHALL not weary you who perchance may some day read this story of
mine by dwelling on the sorrow and shame that filled me as I entered
the foul, unlovely streets, and saw the filthy refuse in the squares of
the city that I remembered so pure and bright and beautiful; nor yet by
telling of the feelings that possessed me when I saw the poor remains
of our desecrated temples, the places where our vanished palaces had
stood, and the dismantled ruins of that mighty fortress of Sacsahuaman,
which I had last seen standing palace-crowned and throned in all its
grandeur high up above the city.</p>

<p>All this and more you who read must picture for yourselves, for I
have greater things to tell of than the poor sorrows of a wanderer who
had left his own age and his own kindred far behind him, and who had
come back into a strange world to find his country a wilderness, and
the children of his people the slaves of strangers.</p>

<p>It had been settled amongst us that, for the purpose for which we
had come, it would be necessary to hire a house that should be at once
commodious for our work, sufficiently removed from the city for
privacy, and capable of defence against intruders if need be. The
professor, being already known in Cuzco as a man of science and seeker
after antiquities, and possessing, moreover, a special permit from the
Government in Lima to travel and dwell in the interior, and make such
searches as he thought fit, undertook the business of finding such a
house. He made many journeys in quest of what he sought, and on these
journeys Djama always accompanied him, since he had to see that the
house chosen contained a chamber suitable for that precious work which
he had undertaken to do in return for the share of treasure that I was
to give to him.</p>

<p>And while these two were absent I at times wandered about the city
with Joyful Star and Francis Hartness, who, it was plain to see,
already looked with eyes of love and longing on her beauty, as in good
truth I myself could have done had I dared, and could I have forgotten
that older love of mine who still lay cold in her death-sleep in the
cave by the lake yonder, over the mountains to the westward, whither I
had already cast so many longing glances. But at other times I left
them to go upon my own ways, for I had work on hand which, for the
present, did not concern them.</p>

<p>I had by this time met and conversed with many of my people in their
own language, which was that of the labouring classes of my own times,
and from them I had learned that at a village called San Sebastian,
through which we had passed, about two leagues to the south of the
city, there still dwelt many families of Ayllos--that is to say, the
descendants of those of the old noble Inca lineage, who had been
permitted by their conquerors to settle here. So one morning I went to
visit an old Indian--as they now called all our people--named Ullullo,
with whom I had made acquaintance, and at his house I dressed myself in
the native fashion--in an old shirt and short trousers, with sandals on
my feet, and a broad-brimmed, fringed hat on my head, and covered
myself with a faded poncho, and together we went on foot to San
Sebastian, I looking no different from the rest of the Indians who were
passing to and fro upon the road.</p>

<p>I had already seen, while riding through the village, that the
people were different to those of all other villages that we had come
through on the way. They were taller of stature, prouder of carriage,
and fairer of face. The blood showed red in their cheeks through the
light brown of their skin, and these signs had told me that if any
remnant of the pure Inca race was left these must be they; and I was
soon to have proof that it was so, although the children of those who
had lived in palaces were now dwelling in huts of mud and reeds.</p>

<p>Ullullo led me first to the house of a man named Tupac Rayca, who
was chief among the Indians of the town. He was great-grandson of that
ill-fated Tupac-Amaru, who, as you know, had revolted many years before
against the oppressors of his race, and for this, after being forced to
watch the torture and murder of his wife in the square of Cuzco, had
himself been torn limb from limb by horses.</p>

<p>We found him alone in a bare room in one of the better houses of the
village. As he stood up to salute us it needed but a glance to tell me
that in his veins at least the ancient blood of our race flowed well
nigh as purely as it did in my own. Had it not been for the meanness of
his clothing and the dull, brooding look on his noble features--the
stamp of generations of oppression--I could have pictured him with the
yellow Llautu* on his brow, the golden image of the Sun on his girdled
tunic, and the rainbow banner in his hand, standing amongst the guards
of the great Huayna-Capac himself.</p>

<p>* The yellow Llautu, or fringed turban of wool, worn on the brows,
was the distinguishing mark of the sacred Inca race. The scarlet was
worn only by the reigning Inca--'Son of the Sun.' Its fringe, called
the 'borla,' was mingled with threads of gold.</p>

<p>I asked Ullullo to leave us alone for a little while, and when he
had gone I stepped forward, and, drawing myself up to my full height, I
looked him in the eyes, and said in the tongue that was spoken only by
those of the divine Inca race,--</p>

<p>'Tell me, Tupac-Rayca, does a remnant of the Children of the Sun
still dwell in the Land of the Four Regions, and are they still
faithful to the traditions of their race, and the faith of their
ancestors?'</p>

<p>As the words left my lips he staggered back a pace or two with his
hands clasped to his forehead, staring at me from under them as
though--as in very truth I was--some spirit of the past stood
re-embodied before him. Then, coming forward again and scanning me
eagerly from head to foot, he whispered in the same tongue--by the Lord
of Light how those familiar accents thrilled my ears as I heard them
again after so long!</p>

<p>'Who are you--a stranger--that comes in the image of those long
dead, to ask me such a question in the tongue that may only be spoken
when none save those of the Blood are present?'</p>

<p>'One who is of the Blood himself!' I answered, taking a stride
towards him, and stretching out my hand. 'Fear not, Tupac-Rayca, son of
him that suffered, I am a friend, and have come from afar to work as a
friend with you and others of the Blood that may still be left in the
land, with a great and holy purpose of which you shall know ere
long.'</p>

<p>He grasped my hand and bowed over it in silence for a while. Then he
stepped back and looked at me again, murmuring,--</p>

<p>'Can it be so? Has the divine Manco come back from the Mansions of
the Sun to save the remnant of his children, or has Vilcaroya broken
the bonds of his death-sleep and come to fulfil the oath he swore with
Golden Star before the altar in the Sanctuary? I know all the Children
of the Blood that are left in the land, and I have never seen your face
before, yet you are of the Blood. Who are you--Lord?'</p>

<p>The last word seemed forced from his lips by some power other than
his own will, and it sounded most pleasant to me, for it told me that,
without knowing my name, and seeing me only as a stranger, he had
recognised the stamp of my divine ancestry, and this promised well for
the progress of the work I had in hand. I answered him kindly, and yet
as one speaking to another who is scarce his equal, and said,--</p>

<p>My name matters not now or here, Tupac, for we are but two, and I
might lie to you, and you would have no proof of my truth or falsehood.
But if you will do as I bid you, to-night you shall know and all shall
be made plain and with ample proof. Are you willing to give me your
aid?'</p>

<p>He picked up a rude hoe that stood in a corner of the room, and
laying it across his shoulder after the manner of one who bears a
burden, bowed his head and answered,--</p>

<p>'The Son of the Sun has but to speak, and I and all his slaves will
obey.'</p>

<p>What he had done was an act of homage, which, in the olden time, was
paid only to him who wore the imperial Llautu, and proved to me how
faithfully the old traditions had been preserved in secret.</p>

<p>'That is well said, Tupac,' I replied, speaking now as a sovereign
might speak to a faithful subject, 'and in the days to come fear not
that I shall forget this, your first act of unasked-for homage. Now,
hear me. Are there twenty men of the Blood in this village--men who are
faithful and can be trusted even to the death?'</p>

<p>'There are five hundred here, Lord, and as many thousands within the
valley, whose blood has flowed pure from the olden times, unpolluted by
a single stain of Spanish dirt. What would you with them?'</p>

<p>I asked not for hundreds or thousands,' I said, right glad at heart
to hear such good tidings. 'For the present I need but a score, so do
you choose me twenty of the noblest blood and the best judgment, and an
hour before midnight let them be with you on the plain behind the
Sacsahuaman. Let them come well provided with torches or candles, and
tools, levers, and hammers and spades. Tell them what has passed
between us, but nothing of the guesses that you may have made in your
own mind while we have been talking, and leave the rest to me. Can you
do that?'</p>

<p>It shall be done, Lord,' he answered, still bending before me with
the shaft of the hoe across his shoulders, 'and we will wait and toil
in patience till the Son of the Sun shall please to reveal himself to
the eyes of his servants.'</p>

<p>Nor shall you have to wait long,' I said. 'Now put that off your
back and take my hand again, for we are not Inca and servant yet, only
two men of the Blood, and brothers of a fallen race who are joined
together to perform a holy work. Now farewell, Tupac, till to-night.
Choose your companions well, and fear not but that your services and
your faithfulness shall have their due reward.'</p>

<p>He put his hand humbly and tremblingly into mine, bowing low over
it, and so I left him, standing there with bent head, not daring to
look up until the door closed behind me. Then Ullullo and I went back
into the city, and as we crossed the great square on our way to
Ullullo's house, I saw my four English friends standing among the
market people by the fountain in the centre. We passed close to them,
and I heard my name spoken by Joyful Star to her brother, who answered
her and said,--</p>

<p>'I daresay we shall find he is making friends again with some of
these filthy Indian compatriots of his.'</p>

<p>I hated him from that moment for his bitter words, and swore in my
heart that some day he should pay for them, for I loved my people, and
pitied them in their misery and degradation. I stopped beside them, and
my heart was beating hard as I listened for what Joyful Star would say,
and I have remembered her words, even as I have remembered his. She
looked at him with the light of anger in her eyes and said,--</p>

<p>'For shame, Laurens! I couldn't have believed that you would have
said such a thing. If you belonged to a race that had been enslaved and
plundered by these brutes of Spaniards and Peruvians for three
centuries and a half, do you think you would be any better than these
poor fellows? And, besides, whatever they are, they are Vilcaroya's
people, and he is our friend.'</p>

<p>I could have fallen on the stones and kissed her feet for those
sweet words of hers, and I moved away quickly for fear I should betray
myself, and went with a swelling heart and mingled tears of love and
anger in my eyes to old Ullullo's house, where I changed my clothes
again, and then, as it was nearly dinner time, which, as you know, is
in the evening in Spanish countries, I went back to the house where we
were lodging, wondering what they would think if they could have
understood the words that had passed between Tupac-Rayca and
myself.</p>

<p>When I met them again I saw that they would willingly have learned
what had become of me during the day, but I answered their inquiries by
telling them nothing more and yet a great deal less than the truth, and
saying that I had spent the day revisiting old scenes, and learning
what I could of the present condition of my people. This satisfied them
outwardly at least, though I saw a look in Djama's eyes which told me
that he suspected more of the truth than it suited my purpose to tell
him.</p>

<p>Then our conversation turned to the matter of procuring a house,
such as I have spoken of, and the professor told me that he had heard
of a hacienda, well built and solid, and standing in its own domain,
about three leagues across the valley to the westward, on a secluded
little plain among the hills, which would serve our purpose
excellently; but the owner of it wished to sell it, and 'with the
stupidity of these Peruvians,' as he said, would not hire it out to us
but would only sell it, and the price was twenty thousand soles, or
dollars of Peru, which was two thousand pounds in English money.</p>

<p>It is a great pity,' said the professor, when he had finished
telling me about it, 'for it doesn't seem as though there was another
house in the neighbourhood of Cuzco that would suit our purpose, and
this one would do perfectly.'</p>

<p>'Of course, if the fellow won't let it there's no use thinking any
more about the matter, for two thousand pounds is entirely out of the
question. It seems to me that the expedition will be quite expensive
enough without the luxury of buying houses at fancy prices.'</p>

<p>It was Djama who spoke. No one else at our table could have spoken
like that. I heard him in silence, for I could not trust myself to
speak for the anger that was rising within me. I saw Joyful Star raise
her eyelids and look at him with a swift glance that meant much; but
she, too, said nothing; and then, looking at me, he spoke again and
said,--</p>

<p>'Of course, if His Highness'--for so he always spoke of me when no
strangers were present--'would just unlock one of those treasure-houses
of his, the matter would be easy enough, but I suppose that's outside
the contract.'</p>

<p>I still kept silence, knowing as I did what the night was to bring
forth. But Francis Hartness answered for me, and said,--</p>

<p>'I don't think you can quite put it that way, Djama, if you'll
excuse me saying so. If I am not mistaken, it has been clearly
understood that the first treasure-house to be unlocked is the one that
holds Vilcaroya's greatest treasure--his wife--and what you say seems
to suggest--'</p>

<p>'It is enough!' I said, unconsciously speaking in my growing anger
in the same imperious tone that I had used but a few hours before to
Tupac. 'Let the house be bought. I will charge myself with the cost,
and I will be the debtor of my friends no longer.'</p>

<p>They stared at me as I spoke, for hitherto I had spoken to them as a
child rather than as a man; as an inferior, rather than as an equal. I
saw a smile that was not pleasant to look upon pass swiftly over
Djama's mouth, but he kept silence, and the professor said to me,--</p>

<p>'Are you really in earnest, Vilcaroya? You know, according to our
bargain, we have no claim on you until our part of the work is done.
None of us have any desire to learn your secrets.'</p>

<p>I am not talking of secrets,' I said, breaking into his speech, 'and
one of my race does not speak to make a liar of himself. What I say I
can do and will, for I wish the work to begin at once. Do you think I
have not waited long enough for my beloved, my sister and my wife?'</p>

<p>'Your what!' cried Joyful Star, rising suddenly from her seat, and
staring at me with fixed and wide-opened eyes. 'Your sister! Oh,
Vilcaroya, surely this is not true!' and as she said this I saw her
cheeks grow pale and her lips tremble.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I answered, 'it is true. Why should I lie to my new sister
and friend, Joyful Star? Golden Star was the daughter of my father, the
great Huayna-Capac, though our mothers were not the same.'</p>

<p>I had no time to finish my speech, for with a look of unutterable
horror in her eyes, which pierced me to the heart and seemed to sever
it in twain, she cried,--</p>

<p>'Oh, no, no! that is too horrible! I don't want to hear any more. I
will go back to England to-morrow. Laurens, come to my room; I want to
speak to you at once.'</p>

<p>So saying, she went to the door and opened it and went out, followed
by her brother, who looked at me as he passed me with a look which I
never forgot or forgave, for it was like the words that I had heard him
say to her in the square.</p>

<p>'What is this?' I said to the professor when the door had closed
behind them. 'What have I said or done that Joyful Star should look
with horror upon me and say such cruel words?'</p>

<p>I saw him exchange glances full of meaning with the English soldier
before he answered me; and then, leaning his arms on the table in front
of him, he said, in that quiet, calm voice of his,--</p>

<p>'My dear Vilcaroya, it is a very strange thing, and, as far as Miss
Djama is concerned, perhaps, a very great pity that this has never come
out before, for without knowing it you have given her a shock that may
have very painful consequences. No, don't interrupt me now, for the
sooner I can make you understand the meaning of your words to her the
better. It is this way: we know, of course, that in your day and among
your people sister-marriage was held to be the most sacred of all
marriages. We know that from such a marriage only might spring the
wearer of the imperial Borla, but to us the idea is so unutterably
horrible and revolting that of all the crimes that could be committed
by one of our race that would be the most fearful. It cannot even be
discussed amongst us, and yet you, in the most perfect innocence, have
spoken of it in the presence--Good Heavens, Hartness! what is to be
done? Do you think Miss Djama was really in earnest when she talked of
going back to England to-morrow? It is impossible--it would ruin
everything!'</p>

<p>I kept silence, for my sorrow and wonder were too great for words,
but I listened eagerly for what Francis Hartness would say in
reply.</p>

<p>'She was in earnest when she spoke,' he said, as quietly as the
professor had spoken; 'but, if the doctor has as much sense as I give
him credit for, she will have seen the thing in a different light by
this time. Of course, she has read Prescott, and she really knows as
much about the marriage customs of the ancient Incas as we do. In fact,
to tell you the truth'--and as he said this I saw him frown, and an
angry light came into his eyes that I had never seen in them before--'I
really can hardly understand how, knowing that as she does know it, she
can have been as horrified as she certainly was. She knows perfectly
well that Vilcaroya has come at a single step, as it were, from his age
into ours, and so must have brought all the ideas and beliefs of his
time and his people with him. Depend upon it, a little reflection will
very soon show her that, horrible and all as the idea must naturally
have appeared to her at the first shock of hearing it, from Vilcaroya's
point of view there is nothing in it but what is perfectly natural and
proper. Now, to my mind, the matter is much more sad and serious for
Vilcaroya himself than for anyone else.'</p>

<p>As he said this he turned from the professor to me and went on,
addressing me in a tone so frank and kindly that ever afterwards I
looked upon him as my friend and my brother,--</p>

<p>'It's not a pleasant thing for me to say, and it must, of course, be
a very painful one for you to hear; still, it has got to be said some
time or other, and, unless I am wrong in what I think of you, I believe
you are man enough to hear it and to agree with me that it had better
be said now than later on, when the saying of it might be tenfold more
painful both to you and us.'</p>

<p>'Say on,' I said shortly. 'Your tongue is straight and your eyes
look into mine as those of a friend should look. I am listening.'</p>

<p>'I would wish for no better friend than you, Vilcaroya, after that,
for I know what you mean. Now, what I have to say is this. We know, of
course, that you look upon yourself as doubly married to this love of
yours, who is dead and, like you, may yet be alive again. You are bound
to her, not only by a marriage which, in the time that it took place,
was perfectly lawful and natural, but also by the oath that you took
together. But you have come back to the world in another age and among
another people, and now that form of marriage is looked upon by all
civilised humanity, not only as unlawful, but, as the professor has
just said, unnatural and horrible beyond conception.</p>

<p>'Therefore, if Golden Star is restored to life, for you to love her,
save as a brother, or for you to consummate the union which, as you
have told us, began and ended before the altar of the Sun, would be to
make not only yourself, but your--your sister, Golden Star, as well,
looked upon with horror and loathing by every civilised man and woman
who knew your story. I am speaking strongly, because it is
necessary.</p>

<p>'You might succeed in all your aims, you might realise every
ambition of your life, and yet I tell you it is Heaven's own truth,
that if you took Golden Star to sit beside you on the throne of the
Incas as your wife and queen, you would place her upon a pinnacle of
infamy which men would spit upon and women turn their backs on. The
reward of all your labours, the price of all your treasures, no matter
how great they might be, would be nothing but a curse that would fall
heavily on you, but a thousand times more heavily on the woman whom you
have loved best in all the world.'</p>

<p>He stopped, and they both sat and looked at me in silence, awaiting
for me to answer him. As for me, I felt my spirit wandering over a bare
wilderness where all was dark.</p>

<p>I knew that he had spoken truth, strange as the truth seemed to me,
for no man could have heard his voice and seen the steady light in his
eyes, without knowing that he was a true man, and so spoke the truth.
The moments passed, and I could still find no words to say. Then the
silence was broken by the opening of the door, and Djama came in and
said,--</p>

<p>'My sister wishes you to excuse her coming back to the table. Of
course, I have explained matters to her, and I think she now sees them
in a different light, but for some reason or other she seems strangely
shaken. You know how extremely sensitive she is, and so, as her doctor,
as well as her brother, I have sent her to bed. She wasn't really fit
to come back after what has happened, and a night's rest will be the
best thing in the world for her. I suppose you two have explained
things to His Highness as well, eh?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said, rising from my seat. 'It has been explained to me. I
do not understand all now, but I must think, and think alone, so I will
go.'</p>

<p>Then I went to Francis Hartness and held out my hand to him and
said, after the fashion of the English,--</p>

<p>'Good-night, Captain Hartness. You have wounded me sorely with your
words, yet you have spoken them as only a friend could speak them. From
now till the day of my death or yours, Vilcaroya Inca is your friend,
and all his people are your servants.'</p>

<p>Then I took my hand from his, and bowing farewell to the others,
walked swiftly out of the room and got my cloak, and went out into the
city to think in silence by myself over the strange and terrible things
that I had heard, and to calm my spirit before I went to do the work
which, in a few hours, would be awaiting me on the hills behind the
Sacsahuaman.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III - IN THE HALL OF GOLD</h2>

<p>I went first to Ullullo's house and changed my clothing, so that I
might the more easily lose myself among the hundreds of Indians about
the streets of the city, for something told me that Djama might make an
attempt to discover the meaning of what I had said about the house by
following me and learning, if possible, the secret of my movements; for
he must have known that, being without money as I was, save for the few
dollars that the professor had lent me, it would not be possible for me
to do as I had said, unless one, at least, of the hiding-places of the
old treasures was within easy reach so that I could take sufficient
gold out of it by the next day to fulfil my promise.</p>

<p>When I changed my clothes I put a dagger into my belt, and a
revolver, which Francis Hartness had already taught me how to use, into
a case slung at my hip, and hidden by my jacket and the long folds of
my poncho. Then I went back into the great square, and across it up the
street in which we had our lodgings. As I passed the house I saw Djama
standing in the archway leading into the courtyard, smoking a cigar. I
turned and looked him in the face as I went by, slouching and trailing
my sandalled feet after the fashion of the natives. He looked at me,
but I saw no recognition in his eyes. Then as I walked on there came a
thought to me.</p>

<p>I hurried to Ullullo's house once more and brought him back with me,
telling him on the way what I wanted him to do for me. When we reached
the house again we saw Djama standing in the courtyard, and Ullullo,
doing as I had bid him, went in to him, and told him in Spanish, which
I could not speak, that if he would give him ten dollars he should
learn the secret of my goings and comings, and where I was to find the
gold with which to pay for the hacienda. Djama instantly promised him
the money, as I thought he would, and Ullullo told him to be at the end
of the street which is now called El Triunfo at eleven o'clock that
night. He was to come alone, for if anyone came with him he would learn
nothing. As you will soon see, I had two objects to serve in doing
this.</p>

<p>When Ullullo came back and told me that Djama would be there, I bade
him wait for me at the same place and hour, and then I went away alone
out of the city and up a path which led towards the mountains to the
north. There, alone and in silence, I communed with my own soul, at
first in sorrow, yet slowly becoming more and more peaceful in heart,
even as one who is told that he is to die on a certain day first rages
against his doom and then learns to contemplate with calmness that
which there is no hope of escaping. The words of the professor and
Francis Hartness had shown me that in the world to which I had returned
my sister Golden Star could now never be my wife and queen, and the
more I pondered on what they had said, the more plainly it appeared to
me that this was the truth, however bitter it might seem.</p>

<p>Yet there was something else in my heart, although at that time I
did not dare even to let my inmost thoughts dwell upon it, which in
some way dulled the pain of the blow that had fallen upon me, and
reconciled me to the parting which in one sense must now be eternal.
The longer I pondered the more deeply did that look of horror which I
had seen in the eyes of Joyful Star burn into my soul, and the more
clearly did the words that she had spoken ring in my ears. She had said
that it was horrible and that it was impossible, and she was to me as
one of those bright angels who, according to our ancient faith, awaited
the heroes and sages of our race in the Mansions of the Sun--a being so
far above me that I could look upon her only as a mortal might look
from afar upon a daughter of the Celestials.</p>

<p>Thus, musing in silence and solitude on the wild mountain-side, now
looking back into my distant past, and now hazarding a glance into the
fast-approaching future, the hours slipped by quickly for me, and I
heard the bells of the churches--bells which they had told me had been
cast out of the copper and gold and silver that our conquerors had
taken from our temples and palaces--chiming the half-hour before
eleven.</p>

<p>So I turned back to the city, and made haste to the place where
Djama and Ullullo would be waiting for me. I found them there talking
together, and without discovering myself to Djama, I told Ullullo in
Quichua to follow me with the Englishman. Then I went on swiftly along
the rivulet of Tullamayo, past the terrace of Rocca Inca, and along the
smooth, dark wall of what had once been the Yachahuasi, or College of
the Youths, and so out of the city and the gorge of the little river
Rodadero. Then, with the two still following me a few yards behind, I
climbed the lower terraces of the Colcompata, or the Granaries, where
the divine Manco built his first palace, and then on up the hillside to
the Tiupunco, or Gate of Sand, which led through the fragments of what
had once been the outer wall of the great fortress, and so on to the
little level pampa of the Rodadero, which was my meeting-place with
Tupac.</p>

<p>Now as I went I began to sing one of our ancient songs, which was
the signal that I had agreed upon with Tupac, and presently, one after
another, silent, stealthy forms crept out from the angles of the great
zig-zag wall and came towards me. One of them, taller than the rest,
threw an iron bar that he was carrying across his shoulders, and came
and stood before me with bowed-down head, waiting for me to speak. I
knew that it was Tupac, and I said to him,--</p>

<p>'Are the Children of the Sun ready to do the bidding of his
Son?'</p>

<p>'They are, Lord!' he replied. 'Here are twenty who have sworn by the
heart of the divine Manco to do all things lawful and unlawful, even to
the death, at the bidding of him who shall prove himself to be the true
heir of the royal Llautu.'</p>

<p>'It is good,' I said, 'and the proof shall soon be given. Now, take
the stranger yonder; do him no harm, but bind his eyes so that he
cannot see, and tie his hands behind him. Then follow me.'</p>

<p>Instantly the stealthy forms closed around Djama. Not a word was
spoken save his startled, angry exclamation, which was soon stifled,
and then they brought him along after me, I going first and Tupac
following close behind me. Like a string of shadows we moved across the
plain past the great carved rock which is still called the Inca's Seat,
and over the ridge of the Sliding Stones and down into the valley
beyond, which is thickly strewn with great rock-masses carved into
seats, and altars, and baths, and chambers, of which no man knows the
origin, and which were ancient when Manco-Capac and Mama-Occlu first
came into the land.</p>

<p>The greatest of these is a high white rock carved all over into
steps and seats and altars and basins, which are said to have been made
to catch the blood of the living sacrifices that were offered up here
by a race of men whose name has been forgotten. It is called in our
language the Sayacusca, or Tired Stone, for an old tradition says that
ages ago it was brought from the mountains by the toil of ten thousand
men, and when it reached its present place it rolled over and killed
three hundred of them, and could never be moved again upon its
journey.</p>

<p>On the south side of this there is a great cleft from the top to the
bottom, and up the sides of this cleft are the two halves of a
stairway, which was carved there before some earthquake rent the stone
in twain, and under this is a deep dark pool of water. At the entrance
to the cleft I stopped and beckoned to the others to come round me.
Then I told them that they were about to see that which no man then
alive on earth had ever seen, and made all swear by the Glory of the
Sun that each and every one of them would slay without pity him who
revealed anything seen or heard that night, even though he were his own
brother, or his own father, or his own son. As for Djama, they held him
there bound and blindfolded amongst them, and when he tried to speak
they stopped his mouth at my bidding, for I had told them that I would
be answerable for him, since I had brought him here for my own
purposes.</p>

<p>Then I made two of the men stretch a cord tightly across the mouth
of the cleft close down to the ground, and to the middle of this I tied
another cord, and stretched it out straight twelve foot-lengths from
the centre, and here I bade them clear away the bushes, and dig. Then
axe and hoe and spade went to work. In that clear air, and under that
cloudless sky, the stars gave light enough to work by, and soon a space
had been cleared, and a round hole about three feet across was being
dug down through the loose, rocky soil.</p>

<p>When it was about half the depth of a man the spades struck on the
solid rock below, and could go no farther. When Tupac told me of this,
I, who had been standing by the cleft, looking--full of strange
thoughts--down into the dark pool of water, called the man who had been
digging out of the hole, and, taking an iron bar from Tupac, I dropped
into it.</p>

<p>I sought about the bottom with my hands for a few moments till I
found the outline of a squared stone that had been let into the rock.
In the centre of this I found a hole, out of which I picked the dirt
with my dagger. Then, putting the end of my iron bar into it, I pulled,
and the stone turned over on a hinge, leaving an opening half its size.
Down this I thrust my arm, and found a chain of copper which hung down
into a deep well below. I pulled this with all my strength until
something gave way at the bottom, then I drew the chain up, and cast my
iron bar under it across the hole. As I did this, I heard the deep,
smothered roar of waters rushing away far below me into the bowels of
the earth.</p>

<p>Then I got out of the hole and went back to the cleft. I lit a
candle and looked down at the pool. It was no longer stagnant now, but
seething and eddying like a whirlpool. I beckoned to Tupac, who was
standing a little way behind me, and as he came and looked over my
shoulder I pointed down into the dark gulf, out of which the bottom was
rapidly falling, and said,--</p>

<p>'See, the waters are opening the way by which the Son of the Sun
shall go into his kingdom. Watch now, and listen!'</p>

<p>'Son of the Sun and Lord of the Four Regions, it is true!' he
whispered as the waters eddied round faster and faster, and gurgled and
rattled down into some unknown abyss. Soon they vanished altogether,
leaving only a dark, black, and seemingly fathomless cavern in the
place where they had been. I waited until the sound of the last gurgle
had died away in the depths, and then I turned to Tupac and said,--</p>

<p>'The way is open. Tell Ullullo to bring the lantern and light it.
There must be no other light. You and the rest follow me, and let two
strong men bring the stranger.'</p>

<p>He did as I bade him, and when I had lit the lantern I cast its rays
about the gulf beneath me till I found the continuation of the broken
stairway above, and then picking my way carefully down the dank, slimy
steps, I led the way into the heart of the rock, the rest following,
guided by the spreading ray of light in front of me.</p>

<p>I counted fifty steps, and then stopped and turned sharply to the
right. The fiftieth step ended against a wall of rock, still dripping
with the water that was running down from the arched roof of the
chamber. I measured ten spans with my hand from the wall where the
steps ended, and made a mark with my dagger on the rock. Then from the
floor I measured eight spans in a line across the mark. Where the
eighth span ended I made another mark, and with the help of my lantern
I found a silver socket let into the rock. It was a plate with a hole
in the centre large enough to admit the iron bar which I had brought
for the purpose. I put it in, and whispering to Tupac to help me, we
gripped the bar, and after two or three hard pulls felt it coming
towards us.</p>

<p>A great slab of rock, which fitted into the wall with all the
perfection that our old Inca masons could give it, turned on a central
hinge, leaving a space that two men could have walked through abreast,
'Go in,' I said to Tupac, 'and let all follow you.'</p>

<p>He obeyed, and standing by the opening with a ray of my lantern
shooting across it, I watched them file past one by one until all had
gone in. Then I followed, and as I crossed the threshold set my
shoulder against the edge of the slab and pushed it back into its
place.</p>

<p>Now I covered my lantern with my poncho and cried aloud in the
darkness,--</p>

<p>'Let the torches be got ready, but let no light be struck till that
which is to be revealed may be seen.'</p>

<p>A low murmur answered me, and then, still keeping my lantern hidden,
I felt my way along the wall, treading softly as a mountain lion
approaching its prey, until I had counted forty paces. The fortieth
brought me to a doorway, through which I turned. Five paces more
brought me to another turning, ten more to the end of the passage, and
then I uncovered my light and found myself in a little square chamber
hewn out of the rock and surrounded with stone chests covered with lids
of copper.</p>

<p>In the centre of the chamber stood a smaller one, all of metal. I
set my lantern down on one of the others so that the light fell across
this one; then I raised the lid, and there before me lay, perfect as
they had been on the day when Anda-Huillac, last High Priest of the
Sun, had laid them there, the imperial robes and insignia that had last
been worn by the ill-fated Huascar, son of the great Huayna-Capac.</p>

<p>Quickly throwing off the mean garments that I wore, I dressed myself
in them. Then, binding the golden sandals on my feet, and clasping the
long mantle emblazoned in gold and jewels with the symbols of the Sun
and his sister-wife the Moon across my shoulders, I wound the scarlet
Llautu around my head, with the crimson fringe of the Borla interlaced
with gold falling upon my brow, and then, closing the chest, I took up
my lantern and went back along the passages I had traversed.</p>

<p>In the middle of the last one I put my lantern down with the glass
against the wall, and feeling my way into the doorway, which opened on
to the chamber in which the others were awaiting me, I cried, in a
voice that echoed strangely through the great chamber,--</p>

<p>'Let the torches be kindled, and let the Children of the Sun look
upon their Lord!'</p>

<p>I heard a shuffling of feet and a whispering of many voices. Then
lights were struck, and I stepped back quickly into the shadow of the
doorway. I saw the glow of light grow into a glare that was flashed
back in a thousand manycoloured rays from the walls of the chamber. I
heard a deep, low cry of wonder, and then I strode out into the midst
and said,--</p>

<p>'I am he who went into the shadows at the bidding of our Father the
Sun, and by his will I have returned to bring deliverance to his
children!'</p>

<p>For one moment of affrighted amazement they stared wide-eyed at me
standing there before them, as though Huayna-Capac himself had returned
from the Mansions of the Sun to resume his sceptre and his crown. Then,
with one accord, they sank on their knees before me, holding their
torches above their bent heads and murmuring,--</p>

<p>'Hail, Son of the Sun and deliverer of his children, who hast come
to bring the daylight back to the long-darkened Land of the Four
Regions!'</p>

<p>I looked at them and saw Djama standing erect, still bound and
blindfold, in the midst of them. I went through the kneeling forms to
him, and taking the bandage from his eyes stepped back, and while he
was blinking at the light of the torches, said to him in English,--</p>

<p>'Look about you, Laurens Djama, and tell me if you believe now that
I, the friend of the filthy Indians whom you despise, can do that which
I have said?'</p>

<p>He was still half dazzled by the glare of the torches and the
thousand rays of many colours that were flashing about him. Wherever
his wondering glance fell it saw great golden plates covering the
walls, thick-set with jewels, and in front of him, piled up against the
end wall of the chamber, a shining heap of gold bars in the shape of a
pyramid reaching to the roof of the chamber, and on either side of
this, half way up, was a great image of the Sun, like to that which in
the olden times stood above the altar in the sanctuary of the great
temple of Cuzco, each with its centre fashioned as a human face, with
great flashing diamonds for eyes, with lips of rubies, and long
pendants of emeralds hanging from the ears, and all round a hundred
curving rays of gold edged and lined with jewels.</p>

<p>He stared about him, open-eyed and open-mouthed with amazement. Then
his eyes fell on me, and he started forward and stared me in the face
for a moment. Then he gasped,--</p>

<p>'Vilcaroya, is it you, or am I dreaming? Where have you brought me
to?'</p>

<p>'To one of the treasure-houses that you so longed to see,' I said,
'so that you might see and believe that I told you no idle tale, and
that I can perform my promise if you can perform yours.'</p>

<p>Then I turned my back on him and went to the foot of the pyramid,
and, taking my place in front of it, I said to those who still knelt
before me in silence,--</p>

<p>'Let those of his children who are faithful to their Father the Sun
rise and come without falsehood in their hearts, and say if they now
believe that that which was foretold long ago, when the darkness fell
over the land, has in very truth come to pass.'</p>

<p>They rose from their knees and came towards me in a half circle,
carrying their torches. They stopped about five paces from me, looking
at me through a little space with wondering eyes full of worship. Then
they bowed their heads again, and Tupac came from the midst of them,
and, casting himself prone at my feet, yet not daring even to touch my
sandals, said in a broken voice,--</p>

<p>'Son of the Sun, heir of heaven and lord of earth, we have seen thy
wisdom and thy majesty. None but one of thy royal line--nay, none but
thee, oh, Vilcaroya, son of Huayna-Capac, and brother of Huascar, last
of the Incas, could have known the secret that thou hast brought with
thee from the past into the present. We are thy children and thy
slaves, and all the men of the Blood that are left in the Land of the
Four Regions shall hail thee lord as we do, and own no other master
save thee, Vilcaroya Inca, from now until the hour when their father,
the Lord of Life, shall call them back to the Mansions of the Sun. We
are thine, and we will serve thee, ourselves and our wives and our
children, as our fathers served thy father in the days when there was
yet peace and happiness in the land.'</p>

<p>'And if ye are but faithful,' I said, 'and if the Lord, my father,
who rules the day, and his sister, my mother, who rules the night,
shall give me strength and wisdom to use the power that is mine, I will
give you back peace and happiness, and the stranger and the oppressor
shall be driven from the land, and the homes of the Children of the Sun
shall again be full of light. Rise now, Tupac, and let ten of the men
give their torches to the others and make ready to do my bidding.'</p>

<p>He rose, and it was done. Then I called Djama to me and said,--</p>

<p>'What you have seen here to-night is a dream. When your eyes open
again on the outer world, remember what I have said. Your hand has
brought me from the grave to the throne, and you must obey me as these
do. Let me but know that you have spoken one word, even to Joyful Star
herself, concerning what you have seen here to-night, and I will show
you how an Inca deals with one who dares to disobey him. Keep silence
and have patience, and perform that which you have promised, and you
shall go back to your own land loaded with gold and jewels. Fail, and
the fragments of your body shall be sent north and south and east and
west throughout the Land of the Four Regions, and your name shall be
one of shame in the ears of my people for ever.'</p>

<p>For a moment he looked me in the eyes, and I saw his lips moving as
though he was striving to shape some answer to my words. Then his face
grew grey, and his knees shook as he stood. Then I called to Tupac, and
bade him bind his eyes again and lead him away, and as soon as his
sight was taken from him I bade the ten men who had given up their
torches take off their ponchos and fill them with as many of the golden
bars as each one could carry, and when this was done, I ordered all the
torches save one to be extinguished. This one I took, and went with it
into the passage where I had left my lantern. Then I dashed it against
the wall and vanished into the darkness.</p>

<p>I took my lantern, and hiding the light carefully, went back to the
little chamber, where I took off my robes and sandals and the imperial
Llautu, and put them back into the chest. Then I put on my mean attire
again and went back into the Hall of Gold. Signing to the others to
follow me, I turned the stone door on its pivot again, and watched them
file past me as before. Then, going out last, I closed the portal after
me and lighted them up the steps with my lantern.</p>

<p>When we all once more stood in the open air by the cleft I went to
the hole and released the chain. Instantly the roar of waters broke out
again, and I bade them fill the hole up and put turf over it, and
trample it down and scatter the bushes over it; and that being done, we
took our way back again across the plain towards the fortress, still
leading Djama blindfold in our midst.</p>

<p>We took him by the gate of Viracocha into the fortress, across its
upper part, where the three crosses stood, and down on to the zigzag
road which leads into the eastern part of the city, and there we
unbound his eyes, and I bade him go to the house and make ready to
receive me early in the morning, telling our friends that I should
arrive with some packages of Indian merchandise and metals from one of
my mines, for, as I should have told you before, I had come to Cuzco in
the character of an owner of mines who had lived long in Europe and had
returned to supervise the working of my property.</p>

<p>I and Tupac and his companions then went back into the hills, and
without entering the city made our way by twos and threes into the
village of San Sebastian. We met at Tupac's house, and there I
explained to them as much of my plans and purposes as I thought fit for
them to know, and showed them that the time was not yet come for them
to make use of the treasures that I would share with them. But to each
man I gave two pounds' weight of gold to be left in Tupac's care till
it could be taken into the cities of the south and there changed for
silver coins. Then I had a list made of their names, and promised them,
after reminding them of their oaths, that when I once more sat on the
throne of the divine Manco, their fidelity should be well
remembered.</p>

<p>The next morning we loaded the gold in bales of the coca-leaf, great
quantities of which are taken every day into Cuzco, upon four mules,
and these I sent to our house while I went back with Ullullo and put on
my English clothing. Then I followed, and found that the bags of coca
had already arrived. They were carried up to my own room, and there, in
the presence of Djama and Joyful Star, the professor and Francis
Hartness, I took out the gold ingots and built them up in a pyramid
before them.</p>

<p>I could see from their amazement that, whether from fear or faith,
Djama had obeyed me, and said nothing of what he had seen during the
night. As for me, I said but little. I gave them the gold, and that day
the professor and Djama, acting as my agents, sold it to some of the
merchants of Cuzco as the product of my mines. The price was more than
twice as much as was needed for the hacienda, so with the rest I
discharged my debt and made myself once more a free man.</p>

<p>There is no need for me to dwell upon our dealings with the owner of
the hacienda, and therefore it will suffice for me to say, before ten
days more had passed the purchase-money had been paid, we had taken up
our abode there, and installed Joyful Star as housewife, with faithful
servants chosen by myself from among the Children of the Blood. Djama,
who had been strangely silent and reserved with all of us since the
lesson I had taught him in the Hall of Gold, had taken possession of
the chamber which was devoted to his uses, and had put all his
apparatus in order for the great work that was to be done there.</p>

<p>So on the fourteenth day, such was the power of my gold and of my
longings, all things were ready, and at daybreak on the fifteenth day
we rode at the head of our little mule train out of the courtyard of
the hacienda on our way to the resting-place of Golden Star.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV - THE SISTER STARS</h2>

<p>For five long days we travelled slowly and toilfully on our way from
the valley of Cuzco to that other where Golden Star lay sleeping beside
the lake. Over high plains and pleasant valleys, through deep, dark
gorges and ravines, to whose lowest depths the sun but seldom reaches,
and then but for an hour or two, along narrow pathways cut into the
living rock on the mountain side, with precipices on one hand falling
thousands of feet into the dark abysses, where the torrents roared and
foamed, and on the other the great rock-walls of the mountain soaring
up into the sky yet more thousands of feet above us.</p>

<p>I saw the mighty crests of Saljantai and Umantai rising snow-crowned
from earth to heaven, unchanged in their eternal grandeur since the
long-distant day on which I had last beheld them. I rode with saddened
heart past the ruins of Lima Tambo, remembering how fair and stately a
city it had been in the days before the plunderer and the oppressor
came. We toiled slowly over the great, sharp-ridged range which parts
the waters of the Vilcamayo from those of the Apurimac--the 'Great
Speaker'--then, descending again by the gorge of the river which is now
called the Rio de la Banca, we came to the long bridge which swings in
mid-air from rock to rock across the chasm through which the Great
Speaker rolls his swift, roaring flood.</p>

<p>Its cables were loosened and its floorway broken, for, like all
things else in the land, the Spaniards had suffered it to fall well
nigh to ruin; and, as I led Joyful Star across it by the hand, I
thought of what it had been in the olden times, when not a rope or a
stick was suffered to be out of place, and when the Son of the Sun had
been borne across it in his golden travelling litter, with long
processions of his adoring people going before and behind him, strewing
his way with flowers, and waking the echoes of these gloomy gorges with
the melody of their songs and laughter.</p>

<p>From here we journeyed on, ever facing the setting sun, for two days
more, still winding higher and higher up into the mountains, until at
length, on the third evening, I, riding alone many yards in front of
the others, found the sign that I was looking for--a rock with three
seats carved on the top of it--and turned my mule from the track and
rode over the rough, stony ground up the side of the mountain until
what looked from the road a single rock-built peak opened into two. I
beckoned to the others to follow me, and when they, came up I said to
the professor,--</p>

<p>'Do you know where you are now? Have you ever been here before?'</p>

<p>He looked about him and shook his head, saying,--</p>

<p>'This may have been the place where we got off the road when my mule
gave out, but I don't recognise it. Do you mean that we are near the
valley?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said. 'Do you not remember seeing yonder two peaks from the
shore of the lake near where you found me?'</p>

<p>He looked at them for a moment, and then said,--</p>

<p>'Yes, I remember them; but they don't look the same, and I don't
believe I could find my way back into the valley from here to save my
life. It's very strange how I can have forgotten it so completely.'</p>

<p>I smiled as he said this, knowing that I had brought them purposely
many miles out of the way by which he had found the valley by accident,
for I had no desire that the way should be known to any but myself and
those I had chosen from among the remnant of the Children of the Blood.
Then I bade them follow me again, and once more rode on alone ahead,
for, as you may well believe, I was too full of my own thoughts and
hopes and fears to be in any mood for conversation, even with Joyful
Star herself. They, too, talked but little, and as we rode on in the
deepening gloom amid the solemn silence and the gaunt grandeur of the
mountains, their words became fewer and fewer, till at length thought
took the place of speech, and the silence was broken by no sound save
the patter of the mules' feet and the rattle of stones under their
iron-shod hoofs.</p>

<p>Hour after hour I led them on, turning from valley to valley on the
road that was visible only to my own eyes, and ever rising higher and
higher towards the twin peaks that now stood out dark and sharp against
the starry sky. At last, when our watches were nearly marking ten
o'clock, I stopped before a cliff covered with bushes and creeping
grasses, and calling Tupac to me, I bade him seek for an opening under
these.</p>

<p>He groped about among the bushes for a while, and then suddenly,
with a short cry of surprise, he vanished, as it seemed, through the
face of the rock itself. I dismounted and followed him, and found him
standing behind the bushes, facing a square doorway cut in the rock and
lined with masonry. Behind it, and closing it completely, was a great
slab of dressed stone. Down the sides of the doorway were two square
pillars of stone, and in the middle of one, to the left hand, three
little lines had been cut about a finger's breadth apart, but so
faintly that only one who knew they were there could find them.</p>

<p>I stretched a string across from the middle one of these to the
right-hand pillar, and where the string ended in the centre of the
pillar I felt with my finger-tips and found a little circle about as
big round as an English two-shilling piece. Tupac had in his hand the
iron rod that I had used on the Rodadero. I took it from him, and,
pressing the end against the circle, told him to push with me, and, to
his wonder, the rod sank, seemingly, into the solid stone, forcing out
a bolt which had been fitted so cunningly into the pillar that the end
of it looked no more than a circle traced on the face of it.</p>

<p>When we had pushed the rod in about six inches I bade Tupac help me
to pull it round towards the door. The pillar turned on a central hinge
as we did so, and the great stone slab swung back by its own weight,
which we had thus released, opening the entrance to a tunnel high
enough for a man to walk through erect. This tunnel sloped somewhat
sharply upwards, and looking up it I could see, shining in the clear
sky beyond the upper entrance, the stars that I knew were reflected in
the still waters of the little lake by which Golden Star was sleeping
the sleep out of which we had come to wake her.</p>

<p>As the passage was not large enough for the mules to go through with
their burdens, I bade my men unload them and carry their loads through
into the valley. Then we followed, leading our own animals by the
bridle, and after us the cargo-mules were driven through. The load of
one of them was a long, narrow case of wood like that in which the
professor had taken my own dead body to London, but this was thickly
and softly padded inside with wool, and lined with white linen, and at
one end was a little pillow of the softest down, on which the head of
Golden Star would soon be resting.</p>

<p>As soon as we were all standing outside the upper mouth of the
tunnel I looked at Joyful Star and said,--</p>

<p>'Is not this a fitting resting-place even for the daughter of kings?
Are not the stars bright in the heavens and on the bosom of the lake?
Are not the mountains great, and strong, and silent? Do they not guard
her couch well, and does not the snowy peak of Umantai yonder point the
straight way to the Mansions of the Sun, where the soul of Golden Star
is even now waiting for the arts of your brother to call it back to
earth as he called mine?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said, looking about her, first at the stars and then at
the vast shapes of the mountains which loomed huge and dim on every
side. 'Yes, Vilcaroya, it is a good place for sleep, but--is not the
world beyond a good place to wake in? Have you not found it so?'</p>

<p>I caught the gleam of her eyes in the starlight as she looked
towards me saying this, and, by the glory of the Sun, had we stood
alone where we were, I might have forgotten all save the knowledge that
I was the lawful lord of all this land, and that she was there in the
midst of it with me. For the instant I had gone back to my old life,
with all its old-world thoughts and customs, and then, before I could
answer her, my dreaming soul was called back to the present by the
cold, quiet voice of her brother saying,--</p>

<p>'I don't think that very many would find the world an unpleasant
place to wake in, either for the first or second time, if they could
also wake up lord of illimitable treasures as Vilcaroya here has done.
But come, Your Highness, and you, professor, it is getting late. Don't
you think it is time to be thinking about camping?'</p>

<p>The matter-of-fact words scattered my dreams in an instant, and I
woke from them into the present. I bade Tupac have the animals tethered
and fed, and the tents we had brought with us pitched in the most
sheltered place he could find; and while they were doing this, and
Djama and the others were busy seeing that the work was done to their
satisfaction, I went to Ruth and said my words, which I strove so hard
to keep steady, trembling with I know not how many mingled
passions,--</p>

<p>'Will Joyful Star come with me and see the place where her sister
and mine is lying, waiting to come forth and greet her?'</p>

<p>'Your sister, Vilcaroya?' she said, turning her face up to me so
that the starlight shone upon its fairness and lost itself in the
lustrous depths of her eyes. 'Do you mean your sister
only--not--your-'</p>

<p>'No,' I said, 'not my wife, for I have thought upon your words and
pondered them deeply; and though they wounded me sorely at first, yet
now I see that they were wise and just, like all the other words that
Joyful Star has spoken to me. I have learned that lesson, like many
others which you have taught me. That bridal of ours is already to me a
dream of the long-lost past, the vision of a time that is dead and a
people that is no more. When Golden Star wakes, if she ever does, I
will greet her as a sister and a friend, as one of my own people who
has come back to me out of my own times, and she shall help me in the
work that I swore with her to do--but that is all; and I will find
others of the Blood who shall sit upon the restored throne of my
ancestors, and be the parents of the generations of Incas that shall
come after me.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean, Vilcaroya?' she said, in a voice that was half
angry and half fearful. 'Do you mean--no, I cannot say it--for I am
sure you do not mean that.'</p>

<p>'How could that be?' I answered, guessing her meaning. 'Is it not
you who have taught me the ways and thoughts of the world into which I
have come back? No, what I mean is that I am not the only one now alive
in whose veins the old blood of the Incas flows. Tupac, yonder, is the
son of the son of the son of that Tupac-Amaru who died torn asunder in
the square of Cuzco, because he had dared to raise the Rainbow Banner
in the Land of the Four Regions, and called the Children of the Sun to
revolt against their oppressors. He, more blessed than I who am his
lord, has both wife and child, and if the prophecy is to be fulfiled,
and I am to reign in the City of the Sun, then I will take his
firstborn and instruct him in all the lore of our people and the duties
of their ruler, and if he proves worthy he shall wear the Llautu after
me.'</p>

<p>She looked up at me again as I ceased speaking, just one swift,
bright glance that seemed to pierce to the most secret depths of my
soul, and read the unuttered thoughts that were hidden here, thoughts
which I did not dare to speak even to myself in the loneliest hour of
my musings. Then she looked down again, and side by side we walked in
silence round the shore of the lake until I stopped in front of a great
black cliff that jutted out from the mountain side and hung impending
over the dark, still waters of the lake. I pointed into the black
shadows in which its base was hidden, and said,--</p>

<p>'There lies Golden Star, and there I lay beside her through all the
long years that were to pass from the night when I pledged my troth
with her before the Altar of the Sun until this night when I stand with
you, Joyful Star, a new being in a new world, before her
resting-place.'</p>

<p>'Is it really true?' she said, stopping as she spoke, and staring
straight before her into the darkness. 'Is it really true that you, who
are standing alive and strong here beside me, lay there under that
great rock for all those years, while ten generations of men and women
were born, and lived and died, and the whole world changed again and
again? And is the Golden Star lying in there now really the Golden Star
you have told me so much of, and I have thought about until she seems
to me more like some living friend that I have known and loved, than a
dead body that has been in the grave for more than three hundred years?
Is it really true, Vilcaroya, or have we all only been dreaming some
wild dream, like that Frankenstein story that I was telling you the
other day?'</p>

<p>As she spoke she laid her hand for a moment upon my arm, as though
to satisfy herself that I was really made of human flesh and blood, and
not a phantom standing beside her in the starlit darkness.</p>

<p>Scarce knowing what I did, I laid my own hand, warm and strong and
firm, upon hers. For an instant I felt it tremble beneath mine. I would
have given all the boundless wealth that I knew was mine for the
courage to close upon it a grasp that it could not have escaped if it
would. My heart seemed to swell as though it would burst in my breast,
my tingling blood ran fire, and wild words rose choking to my lips.
Then her hand slipped away from under mine. Once more I saw her eyes
shine in the starlight, and then I knew that I had learned the last and
greatest lesson that Joyful Star could teach me.</p>

<p>I knew now why to think of Golden Star as my wife and my queen,
filled me with the same untold horror which I had heard that night
thrill in the tones of her who stood beside me, for now I--the son of a
lost race and a long-past age--loved this daughter of the new time. For
good or evil, for hope or despair, I was hers until I went again, and
for the last time, into the shadows through which I had already passed,
and then--yes, there he was, this tall, stalwart, golden-haired son of
her own race and her own time, whose eyes I had seen looking love into
hers!</p>

<p>He was coming towards us round the lake with his long, easy,
swinging strides, this man who was already my friend, and who would one
day be the captain of my armies. For one blind moment of madness I
thought how completely I had him and the others in my power; of the
lonely, unknown valley where we stood; of the men who were already my
slaves, and who looked upon me as a god. I thought, too, of the dark,
deep waters of the lake, and the secrets that they held for me alone.
How well they could hide others for me, too! What if Golden Star never
awoke? Would she not be as well lying there in the peace of her endless
sleep as coming back into the world, perhaps to love in vain and to
suffer as I was doomed to suffer?</p>

<p>The shadowy forms of the mountains began to waver and reel around
me; the stars danced up and down in the sky, and a red mist seemed to
swim before my eyes. Then, through the hoarse, dull murmur that was
sounding in my ears, I heard the sweet, low voice of Joyful Star
saying,--</p>

<p>'Ah, Captain Hartness, I suppose you have been wondering what had
become of us! I am afraid I have been neglecting my household duties,
and you have been attending to them for me, but really I could not
resist coming here with Vilcaroya. Look, that is where Golden Star is
lying, in a cave under that great rock down there where those dark
shadows are. Doesn't it look cold and lonely and eerie?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he answered, with a laugh that did not sound to me like his
own. 'But I don't suppose that matters very much now to Her Highness
any more than it did to Vilcaroya. But, to descend to less romantic
matters, I have come to tell you that the affairs of our temporary
household are already in order, supper is ready, and we are all
ravenously hungry, and I suppose you are about the same. This mountain
air puts an edge on one's appetite like a razor's.'</p>

<p>'Supper--yes, I had forgotten all about it, thinking of poor Golden
Star lying there all alone in the darkness. Of course, I am desperately
hungry, now that you remind me of it. Come, Vilcaroya, I am sure you
are hungry too. Another night alone won't matter much to poor Golden
Star after all these years. You can dream of her to-night, as I suppose
we all shall, and to-morrow we shall see her. Oh, how I wonder what she
will be really like!'</p>

<p>As Joyful Star said this in a voice that was half sad and half
merry, she turned away towards Francis Hartness, and I followed her
with some light words on my lips and many heavy thoughts in my heart,
and we walked together to the tents, talking of the things that were to
be done on the morrow.</p>

<p>The next morning I was afoot before the stars had begun to pale in
the coming dawn. I had not slept for two hours together through the
night, yet, waking and sleeping, many dreams had come to me. I had been
back to the past among my people, living again that strange old life,
with all its light and colour and gaiety, which was now every day
becoming more and more like a vision that had been told to me by some
other dreamer.</p>

<p>I had talked with Golden Star, seeking to teach her the lesson that
my dear instructress of the new time had taught me, and had awakened
half mad with the perplexities of my divided love--the love of the past
that was dead and of the present that was alive. I had seen my
sister-bride come forth out of her tomb to greet me, clothed in her
bridal robes, with the dust of the grave in her hair and on her face. I
had clasped her in my longing arms and kissed the dust from her lips,
and while I yet held her in my embrace her form had grown cold and
stiff again. Then, in the agony of my sorrow, I had strained her to my
breast, and, under the pressure of my arms, she had crumbled in my
grasp and fallen, a little heap of grey bones and dusty garments, at my
feet.</p>

<p>Once more I had awakened with my gasping cry of horror still
sounding in my ears, and then, not daring to seek sleep again, I had
risen and gone out to watch for the rest of the night before her grave
under the rock. There they found me when they came from the camp at
daybreak. I went back with them, and our hasty morning meal was eaten
and drunk almost in silence, for we were all too busy with our thoughts
to have leisure for conversation, and my friends, knowing how much that
day's work must mean to me, respected my unspoken feelings, and left me
to the silent company of my own hopes and fears.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, we took our lanterns and tools and went to the rock,
followed by Tupac and two of my men carrying the coffin-like case in
which Golden Star's body was to be laid. Under the rock was a long heap
of loose stones which the professor had wisely piled up in front of the
upright courses of masonry through which he had broken into my
resting-place. He scanned them eagerly to see if they had been
disturbed since his visit, and told us that they had not. Then I bade
Tupac and the men clear them away, which they speedily did, laying bare
the courses of stone behind them, still standing as the professor had
re-built them after taking out my body.</p>

<p>A few minutes' more work opened a passage large enough for a man to
walk in, stooping. As if by a common instinct they all stepped aside
and looked at me. I saw what they meant, and, turning the light of my
lantern into the entrance, I walked back, a living man, into the grave
where I had lain dead while ten generations of men had lived and died.
I saw the place where I had lain, for a few mouldering scraps and
shreds of cloth and furs still lay where my bed had been. Then I
flashed my lantern round the walls of the cavern, and on the side along
which my own couch had been spread by Anda-Huillac and his brother
priests I found what they had told me to seek while I was preparing to
fulfil the oath that I had sworn with Golden Star.</p>

<p>It was a wedge of stone fitted in to a crevice in the wall and left
rough and jagged at its outer end, so that one who did not know its
true purpose would have taken it to be nothing more than a natural
projection in the rough side of the cavern.</p>

<p>With a mallet that I had brought with me I struck the end of the
wedge softly above and below until it was loosened in its socket. Then,
standing to one side, I struck it harder. It dropped from its place,
and the same instant a part of the cavern wall swayed outwards and fell
with a rumbling crash across the floor.</p>

<p>For a moment I stood breathless and motionless on the threshold of
Golden Star's grave. Then, with trembling hands, I turned the light of
my lantern into the inner chamber, and as the dust that the falling
stone had raised fell slowly back to the ground I saw through the
particles dancing in the lantern rays the dim outline of a human form
lying on a couch of skins.</p>

<p>Still, not daring to set a foot within that sacred place, I stood in
the doorway and let the light fall full upon the figure. A glance
showed me that so far all was well. No profaning hand had disturbed the
peace and sanctity of her long slumber. She lay there as perfect in
form and feature as she had lain beside me that night in the little
chamber in the Sanctuary of the Sun.</p>

<p>Then I thought of Joyful Star. Hers should be the first eyes after
mine to look upon that dead loveliness. So I turned and went out to
where they were all standing round the outer entrance, and, taking no
notice of the others, replying nothing to their half-whispered
questions, I went to Ruth and, holding out my hand for her, said,--</p>

<p>'Come, Joyful Star, and see the sister that the Lord of Life made
long ago in the image that you now wear.'</p>

<p>She said nothing, but, with a look of wondering question, put her
hand into mine and I turned to lead her to the entrance.</p>

<p>Djama, with a sudden exclamation, took a step forward as though he
would stop her, but Francis Hartness put his hand on his shoulder,
saying,--</p>

<p>'I think you had better let them go alone. There is no fear for your
sister with all of us here so near; and if what Vilcaroya says is true,
why should she not see her first?'</p>

<p>Djama drew back, though with no very good grace, and I went into the
inner chamber, helping Ruth over the fallen stones. Then I flashed my
light on Golden Star's face and said,--</p>

<p>'Did I not tell you truly that the Lord of Life made her in the same
image as yours?'</p>

<p>I heard her utter a little gasping cry of wonder, and then I saw her
slip forward on to her knees beside Golden Star's pillow, and as the
light fell upon the two faces--the living and the dead--the likeness
between them was so perfect, save for the golden gleam of Joyful Star's
hair and the lustrous blackness of the tresses that framed my dead
love's face, that they seemed to me as sisters, one watching over the
slumbers of the other.</p>

<p>'It is more than wonderful, and it is surely more than chance!' said
Joyful Star, in a tone that was almost a whisper, and turning towards
me her white face and the eyes into which the loving tears of pity were
already springing. 'Why did you not tell me of this before,
Vilcaroya?'</p>

<p>'Because,' I said, 'the arts of the priests might not have done for
her what they did for me, and I might have found here that which your
eyes should never have looked upon. But now--is she not beautiful, even
as you are?'</p>

<p>The bright blood came swiftly back into her cheeks as I said this,
and, without answering me she stooped, and with gentle hands put back
the tresses from Golden Star's forehead, and, bending over her, laid
her warm, sweet lips on the cold, smooth brow that I had last seen
crowned with the marriage-garland in our bridal chamber in the
Sanctuary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V - HOW DJAMA DID HIS WORK</h2>

<p>I can tell you but little of what followed the taking of the body of
Golden Star back to the hacienda, for neither I nor any of the others,
save only Djama himself, witnessed the secret mysteries of his strange
and fearful art. I could tell you of their wonder when, after I had
bidden Tupac bring the case into the cavern and he and I and Joyful
Star had gently and reverently raised her from her couch and laid her
in it, we carried her out into the daylight. How they stood around the
open case and looked, half in wonder and half in fear, from her dead,
cold face to the living likeness that was bending over it. How they
praised her beauty and marvelled at the forgotten arts that had
preserved so perfect a likeness of life in one who for more than three
centuries and a half had neither drawn breath nor known a thrill of
feeling.</p>

<p>I could tell you, too, with what loving and anxious care that
precious burden was borne over plain and valley and mountain in a
litter that we had brought with us for the purpose, and how at last we
laid her in all her calm, unconscious loveliness on the great table
which stood in the middle of the chamber in which Djama was to do his
work. But here my story must cease for the time, for Djama made it an
unalterable condition that he should do the work that only he could do
in absolute solitude. Only thus, he said, would he, or could he,
perform the task upon whose issue the completion of Golden Star's life
on earth, if it was ever to be completed, depended.</p>

<p>He told us plainly that a single interruption should be fatal to her
and all our hopes. He would not even permit his sister to enter the
room until he should call for her. I was bitterly loath to yield--to
leave her who had been so dear to me powerless and unconscious in the
hands of a man whom I had already learned to hate, although not only
did I owe my own new life to him, but on him alone rested all my hopes
of seeing Golden Star once more restored to life and health, and the
beauty that had been peerless ages before Joyful Star had reached the
perfection of her young womanhood.</p>

<p>How did I know what unholy arts he might use to rekindle the
long-quenched life-flame in that fair shape of hers? How could I do
more than guess vaguely and fearfully at the awful mysteries that might
be enacted in the silence and solitude of that fast-closed chamber in
which, day and night, he would remain alone with her, the living with
the dead, like the potter with his clay, until it should please him to
use the dreadful power that was his, and call her back from death to
life, perhaps--and oh! how horrible the thought was to me!--to be the
slave of the man who, by his unearthly art, had made himself the master
of her new life.</p>

<p>Yet, think of it, brood over it as I would, there was no help for
it. He, and he alone, could exert the power that would loose the bonds
of death in which she lay enchained. Unless he had his will she would
remain as she was, perhaps until the Last Day came, and the Lord of
Life called all his children, living and dead, back to the Mansions of
the Sun; and so we yielded, since there was nothing else to be
done.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day that we returned to the hacienda, he
busied himself making the last preparations for his work. Then he came
out of the room and locked the door, and, after eating his dinner
almost in silence, went to bed, taking the key with him, and telling us
that on no account must he be awakened. All that night and the next day
and the next night we neither saw nor heard anything of him; but on the
morning of the second day, the door of his bedroom was open and his bed
was empty, but the door of the room in which Golden Star lay was still
fast shut and locked.</p>

<p>How the time passed I cannot tell you. Joyful Star, seemingly more
self-possessed than any of us, took up her household duties, and went
about them with a quick, quiet industry that surprised and shamed us.
But we three men wandered about aimlessly, now alone and now together,
communing with our own thoughts or talking with each other always of
the same thing--of what was going on in that chamber, where, as we knew
from the faint sounds that every now and then came through the closed
door, the master of the arts of life and death was performing his awful
task.</p>

<p>The first day and night came and went, then the second, and still
the door remained closed, and Djama gave no sign. But the professor
sought to comfort me and soothe our impatience by telling me how long
the same work had lasted before I was recalled to life. I had sought
also to distract my thoughts by talking with him and Francis Hartness
of all that was to be done for the deliverance of my people, and the
realisation of my dreams of empire when Djama's task should be
over.</p>

<p>But it was useless, for fear and suspense kept my mind bound as
though with invisible chains, and, do what I would, my thoughts went
back and back again to dwell upon the unknown secrets of that closed
and silent room. Then I tried to draw Joyful Star into conversation
about the thoughts which I knew were filling both our hearts; but
though she listened to me she would say nothing herself, and I soon saw
that with her the subject was forbidden, and the work not to be talked
of till, in success or failure, it was ended.</p>

<p>For the first two nights no sleep came to my eyes, but the third
night my weariness was too much for me, and scarcely had my aching head
fallen on the pillow than slumber, filled with broken dreams and
visions of things unutterably horrible, came upon me. In the midst of
one of them--I know not what it was, save that no human words could
paint the horror of it--I woke up with a cold, damp hand upon my
shoulder, and heard Djama's voice, hoarse and trembling, saying to
me,--</p>

<p>'Get up and dress, Vilcaroya; I have something for you to see and to
hear. Make haste, for there is not much time to be lost.'</p>

<p>I looked up, and saw him standing by my bed with a light in his
hand, ghastly pale, and staring at me with black, burning eyes, which
seemed, as they looked into mine, to take my will a prisoner, and draw
my very soul towards him.</p>

<p>'What is it?' I said, in the broken words of one just roused from
sleep. 'Is it over--have you succeeded? Is she alive? Have you come to
take me to her?'</p>

<p>'The work is not done yet,' he said. 'I have come for you to see it
finished. Make haste, I tell you, if you want to see what you have been
waiting so long for.'</p>

<p>I needed no second bidding. I sprang out of bed, and dressed myself
with swift, though trembling, hands. Then I thrust my feet into a pair
of soft slippers, such as Djama himself wore, and then I followed him
from the room out on to the balcony that was built round the house over
the inner courtyard. We went down into the court and into the
dining-room, and through that down a long, narrow passage out of which
opened the room that had held all our hope and fear and wonder for so
long.</p>

<p>He unlocked the door, and motioned to me to go in. He followed me,
and locked the door behind us. I looked about the room, which was dimly
lit by two shaded lamps. The table on which we had laid Golden Star was
empty. Many strangely-shaped things, that I knew not the use of were
scattered about. The air was hot and moist, and filled with a faint,
sweet odour. At the opposite end from the door, which was covered by a
screen, I saw in one corner a bath--from which white, steamy fumes were
rising--and in the other stood a little, narrow, curtained bed, such as
I had first awakened in.</p>

<p>Djama caught me by the arm, and half led, half dragged me to the
bedside. Then with his other hand he parted the curtains and pointed to
the pillow. I felt his burning eyes fixed upon me as I looked and saw
the sweet fair face of Golden Star lying in the midst of her dusky
tresses, which lay spread out on the pillow, cleansed from the dust of
the grave, and soft and shimmering as silk.</p>

<p>I started forward, and, with my face close to hers, scanned every
feature, and listened, but in vain, for the soft sound of her
breathing. Her skin was clear and moist; I could see the thin, blue
veins in her eyelids, and the moisture on her lips. I laid my hand
gently on her cheek. It was soft and smooth, but still cold as
death.</p>

<p>Then a fierce, unreasoning anger came into my heart. I sprang back
and seized Djama by the shoulders, and, looking with fierce, hot eyes
into his, I whispered hoarsely,--</p>

<p>'Have you brought me here to mock me? She is not alive--she is but a
fair image of death. Tell me that you have failed and I will strangle
you, liar and cheat that you are!'</p>

<p>He looked back steadily into my eyes and smiled, and said, in a
voice that had not the slightest tremor of fear,--</p>

<p>'If I fail you may strangle me, and welcome; but I have not failed
yet, Vilcaroya. It is for you to say now whether Golden Star is to
awake or not.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' I said, letting go my grip on his shoulders, and
recoiling a pace from him.</p>

<p>'You shall hear what I mean,' he said. 'But you must hear patiently
and quietly, and think well on what I say, for in your answer to what I
ask you will also answer the question whether Golden Star is to awake
to life and health, or to be put back in that case yonder and buried,
to rot away into corruption like any other corpse.'</p>

<p>'Say on, I am listening,' I said. My lips were dry, and the grip of
a deadly fear seemed to be clutching at my heart and draining the last
drop of blood from it.</p>

<p>'Listen well, then,' he said. He paused for a moment as though to
collect his thoughts, and make words ready to express them. Then he
went on. 'You see, I have undone the work that your priests did three
hundred and sixty years ago. Your Golden Star is now neither dead nor
alive. She is lying on the narrow borderland that divides life from
death, and for an hour from the time I left this room she will remain
there--if I choose. At the end of that time she will pass beyond the
border, and no earthly power, not even mine, could call her back. But
at any time before the hour has expired I can complete the work that I
have begun. I can bring the breath back to her body; I can set the
blood flowing through her veins. You shall see her eyes open and her
lips smile, and you shall hear her speak to you as though she had only
awakened out of sleep. This I can do, and I will, if you will do what I
am going to ask you.'</p>

<p>'What is it?' I whispered. 'Tell me quickly that I may know. You are
master here. I can only listen and obey.'</p>

<p>He smiled as I said this, a smile that it was not good for an honest
man to look upon, and went on, speaking now rapidly and
earnestly,--</p>

<p>'When I did this work for you, I did it as a student and a man of
science, who was making the greatest experiment of his life. I believed
that I had solved one, at least, of the secrets of life and death. I
watched and noted every change that came over you. I marked every
symptom and measured every step of your return from death into life,
but I did all this as a student inquiring into the mysteries of Nature,
as an observer watching the working out of a great problem, and with no
more feeling than if I had been dissecting a corpse. But this time it
has been different. I began this work with the cold and passionless
deliberation of one who toils only to learn and to succeed. But
afterwards--come here and look at her, and you will understand me
better. She is a woman, and she is beautiful, and here, for two days
and two nights, she has lain under my hands and my eyes. I have given
her beauty back to her, and if that beauty is to live it must be mine.
Do you understand me, Vilcaroya?'</p>

<p>What could I say, what could I do to answer this man whom I hated,
and yet who held the power of life and death for Golden Star in his
hands? The vague fear that had smitten me when he began to speak had
taken its worst shape now. I looked at him with hate and horror staring
out of my eyes. Again and again I tried to speak, but my lips only
moved and trembled without making any word. But he read my thoughts,
and smiled that evil smile of his again and said, in a low voice which
seemed to have the echo of a laugh in it,--</p>

<p>'I see you hate me, as I have often thought you did, and that is why
I have brought you here to tell you this. That is why I would not
complete my work till you had sworn, as you yet shall do if you would
see Golden Star alive again, that what I have brought back out of the
grave shall be mine and mine only.'</p>

<p>These last words of his let loose my anger and unchained my tongue.
I gripped him by the arm, and in a whisper that had a strange hissing
sound, I said,--</p>

<p>'But that is not all! What do you think your life would be worth if
you left her to die? Have you forgotten what I said to you in the cave
beneath the Rodadero? Do you not know that this very night I could have
you carried, gagged and bound, over the mountains and back to the grave
that we took Golden Star out of? Do you not know that I could lay you
there with food and drink beside you that you could not touch, and a
lamp whose light would show them to you, and then wall up the entrance
again, and leave you there to think of your fate till you went mad and
died of hunger and thirst? Do you not know that I could chain you to a
rock and light a fire about you, and watch you burn limb by limb till
you shrieked your life out in lingering agony? Would this be better
than going back to your own land loaded with treasure that would make
you richer than you have ever dreamed of being? Now, I have spoken, and
it is for you to answer me.'</p>

<p>Before I had done speaking he had taken a chair and seated himself
astride it, with his arms resting on the back and his chin on his arms,
and was looking at me with white, set face, and steady, dark, shining
eyes. When I had finished there was a little silence between us, and
then he spoke, and the first time I ever felt fear in either of my
lives was when I heard those cold, cruel, carefully-measured words of
his,--</p>

<p>'That is well said, Vilcaroya. I am glad you have spoken plainly,
for now we understand each other; but I don't think you quite realise
the difference between your power and mine. You have, or think you
have, the brute force, the strength of numbers, and the slavish
devotion of your people on your side, and you threaten to use that
power to put me to a lingering and torturing death unless I withdraw my
demands and do as you wish me. In that, however, you are quite wrong. I
am as much the master of my own life as I was once of yours, and still
am of Golden Star's. Without moving hand or foot I could kill myself as
I sit here before you, so your threats of torture are nothing more than
empty words. It is only a matter of simple life or death. If I live,
Golden Star will live. If I die, she will never draw the breath of
life--but what I have said, I have said. She shall only live as my
promised wife, bound to me by the most sacred oath that you can swear.
You cannot consummate your own marriage with her, because in the modern
world that is impossible.</p>

<p>'You are refusing simply because, for some reason or other, you
dislike me personally, but I don't propose that that shall stand in my
way. As for your treasures, their value has utterly changed for me. A
week ago, I frankly confess that I would have sold my soul, if I
thought I had one, for them. Now, without her, they would only make the
world a golden mockery to me, for I tell you, Vilcaroya, that I, who
have never loved living woman yet, love that beautiful shape of
inanimate flesh as that old sculptor we have told you of loved his
statue. Every hour that I have been alone in this room with her this
strange love of mine has grown. First it was only scientific curiosity,
then physical admiration, then something else. I don't know what it is,
for it is beyond the reach of my analysis, but I know enough of it to
call it love, and I tell you it is such love as only a man of my nature
and pursuits is capable of. Unsatisfied, it would consume me and kill
me, and I would rather die quickly than slowly. Now--once more--shall
Golden Star and I live or die?'</p>

<p>How was I to answer such a speech as this? I heard him in silence to
the end, my eyes held fast by his, and my spirit sinking as though
beaten down by the pitiless force of those cold words of his. And in
the meantime a great truth had been dawning in my mind. Force had
ceased to rule in this new world, and intellect had taken its throne. I
was the inferior of this man, whose trained mind was the heir of the
generations that had toiled and fought while I had slept. I was little
better than a savage before him, and I knew it, and he knew it, and,
bitter as the thought was to me, yet it was only the truth. I was
conquered, and a new gleam in his eyes told me that he had read my
thoughts before I had spoken them.</p>

<p>Then, while I stood hesitating before him, his white, hard-set face
softened, and his lips melted into a smile that was almost as sweet as
a woman's. It was that that saved me, for it reminded me of Ruth, and
the recollection of her told me that I loved even as Djama did. The
very thought of her put new blood into my heart. The words of yielding
and submission died unuttered on my lips. I raised my head, which I had
bowed down in dejection, and looked at him steadily again. Then I said
slowly, and in the voice of a man who does not speak twice,--</p>

<p>'I have thought, and I will speak for the last time. I will swear by
the sacred glory of the Lord of Light that Golden Star shall be yours,
upon two conditions.'</p>

<p>'Conditions!' said he, bringing his dark brows down till they made a
straight black line over his eyes. 'What are they?'</p>

<p>'These,' I said. 'You love and I love. First, then, you must win the
love of Golden Star, and, secondly, you must give me your sister,
Joyful Star, if I can win her love.'</p>

<p>'My sister Ruth to you! Is that your earnest, Vilcaroya, or are you
only trying my patience?'</p>

<p>The bitter, coldly-spoken words cut into my soul as the lash of a
whip cuts into the flesh. I could have slain him as he sat there
sneering at me, but it was a time for words, not deeds; and so,
mastering my anger as best I could, I took two swift strides to Golden
Star's bedside, and, snatching my dagger out of the sheath of the belt
which I had put on when I had dressed, I turned and faced him, and
said,--</p>

<p>'I am not jesting. As you love I love, and by the glory and majesty
of my Father the Sun I tell you if you do not say yes I will do with
this dagger what all your art will never repair, and then, if I must do
that, I will kill you too; and before to-morrow night has passed Joyful
Star shall be with me where none can find her. Now, what is your
answer--yes, or no?'</p>

<p>He looked at me and then at the dagger hanging in my hand, point
downwards, over the breast of Golden Star. Then his eyes fell upon the
still loveliness of her face. He knew that if he moved the dagger would
fall. His face, flushed a moment before, grew grey and pale again at
the sound of my words, and then I saw that he had not lied to me when
he said that his life would be worthless without her. Twice, thrice,
his lips moved without shaping a word. Then the words came. They were
dry and broken and trembling, for in the strength of my own love I had
now conquered my conqueror, and he said,--</p>

<p>'Yes, since it must be so. My sister for your sister. Well, I
suppose it's a fair exchange. We hate each other, you and I, but that's
an accident of fate. Take away your dagger. I know when I am beaten,
and I am beaten now. Will you swear that oath of yours again?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said, 'and you?'</p>

<p>I still kept the dagger within a span of Golden Star's heart, for I
still had but little trust in his faith. He rose from his chair,
throwing it over as he did so, and stood up and faced me, saying,--</p>

<p>'There is no need for oaths either from you or me. We have both too
much to lose to break faith. Put up your dagger and come away, and in
ten minutes from now you shall hear Golden Star draw the first breath
of her new life, and see her eyes open and look at you. That would be
worth more than any oath I could swear, wouldn't it?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said, 'but that is not all or enough. If you broke faith
with me after that, I should have to shed blood--my sister's and yours.
Now I need only make her life impossible. I will stop here. Go you and
wake your sister and bring her here. Then we will say more.'</p>

<p>'Bring Ruth here!' he cried, staring at me as though he wished, as
no doubt he did, that the fierce light in his eyes could blast and
wither me where I stood. 'Bring her here to see what no human eyes but
mine have ever seen. Bring her here to listen to what you have
said--and if her, why not Lamson and Hartness as well?'</p>

<p>'You may bring all, if you please,' I said, 'but Joyful Star must
come, no matter what she hears or sees. I have spoken--now go, or
Golden Star shall never wake again.'</p>

<p>The dagger-point dropped till it was within an inch of Golden Star's
breast.</p>

<p>He took a half pace towards me, with clenched hands and set teeth,
crouching like a mountain lion about to spring on its prey. The dagger
point dropped till it was only an inch from Golden Star's breast. If he
had made another step I would have driven it home. He read in my eyes
that I would do so, and he stopped. Then he hissed a curse at me
through his clenched teeth, and turned and walked away towards the
door. As he reached it he looked back, and saw me still standing there
with the dagger ready to do the work that could never be undone. I saw
his lips move, but heard no sound.</p>

<p>Then he unlocked the door, went out, and locked it after him,
leaving me there alone with my dead sister-love, whose new life, with
all its possibilities of love and happiness, or hate and misery, I had
thrown into the balance of Fate in the game that I was playing against
him to win that other love which had now become tenfold more dear to
me.</p>

<p>When he had gone I took his chair and put it by the side of the bed
and sat down, still holding my bare dagger in my hand and looking on
Golden Star's dead loveliness, wondering what it would be like when the
sunshine of her new life should shine upon it, and on whom her first
glance would fall, or whose name be the first that her lips would
speak, and as I sat and watched and waited it seemed to me as though
the ghosts of those long dead were taking shape and ranging themselves
about the bed of her re-awakening as they had done about the bed of her
falling asleep and mine.</p>

<p>I saw Anda-Huillac and his brother priests of the Sun standing about
me, gazing at me and at her with sad and dreamy eyes, like phantoms of
the past looking upon the realities of the present. Then the shape of
Anda-Huillac seemed to glide towards me. His ghostly eyes looked into
mine, and a smile of pity and reproach moved his pale lips. I felt a
cold, soft hand laid upon mine, my grasp relaxed and the dagger fell
ringing to the floor.</p>

<p>The sound awoke me, and my vision vanished. How long it had lasted,
or whether it was a vision of sleep or waking, I know not, but I was
awake now for I heard the door creek on its hinges. I picked the dagger
up again and started to my feet, and, still guarding Golden Star's bed,
I turned and faced Djama as he came in, followed by the professor and
Francis Hartness, with Joyful Star between them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI - THE WAKING OF GOLDEN STAR</h2>

<p>'There is your royal, would-be lover, Ruth! Come, if you don't
believe me, you can hear from his own lips that upon you, and you
alone, depends Golden Star's return to life: Is not that so, Your
Highness?'</p>

<p>It was Djama who said this, and as he said it, he caught Joyful Star
by the hand and half led, half dragged her towards me from between the
other two. But before he had come half the length of the room, Francis
Hartness had overtaken him in a few swift strides. I saw his hand fall
heavily on his shoulder, and with his other hand he took Ruth's out of
his. His blue eyes were nearly black with anger, and his bronzed face
was grey and set and pale with the passion that his strong will was
holding back, and his voice was low and clear, and vibrating like the
sound of a distant bell when he spoke and said,--</p>

<p>'I can't stand that, Djama. Are you forgetting that your sister is a
woman, and that you have brought her into the presence of the
dead?'</p>

<p>'You must be mad, Laurens!' said Joyful Star, before her brother
could reply. 'Surely this dreadful work of yours has turned your brain.
Vilcaroya, what does all this mean? Is Golden Star dead or alive? Ah,
how beautiful she is now! No, surely she cannot be dead!'</p>

<p>She had broken away from both her brother and Francis Hartness, and
as she said the last words she was leaning over Golden Star's pillow,
softly stroking her hair; and then she stooped lower and kissed her
forehead. Then the others came up to the bedside, Francis Hartness and
Djama in front, and the professor standing silent and wondering behind
them.</p>

<p>'If Djama won't speak, will you, Vilcaroya?' said Hartness, looking
at me with eyes that were still angry. 'What is that dagger in your
hand for, and what is the meaning of this story that he has been
telling me?'</p>

<p>'The meaning is of life or death,' I said. 'Laurens Djama will not
give Golden Star's life back to her if I will not swear to give her to
him when she lives again, and I have sworn that he shall not restore
her to life unless he swears to give Joyful Star to me, for I love her,
and will have neither life nor empire without her.'</p>

<p>As I listened to my own voice saying these bold words, it seemed to
me as though another were speaking, for, even in that hot moment of
passion and desperate resolve, I could scarce believe them mine. For
the instant, I thought Hartness would have struck me down where I
stood, nor could I have used my dagger against him, for he was a man
and I loved him, though I saw now that we both loved the same woman.
But before either of us could move, Ruth had risen erect and come
between us, her cheeks burning with shame and her eyes aglow with
anger.</p>

<p>'What!' she said, 'Laurens give me to you, Vilcaroya! Don't you know
yet that no one can give an English girl away except herself, and that
she only gives herself to the man she chooses of her own free will? Do
you think I am a slave or a human chattel to be bartered away like
that? Nonsense! And you, Captain Hartness, don't look so fiercely at
Vilcaroya. Remember that he is your friend and mine, or has been, and
has not the same ideas as we have. If he had-'</p>

<p>'He has,' I said, breaking in upon her speech, 'since Joyful Star
has spoken. He is not her lover but her slave, and she has shamed him.
I will eat the words that should never have been spoken. Let Golden
Star live! I will keep my oath and ask nothing in return.'</p>

<p>So the savage within me was tamed, and I, who but a few minutes
before had been ready to take two lives at the prompting of a single
word, dropped my dagger and stood with bowed head, humble as a chidden
child before her whose lightest word was then my most sacred law. I
raised my eyes and looked at her to see if my words had pleased her. As
our eyes met she gave me a glance that I would have died to win from
her, and then, pushing me and Francis Hartness gently aside, yet with a
force that neither of us could have resisted, she took her brother by
the arm and, leading him to the bedside with one hand, she laid the
other on Golden Star's brow, and said,--</p>

<p>'Laurens, can you really bring her back to life?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he answered, and I could see that he did not dare to raise
his eyes to hers, 'but-'</p>

<p>'But you will only do it for a price, you think. For shame! Is that
the way you would use this terrible power that you possess? Is my
brother so mean a creature as that? You love her, you say, even as she
lies there, neither dead nor alive? Well, when she lives, she will be
worthy of any man's love, but only of a man's, Laurens, and you would
not be a man, with all your learning and power, if you insisted on so
mean an advantage as your skill gives you. Do you mean to tell me that
you can look on such a beauty as that, knowing that you can restore it
to life, and yet ask a price before you will do it? Come, Laurens, that
is not like your old self. Use your power with the same generosity that
it has been given to you, and then win Golden Star like a man if you
can.'</p>

<p>Where my strength had been vanquished, her sweet wisdom conquered.
The man who had laughed at my threats, and told me without a quiver in
his voice how he could, and would, slay himself rather than I should do
what he knew I could do, stood humbled and abashed before the righteous
and yet gently-spoken reproach of her who was pleading for the life of
a sister woman.</p>

<p>I saw Djama's hands meet behind his back, and his fingers begin to
twine about each other. I saw him look from Ruth to Golden Star, from
the living woman who was his sister to her lifeless counterpart. Then
came over him one of those swift changes of mood which we had so often
seen before. All the cold cruelty of his long-chained-up passion
vanished. His face, from being stone, became flesh again. The fierce
glitter, as of a sword's point, died out of his eyes, and they grew
warm and soft again, and his voice was almost as sweet and gentle as
Ruth's, and strangely like it, too, as he answered her and said,--</p>

<p>'You are right, Ruth. I was not myself. I was a brute, unworthy
either of love or power. Let her die! Good God, I would die myself a
thousand times rather than do that! I must have been out of my senses
even to think of such a crime for a moment, but if you were a man and
had lived through what I have lived through for the last two days and
nights, you would understand me, and perhaps forgive me. Yes, she shall
live. How could I ever have thought of letting her die!'</p>

<p>Then he rose from his half-stooping posture over the bed, and came
to where I stood at the foot, and, with his hand outstretched and a
smile on his lips, said,--</p>

<p>'You have heard what I have just said, Vilcaroya. You have withdrawn
your conditions; now I will take back mine. It is no use for you and me
to be enemies. We have had our fight, and I confess myself beaten. Now
let us try to be friends for Ruth's sake and Golden Star's, and I
promise you that to-morrow morning you shall be telling her the story
of your resurrection and her own.'</p>

<p>For a moment I stared at him in, speechless wonder, striving to
understand how it could be that those eyes, which had, but a short time
before, been glaring hate at me, could now be looking so kindly and
frankly into mine; and how those lips, which had just been sneering so
coldly and cruelly alike at my love and my hate, could shape such
friendly and honestsounding words. Then I looked at Ruth, asking her
with my eyes what she would have me do, and in instant obedience to
what I saw took Djama's hand in mine and said,--</p>

<p>'So be it! The evil in our hearts has spoken, now let the good that
is there speak, and let us be friends; and, when Golden Star awakes,
with my lips she shall bless you and her who has made peace between us
where there was strife.'</p>

<p>'Miss Ruth, you really must allow me to congratulate you on your
success as a peacemaker,' said the professor, speaking now for the
first time since he had come into the room, and coming forward to where
Joyful Star still stood by the bedside. 'It would have been ten
thousand pities if this-ah-this little affair had ended any other way,
for all of the exquisitely perfect subjects-'</p>

<p>'Subjects, professor?' said Ruth, interrupting him with a laugh. 'Do
you venture to call Golden Star a subject, just as you do those awful
things in your dissecting-rooms? Look at her--a subject indeed! Don't
call her that again in my hearing, please!'</p>

<p>'Oh, ah, of course, I beg your pardon a thousand times, and Her
Highness's too. Really, I spoke quite thoughtlessly and most
improperly.' he answered, laughing at her mock displeasure, 'And now,
Djama, since we have had two declarations of love and a peacemaking,
don't you think it would be cruel to keep Her Highness waiting any
longer on the threshold of her new life? Come, Hartness, you and I have
no more business here at present. Don't you think we had better go and
wait somewhere else for the working of the miracle?'</p>

<p>'Just what I was going to say,' replied Hartness, who had gone away
a little distance from the bed while we were talking, and had been
standing by the table, seeming to examine the strange instruments that
were scattered about it. 'Of course the doctor will wish to finish his
work alone.'</p>

<p>'May not Vilcaroya and I stay, Laurens?' asked Joyful Star, looking
at him with appealing eyes. 'You know it will be much better for her to
see another woman by her when she awakes, and then she will recognise
Vilcaroya, and that will tell her that she is among friends.'</p>

<p>But Djama shook his head and said,--</p>

<p>'No, Ruth, not yet. There is something else to be done before
that--something, well, something that only a medical man ought to see
or do, and you really must leave me to do it alone. You forget, it is
not merely a matter of waking. She is not alive yet; but if you will
leave me alone for about half-an-hour, I promise you that I will call
you and Vilcaroya back before she actually wakes.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' she said, moving away from the bedside. 'I don't want
to pry into your mysteries.' Then she turned to me, and said, with a
faint smile on her lips, 'Vilcaroya, come into the dining-room, I have
something to say to you.'</p>

<p>She went down the room after the professor and Francis Hartness, and
I followed her with beating heart and anxious thoughts, wondering what
new lesson it was she was about to teach me.</p>

<p>Djama closed and locked the door after us. She led the way to the
dining-room, where there was a light burning. It was empty, for the
others, hearing what she had said to me, had gone out into the
courtyard. Then she turned and faced me with her back to the light; but
in spite of that I could see that her eyes were bright, and her fair
face flushed as she said to me in a low voice that trembled a
little,--</p>

<p>'Vilcaroya, I am going to forget everything that was said in the
room yonder, and--and you must forget it too. It was no time or place
for such things to be said, and you and Laurens were not yourselves
when you said them. If you do not forget them, we cannot be friends any
more. You understand me, don't you?'</p>

<p>Gentle and sweetly spoken as the words were, they fell upon my heart
like snow upon a fainting flame; yet I felt that, like all her words,
they were true and just. I crossed my hands on my breast with one of my
old-world gestures, and, standing so before her with bowed head, I
said,--</p>

<p>'The will of Joyful Star is my law. Let what I spoke in my madness
be forgotten as you have said. Who am I that I should say such
things?--a poor savage that has wandered from his own world into hers,
where he is a stranger!'</p>

<p>'No, not a savage, Vilcaroya. You must never say that word again.
How could Golden Star's brother be a savage? How could I--but there, we
have said enough for the present. We have other things to think of
now.'</p>

<p>With that she turned away and sat down in a long, low chair, resting
her cheek upon her hand, and looking out of one of the windows at the
stars, while I went and stood before another to look at the same stars
that she was looking at, and so we waited in silence until the door
opened, and we heard Djama's voice telling us that the long--expected
moment of Golden Star's awakening had come at last.</p>

<p>As Joyful Star went to the door I stood aside and waited for her to
pass me and go out first. As she went by our eyes met for a moment, and
I saw that hers were bright with tears. My heart leapt at the sight,
and then fell still again and well nigh fainting. What had she said to
me but a few minutes before? How dare I dream that those sweet tears
could be for me?</p>

<p>I followed her and Djama into the room, but half-way between the
door and the bed I stopped, not daring to go on, held back by some
impulse I could not name. I saw her lean over the pillow for a moment
in silence that for me was breathless. Then came a soft, sweet sound,
and then a little cry. Was it her's or Golden Star's?</p>

<p>Djama beckoned to me. I went with swift, silent steps to the foot of
the little bed, and saw Golden Star's eyes wide open and looking
wonderingly up into Ruth's face, and her red lips smiling at her. The
miracle had been completed. She had awakened her with a kiss.</p>

<p>'Come and give her your welcome back to life, Vilcaroya,' she
whispered, rising and turning her fair face with its wet cheeks and
smiling lips towards me. I went and stood over the pillow, and laid my
trembling lips on Golden Star's brow, and then I said, in the words
that had been the first of my own new life,--</p>

<p>'Cori-Coyllur &Ntilde;ustallipa, &Ntilde;usta mi!'</p>

<p>She looked at me, but there was no more recognition in her gaze than
in that of a newborn child, nor was there any answering smile upon her
lips. Unheeding this for the moment, I went on and said, still speaking
very gently and softly in our own tongue,--</p>

<p>'Thou art thrice welcome back from the shades of night into the
bright presence of our Father the Sun, oh, Golden Star! Dost thou not
remember me, Vilcaroya, thy brother, who went into the darkness with
thee long ago, and has been permitted to return before thee that he
might greet thee and bid thee welcome?'</p>

<p>Her eyes wandered from my face to Joyful Star's, and then she smiled
again, but no answering words came from her parted lips. Now, as we
looked from one another to her, a great fear came into all our hearts,
and Rath gave it voice.</p>

<p>'Laurens,' she whispered, laying her hands upon his arm, 'what is
the matter? Vilcaroya spoke at once, didn't he? Why doesn't she speak?
Oh, surely it can't be that she is--that she has come back to life
without memory or--or her reason? What is it?'</p>

<p>I waited for Djama's answer as a man might wait for words that were
to tell him whether he was to live or die. He put us both gently away
from the bed, and then, laying his hand on Golden Star's brow, he
looked long and steadfastly into her eyes. It seemed to me as though
Ruth and I could hear each other's hearts beating and counting off the
seconds until he raised his head again and said in the slow, even tones
of the man of science who, for the time, had overcome and banished the
lover,--</p>

<p>'Memory, perhaps, even probably; but reason, no. These are not the
eyes of an imbecile or an idiot, but they are the eyes of a child. It
is possible that when she fully recovers we may find her mind a perfect
blank--a virgin page on which the story of her new life will have to be
written.'</p>

<p>'Thank God for that!' she murmured, and I, too, echoed her words in
my heart, though I did not know then how much she meant by them.</p>

<p>Then once more she turned and went to Golden Star's pillow, laying
her hand upon her brow again, and looking fondly for a moment on the
silent and yet eloquent face that was looking up at her. Then she said
to her brother,--</p>

<p>'But is she well now? I mean, is her physical life certain? Will she
live and grow well and strong again?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he answered. 'I have done everything that it is in my power
to do. I have fulfilled my promise to His Highness. The rest is, as it
was with him, merely a matter of care and nourishment and nursing.'</p>

<p>'Then,' she said, with a swift, subtle change coming over her
manner, 'the care and the nursing must be mine, and you two must say
good-bye to her for the present, until I have nursed her back to
health. Of course you may see her when necessary, as her doctor, but
only as her doctor, mind. And you, Vilcaroya, must possess yourself
with what patience you can until my part of the work is done as well.
Now, go away, both of you. I am mistress here for the present. Laurens,
you go and get ready the nourishment that you think she should take,
and come back in half-an-hour, and tell me how it is to be taken.'</p>

<p>It was easy for us to see the deep yet kindly meaning of her
lightly-spoken words, for in them she had told us that Golden Star was
now once more a living woman. No longer a mummy, or a corpse, or a
'subject,' as the professor had called her--no longer an inanimate
thing that had neither sex nor claim to human rights--but a sister
woman of her own kind whose wants could only be supplied by her. So we
obeyed her, and went away, leaving her there to perform the most sacred
task save one that a loving woman could perform.</p>

<p>Djama went to prepare the food that Golden Star would soon need, and
I went in search of the professor and Francis Hartness, and told them
all that had happened, and then, when the professor had gone to bed to
finish his broken night's rest, I and he who was my rival in love, and
who was to be my brother-in-arms, went out from the courtyard into the
patio which lay in front of the house, sloping down towards the
entrance of the little valley in which the hacienda lay, and there,
walking to and fro side by side, we talked long and earnestly of many
things upon the doing of which my heart was set, and which might now be
freely entered upon, seeing that the first object of our journey was
already achieved.</p>

<p>Our talk, as you may well believe, was of war and not of love,
though it would be hard to say which of the two at that hour most
filled our secret thoughts; but, as I have told you, this English
soldier was a true man, and I trusted him, knowing well that though,
when the imperial Llautu once more encircled my brows, I might find
courage to seek openly the love of her into whose eyes I had already
seen him look with love, yet no falsehood or hatred could ever come
between us. So I told him freely of the treasures that I had only to
take from their hiding-places to make them mine, and spoke once more of
the use that I would make of them, and took his advice as to the best
method of that use.</p>

<p>This he was well able to give me, for I soon found that since he had
resolved to throw in his lot with us, he had applied himself diligently
to the task of studying the work that was to be ours, and seeking the
best and readiest means of doing it. In Lima and Arequipa he had bought
books and papers from which he had learned, as far as could be learned,
the resources and power of the government of Peru, the number of its
soldiers and their stations, the names and characters of the men who
made the government, and of those who were opposed to them, seeking, as
he told me was now ever the case in the countries of South America, to
overturn the government and to take for themselves the honours and the
profits of rule.</p>

<p>He told me--which events soon proved to be the truth--that not many
months would pass by before civil war once more broke out. The
President and the ministers, who were the tools of his tyranny, had
oppressed the people with grievous burdens till they could endure them
no longer, and already people in the towns of the interior were
refusing to pay taxes, and were arming themselves in secret and meeting
in bands among the mountains to practise themselves with their weapons,
and make ready for the war which was so soon to come.</p>

<p>All this, as he soon showed me, was happening as though the Fates
which rule the world had especially prepared it for my coming. The
people had no leader save a man who had been himself a tyrant before,
and none trusted him, but looked to him only to serve their own ends.
Those who had the power were hated, and those who sought to seize it
were distrusted.</p>

<p>But better than all was the utter, and, as far as all men, save
ourselves, could see, the hopeless poverty of the country. Long years
of plundering had emptied the treasury. Commerce was leaving the
shores, and industries were languishing throughout the land. No man
trusted his neighbour, for nearly all were in debt, and none could get
paid, and my own people, the slaves of the children of the Spaniards,
and the sport of their blind and brutal jesting, had borne their heavy
burdens till their backs were sore, sore as their patient hearts were,
and they would bear them no longer.</p>

<p>From the country which is called Ecuador, and which in my other life
had been Quito, the kingdom of Atahuallpa, to the southern confines of
Bolivia, which had once been part of the Land of the Four Regions, the
dominions of my own father, all were ready to throw down their
long-borne burdens and turn and rend their oppressors and those whose
fathers had robbed them of the land that had once been theirs.</p>

<p>I well remember the very words in which Francis Hartness told me all
this at much greater length than I have set it down here; and this is
what he said when, as the stars were paling in the sky above us and the
eastern mountains were beginning to stand out sharply against the
growing light of the coming dawn, our long talk drew to its
close,--</p>

<p>'In short, Vilcaroya, if I were given to that sort of thing, I could
believe that the very Fates themselves had conspired to prepare the way
for you. You have come back to the world and to your own country at the
very moment that these miserable wretches are getting ready to tear
each other to pieces. The government is as hopeless as it is
impossible, and the popular party, as they call themselves, have
neither a leader that they can trust, nor money to buy weapons and pay
their soldiers with. The treasury is empty, for, so to speak, almost
the last dollar had been stolen. The native troops have had no regular
pay for months, and I believe they would desert to a regiment if they
once believed that you are what you are, and that you possess, as you
do, the means of paying them well and honestly for their help.</p>

<p>'And, after all, I don't know that even I, as a soldier, could call
it desertion under such circumstances. You are of their own blood, the
son of one of their ancient kings. These people, these Peruvians, are
only mongrel descendants of those who have plundered and oppressed them
for centuries. They owe them no allegiance that is worth the name; but
you they would hail, not only as their lawful king, but almost as a
god--as, indeed, they could well be pardoned for doing, seeing what a
marvellous fate yours has been.</p>

<p>'The only thing to do at present, and the only thing in which I see
any difficulty, is to get into communication with them in such a way
that they shall come to know you without the authorities knowing
anything about you or your treasures. If that could be done, I think
all the rest would be easy, and then I believe that the moment you
raised the flag of the old Incas, they would flock to it in thousands,
and after that it would only be a matter of military management and
leadership.'</p>

<p>'And if I will charge myself with that, my friend,' I said, as he
paused for a moment; 'if I will promise you that before six more suns
have risen and set, the news of my coming shall be spread far and wide
through the land, and yet in such a manner that none but the faithful,
the Children of the Blood themselves, shall know anything that could
work us harm, will you give me the help of your skill and your
knowledge of the arts of this new warfare which is so strange to me?
Will you lead my armies to battle against the oppressors of my people?
Will you help me to free this land of my fathers from the yoke of its
tyrants, and be the war-chieftain of my people, and stand by my throne
in the days when the Rainbow Banner shall once more float over the
battlements of the Sacsahuaman and the City of the Sun? If you will,
you shall have riches and power and all that the heart of man can
desire.'</p>

<p>'Not all, I am afraid, Vilcaroya!' he said, interrupting me with a
laugh that had but little mirth in it. 'Not all; but that would not be
in your hands to give. Never mind, it is the fortune of war, or perhaps
I should rather say of love. But for the rest, yes. I believe your
cause is a just and righteous one, and what I can do to help it I will.
Henceforth we are brothers-in-arms, even though we may perhaps be
rivals in love. There, you have my hand upon it, and with it the word
of an Englishman who never broke his word yet to man or woman.'</p>

<p>How shall I tell you of the great joy with which those brave,
honest-spoken words of his filled me? He, the man whom I had feared
most, even as I had learned to love him most, was the first to bid me
hope--and hope I did now, in spite of all things. So, saying nothing,
for my heart was too full for speech, I put my hand in his, and there,
as the dawn brightened over the mountains, we clasped hands in silence
and sealed our compact, and when the sun rose swiftly over the now
glittering peaks, I let go his hand and bowed myself before it,
greeting it as the bringer of a new day which was to end the long night
that had fallen over my land and my people when the light of my last
life was quenched in the darkness of my death-sleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII - IN THE THRONE-ROOM OF YUPANQUI</h2>

<p>We saw nothing of Golden Star the next day, nor yet for many days
afterwards, for, in spite of our impatience, Ruth would not permit us
to do so. What her brother had said had speedily proved itself to be
true. She had come back to life a child-woman. Her body was that of a
girl of seventeen years--which was her age when she and I had drunk the
draught of the death-sleep together--and the kindly Powers that had
presided over her birth had shaped her in a mould of almost perfect
womanly beauty, yet, as Djama had said, her mind was a virgin page,
from which the story of her past life had been utterly erased, and on
whose blank whiteness the story of her new life had yet to be
written.</p>

<p>Now, on the writing of the first words of this story, as Joyful Star
told us in her sweetly-serious way the night that she had sunk into her
first natural slumber, everything might depend.</p>

<p>'It is a task,' she had said that night, 'which I fear terribly to
enter upon, and yet I know that I am the only one here who ought to
undertake it. She will need weeks and months of most careful watching,
and the sympathy that only another woman, and one who loves her as I
have already learned to do, could give her. No woman ever had such a
task before, and very few have had so good a work to do. There is
something, too'--and here I remember how subtle a change came into her
voice as she said this 'there is something in this wonderful
resemblance between us which tells me that this is my duty, and I am
going to devote myself absolutely to it during every hour of her waking
life until she is able to do without my care. I must watch her and care
for her as a mother does for her child, and you must let me do it alone
as long as I wish to, just as we had to let Laurens do his work alone.
Don't you think I am right, professor?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he answered, 'perfectly right, Miss Ruth. I am sure everybody
will agree with me that Her Highness could not be in better hands than
yours. Indeed, as you say, yours are the only hands in which she could
possibly be trusted with safety to her newly-awakening reason at such
an extraordinary juncture in her life.'</p>

<p>To this we all agreed willingly enough, and so Joyful Star had the
big room cleared out and installed herself there with all the comforts
and luxuries that the inexhaustible wealth which was now at my command
could provide her with, so that Golden Star should find her new world
as beautiful as might be. Meanwhile the professor, with a trusty guide
that I had provided him with from among my own people, plunged afresh
into his beloved studies with such ardour that he seemed to have almost
forgotten all else that had brought us to Peru.</p>

<p>Francis Hartness had gone with Tupac--who, in the sight of the
Spaniards, was only his Indian servant and guide--on a mission of
importance to the South, where the first rumblings of the coming
war-storm were already making themselves heard. As for Djama, who, as
you know, had no more interest in the work that now lay before Francis
Hartness and myself than the professor had, he went about for some days
gloomy and silent, and seemingly ill at ease, like a man who for a time
has lost his interest in life; and at last--it was on the twentieth day
after Golden Star had awakened--he came to me when I was alone in my
room and said abruptly,--</p>

<p>'Vilcaroya, do you think I have fairly earned my reward for what I
have done?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said, looking into his eyes and reading, though he knew it
not, the thoughts that were moving in his mind. 'You have done all that
you promised to do, but we have yet said nothing of the price. How much
do you ask for?'</p>

<p>'As much as I can get!' he said, with a laugh that pleased me but
little. 'But, of course, I know the work that you yourself have come
here to do, and I see that it will be expensive, so you will find me
reasonable.'</p>

<p>'And you, I hope, will not find me ungenerous. Do you remember what
you saw in the Hall of Gold?' As I said this, his self-command left him
for an instant. I saw his hands close, and his lips tremble, and the
fierce fire of the gold-lust spring into his eyes as he replied,--</p>

<p>'Yes; how could I forget it?'</p>

<p>'And do you remember, too,' I said, 'the words that you heard me
speak when I stood before the pyramid?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he replied, with a faint flush coming into his pale cheeks.
'It is not likely that I should forget them either. Why do you
ask?'</p>

<p>'Because,' I said, speaking slowly as a man who weighs his words
well, 'saving only the sacred emblems of the Sun, which it is not
lawful for me to give away, all that you saw there shall belong to you
and to him who made it possible for you to do what you have done. You
will share it as you please--that is no care of mine--but I have
conditions to make for my own sake and that of my people.'</p>

<p>'What are they?' and as he spoke the flush died out of his cheeks
again.</p>

<p>'That you shall both swear solemnly to me that, come what may, no
man shall ever know from you where the gold came from, and that,
moreover, you shall never utter any word of my story or Golden Star's
where mortal ears can hear it, nor give any sign or word to any man or
woman that shall lead him or her to guess that I am what I am, or that
my work here is what it is. Swear that oath to me and you shall take
your gold and go in peace. Break it, and the fate that I told you of
shall be yours. Are you content?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, 'and more than content; and I swear to you most
solemnly, on my own honour and by all that I hold sacred, that I will
keep your secrets absolutely.'</p>

<p>'No, not here,' I said, breaking into his speech; 'and more, it is
not only your oath that I want. There must be witnesses, for this is
too great a thing to do lightly. To-morrow night we will go back to the
Hall of Gold, and there you shall swear your oaths and they shall be
witnessed.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' he said. 'Whenever and whereever you like. But now,
Vilcaroya, I have something else to say to you. Personally, you know, I
have no further interests in Peru, saving one only. Your next few years
will be stormy ones, and though I believe that, with the power you have
behind you, you will win in the end, yet you know as well as I do that
you will have to run all the risks of a war that may be a very savage
one before you succeed. You may restore the throne of the Incas, and
reign upon it, or you may be killed in the first battle. You will
pardon me speaking so plainly, won't you?'</p>

<p>I bowed my head in silence and he went on.</p>

<p>'In view of this, then, I am going to propose that when we leave
Peru--I mean my sister and the professor and myself--you will allow
Ruth to take Golden Star to England with her, say, for three years or
so, in order that her education may be carried on to the best
advantage. I will promise you solemnly that during that time I will not
speak a word of love to her, or attempt to be anything else to her than
I am to Ruth, and then if you succeed in your aims, as I hope you will,
we will come back and be Your Majesty's guests for a time, and after
that we shall see what more the kindly Fates may have in store for you
and me.'</p>

<p>No man ever heard more fairly spoken or reasonable-sounding words
than these were, and yet all the while I listened to them I knew that
they were but used to hide the real thoughts of him who was speaking
them. Yet what could I answer him? Did they not seem to point out the
best of all courses that could be followed for the welfare of Golden
Star and the comfort of her whose gentle hand was leading her nearer
every day to the fulfilment of the promise of her new life? So, for
want of anything better in my mind, I answered,--</p>

<p>'Your words are unwelcome to me, for so long a parting would be a
great sorrow to me; yet they are wise, and that which is most pleasant
is not always the best to be done.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' he said, 'I quite understand you, so we won't say
anything more about it until then. I suppose I may tell the professor
about what we are to do to-morrow night?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said; 'there will be no harm in that, since a share of the
gold belongs to him as well.'</p>

<p>'And Hartness?'</p>

<p>'He knows already, for I have told him not only of the treasures in
the Hall of Gold, but of many others that will be used in the work that
he has sworn to do with me.'</p>

<p>Later on that day when the mid-day heat had cooled a little, I was
walking alone in the garden of the hacienda, thinking deeply of what
Djama had said and striving to find some plan of my own that would be
as good and yet not make the parting that I dreaded needful. I turned,
paying but little heed to my way, into a winding pathway shaded with
trees and bordered with grass and flowers. I was looking down upon the
ground, as was my wont, when I heard footsteps near me and looked up. I
had turned the bend in the path, and there, but a few paces from me,
stood Golden Star and Ruth. I started and made a motion as though I
would turn back, but Ruth immediately beckoned to me smilingly, and
said,--</p>

<p>'Come and let me introduce you to your sister, Vilcaroya. I think
it's time you began to be friends again. Don't you think she is looking
wonderfully well and strong, and--and beautiful?'</p>

<p>You may think, but I cannot tell you, of all the feelings that rose
up within me as I obeyed her invitation. It was the first time that I
had seen Golden Star since the night she had awakened. Nay, was it not
the first time I had seen her as a truly living woman since the night
of our bridal in the Sanctuary?</p>

<p>She was dressed in garments made after the fashion of Ruth's own, of
light grey soft stuff, and on the glorious wealth of her hair was a
broad-brimmed straw hat such as Ruth wore. Indeed, to look at them
both, standing there side by side, they could but have been taken for
two twin sisters-daughters of the Day and Night--as my loving fancy
called them afterwards--rather than the daughters of different peoples,
and children of far-parted generations, whose hands, as they clasped,
bridged the gulf between one age of the world and another.</p>

<p>As I approached, Golden Star's eyes looked at me with the simple
wonder that shines out of the eyes of a little child, and like a little
child she smiled at me, and then she looked at Ruth, and made a soft
low sound that was almost like the cooing of a child.</p>

<p>'She is pleased to see you, Vilcaroya,' said Ruth, taking hold of my
hand and hers, 'but of course she can't say so yet. Now, let me teach
her to shake hands with you.'</p>

<p>Then she put into mine the soft, warm little hand that I had last
clasped when we went hand in hand to the couch of our long sleep. I
pressed it gently, looking at her through the tears that rose into my
eyes, then I raised it to my lips and kissed it, and she smiled, and
made the little soft sound again, and then Ruth put her arm around her
waist and said,--</p>

<p>'Come, now, you are acquainted, and she likes you. This will be a
most valuable lesson for her. Now, let us have a walk, and you tell me
the news, if there is any.'</p>

<p>'Most willingly,' I said, 'for I have much news to tell.'</p>

<p>So we turned back along the path into the quietest part of the
garden, I walking by Ruth's side. And I told her of all that had passed
between her brother and me in the morning, and of what was to be done
on the following night. She was looking very serious when I had
finished, and I could see that many unspoken thoughts were working in
her mind, and when I had done she looked up at me and said,--</p>

<p>'Laurens's plan seems a very good one at first sight, but of course
we cannot decide upon anything until we have thought a good deal more
about it, and talked it well over amongst ourselves. But, at anyrate,
it would be several weeks yet before I would even think of going away
with Golden Star, so there is plenty of time for that. But to-morrow
night--Listen, Vilcaroya, may I ask a very great favour of you?'</p>

<p>'Joyful Star can ask no favour of me,' I said. 'She can speak, and I
can hear and obey.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense, Vilcaroya! I wish you wouldn't talk like that,' she
answered with pretty petulance. 'Now, suppose I was to ask you to let
me see this wonderful treasure-house of yours and promise faithfully
not to tell anyone about it--would you let me?'</p>

<p>'It is not the best that I can show you,' I answered gladly, 'but if
you desire to see it, it is yours and all that it contains. I can give
your brother and the professor other gold, and I will show you a
greater treasure-house than this under the Fortress itself.'</p>

<p>'Well,' she laughed, 'I won't say now that I won't have it, because
the sight of all that gold might be too much for me, but I should
dearly love to come and see it, and I think I might venture to bring
Golden Star too. She's quite well and strong now, and if we are careful
of her, it can't do her any harm, and it may do her good. Shall I bring
her?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said, 'why not?'</p>

<p>At this moment we saw Djama come walking down the path towards us,
and at the sight of him there came to me, like the stab of a dagger of
ice, the sudden memory that, at the moment I was speaking of my
treasure-house under the Sacsahuaman, I had heard a gentle rustle
behind some bushes close by the path, and a sound like that of a
stealthy tread.</p>

<p>As Djama came near to us I saw the love-light flash into his eyes,
and a swift flush rise into his sallow cheeks. He held out his hand and
quickened his pace, smiling as sweetly as a woman the while. I was
facing him a little in advance, and I heard behind me a sharp, low,
shuddering cry of terror that shook my heart as I turned to learn its
cause. Golden Star had thrown her arms round Ruth's neck, and was
clinging to her, trembling with fear, and looking sideways at Djama
with eyes fixed and wide open with terror.</p>

<p>You have seen how little children will go smiling and fearless into
the arms of one stranger and shrink in hate and terror from another.
Their sight is keener than it is in after years, when the dust of the
world's conflict has dulled it, and they can see plainly the good and
the evil that is hidden behind the mask of the face. So it was with
that child-soul of Golden Star's. Though I was now to her as strange as
Djama, yet she had seen in me only the friend and brother who loved her
and wished her well, and whose heart was clean in her sight; but in
Djama she had seen at a single glance the evil that had only been
revealed to me after many weeks of watching.</p>

<p>Though I hated him for the fear that he had caused her, yet I was
glad also, for now I saw that the answer to his proposal would be
easier than I had thought for. As for him, his face darkened and his
black brows came together, and the love-light in his eyes changed to a
glare of anger; but this was only for an instant. It passed more
quickly than the thunder-clouds melt round the crest of Illampu. He
stopped, and stood with his head slightly bent and his hands spread,
palms outward, in the posture of one who asks pardon, and said, in a
voice that had no trace of anger,--</p>

<p>'Forgive me, Ruth! I am afraid I have startled our patient--or
perhaps I should rather say yours now. It was something more than
stupid of me to come upon you suddenly like this, without any warning.
Of all people in the world, I ought to have known better than that. But
I suppose seeing Vilcaroya already here made me forget myself. Did she
start like that when he came?'</p>

<p>'No,' replied Ruth, still standing with her arm where she had thrown
it around Golden Star's shoulders, and stroking her hair with the
other. 'She-she saw him farther off than you, and I took her towards
him, so I suppose the shock was not so great. But please go away, both
of you, now. You see she is terribly frightened, and she is trembling
as though someone had struck her. I must take her into the house and
get her quiet again, or the consequences may be serious.'</p>

<p>Djama turned away without a word, his face darkening again as he did
so, and with one backward glance at Golden Star, who had now raised her
head from Ruth's breast, and was staring after us with fixed, wide-open
eyes, I turned and walked away beside him, neither of us speaking a
word, for we were both too busy with our own thoughts.</p>

<p>That night Francis Hartness and Tupac returned from their journey to
the South, and as the professor was also in the house I told them of
what I wished done on the following night, and bade Tupac make all
preparation. The next day we all started in the cool of the morning to
go to the Rodadero as though for a picnic, as the people of Cuzco often
do, so that there might be no suspicion of our true object. We all rode
upon horses, saving Golden Star, who was carried in a hammock litter,
that I had had made for her, and Tupac, and six of our people who came
with us as bearers and servants.</p>

<p>We spent the day wandering about among the huge ruins of the
Sacsahuaman, and exploring the wonders of the carved rocks and
underground passages and altar-places, which have been the marvel of
every traveller to the hills about Cuzco, and all that I knew of the
upper works I told my companions, and showed them as well as I could
what the mighty fastness had been in the days of its pride and unbroken
strength.</p>

<p>Then, when the brief twilight came, I bade one of our men take the
beasts into a chamber among the rocks that I had shown him, and where
plenty of fodder had been stored a few days before. After this we
waited a little longer till night fell, and then I bade Tupac do what I
had bidden him the day before. His voice rose shrill and plaintive in
the silence, chanting a song that you may have heard the Indians
singing in Peru when returning from their labours, and presently, from
among the rocks on the plain, and from the shadowy lines of the
Fortress, many silent figures stole out and went towards the valley in
which the Sayacusca stands.</p>

<p>Then I told my companions that all, save those of the Blood, must
have their eyes bandaged, as Djama's had been before, and when they had
submitted willingly to this, knowing that no harm would come to them,
we led them to the Sayacusca, I leading Ruth by the hand, and following
the bearers of Golden Star's litter, and there the way to the Hall of
Gold was opened as before, and we entered it, followed by a long line
of the Children of the Blood.</p>

<p>But I made no halt here, nor did I let my companions even see the
treasure that was to be divided between Djama and the professor
according to my promise, for I had greater marvels in store for them.
So, lantern in hand, I led the way through a winding gallery behind the
pyramid of gold of which I told you before. At the end of this was a
door, formed by a revolving stone similar to that at the entrance to
the hall. This Tupac and another opened under my directions, and we
entered a long, straight passage behind it. At the end was a broad
flight of stone steps, and at the top were two low bronze doors bolted
into pillars on either side. The doors had no hinges, but they turned
with the pillars, and no one who did not know this, or how the pillars
turned, could open them. But this secret was one of many others that I
had brought with me from the past, and in a few moments the doors were
standing open before us.</p>

<p>We passed in, and I closed them behind us. Two of my men had come
laden with great candles and torches, and these I had lighted and
placed in golden sconces which stood out from the walls in the great
hall into which we had passed through the bronze doors. When this had
been done, I beckoned to Tupac, and went silently with him to the other
end of the hall, where, on a throne of gold under a canopy of silver,
sat a silent figure clad in the imperial robes, and with a mask of
beaten gold over its face, according to the ancient custom. It was the
effigy of the great Yupanqui, father of Huayna-Capac, which had been
seated here since his death, as an emblem of the unbroken sovereignty
of his race, giving place in turn to his son and grandson on the days
that they were crowned, and being replaced when the ceremony was
over.</p>

<p>Now, with Tupac's help I carried the effigy into a little chamber
behind the throne, and there quickly removed my upper clothing and
dressed myself as I had done before in the Hall of Gold, and took my
place on the throne. Then I bade Tupac lead Joyful Star, with her eyes
still bandaged, to me. When he had placed her before me, I made a sign
to him, and the bandage fell from her eyes. She turned white as death,
and staggered back a pace, with her hands clasped to her temples, and
there she stood, staring wide-eyed at me and all the splendours about
her.</p>

<p>Wherever her gaze wandered it saw nothing but gold and silver and
gems and rich-dyed hangings of silk and wool, whose brilliant hues no
time could dim. The roof and the upper halves of the walls were covered
with plates of burnished silver. Around the walls, half-way between the
floor and the ceiling, ran a great cornice or ledge of gold, on which
stood the golden chairs in which were seated the mummies of the twenty
Incas which I had last seen in the Sanctuary of the Sun, looking down
through the eye-holes in their golden masks.</p>

<p>From the cornice to the floor hung the bright-hued hangings, and
against these were ranged along the floor on either side threescore
seats of silver, and the floor was paved with diamond-shaped blocks of
gold and silver set alternately. Behind the throne on which I sat rose
from the floor to roof a sloping wall of golden ingots, and on either
hand stood a great golden vase, heaped high with unset gems, emeralds
and diamonds, pearls and sapphires and rubies, precious almost beyond
price; and on the roof above my throne a great, golden image of the
Sun, encircled by spreading rays of gems, glowed and sparkled in the
light of the candles and torches.</p>

<p>At last Ruth's wandering gaze became steady and rested upon my face,
and I looked back into her eyes, making no sign until she should speak,
and sitting motionless as the effigy whose place I had taken.</p>

<p>'Where am I?' she said at last in a low, faint voice, like one
awakening from a dream. 'And who are you? Surely you cannot be--and
yet, yes, you are Vilcaroya! What has happened?'</p>

<p>'Nothing more than the granting of Joyful Star's request, save that
through the treasure-house which she asked to see I have brought her to
a better one. Does it please her?'</p>

<p>'Is it real, Vilcaroya?' she whispered. 'Is all this really gold and
silver, and are these real diamonds and rubies and emeralds, or am I
only dreaming? Does it please me? What a question! I have never even
dreamed of anything like it. Where are we, Vilcaroya?'</p>

<p>'In the throne-room of the Incas, beneath what was once their palace
and fortress on the hill of Sacsahuaman,' I answered, 'and this is the
throne of the great Yupanqui, the greatest earthly king and conqueror
of my race. I sat here and crowned myself Inca in the presence of
Anda-Huillac and the priests and nobles of the Land of the Four Regions
on the day before the night when I drank the death-draught with Golden
Star.'</p>

<p>'Ah, yes, where is she?' she cried, looking round only to see that
all the rest had vanished, and that she and I were alone in the great
hall. 'What have they done with her, and where are Laurens and the
others?' she cried, looking fearfully and almost mistrustingly at me.
'What have you done with them, Vilcaroya?'</p>

<p>'They are safe,' I said. 'Tupac and his men have care of them, and
they will come back when I bid him bring them. But I have need of your
presence here alone before I do that,' I went on, rising from my seat
as I spoke. 'Has Joyful Star ever sat on a throne?'</p>

<p>'No,' she stammered, staring at me with wonder in her eyes. 'You
know I haven't. Why should you ask?'</p>

<p>'Then sit on mine,' I said, I for I have something to say to you
which I can best say and you can best hear if we change places. Nay, I
will take no denial,' I said, drawing her by the hand up the steps in
front of the throne, 'for it is not only your--your friend who is
asking, but a crowned king in his own palace, who is lord of life and
death over all who enter it.'</p>

<p>Half frightened and half wondering, she submitted to my will and
allowed me to seat her in the chair which no woman had ever sat in
before. Then I took her hand, and, dropping on one knee on the upper
step, I said,--</p>

<p>'Joyful Star has taken one queen from me, and she alone can give me
another to fill her place. She is sitting where the great Yupanqui sat
when he ruled all the land from north to south, and from the eastern
mountains to the sea, and ere long I too shall reign, sole and
undisputed lord, over a realm wider even than that. Many things have
been done that Joyful Star knows not of since I came back to my country
and my people. Through all the Land of the Four Regions the word has
gone forth, with the swiftness of thought, that the Son of the Sun has
returned, and that the heir of the divine Manco has come to deliver his
children from bondage.*</p>

<p>* The Inca Indians of the Sierra region possess the same
extraordinary faculty of transmitting intelligence without apparent
material means that the Hindoos and the Arabs have. Thus, during the
last revolution in Peru, the fall of Lima was known to the Indians of
Bolivia on the southern shore of Lake Titicaca three days after it
happened, though the telegraph wires were cut and all ordinary
communications suspended. Without the telegraph this would be quite
impossible by any means known to Europeans.</p>

<p>'Everywhere the tidings have been received with joy, and the people
are longing to return to the allegiance of their fathers, and tread
their oppressors under foot. Before many days civil war will be raging
throughout the lands of the south, and I have but to set flowing that
golden stream, one of whose many sources is here, and say, "Here is
gold and silver in plenty for all who will fight under the Rainbow
Banner," and I shall have armies and fleets to do what I will with, and
the sway of my sceptre shall reach from north to south and sea to
sea.</p>

<p>'This I shall do because of my oath; but I have brought Joyful Star
here to tell her, in the most sacred place that is left in the Land of
the Four Regions, that I shall also do it so that she, if she will, may
be queen where I am king, and sit beside me on my throne, and make my
empire a paradise by the brightness and the sweetness of her presence.
I cannot forget, as she bade me do--for the words that I said in the
heat of my passion are true--for I love you, Joyful Star, and all that
I have or shall ever have on earth will be worthless to me unless you
take it as a gift from my hands. Nay, do not speak, for now I seek no
answer, whether good or evil. I have brought you here that I, as a
king, might kneel at the feet of her whom I would win for my queen, and
from now until I sit in the sight of all the world on the throne of the
Four Regions no other words of love shall pass my lips. So you shall
have many days to ponder what I have said, and to ask your own heart
whether it will say "yes" or "no" to me when I stretch out my hand from
my throne and ask you to come and sit beside me and rule my people with
me.'</p>

<p>Before she could answer, I stood up and clapped my hands, and Tupac
with six others, dressed now in the forbidden costume of their
ancestors, entered the hall from the ante-chamber, into which they had
taken the others, and came towards me, bearing wands across their
shoulders in token of homage, and with heads downbent, not daring to
look upon my majesty till I bade them. I drew Joyful Star from the
throne by the hand, and seating myself in it, said in the ancient
tongue,--</p>

<p>'Let the Children of the Blood enter into the presence of their
father and their lord, and let the strangers be brought in, and the
other maiden, all with eyes bandaged, and let seats of silver be placed
to the right and left of the throne, one for each of the virgins of the
Sun to sit upon. Are all things else ready, Tupac-Rayca?'</p>

<p>'Yes, lord,' he answered, stepping out in front of the others and
falling on his knees, 'and the Children of the Blood are waiting to see
the glory of thy presence and hear the words of wisdom and hope from
thy lips.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII - HOW THE SOUL OF GOLDEN STAR CAME BACK</h2>

<p>When the two chairs had been brought in and placed according to my
orders, I rose from my throne and led Joyful Star to the one on my left
hand and placed her in it, still silent with the wonder and perplexity
of what she had seen and heard since her eyes were opened. Then,
seating myself again, I bade Tupac summon the Children of the Blood to
take their places, and presently he ushered them in from the chambers
that opened out of the great hall on either hand at the other end.</p>

<p>There were threescore of them, the heads of the families of Ayllos,
whose blood was the purest and whose descent was most direct from the
old nobility of my own days. Each of them, too, under the outward husk
of his forlorn and degraded state, had preserved unsullied the ancient
faith and traditions of the sacred race, and, against all appearances,
had steadfastly hoped for the fulfilment of the promises that had been
given in the olden times. More than this, too--each had treasured, as a
miser hoards his gold, the ever-growing legacy of hate which the
oppression and contempt of the Spaniards and their meaner descendants
had heaped up from generation to generation against the long-awaited
day of vengeance which, as but two or three in that strange company
alone knew, was now so near at hand.</p>

<p>Ever since I had revealed myself to them in the Hall of Gold they
had been working for the end in view with the swift, subtle arts known
only to those of their race, and already, from Quito in the north to
Santiago in the south, tidings had gone forth that the day of
deliverance was approaching, and that ere long the Rainbow Banner would
be raised by the hands of him for whom the Children of the Sun had
waited.</p>

<p>Each of the fathers of the people was dressed, as Tupac was, in the
long-forbidden garb of the ancient nobility, and each as he entered
stopped in the centre of the hall and paid his homage before he went to
his seat. Then, when all were seated, I ordered that the strangers
should be brought in, and they were led into the midst of the silent
assembly, with their eyes still bandaged. Over Golden Star's head a
veil had been thrown, hiding her face, for it was my purpose that it
should not be seen for the present, and how strangely this purpose
worked you shall soon see.</p>

<p>As she came up the middle of the hall, following Tupac, who was
leading her as obedient as a little child, I descended from the throne
and went to meet her, and led her to the seat on my right hand and
placed her in it. Francis Hartness, the professor and Djama I left
standing in the middle of the hall, each with one of Tupac's chosen
guards beside him. When Golden Star was seated, I stood up in front of
the throne and said to those assembled, speaking in the ancient
tongue,--</p>

<p>'Sons of the Blood and fathers of the Oppressed, you know already
how the promise that was made by our Father the Sun, through the lips
of his high priest, in the days when first the oppressors came, has
been in part most faithfully and marvellously fulfilled. I,
Vilcaroya--son of Huayna-Capac, son of the great Yupanqui Inca, before
whose throne-seat I am now standing alive in your presence--am he of
whom it was said that one who should pass from life to life through the
shadows of death should grasp the sceptre of the divine Manco, and
restore the ancient glory of the Children of the Sun. And with me, as
you know, there was another, at whose call and for love of whom I dared
the ordeal of the death-sleep and swore the oath which I have returned
to the world of living men to fulfil. I have already given you some
proof that I am what I say I am, for I have revealed to you secrets
which were buried in the grave with me and in those faithful hearts
which have been pulseless now for many generations.</p>

<p>'But now, that all things may be made plain to you, and that no
doubts may remain in your hearts to hinder the working of our sacred
purpose, I have brought here before you witnesses of the wonders that
have been worked--even those who wrought them themselves, that their
own lips may tell you the story; and with them I have brought yet
another witness who, though she cannot speak to you in our ancient
tongue, of which our Father, for his own wise purposes, has deprived
her during her long sleep, will yet in her own person and even with
silent lips be witness enough that I have not lied to you. Now let the
eyes of the strangers be uncovered and their mouths opened that they
may see and speak.'</p>

<p>Even as the words left my lips they were obeyed, and at the same
time I stretched out my right hand and raised the veil from the head of
Golden Star, and unloosed the bandage from her eyes.</p>

<p>A deep murmur of wonder ran round the hall; a sharp cry of amazement
broke from Djama's lips, and the two others stared blankly about them.
Then I raised my left hand to command silence, and, still speaking the
ancient speech and pointing with my right hand to Golden Star,
said,--</p>

<p>'This, O Fathers of the People, is she who drank the death-draught
with me. This is Cory-Coyllur, daughter of Huayna-Capac, and sister of
the long-ago murdered Huascar, and my sister, too, since her great
father was mine also. With her, as the tradition was told to you, I
plighted the marriage--troth before the altar in the Sanctuary of the
Sun, and of that troth I would speak to you now. Such marriage is no
longer lawful in the world to which we have returned, and in token of
this our Father the Sun has sent this other likeness of Golden Star,
who sits upon my left hand, to tell me that it may not be; and to make
the message surer, it has pleased him also to put into my heart, a love
for her differing from, though not greater than that which I have borne
for Golden Star, and if my Father who has given me this love shall also
look with kindness upon my longing, then Joyful Star, as I have named
her, shall be my Coya* and my queen, and Golden Star shall be her
sister and mine, and I doubt not that in his own good time our Father
will send her a fitting mate, that her heart may not be empty nor her
life lonely.'</p>

<p>*The queen-consort of the Inca, as distinguished from the many
others whom the ancient laws allowed him to marry.</p>

<p>As I said these last words I saw the eyes of all who were sitting in
the chairs turn, as if moved by one impulse, and rest on Francis
Hartness, standing strong and stately in the midst of the little group
in the middle of the hall, overtopping the others by nearly a span, and
crowned with his curling golden hair; and as I, too, looked at him, a
new thought came into my mind, and I spoke aloud again and said,--</p>

<p>'Yes, Brothers of the Blood, I read your thought. The stranger from
the land which is the greatest of all lands in the world of today, is a
true Son of the Sun, though not of our blood, for his heart is clean
and his tongue is straight and his arm strong, and perchance it may
please our Father to bring about that which he has put into our
hearts.'</p>

<p>At this another murmur ran round the hall, and every head was bowed
in assent.</p>

<p>Now all this time the three Englishmen had been standing patiently
in the midst of the hall, looking about them at its splendours, and
waiting till I should speak to them, for the professor knew enough of
the Quichua tongue to follow what I had been saying, and had told the
others that I was speaking of them. Now I spoke to them in English, and
told them what I had brought them to the throne-room for, and then I
had chairs placed for them at top of the hall, to my left hand.</p>

<p>When they had taken their places, I asked the professor to speak in
Spanish to those assembled, and tell them whether or not the story of
my return to life was true, and whether or not Golden Star had been
found where Anda-Huillac and the priests had placed her, and had been,
like me, restored to life by the arts of Djama his friend. This he did
in few, straight words, and after him Djama rose at my bidding and told
them also what he had done. When he had finished I took the Llautu from
my head and raised it above me with outstretched arms and said in a
loud voice,--</p>

<p>'If you, O Children of the Blood and Sons of the Ancient Race,
believe now that I am in truth Vilcaroya, son of Huayna-Capac, and
lawful heir of the divine Manco, from whom all the Incas of our race
draw their royal blood, then take me for your lord as my father was the
lord of your fathers; or if any shall have yet doubt in his heart, let
him speak now or for ever be silent.'</p>

<p>Then with one accord they rose from their seats and came before me
and prostrated themselves on the shining pavement of the throne-room,
and began to chant, in a low, soft tone, the Song of Homage with which
of old the new-crowned Incas had been hailed, generation after
generation, Sons of the Sun and lords of life and death throughout the
Land of the Four Regions.</p>

<p>And now a wondrous thing happened. As I stood there facing the
prostrate throng, lowering the Llautu on to my head, I heard a low,
sharp cry beside me on my right hand. I turned half round, and there I
saw Golden Star staring at me with eyes burning with the light that
shone through them from her new-awakened soul.</p>

<p>Her hands were clasped to her temples, pushing back her thick,
bright hair from her forehead. Her face was flushed, and her half-open
lips were working as though they were striving to shape some
long-forgotten words. At the instant that the Llautu touched my brows,
she rose to her feet. Then a cry burst from her lips and went ringing
down the hall, and the next moment she had thrown herself forward and I
had caught her in my arms.</p>

<p>As I did so our eyes met, and our hearts looked at each other
through them. In that one burning glance the mists of the long years
were melted, all things else were forgotten, and for the moment we
stood alone--the children of a long-dead generation--in the solitude
that our strange fate had made about us. Then her lips moved, not
dumbly this time, and in a voice that woke, who shall say how many
memories in my heart, she said,--</p>

<p>'Have they awakened us, my lord? Tell me how long we have slept, my
Vilcaroya. It seems long to me, and I have had strange, dim dreams, and
thought I was not one, but two, and that one of myselves was your
sister and the other was your Coya and queen. It was strange, was it
not, to dream like that?'</p>

<p>'Not so strange but that it may be true, O my sister, Golden Star,'
I said, my wonder for the moment overcome by a new hope that uprose
within me at her words. 'Stranger things than that have happened since
we fell asleep together in the distant days that are no more. See,
&Ntilde;usta mi, here is your other self, the living shape of that
sister-soul of yours, who has watched over you and cared for you and
loved you since you drew the first breath of your new life. She cannot
speak our tongue, for she is the daughter of another age than ours, but
she has taught me hers and I will speak for you.'</p>

<p>As I said this I took her hands from where they rested on my
shoulders, and led her to the seat of Joyful Star, who was standing in
front of it, with one hand on the arm of her chair and the other one
clasped to her heart, her face white with fear and her eyes wide with
wonder.</p>

<p>'What has happened, Vilcaroya?' she said, in a voice so low that it
was almost a whisper. 'Has her memory come back, and does she believe
herself to be your--your wife?'</p>

<p>As she forced the last word from her hesitating lips I saw the hot
blood flow into her cheeks, and a new light that shot like a dart of
fire into my heart leapt into her eyes.</p>

<p>'No,' I said, with a smile that was quickly answered by one that
came unawares to her lips. 'She calls herself my sister and me her
lord, and says that she has dreamed that she is not one but two, and
that her other sister-self is Vilcaroya's wife and queen. Now, if that
dream may be the truth, tell her so!'</p>

<p>And with that I took her hand gently from where it rested on the
chair and laid Golden Star's in it.</p>

<p>'But-I cannot speak your language, and she wouldn't understand me,'
she said softly, with one swift glance at me and another longer look at
Golden Star's smiling face, so wondrous like her own.</p>

<p>'There is another speech than that of the tongue,' I answered,
'which all men understand.'</p>

<p>'Yes!' she said, and then she drew Golden Star gently to her and
kissed her.</p>

<p>All this while the Ayllos had remained silent and prostrate before
the throne, none daring to raise their heads till I bade them, and the
three Englishmen sat still, hearing what I had said to Joyful Star and
her answer to it, and yet neither speaking nor rising from their seats,
each full of his own thoughts and not willing to betray his feelings by
any rash word that he might speak in the wonder of the moment. But now
I turned with my heart full of joy and new hope, and said in a voice in
which my gladness seemed to sing like a bird in the morning sky,--</p>

<p>'Rise up, Brothers of the Blood, and look upon your lord and rejoice
with him, for our Father the Sun has looked kindly upon him and filled
all his life with light. He has given back memory and speech to Golden
Star, his daughter, and put it into the heart of Joyful Star, her other
sister-self, to love her and to make plain that which might else have
been dark.'</p>

<p>Then they all rose to their feet and saluted me and paid their
homage to Golden Star and Joyful Star as well, and then I waved them to
their seats, and when they had gone I led Golden Star back to her
chair, and then I called Djama to me, and when he came and stood before
me I said,--</p>

<p>'You have seen what has happened, and you have heard the words that
have been said. You see now that there is no need for Golden Star to go
to England. Therefore it remains but for you and for your friend to
take the treasure that is yours, and for us to say farewell.'</p>

<p>'And Ruth?' he asked. 'You know, of course, that that will mean
farewell to her also.'</p>

<p>I could see that he was ill at ease, and that his words were not the
words that his true thoughts would have spoken. As I looked at him I
saw that his eyes shifted and wandered from my gaze, and I said
coldly,--</p>

<p>'Much has happened since we last spoke of this. It will be for
Joyful Star herself to say whether she will bid me farewell or not. Is
she not free to go or stay where she pleases? Say, now, when I shall
command the treasure to be taken out of the Hall of Gold for you, and
where you wish it to be placed.'</p>

<p>'I must ask you to give me time to think about that and talk it over
with the professor,' he said, 'for we have no means of taking such an
immense amount of gold to the coast and getting it on board ship
without suspicion.'</p>

<p>'Go, then,' I said, 'and speak with him, but remember that it must
be done quickly, for ere many days are past there will be war in the
land, and neither your lives nor your gold will be safe.'</p>

<p>'I will take good care of that,' he said in a tone whose strangeness
told me more than his words, and with that he turned away and sat down
beside the professor, with the thoughts that were within his heart
still unspoken. As soon as he had gone back to his seat I called
Francis Hartness to me and set him beside me on the right hand of the
throne, and then I told who he was and showed that he was well skilled
in those new arts of warfare which had taken the place of our ancient
methods, and how he had promised to use his knowledge for me and lead
my armies into battle, hazarding his own life on the chance of our
success; and when I had said this I named him leader of all those who
should range themselves under the Rainbow Banner when the day of battle
came, and bade all present obey his orders and enforce obedience to
them, even as though his commands were my own.</p>

<p>Then I bade Francis Hartness himself speak all that was in his mind
freely and without fear of betrayal concerning the war that was soon to
be waged between the rival factions of our oppressors and the means
that were to be used to turn their strife to our own account, and this
he did, speaking in fluent Spanish and in short, clear sentences, as a
man of action and a soldier should speak.</p>

<p>He told how he had made himself acquainted with the forces on both
sides, and how, with the help of Tupac, he had sounded the feelings of
those by whom the fighting would have to be done, and had found them
willing to leave the service of the schemers who sought to make
themselves tyrants over the land, and fight for those whose purpose it
was to restore the ancient rule and give liberty to all to use their
lives as they thought best and to win for themselves as many of the
gifts of the All-Father as they were able to do. He told, too, how he
had sent many messages over the lightning-wires to his own country,
bidding friends like himself in war to come out as quickly as might be
to find the fortune that awaited them, yet saying nothing of war but
only of gold that was to be had for the taking.</p>

<p>When he had finished, I bade Tupac summon all who were present to
the foot of the throne, and then I spoke to them of the plans that I
had made with Francis Hartness in all their details, and showed them
how each, according to his opportunities, could give his help in
carrying them out, and then, as by this time the night was far spent
and there was yet work of another sort to do, I sent them back to their
seats, and calling Ruth and Golden Star to me, I bade them follow me,
and led the way down the hall and through one of the passages at the
end until I brought them to a chamber which Tupac and his comrades had
already prepared for them by my orders, and here I left them to take
their rest together, promising to return in the morning.</p>

<p>When I got back into the throne-room Djama asked me whither I had
taken his sister, and I told him what I had done, saying that the hour
was now too late for us to return to our home on the other side of the
valley, and that, moreover, it was needful for us to go back to the
Hall of Gold to make a proper count of the treasure and to let him and
the professor swear their oaths of secrecy in the presence of the
fathers of my people.</p>

<p>Then I left him, looking much more ill at ease than such tidings
should have made him feel, and told Tupac in the ancient tongue to take
three of his companions and go and do that which it was now time to do.
So he went and chose his men and departed through the bronze doors by
which we had entered the hall. After that I named a guard to remain all
night in the hall, and bade the rest go and put on their everyday
clothing, and I, too, went back into the chamber behind the throne and
changed my imperial garments for the others that I had put off.</p>

<p>Then I ordered the torches and candles to be extinguished, all
saving a few that were left for the guards, and then the eyes of Djama
and the professor were bandaged afresh, though those of Francis
Hartness--he being now one of us and devoted to our cause--were left
open; and when this was done the lanterns were lit and I led the way
into the ante-chamber of the throne-room, where the bronze doors still
stood open as Tupac had left them.</p>

<p>I stood by them till the last man had passed out, then I went
through and closed them. Then I followed the rest and again placed
myself at their head. But when we reached the end of the straight
passage, instead of turning the revolving pillar which closed the
entrance of the winding passage leading to the Hall of Gold, I sought
about with my lantern on the floor until I found three marks in the
shape of a triangle in one corner of a great square slab of stone, and,
taking a long staff which one of the men carried, I placed the end on
the triangle and calling two others to help me, we bore downwards with
all our weight, and when we had thrust awhile on the staff the corner
of the slab sank into the floor and it turned on a diagonal axis until
it stood upright, leaving a three-cornered space large enough for a
man's body to pass through easily, Then I made a sign to one of the
Ayllos and said,--</p>

<p>'Anahuac, take your lantern down there and light the way down the
steps.'</p>

<p>'Truly there are no secrets in the land hidden from the eyes of our
Lord!' he said, glancing round in wonder at the rest, and then he
lowered himself with his lantern into the hole and disappeared.</p>

<p>Then I bade the rest follow him one by one, and so all went down, I
going last with Francis Hartness, who helped me to put the stone back
into its place.</p>

<p>Our way now led along a rough-hewn gallery that sloped gently
upwards for some twelve hundred paces, and at the end of it there was a
little chamber measuring some twenty feet each way and having no
apparent outlet, but in the middle of one of the walls there was
another of the cunningly-constructed revolving stones which our ancient
masons ever used to bar their secret ways, and this three of our men,
working as I told them, turned on its hinge, and through the opening
that was thus made we passed out in single file to a little rock-walled
valley over which the stars were shining.</p>

<p>The door was closed behind us, and dust and dirt were rubbed over
the thin lines which marked where it fitted into the rock, and then we
extinguished our lanterns and passed out of the valley on to the
pampa.</p>

<p>The place where we had come out was about a thousand paces from the
walls of the Sacsahuaman. We halted on the plain and I gave my last
orders to the Ayllos. Then we set out in the direction of the Fortress,
and as we went one by one my followers disappeared silently into the
half darkness about us till at last only four of them were left, two
leading Djama and two the professor.</p>

<p>I had been talking of many things with Francis Hartness on the way,
and showing him how in the olden times we had made use of the secret
passages such as those he had already seen, and when we saw that we had
come out by a way different to that which we had entered, he asked me
the reason of it, and I answered him in a low voice and said,--</p>

<p>'Because the other way is closed. Have patience a little while and
you shall see why.'</p>

<p>Then we went on our way in silence until we came to the edge of the
valley in which the Sayacusca stands. Here I halted and whispered a few
words to the men who were leading Djama and the professor. They slipped
off their ponchos and threw them over the heads of their prisoners, for
such the two were now to be for the present. I heard a muffled cry from
Djama, and I went to him and put my hand on his shoulder and said in a
whisper,--</p>

<p>'Keep quiet and lie down. These men have knives and will use them at
my bidding.'</p>

<p>Then they pulled him and the professor down, and they lay quiet,
knowing that their lives were in my hands, and I lay down on the edge
of the valley, signing to Francis Hartness to come and lie beside me.
Then I pointed into the valley and bade him watch. Presently, in the
dim light, we made out figures moving about the rock, and caught every
now and then the glint of the star-rays along thin lines of polished
metal.</p>

<p>'Rifle barrels!' he whispered. 'What are they doing here? I didn't
know that your men had any weapons yet.'</p>

<p>'No,' I said, 'those, are in the hands of soldiers from Cuzco. The
time has come sooner than I thought for, and yet not too soon. You will
see the first blow struck for the freedom of my people before
to-morrow's sun rises.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX - THE TREACHERY OF DJAMA</h2>

<p>'Wait now for a little while with patience,' I said, laying my hand
on his shoulder, 'and you shall see a strange thing, a thing that shall
show you how strong the old traditions are still in the land of the
Incas. Lie here and do not let yourself be seen till I send a messenger
for you. It will not be very long.'</p>

<p>He nodded and I rose quietly to my feet and went round the hollow
until I got the great stone between me and the place where the soldiers
were standing, and then I went down on my hands and knees and crept
quietly towards it and climbed up a flight of steps carved in it. This
took me to the top of the cleft in which is the broken stairway. I
climbed down this and dropped softly into the hole at the bottom. It
was dry now, for Tupac had done that which I had bidden him in the
throne-room. I felt my way down the steps till I came to the wall at
the bottom. Then I whispered his name, and he answered out of the
darkness in the old language,--</p>

<p>'I am here, Lord, and all that has been ordered is done.'</p>

<p>I crept towards him along the wall, measuring my way along it with
my outstretched arms till I knew that I had come to the revolving stone
which closed the way into the hall. He was standing against it, and one
of the others was with him. I felt over the door till I found the
silver socket, and then we opened the door as before with the bar which
Tupac had brought. Then I went down through the hall and lighted a
lantern and went into the little chamber where, as before, I changed my
clothing for the imperial robes, and set the Llautu on my head; but I
kept on my belt under my cloak, and put two revolvers in it in case I
should need them, and when I went back into the hall Tupac and the
others were lighting candles and putting them in the holders round the
walls as I had bidden them. When this was done I said to him,--</p>

<p>'Go now and bring the others down, first the soldiers with their
officer, by whose side you must keep closely, and see that your knife
is ready. Then let Ainu bring the Men of the Blood, and the strangers
quickly after them, and bid Anahauc and Ainu close the door when the
last man has entered.'</p>

<p>He bowed his head, and the two went out and left me sitting there on
a seat built up of blocks of gold before the pyramid, waiting to play
my part in the scene that was to follow, and strike the first blow in
the battle that I had come to fight. Presently I heard the rattle of
arms and the sound of footsteps coming along the passage. I took one of
the revolvers out of my belt and held it ready under my cloak, and sat
still and rigid as the effigy of Yupanqui, looking straight before me
at the entrance at the other end.</p>

<p>Tupac came in first, and close behind him was a Spanish officer with
a drawn sword in his hand. After him came the soldiers, two and two,
with their rifles and bayonets. The officer stopped and stared about
him, blinking with eyes half dazzled by the sudden light and the
glitter of the gold and jewels which he saw wherever he looked. The
same instant I saw the gleam of steel in Tupac's hand close to his
yellow throat. Then he said to him in Spanish,--</p>

<p>'Put up your sword, senor, and come with me and beg your life from
the Son of the Sun who sits yonder on his throne.'</p>

<p>The Spaniard uttered a loud cry of amazement as his eyes fell upon
me, for so far he had not seen me, having been too much taken up by the
splendours of the hall. Then he turned and called to his soldiers, but
while the cry was still in his throat, Tupac's arm went round his neck
and the knife-point touched his skin. Then he bade two of the soldiers
take the sword out of his hand and hold him fast, which they did,
greatly to his wonder, for he did not know that the betrayer was
already betrayed. As soon as he was safe, Tupac told the other soldiers
to take their places along the walls, and they did so in silence, yet
wondering greatly at all they saw. There were four-and-twenty of them,
not counting the two who held the officer, all men of Indian blood whom
the Spaniards* had made rather slaves than soldiers to fight their
petty quarrels for them for little pay and scanty food.</p>

<p>*The Inca naturally does not distinguish between the modern
Peruvians and their Spanish ancestors.</p>

<p>After them came Anahuac and Ainu and the rest of the Men of the
Blood, bringing with them Djama and the professor blindfolded, and
Francis Hartness with his eyes unbound. All this time I had neither
moved nor made a sound, and the soldiers were looking at me almost in
terror, wondering whether I was truly a man or one of the dead Incas
with living eyes in his head. As for the Spanish officer, being a
coward, as many of his sort are, he was already white with fear, and
his knees were shaking as he stood between the two soldiers who held
him. When all had entered, Anahauc came and prostrated himself before
me and said,--</p>

<p>'The commands of the Son of the Sun are obeyed. All are here, and
the door is shut.'</p>

<p>Before I answered him, I called Francis Hartness to me and
said,--</p>

<p>'Come here and stand by me, my friend, for I shall need your
counsel.'</p>

<p>He came and stood by me on my right hand, saying as he looked still
wonderingly at me,--</p>

<p>'This means treachery, I suppose, and after that, tragedy. Is that
why you left Ruth and Golden Star in the Fortress? I am afraid you had
only too much reason to, but I hope, for Ruth's sake, you will do
justice with as much mercy as you can.'</p>

<p>'You shall see,' I answered. But if it were not for her you would
see justice without mercy.'</p>

<p>Then I bade Anahuac rise, and told him and Tupac to unbind the eyes
of Djama and the professor and bring them before me.</p>

<p>As Djama's eyes opened to the light, he stared about him in silence
for a moment. His face was very pale, and his lips were twitching and
trembling. The professor, too, looked about him, also wondering greatly
at what he saw; but neither of them spoke till they had been led
forward and stood before me. Then, while Djama still kept silence, the
professor, looking from me to Hartness, said in a voice that had much
wonder, but no fear or sign of guilt, in it,--</p>

<p>'What is this? What does all this mean? What are all these soldiers
here for, Vilcaroya? I thought it was so important that all this should
be kept secret? Surely no one has betrayed you already? But no, that
can't be. Hartness, what does it all mean?'</p>

<p>'It means--first,' I said, speaking very slowly, and not in a loud
voice, 'that you have been brought here with Laurens Djama to take the
oath which you agreed to take--never to reveal the secrets of the
things that you have learned. I ask your pardon for the rude way in
which my people have brought you, but it was necessary.'</p>

<p>Then I turned to Djama, who was standing silent and motionless, with
clenched teeth and set face, like one who knows that he stands near his
doom and has no hope of mercy, and said,--</p>

<p>'Now, Laurens Djama, are you ready to do as you promised to do when
I told you that I would give you the half of this gold for what you
have done for me and Golden Star? Are you ready to swear the oath here,
in the presence of these witnesses, that you swore to me then?'</p>

<p>He drew himself up and looked at me boldly--for he was a brave man
although his heart was black--and said to me with a hard, harsh laugh
in his voice,--</p>

<p>'You have been too clever for me, and so I suppose you have the
right to mock me. There is no need to go on with this farce. The sight
of your treasures gave me the gold-fever, I suppose, and it drove me
mad, as it has driven many others mad, and I betrayed you. There is no
use saying any more. I see that I have been betrayed too, and that my
life is in your hands, so I need only say that I keep the right of
taking it myself in my own way.'</p>

<p>'There is no need for that yet,' I said, 'and others are concerned
in this besides you.'</p>

<p>Then I turned from him to Francis Hartness and said,--</p>

<p>I cannot speak the Spanish speech, and I would not if I could. Do
you therefore speak to the Spaniard yonder, and bid him say how he came
to be here with his soldiers. Tell him, too, that if he lies, or
refuses to speak, he shall be buried in the gold he came to steal until
the weight of it crushes his life out. But say to him that if he speaks
the truth and holds nothing back and does as I shall bid him, he shall
have his life, and afterwards as much gold as three men can carry.'</p>

<p>So then Francis Hartness turned to the trembling Spaniard and
questioned him, and he confessed freely as soon as he knew he was not
to be killed, and told how Djama had gone to the Governor of Cuzco and
told him of my coming and of a great treasure that he would show him,
and of others that I knew the secret of and might be made to reveal,
and how he had bargained that half of all that was found should be his
and the other half the Governor's, if he would help him to carry it to
the coast in safety and put it on a steamer. The Spaniard told also how
the Governor, who was his own father, had only half believed this
story, and had bidden him bring a company of soldiers to the appointed
place and see if there was any truth in Djama's story, and, if he found
there was, to take Djama and all of us prisoners and carry us back to
Cuzco, and put us into the prison until he could question us the next
day.</p>

<p>When he had finished, Djama laughed again and said,--</p>

<p>'There's the honour of a Peruvian! Serve me right for being such a
fool as to trust to it!'</p>

<p>But I bade him sternly to hold his peace till he should be told to
speak, and then, when Francis Hartness had told me in English what the
Spaniard had said, I bade Tupac and Anahuac stand forward and tell of
their share in what had been done, so that all might understand. They
told their story in Quichua, and when I translated it into English to
Francis Hartness I made few words of it, of which the meaning was
this,--</p>

<p>Ever since Tupac and his comrades had recognised me as their lord,
and sworn their faith to me, they, and others whom they trusted, had
industriously spread abroad the news of my coming--though telling
nothing that would make a traitor able to betray us--and, in proof of
their story, little wedges of gold, stamped with the ancient symbol of
the Sun, had been passed from hand to hand as earnest of my promise
that I would use the hidden treasures of the Incas for the benefit of
my people, and make money of gold where now there was only silver and
copper.</p>

<p>By this time, not only had the golden wedges gone far and wide
through the land, but nearly all the soldiers of the pure Indian blood
had been won over to my cause, for, as I have said, and as everyone in
the country knows, these soldiers are treated with great hardness by
their Spanish masters, who often pay them nothing for many weeks or
months together, and give them scanty food and hard usage, and cast
them into prison or flog them and shoot them if they think to do
anything to get justice. Moreover, there are always factions of men
they call politicians scheming for power and setting the soldiers
fighting against one another and against their countrymen for no
benefit to themselves. So what Francis Hartness had told me on the
night that Golden Star had come back to life had already begun to come
true. More than half the garrison of Cuzco had already been won over,
and only waited for the signal which should bid the whole Indian
population of the valley to rise and seize the arms and ammunition in
the city, and make the officers and the Governor and all the officials
prisoners.</p>

<p>Anahuac's daughter was a servant in the Governor's house, and this
girl understood Spanish, though she pretended only to know Quichua and
the dialect of the people, and she had been set to watch,* and Tupac's
eldest son had also been secretly watching all the comings and goings
of Djama since we came to Cuzco. In this way his visit to the Governor
had been made known to me, and then one of the soldiers in the company
that had been ordered to go with the Governor's son to the Rodadero had
told Tupac of the order, and I had arranged with him how the surprise
was to be carried out, and this, as you have seen, had been done with
complete success.</p>

<p>*This is quite a common thing in Peru, and the Indian women make
exceedingly clever spies.</p>

<p>When I had finished telling this to Hartness I turned to the
professor and said to him kindly,--</p>

<p>'There has been nothing said that brings any share of the guilt of
this treason to you, so now, if you will promise me on your faith and
honour as an Englishman to keep my secrets and obey such commands as I
shall put upon you for your own safety and that of all of us, you shall
go free, and you shall have the choice of going back to England or to
any other country until the war is over, or of staying here under my
protection until you can go away safely with the treasure which shall
be yours. But if you go now you cannot take it with you, for in a few
days from now there will be war throughout the whole land, and it would
be impossible to take so much treasure to the coast. Now, what do you
say?'</p>

<p>He thought for a moment and then said,--</p>

<p>I am not a man of war, as you know Vilcaroya, but I hope I am a man
of honour. I have never breathed a syllable that could have given
anyone an inkling of your secret, and I promise you solemnly that I
never will. What Djama has done distresses me even more than it amazes
me. I would have staked my life on his honesty, and if you will release
him and let him come with me-'</p>

<p>'No, no, my friend!' I said, quickly and sternly. 'What you would
ask is impossible. His aims were deeper and his sin was blacker than it
has been shown to be here. He did not betray us for gold alone, for he
knew that I would keep my promise and give him more than he could want.
He would have given me to my enemies to be killed--it might have been
by tortures, to make me say where my treasures were hidden--so that he
might have had Golden Star at his mercy.'</p>

<p>'It was your own fault, curse you! Why did you not give her to me?'
Djama cried suddenly, breaking loose from the two who held his arms and
putting his hand to his pistol pocket. The next instant my own revolver
was out from under my cloak and levelled at his heart.</p>

<p>'Another motion and I will kill you,' I said, 'though so quick a
death would be too good for you. Tie his hands behind his back and hold
him faster this time. Give me his pistol.'</p>

<p>Before I had done speaking they had seized him again in spite of his
struggles, and paying no heed to his cries and imprecations--for by
this time his long-pent-up passion had broken loose and made him almost
mad, and when they had given me his pistol I said to him,--</p>

<p>'I told you that Golden Star should be yours if you could win her as
an honest man. But you sought to steal her as you would have stolen my
gold. That is enough; keep silence now, or you shall be gagged.'</p>

<p>Then I held out my hand to the professor and said,--</p>

<p>I will accept your promise, for you are an honest man. There is my
hand. Now we will be friends as before, and I will answer for your
safety. Will you go or stay with us?'</p>

<p>'I will stay,' he said, 'for my studies are not completed yet, and
besides, I am anxious to see what the Inca empire will be like when it
is restored.'</p>

<p>'I am glad that you say so,' I replied, 'for you are welcome, and
you shall make your home here always if you will.'</p>

<p>Then I bade them stand the Spanish officer in the professor's place
beside Djama, and, turning to Francis Hartness, said,--</p>

<p>'These men are worthy of death, for they would have delivered us to
death, but I cannot kill Djama since Joyful Star might hate me for it,
and if I do not kill him it would not be justice to kill the Spaniard.
What shall I do?'</p>

<p>'I see nothing for it,' he said, after thinking awhile, 'but
shutting them up safely until we have got this business over, and then
sending them out of the country and forbidding them to come back under
pain of death. There are plenty of places that they would be perfectly
safe in.'</p>

<p>'That is well thought of, my friend,' I said, and it shall be done.
They came for gold and they shall have it. They shall live in it, and
see gold, and nothing but gold, till the sight of it is hateful to
them. They shall have a prison of gold, and eat and drink from gold,
and sleep and walk and sit on gold. Yes, truly, they shall have enough
of gold before they see the light of day again. Now tell the Spaniard
what I have said.'</p>

<p>He did so, and at first the wretch's eyes glittered and then grew
dim when the true meaning of his doom came upon him, for it meant he
knew not how long an imprisonment with a man who had betrayed his
friends, and whom, as he had confessed, he would himself have betrayed;
and he thought, too, that I had only promised him his life and the gold
to make him speak, and that now I would keep him prisoner and perhaps
kill him in the end. So he fell on his knees, like the craven that he
was, and begged for mercy, and told Hartness of my promise, and with
Hartness's lips I told him only that he must have patience and wait
until it was my pleasure to do what I had said.</p>

<p>After this I called Tupac and Anahuac and told them what I wished
done, and they took a score of their men and forthwith began to build,
in a corner of the hall beside the throne, a chamber measuring some ten
feet each way, of the oblong blocks of gold which were piled up in the
pyramid, and while they were doing this I called the soldiers before me
and told them, speaking in their own dialect, that if they were
faithful to me until the end of the war, each man should have one ounce
weight of gold paid to him every month, and one ounce more for each of
his comrades that he could persuade to join us, and for this night's
work I would give them each a wedge of gold of the weight of two
ounces, which was more money than all that they had earned in their
lives before; and when I had promised this they went on their knees and
swore faith to me and destruction to their hated Spanish masters.</p>

<p>Then I told them how Francis Hartness would lead them to battle and
to victory as he had led the soldiers of his own nation, and after that
he spoke to them in Spanish, and told them what to tell their comrades
and what was to be done with the arms and ammunition when the signal
for the rising was given.</p>

<p>All this while Djama and the Spaniard were kept standing watching
the building of their golden prison-cell. The men worked swiftly, and
the many hands made the toil light, and they built the walls up very
thick and strong, fitting the golden bricks closely into each other,
and making the walls smooth and without hand or foot-hold, so that
neither could any of the bricks be got out, nor the walls be climbed.
The cell was divided into two by another wall, and when the walls were
finished they were about ten feet high, and there was an opening into
each cell in front, large enough for a man to crawl in on his hands and
knees.</p>

<p>When all was ready I said to Djama,--</p>

<p>'There is your house of gold. Go and dwell in it till it shall be
safe for me to release you. Every day, as I have said, you shall eat
and drink from plates and cups of gold, and you shall dream of gold
until this gold-fever of yours is cured.'</p>

<p>'Until I have gone gold-mad, you mean!' he cried, snarling at me
like an angry dog. 'It is just such a vengeance as a half-civilised
savage would have thought of. You know as well as I do that I shall go
mad in there unless I kill myself first.'</p>

<p>'You have your choice!' I said. 'I will make your punishment no
lighter. If you think to pull the walls down they will fall on you and
crush you, and you will be buried in gold, and if I am told that you
have tried to break out, I will put chains of gold on you, so heavy
that you shall not be able to drag them across your cell; but if you
are peaceful and patient, all your wants shall be attended to by those
that I shall appoint, and you shall have everything but liberty and the
light of day. Now, go in.'</p>

<p>'I won't!' he cried with a curse that ended in a scream. 'I shall go
mad in there, I tell you, and that is a thousand times worse than death
to me. I won't! Damn you, I won't!'</p>

<p>'Then you shall be thrust in,' I said.</p>

<p>They thrust him in with his arms still bound.</p>

<p>I made a sign to those who held him, and they, seeing what I meant,
took him by the body and the legs, and carried him, feet foremost,
kicking and struggling, towards the hole. Then they thrust him in with
his arms still bound. But when he was half-way through, I bade one of
them loose the cords a little, so that he could free himself
afterwards. The Spaniard made no resistance, and when he was bidden
crept, trembling like a hound that has been flogged, into his cell, and
when they were both in I ordered the openings to be built up.</p>

<p>Francis Hartness and the professor had gone away to the other end of
the hall, not liking to see this, and yet knowing that it would be
useless to seek to persuade me to more mercy.</p>

<p>'Our work here is done now,' I said, going to them, 'and it would be
well for us to go back to the fortress and sleep, for the morning is
near and there will be much work to do before long.'</p>

<p>'I don't think I shall sleep much after what I have seen to-night,'
said Hartness, 'and if I did sleep I think I should dream of that
golden prison and those two poor wretches hungering and thirsting for
daylight and liberty, with the means of buying any luxury the world
could give them within reach of their hands.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the professor, 'it is a curious situation, isn't
it?--quite apart from the personal interest it has for us. Now, in
England or America, a room built with walls and floor of solid gold
would be a luxury that only a millionaire could afford, and he would
probably be thought a fool for building it, and yet here it is only a
prison in which a man might well starve to death. Come, let us get away
from here. I really don't want to hear any more of Djama's ravings than
I can help. Good heavens! who ever would have thought that a man of his
culture and learning and strength of mind could possibly have made such
a blackguard of himself!'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Hartness, with a dry sort of laugh, 'you see he was the
victim of the two passions that have done most to drive men mad or make
scoundrels of them since the world began--the love of woman and the
lust for gold. I don't pretend to understand it myself, because he had
gold enough promised to him, and there is no telling but that he might
have won the woman; but there, you never can tell how far any man is
mad or sane until he's tried.'</p>

<p>'But there was something else, my friend,' I said. 'There was, as
you say, lust of gold and love of woman; but there was also hate. Why,
I know not; but though I owe my new life to that man, I have hated him
and he has hated me since we learnt to know each other as living men.
You know, too, how, as I told you, Golden Star shrank from him as
though he had been a poisonous reptile, and yet why should I hate him
and yet love her who is of the same flesh and blood as he is?'</p>

<p>'I would rather discuss the problem in the open air or at the
hacienda than here,' said the professor, 'and even then I don't suppose
we should get much nearer to a solution, for these things are mysteries
and mostly past finding out. Yet it may be that you and he, the sons of
different centuries, may actually have embodied in you the differences
and the antipathies of the two ages and the two races to which you
belong. There is no telling. But come, let us get out of here, please.
I really can't stand this any longer.'</p>

<p>'Nor I,' said Hartness. 'For goodness' sake let us go! This is a
good deal more trying to the nerves than a cavalry charge or a smart
skirmish.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' I said, 'we will go.'</p>

<p>Then I called to Tupac and bade him tell the soldiers and the rest
that the night's work was over and it was time to go. We gave each of
the soldiers his wedge of gold, as I had promised them; and once more I
made them swear that each would kill any of the others who thought to
betray us. Then Tupac and Anahuac went and opened the stone door, and
we returned from the Hall of Gold to the upper earth, leaving Djama and
his fellow traitor still raving and crying within the walls of their
golden prison.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X - ON THE RODADERO</h2>

<p>Francis Hartness and I came last out of the passage, and I asked him
to lead the soldiers out of the hollow and across the plain to the wall
of the Sacsahuaman, where I would join them, and as soon as they had
gone out of the hollow and were lost to sight I went to the hole among
the bushes where the hidden stone was and released the chain and let
the water flow back into its old place, till the entrance to the Hall
of Gold was only the same dark, stagnant pool that any wanderer might
find at the bottom of the cloven stairway.</p>

<p>Then I strewed the earth over the hole, and piled the stones and
brushwood round and over it as before, and went away to join the
others. I found them standing in a group in one of the angles of the
great fortress, and there I spoke to the soldiers again, and told them
how much depended, both for themselves and for the country, on their
fidelity, promising them peace and prosperity and freedom if they were
faithful, and a speedy death if they betrayed me.</p>

<p>After this I told them what story they should tell when they went
back to the city--how their Indian guide had led them into the entrance
to a cavern in the mountain, their officer going first and he
following, and how, when these two were going on with a single light,
some two or three yards ahead of them a great slab of stone had
suddenly fallen down between them, closing the passage, and how water
had risen up and filled the passage at its lower end, forcing them to
run back out of it for fear of being drowned; and I further gave them
permission to bring any who disbelieved them to the mouth of the cleft
under the Sayacusca and show them the water that they would find at the
bottom of it, but to take good care to send me warning of anyone going
there.</p>

<p>This they promised to do, and still full of wonder, and yet pleased
with the gold they had got and the promises I had made to them, they
made a loyal farewell, and marched down through the Gate of Sand, and
went back to the city to tell their story and do the work that I had
bidden them do.</p>

<p>When they had gone I sent some of my men to see that none of them
turned back, and dismissed the rest to their homes, saving only Tupac,
Anahuac, and Ainu and three others who could be trusted in all things;
and with these we went back into the underground chambers of the
fortress by the way that we had left them.</p>

<p>When we got back to the throne-room I sent all but Tupac away to
remove the beasts from the stables and take them to the hacienda, so
that the next night, under cover of the darkness, they could return and
bring us food and drink and clothing and other things that we needed,
for now that matters had gone so far it would not be safe for us to
live at the hacienda or be seen in any place known to the Spaniards
until the time was ripe for the striking of the first blow.</p>

<p>When they were gone we ate and drank a little of what we had brought
with us in the morning, and then lay down, either to sleep or to think
of the strange things that had happened and of what was now quickly
coming to pass.</p>

<p>As for me, no sleep came to my eyes, for I knew that when Joyful
Star awoke I should have to tell her at least something of what her
brother had done and of what had happened to him, and a grievous task
it was, you may be sure, when I came to the doing of it, as I did not
many hours afterwards.</p>

<p>The first thing she asked me when she found that Djama was not with
us was what had become of him, and then, knowing that sooner or later
the bitter truth had to be told, I told her as gently as I was able,
and hiding from her all that I could without lying to her. My words
struck her dumb with horror and amazement, and if it had not been that
Francis Hartness and the professor were there, and told her that they
had seen and heard with their own eyes and ears the truth of all that I
said, I do not think she would have believed me. But when at last she
could no longer doubt the story of her brother's crime and treachery,
she came to me and laid her hand upon my arm, and looked up at me with
tearful eyes and said,--</p>

<p>'But you will not kill him, Vilcaroya, for my sake, will you? He is
my brother, you know, after all, though he has made me almost ashamed
to say so. You must protect yourself, of course, and your people from
treachery, but you will not kill him, will you?'</p>

<p>'He is alive now,' I said, 'because he is Joyful Star's brother, not
because I think he is worthy to live, for he would have betrayed one
life that he gave back, and stained the other with infamy. But I have
given my word, and he shall live, and when he can do no more harm I
will pardon him, and he shall go back to his own country in safety.
More than that I cannot promise even to you.'</p>

<p>'It is all that I can ask for,' she said, 'and more than he could
expect after what he has done. But, oh! why should he have brought such
a shame as this upon us?'</p>

<p>'Upon himself only,' I said. 'It would not be possible for such a
thing as shame to touch you.'</p>

<p>She looked up at me again and smiled through her tears, as if my
words had pleased her well, and that smile of hers was more to me than
even her tears. Then she went back to the little chamber where she had
slept, and presently returned leading Golden Star by the hand, and then
we all sat down in the silver seats and talked of the wonderful things
that had happened, and I told Golden Star all the story of my own
return to life, and hers, and what I knew of the changes that had
happened in the world since she and I had said our last words to each
other in the Sanctuary of the Sun; and then I set her talking with the
others, translating for her and for them as well as I could, and she,
knowing nothing of what had happened in the night, and being glad that
Evil Eyes, as she called Djama in our own speech, had gone away for a
long time, was as happy as a child amongst us, and soon even Ruth
became more cheerful and began to try and make her say words of English
and repeat her name and the professor's and Francis Hartness's after
her, for she already loved her dearly, and, even in the midst of her
own sorrow, she was rejoiced that the soul which had slept had been so
happily re-awakened in her.</p>

<p>After this, Francis Hartness and I began to talk our plans over
again, and to discuss the chances of the revolt in Cuzco, and I showed
him how, with the help of my people, I would the next day cut off all
communication between the valley and the rest of the country until our
work was finished there, for I was determined that the first part of
the empire of my fathers' that I would re-take should be the City of
the Sun itself and the region that it commanded, since I knew that my
people still looked upon it as the most sacred spot on earth, and would
fight better to take it than any other place. And in this plan Francis
Hartness, looking at the matter as a soldier, also agreed with me.</p>

<p>We thought it best that none of us should show ourselves in the open
that day, for we knew not what the effect of the soldiers' story and
their return without their officer might be in Cuzco, for if it had
become widely known, it would certainly bring many people up to the
Rodadero to behold the scene of so strange an occurrence. So we spent
the day in conversation, and, which was more interesting to my
companions, in exploring the maze of chambers and passages and winding
galleries which the labour of many thousands of men had wrought out of
the solid rock in the days of my ancestors, for you must know that in
those days the fortress of the Sacsahuaman was crowned with a great
palace, which was the strongest place in all the Land of the Four
Regions, and so here were stored very great treasures, not only of gold
and silver and precious stones, but also weapons and armour and most
finely-woven cloths of the purest wool of the Vicufla, which is softer
than silk, brilliantly dyed and embroidered with gems and threads of
gold, and the imperial robes that had been worn by twenty generations
of Incas, many sets of each, since nothing that had belonged to one
Inca might ever be used by another after his death.</p>

<p>Among these were found many sets of the royal robes of the Coyas or
queen-wives of the Incas, and I took Golden Star aside and told her to
take two of these and to clothe herself in one and Joyful Star in the
other, so that we might see our two Inca princesses side by side as
they might have looked in the days of the past, and she fell in with my
humour, laughing and clapping her hands like a delighted child.</p>

<p>So she took the robes and led Joyful Star away with her to their own
chamber, talking to her in her soft, musical speech, though she knew
she could not understand her, and yet making so many pretty signs and
eloquent gestures that Ruth, forgetting her sorrow for the time,
comprehended her, and entered into the spirit of the play, and soon
they came back to us into the throneroom, clad exactly alike, and so
perfectly resembling each other, save for the contrast of the blue eyes
and the brown, and the bright hair and the dark, that they could have
been taken for nothing save twin daughters of the Sun and the fairest
of his children; and Tupac and the two men that I had kept in the
fortress to attend to our wants fell on their knees before them as they
passed, as though they would have worshipped them.</p>

<p>It was at this time, and while we were passing the hours in this
fashion, that Golden Star did something that gave me great joy and a
bright hope for the future. I had been telling her of the wonderful
country that I had returned to life in, and of the marvellous things
that I had seen there, and this, she knew already, was the country of
Francis Hartness. So, as he came from such a wonderful land, she
thought, in the innocence of her old-world simplicity, that he was one
of a new race of beings that came on to the earth since our days, and
when I told her he was but human like ourselves, though very strong and
learned and skilled in many things that we knew nothing of, she said to
me, just as a sister might say to a brother from whom she had no
secrets,--</p>

<p>'He is rather, in my eyes, like a son of our Father who has come to
earth from the Mansions of the Sun; yet I am very glad that he is not,
and that he is a man such as you are, my brother, and when Joyful Star
has taught me the speech of her people I will talk with him, and then I
think life will be better for me, for even now, though I cannot
understand his words, his voice sounds like music to me, and when he
looks at me he makes me try to remember something that was in my other
life, and I have forgotten. What is it, I wonder?'</p>

<p>I looked down into her eyes and saw the untroubled serenity of her
soul reflected in them. There was no flush on her cheeks, and her lips
were smiling as they could not have smiled had she known how I could
have answered that question for her. I stooped and kissed her brow and
said,--</p>

<p>'I might guess what it is, Golden Star, but I could not tell you.
Yet I pray that our Father the Sun may put it into the heart of my
friend to teach you what I see now you can only learn from him.'</p>

<p>More than this I would not tell her, though she questioned me
sharply. But the next time that Francis Hartness spoke to her through
my lips she looked up at him, and a little flush came to her cheeks,
and a smile to her lips, and I saw his eyes brighten, and the colour
deepen ever so little under the bronze of his skin.</p>

<p>Then I looked at Joyful Star and saw something shining in her eyes
too, and as she caught my glance she smiled ever so little and said,
when I had finished speaking for him,--</p>

<p>'Vilcaroya is an excellent interpreter, I've no doubt; but don't you
think, Captain Hartness, it would be very much more interesting if you
could talk directly with Her Highness? You know I'm teaching Golden
Star English, and Vilcaroya is teaching you Quichua--now, I wonder
which of you will be able to talk to the other first?'</p>

<p>He pulled his moustache and laughed, looking at Golden Star the
while, and said,--</p>

<p>'Well, Her Highness has the advantage of the easier language and the
freshest, and I daresay the brightest intellect, but probably for all
that we shall begin with some delightful jargon of both languages, and
leave them to sort themselves out as we go on. Still, as you say, it
will be more interesting than talking through an interpreter.'</p>

<p>'And I hope,' she said, with more meaning in her voice than in her
words, 'that you will both of you find it as pleasant as it will be
interesting.'</p>

<p>'Who knows!' he said, catching her meaning and laughing again. 'She
is most wonderfully like you, Miss Ruth, isn't she?'</p>

<p>'Yes, but--but I am not without hope that you may some day compare
us a little, just a little, to my disadvantage.'</p>

<p>What Francis Hartness would have said to this I cannot say, though I
do not think he was displeased by Joyful Star's words, and yet his face
grew very serious as she spoke. But just then Tupac came and told me
that Anahuac and Ainu had returned with the beasts, and were now
waiting outside the bronze doors. From this we learnt that it was
already night, though, truth to tell, the time had passed so quickly
for us that I for one thought that it was little more than late
afternoon.</p>

<p>Now, as I have said, I was the only one who knew the secret of the
bronze doors, and so I went back with Tupac and opened them, and, when
the men had entered, closed them again.</p>

<p>There were twelve of them beside Ainu and Anahuac, and all were
laden with food and drink and clothing, and our arms and ammunition,
two repeating rifles and two revolvers for each of us. When the men had
laid their burdens down, I called Anahuac to me, and asked him if he
had any news. He bowed himself before me, and then, standing in front
of me as I sat in one of the seats, he said,--</p>

<p>'Yes, Lord. If the ears of the Son of the Sun are open, his servant
will fill them with tidings of some moment.'</p>

<p>'Say on,' I said, 'and meanwhile let a meal be prepared for us, for
we are hungry.'</p>

<p>This I said to Tupac, and Golden Star, hearing it, smiled, and took
Ruth's hand and led her to the boxes, making signs that they should
perform the housewife's duties together. Then Anahuac began, and
said,--</p>

<p>'The ears of the Children of the Blood have not been closed, nor
have their eyes slept throughout the Holy City and the Valley of the
Sun, and they have seen and heard much, and the courage of their hearts
has risen high, and they are longing for the word of their Lord to
break the yoke that is upon their necks.</p>

<p>'When the soldiers returned last night and told the story that my
Lord had put into their mouths, there was great wonder among all the
other soldiers, and many saw in it a sign that the Son of the Sun is
mighty, and can do that which he promises. But among the masters who
are set over the soldiers there was great anger, and they sought, but
without avail, to keep the news from being made public in the city; but
the Men of the Blood took care that this should not be so, and to-day
all Cuzco has been talking of the strange fate of the Coronel Prada,
the son of Don Antonio Prada, the governor. But Don Antonio himself had
gone the day before to a hacienda near Oropesa, and messengers have
been sent to him to tell him the story, and this evening he rode back
with all haste to the city.</p>

<p>'He has ordered that to-night sentries shall be posted at all the
approaches to the Rodadero and round the Sayacusca, so that none may
come or go without his knowledge, and tomorrow he will come himself
with many officers and two hundred soldiers, and the thing they call
dynamite, that he may rend the Sayacusca in pieces, and find, as he
thinks, the place where his son has been hidden.'</p>

<p>'And the soldiers-what of them?' I asked. 'Will they be for us or
against us?'</p>

<p>'There will be many in the service of my Lord, and if it shall be
possible there shall be more of these than of the others, for those who
were in the Hall of Gold last night have been busy in the hope of my
Lord's further bounty, and many have been tempted with the promise of
gold and freedom; but still there will be many that may not be trusted,
and all the officers of the Governor will be Spaniards.'</p>

<p>'And therefore enemies,' I said, when he had finished his story, and
stood waiting for me to speak.</p>

<p>I told Francis Hartness at once what Anahuac had said, and we
debated for a short time on what we should do. Then I called Tupac, and
he came and stood beside Anahuac, and I said to them,--</p>

<p>'These things have happened well for us, and now we must act
quickly, so that we may take the best advantage of them. When you go
hence, take with you twenty strips of the scarlet fringe in token of my
authority, and give these to twenty of the best of the Men of the
Blood, and let them go with all speed and silence through the towns and
villages of the valley, and say that the Son of the Sun has come, and
is about to stretch forth his hand and take that which was his again.
Further, let every entrance to the valley be closed. Let the bridge
over the Great Speaker be cut with all speed that may be. Let none pass
in or out of the gateway of Piquillacta, and let all the mountain paths
be broken down or blocked, so that none may know what is happening in
the valley, nor any news be carried hence into the country.</p>

<p>'Let every hacienda, whose master is a Spaniard, be given to the
flames, but let no one else be injured. Let none of the strangers be
hurt, and let their goods be sacred. Let all of the sentries who will
not serve us be disarmed or slain silently by the others, and this
before midnight, and let those who are for us--who shall come with the
Governor to-morrow--make ready to do quickly that which shall be
commanded them. The password for those who are with us will be
"Vilcaroya." The rest I will do with my own hands and the help of my
friend. I have spoken--let me be obeyed quickly!'</p>

<p>Then they bent low before me and went to make ready to do what I had
bidden them.</p>

<p>It was then about eight o'clock at night, and after we had had our
evening meal we waited until it was nearly eleven, making perfect our
plans, and then, when Ruth and Golden Star had gone to rest without
knowing of the work which we had in hand--for we had kept it from them
lest they should be anxious for us--Francis Hartness and I armed
ourselves, after I had disguised him as well as I could to make him
look like an Indian, and we said good-night to the professor and left
the fortress by the same way that we had left it the night before.</p>

<p>As soon as we got out into the open air we made our way stealthily
back towards the Rodadero, until I caught sight of a sentry standing
near one of the carved stones.</p>

<p>'I will go and see whether this is a friend or a foe,' I whispered.
'Wait here and cover him with your rifle, but do not fire unless you
hear me whistle.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' he said; 'but take care of yourself, for those
Mannlicher bullets make a very ugly wound.'</p>

<p>I waved my hand to him in reply, and went away towards the sentry,
keeping a good lookout for others who might be about. I had in my belt
a long, heavy-bladed knife, and this I loosened in the sheath as I came
near to him. I got within earshot of him unseen, and then, rising to my
feet behind him, I said in a low voice, but loud enough for him to
hear,--</p>

<p>'Vilcaroya-friend or foe?'</p>

<p>'Halta! quien va?'</p>

<p>The words in the hated Spanish speech told me that he was a foe. As
he faced about, bringing his rifle to the ready, I drew my knife and,
before he could take aim, sent it whistling through the air with such
force and so true an aim that it took him in the windpipe and half
buried its blade in his neck. That was one of the tricks of our old
warfare which, with many others, I had taken good care not to
forget.</p>

<p>He dropped his rifle and clasped his hands to his throat and fell
without a sound. I crept swiftly forward, pulled the knife out of his
throat and drove it into his heart. Then I quickly took off his
cartridge-belt and long coat and cap, and put them on. After that I
took his rifle and stood in his place for a little while, so that the
others might see me, and then walked back to where I had left Hartness.
When he saw me coming, his rifle-barrel moved till it covered me, and
he said in English,--</p>

<p>'Is that you, Vilcaroya?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said. 'The sentry was an enemy, and I have killed him. Now
I am going to take you prisoner, as though I were the sentry, and so we
can go together and find the officer who commands the sentries, and
take him prisoner or kill him.'</p>

<p>'All right,' he said with a laugh. 'I surrender. This isn't quite
what we call civilised warfare, but I suppose it can't be helped.'</p>

<p>We went back together to the place where the sentry that I had
killed had stood, and then we saw two or three others coming in towards
the place, no doubt to see why the other sentry should have left his
post. I took Hartness's rifle out of his hand, and, catching him by the
arm, led him to meet the nearest of them, as though I had taken a
prisoner. Within ten paces of them I halted, and said,--</p>

<p>'Is it Vilcaroya or Prada?'</p>

<p>'Vilcaroya to a friend, Prada to an enemy,' he answered, in the
dialect in which I had addressed him.</p>

<p>'Then we are friends,' I said, taking off the peaked cap that had
belonged to the other sentry, and showing him the long, straight, brown
hair that betokened my race. 'I am he who has come back from the days
that are dead--Vilcaroya, the son of Huayna-Capac.'</p>

<p>'And I am thy servant, Lord,' he said, bringing his rifle-butt down
between his feet, and bending his head over the muzzle. 'I am one of
those who saw the glory of my Lord in the Hall of Gold last night.'</p>

<p>'Then thou art one of the faithful,' I said, 'for none have betrayed
the secret or earned the swift death that would have been theirs had
they done so. Now tell me, how many of those who are on guard here
to-night may be trusted?'</p>

<p>'There are twenty of us here, Lord, not counting the officer in
command.'</p>

<p>'Nay,' I said, interrupting him, 'there are but nineteen, for he who
wore this coat and carried this rifle was an enemy, and I have killed
him, as I would have killed thee hadst thou been an enemy. Now, of
these nineteen, how many may I trust?'</p>

<p>'There are but five who may not be trusted, not counting the
officer, and he is a Spaniard, and must be killed.'</p>

<p>'That is good,' I said, for the tone in which he had said these last
words had pleased me well. 'Now this man with me is my faithful friend,
and one who will fight well for me and my people. Go on the other side
of him, and we will take him as a prisoner to the officer. Then thou
shalt see how Vilcaroya deals with his enemies.'</p>

<p>He bent his head in assent, and took his place beside Hartness, and
as we marched away Hartness said to me,--</p>

<p>'I don't think I shall have much to teach you in strategy,
Vilcaroya, but I must say that I would rather have a stand-up fight
than this kind of thing.'</p>

<p>'It is not like what you have told me of the warfare of the
English,' I said, 'yet if it has to be it must be. Let us get it
over.'</p>

<p>So we marched him between us across the plain, and when we got
between the wall of the fortress and the carved stone that they called
the Inca's Seat, we saw the officer who was in command of the sentries
walking, with two soldiers beside him, from post to post, seeing that
the sentries were awake and keeping proper watch. We went to meet him,
and halted ten paces from him at his command. I had told the sentry to
reply for me, and he answered the officer's hail and said,--</p>

<p>'Vilcaroya!--a prisoner.'</p>

<p>It had smitten him to the heart.</p>

<p>As the first words left his lips the two soldiers repeated the
password and made with their rifles the movement that is called the
salute. My knife was already in my hand, and as the officer gave a
command in Spanish, it flashed once in the starlight and the next
instant was buried to the hilt in his breast. He fell, as the sentry
had done, without a cry, for it had smitten him to the heart, dead as
though he had been struck by a lightning bolt. The others stared at his
fallen body, dumb with amazement, and I heard Hartness utter a sound
that might have been one either of horror or of wonder; but I had no
time to take heed of this, so I instantly ordered the two soldiers to
take the officer's uniform off his body, and then I said to
Hartness,--</p>

<p>'Now, you can speak Spanish and I cannot. Take this Spaniard's
uniform and his weapons, and make yourself the officer of the guard,
and then you shall help me to set a trap that the Governor shall find
it a hard matter to escape from.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI - HOW WE TOOK THE CITY OF THE SUN</h2>

<p>Although Hartness was a much taller and broader man than the
Spaniard, his long, loose overcoat fitted him well enough for the
occasion, and when he had put on his shako, and wrapped his scarf about
his neck so as to hide his fair beard, he was disguised enough to pass
in the darkness for one of the enemy. We now took the two soldiers who
had been with the officer and visited all the posts. We found four of
the sentries who could not return the password and were therefore
enemies. These we disarmed and bound instead of killing them, for I
could see that what I had done had pleased my friend but little, though
he saw that in such a desperate venture as ours it was necessary to use
desperate measures.</p>

<p>When we had gone the rounds and made sure of all, we buried the two
dead men, and took our prisoners into one of the caves under the carved
stones. Then I posted my men so as to guard all the approaches from the
city to the Rodadero, and after that I went with Hartness to the hidden
hole by the Sayacusca, and showed him how the way to the Hall of Gold
was opened. I did this so that the secret might be in good and safe
hands if I should fall in battle, and so that he should be able to
properly protect the welfare of Ruth and Golden Star, and fulfil my
promises to himself and the professor.</p>

<p>When I had turned the stone and showed him the chain, I pulled it up
and supported it as I had done before, only this time I used the
carbine which had belonged to the sentry I had killed, and to the stock
of this I fastened a long rope which Tupac had hidden there by my
orders. This rope I stretched out along the ground, hiding it as well
as I could, in a straight line away from the Sayacusca. The end I led
into the entrance of one of the many passages or tunnels which ran
under the carved stones. By the time I had done this the water had all
flowed away, and Hartness said to me,--</p>

<p>'Are you going to leave the entrance to your treasure-house open
like that for His Excellency to walk into to-morrow?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said, 'but it is only half open. Unless the door below is
open too there is no way out or in save this and the channel through
which the waters flow, so that His Excellency will not find much down
there.'</p>

<p>'I see,' he said, 'a trap, and not one that I should care to see a
friend of mine walk into. But you don't mean to drown them all like
rats in a hole, do you?'</p>

<p>'I cannot tell that yet,' I said. 'If we can take them alive we may
do so, but unless they yield to us they shall yield to the water. Now,
everything is ready, and we have only to wait. Come and sleep for a
little and I will keep watch, and then I will sleep and you shall
watch. It will not be daylight for six hours yet, and we can do nothing
more till then.'</p>

<p>We went to the cavern in which I had hidden the end of the rope, and
he lay down on the soft, clean sand, and, soldier-like, was fast asleep
almost as soon as he had lain down. I left him there, and made the
round of the guards and spoke with the men, telling them as much as it
was necessary for them to know of my plans for the next day, and
allowed half of them to take two or three hours' rest, with their arms
ready at hand, while the others watched, and then I went back to
Hartness and told him to wake me in three hours, and soon was fast
asleep in his place. He came and woke me at daylight and told me that
everything was still quiet and that the sentries were all in their
places.</p>

<p>Then, when we had breakfasted on the food that we had brought with
us from the fortress, we called in all the sentries save the two by the
Gate of Sand, and hid them among the stones and bushes, all within an
easy rifle-shot of the entrance to the water-cavern. I bade the two I
had left by the gate tell the Governor that all was well, and, when he
had ridden by, to mix with the soldiers and tell those who were for me
to separate from the others as soon as they heard my signal-cry, and
then to wait for the English captain.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour we sat and watched for the coming of the enemy,
and then at last we saw a troop of horse come up out of the valley
round the end of the fortress. After them came some officers on
horseback, with the Governor riding at their head, and then another
troop of horse, in all about three hundred men. The first troop, led by
the Governor and his officers, came on towards the Sayacusca, and the
others halted and spread themselves out along the ridge that runs round
it. When they saw the empty hole and the steps leading down into the
darkness, they all crowded round, peering down into it. Then two
lanterns were lighted and some of them went down.</p>

<p>They had all dismounted from their horses and were indulging their
curiosity without suspicion. I waited till they were nearly all in my
trap, and then came the moment to close it. My long, wailing cry rang
out loud and shrill through the hollow, and was taken up by my men in
hiding, and in an instant all was confusion. I heard my name shouted
from one to the other, and saw more than half of the troopers in the
hollow leave their ranks and gallop away towards the plain. Then I took
aim at a trooper who was watching the officer's horses, and fired. The
bullet struck his horse, and it reared up and threw him, and then fell
and lay kicking on the ground. At this all the others took fright and
broke loose and galloped away in all directions. At the same instant
the rifles of my men began cracking all round, and saddle after saddle
was emptied as the bullets found their marks.</p>

<p>'I'm going to catch one of those horses,' said Hartness suddenly to
me, 'then I'll ride out and bring those other fellows up and show them
what to do. That'll be more in my line than this sort of work.
Good-bye; you will see or hear of me again before long.'</p>

<p>The next moment he was gone, and I had not fired many more shots
before I saw him, mounted on one of the officers' horses, galloping
through the hollow towards the ridge. All this time none of my men had
shown themselves, and the constant stream of shots coming from all
sides of them had thrown the Governor's troops into utter confusion.
The officers were shouting orders which no one listened to, the horses
were galloping wildly about, rearing and plunging with the pain of
their wounds, and many of the soldiers had already taken to flight,
believing, in their panic, that the hollow was full of hidden
enemies.</p>

<p>We kept up the fire from our hiding-places until we heard shouts and
cheers coming from the ridge, and I looked and saw Hartness with a
drawn sword in his hand, leading a body of some hundred and fifty
troopers down into the hollow.</p>

<p>Now I saw that we should be able to end the battle quickly, so I
sent up my signal-cry again and called for my own men to come out. Then
I pulled the rope and released the chain, and ran out towards my men,
shouting to them to close round the entrance to the water-cavern and
shoot all who tried to get out. Some three or four sought to escape and
were shot, and then the rest, seeing my men running at them with the
bayonet, and the other troopers coming up, led by a stranger, lost
heart, and crowded back into the cleft, firing their revolvers wildly
as they went.</p>

<p>The next moment we heard cries of terror coming up out of the
darkness, mingled with the rushing of water, and the Governor, followed
by about six of his officers, came leaping up the steps to find a line
of bayonets drawn up across the mouth. With the waters surging up
behind them, and the bayonets in front of them, there was nothing for
them but surrender or death.</p>

<p>Hartness, who had now dismounted, ordered the men to fall back a
pace, and, as they did so, he went through the line with his sword in
one hand and a revolver in the other, and said to the Governor,--</p>

<p>'Senor, will you yield or go back down yonder?'</p>

<p>'We must yield,' said the Governor, 'since there is no choice. But
who are you, and what are you, an Englishman, doing here in arms
against the Government?'</p>

<p>'Who I am matters nothing just now,' he replied, 'and as for your
Government, it no longer exists. That must be enough for you. Now,
senores, give up your swords and revolvers quietly and no harm shall
come to you. You, Senor Prada, give your sword to this caballero here,
who is the Inca Vilcaroya and lawful ruler of this country.'</p>

<p>The Governor turned and stared at me, dumb with amazement at these
strange words, and all the others stared too, for, like him, they had
no doubt heard the legend of my strange fate. He drew his sword, and as
he did so I covered him with my revolver, and extended my hand to take
it. He held the hilt out to me with a trembling hand. I took it in
silence, and then I turned from him and said to my men,--</p>

<p>'Bring these Spaniards out and bind them safely, then follow me to
the Seat of the Incas.'</p>

<p>When they saw that the victory was with us, and that the Governor
himself was our prisoner, together with many of the chief of his
officers, those of the soldiers who had not been for me when they came
were glad enough now to secure themselves by shouting my name and
obeying my orders, and when I moved away towards the seat, they
followed me, laughing and cheering, well pleased to see their hated
masters prisoners in their midst.</p>

<p>The great carved rock which is called the Inca's Seat is, as I have
already said, a great rounded mass of stone rising up from the plain of
the Rodadero, and carved into many seats. On the top there are three
broad seats, the middle one higher than all the rest, and it was here
that my forefathers had sat to watch the building of the great
fortress, and sometimes to give audience to their people.</p>

<p>Now I sat on it, and the soldiers drew themselves up round the rock,
with the prisoners in the midst of them, and I spoke to them, and told
them freely of the strange things that had happened to me, and how I
had come back to the Land of the Four Regions to drive out their
oppressors and restore the just and gentle rule of my ancestors. Then I
had the Governor brought up and stood before me, and bade Francis
Hartness come and sit on my right hand and speak to him for me, and by
his lips I told him that unless the city was surrendered to me before
evening he and all his officers should die, and all the houses of the
Spaniards in the city should be given to the flames and no pity shown
to any man, woman or child of them, for as they had treated my people
so I had sworn to treat them unless they yielded.</p>

<p>You may think how troubled he was at hearing such words as these,
since he knew from what he had seen that there was conspiracy and
treachery among his own men, and he had no knowledge of how far this
had gone, or which of his men he could trust, and so this man, who but
a few hours before had been master of the whole valley, and had looked
upon the Indios, as he called them, as little better than slaves, now
answered me humbly enough and prayed me not to murder him when he was
helpless in my power. And to this I answered him that the blood of my
people had been crying out for many generations against his people, and
that this was the day not of mercy but of vengeance, and that I would
do as I had said unless the city were delivered to me.</p>

<p>Then I descended from the seat and mounted the Governor's horse, and
after I had sent a company of twelve men to ride quickly down to the
city and go through all the streets, shouting my name as a signal to
tell my people that all was well, and that the moment for them to rise
against their oppressors had come, I took my place beside Hartness at
the head of our little army, and with our prisoners well guarded close
behind us we set out on our way back to Cuzco.</p>

<p>As we approached the city we heard the sound of the church-bells
being rung wildly, and looking down, we could see the streets and
squares full of people, and as we got nearer still we heard the
cracking of rifles and the shouts and cries of men in conflict.</p>

<p>'There is either a fight or a riot going on down there,' said
Hartness to me, 'and if many of the soldiers remain faithful to the
Government there'll be some bloodshed before to-night. Have you any
idea how many there are?'</p>

<p>'There were more than two thousand soldiers in the city yesterday,'
I said, 'and out of these more than half have already taken my gold and
sworn faith to me. Of the rest many are wavering, and when they see we
have taken the Governor prisoner I think they will come over.'</p>

<p>'Very likely,' he said; 'but how about those machine-guns in the
barracks? There are three Gatlings and two Maxims, and if they keep
those and work them properly they'll just sweep the streets and squares
clear, you know.'</p>

<p>'I have promised fifty pounds' weight of gold for each of them,' I
said; 'and, more than that, there should be no ammunition for them by
this time if what the sentries told us is true.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, 'if we can get hold of that, or even the best part
of it, I don't think there will be much danger. However, as everything
depends on that, I think we had better go straight to the Cuartel
first. If we have that we have Cuzco.'</p>

<p>We entered the city by the street of El Triunfo, and made our way
straight to the great Plaza. As we rode along three abreast we were
greeted by joyful cries from the crowds of Indians who parted to leave
a way for us through the midst of them. Tupac and his comrades had done
their work well, and all night the people had been thronging into the
city from the surrounding country. All the shops and houses of the
Spaniards were already shut up, and although none knew the truth of
what was happening, all thought that the revolution had already broken
out in Cuzco and so had made themselves as safe as they could.</p>

<p>A little way from the entrance to the great square we came upon
Tupac at the head of some two hundred of the men of San Sebastian,
armed with knives and guns and pistols of all sorts which they had
taken during the night from the towns and villages around, where they
had been doing the work I had bidden them do. He told me that there
were more than a thousand soldiers in the city waiting only for me to
show myself to kill their officers and come over to us, and that the
others would fight without heart, if they fought at all, now that the
Governor was taken--for half of the people of Cuzco were for the
Government and half for the Revolution, and so the city would be
divided against itself and all would be confusion as soon as the
fighting began.</p>

<p>He also told me that the official who is called the Sub-Prefect had
brought out two of the machine-guns and had planted them at each end of
the terrace in front of the cathedral, and made a proclamation that
unless everyone left the streets within an hour he would have them
cleared with bullets.</p>

<p>When I told this to Hartness he said,--</p>

<p>'Then we must have those two guns first. Tell Tupac to break his men
up into little bands of about half-a-dozen each and send them round
into all the streets leading to the square, and tell everyone that
isn't armed to keep out of the way if they don't want to get hurt. Then
you ride on with the prisoners and a guard of fifty men, and let them
be ready to shoot sharply. Tell them to aim at the knees and not to
empty their magazines too fast. I'll look after the guns. They won't
fire on you for fear of killing the Governor and the rest. Now,
forward!'</p>

<p>I did as he said. Tupac's men broke up and disappeared as though by
magic. I took the reins of the horse on which the Governor was bound
and bade half-a-dozen of my men to do the same with the others. Then
two and two we trotted into the square, Tupac running along by my
horse's head. It was covered with groups of people all talking and
looking and pointing about them, and on the terrace before the
cathedral there were two companies of soldiers, one at each end, drawn
up behind a machine-gun.</p>

<p>As soon as the people saw me ride in with the Governor bound beside
me a great shout went up and many came running towards me, but I waved
them back and shouted to them to leave the square and guard all the
streets leading into it. I did this so that those who understood me,
and were therefore friends, might escape out of harm's way before the
guns began to fire.</p>

<p>Then I drew my revolver and put it to the Governor's head and bade
Tupac tell him to order the men away from the guns, and that if a shot
was fired he should be the first to die.</p>

<p>So, as there was no help for it, he did so, and called to the
officers to come down and speak with him, but instead of obeying they
shouted some orders to their men and I saw them making ready to fire
the guns, for, as we found out afterwards, they were men who would have
joined the revolution when it broke out.</p>

<p>But before the guns could be trained on us Hartness's troop swung
round into the square. The twenty foot soldiers sent a volley along the
terrace, firing low as he had told them, and killing and wounding
nearly half of the men at the guns. Then there came a rattling volley
from the cavalry and another from my own men, and then, with a great
shout and a clattering of hoofs, Hartness leapt his horse up the steps
at the end of the terrace, where the street slopes up nearly level with
it at the back by the cathedral, and charged down on the rear of the
enemy just as the gun was swung round.</p>

<p>As he did this I led my men round to the other end of the terrace,
where I saw that the men had begun fighting among themselves, and thus
I knew that some of them were our friends and were seeking to prevent
the others from training the gun on us. I halted, and ordered thirty of
my men to dismount and take the gun, which they did with very little
trouble, for the others, seeing how they were outnumbered, either threw
down their arms and ran away, or surrendered. Two of the officers were
killed and another one taken prisoner.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hartness had cleared the other end of the terrace, and
taken the other gun after killing nearly every man who had defended it.
But scarcely had this been done than we heard the rattle of drums and
the sound of bugles, and saw two columns of men marching at the double
out of the Plaza Del Cabildo, where the barracks are, and the other
past the Church of the Jesuits, which is at the other end of the
square.</p>

<p>'Are those friends or enemies, or both?' Hartness asked me, when he
had ordered the two guns to be trained, one on each of the columns, and
sat down behind one of them himself.</p>

<p>'If there are friends among them,' I said, 'they know what to do,
and when they have done it you can fire.'</p>

<p>Even as I spoke the two columns seemed to break up. Scores of men
broke out of the ranks, shouting my name and cheering, and these all
ran together towards the fountain in the middle of the square. The rest
stopped in wonder and confusion, their officers shouting furiously at
them, and ordering them to fire on the deserters. Some obeyed, others,
when they saw the guns trained on them, ran away and hid themselves in
doorways, and then Hartness gave the order to fire.</p>

<p>Instantly every sound was drowned by the terrible voices of the
machine-guns. Hartness glanced once along the barrel of his, and then
sent a torrent of bullets full into the middle of the broken column
that had come down from the Plaza Del Cabildo. Then he moved it a
little from side to side, and then stopped. When the smoke had drifted
away I saw that there was not a living being in that corner of the
square, only huddled heaps of corpses and bodies of animals. Then he
turned the gun on the other corner into which the other gun was firing,
and soon not a man or an animal was left alive there also.</p>

<p>When the firing ceased there were none left in the square but those
who had declared for us. Hartness immediately formed these into two
columns. He led one of them, with one gun at the head, into the street
past the Church of the Jesuits, and I led the other with the second gun
into the other street leading to the Cuartel, and up these two streets
we fought our way into the Plaza Del Cabildo, in which we could hear
more fighting already going on.</p>

<p>When we at last gained the square we found a furious fight going on
in front of the Cuartel between one body of men who were defending the
building and another that was attacking it, but which of these were
friends or foes we did not know until Tupac, heedless of the flying
bullets, ran out shouting in Quichua that Vilcaroya had come. Shouts
and cheers from the Cuartel soon told us that our friends had got
possession of it, and after the city was won I learned that when the
two columns had started, leaving a third drawn up in the square before
the Cuartel, those who were for us, remembering what I had said about
the gold that I would give for the machine-guns and the ammunition, had
broken their ranks and made a rush for the doors to secure the three
guns which were in the courtyard, and so the fight had begun, they
seeking to hold the Cuartel against the others until help came.</p>

<p>As soon as I knew which were our enemies, by their bullets coming
singing about our ears, I had the gun trained on them, and gave the
word to fire. But no sooner had it begun to rain its tempest of death
than we heard the other one speak from the other end of the square, and
such a storm of bullets swept across the Plaza that before many moments
had passed there was not a man or beast left alive in it.</p>

<p>Then, when the firing ceased again, those who had held the Cuartel,
and had taken shelter in it as soon as the machine-guns began to play,
threw open the doors to us and came out to welcome us, and Francis
Hartness and I clasped hands as victors, and for the time being, at
least, masters of the ancient City of the Sun, for with the Cuartel we
had taken all the arms and ammunition stored up in Cuzco, including the
three Gatling guns and the two Maxims; and more than this, the whole of
the native population of the valley was in our favour.</p>

<p>The fighting was now over, save for conflicts that were going on in
different parts of the city between the Spaniards and the Indians, and
I at once had the Governor brought before me in the Cuartel and told
him by the lips of Hartness to write a proclamation surrendering the
city to us and ordering all the officials to come in and make their
submission before sundown, threatening fire and sack to every Spanish
house if it was not done. This he did, knowing well what would befall
him if he refused. At the same time Hartness made a proclamation in my
name in English and Spanish promising perfect freedom and security to
all foreign merchants in the region that was under our command.</p>

<p>It was then about mid-day, and when I had given Francis Hartness
full authority to act in my name as Governor of the city, which,
speaking fluent Spanish as he did, he could do better than I, I took a
guard of fifty men and went with Tupac back to the Rodadero, and took
ten of the men into the Hall of Gold and bade them carry out as much as
they could, so that I might keep my promise to the soldiers who had
been faithful to me, and while they were doing this I went with Tupac
to Djama's cell and found him wailing and crying like a little child,
and beating his hands on the golden wall of his prison and praying most
piteously for a sight of the daylight and a breath of the fresh air of
heaven.</p>

<p>The Spaniard, when he heard us coming, began to shriek and scream,
and I bade Tupac tell him that I would gag him for a day and a night if
he did not cease his cries. But to Djama I told what had happened, and
how Cuzco was already mine, and promised I would let him out for a
little while the next day if he would keep silence for half-an-hour,
and hearing this, he ceased his cries, and I went on to the throne-room
to take the news of our victory to Ruth and Golden Star.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII - QUEEN AND CROWN</h2>

<p>I found them in the midst of an English lesson which Golden Star was
taking, sitting, still clad in her Inca costume, between the professor
and Joyful Star, who also was dressed in the same fashion. They all
three rose to meet me as I entered the throne-room, and Ruth coming
forward with both hands outstretched, as she had never done before,
said,--</p>

<p>'What have you been doing all this time, Vilcaroya, and why are you
looking so worn and haggard? Have--have you been fighting? And why have
you come back here alone?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I answered, taken her hands into mine, and feeling all my
blood urn to flame as their gentle pressure thrilled along my nerves.
'Yes, we have been fighting, and the Lord of Light has fought upon our
side, for we have gained the victory, and the city is ours.'</p>

<p>'Thank God for that!' she said; 'and that no harm has come to
you--or to Captain Hartness.'</p>

<p>'What! do you mean to say you have taken Cuzco already?' cried the
professor. 'How on earth did you manage that so quickly?'</p>

<p>'Because,' I replied, 'as I told you, my father the Sun fought on my
side and turned the hearts of his children towards me, and so Francis
Hartness led them to speedy victory, and the hearts of our enemies
fainted within them, and they have yielded. Now I have come to tell you
how it happened, and to take Joyful Star back to the city, where she
shall be hailed as queen.'</p>

<p>Then I sat down with them and told them all, from the taking of the
Governor and his officers prisoners by the Sayacusca to the capture of
the Cuartel and the making of Francis Hartness Governor of Cuzco. After
that I went and put on the imperial robes, which I had now a double
right to wear, and led them through the gates of bronze into the Hall
of Gold.</p>

<p>Now, in the joy of my triumph, and the greeting that Ruth had given
me, I had forgotten to bid her keep silence while going through the
hall, and when she saw the two cells in the corner built up with blocks
of gold she stopped and said,--</p>

<p>'Those were not here the other night. What have you had them built
up like that for?'</p>

<p>And before I could answer, Djama's voice, shrill and trembling, rose
out of the cell, crying,--</p>

<p>'Ruth, Ruth, I am here! This is my prison. It is a grave of gold.
Curse the gold! Save me, save me, Ruth, for I am going mad--and I am
your brother!'</p>

<p>She stopped and took hold of my arm with both her hands, and looked
up at me. Her face was very pale and her lips were trembling. Yet
though her voice was low, it was firm as she said to me,--</p>

<p>'I have no brother who is a liar and a traitor to his friends; but,
Vilcaroya, I had a brother once who was very good and kind to me, and
for the sake of his goodness and kindness I ask you to treat this--this
prisoner of yours more gently.'</p>

<p>'Joyful Star can ask nothing to-day that I could refuse,' I said.
'He shall be taken out forthwith and lodged with all comfort, though I
must keep him safely.'</p>

<p>'No, no, not till I am gone!' she whispered, taking Golden Star by
the arm and leading her towards the passage. But, softly as she had
spoken, Djama heard her, and in his rage and despair at her words he
cried,--</p>

<p>'You--you won't see me! But you will go with your lover, your Indian
master, who owes his life to me! You will sell yourself for his gold
and be his wife. Oh, my God!--my sister!'</p>

<p>And then he raved in the madness that came upon him, and his voice
rang horridly out of his cell and echoed shrilly through the hall and
the passages about it. I could feel no anger against a man who was
helpless and my prisoner, so I followed Ruth without speaking; and when
we stood once more in the sunlight she turned to me with a bright flush
on her cheeks and great tears in her eyes, and said very softly and
sweetly,--</p>

<p>'He is mad, poor Laurens! he must be. That terrible gold has turned
his brain, or he could never speak to me like that. You will not treat
him more harshly for it, Vilcaroya, will you, for you know, after all,
he is--I mean he was my brother, and I loved him very much--once?'</p>

<p>'Yes, he is mad,' I said; 'and yet the lips of madness may speak
truth, for what am I but what he said?'</p>

<p>'Have you forgotten what you asked me, or what I answered when I
kissed Golden Star in the throne-room, that you can speak like that?'
she said, with one swift glance that told me I had not asked in
vain.</p>

<p>What more she might have said I know not but she had said enough to
set my heart dancing and my blood thrilling with a joy greater than I
had found in the speedy conquest of the city of my fathers, and just
then Tupac came to me and said that a sufficient quantity of gold had
been taken out, and that all was ready to return to the city. Then I
told him what he was to do with Djama and his fellow-prisoner, and
ordered Golden Star's litter and the horse for Ruth which we had
brought with us to be made ready, and also a mule for the professor,
and when Tupac had returned we set out along the road that leads to the
Gate of Sand, I riding in the midst of the troop, and Ruth on my left
hand and Golden Star in her litter on the right.</p>

<p>As we approached the streets, great crowds of my delivered people
thronged out to welcome us, and when they saw me riding on my black
horse, dressed in the imperial robes and with the Llautu on my brow,
they set up a shout of joy and welcome that went ringing along the
streets and through the squares and all over the city, and so I rode on
through the bareheaded throngs, who bowed themselves almost to the
earth before me.</p>

<p>As we were crossing the great Plaza, Ruth looked about her with
bright cheeks and shining eyes and said to me,--</p>

<p>'Is it not all like a dream, Vilcaroya? Only a few weeks ago you
came here poor and unknown, and now you are a king come back to your
own again. Is it not wonderful?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said, looking into her eyes with more courage than before;
'but something more wonderful even than that has befallen me. Is it not
so, my queen?'</p>

<p>'Your queen is not crowned yet, your Majesty!' she said, looking
down, and yet not frowning, as I half feared she would.</p>

<p>'No,' I answered, 'nor shall she be till my work is done, and the
whole land that was my fathers' is mine to give her, and then all that
power and gold and love can give her shall be hers.'</p>

<p>'Give me the last and I shall ask no more,' she said softly, chasing
with that first sweet confession from my heart the last lingering doubt
of the great blessing that my Father the Sun had bestowed upon me.</p>

<p>Thus we came to the front of the Cuartel, where all the troops were
already drawn up to do us honour, and Hartness came out to greet us. He
stopped for an instant, and his cheeks paled a little as he saw Ruth
riding at my side, already dressed as she would be when she was my
queen. But then the goodness of his honest heart spoke from his lips,
and he said, as he held out his hand to me,--</p>

<p>'Welcome, your Majesty! Majesties, I might almost say, I suppose!
The city is ours and everything is quiet. Some of the officials have
come in and submitted; others I have had to put under arrest, and
runners are coming in every minute from the other towns in the valley
to say that our plans have been carried out perfectly. The rest of our
work won't be as easy as this has been, but we've made a very good
beginning, and, at anyrate, I think I can congratulate your Majesty on
having made your two most important captures.</p>

<p>He looked at Ruth as he said this, and though her fair face flushed
brightly and her eyes fell, yet she spoke steadily enough when she
answered him, saying,--</p>

<p>'You can hardly call me one of the spoils of war, I think, Captain
Hartness, though I confess that I have surrendered at discretion. Now
give me your hand and help me down, and don't look so disconsolate, for
you are not nearly as unfortunate as you think. There is an Inca
princess for you also, a real one, too. I have been teaching Golden
Star to say your name, and, do you know, she makes it sound just like
music with that sweet voice of hers. See, here she is, and you shall
hear her say it.'</p>

<p>I had dismounted meanwhile, and taken Golden Star from her litter,
and when the people saw her, her name ran swiftly from lip to lip, and
a great shout of delight rose up from thousands of throats to welcome
her back to life and the home of her long-dead fathers. Then I took her
hand and Hartness's, and put hers in his, and said to him,--</p>

<p>'My friend, what I have taken I can in some measure give back to
you. Here is Joyful Star's sister-soul and living likeness. I have seen
her newly-awakened soul look out of her eyes with love upon you, as in
good truth it well might, for you are a true son of the Sun, though not
of our blood. In the days to come you may learn to love her too, and
then all will be well.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Ruth, coming to his side, 'and better than it could have
been in any other way. The very Fates themselves seemed to have
arranged all this, so it is not for mortals to rebel, Captain
Hartness.'</p>

<p>He looked at her almost sadly for a moment, and then he laughed a
little and said,--</p>

<p>'I should be more or less than mortal if I did, Miss Ruth. But mind,
if I am faithless, remember it is you who have done the most to make me
so.'</p>

<p>As he said this he took Golden Star's little hand in his own and
kissed it. As she felt the touch of his lips a new light sprang into
her eyes and shone and danced there, and she said to me,--</p>

<p>'Why does the Son of the Great People do that, and what have you
said to him about me, my brother?'</p>

<p>'He has kissed your hand in loving greeting,' I answered, 'and what
I have said he will no doubt tell you better some day when you can
speak together.'</p>

<p>The bright blood in her cheeks told me that she had understood me,
and she turned her head away, but she did not take her hand from
Hartness's, and so I gave my hand to Ruth and led her into the Cuartel,
and Hartness and Golden Star followed us hand in hand amidst the cheers
of the soldiers and the joyful shouts of the people.</p>

<p>That night there were such rejoicings in Cuzco as the City of the
Sun had not seen since the Spaniards came into the land. I distributed
the gold among the soldiers as I had promised, giving to each man a
piece of about two ounces in weight, and they, who had never possessed,
even if they had ever seen, gold before, kissed it and fondled it in
their delight, and swore that they would fight for me as long as one of
them was left alive; and then I spoke to them and told them that they
had but to be faithful and brave, and their English leader would lead
them to victory after victory, until the whole land should be ours.</p>

<p>Later on I sent Tupac with many men up to the fortress, and they
brought down the Golden Throne and the symbols of the Sun and great
quantities of gold and jewels, and they set the throne in the midst of
the terrace in front of the cathedral, with silver seats on either side
of it, on the spot where in the olden time stood the Palace of
Viracocha; and on the front of the cathedral, over the great doors,
they fixed the symbols of the Sun, and high above all, between the two
bell-towers, they placed a great flagstaff.</p>

<p>Before daybreak the next morning the square was thronged with
people, save for an open space which the soldiers kept before my
throne. I took my place amidst an utter silence. Ruth and Golden Star
sat on my right and on my left, and Francis Hartness, with a drawn
sword in his hand, stood by my throne to the right, and on the terrace
behind me, and on either side, stood the Men of the Blood, dressed in
their ancient and long-forbidden costumes, with which I had furnished
them out of the stores in the secret chambers of the fortress.</p>

<p>No word was spoken and no sound was heard over the whole city, and
all eyes were turned to the swiftly brightening eastern sky.</p>

<p>The blue changed to silver and the silver to crimson and gold. Then
the sun, the glorious image of the Lord of Life, uprose in all his
sudden splendour, and as his rays fell on the great golden jewel-rayed
circle on the cathedral front, the Rainbow Banner ran swiftly up to the
head of the flagstaff, and I, rising from my throne, bared my head and,
turning my face to the rising sun, bowed myself before it, and at the
same instant every head in the vast assembly was uncovered, and all,
save the soldiers, fell on their knees and stretched out their hands to
heaven in silent joy and thankfulness.</p>

<p>Then I lifted up my voice and spoke the ancient Invocation to the
Sun which generation after generation of my fathers had spoken from the
same spot at the beginning of the feast of Raymi, and when I had ended
this the Children of the Blood lifted up their voices after me and sang
the long-silenced and yet never-forgotten hymn to the Sun, and then,
standing before the kneeling multitude, I replaced the Llautu on my
brow and proclaimed myself Inca and supreme Lord of the Land of the
Four Regions in the name of my long-dead fathers, whose divine right to
lordship had been preserved in me.</p>

<p>And so I, Vilcaroya, son of Huayna-Capac, first fulfilled the
prophecy that had been spoken in the Days of Darkness, and so did I
come, as had been said, from one life into another through the shadow
of death and the silence of the grave, with her whose love, now
changed, though no less dear, had nerved me to face the ordeal of the
strangest fate that had ever befallen one born in mortal shape.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII - HOW DJAMA PAID HIS DEBT</h2>

<p>It is one of the mysteries of this lower life of ours that men,
meaning to do good in all honesty of heart, may yet do evil in the
doing of it, and it was thus with me in the hour of my first triumph
and rejoicing.</p>

<p>I had pondered long and deeply over the strange treachery of Djama,
and I had talked of it with Francis Hartness and the professor until I
had come to see that he was in truth sorely afflicted with that madness
which is born of the lust of gold, which, as they told me, is a disease
of the soul that makes timid men rash and mild ones fierce and cunning,
and may even turn the gentleness of woman into the pitiless rage of
beasts of prey.</p>

<p>It was through thinking of this that I came to see that I was by no
means blameless myself for his madness and the treachery that had come
from it.</p>

<p>In my own days and among my own people gold was held precious only
for its beauty and its usefulness. We had not learned the art of making
it into money and buying men's souls and bodies with it, but I had
already lived enough of my new life to see that now, save for the few,
gold was all and honour nothing; and knowing this, I should also have
known what I was doing when I showed Djama the treasures in the Hall of
Gold. The sight of them had made him mad, and, as my hand had shown
them to him, the blame of what he had done in his madness was in part
mine.</p>

<p>All this I remembered in the hour when my soul was filled with joy
and my heart warm with love, and I thought how great a pleasure I
should give to her who had given me the better part of my own joy if I
looked upon Djama with pity and forgiveness and did an act of mercy as
the first deed of my new reign.</p>

<p>So, when the ceremonial of my crowning was over, I bade Tupac take
some of my body-guard and bring him before me from the place where he
had been lodged after his release from his golden cell, and at the same
time I quieted the fears of Joyful Star by telling her what was in my
heart concerning him.</p>

<p>They brought him unbound, but well guarded by soldiers with bayonets
on their rifles, up the broad avenue which the parted throng had made
across the square in front of my throne.</p>

<p>I saw him stare wildly about him as he came near, gazing at the
splendid sun-lit pageant like a man in a dream, or one just awakened
into another world, as I had been after my long death-sleep. But when
he came near, and saw me sitting in my royal state with Joyful Star on
my right and Golden Star on my left, both robed as princesses of the
Ancient Blood, his face grew dark with passion, and his eyes, losing
their wonder, gazed in fixed and furious hate at me--the man who was
going to give him his life, and much more that he had coveted
besides.</p>

<p>They placed him between two soldiers before me at the foot of the
terrace steps above which my throne had been set, and I was about to
speak and greet him kindly, when his anger already got the better of
him, and, with a mocking smile on his lips, he said in a loud, rough
voice that was most unlike his own quiet, even tones,--</p>

<p>'Well, your Majesty, as I suppose you think yourself for the
present, I expected something like this--to be brought out into the
midst of your fellow-savages and sentenced like a felon before my own
sister and the woman who, like yourself, owes her life to me!'</p>

<p>Then he laughed one of his strange, joyless laughs, and went on
before I could reply,--</p>

<p>'Well, I suppose I mustn't grumble. You have won, and to the victor
go the spoils. Now that you have apparently bought the girl who was
once my sister with your gold, and I have given you your own
sister-wife back, you will be able to try an interesting experiment in
your old form of matrimony-'</p>

<p>I saw Joyful Star shrink back in her seat and turn her head away
from him with a little cry as he said these evil words, and they
angered me so, that--forgetting they were spoken by a man who stood
helpless before me--I cried,--</p>

<p>'Silence, liar and speaker of evil! or your next words shall be the
last that human ears shall hear you speak. Are you still mad, or have
you forgotten that you were once a man?'</p>

<p>He smiled such a smile as you may have seen on the lips of one who
has died in agony, and said with a swift change in his voice,--</p>

<p>'I beg your Majesty's pardon, and--and the ladies' too. It was a
most ungentlemanly thing to say, and one should not forget one's
manners on the threshold of the next world--if there is one. But come,
your Majesty, you are wasting your valuable time, and keeping all these
interesting savages of yours waiting. You'll find I shall take it
quietly enough. What do you propose that it shall be--something with
boiling oil or red-hot pincers in it?'</p>

<p>I knew that a man who could speak thus, believing that he was about
to die, must be in a pitiful plight, and so I answered him sternly, and
yet without anger,--</p>

<p>'Laurens Djama, I have not brought you here to jest with you, nor
yet, as you think, to condemn you to die, though your life is justly
forfeit to me and my people, whom you would have betrayed again to
their oppressors. Now, listen! You brought me back from death to life,
and for my life I will give you yours, and for Golden Star's I will pay
you the price agreed on and something more. It was by my foolish act
that the madness of the gold-hunger came upon you, and for that I will
give you your freedom; but not now, for that would not be safe for me
or my people, since you have betrayed us once, and, knowing what you
do, might do so again. You shall be taken hence to a pleasant and
fertile valley, where you shall have all freedom, save permission to
leave it until this war is over and I am undisputed lord of the land of
my fathers. Then you shall take the wealth that shall be yours and go
to your own country, or whereever you please, so long as you do not
remain in mine, for here there is no place for you, since my people do
not forgive as easily as I do. Now I have spoken; if there is anything
more that you can ask, and I can give with safety, ask it.'</p>

<p>Most men who had sinned as he had done would have very willingly
taken such forgiveness, and Laurens Djama might have taken it but for a
seemingly small thing. While I was speaking to him his eyes had
wandered from mine and were looking into Golden Star's. As I ceased I
felt her hands clasping my arm, and heard her voice say tremblingly in
our own tongue,--</p>

<p>'Save me, my lord and brother, save me! Evil Eyes is looking into my
heart and turning it cold!'</p>

<p>This Djama saw, though he did not understand her words, and the
sight brought the madness into his blood again. He shouted with a voice
like the cry of a wild beast in pain,--</p>

<p>'Curse you! I will have neither life nor liberty from you, but I'll
have your life for mine, and that will pay me better!'</p>

<p>As the last word left his lips he made a movement so quick that my
eyes could not follow it. The next instant he had wrenched the rifle
from the hands of the soldier on his right hand and levelled it at me.
Even as he did so Joyful Star flung herself with a scream upon my
breast and Hartness sprang forward from behind my throne-seat.</p>

<p>The rifle flashed. I heard a hissing sound close to my ear and a
deep groan and the fall of a body behind me. In the same moment Djama
was seized and flung to the ground, where he lay quite still and
silent. I rose to my feet, clasping Joyful Star for the first time in
my arms, and looked round. Hartness stood beside me unharmed, but old
Ullulo, the first friend that I had made in my new life among my own
people, lay dead behind my throne with a bullet through his
forehead.</p>

<p>I had not forgotten that old training which taught an Inca warrior
to look on near-approaching death with unmoved eyes and unshaken heart,
and this was only such a hazard as I had taken a score of times before.
I bade Hartness lead Ruth and Golden Star into the temple behind us, so
that they should not see what was about to be done. Then I took my
place on the throne again and ordered Djama to be raised and stood on
his feet.</p>

<p>He rose of himself, very pale but calm and strong in his own evil
strength, fearing nothing, as became a man for whom death had no
terrors and, it might be, few secrets. We looked each other in the eyes
in silence, and in the midst of an utter stillness that had fallen on
the vast throng, until Hartness came back. Then I said,--</p>

<p>'That is enough, Laurens Djama. Choose now what death you will die,
but, for your own sake and Joyful Star's, choose a quick one.'</p>

<p>Although my voice was as the voice of doom to him, yet he did not
quail even then, for if his heart was black it was very strong, and
fear had never entered into it. He drew himself up to the full height
of his stature and, looking me full in the eyes, he said as quietly as
I had ever heard him speak,--</p>

<p>'That choice is always mine, whether you give it to me or not. You
have threatened me with death before and I have told you that you could
not kill me. Now watch and see if I spoke the truth.'</p>

<p>Then, with a soldier holding each of his arms and two others
grasping his shoulders, he drew a quick, deep, gasping breath. The
blood rushed into his face till its pallor became purple. The next
instant it became deathly white again. His jaw dropped, his eyes grew
fixed and blindly staring, and then his shape seemed to shrink together
like an empty bag, and he sank down between those who were holding
him.</p>

<p>They pulled him upright again, and his head dropped forward on his
breast. He was dead--dead as though the Llapa itself had struck
him--and so Laurens Djama, master of the arts of life and death, passed
out of the world of living men by the act of his own will, though not
of his own hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV - THE RE-KINDLING OF THE SACRED FIRE</h2>

<p>Now this story of mine is nearly done, for there are but few things
left for me to tell. It is not for me to write of all the battles that
we fought after the City of the Sun and the region about it fell into
our hands, for to do that is a task better fitted to the hands of him
who led my ever-growing hosts to victory after victory until the whole
land that had been my fathers' was mine from north to south and from
the great rivers of the east to the Sea of the Setting Sun, which you
now call the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>It is enough for me to say that I used my gold without stint, and
that it did all and more than the work I had been told it would do. As
we marched southward and westward to the sea, army after army left
those who were fighting between themselves for the ruins of the land
and, having no real quarrel of their own, ranged themselves under the
Rainbow Banner and fought with me for freedom and the ancient faith of
their long-dead fathers, and how city after city welcomed me as I came
to give it peace and wealth instead of strife and misery.</p>

<p>My unforgotten story and the marvel of my coming back from the days
of our old-time glories had sped like the leaps of the lightning from
mountain to mountain and valley to valley, and every man in whose veins
flowed even the smallest drop of the Sacred Blood threw aside the
broken fragments of the oppressor's yoke and came to give me his
service.</p>

<p>From other countries, too, and from far over the sea, there came men
to fight for me, men whom Hartness had called from afar by speaking to
them over the lightning-wires, and they brought ships with them, armed
with flame and thunder, which the promise of my gold had purchased, and
these took all the seaports for me, while my ever-growing armies were
taking the cities of the inland valleys--all of which those who would
learn may read in the great book which Francis Hartness and the
professor, who with Joyful Star have helped out these lame words of
mine, are writing together to tell how the ancient empire of the Incas
rose at my call and the bidding of my gold--which I doubt not was far
stronger than I--out of the degradation into which the oppressors had
cast it, and has even now begun to prosper again with more than its
former glory.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, these things are not for me to tell, since I
have neither the skill nor the knowledge to do so. What I have set down
here is only the story of my own awakening out of the death-sleep into
which the arts of the priests of the Sun had cast me with Golden Star,
and of her return to join me in my new life. I have told of that and of
all that befell us afterwards, and now there remains only the telling
of that which fulfilled our strange fates and completed our happiness
in the new world into which those fates had brought us.</p>

<p>Many weeks passed and grew into months before the oppressors were
finally subdued and I found myself undisputed lord of all the land,
and, as I had promised Joyful Star, all this had to come to pass before
I would ask her to put her hand into mine and take her place beside me
as my Coya and queen on the throne of Huayna-Capac.</p>

<p>But at length there was peace in the land and we returned from Lima,
the capital of the Spaniards, where I had been proclaimed and
acknowledged Inca and Emperor of my ancient domains, to the City of the
Sun, which many loving and willing hands had cleansed of the
abominations of its new idolatries and made in some measure fit to
receive us, to crown our new lives with such happiness as, with the
help and blessing of the Unnameable, we might be able to bestow upon
each other.</p>

<p>The treasures of gold and silver and ornaments of jewels, the rich
hangings and the sacred and precious emblems had been brought from the
Hall of Gold and the throne-room beneath the Sacsahuaman and set up in
the chief temple of the Spaniards, which stands in the place where the
holy Temple of the Sun once stood and is in great part built of the
self-same stones.*</p>

<p>*This is not quite correct, although a natural mistake on the part
of the Inca. It is not the Cathedral of Cuzco, but the Church of Santo
Domingo, which stands on the site of the ancient Temple of the Sun. It
is by far the finest church in Cuzco. The Cathedral faces the great
square.</p>

<p>It was the eve of the Feast of Raymi, or the Coming of the Sun,
which in the olden time we counted as the beginning of the year, and I
had determined that this day should witness the restoration of the old
order and the beginning of my own true happiness--so that night Golden
Star and I, as became the son and daughter of the Royal Race and Sacred
Blood, watched and prayed according to the ancient rites--she in a
chamber of what had once been the House of the Virgins of Sun, and I in
the purified temple--from the setting of the sun until the first waning
of the stars in the coming dawn.</p>

<p>Very early in the morning she was brought to me in the temple by
Tupac-Rayca--whom I had in virtue of his pure blood and noble decent,
consecrated Villac-Umu or High Priest of the Sun, and who had in turn
invested such others of the Blood as he thought worthy with the
subordinate dignities of the holy office. He and his attendants were
arrayed in the ancient priestly robes and adorned with the sacred
emblems of their rank, and Golden Star was attired as a royal Virgin of
the Sun, in garments of white edged with scarlet and decked with
ornaments of pure gold.</p>

<p>Then we prayed together before the newly-set-up altar, which stood
over against the eastern window of the Sanctuary, and when that duty
was ended, and while the growing light was yet dim, there came to us
Joyful Star, also arrayed as a princess of the Blood, and Francis
Hartness, whom my thankful people had already named Viracocha, after
one of our golden-haired hero-gods of the olden time.</p>

<p>After them came all those of the Sacred Race that were left in the
land--men and matrons, youths and maidens--all dressed in the
long-forbidden garb of their forefathers, and ranged themselves in two
silent, orderly ranks down the sides of the Sanctuary, waiting with
patient eagerness for that which they had been bidden here to see.</p>

<p>Above the altar hung the great golden Emblem of the Sun, upon which
the radiant glance of the Lord of Light would first fall through the
circular window in the eastern wall, and on it was a pyramid of wood
anointed with scented oils; for here was soon to be re-kindled--if our
Lord the Sun should smile on the new fortunes of his long-suffering
children--without the aid of human hands, that sacred fire first lit by
Manco Capac and Mama Occlu, son and daughter of the Sun, and which had
burnt unquenched through all the ages that had passed from the founding
to the fall of our ancient empire. Beside it lay a cone-shaped vessel
of burnished gold, in the depths of which the Sacred Fleece awaited the
touch that was to change it into flame.</p>

<p>When all were assembled, Tupac-Rayca mounted the steps of the altar,
and, facing the silent throng, began to speak in the ancient and
unforgotten tongue and said,--</p>

<p>'Children of the Sun, sons and daughters of those whose ancestors in
the unremembered days received the divine command to create the empire
over which they ruled with ever-growing glory until, by the inscrutable
decrees of the Unnameable, the destroyer and oppressor were permitted
to come into the land, listen with open ears and thankful hearts to the
words which our Father shall put into my mouth to say to you!'</p>

<p>All bowed their heads and crossed their hands over their breasts as
he spoke, and after a little silence he went on,--</p>

<p>'The last of the Villac-Umus who stood where I am standing told your
fathers and mine of the near-approaching night of gloom and desolation
that was about to fall upon the Land of the Four Regions. For what sins
of his children our Father permitted that night to eclipse the bright
day of their empire we know not, nor is it lawful for us to inquire.
Let it be enough for us to believe that, grievous as the doom was, it
could not have been anything save the inflexible justice of the
Unnameable.'</p>

<p>Again they bowed their heads, and there was silence for a little
space until he went on, speaking this time in a gladder voice,--</p>

<p>'But, stern as that justice was, it was yet not untempered with
mercy, for with the words of doom there came from our Father, by the
lips of his minister, the holy Anda-Huillac, those words of hope and
promise which from that day to this have been handed down in secret,
yet unforgotten, from father to son and from mother to daughter, and
which now for the first time since then may be spoken openly in the
land:--</p>

<p>'"To that Son of the Sacred Race who, for honour and faith and love,
shall take the hand of a pure virgin of his own holy blood and with her
pass fearless through the gate of death into the shadows which lie
beyond, shall be given the glory of casting down the oppressor and
raising the Rainbow Banner once more above the Golden Throne of the
Incas. On that throne he shall sit, and wield power and mete out
justice and mercy to the Children of the Sun when the gloom that is now
falling upon the Land of the Four Regions shall have passed away in the
dawn of a brighter age."</p>

<p>'Sons and daughters of the long-dead, turn your eyes and see how the
eastern skies are swiftly brightening with first rays of that
long-looked-for dawn. This is the morning of our deliverance, for our
deliverers stand here before us, and with your own eyes you may look
upon those who, in the strength of their love and faith, dared the doom
to win the promise, for here in the living flesh stands that Vilcaroya,
son of the great Huayna-Capac, and there beside him is Golden Star,
that virgin of the Royal Race who of her own will joined hands with him
in the wedlock of death, and whose pure soul has dwelt with his in the
Mansions of the Sun while ten generations of men have lived and died
awaiting their return to the land.</p>

<p>'To us, more blessed, it has been given to see that which our
fathers waited for in vain. To us our Lord Vilcaroya and our Lady
Golden Star have come back from the shadows of death into the light of
life and glory of victory. Already you have seen the oppressor pay the
price of life for life, and blood for blood, and shame for shame. You
have seen our Lord seated on the golden throne of the Divine Manco with
the Rainbow Banner waving high above him, and now the moment has come
for you to see the fulfilling of what yet remains of the promise
unfulfilled. Behold the visible presence of our Father comes near to
smile once more on his children long left in darkness!'</p>

<p>While he was speaking these last words the light in the eastern sky
had brightened fast until a sunray leapt over the lower rim of the
window and shone on the painted ceiling of the Sanctuary. At a sign
from Tupac-Rayca, Golden Star took up the vessel in which lay the
Sacred Fleece, and, standing in the middle of the altar on the highest
step, held it poised in her hands above her head, with her pale, fair
face and shining eyes upturned towards the window.</p>

<p>Foot by foot the light crept along the roof, broadening and
brightening as it went, till it touched the western wall. Then, ever
followed by the anxious eyes of the silent throng, it descended until
the great Symbol of the Sun flashed and flamed in its radiance. Still
lower it sank and the burnished vessel that Golden Star held to receive
them caught the gathering rays and glowed as though filled with liquid
fire.</p>

<p>Now the moment for the giving of the Sign had come.</p>

<p>Now the moment for the giving of the Sign had come. A faint wreath
of pale blue smoke curled upwards from the Sacred Fleece. It grew
darker and denser, and then a little tongue of flame leapt out from the
midst of it. At the same instant Tupac seized the vessel and held it
upturned over the pyramid of wood upon the altar. The burning fleece
fell down upon the anointed wood, a long shaft of fire shot upward,
and, as the descending sunrays fell over the face and bosom of Golden
Star, the voice of Tupac rang out in an exultant chant through the
silence, saying,--</p>

<p>'Rejoice, Children of the Sun, rejoice! for your Father has once
more looked in kindness and blessing upon you, and with the radiant
glance of his eyes he has re-kindled the long-quenched fire which
henceforth shall burn upon his altar as long as his visible presence
shall make bright the heavens and beautiful the earth!'</p>

<p>As he ceased, Golden Star's voice rose up clear and sweet, singing
the first words of the Hymn to the Sun--as I alone of all that throng
had heard her sing them in the days that were no more. Then the
Children of the Blood raised their voices too, and out of the fulness
of their thankful hearts poured forth their first tribute of praise and
thanksgiving to Him who had broken the yoke of the oppressor and given
back light and joy and peace to the long-darkened Land of the Four
Regions.</p>

<p>When the Hymn to the Sun was ended and the Children of the Blood had
received the blessing of Tupac, there was yet one more ceremony to be
performed before the rejoicings of the Feast of Raymi began. There is
little need for me to tell you what it was. In love as in war I had
striven and conquered, and now the dearest of my rewards, dearer far
than wealth or empire, was to be made mine by the free gift of her who
was herself that which she gave.</p>

<p>Two of the priests brought forth the marriage-font and placed it in
front of the altar, and Joyful Star stood on the one side of it and I
on the other and we joined hands across it.</p>

<p>It was a double vessel of gold, formed of two twin cups, and between
them there was a hole stopped by a golden plug, to which a little chain
was fastened. The cup on my side was filled with blood-red wine and
that towards Joyful Star with pure water, crystal clear.</p>

<p>Tupac took our hands in his and parted them, saying as he did
so,--</p>

<p>'To meet and to part is the lot of man and woman upon earth, yet
when two true souls meet and two faithful hearts are joined even death
can part them but in seeming, for in the bright halls of the Mansions
of the Sun they shall dwell for ever in the blessed presence of our
Father!'</p>

<p>So saying, he joined our hands again, and drawing out the golden
plug, he pointed to the mingling fluids and went on, speaking now to
each of us in turn,--</p>

<p>'Here, Vilcaroya Inca, and you, Joyful Star, daughter of a
conquering race and well-beloved of our Lord, see the emblem of the
union between you! As the strong red wine colours and strengthens the
pure water, so, Joyful Star, shall the stronger nature of thy chosen
husband colour and strengthen thine, and, as the pure water tempers and
purifies the wine, so, Vilcaroya Inca, shall the gentler and purer
nature of her who is henceforth thy wife and queen by the rites of our
ancient law, soften and purify thine according to the will and purpose
of the Unnameable, who to this end sent man and woman upon earth that
together they might possess and enjoy it, each helping the other, man
making the world fruitful and beautiful by his labour, and woman
sweetening his toil by the reward of her love and her constancy.'</p>

<p>Then he raised his hands above our heads as we bowed them together
over the emblem of our mingling lives, and said again,--</p>

<p>'Son and daughter, man and wife, who have met from afar, and who in
this solemn act have sworn in the all-pervading presence of the
Unnameable to lead each other from this your meeting-place to the dim
border of the shadow-land which lies between this world and the
threshold of the Mansions of the Sun, may the blessing of our Father
clothe your brows with honour and fill your hearts with everlasting
love and trust, and may He guide your feet to walk in pleasant places
from now even to the end!'</p>

<p>As he ceased our hands parted, only to meet again a moment later
after we had stepped aside to yield up our places at the marriage-font
to Francis Hartness and Golden Star.</p>
