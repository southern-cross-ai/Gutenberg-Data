<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER 1</h2>

<p class="first">THERE is no pleasanter place in London after
dinner than the large central hall of the Carlton Club, with its
comfortable armchairs and its little coffee tables, that suggest
both privacy and gregariousness.</p>

<p>For here a man may speak to a fellow-member without being
introduced&mdash;perhaps because it has so large a number of
young men among its members. Just now, the tables were almost
empty. It was only a little past eight. Haliburton had dined
early in that large dining-room where the portraits of
Conservative statesmen look down tolerantly on morning-coats or
full tails. Haliburton had had a friend, a saturnine, silent man
called Tark, dining with him; and now Moy, a young solicitor, had
dropped in for a few words.</p>

<p>Haliburton was talking at the moment.</p>

<p>"I think I'm a fatalist," he was saying. "Yes, on the whole, I
think I am." He was a pleasant-faced young man, tall, thin, with
a certain assured yet unhurried way with him which, some said,
was due to the fact that he had never yet had to bestir himself
for anything. He was the son of Haliburton, the banker, and
grandson of Haliburton, the ship-owner, and through his mother
alone had as an income what many would consider a handsome
capital. He was Unionist member for some small country
constituency until something better should be free.</p>

<p>Moy was about the same age, around twenty-five; small of
stature, quick and eager in eye and movement. Tark, the third
man, struck such a different note that at first glance one would
have taken him for a foreigner. Moy liked Haliburton, but he did
not care for his companion, whom he had met in his company a
couple of times lately. But, though he did not like Tark, Moy was
interested in the man. For the young solicitor was writing a play
in secret, and was keenly interested in finding characters for
it. Haliburton, he had decided, was no earthly good to a writer.
Rich. Easy going. Kindly...but this other, the chap with the name
that suited him somehow&mdash;because it rhymed with shark
probably, Moy decided&mdash;he might be very useful. He turned to
him now.</p>

<p>"You a fatalist too?" he asked. "But you can't be, or you
wouldn't have fished Haliburton out of that weir as you did."</p>

<p>Everyone in their little world knew that Tark's punt and
Haliburton's canoe had collided on the Thames, and that, but for
Tark's swimming powers, the House of Haliburton would have had no
heir, for Haliburton could not swim. Somehow you wouldn't expect
him to, Moy reflected. Haliburton would naturally count on a
motor boat turning up, or a submarine nipping along, or a
seaplane swooping to his assistance.</p>

<p>"No." Tark's voice suggested that he had said all there was to
say on the point. He was the most silent man that Moy had yet
met.</p>

<p>"A fatalist doesn't necessarily mean a man of inaction,"
Haliburton explained carefully.</p>

<p>"He evidently struggled in the water!" Moy said with a laugh.
Haliburton laughed too. Tark only gave a twist of his thin tight
lips.</p>

<p>What a pity that his play was not on the Inquisition, Moy
thought. Tark would do so splendidly for one of the inquisitors;
a man without feelings, but with plenty of intelligence. Or had
Tark intelligence? He looked at the low forehead, the high set
ears, the something about the whole face that suggested stone, or
wood, and was not sure. But his suitability for the role of
inquisitor seemed to fit better the longer he studied him. Yet
Tark had never shown him any eagerness, any intensity of emotion,
and an inquisitor must be capable of both. It must be something
hidden deep down in the man. Unless his ideas of him were all
wrong, Moy reflected.</p>

<p>"Well." Moy roused himself from his discreet but intent
contemplation of Tark. "Now for the reason for my coming in
formal state this evening. I have a Proposal I want to lay before
you, Haliburton."</p>

<p>"And I thought you a friend," murmured Haliburton lazily.</p>

<p>"You know that we&mdash;my father's firm&mdash;often have
houses to let for our clients? Well, among these is a house in
Chelsea called The Tall House."</p>

<p>"Sir Miles Huntington's?" Haliburton labeled it correctly.</p>

<p>"Yes. He's off to the Arctic for a year. The year's nearly up,
but as he wanted such a high rental, the place has been on our
hands all the time. A week ago, we got a note from him, which had
evidently been months on the way, authorizing me to let it for
whatever I could get for it. But by now, there's only a bare six
weeks or so left. It's a beautiful old house. Angelica Kaufmann
lived in it. Reynolds painted one of the ceilings, or may have
done so&mdash;"</p>

<p>He saw Haliburton sit up with sudden interest, his large clear
eyes fastened on Moy. Moy knew why and nodded to himself with an
inward grin. The fish was rising.</p>

<p>"Of course, it's hardly ever that a house of that kind is to
be had furnished for a bit over a month, five weeks to be exact.
As a rule, I could do nothing with so short a time, but I
happened to speak of it to Frederick Ingram yesterday morning."
More interest in Haliburton's steady gaze. Even Tark of the
impassive features seemed to be listening very intently. "Yes, I
mentioned it to Fred Ingram yesterday. His brother Charles and
he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Half-brother," corrected Haliburton in a tone as though the
detail mattered.</p>

<p>"&mdash;half-brother, then," Moy corrected, "are also clients
of ours. We handle their father's estate."</p>

<p>"If you're going to take Frederick Ingram as a lessee!"
Haliburton spoke with a contempt at variance with his usual
placidity.</p>

<p>"Hardly!" Moy's tone matched the other's. "No, he doesn't come
in to this except as the originator of the proposal, which is
this: Miss Pratt, it seems, wants tremendously to stay in town in
a really old house with genuine period furnishings, and, though
the Tall House is shabby enough inside and out, it contains some
magnificent old stuff. Entailed, of course, or it wouldn't be
there. Well, bearing this in mind about Miss Pratt, Freddie
wondered if his brother wouldn't like to take the house on for
the few remaining weeks."</p>

<p>Haliburton's face flushed.</p>

<p>"But Ingram turned it down when I dropped in last evening,"
Moy went on, and Haliburton's flush died away.</p>

<p>"He thought it would be beyond him. It's not merely the rent,
it's the servants, and all that sort of thing. Well, that seemed
that, but this morning Frederick had another brain wave. The new
idea is to form a sort of syndicate among ourselves, five of us,
and each take the house and run it for a week. Mrs. Pratt and her
daughter being the guests of each host in turn. Charles Ingram is
quite keen on this amended form. He will be one of the five; a
friend of his, Gilmour, who shares a flat with him at Harrow,
will make two; I come in as third&mdash;my humble tenement is in
the hands of the plumbers at the moment, and I assure you I shall
be thankful not to dance to any more of their piping for a while.
Ingram at once suggested my asking you to be the fourth host, and
any friend whom you liked to nominate could be the fifth. That
would make you and him all square, he seems to think."</p>

<p>"That's very decent of Ingram," Haliburton said warmly. "Of
course, I accept with pleasure. And Tark, here, will come as the
fifth man, I know. He's keen on getting to know Ingram better,
since reading one of his books."</p>

<p>Tark's affirmative came at once. He moved for a moment so that
the light fell full on him, and Moy thought again how
unprepossessing his face was, with its narrow lips slightly
askew, its narrow-bridged nose just off the true, and its narrow
dark eyes that never seemed to dance or sparkle. But his lips
were parted now as though he were breathing fast. Moy was
surprised. That Haliburton should be interested, he could
understand, or rather he had firmly expected, for he and Charles
Ingram were suitors for the hand of Winnie Pratt, but that Tark
should be stirred...he had had an almost wolfish look for a
second...Fortunately Haliburton was vouching for him, otherwise
Moy would never have let him come in. But at any rate, he, Moy,
could now tell Ingram that the syndicate was complete. Just like
chivalrous Ingram to have practically insisted that his rival
should have an equal chance with himself. Probably by the end of
the five weeks Miss Pratt would have made up her mind which of
the two men she preferred. Haliburton had been prime favorite
till a month ago, when Ingram had first met her, and had seemed
to score with his talk of books and plays. Ingram was a highbrow,
a writer of scientific books himself. Mathematics was his
especial line, but he was a man of broad literary interests. Mrs.
Pratt openly favored Haliburton, but then Haliburton's rent roll
explained that, and in time he would succeed his shipping
grandfather in the peerage. Moy was looking forward to the five
weeks. He certainly ought to get good material for his play out
of it. Take Winnie Pratt for instance...a lovely young thing,
complexion all cream and roses. But with no character that one
could get hold of, how could one catch her wonderful charm?</p>

<p>Tark was speaking again. Moy felt as though the man's vocal
chords must creak with the unaccustomed work.</p>

<p>"Ingram's book on <i>Ciphers Past and Present</i> is
positively monumental." He spoke with slow heavy emphasis.</p>

<p>Moy did not know whether Tark's praise referred to quantity or
quality, but he nodded a cheerful assent.</p>

<p>"I take the first week, beginning next Friday," he told them.
"So as to get things rolling smoothly."</p>

<p>"Friday!" broke in Tark, "why not Thursday or Saturday?"</p>

<p>Moy thought he was joking, but the wooden features did not
show any indication of it being a jest. On the contrary, Tark
repeated his question.</p>

<p>"It fitted in better," Moy said rather vaguely.</p>

<p>"He's superstitious as a cat," Haliburton said.</p>

<p>Moy burst out laughing. "You mean nervous&mdash;" and he
laughed again, for any one less nervous&mdash;if looks could be
relied on&mdash;than Tark, he had yet to see.</p>

<p>"Well, he's superstitious as a Solomon Islander, then,"
Haliburton amended. "That's because he's not a fatalist. But go
on, Moy, you're going to take the first week&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suggested that Ingram should take the second, but he
thought you and he should toss for it."</p>

<p>"Certainly not! Of course Ingram must take the second week,"
Haliburton said definitely. "Any week after his will suit me. And
I'll take one day less or more, Tark, so as 'to throw your week,
when it comes, on to the most auspicious moment."</p>

<p>Moy reflected how easy it was to work with pleasant chaps like
Ingram and Haliburton.</p>

<p>"All right, then, you take the third week&mdash;" he was
jotting notes down as he spoke, "shall we put Gilmour in for the
fourth, and Tark here for the fifth?"</p>

<p>But Haliburton suggested that as Tark seemed so fussy over
days&mdash;his smile rid the words of all offense&mdash;perhaps
it would be better for Gilmour to take the third week, which
would bring his, Haliburton's, week and Tark's together at the
end, when days could be added or omitted as preferred. It was
settled like that, and Moy stayed a few minutes more to explain
how he had arranged about servants&mdash;which was why it would
have been very awkward to alter the date of taking over the
house. Another client of his firm's had given her servants a
holiday on board wages and had been groaning at the expense. He
had wired her a suggestion that he could get them a five weeks'
engagement <i>en bloc</i>, to which she had agreed with
alacrity.</p>

<p>The servants, too, partly unable to help themselves, and
partly taken with the idea of handsome tips, had agreed to start
work this coming Friday if so requested by Moy. Everything
promised to go without a hitch. He would be treasurer. Any man
could invite any friends he wanted during his week, but Moy hoped
that only the bedrooms on one of the floors would be used, as he
wanted no trouble with the maids. The house had a couple of
full-size lawn tennis courts behind it, and day-time friends of any,
or all, of the five would be welcome. As for evening
entertainments, he, Moy, would give an opening dance, and a dance
would close the last of the five weeks, otherwise, again
remembering the servants, the hosts would do their entertaining
outside the house.</p>

<p>Moy left, after the two had signed a simple preliminary
agreement. Haliburton turned to Tark when the young solicitor had
hurried out to his little car.</p>

<p>"I had no idea until you told me, that you were interested in
Ingram's line of work." Haliburton looked at his companion with
friendly curiosity as they sauntered back to their table in the
lounge.</p>

<p>"Numbers, the science of numbers, has always fascinated me."
Tark was unresponsive as always, yet now there was something in
the dark depths of his eyes like slumbering fire. "More so even
than ciphers, and they're fascinating enough."</p>

<p>There were those who hinted that Tark was getting full payment
out of Haliburton for having dived in and held up the other's
unconscious body, but if so, his manners were certainly not those
of a climber. He gave the impression of disliking everyone at
first sight. Even Haliburton at times wished that someone else
had saved his life.</p>

<p>Moy drove on to Harrow, where Ingram and Gilmour shared the
ground floor of a pleasant rambling house. It was emphatically
the flat of two young men who were workers. Ingram, as has been
said, wrote on more or less mathematical subjects. Gilmour was a
Civil Service First Division clerk. Both young men lived well
within their means. At the moment, Moy found Frederick Ingram
with his half-brother in the latter's book-lined writing-room.
Frederick had dropped in to ask about some doubtful figures in an
equation, he explained. Moy knew that he had gone in for that
sort of thing during his short and inglorious career at Oxford,
and also knew that the elder Ingram was giving him some
proof-reading to do for him. But proof-reading would hardly explain
the look on Frederick's face as he brushed past the solicitor, his
beetling black brows knitted, his small, but thick-lipped, mouth
set. And even in the room, usually so devoid of all stir, there
was something that suggested a clash of personalities still in
the air. Ingram himself had a firm will. He looked as much. His
was a handsome face with its scholar's brow and deep-set
passionate eyes with their direct gaze. A humorous mouth, a
rather forbiddingly high-bridged nose, and a resolute jaw.</p>

<p>He now pushed some books away, and stretched himself as though
he too had felt the tension, and was glad to relax.</p>

<p>"Gilmour out?" Moy asked after shaking hands and accepting a
glass of light Australian wine. He learned that Gilmour was in
his own den. So into the lounge Moy and his host now went. A door
opened.</p>

<p>"Frederick gone?" Gilmour asked in a defensive voice,
apparently prepared to shut the door instantly on a negative
reply.</p>

<p>"Yes, some of my figures puzzled him," Ingram said slowly, and
with a sigh of vexation, or weariness that could hardly be
connected with figures.</p>

<p>His telephone rang, and he stepped back into his room.</p>

<p>"Figures of some sort are always the explanations of a fall
from Frederick," Gilmour said under his breath, as Ingram closed
his door. Moy grinned. None knew better than he how involved the
financial affairs of the younger Ingram were, and he strongly
suspected that Ingram had given him some work to do merely as an
excuse for helping him out with money, though he claimed to have
found Frederick unexpectedly careful and good at the job.</p>

<p>Ingram now came back, and the three discussed the taking over
of The Tall House. Ingram was vastly entertained at the idea. He
had an engagement, however, and had to hurry off, leaving Gilmour
and Moy to finish working out the details on paper.</p>

<p>"I hope he'll get his money's worth," Moy said as they
finished. "A rather vulgar way of putting it. But I hope Ingram
won't be let down."</p>

<p>"You mean Miss Pratt?" Gilmour slanted his head on one side
and looked doubtful. He was a smallish man, very good at games.
He was not, and did not look, clever, but he did look
companionable and cheery, which was all that was necessary in a
stable companion of Ingram's, Moy reflected. The mathematician
had brains enough for any two.</p>

<p>Moy now grunted that he did mean Miss Pratt.</p>

<p>"If she's any judge of character, she'll take Ingram and be
thankful," Gilmour said warmly.</p>

<p>"Haliburton's a nice chap too," Moy reminded him a trifle
impishly. He found himself looking forward to the coming five
weeks at The Tall House from its sheer human interest. A lovely
girl, two honest men in love with her...what more could any
future dramatist hope to find laid out before him? Whom would she
choose? Ingram had fame and sufficient means to live in quiet
comfort. Haliburton could offer splendor and a title later on.
Which would Winnie Pratt take?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER 2</h2>

<p class="first">"WHY do you dislike me so?" Winnie Pratt smiled
up at the young man beside her. Most young men would have been
overcome with joy, for Miss Pratt made a lovely picture as she
stood on the lawn of The Tall House in a white muslin frock with
a soft green sash and a large hat. Her flower-like little face
just now wore a bewildered, hurt expression that her delicately
aligned eyebrows emphasized.</p>

<p>Gilmour laughed awkwardly. "Have I been rude, Miss Pratt? If
so, it's only because I'm not accustomed to such visions of
loveliness. I'm grown into a dull old hack." Now Lawrence Gilmour
did look rather dull, but he was distinctly not old, and he was
quite unusually good-looking in a fresh-faced, ruddy, rather
countrified way.</p>

<p>"Is he a dull old hack?" she asked Moy, who was passing them
at the moment.</p>

<p>"Do you want a standing opinion?" he asked with affected
seriousness.</p>

<p>"If it's not too expensive," Miss Pratt returned, smiling at
him.</p>

<p>"Nothing is too expensive for you!" he retorted with mock
devotion. "Then merely as an opinion for the purpose of the
discussion, and subject to the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Help! Let me escape!" Gilmour edged away with mock fright,
but with genuine eagerness, and walked back into the house.</p>

<p>"There!" Winnie waved a hand after him, "tell me, Mr. Moy, why
he avoids me so. It&mdash;it's&mdash;most&mdash;" She seemed at a
loss for a word.</p>

<p>"Unusual," Moy finished, laughing. She laughed too. But there
was vexation in her lovely eyes. "It's so noticeable," she
persisted petulantly.</p>

<p>Moy refused to take her seriously. "The absence of one
worshiper among the multitude? Surely not!" But he went after
Gilmour.</p>

<p>He found him in the square hall of the house drinking lemon
squash.</p>

<p>"Look here," Moy began at once, "why make yourself
conspicuous, old man?"</p>

<p>"In what way?" Gilmour's tone was wary.</p>

<p>"By insisting so markedly on having nothing to do with Miss
Pratt," Moy finished. "What's wrong with meeting a lovely young
thing half way? Most men would give half their fortune to be in
your shoes."</p>

<p>"I'll do a deal with them, instantly!" Gilmour grinned back.
"I loathe the girl, Moy, and that's the truth."</p>

<p>Moy stared at him. Yet he looked in earnest. But of course
this was just a joke.</p>

<p>"Because of her cadaverous and withered appearance, I
suppose," Moy asked. Even Gilmour laughed at that question.</p>

<p>"I know it sounds mad," Gilmour was speaking a little under
his breath, slowly and very gravely. "She's infernally pretty.
And yet&mdash;" He hesitated. "Oh, well, put it down to my not
wanting to make a fool of myself&mdash;just now. Oh, damn, there
she comes again!" And catching sight of a flicker of white
muslin, he once more fled, this time into a farther room.</p>

<p>Moy's lips twitched as he watched him. From where he stood, he
could see that the white muslin belonged to Mrs. Pratt, not to
the daughter. He himself went back into the garden again, but he
did not make for Miss. Pratt. Winnie was not for any solicitor.
He wondered with a moment's amusement how Mrs. Pratt would take
it if he entered the lists too. For Mrs. Pratt considered that
Haliburton was the only possible choice for her beautiful
daughter. Unfortunately Winnie, like many another spoiled beauty,
seemed on her arrival at The Tall House to have suddenly set her
heart on what apparently she was not to have, and that was
Gilmour. He was evidently anchored elsewhere, Moy reflected. No
man whose heart was free could withstand those smiles. Gilmour
had been about to say as much just now. What did perplex Moy was
the extraordinary fact of Gilmour's dislike of the girl, his
almost open hostility to her. It was all really more amusing to
watch and speculate over than he had expected. And few things in
life are that. He was, of course, prepared to see the
Haliburton-Ingram silent, well-mannered duel continue, but he had
never hoped to see Miss Pratt fairly throw herself at the head of a
third man, who would try his best to throw the enchantress back
again. He wondered how Haliburton and Ingram liked it.</p>

<p>Fortunately they were such pleasant fellows, both of them, and
Miss Pratt's attack was simply an acute form of wanting what she
was not going to get, which would cure itself in time. Luckily it
was Gilmour and not Frederick Ingram whom she had suddenly
decided to capture. Frederick Ingram professed himself one of her
victims, but Winnie refused even to look at him; which was as
well, for Frederick was an utter waster. It was said that even
Ingram had been so stirred by the cheek of Frederick daring to
lift his eyes to the Beauty, that he had told him not to come
near The Tall House while she was there. Moy watched Ingram for a
moment, reflecting on the oddity that the scholar should be so
captivated by a featherhead. Moy was still of an age to put a
value on cleverness in women which he would not do in later
years. Yes, he vowed to himself, Miss Pratt would be difficult to
put in a play...apart from her beauty, there seemed so little to
get hold of...Then how, in a play, to make it clear why two
sensible young men were ready to count a day well lost if it
brought them but one smile from her?</p>

<p><br> <br> Haliburton came out of the house again, and stood a
moment watching Ingram play. As a rule he was well worth
attention. Turning his head, Haliburton saw that Tark was also
watching the game.</p>

<p>"Had your talk with him yet?" he asked pleasantly. Tark
started as though he had not noticed that anyone stood beside
him.</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"I heard you talking to someone in the house just now. It
sounded like Frederick Ingram. He isn't here, surely?"</p>

<p>Tark did not reply.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you knew him," Haliburton went on.</p>

<p>"I met him abroad," came the casual reply. Moy thought again
how his voice suggested lack of use. Yet the man did not look an
anchorite. Or did he? Moy, for one, had a feeling as though Tark
lived in a cell&mdash;windowless, doorless, dark and utterly
lonely.</p>

<p>"Probably through no fault of your own," Haliburton said
excusingly.</p>

<p>Tark gave the half-smile, half-sneer that was his nearest to
showing merriment.</p>

<p>"I didn't realize that he was a brother of the mathematician
Ingram. By the way, isn't he coming to stay here at the house
too?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," was the instant rejoinder. "I believe Ingram
has taken him on in a sort of semi-demi-secretarial position, but
neither he nor Gilmour are fond of Frederick. Like most people."
And with that Haliburton seemed to lose himself in the game
again.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Ingram's play!" he ejaculated after
another moment.</p>

<p>"Miss Pratt," came the reply. Haliburton's eyes, following the
other's, now saw Gilmour walking stolidly along, his eyes on the
grass, like a worried owner thinking of re-turfing, and beside
him, her face turned up to his downbent one, which did not even
glance at her, pattered the little white shoes of Miss Pratt.</p>

<p>Haliburton frowned and watched Ingram serve another fault.</p>

<p>"Women always want what they can't get," Haliburton said at
length, and for once his good nature sounded a trifle forced.
"Miss Pratt has all the rest of us at her feet, and just because
Gilmour holds out, she means to have his scalp."</p>

<p>Moy came closer. He overheard the words. "She's a dreadful
flirt," he threw in lightly. Moy wanted to hear what Haliburton
would reply. Motives and cross currents, just now, were to Moy
what rats are to a terrier. He could not pass them by.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't call her a flirt," Haliburton said uneasily.</p>

<p>Moy laughed at him.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't call her anything but perfection." Haliburton
reddened. He had a trick of that.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," he spoke awkwardly, "I don't mind owning
that I wish she would stop trying to sweep Gilmour off his feet.
There's no harm in her trying, of course, but&mdash;" He stopped,
not quite sure how he intended to finish the sentence.</p>

<p>"She'll soon tire of her effort," Moy now said soothingly, and
in silence the three watched Ingram miss a ball that he could
have caught with his eyes shut had he been his usual nimble-footed
self. He won in the end, it was true, but the games he had
lost he had given away. He now made for Miss Pratt, and Gilmour
at once stepped back, waving them towards the house for drinks.
Miss Pratt would have lingered, but Gilmour fairly swept them on
their path and stood smiling a little as they went.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pratt touched his arm. She, too, was smiling, but her
eyes were not gay.</p>

<p>"A word with you, Mr. Gilmour. Suppose we have a look at the
malmaisons?" They turned a corner of the artificially intricate
little garden. It cut them off from the courts. As they stood
before the flowers she went on:</p>

<p>"Mr. Gilmour, I think I must speak plainly to you."</p>

<p>"By all means." His sunburned face smiled encouragingly down
into her worn one. Mrs. Pratt had been as lovely as Winnie in her
day, but no one would have guessed it now.</p>

<p>"I want you to stop throwing my daughter at Mr. Ingram's
head." She lifted her chin as she spoke and looked him straight
in the eyes. For the first time, Gilmour really noticed her. He
saw energy and will power in that face&mdash;qualities that he
always admired. He saw more&mdash;the determination that makes
things come to pass&mdash;another of his own likings.</p>

<p>"I don't agree with your way of putting it," he said now,
quietly, "but if you mean, that because Ingram is my friend, I
want him to have the girl he loves, you're right. I do. He'll
make her a splendid husband. Any mother could hand her daughter
to Charles Ingram with confidence. I've known him for years, and
I assure you that he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She made an impatient snap with the fingers that hung down at
her side.</p>

<p>"Winnie is going to marry Mr. Haliburton. That was why I got
out of all our other engagements to come here for this month. But
your friend, Mr. Ingram, is quite another matter. I do not think
she would be happy with him."</p>

<p>He looked his dissent.</p>

<p>"Please, Mr. Gilmour," the mother said to that, "please don't
try to encourage your friend. He hasn't a hope of marrying her.
She really does love Mr. Haliburton. She told me as much
herself."</p>

<p>"When?" he asked skeptically. "Months ago? But that's over, or
nearly over."</p>

<p>"Winnie's affections have a way of circling round," the
mother, too, spoke a trifle dryly. There was a short silence.</p>

<p>"As for your own conduct," she went on frankly, "it's
splendid. But then, you're a born realist."</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I mean by that, a person who goes for the substance and not
for the shadow. Winnie is born to go for shadows. You have the
good sense and cleverness to know that she's only making a fuss
over you in order to tease poor Basil Haliburton."</p>

<p>Gilmour liked being thought clever. "Is that it?" he asked. He
looked genuinely relieved&mdash;and was.</p>

<p>"It makes it damned awkward for me sometimes," he said
honestly. "I wish she wouldn't!"</p>

<p>For a second the mother's eyes flashed. And Mrs. Pratt's eyes
could shoot fire on occasions, he saw to his surprise.</p>

<p>"You're the first man who has ever complained about it," she
said, and he grinned at once placatingly and ruefully.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose I would either, but for&mdash;" He hesitated.
"I'm giving you confidence for confidence, Mrs. Pratt. There's a
certain girl whom I hope very much will some day be my wife. I
want her to come up to The Tall House for a couple of
days&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's just what I told Winnie!" she said almost jubilantly.
"I felt sure there was something like that. I do congratulate
you, Mr. Gilmour. What's her name?"</p>

<p>"Alfreda Longstaff. But it's not settled&mdash;unfortunately.
It's only a hope," he put in hastily.</p>

<p>"Do have her up here," she begged. "I'll chaperone her with
pleasure. But now to come back to my first, my only grievance,"
she smiled at him now with genuine kindliness, "please don't try
to wreck your friend's life&mdash;for if he were really to fall
in love with my daughter, it would be such a pity!"</p>

<p>"It's too late to say that," Gilmour replied gravely. "He is
deeply in love with her."</p>

<p>"He'll have to get over it," she said bruskly.</p>

<p>"I still don't see why he should have to." Gilmour's face was
that of a man who would not easily give up his chosen path. "I
don't in the least see why he should."</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the change in Mrs. Pratt's look. For a
second she stood pressing her lips together, then she said
slowly:</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Haliburton strike you as a man of unlimited
patience? He doesn't me."</p>

<p>"He's very good-natured..." he began vaguely. Gilmour hardly
knew Haliburton.</p>

<p>"He has that reputation," Mrs. Pratt threw in,
"but&mdash;well&mdash;I doubt his standing much nonsense. He's
not been accustomed to it. Besides, why should he? And if he let
Winnie go&mdash;" Her face seemed to grow pinched at the mere
words. "No, listen!" she said imperiously, "I'll be quite frank.
I'm living on my capital. I was a wealthy girl myself, and
married a man who was believed to be well off. So he was&mdash;so
we both were for a time. But we were both extravagant, and when
he died I found that even his insurance had been mortgaged. I was
left to struggle along with Winnie as best I could, for we
neither of us had any relations. Bit by bit my capital has been
eaten into, until&mdash;well, I can't keep the flag flying much
longer. Now Basil Haliburton at the moment would settle half the
world on Winnie. And she loves him. In reality." The last two
words came defiantly. "Anything else is just play. I want the
affair settled when we leave here. And so it will be if you head
off your friend."</p>

<p>"But he's quite well to do," Gilmour urged.</p>

<p>"Not as Mr. Haliburton is!" was the unanswerable reply. "Let
alone as well off as Basil will be when his grandfather
dies."</p>

<p>"I know he has big expectations," Gilmour agreed, "but I
assure you that Ingram's means&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are not the kind that I want for Winnie," snapped Mrs.
Pratt.</p>

<p>"But perhaps the kind that she wants for herself," came the
reply with a smile that Mrs. Pratt called "positively fiendish"
in its impudence.</p>

<p>"It's no good, Mrs. Pratt. I'm backing my friend to win."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I've endured what I have to be thwarted
now&mdash;when the struggle is nearly over?" Her tone startled
him by its intensity. He saw that he had gone too far.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mrs. Pratt," he spoke in a more conciliatory tone,
"give Ingram a trial. You talk as though he were a pauper. He's
anything but."</p>

<p>Again came that snap of her fingers at her side, and suddenly
Gilmour guessed&mdash;rightly&mdash;that Mrs. Pratt had borrowed
money on the strength of her daughter's coming engagement to
Haliburton. But she only gave him a rather fierce look and moved
away. Gilmour looked after her ruefully. He very much disliked
unpleasantness.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Pratt seemed peeved with me&mdash;just like you," he
said under his breath to Moy.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder. You're a sort of involuntary dog-in-the-manger.
And she looks a good hater."</p>

<p>"Well, if my corpse is found some fine day lying in the tool
shed, you'll know where to look," and Gilmour broke off to watch
with open pleasure Ingram capture Miss Pratt and lead her off to
the house under the plea of some books having come from
Hatchett's and wanting her help to choose a couple for his
sister's children.</p>

<p>Ingram led the way into the library which had been handed over
to him for his exclusive use all the more absolutely in that no
one else wanted it. He was the only member of the five who had to
continue his work at The Tall House itself, and it evidently was
work that admitted of no putting off. During the day and early
evening he might&mdash;and did&mdash;dance attendance on Winnie
Pratt, but from ten onwards every night he shut himself into the
library and let nothing disturb him. Sometimes it was long past
midnight when he went up to his rooms. No one at the house got up
early. Moy talked as though he let the milkman in on his way to
his office in Lincoln's Inn, but a quarter to ten was the
earliest that ever saw him running down the steps to his little
car. At half-past nine Gilmour would have started for the tube.
Half-past ten saw Haliburton off the premises. Moy sometimes
thought that it was because Ingram could be with Winnie so many
hours of the day, that he left suppers and the evenings to
Haliburton. Certainly as far as the two men were concerned, the
balance seemed only too even. Whichever one was with her appeared
to be the favored man.</p>

<p>In the library she carefully selected the books whose bindings
pleased her the best, and then stayed on listening to Ingram's
eager words about the popular book he was planning on the
arithmetical aspect of the universe. He was a charming talker
and, as she listened, as she watched his rapt eyes, something of
the fascination which he could exert over her came back again. No
one but Ingram ever talked to Winnie as though she had a brain.
He appealed to it, and Winnie's intelligence struggled forward to
meet the appeal. Perhaps, too, something was due to Gilmour's
flat refusal to be led on her string. At any rate, for the time
being, Ingram regained something of his old ascendency over her.
There had been a week or two when he had entirely eclipsed
Haliburton.</p>

<p>That young man now strolled in and joined in the chat. He
seemed genuinely interested in Ingram's talk and gave a little
sigh when Winnie drifted out again in answer to Mrs. Pratt's
urgent reminder that she and her daughter were due at a friend's
cocktail party.</p>

<p>When she was gone Haliburton would have lingered, but Ingram
made it clear that he wanted to write a few pages before the post
left. As a rule he let no one inside his writing-room. By sheer
personality he had established a sort of frozen line at the door
across which no one stepped uninvited. The door had stood open
just now and the room had been free to anyone who cared to step
in, but, with the going of Winnie, Ingram changed, as he was wont
to change, at his desk. For one thing he seemed to grow years
older, for another he tolerated no time-wasters.</p>

<p>Moy was certain that Ingram often locked himself in. He had an
idea that the scientist was working against time, or at least
working on something where time counted. And apparently that
something was to be kept a dead secret until publication.
Ciphers, probably, he thought. Once he had heard a sound he knew
well enough, the clang of the lid of a deed box and the turning
of a key. That was just before Ingram had hurried out to join the
others. Evidently Ingram kept his ideas well safeguarded.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER 3</h2>

<p class="first">ALFREDA LONGSTAFF was not happy, and did not
look it. But there were possibilities in her pale, dark face. She
looked the kind to break records, had she the chance, behind a
wheel, or in a 'plane. If so, Fate had not given her much of a
hand to play, so far. Alfreda was the only child of the rector of
Bispham, and was expected to keep house for her father and
mother. She rebelled, naturally, but as no money was forthcoming
for any training that would enable her to earn her own living,
she had rebelled in vain&mdash;though by no means in silence, or
in secret. But this last spring she had hoped for a release.
Chance had brought down to Bispham a young man whose good looks
attracted her immensely. She thought that he cared, too...he had
come to the rectory in the first place because he heard that the
rector played a good game of chess&mdash;as he did&mdash;but
after that Alfreda had flattered herself that Lawrence Gilmour
came because of her. He was the only marriageable man of good
position and of her own age who had come into her life so far.
Alfreda went all out for his capture. He liked games&mdash;well,
she had a one figure handicap and a magnificent service, and
gradually the links and the lawn tennis courts seemed to oust the
chess board. She had shown her hand quite openly, sure of her
prize. But he had gone away with only the usual civil partings.
Flowers and a box of chocolates had come&mdash;once. That was
over a month ago&mdash;a month of the village's open and
concealed amusement or pity.</p>

<p>She was thinking of Gilmour today, when the secretary of the
golf club asked her to play a round with a London man whose
partner had failed to turn up, as had Alfreda's. Men met on the
links meant little, she had found, and this one wore a wedding
ring. He had a clever face, she thought, and decided, with one of
her inward sighs, that he had not lived all his life in Bispham,
or he would never look like that. The rector's wife had just been
rebuking her daughter that morning because the sugar basins had
not been properly filled. Alfreda was expected to see to this.
What a life, or rather what a death! thought Alfreda.</p>

<p>She never played better, and Warner, the man from town, was
two down at the ninth hole.</p>

<p>"You ought to give me a stroke a hole," he said with a smile,
"but then, I'm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say you're feeling ill!" she interrupted almost
fiercely.</p>

<p>"Feeling ill?" he repeated wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Whenever I beat a man, he's 'got a touch of liver,'" came the
retort, "or he's 'coming down with the 'flu.' Or he's 'most
fearfully knocked with the heat,', or his 'wrist is wonky,' or
'one of his knees is giving him trouble again.' It's the aim of
my life to live long enough to beat a really well man."</p>

<p>Warner burst out laughing. "So a grouch against the world was
steeling those wrists," he said placatingly. "Let's have a rest
and a talk. You've got me sunk already." He held out his
cigarette case.</p>

<p>"But haven't you come down for a game?" She hesitated, taking
one.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "For quiet."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" She sat so as to face him, her lip curling.
"Fancy coming for quiet! Fancy wanting the stuff! Well, you've
chosen the right tomb."</p>

<p>"So that's the trouble," he murmured in a kindly tone, "ah,
yes, you're straining at your bonds. We all do&mdash;did. I'm not
sure&mdash;-"</p>

<p>"Don't tell me that you aren't sure we're not happier when
toddling round in pinafores, or lisping our prayers at mother's
knee than when sitting on the Woolsack, or hobbling into the
House of Lords," she interrupted again, even more hotly than
before.</p>

<p>Warner eyed her. He felt a bit sorry for mother. This young
lady looked as though she might have an awful temper. There was
frustration in her face&mdash;and bitterness. She was quite
handsome in a hard, clear-cut way. He was not attracted to her.
But she had arresting eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm on a newspaper," he said simply, "and naturally the idea
of quiet appeals."</p>

<p>"On a newspaper!" She drew a long breath, and almost choked
herself with her cigarette. "Heavenly job!"</p>

<p>"Hardly." His eyes twinkled. "Interesting, if you like. But
hardly heavenly."</p>

<p>"What are you? An editor?" She regarded him with envy.</p>

<p>He nodded. "Something of that sort." He was a newspaper
proprietor.</p>

<p>"How does one get newspaper work?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"By writing clever articles," he said vaguely. Suddenly he saw
an abyss opening at his feet. "That is to say&mdash;for real
genius, that's the way," he corrected hastily.</p>

<p>"Oh, genius!" she said heavily. "But&mdash;had you genius?"
She spoke with an air of sincerity that took the rudeness out of
the question.</p>

<p>His shake of the head answered.</p>

<p>"I suppose you had a tremendous lot of determination," she
went on, looking thoughtfully at his shovel of a chin. "There's
nothing like a will of one's own for getting on, they say."</p>

<p>In Warner's case it had been a will of his uncle's that had
deposited him in one of the high places of the newspaper in
question. But he nodded. She, too, had a forceful jaw, he
thought.</p>

<p>"Tenacity of purpose is necessary, yes," he agreed. Then he
changed the subject of his own arrival on the mountain top by
saying, "But, besides genius, you know, the thing to do is to be
on the look-out for a scoop. By that&mdash;" Her ironic gaze told
him that even in Bispham that word was familiar.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there's not much chance of a scoop down here," she
said. "My father's sermons, and my mother's chats at meetings,
hardly lend themselves to that sort of thing. As for
crimes&mdash;well, it's true a policeman got drunk once, and we
still shudder at the tale, but that was years ago, when my father
was a boy. The only dramatic happening I remember was when a
woman lost her purse on the station platform, and I lent her half
a crown&mdash;all my worldly possessions. As it was in this part
of the world, she returned the money next day."</p>

<p>He laughed too. Then he tilted his cap further over his eyes
and said meditatively, "And yet, that's what first gave me my
taste for newspaper work, and set me on my feet&mdash;a scoop. A
body was found floating in the river. Well, it might have been
suicide. I worked it up into a three weeks front page thriller."
He spoke with pride.</p>

<p>"Was it suicide?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I believe it was." His tone implied that what it really was
did not figure in the balance sheet, except as enhancing the
credit of the decorations, "but it isn't the facts. It's the way
they're handled&mdash;treated."</p>

<p>"I see." She sat silent a moment. "But if nothing happens,
what does one do to get out of the rut? I should love newspaper
work," she finished, in a tone of fervor that was positively
alarming&mdash;to an editor.</p>

<p>Warner decided to go all out on the scoop theory of
advancement. He did not want a young female besieging him with
postal packets of manuscript which would probably have no return
stamps. He decided to be more wary.</p>

<p>"A scoop is really the only way," he repeated dogmatically.
"Something mysterious happens, or something that can be made to
look so."</p>

<p>"Here in Bispham?" Her tone was raillery itself, but she waved
to him to proceed.</p>

<p>"If you're the first in the field you can offer your stuff to
almost any newspaper and, later, you can possibly work into a
post on it. Now what about finishing the round?"</p>

<p>She played so badly that he knew her mind was wandering. It is
a curious fact, he reflected, that your mind may be on something
else, and you can do your work quite decently, but let your mind
wander ever so slightly at a game, and the game is ruined. Which
looks as if games were harder than work...a little third article
might be made out of the idea, treated humorously...</p>

<p>He thanked her when they were back at the clubhouse again, and
suggested cocktails. She declined. Her father expected her to be
home to pour out tea, but she spoke as though half dreaming. He
watched her long stride making for the gate with some
misgiving.</p>

<p>"I hope she won't murder the verger so as to qualify for a
post with me," he thought. "She looks capable-of a good
deal."</p>

<p>At the rectory, Alfreda came to a sudden halt in the shabby
old hall. Surely she knew that hat, that voice, and stepping
through on to the veranda there rose up before her the man whom
she had never expected to see again&mdash;Lawrence Gilmour. The
sun glinted on his brown hair and seemed to shine in his brown
eyes. Suddenly a wave of hatred passed over Alfreda such as she
had never dreamed that she could feel. He to stand there smiling,
after leaving her to the tender mercies of the village gossips!
For the first time she dared to realize how much she had
suffered. In pride, in dismay, in hopes lost, in the pity and the
scarcely veiled amusement of the countryside, and which of those
two last had been the harder to bear she could not tell. It all
welled up inside her now. Usually pale, there was a flush like a
soft rose in her thin cheeks, her lips were a vivid bow of color
unhelped by any cosmetics. Alfreda did not use cosmetics. They
were expensive, and what was the use&mdash;at Bispham? Her eyes
were sparkling as she looked into his.</p>

<p>"Alfreda!" he said, coming forward and taking her hand. "I
find that I can't get on without you. Have you missed me,
too?"</p>

<p>She could not speak. She dared not. Words were thronging
behind her clenched teeth which it would have been madness to
utter. She seemed to be standing outside herself, and she was
amazed at what she was watching. A shiver passed over her.
Alfreda closed her eyes, and as he put his arms about her, felt
as though she could have struck the face bending down to kiss
her, and struck it again and again. Hard.</p>

<p>"Why did you leave me?" she asked in a low whisper. "Because I
wanted to be sure. And to give you time to be sure too," he
replied gravely. "I am sure now. Will you marry me, darling?"</p>

<p>"No!" she said with a sort of shout, and then saw her mother
come into the room. Mrs. Longstaff jumped. "Alfreda! Mr.
Gilmour!"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Longstaff, I've come back to marry the dearest girl in
the world."</p>

<p>Mrs. Longstaff could not conceive of Alfreda in quite that
light.</p>

<p>"Indeed?" was all she could say for the moment, then came the
knowledge of all that this would mean. Only last week the
charwoman had ventured to speak pityingly of "Miss Freda" for
being so lonely. Her daughter well married...Gilmour was in the
Civil Service, and had ample pay...there would be no pension for
his wife, but he would, of course, carry a handsome life
insurance...</p>

<p>"My dear children," said Mrs. Longstaff and gave a hand to
each. Alfreda took it, and committed herself. After all, anything
was better than the life she had been leading&mdash;the life with
no outlook. Yet she felt for Gilmour only burning resentment. He
could have spared her all this, these wounds to her pride, and
yet he had not. She would never forgive him. But she would use
him. He should be her stepping-stone to something
different&mdash;larger. She told herself that she did not even
believe in his supposed affection for her. It had suited him to
play with her and leave her. It now suited him to come back to
her...what was he saying? He wanted her to come and spend a
fortnight in town at a big house in Chelsea which he and some
friends had taken furnished for a few weeks. There was a lady
staying there, a Mrs. Pratt, who would chaperone her. Perhaps
Mrs. Longstaff would ring her up on the 'phone, the number was
Flaxman 0000, and perhaps Alfreda would come back with him now,
his car could wait. He had really gone into the friendly
syndicate because he thought how heavenly it would be to have
Alfreda up in town, staying in what would be, for a week, his
house. He explained the idea to the two women, and Mrs. Longstaff
went to the telephone and was soon in talk with Mrs. Pratt.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pratt was charming. She had taken such a liking to young
Lawrence Gilmour, "a really delightful young man," and would be
very pleased to chaperone Miss Longstaff during her stay at The
Tall House. She hoped she could come soon. Her own daughter was
there too. In fact, another engagement was expected...the two
women chatted most pleasantly.</p>

<p>In the veranda Gilmour pleaded his cause.</p>

<p>"I thought, I hoped, I believed you felt as I did," he
stammered.</p>

<p>"And you shall suffer as I did!" was her unspoken addition.
Aloud she said, "I'll come to The Tall House for a fortnight
since you ask me, but I don't promise to marry you, you know. At
the end of the time I'll give you my answer."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" he begged. "Surely I've left you time enough to
know your own heart. Why, I brought you down this!" He opened a
small case and something inside it flashed. Alfreda, for the
first time, felt one of the bands of ice around her heart break
with a little splintering sound, like the girl in the fairy
tale...he must really love her to have bought her this...it was a
charming half-hoop of diamonds. For a second she wavered. A month
ago how she would have rejoiced. But four weeks of suffering
leave a scar...she closed the case with a snap, and returned it
to him.</p>

<p>"I'll give you my answer at the end of the fortnight," she
said quietly, "and meanwhile I'm to be quite free. I promise
nothing, except to come to town." Let him, too, feel the pleasure
of uncertainty. "Is that agreed?"</p>

<p>It was not in the least what he hoped and wanted. But
something in her tone warned him not to press her, unless he
wanted to lose her. As for Alfreda, suddenly she knew what she
wanted. She would go to town for the two weeks, and by hook or by
crook at the end of them land a job on a newspaper. As for
marriage&mdash;she had only wanted it as a key to open the world
outside Bispham. Perhaps she could open it for herself by
herself.</p>

<p>She refused to go back in his car with Gilmour, and her mother
upheld her in this. After all, tomorrow would do quite nicely and
one evening would give the two women and a seamstress time enough
to alter that frightful evening frock that Alfreda had ordered
from the sales because it was so cheap...So Gilmour went off
alone, but with the promise that Alfreda would come to town on
the following day in time for lunch. He had no doubt as to her
ultimate answer, and decided that it was only her girlish way of
paying him out for his delay in proposing, little dreaming how
exactly he had hit the nail on the head, and yet how he had given
it a slant quite off the true. He wanted to tell all the house-party
about her, and burst out with the news to Moy that evening
after dinner. They were playing billiards together.</p>

<p>"I can't keep it to myself!" Gilmour was playing wildly. "I've
as good as got engaged to the dearest girl in the world, and
she's coming here on a fortnight's visit. It's still Haliburton's
week, but he's an awfully understanding chap...I'm not worthy to
tie Alfreda's shoe-strings, but&mdash;well"&mdash;he gave a
choked little laugh, "she'll be here in time for lunch
tomorrow."</p>

<p>Moy was intensely interested. How would this Alfreda and the
lovely Winnie get on together? He hoped there would be no
unpleasantness. So far, things had been such a success. Even
Frederick Ingram's presence now and then had done no harm. He was
dropping in more frequently with papers for Charles, and would
sometimes stay and have a chat or even a bite with the house-party...
yes, he repeated to himself, everything was going on
splendidly. As for Haliburton's kindness in letting Gilmour ask
this girl up, Moy liked Haliburton, but in this instance he saw
no reason to fall over backwards because of his altruism. Ingram
too must be charmed with the notion, he thought. Just then the
door opened, and Ingram, looking anything but charmed, stepped
in.</p>

<p>"I heard voices, and thought my brother-in-law was here," he
explained. "Why do one's relations always want to see one?" he
asked in what might be assumed discomfort as he closed the door
on himself.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, if rumor is correct in the case of this
particular brother-in-law, it's because he hopes to touch Ingram
for a fiver," Gilmour suggested with a grin. Moy nodded
agreement. "What between Frederick and his brother-in-law Edward
Appleton, Ingram must have plenty of use for his spare cash."</p>

<p>"Yet he was once a first-class actor, I've been told," he
said.</p>

<p>"He's a first-class gambler now." Gilmour bent over the table
again. "The two don't see much of each other. I don't think
Appleton has been to the flat more than twice this year. Now, as
to Frederick, he'd live on Ingram's doorstep if he could. After
all, poor Appleton's no one's enemy but his own. Whereas
Frederick is a regular out-and-out wrong un."</p>

<p>"It was you who stopped Ingram from putting his money into
that silver-fox ranch, wasn't it?" Moy asked. "Ingram consulted
us, and, of course, we advised against it. But I rather thought
he would do it, until he mentioned next time that you'd shown him
regular proofs that it was all a clever swindle."</p>

<p>Gilmour's teeth flashed out of his tanned face for a second.
"I showed Frederick up proper, as the Tommies say, and enjoyed
it. Mind you, on paper the scheme was beautifully worked
out..."</p>

<p>"It was." Moy remembered it. "We only advised caution on
principle and Ingram refused to hear a word against it at first.
Frederick had pleaded with him for a chance to earn an honest
living, and Ingram thought if he could settle him in the wilds
of Scotland it would be cheap at any price."</p>

<p>"I hated to destroy his dreams of a future home without any
Frederick around the corner," Gilmour said sadly, "but I had to
do it."</p>

<p>"Did Frederick thank you for it?" Moy asked, grinning in his
turn.</p>

<p>"At any rate, he's not the kind to bear malice," Gilmour said
easily.</p>

<p>Moy raised his eyebrows. "Think so? For a couple of years, I
wouldn't go strolling along the edge of a volcano with him if I
were you. Nor play at who can stay down longest under water." But
he too was only chaffing and after a few more words about Miss
Longstaff, Gilmour went in search of Mrs. Pratt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ingram had found his brother-in-law. He shook hands,
with the look of a man steeling himself against
something&mdash;himself, or his visitor.</p>

<p>Appleton looked at him very sharply as their fingers touched.
Appleton had been a handsome man once, in a rather flamboyant
way, and he still carried himself well. But everything about him
twitched these days. His face was never still, and when for a
moment his features seemed to rest, he would fall to pinching his
ear or rubbing his nose with his thin, curved fingers. The hands
were those of a fever patient, one would say, so hollow were the
backs, so ridged and dry the nails.</p>

<p>He stood looking at the other, as though longing to plunge
into some all-absorbing subject of his own, and yet not quite
daring to do so. Ingram caught the glance and shook his head with
an almost apologetic smile.</p>

<p>"Don't let's talk of it, Edward, there's a good fellow. It's
far too dangerous a gift. My sister would never forgive me for
one thing. And now, what about cocktails? Will you have them in
here or in the garden?"</p>

<p>Appleton did not speak for a moment; he was standing with his
face turned to the fireplace, his back to Ingram. After a short
pause he said that he would rather stay where they were and, so
saying, he began to examine some of the prints on the walls. From
them he passed to the furniture. He seemed so appreciative of
both that Ingram, apparently anxious to make up for his very
definite refusal of something much wanted by the other, took him
upstairs, and showed him the floor on which his own bedroom
was.</p>

<p>Appleton seemed greatly interested. "I wonder if the chap who
owns these would be willing to sell anything," he murmured.
Ingram knew that Appleton often acted as intermediary in such
transactions. The one-time actor had long ago run through the
fortune left him and, except for his wife's steady income, his
household would have been in straights long ago. Ingram had
helped Appleton many a time, and would do so many a time more,
but not to any large amount. He had learned that that was
folly.</p>

<p>He did not feel at liberty to show him the inside of any of
the rooms except his own and Gilmour's, who, he knew, would not
mind all the world tramping through his quarters. As it was, the
two rooms and the corridor kept them quite a while, for Appleton
seemed to have a passion for trying to date furniture. He
suggested once or twice that his brother-in-law should leave him,
but Ingram assured him that at the moment he had the time to
spare. But at last he grew restive and frankly glanced at the
clock on the landing below them. Appleton caught the glance.
Ingram apologized. "I had no idea the time had flown so," he said
then. "As a matter of fact I am rather rushing some work to its
end&mdash;and to the printers. So if you really won't stop and
have a drink?..."</p>

<p>Appleton said that he too was rather in a hurry, and took
himself off, after insisting that Ingram should not come down
with him.</p>

<p>Moy happened to be coming down the stairs as Appleton was
shown out. In the shadowy recess of the landing sat Tark, his
head bent over his note-book. He seemed to have as much love for
figures as had Ingram. Whenever Moy ran across him, if he was by
himself, Tark would be writing in his rather large note-book what
looked like sets of figures. He would do this in the oddest
places, perched on the side of a tub, squatting on the stairs or
astride the window ledge. Wherever an idea struck him, if idea it
was, Tark would bring out his note-book and well-sharpened
pencil, and seem to lose the world for some few minutes. He never
appeared to be afraid of being overlooked, though, as far as Moy
knew, he never talked of what he was entering with such care.</p>

<p>As Appleton took his hat from the butler he turned and faced
the landing. At the same second Tark looked down to the front
door. The two men looked at one another. It was an odd look, Moy
thought, to pass between a couple of strangers, or mere
acquaintances. It was so straight and so long and so utterly
blank. Then the door closed behind Appleton and Tark, putting his
note-book away, ran lightly down the stairs into a little room on
the left of the front door. As it happened, Moy was on his way to
the room on the right, and there, thinking of Appleton and Tark
and that silent look, he glanced through the window netting.
Appleton was lighting a cigarette on the pavement. He was just
outside the window of the room where Tark was and, as he threw
away the match, he looked at it and shook his head with a quick
but decided shake, then he walked on. Moy told himself that
writing plays, or trying to write them, was bad for one's brain.
Appleton was always shaking his head or twitching his forehead or
whisking something invisible off his cheek. And as for Tark, his
indifference towards his fellow-men was quite real, Moy felt
certain, and went to the bone. It was no acquired armor. True, he
had seemed at first desirous of talking to Ingram, but that
desire was so patently not shared by the mathematician that Tark
seemed to have quite given up all attempts to have a word alone
with him, and now to include Ingram in his cold lack of
interest.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER 4</h2>

<p class="first">EVEN Tark looked quite alert, for him, next day
when he came to lunch. Gilmour and his fiance&mdash;for so the
household called her&mdash;had not yet come in. Mrs. Pratt was
radiant and chatting gaily to everyone. Winnie was silent, but
her cheeks glowed with so vivid a rose and the color faded so
noticeably as the minutes passed that Moy wondered whether Mrs.
Pratt had just slapped them. A slanderous thought. They were due
to firm applications of a sponge and hot water. When Winnie did
talk it was to Ingram, ignoring Haliburton.</p>

<p>Then the door opened and there fell an absolute hush as
Gilmour and a lithe, dark-haired, pale girl came in. Every eye
was riveted on Alfreda. Even Ingram who had heard her name
mentioned in connection with Gilmour some time ago, had never met
her, managed to be looking at the door. He was curious to see the
face that could eclipse the beauty of Winnie Pratt's. Miss
Longstaff stood a second half-smiling at the interest that met
her. It was an enigmatic smile, Moy thought. And a rather
enigmatic face. Perhaps that was what had attracted Gilmour, who
began to introduce her to Mrs. Pratt in a boyish way that was
very taking.</p>

<p>As for Ingram, he could hardly believe his eyes. He had known
beforehand that she would fall short of Winnie's standard, but
that this elfish, peaky-faced chit could keep a man from
realizing the loveliness of Winnie&mdash;why Gilmour must be
blind! Haliburton thought the same. Moy too was disappointed. Yet
he could see something, that, supposing it appealed to you, would
be found in Alfreda's face but not in Winnie's. For one thing
Miss Longstaff looked clever, he thought, also
discontented&mdash;or was it merely dissatisfied? She talked well
at lunch, with an air of doing so for her own amusement, not
merely to brighten the lives of others. Mrs. Pratt alone had
welcomed the newcomer warmly. As for her daughter, after one
swift glance at the other girl, she ignored her. Gilmour did not
seem even to remember Winnie's existence as he devoted himself to
the girl now seated beside him. Once when Gilmour got up to lay
her gloves aside for her, she followed his figure with a look
that intrigued Moy. There was not a spark of affection in that
glance, he would have said, only something coldly inquisitive.
She caught his own meditative look full, and in return fixed her
own dark, unfathomable stare on him. Neither seemed to wish to be
the first to look away. Then she finally turned her head aside to
Miss Pratt. Looking at the beautiful curve of the slightly
averted fair head there came into Alfreda's face a smile that
showed unexpectedly strong white teeth, and there was something
else, something sardonic, Moy fancied for an instant, before the
smile passed. Miss Pratt seemed to sense it too, for she looked
around swiftly, came to life, and began to chat and laugh, and
finally went off gaily with Alfreda for a trial on the tennis
court. There was no question as to who was the better player.
Miss Longstaff seemed to have tireless muscles. Moy, watching
with the other men, decided that she was playing Miss Pratt as
well as the game. She sent her merciless balls at merciless
angles and made a pace with which Winnie could not possibly cope.
But Winnie fought with unexpected pluck and grit. She did not let
any game go without a struggle. At the end, hopeless though it
was, she was playing better than at first, that mark of the good
fighter. One advantage she had. She looked like a child of
sixteen with her tumbled curls against her softly flushed little
face. It was wet with exertion, but it only looked like the dew
on a flower. Miss Longstaff showed no hint of color in her thin
pale cheeks, but she shot a glance at the other when the set was
over that looked vexed, Moy thought, and as though something had
not turned out quite as she meant it to. Fortunately Winnie took
it all with great dignity, Moy thought, until later when he went
into the hall to consult an A.B.C. on a side table. From a room
beside him a voice which he knew was Winnie's and yet which he
hardly recognized as hers.</p>

<p>She was saying: "I won't let her have him! It's no use,
mother. She shan't have him!"</p>

<p>"Haven't you got any pride?" came in withering tones from her
mother. At least Moy called the tones withering, but Winnie
survived. For she said still in that tense, desperate voice: "I
won't give him up to her! She doesn't love him. Oh, mother, if it
came to a test between us, he would see which of us really loved
him! A real test would soon prove&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't recognize you," Mrs. Pratt interrupted in a voice
that suggested a genuine difficulty to do this. "He doesn't care
for you. He loves this charming young girl."</p>

<p>"Young girl! She's old enough to be his m&mdash;well, she's
over thirty." Winnie had evidently realized that by no stretch of
dislike could Alfreda be Gilmour's mother.</p>

<p>"She's about three years older than you in years I fancy, my
dear, but a lot in sense," her mother replied. "The trouble with
you, Winnie, is that you're spoiled. You've always had what you
wanted, so you're tired of what you can get, and are hankering
after what you can't have. Let me tell you, my dear girl, there's
nothing more fatal to happiness in man or woman." Mrs. Pratt
spoke with real feeling. "The fox was wise who said the grapes he
couldn't have were sour. A fool would have set his heart on them
just because he couldn't have them. That's what you're
doing."</p>

<p>"I'm not! Lawrence Gilmour would love me if I only could show
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've shown him sufficiently, and everyone else too. Come,
Winnie, pull yourself together. Have some pride. Haliburton wants
to marry you. But if you keep this sort of thing up he won't feel
like that much longer. You ought to show Lawrence Gilmour that
though he may not care for you, others do." Mrs. Pratt's tactics
were too transparent to succeed, Moy feared. He himself at the
moment was no more conscious of the impropriety of listening than
if he had been at a theater.</p>

<p>"But I like Charles Ingram better." Miss Pratt sounded as
though she was smiling again. "And he too wants to marry me."</p>

<p>Moy had taken a step sideways and could now see into the room.
Mrs. Pratt's face startled him. She stood looking down on the
bent head of Winnie as the girl fiddled with something on the
mantel as though she could burst out into a perfect flame of
violence&mdash;vituperation&mdash;despair&mdash;pleading&mdash
;but by an effort that was patently all but beyond her, she bit
her lip in silence and led the way out through a farther
door.</p>

<p>Two mornings later, Alfreda told Gilmour that she would not be
able to go with him to a dog show as they had planned, or rather
as he had planned for her.</p>

<p>"I've got so much fitting-out to do," she said with one of her
unfriendly smiles, "and shan't be visible until one o'clock
today." She seemed to have an early morning appointment, for it
was only half-past eight when she left the house. She took some
care to see that she was not followed, rather an odd idea one
would have said, but she saw no one, and tests such as jumping on
to a bus at the last moment and off when all but started, which
reduced two conductors to close on apoplexy, assured her that no
one had any interest in her movements. That ascertained, she made
for a tube which landed her at Hammersmith Broadway. Here she
turned into a street that was once lived in by city men who
wanted the country. At a house with a black door and orange-painted
pillars, she ran up the steps, inserted a latch-key with
which she did not seem at all familiar, and finally let herself
into a hall. A woman in a rather elaborate frock for the morning
came forward with a mixture of graciousness and
condescension.</p>

<p>"Miss Gray, isn't it? Your room's all ready for you. But
wouldn't you like to write in the lounge? As I told you yesterday
afternoon when you took the room, no one will disturb you there,
only Mrs. Findlay ever uses it at this hour, and you'll find it
warm and cosy. Better than being in the basement, don't you
think?"</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully, I'll try it," Alfreda said brightly. And in a
corner of a glassed-in lounge she ensconced herself, writing-pad
on knee. But she did not write much. Her dark eyes flashed to and
fro about the main corridor which showed through the side of the
lounge. Presently the manageress entered with a big stout woman
of middle age, who wore a sort of mantilla of black lace on her
head fastened to her white hair in front with a large silver star
and floating below her waist at the back. Two corkscrew ringlets
dangled over each ear.</p>

<p>"This is Miss Gray." The manageress steered the older woman to
the newcomer's corner. "She's interested in disarmament too, Mrs.
Findlay, so I thought you and she would be congenial spirits."
And the manageress left them.</p>

<p>"Oh, do you care too?" Alfreda asked eagerly, scanning the
woman in front of her closely. "I didn't know anyone
cared&mdash;really. Anyone but myself and the man I'm engaged to,
Lawrence Gilmour."</p>

<p>"Lots of people care," Mrs. Findlay answered a trifle coldly.
She had rather a forbidding eye and jaw. The woman was one of
those people who are often pitied for being solitary, but who are
that by choice. True, she had outlived all her family, and was
practically alone in the world, but had she had a host of
relations the result would have been the same. Now, after a few
moments' silence, she made as if to go out again, but Alfreda
sprang up.</p>

<p>"Don't go!" she said appealingly. "I'm so frightfully pleased
to have met someone who can tell me about what we women can do.
The idea of all these war preparations is awful. Surely, if we
band together, we can be of some use."</p>

<p>Mrs. Findlay was conquered for the moment. This was her hobby,
or rather it was more than that. It was the window through which
her soul drew in a little air and light and so managed to exist
in the desert that she had made of the rest of her life. At first
reluctantly, then more freely, she let Alfreda draw her out on
the subject. Alfreda, for her part listened as though to a
Sibyl.</p>

<p>"Oh, I would like to join!" she breathed, when Mrs. Findlay
mentioned the Women's Peace Movement, of which she was an
honorary secretary. "So would Lawrence&mdash;Mr. Gilmour. I think
you must have seen him at some of the meetings&mdash;" and she
described Gilmour. Mrs. Findlay looked a trifle impatient. She
said that she had not seen any young man at any of their
meetings. Something quivered across Alfreda's face and was gone,
but whether she wanted to hear an affirmative, or the negative
that had been forthcoming, it was difficult to say.</p>

<p>At ten she put her papers together. "I write, you know," she
murmured. "Just little things of no account. But I might be able
to get in some article which would help."</p>

<p>This time it was Mrs. Findlay who looked eager and, on hearing
that Alfreda expected to be in the lounge on the following
morning at the same hour, said that she would like to continue
their talk. Alfreda put her blank paper away in the little
basement room that she had taken late yesterday afternoon and
hurried to the door. But the manageress stopped her.</p>

<p>"I saw you having quite a nice chat," she said pleasantly,
"and to no one else does Mrs. Findlay ever open her mouth. I told
her it would be a change for her to meet someone who shared her
interests. Generally she just sits there while her room is being
aired, and we daren't talk to her."</p>

<p>Alfreda nodded and hurried off, her face a mixture of
emotions; she jumped on a bus that would take her close to The
Tall House, satisfaction and dissatisfaction were to be read in
her quick, dark eyes. But at nine on the following day she was in
the lounge again, and again she and Mrs. Findlay talked of peace,
and of how to stop the preparations for war that were darkening
all the world.</p>

<p>The next morning after that Mrs. Findlay referred to some
books she had in her room, and Alfreda seemed so keen on seeing
them that, after a second's hesitation, she asked the younger
woman in to a large dreary bed-sitting-room as it is called. The
books in question were stacked on a table, and Alfreda promptly
took off the top one.</p>

<p>"May I take this home and read it?" she begged. "I'll bring it
back tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow a friend is coming to see me about this time," Mrs.
Findlay quid in her stiff way. "As a matter of fact he too has
just read that book."</p>

<p>"Can't I run in and hand it to you?" Alfreda asked, her face
all innocence.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid my friend is elderly, and has so few minutes to
spare, and counts too much on finding me alone," Mrs. Findlay
said coldly, and she remained very cool for the rest of the time
that Alfreda as usual spent with her, and when the girl left with
the book, rather earlier than usual, Mrs. Findlay stopped for a
word with the manageress in the hall.</p>

<p>"That Miss Gray who's just come seems rather a pushing young
person," was her remark. "I'm afraid she'd be quite a nuisance if
I weren't leaving next week. Please don't let her know I'm going;
she's quite capable of asking herself down to my cottage in the
country."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't breathe a word about your going," the manageress
assured her. Mrs. Findlay had the largest room in the house, had
taken it at a time when rents were at their highest, and,
therefore, paid nearly double what it would now bring. Besides,
she was leaving, she had just had an unexpected windfall, and the
manageress hoped that some parting present might brighten her own
none too gay lot.</p>

<p>"How did she come to speak to you about me in the first
place?" Mrs. Findlay asked.</p>

<p>"She came in just after you the other afternoon. She was
looking for a room, and after she had taken hers, we stood a
moment chatting, and she said she thought she had seen you at
Spiritualistic stances near here. I told her I didn't think that
at all likely."</p>

<p>"Preposterous!" chimed in Mrs. Findlay.</p>

<p>"She said something about the star you wear, and I told her
that was the Star of Peace, and that you were tremendously keen
on there being no more wars, and disarmament and so on...She
hardly let me finish, she was so eager to tell me that she and a
gentleman friend, a Mr. Gil&mdash;something, I think that was the
name, were both so keen on that too. She said she'd like ever so
much to have a chance of talking to you. That you looked so
clever she'd love to hear your views."</p>

<p>Mrs. Findlay's face relaxed.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, it was quite natural, under the
circumstances I mean, for you to have introduced her that first
morning...the truth is," Mrs. Findlay lowered her voice, "I
wondered if she had got on the track of that little money I came
into so unexpectedly the other day...it's to be paid me shortly
and I she stopped herself.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! No one knows about that! You said it was strictly
confidential!" the manageress assured her. "I do hope this Miss
Gray hasn't been troublesome. She seemed quite the lady."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't doubt it's all right, just youthful
fervor"&mdash;Mrs. Findlay smiled a little at her&mdash;"but
somehow, it seemed to me so sudden...and so very pronounced..."
She half-stopped herself. "I felt doubtful of her sincerity," she
finished, "but, as you say, it's probably just her way. But don't
let her take to coming to my room. Should she ever speak to you
about it, while I'm still here, please discourage her. I did ask
her there just now in a moment of weakness, but she's such a
stayer...and I'm so busy getting my things together...she spoke
of coming in tomorrow morning, for instance, but I told her I
should be engaged. Poor old Mr. Nevern would be quite swamped by
her. It's his day to drop in for an hour..." and with a nod Mrs.
Findlay swept on to her room and castle.</p>

<p>The manageress passed the conversation on to the head
housemaid, her trusted assistant.</p>

<p>"Funny!" that young woman murmured. "I mean Miss Gray being so
keen on Mrs. Findlay. She's not everybody's fancy, is she? I
wonder if she has heard about that money and is making up to Mrs.
Findlay because of it."</p>

<p>"She can't possibly know. And don't forget, you don't know
anything about it, either!" the manageress warned her.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Findlay told me about it herself, just now. Said she had
come in quite unexpectedly for some money and might easily come
in for more. Said she was going round the world. I said I didn't
wonder. I'd go round the world twice over if only someone would
leave me a five-pound note for doing it. Wouldn't you?" and the
talk drifted to what one would do if one came into wealth.</p>

<p>As the days passed, Winnie and Alfreda avoided each other, but
when they met they were quite civil, especially Alfreda, who went
out of her way to be nice to the other. She openly admired her
beauty, and spoke of feeling as though Winnie were a lovely
flower to be shielded from rough winds, something fragile that no
tempest should touch. This much was gained by Alfreda's presence,
that Miss Pratt spoke very little to Gilmour. She really retired
into something resembling polite sulks, talking to Ingram, but
hardly deigning to see Haliburton, and spending most of her time
at other houses. As for Miss Longstaff, Moy thought her in her
own way as aloof as Tark, but with something watchful added. She
would fix that odd unreadable stare of hers now on one, now on
another of the house party as though trying to understand
something which puzzled her.</p>

<p>Frederick Ingram came more frequently to the house now. He
avoided Gilmour as much as possible, but when the two met they
seemed to be able to meet on a footing of indifferent civility.
Miss Longstaff appeared rather to like Frederick, and as that
young man was fond of an audience, he would often be found by her
side if Miss Pratt were out of reach. He did not stay at The Tall
House, but came and went, taking and bringing papers to his
half-brother.</p>

<p>It was just a little over a week after Alfreda's arrival when
all happened to be in the lounge around six. The cocktails had
been handed about, and the talk turned on ghosts. No one
afterwards seemed able to remember exactly how it started.
Someone&mdash;Moy said he thought it was Tark, Tark said it was
Haliburton, Haliburton maintained that it was Frederick,
Frederick insisted that it was Gilmour, and Gilmour said that he
felt sure it was Ingram&mdash;mentioned that a man whom he had
met lately had spoken to him of what a splendid display Appleton
used to give as a ghost in a Grand Guignol play. But all agreed
that it was Frederick who said that The Tall House had a ghost,
that one of its former owners had been found hanged. It was
suspected though never proved that his valet did the hanging. The
old man's ghost was said to walk.</p>

<p>Ingram said that a ghost was always part of the furniture of
an old house, and asked Moy whether on the expiration of a
tenancy it had to be handed back in the same condition as when
taken over.</p>

<p>"Fair wear and tear excepted," Moy said at once, amid
laughter.</p>

<p>"A safe provision," Haliburton pointed out, "as nothing could
damage ghostly bones or clothes, not even bullets."</p>

<p>"The ghost had better not bank on that," Gilmour said with a
most unaccustomed edge to his voice. "Personally, if I meet one,
I shall fire at sight."</p>

<p>Something in his tone made the group fall silent.</p>

<p>"How will you let the ghost know of its danger beforehand?"
Winnie asked with one of her tinkling laughs. "By a notice to the
Psychical Society?"</p>

<p>"I think I have given notice by what I am saying." Gilmour's
tone was still hard. "There aren't such things as real ghosts,
there are only practical jokers. And, as I say, I warn any joker
here that that particular piece of foolishness isn't a safe one
to play on me."</p>

<p>"You seem rather warm about it," Ingram said dryly.</p>

<p>"Sorry!" Gilmour's tanned face looked apologetic. "I'm afraid
I did rather get on my hind legs, but I was badly frightened by a
so-called ghost as a kid, and the mere mention of them makes me
see red ever since."</p>

<p>He looked round for Miss Longstaff. But that young lady had
moved behind him to an open window. She was standing very rigid,
her head and chin stuck out at an angle that was not at all
pretty, but which suggested breathless excitement. One hand was
fingering a string of beads she wore; it had an effect of being
pressed against her heart. Moy remembered afterwards that not
till the talk changed did she relax that absorbed pose of hers.
Gilmour, still without seeing her, rose and left the lounge.
Frederick Ingram followed him for a moment.</p>

<p>"He means it right enough," he said, coming back. "He's got it
into his head that one of us is going to play that same prank on
him again, and he wants everyone to know that he really intends
'to shoot at sight. I think he suspects me."</p>

<p>"Is he a good shot?" Tark asked in his creaky, expressionless
voice. Everyone laughed.</p>

<p>"Very," Ingram spoke up now. "Very," he repeated, looking
sharply at his brother. "But I don't think I'm giving anyone much
of a surprise when I add that his revolver is loaded with
blank."</p>

<p>"Blank or loaded, I have no intention of amusing Gilmour,"
Frederick said promptly. "But it's as well for the rest of you to
know that you needn't drop on the floor when you hear a
bang."</p>

<p>Ingram turned away and picked up a book near him. When he was
not writing he was sure to be reading, Winnie had once told him.
She crossed to his side now. "I can't imagine you without books."
She smiled at him one of her softest, most radiant smiles.</p>

<p>"Let's take a turn in the fresh air," he said under his
breath. "Somehow the air in here's a bit hot...electric...but as
to being without books, there are other things I couldn't live
without. When this month is up, Winnie"&mdash;he had never called
her by her first name before&mdash;"how are you going to
choose?"</p>

<p>"My mother wants me to marry Basil Haliburton," she said
evasively.</p>

<p>"Are you going to?" he asked, standing still and taking hold
of a spray of Bokhara vine.</p>

<p>"You've spoiled matters," she said with one of her most
flirtatious upward glances. "But for you, I shouldn't have
hesitated. Until you came, I felt so sure I cared for him."</p>

<p>"What about Lawrence Gilmour?" The question came before he
could check it. She cocked a supercilious chin at him.</p>

<p>"Lawrence Gilmour? Why, he's engaged. It isn't because of Mr.
Gilmour that I'm not sure what I shall say to Basil
Haliburton."</p>

<p>Even the adoring Ingram looked a bit doubtful, and the chin
swept up still more.</p>

<p>"You alone complicate matters," she said softly and yet rather
wearily. As she spoke they turned a corner and almost stepped on
Haliburton himself. It was an awkward meeting. Even Winnie was
nonplussed for a second, then she made some remark about the
flowers, and the evening light, and the young man took it up
pleasantly, but he avoided looking, or speaking, directly to
Ingram.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER 5</h2>

<p class="first">THAT night Moy was awakened by the last sound
that the young solicitor ever expected to hear in a
house&mdash;the sound of a shot. With it came a loud cry and then
a thud.</p>

<p>Still rigid with bewilderment, he heard a sort of sobbing
falsetto:</p>

<p>"Where's the light? God, where's the switch?" The voice seemed
that of a stranger and yet there was something about it which
reminded him of Gilmour.</p>

<p>Moy came to life and sprang out of bed. He rushed into the
passage. Bright moonlight flooded it. Just in front of him was
the big main passage leading down to Gilmour's room, the door of
which faced him across the landing at the farther end. Halfway
down the passage was Ingram's room and it was in front of that
room that something bulky and white was lying.</p>

<p>Coming towards Moy and towards the heap on the ground,
staggering as though he were drunk, and clawing at the wall with
his left hand, was a man in pajamas. The right hand was
outstretched and held something small that glittered in the cold,
white light; glittered all the more because it wavered and swung
to and fro, as though the arm were a broken signpost in a gale of
wind. In the moonlight the man's face showed so blanched, so
distorted with its protruding eyeballs and open mouth that Moy
thought it was a stranger's for a moment. Then he saw it was
Gilmour. Just by the white heap on the floor both almost collided
with each other. Their hands met and closed on a switch. At the
same instant other voices, men's voices, called out to know what
was wrong, and lights blazed out in the cross passages.</p>

<p>Moy and Gilmour were both on their knees beside that
motionless heap on the ground. It was heavy, and seemed to be
wrapped in sheeting, but at last Moy got hold of a loose end of
the stuff and flung it back&mdash;to show the dead face of
Ingram, with a small red hole in the exact center of the
forehead. He was still warm, still flexible. Moy stared down at
him in horror. Yet there was nothing horrifying in the face
itself. On the contrary it was beautiful in its own marble way,
with a certain grand air of peace, profound and real.</p>

<p>"A doctor! A doctor!" Gilmour almost sobbed. "It's some awful
mistake&mdash;it can't be! It was loaded with blank!"</p>

<p>Moy heard a sort of shocked cluck over his shoulder. It was
Haliburton who was now bending down beside him.</p>

<p>"He can't be dead! The cartridges were blanks, I tell you.
Where's a doctor? One hears of people being resuscitated after
hours&mdash;" Gilmour was all but inarticulate, and was shaking
violently. The revolver dropped from his grip as he spoke, and he
pushed it to one side while he tried to raise Ingram's head and
turn it to the light.</p>

<p>"A doctor will be fetched at once," Moy spoke in a whisper.
This was a most dreadful affair. "But how did it happen? Where
was Ingram? I mean, when you fired?"</p>

<p>The solicitor in Moy was seeking data, but Haliburton touched
him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"We must get a doctor here at once!"</p>

<p>They were in front of Ingram's own room. It had a telephone in
it. Gilmour caught it up with shaking fingers. Then he turned his
face to the others. He looked like a man living in a
nightmare.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't remember the name of any doctor. Quick! Who
knows one? And what his number is?"</p>

<p>Moy reached for the directory. The shock had driven his own
doctor's number out of his mind too, but Haliburton, with a
sympathetic glance at Gilmour, took the receiver from him and in
a steady firm tone gave the Mayfair number of his father's
physician.</p>

<p>Moy laid down the directory. As he did so, he saw Tark just
inside the door which he was holding open. But a Tark with all
his usual air of sardonic detachment shed. This was Tark with the
lid off, Moy decided, and the inside of the man seemed to be a
seething cauldron. Neither then nor afterwards could Moy name the
emotions that he saw frothing up together. In almost the same
instant Tark stepped back, shutting the door noiselessly behind
him, but not before Moy saw, on the stairs behind, hanging as it
were like a moon in the darkness, a girl's white face and
recognized it as Alfreda Longstaff.</p>

<p>"Look here," Moy said again while Haliburton was trying to
rouse the household of the great man in Harley Street, "how did
it happen, Gilmour?"</p>

<p>"I fired at a ghost, a blank cartridge, and then I heard it
cry out, and&mdash;" Gilmour stopped and sank into a chair,
covering his face with his hands.</p>

<p>"Where's the revolver?" Moy urged. It was partly kindness. He
thought that anything was better than letting Gilmour live over
in memory what had just happened. Gilmour did not lift his head.
Moy, on the instant that he spoke, remembered the little
glittering thing dropping beside Ingram's body, and, opening the
door, now stepped into the passage again. He almost trod on Miss
Longstaff, who, the revolver in her hands, was turning away from
the body on the carpet. On her face was the last look that Moy
expected to see, a look as unexpected as the shot had been, for
it had in it a sort of vindictive satisfaction; a sort of excited
gloating, he called it to himself afterwards.</p>

<p>"Hand me that revolver, please," he said sharply. "Is it
yours?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I represent the absent owner of the house. And I represent
Ingram's relatives. Hand me that weapon, please."</p>

<p>She let him have it, though reluctantly.</p>

<p>He broke it open. All five remaining cartridges seemed to be
blank.</p>

<p>"How did it happen? Who shot him?" she asked, and again there
was that suggestion of eagerness about her that was so ghoulish
at such a moment.</p>

<p>"Do go back to your room," Moy urged. "This is no place for a
girl. As you can see, there's been an awful accident, and
Ingram's been shot." Suddenly he stopped. He noticed now that
Ingram's body now lay covered by a sheet. He eyed Miss Longstaff
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"He looked so dreadful staring up," she said, and for the
first time there was a hint of confusion in her voice.</p>

<p>Ingram had not looked dreadful. This covered mound was much
more horrible.</p>

<p>"No one should touch him," Moy said with the same sternness in
his voice as when he had asked her for the revolver.</p>

<p>"Why? Was it murder?" She drew a deep breath and looked at him
with that odd, unreadable stare of hers. "Who shot him?" she
persisted.</p>

<p>"I did," came a dull voice from behind them. "I did, Freda."
Gilmour had come out into the corridor again.</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't call me Freda, Mr. Gilmour," came the
instant reply. "There's no question of any future engagement
between us&mdash;after this. Of course, you realize that
too."</p>

<p>Gilmour looked as though she had struck him. His white face
went even whiter.</p>

<p>"You don't mean it! It's not possible! You can't&mdash;" he
began in a strangled voice, taking an imploring step towards her.
Her answer was to turn her back on him and walk away. As she did
so there came the swift rush of feet down the stairs. Miss Pratt,
looking a dream in a floating gown the color of sweet peas, ran
towards Gilmour, her two hands outstretched.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tark tells me&mdash;oh Lawrence, I'm so sorry! So sorry!
For you!" She thrust her little white hands into Gilmour's fists,
who dropped the white fingers after the most perfunctory touch
and took a step after the other slender figure, the one fully
dressed, with the short straight dark hair brushed smoothly back
like a boy's from the hard but vivid face.</p>

<p>"Alfreda! Miss Longstaff!" he began again. She turned, and
standing still, bent on him again that inscrutable stare of hers,
and something in it was so inimical that he stepped back and
stood staring at her. As she turned a corner, he at last looked
at Winnie.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't be here. Your mother wouldn't like it." He
spoke as though his thoughts were quite elsewhere.</p>

<p>Alfreda had gone straight to Mrs. Pratt's rooms. She knocked
at the bedroom door and called through the panels. "It's me, Mrs.
Pratt, Alfreda Longstaff. Something has happened. Your daughter
needs you." There came a muffled sort of squeak from within, but
the door was not opened for quite a long minute.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Pratt stepped out. "What's that about Winnie? Where
is she? What on earth has happened?" Her face looked oddly
blotched as though some strapping or top dressing had been
roughly pulled off.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gilmour has killed Mr. Ingram, and your daughter is
telling him how sorry she is for him." The tone was dry.</p>

<p>There was nothing muffled about Mrs. Pratt's squeak this time.
"Winnie, where are you? Wait for me! Wait!" And as though a
performance were about to begin which she would not miss for
worlds, she scurried in the direction of Alfreda's pointing hand.
In front of Ingram's bedroom she stopped in horror. For once she
had nothing to say for a full minute. Then she turned to
Winnie.</p>

<p>"Come, dearest, we're only in the way here. We must get Yates
up, and see to our packing. The kindest thing we can do for
everyone is to get away as soon as possible. Come, Winnie!"</p>

<p>"I won't leave now&mdash;like this." Winnie spoke
indignantly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pratt turned to Moy. Her eyes asked her questions.</p>

<p>"Ingram played the part of a ghost and Gilmour fired at him a
blank cartridge, as he thought&mdash;which must have been loaded.
He's dead," he murmured, his eyes on the white mound to whom the
"he" referred.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pratt turned to Gilmour with what looked like genuine
emotion.</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor boy! You poor, poor boy! And, and&mdash;how
awful!" She did not try to put the rest of her feelings into
words.</p>

<p>Winnie let her mother lead her away. They found Alfreda pacing
their little sitting-room.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're leaving, too?" she asked, as Winnie hurried
on to her own room with her lips pressed together.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pratt closed the door. "I'm so sorry for you, my dear
girl," she began gently, "and so shocked&mdash;so indescribably
shocked for that poor boy!"</p>

<p>"We're not going to be engaged, if you refer to Lawrence
Gilmour," Alfreda said composedly.</p>

<p>"What?" Mrs. Pratt fairly jumped. "But surely! But this is
dreadfully sudden!" she finished lamely.</p>

<p>"His shooting of Mr. Ingram was dreadfully sudden," was the
reply.</p>

<p>"But surely, for a time, you'll let things stand over!" Mrs.
Pratt was almost pleading. "It will look so dreadfully heartless,
to drop him the very instant it happened."</p>

<p>"I have no intention, now or ever, of getting engaged to Mr.
Gilmour. I think you ought to know."</p>

<p>The door opened. Winnie came in. She could not stay in any one
place for long.</p>

<p>"You're acting horribly!" she began.</p>

<p>"I'm not acting at all." There was meaning in the look the
elder girl gave the younger. Winnie seemed to pay no attention to
it.</p>

<p>"He needs you!" she protested instead.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pratt nodded her head emphatically. Alfreda shot the
mother a glance openly mocking. But she said nothing.</p>

<p>"I'd go through anything with the man I loved!" came
passionately from Winnie.</p>

<p>"Supposing he loved you," the other girl finished dryly.
"Perhaps it's just as well for you that Mr. Gilmour doesn't seem
to fill that condition."</p>

<p>Winnie's cheeks flamed.</p>

<p>"A girl would have to have a perfect passion for notoriety to
marry him after this," Alfreda went on.</p>

<p>The door slammed behind Winnie. Mrs. Pratt looked half-gratefully,
half-indignantly, at her visitor, who gave her one of
her odd stares and went out to run lightly down into Ingram's
study. She closed the door noiselessly behind her. For a second
she stood sniffing the air. It smelled of...yes, of that odd
tobacco Mr. Tark liked...but she had not come here to smell
tobacco. She slipped over to the bureau, found its top unlocked,
stood obviously listening for any sound from outside and, hearing
none, opened it and with swift, deft fingers looked through it.
Every scrap of paper was glanced at. It was fairly empty. She
turned over the drawers. Only blank paper was in them with the
exception of the bottom drawer, which was locked. She was pulling
at it when she heard steps coming down the back stairs close to
the library door. Instantly she slipped out of the door by which
she had entered, into the lounge and on up the stairs, along a
passage, and up another flight of stairs. Here she let herself
into an empty bedroom, and, closing its door to with the utmost
caution, sat down at a little bookcase table on which stood a
telephone extension. Very quietly she gave a number. It was that
of the proprietor of the <i>Morning Wire</i>.</p>

<p>"Hello!" came a man's voice in answer to her ring. It was not
the voice that she had heard on the golf links. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"I want to speak to Mr. Warner."</p>

<p>"Who are you? What do you want to speak to him about? I'm one
of Mr. Warner's secretaries." The voice was not encouraging.</p>

<p>"Will you tell Mr. Warner that the Miss Longstaff who played a
game of golf with him on the links at Bispham is staying in a
house at Chelsea with a Mr. Ingram who has just been killed by
his friend. The friend claims that it was an accident."</p>

<p>"Ingram...what is his first name, do you know?"</p>

<p>"Charles."</p>

<p>She heard a sound. The secretary had sprung out of bed. A
couple of minutes more and Miss Longstaff heard Warner's voice
saying sharply:</p>

<p>"What's this about Ingram's death? And who is speaking?"</p>

<p>Miss Longstaff reminded him of the game they had played
together. "Now, Mr. Warner, I've really got hold of some
interesting news. No other paper has it&mdash;yet. You told me
that a scoop would get me a position&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is this about Ingram's death? Where did he die? How was
he killed?" Warner's tone was that of a man who would hang up
unless answered immediately.</p>

<p>"He's been shot by the friend who shares his flat at Harrow, a
man named Lawrence Gilmour. He claims it was an accident. He says
he fired what he thought was a blank shot at someone pretending
to be a ghost, and found that it was Mr. Ingram whom he had
killed. The shot was not blank. That's Mr. Gilmour's story."</p>

<p>She heard another voice speaking, the voice of the man to whom
her first telephone message had gone. "Yes, Gilmour. Of the Civil
Service...That much is all right, sir. But as for the
rest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment," Warner's voice came again. "Now give me all the
facts again, please. But only the ones you are sure of. First of
all, where are you? And when exactly did this happen?"</p>

<p>Swiftly, she had that journalistic quality, and briefly,
another great gift, and, all things considered, very objectively,
she told of what had just happened.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Warner," she wound up, "suppose this could be shown
to be not an accident...wouldn't it be the scoop which you said
would give me a post on your paper?"</p>

<p>Warner had not said quite that. "She's probably just trying it
on," was his murmured comment to Ryland, his secretary, "I mean,
about its not being an accident...but if there's anything in
it...she struck me as being a very resourceful young woman...and
unscrupulous as they're made." Warner added this last thought as
though it were an added point in her favor.</p>

<p>"Well?" she asked sharply, "have I the promise of a post on
the paper if I can prove what I claim? That Mr. Gilmour's story
can't be true?"</p>

<p>"If you can prove that, Miss Longstaff, we'll give you a
trial."</p>

<p>"I want the offer in writing," came her answer.</p>

<p>Warner, with a faint smile, told Ryland to write a note which
would do until the usual contract could be sent. The draft was
read her and she graciously deigned to approve.</p>

<p>"It's not often a paper has such a chance offered it," she
said.</p>

<p>"Nor an outsider either, Miss Longstaff," Warner barked
back.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course. These things have always to be mutual," she
murmured as cynically as an old company promoter. "My name
mustn't come out, of course. That's to be absolutely
guaranteed."</p>

<p>"I'll send one of my men down at once. Name of Courtfield.
Give him all the information you can. He'll know how to put it
into shape. Be on the look-out for him and let him in yourself,
if possible. He's a small man&mdash;dark&mdash;turned-up
nose&mdash;cleft in his chin. He'll be wearing a big yellow
buttonhole and will loiter about on the pavement opposite The
Tall House. You'll have to prove all your assertions."</p>

<p>"I don't know about all," came Miss Longstaff's voice, "but I
shall be able to prove the one that matters most."</p>

<p>"You'll have to prove, or be prepared to prove, any we print,"
Warner said authoritatively. He thought this young woman needed
firmness.</p>

<p>"Personally, I shouldn't be surprised if she killed him
herself in order to get a chance with us." Warner's hand was over
the transmitter. "But Courtfield will soon find out..." He
uncovered the instrument. "Who else is staying in the house, Miss
Longstaff?"</p>

<p>She told him. He passed it on, again with the transmitter
covered.</p>

<p>"Miss Winifred Pratt?" Ryland spelled it with one "t" in his
interest, "the Beauty? We have her picture taken the night she
was presented..."</p>

<p>"Ah," Warner murmured, "possibly she's the explanation. Well,
if so, Courtfield will find out. If the beautiful Miss Pratt is
roped in to the affair, so much the more stir. I don't need to
tell Courtfield to keep his eye open for libel actions. Though I
don't think Miss Longstaff will cross the line. Too clever by
half."</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER 6</h2>

<p class="first">MEANWHILE a hitch had occurred. The doctor to
whom Haliburton had telephoned was just getting into his car,
when an urgent summons reached him from a patient who was
hovering between life and death. He dashed off to her bedside,
and left his secretary to suggest over the 'phone to Haliburton
that, since death had already occurred, and from an accident,
Haliburton had perhaps better send for the police. This would
have been suggested in the first place, had it not been that
important young man himself who had spoken over the wire.</p>

<p>Haliburton jerked his lower lip sideways and set his teeth
together as he did when anything happened which he greatly
disliked. He glanced at Moy and repeated what had just been
said.</p>

<p>"Of course!" Moy said impatiently, "obviously we need the
police, and at once. It's like a ship with plague on board. You
must get the officials in before the passengers can get off.
We're in quarantine until the regulations are complied with."</p>

<p>"The police..." Haliburton hesitated. "It's most unpleasant
for&mdash;the women. There's no mystery here."</p>

<p>"No, but there's been a death by misadventure. Of course we
must have the police."</p>

<p>Haliburton looked up the name of the nearest police station.
Moy went out into the corridor. He felt as though unless he moved
so as to keep pace with his surging thoughts, they would leave
him behind&mdash;an idiot&mdash;and rush on whirling and spinning
of their own volition. As a matter of fact, he was not thinking
at all. He was feeling, and feeling to the exclusion of
everything else. Horror. Regret for Ingram, that fine
mathematician and charming personality; sympathy with Gilmour;
amazement at Alfreda Longstaff...There she was, by the way,
scanning the carpet as though intent on mending it...He caught up
with her.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you realize," he began, "how greatly your
breaking off of your engagement will bias the police against
Gilmour." He spoke temperately, but he felt warm. She looked at
him with a smile that increased his dislike of the girl. Oh, she
was deep...unfathomable. Quite unlike lovely warm-hearted Winnie
Pratt.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she murmured, and stood a moment quite still with
downcast lids.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I've been too hasty," she said now with a singularly
unconvincing accent of regret. "I really know nothing of what's
happened, except what Mr. Gilmour has said, and, of course, he is
so upset. Did he really fire at Mr. Ingram?" she asked in a tone
of intense interest which he found hard to answer civilly.</p>

<p>"As you heard. He did. With a cartridge which he thought was
blank and which by some horrible mistake was loaded. And which
killed Ingram."</p>

<p>Again she looked him straight in the face with that unreadable
stare of hers.</p>

<p>"What a good shot he must be!" was her quite unexpected
comment.</p>

<p>Moy almost jumped. "Look here, if you say a thing like that,
you render yourself open to a libel action." He spoke
severely.</p>

<p>"But why? If he thought he was firing blank?" She met his
scrutiny with bland nonchalance. "I think he and Mr. Ingram
practised revolver shooting a good deal," she went on.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he muttered.</p>

<p>"The first time I met Mr. Gilmour he said something about it."
She was standing in the window now playing with the tassel of the
curtain.</p>

<p>"Where did you first meet him?" he asked and, on that, he had
the satisfaction of seeing a look cross her face that said quite
plainly that she wished the words unsaid. Then her gaze returned
to the street. She saw a small man walking briskly along the
opposite pavement. In his coat was an enormous yellow
buttonhole.</p>

<p>"Oh, down in the country," she replied, as she began to walk
towards the stairs and descend them with an air of doing so
almost mechanically. The front door was out of sight of where Moy
was standing. With cautious care she opened the door. It was not
bolted, she saw. Instantly the man with the yellow buttonhole
came in. He dropped the decoration into his pocket as he did
so.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven it was early. The only yellow flowers I could
find were some paper daffodils from my diggings and two men
already have asked me if I was doing it for a bet. Now, Miss
Longstaff, will you give me your news, please. My name is
Courtfield. Here's my card."</p>

<p>He was studying her as he spoke with a pair of eyes that took
her in from head to heel. Everything for his paper would depend
on this young woman's trustworthiness. Could she be relied on?
That was the paramount question. But behind it was another that
interested the crime expert almost as much. Why had she
volunteered to give the information in the first place? Was it
vengeance for the dead, or against the living? He had met Ingram,
and he had met Gilmour. He knew of the friendship between the two
men. Why did this girl believe, or pretend to believe, that the
latter had killed the other? Civil Servants are not, as a rule, a
bloodthirsty lot. Gilmour had seemed quite the average
pleasant-tempered chap one meets at every turn. Ingram had not shown
any irritating peculiarities...then why had this young woman 'phoned
as she had done? Meeting that stare of her black eyes he felt a
personality here, a will of steel...Was it merely because of the
offer of a permanent post on the paper that she had come forward
or was there some other sharper spur? The presence in the house
of the lovely Miss Pratt, did that stand for anything?</p>

<p>But Miss Longstaff was now speaking to him. She led him into a
small room rarely used by any of the present household. It was
chiefly given over to some defunct owner's butterfly collection,
and there she said a few swift sentences to which Courtfield
listened as though they were directions concerning the finding of
hidden treasure. Then he slipped out again. He did not want to
meet the police. No paper would care deliberately to flout them,
and he would be at once asked how he got into the house, and what
he intended to print. His name, for once, would not appear below
his article. It was to be strictly anonymous and to remain
so.</p>

<p>Upstairs Moy paced the corridor back and forth, that strange
look on Alfreda's mobile face haunted him. And the look that she
had fastened on Gilmour's bowed head as she came into the room
where Haliburton stood telephoning. A suggestion of a future
triumph, of a "you wait!" vindictiveness about it...What was she
going to do? For Moy felt sure that she meant to take some active
hand in matters...or could it be that she had already taken it,
and was now waiting for the harvest to appear? He believed that
she was glad of the awful position in which Gilmour stood...But
surely no one could even pretend that this was anything but a
genuine accident? Or a terrible blunder. Though Gilmour was an
unusually careful and neat-fingered young man. Was it possible
that this was a crime on Gilmour's part? But Moy, putting aside
all preconceived idea as to Gilmour's character, could not see
the likelihood of that. The two lived together. If Gilmour, for
some as yet absolutely hidden reason, wished to murder Ingram, he
could have done so in a dozen better ways without ruining his own
life. For no matter how sympathetic the jury or the coroner might
be&mdash;supposing him, or them, to be in a kindly mood&mdash;the
fact remained that Gilmour's whole life was ruined. He could
never forget, and the world would never forget, that he had
killed Ingram. There was only one chance for Gilmour that Moy
could see, and that was that, supposing a crime to be here and
not an accident, Gilmour could discover its author. But even if
he succeeded in doing this, or even if the police succeeded,
could it be proved? Say that someone who hated Gilmour, had
secretly substituted a loaded cartridge for the first blank one,
the deed was done. Could the past give up its secrets in anything
so difficult to prove, so swiftly accomplished? Moy did not see
how Gilmour could ever be set free from suspicion, or rather from
the pillory of being a marked man all his life unless the crime
could be brought home to the real criminal&mdash;if a crime, and
a criminal, existed behind this death of Ingram. Assuming it not
to be due to accident, the murderer, Moy reasoned, must be
someone with a motive for killing Ingram, and also someone who
knew where the revolver and the cartridges of Gilmour were kept.
Suddenly his face blanched a little. He saw that he must go
further&mdash;much&mdash;than this, and he realized that if a
crime lay here, then the criminal must have overheard or been
told of, that talk only this evening in the lounge, when Gilmour
had warned the company that if anyone tried to frighten him by
playing a ghost he would fire at it. A sound came from behind
him. It was the butler, looking quite gay in pajamas of rainbow
hue and a green dressing-gown.</p>

<p>"Is anything wrong, sir?" he asked, looking about him and
quickly taking in all that there was to be seen. Hobbs had served
in the War and his gaze dwelt on the white mound farther down the
passage.</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Ingram," Moy said. "I rang for you for nearly five
minutes on end."</p>

<p>"We sleep on the top floor now, sir, and the bells don't reach
us. But I heard doors closing, and came along to reconnoiter, and
nearly ran into Mr. Tark who was coming to wake us up...He told
me what had happened. I've told the housekeeper to let the others
know. Have the police been notified, sir?"</p>

<p>As he asked the question, came the sound of a car drawing up
with a swish, and a quiet press of the electric bell. Quiet and
yet insistent.</p>

<p>Hobbs ran down, and Moy bent over the landing balustrade. He
did not intend to leave the corridor to itself again. Through the
big front door slipped a short, stout man, a doctor, Moy rightly
guessed. Then came a figure that filled it well. Chief Inspector
Pointer was a tall, soldierly-looking man with a tanned, pleasant
face and a pair of very steady, tranquil, dark gray eyes, the
gray of the thinker, without any blue in them. He was followed in
his turn by three other men.</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Moy, sir," the butler said as he looked up at the
young solicitor.</p>

<p>Moy thought that such an introduction was open to
misconstruction seeing what had just happened, but he only leaned
over and asked if they would all come up to him as he did not
want to leave the corridor.</p>

<p>"The body is here," he added.</p>

<p>The chief inspector said a word to the butler, who remained
behind with one of his men, then he took the stairs three at a
time, noiselessly as a cat.</p>

<p>Moy introduced himself. "I represent the dead man, Mr.
Ingram's relatives, as well as the owner of the house. Both
are&mdash;were, in the case of Ingram&mdash;clients of mine." He
stared hard at the young man facing him. Much would depend on the
officer in charge of this case.</p>

<p>From Gilmour's point of view one could almost say that
everything would depend on the inquiry being conducted with
absolute open-mindedness and fairness. Let him fall into the
hands of a stupid man and he might find himself in a position
which Moy did not care to contemplate. The longer Moy looked into
the face of the chief inspector, the more reassured he grew.
Here, he felt, were better brains than his own, brains of no
common order, and there was, besides, that indefinable something
that makes a man stand out above his fellows as a leader, as an
organizer.</p>

<p>Chief Inspector Pointer, too, was giving the young man in
front of him a far more searching scrutiny than his apparently
casual glance would have suggested. He, too, liked what he saw.
Moy was tremendously upset, and not at his best, but the shrewd
observer facing him knew that he was not trying to be at his
best. Here was a young man frankly rattled, not in the least
endeavoring to pull himself together, not seeking to make any
definite, arranged impression. Also Moy's face was his fortune
all his life long, little though he guessed it. For something
warm, and impulsive, and unselfish, looked out of his ugly
features and spoke in his voice.</p>

<p>"Just what has happened?" Pointer asked, as Moy led him and
the doctor to the white heap at the farther end.</p>

<p>Moy explained very briefly what he himself had seen and heard,
and what he had been told by Gilmour.</p>

<p>"Who drew the sheet out from under the body?" Pointer asked
as, after giving it a look, he lifted it off and began to fold it
up. So his one glance had told him that the sheet's position had
been altered. Moy, on that instant, realized a little of the
quick perceptions behind the chief inspector's quiet, steady,
gaze.</p>

<p>"One of the ladies. She thought his face should be covered,"
he said slowly. Time enough to name Miss Longstaff later on.</p>

<p>Pointer and the doctor now bent over the stiff form.</p>

<p>"Bullet still inside the head," the doctor said. "Well,
there's nothing further for me to do here." He had an urgent call
to an ambulance case. In a few words he and Pointer arranged for
the fetching of the body and for the post-mortem. The doctor
hurried off. Pointer turned to Moy again.</p>

<p>"How do you know this is the same sheet as the one which you
saw draped about him. Were you here when it was drawn out from
underneath?"</p>

<p>Moy had not been, but he identified it by the bullet hole
close to the hem. Pointer asked him to initial in pencil one of
the corners and then locked it away in his case. He had Moy show
him where he was standing when he first caught sight of Ingram
and Gilmour. Where Gilmour's room was, where Ingram's.</p>

<p>Then Pointer went over the floor of the passage inch by inch.
He picked up from a cream-colored flower in the carpet a piece of
what looked to Moy like a torn scrap of cream wrapping paper
roughly the size of his hand, and near it a spent cartridge case.
He sniffed at the latter. When he had made quite sure that there
was nothing else to be found on the ground, he examined the walls
and the few articles of furniture standing against them. Last of
all, he stopped for a moment at one blind, whose cord was tied
into a sort of bunched knot.</p>

<p>"I saw that done," Moy explained, "one of the girls staying in
the house did it absent-mindedly, while talking to me only a few
minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Then the blind was up?"</p>

<p>Moy, for a second, did not see how this simple fact was so
patent. Then he nodded. "Yes, she pulled it up while
talking."</p>

<p>"And pulled it down again?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>Moy nodded.</p>

<p>"Did she open the window?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was for that reason that she had drawn up the blind,"
Moy said. "Then after a moment's gulp of fresh air, she closed
it, drew down the blind, and went off."</p>

<p>Pointer looked out of each of the others in turn and saw that
this window was the only one in the corridor that showed the
opposite pavement. The view from the other windows was blocked by
a ledge above the first floor.</p>

<p>"Was it the same young lady who drew the sheet out from under
the body?" he asked when leaving the window as he found it.</p>

<p>Moy assented, saying that he supposed the signs of hauling on
the sheet had made the chief inspector guess what had been
done.</p>

<p>This time it was Pointer who nodded and then asked if the
position of the body had been much altered. Moy said that as far
as one could judge by looking at it, the body lay exactly where
it had been before and in the same attitude, Pointer next asked
where Gilmour was, as he would now like to hear his account of
what had happened.</p>

<p>"I suppose he still has the weapon with which he claims that
he fired the shot?"</p>

<p>Moy said no, that he himself now had it, and could vouch for
its being the identical weapon. He handed it over. Pointer looked
at the little nickel-plated thing, examined it carefully, smelled
it, broke it open and counted the cartridges still in
it&mdash;all of which were blank&mdash;and put it, too, away in
his attach case after requesting Moy to make quite sure that he
could identify it again in court.</p>

<p>"Now who exactly are the people in the house?" was the next
question. "And where is the host or hostess?" Moy explained
briefly, but sufficiently, what the position was. Then Pointer,
leaving one of his men to watch the body unostentatiously,
followed Moy to Gilmour's room at the end of the corridor where
Winnie Pratt hurried up to him. She had been lurking on the
landing above, apparently.</p>

<p>"You're the police, aren't you? Or from Scotland Yard?"</p>

<p>Moy introduced the chief inspector.</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't arrest him! Please don't believe it was
anything but a dreadful accident!" she begged in tragic accents.
"Why, Mr. Ingram was his great friend! Besides&mdash;Mr.
Gilmour's engaged to someone else."</p>

<p>Pointer said nothing. She was very cryptic. Was this really
just a silly girl defending a man in peril? There is no more
charming sight if sincere than that reversal of the usual roles
between the sexes, but it must be sincere.</p>

<p>He asked her why she thought that he would look on the death
as anything else but an accident.</p>

<p>She wrung her exquisitely kept hands with their
tangerine-enameled nails.</p>

<p>"Because the police always do doubt things. And suspect
people! But in this case that's absurd. It's not in Mr. Gilmour's
nature to do such a dreadful thing!"</p>

<p>Pointer asked her a few questions about herself, about
Gilmour, about Ingram. But she would hardly give an answer to any
set question.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ingram wanted to marry me, you'll hear all about that
side of the story, and I&mdash;I&mdash;well, I wasn't sure...and
I liked Mr. Gilmour&mdash;just as a friend. And I showed that I
did. And...well...some people will say, so my mother says, that
it was all my fault. That I oughtn't to've talked so much with
Mr. Gilmour...but that's such nonsense. He's in love with
Alfreda. Longstaff. And besides, it was only
friendship&mdash;ever. And besides, even if it hadn't been, he
wouldn't have shot Mr. Ingram. It's a ridiculous and horrible
idea."</p>

<p>Again Mrs. Pratt appeared looking for Winnie. Moy did not
wonder. Really, what the girl needed this morning was an
attendant from a Home for the Feeble-minded, he thought savagely.
Of course it was all Mrs. Pratt's fault, trying to make Winnie
see the error of her past ways and overdoing it. But what a
perfect simpleton the girl was...though a dream of
loveliness...</p>

<p>Pointer looked after the dream with a thoughtful frown.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER 7</h2>

<p class="first">MOY took Pointer into the room where Gilmour sat
with his head hidden in his hands. He looked up with a start as
the two came in. Moy, after a word of introduction, would have
left them alone together, but Gilmour asked him to stay.</p>

<p>"My memory seems to've gone spotty. You may be able to prompt
me."</p>

<p>An assenting glance from the chief inspector said that the
young solicitor's presence would be quite welcome, then he turned
to Gilmour and asked for an account of what had happened.</p>

<p>Gilmour said that he was awakened by someone opening his
bedroom door with a snap and giving a hollow moan or groan. As he
sat up in bed, the door was left open, the corridor outside was
flooded with moonlight, and he saw a sheeted figure walking down
it away from his room. He stepped to a chest of drawers by the
door and took out his revolver which he had loaded with blank for
just such an occasion. In answer to another question he said that
owing to some talk about ghosts in the evening, he had rather
thought that someone might play that old joke on him. He had
never thought of Charles Ingram, but of Moy, or possibly
Frederick. Taking his revolver, he went into the passage, where
the ghost was now half-way down. At his call of "I'm going to
shoot, you'd better disappear!" the "ghost" turned round and
faced him with another moan. He fired full at it, and, to his
horror, heard it give a cry, and then sag to the floor. After
that awful second Gilmour said he could not be sure of what
happened. He tried for a switch on the wall but could not seem to
find one. The next thing he remembered clearly was lifting the
head of the ghost and finding that it was Ingram, and that he was
quite dead.</p>

<p>Pointer then began his questions. Gilmour said that he was a
good shot, but that on this occasion he had not troubled to take
aim, though it was possible that, as the head would be thrown
into relief against the oak paneled door, it would have offered a
target at which he had fired without consciously selecting
it.</p>

<p>Pointer asked for a very careful account of the ghost's
appearance. Gilmour, looking very white, shut his eyes, and
described minutely a figure draped in a sheet, with the end drawn
over the head and covering the whole face to below the chin,
walking with head thrust forward and a shuffling gait.</p>

<p>Moy noticed that Pointer took Gilmour over this part very
carefully, harking back and repeating several of his questions,
though in different forms.</p>

<p>Next he produced the revolver just handed him by the
solicitor. Gilmour identified it as his, and again went over how
he had loaded it, where the box of blank cartridges were in the
drawer, and where the loaded ones. He said that he and Ingram
shared a flat in an old house in Harrow which stood quite
isolated, and for that cause both of them kept a revolver and
some cartridges handy. He went into details about where he had
purchased his, and finally handed the chief inspector his
license.</p>

<p>Pointer next wanted to know whether anyone had been in the
room with him when he had loaded with blank. Yes, Gilmour said,
Ingram had been. He had done it on coming up from the lounge only
this evening, or rather, since it was now early morning, only
last evening, after the talk in the lounge.</p>

<p>He gave a brief outline of that talk.</p>

<p>"So that Mr. 'Ingram would have expected you to fire blank
shots?" Pointer said thoughtfully, "and would not be concerned
when you pointed the revolver at him?"</p>

<p>Moy was sorry for Gilmour. Gilmour looked appalled at the
question, but he answered it with a brief acquiescent
gesture.</p>

<p>"Was the dead man fond of playing practical jokes?" was the
next question.</p>

<p>Gilmour said that that would be the last thing anyone could
say of Charles Ingram. "But," he went on, "he had a theory, which
I now think he must have been testing last night. He said that,
given any sudden emergency, or waked from sleep&mdash;as I
was&mdash;a man would only do what he was accustomed to doing.
That is to say that, however much I, or any other ordinary
Londoner, laid his revolver ready, given an emergency, he would
never think of using it, but would dash out empty-handed.
Unfortunately he was wrong," Gilmour added.</p>

<p>Pointer asked next on what footing he and the dead man had
been. Gilmour said very simply that he and Ingram had always got
on well, and that no subject of discord had ever come between
them.</p>

<p>"Has he any close relations?" Pointer asked next, turning to
Moy, so as to give Gilmour a little time to recover. He looked as
though he needed it.</p>

<p>Moy said that Ingram had a sister married to a man called
Appleton, and a half-brother, Frederick Ingram. Mrs. Appleton had
two children and she and they were, according to Ingram's will
left with Moy's firm, Ingram's sole legatees. As to how much he
had to leave, Moy said that he had no exact idea. But he fancied
that the dead man's income was around five hundred pounds a year.
Gilmour, appealed to for corroboration, said that figure would be
fairly accurate, though, as Ingram lived at the rate of four
hundred, there were possibly some savings to be divided up.
Ingram, Pointer was told, as he knew already from Who's Who, had
taken high honors in mathematics at Cambridge, where he also held
a Fellowship for a few years, only relinquishing it to become
examiner and lecturer in his especial field. He wrote on many
other subjects as well, though they were all more or less kindred
ones, such as ciphers and odd numerical puzzles.</p>

<p>Pointer now asked something which was exceedingly painful to
both men. He wanted Moy and he wanted Gilmour again to go over
the incidents of the shooting. That is to say, Gilmour was to act
as far as possible as he said that he had when he was first
awakened, and Moy to do as nearly as possible what he said that
he had done when he heard the shot, the cry, the thud.</p>

<p>It was an ordeal for both, but they each of them bore out what
they had said as to their different stations at the different
times of the tragedy.</p>

<p>Pointer thanked them and went on by himself into Ingram's
room. It was the bedroom of a very orderly man. The only untidy
thing in the room was the bed, which showed that the sheet had
been hauled off without any regard as to what other bedclothes
were dragged on the carpet with it. Rather oddly so, Pointer
thought, considering that the man who was supposed to have
dragged it off would be supposed to want to sleep in that same
bed again. But it had been the top sheet, so, though the foot of
the bed was undone, the bolster and pillow end were apparently
untouched. Slipping his careful hands under the bolster, Pointer
found some shreds of tobacco; Player's Navy Cut. Yet Ingram's
waistcoat hung over the back of a chair by the armholes, and he
had no pipe in the room. Examining the waistcoat, Pointer found
some shreds of tobacco in the pocket where the tobacco pouch was
kept. He also found a very unusual long inner pocket on the left
hand side running down nearly to the bottom and closed at the top
by a zip fastener. It came well below the top of the waistcoat so
that it would not show, whether open or closed. Pointer examined
it very carefully. There was nothing in it now. The size was four
inches wide by nine long. It would hold quite a long envelope. He
put the waistcoat away in his attach case. The dust of that
peculiar pocket might tell what it usually held. Ingram's other
pockets held a handkerchief, a fountain pen, a book of stamps and
a small pencil stub. A letter case with letters of no importance,
a key ring with keys on it fastened by a chain, and some
money&mdash;under three pounds.</p>

<p>He rang for the butler. Since there was no sign of any books
or writing materials in the room, the chief inspector rightly
guessed that Ingram used some other room in the house as well.
But first Pointer wanted to see the footman who usually woke Mr.
Ingram and probably valeted him. Pointer had learned from Moy
that the staff consisted of two men and four women. Windover, a
fresh-faced young countryman, was summoned by the butler. He
waked Mr. Ingram at half-past seven every morning, he said, took
away his shoes and anything that needed brushing, and turned on
his bath.</p>

<p>Where did Mr. Ingram usually keep his waistcoat? Pointer asked
next. Windover fancied that it was under Mr. Ingram's pillow or
bolster, as it was never in sight of a morning. In the evenings,
Mr. Ingram would often leave it out. Now Pointer had noticed just
such another pocket down the back of Ingram's only pair of
evening trousers. He asked the two men whether either of them had
ever seen Mr. Ingram use it, or the inner one in his waistcoat.
Neither had. Nor had the footman ever found anything in those
particular pockets when he brushed either article of clothing.
Windover, however, closely questioned, seemed to be concealing
nothing and really to have nothing more to tell, so Pointer
followed the butler to the ground floor and into the library,
which he was told was given over to Mr. Ingram's sole use. Mr.
Ingram had last been seen by Hobbs sitting writing at the bureau
in the window when he brought him in, as usual, a decanter of
whisky and a siphon. Mr. Ingram was a very moderate drinker, the
butler added, generally asking for a small bottle of beer in
preference to anything stronger but occasionally, as last night,
whisky would be brought him. Mr. Ingram had told him to take it
away again and had seemed unwilling to be disturbed by even the
briefest of questions as to what he would prefer instead.</p>

<p>"He had that small clock over there down beside him on the
writing-table, sir, and motioned me when I came in not to come
closer," Hobbs went on. "Stopped me just by the door, and told me
he wouldn't want the whisky."</p>

<p>Was it usual for Mr. Ingram not to let him come up to him?
Pointer asked. The man said it was Ingram's invariable rule.</p>

<p>Questioned further, the butler could only say that Mr. Ingram
had no visitors last night as far as he knew, but in a household
of five young men who brought their friends in with them at all
hours, it was impossible for him to be sure on this point. As to
Mr. Ingram himself, the butler evidently had liked him
immensely. The same seemed to be true of all of the five
temporary owners of the house except of Tark. Of him the butler
could only say that he had a nasty silent way, which the maids
much resented, of showing when he did not like things. However,
bar that trifle, he had never served easier gentlemen than the
five. Yes, they all seemed to get on very pleasantly together.
Mr. Ingram and Mr. Gilmour too? Oh, certainly. The butler was
quite sure that up till last night, at any rate, there was no
slightest hint of ill-feeling between them.</p>

<p>The butler seemed to have been squeezed dry and Pointer let
him go, and began to go over the room inch by inch. Three pipes
lay neatly on the mantel, pipes that had smoked Navy Cut
recently. The top part of the writing bureau yielded nothing of
interest. Ingram apparently did not use the blotter except as an
underlay for his hand. On a copy of yesterday's late evening
paper was a candlestick with some drops of sealing wax on it. The
wax itself lay on another corner. So something had been sealed
since that paper came into the house. In the bottom drawer of the
bureau was a locked attach case. The lock was a most peculiar
one. Unpickable, Pointer fancied. Unlocking it with one of the
keys on Ingram's bunch, he found it chiefly filled with books
neatly strapped together and three piles of manuscripts.</p>

<p>The first was on <i>Baphomet of the Templars</i>. The second
consisted of the first seven chapters of a book on <i>The Law of
Rationality of Indices</i>. The third was the first volume,
finished apparently, of a work on cryptography. It dealt
exclusively with ciphers. Ingram seemed to be just finishing an
exposition of Dr. Blair's clever three dot system with sidelights
on an adaptation of the A.B.C. system in use during the war.</p>

<p>He stood awhile looking down at the pages. They seemed to have
been proof-read by some other hand, a sprawling, rather smudged
hand. Apparently the bundle was just about to be sent off to the
publishers...He examined the books. They were works on ciphers,
such as that of Andrew Langie Katscher, there was one on Lord
Bacon's famous two-letter cipher, a copy of Bacon's <i>De
Augmentis</i>...and many others, mostly on the same subject, or
on some mathematical point. He also found, last of all, two
dictionaries, one a Chambers, one a Nuttall's. Opening them he
found beside many words a dot or a collection of dots. The
compiler of a cryptogram might well have made them. That was all,
barring some notes on <i>The Theoretical Measurements of
Angles</i>.</p>

<p>Pointer stood a moment deep in thought. Was the motive for
Ingram's death, if it were, as he thought it might be, a murder,
to be found in this attach case which had been so carefully
locked? Was it possible that he had been killed for the sake of a
clever cipher? Had he by chance stumbled on one like, or
sufficiently like, one in use by some foreign power, or great
business interest, to make it necessary to remove him? It seemed
rather a melodramatic idea for the present day, but so was the
notion of murder.</p>

<p>Ingram's despatch case was laid beside the one which Pointer
had brought to the house with him. He passed on to the fireplace.
In the open grate was the remains of a wood fire. On the tiles
inside the fender were some burned matches evidently pitched
there by a smoker. Three were like the ones on the mantel, two
were of a different kind taken from a match booklet. There was no
such booklet among Ingram's belongings. The carved oak fender was
moveable and, lifting it out, he found underneath it, as though
blown there by the draught, some little scraps of paper with
words or parts of words printed in Ingram's writing. They were
quite fresh. The paper had been torn so small that none of them
held more than four letters on it. Each scrap was carefully
collected and put away in an envelope.</p>

<p>He next turned to the waste-paper basket. It had a lot of odds
and ends of paper in it but someone had knocked the dottle of his
pipe over all, presumably Ingram, since it was still the same
tobacco. He stood looking at it thoughtfully. Then his eyes went
back to the bureau. Its was odd. The bureau had been searched, of
that he was quite sure by many a little sign, things laid where
there was dust beneath them, dustless vacant places...the outline
of a rubber in one place and the rubber itself in another...the
very way the papers were put together told the experienced eye of
a good searcher that all these had been gone through. But not the
basket...Whoever had been hunting here was looking for something
which they were sure would not be thrown away; something of
value. The basket stood where it was impossible to be overlooked.
Pointer added its contents, too, to his collection, and continued
on around the room.</p>

<p>In the seat of an armchair beside the bureau he found a bus
ticket. It was for a Fulham-Sloane Street stretch. It was rolled
into a tight squill. That too he took. Then he left the room. The
door remained unlocked, but one of his men was placed in an
inconspicuous position in another room through whose wide open
door he could watch the library. Pointer wanted to know if anyone
in the household had been interrupted in their hunt for anything,
and would resume it if they thought that the coast was clear.</p>

<p>He asked for a word with Moy again. They went into the
dining-room, a huge and spacious place where, in a corner by the
fire, no one could overhear them.</p>

<p>"It's about Miss Pratt," Pointer said, "and Mr. Gilmour."</p>

<p>Moy broke in. "I've been wanting to tell you about her, chief
inspector. It would be so easy, even for you, to get quite a
mistaken idea of how things are. Ingram, poor chap, was in love
with her, so is Haliburton, but as for Gilmour, as Miss Pratt
said, he's all but engaged to another girl who is also staying
here, a girl called Alfreda Longstaff. Just at present she's
angry at the idea of getting into the newspapers and, of course,
Gilmour will be in the spot-light for a while. That can't be
helped. But though Miss Pratt is evidently kinder-hearted than
discreet, I can assure you that all of Gilmour's heart and
attentions were devoted to his own girl."</p>

<p>Pointer said that he had got that, and then asked how the
household now at The Tall House had got itself together. By
which, he explained that he meant who had proposed the plan in
the first place.</p>

<p>"Frederick Ingram," Moy said promptly. "Because he knew his
brother Charles wanted to please Miss Pratt who had said she'd
like immensely to stop in a really fine old London house for a
few weeks, not just for a few days."</p>

<p>"And Frederick Ingram is by profession?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>Moy hesitated for the fraction of a second. But there was no
use trying to make Frederick out a man of substance held in high
esteem in the best clubs. He acknowledged that he was a
bookmaker's partner for a season. By original profession he was
an architect who did very badly and tried to turn his hand to
many things since he left Oxford. His mother died when he was a
lad and left him originally a much larger fortune than eventually
came to his elder half-brother from their father.</p>

<p>"Where did he live?"</p>

<p>"All over the place," Moy said. He went on to explain that
most of the time Frederick lived with his half-sister, Mrs.
Appleton, or had lived with the Appletons, paying his share of
their little house in Markham Square, but that he, Moy,
understood him to say that he had left there some months ago and
taken rooms in Hampstead. Since Charles had come to The Tall
House for five weeks, Moy believed that Frederick had gone back
to Markham Square in order to be nearer his brother.</p>

<p>Markham Square, Pointer reflected, was off Fulham Road. Anyone
living there and wanting to take a bus to The Tall House would
use just such a ticket as he had found. As for Appleton, Pointer
learned that Edward Appleton had once been a well-known actor,
that Miss Ingram had married him&mdash;he was a distant
connection of the Ingrams&mdash;just before he came into quite a
little fortune, on which he had left the stage and appeared to
have gone the pace a bit. Certainly very little of the fortune
seemed to be left. There were two children of the marriage.
Appleton had been raising, or trying to raise, money lately on
his life insurance, Ingram had learned, but that was securely
tied up.</p>

<p>"Look here, chief inspector," Moy broke out, "you don't think
there's anything wrong about this shooting, do you? Some of your
questions seem to me a bit wide sweeping."</p>

<p>"In case it should turn out different from what you think,
it's always just as well to have all preliminary questions over
and cleared up," Pointer said evasively. "And now, I'd like to
see Miss Longstaff."</p>

<p>Moy looked worried. "She's not herself at all this morning,"
he repeated and left it at that.</p>

<p>Pointer rather expected to see a case of wrecked nerves, but
the girl who came in almost immediately did not look as though
she knew the meaning of the word. She explained at once that,
though she had come to the house as Mr. Gilmour's guest, there
was no question of any closer relationship growing up between
them.</p>

<p>"Mr. Moy told me that it would prejudice you against Mr.
Gilmour to be told that," she wound up. "I don't see why." She
fixed that baffling stare of hers on the chief inspector.</p>

<p>He had a feeling that he was seeing her in some moment of
triumph, and yet her face struck him as fierce and starved and
repressed all at once. Three dangerous ingredients to mix
together. As far as words went, she was very controlled. Of
course she did not disbelieve Mr. Gilmour's account of what had
happened, she said, it was corroborated by Mr. Moy, but she had
no intention whatever of marrying the man to whom such a
misfortune had happened.</p>

<p>"Once unlucky, always unlucky, I think," she said with a
curious little smile. "I really couldn't marry an unlucky
man."</p>

<p>"Am I to understand that you and Mr. Gilmour were engaged
then, until the death of Mr. Ingram this morning?" Pointer asked
stolidly.</p>

<p>"Not at all," she replied at once. "We weren't engaged at all.
He asked me to stay here for a fortnight, while Mrs. Pratt would
be here, and I don't deny that the idea on his part
was&mdash;that after my visit, I might perhaps agree to marry
him. I think Miss Pratt's stay in the house here suggested the
scheme to him. The agreement was that I should have a little time
in which to make up my mind. It's quite made up now."</p>

<p>"When did you first meet Mr. Gilmour?" Pointer asked. And she
explained, a trifle hastily, that they had met at her father's
rectory. Questioned as to what she herself had heard of the
tragedy, she said that she was awakened by a shot and a cry, and
rushed downstairs as soon as she had collected her startled
wits.</p>

<p>Pointer was rather surprised that she, or any woman, would
have known that it was a shot that she had heard, for Gilmour's
automatic would make but a comparatively small pop, not anything
like as loud in the front of the house on an upper story as a car
backfiring, and her bedroom was at the other end of a side
wing.</p>

<p>"Why did you draw the sheet out from around and under Mr.
Ingram?" Pointer asked next in his most official voice.</p>

<p>Miss Longstaff shot him an odd look from those impenetrable
eyes of hers.</p>

<p>"Oh, just the natural impulse to cover up a dead body," she
said, still eyeing him with that blank but by no means
meaningless stare of hers. Had she picked anything up in the
corridor, he asked her next. She said that she had looked at the
automatic before handing it to Moy. She had seen no spent
cartridge case. Pointer asked her to describe exactly how the
sheet had been wrapped about the body, and the position of the
body itself. Her account tallied with Moy's but was much more
detailed. She had a most unusually accurate eye for details,
Pointer saw. He left the question of the sheet and asked her
about the dead man, but she seemed to have no knowledge of him
except from her stay here at The Tall House, and nothing helpful
to say about him. Yet he was certain that something was stirring
in her connected with the death. If so, she refused to let him
catch hold of it. Whenever he thought that he was getting close,
she would dive from sight with it down into deep water again.
Finally he thanked her, and, with an ironic little acknowledgment
of his thanks, she left him.</p>

<p>A dangerous young woman to a detective just now, he thought,
for she was keen on some purpose of her own, and quite capable,
he believed, of putting a false clue down, or taking a real one
away, as suited her own plans. She was mentally agile too, for
Pointer had been clever with his questions. Both by nature and by
training he knew how to ask the one slight query which, added to
one previous little question, would make a quite unexpectedly
complete answer.</p>

<p>He stood staring down at his shoe-tips after she had gone,
rocking himself backwards and forwards deep in thought. Was she
in the crime itself, if a crime had been committed here? Even
Pointer could not yet say, but if this was a crime, it might very
possibly be one into which malice entered, and certainly Alfreda
Longstaff could not be set on one side in that case.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER 8</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER saw Mrs. Pratt next. She struck him as a
woman of great force of character. Also of unusual energy. She
seemed to have some difficulty in knowing, or at least in saying,
just what she did think of the dreadful event. Pointer got the
impression that, provided her daughter took it sensibly, it would
rank as a wise decree of Providence, though very sad and
dreadfully pathetic, of course. But if her daughter lost her head
still further, then Mrs. Pratt would look on Ingram's death as an
act of God ranking with plague, pestilence and earthquakes. She
struck Pointer as being more on edge, tenser, than he would have
expected. Where her daughter was concerned he could understand
it, but that would only be connected with Gilmour, one would
think, whereas she seemed, to the astute and penetrating brain
studying her, to be most in tension where Ingram was concerned.
More than that he could not gather from his brief talk. Mrs.
Pratt was an experienced wielder of shields, and turned his
cleverest points aside with nimbleness. She had hardly left him
when the door was opened and in darted the lovely girl he had
seen before, but now in something jade green and white which made
her look more like an exquisite flower than ever. She was still
all exclamations, all protests.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's not guilty! He never did it! He never meant it!"</p>

<p>"Who says he's guilty?" he asked quietly. She checked herself
and stared at him.</p>

<p>"Why, my mother says that everyone says&mdash;I thought he
acknowledges that he shot Mr. Ingram&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By accident, yes," he finished.</p>

<p>"And of course it was an accident," she protested again, with
that air of defying the world to say it was not, that seemed so
utterly uncalled for. She made a bad impression. It might be but
the result of some nerve-storm, but she certainly protested too
much. Was it love defending, or its opposite suggesting? She fled
out again as swiftly as she had entered. Pointer looked after
her. If her looks covered a criminal, there was nothing in them
to suggest a pioneer, a high flyer. Pointer would expect always
to find Winnie Pratt on the beaten path whether that path were
the right one or the wrong one.</p>

<p>Tark came next. His face would have arrested any detective's
interest at once, it was so intentionally impenetrable, his eyes
so studiously blank, his mouth suggested so rigid a curb. He gave
his answers as briefly as possible. He was a mining engineer by
profession, he said, but he had been at a loose end for some
years, owing to the closing down of some mines in Russia. He was
born in Beausoleil, aged thirty-seven, the son of the Curator of
the Duke of Monaco's Deep Sea Museum. He remained docketed in
Pointer's mind as the man with the coldest eyes and the tightest
lips that he had met for some time. It was a very determined
face, nevertheless, with its hint of utter callousness to human
emotions. It was the face of a man of no nerves, who would hardly
know the meaning of the word fear. He claimed to know nothing of
the dead man and never even to have seen him until his visit
here, except for a chance meeting at Haliburton's flat.</p>

<p>Haliburton came next. He explained about himself and Tark with
his usual air of quiet frankness. Tark was at The Tall House
simply and solely as his friend, he said. Like Tark, Haliburton
seemed to take it for granted that Ingram's death was, as Gilmour
said, the result of a terrible accident. A taxi drew up as he was
talking. Pointer had expected the dead man's sister or
brother-in-law before this. He knew that Moy had notified them of
the accident as soon as the police had been telephoned for.</p>

<p>Now he saw a neatly-dressed woman get out and glance up at the
house with dark eyes full of horror. It was Mrs. Appleton.
Pointer went to the door to meet her. She came in with a look of
almost unbearable anxiety, and hardly listened to the chief
inspector's brief introduction of himself and his few words of
grave sympathy.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>He told her.</p>

<p>A look of relief swept over her face. "I see," she said,
drawing a deep breath. "Poor Charles! Poor Charles!"</p>

<p>Moy came down the stairs murmuring in his turn some
expressions of sincere sympathy.</p>

<p>"Were you there&mdash;when it happened?" she asked, catching
at some word of his that seemed to bear that meaning.</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"Do you mind telling me again just how it happened?" she
asked, and resting her hands on a little occasional table in the
hall beside her, she listened very intently. When he had done she
asked:</p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Gilmour? I want to see him."</p>

<p>Moy was afraid of a scene. Something in the woman's face
suggested nerves that had been, if they were not now, strung up
very tensely. He temporized.</p>

<p>"He feels it terribly&mdash;naturally. He's not fit to be
questioned much and give coherent replies, I'm afraid, Mrs.
Appleton."</p>

<p>"Of course I want to hear what he has to say! You didn't
really see how it happened! Of course I must know! Charles was my
only brother."</p>

<p>She did not seem to rank Frederick as even half a brother. On
her face the look of terrified anxiety that had been there when
she hurried into The Tall House was returning in part.</p>

<p>"Shall I ask him to come down here?" Moy turned to Pointer,
who nodded. While they were alone he did not speak to Mrs.
Appleton, who stood staring down at the table as though some map
were spread out on it, and she were trying to find her way by
it.</p>

<p>When Gilmour came in, he stood for a moment in the doorway, an
expression in his brown eyes that was at once dumbly pleading and
heartbroken.</p>

<p>Mrs. Appleton came to what seemed like natural life for the
first time since Pointer had seen her. She took Gilmour's hand
very warmly.</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Gilmour! How terrible for you! But please tell me
exactly what happened. Forgive my asking you to speak of it so
soon, but I must know. I <i>must!</i>" For a second her voice
shook, and Pointer saw her bite her lip hard.</p>

<p>Gilmour drew a deep breath. "I fired what I thought was a
blank shot full at him, Mrs. Appleton," he began brokenly,
"and&mdash;and I killed him. There was some mistake. The
cartridge was loaded&mdash;not blank."</p>

<p>"But what was he doing?" she asked, as though groping in a
mist.</p>

<p>He explained about the dressing up as a ghost. "Charles?" she
said in a tone of utter bewilderment. "Dress up and play a joke
of that kind!"</p>

<p>He repeated the explanation that he had given the chief
inspector, and a little of her amazed look passed off. "Yes,
that's quite a possible reason..." she murmured. "Testing a
theory...? Poor Mr. Gilmour!" she repeated gently, and her face
looked as though some terrible weight had slipped from shoulders
that could hardly bear it. "Thank you for telling me everything.
There are still lots of questions that I want to ask. Naturally.
But I don't think there's anything more I must know immediately."
She held out her hand, and Gilmour, taking it, thanked her with a
twisted sickly smile for her kindness and walked up the stairs as
though he could hardly lift his feet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Appleton turned to Moy.</p>

<p>"Can I see him? Is he&mdash;is he&mdash;much disfigured?"</p>

<p>Moy told her that the body was not in the house. He explained
about the necessity for an autopsy. "And there's another little
matter," he went on. "Have you any objection to my opening your
brother's will? It's still in my possession. It leaves everything
to you, as you know. Do you mind if I let the chief inspector
here see it at once?"</p>

<p>"The chief inspector? Oh, I took you for someone staying in
the house&mdash;for a friend of my brother's." A taut line showed
for an instant around Mrs. Appleton's well-cut, decisive mouth.
Pointer saw that she could be quite formidable on occasions, and
also that she had not heard one word of his own self-introduction.</p>

<p>"Of course the police have to look into it, Mrs. Appleton,"
Moy said soothingly, "and with a man of your brother's position,
since it is within the Metropolitan area, the Yard takes charge
of the investigation. Just as a precaution."</p>

<p>"Fortunately my brother's death is so evidently due only to a
terrible accident," she said, and immediately looked as though
she wished the words unsaid. Pointer took her to be a very
truthful and not particularly diplomatic woman. The relief in her
voice was the most interesting part of her remark.</p>

<p>"I'd like to sit a while and pull myself together," she said
now. "The room my brother used as a study is on this floor, isn't
it?" She turned to Moy who, after an assenting glance from the
chief inspector, opened the door of the study and closed it after
her.</p>

<p>"Well, really," he said in a low tone, coming back to the
chief inspector, "if I didn't know Mrs. Appleton, I should fancy
she was trying to get points as to how to shoot a person by
mistake. She seemed positively insatiable&mdash;couldn't seem to
have the account of how it happened told her often enough."</p>

<p>Pointer waited for three minutes by the clock while Moy talked
on, then:</p>

<p>"I want another word with her," he said in an equally low
tone, and walking lightly across the hall's thick runner, he
opened the door of the library and stepped in. Moy followed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Appleton was leaning far out of the window. She turned
her head over her shoulder and with no sign of emotion, drew back
into the room.</p>

<p>"I was smelling the heliotrope in the window boxes," she said.
"I love flowers. Well, I feel better now. I think I'll go home.
My husband wanted to come, but as he had a most important
engagement, I wouldn't let him put it off. The children will be
wondering what has become of me. How they will miss their uncle!"
With a little bow, she went on out and they heard the front door
close behind her before Moy could get to it.</p>

<p>"She was very attached to Ingram, I know," Moy said. "She's a
domestic sort of person anyway. Devoted to her home and her
family, whether brother, or husband and children."</p>

<p>"Devoted to flowers, too," Pointer murmured dryly, and Moy
looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>Pointer had decided to take the young solicitor into his
confidence to a certain extent. As far as Moy could help him,
that was to say. Even if guilty, there were certain facts which
the criminal could not now alter. Supposing there was a crime
here, and even supposing Moy was connected with it, which Pointer
did not suppose, knowledge of how the inquiry progresses is often
of no use whatever to the criminal, who cannot change the past
nor alter the traces left by it.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she thinks cigarette ash helps flowers to grow,"
Pointer indicated a Majolica saucer which he had last seen full
of cigarette ash. "I have quite a lot of the ash that was there
done up in an envelope. The rest is now on the window-box. She's
shifted that blotting pad, too. But the paper basket hasn't been
touched..."</p>

<p>"Those books, too." Moy followed the other's keen eyes. "Yes,
they've been shifted. Every one of them. Ingram always kept the
line forward, so that the backs projected over the shelves.
They're all back now against the wall behind them."</p>

<p>They had been pushed back when Pointer had seen them before.
It only confirmed his belief that the room had been searched
before he got to The Tall House. But he had a test of his own as
to whether Mrs. Appleton had also gone through them.</p>

<p>"I put slips of paper in at page twenty in six of these books,
beginning with the first and taking every tenth on this row. I
wonder if they're still there."</p>

<p>Two of the slips were in the paper basket. The others had
either not yet been touched, he thought, or had been put back at
random.</p>

<p>What was she looking for? Both men speculated. A later will
cutting her out? But some of the books were too short to take a
sheet of paper the length of the usual will. Whatever she had
been looking for, again in her case, it seemed to be something
which she felt sure would not be in the paper basket; it was
odd&mdash;taken in conjunction with her manner of seeming
relieved&mdash;immensely&mdash;by the account of how her brother
had been killed.</p>

<p>Pointer believed Ingram might have sent some letter or parcel
off by late registered post from the sealing-wax and candle on
the late evening paper. But he had not yet found any registration
slip. Was this what was being hunted for? And hunted for by
several people?</p>

<p>Pointer next interviewed the servants. He learned that the
front door had been left unbolted last night. The butler never
bolted it, but the last in of the five usually saw to it, though
it had been forgotten once before&mdash;by Mr. Haliburton, who
had assured the butler that he would be more careful in future.
The fact, therefore, did not amount to much, for supposing there
were a crime here, a murderer with any sense, if a member of the
household, would have taken the elementary precaution of undoing
the door so as to suggest an outsider. But there was also the
fact that Ingram had sat on working in the library last night
after the others had gone to bed.</p>

<p>It would have been quite easy for him to have stepped out, and
drawn the bolts back and admitted anyone. Did his sister think,
or know, that he had, and was that why she had tipped the
cigarette ash out into the window box so that it could not be
identified?</p>

<p>Apart from the fact of the door being found unbolted this
morning, there was one other interesting piece of information
that came to the chief inspector. The second housemaid told him
that last night, while crossing the landing, she saw Mr. Ingram
and Mrs. Pratt meet, on their way out to the car with the others
for a dinner to which all were going. Mrs. Pratt had said
something very low and very quickly to Ingram as thought not
wanting to be overheard. But the maid's sharp ears had caught the
final sentence. "Please be Sure and burn it." Mr. Ingram had
nodded and said what looked like words of reassurance and
agreement. He looked very grave and very disturbed, the housemaid
thought. Where exactly had this meeting taken place? Just outside
Miss Longstaff's door, the maid said. Miss Longstaff was still in
her room, she thought, but she could not be sure. As for the bus
ticket, the housemaids had found similar ones several times
before and all during this last week. And always in the morning,
when there had been no known visitor to account for it in the
evening. The butler added one more time during the day when a
similar ticket had been left on a wine tray after Mr. Frederick
Ingram had been in.</p>

<p>Pointer asked for another word with Mrs. Pratt when he had
finished with the servants.</p>

<p>"What exactly did you ask Mr. Ingram last night to burn?" He
put the question without any preamble, as soon as he had closed
the door behind himself.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?" she asked as though hard of hearing.
Pointer repeated his question.</p>

<p>"Oh, a ridiculous doggerel I had written about some theory of
his, to do with circles and squaring them," she explained
lightly. "It really was such silly stuff that I didn't want it
lying around and read by everyone who might think that I fancied
such rhyme poetry!" She smiled pleasantly at Pointer.</p>

<p>"When had you written it?" he asked, as though chatting.</p>

<p>"A few days ago," was the airy reply. Mrs. Pratt evidently did
not intend to be pinned down to hours.</p>

<p>"By the way, have you seen Mrs. Appleton this morning?"
Pointer asked next.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes. "Who's Mrs. Appleton, pray?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Ingram's sister. I had an idea&mdash;" Pointer's tone
expressed surprise that the two did not know each other, but
either Mrs. Pratt was a splendid actress or she really had not
even heard the name before, and thanking her, Pointer opened the
door for her.</p>

<p>Those burned papers in the library fireplace, were they the
result of this talk? Was it for them that someone had searched
the room this morning before the police arrived and was it for
them that Mrs. Appleton was looking? It was because of the
similarity in the double search that Pointer had asked Mrs. Pratt
whether she knew the sister of the dead man.</p>

<p>There was a ring at the front door. Pointer went on out. A
short, rather round-shouldered, slender, young man was stepping
in with the air of one of the family. Moy hurried past with
outstretched hand. This was no moment to stay on personal likes
or dislikes. After a few words of horror and regret he turned and
introduced the chief inspector to Frederick Ingram. Had he been a
horse, or a dog, the chief inspector would not have bought him.
Frederick Ingram had a treacherous eye.</p>

<p>Frederick listened now with an appearance of deep grief to
Moy's account of how his brother had met his end. Then he moved
towards the library.</p>

<p>"As his literary executor, I take possession of all his
papers, of course. I think I'll have them removed <i>en bloc</i>
to my rooms at Hampstead."</p>

<p>"All of them?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I needn't burden myself with all," Frederick
said promptly, with the air of a man conferring a favor. "I'll
make a selection." He walked on into the room. Pointer and Moy
followed.</p>

<p>"The work I was correcting of his was locked in a case in the
bottom drawer. If you'll hand me over his keys I'll take it along
for one thing&mdash;and his letter case and so on...I'd better
have those too..." He spoke carelessly, but his small eyes darted
round the room in a very searching look as he bent over the
pigeon-holes. For a second he ran through their contents then he
turned. "The keys?" he said pleasantly.</p>

<p>"They're at the Yard," Pointer said as pleasantly and as
carelessly. "Just for the moment, of course. They and the attach
case."</p>

<p>Frederick's smile turned into a mere show of teeth. But he
said nothing.</p>

<p>"You were here last night," Pointer went on, remembering the
bus ticket. "Did Mr. Ingram seem just as usual?"</p>

<p>Frederick Ingram said nothing for a moment, merely went on
turning over some papers in his hand.</p>

<p>"Just," he said, laying them down and turning round. He had
pleasant manners as a rule. The trouble with Frederick was that
when they were not pleasant they were so very much the other
way.</p>

<p>Now if ever a loosely hung mouth spoke of garrulity, this
young man's did, but not even Tark's tight lips could have
answered the chief inspector's question more briefly. There was a
short silence.</p>

<p>"I take it that my brother's papers&mdash;and keys&mdash;will
be handed to me as soon as all the usual formalities have been
complied with?" he asked the chief inspector, who said that he
should have them back as soon as possible. "I think I ought to go
through them to see if there's anything missing. Among his
papers, that is..." Frederick went on.</p>

<p>Pointer said that if Mr. Ingram would use his, the chief
inspector's car, he would be taken to Scotland Yard and shown all
the papers belonging to Mr. Ingram.</p>

<p>"I can soon tell you if anything is missing," Frederick
promised.</p>

<p>"Do, and we'll send them, as soon as we've done with them, to
Markham Square." Pointer seemed to be finishing the interview on
a note of meeting the other's wishes as far as possible.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;eh&mdash;Hampstead, please. I only stopped with my
sister while running in and out of here, as I had to do several
times a week. After this terrible tragedy, I shall go back to my
own digs."</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Appleton is her brother's chief legatee, and also an
executrix. I think it might be as well if you and she worked
through them together with Mr. Moy," Pointer persisted.</p>

<p>"But surely I'm his literary executor," spluttered Frederick,
turning indignantly to Moy who shook his head.</p>

<p>"He's left a bequest to the Author's Society and asks the
secretary to appoint a regular literary agent to act in that
'capacity&mdash;we to settle the remuneration," Moy murmured.</p>

<p>"Still&mdash;even so," Frederick went on as though in anger,
"even so, there will be all sorts of family papers and so on that
my sister won't be competent to deal with. I'll just look through
what you've taken, chief inspector, let you know if any are
missing, and then we can talk over what had better be done with
what's left."</p>

<p>He was clearly in a hurry to see the papers.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Appleton seemed to miss nothing," Pointer threw in
casually.</p>

<p>Instantly the little dark eyes fairly snapped as they looked
at him.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed? My sister has been here, has she? Gone through
his papers?"</p>

<p>"She probably did when she was here in the library," the chief
inspector seemed to think that of no importance.</p>

<p>"She was in here? When?" There was something very attentive in
Frederick's voice and face.</p>

<p>Pointer explained how Mrs. Appleton had gone into the room to
recover after coming to the house. Frederick's eyes had a gleam
in them as he said good-by rather abruptly.</p>

<p>At the Yard he went through everything very carefully after
asking to be left to himself&mdash;he put it that he need not
detain anyone as he would ring when he had finished, he knew how
busy the Yard always were, etc. They seemed charmed with his
thoughtfulness, and one pair of eyes was on him throughout his
careful but most painstaking search. When every paper had been
unfolded and shaken out, every envelope searched, he had locked
the case again and laid the keys on top of it. Then he sat a
moment smoking a cigarette with what looked like a frown of
concentration on his face.</p>

<p>He took quite a brisk walk along the embankment until he made
his way by tube to Chelsea, and to Markham Square. Here, in a
little two-story house that looked on to one of the melancholy
cats' gardens of town, he rang a bell. The outside of the house
might be dingy, but inside everything glittered, and it was a
very efficient-looking elderly woman who greeted him with a smile
of acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Mr. Appleton's in, Mr. Fred. He's been 'phoning you, so I
think he expects you."</p>

<p>He walked on past her into a neat but cold room.</p>

<p>"Please excuse there being no fire. It's gone out and I
haven't had time to lay it again yet. We're upset with Mr.
Ingram's dreadful death. Dreadful to think of! His own friend
to've done it! And him being all dressed-up as a ghost makes it
seem worse, somehow." She was shedding her prim "official" manner
as she spoke. Fred stared at her for a second as though he
wondered impatiently of what she was talking, his narrow little
head, the head of a man who would always prefer to gain his ends
by scheming, rather than by force, a little aslant, as he
murmured some brief acknowledgment. The next moment the door was
swung open with a certain deliberate regal air and there stood
Appleton. And he stood a full minute framed in the cream painted
doorway staring at his brother-in-law with his head thrown back,
an eyeglass fixed in one rather wrinkled eye, before, with an
effect of some spiritual meaning in the physical act, he took a
step into the room and, still staring at Fred, closed the door
behind him without shifting his steady gaze.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER 9</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER had got from Moy&mdash;to that young
man's bewildered curiosity&mdash;the name of the painters and
decorators who had last done up The Tall House. At the shop in
question, he produced the piece of torn paper which he had picked
up from the carpet where Ingram's dead body had lain. The
cream-colored scrap was a torn fragment of wall paper printed in
tones of dun, blue and heliotrope. It had lain in the passage with
its reverse side uppermost.</p>

<p>The firm stocked no such papers, he was told. The foreman, who
had worked at The Tall House, could further assure the chief
inspector that nowhere there&mdash;not in any cupboard, nor on
any wall, had paper been hung. All throughout was paint, or
distemper, or paneling; and had been so for the last twenty
years.</p>

<p>The scrap shown him was, he thought, about ten years old. Very
cheap in quality, and put on with cheap paste. It must have dried
away from its wall&mdash;some chimney breast he would suggest,
and have been loose some considerable time. A couple of months
wouldn't be too long. As to its makers, he could only shake his
head. A cheap old pattern that would not be found anywhere in
stock today. Of that he felt sure.</p>

<p>The two detective officers went on to the Yard together, and
there Pointer decked his subordinate in a sheet which was the
exact duplicate of the one which, with a hole shot through it, he
had at the moment in his locked attach case. The hole on this,
the experimental one, was marked with red ink.</p>

<p>The chief inspector worked hard draping the linen on the
mystified Watts now in this way, now in that. He had him lie
down, he had him sit up, he had him walk about, or stand at ease.
Finally he took the sheet off and handed it to the other.</p>

<p>"Suppose you try it by yourself. You're about Ingram's height.
How would you put that sheet around yourself if you wanted to
dress up as a ghost. Remember Gilmour says that it more or less
covered the body and came down over the head to below the
chin."</p>

<p>Watts flung it around himself in a quick swirl, and drew one
end over his face, hanging loose at the lower edge. Pointer
nodded.</p>

<p>"Just so. That's how I've been trying to do it. Now don't
duck, this is the fatal shot!" and he flung something light and
sticky at the other. Watts could feel it strike fair and square
in the center of his forehead.</p>

<p>"Do I give a screech here and topple over, sir?" he asked. He
could not see the other's face, only the floor in front of his
feet.</p>

<p>Pointer's hand raised the loose end.</p>

<p>"No good. You've done no better than I. The point is this: I
want you to see if your ingenuity can devise some way of wearing
that thing that will bring it fairly round your body, over your
head and over your face below your chin, and yet let a shot which
hits you bang in the forehead make a hole only four inches in
from the edge. Personally I don't, and didn't, think it could be
done. But have another try. Or you might drape it on me."</p>

<p>"Might as well drape it on the Cenotaph, sir." For Pointer was
well over six feet, though he did not look his height. "But this
really is a teaser! I don't often feel as certain that a chap is
telling the truth as I do with Gilmour...let me have another go
at it this way..." and again and again Watts turned himself into
a mannequin and pulled and twisted while Pointer flung the fatal
shot of dyed putty. All to no good, the putty would not mark
within a foot of the red outlined shot hole.</p>

<p>"I didn't think of that at the time," Watts said finally, "but
it can't be done, that's plain."</p>

<p>It had been plain to Pointer from the first, and he believed
that it had been plain to Miss Longstaff too. Or so he read her
manner when he had spoken to her about the sheet.</p>

<p>"You see, sir," he said a little later to the assistant
commissioner when finishing his account of what he had found at
The Tall House, "the trouble is that the body was left in the
passage for five or ten minutes with no one watching it. Mr.
Gilmour, Mr. Haliburton and Mr. Moy were all concerned with
telephoning for a doctor or the police. The result is that the
sheet found lying on the body when I arrived may not be the
original sheet worn by Mr. Ingram as a 'ghost' at all."</p>

<p>"What makes you doubt it?" Major Pelham asked.</p>

<p>"The hole doesn't fit his story, sir." Pointer went into
details. "What it fits is an idea that Mr. Ingram was shot in his
bed, lying down with the sheet drawn up to just cover his face.
The hole fits that perfectly, given the marks of the tuck-in at
the end, and Ingram's height."</p>

<p>"No scorch marks on it?" Pelham was interested.</p>

<p>"If he was shot in his bed, we may possibly find that a piece
of asbestos was put over the linen sheet. There is some in the
housemaid's pantry, used for an ironing stand. But it's a very
small revolver, sir. Even without any asbestos there would have
been very little scorching if anyone had fired from even the foot
of the bed."</p>

<p>"You think Gilmour's lying, then?"</p>

<p>"He speaks and looks like an honest young fellow, but his
story doesn't fit the hole. It may not be the same sheet. Someone
may have purposely substituted one that won't hang together with
his explanation. It would have been a simple matter to burn a
hole of the right size in another sheet, and then change them. It
could even have been done in the time that the door of Ingram's
room was shut with Ingram's body lying just outside. In fact, if
any substitution has taken place it was probably done then."</p>

<p>"And the sheet Ingram really wore?"</p>

<p>"May have been disposed of in some way. Packed with articles
of clothing. We have no power to search for it, of course. Or
handed to someone outside the house. The one person known to have
laid a sheet over Ingram, the sheet in my attach case, is also
the same person who stood watching from the one window that shows
the opposite pavement." He explained about the blind and Miss
Longstaff.</p>

<p>"She knew about that hole, of that I've no doubt," Pointer
went on, "though whether merely from sharp powers of observation
or not, I can't say."</p>

<p>"She's the girl Gilmour is in love with, isn't she?" Pelham
glanced at the notes.</p>

<p>"She is, sir. But she's by no means the girl who's in love
with Mr. Gilmour," Pointer said dryly and again explained about
Miss Pratt.</p>

<p>"Odd," Pelham thought, "now if the girls were reversed one
could understand some act of revenge...that sort of thing...but
apparently that doesn't fit."</p>

<p>"Apparently not, sir," Pointer agreed.</p>

<p>"And what about the cartridge being loaded when he thought it
was blank, what about that?"</p>

<p>"Anyone could have substituted a live cartridge, sir. Mr.
Gilmour placed the automatic, after loading it, in an unlocked
bureau drawer in his bedroom late yesterday evening, before he
went on to a theater with the ladies of the house party."</p>

<p>"How about alibis? Anything possible in that line?"</p>

<p>There was not. Everyone in the house claimed to have been in
his own bedroom and in bed long before the time that they were
all disturbed by Gilmour's shot and the subsequent cry. The
whereabouts of the trio of the dead man's sister, half-brother
and brother-in-law was not yet established.</p>

<p>"Has all the look of a pretty nasty little plot," Pelham
murmured with a grimace, "and perhaps directed as much against
Gilmour as against Ingram. Unless it's really entirely aimed at
Gilmour, and the author of it didn't care a hang who was fired at
with that first shot, so long as it would place Gilmour in the
dock on a charge of murder. He's in an appalling
position&mdash;if innocent. And he certainly could have hit on
some quieter, simpler, method of making away with Ingram than in
this public way. He and Ingram were climbing in the Peak country
only last month, I've learned."</p>

<p>"Plenty of openings there for an enterprising young man,"
Pointer agreed with a smile&mdash;he himself was a fine rock
climber.</p>

<p>"Anything to make you suspect a crime besides the hole in the
sheet which is too near the hem?" Pelham asked after a little
pause.</p>

<p>"Several curious odds and ends, sir."</p>

<p>Pointer explained that the dead man's bureau had quite
evidently&mdash;to Pointer&mdash;been searched, though not the
paper basket. That it looked as though Mr. Ingram had sent off a
sealed letter or package, unless it had been taken. Finally
Pointer came to the specks of pipe tobacco under Ingram's
bolster, though his pouch and pipe were in the ground floor
library.</p>

<p>"And that means?" Pelham started a fresh cigar.</p>

<p>"It looks as though the someone who had searched, or stolen
from, the waistcoat, did not know of his habit of placing it
under his pillow. Or rather, didn't know that we would at once
learn of it, and so had hung the waistcoat over the back of a
chair to prevent us from guessing that it had held anything of
importance." Pointer went on to speak of the curious long inner
pocket in it, and in the dead man's evening trousers.</p>

<p>"Couldn't Ingram have placed it under his pillow the night
before with whatever he sent off last night, by post or by
hand...the something he sealed, you think? Isn't it possible the
maid was slovenly, and didn't make the bed properly?"</p>

<p>"The housekeeper told me the sheets in the house were only
changed once a week, but yesterday was the day for changing them,
and the sheets themselves bore out her words. They were quite
fresh from the laundry."</p>

<p>"Ingram would hardly have undressed and gone to bed, placing
his waistcoat in security, and then decided&mdash;for some
reason, some spasm of distrust or fear&mdash;to send off what was
in the pocket, have got up, removed the waistcoat, taken out the
contents, disposed of it&mdash;or them&mdash;and then gone back
to bed hanging his waistcoat on his chair now that it was no
longer of importance?" Pelham asked.</p>

<p>Pointer had thought of this, but it seemed to him, as he said,
that for Ingram to have again got up and played the
ghost&mdash;supposing Gilmour to be telling the
truth&mdash;seemed rather erratic behavior on the part of a young
man of very quiet, very routine habits. If Gilmour was not
telling the truth, and Ingram had not played the ghost, still
this idea meant that Ingram had gone to bed, then got up again
and dealt with the mysterious valuable thing in his possession,
and then returned to bed and had time to fall soundly asleep
before he was shot. All that left rather too little time, Pointer
thought. Unless something else suggested it, he thought it
simpler to assume that someone else, rather than Ingram, had hung
that waistcoat on the chair. He went on next to speak of the
scraps of paper beneath the moveable oak curb. "I handed the lot
to Mr. Twyford-Brees just now," the chief inspector named one of
the cipher experts of the Foreign Office Intelligence Department,
"as Mr. Ingram was so good at ciphers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A perfect genius at them," Pelham said.</p>

<p>"Mr. Twyford-Brees promptly got together two little groups of
three words each, which he thinks might mean that they are part
of some tri-lingual cipher," Pointer went on.</p>

<p>"Ingram specialized in foreign ciphers," came from Pelham as
he stretched his hand out for two sheets of glass fastened
together around their edges with adhesive tape. Between the glass
were gummed two groups of three words each. They were:</p>

<pre> VON and HELL OF      LIGHT DE      CLAIRE </pre>

<p>"All the words were printed in characters, sir. And there are
some more bits which Mr. Twyford-Brees thinks he may make
something of."</p>

<p>Pelham looked musingly at the paper. "Ciphers...humph...Anyone
in the house whom you suspect of having been the searcher or
searchers of the library?"</p>

<p>"Before I got there? Well, Miss Longstaff doesn't strike me as
the sort of person to be prevented from any feeling of delicacy,
had she felt curious. And curious about that whole affair, she
certainly is. Then there's this Mr. Tark. He seems to've been
floating around rather freely. The butler ran into him on the
stairs that lead up past the library to the top of the house.
Miss Pratt says he was passing her door&mdash;which would be one
way down to the library&mdash;altogether, I shouldn't be
surprised if either, or both of them, had been there. Then
there's Mrs. Appleton&mdash;" he described her visit. "She was
thankful, I think, to learn that there seemed nothing odd about
her brother's death. She was tremendously keen on tilting out
that rather peculiar cigarette ash...find out the smoker of that
kind of cigarette, and I fancy one would have a lead as to whom
she suspected of having been with Ingram last night and of having
murdered him. In other words, sir, Mrs. Appleton, I think, knows
of a reason why her brother might have been murdered, and is
thankful that his death seems to be from misadventure."</p>

<p>"Umph...like the two girls, that's odd,"-Pelham said
thoughtfully, "for as far as we can find out, there's nothing
linking Mrs. Appleton with ciphers. Whereas Mrs. Pratt! Know
anything about her? I've just had my mind refreshed for me."</p>

<p>Pointer had expected to get from Major Pelham the particulars
of the people at The Tall House which he had not been able to
obtain on the spot. He murmured that he would like to hear all
that the other had learned.</p>

<p>"There was a frightful scandal at Geneva," the assistant
commissioner said, "where, as you know, her husband was one of
the British secretaries. Her maid was found to be an
international spy. Name of Aage Roth. One of those convenient
people who work for any paymaster and bring in everything they
find to one of the big international bureaus there who sell to
the highest bidder. She went rather too far and got caught. Sent
to an Italian prison. Mrs. Pratt was much pitied for the awkward
position, but still...well, it didn't do her husband any good.
Accidents like those shouldn't happen in well regulated
households. He resigned a year later and he and his wife went for
a sea voyage. He fell overboard one dark night. Tragic story."
But there was more, something else than pity in the Major's
bright blue eye. "Oh, I'm not hinting at anything," he went on
virtuously, "I'm merely giving you the facts. They may be of use,
they may not. But taken together with those two little groups of
torn words it does rather make one wonder...Mrs. Pratt at The
Tall House...Ingram, the cipher expert, asked by her to burn
something...anyone in the house who strikes you as possibly being
a foreigner?"</p>

<p>"Tark has certainly other than English blood, by the look of
him, but I rather thought Hungarian, or that sort of thing."
Pointer was putting his papers together as he spoke.</p>

<p>"It boils down to this, so far, then," Pelham was ticking the
items on the table with his pencil point.</p>

<p>"Ingram seems to have been in possession of something which
others knew that he owned, and which they seemed to think worth
hunting for, and which they felt sure would not be in the paper
basket. He may have posted it late last night by registered post
or otherwise. If the former, the registration slip is missing.
This idea that Ingram owned something of value holds good for
your two alternative solutions. First, that Gilmour is
consciously lying as to how Ingram's death took place. Secondly,
that he is telling the truth, but that the cartridge was changed,
and so was the sheet through which the shot went which he fired
and which killed Ingram; the changed sheet to look like the
original one, and yet to have been faked so as to throw doubt on
his story, by the position of the hole. That it, in a
nutshell?"</p>

<p>In a cocoanut shell, Pointer thought, but he only said that it
was.</p>

<p>Pelham watched him with the absent-minded gaze of one whose
thoughts are elsewhere.</p>

<p>"I said just now that this might be a crime aimed at Gilmour
and the exact victim be almost immaterial to the author, but it's
also possible, isn't it, that he was used as a convenient way of
getting rid of Ingram without its being suspected that a crime
was being committed."</p>

<p>Pointer agreed that this explanation was possible.</p>

<p>"There's one thing, sir. If it's been aimed at Mr. Gilmour our
attention will be called to the hole in that sheet. So far, no
one has tried to make me think it anything but an accident.
Personally I'm wondering if the newspapers will give the
suggestion...Miss Longstaff may be in touch with a
reporter..."</p>

<p>"You seem to think anything's possible with her," chaffed the
A. C.</p>

<p>"Pretty well, sir," Pointer agreed as he left the room. Within
half an hour the chief inspector knew that his guess was right,
and that it was to be by way of the papers that doubt was to be
cast on Gilmour's account of what had happened. Or rather by way
of the <i>Morning Wire</i>. Its front pages were black with
capitals and snapshots of The Tall House and portraits of Charles
Ingram. Diagrams of the sheet, too, were spread across pretty
well the whole page with a cross for the hole and another for
where it ought to be. Diagrams of ghosts and ghostly
wrappings...Pointer felt that he knew the writer of the article,
no matter what the name was printed below it.</p>

<p>At the house itself it was Gilmour who first secured a copy of
the paper from a passing newsboy who was shouting "The Tall House
Puzzle" as he ran down the street.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he stepped in to where Moy was busy
writing. His face startled the young solicitor. Had some fresh
tragedy occurred?</p>

<p>"Anything else wrong?" he asked. Gilmour sank heavily on to
the arm of a chair.</p>

<p>"This is just out! Read it!" He thrust the early edition into
Moy's eager hands and stared straight ahead of him.</p>

<p>Moy read the article, and dropped the paper with an
exclamation.</p>

<p>"Just so! If that's true, I was lying. But I didn't lie. So
it's not true." Gilmour spoke doggedly. "The hole can't have been
where they mark it in that diagram, for everything took place
exactly as I described it. Am I ever likely to forget one item of
what happened? I've just been in my room and in the passage and
tried to live it all through once more. I haven't been out in the
tiniest detail, I'll swear."</p>

<p>"Yet the hole was like that, near the hem," Moy murmured.
"There's no use in getting rattled. I wonder if you've been
mistaken in the whole thing. I mean if Ingram wasn't shot by you
at all, but that in some devilishly clever way you were just made
to think you did it?"</p>

<p>Gilmour stared at him. Then' he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Impossible! I fired. I heard him scream. I heard him fall. I
turned up the switch&mdash;at last&mdash;to see him lying dead
with my bullet hole in his forehead. Ingram, who never hurt
anyone in all his quiet life!" His voice shook. There was
something bewildered in his face since he had read the paper. He
took a turn up and down the room.</p>

<p>"This article!" he went on passionately. "Someone's not
content with what I shall suffer all my life. Someone wants me to
be publicly branded as what I'm not, and that's a murderer.
Should the worst come, as it may, after that article, will you
act as my solicitor?"</p>

<p>Moy held out his hand and gave the other's a warm clasp.</p>

<p>"Depend on me. But it won't come to that&mdash;probably." The
last word was brought out reluctantly. "Though there's no use
denying that the situation is serious. Something's going
on...something underhand...but there's one thing for
you&mdash;the lack of all motive. But about this article in the
paper," Moy was thinking hard, "who on earth could have written
it?"</p>

<p>"Some reporter, of course, or some press agent got it all from
the police." Gilmour did not show much interest in the
authorship. Whereas Moy was keenly interested. He did not believe
that the chief inspector would have been so guarded just now if
he had meant to speak to the press. But supposing someone wanted
to harm Gilmour, that piece of print had given him a terrible
chance. He pulled himself together.</p>

<p>"The inquest is this afternoon. We must be prepared, of
course. Fully prepared. Now suppose I go through the questions
the coroner's sure to ask you. Among them will be when did you
meet Ingram, how did you come to share a fiat with him, and so
on."</p>

<p>Gilmour answered truthfully but baldly. His answers told
nothing new. His best defense, as Moy had just said, was lack of
motive and plenty of better opportunities, as the solicitor had
not said, but contented himself with thinking. He looked again at
the printed diagram of the sheet and the hole.</p>

<p>"Whoever did that is trying to fasten a murder on you," he
agreed.</p>

<p>Gilmour looked at him a long minute.</p>

<p>"There's only one person here who hates me," he said
finally.</p>

<p>"Frederick Ingram?" Moy asked promptly. He had thought of him
at once.</p>

<p>Gilmour looked surprised. "Fred? Bless me, no! He wouldn't
have the grit to hate any one. Besides, all that old story is
forgotten between us. We're quite good friends now. No, I mean
Miss Pratt."</p>

<p>Moy almost gasped. Gilmour smiled a trifle crookedly.</p>

<p>"You've wondered at my standing out against the fair Winnie.
Apart from being in love, deeply and truly in love, with another
girl, her display of interest in me strikes me as so&mdash;so,"
he seemed to be groping for words, "so artificial. I can't
express it in words, but she doesn't care a hang for me really,
Moy. Whatever the reason for her apparent preference for me, it
was only apparent. Miles away from the real thing."</p>

<p>Moy stared at him. He was certain that Gilmour was mistaken.
He felt sure that he himself had got Winnie Pratt well taped, all
her measurements taken, and they were those of a silly young
woman who had hitherto always had what she wanted presented to
her on a silver salver, and so from sheer mischief had decided to
ask for the moon. Now, had Gilmour said that Miss Longstaff
didn't care a hang for him, Moy would have quite agreed with him.
Suddenly Gilmour leaned forward. He had decided to say more, go
further than he had intended to a minute ago.</p>

<p>"You said just now there was no motive that could be drummed
up against me. I'm not so sure. Ingram was madly in love with
Winnie. It might be twisted to look as though I, too, had been,
and had shot him to get him out of the way."</p>

<p>"Come, come!" Moy could scotch this idea at once. "We all know
to the contrary, and could show that you avoided her whenever and
wherever you could. Besides, she herself&mdash;" He stopped. It
would be a very unpleasant avowal for Winnie Pratt to be asked to
make.</p>

<p>"Just so!" Gilmour said meaningly. There were tense lines
about his young mouth. "What about Winnie Pratt herself!
Supposing she chose to say&mdash;swear that my manner was only a
pose."</p>

<p>Moy was genuinely worried. "But I say! Good Heavens! Why
should she?"</p>

<p>Gilmour did not reply.</p>

<p>"You mean, that you think she will?" Moy asked in horror, for
if Miss Pratt did any such thing Gilmour might indeed be in a
tight place.</p>

<p>Gilmour was silent quite a long minute, fingering the
newspaper. Then he said with a sigh:</p>

<p>"Being in danger alters one's point of view. I should have
said yesterday that nothing would make me give a girl away, but
after that article there," he flicked at the front page, "this
may be a hanging matter. You've said you'll act for me, so, well,
I wouldn't bank on her not taking that line."</p>

<p>Remembering whom he had seen adjusting the all-important sheet
over Ingram's body, Moy felt sure that Gilmour was exactly
reversing the feelings of the two girls, and that time would yet
show that Winnie really loved him, whereas it was Miss Longstaff
who, for some reason of her own, had chosen to pretend, very
casually and carelessly, that in time she might be willing to
marry him.</p>

<p>"She's got at Alfreda in some way," Gilmour went on, lowering
his voice. "Alfreda wasn't like that down at Bispham. I know as
well as I know my own name that the other has made her think
there have been tender passages between us, and that it's only
because of my not wanting to stand in Ingram's way that I
wouldn't openly join her train of worshipers."</p>

<p>A short silence fell. Moy was re-reading bits of the article
before them. Then he turned a quick, excited face to the other's
hopeless one.</p>

<p>"Look here, I begin to wonder if the sheet was changed. While
we were in here. If so...where could the real one have been
put...any place near by?" He was talking to himself, and stepped
out into the corridor as he spoke. Suddenly he pounced on a door
close to Ingram's room. "That's the linen cupboard! It's just
possible! I wonder! You wait here. It's better that I should look
by myself!" Moy was almost incoherent, but Gilmour waited quietly
enough. Two minutes later Moy reappeared. "Andy! Andy! Puss,
puss!" he called, and in answer to his voice along stalked a
black Persian which had adopted Moy as his particular friend.
After another two minutes or so Moy came out again. His eyes were
alight, but he said nothing until he had drawn Gilmour into a
room and shut the door.</p>

<p>"Got it! The sheet is there! The real one, for it's got the
hole in the right place!" he said in an exultant whisper. "Oh,
no, I didn't take it away. I had a brain-wave instead. I got hold
of the cat, took off his collar with its bell, teased a corner of
the sheet through the hamper where it had been tossed with other
soiled linen, worked the cat's bell into the bit that hung out.
The basket stands in a corner, the bell doesn't show, but should
anyone try to get hold of that sheet, it'll ring. Now, stay here,
and keep your ears open for a tinkle-tinkle, while I go and tell
the policeman on the landing all about it."</p>

<p>He was gone, and for the first time since he had fired the
shot Gilmour's face showed a slight relaxation of its lines.</p>

<p>The detective listened carefully to Moy while the cat sat by
and washed a paw.</p>

<p>"You've found another sheet? Also with a bullet hole through
it?" He looked keenly at the young solicitor. "I see. And you've
fastened a bell&mdash;" He stopped. Tinkle-tinkle-tink! came a
light, clear sound.</p>

<p>Andy, the cat, listened with a bewildered look upon his
intelligent face. Surely that was his bell...he scampered down
the passage straight for the linen room and only just dodged out
of the way as someone slipped out of the door. The someone was
Miss Longstaff. Behind her came Frederick Ingram. "The maids seem
quite demoralized," she said promptly, "I've been ringing for
hours for a towel for Mr. Ingram. Do you know where they're
kept?" She had nerve, Moy thought, as he replied stiffly that he
had no idea where the linen at The Tall House was stowed, but
that a pile of hand-towels was usually to be found in the locker
of the downstairs lavatory.</p>

<p>"Were you ringing for her in there?" he asked blandly, "it
sounded for all the world like a cat's bell."</p>

<p>Miss Longstaff murmured a word that did not sound like any
bell, and went on downstairs with Fred. The detective sat on the
basket which Moy had pointed out to him, from which a little
round bell still dangled, fastened into a corner of a sheet.</p>

<p>"I wasn't present when you found this?" the detective, a young
Oxford man, said with a faint grin, eyeing Moy very closely.</p>

<p>"You weren't present either when Ingram was shot," Moy
countered. "Yet you don't deny that fact."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it's no use denying facts!" the young man gave
another grin.</p>

<p>"Why this attitude then?" Moy held out his cigarette case.</p>

<p>"Because this hamper and the two others were searched when we
arrived this morning. You don't suppose Chief Inspector Pointer
overlooks any mouse-hole, do you? No sheet with a bullet hole was
in this room then."</p>

<p>Moy stared at him. "I found it at the very bottom..." he said
slowly.</p>

<p>Bosanquet shook his head. "Not there this morning. However,
that's between ourselves. At any rate, this has got the hole in
the right place." He was spreading out the sheet and looking at
the little round scorched hole which was a good foot and a half
in from the edge.</p>

<p>Moy initialed it carefully with an indelible pencil. Then they
put it back in the basket and the detective announced his
intention of sitting on guard on the hamper until the chief
inspector could see it.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER 10</h2>

<p class="first">FREDERICK INGRAM touched Moy on the arm.</p>

<p>"Look here, that was just Miss Longstaff's idea&mdash;that
towel excuse&mdash;the fact is, I think as my brother's
representative, he was your client, that you oughtn't to take
sides with Gilmour, as you do."</p>

<p>"Take sides?" Moy repeated, ruffled. "I don't understand. What
do you mean? I'm in the house when a terrible accident happens; I
see it happen&mdash;practically. Naturally, I form my own
conclusions. Who's more able to than the man on the spot? I do
believe Gilmour's story. Why shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Because Charles was your client," Fred said slowly and
weightily. "Gilmour shot to kill, Moy. You should consider that
view of my brother's death and see if it leads you
to&mdash;Gilmour's side."</p>

<p>"It's just as well there are no witnesses," Moy said to that.
"You must have some reason for your words."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's so obvious," Fred Ingram said loftily, "so obvious
that you're all overlooking it. Of course my sister, Mrs.
Appleton, swears that it's an accident, but then"&mdash;a very
nasty sneer crossed his face&mdash;"what's easier? Shoot a man
openly, and then claim you thought you were shooting
blank...Perfectly safe to get away with that."</p>

<p>"And the motive?"</p>

<p>Frederick hunched his shoulders. "Some private feud, of
course. They shared a flat together. A dozen motives may have
arisen of which no outsider would know anything."</p>

<p>"The chief inspector is coming over at once," Moy said after a
moment's thought. "Why don't you speak to him of your
suspicions?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to," was the reply, and Fred swung on down the
passage.</p>

<p>Pointer was on his way to The Tall House when the message from
his man was received for him at the Yard. He heard the news with
his usual impassive gravity. Then he went up and inspected the
place where the second sheet had been found. The detective who
had taken charge of it had already made his inquiries. The room
was naturally never locked, the sheets had all been changed
yesterday morning in readiness for the laundry which would call
for them some time during the afternoon.</p>

<p>"We looked them all over, sir," Bosanquet murmured. "Wasn't
here then. But unfortunately all the sheets in the house are
exactly alike, except those used by the servants."</p>

<p>"So we shan't know off whose bed it came," Pointer
finished.</p>

<p>Up till now it had not been possible to examine any bedrooms,
let alone beds, except those of the dead man and of Gilmour.
Pointer went there now. The sheet was still missing from Ingram's
bed. It was quite impossible to say which of the two claimants to
be the original top one was genuine. Even the housekeeper could
not tell any of the linen apart.</p>

<p>"Quite useless trying to find out," Pointer said to his man.
"Evidently it was in, or on, a bed when we first came early this
morning." He examined the hole. If not caused by such a shot as
would come from Gilmour's little automatic, then it had been
burned with the pointed end of something of a size so exactly
right, that whoever did it must have known exactly what size was
wanted, even though the other sheet had been taken away by
Pointer.</p>

<p>A tap came on the door. Fred Ingram would like to speak to the
chief inspector when he should be at liberty, said one of the
plain-clothes men.</p>

<p>Pointer had finished here. He took the second sheet and laid
it away in the despatch case which always accompanied him while
an inquiry was on. Pointer saw Frederick in one of the downstairs
rooms. Frederick informed him that he felt sure that Gilmour had
intended to kill Ingram. That all this "stuff" about thinking it
was loaded with blank was "tosh." Of course the cartridges now in
it are, but the first one was a genuine affair, and known to be
by Gilmour..</p>

<p>"And what did your half-brother own, Mr. Ingram, that would
make Mr. Gilmour&mdash;or anyone else for that matter&mdash;want
to murder him?" was the query, and the gray eyes just swept the
other's by no means ingenuous face.</p>

<p>Frederick clenched his teeth together until his cheek muscles
bunched. "That's a very police way of looking at things," he
sneered. "His purse or a five pound note, you mean? I don't know
what the motive is, but I can guess." He shot his rather
underhung jaw forward. "When there's a lovely girl staying in the
house with two men keen on marrying her, it wouldn't be difficult
to add a third."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Gilmour claims to care for another lady."</p>

<p>"Oh, that! Have you seen them both?" Frederick demanded
rudely. "Well, where are your eyes, chief inspector? They'll tell
you how much truth there could be in that tale. But whether she
was the reason or not, the fact is all that matters here. And the
fact is that Gilmour has very simply, but quite successfully,
drawn the wool over all your eyes. All except Miss Longstaff's.
Look here, if Gilmour were innocent wouldn't she be the first to
feel it? She doesn't. She's so sure he's guilty that she's having
nothing more to do with him."</p>

<p>"Well," Pointer said with carefully obvious patience, "as I
understand it, Mr. Ingram, you have only suspicions, nothing
definite, to go on? No past quarrels, for instance, overheard by
you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but my common sense," Fred said shortly.</p>

<p>"And what about your own little disagreement with Gilmour?"
Pointer asked pleasantly. His shot at a venture went home. Fred's
face flushed.</p>

<p>"That has nothing whatever to do with my certainty that the
man's lying, and is gulling you all." And with that he left the
room rather hurriedly.</p>

<p>Pointer was entering a note or two when Moy came in search of
him.</p>

<p>"Has Frederick Ingram spoken to you yet?" he asked.</p>

<p>"On several occasions," was the reply, with a twinkle. "About
Gilmour, I mean. Just now?"</p>

<p>Pointer said that he had.</p>

<p>"Then please listen to Haliburton, too. Here, Haliburton, you
promised to be kind enough to tell the chief inspector the tale
of the foxes that weren't clever enough to fool Gilmour. I must
be off to the office."</p>

<p>Haliburton, in his slow, pleasant way, rather jibbed a bit at
first, but finally told Pointer all about that old affair. He
added that Fred claimed to have been as much taken in as was his
half-brother, and Ingram apparently believed him, since it was
after it that he offered him the post of his reader, but Fred had
never let an opportunity pass, since then, of jumping on Gilmour
behind his back. Before his brother he was forced to show a
certain neutrality for fear of arousing even Ingram's
unsuspicious mind to make a few connections.</p>

<p>"You're confident that Mr. Frederick Ingram knew the real
state of things?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"I don't see how he could help it. And any other business man
would tell you the same. Charles Ingram wasn't a business man.
And one didn't like to call his half-brother a swindler, so one
had to let it pass. As, thanks to Gilmour, he hadn't lost
anything, one could let the matter rest and hope that Fred Ingram
would be more cautious in future."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Gilmour show any especial skill in detecting
the&mdash;weakness&mdash;of the proposal?" Pointer asked. He
wanted to know if the dislike of Fred for Gilmour was
reciprocated.</p>

<p>"None. Just used his brains, read what was written between the
lines as well as what was in them. Ingram was the sort of fine
chap who never would dream that anything could exist between
lines."</p>

<p>"Yet I thought he was rather an authority on ciphers," Pointer
said.</p>

<p>Haliburton said that he too had heard as much, but he seemed
to feel no interest in that subject and referred back to the
silver fox farm without telling anything fresh.</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Frederick Ingram ever threaten to make it unpleasant
for Gilmour?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>Haliburton drew in his rather long upper lip. He shot the
detective officer a speculative look.</p>

<p>"He did. Told him he'd teach him to mind his own business. But
I don't think Fred Ingram the sort of chap who would keep his
word&mdash;even to himself&mdash;if it were at all
troublesome."</p>

<p>"What terms were he and his brother on?"</p>

<p>"Excellent. As far as any one could judge Charles and
Frederick were united by a really strong family tie."</p>

<p>Pointer drove on to the Yard turning Frederick Ingram over in
his mind. Where lay the key to the motive for this
murder&mdash;if it had been one?</p>

<p>He informed the assistant commissioner of the discovery of a
sheet, whose hole would fit Gilmour's statement, tucked away
where it would have been sent to the wash with the other sheets
and where the hole, even if noticed, would have been taken for a
burn from a cigarette end.</p>

<p>"And it may be just that&mdash;or something hot&mdash;which
did it," he wound up. "Mr. Gilmour even might have recollected
its position before the paper came out, and tried to put a
blunder on his part right before it should be too late. He could
have done that, of course, and just waited for someone to make
the discovery."</p>

<p>"Yes, like his story, it's inconclusive," Pelham agreed.
"Can't you clinch the matter by the sheets themselves? Or do they
all match each other?"</p>

<p>He was told that they did.</p>

<p>"And again it was Miss Longstaff who is connected with this,
sheet as with the other. Amusing notion of the cat's bell. And
you say Fred Ingram was with her? Odd..."</p>

<p>Pointer went on to speak of the fox farming idea and Gilmour's
part in preventing Ingram dropping quite a nice little sum over
it.</p>

<p>"Aha!" Pelham cocked an ear like a hunter who hears a
crackling out in the bushes. "So Frederick Ingram told you he
suspected Gilmour of murder, did he?" The assistant commissioner
passed a paper over to Pointer. "Here are the brief outlines of
Fred Ingram's career, as far as we know them," he said. "Not at
all the sort of saint who wouldn't try to do his half-brother out
of a few shekels. Trouble with him seems to be that he once made
a really good win at Cannes, baccarat it was, that most
fascinating of naughty little games, and since then he flutters
around any casino candle like the proverbial moth, and to very
similar effect. However, this last couple of years, as Haliburton
says, he seems to be a reformed character. Though he still knows
some shady people...I wonder if it was he who sold the story of
the sheet to the paper, and not Miss Longstaff...somehow she
really seems so incomprehensible...if she did it, I mean. Gilmour
apparently so in love with her while she sells him to the
press..."</p>

<p>"Yet it is Miss Pratt, sir, who by her words throws the
greatest suspicion on Gilmour, the suspicion of a possible
motive. As far as I can learn there is no foundation whatever for
her idea that Gilmour cares for her. But she seems to think he
does. Must."</p>

<p>"Perhaps more may come out at the inquest. What's your
position going to be at it?"</p>

<p>"Knowing nothing, suspecting nothing, and believing
everything," Pointer assured his chief, and the other let him go
with a smile.</p>

<p>Back in his own room, Pointer looked through the Yard's
news-sheet of crimes that had happened last night. It was part of
every officer's routine. There was one item on it at which he
stopped, an attempted robbery of a small post office off
Leicester Square. That office had happened to have rather a large
sum of money in its safe last night, a fact that seemed to have
leaked out; but not so the other fact that the authorities had
taken precautions accordingly.</p>

<p>A masked man had entered the office only to find himself
confronted by a group of resolute postal officials&mdash;all
armed. He had decamped on the spot. He had rushed down a side
street, and it was this fact that interested the chief inspector.
For, supposing Ingram to have posted a letter late last night,
then he would have done so from either the Leicester Square or
the Fleet Street post office, as being the two nearest to him
which' were open all night. And coming from Chelsea, there was a
short cut from Piccadilly Circus by way of Lisle Street which was
the identical street used by the masked man in running away.
Lisle Street had just been freshly laid down, and on a pair of
shoes, neatly placed under the foot of Ingram's bed, were the
marks of having recently been walked over some newly tarred road
surface. Pointer already had sent a man to that office asking
whether Ingram&mdash;to be identified by his portrait in the
paper which had printed the diagram of the sheet with the hole in
the wrong place&mdash;had registered a letter or parcel there
last night. A message on the 'phone while he was still studying
the map, told him that a clerk on late duty had recognized Mr.
Ingram as the sender of a late fee letter or package by letter
post, some time shortly after one o'clock last night. There had
been some question of making exact change and Ingram had offered
a half-crown which was bad. He had handed in another, and had
stood chatting about his first piece and how to identify such a
one in future. Unfortunately the clerk could not remember the
name to which he had posted the package or letter, and knew that
by no effort could he do so, but he was certain of Ingram's
identity, and his description of the rather hesitant, pleasant
voice tallied exactly with the dead man's, who, the post office
clerk said, had been alone. He had glanced at the clock at the
same moment that Ingram had pulled out his watch and compared the
two, and he was willing to swear that the hour was shortly after
midnight. Five or six minutes past twelve.</p>

<p>Now that was just a little before the time that the masked man
would be running down Lisle Street, which would probably be
otherwise quite deserted at that hour.</p>

<p>Pointer was making a note about the bad half-crown when Chief
Inspector Franklin came in. He was looking for a ledger on
Pointer's shelves. Franklin was an older man than the other, a
cheery soul, with a liking for a joke which found little scope in
his profession. He was in charge of this attempted robbery.
Pointer looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"I was just wanting a word with you about this post office
robbery of yours," he began. To judge by their talk, all the men
at the Yard might have been criminals, there were such constant
references to 'this forgery of yours,' 'this attempted larceny of
yours,' this blackmail of yours that didn't come off.'...Pointer
explained to Franklin now how Ingram might well have met the
running man.</p>

<p>"Of course the man would have had his mask off...Ingram may
have recognized him...had no idea what he was hurrying away
from...the man would see to it that he slowed down to a quick
walk...if he knew Ingram, he would have snatched at the chance of
walking on with him, supposing Ingram to have been hurrying home,
which would give the man an excuse for running&mdash;he could
claim to be running after Ingram..."</p>

<p>"And what about bad half-crowns?" Pointer went on.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Franklin nodded again with a grin this time. "I told
Blackwell that we hadn't heard the last of that coining den of
his, but he would have it that it was all cleaned up. You never
clean up forgers or coiners."</p>

<p>"I wonder if that bad coin had anything to do with Ingram's
death," Pointer mused, "...or did he meet this running man of
yours and recognize him?...I've been rather inclined to the idea
that he had some important document, cipher or cipher-reading,
which was wanted by the murderer. But a false half-crown...and a
man desperately trying to escape detection..." Pointer's voice
died away into thought.</p>

<p>Franklin was greatly interested. "Of course, supposing my man
was known to Ingram, he might have told him some cock and bull
story about always running at night in full evening rig so as to
slim, but he would know that when Ingram got the morning papers
with their account of the attempted robbery in them, his tale
would be torn. I think you've struck a good line there,
Pointer."</p>

<p>Pointer did not look delighted. "It's a pleasant mixture," he
said. "As a rule, in a shooting case, if a man wasn't on the
scene of the crime, then he's presumably innocent. But here, the
members of the house party who were out of the house last night
will be the most suspected, and heaven only knows where anybody
was. I've only their word for it...No way of checking it..."</p>

<p>"Well, if your murder is the result of my raid," Franklin
said, quite unconscious of anything humorous in the phrasing of
his sentence, "then it looks to me as though a bigger and better
raid was being planned. You think he was someone staying in the
house?"</p>

<p>"Whoever murdered Ingram was either stopping at The Tall
House, or knew the house well." Pointer explained about the sheet
and the blank cartridge and Franklin agreed that that seemed
certain. Pointer ran over the people in the house to him,
describing them.</p>

<p>Franklin was not interested in Haliburton or in Gilmour, one
wealthy, the other with a good pay and a good pension. Both men
he did not consider as probable post office robbers, but Tark
seemed another matter. He, too, however, seemed to have means of
his own, apart from his profession of a mining engineer.</p>

<p>"He's the one we know least about," Pointer finished. "But so
far what he says should be easily verified. Born at Beausoleil,
studied at Bologna, studied mathematics...got his doctorate there
in Letters...claims to have a moderate but sufficient income from
his father who was an English biologist worker for the Duke of
Monaco on some of his deep-sea expeditions. Hence the house in
Beausoleil which the father bought."</p>

<p>"Beausoleil, not Monaco, I notice," Franklin said
meaningly.</p>

<p>Pointer had noticed that too. It might mean little. But anyone
living in Beausoleil can spend as much time as he wishes at the
Monte Carlo Casino, which is not the case should he live within
the walls of the little principality itself. On the other hand,
Beausoleil has its admirers, quite apart from any question of
gaming, and it was understandable that a man working for the Duke
when not required to be in residence might prefer to be outside
his jurisdiction, and yet almost as near as though living in
Monaco itself.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's out of the question for Ingram himself to have
had a hand in anything shady," mused Franklin; "been the
directing spirit, say? Come out to watch how his little plans
were getting along? That bad half-crown was very casually
'planted.'..."</p>

<p>Pointer could only say that few things were impossible, which
was what made life, and especially the life of a detective,
interesting, but that it seemed a strange idea. Not borne out by
anything yet found.</p>

<p>"It's much more in Fred Ingram's line, one would say, but even
with him&mdash;" he proceeded to pass on his information about
the younger Ingram.</p>

<p>"Do you want this robbery of yours mentioned at the inquest?"
Pointer asked. He was folding up the <i>Yard News</i>.</p>

<p>Franklin emphatically did not. And said so. He watched the
other mark some papers and tie them together.</p>

<p>"What do you call this case&mdash;The Tall House puzzle?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Personally I think of it as the 'Either-Or' case," Pointer
replied.</p>

<p>"Either Gilmour is telling the truth, and is innocent, or he's
lying and is the murderer." Franklin laughed a little. "Nothing
peculiar about that I should say. This suggestion as to a
possible motive in my robbery for Ingram's death seems rather to
suggest that he's telling the truth."</p>

<p>Pointer nodded in his turn. "But here again, taking Ingram's
death as a murder, either the motive was to escape detection when
Ingram read the morning papers or it is something quite
different. And I don't see what part the posting of the package
or letter would play in the plot if Ingram was merely killed to
avoid recognition, or to prevent his handing over someone to the
police next morning."</p>

<p>"And why should the posting of the letter play any part in the
crime?" Franklin paused in the act of lighting a cigar to
ask.</p>

<p>"Well, the murderer knew about the ghost talk, and the threat
of Gilmour's to shoot at sight, he would certainly know about
Ingram's going out to post or register a letter. The odd thing is
that he was allowed to send that package...and that no attempt
was made on his life beforehand..."</p>

<p>"Well?" Franklin was forgetting to light up.</p>

<p>"Yet one would think that the murderer must have foreseen its
posting. He was so well up in all the other details of life at
The Tall House. Ingram was working hard at something all
afternoon, and more or less all evening...the murderer must have
been expecting that it would be sent off. It looks, so far, as
though he wanted it posted."</p>

<p>"Waited for it, you think?"</p>

<p>Pointer said that it looked like it so far. "If so, it cuts
the ground out from under my idea of Ingram's chance encounter
with the man who took part in your robbery."</p>

<p>"Unless," Franklin's blue eyes darkened, "that package
contained something to do with counterfeit coining? Say Ingram
was suspicious...had got on the track of some coiners, tested a
piece of silver and found it bad, and...but he had posted the
package first."</p>

<p>They discussed the further possibilities for a brief moment.
Then Pointer was ready to go.</p>

<p>"I always think of you as soaring far above facts in your
deduction flights." Franklin chaffed him.</p>

<p>"When I'm in a fog, my dear chap, facts are like palings to
which I cling, groping for a fresh one before I let go of the
last. You've laid my hand on some fine fat fellows with this
robbery of yours, and I'm much obliged, though a bit lost yet as
to where they're going to lead me."</p>

<p>Franklin burst into one of his big laughs. "Are you in a fog
here?"</p>

<p>"Either&mdash;or," was Pointer's only reply.</p>

<p>"I don't envy you this murder of yours," Franklin said as they
parted. "Which of the people up at The Tall House strikes the
oddest note? Fred Ingram or this Tark?"</p>

<p>"Neither. Miss Longstaff," Pointer said promptly, and was
gone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER 11</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER turned over very carefully the new idea
as to why Ingram might have been murdered, as he drove back to
The Tall House.</p>

<p>It was rather suggestive, the notion of a man escaping from a
balked robbery, running slap into someone whom he knew, fobbing
him off for the moment with some sketchy excuse, and having to
kill him before the papers should give the details, unless he was
prepared for arrest and penal servitude. Someone who knew The
Tall House, who had heard or had been told of this talk about
ghosts...seeing the lateness of the hour the probabilities were
strongly in favor of it being someone who had himself heard that
threat of Gilmour's. In fact, the only certainty that Pointer
had, so far, was that the murderer knew of that talk.</p>

<p>He let himself quietly into the big house with its raking sky
line of five floors and a battlemented coping. The room next to
the library was locked. Why, no one seemed to know. Inside it sat
a plain clothes man watching the unlocked library. The man had a
careful list of all who had gone into the room, and through the
keyhole, by means of a tiny ended periscope, had been able to
watch what each person did. Pointer had "salted" the library a
little while ago with papers tucked in books or odd corners. Some
of the papers were quite blank, some of them were written on in
what looked like Ingram's peculiar, and, therefore, easily
copied, writing in what purported to be either mathematical
formulas or ciphers. Green of the Yard could dash off a forgery
in a couple of seconds which would defy any but his own eyes to
detect. His formulas and his ciphers were the merest
conglomeration of figures or letters, but they looked quite
impressive. Tark had been in that room for nearly ten minutes
now.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Pratt has been in twice just to have a look&mdash;see,"
the man finished. "She's as good a watcher as one of us. Hangs
round one of the rooms opposite, seems to give everybody three
minutes, and then slips in and is quite surprised to find anyone
there, offers to help and is politely thanked, and then whoever
it is goes off and, after a second, she looks about her and goes
off too."</p>

<p>Pointer was now watching Tark pounce on a slip of paper,
studying it with the look of a ravenous animal on his usually
impassive face. Then he stood a moment the picture of indecision.
As the door opened he tossed the paper behind the couch.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Pratt in a smart black and white frock which only
made her look gray and lined.</p>

<p>"Back again?" she murmured with a faint contemptuous smile.
"Perhaps I can save you trouble, Mr. Tark," she said with that
sparkle in her eye that Pointer generally found meant hasty
impulse in man or woman. "The letter isn't here. It was
burned."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," Tark said stolidly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think you do," she replied, still with heightened
color. "I saw you looking up at us when I handed it to Mr.
Ingram. Well, it's burned and you won't be able to use
it&mdash;as you would like!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," Tark repeated. "I saw you hand a
paper to Ingram, yes, but papers you hand your friends don't
interest me, Mrs. Pratt." His cold eyes flickered contemptuously
over her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pratt only gave the equivalent of a toss of her head. "As
though I don't know how much you would like to find it&mdash;and
use it!" and with that she was gone again.</p>

<p>Tark stood looking after her, and seemed to think that this
was no time to continue his hunt, for he too went on out, leaving
the door ostentatiously wide open. After a second Mrs. Pratt came
back, closed the door, stood a second listening, and then
scrambled at full length under the sofa for whatever it was that
Tark had tossed there on her entry.</p>

<p>Pointer decided on a few words. He stepped in so swiftly and
so noiselessly that until he shut the door she had no idea anyone
had entered. Then she tried to wriggle back from her undignified
position and Pointer gravely assisted her, moving the sofa to let
her get up. She looked anything but grateful to him as she did
so.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mrs. Pratt," he said on that, "I have an idea you
want something back that you lent Mr. Ingram. Something besides
that poem you asked him to burn. Now we've taken quite a lot of
papers away with us. Unless it concerns the murder we don't want
to keep any of them. Yours may be among those that we have.
Suppose you tell me what is in it."</p>

<p>She stared hard at him, pursed her lips and straightened her
dress, flicking the dust off it here and there. "Mr. Ingram
burned those silly verses, as I just told Mr. Tark, who would
like to get hold of them and tease me about them."</p>

<p>"A playful nature, evidently," Pointer murmured.</p>

<p>She shot him a cold and haughty glance, but he did not seem to
see it as she made for the door. He held it open without another
word. Mrs. Pratt was not going to talk. She did not return to the
opposite room but went on up the stairs too. Pointer had his man
join him in the little room which he used as a sort of temporary
police station. There he looked through the man's list of names
and times spent in hunting in the library. First had come Miss
Longstaff; she had spent a quarter of an hour when Mrs. Pratt had
dropped in. The detective thought that Mrs. Pratt was distinctly
suspicious of the younger woman's motives for being there at all.
Miss Longstaff had said that she had mislaid a return ticket and
a letter from her mother while in there earlier in the day, and
"must have them back." Mrs. Pratt, as had been said, showed a
certain skepticism of this reason.</p>

<p>"Your letter in here? How very odd! Did you bring it down
here, or do you think one of the maids carried it downstairs from
your bedroom?" she had asked sweetly. Miss Longstaff said she had
no thoughts on the matter but that she had been reading it when
the dreadful shock of this morning had made her come running down
with it, and possibly the ticket too, in her hand. Since then
both had disappeared. Like everyone else (here the detective said
she had given Mrs. Pratt a certain lingering look) she had wanted
to see the room where Mr. Ingram had worked...she might have
dropped it then...but did Mrs. Pratt want anything in
particular?</p>

<p>Mrs. Pratt said that she had handed Mr. Ingram a very silly
set of verses about angles and angels, and so on, and only hoped
it had not fallen into the hands of the police; she would feel so
very silly if any eye but her own and Ingram's ever saw the
lines. And then it had been Miss Longstaff's turn to be
surprised. "You wrote poetry on Mr. Ingram? Now do you know that
is the last thing I should connect with you, Mrs. Pratt," and so
it had gone on for a few more sentences. Then Mrs. Pratt had sat
down and said she wanted to write a letter, would Miss Longstaff
mind letting her have the room to herself for a few minutes? She
had always found that she could write best in the library.
"Poetry?" Miss Longstaff had asked with one of her stares but she
had left the other woman alone. After a minute or two Mrs. Pratt
had gone out. Her aim had evidently been to see the girl off the
premises. Then had come Frederick Ingram. He had gone over every
scrap of paper, and the description of his face while doing so
tallied remarkably with the look on Tark's face, with the effect
of half-savage desire, half-indecision which the chief inspector
had watched on the man to whom Mrs. Pratt had spoken her odd
words. Then again Mrs. Pratt had drifted in, and again had asked
the seeker what he was looking for. Frederick said that he had
left some very valuable notes here, which Ingram particularly
wanted him to rush through for his next book.</p>

<p>That he had laid them down while talking with Ingram and did
not remember where...Mrs. Pratt seemed to have two strokes to
most people's one, and she saw Frederick Ingram safely out of the
room, having another look when he had gone. What was the woman
after? Pointer could only guess that she was not so satisfied as
she seemed that Ingram really had burned whatever she had handed
him. What could that be? The field was too wide and rested too
entirely on speculation for the chief inspector to waste any time
over it. Certainly the two men examined any scrap of paper no
matter how tiny, whereas Mrs. Pratt only looked at sheets of
note-paper that resembled that stocked in the writing-tables of
the house, and used by Ingram himself in the library, a gray
paper with black heading.</p>

<p>That much bore out her statement about the silly rhyme, but
only that much. At all events, she and the two men did not seem
to be in each other's confidence.</p>

<p>As for Tark and Frederick Ingram, they seemed to be strangers
to each other, at any rate neither had been seen talking to the
other at The Tall House since Ingram's death.</p>

<p>The inquest was fixed for the afternoon. For a while the
coroner seemed inclined to dally with the idea of the unbolted
front door, but as a coroner's court has only to decide the cause
of death, and in this case it was most clearly and undisputably
death from a bullet, he could not waste much time on that.</p>

<p>Frederick Ingram ventilated his doubts of Gilmour's story as
to a blunder having been made. But all the other witnesses who
knew the two men, including his sister, spoke so warmly of the
years of uninterrupted friendliness between them that he did not
make the impression which he obviously hoped to do.</p>

<p>And, very fortunately for Gilmour, a very eminent Cambridge
don, a friend of the dead man's, told of an incident which had
happened only this last Easter on Scawfell. Ingram and Gilmour
had tried a rather hazardous cross cut, Ingram had slipped to a
narrow ledge and lay unconscious. Gilmour had reached him with
some difficulty, and sat between him and the precipice, signaling
and calling for help. The Cambridge master had been out, too,
with some friends, and had heard the cries.</p>

<p>Ingram had been rescued, and after a day in bed was none the
worse for an adventure which, but for Gilmour, might have turned
into a tragedy. This piece of evidence flattened out any effect
made by Frederick.</p>

<p>As for Winnie Pratt, she gave Gilmour an impassioned
testimonial which secretly roused him to feelings little short of
homicidal, and even Moy bit his lips nervously. But Winnie was
only questioned for a moment, she could give no evidence of any
fresh kind. Miss Longstaff was not called.</p>

<p>The weapon was produced, the man who sold the blank cartridges
showed how next to impossible it would have been for the
suppliers to have made a mistake in a box labeled "Blank
Cartridges." The police put in the two sheets each with a hole in
it, one near the hem, one a good fifteen inches from the edge.
Gilmour gave his version of what had happened and explained the
substitution of a faked sheet for the real one as an idea of some
member of the house party fond of a dramatic incident, who wanted
to see how the police would come at the truth. Here his glance
fell on Winnie Pratt, who smiled gently and encouragingly back at
him.</p>

<p>The police themselves offered no objection to this theory. The
coroner summed up in a way certainly not hostile to Gilmour, the
jury went further, and brought in a verdict of death by
misadventure, expressing their sympathy with the sister of the
dead man, and with his friend, the unfortunate firer of the fatal
shot. They put in a rider as to the danger of practical jokes,
and the likelihood of them having unforeseen consequences.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you," Moy said warmly to Gilmour as they left
the coroner's court together. Gilmour looked at him.</p>

<p>"Would you like to have to sit down under a verdict of Not
Proven?" he asked quietly. "Would you let the woman you love
think you a murderer?"</p>

<p>"How can she think it! What motive&mdash;-" Moy said again,
almost impatiently.</p>

<p>"Miss Pratt has represented me as being secretly devoted to
her own fair self, and only faithful to Alfreda because I thought
I owed it to her." Gilmour spoke bitterly. "I knew something had
poisoned her mind when she came up to town&mdash;it's all that
wretched girl's doing. Alfreda loved me sincerely, down at
Bispham. I gave her, as well as myself, time to be sure of our
feelings and went down there and got her to come and stay with
us. I noticed a slight change then...a coldness, a sort of
indifference...I thought she was vexed that I had gone away, but
I think now that she had heard something about the beautiful
Winnie being here. At any rate, the girl who turned up next day
for lunch was no more my bright, amusing Alfreda, best of
companions, cheeriest of comrades, than it was a Dutchman. She
had been 'got at.' In other words, she thinks she has reason to
be jealous, and a jealous girl is never at her best." Gilmour
finished with a sigh. "She'll come round of course," he added,
"but when&mdash;how&mdash;" and he fell silent. Moy said nothing.
He had told the police, but not Gilmour, of the meeting in the
linen room this morning. What was Frederick Ingram doing in there
with Alfreda Longstaff?</p>

<p>The assistant commissioner had been present
too&mdash;unofficially&mdash;at the inquest. He was discussing it
with Pointer as they drove away.</p>

<p>"I rather hoped to find out who was Gilmour's and Ingram's
enemy," Pelham said, lighting up, "for if the man's telling the
truth, and he made a truthful impression, he has an enemy and a
bitter one! Personally, apart from the impression made on me, his
absence of any sort of a good yarn to account for that first
sheet sounds like an honest man. You've been delving deep into
Ingram's past. Have you found out any peculiarities? Moy speaks
as though it were the plain and level high road."</p>

<p>"There's one odd thing," Pointer said. "Moy doesn't seem to
know about it. How did Ingram manage to change the eight thousand
odd his father left him, after death duties were paid, into
thirty thousand odd? For that's the sum he has left behind him.
Allowing for the rise in the securities his father left him, and
the ones he himself has put his money into&mdash;and he seems to
have chosen well&mdash;that still leaves the fact of eight
thousand pounds turned into thirty."</p>

<p>"Fact? Call it a miracle these days," Pelham said
wistfully.</p>

<p>"He went in chiefly for gold shares," Pointer said.</p>

<p>"Well, that does explain the miracle a little. Still, even so,
I wish I had taken him as my financial adviser!" Pelham spoke
enviously now. "Or is this where the counterfeit half-crowns come
in? Blackwell will be still more on his toes when he hears this.
He's still hoping to be able to find in Ingram the devilish
schemer, the secret head of all coiners who, according to him,
really exists somewhere in Europe or America." Pointer was silent
for a moment, then he said, half to himself:</p>

<p>"Faces mislead, of course, as I'm the first to acknowledge,
but generally because they're only looked at as features, as it
were, two-dimensionally&mdash;breadth and height&mdash;but depth
is in Ingram's face too. If ever a dead face looked like that of
an upright, honorable man it is the face of the 'ghost' at The
Tall House. Fastidiously honorable, I should say, unbendably
upright."</p>

<p>"That's his reputation," Pelham said. "Everyone seems to agree
on that. But how he turned that eight into thirty..." Pelham lost
himself in financial speculation.</p>

<p>"He regularly, every quarter, these last five years has had
his stockbrokers send in to his bank securities to the total of
roughly a thousand pounds. He has spent for some six years
exactly four hundred a year on himself&mdash;one hundred every
quarter. His scholastic books seem to've brought him that and a
bit more. His father's capital constantly turned over very much
to its increase, and this strange thousand pounds every quarter
of the last five years, also well invested and frequently
changed, makes up the rest."</p>

<p>"What do his stockbrokers say? Who are they?"</p>

<p>"Cash and Weirdale."</p>

<p>"I know them. Good but old-fashioned. Nothing dubious would
pass them, I think. What do they say about the thousand pounds a
quarter? Was it sent them by check in the usual way on Settling
Day&mdash;or paid in by half-crowns?" Pelham finished with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Neither, sir. Mr. Ingram would personally drop in every
quarter day, quite irrespective of whether it was End Account or
Buying for New Time, and hand over personally ten packets of
one-hundred pound notes."</p>

<p>"'Forgeries?' asks Chief Inspector Blackwell at that point in
the story," Pelham said with interest.</p>

<p>"No, sir. Not as far as we know. The firm had had dealings
with Mr. Ingram for years or they would have refused such a way
of dealing, but in his case, of course, they accepted it as a
quaint bit of oddity."</p>

<p>"Very quaint, and most uncommonly odd!" agreed Pelham. "A
thousand pounds every quarter day...is it possible we have here
that never-yet-seen-in-the-flesh character, the gambler with a
certain System which consistently wins?"</p>

<p>"I thought of that, sir," Pointer said.</p>

<p>"You would!" Pelham spoke in a resigned tone. "Well?"</p>

<p>Pointer laughed. "Well, sir, we sent his picture to all the
big gambling resorts and he's definitely not known there. Nor has
he ever been away for long from his flat or house. But there is a
roulette table, old and dusty, in his rooms in a cupboard, snowed
under, and not been used for at least a year. But there it is.
For what it's worth."</p>

<p>"Do you think it's worth anything?" Pelham asked, cocking an
eye at him.</p>

<p>"It may be some legacy of Fred Ingram's, sir. But I confess
it's odd...Yet against the gambling idea, apart from no hint of
it ever having been whispered about him, as far as we know, is
the fact that he only paid in, never out from, his account any
largish sums."</p>

<p>"Looks like the half-crowns," Pelham murmured in jest.</p>

<p>"It's a case with many possibilities," Pointer agreed. "That
possible encounter with the masked man after the post-office
robbery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Appleton looks twenty years older," Pelham said
suddenly, "yet she and her brother didn't see much of each other
these latter years, and if Gilmour's story is true, she would
consider that he died as the result of a sheer accident. You said
she looked vastly relieved when Gilmour told her exactly what
happened."</p>

<p>"She did. But as you say, sir, she didn't look relieved today
at the inquest."</p>

<p>"Has she been searching the library too?"</p>

<p>"Not since her one search. But I told her that we wondered
whether any visitor had been in Mr. Ingram's bedroom last night,
and she promptly made an excuse and slipped in
there&mdash;unobserved, as she fancied. Again she emptied all the
cigarette ash out of the window."</p>

<p>"Was there any? I thought Ingram didn't smoke cigarettes."</p>

<p>"There was some left in a couple of ash trays," Pointer said
with a faint smile, "just to test Mrs. Appleton."</p>

<p>"You think she's afraid someone was there last night? Appleton
or Fred Ingram?"</p>

<p>"Her relations with her half-brother seem very cool, sir. Nor
can I think she would have looked so immensely relieved if he had
been in her mind&mdash;I mean when she first heard of how her
brother was actually killed. It looked to me, and still does, as
though she feared that someone very near to her had had a hand in
that killing."</p>

<p>"Which means her husband?" Pelham asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you think she thought he might have left something
compromising, identifying, behind him?"</p>

<p>"I think so, sirs. But the curious thing is she didn't know
what to look for, nor where. Odd, if her husband really had spent
the night at Markham Square as she says. Anyway, it looks as
though she knew of the existence of a motive...and knows that her
husband was not where she says he was, at home and in bed at one
o'clock last night."</p>

<p>"All four women then stand for larger or smaller mysteries in
this case. The two elder women as well as the two girls."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Appleton seemed oddly disturbed when Moy told her just
now&mdash;I was present&mdash;of the amount of her brother's
fortune. I couldn't say it was alarm, but it certainly was not
pleasure, when she heard the unexpectedly large sum he has left
behind him." Pointer was looking at his shoe-tips, deep in
thought.</p>

<p>"Well, that is odd!" Pelham said frankly.</p>

<p>"Moy has told me something that rather alters things," Pointer
went on. "By their marriage settlements she and Appleton agreed
to go halves in any legacy left them. There was a wealthy great
uncle of both who was expected to leave one or other his money.
He did, to Appleton, who quietly wriggled out of paying over the
half to his wife until he had spent it all. But the settlement
wasn't changed. So Appleton is really a co-heir with his wife,
though it's only a question of the interest on the money, which
goes intact to the children."</p>

<p>Pelham smoked thoughtfully without making any comment. They
were back at the Yard by this time, in the assistant
commissioner's room. He reached for a book behind him and opened
it at a page which he had marked with a slip.</p>

<p>"I bought this at an auction last week. It's an old work on
crime by Luigi Pinna, translated by some contemporary. There's a
delightful passage which puts the case beautifully, and in words
of one syllable. Listen: 'In numerous cases the sole difference
between success and failure in the detection of crime is a sort
of osmotic mental reluctance to seep through the cilia of what
seems to be and reach the vital stream of what actually is.' How
do you propose to seep through the cilia, Pointer?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it sounds rather odd. But I want to have all
disappearances during the last three months to six months in, or
near, London looked up. I'm only interested in solitary
people&mdash;men or women&mdash;preferably odd looking. No dwarfs
wanted, nor giants, nor very thin people..."</p>

<p>"What in the name of Minerva are you up to?" the A. C. asked.
"Disappearances and Ingram's death? How are they linked?"</p>

<p>"I hope you won't press that question, sir. I would be very
grateful if I needn't answer it at this stage. I may be quite
wrong. It's just a possibility..."</p>

<p>"The classic answer of the gifted sleuth," Pelham murmured
good humoredly. "The dark curtains being drawn before they part
with a bang and the lights go up, while the audience cheers,
eh?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could feel certain of that last part, sir. What if
the lights refuse to go up, and the audience laughs instead? But
seriously, there is just a possibility which has been in my mind
from the beginning...if I can find what I'm feeling for, it would
lead straight to the solution of the puzzle."</p>

<p>"And to the motive at the same time?" Pelham asked. Pointer
shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not necessarily, sir, but it would lead to the
criminal&mdash;if it leads anywhere."</p>

<p>"Humph...well, I'll let you answer my questions at your own
convenience then. But as to motive...no ideas at all?"</p>

<p>"I can't think of anything that will fit the case, sir. And I
assure you, it's not due to osmotic mental reluctance."</p>

<p>Pointer laughed. "I've been trying to find out if Mr. Ingram
went in for crossword competitions. It would be odd to win so
regularly, but he has brains that would lend themselves to that
sort of thing, one would think.</p>

<p>"It seems, however, that he particularly disliked them. Mrs.
Appleton told me that if the children started asking 'what word
of four letters means feeble,' or 'one of seven means dashed
hopes,' and so on...he would fly, and everyone else tells me the
same thing."</p>

<p>"Looks like ciphers," Pelham said, serious again. "Big
business firms will pay anything you like for unreadable ciphers,
or for help in solving those stolen or intercepted from rival
firms. And of course there still remains government ciphers and
Mrs. Pratt's one-time maid, you know..."</p>

<p>"And her husband who fell overboard..." Pointer finished.
"I've looked up the record of that. Apparently Mr. Pratt was
really out on deck by himself when he fell over."</p>

<p>"It's a subtle crime," Pelham said after a moment's silence.
"This of Ingram's death. And clever. To get another man to do
your shooting for you is really good. The curious thing was that
change in the sheets..."</p>

<p>"Very," Pointer agreed. "It paid us such a compliment. Most of
the people one meets seem to think a detective can't see things
unless he stumbles over them."</p>

<p>"I never heard anyone who ever met you, let alone saw you at
work, speak of that as one of your failings," Pelham
murmured.</p>

<p>"Still, sir, it was a compliment to us to feel so sure that we
would notice the wrong placing of that hole, if done
purposely..."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER 12</h2>

<p class="first">ABOUT an hour after the inquest, Moy got a
message that Mrs. Appleton would like to speak to him on the
telephone.</p>

<p>"Do come round to see me as soon as you can," she begged. "I'm
thinking about Mr. Gilmour. It's a dreadful position for him. I'm
staying at my brother's flat at Harrow for the present, as you
know, but I shall be at Markham Square all the afternoon."</p>

<p>When Moy went round, as he did at once, he found to his
surprise that Tark was in the little drawing-room talking to a
rather distrait-looking hostess. As Moy was shown in, Tark said
that he would wait until Moy had finished, and go back with him,
if he might, as there was something that he wanted to talk to the
solicitor about.</p>

<p>Mrs. Appleton gave a nod that suggested inattention more than
agreement, and Tark stepped out into the little passage, and Moy
heard him opening and then closing a door farther down on the
same side. The door of Appleton's den. So he could find his way
about the house...Moy had thought that he did not know Ingram's
sister or brother-in-law...but Moy dropped Tark, and what he
might have to say to him, and devoted himself to Mrs.
Appleton.</p>

<p>She had been deeply moved, she said, by the look of suffering
in Gilmour's face and she had just heard that Miss Longstaff had
broken with him.</p>

<p>"I don't know that there's anything one can do, Mrs.
Appleton," Moy said rather hopelessly. "I quite agree with you,
it's awful for him, but how to help him is another matter."</p>

<p>"I can't bear the situation!" she said suddenly to that. "It's
an intolerable one for me, Charles's sister!"</p>

<p>So it was not for Gilmour that she wanted to see him after
all, Moy thought.</p>

<p>"You know, I've been wondering whether some one couldn't have
shot Charles over Lawrence Gilmour's shoulder, just as he fired
the blank cartridge..." She looked very white and very tense as
she said this. "I mean, Mr. Gilmour may be right in thinking he
fired a blank shot, and yet Charles may have been shot
dead&mdash;but by someone else."</p>

<p>"I've thought of the same possibility myself," Moy said, "but
it seems so far-fetched. Besides, it would mean that someone was
in Gilmour's room, unknown to him, who fired through the open
door at the exact second that Gilmour did."</p>

<p>"Well? He would lift his arm to fire. There would be plenty of
time to know when he was going to pull the trigger." Her voice
sounded harsh, as though her throat were dry. "Mind you," she
went on hastily, "I wouldn't say this to the police for worlds.
Nor have them know I ever thought it." Her vehemence told Moy
that her nerves must be frightfully on edge. "But as you're our
friend&mdash;friend to all three of us, Charles, Edward, Gilmour
and to me&mdash;I know I can talk things over with you without
fear of consequences."</p>

<p>Moy assured her that she could. But he looked at her a trifle
oddly.</p>

<p>"As Gilmour thinks that he was alone," he went on, "your idea
would mean that some one hid in his room and stepped out just as
he himself stood in the doorway with the door open, and while
your brother was walking away down the passage."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "there is a built-in cupboard just by the
fireplace exactly opposite to the door. It's not used. The room
is carpeted from wall to wall."</p>

<p>"True," Moy said slowly, "he wouldn't have had even to step
out, just swing the cupboard door wide open...counting on the
fact that when Charles fell Gilmour would rush forward and leave
the bedroom door open...but I think I should have seen
him..."</p>

<p>"You too rushed to Charles's side. And were trying to find a
switch that would work," she said under her breath, her eyes wide
and dark.</p>

<p>It was true. He had paid no attention to the rest of the
passage except to the white mound on the floor outside Ingram's
room half-way down.</p>

<p>"That would mean that your supposed murderer was a good deal
taller than Gilmour&mdash;which might easily be, for he's
short&mdash;or have stood on a hassock."</p>

<p>"There is a hassock in that room, a huge leather one." She
twisted her fingers tightly together on her knee.</p>

<p>"He'd have to be a crack shot, as well as a particularly
callous brute," Moy finished hotly. Mrs. Appleton kept her eyes
fastened on her tightly clenched hands. "Yes," she said so low
that he barely caught it. "Or have been mad."</p>

<p>"Mad! No madness in such a plan!" he retorted almost
reprovingly.</p>

<p>"But madness is wanting a fortune at any cost&mdash;at any
price!" she finished still under her breath.</p>

<p>"But how would Ingram's death have given&mdash;" Moy stopped,
and suddenly he saw what all this meant. The woman's white face,
the horror in her dilated eyes...So Appleton had not been at home
last night. The alibi that she had given was false. She suspected
her husband of having murdered her brother...a horrible position.
But she had nothing to go on, surely...Of course Appleton was a
splendid shot. He got many an invitation on that account in the
autumn, and he was just the right height to have fired over
Gilmour's shoulder, or even over his head, at Ingram...But he
wouldn't know about that cupboard. Appleton had never been
upstairs in The Tall House. Besides, he couldn't be sure that his
wife would still inherit under her brother's will, though it
wouldn't be like Ingram to change his will without letting Mrs.
Appleton know...Where was Appleton, by the way? He had not seen
him except for a few minutes at the inquest. Moy remembered now
that he had come in after his wife and sat down some distance
away. Near the door.</p>

<p>"You didn't see anything that bears out my fantastic idea?"
she said, looking at him with tragic eyes. "I mean, now, thinking
back?"</p>

<p>He assured her that as he had just said, he thought the idea
not easily credible, but was not prepared to say it was quite
impossible.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then"&mdash;he saw her pass her tongue across her
lips&mdash;"if not impossible, it must be looked into. I mean
it's our duty to do so. For Charles's sake, and above all for
Lawrence Gilmour's sake! I can't imagine anything more horrible
to Charles than to have his friend suffer for something that he
never did."</p>

<p>"One has to think these things over very carefully, Mrs.
Appleton," Moy began. She flashed him an almost scathing
look.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I've thought of much else since&mdash;it first
occurred to me as a possibility," she said. "I hoped, I thought
that Mr. Gilmour might quite clear himself&mdash;I mean..." She
stopped and then went on with another sentence. "Friends talking
on the way home showed me that because of that article about the
sheet with the hole in the wrong place he's by no means cleared.
Who could have written it? It seems so motiveless. Just to throw
a wicked suspicion on him and not to carry it any further. It
couldn't be just a newspaper idea, could it? To help their
sales?"</p>

<p>Now Moy himself was rather thinking along those lines. Had he
known of any person belonging to that particular paper being at
The Tall House he would have thought of it much sooner. But this
smaller mystery sank into insignificance besides the one
concerning her husband...He must ask after him in common
decency...He rose and murmured something about her having given
him a great deal to think over, and the necessity of great care
in such matters. He supposed Appleton was out? And hoped she, the
children were well. Moy ran it all together in a sort of vague
mist of good hopes. She did not reply to his words.</p>

<p>"I'm going away for a long voyage with the children." She
seemed to be already far away. "That's why I had this talk with
you. You will know just what to do about everything."</p>

<p>Moy did not in the least share her confidence in his universal
knowledge. He could imagine few more perplexing positions. Any
careless move on his part, one incautious word, and the two
Appleton children would or might, be in the position of the
children of a suspected murderer. How could he help Gilmour
without harming them&mdash;Ingram's little nephews? He left the
house feeling as though a weight too heavy for him had been
suddenly thrust on him. He had completely forgotten Tark and any
talk with him. But that gentleman did not seem to mind being
forgotten. He had drawn up an easy chair to the window and sat
looking through the lace curtains, smoking a cigar, and now and
then entering figures in his note-book as Moy had so often seen
him doing. He put it in his pocket as Appleton passed the window.
A minute later the master of the house came in. Tark waited until
he had closed the door of the little room, before he rose from
his deep easy-chair. Appleton swung round with an exclamation as
he saw his guest.</p>

<p>"How did you get in? I had no idea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have been out each time that I asked for you before. Now
then, Appleton, what's your best offer?"</p>

<p>The two faced each other in silence. A long silence.
Appleton's forehead and lips began to twitch.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," he said at length.</p>

<p>"I think you do. Which is why you've refused to be in whenever
I've 'phoned. Now then, what's your best offer?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," Appleton repeated. He tried to speak
defiantly, but his voice suggested a bleat.</p>

<p>"Try a little harder," suggested Tark with a sardonic smile,
"for I don't want to go into details. I don't want to know them.
I'm quite willing that you should enjoy what you've run such
risks to get."</p>

<p>"I haven't run any risks. I haven't got hold of anything!"
came from Appleton fiercely. Tark waved him away with his hand as
though he were a smoke ring.</p>

<p>"I'm quite willing, as I say, not to start any unpleasant
inquiries, provided you give me a written understanding that we
go shares in your&mdash;we'll call it 'purchase.' Fifty-fifty,
Appleton. Come now!"</p>

<p>"You're mad!" came angrily from Appleton, whose eyebrows were
going up and down like some sign in a window. "Mad! Fifty-fifty?
For what?"</p>

<p>Tark came quite close. "For your neck, Appleton. Fifty per
cent is none too high for that, and I mean to have that promise.
Or hand you over to the police. I know you've got
the&mdash;information&mdash;I want. And I know how you got it.
And if the police knew the first fact, they too would know the
second. At present, they're hunting for a motive. One word from
me, Appleton, one word as to what I expected them to find among
Ingram's papers, and what becomes of you? You with your double
motive, that paper, and Ingram's will?"</p>

<p>"You're all wrong! All wrong!" Appleton said hotly. "He gave
me the paper. Handed it to me as a free gift."</p>

<p>Tark's short, low, sneering laugh was his answer to that last
assertion.</p>

<p>"Your wife feels as sure of that as I do," he said. "It's
true!" flamed out Appleton suddenly. "Damn you, it's true! She's
been talking to you, has she!"</p>

<p>Tark eyed him with the intent, unmoved, watching gaze of a man
accustomed to use his fellow-men, to make the most of any
opportunity that came his way.</p>

<p>"No matter how I learned about it," he said briefly, "I do
know, that's enough. Now then, what about the offer in writing
for which I'm here, to be left behind when we set off for foreign
parts? Just in case history should repeat itself, eh? Just you
and me on a trip together&mdash;Fred Ingram is still
hunting."</p>

<p><br> <br> Chief Inspector Pointer had taken the bus ticket to
the head office. There they told him that it had been punched
late on the evening on which Ingram had been shot, and was for
the distance from before Markham Square to a little beyond the
street in which was The Tall House. He was now for the first time
able to see the ticket collector who had been on duty at the
time. Pointer reminded him that it was the night of the heat
wave, one of the hottest nights in England for the last fifty
years. The man remembered it perfectly. He had only had one
passenger inside. A tall chap with a twitchy face. He remembered
him, because he had jumped off the bus so hastily on catching
sight of a friend on the pavement that he had all but fallen
headlong in the road. The conductor had steadied him.</p>

<p>"Did you see his friend? The man on the pavement?"</p>

<p>"He was just turning a corner. Couldn't catch sight of his
face."</p>

<p>So that Appleton, for the description fitted him, must have
known the man quite well to have recognized him from that
glimpse.</p>

<p>"Was your fare any of these?" Pointer laid some photographs
before the man.</p>

<p>"That's him!" The collector touched Appleton's picture. "He's
often up and down our way. Lives along there."</p>

<p>He had not seen him in company with any of the other faces
shown him. Did he see the actual meeting between the passenger
and the man on the pavement? "A bit of it." His fare had hurried
after the other man, overtaken him, and caught hold of his elbow.
They seemed quite friendly. At least the other had not snatched
his arm away. Pointer further learned that the pedestrian might
well have been Ingram, though this was purely negative, inasmuch
as the man had not been old, nor big, nor fat...</p>

<p>Pointer next went on to see Appleton, and that was how he came
to send in his name just as Tark was putting a folded paper away
in his letter-case while Appleton stood watching him with a face
of fury. Tark shot a swift glance around as the maid entered with
"a gentleman to see you, sir," and held out Pointer's card.</p>

<p>"I'll go out that way," Tark breathed in the other's ear, and
made for the double door leading into some other room. Appleton
detained the maid.</p>

<p>"When you've shown, the gentleman in, show this other out. Be
sure he goes at once."</p>

<p>Pointer looked very grave and very stiff.</p>

<p>"Mr. Appleton, why have you not told us that you walked back
to The Tall House with Mr. Ingram the night on which he was shot?
That you had a talk with him in the library there." This was
guess work, due to the ticket, and Mrs. Appleton's interest in
cigarette ash. Appleton was smoking a very peculiar Greek brand
of cigarette.</p>

<p>"For the very good reason that I did none of these things,"
Appleton said sharply. His twitchy face was absolutely still as
he turned it to the other. Pointer felt as though it were held so
rigid that a finger pressed against the cheek would not even make
a dent.</p>

<p>"You were recognized," he said warningly.</p>

<p>"I couldn't have been, since I wasn't there," Appleton tossed
back in as firm a voice. "What you mean, chief inspector, is that
someone thought he recognized me. He made a mistake. I often did
drop in for a chat with my brother-in-law, but not as it happens
on that evening." He drummed on the table. His fidgets began to
come back, now that the strain for which he had pulled himself
together had gone, or lessened.</p>

<p>"Pity," Pointer said thoughtfully. "You might have been able
to help us. Supposing Mr. Ingram's death was not accident, can't
you suggest anything, Mr. Appleton, which might have been a
motive for his murder?"</p>

<p>Again the face stiffened, grew still and set.</p>

<p>"His work, for instance," Pointer went on, not apparently
glancing at the other man, "or something connected with his
writing."</p>

<p>Appleton was quite pale, but he shook his head. He sat down in
a chair so hastily that it looked as though he fell into it.</p>

<p>"The inquest has just decided that it was death by
misadventure," he said in a curiously halting voice. "I don't
pretend, chief inspector, that I think things don't look
odd...anyone could have tampered with that revolver, as I've said
from the beginning." He shot an odd, sly look at the chief
inspector, sly and yet determined. "I don't pretend to agree with
the finding of the inquest," he said again. "I'm glad you're
looking into the matter." He did not look glad, but he did look
oddly persistent and haunted.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a horrid sort of fear that perhaps it wasn't an
accident," he went on. "I had intended to say nothing about such
a possibility, but&mdash;well&mdash;somehow I feel it would be
letting Ingram down. I have an idea he had some cipher or other
of great potential value, and that he was murdered for that..."
Appleton threw out his chest and pulled himself in until he
looked like a majestic pouter pigeon. His dark, large, flat eyes
fastened themselves on the chief inspector's face. "Don't you
think yourself, chief inspector, that there's something odd about
the affair?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It's quite an idea," Pointer replied evasively, and as though
much struck by its novelty. "But can't you suggest what sort of a
cipher...where we ought to look for the criminal if there is
one?"</p>

<p>No. Appleton assured him that he had only a vague uneasiness
that things were not right, but that he had no idea as to who
could possibly want to murder his brother-in-law.</p>

<p>"Of course if it was a cipher," Pointer murmured, as though
confiding in his cigarette&mdash;one of Ingram's&mdash;"one
wonders whether his proof-reader wouldn't know something about
it..."</p>

<p>Appleton drew in a quick breath, his eyes bulged for a moment
but he said nothing, only tapped the knuckle of his first finger
reflectively against his teeth, which gave him an odd appearance
of uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Possible," he muttered. "That's really what I wondered.
Whether...it's a ghastly idea, suspecting this person and that,
but if it was anything to do with his papers, why of course
Frederick Ingram would be by way of knowing about it..."</p>

<p>Appleton leaned forward, one hand on the table, a white,
well-kept hand but thin and hollow-sinewed; the hand of a man
who was really very ill.</p>

<p>"It's ghastly for everyone," he went on in a tired voice, "I
mean anyone who also feels uneasy, not to know who did it. But in
confidence, chief inspector, I think you ought to keep an eye on
him&mdash;and on Tark," he added vindictively and suddenly.</p>

<p>"I thought you were doing that," Pointer said innocently.</p>

<p>Appleton turned very gray. "Tark? I, or no, he...I...no, I
hardly know him," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Yet you correspond..." Pointer seemed puzzled. "I may as well
tell you that I saw a letter from you to him&mdash;" So Pointer
had, but in Tark's letter-case. Appleton had a very odd writing,
rather beflourished and with exaggerated capitals.</p>

<p>"Oh, merely a reply to a question that came up once at The
Tall House," Appleton said swiftly. "We were discussing some
question of engine power of the new little B.S.A. cars, you know
the ones with the fluid Daimler drive, and I stated definitely
some figure which surprised Tark. When I got home I found that I
had misread a statement of the B.S.A. Co. chairman's, and wrote
putting right my mistake." His fiat eyes flitted nervously across
the other's impassive face. Pointer could not tell him he was a
liar. It was a possible explanation but Tark hardly looked the
kind of man to carry such a letter around with him. And the
envelope that Pointer had seen in his case was quite well
worn.</p>

<p>When Pointer left, together with Appleton's cigarette, he knew
that Appleton had been to The Tall House for some
reason&mdash;after some object&mdash;that he could not, or would
not, avow. That search of Mrs. Appleton's for some paper or
papers...it looked to Pointer as though her husband had got it,
or them, since he himself made no effort to rummage among
Ingram's belongings. But Tark had done so, and Tark had been
followed to this house, and had been heard several times asking
for Appleton over the 'phone. He knew that he was in the house
when he himself had arrived. Pointer's watcher had told the chief
inspector that Tark had come quite openly. Was that because he
had to? Because Appleton would not meet him outside? Pointer
would learn with interest whether Tark now discontinued his
search or not. From the look of purple fury on Appleton's face,
he, Pointer, would not be surprised if Tark had got the better of
the other in some battle of wits or wills or threats. The
question was&mdash;even supposing that Appleton had got some
document for which the other, and possibly his wife too, had been
looking&mdash;did it stand for anything in Ingram's death? Mrs.
Appleton had shown plainly enough, Pointer thought, that she
suspected something of the kind She had left Markham Square at
once after the tragedy and gone, with her two little boys, to her
dead brother's flat at Harrow, merely notifying Gilmour of the
fact after she had installed herself, saying that the children
needed fresher air than they were having in Chelsea and that she
would see to it that they did not overflow into his rooms.
Gilmour had assured her that the entire flat was at her disposal
for as long as she would like to stay there.</p>

<p>Mrs. Appleton's face and manner quite negatived&mdash;to
Pointer&mdash;the idea that she had come on some clue pointing to
her husband which she had suppressed, and that her husband felt
himself safe for that reason. Appleton did not look as though he
felt himself safe. Quite the contrary. Appleton looked a man
living in the shadow of some fear, but Pointer thought that the
fear was a definite, not a vague one. There were parts of his
path in which he felt himself quite safe, and parts where he
inwardly trembled, so the chief inspector, an unusually astute
and penetrating observer, read the man. Tark disclaimed all
knowledge of Appleton, as Appleton did of him. Appleton had
traveled a good deal...gambled a good deal...Tark lived near
Monte Carlo...Mrs. Pratt came from Geneva...VON OF DE which the
expert still claimed was part of a cipher...Mrs. Pratt had once
had a maid who was an international spy...HELL LIGHT CLAIRE...The
tobacco shreds under the pillow, and yet Ingram's waistcoat,
empty of everything that could interest anyone, lying on his
chair. The inner secret pocket with its fastening...Did they all
belong together, or were they but shattered bits of many circles?
He was thinking them over as he left Appleton, left without any
inquiry as to Tark. Let Appleton think himself unobserved, his
next step in that case might be a helpful one as to settling his
own status in the death of his brother-in-law.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER 13</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN the chief inspector had left him, Appleton
fell back into a chair looking as though he were half-fainting.
For a long minute he lay passive, breathing hard, then he got
better, and sitting up, dived into an inner pocket of his
waistcoat, a pocket rather on the style of his dead brother-in-law's.
From it he drew an envelope of oiled silk, such as is used
by travelers to carry soap. From it he took another envelope and
from this a paper covered with minute but very legible figures
and writing.</p>

<p>He bent over it. So engrossed was he that he did not hear a
light step come into the hall. After a minute his study door was
opened, and his wife came in carrying some flowers in her hand.
She turned with a start. So did he. The paper slid from his knee.
In an instant she and he both swooped on it. He, being nearer,
got it first. She turned, her face a dreadful, livid white, and,
with her hand outstretched before her as though suddenly stricken
blind, made for the door. But, again, he got there first.</p>

<p>He drew himself up, hand on knob, and thrust out his chest in
his pouter pigeon attitude. "Ada!" came in round sonorous tones.
"What do you mean by looking at me like that?"</p>

<p>"I think I knew all along," she said under her breath, her
eyes now half-closed. "And because of the children, I have to
stand by and do nothing. As you knew that I would!"</p>

<p>"Charles gave it me," Appleton said to that, "he gave it me
himself."</p>

<p>She made a gesture of incredulity and despair, and seemed to
walk through him as white fire will cut through any
opposition.</p>

<p>Tark, meanwhile, had left the house in Markham Square
immediately the chief inspector arrived, and returned to The Tall
House. He was leaving that same afternoon, he said.</p>

<p>Now that the inquest was over, the household was fleeing as
though from a plague spot. Miss Longstaff asked for a word with
him. She began about the inquest first, which she had not
attended, then suddenly looked at him with that odd stare of
hers.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tark, I have a conviction that you know the motive for
Mr. Ingram's death."</p>

<p>He returned her stare with one as unreadable.</p>

<p>"You frighten me," he said, his tight lips hardly moving.
"Next thing, you'll be accusing me of having caused his death.
The inquest brought it in as 'Death by Misadventure,' you
know."</p>

<p>"You were hunting all yesterday on the quiet," she went on as
though he had not spoken, "for something definite, too. A paper
of some sort. Look here, why not take me in as a helper? I'm
desperately keen on solving this crime&mdash;if it was a
crime."</p>

<p>"You evidently think it was, from the position you've taken up
with regard to Gilmour," he replied indifferently. And his
indifference was real. This man did not care whether Ingram had
been shot by accident or of deliberate intention. She saw
that.</p>

<p>"It's the only possible position until things are clear," she
retorted, but without heat. "Come, Mr. Tark, why not let us work
together?"</p>

<p>There was open derision now in his unmerry smile that for a
second just loosened those closed lips of his. "I'm afraid I
shall not be able to help." There was no attempt at concealment
of the mockery in his tone. "I'm leaving for my home
tonight."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Haliburton going with you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Possibly. Possibly not. We occasionally leave each other's
side, Miss Longstaff. May I ask you why you thought he might be
coming with me? Did you think Miss Pratt and I were eloping, and
he would want to be the third?" The man's manner was courteous
enough, however jeering his tone, or his words. He held the door
open for her with almost a bow as she walked towards it. Miss
Longstaff looked at him, but not even the chief inspector could
read that face above hers, except that he now showed
intentionally a sardonic amusement at her effort to read it. He
said good-by, still in the same key, and then went in search of
Haliburton. That young man was pacing to and fro in the
drawing-room, evidently on the watch for Miss Pratt. He looked up
hopefully at Tark's light footfall, a step almost inaudible even
on creaky parquet.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said lamely, and again Tark permitted two lines to
crease each side of his mouth.</p>

<p>"I'm saying good-by." He came in. "I'm going back home
tonight. This sun makes me long for the real thing."</p>

<p>Haliburton nodded. He was not paying much attention.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought that she would take it like this!" he
burst out suddenly. Anyone less suitable as a confidant for
love's vaporings could not be imagined than the leather-faced
Tark, but he only nodded.</p>

<p>"You never know how the cards will run," he murmured. "By the
way, Haliburton, care to make a speculative investment? 'Big
Profits probable, Small Loss possible' sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by big profits?" Haliburton spoke as though
a trifle bored.</p>

<p>"Four hundred per cent." Tark's voice was low. "This is
entirely confidential, mind you. Even the offer, I mean. Even the
existence of the offer. But if you like to let me have five
hundred, I can promise you two thousand in three months' time, to
the day."</p>

<p>"You can have the five hundred," Haliburton said after a
moment's thought. "But as a personal loan. To be used in any way
you like. And I want no interest on it."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Tark said briefly. "But you've missed a chance. As a
matter of fact, I wouldn't have made the offer to anyone but
you."</p>

<p>As is human nature, when the offer was not pressed, it tempted
more.</p>

<p>"Then you did have your talk with Ingram?" Haliburton asked.
"You told me that if it was successful you'd have a magnificent
proposition to offer a friend."</p>

<p>"It turned out not to be necessary," Tark said, and for a
second a corner of his lifted lip showed his teeth.</p>

<p>"Well, good-by then, and thank you for getting me in here as a
guest."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that's hardly a pleasant experience." Haliburton
did not smile. "Well, come in before you go. I'll have my check
ready for you. Unless you would rather have it in notes?"</p>

<p>"I would rather," Tark said.</p>

<p>Haliburton replied that in that case he would go round to his
bank of which a branch was very near and cash a check
himself.</p>

<p>Again Tark said that he would prefer it like that. "Best of
wishes about Miss Pratt," he said as he moved to the door
again.</p>

<p>Haliburton's face looked sad. "It's no use, Tark, she's
bewitched. She's entirely wrapped up in pity for Gilmour."</p>

<p>"Who wants none of it," Tark finished callously, "and I'd give
you back a fiver to know why."</p>

<p>"Why what?" Haliburton looked like a man holding himself in
with difficulty, who has resolved, however, to pretend to feel no
pricks.</p>

<p>"Why he won't have her pity. What he sees in that Longstaff
girl. There's a crabbed filly, for you. She'd love to see him
hang. Well, she may yet." And after this, for him, amazingly long
speech, Tark went upstairs, and rang for his suitcases to be
packed. That done, he went in search of Gilmour for a last word.
But Gilmour was out. He was in Moy's office, and that was the
reason the solicitor had not stayed longer with Mrs. Appleton.
Just now the two young fellows were both looking tremendously
stirred up. Gilmour was speaking.</p>

<p>"I appreciate your reason for trying to dissuade me, Moy, but
I've stumbled on something very odd...You know, I've been certain
that Ingram died just as I described it. But&mdash;" He stopped
and seemed to fall into a brown study. Moy stared at him
expectantly. "Well?" he asked, as the other said nothing. "Well?
Have you told the police about it?"</p>

<p>Gilmour shook his head, and Moy wondered if the clue led to
Appleton, for Gilmour was a sort of unofficial uncle to the two
Appleton children.</p>

<p>He waited in great anxiety for the next words.</p>

<p>"It's nothing they could deal with," Gilmour said slowly.
"It's not a clue&mdash;yet. It's only existence&mdash;so
far&mdash;is in someone's recollection of something. Well,
they're hardly likely to go all out on such a foundation. But as
it happens, a chance word has made me remember something too,
that half fits...might fit..." He broke off again.</p>

<p>"Whose was the memory that jogged yours?" Moy asked.</p>

<p>"Miss Longstaff let slip something&mdash;oh, she had no idea
of any importance in what she said&mdash;but it fitted most oddly
into something&mdash;" and again to Moy's impatience, Gilmour
stopped.</p>

<p>"I hope you're going to let me in on whatever it is," Moy said
promptly. What could Alfreda Longstaff know? But Gilmour went on
to dash his hopes.</p>

<p>"I don't want to talk about it to anyone. But I wish you would
take charge of this envelope"&mdash;he took one out of his
pocket&mdash;"and if I don't turn up by this time next week, or
you haven't heard from me over the 'phone, I want you to hand it
in yourself to Chief Inspector Pointer. Look, it's addressed to
him. Now I'll enclose it in this blank one, on which I scribble
your name." Gilmour proceeded to do so. "Have you a candle and
some wax?" Moy had. Gilmour sealed the covering envelope and
handed it to the other. "Everything is in that. It tells what I'm
after, and why. But for heavens' sake don't let any one read it
unless I don't come back, for I'm quite frank in it, and say
precisely to whom my information points. Someone who may be
perfectly innocent."</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't come back, the likelihood is that they
aren't innocent," Moy said reasonably enough.</p>

<p>"By God!" Gilmour spoke in a tone of passion that startled the
other, "I'd be willing enough not to come back, if that would be
a help!"</p>

<p>Then his voice became calm once more. "I want you to explain
to Miss Longstaff tomorrow." He looked at Moy with rather a
hangdog look. "You know, I think it's very fine of her, I mean,
not being willing to marry a man whom she thinks capable of
murdering his friend. That she does think me that, isn't her
fault. I know whose tongue has dropped sweet poison into her
ears! But about Alfreda, there aren't too many standards in the
world, and it's up to the women, the young women, as I see it, to
keep their flags flying."</p>

<p>"Unless like Miss Pratt they believe you incapable of murder,"
Moy said to that. "Frankly, since you've brought the subject up,
I must say that's the attitude I prefer in a girl."</p>

<p>Gilmour was not listening. He was intent on giving the other
very careful instructions connected with that letter.</p>

<p>"I said to hand it on, unless you hear from me over the
'phone. Well, I want to arrange with you about that. If you get a
message that sounds sensible enough, but as though it referred to
something about which you know nothing, then I want you to take
it as an S.O.S. and hand that letter on as I asked you just now.
What I mean is this: Suppose you hear me&mdash;undeniably near
the end of the wire saying something like this: ''Fraid I shan't
be able to come down with you to the Smiths' cocktail party
tonight' or 'You'll have to count me out for the box I promised
to share' or any other excuse about my not being able to be, or
go, somewhere of which we've never spoken, then you'll understand
that it's an appeal for the Yard's help. You see, if I were in a
tight place, I might spoof the people who had me there into
letting me telephone you some perfectly innocent sounding excuse
as to why I couldn't turn up with you, but, as I say, you'll know
what it really means, and will act at once."</p>

<p>They discussed it for fully another minute. Moy rather shrank
from such a frightful responsibility, but apparently it was the
best thing that Gilmour could arrange in his own protection,
flimsy though it seemed to Moy. He begged Gilmour to be more open
with him. Gilmour thought it over for a while, then shook his
head.</p>

<p>"I think it would only arouse suspicion. But I'll tell you
this: I shouldn't be surprised if I had to leave England to
follow the clue I'm after, or rather to get hold of it. More than
that I can't say. But I assure you you couldn't help half as much
by knowing what I'm going to try to do, as you will by sitting on
that letter. I may not need it, in which case when I'm back I'll
either ask for it again and burn it, or let you open and read it.
But should I be on the right track, and should that track lead me
into a hole, it'll be a wonderfully pleasant thought to know that
you have it and will pass it on at a word from me. No, I won't
say more. And I won't even tell you how I mean to make what the
Hollywood films call my getaway. Which is a pity. For I'm
fearfully proud of it&mdash;my plan, I mean. But you'd much
better know nothing."</p>

<p>In that much Moy agreed with him.</p>

<p>"You won't get clear," he said confidently, and warningly,
"and for your own sake, as I've said a dozen times in this
interview already, you mustn't try it. We both know you're being
watched. Of course you are! You'd never be able to show a clean
pair of heels to a Yard man, and the attempt would only be
absolutely misunderstood. Seriously misunderstood. And frankly,
well, you know yourself you can't afford that! Which is the sole
and only reason why I don't insist on coming with you."</p>

<p>Gilmour only gave a little confident laugh. "Wait and see!"
was all he said as he finally left the other.</p>

<p>He went back to The Tall House, his head full of his plans.
There he asked if Miss Longstaff were in. She was, and he found
her in the library putting some books back in their place. It was
amazing how popular the library was with three at least of the
women connected with The Tall House and two of the men.</p>

<p>"Alfreda, I've come to say good-by&mdash;for a little while."
Gilmour tried to hold Alfreda's long, rather bony, fingers in
his, but she drew them away quite sharply.</p>

<p>"Well, good-by then," was her calm reply. He looked at her in
silence for a long minute, rather a pathetic look on his face,
helpless and pleading. It softened her for one instant "I wish I
knew," he said finally, and quite frankly, "what has changed you
so. I thought&mdash;once&mdash;that you cared for me.
I&mdash;I&mdash;was sure of it."</p>

<p>"Quite so," all softness had gone from Alfreda now, "quite
sure of it, as you say! So sure that you thought you could come
and collect me any old time like a parcel left to be kept till
called for." Her tone was venomous.</p>

<p>"My mistake, I see," he said quietly. "You lived in a little
village&mdash;we hadn't known each other long. How could you be
sure of your own heart&mdash;or&mdash;or I of mine?"</p>

<p>"Well, we're both sure of our own hearts now," was her reply
with a little laugh. "You of yours, and I of mine!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!" He spoke warmly now. "No, I refuse to
believe it. You're vexed with me. Something has spoiled it
all&mdash;for the moment, but I'm as sure that you'll yet come to
look on all this as a momentary madness as I am of anything in
life. And I wish more than I can say, I'm not a clever chap at
words, that you'd trust me. And be again as you were those days
at Bispham." His voice was very tender. Again for a half second
she hesitated. Was she all wrong? Jaundiced? Unfair?</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I can't feel like that&mdash;not since
what has happened here."</p>

<p>"You really think I had a conscious, intentional hand in that
dreadful blunder?" he asked.</p>

<p>She did not reply except by her silence and that unreadable
stare of hers fixed unwinkingly on him.</p>

<p>"If that horrible thought is all that stands between us, then
I don't think it will stand long." He spoke in a low eager tone.
"But I wish you'd be frank with me."</p>

<p>"I don't think you do," she retorted, her chin in the air. "Or
if you do, you're mistaken. You wouldn't really wish me to tell
you all I think about&mdash;us&mdash;Mr. Ingram's
shooting&mdash;everything."</p>

<p>"If you would tell me why you have this awful suspicion," he
went on doggedly, "supposing it's really yours and not just
suggested to you by someone else then it might help me. Wait!" as
she would have spoken, "you said something the other
morning&mdash;oh, no, if you won't be frank, neither will I be
now, which&mdash;" He fell silent, gazing out of the window with
wide open eyes and a sort of breathless look to his face. He
stood like that for a full second before he went on quietly.
"Which fits in with something I know which I thought of no use,
no importance...but as we're not to be friends&mdash;yet&mdash;I
won't say more. When I can clear myself I shall speak again
Alfreda, and again ask you to marry me, and if I'm successful in
what I'm going after, I don't think you will refuse me next time.
Tell me, if I can clear myself
absolutely&mdash;undeniably&mdash;of any suspicion of having
killed Ingram intentionally, your answer would be yes?"</p>

<p>Again, in spite of herself, Alfreda was touched by tone and
look, and by his words too. Supposing, just supposing, that her
suspicions were all wrong, what an utter beast she had been, was
being. She drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"I don't think you could ever forgive me for acting as I've
done," she said in a voice which, for her, was quite faltering,
"and I don't think I should care to be forgiven and have to live
with my forgiver&mdash;" Her smile had real mischief in it for
once, "but if you can explain Ingram's death, the puzzle of it
all, why, of course, I should be more than glad! More than
thankful! But how are you going to set about it? How can you hope
to solve this puzzle?"</p>

<p>"I have an idea where to look and what to look for," he said
guardedly. "I can't be franker now, but when I reappear, you
shall hear everything."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're going to disappear?" The old tone was back now,
the old look in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Take that as confidential, please," he spoke almost sternly,
"that much at least I have a right to claim from you."</p>

<p>"You have no right to claim anything!" she retorted hotly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have. That much of loyalty." And his tone shamed
her.</p>

<p>She put out her hand swiftly. "I wish I could feel
differently. I think I haven't a heart&mdash;just a sort of
onlooker's interest in life...but I do honestly hope you'll
succeed in clearing yourself. Not just because of what I think of
you, but for"&mdash;she faltered under his steady gaze&mdash;"for
humanity's sake," she finished almost shamefacedly. And she
watched him go with a sudden feeling of ridiculously illogical
remorse. Supposing he did&mdash;could&mdash;&mdash;clear himself
absolutely, which both knew could only be done by bringing the
guilt home to another&mdash;how she would feel! How small, how
mean, how shriveled of heart.</p>

<p>She was still standing there, lost in thought, when Moy came
back from his talk with Mrs. Appleton, and was still standing
there when Mrs. Appleton herself was shown in. The butler thought
that Moy was in the library. Even in her mood of intense
preoccupation Alfreda noticed the look on the other woman's face,
and in her eyes, a look of blank despair, of utter misery.</p>

<p>It startled her. Coming just after her talk with Gilmour and
his words, it seemed to open a vista to her of something which
might be in his mind...but surely she, Alfreda, could not be
wrong in what she had hitherto called her intuition about the
identity of the real criminal in this case?</p>

<p>Mrs. Appleton barely nodded to her. She wanted a word with Mr.
Moy, she said, very urgently. Moy hurried in to the little parlor
where she stood nervously playing with her gloves. She refused a
chair. She wanted, she said, to see him about her brother's
will.</p>

<p>"I want you to arrange for endowing scholarships at
Pembroke&mdash;that was his college, and he loved it&mdash;and
perhaps a couple of scholarships at his old school, Clifton, if
the money will run to it. I want everything that remains, after
putting aside all that may be necessary to safeguard Mr. Gilmour,
to be used in one of these two ways or both. I don't want my
brother's money. I know he really would have liked to do this
himself, and only left me the money because he thought I might
need it. I don't."</p>

<p>Moy looked at her in surprise. What a whirlwind way of doing
things people seemed to be developing just lately.</p>

<p>"But what about Appleton?" Moy explained to her that, owing to
the terms of her marriage settlements, she would have to have her
husband's consent to any such proposal. "Not that there's any
hurry," he said pleasantly, "you've no idea how long it takes to
wind up an estate. And you've got to allow in your mind for the
death duties, which will take about..."</p>

<p>He was prepared to go into detail, but she did not want to
listen.</p>

<p>"I'm not interested, you see, in his estate," she said
finally, "having no need of it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the children?" Moy knew that only Ingram's help had sent
the two boys to the preparatory school at which they were just
started.</p>

<p>"They won't need it either," she said resolutely with a
twisted smile that left him a little alarmed for her sanity. And
then she said a word about doing his utmost to help Gilmour clear
himself, no matter where the trail might lead. Again she looked
at him, and again Moy felt a little shiver at the look in her
eyes. If ever a woman looked as though her sanity were rocking,
Mrs. Appleton did. She left him after he had agreed to do as she
wished, by which he meant to mark time until her nerves were in
better trim. It was all very well to help Gilmour, he reflected
with a smile almost as twisted as Mrs. Appleton's, but Gilmour
was intending to help himself, and that by taking a step which,
in Moy's judgment, meant disaster immediate and absolute.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he was wrong.</p>

<p>Gilmour's method of escape, as he called it, was simplicity
itself, and like many simple things, it worked. He went to his
club, and took a room for two nights, there, telling the chief
inspector where he was going. Quite unnecessary this last, as
both men knew. Then he went to bed and slept for the first night
since the death of Ingram. Next morning at half-past six, a
red-haired, shock-headed man in his shirt sleeves and wearing a green
baize apron came down the steps swinging a brown paper parcel in
one hand. Under his arm was a broom. The club was on the
corner&mdash;he lit a gasper and walked round it, still dangling
his parcel by its string. It was obviously a suit of clothes for
the pressers. The watcher continued to keep an eye on the
building as instructed. It was a languid eye, for the room had
been taken for two nights, and nothing about Gilmour at The Tall
House had suggested a passionately early riser. Once well around
the corner, Gilmour took off his green baize apron and took out
of the paper parcel a coat, rather a threadbare affair, which he
now carried on his arm, leaving broom and baize apron around yet
another bend. Down a street he hurried, and turning off it again,
added a cap to his outfit, and arrived at that street's end
looking like any of a thousand breadwinners walking to his job.
He had paid a royal tip to the man to get apron and broom, a tip
and a hint as to a most excruciatingly good joke to be played,
and a bet to be won, through their means.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER 14</h2>

<p class="first">NEXT morning Chief Inspector Pointer found a
letter waiting for him at the Yard which he opened before any of
the other correspondence in his basket. It was in Gilmour's
rather sprawling writing and ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">
Dear Chief Inspector Pointer</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">I am sorry if my going away bothers your inquiry in any way, and I
know that, strictly speaking, I should not have tried to dodge
your man, but a clue has come my way, or rather it has been in
front of me all the time, but I have only just recognized it as
what it is. I am on the right road, I know, but should I find
things getting too hot for me, I may be glad of your assistance.
In which case I will manage to get a message through to you. I
only hope that you will not take my disappearance as a sign of
guilt, but I must risk that.</p>

<p class="letter">Faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Lawrence Gilmour</span>.</p>

<p><br>
Pointer docketed the letter and reached for another. He knew
already how Gilmour had got away, and a certain watcher was even
now sadly making for a provincial town where detection might be
simpler an demand less keen wits. For the moment, there was no
possibility of laying hands on Gilmour, and Pointer therefore
dismissed him from his mind. He had many things to see to this
morning. There was his&mdash;to him&mdash;engrossing hunt for a
missing person who should fulfil the few stipulations that he had
laid down. Town seemed to be half-empty, judging by the accounts
that had already come in of people who were no longer seen in
their accustomed places. Pointer flung most of them into the
discard as soon as he glanced at them, but there were a few which
he reserved for inquiries.</p>

<p>As for the party at The Tall House, it had broken up with a
vengeance yesterday. Mrs. Pratt and Winnie were in a Dover Street
hotel. Later on it was understood that the mother had accepted an
invitation for both of them on Haliburton's yacht. Haliburton
himself had left his usual club and home addresses with the
police, but at this time of the year he generally spent a
fortnight anonymously with one of his boys' camps at the seaside,
acting, it was said, merely as a friendly scoutmaster, and hiding
the fact of his being the provider of the camp from all but a few
of the men helping him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Appleton was leaving as soon as possible for Capetown,
where she had friends. Appleton would not be able to go with her,
he had explained, but as he too needed a change, he was going
over to Paris almost at once.</p>

<p>Tark had told the police that he was off for his home in
Beausoleil and was likewise leaving today. Miss Longstaff had
left The Tall House last night, giving an address near
Hammersmith Broadway, where she had taken a room. She had no
intention of leaving England.</p>

<p>Frederick Ingram had left last night by 'plane for Paris, and
already Pointer knew that he had gone on at daybreak to
Marseilles. The south of France is not often chosen in midsummer,
especially by as poor a sailor as Pointer had learned that
Frederick Ingram was, unless there is some strong attraction. In
his case, since he still seemed devoted to Winnie Pratt, Pointer
fancied that it was the green of the tables rather than of the
waves that drew him. The chief inspector would have to see for
himself if this were so or not, and also why Tark seemed to have
such a sudden attack of home sickness just now. He had a word
with the assistant commissioner before leaving.</p>

<p>"You think the case can breathe by itself, that you won't have
to stay to apply artificial respiration?" Pelham asked him.</p>

<p>Pointer said that there was no reason why he should not absent
himself for a short time, especially as all the wheels would turn
just as well without him as with him.</p>

<p>The other shook his head. "Too modest, Pointer. Fatal flaw in
an otherwise sensible man. However, perhaps you'll give me just a
notion of what your merry men will be at?"</p>

<p>"Overcoming an osmotic reluctance to seeping through the
cilia, sir," Pointer said gravely. One of the superintendents
came in at that moment, and stared at him with a dropped jaw.
Pelham burst out laughing, and gave Pointer his blessing. "Any
special time limit?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, there's something that may help us coming along
shortly. And that's quarter day."</p>

<p>"Next week," murmured the superintendent mechanically.</p>

<p>"Just so, sir. Hitherto for some five years past Mr. Ingram
had a thousand pounds to dispose of just after that date. It's
possible some or all of it may come in to his estate...I'm rather
counting on that...until then we must just seep, as I said," and
he was off.</p>

<p>He traveled as plain Mr. Pointer, and went directly to Cannes.
The air service has tremendously shortened that weary journey to
Marseilles. In his case he flew directly to the little town
itself lying in a half-circle around its Croisette. He had often
been there before. Pointer was no lover of the Riviera. Many
other parts of France have wonderful things to show, but Cannes,
to him, holds all the vice of Monte Carlo, all its rapacity, its
misery, its pitilessness, only with a little more gilding. He
dined at the Casino where the prices, at our rate of exchange,
made him decide to do a little slimming. Frederick Ingram was
there at a table well in front of Pointer, who sat in a corner
near the door.</p>

<p>Frederick did not order a long meal. He looked like a man in a
sort of pleasant dream, but a dream which entailed a lot of
looking at a little black note-book that he carried in an inner
pocket. After his dinner, he made for the gaming rooms, greatly
to Pointer's interest, for baccarat had been the young man's
passion in former days. But he passed that great chamber, passed
the Boule room and finally took a seat at a table at the end of
the Roulette room. Pointer had learned from a word with the head
of the Casino detectives that Frederick had played at that table
and in that room last night, winning all the time, but playing
for modest stakes, so that he came away with about ten thousand
francs.</p>

<p>"It's not any system we have come up against before," the head
detective added, "but it must have been one from the fact that in
the beginning he noted every stake in a little pocket-book. As he
did nothing but win he stopped his entries but he consulted it
regularly each time before staking."</p>

<p>Pointer was exceedingly interested. There are several cast-iron
systems of playing roulette, by which, in the long run, the
player is bound to win. The trouble is that the run may be so
very long that a fortune has to be spent to win a few francs. Had
Fred Ingram got hold of a shorter, better one than any yet known?
If so, where had he found it? Pointer thought of that dusty
roulette wheel in a cupboard of Charles Ingram's flat. A system
was just the sort of thing that a genius at figures might have
devised. And apparently it had come into Fred Ingram's hands only
after his brother's death.</p>

<p>Pointer watched Fred seat himself with a certain air of
assurance. He staked, after consulting his little book with the
same air, and took his winnings with a smile that said that all
this was a matter of course. He won again and yet again, but he
always staked low. There was a flush on his cheeks and a light in
his eyes as he did so. The third time he lost, and then he lost
in an unbroken sequence for the next couple of hours. Yet in all,
Pointer calculated that he was only some thousand francs down
when he jumped up, his face which had first seemed only a little
troubled was now that of a man half beside himself with
amazement. He pushed back his chair onto the toes of another
waiting gambler, and hurried into the gardens, looking as though
he had received the shock of his life. He fairly ran to a seat
outside in the gardens under a lamp, and spread his pocket-book
open beside him, before drawing out with great difficulty
something from an inner pocket. It was a sheet of writing paper,
which he laid down and began to compare with his notes, figure by
figure.</p>

<p>Pointer came up behind him on the grass, fortunately the light
fell so that he cast no shadow, and waiting until Fred had buried
his nose in his pocket-book again, reached over, and snatched up
the paper. It was covered with what, to his sharp sight, were
Ingram's figures, those neat small figures of the dead
mathematician's, which looked as though drawn with tiny
wires.</p>

<p>Frederick whirled about with a shout, making a grab at his
property. But Pointer held it high in the air.</p>

<p>"I'll have you broken for this!" Frederick was very white
about the gills. "You've no more right to take that, than any
footpad has. Hand it back at once!"</p>

<p>"I want first to know that it is yours," was the reply. "You
see, Mr. Frederick Ingram, we are not satisfied that your
brother's death was not for the sake of something that he owned.
Say, a system of play. It might be considered by some people as
much more to be coveted than jewels or securities. This sheet of
paper was in your brother's possession at the time of his death.
How did it come into your hands?"</p>

<p>Pointer spoke with such an air of certainty that no one, not
even the assistant commissioner, let alone rattled Frederick
Ingram; would have known that he was guessing.</p>

<p>Frederick Ingram turned blue.</p>

<p>"You mean that you think Gilmour shot him intentionally?" he
asked, his eyes round and staring.</p>

<p>"That's just what you've maintained all along, isn't it?"
Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"But I didn't really believe it!" burst out Fred, his face
still shiny and streaked with red from his play in the hot rooms.
"I didn't really think it!" he repeated.</p>

<p>Pointer, looking at him, thought that excitement had broken
down the barriers of self-control as far as speech was concerned.
It can act as insidiously as scopolamin on some natures.</p>

<p>"It's quite possible that someone intentionally changed a
loaded for a blank cartridge in his little automatic," Pointer
said slowly, "someone who wanted something that Ingram refused to
hand him over." Frederick's eyes only looked excited, he said
nothing. "Come," Pointer went on pleasantly, "leaving that on one
side, suppose you tell me exactly how this paper came into your
possession. And when."</p>

<p>"I've lots of my brother's papers, of course&mdash;and books.
This was among some he handed to me a few days ago."</p>

<p>"You place yourself in a dangerous position," Pointer went on
very seriously, "unless you can establish the fact that it was
found by someone else&mdash;or that someone else was present when
you found it." Frederick seemed to think that very likely.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, Miss Pratt and I were looking through
Charles' books at my flat the afternoon of the day when he was
shot. I knew that such a paper existed. She didn't. She dropped
in to find something&mdash;any thing&mdash;that would prove that
those cartridges of Gilmour's were all blanks. The receipt from
his gunsmith was really in her mind, I think. But from the first
book that she picked up, by the merest chance, out flutters this.
She didn't know what it was, of course, and picked it up and put
it back until she had gone, but knew that my brother had devised
what he believed to be a unique system of winning at roulette. He
was certain that it was so perfect that any casino would purchase
it, if tried out at their tables." Here Fred Ingram gave a bitter
laugh. "I thought he couldn't be mistaken, but, my hat!" Again he
gave a laugh that was half a groan. "Fortunately, I tried it
quietly, or should be in queer street. It's an absolute wash-out
thought I must have made some mistake in copying out, but not a
bit of it! Besides, I knew I hadn't."</p>

<p>Pointer was looking at the paper which he had just taken from
him. At the top was written: System for Winning at Roulette. The
letters were Ingram's, and yet...the figures were his, and
yet...</p>

<p>Pointer himself could copy any writing with a lot of
mechanical accuracy, such as had been at work here. But there is
much more than that in a good forgery. Quite apart from the silly
notion that forgery is always done slowly, for only a half-wit
copies swift writing without at least equal speed, there is
something that cannot be put down on paper and yet which must be
imitated. A something much more subtle than accuracy of angle or
length of stroke. The more Pointer looked at the sheet before
him, looked at it as a whole, not into its details, the less did
it convey the peculiarly firm, settled, orderly, almost sedate
mind that the other writing of the dead man had done. He thought
it highly probable that what he held in his hand was a
forgery.</p>

<p>Another incidental confirmation was the fact that, as far as
he had yet seen, Ingram always wrote with an ordinary pen, this
was a similar nib to his, but had been written with a fountain-pen.
One thing was certain, this system, as he had seen, was
calculated to ruin anyone who staked high on it. Had Ingram
intended this? Had he reason to suspect that his life was in
danger?...Could this system be linked with those quarterly
thousand pound increases in his capital? Had he sold the original
system for a quarterly pension? This was a new possibility. But
there was a more immediate one. Was Frederick Ingram by playing
it, trying to place a shield between himself and any suspicion?
Say he had the real thing, and was only pretending that he had
been taken in by a worthless dud? Who better than he would know
Ingram's writing? Who could easier place a paper where he wanted
it found. Was it likely that Ingram the careful would have left
such a paper lying in a book?</p>

<p>He questioned Frederick cautiously on this last doubt.
Frederick could not but acknowledge the singularity of the place
where the so-called system had been found. But he suggested that,
as it had been devised some years ago, about five, he thought,
Ingram might have mislaid it. The book in question was one of
Arabic Equations which Ingram rarely opened. That, too, might
explain, Frederick went on to say, why his half-brother had quite
bruskly refused to discuss letting him have the system of which
he had himself once spoken as infallible.</p>

<p>There still remained the possibility that Frederick, having
openly played this travesty, would be freer, he might think, to
produce what he might claim was his own improvement or revision
of it, and play the real system devised by that brilliant
mathematician, Charles Ingram. He had staked very small sums last
night and tonight. He had lost only a matter of some fourteen
pounds. Pointer broached that question now. Frederick looked
awkward.</p>

<p>"It's odd. I'm generally a bit of a plunger. I meant to go all
out on this. But&mdash;somehow&mdash;at the last moment, when I
drew that pocket-book out and laid it beside me, I found myself
only willing to try it for small stakes. I can't account for it
myself." He looked genuinely puzzled.</p>

<p>Pointer eyed him closely with his seemingly indifferent
glance. Fred Ingram was a good actor, if he was not honest. But
then, if false, all this would have been carefully prepared, and
mentally rehearsed many times.</p>

<p>"You aren't going to try the system again?" he asked.</p>

<p>Frederick said that he was returning to England at once.
Having proved his half-brother's great idea to be a failure, he
intended to forget all about it. "After a flutter at baccarat,"
he added with a smile. "I brought a hundred with me with which to
break the bank, a lot of it still remains, thanks to my luck last
night, which I thought was the system. And thanks to that
unexpected wind of caution that suddenly blew on me when I sat
down at the tables."</p>

<p>The baccarat room at Cannes is a noble hall. Vaulted ceilings,
beneath which crystal chandeliers glitter like hanging baskets of
diamonds, luxurious chairs for those who wish to sit on a central
dais and watch the scene, while sipping cocktails or black
coffee.</p>

<p>Two long rows of baize-covered tables at some of which people
were standing three deep already. This is the Court of Midas.
There was silence in the big hall. Only the clack of chips and
the sound of the croupier's flat wooden rake as he called his
"<i>Banco. Mesdames, messieurs, marquez vos jeux. Rien ne va
plus.</i>" Frederick passed on to the next room, where the stakes
were still higher. Here he bought some brown thousand-franc
chips, others were playing with oblong blue chips worth ten times
his, and many with white ovals which represented a hundred times
his stakes. It was late. The hour of the real gamblers. The air
of the room was tense in here. Within a few minutes it was tenser
still. And when an hour was over Frederick Ingram was the richer
by the equivalent of ten million francs, roughly eighty thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>Pointer meanwhile had had another word with the chief of the
Casino detectives. Could a man have a system at baccarat or
chemin de fer? Impossible, the chief thought, as did Pointer. But
they were puzzled. It is held not to be possible for a man to win
at baccarat except by sheer luck, any more than he could cheat at
that nimble gamble which may run to thousands of pounds on the
draw of the all-important third card. The doubts of the two were
soon answered. When another hour had passed Frederick was the
poorer by some seventy-nine thousand eight hundred pounds.
Finally he made way for another player, his face all streaked
with the curious red that gambling brings out on a pale face. His
voice shook a little as he drew a deep breath outside. "Well, I'm
still my journey out and back in hand, and the hundred pounds
with which I started." He turned in at his hotel. Pointer who was
staying there too, asked him to his room. He did not think the
paper a shield any longer. After his first run of luck at
baccarat, Frederick would only have had to return to the roulette
table and try the real system, if he had it, claiming that his
luck was still holding. But he had left the Casino with no effort
to get back again the ephemeral fortune which had been his.</p>

<p>Pointer left his own door unlocked, making an excuse to pop
out and speak to Frederick as the latter was leaving, so as to
make him aware of this, just as he had placed the paper taken
from him on the mantel while he was still in the room.</p>

<p>No attempt was made on room, or paper, during what remained of
the night. If Frederick really left Cannes in the morning,
Pointer felt that he would have gone far to substantiate his
story. Frederick did, repeating that, after all, he had had a
change of air, and would be back home not a penny the worse, and
with the charming memory of having been worth eighty thousand
pounds for over half an hour.</p>

<p>Pointer stepped up into his compartment, which he had to
himself. There was still five full minutes before the train was
timed to start.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mr. Ingram, did you ever speak of your brother's
system to anyone?"</p>

<p>Frederick seemed to think back.</p>

<p>"I may have," he said, looking up. "It's the sort of thing
one's apt to mention."</p>

<p>"I very much want the names of anyone who knew of it, as well
as you."</p>

<p>"Well, of course my sister and her husband know. Charles spoke
about it once, before the three of us. Then, well, I think I once
told Mrs. Pratt about it, not that she was interested...I think
Miss Longstaff knew, too, whether from me or not, I can't say.
Haliburton? No, he didn't know. Gilmour? I fancy he must have
known, but I couldn't say for certain. You see, Charles never
referred to it after the one week during which he worked it
out."</p>

<p>Pointer saw him off, went back to his own room, and took out
the paper again. He had brought with him several letters of
Ingram's to Moy. He compared them all. Yes, he felt
sure&mdash;though experts could be asked to pronounce on it if it
should ever be necessary&mdash;that this paper was a forgery. It
was empty of all significance, and Ingram's writing had plenty of
personality. Who could have forged the paper, if it was a
forgery, as he assumed it to be? Someone who wanted to stop
Frederick's search? Therefore someone who knew both of that
hunt's purpose and of the existence of such a paper among
Ingram's effects? Someone had searched the bureau before Pointer
first saw it. Mrs. Appleton had hunted for what might well have
been just such a half-sheet as this...Appleton had been with
Ingram on the night that he died...</p>

<p>One thing the chief inspector expected, and that was, that if
someone had intentionally forged a system, the original was in
his possession, for there had been no interest of late in
Ingram's papers. Gilmour had never shown any. Nor had Haliburton.
Nor had Moy, except for those papers with which, as a solicitor,
he was expected to deal. Moreover, if the room had been searched
after the murder, and the body was discovered, then Moy,
Haliburton and Gilmour could all give each other alibis.</p>

<p>He could make a guess as to where that system was now. Before
the day was over, he knew that his guess was being
strengthened.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER 15</h2>

<p class="first">APPLETON had crossed by the noon boat from
Victoria, and gone on down to Mentone by air. That meant that he
would have arrived last night. Pointer rang up the town police,
and learned that rooms had been engaged for Ingram's brother-in-law
at a comfortable but highly-expensive hotel there. He drove
on out to it, along the beautiful Grand Corniche. The colors of
sea and sky, the turns and twists of the road, are things of real
loveliness. Mentone itself looked the usual arid desert of a
Riviera town in the summer. And indeed, even in the winter its
flowers and verdure are the result of money and art, not nature.
Nature refuses to let even vegetables grow here, nor any fruit
but the olive. In winter, when the mimosa and the heliotropes run
from end to end of the main street, Mentone has its visitors who
love its sunshine and its flowers, but in summer, like
Beausoleil, it is merely a respectable name for Monte Carlo from
which it is separated by but some ten minutes in the tram.</p>

<p>Pointer drew up at the handsome Palace Hotel. There is no
fault to be found with the big hotels of the Riviera, provided
you like that kind of thing. Not Arnold Bennett himself could
have suggested better plumbing or bigger crowds. The chief
inspector loathed them, but then his idea of comfort was an old,
well-kept, quiet English inn, with cooking that can beat that of
any other country in the world when at its simple best.</p>

<p>He arrived too early for even a French lunch, but the matre
d'htel who used to be at Ciro's remembered him, and gave him the
inevitable omelette and poulet en casserole in the big
restaurant. Pointer questioned him about Mr. Appleton. The matre
d'htel smiled. He would not be up for another four hours or so.
"Look at that!" He indicated a table at the other end still
littered with champagne corks. "The result of last night. At
Monte Carlo they draped a table in the roulette room with black.
Oh, yes, he broke the bank twice. Not difficult to do these days,
you think? Still, he did it. Twice. Mr. Tark? Oh, yes, I know Mr.
Tark quite well. Apart from his father&mdash;quite apart. He used
to play incessantly, and with fair luck. He had one of these
systems which do quite well if you do not force them. Losses and
gains about equal. They have not seen him at the rooms for some
time, they tell me, until last night." He went on to say that Mr.
Tark had, in common with about twenty other people, had a sort of
celebration supper with Mr. Appleton last night. They appeared to
be but the merest of acquaintances. Mr. Tark, like the other
guests at the supper, had followed Mr. Appleton's lead with, as a
rule, great success.</p>

<p>Pointer drank his coffee and then took the little tram with
its sensible division of first and second class on up to Monte
Carlo. There are many things claimed for Monte Carlo which it is
not, but it has an outstanding virtue, it is one of the cleanest
towns in existence. When it rains, which it does more often than
the papers will reveal, torrents of clear water rush down its
streets like mountain rivulets, and add a charm of their own to
the steep slopes.</p>

<p>At the Casino, he had a word with the head croupier who
happened to be up, owing to the necessity of a visit to his
dentist. He was a tall thin man with a white puffy face, and the
curiously dead eyes of his profession, eyes which yet miss
nothing.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Appleton had won a great deal last night. He had
played a new system, and it had worked. For that one evening,"
the head croupier added with a faint smile. "There are many
such."</p>

<p>"Mr. Tark?"</p>

<p>"He had mostly followed Mr. Appleton's lead."</p>

<p>"Did they talk together?"</p>

<p>Not as far as the man knew. Both were well known in Monte
Carlo. Mr. Tark lived at Beausoleil, of course, but he was never
far from the tables for long. Mr. Appleton only came to Monte
Carlo for about a fortnight each year. He used to play quite
high, but of late years his stakes, and therefore his losses, had
been slight. Last night he, the head croupier, had noticed only
one oddity. Whenever Mr. Appleton lost, he had staked much
smaller sums than when he won. That might, of course, mean
nothing.</p>

<p>On the whole, Mr. Appleton had won four times out of six. Any
good system would show the same results, provided the player had
a run of luck. Tonight or to-morrow the money won would be sure
to return to the Casino, probably with interest. Yes, the bank
had been broken twice, which, as Pointer knew, only meant that
that particular table had run out of its reserves of money. The
usual farce of draping it in black, and sending for more money,
which was brought in by a guard was gone through. It was a good
advertisement. The head croupier shrugged. And in these days,
<i>parbleu</i>, one needed advertisement.</p>

<p>Pointer put on his war paint that evening, and presented
himself at the glittering palace of pleasure on the rocks which
at night seemed built all of moonbeams and dewdrops and ivory.
Lit up inside as superbly as outside, thronged with gorgeous
flunkeys, it is still a spectacle to be seen, though the days of
incredible toilettes are gone and makeshift evening frocks on
very dowdy looking bodies abounded. There are seven hundred rooms
in the huge building, though quite a quarter of these are secret
little cupboards where, through artfully concealed openings,
members of the <i>brigade de jeu</i>&mdash;the Casino's private
detective force&mdash;can watch all that goes on.</p>

<p>One of these was put at Pointer's disposal. Inside he seemed
to be separated from the roulette tables by a mere white grating.
From the gaming room itself, nothing showed but rich panelled
walls of stucco and plaster wreaths and flowers in very high
relief. It was skilfully done. Pointer watched the garish scene.
Appleton came in rather early. His step was jaunty, his head
thrown back, his shoulders well squared. He had all the effect of
a man with flowing evening-cloak and hat well on the side of his
head. He sat down in a chair with almost a bang, and produced a
note-book with something of a conjuror's flourish. Then he began
to play. Tark was not far behind him, wooden faced, quiet, but as
he looked around him Pointer realized that he was looking at a
man whose only avenue of life was gambling. Only here, in scenes
like this, did Tark really exist. He seemed to belong to the
tables as some men belong to the fields, some to the towns, and
some, Pointer among them, to the open spaces. Watching the two
men, Pointer felt sure that they were not acting together. On the
contrary, he had an idea from something that flitted across
Appleton's face once or twice when he staked and lost, that he
was amused. Tark was not. As a rule Appleton won, and Tark,
following him, won too, but once when Appleton staked the maximum
in the maximum ways, and Tark had followed suit, Appleton at the
last fraction of a second altered his stake. Tark looked black
murder down at the other's well-groomed head. His eyes for once
showed his feelings. That time Appleton smiled openly. A swift
grin of intense amusement. Watching him make his entries and
calculations, Pointer saw that Appleton knew beforehand when he
was going to lose. He had a chart by which he was steering. Tark
knew it too, and all but showed his teeth each time that he,
following, was led astray&mdash;deliberately astray. But
outwardly there was no communication between the two players.</p>

<p>Again the bank was broken. Again the usual ritual followed of
draping the table in crape, of bringing in great boxes of bundles
of notes. The head croupier hovered about, but no one was much
interested except those who were following Appleton. Pointer kept
a careful tally of the man's winnings. In all he put them at
around fifteen hundred pounds when he finally rose and let
another have his seat. Tark stayed for a couple of chances, and
lost, then he too went down to the station. Appleton was already
in a compartment, Pointer bundled himself in, bearded and muffled
and bespectacled. He drew out some Russian papers and seemed to
lose himself in them as he took the farthest corner from
Appleton. At the last second Tark jumped in, stumbled over a pair
of elastic-sided boots thrust out, and apologized curtly. Pointer
shrieked something in Russian, and nursed his toe, spluttering
that he did not understand when Tark tossed him another negligent
apology. Then he buried himself in his newspaper again.</p>

<p>"How much was it?" Tark asked, "we may as well divide up now.
Tolstoi over there doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"Just over fifteen hundred of our money," Appleton replied,
looking as though the words hurt him.</p>

<p>Tark gave a grunt of acquiescence. Evidently he too had made
it that.</p>

<p>"Why did you stop playing?" he asked in a tone as though he
had a right to an answer.</p>

<p>"Better so," was the reply. "Arouses less comment. Less risk
of articles in the papers. Well, here's your half." And may it
choke you was suggested by his voice as he handed over a thick
wad of notes which Tark went through carefully, before stowing
them away in an inner pocket with the briefest of
acknowledgments.</p>

<p>"You led me up the garden now and again," he grumbled as he
did so.</p>

<p>"I told you I would!" was the retort, and Appleton took up a
paper and seemed to forget his companion.</p>

<p>The next evening Appleton did not play quite so long. But he
again won over a thousand pounds. The fourth evening he won over
two thousand, and this time the head croupier had himself taken
the table after Appleton began to play. The man's eyes never left
Appleton or Tark. Suddenly Pointer caught sight of Mrs. Appleton
in the thick crowd around the table. He knew that she had left
for Paris. That there she had taken a ticket to Mentone. Pointer,
therefore, expected to see her here tonight. She stood, a pale
tired-looking woman where she could watch her husband's play, and
not even the head croupier followed it more intently. Pointer had
arranged with a member of the <i>brigade de jeu</i> to take his
place if need be, and now he slipped out and drove back to
Appleton's hotel in Mentone. He himself was staying at Monte
Carlo. He wanted a certain corner in Appleton's little suite, one
of the usual hotel arrangements, where a sofa was backed across
the angle of two walls by a four-fold screen. For he had promptly
inspected the rooms with the aid of a card from the Monte Carlo
head detective, since showing which, he was allowed to do what he
liked in Appleton's rooms. Just now, this was to insinuate a
chair into one of the two bays made by the screen, draw it around
him again, and wait. He might have an all night's vigil, but he
thought not. There was that in Mrs. Appleton's face which would
need privacy, he thought, to be spoken. What happened at the
Casino after he left, he learned later. Mrs. Appleton got near
enough to her husband to touch him on the shoulder. He looked up,
and smiled a pale sort of greeting&mdash;very forced, very
surprised apparently at sight of her. She only stared down at him
with unsmiling eyes.</p>

<p>She bent forward as though to say something and Appleton rose
at once. "Not here! Come with me to my hotel. I'll take the tram
since you're always frightened of taxis abroad." He got up and
lead the way out, those around smiling at what they fancied was
the meek husband detected by his puritanical wife. "She'll be all
right when she hears that he has won!" one man said cynically as
he slipped into the vacated chair.</p>

<p>Tark, as Appleton afterwards learned, took a taxi to the
Appleton's hotel, asked for him, was told that he was at Monte
Carlo, showed a card of Appleton's on which was scribbled in what
certainly looked like Appleton's writing, "Permit the bearer to
wait for me in my room," showed it to the floor waiter, and had
the suite unlocked for him at once.</p>

<p>Tark gave but a glance around the apartment. Pointer knew what
was coming. Straight towards his screen refuge came Tark.
Fortunately Pointer had taken the farther bay, just on some such
off-chance as this. Tark drew out the sofa, slipped into hiding,
and was just moving back the end of the screen against the wall
on his side when the creak of the lift and steps sounded outside.
He left the sofa's end where it was.</p>

<p>But the two people who entered together had no eye for the
position of the furniture. Had the men hidden in the corner stood
out in the middle of the room, they might have escaped
notice.</p>

<p>Appleton shut the door behind himself and his wife and then
turned to her quickly.</p>

<p>"Sit down and let me explain things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" She shrank away from him against a table. "I don't
want a confession. I only came on here with you to tell you that
if you play again I shall go straight to the chief inspector. He
knows, I feel sure, that I searched Charles' writing-room at The
Tall House. And I think he guesses that I was trying to make sure
whether you had left any of your cigarette ends or ash about. Oh,
Edward, that you, you should have done such a thing." Anguish was
in face and voice. "No, don't try to lie to me. You were never a
good liar. And I know that what I'm saying is the truth. God help
us all. God help Jackie and Bill."</p>

<p>"You're wrong&mdash;-" he burst out imperiously, but she only
shook a shuddering head and would not let him finish.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't pretend to me! I've known it, feared it, from the
first. I who knew how wild you were to get his system. Remember,
I heard you, and that dreadful man Tark, talking about it once.
Oh, yes, I know that you told him that Charles might let a
stranger try it out, where he wouldn't you, just because he knew
what a dangerous gift it would be."</p>

<p>"Tark may have shot Charles," Appleton said, very white and
set of face, "but I didn't, Ada. I know he got himself asked to
The Tall House on purpose to get to know Charles better."</p>

<p>"He tipped Mr. Haliburton overboard probably for that reason,"
she threw in scornfully, "but it's you, not he, who is playing a
system. You've got the paper, not he. Now listen, as I said, I
don't want a confession from you, but I swear that you shan't
profit by my brother's murder. If you play again, I shall give
you in charge. I'll tell Chief Inspector Pointer the whole truth.
How you badgered Charles for years since he let drop that
unfortunate remark that he had devised a system that really was
infallible. How he always refused to let you or anyone try it
out, because he knew where it would lead. Or no, he didn't. He
never thought that it would lead to his own death. Oh, Edward, to
what depths have you sunk! To what depths!"</p>

<p>Appleton had had perforce to let her rave on. Something in her
face said that to silence her you would have had to gag her.
These words were too dammed up to stay behind locked lips any
longer. But for the moment she was spent. She leaned against the
table behind her, her hands now over her face.</p>

<p>"I see I must go into something I'd rather not speak of. No,
you shall listen!" He towered over her. "You <i>shall</i> hear me
out. I went to Charles that last night because&mdash;" his face
twitched&mdash;"because we're ruined, Ada. Ruined. I've let my
brokers keep my securities for me, as you know. They're bonds.
Well, Graves pledged them with others to his bank to secure an
advance to himself. He's gone smash."</p>

<p>Pointer knew of the big crash of Farral and Graves about a
fortnight ago. Graves had shot himself, and many a man and woman
wished that he had done it sooner.</p>

<p>"He's gone smash," Appleton repeated, "and now the bank, his
bank, won't part with my bonds. My solicitors tell me that I
can't force them to do so. Yet they talk of our Justice and our
Law! We haven't a penny except the three hundred in the bank that
I always keep for emergencies, and your two hundred which you
have there for the same reason. Got that clear?"</p>

<p>"I don't care for your reasons&mdash;I don't want to hear
them." She almost moaned the words. "I don't want to know the
steps which led you down to Hell. But you did go down them. And
you shall never touch the children or me again. Never. Nor shall
you profit by your crime. Keep if you want to&mdash;" her lip
curled&mdash;"the blood money you've won up to now. But enter a
gaming place again, and let me hear of it, and you'll hang!"</p>

<p>"Will you listen!" roared Appleton, and by sheer volume of
sound silenced her. "I was told, perhaps worry aggravated it,
that I've got to have a major operation, yes, that old tumor
again, within six months. The fees will run into a thousand
pounds with Sir Rankin Rowbottom as surgeon, and he's the only
man who can do it and give me a chance of surviving. Well, I
caught Charles just as he was on his way back to The Tall House.
Earlier in the evening he had told me that he wouldn't have a
moment's time until midnight. There was something he had to
finish and get off by twelve, to catch the midnight post. Well, I
walked about, wondering how best to put it to him, wondering what
would happen to you and the kids if he wouldn't let me have a try
at that system. You see, no loan would help. It would have to be
that system of his, or we were all beggars for the rest of our
lives, though in my case the rest would only be a couple of
years, but they would be years of increasing agony. I went home
once, thinking I would try again next morning. But I didn't come
in. I turned around with my key in the door and went back."</p>

<p>"I heard you," she said in a whisper. "I heard your
step&mdash;your key&mdash;and your going away again."</p>

<p>"I caught a bus and by chance spied Charles just turning a
corner close to that furnished house. I joined him, and we went
back into the library there and had a long talk. I told him
everything. I didn't want a loan. I wanted that system. In the
end he handed it to me. I swear by God, I swear by Jacky and
Bill, and my love for you, Ada, that I'm telling you the exact
truth. He saw what an awful place we were all in. He got up,
unlocked a despatch box beside' him, took out an envelope from
the bottom, and handed it me. 'There you are. You've
won&mdash;and you'll go on winning,' were his exact words. Then
he added, 'I didn't think I could reconcile it with my conscience
to hand that to any man, let alone to Ada's husband, but I give
it you on one condition.' He made me give him my word of honor
that if a casino offered to buy me off&mdash;as he said they
certainly would&mdash;I would accept their offer, provided it was
a reasonable one. He thought that Monte Carlo would offer me an
annuity of two thousand a year for it. And the other big places
even more. I had to promise that, and I did so gladly. Well, I
went home as happy as a boy. I know what you felt about
gambling-money, so I decided&mdash;Charles and I had decided
that together&mdash;to say nothing about it...Then came the news of
his dreadful end. I saw that you didn't think it an accident. I
saw that you suspected me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For the last month, Edward, you've talked in your sleep of
getting that system. Over and over you would mutter that 'I must
have it. He must give it me. It'll save us. I've a right to
it..." She panted the words rather than spoke them.</p>

<p>"I didn't kill Charles, but I was&mdash;afraid&mdash;of
you&mdash;of the police&mdash;of the whole position. Then Tark
accused me of murdering him for that paper. He offered to keep
silence for a half share in all profits. It's my belief that if
anyone murdered Charles, if it wasn't an accident, then it was
Tark, before he knew that Charles had already given the system
away. He guessed to whom then, because we had talked it over
together. Oh, I knew Tark by sight as well as he knew me. You
can't live at the Casino rooms as both of us did, without knowing
one another perfectly by sight. But it was from Fred that he
learned about the system. So he says."</p>

<p>"But you were the two who plotted to get hold of it," she said
fiercely, accusingly.</p>

<p>"We talked of how to get it&mdash;of course we did. Once we
knew of its existence. And as you know I thought he might give me
a chance...Charles was so afraid I would turn into a desperate
gambler...I didn't think he'd care so much whether Tark did or
not. The chap only lives for gambling anyway...When he saw his
chance of pretending to me that he thought I had shot Charles, I
gave in...there was nothing else for it...And now, I swear again,
Ada, that I've told you the exact truth. Look at me, look into my
face, my darling. Surely you can read the truth there."</p>

<p>She fixed a haggard, intent stare on him, she half stretched
out one hand, the other now tight pressed against her heart.</p>

<p>"Oh Edward, if only I could! I might, if you'll
destroy&mdash;at once&mdash;that awful paper&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tark came out from behind his end of the screen. Mrs. Appleton
gave a little cry. Appleton seemed too amazed even to gasp.</p>

<p>"Didn't know I was here, did you?" Tark said in his harsh,
level voice. "Mrs. Appleton, I can't stand silent and see such a
lie pass. Your intuition or suspicion was right. He shot your
brother. I happened to see him at The Tall House, but until
afterwards I didn't reflect just what it was he was at. No,
Appleton, it's no use. I won't stand for it. You know that you
shot Ingram, and unless you hand me his system&mdash;the right
one, mind you&mdash;not the one we spoofed off Fred with, I shall
go myself to the police. If you think it's worth while swinging
for, keep it!" And Tark seated himself on the arm of a chair.</p>

<p>"How dare you repeat your lying accusation to me in front of
my wife!" Appleton looked the outraged husband to the life.</p>

<p>Tark gave one of his short hard cackles. "Mrs. Appleton will
be called as a witness against you, unless you're careful. I
agree with her that it's a foul thing to kill her brother and use
that money. Hand it over to me. I wanted to buy it from Ingram,
as you know, not to murder him for it. You said that you thought
you could get it without paying for it, if I'd put up five
hundred to try it out with. Well, I got the money, and you got
the system." His last words were full of meaning. "And now, hand
me over that paper," he went on, his words suddenly cold and
steel hard.</p>

<p>"Don't let him have it!" came from Mrs. Appleton. Her eyes
were alight. She was quite undaunted now. "Never mind what
happens. Burn it!"</p>

<p>"I haven't got it with me, Ada." He ignored Tark. Something in
his face and eye suggested that there was no Tark, that it only
lay between himself and his wife. His hand went to an inner
pocket...</p>

<p>"You've got the copy," came Tark's hard voice. "I want that
copy. Hand it over! Dare to go near those matches&mdash;" His
body seemed to thicken, he was ready for a spring when Pointer
stepped out from the remaining pocket of the screen. It was
purest vaudeville, but no one in the room smiled. Pointer counted
roughly on the surprise of his sudden appearance giving him just
time to snatch a paper from Appleton's fingers. The man, with an
ashen face, made a clutch at his hand.</p>

<p>"How dare you! You have no right whatever to be here...to take
that. It's mine. Return it at once, or..." He choked.</p>

<p>"Or what?" Pointer asked coldly.</p>

<p>"Keep it!" Mrs. Appleton said suddenly, and her face looked
younger and, in some deep way happier, than Pointer had yet seen
it. "Keep it, chief inspector. My husband told us the truth as to
how he got it. It is honestly his. Keep it for the time being. I
lend it you&mdash;he lends it you on condition that you clear up
my brother's murder, if it was one!"</p>

<p>"Bring it home to your husband!" sneered Tark. His eyes showed
a curious red. Rather strange eyes had Tark. He looked a man most
eminently capable of murder as he stood there, his thin small
lips stretched away from his teeth in a sort of snarl.</p>

<p>Pointer turned to Mrs. Appleton. Her eyes, resolute and
unwavering, met his. The two talked without words in a long look.
He saw that she really did believe in her husband, that she was
sure at last of his innocence, and that she was willing for him
to run the terrible danger of being accused of her brother's
murder, if need be.</p>

<p>But Appleton looked shrunken and withered. She crossed to him,
and stood shoulder to shoulder beside him.</p>

<p>"Just what did you mean, Mr. Tark, when you said that you
didn't know what he was at, when you saw him at The Tall House
the night on which Mr. Ingram was shot?" Pointer asked. He
dominated the room, as he usually did any room where he was. Tark
shot him one glance from his calculating eyes that had now grown
cold again, and answered promptly.</p>

<p>"I saw him in Gilmour's room when I went to my
own&mdash;around one o'clock at night&mdash;doing something to
the drawer by the door, just putting something back into it to be
precise. Putting back the case that held the automatic with which
Ingram was shot a couple of hours later."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" burst from Appleton in tones of indignant horror
and outraged truth. But the trouble was that, being a good actor,
Appleton could assume that look and tone at will. Mrs. Appleton
turned her head, gave her husband one look, and then turned away,
her own face serene and tranquil.</p>

<p>"Is it? I think not!" came Tark's reply. If a liar, Tark was
quite as good an actor as Appleton had ever been. "It's true. And
you know it. And your wife knows it. Well, you've failed to pull
it off. And now, I think I'll go home."</p>

<p>"What about being arrested as an accessory, Mr. Tark?" was
Pointer's inquiry. "If you conceal information in a murder
case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In a murder case&mdash;yes. But this was not openly that,"
was the retort. "The coroner's jury brought it in as Death by
Misadventure. How was I to guess the truth that Appleton was the
real murderer?"</p>

<p>"Why else did I go halves with you but because you blackmailed
me into doing it?" Appleton asked indignantly. "I agreed, because
I needed the money and at once, and must at all costs avoid
trouble. But make no mistake. Don't think that if I go to prison
I won't take you with me, and if it comes to the rope&mdash;then
to the drop with me." He spoke resolutely. Tark only lit a
cigarette.</p>

<p>"Empty words! You murdered your brother-in-law, not I. I
believed your account of the handing over by him to you of the
system, and only offered to find the money with which to try it
out. Naturally that being the case, I asked for half shares. I
hoped, as I say, that Ingram would have sold it to me, but he was
evidently not in need of money. You took a simpler and swifter
way of getting what you wanted."</p>

<p>"Why were you hiding in this room?" came from Appleton.</p>

<p>"Because I rather thought your wife might want you to give up
the system. That she knew the truth. In which case, I wanted
it."</p>

<p>Pointer interposed. "And now, Mrs. Appleton, and you two
gentlemen, I would like you to return to England."</p>

<p>Tark stiffened.</p>

<p>"You see," the chief inspector went on, "I particularly want
to avoid any scandal, any calling in of the French police, and
that can only be, if you all three voluntarily return to England,
and stay there till things are clearer."</p>

<p>Tark looked for an instant as though he would demur but he
thought better of it and when asked for his prospective address
gave his former hotel. The Appletons would return to Markham
Square, they said, and there place themselves unreservedly at the
service of the chief inspector. One of Pointer's men in plain
clothes would accompany them. Inspector Watts was staying at a
quiet hotel ready for just such a duty. That done, the oddly
assembled little group broke up.</p>

<p>Pointer waited until Appleton came back after seeing his wife
off to her hotel. He had a long wait, but he counted rightly on
the fact that Mrs. Appleton was too worn out to be capable of any
further long conversations without a rest. At length her husband,
looking some ten years older, returned alone and entered his
sitting-room heavily, a night waiter carrying a tray following
him. Pointer expected a protest at his own presence but on the
contrary Appleton looked relieved. He offered the other a whisky
and soda, which was refused, and helped himself, drinking as a
man does who needs the stimulant.</p>

<p>"There's something been burning me all the time, chief
inspector," Appleton began as he set the glass down. "About my
brother-in-law. I tried to give you a hint that I thought his
death wasn't accidental, but I was reluctant to mention his
system. I was afraid that at the best I should get no chance of
playing it, if I did, and at the worst, well, that what my wife
thought would be your first idea. And one hears so often that
what a detective thinks first he thinks all the time,
that&mdash;" Appleton shrugged his shoulders and poured another
drink. "There is something that I knew all along I ought to tell
you&mdash;it's this. Ingram had had a fearful shock. He wasn't
himself in the least. Which was one of the reasons why he let me
have that system so easily. He was very pale and...I can't give
you particulars, but his whole appearance, as well as manner,
suggested a man who was fairly reeling under some blow.</p>

<p>"Now that had not been the case when I looked in and wanted a
word with him before midnight. Nor was it the case when I met him
on his way back from the post. Both times he was exactly himself,
in looks and in manner. When we entered he didn't take me into
the library, but into a little room by the door, a room which
Tark and I used to signal to each other from, by the
way&mdash;oh, just an arrangement of a signal each was to make to
the other through the window should either of us have got the
system&mdash;but to go back to Charles...He left me there for a
moment, saying that he had a few papers he must see to before our
talk, said he wouldn't keep me more than a minute...It was quite
ten minutes before he came in and when he did, as I say, he was a
changed man. However he led me into the library, though I think
he had to force himself to take any interest in what I wanted to
say, didn't ask me to have a drink, or a smoke, just stood by the
fire staring at me from a white and rather ghastly face. But I
couldn't afford to put off what I had to say...well, the rest
I've told you...but even when we parted he looked just the
same&mdash;a man who had had an awful blow, I thought."</p>

<p>"You don't think so now?" Pointer asked, in answer to his
tone, rather than his words.</p>

<p>"Oh, I do still. But I'm afraid now that his shock was
connected with what happened so soon afterwards. Whether he had
caught sight of his murderer...and knew he was in
danger...whether he had received the traditional warning dear to
old-fashioned novelists...something of that sort was the cause of
his appearance and absolute inability to really care for what I
was telling him..."</p>

<p>"Had anything been burned in the hearth?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, papers. They were still smoking, but Charles said that
he had burned the draft of the papers he had just posted, and he
was a man who never told a lie."</p>

<p>"Do you mind telling me how he came to say that to you? Did
you ask him what the papers were?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not." Appleton looked surprised at the
question.</p>

<p>"Then did he go out of his way to tell you what they were?"
Pointer persisted, and Appleton now saw the reason for the
question.</p>

<p>"Now you ask me, he did. And now you've made me think of it,
that wasn't at all his way. Excusing himself, explaining
himself."</p>

<p>"I suppose you couldn't see what the papers had been? I
consider this may be an important point, Mr. Appleton. You might
have watched them smoking quite idly and without noticing them
consciously, and yet, on reflection, you might be able to tell me
now if they were letters, or printed papers, or bills...</p>

<p>"The topmost paper looked like a letter. It was a sheet of the
letter paper from the house that he himself used."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Tark use it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Frederick Ingram?"</p>

<p>Appleton nodded. "Yes, it was the house paper, with the headed
address and telephone number and so on on it. Everyone stopping
in the house would use it, I fancy."</p>

<p>"You couldn't see anything of the handwriting? Or whether it
was in consecutive lines and so on?"</p>

<p>Appleton thought a moment and shook his head. "It was curled
over, blank side up...underneath were other papers, quite a
stack, I fancy, but of manuscript. All torn up small. The top
sheet, evidently his covering letter draft, was a whole
sheet."</p>

<p>"Could you see whether there was any margin or not to the
writing?" Pointer persisted. "Even when turned blank side up, if
still burning, you might have noticed that, the very fire might
cause the writing to show as writing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There was no margin," Appleton said slowly. "No, I recall
that now."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ingram left a wide margin on the letters I've seen of
his."</p>

<p>"Always. Yes, that's odd. I've never known him to write from
edge to edge as was done on that sheet. Yet it was a letter...I
mean there was the usual short first line and the usual two very
short last lines, one of conventional closing, and one a
signature...Appleton was trying to picture again what he had seen
without interest so short a time ago.</p>

<p>"Two lines, not three?" Pointer asked. "For a very formal, or
a business note, would be likely to have three, including the
signature."</p>

<p>"By Jove, now you've made me think back so closely, I don't
believe it was Ingram's writing at all," Appleton said without
replying to the question just put. "No, it was all over the
page...and the signature was very short...Charles always had a
long signature. His middle name was Augustus and he used it in
signing, so that Charles Augustus Ingram made quite a little
strip of letters on a page. Yet he told me he was burning the
draft of what he had just sent off..."</p>

<p>More than this he had not seen, or could not recall. Again
Pointer took him over each little item. Appleton changed nothing,
and added nothing, except his growing conviction that the letter
flung last of all on the torn-up scraps of white manuscript paper
must have been a warning of his coming death.</p>

<p>Before returning to his own room Pointer went for a long walk.
He wanted to think. First of all, there was the question as to
whether Tark or Appleton could be the solution to The Tall House
puzzle. Either or both might be, and yet...if so, it was a much
simpler affair than he had fancied it...Putting aside all that
had just been told him, for it was told him by a very suspect
man, a man who might easily be the criminal himself, there was
still the posting of that letter or package of manuscript...the
last fitted in with the idea of ciphers...No one had so far
acknowledged the receipt of a communication of any kind from the
dead man, though the coroner had asked the public to do so. If
Appleton's account was to be trusted, the way his brother-in-law
had spoken beforehand about wanting to catch the midnight post
suggested a man doing an accustomed thing...knowing just what
post would be in time...Here fitted possibly the quarterly
payments of a thousand pounds, a very large sum for a man to have
without any note as to the services paid so liberally.</p>

<p>Judging by his well-known mode of life those services must
have been written ones. Again came the notion of cipher reading
or compilation. But Pointer could not see why, if so, the police
had not been confidentially informed of the fact...some foreign
power? Some distant business house? But if Ingram was earning
four thousand a year, his services must be important; his death,
published in the papers, must have been wirelessed or cabled,
whether in one of his own codes or not to his employer...yet
nothing had been heard in reply...</p>

<p>Well, much would depend on that search for a missing
man&mdash;or a missing woman&mdash;whose disappearance the chief
inspector thought might still be the shortest cut to clear up
Ingram's murder, supposing it to have been a murder. As to the
system being the motive, that was quite possible. In fact, but
for the posting of something of which the registration slip was
missing, Pointer would be quite willing to accept it as the
motive. Appleton assured him that only four people besides its
author knew of the existence of Ingram's system: himself, his
wife, Fred Ingram and Tark. Appleton was quite sure of this. He
himself had imparted the information to the last-named, and
Ingram had told them, when speaking of it, that only they to whom
he was talking knew of such a paper. Yes, the system did provide
an adequate motive...Appleton's account of the change in Ingram
on his return might be connected with that mysterious person of
the post-office robbery...Appleton had joined Ingram some time
after he had left the neighborhood of the attempt and of the
escape, but Pointer thought there was a simpler explanation of
Ingram's state of mind as described by his brother-in-law. He was
going to test this explanation as soon as possible and in doing
so a part at least of Appleton's account.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER 16</h2>

<p class="first">MOY found the silence on Gilmour's part very
hard to bear as one day followed another. He was not what is
known as psychic at all, and yet he had a growing feeling that
something was wrong.</p>

<p>Three days after Gilmour had left the letter with him, he rang
up Miss Longstaff and asked her if he might drop in for a chat.
She sounded quite willing. He found her sitting in a little
basement room lit by what purported to be dungeon lanterns, a
suitable choice he thought.</p>

<p>She was looking tired and dispirited, but the stare that she
bent on him was as inscrutable as ever. She brightened up,
however, after a moment.</p>

<p>"You've never been here before, have you?" she asked, waving a
hand around. "Can you imagine a more naive attempt at deceit.
That bookcase is supposed to be absolutely undetectable. Could
anyone suppose it to be anything, but what it is, a bed on end?
The manageress assured me that the wash-stand looks just like an
antique bureau. It doesn't. It looks just like a wash-stand, from
where it was bought&mdash;Tottenham Court Road. And do sit down
on this Early English dower-chest, as she calls it, which screams
aloud that it's a dwarf wardrobe. Now tell me why you've
conquered your aversion to me, and actually paid me a visit?" She
looked very wicked as she said the last words, and Moy fidgeted
on his hard seat.</p>

<p>"You're joking," he murmured. She had a hard stare and a hard
jaw but she was a young and handsome girl none the less.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said impulsively, "I dropped in to ask you if
you haven't heard from Gilmour&mdash;" A shade passed over her
mobile face.</p>

<p>"That's an egg that didn't hatch out at all as I hoped," she
said with apparent frankness, lighting a cigarette. "Gilmour...I
feel I've been rather a pig to him, but what's done's done. I
hate turning back. It's always a mistake."</p>

<p>"Not in your case," he said urgently. "You see, I know how
deeply attached to you he is&mdash;how much he felt your
attitude. No other girl had a look in with him." He paused and
repeated this last sentence.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps," she said rather oracularly. "I mean perhaps I
have been all wrong about him..." She fell into a reverie. Then
she looked up.</p>

<p>"If he can find out who did do it, that's what he's gone for,
isn't it? Well, I might go back to things as they once were. If
innocent, he's had a rotten time. I wish you could tell him that.
Can't you really get a message through to him?"</p>

<p>Moy told her that he could not. "Something you said gave him a
clue, or rather set him off remembering something connected with
it," he said, "and where he was, and when he's coming back, I
haven't the wildest notion." Suddenly catching her eye, her
intensity, he began to talk of something else, and asked her how
she liked the house she was in.</p>

<p>She shrugged. "Beggars mustn't be choosers. I had hoped to be
able to afford something better than this, but&mdash;well, my
finances won't admit of it." She did not say that the post on the
paper which she had secured was turning out to be a very weak
reed on which to lean, if indeed she was allowed to keep it, for
she had had a hint that a good many changes were being
contemplated, and guessed that they would include her name even
though, or rather because, her appointment seemed to be purely
honorary&mdash;like her salary.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear Mr. Gilmour or Mr. Ingram speak of a Mrs.
Findlay?" she asked abruptly. Moy said that he never had. She sat
very quiet at that, almost lost in the deep wicker chair which
even the manageress could not say looked like anything but what
it was.</p>

<p>"I hadn't meant to speak of it," she said slowly, and as
though not quite sure yet if she wished to let it slip, "but I
wondered once, and now I'm wondering again, if Mr. Gilmour's
disappearance has anything to do with her."</p>

<p>"Who's she?" Moy asked promptly, all interest.</p>

<p>"This is confidential!" she said and waited for his
"Certainly" before continuing. "I was with Mr. Gilmour one
afternoon, we were going by tube, and stepped into the lift. Or
rather were just going to, when he stepped back with a sort of
jump. Now, I happened to be looking at him just then, and I could
swear that he stepped out from the lift so quickly because he had
caught sight of a rather odd-looking woman standing inside. Close
to where we should have had to stand. She was a big woman, rather
stout, with a floating black veil flung over the crown of her hat
and hanging down behind. It was fastened on in front with a
silver star." Miss Longstaff was speaking slowly, and Moy felt
that she was watching him very closely. So much did he feel this
that he wondered if she were telling him the truth, or merely
testing out some tale on him to see whether it passed for
true.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said as she paused. He decided to make no comment.
She looked disappointed, he fancied, and his distrust of her was
not lessened by the notion.</p>

<p>"You've never met such a person?" she inquired curiously.
"Never seen anyone who answers to that description?"</p>

<p>"I've never met a flowing black veil and a silver star," he
assured her, "that's all you've described to me, except big and
stout. What was the woman like besides?"</p>

<p>"Oh," Miss Longstaff looked almost contemptuous, "can't you
see her from what I've said? No? Well, she had an earnest face,
wore spectacles, and at the present moment has a fearful sore
throat that makes her whisper."</p>

<p>"You know her then?" Moy was getting interested. Also
puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yes and no. She lives or lived here in this house. But she's
gone. And went without letting me know about it. But I'll go
back, and as it's quite confidential I'm going to be very frank.
You'll be horrified but I shall bear up." Again that wicked snap
came into her dark eyes. "Well, I asked Mr. Gilmour why on earth
he let the lift go up without us, and he asked me if I had seen
two stout men standing by the liftman. One couldn't help seeing
them&mdash;like the woman with the floating veil. I said that I
had, and he told me that he wanted very much to dodge them. They
were a couple of men who were collecting for some fund or other,
and had badgered the life out of him so much a week ago that he
had been weak enough to give them a half promise of a
subscription. He regretted it the moment after, and wanted
particularly to avoid them for a while. So he waited for the next
lift and that was that."</p>

<p>"Well?" Moy asked again as she sat back. "What then?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't believe him, Mr. Moy. As it happened, both
those men had been sitting in the same car on the underground
with us, and he hadn't turned a hair. No, I knew then&mdash;as I
know now&mdash;that it was the woman with the veil who kept him
from entering the lift."</p>

<p>It was Moy who stared hard at Miss Longstaff this time. Was
this true? Any, or all, of it? He waited.</p>

<p>"And just lately, since I've begun to rather waver in my ideas
as to his accident with the revolver, I've wondered..."</p>

<p>"Wondered what?" Moy asked.</p>

<p>"Whether he hadn't an enemy after all. Which means someone who
wanted to harm him. You know, Mr. Moy, I didn't believe his story
at first&mdash;about shooting Mr. Ingram by sheer accident, but
something in the way he spoke when he left me&mdash;when he
disappeared&mdash;rather made me waver. And I've been thinking
hard ever since, and bit by bit I've wondered whether there
around that woman&mdash;might lie the clue to his disappearing so
suddenly&mdash;she's left here too," she finished.</p>

<p>"How do you know her name, and that she lives here?" Moy
asked.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gilmour met a friend, and I slipped away as soon as the
lift got to the top, and looked around for the floating veil.
Fortunately it was waiting for a bus just close to the tube
entrance. So I waited too. And got out where she did. And came
here after her, and took a room here and made her acquaintance.
And all to no result!" She opened dramatic hands at the last
sentence to show the palms empty. "She says she never heard of
Gilmour, refused to recognize his description when I gave it to
her. She swears that her life is entirely wrapped up in
disarmament propaganda."</p>

<p>"Well?" Moy asked again, as she seemed to have quite finished.
She hunched a shoulder. "It's not true, Mr. Moy. I saw Lawrence
Gilmour's eyes fall on her and I saw the look of real uneasiness
come instantly into his face and the look of relief when we
stepped back and the lift shot away. She wasn't looking in our
direction, but trying to get her purse back into her handbag. Now
that's what's bothering me...I had to speak of it. At first, I
thought it was connected with something underhand on his part.
Something with which the death of Mr. Ingram was linked&mdash;if
only I could find the link. But just lately&mdash;well, I'm
feeling a little uneasy."</p>

<p>"Where's she now?" Moy asked, jumping up. "I'll have a word
with her if you like."</p>

<p>"No one knows&mdash;or at least no one will tell me where
she's gone to," Alfreda said to that. "I found it quite
impossible to become friends with her in the short time I've been
here. She was oddly distrustful of any overtures."</p>

<p>Not oddly, wisely, Moy thought, considering the motives which
had actuated at least one maker of friendly advances. But he did
not think Miss Longstaff had much sense of humor except a
sardonic one.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I tried to hurry too much. Anyway she rather markedly
held me at a distance. And then, one morning, I found her room
door standing wide open and was told that she had gone. As a
matter of fact I had borrowed a book just the day before, because
I saw she was packing, and I wanted her to give me her address.
But either she forgot about the book, or, as I now think, she
wanted me to think she would let me know where to send it on, in
order to get clear the easier. They tell me that she's been seen
passing the house, so I have taken to haunting the streets lately
because of a certainty that she knows more than she acknowledged
of Gilmour, and therefore may know where he is now."</p>

<p>Moy asked if Mrs. Findlay had any other friends in the house.
Miss Longstaff said that, as one would expect with a very
dour-looking, plain, middle-aged body, she had no other friends
whatever. "The manageress says she has no idea where Mrs. Findlay
is. I suppose she's speaking the truth..." Miss Longstaff again
showed that rather worn, dispirited look which she had worn when
Moy came in. "But somehow lately I'm worried about Lawrence
Gilmour. Uneasy. Almost apprehensive. He's cut himself completely
off from all help. Anything might happen..." Moy saw what really
looked like genuine concern in those bright dark eyes, and
answering it, in return for what, finally, he believed was a true
account which might help towards clearing away the shadows around
Gilmour, he told her of the envelope left with him should an
S.O.S. come. He did not tell her how the summons might come. She
seemed very interested.</p>

<p>"He knew he might be going into danger," she murmured. "Oh,
more and more I feel that I've wronged him."</p>

<p>"You changed the sheets, didn't you?" Moy said suddenly.</p>

<p>She looked at him with large eyes. "No," she said simply. "No.
I drew out the sheet from under Mr. Ingram on which he was
half-wrapped and half-lying. It struck me that the hole wasn't as
far away from the edge as it ought to be, if the end had covered all
of Mr. Ingram's face, and I pulled it out to have a better
look...but I didn't change the sheet." Moy did not believe her,
and his disbelief of this part of the talk swept over all that
had gone before. He doubted everything that he had just heard,
her change of mind, her tale about her first sight of the lady
with the star. He rose and they parted on rather a forced note of
concern for Gilmour. He wanted to think over what he had just
heard, but an acquaintance buttonholed him and accompanied him
nearly to his door, and Moy had to rush to be in his flat in time
for Mrs. Pratt and her daughter, whom he had asked to have a look
at his rooms now that they were finished. It would be a sort of
leave-taking too, as they were going off on Haliburton's yacht so
shortly.</p>

<p>It struck him, as he hurriedly put some flowers into water,
that the steps outside sounded very heavy for two ladies.</p>

<p>The mystery was explained by the entrance of Miss Pratt,
accompanied by Haliburton. The young man did not stop.</p>

<p>"He's coming back for me," Winnie explained. "My mother was
detained by that dreadful chief inspector."</p>

<p>"Oh?" Moy was startled. "Detained" had a professional sound.
Unconscious of it, Winnie bent over some canapes, and selected
one with a sort of mosaic of egg and ham on it.</p>

<p>"I much prefer tea to cocktails, it's ever so much better for
the complexion. Yes, my mother won't be able to get here after
all. That dreadful man asked for a word with her, and I left them
both looking very glum and busy. Fred Ingram is back," she
rambled on. "I thought he was going to be away for weeks and
weeks, but he says he tried a new system at roulette and got
cleaned out. I'm glad he's back. He's so sympathetic...such a
help to me these dreadful days. So is Basil. They're both such
dears. Basil, of course, is simply wonderful. I do begin to
realize that. But I can't forget poor Lawrence Gilmour...he might
be dead for all we hear of him or from him."</p>

<p>At her words a little chill seemed to come into the room. She
leaned forward. "Why did you let him do it, Mr. Moy, vanish like
that?"</p>

<p>"How do you know he has vanished?" he countered swiftly.</p>

<p>"Miss Longstaff is beginning to worry too," she went on,
without answering his question. "She's rung me up several times
lately. I feel I haven't done her justice. I thought her so
frightfully hard, but, of course, if she doesn't love Mr.
Gilmour, perhaps there was a certain honesty in saying so at
once...I begin to think that she didn't care for him ever...and
would have broken with him anyway. But speaking about him, Mr.
Moy, didn't he leave any message, any address?" She was quite a
charming sight in the plainly-furnished room, like a spray of
lovely flowers all soft colors and grace; Moy's heart warmed to
her. She was leaning towards him so that he could see the texture
of her smooth pink and white skin, the sheen on the curls over
her ears. "I believe there's someone who's his enemy," she
breathed, "and who wants to harm him. Who hoped to have him
arrested for murder, and still wants to harm him. He shouldn't
have gone all alone, where no one can help him. He may be in some
most frightful danger."</p>

<p>Moy could not refrain from a little comfort.</p>

<p>"He left an envelope with me that I'm to send on to the Yard
should things go really wrong," he blurted out.</p>

<p>"How will you know if they are wrong!" she asked almost
accusingly. Moy could only assure her that he would know, and
explained.</p>

<p>"But you ought to have that precious envelope always with you!
Think how awful it would be if he were to need your help and you
had to waste time sending for it."</p>

<p>He assured her that no time would be lost.</p>

<p>Haliburton and Fred Ingram and Tark all came in together at
that. Haliburton said he was sorry to bring the regiment, but
they had all happened to meet and decided to go on together to
one of the non-stop variety shows which had a really remarkable
dancing turn of which all the town was talking.</p>

<p>Tark seemed as close-mouthed as ever, except that he shot Fred
Ingram one swift look from expressionless eyes as he murmured
that he had been home for a little visit which had done him a
world of good.</p>

<p>He added something about being off shortly for Diamantino. Moy
had no idea where that was, but it sounded as though it would
suit Tark. Frederick and he seemed to eye each other so closely
that Moy wondered whether each had come because the other was
there.</p>

<p>Haliburton asked Moy whether he had any news of Gilmour, and
Winnie, turning to the three visitors, passed on the information
just given her before Moy could stop her. He had not bargained on
that.</p>

<p>"He believes now that it was murder, and he's gone after
whoever did it. All by himself. Isn't it splendid, Basil?"</p>

<p>For the first time since Ingram's death Moy thought she
sounded insincere. Was it possible that Gilmour's distrust of her
was based on some real foundation? A sort of panic seized Moy at
the thought of what his tongue might have done. Then he reassured
himself. He had not shown anyone the envelope. True, Tark's eyes
and his had met when just a second ago he had glanced at his
bureau to see that it was locked as usual. But Tark would not
connect his, Moy's, swift glance, with the place where Gilmour's
letter was kept. That letter lay heavily on Moy's mind. So much
might depend on it. Of course, in all probability, it would never
be needed, but...his visitors all began to talk at once. Miss
Pratt absolutely insisted on Moy coming to the show with them.
She said he was looking worried. He had already made his
arrangements with the porter to answer his telephone, and, as
always nowadays, left word with him where he could be at once
reached, if asked for by Mr. Gilmour.</p>

<p>Moy found the entertainment dull. He excused himself after the
first turn. Tark and Frederick Ingram had drifted out before it
had properly begun. Back inside the building where his flat was,
the porter came out to meet him as he made for the lift.</p>

<p>"One of your friends left his gloves behind him, sir. I let
him in. They were lying on a chair. That all right? He said his
name was Ingram."</p>

<p>Moy assured him it was and went on up. He remembered noticing
Tark's gloves lying in a chair, as that silent man reached up to
try one of the concealed lights in the dining-room. However,
perhaps Frederick had left his too, at any rate there were no
gloves to be seen now as he looked round his flat.</p>

<p>He felt out of sorts. Miss Pratt's words that Gilmour might be
dead haunted him, try as he would to shake them off. Where was
Gilmour? On what dark trail? His mind went to Miss Longstaff's
odd tale about his reluctance, or rather his dread, of being in
the same lift with the woman&mdash;Mrs. Findlay...but was there
any truth in that story? If not, for what purpose had that astute
young woman told him it? Was something about to happen which she
wished to be able to attribute to the woman with the floating
veil? Or...again a sort of chill swept over the young solicitor.
Had she stuffed him with any story just to get him into a
confidential mood, into a frame of mind to exchange his
confidence for her rubbish? His account of the letter left with
him for her account of a mysterious terror on the part of
Gilmour? He went to his bureau, unlocked it and then the drawer
where he kept the precious letter in another locked box. Yes, it
was still there. That awful fear that had suddenly gripped him
was absurd. Slightly comforted, but not at all pleased with
himself, he returned to his chair and picked up a book.</p>

<p>The telephone rang. In an instant he had lifted the receiver.
He heard Gilmour's voice, but speaking very, very quietly, as
though anxious not to be overheard, saying:</p>

<p>"That you, Moy? It's me, Gilmour. Oh, I'm quite all right,
thanks&mdash;" This in answer to a swift inquiry on Moy's part.
"But listen, don't get worried if I don't drop in at the Eggs and
Bacon tonight as I promised. I may not be able to get up to town.
And as I promised you to look in and report, I was afraid you
might do something silly if you didn't see me. Cheerio!"</p>

<p>"Righto!" came Moy's eager voice, "that's all right, old man."
He heard the receiver dropped at the other end on to its hook,
and sprang across the zoom. He unlocked the bureau with fingers
that shook a little. The signal had come. He pulled out the
envelope from its locked box, ran the paper-cutter carefully
along the edge and drew out&mdash;four blank envelopes. Just such
envelopes as were in his pigeon-holes always. He stared at the
four, and felt as though his heart had stopped beating for a
second. He had let Gilmour down He had let him down in what was
perhaps his utmost need, his last extremity. That quiet in
Gilmour's voice; was it fear, was it exhaustion, was it...</p>

<p>In a second he had the 'phone in his hand again and was asking
for Chief Inspector Pointer, but Pointer was not at the Yard. His
superintendent, however, took the urgent message that Moy almost
stammered into the 'phone. That official seemed to know all about
the case, and Moy was assured that the telephone call could, and
would, be traced at once, and help, if possible, sent to the man
who might need it so sorely.</p>

<p>Moy walked his room in an agony of horror and self-abasement.
Someone had got in here, picked the locks protecting that which
had been entrusted to him to guard, that which might mean life or
death to the man who had given it him, and after getting the
envelope, had taken out the precious contents and left him but
the empty shell, as one gives a child a bauble to keep it quiet.
He had only one hope&mdash;fingerprints.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER 17</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER asked to see Mrs. Pratt. He could
imagine quite easily what it was that she had written to Charles
Ingram, the reading of which had so upset him that his
brother-in-law thought that he had received some sort of warning
note, but Pointer wanted facts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pratt received the chief inspector coldly, with the look
of a woman with whom the past is past, and who has no intention
of being at the beck and call of Scotland Yard because she
happened to have stayed in the house when a death had
occurred.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Pratt," Pointer said, looking thoughtfully at his hat
this time, instead of at his shoes, "I'm afraid I must ask you
for some information which may be painful to you to give. But
it's really important&mdash;in clearing up all the circumstances
of Mr. Ingram's death&mdash;to be sure of what was in that letter
which you wrote him. The letter which he burned after reading it
in accordance with your own wishes. You say it was a rhyme of
some kind, but I think that can hardly be this paper to which I'm
referring. This one upset Mr. Ingram very badly. So badly that I
can guess, we can all guess, what was in it. But I must have
certainty before turning it down and passing on to other
points."</p>

<p>Mrs. Pratt listened with an absolutely mulish face. But it had
flushed. She had neither a mean nor a cowardly face, and that
being so, he persevered.</p>

<p>"I do really beg you to be frank with me, as I say, until I
know for certain that the letter in question only referred to
Miss Pratt, was only written with the intention of preventing Mr.
Ingram falling in love with someone who was going to marry
another man. I can't disregard it. I must try to find out its
contents."</p>

<p>"This is confidential?" Mrs. Pratt asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Supposing it is something which has nothing to do with Mr.
Ingram's death&mdash;absolutely." Pointer promised her.</p>

<p>"Of course it has nothing to do with his death!" But Mrs.
Pratt was pale now, and her teeth set themselves after each
sentence. "You've guessed rightly, Mr. Pointer. The letter you
seem to've heard about was one in which I showed Mr. Ingram how
hopeless it was for him to fall in love with my daughter."</p>

<p>"By telling him something about herself or her ancestry?"
Pointer went on. The request of Mrs. Pratt that Ingram should
burn the note suggested this, and her fear lest it fall into
other hands&mdash;and its supposed effect on Ingram.</p>

<p>She flushed again and hesitated, then looked up frankly.</p>

<p>"In confidence I told him something quite untrue. I had to. I
told him that Winnie had fits. That her father had had one when
he fell overboard and was drowned. I knew Mr. Ingram was very
strong about eugenics. It seems a horrid thing to have
done&mdash;but&mdash;well, I had very real and dreadfully urgent
reasons." Pointer waited. She had not finished. She was screwing
herself up to say more.</p>

<p>"I'm tormented. I don't mind owning to you, and in strict
confidence&mdash;by an awful thought, chief inspector. And that
is that Mr. Ingram may have wanted to commit suicide and drawn
Mr. Gilmour's bullet intentionally&mdash;after reading my
letter."</p>

<p>Pointer listened very carefully now.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Gilmour was a very good shot, as was Mr. Ingram,
I believe. And a good shot, when aiming a dummy cartridge at
anyone, would aim it true, wouldn't he? He would shoot straight,
thinking it was blank...nothing else would be natural. I've been
tormenting myself with the fear that Mr. Ingram may have reasoned
just like that and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;after my
letter&mdash;thought that life wasn't worth living. Of course I
haven't breathed a word of all this. And I should deny it if it
came out," she flashed a glance of fire at the detective officer,
"but between ourselves, and since there's still so much suspicion
of poor Mr. Gilmour about, I'm afraid that's how it may have
happened."</p>

<p>"That Mr. Ingram walked into the revolver, so to say, as
another man might under a train, or a bus..." Pointer looked
thoughtful.</p>

<p>She nodded. "I'm dreadfully sorry. But it had to be done." She
spoke as a surgeon might have, after an operation which has cost
the patient his life.</p>

<p>Pointer asked her a few questions, the drift of which she did
not see. They were to find out if she knew, or could think of,
any motive other than the one she had suggested. Then he had a
word or two with her as to Miss Longstaff, and that young woman's
probable feelings about the kindly interest which Miss Pratt took
in Mr. Gilmour. Mrs. Pratt was a frank woman by nature. She
seemed to be very open with Pointer.</p>

<p>"She's not in the least jealous, chief inspector, because Mr.
Gilmour is entirely and most devotedly in love with her, and
because of that he's quite safe from my daughter, however silly
she may be. She's just crying for the moon because she's so tired
of things that fall into her hands for the asking. But for Miss
Longstaff my daughter wouldn't give Mr. Gilmour a second
thought. As it is&mdash;well, it's passing off. I think I can
even say it has passed off already. By the way, did Mr. Ingram
burn that letter? Or did you find it? I was terrified of Mr. Tark
getting hold of it and handing it to Mr. Haliburton. Of course he
would prefer Mr. Haliburton to stay a bachelor. Mr. Tark won't
have the run of his houses when he's married as he has
now&mdash;just because of a lucky dip!"</p>

<p>"You may be quite reassured as to that. I believe that Mr.
Tark can't show that letter to Mr. Haliburton, now or ever," and
then Pointer thanked her and left. Supposing anyone knew or
assessed Miss Longstaff's character, and attachment to Gilmour
aright, and guessed the line which she had taken, the shooting of
Ingram by Gilmour had removed two men from Miss Pratt's path
therefore: Ingram by death, and Gilmour by making him no longer
inaccessible to Miss Pratt. Pointer could see how anyone who knew
the two girls and the two men might have expected just what had
happened to happen.</p>

<p>This thought led to some reflective pauses in the chief
inspector's brisk steps&mdash;he was walking to the
Yard&mdash;but if so, this was one of those motives which can
only be tested by elimination. Incidentally, Mrs. Pratt's
confession as to what had been in the note which she had given to
Ingram, and signed with her brief signature of <i>Ann Pratt</i>,
bore out part of Appleton's story, and therefore practically
dismissed the theory of an encounter with the third "post-office
bandit." Yes, Pointer decided to drop that idea entirely for the
present. He next thought over the woman's suggestion as to
Ingram's death being really suicide on his own part. It was
possible, but Pointer would have expected a man with such an
intellectual side to him as had Ingram, to take refuge from any
grief in the impregnable citadel of the spirit, like many another
man and woman.</p>

<p>Pointer's mind passed on, as so many times before, to the
posted papers. The <i>Of Von De</i> and the <i>Light Hell
Claire</i> scraps belonged possibly to these. Yet if ciphers, or
their deciphering, had played so much part in Ingram's income,
one would have expected to learn of many, or heavy, postal
deliveries at his flat. This was not the case. He had no office
anywhere, as far as could be learned, nor did his infrequent and
short absences from his study suggest this. Ingram seemed to have
lived the quiet uninterrupted life dear to a man of letters. His
half-brother and his sister claimed to have no idea that could
assist the police in explaining the dead man's unexpected
affluence. At The Tall House he had worked as one carrying out
routine work. There was one other tiny detail. Pointer, in going
over the proof-reading which Fred Ingram had done lately for his
brother, noticed a great falling off in Ingram's output since a
little before he went to The Tall House. Frederick said that his
half-brother had spoken of being very busy on some work which did
not need proof-reading. On Frederick expressing surprise,
Ingram&mdash;according to the younger man&mdash;had said curtly
that it was work for a firm who had all their proof-reading done
by a member of their own staff.</p>

<p>What work would bring in four thousand a year without
spreading the author's name abroad? And there was no known
regular contribution of Charles Ingram's to account for the
income paid him. Pointer felt that he ought to be able to think
through this problem, as he had so many another. He dearly loved
this part of his work. He stopped at a newspaper stall and, as so
often before in this case, let his eyes and hands play over all
papers spread out. Gardening articles weren't signed...but Ingram
was no gardener...besides four thousand a year...Racing? Ingram
had never gone to more than a couple of races, and had no books
bearing on the sport of kings. Disconsolately, but doggedly, he
turned the pages of a daily that he himself never glanced at,
except from professional duty. A large square block caught his
eye...held his eye...filled his eye...a crossword puzzle for
whose solution three thousand pounds was offered. The author's name
was not mentioned. He must be a clever chap, and possess a mind
that was mechanical in a way, and yet extremely
flexible...scholarly...mathematical...Pointer dropped the papers
and walked on deep in thought. Ingram had wanted to catch the
midnight post...quarter day was a week ago; the thousand had
always been invested shortly after quarter day, would it again
come to hand now that he was dead? It should have done so by now.
Two days after quarter day had seen Ingram investing that
thousand for the last five years. Could he test the possibility
that Ingram was a crossword writer in any way? He himself did not
go in for that amusement, but Chief Inspector Franklin did. He
was known for his love of them. Pointer decided to go to his
rooms at the Yard as soon as he had seen if there was anything
important waiting for himself. But he found his superintendent
with the telephone in one hand and two constables taking down
notes in front of him.</p>

<p>"Gilmour left a message to be sent to you should he find
himself in danger." The superintendent rapped out the news just
received from the stricken Moy.</p>

<p>"The 'phone call has been traced. It came from a public
telephone booth in Brixton. I sent Inspector Watts there at once
with Evans and Ridgewell." The superintendent left the other to
carry on.</p>

<p>Within half an hour Watts was telephoning from the box in
question. There had been so many robberies from these public
telephone boxes lately that a watch had been kept on them. None
of the users had in the least resembled Gilmour. But Pointer had
not thought they would.</p>

<p>Pointer set all wheels in motion, and then drove round to
Moy's flat. He found him almost beside himself with worry.</p>

<p>"This envelope&mdash;I slit it at the top&mdash;but it still
bears Gilmour's seal&mdash;his ring, you know&mdash;just as it
did when he handed it me. Nothing shows to the eye&mdash;but what
about fingerprints on it and on the bureau? There were no
fingerprints on the blank envelopes. As for the one in which they
were enclosed, Pointer examined the back with his lens. As he
expected, he found so many of them that it would take the Yard's
experts at least a day to sort them. It was a hopeless task. Moy
again repeated that the envelope handed him had looked quite
untouched when he took it out just now.</p>

<p>"I think we shall find that this seal has been shaved off with
a hot knife, and fastened on with some form of spirit or gum,"
Pointer said finally. "May I keep it for fingerprints? It will be
a long job. But some may turn up which will be of
use&mdash;though, frankly, I doubt it."</p>

<p>Moy said he could keep it for any reason which might possibly
help Gilmour.</p>

<p>"He's placed himself <i>hors la loi</i>, in a way," he went
on, "but can't you save him? Can't he be reached?"</p>

<p>Pointer could only say that they were all working their
hardest on the case and might yet come up with Gilmour.</p>

<p>"Not too late," came almost as a prayer from Moy.</p>

<p>"I hope not too," Pointer said very warmly to that, and asked
Moy when his flat had been left vacant since the envelope had
been handed him. When had it not, would have been easier to
answer, it seemed. The flats were a simple form of service flat,
the porter was a careful man, but he had four buildings to look
after, and he could not, and did not, pretend to see who went in
and out. If anyone had managed to obtain Moy's key, or had a
similar one&mdash;it was not at all peculiar, Pointer
found&mdash;it would be the easiest thing in the world to come
and go unnoticed. Moy kept regular hours of a morning, and
generally of an afternoon. He was seldom in of an evening from
eight till past eleven. Altogether Moy's heart sank lower and
lower, the more facts bearing on the matter he gave the chief
inspector.</p>

<p>"And who knew of the letter?" The question he dreaded came at
last. Dreaded and yet welcomed. For Moy was aflame to catch the
person who had done this thing. He told the other of all those
who certainly knew of the whereabouts of the letter, and added
those who might do so.</p>

<p>"Fred Ingram and Tark both left the music-hall almost at
once," Moy went on. "Tark first slipped out with a word about a
forgotten engagement, and Frederick followed at once. I had an
idea he wanted to say something to him."</p>

<p>"I should think that's quite possible," Pointer replied
gravely enough outwardly, but with an inward chuckle. For that
Fred Ingram, when he heard of Appleton's and Tark's successes at
Monte Carlo, must have guessed that he had been spoofed was a
foregone conclusion. Frederick was by no means a fool. Moy spoke
of the incident of the gloves. Fred, when rung up just now, said
that he had returned for his, and been shown in and out by the
porter. Tark said that he had not left his behind, him. Leaving
Moy to feel how inadequate is even Scotland Yard when confronted
with some situations, Pointer went back to the Yard. After a
glance in at his own rooms to make sure that nothing more had
come for him to alter the lines of The Tall House puzzle, he sent
for all the papers with crossword competitions running in them,
beginning with the current month. Scotland, Yard has a well-stocked
room, where papers and periodicals stay for a while,
before being passed on to a sort of Home for Decayed Print in the
suburbs.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER 18</h2>

<p class="first">His colleague, Chief Inspector Franklin, had not
yet come in, and Pointer had to work alone, sorting out on one
side those Crosswords whose clues seemed to him of the kind to be
written by such a man as Ingram, to be worth such a salary as
Pointer believed might have been paid him for their
composition.</p>

<p>Then he took these selected ones, discarded for the moment
those with no money prizes attached, though he was not so sure of
this being necessary, and concentrated on what remained. The
fourth paper which he studied suddenly made his eyes sparkle. He
was looking at the answers to the last week's puzzle, reading
them along with the clues re-printed beside them. The first clue
had read:</p>

<p>"Was called an idol, and whether one or not, contributed to
the loss of an order." The solution was <i>Baphomet</i>.</p>

<p>A pamphlet rose before Pointer's mind, a nearly-finished
article on the little copper image of a man with a beard and a
crown found in every Chapter of the Knights Templar when their
Order was broken up.</p>

<p>Ingram was one of those who believed that the name. Baphomet,
or the little idol, as their enemies called it, stood for a
cipher in which their True Rule and the Rite of Initiation had
been written.</p>

<p>And then further down among the solutions was a word which
again brought him up with a mental shock&mdash;the word
<i>Devon</i> and further down still was an <i>Of</i>.</p>

<p>He thought of the so-called tri-lingual cipher OF VON DE and
chuckled. From the first he had seen no reason why the letters
might not stand for "Of Devon." He looked for <i>Hell, Light,
Claire</i>, which also had seemed to him a fortuitous
combination, but did not find them. He finished the clues and
their solutions and sat back. The solver, the prize-winner, was
given as a Mrs. Sampson of Lordship Lane, Dulwich. She must be a
well-read woman to have solved this puzzle. A scholar had set
these clues, and meant them to be tricky. The paper was the
<i>Weekly Universe</i>, one which was pre-eminently a lottery
paper, that is to say, its sales were influenced by the size and
number of its prizes. This crossword for instance was a weekly
feature it seemed, and always with a three-thousand pound prize
for an all-correct solution.</p>

<p>He picked up the telephone and was put through to a news
agency whose manager was a personal friend.</p>

<p>"Who is the writer of the <i>Weekly Universe's</i>
Crosswords?"</p>

<p>"Lord Bulstrode himself," came the reply. "He's awfully proud
of them. Some crosswords, aren't they?"</p>

<p>Lord Bulstrode was a man who, from the position of a cigarette
salesman, had risen, first to be a tobacco merchant, and then to
be the founder and editor-in-chief of the <i>Weekly Universe</i>,
which had been running its sporting life for some eight years
now. Lord Bulstrode...self-made if ever that adjective can be
used...There was erudition in these puzzles...</p>

<p>He laid down the receiver and decided to try once more for
Franklin. This time he found the other in, and with a minute to
spare, while some fingerprints were being identified for him.</p>

<p>"First of all," Pointer began, "I want to say that I'm
dropping your post-office robbery for the time being. I can't
find anything to support it. But look here, Franklin, you're keen
on crosswords; what about the one set by the <i>Weekly
Universe</i>? The three-thousand pound prize one. Is it a good
one?"</p>

<p>"Best going," came the unhesitating reply. "And the hardest.
No initial letters or spaces to help you. And I don't say the
clues aren't a bit too clever. Oh, none of your <i>Personal
Pronoun</i> or <i>Japanese Coin</i> tricks, but for sheer
difficulty, well, I've never known more than one person at a time
to win it, if that. Often there's no correct solution. I got
within two breaks of it myself once."</p>

<p>"I was wondering whether it would be possible to deduce the
writer of a puzzle from his crosswords," Pointer said slowly.</p>

<p>Franklin was a man of quick apprehension.</p>

<p>"Easily. The difficulty would be to check one's guesses or
deductions. As a matter of fact, we discussed the <i>Weekly
Universe's</i> man at my Crosswords Club some time ago. And we
think we've got him pretty well taped. You see, to win a really
good puzzle, you've got to get yourself into the writer's skin
mentally. We mean to capture that prize yet between the lot of
us. But about the writer&mdash;he's one person. Has been for at
least the last five years. He's distinctly a gentleman. A
Cambridge, not an Oxford man. No great cricketer or footballer.
Fond of tennis and fair at golf. Possibly a rowing man; we
differed on that. No knowledge of animals. Traveled very little,
if any. Well up in science. Personally I think he's a clergyman,
but the others decided he was a schoolmaster, probably science
master at some public school. He's unmarried. Post-war, of
course. Rather young, I think. They say early middle age. Fond of
John Masefield. Staunch Conservative. Member of at least one good
London club. Lives out of town. Fair knowledge of flowers but
hardly enough for a really good gardener. No good at music. Fond
of a good play with a weakness for Ibsen. Loathes Strindberg. A
first-class knowledge of chess. And one of the men of our
Crosswords Club, a very brainy chap, says he's an authority on
the Knights Templar or at least on their Order. I don't quite
follow him there...but it's possible. There, that's the outcome
of five years' close study&mdash;very close study."</p>

<p>"I'm told that Lord Bulstrode writes these crosswords
himself," Pointer said innocently.</p>

<p>"Rot!" was the reply. "You mean that he wants it thought he
writes them. That's true enough. So keep my opinion and that of
the club to yourself. But what have crosswords to do with your
murder?"</p>

<p>"Have you had any clues lately that <i>Hell</i> or
<i>Light</i> or <i>Claire</i> would fit?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Claire!</i>" Franklin said in a tone of anguish.
"<i>Claire!</i> I never thought of that. Well, it's not too late
yet. That one has to be sent in this week. Half a minute&mdash;"
He dived into his pocket and out with his letter-case. From it
came a folded note-book, and opening it at a page, he jotted down
on a printed Crossword square <i>Claire</i>. Pointer looked over
his shoulder. He saw no words among the other's solutions that
interested him. But four of the words found on the scattered
bits, four of the so-called "tri-lingual cipher," had turned up
already. The others would doubtless follow, for none of them
fitted here. He was still studying the squares and making quite
sure of this, which was not so easy as it sounds&mdash;for the
clue to <i>Claire</i> was "Means light in some places, and yet
may mean much more"&mdash;when Franklin was called away by his
superintendent. He picked up his note-book and ran for it, with a
murmur about having no time to waste as <i>he</i> was not on a
murder case.</p>

<p>Pointer stood a moment quite still, looking down at his
shoe-tips. That Ingram was the writer of crosswords for which he was
paid a thousand pounds a quarter, each of which carried big prize
money, explained several things...that inner pocket with its
special fastening...the folded waistcoat under his
pillow...supposing he had some notes or memoranda of the
solutions...still in it, or even a notification of where he had
sent his registered letter. His refusal to help with crossword
solutions, or even to hear them discussed in his presence. And
the crossword puzzle with Claire in it had only come out the day
before yesterday, Sunday. And <i>Hell</i> and <i>Light</i> were
not yet out. For they would not answer any of the clues published
so far. That meant that Ingram had sent off several crosswords,
not merely one on the night of his death. Probably, as he was
paid quarterly, he posted thirteen puzzles. And if the murderer
was out to get Ingram's most carefully guarded copy of the
thirteen solutions which Pointer now believed was the real motive
for Ingram's death, then the murderer would naturally have waited
until the puzzles were posted. But not longer. The next morning
might see Ingram taking his copy of the solutions to some safe,
or Pointer was much mistaken. He judged the dead man to have been
scrupulous down to the last detail in his work. He'd been in a
hurry to get something&mdash;manuscript&mdash;to the post in
time...He had worked as a rule with his door shut, if not locked.
No one had been allowed to see at what he was working. No one, as
far as Pointer could find, knew that he was a composer of
crosswords. Thirteen puzzles possibly sent off in one batch.
Thirteen times three thousand is thirty-nine thousand pounds.
Quite a nice little sum. Yes, here was a motive which was quite
as good as even an infallible system, and which explained all the
actions of the dead man as well. It was a motive, moreover, which
would not be as dangerous as playing the system would be. For
that was known by at least four people to exist. It would have to
be played openly. The solutions could be worked in secret. No one
seemed to have suspected Ingram of being the author of these
puzzles. Pointer went through the papers on his table, and made a
list of the winners. The lady who had solved <i>Baphomet</i>
interested him, for the clue set for that word had been all but
beyond the allowable in sketchiness. The week before, the prize
had been won by a Mr. Nevern, of Pawcett Road, Hammersmith. The
week before that, there had been no winner. The week before that,
it had been a parson...Pointer had his constable clerk write down
all this year's winners. Meanwhile he picked up the telephone,
and again talked to his friend of the news agency. How did people
receive their money, if they won one of the <i>Weekly
Universe</i> three-thousand-pound prizes?</p>

<p>He was told that if living in England, the winner had to apply
in person at the <i>Weekly Universe's</i> office. If they lived
in some impossible place, Bulolo for instance, the check would be
paid into their account on receipt of a duplicate of the coupon
sent in showing the claimant's writing and with a photograph of
himself attached. The paper wanted advertisement, of course, and
tried to interest the local press in the matter. As far as his
informer could say, the prize had only once been won by a man
outside the British Isles, and that had been a Remittance man who
had died of drink two days before his check was sent him.</p>

<p>Pointer said he wanted information about the last four winners
of this particular prize. He wanted some bright intellect sent
along to secure it, while he himself made his swift way to the
room of the Competition Editor of the <i>Weekly Universe</i>,
whose name the agency gave him as Henry Orlebar. As he walked
around to the huge white building only a stone's throw from the
Yard, he remembered that Lord Bulstrode had got his barony for
his financial aid to the Conservative party, that Ingram had done
well when he stood as Conservative candidate for his university
town, lowering the Liberal majority handsomely. That Bulstrode
and Ingram were both members of the Junior Carlton Club, of which
Haliburton was a member too. Could the link be political as well,
supposing it to exist, between Bulstrode and that quarterly
thousand pounds?</p>

<p>He found Henry Orlebar ready to see him immediately on his
official card being sent in. Orlebar was a lean, horsey-looking
man who might have sat for a painting of the horse prophet the
world over. But his manners were good, and his smile very
engaging.</p>

<p>"Circumstances look as though Mr. Ingram's death might be due
to foul play, Mr. Orlebar, which is why I have called on you for
a full account of why a thousand pounds has been paid him once a
quarter from this office for the last five years." Orlebar let
this pass, so Pointer had guessed right.</p>

<p>"It's really Lord Bulstrode's fine feeling," Orlebar began
with a frank gaze bent on his visitor, as though delighted to
clear up any perplexity. "Of course this is quite confidential,
but Mr. Ingram was of such enormous use to him when he met him
not long after starting this paper. I mean, by working out
figures concerned with advertising and circulation which
revolutionized all hitherto conceived ideas of such things.
Bulstrode followed his advice&mdash;his system really&mdash;and
the paper has advanced by leaps and bounds. Lord Bulstrode
offered him a sort of extra post as Director of Circulation and
Sales but Ingram turned the offer down quite decidedly. So
Bulstrode insisted on his accepting a salary of four thousand a
year, a mere one per cent, of what he saved the paper, thanks to
his genius for figures."</p>

<p>It all sounded so straightforward. But apart from his
preconceived notion as to what the payment was for, Pointer would
not have believed a word of it. Such a sum, paid for such a
reason, would have been sent in directly to Ingram's banking
account, or posted him by check.</p>

<p>"And why has not the usual thousand been sent in this quarter
day?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We're waiting for Lord Bulstrode to be back and give his
directions as to sending it in," Orlebar said brightly. "Ingram's
death, of course, alters the usual procedure."</p>

<p>"Why was it always sent in such a fantastic way?" Pointer
asked next.</p>

<p>"Ingram's own wish entirely. He insisted on notes being posted
him in a registered envelope. Whether he has any relatives who
sponge on him...of course, it's not for me to say. But getting it
in this way, it's obvious that he need not pay it into his
account unless he wished to. Say it was overdrawn...he said
something to me once&mdash;" Orlebar seemed to have a perfect
spasm of frankness at the remembrance, his eyes looking
positively infantile in their candor&mdash;"which rather
suggested that. Though I've forgotten the exact words by
now."</p>

<p>The one-hundred-pound notes looked to Pointer much more like
Bulstrode's own preference, but Pointer thanked him, was assured
that Orlebar had only been too delighted to be of use, as Lord
Bulstrode would be, if he were not in South Africa getting some
cool breezes instead of this heat. Of course, Orlebar went on to
say, had he himself had any idea that Ingram's salary, for it was
virtually that, was of any interest, he would have at once told
the Yard all about it. But seeing that there seemed no question
but that the poor chap had been shot by Gilmour&mdash;most
unfortunate devil&mdash;he, Orlebar, had not even considered the
matter.</p>

<p>"But now that you do know our suspicions, now that I tell you
in confidence that we are thinking of murder as an explanation
for Mr. Ingram's death, are you willing to put in writing what
you have just told me, and swear to it?" Pointer asked. "I mean
the reason given by you for his salary. I don't mind telling you,
Mr. Orlebar, that what you have just told me does not square at
all with certain information in our possession. Certain written
information."</p>

<p>Orlebar no longer beamed frankness and candor. His thin face
grew stiff. He rubbed his chin.</p>

<p>"Umph...I couldn't do anything like that, of course, without
consulting Lord Bulstrode," he said promptly. "I might be
mistaken...I wouldn't care to swear to anything without
consulting him."</p>

<p>Pointer said that he thought that just as well, and inquired
when the editor-in-chief would be back. He was expected next
week. Pointer said the Yard would try and wait for his return,
leaving Orlebar looking as though he would like to chew a straw,
and meditate a while. Pointer quite understood his silence. The
position was one which only Bulstrode himself could clear, up.
Fortunately, the Yard would insist on having a full
acknowledgment from him of the exact work done by the dead man,
for that work&mdash;the concoction of the weekly crossword
puzzles set by the paper, would, Pointer now felt sure, be the
motive put forward by the prosecution for the murder of Charles
Ingram.</p>

<p>Back at the Yard, Pointer was deep in his notes, when a
clever-looking young reporter was shown in. He was from the
agency.</p>

<p>"Here you are!" He pulled out some papers from his pocket.
"Mrs. Sampson, winner of The <i>Weekly Universe's Great Crossword
Competition</i>. Very little but that is known about her. Here's
her picture, and I'm told it's a very poor one." He showed a
grim-looking, middle-aged woman wearing a rather obviously false
fringe that came down into her eyes.</p>

<p>"I got on to the <i>Weekly Universe's</i> reporter who had
been sent down to break the glad tidings to her and interview
her. He said she refused to tell anything about herself except
that she was a widow, and was fond of crosswords. She claimed to
have solved this one with the help of a friend. Friend to remain
anonymous. The paper wanted to give her a reception, but she said
she had a sore throat, and must not expose it to the night air.
She really did seem in pain, and could hardly croak, the
<i>Weekly Universe</i> man said, so they let her off the
function, as she said she was leaving for a trip around the world
as soon as it could be arranged. She was handed the check last
week at the newspaper office, thanked them in a way that
suggested that she was only getting her deserts, and cashed the
check at once at Cooks, as had been arranged at her request by
the paper. One of the editorial staff went along with her. She
paid for a tour round the world, which took close on five hundred
pounds, and had the rest handed over to her in French franc
notes."</p>

<p>Pointer looked at the date of the payment. It was the day
preceding Ingram's death.</p>

<p>"I went on to her address myself," the reporter continued.
"It's a small house which lets out rooms. She had taken hers for
a fortnight, the time just covering the reception of the news
that she had won the prim and the receiving of the check. She had
left there, though her tour is not due to start for another week
yet, but she looked in at Cooks twice since then, once three days
ago, once this morning. Only to pick up some folders. She's the
sort of vision not encountered by the dozen. Corkscrew ringlets,
and a black veil floating down her back pinned to her hat by a
silver star in front. She didn't dress like that in Dulwich, and
therefore it doesn't show in her picture. The <i>Weekly
Universe</i> chap thinks she put them all on in honor of the
great occasion of coming to the office."</p>

<p>Judging by the fortnight for which the rooms were taken, it
almost looked as though Mrs. Sampson had known that they would
cover just that particular period. Which, Pointer thought, was
extremely likely.</p>

<p>"Now as to the winner of the week before," went on the
reporter, "he's a chap called Algernon Nevern, and lived off the
Hammersmith Broadway, a retired schoolmaster. Pawcett Road, No.
21, is the address. He was given quite a reception at the
Hammersmith Town Hall a week ago, has left his room in Pawcett
Road, and has vanished. I can't find anyone who has seen him
since."</p>

<p>So Nevern had vanished. That brought things looping back again
to Pointer's idea of a disappearance being connected with
Ingram's murder. He would look up Mr. Nevern at once, otherwise
the lady with the obviously added fringe, would have had his
first attention.</p>

<p>He felt in his letter case for a fragment of wall paper which
had never left him since he picked it up in the passage where lay
Ingram's dead body, a piece of wallpaper which, so far, he had
not been able to match. He was now going to see fresh rooms. One
certainly, and probably two. He would not be at all surprised to
learn within a few hours where this scrap came from. Since it was
Nevern who seemed to have vanished, he would expect it to match
Nevern's paper, supposing as he did, that it had been dropped in
the corridor by the merest mischance, and had not been noticed by
the person dropping it.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER 19</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER went first to Lordship Lane. But the
house in question neither knew, nor cared to know more, of the
taciturn Mrs. Sampson, who had lodged with them so short a time,
had won such a fortune, and had not distributed it among the
inmates of the house. He learned no more than what had been told
to the news agency reporter. They claimed to have no idea whence
she had come to them, except that they fancied it was out of
town. She brought in flowers on occasions which suggested a
garden some distance away, as they were always drooping and
flagging. She had had no luggage except one suitcase. Now, she
had spoken to Cooks of luggage for the hold, and had the right
labels for big trunks given her. Where was that luggage? Had she
no friends, he asked. No, none. No letters had ever come for her
until she had won "all that money," when the house had been
swamped with communications for her, 'phone calls for her,
telegrams for her, visitors asking for her. Had she had no 'phone
calls at all before? Pointer had tipped the elderly housemaid
well, and she was inclined to thaw. He explained that it was a
question of wanting Mrs. Sampson as witness to a street accident.
It was most important to get into touch with her. The housemaid
said that Mrs. Sampson used to get a telephone call almost every
evening. Always the same voice speaking. A man's voice.
Dreadfully difficult to make out what he was saying. He never
gave his name, not that she would have understood it, probably,
if he had, but only asked for Mrs. Sampson, who seemed to expect
the call and was always ready to answer it. Had the housemaid any
idea of where the speaker at the other end came from? She had
not. Did Mrs. Sampson ever ring him up, and if so, had she heard
the number. Mrs. Sampson often did. She couldn't remember the
number, but it was River something or other...That meant
Hammersmith.</p>

<p>He was permitted to look into Mrs. Sampson's rooms. They had
been let again, and did not interest him after one keen look
around:</p>

<p>He asked about Mrs. Sampson's throat, and learned that she
could hardly speak aloud, and could be heard gargling morning and
evening with maddening thoroughness. Mrs. Sampson usually wore
corkscrew ringlets and a floating veil on her hat, didn't she?
The housemaid stared. He must be thinking of another woman. Mrs.
Sampson wore her hair right into her eyes, straight untidy hair
it was. As for hats, she lived in a black felt hat of severest
cut while at the house.</p>

<p>Pointer drove to Hammersmith. Mrs. Sampson fitted the idea
which he had had at the back of his mind all along as a possible
solution to the puzzle at The Tall House. A rather unusual
looking woman, large and full of figure, who seemed to have no
relations or friends to inquire about her...she had, moreover,
presumably had at least two thousand five hundred pounds in
francs in her possession, and whatever other money she
owned...But she had not disappeared. And Nevern had.</p>

<p>Pointer stopped at the house in Pawcett Road, a dingy
place.</p>

<p>"He's gone!" the untidy but good-natured looking maid said
promptly as soon as Pointer mentioned his name. "You mean him as
won all that money? Said he couldn't stand 'the notriarty.' I
asked him what he meant by that and he says people coming cadging
all day long." She flushed. "I mean&mdash;" she began awkwardly,
"I mean&mdash;well, of course I don't mean&mdash;I wasn't
intending nothing, sir, in repeating that. Not in your case."</p>

<p>"I haven't come about the money he won," Pointer said
reassuringly. "I only want him as a witness in a street accident.
How did he win his money? Horses?"</p>

<p>He heard all about the crossword competition, and interspersed
the hearing with questions which gave him a very good idea of Mr.
Nevern's appearance and habits.</p>

<p>"Any friends who might know where he is now?" he asked
finally.</p>

<p>"He had a lady friend. She used to ring him up ever so often
on the 'phone. She's had a bad throat lately. Said it hurt her to
raise her voice. Oh&mdash;" in answer to further
questions&mdash;"she was ever such an old friend. They used to
telephone to each other nearly every day. She did crosswords too.
Wonderful to think that there's all that money waiting for you if
you only guessed right, isn't it!"</p>

<p>"What was her name? You mean Mrs. Sampson, don't you?" Pointer
said easily.</p>

<p>"I never heard her name. She never gave it. 'Just ask Mr.
Nevern to step to the telephone please,' was what she used to
say, or 'Please tell Mr. Nevern that I think I've solved it
myself,' and when I would ask who was speaking she'd just say,
'He'll know who it is.' She never even so much as gave her
number."</p>

<p>"And didn't you hear him ask for it?" Pointer said with real
curiosity.</p>

<p>"He had a telephone of his own put into his room. It's been
taken out when he left, of course. That's why he never had no
letters or hardly ever. He said he liked 'phones best and always
used them himself."</p>

<p>Pointer asked if Mr. Nevern's room had been taken? It had not.
Could he see it? He was often asked by young men if he could tell
them of pleasant inexpensive rooms somewhere central. She took
him down a passage and up a flight of stairs to what was
evidently the best room in the house. And on the wall Pointer saw
a rather pretty but faded wall paper of dun and blue and
heliotrope, the same pattern as on the little piece in his
pocket-book. Over the mantel-shelf a long strip had been torn
away. He pointed to it now.</p>

<p>"What a pity! Spoils the room," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nevern did that just at the end. He always kept piles of
books there and caught it up with one of them. It had been loose
for ever so long. I saw him do it. He was hurrying out, and came
back in a rush, snatched up two books, and ran for it. That was
when he did it."</p>

<p>How long had Mr. Nevern lived here? Nearly a year, it seemed.
Had he always had this lady friend who telephoned him? Not till
about three months or maybe a bit more, the little maid thought.
No, there wasn't no one in the house who could tell the caller
more about Mr. Nevern, because he hadn't any friends. "Nice old
gentleman he is too," she went on, "if only one could understand
him. Cleft palate he told me it was. Made him talk so funny!" She
giggled. "Not that he ever tried to talk much. I liked him. He
made you sort of sorry for him, no friends nor nothing, and
always so easy to please."</p>

<p>Pointer took the room at once for a Mr. Jones. He did not want
that wall paper removed. Mr. Jones was moving in at once, he told
her, though he might not always be able to sleep there. "He often
has to take night duty," he finished up.</p>

<p>The little maid said they had had a reporter once in the house
and once a couple of girls from a dance club who were just the
same. The main thing to Pointer was that the room was taken and
the paper safe for the time being. His next move was to find Mrs.
Sampson. Since Nevern was linked with The Tall House by that
piece of wall paper and his disappearance, then the winner of the
next crossword prize was equally linked. For from Nevern on,
Pointer believed that all the next thirteen prizes were destined
for one and the same person&mdash;the murderer. The trouble was
how to find this so-called Mrs. Sampson, for he did not think
that her name, any more than her fringe, was genuine. After a cup
of coffee at a nearby Lyons, he returned to Pawcett Road. He
hoped that the little maid would have either recollected
something more or have talked with others in the house who might
remember something more. As the taker of Mr. Nevern's room he was
admitted at once. Wasn't Mr. Jones in yet? Pointer seemed
surprised, but, as he himself had paid for a week's rent in
advance, not dismayed.</p>

<p>"That lady who 'phoned to Mr. Nevern keeps worrying me," he
confided to the maid, "she might be the very lady who had the
street accident, and we particularly want to find out who she is.
No name in her purse, poor soul. Nothing to tell where she
lives."</p>

<p>"There's a charlady what helps once a week, Emmie," another
maid listening near broke in now, "she says that she heard Mr.
Nevern saying over the 'phone once in a funny voice, 'Ask Mrs.
Findlay to come here to the 'phone, please. No name. Just ask her
to come to the 'phone.' Well, that sounds as though it might be
this Mrs. Findlay who telephoned him that often."</p>

<p>Mrs. Findlay! Pointer had seen that name written in a book
which Miss Longstaff had among some of her books. Mrs.
Findlay...and the address had been the house where Miss Longstaff
herself had taken a room since leaving The Tall House, a house of
what are quaintly called American flatlets, the other side of
Hammersmith Broadway from Pawcett Road. Miss Longstaff...Mrs.
Findlay...Nevern...Ingram's murderer...Pointer walked on with a
quickened pulse. The house in question was, as he knew from his
men's reports, a most respectable one chiefly lived in by
business men and women or professional people with small
salaries. He found it without any difficulty, and asked for Mrs.
Findlay.</p>

<p>"She's left here, sir. About three weeks ago. Gone down to her
cottage in the country, before going abroad."</p>

<p>Along came a stout woman in black. This was the manageress.
She took charge of the inquiries.</p>

<p>"The lady is wanted as a witness in a street accident,"
Pointer explained, handing her his official card.</p>

<p>"She's gone to her cottage in the country before going on a
tour round the world. Thinking of settling in New Patagonia, or
New California, or one of those places...She hasn't started yet,
for I saw her only this morning passing the house."</p>

<p>"The address of her cottage?" he asked. The manageress did not
know it.</p>

<p>"How about some friend who can tell me where to find her?" he
suggested. "She doubtless has quite a number."</p>

<p>"Only one. An old gentleman."</p>

<p>"You don't mean a Mr. Nevern? To whom the accident has
happened?" Pointer asked quickly. "Could you describe him?"</p>

<p>The manageress did. An elderly gentleman with curly gray hair
worn rather long. The manageress did not know his name, and,
though she had often seen him, had hardly ever really looked at
him. "Personally I couldn't have stood his way of talking. He had
a cleft palate. But there, I dare say he was ever so nice an old
gentleman, really!"</p>

<p>"Has he called since Mrs. Findlay had left?"</p>

<p>"Yes, twice. But not lately. Just at first. He never gave his
name, just walked to her room and knocked, if she was in, or
asked for her and said he would come again if she was out."</p>

<p>"This is Mrs. Findlay, isn't it?" He showed a copy of the
newspaper portrait of the winner of the crossword puzzle. It had
been cleverly blurred to look like a snapshot. The manageress
shook her head.</p>

<p>"Same sort of fat face and that, but Mrs. Findlay had hair
going over so far back on her forehead, and long ringlets over
her ears."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she's put a fringe on to be taken in," a maid
suggested, looking at the picture in her turn.</p>

<p>"Catch Mrs. Findlay doing that sort of thing," scoffed the
manageress.</p>

<p>"And where's her veil and her star?" asked the maid, laughing.
"She wouldn't be found drowned without them, would she?"</p>

<p>Pointer obtained a very close, but not very useful description
of the real Mrs. Findlay. The chief thing both maid and
manageress insisted on was a floating black veil which she always
wore fastened to her hair or hat by a silver star&mdash;the star
of peace.</p>

<p>"How about a Miss Longstaff who lives here?" Pointer asked
finally. "Does she know her?"</p>

<p>"She lives here, but she's not in at present. She knows Mrs.
Findlay all right&mdash;in a sort of way&mdash;or did. I mean she
knew her to speak to while Mrs. Findlay lived here, but they
haven't kept it up."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Findlay wouldn't know who Miss Longstaff is, would she!"
giggled the maid. The manageress shot her a reproving glance.</p>

<p>"She means that Miss Longstaff took her room under her pen-name,
'Miss Gray.' She writes as that, and we called her that at
first. But now that she's really going to live here she gave us
her real name. Lots of writers do the same." The manageress spoke
defensively.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't she know where this cottage of Mrs. Findlay's is?"
Pointer persisted. "I really do want to get into touch with the
lady."</p>

<p>"Miss Longstaff wouldn't know!" The manageress was certain of
that. She explained that certainty in the next sentence. "She
asked me for it after Mrs Findlay left. But I hadn't got it."</p>

<p>"Did she too know the old gentleman with the cleft
palate?"</p>

<p>The manageress thought that most unlikely, for Mrs. Findlay
never let anyone into her room when he called. "On account of his
infirmity, I think," she explained in her kindly way. She looked
a good-natured soul.</p>

<p>Pointer asked about Miss Longstaff herself, and was told of
how she arrived in the house. The manageress repeated that, "of
course, as soon as she came here really to live she gave her real
name."</p>

<p>Pointer returned to Mrs. Findlay and his desire for a word
with her. Where did she generally have her meals? No one knew,
except that she was never gone long. That finished his talk for
the moment. He remembered the large Lyons where he had had his
own coffee, and went back there. At this hour it was almost
deserted. He again spoke of trying to find a lady&mdash;he
described Mrs. Findlay with her floating veil&mdash;who was
wanted as a witness to an accident.</p>

<p>"That's our star!" the manageress, a young and merry-eyed
girl, said with a laugh. "We call her that because of the silver
badge she always wears. She used to come here regularly twice a
day, but we haven't seen her for&mdash;getting on for three weeks
it must be now...Or rather, she passed here only this morning, so
I've seen her, but not to come in. She's left us."</p>

<p>"And perhaps you know the old gentleman who had the accident.
Nice old gentleman everyone says he was, cleft palate..." Pointer
described Mr. Nevern.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean him as won all that money&mdash;Mr. Nevern!" The
manageress and a couple of waitresses were genuinely sorry to
hear of an accident to him, "he's awfully short-sighted," one of
them added. "Fancy having had an accident now!"</p>

<p>"They were friends, weren't they?" Pointer inquired, as though
he knew that they were.</p>

<p>"In a sort of way," the manageress said rather hesitatingly,
"they used to just exchange a word. Crossword puzzles was the
hobby of both, you see. I heard him speak to her first of all.
She'd been coming here ever so much longer than he had, oh, years
and years, before I was moved here, and he's only been our
customer for a few months. But he leaned across her table one
day, and asked if she would pardon his asking it, but he saw she
worked at crosswords too, and could she suggest a word of eight
letters for Manifestation. And quick as quick she said 'Epiphany
will that fit?' I was working on that one myself at the time in
The People, so I've remembered it. She was quite right, too.
After that they'd exchange a word or two, and then he sat down at
her table once and they started talking in earnest. Not about
crosswords. All about wars and killing men by thousands and so
on. Made your flesh creep to hear them..."</p>

<p>Pointer said that apparently no one knew where Mrs. Findlay
now lived. She had gone down to a cottage that she had
somewhere&mdash;-</p>

<p>"In Buckinghamshire," put in a waitress. "I'm from there. I
told her so, and she said as she had a cottage there. She didn't
say where exactly."</p>

<p>That was all Pointer learned, but it was quite a good deal. He
went back to the apartment house and asked for Miss Longstaff
again. She was in and greeted him with perfect composure.</p>

<p>"I came to find out the address of a Mrs. Findlay, she's
wanted as a witness in an accident case," he said easily. "Do you
know where she is living now?"</p>

<p>Miss Longstaff said that she did not.</p>

<p>"How did I happen to meet her? Oh, hasn't the manageress told
you?" She looked at him quizzically. "By the merest chance. I'm
tremendously interested in disarmament, and when I heard that it
was her life-work &mdash;well&mdash;of course, I was pleased to
have as many talks with her as possible."</p>

<p>So she had had many talks, so many that she had thought that
he, Pointer, would have been told about them. Pointer glanced at
her, she stared back at him with that impenetrable stare of hers.
A "Have you ever met an old gentleman in her room, with a cleft
palate?" he asked.</p>

<p>With what he thought was genuine indifference, Miss Longstaff
said that she had seen him once or twice through the glass side
of the lounge, but had never spoken to him. Mrs. Findlay seemed
to be afraid that he would be captured, she added dryly, and kept
her door as good as locked whenever he was expected. Her eyes
were on him all the time, he was sure that in some way his
interest in Mrs. Findlay intensely interested this girl. Whether
it did more, whether it disquieted her, even Pointer could not
say.</p>

<p>"I understand that you borrowed a book from Mrs. Findlay," he
went on, "how are you going to return it, if you don't know her
address?"</p>

<p>"I suppose she'll write me about it, or it'll have to stand as
a sort of farewell offering," Alfreda said flippantly. "Useful
book, too. A thesaurus."</p>

<p>"Do you know if she had ever lent it before?" he asked.</p>

<p>She frowned, as though intrigued by this interest in the
volume.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, this man you've asked me about, the old
man with the cleft palate, had just borrowed it and brought it
back. May I ask why?"</p>

<p>"Was there any kind of bookmark in it?" Pointer asked.
"Frankly, Miss Longstaff, I consider that detail, though it
sounds trifling, quite important."</p>

<p>"I like your 'frankly'," she murmured, eyeing him with eyes
that almost glittered. "Bookmark...there were quite a lot of
scraps of paper in it. Marking places II suppose. I think they're
most of them still in it." She stretched out a hand and picked up
a well-worn looking volume from a shelf that formed part of what
looked like a Tudor dresser&mdash;in the manageress's
opinion&mdash;and fluttered it. Nothing fell out. "Sorry, I must
have lost them one by one."</p>

<p>"Could you tell' me if they were plain, or colored?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I don't think I ever noticed." A silence
fell.</p>

<p>"Did you have that book with you at The Tall House?" he asked.
She said that she had. Pointer knew as much.</p>

<p>"Anywhere where people could open it and read it&mdash;or lose
the bookmarks?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew why possible bits of paper interest you! But I
had it lying out in my room for days, and I left it downstairs in
the little Chinese room we used as a sitting-room more than
once."</p>

<p>"Why?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>She adjusted her skirt over her knees with care. "Just
chance," she replied, then she looked up at him. "Frankly, just
chance," she said, and smiled.</p>

<p>Pointer took his leave. Had that piece of wall-paper been
among the 'scraps' in the book which she had borrowed? If so, it
confused the issue instead of helping to clear it up.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER 20</h2>

<p class="first">IT did not take the chief inspector long to find
out from the land registry that a Mrs. Findlay owned the freehold
of a small cottage in Buckinghamshire near Hotspur. Its name was
Cloud Cottage, and though it was on an A.A. Throughway, it was
quite secluded. Lying in a sudden little dip you had almost to
step on it before you saw it, and then its encircling hedge,
which looked much older than the little building, screened it but
for its one chimney. Pointer circled it in his car and then made
for the police station. He had his bag with him, and in a few
minutes a tall, lean, elderly man who would have looked like a
jobbing gardener even without the spade and fork over his
shoulder, hobbled along the road which led past the cottage. His
drooping mustache, his eyes, the very slant of his shoulders,
suggested one of those traveling pessimists whose worst
prophesies as to the flowers they plant usually come true.
Leaning on the garden gate, he had a leisurely look at the
cottage. Four rooms, he guessed, which was one too many,
well-thatched and neatly painted, with a trim garden. It looked the
retreat of someone whose means were ample for its small upkeep.
The diamond panes glittered, the curtains and gay chintz behind
them were spotless.</p>

<p>Pointer made his way to the back. He stepped very lightly. He
did not knock on the kitchen door but opened it without a sound
by means of a curious tool he took from his pocket, not one
usually carried by gardeners.</p>

<p>Should Mrs. Findlay, contrary to his belief, be inside, he
would touch his forehead and mention that he had knocked for five
minutes before trying the back door and finding it open. She was
not in, and he was able to walk quickly, but carefully, over the
charming interior. But dead flowers smelled from the jugs of old
pottery and a dirty hand towel hung on the washstand in the
bathroom. The bed was badly made. So badly that Pointer would
have supposed that the owner of this cottage could not have made
it, and yet...or was it that she was in some great preoccupation
of mind?</p>

<p>He left everything as he had found it, and locked the kitchen
door behind him, before, spade and fork on shoulder, he plodded
off for the village shops. At the nearest one he stopped. Could
they tell him where he could find a Mrs. Findlay? As he hoped,
being closest to her, that lady dealt here. But Mrs. Findlay, he
was told, had stopped living at the cottage some days ago. The
woman gave the date. It was the day of Ingram's murder. Mrs.
Findlay herself had told the boy that she would want nothing more
for some time, as she was going traveling. She often ran down
still, but not to stop&mdash;and not to order things in.</p>

<p>The jobbing gardener scratched his long dark hair which was
thickly flecked with gray, with a workworn earthy forefinger.</p>

<p>"Yet she arranged with me to come and fork over her garden,"
he said in the patient tones of one used to employers'
vagaries.</p>

<p>"Bit early for that," the shop woman suggested.</p>

<p>Pointer agreed that it was, but he rather thought she was
going to make a lawn, and in that case, if you wanted the ground
to be properly drained, and settle well...</p>

<p>"I suppose the pay will be all right?" he wound up
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Anything she ordered she'll pay for," the shop woman said
confidently. "Pays to the minute always. But Ronnie here says she
told him she wouldn't be back for close on a year maybe."</p>

<p>"What about a little old gent who was with her when she gave
me my orders to fork up the back garden?" Pointer asked.
"Long-haired little gent, funny way of talking...I works for a man
in Ilford where she ordered some bulbs as wants to be put in
soon..." he added, to explain his own unfamiliar face.</p>

<p>"I seed a little old gent come in the day she left," the boy
put in. "Drove her down."</p>

<p>"Ah, but did you see her leave?" Pointer asked. "I can't think
she'd place an order for bulbs and for her whole garden to be dug
over and then just go away and leave it. Doesn't seem natural. I
don't believe she's gone away yet. For a day or two perhaps, but
not really left."</p>

<p>"I saw her driving off with all her luggage myself," the shop
woman put in, "but as I say, she's been back since. But only just
in and out, as you might say, with her car. Not living down
here."</p>

<p>"Might be another lady," the gardener said doubtfully.</p>

<p>The woman was amused. "Who else wears a silver star, and has
side curls like my granny used to wear?"</p>

<p>"Well, she never said nothing at the shop about leaving."
Pointer seemed irresolute but finally said that as his master had
sent him down to do the work he supposed he had better do it. He
asked the boy to come along and, show him the way to the cottage,
he wasn't sure he mightn't miss it.</p>

<p>The lad carried his fork and spade for him since the gardener
seemed to have a stiff knee. They chatted about the cottage as
they walked slowly along. Pointer seemed most interested in
learning what he could of the one time when the boy had seen the
little old gentleman arrive.</p>

<p>At the cottage the two walked round to the back Pointer seemed
to see it for the first time.</p>

<p>"Looks to me as though she had had someone working here
already," he said sourly. But he had never been more alert. This
garden in this secluded spot&mdash;Nevern seen to arrive, not
seen to leave...He went on: "Something's been moved here. Yuss,
something's been turned about t'other way too. I don't know what,
for I never seed the garden afore, but you did ought to know what
it is, son. What d'ye think yer eyes be for? Something in this
yere garden's been moved. Now just you tell me what?" and the
gardener filled a briar with shag and began to smoke, hanging his
coat on the hedge and rolling up his sleeves from sinewy arms
burned black&mdash;apparently&mdash;with years of sun and wind.
His heart was beating a little faster than usual. Would his guess
prove right?</p>

<p>The boy stood with knitted brows studying the scene
intently.</p>

<p>"That there shed!" he announced triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Pointer said equably, and yet as one pleased with a
pupil, "and where was it afore?"</p>

<p>"Over in that corner!" The young voice almost squeaked now.
"That's right! And where it now stands was a pit for manure,
chicken manure, she gets it from our chickens. That's it, and
Mrs. Findlay has cleared it out, filled it up, and put the shed
over it. The old gent and she must have worked hard. She never
has no one to help her with her garden."</p>

<p>"Ah, I knowed something had been moved," Pointer said, nodding
his head sagely. "When did you last see it in the corner? It's no
good raking over ground for at least a fortnight what's had a
shed stood over it. Needs that time to air, or ye digs in the
sour top-soil."</p>

<p>"When I delivered here larst, it stood in its old place," was
all the boy could tell him, and that, it seemed, was about a week
ago&mdash;just before Ingram's murder, Pointer finally made
out.</p>

<p>"Well, here's a penny, son, and thank ye," and the gardener
began in a leisurely way to light his pipe until the boy could no
longer see him, which meant only until he had closed the gate,
for the little path turned so abruptly in joining the road that
the cottage was out of sight in a minute. Then the gardener had a
look at the tool shed. It was locked, but what interested him
most was that it was on a four-wheeled truck base.</p>

<p>Around the bottom ran some wire netting as though to keep rats
out from the ground immediately below it.</p>

<p>It was this very ground that interested the chief inspector,
once he had noticed that the shed had been recently shifted.
Below the shed his flashlight showed him black soil, evidently
sub-soil. He bent up the wire netting for half a foot or so all
around and with a vigorous shove moved the shed a couple of feet
farther on. All the time he kept his eye out for the big outline
of Mrs. Findlay appearing round the corner of the cottage,
wearing her hat with its floating veil, silver star and dangling
ear curls. Of one thing he felt fairly sure and that was that it
would never again be accompanied by the little old gentleman who
talked as though he had a cleft palate.</p>

<p>On the whole, he thought it very unlikely that she would be
back here again. Though you never knew...if she remembered that
she had not left the cottage in what Pointer felt sure was its
usual order...</p>

<p>He dug down with the spade, for a trial had shown him that
earth, such as was now on top of this little patch of roughly
seven by four feet, could be found two spades deep in the rest of
the garden.</p>

<p>At his third attempt he felt the spade come against something.
He moved it half a foot along the length of the patch and again
felt something below. Very swiftly and carefully now, scooping
with his hands, he burrowed until he came on something, until he
cleared a coat sleeve...a hand...and finally, working with
extreme care, a dead face. So he was right. And the murder of
Ingram and the body lying under the shed were linked.</p>

<p>Miss Longstaff was walking slowly along Hammersmith High
Street thinking of Gilmour. Suddenly she was roused from her
reverie. A woman had come out of a shop farther down, stepped
into a passing bus, and been whirled away. It was Mrs. Findlay.
Her throat was evidently worse, for she held a fur stole well
across her mouth. But the silver star shone as gaily, the silvery
ringlets nodded as briskly as ever. It was a chemist's shop from
which she had come. Miss Longstaff recognized the name over the
door as one which her sharp eyes had seen on several bottles of
throat medicine in Mrs. Findlay's room. She stepped in.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Findlay was in here just now, wasn't she? I've just
missed her. And I particularly want to see her. I suppose she's
ordered something for her throat to be sent down to her at her
cottage? If you'll give me the address, I can take it along with
me. I'm going down that way."</p>

<p>Alfreda Longstaff had one asset. She looked thoroughly
respectable. The shop man did not doubt her. After a little delay
he handed her a bottle and the address, which she tucked into her
purse. Then she too caught a bus and arrived at Paddington
Station just as a train was due to leave for Hotspur. Her luck
was in, she decided, and settled down in a corner of an empty
compartment to think over the questions she would put to Mrs.
Findlay. She walked up from the station. Cloud Cottage seemed to
be deserted, but she rang the bell. There was no answer. She
waited, uncertain what to do. Mrs. Findlay had ordered the
medicine to be sent her by post so as to reach her that night. So
she must be going to run down...After a long wait a car could be
heard. It was an open little two-seater, Mrs. Findlay at the
wheel. Alfreda walked to the gate to meet it.</p>

<p>"Don't scold me for having found out your little retreat. I
shan't bother you but this once, and I've brought your throat
medicine along with me. May I come in and have a short talk with
you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Findlay stood quite still, not even looking at Alfreda,
after the one swift recognizing glance. She tapped the ground
with her umbrella. Then she nodded, pointed to her throat, and to
the fur still around her mouth and nose, walked with her majestic
stride up to the door, unlocked it, and motioned to Alfreda to
pass in. In the hall she took her to a room on the right, and
whispered that she would be down in a minute, as soon as she had
gargled. She did indeed come down within five minutes or so. She
had not taken off her outside things, nor her hat, or put aside
her fur stole which she still held in the same way across her
mouth...</p>

<p>"And now, what is it, Miss Longstaff?" she whispered over its
top, seating herself and motioning her visitor to take a chair
opposite her, facing the light.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Findlay, I want so much to ask you a question. What do
you know of Lawrence Gilmour? I asked you once before, but
please, please be frank with me."</p>

<p>"Never heard of him," the reply came instantly, and with
convincing firmness. "Who is he?"</p>

<p>"He is the man who shot Mr. Charles Ingram&mdash;by
mistake&mdash;as he maintains. I've been rather against him...and
I wondered whether...but perhaps you know him under another name?
This is what he looks like. Mrs. Findlay had not even drawn off
her gloves. She scrutinized the picture very carefully, but
finally shook her head.</p>

<p>"Never saw him. But I have heard the name before! Oh, not from
you or the papers! One day in the tube, I heard one man nudge his
companion, and say rather eagerly, 'That's Lawrence
Gilmour&mdash;that man there with the girl. Let's try him again.
He won't refuse when he's got a skirt with him.' I didn't look to
see what man or girl was meant, but on that occasion I did hear
the name."</p>

<p>"When was this?" Alfreda asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Findlay thought back. "I think it was when I was on my
way to the first of the Universal Sisterhood and Brotherhood
addresses...that would make it&mdash;" and she named the date
when Alfreda had first seen her in the lift and thought that it
was because of her that Gilmour had backed out so hurriedly.</p>

<p>"That's all I know," Mrs. Findlay said, adjusting her glasses
with her thumb, a trick of hers. "Sorry. Very sorry that you've
had your journey down here for nothing. I'd offer you tea, but I
don't think you ought to stop. My throat trouble is rather
catching&mdash;and very painful to me, even to whisper."</p>

<p>That it was catching Alfreda, had learned from the chemist who
had had a look at Mrs. Findlay's throat in the beginning. But
that did not worry Alfreda when bent on getting information.</p>

<p>"Look here," she said impulsively, "I'm sorry to stay even
another minute. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>This time Mrs. Findlay rose. "It's too painful," she murmured,
her hand to her throat. It was all of a keeping with Mrs.
Findlay's grim unfriendly character. Alfreda thanked her, excused
herself, and closed the front door behind herself after the
briefest of leave-takings. So it was all a mistake. And she had
wasted a good many very dull hours on a will-o'-the-wisp. Halfway
down to the station a sudden thought struck her. How on earth had
Mrs. Findlay known her real name? And known it without any
questioning or remarks as to why she had gone under the name of
Gray. She must be in closer touch with her old rooms than she,
Alfreda, had been allowed to guess. Why this deceit on the part
of manageress and maids? She walked back. She would ask Mrs.
Findlay herself? She might never have another chance of a word
with the woman. The bell-push gave no results. It was evidently
out of order. There was no knocker. Alfreda thought of rapping,
and then decided that in all probability Mrs. Findlay would still
be in the room looking into the garden where she had left her.
The French window had been at once opened by the lady,
incidentally throwing a still clearer light on Alfreda's face.
She went to it now, intending to tap and call to Mrs. Findlay.
She was on grass. The afternoon sun was shining into the room she
had just left, shining on the overmantel&mdash;a tall, old-fashioned
mirror.</p>

<p>In front of this, standing close against it, Mrs. Findlay was
now staring at her own reflection with close scrutiny.</p>

<p>For a second Alfreda stopped where she was. It would be a
trifle awkward to surprise the lady taking such an evident
interest in her looks. Mrs. Findlay would step away in a moment,
Alfreda would wait a short interval, and then walk up and knock
on a pane.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Findlay now dropped her fur stole, and seemed
suddenly to cease to be Mrs. Findlay...she smiled at herself in
the glass, and with the smile she became someone else...but who?
Who? The figure in front of her with the hat with its flowing
veil, put her hands to her ringlets, patted them into position,
laughing at herself the while. Alfreda stood rooted to the spot.
Down went her handbag with a jingle of coppers at her feet. In a
flash the figure staring at itself in the mirror had wheeled. For
one awful second the two stood face to face, then there was a
leap, Alfreda was seized and lifted within the room. She was
flung with fearful strength against the farther wall, while the
glass doors were shut and latched and the blinds snatched down,
then the figure turned again, and Alfreda knew that if she was to
leave the room alive, she would have to fight for her life, and
knew, too, that she had no more chance of escaping than has a
mouse under the paw of the cat. That grasp, that fling, that
awful glare in the eyes staring at her had told her as much.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER 21</h2>

<p class="first">ALFREDA tried to swing a chair up, but it was
knocked from her grasp. As it fell with a crash, something the
crashed too&mdash;the French window. The linen blind was torn
aside. A rock struck full on her assailant, who fell away and
slowly lurched to her knees. Alfreda did not wait for further
miracles. Again she swung the chair up, and, however clumsily
this time, brought it down full on the swaying figure. The next
moment it was taken from her.</p>

<p>"You're safe now! Steady on&mdash;he's down!" came a well
known voice as a hand was laid on her arm. But Alfreda's blood
was up. She twisted herself free.</p>

<p>"Of course he is! That's why I'm going to hit him!" She spoke
with passion, and Chief Inspector Pointer had to fairly shove her
aside with his elbow, while he bent down over the hat and veil
and lifted them off, showing a head of beautifully parted gray
hair, and with little ring curls all around and long corkscrews
over each ear. He felt the skull.</p>

<p>"Nothing broken," he murmured with inward relief. He had flung
that rock with more of a swing than he would have done had not
the circumstances been a bit pressing. Magistrates have a
preference for undamaged prisoners, and Pointer himself was very
sharp with his own men as to any rough handling of their
captives.</p>

<p>"I'll put these on him," he clicked handcuffs around the neat
lace cuffs and the man's hands protruding from them.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what&mdash;" came thickly from beneath the
matronly hair, in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>"Lawrence Gilmour, I arrest you for the murder of Mr. Charles
Ingram and of Mrs. Mary Findlay&mdash;" followed swiftly the
caution.</p>

<p>Gilmour said nothing now. He set his teeth and gave Alfreda
Longstaff a look that she never forgot, that would sometimes wake
her up bathed in cold perspiration of a night.</p>

<p>Alfreda said nothing in answer to it. Something in the grave,
stern, almost sad, face of the detective officer made her realize
the tremendous moment that this was...She, a living human being,
was looking at a man who might very soon be that no longer.</p>

<p>"You damned spy," he said now between his teeth. "Take your
ugly face out of my sight."</p>

<p>Pointer spoke sharply. "Mr. Gilmour, I think you had better
say nothing, unless you wish to make a statement to me."</p>

<p>"What motive do you intend to allege? Of course I'm innocent."
He caught the direction of the calm gray eyes that just for a
moment rested on the shed outside. Gilmour's face went white.
Again his eye fell on Alfreda. Again she shrank from the look of
it.</p>

<p>"What motive?" he snarled at the chief inspector.</p>

<p>"Crosswords," Pointer said briefly, and Gilmour after that
said no more. There was a sound behind them. A man in blue came
in. Pointer said a word to him and then took Alfreda into another
room. He made her sit down there, for she was trembling
violently. She was afraid that she was going to be sick.</p>

<p>"Badly frightened?" he asked.</p>

<p>He got the instant reaction that he knew would come.</p>

<p>"Not in the least. I'll telephone for you, if you like." But
she would have found it difficult to unhook the receiver. Pointer
took out a flat flask and unscrewed the cup. He filled it.</p>

<p>"It won't hurt you," he said. "I really advise it. I don't
doubt your pluck. But you were within an inch of death, Miss
Longstaff." Pointer had had to leave the cottage for a brief word
over the telephone to the Yard. The constable had misunderstood
Miss Longstaff's approach by the back, had thought her a friend
of the so-called Mrs. Findlay, and only Pointer's return and his
sight of the dropped handbag on the grass outside had saved
Alfreda. That handbag left there did not suggest a confederate to
his quick brain.</p>

<p>She swallowed the brandy obediently while he telephoned. Then
he turned to her. Even as he did so a car whizzed up. It was his
own men whom he had summoned from town just after first prodding
that place in the garden under the shed.</p>

<p>"Suppose we go back to town together in my car," he suggested,
and Alfreda was glad of the offer.</p>

<p>"Now tell me how you came to be down here, how you knew, after
all, where to come?"</p>

<p>She explained. "And where is Mrs. Findlay? The real Mrs.
Findlay?"</p>

<p>"Beneath that shed out in the garden we have just left,"
Pointer said truthfully. This was no nature that needed
shielding. "Gilmour, in the guise of an old man he assumed the
name of Nevern&mdash;became friendly with her, and murdered her.
Strangled her and buried her in her own garden."</p>

<p>"You spoke of crosswords. Do you mean she won a crossword
prize and he killed her just for that?" she asked in horror.</p>

<p>That was but a small part of Gilmour's intended haul, Pointer
could have told her. But he did not. That would all come out at
the trial.</p>

<p>"And why, why did he pretend to care for me?" she asked. "You
know, Mr. Pointer, that's what started all my suspicions." She
played with her gloves on her lap. "When he came down to our
village, I was very much impressed with him. I went for him,
they'll all tell you down there. I suppose I did." She spoke
judicially, quite objectively. "He stood to me for
opportunity&mdash;escape&mdash;and all that sort of thing. But he
flirted with me, and then dropped me. Then he came down again. I
was perfectly certain, as I say, that he was not in love with me,
I was sure of it. And I decided that two could play at that game
too. I would come to London and have a pleasant time while
looking around for work that would lead on to something, and then
I would drop Lawrence Gilmour just as he had dropped me. For, you
see, Mr. Pointer, I knew that he didn't care for me. I couldn't
think why on earth he should pretend to, but I did have sense
enough to know it was only a pretense. Why did he do it? With
that silly, beautiful Winnie Pratt willing to take him any
day?"</p>

<p>"Ah, she might be considered as a motive, Miss Longstaff. When
Gilmour shot Ingram, he wanted there to be no shadow of a
possible motive. I think he could have murdered Miss Pratt with
pleasure. She tried to spoil his shield of no earthly reason for
killing his friend. But please go on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There isn't anything to tell. I wish there was. When I met
Winnie Pratt I was more than ever puzzled. Some real game must be
on to make him pretend he cared for me with her at his elbow!
Then came the shooting of Ingram. Poor Mr. Ingram. I liked Mr.
Ingram," she said suddenly.</p>

<p>"So did everyone&mdash;but Gilmour," Pointer agreed.</p>

<p>"I had been up night after night listening, and waiting
about&mdash;always expecting to come across something that would
give me a clue to what the game was. I thought of Mrs. Pratt's
jewels..."</p>

<p>Pointer did not tell her every one was paste.</p>

<p>"I didn't know what to think...and the one night when
something really was on, I was asleep in bed! Worn out with being
up so much!" She gave her head a toss of self-disgust. "But I
knew it was a shot! Just because I was expecting something or
other...anyone else would have thought it a burst tire...but I
was too late to find out how it was done. Then I noticed the hole
in the sheet which never could have been made by a bullet through
Ingram's forehead if the sheet had hung down over his face, and I
got into touch with the <i>Daily Wire</i>. I passed on that piece
of news to their reporter."</p>

<p>She told how she had done this.</p>

<p>"I rushed down to the room Mr. Ingram used to write in, to see
if I could find anything there. Any clue...you always do in
books, you know."</p>

<p>"So you do in real life," Pointer could have said, but he only
nodded.</p>

<p>"That's all, I think. I've told you about why I followed Mrs.
Findlay and tried to get to know her...Then when Mr. Moy told me
about Gilmour having gone off to find the murderer I&mdash;for
the first time&mdash;weakened. I told myself I had been an
absolute idiot...especially when Mrs. Findlay, as I thought she
was, spoke as though she had never heard of Gilmour or seen his
face before. Oh, she&mdash;he&mdash;quite took me in just now!
But I knew he had stopped back at that lift door to avoid Mrs.
Findlay!"</p>

<p>"Half involuntarily, I think," Pointer said. He wanted to keep
her talking. It was the best way, in her case, to ease the shock
that she had had, he rightly thought. "She only knew him as
Nevern. But he probably also thought it just as well not to
obtrude himself, his real self, on her."</p>

<p>"I saw him once, I mean as Nevern. Through the glass window of
the lounge at the apartment house, and never recognized him! But
I only gave him half a glance, and he slouched so, and wore such
shabby clothes, and had a muffler around his neck and such a
battered old felt hat turned down all around his eyes...You
know," she went on at a half tangent, "I left the book I borrowed
from her lying about at The Tall House, open at her name on the
fly leaf, to see if it would catch his eye. But someone always
shut it. So I got tired of trying it."</p>

<p>"Had it lain before him he was probably too concerned with his
double murder to pay much attention to trifles," Pointer
suggested, as he went on out to complete his own
arrangements.</p>

<p>"She won't stay a reporter long," Pointer said to the
assistant commissioner. "I heard that they're going to make her a
very good offer to watch the case for them as it were...I think
Miss Longstaff is bound to go ahead in the newspaper world."</p>

<p>"I suppose they'll get her to write what it feels like to be
the fiance of a murderer. What it feels like to suspect one you
love..." Pelham spoke in a tone of disgust. He loathed the
<i>Daily Wire</i>. "Let's hope they'll get her to do one on 'What
it feels like to have the man you wanted to marry, hung,'" he
finished, and Pointer hoped that the opportunity might yet come
Miss Longstaff's way. It did, had she cared to use it.</p>

<p>"Did you suspect Gilmour from the first?" Pelham asked
curiously. He himself had been rather favorably impressed by that
astute young man.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if Gilmour's story was true and the second sheet
found was the right one, however intricate they might seem, the
other knotty points surrounding it would untie themselves, as
they always do if worked at. But if his story was not true, if he
intended to kill Ingram that night, why did he choose that way?
And why The Tall House? The locality and time might mean that he
wanted to confuse the hunt, if it had been an ordinary murder.
But he himself openly confessed to having killed Ingram&mdash;'by
a blunder' If he was guilty, why did he take this dangerous step?
He who would have, and had, such ample opportunities of getting
rid of him quietly."</p>

<p>"Yes, that affair on Scawfell at Easter seemed such a
certificate of good intentions," murmured Pelham. "Why not then,
Pointer? But I see the answer to that. The quarterly thirteen
puzzles weren't out then. Or didn't he know about them?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he knew about them until that accident, sir,
which took place just after the last lot had been sent off. I
shouldn't be surprised if it was while opening his clothes, to
feel if his heart were beating, that Gilmour came upon some paper
which made him suspect or learn what Ingram's secondary line was,
financially his most important line. Ingram's climbing plus fours
have just the same kind of a pocket made in them as have his
evening bags...yes, I think the prosecution can assume that then
and there he learned the facts which he&mdash;on
reflection&mdash;decided could be of such great use to
himself."</p>

<p>"But about your suspicions," Pelham harked back, "I want to
see them at work again."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," Pointer said, looking at his shoe tips as though
they were a diary which he was reading, "I could only say to
myself, that if Gilmour was guilty, then time must be all
important. That Ingram's death must be wanted to take place no
sooner and no later."</p>

<p>"Not during the Easter rock climb, nor during the snow
climbing planned far July," Pelham nodded. He saw the obviousness
of this.</p>

<p>"This idea fitted in with first the belief, then the knowledge
that Ingram had posted something for which I thought it likely
that he had had that inner secret pocket made. Something of great
importance, that meant. Shall I boil down the rest of my
laborious thinking, sir?" Pointer would never have made a good
lecturer, he was too afraid of boring people.</p>

<p>"Anything but!" His superior protested, "take me step by step
with you."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if Gilmour were guilty, it looked as though he,
too, would want to be free as quickly as possible after the
murder. I could think of no other reason for him to have taken
such a risky course as he did but one. Because Ingram's death was
not to have a long inquiry tacked on to it, which meant that no
question of murder was to be attached to it. As Gilmour planned
it, absolutely without a motive, it would look just what he said
it was, a horrible accident. And it would further give a man a
chance of disappearing utterly without arousing suspicion
afterwards. What more natural than that the poor chap who had had
such a misadventure should drop out of sight, go round the
world&mdash;and never return?"</p>

<p>"Did your&mdash;to me&mdash;inexplicable idea of
disappearances fit in here?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, sir, it did at once suggest that he must have some
other identity waiting for him into which to pass. And when he
disappeared 'to look for the criminal' as he put it, I thought I
could put the odds at ten to one on, his being the criminal
himself. Though I began to fear that he wouldn't be easy to come
up with. I had no motive yet...Of course as soon as I thought of
Ingram as a writer of crossword puzzles with big prizes,
obviously the character that Gilmour had turned into would win
one, and ultimately, all of them. I expected, first of all,
before making inquiries, that both the winners after Ingram's
murder would be incarnations of Mr. Gilmour. But they were seen
together. One had disappeared entirely after taking his prize
money, and the other had left her usual haunts but had been seen
about, a person whom I would have chosen myself in Gilmour's
position. A strange, unfriendly, solitary woman whose outline
would identify her, without a scrutiny of her features. Those
ringlets, that floating veil, that star...no one would look
closely under the big hat. And she had a sore throat...could
muffle up."</p>

<p>"Bit of luck that, for Gilmour."</p>

<p>"Assisted by Gilmour," Pointer said, "I suspect he put
something into her tea to make her throat sore. And be able to
drop in&mdash;after she was dead&mdash;at the chemist's for the
'same throat medicine as you put up for me before.'"</p>

<p>Pointer was right. Gilmour had done just that.</p>

<p>"Where was Gilmour supposed to be when he was murdering the
old lady?"</p>

<p>"With Miss Longstaff, sir. He constantly lately has taken days
off, out of his leave, on the plea of his fiance being up in
town, and of course has had it made easy for him to do."</p>

<p>"All the world loves a lover," quoted Major Pelham with
macabre relish.</p>

<p>"Her liking to have her mornings to herself suited him
excellently, of course," Pointer went on. "Just as she tells me
that he often excused himself after a bare half hour or even
less, on the plea of a colleague being down with the flu, and his
having promised to take his duty for him. As Nevern, he went down
to her cottage with Mrs. Findlay the morning of the day on which
Ingram was to be shot. Got her to send a message to a man she
often employed, a stupid sort of half idiot to move the tool shed
on the next morning to a place over the manure pit, and then
killed her. Buried her and left the idiot to hide the spot next
day with the shed, while he made up as Mrs. Findlay, went to
town, changing on the way into Gilmour."</p>

<p>"Busy bee," Pelham said with a shudder.</p>

<p>"And the dislike of Miss Pratt?" he asked. "Got that combed
out?"</p>

<p>Pointer had.</p>

<p>"Well, well! How hard is the path of crime," murmured Pelham.
"Fancy having to turn a stony eye and ear on the lovely Winnie,
and beam instead on the distinctly waspish Miss Longstaff. What
about Miss Pratt, by the way? Does she talk of committing
suicide?"</p>

<p>"Not unless you call marrying Mr. Haliburton that," Pointer
said. "She and her mother and Haliburton have all agreed that the
wedding is to take place at once and young Mrs. Haliburton will
be on her honeymoon to Greenland or Finland by the time the trial
comes off."</p>

<p>"Quite right," Pelham said. "She's much too lovely a butterfly
to pin up in a law court for everyone to stare at. Did she care
for the brute, do you think?"</p>

<p>Pointer thought that Mrs. Pratt was right, and that Winnie,
having met a man who was not bowled over by her looks, who
refused to be won by her blandishments, thought that she must,
indeed, have met a demi-god, a being not of mortal clay. The
shock of Gilmour's arrest had put quite another complexion on
things. She now agreed with her mother that Gilmour was not
"normal," and had allowed Haliburton to decide that there should
be no more shilly-shallying.</p>

<p>"I suppose that note Gilmour left..." pursued Pelham, who
liked to tie his bundles up with everything inside them, "was
just to spoof Moy?"</p>

<p>"Exactly, sir, and explain his non-appearance...You see,
things had gone so contrary that he couldn't just set off on a
trip round the world as he had planned. He was more than a little
afraid of us...Lord Bulstrode might reveal the real writer of the
crosswords...Gilmour decided that he had better go...and turn
into Nevern until he could become Mrs. Findlay. Once safely her,
he would have gone on that world trip, and duly sent in correct
solutions to the <i>Weekly Universe</i> as Miss Smith, Doctor
Brown, Mr. Jones, Mrs. Robinson, as need be; appear in a
different form each time and take the check..."</p>

<p>"Neat," Pelham said. "Pity is that these simple ways of
grabbing what doesn't belong to you, rarely work out according to
plan. Ingenious chap, I think, Pointer, though you don't seem to
like him. And perhaps he was a bit careless to drop that scrap of
wall paper. How did he come to have it in his dressing-gown
pocket?"</p>

<p>"I confess I can't say, though I could hazard a guess. But, by
good luck, a fragment of it stuck to the lining of the pocket, so
that even our searchers didn't spot it, yet it'll prove the link
between him and meek little Mr. Nevern."</p>

<p>"What do you guess?" Pelham asked promptly.</p>

<p>"From the way the paper has been screwed up, sir, I should say
that he wrapped a ring in it. He only wears one, a fine scarab.
My guess is that he forgot to take it off once when he was Mr.
Nevern, decided to be on the safe side and wrapped it in a scrap
of paper before dropping it in his pocket because of its very
shallow setting. It is just a little loose."</p>

<p>"But why put it in his dressing-gown pocket?" Pelham
persisted, "he hardly strolled across London wearing that when he
became Mr. Nevern, did he?"</p>

<p>"A scarab is supposed to bring luck," Pointer said. "It looks
to me as though he had put it in his dressing-gown when he
murdered Ingram for luck. And when he dropped the cartridge case,
picked up off the bedroom floor, in the passage, he must have
dropped the paper out too, tearing it as he scooped out the
cartridge case. He, or someone else, stepping on it, flattened it
out on the cream ground of the carpet, and never noticed it."</p>

<p>"Quite a neat little guess," Pelham said approvingly. Later
on, they both learned that it was the truth.</p>

<p>"By the way, what about the system?"</p>

<p>"I let Mr. Appleton have it, sir, or a copy of it. He's just
worked it with such success in Ostend and the Casino has offered
him three thousand a year for life to sell it to them. He's
accepted. What with what he's made before I stepped in, and this
nice little annuity, he feels quite comfortable about the future
and is going to have his operation with a tranquil mind next
month. Mrs. Appleton can't do enough to make up to him for her
terrible suspicion. As for Appleton, he really did suspect
Frederick Ingram&mdash;and a cipher motive."</p>

<p>"The trouble was Appleton always acted," Pelham said, "and
it's deuced difficult to spot when an actor's real, and when he's
playing a part. I'm glad that shark Tark won't get any of the
spoils."</p>

<p>So was Pointer. "I went so far as to explain to Mr. Haliburton
what I had happened to overhear once in Appleton's room abroad,"
he said gravely, quite undeterred by the grin of Pelham at the
word 'happened,' "and he's dropped Tark. Definitely. I think he
suspects that the ramming of his skiff may have just been part of
a plan to meet Ingram under unimpeachable auspices. Tark, of
course, is the type you meet in out-of-the-way places of the
world playing poker for his boots&mdash;or yours. He must have
been the one who hunted through the study before Miss Longstaff.
That was why he had to go on and wake the servants. She cut him
off from the main stairs. Tark has resource and a face of
granite."</p>

<p>"Why not say he has a face like Gilmour's 'heart," suggested
Pelham. "I suppose Gilmour put that second corrected sheet into
the linen hamper himself, and then waited for Moy to think of
looking there?"</p>

<p>"I think that's what happened, sir. That hole was a bad
blunder. He shot Ingram in his bed, to the best of my belief,
Ingram was an unusually heavy sleeper, we know. I think Gilmour
drew the sheet up over his face when he lay on his back fast
asleep, stood at the end of the bed, or the other side of the
room with his automatic fitted with a silencer, and shot him
dead, through the sheet and the center of the forehead. It was a
very small caliber automatic. There was practically no bleeding.
I fancy he would have changed slips had there been any stains. He
twisted the sheet around Ingram and dumped him on the floor just
outside his own door, then went to his room and fired out through
the bedroom window over the gardens after loading with six
blanks. So that the shot would rouse the household. He had
previously, on his way to his room, dropped the cartridge case
from Ingram's room on the carpet near his door. Along with that
scrap of wall paper.</p>

<p>"After firing&mdash;with his door open&mdash;he staggered
about in the passage and felt for the switch, put out of action
by himself, of course. And so on..."</p>

<p>"All that upholding of Ingram's suit of Miss Pratt was so much
eyewash, of course."</p>

<p>"I suppose every murderer who undertakes a premeditated crime
paints a picture, sir, and wants the investigators to take the
picture he has colored so skilfully for real life. It's just a
case of seeing through it, or as your book puts it, of 'seeping
through the cilia."'</p>

<p>Pelham nodded, pushing a box of cigars across to Pointer. "The
stance of the faithful friend, just so. He was a clever
chap."</p>

<p>"Well, he made two bad breaks, sir. The hole too near the edge
of the sheet, and then picking on Miss Longstaff to be his girl.
I suppose the latter was hardly his fault, rather his
misfortune," Pointer ruminated aloud. "When he found Miss Pratt
upsetting all his arrangements by trying so hard to fall in love
with him, he looked around for cover. He remembered how welcome
Miss Longstaff had found his company, how she had, to use her own
words, 'gone for him,' and thought that he would get engaged for
a short time to a little trusting country maid who would be
delighted to say yes, and never question his actions. Miss Longstaff
did. He overrated badly what he fondly believed was her
love for him, and underrated as badly her brains."</p>

<p>"Yours were the brains he underrated," Pelham said
affectionately, "as everyone does who thinks they can get the
better of you."</p>
