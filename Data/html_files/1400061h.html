  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro"></a><small>INTRODUCTION</small><br>
  BEFORE THE BRITISH CAME</h2>

  <p class="first">IT is unnecessary within the scope of this volume to do more
  than sketch the events which led to a condition of war between Great Britain,
  France, Russia, Belgium and Servia on the one part, and Germany and
  Austria-Hungary on the other.</p>

  <p>The assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his consort at
  Sarajevo, on July 25, was the ostensible reason for the presentation of the
  Austro- Hungarian note to Servia. This made demands upon Servia with which no
  self- governing state could comply, and was followed by military preparations
  in the dual kingdom.</p>

  <p>Russia, who saw in these demands an oblique challenge to her as guardian
  of the Slav peoples, at once began to move. But at the earnest request of Sir
  Edward Grey her military mobilization was delayed whilst efforts were made
  not only by Great Britain, but by France to induce the Government of Germany
  to exercise its undoubted influence to avert war between Servia and Austria-
  Hungary.</p>

  <p>Germany tacitly declined to second the efforts of Great Britain, and on
  July 30 a partial mobilization of the Russian Army was ordered, followed on
  the next day by a ukase commanding a general mobilization.</p>

  <p>Even now Great Britain did not give up hope of averting the calamity of a
  European war, though Germany had declared herself in a state of war. But on
  the following day all hope of peace was abandoned. Although the mobilization
  of the Russian Army was explicitly directed towards Austria-Hungary, who had
  opened her campaign against Servia by a bombardment of Belgrade, the German
  Government cast the torch into the world.</p>

  <p>On August 1 at 7.30 p.m. (Russian time) Germany declared war upon Russia,
  and German troops waiting on the frontier, gathered there in readiness,
  invaded the Neutral State of Luxemburg, and, seizing the railway, established
  the headquarters of the invading army in the capital. This was immediately
  followed by an ominous movement on the frontier of Belgium, the neutrality of
  which country was guaranteed by the Powers, including Great Britain, France
  and Germany.</p>

  <p>Great Britain addressed questions couched in identical terms to France and
  Germany. Would these powers respect the neutrality of Belgium?</p>

  <p>The reply of the French Government was prompt, and was in the affirmative.
  In the war of 1870, France had given a similar undertaking and had most
  honourably fulfilled her part, though by so doing she was compelled to fight
  the disastrous battle of Sedan.</p>

  <p>The German reply, however, was evasive. Great Britain repeated her
  question, and demanded, through her Ambassador, a reply by eleven o'clock
  that night (German time). This was on August 4, two days after Germany had
  called upon Belgium to allow the unhampered passage of her troops through
  that country&mdash;a demand which was rejected by the Belgian Government with
  little hesitation.</p>

  <p>On August 4 two German Army Corps, under General von Emmich, were already
  hammering at the door of Belgium, claiming admission. But the door was a
  particularly stout one, and Liège, splendidly commanded by General Leman,
  swept back the first attack without difficulty.</p>

  <p>On the 4th of August, whilst the guns thundered about Liège, the order
  went forth for the mobilization of the British Army, and there followed the
  quiet, orderly gathering of reservists all over Great Britain.</p>

  <p>On the 6th of August two of the Liège forts were silenced. The gallant
  commander&mdash;General Leman&mdash;was taken prisoner, having been found in
an
  unconscious state amidst the ruins of one of the forts he had so bravely
  defended.</p>

  <p>So terrible had been the havoc created by the Belgian artillery and
  infantry fire that the German commander asked for an armistice of twenty-four
  hours to bury his dead, a request which was refused.</p>

  <p>But the German had his foothold, and through the area which had previously
  been swept by the guns of the two forts which were now destroyed the main
  body of the covering army passed into the town of Liège, leaving the
  remainder of the forts intact.</p>

  <p>Heavy fighting between the Belgians and the invader now followed. French
  troops rushed northward, held Dinant and the country about, and there were
  fierce encounters between the traditional enemies who, further south, were
  already at grips in Alsace.</p>

  <p>Between the German occupation of Liège and the events which are chronicled
  in this book, much happened. There was prolonged and bitter outpost fighting
  between the Belgians and their invader, and after a siege of ten days the
  remaining forts of Liège were reduced by means of very heavy guns. Among them
  the 42-centimeter howitzer, specially constructed by Krupps, was employed
  with very deadly effect.</p>

  <p>The covering armies under von Emmich had been strongly reinforced, and it
  was now evident that the main attack upon France was to be expected from this
  quarter.</p>

  <p>It was not until the 16th of August that the first instalment of the
  Expeditionary Army of Great Britain completed its landing in France. That
  force was under the command of Field-Marshal Sir John French. It consisted of
  two Army Corps, the composition of which was not revealed. Sir John French
  hastened to Paris for a brief consultation with the French War Minister and
  his colleagues before leaving to make his dispositions for resisting the
  advance of the enemy from Belgium.</p>

  <p>Now threatened by the rapid advance of the main German Army, the Belgian
  Government transferred its seat from Brussels to Antwerp. On the 20th, the
  German Army entered Brussels, the civic guard having been disarmed by order
  of the burghomaster.</p>

  <p>Whilst the right wing of the Germans was in possession of the capital,
  other great armies were moving diagonally toward the French frontier. On the
  21st of August the French, who were holding a line of which the Belgian town
  of Charleroi was either the left or the left centre, came into touch with the
  enemy, and fierce fighting ensued.</p>

  <p>On the next day another German Army attacked Namur, which marked the right
  of the French position. Namur, which was expected to offer even a more
  determined resistance than Liège had done, was carried after two days'
  fighting.</p>

  <p>The French were beginning to fall back from Charleroi when, on August 22,
  the British came to their position at Mons, which lies directly to the left
  of where the French had been fighting. Only now did it become apparent to the
  defending line that the attack was being made in overwhelming strength. The
  battle of Charleroi was ended, our Ally was actually falling back, and Namur
  had been evacuated when the events which Sir John French describes began.</p>

  <h3>MONS&mdash;CAMBRAI&mdash;LE CATEAU</h3>

  <h3><big>THE FIRST DESPATCH</big></h3>

  <p class="cp">(<i>From Field-Marshal Sir John French</i>)</p><br>

  <p class="first">RECEIVED by the Secretary of State for War from the
  Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, British Forces in the Field&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="first"><i>September 7, 1914.</i></p>

  <p class="first">MY LORD,</p>

  <p>I have the honour to report the proceedings of the Field Force under my
  command up to the time of rendering this despatch.</p>

  <p>The transport of the troops from England both by sea and by rail was
  effected in the best order and without a check. Each unit arrived at its
  destination in this country well within the scheduled time.</p>

  <p>The concentration was practically complete on the evening of Friday, the
  21st ultimo, and I was able to make dispositions to move the Force during
  Saturday, the 22nd, to positions I considered most favourable from which to
  commence operations which the French Commander-in-Chief, General Joffre,
  requested me to undertake in pursuance of his plans in prosecution of the
  campaign.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* It will be remembered that Sir John French visited the
  French War Office in Paris before leaving for the front to take command of
  the British Expeditionary Force.]</p>

  <p>The line taken up extended along the line of the canal from Condé on the
  west, through Mons and Binche on the east. This line was taken up as
  follows&mdash;</p>

  <p>From Condé to Mons inclusive was assigned to the 2nd Corps, and to the
  right of the 2nd Corps from Mons the 1st Corps was posted. The 5th Cavalry
  Brigade was placed at Binche.</p>

  <p>In the absence of my 3rd Army Corps,* I desired to keep the Cavalry
  Division as much as possible as a reserve to act on my outer flank, or move
  in support of any threatened part of the line. The forward reconnaissance was
  entrusted to Brigadier-General Sir Philip Chetwode with the 5th Cavalry
  Brigade, but I directed General Allenby to send forward a few squadrons to
  assist in this work.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* One division (20,000 men) of the 3rd Corps came over
  in time to play a very worthy part in the fight at Le Cateau later. They got
  out of the train and went straight into battle, a fact which General French
  emphasizes later.]</p>

  <p>During August 22nd and 23rd these advanced squadrons did some excellent
  work, some of them penetrating as far as Soignies, and several encounters
  took place in which our troops showed to great advantage.</p>

  <p>At 6 a.m. on August 23 I assembled the Commanders of the 1st and 2nd Corps
  and Cavalry Division at a point close to the position, and explained the
  general situation of the Allies, and what I understood to be General Joffre's
  plan. I discussed with them at some length the immediate situation in front
  of us.</p>

  <p>From information I received from French Headquarters I understood that
  little more than one, or at most two, of the enemy's Army Corps, with perhaps
  one Cavalry Division, were in front of my position;* and I was aware of no
  attempted outflanking movement by the enemy. I was confirmed in this opinion
  by the fact that my patrols encountered no undue opposition in their
  reconnoitring operations. The observation of my aeroplanes seemed also to
  bear out this estimate.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* About this time the information as to German movements
  were very vague. We knew that they were massing on the right bank of the
  Meuse north of Liège, and that they were assembling before Namur. The
  appearance of the great army in and about Brussels was, however, reported
  many days before the 22nd, which makes the lack of information afforded to
  General French a little inexplicable.]</p>

  <p>About 3 p.m. on Sunday, the 23rd, reports began coming in to the effect
  that the enemy was commencing an attack on the Mons line, apparently in some
  strength, but that the right of the position from Mons and Bray was being
  particularly threatened.</p>

  <p>The Commander of the 1st Corps had pushed his flank back to some high
  ground south of Bray, and the 5th Cavalry Brigade evacuated Binche, moving
  slightly south; the enemy thereupon occupied Binche.</p>

  <p>The right of the 3rd Division, under General Hamilton, was at Mons, which
  formed a somewhat dangerous salient,* and I directed the Commander of the 2nd
  Corps to be careful not to keep the troops on this salient too long, but, if
  threatened seriously, to draw back the centre behind Mons. This was done
  before dark. In the meantime, about 5 p.m., I received a most unexpected
  message from General Joffre by telegraph, telling me that at least three
  German Corps, viz. a reserve corps, the 4th Corps and the 9th Corps, were
  moving on my position in front, and that the 2nd Corps was engaged in a
  turning movement from the direction of Tournay. He also informed me that the
  two reserve French divisions and the 5th French Army on my right were
  retiring,&dagger; the Germans having on the previous day gained possession of
  the passages of the Sambre between Charleroi and Namur.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* A salient is a position projecting outward at an
  angle, and consequently assailable from two sides. Forces holding such a
  position may easily be surrounded or cut off from the main body.]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[&dagger; What few people realize is that in their
  retreat from Mons and Condé the British were largely on their own. They saw
  nothing of the French on their right save Territorial troops, and did not
  know of the desperate fighting round Charleroi. Indeed, very few of the
  British force ever saw a French soldier after the fighting began until the
  27th of August.]</p>

  <p>In view of the possibility of my being driven from the Mons position, I
  had previously ordered a position in the rear to be reconnoitred. This
  position rested on the fortress of Maubeuge on the right and extended west to
  Jenlain, south-east of Valenciennes, on the left. The position was reported
  difficult to hold, because standing crops and buildings made the siting of
  trenches very difficult and limited the field of fire in many important
  localities. It nevertheless afforded a few good artillery positions.</p>

  <p>When the news of the retirement of the French and the heavy German
  threatening on my front reached me, I endeavoured to confirm it by aeroplane
  reconnaissance; and as a result of this I determined to effect a retirement
  to the Maubeuge position at daybreak on the 24th.</p>

  <p>A certain amount of fighting continued along the whole line throughout the
  night, and at daybreak on the 24th the 2nd Division from the neighbourhood of
  Harmignies made a powerful demonstration as if to retake Binche. This was
  supported by the artillery of both the 1st and 2nd Divisions, whilst the 1st
  Division took up a supporting position in the neighbourhood of Peissant.
  Under cover of this demonstration the 2nd Corps retired on the line
  Dour-Quarouble-Frameries. The 3rd Division on the right of the Corps
  suffered considerable loss in this operation from the enemy, who had retaken
  Mons.</p>

  <p>The 2nd Corps halted on this line, where they partially entrenched
  themselves, enabling Sir Douglas Haig with the 1st Corps gradually to
  withdraw to the new position; and he effected this without much further loss,
  reaching the line Bavai-Maubeuge about 7 p.m. Towards midday the enemy
  appeared to be directing his principal effort against our left.</p>

  <p>I had previously ordered General Allenby with the Cavalry to act
  vigorously in advance of my left front and endeavour to take the pressure
  off.</p>

  <p>About 7.30 a.m. General Allenby received a message from Sir Francis
  Fergusson, commanding 5th Division, saying that he was very hard pressed and
  in urgent need of support. On receipt of this message General Allenby drew in
  the Cavalry and endeavoured to bring direct support to the 5th Division.</p>

  <p>During the course of this operation General De Lisle, of the 2nd Cavalry
  Brigade, thought he saw a good opportunity to paralyse the further advance of
  the enemy's infantry by making a mounted attack on his flank. He formed up
  and advanced for this purpose, but was held up by wire* about 500 yards from
  his objective, and the 9th Lancers and 18th Hussars suffered severely in the
  retirement of the Brigade.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Barbed wire entanglements may be hastily but none the
  less effectively constructed for the protection of infantry and artillery
  from Cavalry attack. This protection might be given more easily in such a
  country as that through which the British were fighting, by the fact that
  there may have been a great deal of "natural wire" (i.e. wire fences fixed by
  farmers to mark boundaries, etc.).]</p>

  <p>The 19th Infantry Brigade, which had been guarding the Line of
  Communications, was brought up by rail to Valenciennes on the 22nd and 23rd.
  On the morning of the 24th they were moved out to a position south of
  Quarouble to support the left flank of the 2nd Corps.</p>

  <p>With the assistance of the Cavalry Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien was enabled to
  effect his retreat to a new position; although, having two corps of the enemy
  on his front and one threatening his flank, he suffered great losses in doing
  so.</p>

  <p>At nightfall the position was occupied by the 2nd Corps to the west of
  Bavai, the 1st Corps to the right. The right was protected by the fortress of
  Maubeuge, the left by the 19th Brigade in position between Jenlain and Bry,
  and the Cavalry on the outer flank.</p>

  <p>The French were still retiring, and I had no support except such as was
  afforded by the fortress of Maubeuge; and the determined attempts of the
  enemy to get round my left flank assured me that it was his intention to hem
  me against that place and surround me. I felt that not a moment must be lost
  in retiring to another position.</p>

  <p>I had every reason to believe that the enemy's forces were somewhat
  exhausted, and I knew that they had suffered heavy losses. I hoped therefore
  that his pursuit would not be too vigorous to prevent me effecting my
  object.</p>

  <p>The operation, however, was full of danger and difficulty, not only owing
  to the very superior force in my front, but also to the exhaustion of the
  troops.</p>

  <p>The retirement was recommenced in the early morning of August 25 to a
  position in the neighbourhood of Le Cateau, and rearguards were ordered to be
  clear of the Maubeuge-Bavai-Eth Road by 5.30 a.m.</p>

  <p>Two Cavalry Brigades, with the Divisional Cavalry of the 2nd Corps,
  covered the movement of the 2nd Corps. The remainder of the Cavalry Division,
  with the 19th Brigade, the whole under the command of General Allenby,
  covered the west flank.</p>

  <p>The 4th Division commenced its detrainment at Le Cateau on Sunday, the
  23rd, and by the morning of the 25th eleven battalions and a Brigade of
  Artillery with Divisional Staff were available for service.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* This Division had only left Cambridge on the Saturday
  morning (22nd), and had come through punctually without stopping. It is
  believed that the transportation of the 4th Division through England and the
  very proper reticence and secrecy shown in the dispatch of this force, gave
  rise to the extraordinary rumour that a strong Russian force was passing over
  our railways. It was after the dispatch of the 4th Division that this rumour
  began to gain ground.]</p>

  <p>I ordered General Snow to move out to take up a position with his right
  south of Solesmes, his left resting on the Cambrai-Le Cateau Road south of La
  Chaprie. In this position the Division rendered great help to the effective
  retirement of the 2nd and 1st Corps to the new position.</p>

  <p>Although the troops had been ordered to occupy the Cambrai-Le Cateau-
  Landrecies position, and the ground had, during the 25th, been partially
  prepared and entrenched, I had grave doubts&mdash;owing to the information I
  received as to the accumulating strength of the enemy against me&mdash;as to
the
  wisdom of standing there to fight.</p>

  <p>Having regard to the continued retirement of the French on my right, my
  exposed left flank, the tendency of the enemy's western corps (II) to envelop
  me, and, more than all, the exhausted condition of the troops, I determined
  to make a great effort to continue the retreat till I could put some
  substantial obstacle, such as the Somme or the Oise, between my troops and
  the enemy, and afford the former some opportunity of rest and reorganization.
  Orders were, therefore, sent to the Corps Commanders to continue their
  retreat as soon as they possibly could towards the general line Vermand-St.
  Quentin-Ribemont.</p>

  <p>The Cavalry, under General Allenby, were ordered to cover the
  retirement.</p>

  <p>Throughout the 25th and far into the evening the 1st Corps continued its
  march on Landrecies, following the road along the eastern border of the
  Forfit de Mormal, and arrived at Landrecies about ten o'clock. I had intended
  that the Corps should come further west so as to fill up the gap between Le
  Cateau and Landrecies, but the men were exhausted and could not get further
  in without rest.</p>

  <p>The enemy, however, would not allow them this rest, and about 9.30 p.m. a
  report was received that the 4th Guards Brigade in Landrecies was heavily
  attacked by troops of the 9th German Army Corps who were coming through the
  forest on the north of the town. This brigade fought most gallantly and
  caused the enemy to suffer tremendous loss in issuing from the forest into
  the narrow streets of the town. This loss has been estimated from reliable
  sources at from 700 to 1000. At the same time information reached me from Sir
  Douglas Haig that his 1st Division was also heavily engaged south and east of
  Maroilles. I sent urgent messages to the Commander of the two French Reserve
  Divisions on my right to come up to the assistance of the 1st Corps, which
  they eventually did. Partly owing to this assistance, but mainly to the
  skilful manner in which Sir Douglas Haig extricated his Corps from an
  exceptionally difficult position in the darkness of the night, they were able
  at dawn to resume their march south towards Wassigny on Guise.</p>

  <p>By about 6 p.m. the 2nd Corps had got into position with their right on Le
  Cateau, their left in the neighbourhood of Caudry, and the line of defence
  was continued thence by the 4th Division towards Seranvillers, the left being
  thrown back.</p>

  <p>During the fighting on the 24th and 25th the Cavalry became a good deal
  scattered, but by the early morning of the 26th General Allenby had succeeded
  in concentrating two brigades to the south of Cambrai.</p>

  <p>The 4th Division was placed under the orders of the General Officer
  Commanding the 2nd Army Corps.</p>

  <p>On the 24th the French Cavalry Corps, consisting of three divisions, under
  General Sordfit, had been in billets north of Avesnes. On my way back from
  Bavai, which was my "Poste de Commandement" during the fighting of the 23rd
  and 24th, I visited General Sordfit, and earnestly requested his co-operation
  and support.* He promised to obtain sanction from his Army Commander to act
  on my left flank, but said that his horses were too tired to move before the
  next day. Although he rendered me valuable assistance later on in the course
  of the retirement, he was unable for the reasons given to afford me any
  support on the most critical day of all, viz. the 26th.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* No account of the retirement has as yet been published
  by the French War Office, so that it is impossible to say tinder what
  circumstances General Sordfit's Division had been rendered temporarily
  ineffective. The French had been very heavily engaged on the British
  right&mdash;the part played by the cavalry in that engagement is yet to be
made
  known. At the end of the war, when the full French reports are published,
  this failure of the French cavalry will probably admit of remarkable
  explanation.]</p>

  <p>At daybreak on August 26 it became apparent that the enemy was throwing
  the bulk of his strength against the left of the position occupied by the 2nd
  Corps and the 4th Division.</p>

  <p>At this time the guns of four German Army Corps were in position against
  them, and Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien reported to me that he judged it
  impossible to continue his retirement at daybreak (as ordered) in face of
  such an attack.</p>

  <p>I sent him orders to use his utmost endeavours to break off the action and
  retire at the earliest possible moment, as it was impossible for me to send
  him any support, the 1st Corps being at the moment incapable of movement.</p>

  <p>The French Cavalry Corps, under General Sordfit, was coming up on our left
  rear early in the morning, and I sent an urgent message to him to do his
  utmost to come up and support the retirement of my left flank; but owing to
  the fatigue of his horses he found himself unable to intervene in any
  way.</p>

  <p>There had been no time to entrench the position properly, but the troops
  showed a magnificent front to the terrible fire which confronted them.</p>

  <p>The Artillery, although outmatched by at least four to one, made a
  splendid fight, and inflicted heavy losses on their opponents.</p>

  <p>At length it became apparent that, if complete annihilation was to be
  avoided, a retirement must be attempted; and the order was given to commence
  it about 3.30 p.m. The movement was covered with the most devoted intrepidity
  and determination by the Artillery, which had itself suffered heavily, and
  the fine work done by the Cavalry in the further retreat from the position
  assisted materially in the final completion of this most difficult and
  dangerous operation.</p>

  <p>Fortunately the enemy had himself suffered too heavily to engage in an
  energetic pursuit.</p>

  <p>I cannot close the brief account of this glorious stand of the British
  troops without putting on record my deep appreciation of the valuable
  services rendered by General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien.</p>

  <p>I say without hesitation that the saving of the left wing of the Army
  under my command on the morning of the 26th August could never have been
  accomplished unless a commander of rare and unusual coolness, intrepidity,
  and determination had been present to personally conduct the operation.</p>

  <p>The retreat was continued far into the night of the 26th and through the
  27th and 28th, on which date the troops halted on the line Noyon-Chauny-La
  Fère, having then thrown off the weight of the enemy's pursuit.</p>

  <p>On the 27th and 28th I was much indebted to General Sordfit and the French
  Cavalry Division which he commands for materially assisting my retirement and
  successfully driving back some of the enemy on Cambrai.</p>

  <p>General D'Amade also, with the 61st and 62nd French Reserve Divisions,
  moved down from the neighbourhood of Arras on the enemy's right flank and
  took much pressure off the rear of the British Forces.</p>

  <p>This closes the period covering the heavy fighting which commenced at Mons
  on Sunday afternoon, August 23, and which really constituted a four days'
  battle.</p>

  <p>At this point, therefore, I propose to close the present despatch.</p>

  <p>I deeply deplore the very serious losses which the British Forces have
  suffered in this great battle; but they were inevitable in view of the fact
  that the British Army&mdash;only two days after a concentration by
rail&mdash;was
  called upon to withstand a vigorous attack of five German Army Corps.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Roughly about 250,000 men. General French at this time
  had two Army Corps, a Cavalry Division and the 4th Division of eleven
  battalions and an artillery brigade, in all about 98,000 men. Smith-Dorrien's
  force of 50,000-60,000 men had at one time four German Corps arrayed against
  him.]</p>

  <p>It is impossible for me to speak too highly of the skill evinced by the

  <p>I wish particularly to bring to your Lordship's notice the admirable work
  done by the Royal Flying Corps under Sir David Henderson.* Their skill,
  energy, and perseverance have been beyond all praise. They have furnished me
  with the most complete and accurate information which has been of
  incalculable value in the conduct of the operations. Fired at constantly both
  by friend and foe, and not hesitating to fly in every kind of weather, they
  have remained undaunted throughout.</p>

  <p>In such operations as I have described the work of the

  <h2><a id="ch1-2"
     name="ch1-2"></a>HOW THE BRITISH FOUGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">WHILST the British were thus engaged, the French on their
  right were being driven into French Lorraine, and the German forces left to
  contain the Belgian Army were carrying out their work of destruction.</p>

  <p>On the day that Sir John French was fighting so desperately before Le
  Cateau-Cambrai, the Germans, on the pretext of punishing the shooting of
  some of their soldiers by the civilian population, had set to work to destroy
  Louvain, a Zeppelin had dropped bombs on Antwerp, and the great battle before
  Lemberg had begun in Galicia. These facts are given that the reader may
  assemble in their chronological order the events of that fateful week. There
  can be no doubt but that the position of the British Army was critical. If
  the arrival of the 4th Division had been delayed for two hours the Army Corps
  under Smith-Dorrien could hardly have extricated itself without suffering
  enormous losses, if indeed it could have got away at all. The fighting was of
  a peculiarly fierce character, but pressed as they were the British were a
  terribly punishing force. Their fire, well directed, was never wasted. The
  men nursed their ammunition and "shot for heads."* The story is told by one
  officer that he had all his work cut out to get one section to retire, and
  there can be no doubt that the losses we sustained in the shape of missing
  and prisoners taken by the enemy was due largely to the courage of our men,
  who stuck to their work of beating back the Kaiser's corps.</p>

  <p>The German soldiers themselves directed the whole of their resources to
  outflanking their British opponents.</p>

  <p>An Imperial order had gone forth to the German forces directing them</p>

  <p class="quote">"to devote the whole of your attention to the treacherous
  English and to walk over General French's contemptible little army."</p>

  <p>The task was no light one, in whatever spirit of confidence the German
  legions came. They sustained enormous losses in the face of the British rifle
  fire, which has won the admiration of the Allies.</p>

  <p>Cool as though on parade or firing at Ash ranges, the infantry were
  offered excellent practice at between 500 and 600 yards. This is the range at
  which the British army has invariably shown its highest percentage of hits,
  and the German losses before Cambrai and Le Cateau must have been very heavy,
  for the rifle used by our men is the best weapon in the field.</p>

  <p>Even in their success the Germans were again and again repulsed.</p>

  <p>"They came on in solid formation," writes one officer, "shoulder to
  shoulder, the most confident body of men that ever marched on to a battle-
  field. Some of them had unsmoked cigars stuck between the buttons of their
  tunics ... it looked as if nothing could arrest that heavy mass, but after a
  sighting shot or two our men got the range and then you saw things happen. In
  three minutes from being a solid body it became a ragged, straggling line,
  then it peeled away to nothing. Behind was another double company, and the
  same thing happened all over again. It was extraordinary to see them skipping
  and jumping over the bodies of their fallen comrades only to fall themselves
  and become a further obstacle to the men behind."</p>

  <p>This was the British punch, a staggering one, but numbers told in the long
  run. Swiftly moving columns began to work round the British left, and the
  order to retire came none too soon. Field-Marshal French was himself under
  fire most of this day.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch1-3"
     name="ch1-3"></a>THE INTERREGNUM</h2>

  <h3>DESCRIBED BY "EYE-WITNESS" ON THE STAFF OF SIR JOHN FRENCH</h3>

  <p class="note">[<i>In the internal of the Field-Marshal's personal
  despatches "Eye-Witness" sent home official reports from time to
  time.</i>]</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT is now possible to make another general survey of the
  operations of the British Army during the last week.</p>

  <p>No new main trial of strength has taken place. There have indeed been
  battles in various parts of the immense front which, in other wars, would
  have been considered operations of the first magnitude; but, in this war,
  they are merely the incidents of the strategic withdrawal and contraction of
  the allied forces necessitated by the initial shock on the frontiers and in
  Belgium, and by the enormous strength which the Germans have thrown into the
  western theatre, while suffering heavily through weakness in the eastern.</p>

  <p>The British Expeditionary Army has conformed to the general movement of
  the French forces and acted in harmony with the strategic conceptions of the
  French General Staff.</p>

  <p>Since the battle at Cambrai on August 26, where the British troops
  successfully guarded the left flank of the whole line of French Armies from a
  deadly turning attack supported by enormous force, the 7th French Army* has
  come into operation on our left, and this, in conjunction with the 5th Army
  on our right, has greatly taken the strain and pressure off our men.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* This was the territorial corps under General
  Armande.]</p>

  <p>The 5th French Army in particular on August 29 advanced from the line of
  the Oise River to meet and counter the German forward movement, and a
  considerable battle developed to the south of Guise. In this the 5th French
  Army gained a marked and solid success, driving back with heavy loss and in
  disorder three German Army Corps, the 10th, the Guard, and a reserve corps.
  It is believed that the Commander of the 10th German Corps was among those
  killed.</p>

  <p>In spite of this success, however, and all the benefits which flowed from
  it, the general retirement to the south continued and the German armies,
  seeking persistently after the British troops, remained in practically
  continuous contact with our rearguards.</p>

  <p>On August 30 and 31 the British covering and delaying troops were
  frequently engaged, and on September 1 a very vigorous effort was made by the
  Germans, which brought about a sharp action in the neighbourhood of
  Compiègne.</p>

  <p>This action was fought principally by the 1st British Cavalry Brigade and
  the 4th Guards Brigade and was entirely satisfactory to the British.</p>

  <p>The German attack, which was most strongly pressed, was not brought to a
  standstill until much slaughter had been inflicted upon them and until 10
  German guns had been captured. The brunt of this creditable affair fell upon
  our Guards Brigade, who lost in killed and wounded about 300 men.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* This was the first decisive check administered to the
  advancing enemy. Some of the finest troops in the German Army were engaged
  and the little battle occurred in thickly wooded country.]</p>

  <p>After this engagement our troops were no longer molested. Wednesday,
  September 2, was the first quiet day they had had since the battle of Mons on
  August 23. During the whole of this period marching and fighting had been
  continuous, and in the whole period the British casualties had amounted,
  according to the latest estimates, to about 15,000 officers and men.</p>

  <p>The fighting, having been in open order upon a wide front with repeated
  retirements, has led to a large number of officers and men and even small
  parties missing their way and getting separated, and it is known that a very
  considerable number of those now included in the total will rejoin the
  colours safely.</p>

  <p>These losses, though heavy in so small a force, have in no wise affected
  the spirit of the troops. They do not amount to a third of the losses
  inflicted by the British force upon the enemy, and the sacrifice required of
  the Army has not been out of proportion to its military achievements.</p>

  <p>In all, drafts amounting to 19,000 men have reached our Army or are
  approaching them on the line of communication, and advantage is being taken
  of the five quiet days that have passed since the action of September 1 to
  fill up the gaps and refit and consolidate the units.</p>

  <p>The British Army is now south of the Marne, and is in line with the French
  forces on the right and left. The latest information about the enemy is that
  they are neglecting Paris and are marching in a south-easterly direction
  towards the Marne and towards the left and centre of the French line.</p>

  <p>The 1st German Army is reported to be between La Ferté-sous-Jouarre and
  Essises-Viffort. The 2nd German Army, after taking Reims, has advanced to
  Chateau-Thierry and to the east of that place. The 4th German Army is
  reported to be marching south on the west of the Argonne, between Suippes and
  Ville sur Tourbe. All these points were reached by the Germans on September
  3.</p>

  <p>The 7th German Army has been repulsed by a French Corps near D'Einville.
  It would, therefore, appear that the enveloping movement upon the
  Anglo-French left flank has been abandoned by the Germans, either because it
  is no longer practicable to continue such a great extension or because the
  alternative of a direct attack upon the allied line is preferred. Whether
  this change of plan by the Germans is voluntary or whether it has been
  enforced upon them by the strategic situation and the great strength of the
  Allied Armies in their front will be revealed by the course of events.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The line of the Marne was now held by the French in
  great strength, and the converging German Armies found themselves opposed to
  forces vastly superior in point of strength and freshness to those which had
  been engaged to them previously.]</p>

  <p>There is no doubt whatever that our men have established a personal
  ascendancy over the Germans, and that they are conscious of the fact that
  with anything like even numbers the result would not be doubtful.</p>

  <p>The shooting of the German infantry is poor, while the British rifle fire
  has devastated every column of attack that has presented itself. Their
  superior training and intelligence has enabled the British to use open
  formations with effect, and thus to cope with the vast numbers employed by
  the enemy. The cavalry, who have had even more opportunities for displaying
  personal prowess and address, have definitely established their
  superiority.</p>

  <p>Sir John French's reports dwell on this marked superiority of the British
  troops of every arm of the service over the Germans. "The cavalry," he says,
  "do as they like with the enemy until they are confronted by thrice their
  numbers. The German patrols simply fly before our horsemen. The German troops
  will not face our infantry fire, and as regards our artillery they have never
  been opposed by less than three or four times their numbers."</p>

  <p>The following incidents have been mentioned&mdash;</p>

  <p>During the action at Le Cateau on August 26 the whole of the officers and
  men of one of the British batteries had been killed or wounded with the
  exception of one subaltern and two gunners. These continued to serve one gun,
  kept up a sound rate of fire, and came unhurt from the battlefield.</p>

  <p>On another occasion a portion of a supply column was cut off by a
  detachment of German cavalry and the officer in charge was summoned to
  surrender. He refused, and starting his motors off at full speed dashed
  safely through, losing only two lorries.</p>

  <p>It is noted that during the rearguard action of the Guards Brigade on
  September 1 the Germans were seen giving assistance to our wounded.</p>

  <p>The weather has been very hot with an almost tropical sun, which has made
  the long marches trying to the soldiers.* In spite of this they look well and
  hearty, and the horses, in consequence of the amount of hay and oats in the
  fields, are in excellent condition.</p>

  <p>In short it may be said that the war so far as it has advanced has given
  most promising opportunities of adding to the reputation of the British arms
  and of achieving notable and substantial successes; but we must have more men
  so as to operate on a scale proportionate to the strength and power of the
  Empire.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* For the first time in its history the British Army was
  fighting without either ceremonial head-dress or wearing the tropical helmet
  which is usually so indispensable a part of the British soldier's equipment.
  The army fought and is still fighting in its caps, and in the hot weather to
  which the despatch refers these were supplemented by a piece of khaki cloth
  hanging from the back of the cap and designed to protect the nape of the
  neck.]</p>

  <h3>PARIS&mdash;THE MARNE&mdash;THE AISNE</h3>

  <h3><big>THE SECOND DESPATCH</big></h3>

  <p class="first"><i>September 17, 1914.</i></p>

  <p class="first">MY LORD,</p>

  <p>In continuation of my despatch of September 7, I have the honour to report
  the further progress of the operations of the forces under my command from
  August 28.</p>

  <p>On that evening the retirement of the force was followed closely by two of
  the enemy's cavalry columns, moving south-east from St. Quentin.</p>

  <p>The retreat in this part of the field was being covered by the 3rd and 5th
  Cavalry Brigades. South of the Somme General Gough, with the 3rd Cavalry
  Brigade, threw back the Uhlans of the Guard with considerable loss.</p>

  <p>General Chetwode, with the 5th Cavalry Brigade, encountered the eastern
  column near Cerizy, moving south. The Brigade attacked and routed the column,
  the leading German regiment suffering very severe casualties and being almost
  broken up.</p>

  <p>The 7th French Army Corps was now in course of being railed up from the
  south to the east of Amiens. On the 29th it nearly completed its detrainment,
  and the French 6th Army got into position on my left, its right resting on
  Roye.</p>

  <p>The 5th French Army was behind the line of the Oise between La Fère and
  Guise.</p>

  <p>The pursuit of the enemy was very vigorous; some five or six German corps
  were on the Somme, facing the 5th Army on the Oise. At least two corps were
  advancing towards my front, and were crossing the Somme east and west of Ham.
  Three or four more German corps were opposing the 6th French Army on my
  left.</p>

  <p>This was the situation at one o'clock on the 29th, when I received a visit
  from General Joffre at my headquarters.</p>

  <p>I strongly represented my position to the French Commander-in-Chief, who
  was most kind, cordial, and sympathetic, as he has always been. He told me
  that he had directed the 5th French Army on the Oise to move forward and
  attack the Germans on the Somme, with a view to checking pursuit. He also
  told me of the formation of the 6th French Army on my left flank, composed of
  the 7th Army Corps, four reserve divisions, and Sordfit's corps of
  cavalry.</p>

  <p>I finally arranged with General Joffre to effect a further short
  retirement towards the line Compiègne-Soissons, promising him, however, to do
  my utmost to keep always within a day's march of him.</p>

  <p>In pursuance of this arrangement the British forces retired to a position
  a few miles north of the line Compiègne-Soissons on the 29th.</p>

  <p>The right flank of the German Army was now reaching a point which appeared
  seriously to endanger my line of communications with Havre. I had already
  evacuated Amiens, into which place a German reserve division was reported to
  have moved.</p>

  <p>Orders were given to change the base to St. Nazaire, and establish an
  advance base at Le Mans. This operation was well carried out by the
  Inspector-General of Communications.</p>

  <p>In spite of a severe defeat inflicted upon the Guard 10th and Guard
  Reserve Corps of the German Army by the 1st and 3rd French Corps on the right
  of the 5th Army, it was not part of General Joffre's plan to pursue this
  advantage, and a general retirement on to the line of the Marne was ordered,
  to which the French forces in the more eastern theatre were directed to
  conform.</p>

  <p>A new army (the 9th) has been formed from three corps in the south by
  General Joffre, and moved into the space between the right of the 5th and
  left of the 4th Armies.</p>

  <p>Whilst closely adhering to his strategic conception to draw the enemy on
  at all points until a favourable situation was created from which to assume
  the offensive, General Joffre found it necessary to modify from day to day
  the methods by which he sought to attain this object, owing to the
  development of the enemy's plans and changes in the general situation.</p>

  <p>In conformity with the movements of the French forces, my retirement
  continued practically from day to day. Although we were not severely pressed
  by the enemy, rearguard actions took place continually.</p>

  <p>On September 1, when retiring from the thickly wooded country to the south
  of Compiègne, the 1st Cavalry Brigade was overtaken by some German cavalry.
  They momentarily lost a horse artillery battery, and several officers and men
  were killed and wounded. With the help, however, of some detachments from the
  3rd Corps operating on their left, they not only recovered their own guns,
  but succeeded in capturing twelve of the enemy's.</p>

  <p>Similarly, to the eastward, the 1st Corps, retiring south, also got into
  some very difficult forest country, and a somewhat severe rearguard action
  ensued at Villers-Cotterets, in which the 4th Guards Brigade suffered
  considerably.</p>

  <p>On September 3 the British forces were in position south of the Marne
  between Lagny and Signy-Signets. Up to this time I had been requested by
  General Joffre to defend the passages of the river as long as possible, and
  to blow up the bridges in my front. After I had made the necessary
  dispositions, and the destruction of the bridges had been effected, I was
  asked by the French Commander-in-Chief to continue my retirement to a point
  some twelve miles in rear of the position I then occupied, with a view to
  taking up a second position behind the Seine. This retirement was duly
  carried out. In the meantime the enemy had thrown bridges and crossed the
  Marne in considerable force, and was threatening the Allies all along the
  line of the British forces and the 5th and 9th French Armies. Consequently
  several small outpost actions took place.</p>

  <p>On Saturday, September 5, I met the French Commander-in-Chief at his
  request, and he informed me of his intention to take the offensive forthwith,
  as he considered conditions were very favourable to success.</p>

  <p>General Joffre announced to me his intention of wheeling up the left flank
  of the 6th Army, pivoting on the Marne, and directing it to move on the
  Ourcq; cross and attack the flank of the 1st German Army, which was then
  moving in a south-easterly direction east of that river.</p>

  <p>He requested me to effect a change of front to my right&mdash;my left
resting
  on the Marne and my right on the 5th Army&mdash;to fill the gap between that
army
  and the 6th. I was then to advance against the enemy in my front and join in
  the general offensive movement.</p>

  <p>These combined movements practically commenced on Sunday, September 6, at
  sunrise; and on that day it may be said that a great battle opened on a front
  extending from Ermenonville, which was just in front of the left flank of the
  6th French Army, through Lizy on the Marne, Mauperthuis, which was about the
  British centre, Courtecon, which was the left of the 5th French Army, to
  Estemay and Charleville, the left of the 9th Army under General Foch, and so
  along the front of the 9th, 4th, and 3rd French Armies to a point north of
  the fortress of Verdun.</p>

  <p>This battle, in so far as the 6th French Army, the British Army, the 5th
  French Army, and the 9th French Army were concerned, may be said to have
  concluded on the evening of September 10, by which time the Germans had been
  driven back to the line Soissons-Reims, with a loss of thousands of
  prisoners, many guns, and enormous masses of transport.</p>

  <p>About September 3 the enemy appears to have changed his plans and to have
  determined to stop his advance south direct upon Paris, for on September 4
  air reconnaissances showed that his main columns were moving in a
  south-easterly direction generally east of a line drawn through Nanteuil and
  Lizy on the Ourcq.</p>

  <p>On September 5 several of these columns were observed to have crossed the
  Marne; whilst German troops, which were observed moving south-east up the
  left bank of the Ourcq on the 4th, were now reported to be halted and facing
  that river. Heads of the enemy's columns were seen crossing at Changis, La
  Ferté, Nogent, Chateau-Thierry, and Mezy.</p>

  <p>Considerable German columns of all arms were seen to be converging on
  Montmirail, whilst before sunset large bivouacs of the enemy were located in
  the neighbourhood of Coulommiers, south of Rebais, La Ferté-Gaucher and
  Dagny.</p>

  <p>I should conceive it to have been about noon on September 6, after the
  British forces had changed their front to the right and occupied the line
  Jouy-le Chatel-Faremoutiers-Villeneuve le Comte, and the advance of the 6th
  French Army north of the Marne towards the Ourcq became apparent, that the
  enemy realized the powerful threat that was being made against the flank of
  his columns moving south-east, and began the great retreat which opened the
  battle above referred to.</p>

  <p>On the evening of September 6, therefore, the fronts and positions of the
  opposing armies were, roughly, as follows&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">ALLIES.</p>

  <p class="quote">6th French Army.&mdash;Right on the Marne at Meux, left
towards
  Betz.<br>
  British Forces.&mdash;On the line Dagny-Coulommiers-Maison.<br>
  5th French Army.&mdash;At Courtagon, right on Estemay.<br>
  Conneau's Cavalry Corps.&mdash;Between the right of the British and the left
of
  the French 5th Army.</p>

  <p class="quote">GERMANS.</p>

  <p class="quote">4th Reserve and 2nd Corps.&mdash;East of the Ourcq and facing
  that river.<br>
  9th Cavalry Division.&mdash;West of Crecy.<br>
  2nd Cavalry Division.&mdash;North of Coulommiers.<br>
  4th Corps.&mdash;Rebais.<br>
  3rd and 7th Corps.&mdash;South-west of Montmirail.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p>All these troops constituted the 1st German Army, which was directed
  against the French 6th Army on the Ourcq, and the British forces, and the
  left of the 5th French Army south of the Marne.</p>

  <p>The 2nd German Army (IX, X, X.R. and Guard) was moving against the centre
  and right of the 5th French Army and the 9th French Army.</p>

  <p>On September 7 both the 5th and 6th French Armies were heavily engaged on
  our flank. The 2nd and 4th Reserve German Corps on the Ourcq vigorously
  opposed the advance of the French towards that river, but did not prevent the
  6th Army from gaining some headway, the Germans themselves suffering serious
  losses. The French 5th Army threw the enemy back to the line of the Petit
  Morin River, after inflicting severe losses upon them, especially about
  Montceaux, which was carried at the point of the bayonet.</p>

  <p>The enemy retreated before our advance, covered by his 2nd and 9th and
  Guard Cavalry Divisions, which suffered severely.</p>

  <p>Our cavalry acted with great vigour, especially General De Lisle's
  Brigade, with the 9th Lancers and 18th Hussars.</p>

  <p>On September 8 the enemy continued his retreat northward, and our army was
  successfully engaged during the day with strong rearguards of all arms on the
  Petit Morin River, thereby materially assisting the progress of the French
  Armies on our right and left, against whom the enemy was making his greatest
  efforts. On both sides the enemy was thrown back with heavy loss. The First
  Army Corps encountered stubborn resistance at La Trétoire (north of Rebais).
  The enemy occupied a strong position with infantry and guns on the northern
  bank of the Petit Morin River; they were dislodged with considerable loss.
  Several machine guns and many prisoners were captured, and upwards of 200
  German dead were left on the ground.</p>

  <p>The forcing of the Petit Morin at this point was much assisted by the
  cavalry and the 1st Division, which crossed higher up the stream.</p>

  <p>Later in the day a counter-attack by the enemy was well repulsed by the
  1st Army Corps, a great many prisoners and some guns again falling into our
  hands.</p>

  <p>On this day (September 8) the 2nd Army Corps encountered considerable
  opposition, but drove back the enemy at all points with great loss, making
  considerable captures.</p>

  <p>The 3rd Army Corps also drove back considerable bodies of the enemy's
  infantry and made some captures.</p>

  <p>On September 9 the 1st and 2nd Army Corps forced the passage of the Marne
  and advanced some miles to the north of it. The 3rd Corps encountered
  considerable opposition, as the bridge at La Ferté was destroyed and the
  enemy held the town on the opposite bank in some strength, and thence
  persistently obstructed the construction of a bridge; so the passage was not
  effected until after nightfall.</p>

  <p>During the day's pursuit the enemy suffered heavy loss in killed and
  wounded, some hundreds of prisoners fell into our hands, and a battery of
  eight machine guns was captured by the 2nd Division.</p>

  <p>On this day the 6th French Army was heavily engaged west of the River
  Ourcq. The enemy had largely increased his force opposing them, and very
  heavy fighting ensued, in which the French were successful throughout.</p>

  <p>The left of the 5th French Army reached the neighbourhood of
  Chateau-Thierry after the most severe fighting, having driven the enemy
  completely north of the river with great loss.</p>

  <p>The fighting of this army in the neighbourhood of Montmirail was very
  severe.</p>

  <p>The advance was resumed at daybreak on the 10th up to the line of the
  Ourcq, opposed by strong rearguards of all arms. The 1st and 2nd Corps,
  assisted by the Cavalry Division on the right, the 3rd and 5th Cavalry
  Brigades on the left, drove the enemy northwards. Thirteen guns, seven
  machine guns, about 2000 prisoners, and quantities of transport fell into our
  hands. The enemy left many dead on the field. On this day the French 5th and
  6th Armies had little opposition.</p>

  <p>As the 1st and 2nd German Armies were now in full retreat, this evening
  marks the end of the battle which practically commenced on the morning of the
  6th instant, and it is at this point in the operations that I am concluding
  the present despatch.</p>

  <p>Although I deeply regret to have had to report heavy losses in killed and
  wounded throughout these operations, I do not think they have been excessive
  in view of the magnitude of the great fight, the outlines of which I have
  only been able very briefly to describe, and the demoralization and loss in
  killed and wounded which are known to have been caused to the enemy by the
  vigour and severity of the pursuit.</p>

  <p>In concluding this despatch I must call your lordship's special attention
  to the fact that from Sunday, August 23, up to the present date (September
  17), from Mons back almost to the Seine, and from the Seine to the Aisne, the
  Army under my command has been ceaselessly engaged without one single day's
  halt or rest of any kind.</p>

  <p>Since the date to which in this despatch I have limited my report of the
  operations, a great battle on the Aisne has been proceeding. A full report of
  this battle will be made in an early further despatch.</p>

  <p>It will, however, be of interest to say here that, in spite of a very
  determined resistance on the part of the enemy, who is holding in strength
  and great tenacity a position peculiarly favourable to defence, the battle
  which commenced on the evening of the 12th inst. has, so far, forced the
  enemy back from his first position, secured the passage of the river, and
  inflicted great loss upon him, including the capture of over 2000 prisoners
  and several guns.</p>

  <p>I have the honour to be,</p>

  <p>Your Lordship's most obedient Servant, (Signed) J.D.P. French, Field-
  Marshal,</p>

  <p>Commander-in-Chief,</p>

  <p>British Forces in the Field.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-2"
     name="ch2-2"></a>INCIDENTS OF THE PERIOD<br>
  COVERED BY THE SECOND DESPATCH</h2>

  <h3>BY "EYE-WITNESS" ON THE STAFF OF SIR JOHN FRENCH</h3>

  <p class="first">ON Friday, September 4, it became apparent that there was an
  alteration in the direction of advance of almost the whole of the 1st German
  Army. That Army since the battle near Mons on August 23 had been playing its
  part in the colossal strategic endeavour to create a Sedan for the Allies by
  outflanking and enveloping the left of their whole line so as to encircle and
  drive both British and French to the south.</p>

  <p>There was now a change in its objective; and it was observed that the
  German forces opposite the British were beginning to move in a southeasterly
  direction instead of continuing southwest on to the Capital.</p>

  <p>Leaving a strong rearguard along the line of the River Ourcq (which flows
  south and joins the Marne at Lizy-sur-Ourcq) to keep off the French 6th Army,
  which by then had been formed and was to the north-west of Paris, they were
  evidently executing what amounted to a flank march diagonally across our
  front. Prepared to ignore the British, as being driven out of the fight, they
  were initiating an effort to attack the left flank of the French main army
  which stretched in a long curved line from our right towards the east, and so
  to carry out against it alone the envelopment which had so far failed against
  the combined forces of the Allies.</p>

  <p>On Saturday, the 5th, this movement on the part of the Germans was
  continued, and large advanced parties crossed the Marne southwards at
  Trilport, Sammeroy. La Ferté-sous-Jouarre and Chateau-Thierry. There was
  considerable fighting with the French 5th Army on the French left, which fell
  back from its position south of the Marne towards the Seine. On Sunday large
  hostile forces crossed the Marne, and pushed on through Coulommiers past the
  British right. Further east they were attacked at night by the French 5th
  Army, which captured three villages at the point of the bayonet.</p>

  <p>An earlier despatch from headquarters gave the following particulars,
  which are amplified in the above account.</p>

  <p>On September 6 the southward advance of the German right reached its
  extreme points at Coulommiers and Provins, cavalry patrols having penetrated
  even as far south as Nogent-sur-Seine. This movement was covered by a large
  flanking force west of the line of the River Ourcq, watching the outer Paris
  defences and any Allied force that might issue from them. The southward
  movement of the enemy left his right wing in a dangerous position, as he had
  evacuated the Creil-Senlis-Compiègne region through which his advance had
  been pushed.</p>

  <p>The Allies attacked this exposed wing both in front and flank on September
  8. The covering force was assailed by a French Army based upon the Paris
  defences, and brought to action on the line Nanteuil-le Haudouin-Meaux. The
  main portion of the enemy's right wing was attacked frontally by the British
  Army, which had been transferred from the North to the East of Paris, and by
  French Corps advancing alongside of it on the line
  Crécy-Coulommiers-Sézanne.</p>

  <p>The combined operations have up to the present been completely successful.
  The German outer flank was forced back as far as the line of the Ourcq. There
  it made a strong defence, and executed several vigorous counter-attacks, but
  was unable to beat off the pressure of the French advance. The main body of
  the enemy's right wing vainly endeavoured to defend the line of the Grand
  Morin River, and then that of the Petit Morin.</p>

  <p>Pressed back over both of these rivers and threatened on its right owing
  to the defeat of the covering force by the Allied left, the German right wing
  retreated over the Marne on September 10. The British Army, with a portion of
  the French forces on its left, crossed this river below Chateau-Thierry, a
  movement which obliged the enemy's forces west of the Ourcq, already assailed
  by the French corps forming the extreme left of the Allies, to give way and
  to retreat north-eastwards in the direction of Soissons.</p>

  <p>Since the 10th the whole of the German right wing has fallen back in
  considerable disorder, closely followed by the French and British troops. Six
  thousand prisoners and fifteen guns were captured on the 10th and 11th, and
  the enemy is reported to be continuing his retirement rapidly over the Aisne,
  evacuating the Soissons region. The British cavalry is reported to-day to be
  at Fismes, not far from Reims.</p>

  <p>While the German right wing has thus been driven back and thrown into
  disorder, the French armies further to the east have been strongly engaged
  with the German centre, which had pushed forward as far as Vitry. Between the
  8th and 10th our Allies were unable to make much impression west of
  Vitry.</p>

  <p>On the 11th, however, this portion of the German Army began to give way,
  and eventually abandoned Vitry, where the enemy's line of battle was forming
  a salient under the impulse of French troops between the upper Marne and the
  Meuse. The French troops are following up the enemy and are driving portion
  of his forces northwards towards the Argonne forest country.</p>

  <p>The 3rd French Army reports to-day that it has captured the entire
  artillery of a hostile army corps&mdash;a capture which probably represents
about
  160 guns. The enemy is thus in retreat along the whole line west of the Meuse
  and has suffered gravely in moral, besides encountering heavy losses in
  personnel and material.</p>

  <p>On Monday, September 7, there was a general advance on the part of the
  Allies in this quarter of the field. Our forces, which had by now been
  reinforced, pushed on in a northeasterly direction, in co-operation with an
  advance of the French 5th Army to the north and of the French 6th Army
  eastwards, against the German rearguard along the Ourcq.</p>

  <p>Possibly weakened by the detachment of troops to the eastern theatre of
  operations, and realizing that the action of the French 6th Army against the
  line of the Ourcq and the advance of the British placed their own flanking
  movement in considerable danger of being taken in rear and on its right
  flank, the Germans on this day commenced to retire towards the north-east.
  This was the first time that these troops had turned back since their attack
  at Mons a fortnight before, and, from reports received, the order to retreat
  when so close to Paris was a bitter disappointment. From letters found on the
  dead there is no doubt that there was a general impression amongst the
  enemy's troops that they were about to enter Paris.</p>

  <p>On Tuesday, September 8th, the German movement north-eastwards was
  continued, their rearguards on the south of the Marne being pressed back to
  that river by our troops and by the French on our right, the latter capturing
  three villages after a hand-to-hand fight and the infliction of severe loss
  on the enemy.</p>

  <p>The fighting along the Ourcq continued on this day and was of the most
  sanguinary character, for the Germans had massed a great force of artillery
  along this line. Very few of their infantry were seen by the French. The
  French 5th Army also made a fierce attack on the Germans in Montmirail,
  regaining that place.</p>

  <p>On Wednesday, the 9th, the battle between the French 6th Army and what was
  now the German flank guard along the Ourcq continued. The British Corps,
  overcoming some resistance on the River Petit Morin, crossed the Marne in
  pursuit of the Germans, who were now hastily retreating northwards. One of
  our corps was delayed by an obstinate defence made by a strong rearguard with
  machine guns at La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, where the bridge had been
  destroyed.</p>

  <p>On Thursday, September 10, the French 6th Army continued its pressure on
  the west while the 5th Army, by forced marches, reached the line
  Chateau-Thierry-Dormans on the Marne. Our troops also continued the pursuit
  on the north of the latter river, and after a considerable amount of fighting
  captured some 1500 prisoners, four guns, six machine guns, and 50 transport
  wagons.</p>

  <p>Many of the enemy were killed and wounded, and the numerous thick woods
  which dot the country north of the Marne are filled with German stragglers.
  Most of them appear to have been without food for at least two days. Indeed,
  in this area of operations the Germans seem to be demoralized and inclined to
  surrender in small parties, and the general situation appears to be most
  favourable to the Allies.</p>

  <p>Much brutal and senseless damage has been done in the villages occupied by
  the enemy. Property has been wantonly destroyed, pictures in the chateaux
  have been ripped up, and the houses generally pillaged. It is stated on
  unimpeachable authority, also, that the inhabitants have been much
  ill-treated.</p>

  <p>Interesting incidents have occurred during the fighting. On the 10th part
  of our 2nd Army Corps advancing north found itself marching parallel with
  another infantry force at some little distance away. At first it was thought
  that this was another British unit. After some time, however, it was
  discovered that it was a body of Germans retreating. Measures were promptly
  taken to head off the enemy, who were surrounded and trapped in a sunken
  road, where over 400 men surrendered.</p>

  <p>On the 10th a small party of French under a non-commissioned officer was
  cut off and surrounded. After a desperate resistance it was decided to go on
  fighting to the end. Finally the N.C.O. and one man only were left, both
  being wounded. The Germans came up and shouted to them to lay down their
  arms. The German commander, however, signed to them to keep their arms, and
  asked for permission to shake hands with the wounded non-commissioned
  officer, who was carried off on his stretcher with his rifle by his side.</p>

  <p>The arrival of the reinforcements and the continued advance have delighted
  the troops, who are full of zeal and anxious to press on.</p>

  <p>Quite one of the features of the campaign, on our side, has been the
  success attained by the Royal Flying Corps. In regard to the collection of
  information it is impossible either to award too much praise to our aviators
  for the way they have carried out their duties or to over-estimate the value
  of the intelligence collected, more especially during the recent advance.</p>

  <p>In due course, certain examples of what has been effected may be specified
  and the far-reaching nature of the results fully explained, but that time has
  not yet arrived. That the services of our Flying Corps, which has really been
  on trial, are fully appreciated by our Allies is shown by the following
  message from the Commander-in-Chief of the French Armies received on the
  night of September 9 by Field-Marshal Sir John French&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Please express most particularly to Marshal French my thanks for services
  rendered on every day by the English Flying Corps. The precision, exactitude,
  and regularity of the news brought in by its members are evidence of their
  prefect organization and also of the perfect training of pilots and
  observers."</p>

  <p>To give a rough idea of the amount of work carried out it is sufficient to
  mention that, during a period of 20 days up to September 10, a daily average
  of more than nine reconnaissance flights of over 100 miles each has been
  maintained.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The value of the Flying Arm of the Army owes much to
  the indefatigable attention paid to it by Colonel Seely when Secretary of
  State for War. Colonel Seely, himself an experienced pilot, did more than any
  other member to create an efficient air-service. Though the editor holds
  other political views than those Colonel Seely represents he feels that it
  would be unjust to withhold credit from the Minister of War.]</p>

  <p>The constant object of our aviators has been to effect the accurate
  location of the enemy's forces, and, incidentally&mdash;since the operations
cover
  so large an area&mdash;of our own units. Nevertheless, the tactics adopted for
  dealing with hostile aircraft are to attack them instantly with one or more
  British machines.</p>

  <p>This has been so far successful that in five cases German pilots or
  observers have been shot in the air and their machines brought to the ground.
  As a consequence, the British Flying Corps has succeeded in establishing an
  individual ascendancy which is as serviceable to us as it is damaging to the
  enemy. How far it is due to this cause it is not possible at present to
  ascertain definitely, but the fact remains that the enemy have recently
  become much less enterprising in their flights. Something in the direction of
  the mastery of the air has already been gained.</p>

  <p>In pursuance of the principle that the main object of military aviators is
  the collection of information, bomb-dropping has not been indulged in to any
  great extent. On one occasion a petrol bomb was successfully exploded in a
  German bivouac at night, while, from a diary found on a dead German cavalry
  soldier, it has been discovered that a high explosive bomb thrown at a
  cavalry column from one of our aeroplanes struck an ammunition wagon. The
  resulting explosion killed 15 of the enemy.</p>

  <p>[This despatch, with the official notes by "Eye-Witness" on the
  Headquarters Staff, covers by far the most important period of the campaign
  to date, for although fighting of a yet more determined character was
  subsequently seen, undoubtedly the moment which inspired hope in every heart
  was in that fateful day when the Allies assumed the offensive and began to
  press back their pursuer.</p>

  <p>Whilst the despatch is very lucid on most points it lacks&mdash;naturally
  enough in an official document&mdash;that atmosphere which communicates to the
  reader something of that exhilaration which all sections of the Allied Armies
  must have felt when it became clear that at last the retirement had ended and
  the offensive movement against the enemy had begun.</p>

  <p>The advance was not general, nor was it made without terrific opposition.
  The lines rocked before they buckled, and in some places, notably in the
  centre, terrible encounters were of hourly occurrence. Ground was won
  stubbornly foot by foot, and the advancing hosts of Germany, flushed with
  triumph and with Paris in sight, did not give ground without great slaughter.
  They were strongly armed by success, heedless of danger, scornful of failure.
  They were, too, in sight of their goal and were not lightly to be turned from
  their supreme triumph.</p>

  <p>The human element must always be taken into account when weighing cause
  and effect, and if the Germans marched like machines and fought like
  machines, they thought and hoped like men. Every letter taken from the dead
  was full of faith and confidence. Paris lay open to them&mdash;they
anticipated an
  entry on the day they were turned back.</p>

  <p>Remembering this factor and remembering too how they had, as far as they
  knew, driven back the whole Anglo-French Army before them, it is not
  difficult to understand with what bewilderment and rage they felt themselves
  slipping from their foothold and from being pursuers became the
  pursued.&mdash;EDITOR.]</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; THE STRUGGLE ON THE AISNE</h2>

  <h3><big>THE THIRD DESPATCH</big></h3>

  <p class="first"><i>October 8, 1914.</i></p>

  <p class="first">MY LORD,</p>

  <p>I have the honour to report the operations in which the British forces in
  France have been engaged since the evening of September 10.</p>

  <p>1. In the early morning of the 11th the further pursuit of the enemy was
  commenced, and the three corps crossed the Ourcq practically unopposed, the
  cavalry reaching the line of the Aisne River; the 3rd and 5th Brigades south
  of Soissons, the 1st, 2nd, and 4th on the high ground at Couvrelles and
  Cerseuil.</p>

  <p>On the afternoon of the 12th from the opposition encountered by the 6th
  French Army to the west of Soissons, by the 3rd Corps south-east of that
  place, by the 2nd Corps south of Missy and Vailly, and certain indications
  all along the line, I formed the opinion that the enemy had, for the moment
  at any rate, arrested his retreat, and was preparing to dispute the passage
  of the Aisne with some vigour.</p>

  <p>South of Soissons the Germans were holding Mont de Paris against the
  attack of the right of the 6th French Army when the 3rd Corps reached the
  neighbourhood of Buzancy, south-east of that place. With the assistance of
  the artillery of the 3rd Corps the French drove them back across the river at
  Soissons, where they destroyed the bridges.</p>

  <p>The heavy artillery fire which was visible for several miles in a westerly
  direction in the valley of the Aisne showed that the 6th French Army was
  meeting with strong opposition all along the line.</p>

  <p>On this day the cavalry under General Allenby reached the neighbourhood of
  Braine, and did good work in clearing the town and the high ground beyond it
  of strong hostile detachments. The Queen's Bays are particularly mentioned by
  the General as having assisted greatly in the success of this operation. They
  were well supported by the 3rd Division, which on this night bivouacked at
  Brenelle, south of the river.</p>

  <p>The 5th Division approached Missy, but were unable to make headway.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* This would be one of the new Divisions which were sent
  to France to reinforce the army.]</p>

  <p>The 1st Army Corps reached the neighbourhood of Vauxcéré without much
  opposition.</p>

  <p>In this manner the battle of the Aisne commenced.</p>

  <p>2. The Aisne Valley runs generally east and west, and consists of a flat-
  bottomed depression of width varying from half a mile to two miles, down
  which the river follows a winding course to the west at some points near the
  southern slopes of the valley and at others near the northern. The high
  ground both on the north and south of the river is approximately 400 ft.
  above the bottom of the valley, and is very similar in character, as are both
  slopes of the valley itself, which are broken into numerous rounded spurs and
  reentrants. The most prominent of the former are the Chivre spur on the right
  bank and Sermoise spur on the left. Near the latter place the general plateau
  on the south is divided by a subsidiary valley of much the same character,
  down which the small River Vesle flows to the main stream near Sermoise. The
  slopes of the plateau overlooking the Aisne on the north and south are of
  varying steepness, and are covered with numerous patches of wood, which also
  stretch upwards and backwards over the edge on to the top of the high ground.
  There are several villages and small towns dotted about in the valley itself
  and along its sides, the chief of which is the town of Soissons.</p>

  <p>The Aisne is a sluggish stream of some 170 ft. in breadth, but, being 15
  ft. deep in the centre, it is unfordable. Between Soissons on the west and
  Villers on the east (the part of the river attacked and secured by the
  British forces) there are eleven road bridges across it. On the north bank a
  narrow-gauge railway runs from Soissons to Vailly, where it crosses the river
  and continues eastward along the south bank. From Soissons to Sermoise a
  double line of railway runs along the south bank, turning at the latter place
  up the Vesle Valley towards Bazoches.</p>

  <p>The position held by the enemy is a very strong one, either for a delaying
  action or for a defensive battle. One of its chief military characteristics
  is that from the high ground on neither side can the top of the plateau on
  the other side be seen except for small stretches. This is chiefly due to the
  woods on the edges of the slopes. Another important point is that all the
  bridges are under either direct or high-angle artillery fire.</p>

  <p>The tract of country above described, which lies north of the Aisne, is
  well adapted to concealment, and was so skilfully turned to account by the
  enemy as to render it impossible to judge the real nature of his opposition
  to our passage of the river, or to accurately gauge his strength; but I have
  every reason to conclude that strong rearguards of at least three army corps
  were holding the passages on the early morning of the 13th.</p>

  <p>3. On that morning I ordered the British forces to advance and make good
  the Aisne.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* To establish themselves on the furthermost bank.]</p>

  <p>The 1st Corps and the cavalry advanced on the river. The 1st Division was
  directed on Chanouille, via the canal bridge at Bourg, and the 2nd Division
  on Courtecon and Presles, via Pont-Arcy and on the canal to the north of
  Braye, via Chavonne. On the right the cavalry and 1st Division met with
  slight opposition, and found a passage by means of the canal which crosses
  the river by an aqueduct. The Division was, therefore, able to press on,
  supported by the Cavalry Division on its outer flank, driving back the enemy
  in front of it.</p>

  <p>On the left the leading troops of the 2nd Division reached the river by
  nine o'clock. The 5th Infantry Brigade were only enabled to cross, in single
  file and under considerable shell fire, by means of the broken girder of the
  bridge which was not entirely submerged in the river. The construction of a
  pontoon bridge was at once undertaken, and was completed by five o'clock in
  the afternoon.</p>

  <p>On the extreme left the 4th Guards Brigade met with severe opposition at
  Chavonne, and it was only late in the afternoon that it was able to establish
  a foothold on the northern bank of the river by ferrying one battalion across
  in boats.</p>

  <p>By nightfall the 1st Division occupied the area Moulins-Paissy-Geny, with
  posts in the village of Vendresse.</p>

  <p>The 2nd Division bivouacked as a whole on the southern bank of the river,
  leaving only the 5th Brigade on the north bank to establish a bridge
  head.</p>

  <p>The 2nd Corps found all the bridges in front of them destroyed, except
  that of Condé, which was in possession of the enemy, and remained so until
  the end of the battle.</p>

  <p>In the approach to Missy, where the 5th Division eventually crossed, there
  is some open ground which was swept by heavy fire from the opposite bank. The
  13th Brigade was, therefore, unable to advance; but the 14th, which was
  directed to the east of Venizel at a less exposed point, was rafted across,
  and by night established itself with its left at St. Marguerite. They were
  followed by the 15th Brigade, and later on both the 14th and 15th supported
  the 4th Division on their left in repelling a heavy counter-attack on the 3rd
  Corps.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 13th the 3rd Corps found the enemy had established
  himself in strength on the Vregny Plateau. The road bridge at Venizel was
  repaired during the morning, and a reconnaissance was made with a view to
  throwing a pontoon bridge at Soissons.</p>

  <p>The 12th Infantry Brigade crossed at Venizel, and was assembled at Bucy Le
  Long by 1 p.m., but the bridge was so far damaged that artillery could only
  be man-handled across it. Meanwhile the construction of a bridge was
  commenced close to the road bridge at Venizel.</p>

  <p>At 2 p.m. the 12th Infantry Brigade attacked in the direction of Chivres
  and Vregny with the object of securing the high ground east of Chivres, as a
  necessary preliminary to a further advance northwards. This attack made good
  progress, but at 5.30 p.m. the enemy's artillery and machine gun fire from
  the direction of Vregny became so severe that no further advance could be
  made. The positions reached were held till dark.</p>

  <p>The pontoon bridge at Venizel was completed 5*3° p-ni., when the 10th
  Infantry Brigade crossed the river and moved to Bucy Le Long.</p>

  <p>The 19th Infantry Brigade moved to Billy-sur-Aisne, and before dark all
  the artillery of the division had crossed the river, with the exception of
  the heavy battery and one brigade of field artillery.</p>

  <p>During the night the positions gained by the 12th Infantry Brigade to the
  east of the stream running through Chivres were handed over to the 5th
  Division.</p>

  <p>The section of the bridging train allotted to the 3rd Corps began to
  arrive in the neighbourhood of Soissons late in the afternoon, when an
  attempt to throw a heavy pontoon bridge at Soissons had to be abandoned,
  owing to the fire of the enemy's heavy howitzers.</p>

  <p>In the evening the enemy retired at all points and entrenched himself on
  the high ground about two miles north of the river, along which runs the
  Chemin-des-Dames. Detachments of infantry, however, strongly entrenched in
  commanding points down slopes of the various spurs, were left in front of all
  three corps, with powerful artillery in support of them.</p>

  <p>During the night of the 13th and on the 14th and following days the field
  companies were incessantly at work night and day. Eight pontoon bridges and
  one foot bridge were thrown across the river under generally very heavy
  artillery fire, which was incessantly kept up on to most of the crossings
  after completion. Three of the road bridges, i.e., Venizel, Missy, and
  Vailly, and the railway bridge east of Vailly were temporarily repaired so as
  to take foot traffic and the Villers Bridge made fit to carry weights up to
  six tons.</p>

  <p>Preparations were also made for the repair of the Missy, Vailly, and Bourg
  Bridges, so as to take mechanical transport.</p>

  <p>The weather was very wet and added to the difficulties by cutting up the
  already indifferent approaches, entailing a large amount of work to repair
  and improve.</p>

  <p>The operations of the field companies during this most trying time are
  worthy of the best traditions of the Royal Engineers.</p>

  <p>4. On the evening of the 14th it was still impossible to decide whether
  the enemy was only making a temporary halt, covered by rearguards, or whether
  he intended to stand and defend the position.</p>

  <p>With a view to clearing up the situation, I ordered a general advance.</p>

  <p>The action of the 1st Corps on this day under the direction and command of
  Sir Douglas Haig was of so skilful, bold, and decisive a character that he
  gained positions which alone have enabled me to maintain my position for more
  than three weeks of very severe fighting on the north bank of the river.</p>

  <p>The corps was directed to cross the line Moulins-Moussy by 7 a.m.</p>

  <p>On the right the General Officer Commanding the 1st Division directed the
  2nd Infantry Brigade (which was in billets and bivouacked about Moulins), and
  the 25th Artillery Brigade (less one battery), under General Bulfin, to move
  forward before daybreak, in order to protect the advance of the division sent
  up the valley to Vendresse. An officers' patrol* sent out by this brigade
  reported a considerable force of the enemy near the factory north of Troy on,
  and the Brigadier accordingly directed two regiments (the King's Royal Rifles
  and the Royal Sussex Regiment) to move at 3 a.m. The Northamptonshire
  Regiment was ordered to move at 4 a.m. to occupy the spur east of Troyon. The
  remaining regiment of the brigade (the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment) moved
  at 5.30 a.m. to the village of Vendresse. The factory was found to be held in
  considerable strength by the enemy, and the Brigadier ordered the Loyal North
  Lancashire Regiment to support the King's Royal Rifles and the Sussex
  Regiment. Even with this support the force was unable to make headway, and on
  the arrival of the 1st Brigade the Coldstream Guards were moved up to support
  the right of the leading brigade (the 2nd), while the remainder of the 1st
  Brigade supported its left.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* A strong scouting force under an officer.]</p>

  <p>About noon the situation was, roughly, that the whole of these two
  brigades were extended along a line running east and west, north of the line
  Troyon and south of the Chemin-des-Dames. A party of the Loyal North
  Lancashire Regiment had seized and were holding the factory. The enemy held a
  line of entrenchments north and east of the factory in considerable strength,
  and every effort to advance against this line was driven back by heavy shell
  and machine-gun fire. The morning was wet, and a heavy mist hung over the
  hills, so that the 25th Artillery Brigade and the Divisional Artillery were
  unable to render effective support to the advanced troops until about nine
  o'clock.</p>

  <p>By ten o'clock the 3rd Infantry Brigade had reached a point one mile south
  of Vendresse, and from there it was ordered to continue the line of the 1st
  Brigade and to connect with and help the right of the 2nd Division. A strong
  hostile column was found to be advancing, and by a vigorous counter-stroke
  with two of his battalions the Brigadier checked the advance of this column
  and relieved the pressure on the 2nd Division. From this period until late in
  the afternoon the fighting consisted of a series of attacks and counter-
  attacks. The counter-strokes by the enemy were delivered at first with great
  vigour, but later on they decreased in strength, and all were driven off with
  heavy loss.</p>

  <p>On the left the 6th Infantry Brigade had been ordered to cross the river
  and to pass through the line held during the preceding night by the 5th
  Infantry Brigade and occupy the Courtecon Ridge, whilst a detached force,
  consisting of the 4th Guards Brigade and the 36th Brigade, Royal Field
  Artillery, under Brigadier-General Perceval, were ordered to proceed to a
  point east of the village of Ostel.</p>

  <p>The 6th Infantry Brigade crossed the river at Pont-Arcy, moved up the
  valley towards Braye, and at 9 a.m. had reached the line Tilleul-La Buvelle.
  On this line they came under heavy artillery and rifle fire, and were unable
  to advance until supported by the 34th Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, and
  the 44th Howitzer Brigade and the Heavy Artillery.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The French did not have their guns in position until
  later.]</p>

  <p>The 4th Guards Brigade crossed the river at 10 a.m., and met with very
  heavy opposition. It had to pass through dense woods; field artillery support
  was difficult to obtain; but one section of the field battery pushed up to
  and within the firing line. At 1 p.m. the left of the brigade was south of
  the Ostel Ridge.</p>

  <p>At this period of the action the enemy obtained a footing between the 1st
  and 2nd Corps, and threatened to cut the communications of the latter.</p>

  <p>Sir Douglas Haig was very hardly pressed, and had no reserve in hand. I
  placed the cavalry division at his disposal, part of which he skilfully used
  to prolong and secure the left flank of the Guards Brigade. Some heavy
  fighting ensued, which resulted in the enemy being driven back with heavy
  loss.</p>

  <p>About four o'clock the weakening of the counterattacks by the enemy and
  other indications tended to show that his resistance was decreasing, and a
  general advance was ordered by the Army Corps Commander. Although meeting
  with considerable opposition, and coming under very heavy artillery and rifle
  fire, the position of the corps at the end of the day's operations extended
  from the Chemin-des-Dames on the right, through Chivy, to Le Cour de Soupir,
  with the 1st Cavalry Brigade extending to the Chavonne-Soissons road.</p>

  <p>On the right the corps was in close touch with the French Moroccan troops
  of the 18th Corps, which were entrenched in echelon to its right rear. During
  the night they entrenched this position.</p>

  <p>Throughout the battle of the Aisne this advanced and commanding position
  was maintained, and I cannot speak too highly of the valuable services
  rendered by Sir Douglas Haig and the army corps under his command. Day after
  day and night after night the enemy's infantry has been hurled against him in
  violent counter-attack, which has never on any one occasion succeeded,
  whilst the trenches all over his position have been under continuous heavy
  artillery fire.</p>

  <p>The operations of the 1st Corps on this day resulted in the capture of
  several hundred prisoners, some field pieces, and machine guns.</p>

  <p>The casualties were very severe, one brigade alone losing three of its
  four colonels.</p>

  <p>The 3rd Division commenced a further advance, and had nearly reached the
  plateau of Aizy when they were driven back by a powerful counterattack
  supported by heavy artillery. The division, however, fell back in the best
  order, and finally entrenched itself about a mile north of Vailly Bridge,
  effectively covering the passage.</p>

  <p>The 4th and 5th Divisions were unable to do more than maintain their
  ground.</p>

  <p>5. On the morning of the 15th, after close examination of the position, it
  became clear to me that the enemy was making a determined stand, and this
  view was confirmed by reports which reached me from the French Armies
  fighting on my right and left, which clearly showed that a strongly
  entrenched line of defence was being taken up from the north of Compiègne,
  eastward and south-eastward, along the whole valley of the Aisne up to and
  beyond Reims.</p>

  <p>A few days previously the fortress of Maubauge fell, and a considerable
  quantity of siege artillery was brought down from that place to strengthen
  the enemy's position in front of us.</p>

  <p>During the 15th shells fell in our position which have been judged by
  experts to be thrown by eight-inch siege guns with a range of 10,000 yards.
  Throughout the whole course of the battle our troops have suffered very
  heavily from this fire, although its effect latterly was largely mitigated by
  more efficient and thorough entrenching, the necessity for which I impressed
  strongly upon army corps commanders. In order to assist them in this work all
  villages within the area of our occupation were searched for heavy
  entrenching tools, a large number of which were collected.</p>

  <p>In view of the peculiar formation of the ground on the north side of the
  river between Missy and Soissons, and its extraordinary adaptability to a
  force on the defensive, the 5th Division found it impossible to maintain its
  position on the southern edge of the Chivres Plateau, as the enemy in
  possession of the village of Vregny to the west was able to bring a flank
  fire to bear upon it. The Division had, therefore, to retire to a line the
  left of which was at the village of Marguerite, and thence ran by the north
  edge of Missy back to the river to the east of that place.</p>

  <p>With great skill and tenacity Sir Charles Fergusson maintained this
  position throughout the whole battle, although his trenches were necessarily
  on lower ground than that occupied by the enemy on the southern edge of the
  plateau, which was only 400 yards away.</p>

  <p>General Hamilton with the 3rd Division vigorously attacked to the north,
  and regained all the ground he had lost on the 15th, which throughout the
  battle has formed a most powerful and effective bridge head.</p>

  <p>6. On the 16th the 6th Division came up into line.</p>

  <p>It had been my intention to direct the 1st Corps to attack and seize the
  enemy's position on the Chemin-des-Dames, supporting it with this new
  reinforcement. I hoped from the position thus gained to bring effective fire
  to bear across the front of the 3rd Division which, by securing the advance
  of the latter, would also take the pressure off the 5th Division and the 3rd
  Corps.</p>

  <p>But any further advance of the 1st Corps would have dangerously exposed my
  right flank. And, further, I learned from the French Commander-in-Chief that
  he was strongly reinforcing the 6th French Army on my left, with the
  intention of bringing up the Allied left to attack the enemy's flank, and
  thus compel his retirement. I therefore sent the 6th Division to join the 3rd
  Corps, with orders to keep it on the south side of the river, as it might be
  available in general reserve.</p>

  <p>On the 17th, 18th, and 19th the whole of our line was heavily bombarded,
  and the 1st Corps was constantly and heavily engaged. On the afternoon of the
  17th the right flank of the 1st Division was seriously threatened. A
  counterattack was made by the Northamptonshire Regiment in combination with
  the Queen's, and one battalion of the Divisional Reserve was moved up in
  support. The Northamptonshire Regiment, under cover of mist, crept up to
  within a hundred yards of the enemy's trenches and charged with the bayonet,
  driving them out of the trenches and up the hill. A very strong force of
  hostile infantry was then disclosed on the crest line. This new line was
  enfiladed by part of the Queen's and the King's Royal Rifles, which wheeled
  to their left on the extreme right of our infantry line, and were supported
  by a squadron of cavalry on their outer flank. The enemy's attack was
  ultimately driven back with heavy loss.</p>

  <p>On the 18th, during the night, the Gloucestershire Regiment advanced from
  their position near Chivy, filled in the enemy's trenches and captured two
  Maxim guns.</p>

  <p>On the extreme right the Queen's were heavily attacked, but the enemy was
  repulsed with great loss. About midnight the attack was renewed on the 1st
  Division, supported by artillery fire, but was again repulsed.</p>

  <p>Shortly after midnight an attack was made on the left of the 2nd Division
  with considerable force, which was also thrown back.</p>

  <p>At about 1 p.m. on the 19th the 2nd Division drove back a heavy infantry
  attack strongly supported by artillery fire. At dusk the attack was renewed
  and again repulsed.</p>

  <p>On the 18th I discussed with the General Officer Commanding the 2nd Army
  Corps and his Divisional Commanders the possibility of driving the enemy out
  of Condé, which lay between his two divisions, and seizing the bridge which
  has remained throughout in his possession.</p>

  <p>As, however, I found that the bridge was closely commanded from all points
  on the south side and that satisfactory arrangements were made to prevent any
  issue from it by the enemy by day or night, I decided that it was not
  necessary to incur the losses which an attack would entail, as, in view of
  the position of the 2nd and 3rd Corps, the enemy could make no use of Condé,
  and would be automatically forced out of it by any advance which might become
  possible for us.</p>

  <p>7. On this day information reached me from General Joffre that he had
  found it necessary to make a new plan, and to attack and envelop the German
  right flank.</p>

  <p>It was now evident to me that the battle in which we had been engaged
  since the 12th instant must last some days longer, until the effect of this
  new flank movement could be felt, and a way opened to drive the enemy from
  his positions.</p>

  <p>It thus became essential to establish some system of regular relief in the
  trenches, and I have used the infantry of the 6th Division for this purpose
  with good results. The relieved brigades were brought back alternately south
  of the river, and, with the artillery of the 6th Division, formed a general
  reserve on which I could rely in case of necessity.</p>

  <p>The cavalry has rendered most efficient and ready help in the trenches,
  and have done all they possibly could to lighten the arduous and trying task
  which has of necessity fallen to the lot of the infantry.</p>

  <p>On the evening of the 19th, and throughout the 20th, the enemy again
  commenced to show considerable activity. On the former night a severe
  counter-attack on the 3rd Division was repulsed with considerable loss, and
  from early on Sunday morning various hostile attempts were made on the
  trenches of the 1st Division. During the day the enemy suffered another
  severe repulse in front of the 2nd Division, losing heavily in the attempt.
  In the course of the afternoon the enemy made desperate attempts against the
  trenches all along the front of the 1st Corps, but with similar results.</p>

  <p>After dark the enemy again attacked the 2nd Division, only to be again
  driven back.</p>

  <p>Our losses on these two days were considerable, but the number, as
  obtained, of the enemy's killed and wounded vastly exceeded them.</p>

  <p>As the troops of the 1st Army Corps were much exhausted by this continual
  fighting, I reinforced Sir Douglas Haig with a brigade from the reserve, and
  called upon the 1st Cavalry Division to assist them.</p>

  <p>On the night of the 21st another violent counterattack was repulsed by the
  3rd Division, the enemy losing heavily.</p>

  <p>On the 23rd the four six-inch howitzer batteries, which I had asked to be
  sent from home, arrived. Two batteries were handed over to the 2nd Corps and
  two to the 1st Corps. They were brought into action on the 24th with very
  good results.</p>

  <p>Our experiences in this campaign seem to point to the employment of more
  heavy guns of a larger calibre in great battles which last for several days,
  during which time powerful entrenching work on both sides can be carried
  out.</p>

  <p>These batteries were used with considerable effect on the 24th and the
  following days.</p>

  <p>8. On the 23rd the action of General de Castelnau's army on the Allied
  left developed considerably, and apparently withdrew considerable forces of
  the enemy away from the centre and east. I am not aware whether it was due to
  this cause or not, but until the 26th it appeared as though the enemy's
  opposition in our front was weakening. On that day, however, a very marked
  renewal of activity commenced. A constant and vigorous artillery bombardment
  was maintained all day, and the Germans in front of the 1st Division were
  observed to be "sapping" up to our lines and trying to establish new
  trenches. Renewed counter-attacks were delivered and beaten off during the
  course of the day, and in the afternoon a well-timed attack by the 1st
  Division stopped the enemy's entrenching work.</p>

  <p>During the night of 27th-28th the enemy again made the most determined
  attempts to capture the trenches of the 1st Division, but without the
  slightest success.</p>

  <p>Similar attacks were reported during these three days all along the line
  of the Allied front, and it is certain that the enemy then made one last
  great effort to establish ascendancy. He was, however, unsuccessful
  everywhere, and is reported to have suffered heavy losses. The same futile
  attempts were made all along our front up to the evening of the 28th, when
  they died away, and have not since been renewed.</p>

  <p>On former occasions I have brought to your lordship's notice the valuable
  services performed during this campaign by the Royal Artillery. Throughout
  the battle of the Aisne they have displayed the same skill, endurance, and
  tenacity, and I deeply appreciate the work they have done.</p>

  <p>Sir David Henderson and the Royal Flying Corps under his command have
  again proved their incalculable value. Great strides have been made in the
  development of the use of aircraft in the tactical sphere by establishing
  effective communication between aircraft and units in action.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to describe adequately and accurately the great strain to
  which officers and men were subjected almost every hour of the day and night
  throughout this battle.</p>

  <p>I have described above the severe character of the artillery fire which
  was directed from morning till night, not only upon the trenches, but over
  the whole surface of the ground occupied by our forces. It was not until a
  few days before the position was evacuated that the heavy guns were removed
  and the fire slackened. Attack and counter-attack occurred at all hours of
  the night and day throughout the whole position, demanding extreme vigilance,
  and permitting only a minimum of rest.</p>

  <p>The fact that between September 12 to the date of this despatch the total
  numbers of killed, wounded, and missing reached the figures amounting to 561
  officers, 12,980 men, proves the severity of the struggle.</p>

  <p>The tax on the endurance of the troops was further increased by the heavy
  rain and cold which prevailed for some ten or twelve days of this trying
  time.</p>

  <p>The battle of the Aisne has once more demonstrated the splendid spirit,
  gallantry, and devotion which animates the officers and men of his Majesty's
  Forces.</p>

  <p>With reference to the last paragraph of my despatch of September 7, I
  append the names of officers, non-commissioned officers, and men brought
  forward for special mention by Army Corps commanders and heads of departments
  for services rendered from the commencement of the campaign up to the present
  date.</p>

  <p>I entirely agree with these recommendations and beg to submit them for
  your lordship's consideration.</p>

  <p>I further wish to bring forward the names of the following officers who
  have rendered valuable service: General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien and
  Lieutenant-General Sir Douglas Haig (commanding 1st and 2nd Corps
  respectively) I have already mentioned in the present and former despatches
  for particularly marked and distinguished service in critical situations.</p>

  <p>Since the commencement of the campaign they have carried out all my orders
  and instructions with the utmost ability.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant-General W. P. Pulteney took over the command of the 3rd Corps
  just before the commencement of the battle of the Marne. Throughout the
  subsequent operations he showed himself to be a most capable commander in the
  field, and has rendered very valuable services.</p>

  <p>Major-General E. H. H. Allenby and Major-General H. de la P. Gough have
  proved themselves to be cavalry leaders of a high order, and I am deeply
  indebted to them. The undoubted moral superiority which our cavalry has
  obtained over that of the enemy has been due to the skill with which they
  have turned to the best account the qualities inherent in the splendid troops
  they command.</p>

  <p>In my despatch of September 7 I mentioned the name of Brigadier-General
  Sir David Henderson and his valuable work in command of the Royal Flying
  Corps, and I have once more to express my deep appreciation of the help he
  has since rendered me.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant-General Sir Archibald Murray has continued to render me
  invaluable help as Chief of the Staff, and in his arduous and responsible
  duties he has been ably assisted by Major-General Henry Wilson,
  Sub-Chief.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant-General Sir Nevil Macready* and Lieutenant-General Sir William
  Robertson have continued to perform excellent service as Adjutant-General and
  Quartermaster-General respectively.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Major-General Sir Nevil Macready, the
  Adjutant-General, has also been confronted with most onerous and difficult
  tasks in connexion with disciplinary arrangements and the preparation of
  casualty lists. He has been indefatigable in his exertions to meet the
  difficult situations which arose.</p>

  <p>The Director of Army Signals, Lieutenant-Colonel J. S. Fowler, has
  materially assisted the operations by the skill and energy which he has
  displayed in the working of the important department over which he
  presides.</p>

  <p>My Military Secretary, Brigadier-General the Hon. W. Lambton, has
  performed his arduous and difficult duties with much zeal and great
  efficiency.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-2"
     name="ch3-2"></a> INCIDENTS OF THE PERIOD<br>
  COVERED BY THE THIRD DESPATCH</h2>

  <h3>BY "EYE-WITNESS" ON THE STAFF OF SIR JOHN FRENCH</h3>

  <p class="first">SINCE Thursday, September 10, the Army has made steady
  progress in its endeavour to drive back the enemy in co-operation with the
  French. The country across which it has had to force its way, and will have
  to continue to do so, is undulating and covered with patches of thick wood.
  Within the area which faced the British before the advance commenced, right
  up to Laon, the chief feature of tactical importance is the fact that there
  are six rivers running right across the direction of advance, at all of which
  it was possible that the Germans might make resistance.</p>

  <p>These are, in order from the south, the Marne, the Ourcq, the Vesle, the
  Aisne, the Ailette, and the Oise. The enemy held the line of the Marne, which
  was crossed by our forces on September 9 as a purely rearguard operation; our
  passage of the Ourcq, which here runs almost due east and west, was not
  contested; the Vesle was only lightly held; while the resistance along the
  Aisne, both against French and British, has been and still is of a determined
  character.</p>

  <p>The course of the operations during September ii, 12, and 13 has been as
  follows: On Friday, the 11th, but little opposition was met with by us along
  any part of our front, and the direction of advance was, for the purpose of
  cooperating with our Allies, turned slightly to the north-east. The day was
  spent in pushing forward and in gathering in various hostile detachments, and
  by nightfall our forces had reached a line to the north of the Ourcq
  extending from Oulchy-le-Chateau to Long Pont.</p>

  <p>On this day there was also a general advance on the part of the French
  along their whole line, which ended in substantial success, in one portion of
  the field Duke Albrecht of Wurtemburg's 4th Army being driven back across the
  Saulx, and elsewhere the whole of the corps artillery of a German corps being
  captured. Several German colours also were taken.</p>

  <p>It was only on this day that the full extent of the victory gained by the
  Allies on the 8th was appreciated by them, and the moral effect of this
  success has been enormous. An order dated the 6th or 7th September, by the
  Commander of the German 7th Corps, was picked up, in which it was stated that
  the great object of the war was about to be attained, since the French were
  going to accept battle, and that upon the result of this battle would depend
  the issue of the war and the honour of the German Armies.</p>

  <p>It seems probable that the Germans not only expected to find that the
  British Army was beyond the power of assuming the offensive for some time,
  but counted on the French having been driven back on to the line of the
  Seine; and that, though surprised to find the latter moving forward against
  them after they had crossed the Marne, they were in no wise deterred from
  making a great effort.</p>

  <p>On Saturday, September 12, the enemy were found to be occupying a very
  formidable position opposite to us on the north of the Aisne. At Soissons
  they held both sides of the river and an entrenched line on the hills to the
  north. Of eight road bridges and two railway bridges crossing the Aisne
  within our section of front, seven of the former and both of the latter had
  been demolished.</p>

  <p>Working from west to east our 3rd Army Corps gained some high ground south
  of the Aisne overlooking the Aisne valley east of Soissons. Here a long-range
  artillery duel between our guns and those of the French on our left, and the
  enemy's artillery in the hills continued during the greater part of the day
  and did not cease until nearly midnight. The enemy had a very large number of
  heavy howitzers in well-concealed positions.* The movement of this Army Corps
  was effected in co-operation with that of the French 6th Army on our left,
  which gained the southern half of the town during the night. The 2nd Army
  Corps did not cross the Aisne.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Probably in the stone quarries above Soissons. This
  was the position which defied dislodgment.]</p>

  <p>The 1st Army Corps got over the River Vesle to the south of the Aisne
  after the crossing had been secured by the 1st Cavalry Division. It then
  reached a line south of the Aisne practically without fighting. At Braine the
  1st Cavalry Division met with considerable opposition from infantry and
  machine guns holding the town and guarding the bridge.</p>

  <p>With the aid of some of our infantry it gained possession of the town
  about midday, driving the enemy to the north. Some hundred prisoners were
  captured round Braine, where the Germans had thrown a large amount of
  field-gun ammunition into the river, where it was visible under two feet of
  water. On our right the French reached the line of the river Vesle.</p>

  <p>On this day began the action along the Aisne which is not yet finished,
  and which may be merely of a rearguard nature on a large scale, or may be the
  commencement of a battle of a more serious nature.* It rained heavily on
  Saturday afternoon and all through the night, which severely handicapped the
  transport.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* It is now known that this position was carefully
  chosen in advance and that the German Army's "demonstration" south was
  utilized for putting the line into a condition which would allow of a long
  defence.]</p>

  <p>On Sunday, September 13, an extremely strong resistance was encountered
  along the whole of our front, which was some fifteen miles in length. The
  action still consisted for the most part of long-range gun fire, that of the
  Germans being to a great extent from their heavy howitzers, which were firing
  from cleverly concealed positions. Some of the actual crossings of the Aisne
  were guarded by strong detachments of infantry with machine guns. By
  nightfall portions of all three corps were across the river, the cavalry
  returning to the south side. By this night or early next morning three
  pontoon bridges had been built, and our troops also managed to get across the
  river by means of a bridge carrying the canal over the river, which had not
  been destroyed.</p>

  <p>On our left the French pressed on, but were prevented by artillery fire
  from building a pontoon bridge at Soissons. A large number of infantry,
  however, crossed in single file on the top of one girder of the railway
  bridge which was left standing.</p>

  <p>During the last three or four days many isolated parties of Germans have
  been discovered hiding in the numerous woods a long way behind our line. As a
  rule they seem glad to surrender, and the condition of some of them may be
  gathered from the following incident. An officer, who was proceeding along
  the road in charge of a number of led horses, received information that there
  were some of the enemy in the neighbourhood. Upon seeing them he gave the
  order to charge, whereupon three German officers and 106 men surrendered.</p>

  <p>The following are some details of the conduct of the enemy in occupation
  of three of the small towns to the north of Paris&mdash;</p>

  <p>At Senlis it is stated, on what appears to be good authority, that a
  poacher shot one German soldier and wounded another as the forces entered the
  town. The German commander then assembled the Mayor of the town and five
  other leading citizens and forced them to kneel before graves which had
  already been dug.</p>

  <p>Requisition was made for various supplies, and the six citizens were then
  taken to a neighbouring field and shot. According to the corroborative
  evidence of several independent persons, some twenty-four people, including
  women and children, were also shot. The town was then pillaged, and was fired
  in several places before it was evacuated. It is believed that the cathedral
  was not damaged, but many houses were destroyed. Creil was also thoroughly
  pillaged and many houses were burnt.</p>

  <p>Immediately on arrival a proclamation was issued by the commander of the
  German division. The main points were:&mdash;</p>

  <p>That all arms were to be handed in at the Town Hall at once. That all
  civilians found with arms would be shot at once. That no person was to be in
  the street after dark. That no lights were to be maintained in the houses or
  streets at night. That the doors of all houses were to be left open. That the
  inhabitants were not to collect in groups. That any obstruction of the German
  troops or threatening of them would be immediately punished by death. That
  German money was to be accepted at the rate of 1 mark for 1f. 25.</p>

  <p>At Villers Gotterets the Mayor appears to have behaved very judiciously,
  and, though supplies far in excess of the capabilities of the place were
  demanded, the town was not seriously damaged. The Germans evacuated the place
  on September 11 in such haste that they left behind a large amount of the
  bread requisitioned. It was stated by the inhabitants that the enemy
  destroyed and abandoned fifteen motor-lorries, seven guns, and ammunition
  wagons.</p>

  <p>Reims was occupied by the enemy on September 3. It was reoccupied by the
  French after considerable fighting on the 13th. On the 12th a proclamation, a
  copy of which is in possession of the British Army, was posted all over the
  town. A literal translation of this poster is given below&mdash;</p>

  <h3>PROCLAMATION</h3>

  <p class="quote"><i>In the event of an action being fought either to-day or
  in the immediate future in the neighbourhood of Reims, or in the town itself,
  the inhabitants are warned that they must remain absolutely calm and must in
  no way try to take part in the fighting. They must not attempt to attack
  either isolated soldiers or detachments of the German Army. The section of
  barricades, the taking up of paving stones in the streets in a way to hinder
  the movements of troops, or, in a word, any action that may embarrass the
  German Army, is formally forbidden.</i></p>

  <p class="quote"><i>With a view to securing adequately the safety of the
  troops and to instil calm into the population of Reims the persons named
  below have been seized as hostages by the Commander-in-Chief of the German
  Army. These hostages will be hanged at the slightest attempt at disorder.
  Also the town will be totally or partly burnt and the inhabitants will be
  hanged for any infraction of the above.</i></p>

  <p class="quote"><i>By order of the German authorities,</i></p>

  <p class="quote"><i>THE MAYOR (Dr. Langlef). Reims, September 12,
  1914.</i></p><br>

  <p>Here follow the names of eighty-one of the principal inhabitants of Reims
  with their addresses, including four priests, ending with the words "and some
  others."</p><br>

  <p>[At the time this despatch was written, the Allied line was roughly as
  follows&mdash;</p>

  <p>From Verdun sweeping down to Vitry le Franfois up through Montmirail to
  Chatellon-sur-Marne and then (continuing a rough arc), to Soissons. From
  thence the line ran due west through Compiègne to the Oise. It will thus be
  seen that the German line still "bulged" southward into France to a point
  almost level with Paris.</p>

  <p>Fighting was general all along this line, and in the neighbourhood of
  Vitry particularly the French attack was very determined.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to settle the date on which began the battle of the Aisne,
  but it is safe to mark the passage on the 13th as the actual beginning of
  that great resistance, although the line farther to the right of the British
  was engaged on the Aisne proper earlier than this. The operations before
  Soissons, however, must be taken as representing the commencement of the
  serious dispute. Historians following the example of present-day newspapers
  may mark September 12 as the beginning.&mdash;Editor.]</p>

  <p>On the 14th September the Germans were making a determined resistance
  along the River Aisne. The opposition, which it was at first thought might
  possibly be of a rearguard nature not entailing material delay to our
  progress, has developed, and has proved to be more serious than was
  anticipated. The action now being fought by the Germans along their line may,
  it is true, have been undertaken in order to gain time for some strategic
  operation or move, and may not be their main stand.</p>

  <p>But if this be so, the fighting is naturally on a scale which, as to
  extent of ground covered and duration of resistance, makes it
  indistinguishable in its progress from what is known as a "pitched battle,"
  though the enemy certainly showed signs of considerable disorganization
  during the earlier days of their retirement.</p>

  <p>Whether it was originally intended by them to defend the position they
  took up as strenuously as they have done, or whether the delay gained for
  them during the 12th and 13th by their artillery has enabled them to develop
  their resistance and to reinforce their line to an extent not originally
  contemplated, cannot yet be said.</p>

  <p>So far as we are concerned the action still being contested is the battle
  of the Aisne, for we are fighting just across that river along the whole of
  our front. To the east and west the struggle is not confined to the valley of
  that river, though it will probably bear its name.2 The progress of our
  operations and of those French Armies nearest to us for the 14th, 15th, 16th,
  and 17th will now be described.</p>

  <p>On Monday, the 14th, those of our troops which had on the previous day
  crossed the Aisne after driving in the German rearguard on that evening found
  portions of the enemy's forces in prepared defensive positions on the plateau
  on the right bank, and could do little more than secure a footing north of
  the river. This, however, they maintained in spite of two counter-attacks,
  delivered at dusk and at 10 p.m., in which the fighting was severe.</p>

  <p>During the 14th strong reinforcements of our troops were passed to the
  north bank, the troops crossing by ferry, by pontoon bridges, and by the
  remains of the permanent bridges. Close co-operation with the French forces
  was maintained, and the general progress made was good.</p>

  <p>Although the opposition was vigorous and the state of the roads after the
  heavy rain made movements slow, one division alone failed to secure the
  ground it expected to. The 1st Army Corps, after repulsing repeated attacks,
  captured 600 prisoners and 12 guns; the cavalry also took a number of
  prisoners. Many of the Germans taken belong to Reserve and <i>Landwehr</i>
  formations, which fact appears to indicate that the enemy is compelled to
  draw on the older classes of soldiers to fill the gaps in his ranks.</p>

  <p>There was heavy rain through the night of the 14th-15th, and during the
  15th September the situation of the British forces underwent no essential
  change, but it became more and more evident that the defensive preparations
  made by the enemy were more extensive than was at first apparent. In order to
  counterbalance these, measures were taken by us to economize troops and to
  secure protection from the hostile artillery fire, which was very fierce, and
  our men continued to improve their entrenchments.</p>

  <p>The Germans bombarded our lines nearly all day, using heavy guns, brought
  no doubt from before Maubeuge, as well as those with the corps.* All their
  counter-attacks, however, failed, although in some places they were repeated
  six times; one made on the 4th Guards Brigade was repulsed with heavy
  slaughter. An attempt to advance slightly made by part of our line was
  unsuccessful as regards gain in ground, but led to withdrawal of part of the
  enemy's infantry and artillery.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The guns which did the damage before Maubeuge were the
  "Busy Berthas," the 42-centimetre guns. It is hardly likely that there would
  be very many of these in existence owing to their complicated character and
  the difficulty of transport. Nor would they be risked on a battle front,
  their employment being limited to siege operations where there was no danger
  of capture. Our own guns did great damage to the enemy on the 15th.]</p>

  <p>Further counter-attacks made during the night were beaten off. Rain came
  on towards evening and continued intermittently until 9 a.m. on the 16th.
  Besides adding to the discomfort of the soldiers holding open trenches in the
  firing line, the wet weather to some extent hampered the motor transport
  service, which was also hindered by the broken bridges.</p>

  <p>On Wednesday, the 16th, there was little change in the situation opposite
  the British. The efforts made by the enemy were less active than on the
  previous day, though their bombardment continued throughout the morning and
  evening. Our artillery fire drove the defenders off one of the salients of
  their position, but they returned in the evening. Forty prisoners were taken
  by the 3rd Division.</p>

  <p>On Thursday, September 17, the situation still remained unchanged in its
  essentials. The German heavy artillery fire was more active than on the
  previous day. The only infantry attacks made by the enemy were on the extreme
  right of our position, and, as had happened before, were repulsed with heavy
  loss, chiefly on this occasion by our field artillery.</p>

  <p>In order to convey some idea of the nature of the fighting it may be said
  that along the greater part of our front the Germans have been driven back
  from the forward slopes on the north of the river. Their infantry are holding
  strong lines of trenches amongst and along the edges of the numerous woods
  which crown these slopes. These trenches are elaborately constructed and
  cleverly concealed.</p>

  <p>In many places there are wire entanglements and lengths of rabbit fencing
  both in the woods and in the open, carefully aligned so that they can be
  swept by rifle fire and machine guns, which are invisible from our side of
  the valley. The ground in front of the infantry trenches is also as a rule
  under cross fire from field artillery placed on neighbouring features and
  under high-angle fire from pieces placed well back behind woods on top of the
  plateau.</p>

  <p>A feature of this action, as of the previous fights, is the use made by
  the enemy of their numerous heavy howitzers, with which they are able to
  direct a long-range fire all over the valley and right across it. Upon these
  they evidently place great reliance.</p>

  <p>Where our men are holding the forward edges of the high ground on the
  north side they are now strongly entrenched. They are well fed, and in spite
  of the wet weather of the past week are cheerful and confident. The
  bombardment by both sides has been very heavy, and on Sunday, Monday, and
  Tuesday was practically continuous.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, in spite of the general din caused by the reports of the
  immense number of heavy guns in action along our front on Wednesday, the
  arrival of a French force acting against the German right flank was at once
  announced on the east of our front some miles away by the continuous roar of
  their quick-firing artillery with which their attack was opened.</p>

  <p>So far as the British are concerned the greater part of this week has been
  passed in bombardment, in gaining ground by degrees, and in beating back
  severe counter-attacks with heavy slaughter. Our casualties have been severe,
  but it is probable that those of the enemy are heavier. The rain has caused a
  great drop in temperature and there is more than a distinct feeling of autumn
  in the air, especially in the early mornings.</p>

  <p>On our right and left the French have been fighting fiercely and have also
  been gradually gaining ground. One village has already during this battle
  been captured and recaptured twice by each side,* and at the time of writing
  remains in the hands of the Germans. The fighting has been at close quarters
  and of the most desperate nature, and the streets of the village are filled
  with the dead of both sides. As an example of the spirit which is inspiring
  our Allies the following translation of the Ordre du Jour published on
  September 9 after the battle of Montmirail by the Commander of the French 5th
  Army is given&mdash;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* See note written from description of

  <p class="quote"><i>Soldiers!</i></p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Montmirail, September 9, 1914, General Commanding the 5th

  <p class="quote"><i>FRANCHET D'ESPEREY.</i></p><br>

  <p>The Germans are a formidable enemy. Well trained, long prepared, and
  brave, their soldiers are carrying on the contest with skill and valour.
  Nevertheless they are fighting to win anyhow, regardless of all the rules of
  fair play, and there is evidence that they do not hesitate at anything in
  order to gain victory. A large number of the tales of their misbehaviour are
  exaggerations, and some of the stringent precautions they have taken to guard
  themselves against the inhabitants of the areas traversed are possibly
  justifiable measures of war. But at the same time it has been definitely
  established that they have committed atrocities on many occasions and they
  have been guilty of brutal conduct.</p>

  <p>So many letters and statements of our own wounded soldiers have been
  published in our newspapers that the following epistle from a German soldier
  of the 74th Infantry Regiment (10th Corps) to his wife also may be of
  interest&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="first">My dear Wife,</p>

  <p>I have just been living through days that defy imagination. I should never
  have thought that men could stand it. Not a second has passed but my life has
  been in danger, and yet not a hair of my head has been hurt. It was horrible,
  it was ghastly. But I have been saved for you and for our happiness and I
  take heart again, although I am still terribly unnerved. God grant that I may
  see you again soon and that this horror may soon be over. None of us can do
  any more, human strength is at an end.</p>

  <p>I will try to tell you about it&mdash;</p>

  <p>On the 5th September the enemy were reported to be taking up a position
  near St. Prix (N.E. of Paris). The 10th Corps, which had made an
  astonishingly rapid advance, of course attacked on the Sunday.</p>

  <p>Steep slopes led up to heights which were held in considerable force. With
  our weak detachments on the 74th and 91st Regiments we reached the crest and
  came under a terrible artillery fire that mowed us down. However, we entered
  St. Prix. Hardly had we done so than we were met with shell fire and a
  violent fusillade from the enemy's infantry. Our Colonel was badly
  wounded&mdash;he is the third we have had. Fourteen men were killed round
me....
  We got away in a lull without being hit.</p>

  <p>The 7th, 8th, and 9th of September we were constantly under shell and
  shrapnel fire and suffered terrible losses. I was in a house which was hit
  several times. The fear of a death of agony which is in every man's heart,
  and naturally so, is a terrible feeling.</p>

  <p>How often I thought of you, my darling, and what I suffered in that
  terrifying battle which extended along a front of many miles near Montmirail,
  you cannot possibly imagine. Our heavy artillery was being used for the siege
  of Maubeuge; we wanted it badly, as the enemy had theirs in force and kept up
  a furious bombardment. For four days I was under artillery fire. It is like
  Hell, but a thousand times worse. On the night of the 9th the order was given
  to retreat, as it would have been madness to attempt to hold our position
  with our few men, and we should have risked a terrible defeat the next day.
  The 1st and 3rd Armies had not been able to attack with us, as we had
  advanced too rapidly.</p>

  <p>Our moral was absolutely broken.</p>

  <p>In spite of unheard-of sacrifices we had achieved nothing. I cannot
  understand how our Army, after fighting three great battles and being
  terribly weakened, was sent against a position which the enemy had prepared
  for three weeks; but naturally I know nothing of the intentions of our
  Chiefs.... They say nothing has been lost. In a word, we retired towards
  Cormontreuil and Reims by forced marches by day and night. We hear that three
  armies are going to get into line, entrench, rest, and then start afresh our
  victorious march on Paris. It was not a defeat, but only a strategic retreat.
  I have confidence in our Chiefs that everything will be successful. Our first
  battalion, which has fought with unparalleled bravery, is reduced from 1,200
  to 194 men. These numbers speak for themselves....</p>

  <p>Amongst minor happenings of interest are the following&mdash;</p>

  <p>During a counter-attack by the German 53rd Regiment on portions of the
  Northampton and Queen's Regiments on Thursday, the 17th, a force of some 400
  of the enemy were allowed to approach right up to the trench, occupied by a
  platoon of the former regiment, owing to the fact that they had held up their
  hands and made gestures that were interpreted as signs that they wished to
  surrender. When they were actually on the parapet of the trench held by the
  Northamptons they opened fire on our men at point-blank range.</p>

  <p>Unluckily for the enemy, however, flanking them and only some 400 yards
  away there happened to be a machine-gun manned by a detachment of the
  "Queen's." This at once opened fire, cutting a lane through their mass, and
  they fell back to their own trench with great loss. Shortly afterwards they
  were driven further back with additional loss by a battalion of the Guards
  which came up in support.</p>

  <p>An incident which occurred some little time ago during our retirement is
  also worthy of record. On August 28, during the battle fought by the French
  along the Oise, between La Fère and Guise, one of the French Commanders
  desired to make an air reconnaissance. It was found, however, that no
  observers were available. Wishing to help our Allies as much as possible, the
  British officer attached to this particular French Army volunteered to go up
  with a pilot to observe.</p>

  <p>He had never been in an aeroplane, but he made the ascent and produced a
  valuable reconnaissance report. Incidentally he had a duel in the air at an
  altitude of 6,000 ft. with the observer of a German Taube monoplane which
  approached. He fired several shots and drove off the hostile aeroplane. His
  action was much appreciated by the French.</p>

  <p>In view of the many statements being made in the Press as to the use of
  Zeppelins against us, it is interesting to note that the Royal Flying Corps,
  who have been out on reconnaissances on every day since their arrival in
  France, have never seen a Zeppelin, though airships of a non-rigid type have
  been seen on two occasions. Near the Marne, late one evening, two such were
  observed over the German forces. Aeroplanes were despatched against them, but
  in the darkness our pilots were uncertain of the airships' nationality and
  did not attack. It was afterwards made clear that they could not have been
  French.</p>

  <p>A week later, an officer reconnoitring to the flank saw an airship over
  the German forces and opposite the French. It had no distinguishing mark and
  was assumed to belong to the latter, though it is now known that it also must
  have been a German craft. The orders of the Royal Flying Corps are to attack
  Zeppelins at once, and there is some disappointment at the absence of those
  targets.</p>

  <p>The enemy is still maintaining himself along the whole front; and in order
  to do so is throwing into the fight detachments composed of units from very
  different formations&mdash;the Active Army, the Reserve, and the
<i>Landwehr</i>&mdash;as is
  shown by the uniforms of the prisoners recently captured. Our progress,
  although slow, on account of the strength of the defensive positions against
  which we are pressing, has in certain directions been continuous.</p>

  <p>But the present battle may well last for some days more before a decision
  is reached, since, in truth, it now approximates somewhat to siege warfare.
  The Germans are making use of searchlights, and this fact, coupled with their
  great strength in heavy artillery, leads to the supposition that they are
  employing material which may have been collected for the siege of Paris.</p>

  <p>The nature of the general situation after the operations of the 18th, the
  19th, and the 20th of September cannot better be summarized than as expressed
  by a neighbouring French Commander to his Corps&mdash;</p>

  <p>Having repulsed repeated and violent counterattacks made by the enemy...
  we have the feeling that we have been victorious.</p>

  <p>So far as the British are concerned, the course of events during these
  three days can be described in a few words. During Friday, September 18,
  artillery fire was kept up intermittently by both sides during daylight. At
  night the Germans counter-attacked certain portions of our line, supporting
  the advance of their infantry, as always, by heavy bombardment; but the
  strokes were not delivered with any great vigour and ceased about 2 a.m.</p>

  <p>During the day's fighting an anti-aircraft gun of the 3rd Army Corps
  succeeded in bringing down a German aeroplane. News was received also that a
  body of French cavalry had demolished part of the railway to the north, so
  cutting&mdash;at least temporarily&mdash;one line of communication which is of
  particular importance to the enemy.</p>

  <p>On Saturday, the 19th, the bombardment was resumed by the Germans at an
  early hour, and continued intermittently under reply from our own guns. Some
  of their infantry advanced from cover, apparently with the intention of
  attacking, but on coming under fire they retired. Otherwise the day was
  uneventful except for the activity of the artillery, which is now a matter of
  normal routine rather than an event. Another hostile aeroplane was brought
  down by us; and one of our airmen succeeded in dropping several bombs over
  the German lines, one incendiary bomb falling with considerable effect on a
  transport park near La Fère.</p>

  <p>A buried store of the enemy's munitions of war was also found not far from
  the Aisne, ten wagon-loads of live shell and two wagons of cable being dug
  up; and traces were discovered of large quantities of stores having been
  burnt, all tending to show that so far back as the Aisne the German
  retirement was hurried. There was a strong wind during the day, accompanied
  by driving rain, and this militated against aerial reconnaissance.</p>

  <p>On Sunday, the 20th, nothing of importance occurred until the afternoon,
  when there was a break in the clouds and an interval of feeble sunshine,
  which, however, was hardly powerful enough to warm the soaking troops.</p>

  <p>The Germans took advantage of this brief spell of fine weather to make
  several separate counter-attacks against different points. These were all
  repulsed with loss to the enemy; but the casualties incurred by us were by no
  means light.</p>

  <p>In one section of our firing line the occupants of the trenches were under
  the impression that they heard a military band in the enemy's lines just
  before the attack developed. It is now known that the German infantry started
  their advance with bands playing. The offensive against one or two points was
  renewed at dusk with no greater success.</p>

  <p>The brunt of the resistance has naturally fallen upon the infantry. In
  spite of the fact that they have been drenched to the skin for some days and
  their trenches have been deep in mud and water, and in spite of incessant
  night alarms and of the almost continuous bombardment to which they have been
  subjected, they have on every occasion been ready for the enemy's infantry
  when the latter have attempted to assault, and they have beaten them back
  with great loss. Indeed, the sight of the <i>Pickelhauben</i> coming up has
  been a positive relief after the long trying hours of inaction under shell
  fire.</p>

  <p>The object of the great proportion of artillery the Germans employ is to
  beat down the resistance of their enemy by a concentrated and prolonged fire
  and to shatter their nerve with high explosives before the infantry attack is
  launched. They seem to have relied on doing this with us; but they have not
  done so, though it has taken them several costly experiments to discover this
  fact.</p>

  <p>From the statements of prisoners, indeed, it appears that they have been
  greatly disappointed by the moral effect produced by their heavy guns, which,
  despite the actual losses inflicted, has not been at all commensurate with
  the colossal expenditure of ammunition, which has really been wasted.</p>

  <p>By this it is not implied that their artillery fire is not good. It is
  more than good; it is excellent. But the British soldier is a difficult
  person to impress or depress, even by immense shells filled with high
  explosives which detonate with terrific violence and form craters large
  enough to act as graves for five horses. The German howitzer shells are eight
  to nine inches in calibre, and on impact they send up columns of greasy black
  smoke. On account of this they are irreverently dubbed "Coal-boxes," "Black
  Marias," or "Jack Johnsons" by the soldiers.</p>

  <p>Men who take things in this spirit are, it seems, likely to throw out the
  calculations based on loss of <i>moral</i> so carefully framed by the German
  military philosophers.</p>

  <p>A considerable amount of information about the enemy has by now been
  gleaned from prisoners. It has been gathered that our bombardment on the 15th
  produced a great impression. The opinion is also recorded that our infantry
  make such good use of the ground that the German companies are decimated by
  our rifle fire before a British soldier can be seen.</p>

  <p>From an official diary captured by the 1st Army Corps it appears that one
  of the German Corps contains an extraordinary mixture of units. If the
  composition of the other corps is at all similar it may be assumed that the
  present efficiency of the enemy's forces is in no way comparable with what it
  was when war commenced.</p>

  <p>The losses in officers are noted as having been especially severe. A
  brigade is stated to be commanded by a major, and some companies of the Foot
  Guards to be commanded by one-year volunteers, while after the battle of
  Montmirail one regiment lost fifty-five out of sixty officers.</p>

  <p>The prisoners recently captured appreciate the act that the march on Paris
  has failed and that their forces are retreating, but state that the object of
  this movement is explained by the officers as being to withdraw into closer
  touch with supports which have stayed too far in rear.</p>

  <p>The officers are also endeavouring to encourage the troops by telling them
  that they will be at home by Christmas. A large number of the men, however,
  believe that they are beaten. The following is an extract from one
  document&mdash;</p>

  <p>With the English troops we have great difficulties. They have a queer way
  of causing losses to the enemy. They make good trenches, in which they wait
  patiently. They carefully measure the ranges for their rifle fire, and they
  then open a truly hellish fire on the unsuspecting cavalry. This was the
  reason that we had such heavy losses.... According to our officers, the
  English striking forces are exhausted. The English people never really wanted
  war.</p>

  <p>From another source&mdash;</p>

  <p>The English are very brave and fight to the last man.... One of our
  companies has lost 130 men out of 240.</p>

  <p>The following letter, which refers to the fighting on the Aisne, has been
  printed and circulated to the troops*&mdash;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* An excellent idea, for the soldier at the front as a
  rule gets very little news of what is going on outside the range of his own
  operations.]</p>

  <p class="cp">Letter found on a German Officer of the 7th Reserve Corps.</p>

  <p class="first"><i>Cerny, S. of Loon, 17/9/14</i></p>

  <p class="firat">My dear parents, ... Our Corps has the task of holding the
  heights south of Cerny in all circumstances till, the 15th Corps on our left
  flank can grip the enemy's flank. On our right are other corps. We are
  fighting with the English Guards, Highlanders, and Zouaves. The losses on
  both sides have been enormous. For the most part this is due to the too
  brilliant French artillery. The English are marvellously trained in making
  use of the ground.* One never sees them, and one is constantly under fire.
  The French airmen perform wonderful feats. We cannot get rid of them. As soon
  as an airman has flown over us, ten minutes later we get their shrapnel fire
  in our position. We have little artillery in our corps; without it we cannot
  get forward.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* i.e. in taking cover.]</p>

  <p>Three days ago our division took possession of these heights, dug itself
  in, etc. Two days ago, early in the morning, we were attacked by immensely
  superior English forces (one brigade and two battalions), and were turned out
  of our positions; the fellows took five guns from us. It was a tremendous
  hand-to-hand fight. How I escaped myself I am not clear. I then had to bring
  up supports on foot (my horse was wounded, and the others were too far in
  rear). Then came up the Guard Jäger Battalion, 4th Jäger, 65th Regiment,
  Reserve Regiment 13, <i>Landwehr</i> Regiments 13 and 16, and, with the help
of the
  artillery, drove back the fellows out of the position again.</p>

  <p>Our machine-guns did excellent work. The English fell in heaps.</p>

  <p>In our battalion three Iron Crosses have been given, one to the C.O., one
  to the Captain, one to the Surgeon. Let us hope that we shall be the lucky
  ones next time.... During the first two days of the battle I had only one
  piece of bread and no water, spent the night in the rain without my
  greatcoat. The rest of my kit was on the horses, which have been left miles
  behind with the baggage (which cannot come up into the battle), because as
  soon as you put your nose out from behind cover the bullets whistle. The war
  is terrible. We are all hoping that the decisive battle will end the war, as
  our troops have already got round Paris.</p>

  <p>If we first beat the English, the French resistance will soon be broken.
  Russia will be very quickly dealt with, of this there is no doubt. We
  received splendid help from the Austrian heavy artillery at Maubeuge. They
  bombarded Fort Cerfontaine in such a way that there was not ten metres of
  parapet which did not show enormous craters made by shells. The armoured
  turrets were found upside down.</p>

  <p>Yesterday evening about 6 p.m., in the valley in which our reserves stood,
  there was such a terrible cannonade that we saw nothing of the sky but a
  cloud of smoke. We had few casualties.</p><br>

  <p>Amongst items of news are the following. Recently a pilot and observer of
  the Royal Flying Corps were forced by a breakage in the aeroplane to descend
  in the enemy's lines. The pilot managed to "pancake" his machine down to
  earth, and the two escaped into some thick undergrowth in a wood. The enemy
  came up and seized the smashed machine, but did not search for our men with
  much zeal. The latter lay hid till dark and then found their way to the
  Aisne, across which they swam, reaching camp in safety but barefooted.</p>

  <p>Numerous floating bridges have by now been thrown across the Aisne, and
  some permanent bridges repaired, under fire. On the 20th a lieutenant of the
  3rd Signal Company, Royal Engineers, was unfortunately drowned whilst
  attempting to swim across the river with a cable in order to open up fresh
  telegraph communication on the north side.</p>

  <p>Espionage is still carried on by the enemy to a considerable extent.
  Recently the suspicions of some French troops were aroused by coming across a
  farm from which the horses had not been removed. After some search they
  discovered a telephone which was connected by an underground cable with the
  German lines; and the owner of the farm paid the penalty usual in war for his
  treachery.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Something similar was discovered during the siege of
  Maubeuge. All counter-attacks made by the French were forestalled by the
  enemy, and it was then discovered that a subterranean telephone existed
  between the house of a spy in the town and the German position outside.]</p>

  <p>After some cases of village fighting which occurred earlier in the war it
  was reported by some of our officers that the Germans had attempted to
  approach to close quarters by forcing prisoners to march in front of them.
  The Germans have recently repeated the same trick on a larger scale against
  the French, as is shown by the copy of the order printed below. It is therein
  referred to as a "ruse"; but if that term be accepted, it is distinctly an
  illegal ruse.</p><br>

  <p>&mdash;&mdash; Army &mdash; September, 1914.</p>

  <p>General Staff.</p>

  <p>3rd Bureau.</p>

  <p>No.</p>

  <p>During a recent night attack the Germans drove a column of French
  prisoners in front of them.</p>

  <p>This action is to be brought to the notice of all our troops&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. In order to put them on their guard against such a dastardly ruse.</p>

  <p>2. In order that every soldier may know how the Germans treat their
  prisoners. Our troops must not forget that if they allow themselves to be
  taken prisoners the Germans will not fail to expose them to French
  bullets.</p>

  <p>(Signature of Commander.)</p><br>

  <p>Further evidence has now been collected of the misuse of the white flag
  and other signs of surrender during the action on the 17th, when owing to
  this one officer was shot. During the recent fighting also some German
  ambulance wagons advanced in order to collect the wounded. An order to cease
  fire was consequently given to our guns which were firing on this particular
  section of ground. The German battery commanders at once took advantage of
  the lull in the action to climb up their observation ladders and on to a
  haystack to locate our guns, which soon afterwards came under a far more
  accurate fire than any to which they had been subjected up to that time.</p>

  <p>A British officer who was captured by the Germans and has since escaped
  reports that while a prisoner he saw men who had been fighting subsequently
  put on Red Cross brassards. That the irregular use of the protection afforded
  by the Geneva Convention is not uncommon is confirmed by the fact that on one
  occasion men in the uniform of combatant units have been captured wearing the
  Red Cross brassard hastily slipped over the arm. The excuse given has been
  that they had been detailed after a fight to look after the wounded. It is
  reported by a cavalry officer that the driver of a motor-car with a
  machine-gun mounted on it, which he captured, was wearing the Red Cross.</p>

  <p>Full details of the actual damage done to the Cathedral at Reims will
  doubtless have been cabled home, so that no description of it is necessary.
  The Germans bombarded the Cathedral twice with their heavy artillery.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The destruction of Reims Cathedral was a deliberate
  act of vandalism. The excuse that the French were using the towers as points
  of observation does not hold water. The French generalissimo denies
  absolutely that the towers were even occupied by French observers.]</p>

  <p>One reason why it caught alight so quickly was that on one side of it was
  some scaffolding which had been erected for restoration work. Straw had also
  been laid on the floor for the reception of German wounded. It is to the
  credit of the French that practically all the German wounded were
  successfully extricated from the burning building. There was no justification
  on military grounds for this act of vandalism, which seems to have been
  caused by the exasperation born of failure, a sign of impotence rather than
  of strength.</p>

  <p>It is noteworthy that a well-known hotel not far from the Cathedral, which
  was kept by a German, was not touched.</p>

  <p>By the Editor</p>

  <p>I have attempted in the following account to give a word-picture of street
  fighting. I have been at pains to collect from various sources the incidents
  I have described, and the little story, whilst it is not given as an actual
  occurrence, describes faithfully if sketchily an event repeated a score of
  times along the allied line.</p>

  <p>It is such a line as you can only imagine made up of river and forest, of
  tree-clad rolling hills, of white patches of quarry, of strange little towns
  smoking sulkily.</p>

  <p>Well may they be sullen, roofless walls and whitely dusty half-towers, for
  the dead lie in indescribable attitudes in the streets&mdash;stark grey-
faced men
  staring up to the sky with eyes that see not.</p>

  <p>French and German lie here&mdash;the British coat did not get so far
east. His
  dead is laid in orderly fashion under neat mounds of earth with forage caps
  atop and little inscriptions written hastily upon the crosses which
  comradeship has set up to mark the place of their lonely sleep. These fussy
  British put away their dead quickly, for the dead are awful and solemn to
  see, and we must go into battle with <i>Tipperary</i> on our lips or the men
  lose their phlegmatic quality which is half their asset.</p>

  <p>But here blue coat has been in close touch with grey&mdash;rusty bayonets
stick
  out of men's chests and the stabber himself lies a few paces away, legs
  outstretched, shrunken hands, and cold blue fingers still gripping an
  invisible rifle. The Germans came into their town, looted it and went on
  their way. Then French cavalry came cautiously and rode its horses through
  side streets, then came blue coat infantry, marching stolidly and humming a
  boulevard tune, then the guns&mdash;very business-like&mdash;and they all
disappeared
  at the far end of the village, over a grey little bridge. So the village
  remained untenanted save for stray cats. I call it village though they speak
  proudly of "la ville"&mdash;at least they spoke in the days when there was
  occasion for pride.</p>

  <p>You may picture this village on a hot day in September set in the fold of
  the hills to the right of Soissons looking northward. Near by the Aisne moves
  peaceably through meadows, skirting dark green woods, with here and there a
  moored barge testifying to its commercial value.</p>

  <p>The town is made up of long streets connected by crooked side
  thoroughfares. The two centre streets are the market and the business
  streets, and in the very centre of the town is a hoary old church, where
  generations of the townsfolk have worshipped. It looks for all the world like
  an ancient fortress with its thick walls and smooth buttresses.</p>

  <p>Market street is closed and silent. Some of the doors have been wrenched
  from their hinges, and the stock lies in confusion in the darkened interior.
  A few windows have been smashed, but in the main the town has been
  uninjured.</p>

  <p>This is the town of X, deserted of citizens, that the last rearguard of
  French infantry leaves behind.</p>

  <p>There are guns going soon ... distant "bom-bom!" of artillery, rattling
  growls of musketry. You see nothing, only the placid countryside and a
  suggestion of movement on the white road over the hill to the north. Then the
  guns grow louder and more insistent, a puff of smoke over the ridge, another
  and another. Shrapnel&mdash;and at a knowing range. Now the blue coats are
coming
  back but in no hurry. You see them from the edge of the village in a ragged
  line, slowly, slowly, moving from cover to cover. Haystack, farm building,
  barn, house wall, heap of stones&mdash;anything which offers protection for
the
  body and rest for the rifle.</p>

  <p>But if the infantry move reluctantly, the guns are coming back at full
  speed. Down the hill at breakneck speed, whips cracking, wheels skidding,
  limber and gun swaying from one side of the road to the other, a tearing mad
  rush, that brings them through the main street and out the other side before
  you realize that it is coming. And there is reason for hustle. Overhead like
  a clap of thunder a great shell bursts and shrapnel scatters down to the
  paved streets. Again and again and yet again, not a second interval between
  the shells.</p>

  <p>"Smash!"</p>

  <p>The belfry of the old church has been struck and massive and shapeless
  blocks of stone begin to fall with curious deliberation, as though each great
  morsel was choosing the place where it would lie.</p>

  <p>"Bang&mdash;whurr!"</p>

  <p>Like the sound of an express train moving through an enclosed station the
  whole wall of the church comes rumbling to earth.</p>

  <p>Blue coats are in the streets now, swinging through and scarcely raising
  eyes to see the havoc the enemy's shells are wreaking. Tramp, tramp,
  tramp&mdash;they are gone. Then more blue coats, but these are alert and
watchful.
  They face about at the end of the village street, draw a handy wagon across
  the road, pile all manner of obstacles and, crouching low behind, open fire
  at the grey coats which have appeared on the road outside the village. Then a
  machine gun comes into action.</p>

  <p>Grey coat has a gun in position on the hill ... two shots wreck the wagon
  and send blue coats scampering up the street. Here they stand again,
  fighting, firing desperately.</p>

  <p>Grey coat has reached the northern end. He comes in solid rank humming a
  guttural song bout his Fatherland. And now from one end of the street to the
  other swift messages of death are exchanged, the street is filled with
  whistling noises and the sobs of stricken men. The clean cobble stones are
  all mottled with blood and littered with sprawling shapes. In the midst of
  the firing comes a great savage cry. Blue coat is racing down the street with
  needle-pointed bayonet outstretched. Men go down swiftly, but the rest come
  on with that scream of hate and rage....</p>

  <p>Only for a brief moment are they locked together in a terribly fierce
  embrace of death ... grey coat breaks and runs with the French at his
  heels&mdash;more and more blue coats come up and out through the northern
end of
  the street&mdash;they reel, stabbing, shooting, smashing with butt end and
barrel
  till the street is clear again.</p>

  <p>Clear, save for little heaps of men who have died and little pitiable
  units who drag their painful limbs to the open doors of the looted shops to
  find sanctuary and quiet therein. But the village is on fire. Big billows of
  choking smoke come rolling down the street. There is a fierce splutter and
  crackle, and the wounded must clear out the best way they can. The official
  report says:</p>

  <p>"The village of X was taken and retaken many times."</p>

  <p>And these fierce encounters, these hateful and deadly struggles are
  peculiar to no part of the line. From Belfort to Soissons it goes on all day
  and all the night; every day and every night. It is a monstrous and heroic
  thing. As bloody in its incidence as the most fearful hand-to-hand fighting
  of the Crusades.</p>

  <p>On the left where the yellow coats are you may sometimes see the same, but
  in the main the English line is all for rifle fire. It is a terrifying fire,
  because it comes from nowhere. Blue coat knows where his enemy is, because he
  can see his shrapnel raking the trenches, but of yellow coat he sees nothing.
  Yellow coat is a cunning fighter. Yellow coat hides behind things&mdash;they
say
  he can cover himself with a blade of grass. "He works the ground most
  wonderfully," says one report&mdash;and that an officer of the enemy.</p>

  <p>He fights in his own peculiar way. It is a way they taught him in South
  Africa, in India. He learnt bits of it at Chitral, and bits at Modder River,
  and not a few tips he picked up on the Fox Hills, near Aldershot. He only
  knows one method of fighting, but he is willing to learn. Only he complains
  that the German has taught him nothing save the use to which a white flag may
  be put.</p>

  <p>His mind is equally divided at all times between two most important
  matters&mdash;the destruction of his enemy and his own comfort. If anything
has to
  give place it is the question of comfort. He has tremendous reserves of
  energy, and spends his time between repulsing the mad rushes of his enemy, in
  arguing with some bitterness as to the exact range of the enemy's
  position.</p>

  <p>Not that it makes any difference to him, because all his shooting is down
  at 500 yards&mdash;which is point blank.</p>

  <p>He grouses most when he is safest&mdash;in danger he is wonderfully
cheerful,
  with a penchant for sentimental songs. His shooting is wonderful&mdash;he
never
  misses his man and he never fires until he sees his man. If he does his
  section commander whispers insulting nothings into his red ear.</p>

  <p>Yellow coat thinks that he himself will take a bit of beating and he is
  confident that his officer is one of the most wonderful creations that
  mankind has ever witnessed.</p>

  <p>His officer returns the compliment and swears that Private Yellow Coat is
  a sealed pattern of all that a soldier should be. In every battalion is a
  French officer&mdash;an excellent idea, for Mr. Yellow Coat is very keen in
  showing the Frenchman what an excellent fellow he (Yellow Coat) is. There is
  swank in it, of course&mdash;but the right kind of swank. The soldiers of
the King
  fight all the better because of that critical eye.</p>

  <p>Yellow coat does his bayoneting too&mdash;swiftly and with little noise.
He has
  no great respect for grey coat as a bayonet fighter, believe me. He only
  respects him because grey coat is very brave in a dull, sheep-like way, and
  comes without fear in close formation to be butchered by the little rifles
  that make no smoke and are fired from God knows where.</p><br>

  <p>[This practically concludes the account of the operations from Mons to the
  Aisne. The battle of the Aisne, which had begun when the despatch was
  concluded, marks the second stage of the war.</p>

  <p>Although other writers may attempt in more elaborate language to tell the
  story of the heroic retreat and "return" nothing will surpass in clarity the
  vivid story which the despatches tell. When this narrative closed, the armed
  forces of the Empire were hastening to the support of the Motherland. From
  India, from Canada, from Australia, divisions and army corps were moving
  convoyed by the cruisers of the Royal Navy.</p>

  <p>Glorious as was the story of this first phase, the second should excel in
  splendour. For in Great Britain and Ireland, in response to the call of Lord
  Kitchener, more than half a million men were assembling, men of all ranks and
  stations of life, of all political colour, united by the need of the
  Empire.</p>

  <p>With "Kitchener's Army" rests the ultimate decision of the war&mdash;that
army
  was taking splendid shape when Sir John French made the last report in this
  volume. Our allies in France and in Belgium, no less than the mammoth forces
  in Russia, were performing heroic deeds in the defence of their liberties,
  and far south plucky little Servia was hammering the giant which had set
  forth to annihilate her nationality.</p>

  <p>This volume will be the first of a series, containing a chapter of Army
  history very agreeable to every Briton and every Irishman. It touches every
  phase of warfare, and shows our army under every possible condition. It
  presents the arms of the nation from gun to aeroplane, playing their splendid
  parts with unvarying excellence: it shows the soldier in retreat and the
  soldier on the offensive, and always the record is one for which we have
  reason to be proud and thankful.&mdash;Editor.]</p>

  <h3>GENERAL FRENCH'S TRIBUTE TO THE ARMY</h3>

  <p class="first">The following special order of the day by Sir John French
  pays eloquent tribute to the devotion of the British Army in the severe
  fighting which has been described.</p>

  <h3>SPECIAL ORDER OF THE DAY</h3>

  <p class="first">By Field-Marshal Sir John French, G.C.B., G.C.V.O.,
  K.C.M.G., Commander-in-Chief, British Army in the Field.</p>

  <p class="first"><i>September 17, 1914.</i></p>

  <p class="first">Once more I have to express my deep appreciation of the
  splendid behaviour of officers, noncommissioned officers, and men of the Army
  under my command throughout the great Battle of the Aisne, which has been in
  progress since the evening of the 12th inst. The Battle of the Marne, which
  lasted from the morning of the 6th to the evening of the 10th, had hardly
  ended in the precipitate flight of the enemy when we were brought face to
  face with a position of extraordinary strength, carefully entrenched and
  prepared for defence by an Army and a Staff which are thorough adepts in such
  work.</p>

  <p>Throughout the 13th and 14th that position was most gallantly attacked by
  the British Forces, and the passage of the Aisne effected. This is the third
  day the troops have been gallantly holding the position they have gained
  against the most desperate counter-attacks and a hail of heavy artillery.</p>

  <p>I am unable to find adequate words in which to express the admiration I
  feel for their magnificent conduct.</p>

  <p>The French Armies on our right and left are making good progress, and I
  feel sure that we have only to hold on with tenacity to the ground we have
  won for a very short time longer, when the Allies will be again in full
  pursuit of a beaten enemy.</p>

  <p>The self-sacrificing devotion and splendid spirit of the British Army in
  France will carry all before it.</p>

  <p>(Sd.) J.D.P. French, Field-Marshal.</p>

  <p>Commanding-in-Chief, the British Army in the Field.</p>

  <h2><a id="appA"
     name="appA"></a>APPENDIX A</h2>

  <p class="intro">The sullen cloud that hung over Britain was almost at
  breaking-point when Sir Edward Grey, on August 3, 1914, gave to the House of
  Commons his memorable presentation of the position of Great Britain at the
  outbreak of the war. The main points of his speech are here given.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT is clear that the peace of Europe cannot be preserved.
  Russia and Germany, at any rate, have declared war upon each other.</p>

  <p>We have consistently worked with a single mind, with all the earnestness
  in our power, to preserve peace. The House may be satisfied on that
  point.</p>

  <p>In the present crisis, it has not been possible to secure the peace of
  Europe; because there has been little time, and there has been a
  disposition&mdash;at any rate in some quarters on which I will not
dwell&mdash;to force
  things rapidly to an issue, at any rate to the great risk of peace, and, as
  we now know, the result of that is that the policy of peace as far as the
  Great Powers generally are concerned is in danger.</p>

  <p>I do not want to dwell on that, and to comment on it, and to say where the
  blame seems to us to lie, which Powers were most in favour of peace, which
  were most disposed to risk or endanger peace, because I would like the House
  to approach this crisis in which we are now from the point of view of British
  interests, British honour, and British obligations, free from all passion as
  to why peace has not been preserved.</p>

  <p>The present crisis has originated in a dispute between Austria and Servia.
  I can say this with the most absolute confidence&mdash;no Government and no
  country has less desire to be involved in war over a dispute with Austria and
  Servia than the Government and the country of France. They are involved in it
  because of their obligation of honour under a definite alliance with Russia.
  We are not parties to the Franco-Russian Alliance. We do not even know the
  terms of that alliance.</p>

  <p>I come to what we think the situation requires of us. For many years we
  have had a long-standing friendship with France. I remember well the feeling
  in the House&mdash;and my own feeling&mdash;for I spoke on the subject, I
think, when
  the late Government made their agreement with France&mdash;the warm and
cordial
  feeling resulting from the fact that these two nations, who had had perpetual
  differences in the past, had cleared these differences away; I remember
  saying, I think, that it seemed to me that some benign influence had been at
  work to produce the cordial atmosphere that had made that possible.</p>

  <p>But how far that friendship entails obligation&mdash;it has been a
friendship
  between the nations and ratified by the nations&mdash;how far that entails an
  obligation, let every man look into his own heart, and his own feelings, and
  construe the extent of the obligation for himself. I construe it myself as I
  feel it, but I do not wish to urge upon any one else more than their feelings
  dictate as to what they should feel about the obligation. The House,
  individually and collectively, may judge for itself. I speak my personal
  view, and I have given the House my own feeling in the matter.</p>

  <p>The French fleet is now in the Mediterranean, and the northern and western
  coasts of France are absolutely undefended.</p>

  <p>The French coasts are absolutely undefended. My own feeling is that if a
  foreign fleet, engaged in a war which France had not sought, and in which she
  had not been the aggressor, came down the English Channel and bombarded and
  battered the undefended coasts of France, we could not stand aside, and see
  this going on practically within sight of our eyes, with our arms folded,
  looking on dispassionately, doing nothing.</p>

  <p>I believe that would be the feeling of this country.</p>

  <p>But I want to look at the matter without sentiment, and from the point of
  view of British interests, and it is on that that I am going to base and
  justify what I am presently going to say to the House.</p>

  <p>If we say nothing at this moment, what is France to do with her fleet in
  the Mediterranean? If she leaves it there, with no statement from us as to
  what we will do, she leaves her northern and western coasts absolutely
  undefended, at the mercy of a German fleet coming down the Channel to do as
  it pleases in a war which is a war of life and death between them. If we say
  nothing, it may be that the French fleet is withdrawn from the
  Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>We are in the presence of a European conflagration; can anybody set limits
  to the consequences that may arise out of it?</p>

  <p>Let us assume that to-day we stand aside in an attitude of neutrality,
  saying, "No, we cannot undertake and engage to help either party in this
  conflict." Let us suppose the French fleet is withdrawn from the
  Mediterranean; and let us assume that the consequences&mdash;which are already
  tremendous in what has happened in Europe even to countries which are at
  peace&mdash;in fact, equally whether countries are at peace or at
war&mdash;let us
  assume that out of that come consequences unforeseen, which make it necessary
  at a sudden moment that, in defence of vital British interests, we should go
  to war.</p>

  <p>What will be our position then? We have not kept a fleet in the
  Mediterranean which is equal to dealing alone with a combination of other
  fleets in the Mediterranean. It would be the very moment when we could not
  detach more ships to the Mediterranean, and we might have exposed this
  country from our negative attitude at the present moment to the most
  appalling risk.</p>

  <p>I say that from the point of view of British interests. We feel strongly
  that France was entitled to know&mdash;and to know at once&mdash;whether or
not in the
  event of attack upon her unprotected northern and western coasts she could
  depend upon British support. In that emergency, and in these compelling
  circumstances, yesterday afternoon I gave to the French Ambassador the
  following statement&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"I am authorized to give an assurance that if the German
  fleet comes into the Channel or through the North Sea to undertake hostile
  operations against the French coasts or shipping, the British fleet will give
  all the protection in its power. This assurance is, of course, subject to the
  policy of His Majesty's Government receiving the support of Parliament, and
  must not be taken as binding His Majesty's Government to take any action
  until the above contingency of action by the German fleet takes place."</p>

  <p>I read that to the House, not as a declaration of war on our part, not as
  entailing immediate aggressive action on our part, but as binding us to take
  aggressive action should that contingency arise.</p>

  <p>Things move very hurriedly from hour to hour.</p>

  <p>Fresh news comes in, and I cannot give this in any very formal way; but I
  understand that the German Government would be prepared, if we would pledge
  ourselves to neutrality, to agree that its fleet would not attack the
  northern coast of France.</p>

  <p>I have only heard that shortly before I came to the House, but it is far
  too narrow an engagement for us.</p>

  <p>And there is the more serious consideration&mdash;becoming more serious
every
  hour&mdash;there is the question of the neutrality of Belgium.</p>

  <p>The governing factor of our position with Belgium is the treaty of 1839,
  but this is a treaty with a history&mdash;a history accumulated since. In
1870,
  when there was war between France and Germany, the question of the neutrality
  of Belgium arose, and various things were said. Amongst other things, Prince
  Bismarck gave an assurance to Belgium that&mdash;confirming his verbal
assurance,
  he gave in writing a declaration which he said was superfluous in reference
  to the treaty in existence&mdash;that the German Confederation and its allies
  would respect the neutrality of Belgium, it being always understood that that
  neutrality would be respected by the other belligerent Powers. That is
  valuable as a recognition in 1870 on the part of Germany of the sacredness of
  these treaty rights.</p>

  <p>The treaty is an old treaty&mdash;1839&mdash;and that was the view taken
of it in
  1870. It is one of those treaties which are founded, not only on
  consideration for Belgium, which benefits under the treaty, but in the
  interests of those who guarantee the neutrality of Belgium.</p>

  <p>When mobilization was beginning, I knew that this question must be a most
  important element in our policy. I telegraphed at the same time in similar
  terms to both Paris and Berlin to say that it was essential for us to know
  whether the French and German Governments respectively were prepared to
  undertake an engagement to respect the neutrality of Belgium. These are the
  replies. I got from the French Government this reply&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"The French Government are resolved to respect the
  neutrality of Belgium, and it would only be in the event of some other Power
  violating that neutrality that France might find herself under the necessity,
  in order to assure the defence of her security, to act otherwise. This
  assurance has been given several times. The President of the Republic spoke
  of it to the King of the Belgians, and the French Minister at Brussels has
  spontaneously renewed the assurance to the Belgian Minister of Foreign
  Affairs to-day."</p><br>

  <p>From the German Government the reply was&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs could not
  possibly give an answer before consulting the Emperor and the Imperial
  Chancellor."</p><br>

  <p>Sir Edward Goschen, to whom I had said it was important to have an answer
  soon, said he hoped the answer would not be too long delayed. The German
  Minister for Foreign Affairs then gave Sir Edward Goschen to understand that
  he rather doubted whether they could answer at all, as any reply they might
  give could not fail, in the event of war, to have the undesirable effect of
  disclosing, to a certain extent, part of their plan of campaign.</p>

  <p>We were sounded in the course of last week as to whether, if a guarantee
  were given that, alter the war, Belgian integrity would be preserved, that
  would content us. We replied that we could not bargain away whatever
  interests or obligations we had in Belgian neutrality.</p>

  <p>Diplomatic intervention took place last week on our part. What can
  diplomatic intervention do now?</p>

  <p>We have great and vital interests in the independence&mdash;and integrity
is
  the least part&mdash;of Belgium.</p>

  <p>If the independence of Belgium goes, the independence of Holland will
  follow.</p>

  <p>I ask the House from the point of view of British interests, to consider
  what may be at stake. If France is beaten in a struggle of life and death,
  beaten to her knees, loses her position as a great Power, becomes subordinate
  to the will and power of one greater than herself&mdash;consequences which I
do
  not anticipate, because I am sure that France has the power to defend herself
  with all the energy and ability and patriotism which she has shown so
  often&mdash;still, if that were to happen, and if Belgium fell under the same
  dominating influence, and then Holland, and then Denmark, then would not Mr.
  Gladstone's words come true, that just opposite to us there would be a common
  interest against the unmeasured aggrandisement of any Power?</p>

  <p>It may be said, I suppose, that we might stand aside, husband our
  strength, and that, whatever happened in the course of this war, at the end
  of it intervene with effect to put things right, and to adjust them to our
  point of view.</p>

  <p>If, in a crisis like this, we run away from those obligations of honour
  and interest as regards the Belgian treaty, I doubt whether, whatever
  material force we might have at the end, it would be of very much value in
  face of the respect that we should have lost.</p>

  <p>We are going to suffer, I am afraid, terribly in this war, whether we are
  in it or whether we stand aside.</p>

  <p>I do not believe for a moment, that at the end of this war, even if we
  stood aside and remained aside, we should be in a position, a material
  position, to use our force decisively to undo what had happened in the course
  of the war, to prevent the whole of the West of Europe opposite to us&mdash;if
  that had been the result of the war&mdash;falling under the domination of a
single
  Power, and I am quite sure that our moral position would be such as to have
  lost us all respect.</p>

  <p>I have read to the House the only engagements that we have yet taken
  definitely with regard to the use of force. I think it is due to the House to
  say that we have taken no engagement yet with regard to sending an
  expeditionary armed force out of the country.</p>

  <p>Mobilization of the fleet has taken place; mobilization of the army is
  taking place; but we have as yet taken no engagement, because I feel
that&mdash;in
  the case of a European conflagration such as this, unprecedented, with our
  enormous responsibilities in India and other parts of the Empire, or in
  countries in British occupation, with all the unknown factors&mdash;we must
take
  very carefully into consideration the use which we make of sending an
  expeditionary force out of the country until we know how we stand.</p>

  <p>I have told the House how far we have at present gone in commitments and
  the conditions which influence our policy, and I have put to the House and
  dwelt at length upon how vital is the condition of the neutrality of
  Belgium.</p>

  <p>What other policy is there before the House?</p>

  <p>There is but one way in which the Government could make certain at the
  present moment of keeping outside this war, and that would be that it should
  immediately issue a proclamation of unconditional neutrality.</p>

  <p>We cannot do that. We have made the commitment to France that I have read
  to the House which prevents us doing that. We have got the consideration of
  Belgium which prevents us also from any unconditional neutrality, and,
  without these conditions absolutely satisfied and satisfactory, we are bound
  not to shrink from proceeding to the use of all the forces in our power.</p>

  <p>If we did take that line by saying, "We will have nothing whatever to do
  with this matter" under no conditions&mdash;the Belgian treaty obligations,
the
  possible position in the Mediterranean, with damage to British interests, and
  what may happen to France from our failure to support France&mdash;if we
were to
  say that all those things mattered nothing, were as nothing, and to say we
  would stand aside, we should, I believe, sacrifice our respect and good name
  and reputation before the world, and should not escape the most serious and
  grave economic consequences.</p>

  <p>I do not for a moment conceal, after what I have said, and after the
  information, incomplete as it is, that I have given to the House with regard
  to Belgium, that we must be prepared, and we are prepared, for the
  consequences of having to use all the strength we have at any
moment&mdash;we know
  not how soon&mdash;to defend ourselves and to take our part.</p>

  <p>As far as the forces of the Crown are concerned, we are ready. I believe
  the Prime Minister and my right hon. friend the First Lord of the Admiralty
  have no doubt whatever that the readiness and the efficiency of those forces
  were never at a higher mark than they are to-day, and never was there a time
  when confidence was more justified in the power of the navy to protect our
  commerce and to protect our shores.</p>

  <p>We worked for peace up to the last moment, and beyond the last moment. How
  hard, how persistently, and how earnestly we strove for peace last week the
  House will see from the papers that will be before it.</p>

  <p>But that is over, as far as the peace of Europe is concerned. We are now
  face to face with a situation and all the consequences which it may yet have
  to unfold.</p>

  <p>I have put the vital facts before the House, and if, as seems not
  improbable, we are forced, and rapidly forced, to take our stand upon those
  issues, then I believe, when the country realizes what is at stake, what the
  real issues are, the magnitude of the impending dangers in the West of
  Europe, which I have endeavoured to describe to the House, we shall be
  supported throughout, not only by the House of Commons, but by the
  determination, the resolution, the courage and the endurance of the whole
  country.</p>

  <h2><a id="appB"
     name="appB"></a>APPENDIX B</h2>

  <p class="cp">Statement by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, August
  6, 1914.</p>

  <p class="first">MOTION made, and Question proposed, "That a sum, not
  exceeding £100,000,000, be granted to His Majesty, beyond the ordinary grants
  of Parliament, towards defraying expenses that may be incurred during the
  year ending March 31st, 1915, for all measures which may be taken for the
  security of the country, for the conduct of Naval and Military operations,
  for assisting the food supply, for promoting the continuance of trade,
  industry, and business communications, whether by means of insurance or
  indemnity against risk, or otherwise for the relief of distress, and
  generally for all expenses arising out of the existence of a state of
  war."</p>

  <p><i>The Prime Minister (Mr. Asquith)</i>.&mdash;In asking the House to
agree to
  the resolution which Mr. Speaker has just read from the Chair, I do not
  propose, because I do not think it is in any way necessary, to traverse the
  ground again which was covered by my right hon. friend the Foreign Secretary
  two or three nights ago. He stated&mdash;and I do not think any of the
statements
  he made are capable of answer and certainly have not yet been
answered&mdash;the
  grounds upon which, with the utmost reluctance and with infinite regret, His
  Majesty's Government have been compelled to put this country in a state of
  war with what, for many years and indeed generations past, has been a
  friendly Power. But, Sir, the papers which have since been presented to
  Parliament, and which are now in the hands of hon. Members will, I think,
  show how strenuous, how unremitting, how persistent, even when the last
  glimmer of hope seemed to have faded away, were the efforts of my right hon.
  friend to secure for Europe an honourable and a lasting peace. Every one
  knows, in the great crisis which occurred last year in the East of Europe, it
  was largely, if not mainly, by the acknowledgment of all Europe, due to the
  steps taken by my right hon. friend that the area of the conflict was
  limited, and that, so far as the great Powers are concerned, peace was
  maintained.</p>

  <p>If his efforts upon this occasion have, unhappily, been less successful, I
  am certain that this House and the country, and I will add posterity and
  history, will accord to him what is, after all, the best tribute that can be
  paid to any statesman: that, never derogating for an instant or by an inch
  from the honour and interests of his own country, he has striven, as few men
  have striven, to maintain and preserve the greatest interest of all
  countries&mdash;universal peace.</p>

  <p>The papers which are now in the hands of hon. Members show something more
  than that. They show what were the terms which were offered to us in exchange
  for our neutrality. I trust that not only the Members of this House, but all
  our fellow-subjects everywhere will read the communications, will read, learn
  and mark the communications which passed only a week ago to-day between
  Berlin and London in this matter.</p>

  <p>The terms by which it was sought to buy our neutrality are contained in
  the communication made by the German Chancellor to Sir Edward Goschen.</p>

  <p>I think I must refer to them for a moment. After referring to the state of
  things as between Austria and Russia, Sir Edward Goschen goes
on:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p>"He then proceeded to make the following strong bid for British
  neutrality. He said that it was clear, so far as he was able to judge the
  main principle which governed British policy, that Great Britain would never
  stand by and allow France to be crushed in any conflict there might be. That,
  however, was not the object at which Germany aimed. Provided that neutrality
  of Great Britain were certain, every assurance would be given to the British
  Government that the Imperial Government "&mdash;Let the House observe these
  words&mdash;"aimed at no territorial acquisition at the expense of France
should
  they prove victorious in any war that might ensue."</p>

  <p>Sir Edward Goschen proceeded to put a very pertinent question:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I questioned His Excellency about the French colonies"&mdash;What are the
  French colonies? They mean every part of the dominions and possessions of
  France outside the geographical area of Europe&mdash;"and he said that he was
  unable to give a similar undertaking in that respect."</p>

  <p>Let me come to what, in my mind, personally, has always been the crucial,
  and almost the governing consideration, namely, the position of the small
  states:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"As regards Holland, however, His Excellency said that so long as
  Germany's adversaries respected the integrity and neutrality of the
  Netherlands, Germany was ready to give His Majesty's Government an assurance
  that she would do likewise."</p>

  <p>Then we come to Belgium:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It depended upon the action of France what operations Germany might be
  forced to enter upon in Belgium, but, when the war was over, Belgian
  integrity would be respected if she had not sided against Germany."</p>

  <p>Let the House observe the distinction between those two cases. In regard
  to Holland it was not only independence and integrity but also neutrality;
  but in regard to Belgium there was no mention of neutrality at all, nothing
  but an assurance that after the war came to an end the integrity of Belgium
  would be respected. Then His Excellency added:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ever since he had been Chancellor the object of his policy had been to
  bring about an understanding with England. He trusted that these assurances
  "&mdash; the assurances I have read out to the House&mdash;"might form the
basis of
  that understanding which he so much desired."</p>

  <p>What does that amount to? Let me just ask the House. I do so, not with the
  object of inflaming passion, certainly not with the object of exciting
  feeling against Germany, but I do so to vindicate and make clear the position
  of the British Government in this matter. What did that proposal amount to?
  In the first place, it meant this: That behind the back of France&mdash;they
were
  not made a party to these communications&mdash;we should have given, if we had
  assented to that, a free licence to Germany to annex, in the event of a
  successful war, the whole of the extra-European dominions and possessions of
  France.</p>

  <p>What did it mean as regards Belgium? When she addressed, as she has
  addressed in these last few days, her moving appeal to us to fulfil our
  solemn guarantee of her neutrality, what reply should we have given? What
  reply should we have given to that Belgian appeal? We should have been
  obliged to say that, without her knowledge, we had bartered away to the Power
  threatening her our obligation to keep our plighted word.</p>

  <p>Belgians are fighting and losing their lives. What would have been the
  position of Great Britain to-day in the face of that spectacle, if we had
  assented to this infamous proposal? Yes, and what are we to get in return for
  the betrayal of our friends and the dishonour of our obligations? What are we
  to get in return? A promise&mdash;nothing more; a promise as to what Germany
would
  do in certain eventualities; a promise, be it observed&mdash;I am sorry to
have to
  say it, but it must be put upon record&mdash;given by a Power which was at
that
  very moment announcing its intention to violate its own treaty and inviting
  us to do the same. I can only say, if we had dallied or temporized, we, as a
  Government, should have covered ourselves with dishonour, and we should have
  betrayed the interests of this country, of which we are trustees. I am glad,
  and I think the country will be glad, to turn to the reply which my right
  hon. friend made, and of which I will read to the House two of the more
  salient passages. Sir Edward Grey said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"His Majesty's Government cannot for a moment entertain the Chancellor's
  proposal that they should bind themselves to neutrality on such terms. What
  he asks us in effect is to engage to stand by while French Colonies are taken
  if France is beaten, so long as Germany does not take French territory as
  distinct from the Colonies. From the material point of view "&mdash;My right
hon.
  friend, as he always does, used very temperate language&mdash;"such a
proposal is
  unacceptable, for France, without further territory in Europe being taken
  from her, could be so crushed as to lose her position as a Great Power, and
  become subordinate to German policy."</p>

  <p>That is the material aspect. But he proceeded&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Altogether, apart from that, it would be a disgrace for us to make this
  bargain with Germany at the expense of France, a disgrace from which the good
  name of this country would never recover. The Chancellor also in effect asks
  us to bargain away whatever obligation or interest we have as regards the
  neutrality of Belgium. We could not entertain that bargain either."</p>

  <p>He then says&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We must preserve our full freedom to act, as circumstances may seem to us
  to require."</p>

  <p>And he added, I think, in sentences which the House will
appreciate&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You should ... add most earnestly that the one way of maintaining the
  good relations between England and Germany is that they should continue to
  work together to preserve the peace of Europe.... For that object this
  Government will work in that way with all sincerity and good will.</p>

  <p>"If the peace of Europe can be preserved and the present crisis safely
  passed, my own endeavour will be to promote some arrangement to which Germany
  could be a party, by which she could be assured that no aggressive or hostile
  policy would be pursued against her or her allies by France, Russia, and
  ourselves, jointly or separately. I have desired this and worked for
it"&mdash;The
  statement was never more true&mdash;"as far as I could, through the last
Balkan
  crisis, and Germany having a corresponding object, our relations sensibly
  improved. The idea has hitherto been too Utopian to form the subject of
  definite proposals, but if this present crisis, so much more acute than any
  that Europe has gone through for generations, be safely passed, I am hopeful
  that the relief and reaction which will follow may make possible some more
  definite rapprochement between the Powers than has been possible
  hitherto."</p>

  <p>That document, in my opinion, states clearly, in temperate and convincing
  language the attitude of this Government. Can any one who reads it fail to
  appreciate the tone of obvious sincerity and earnestness which underlies it;
  can any one honestly doubt that the Government of this country in spite of
  great provocation&mdash;and I regard the proposals made to us as proposals
which
  we might have thrown aside without consideration and almost without
  answer&mdash;can any one doubt that in spite of great provocation the right
hon.
  Gentleman, who had already earned the title&mdash;and no one ever more
deserved
  it&mdash;of Peace Maker of Europe&mdash;persisted to the very last moment of
the last
  hour in that beneficent but unhappily frustrated purpose?</p>

  <p>I am entitled to say, and I do so on behalf of this country&mdash;I speak
not
  for a party, I speak for the country as a whole&mdash;that we made every
effort
  any Government could possibly make for peace. But this war has been forced
  upon us. What is it we are fighting for? Every one knows, and no one knows
  better than the Government, the terrible incalculable suffering, economic,
  social, personal and political, which war, and especially a war between the
  Great Powers of the world, must entail.</p>

  <p>There is no man amongst us sitting upon this bench in these trying
  days&mdash;more trying perhaps than any body of statesmen for a hundred
years have
  had to pass through, there is not a man amongst us who has not, during the
  whole of that time, had clearly before his vision the almost unequalled
  suffering which war, even in a just cause, must bring about, not only to the
  peoples who are for the moment living in this country and in the other
  countries of the world, but to posterity and to the whole prospects of
  European civilization. Every step we took we took with that vision before our
  eyes, and with a sense of responsibility which it is impossible to
  describe.</p>

  <p>Unhappily, if&mdash;in spite of all our efforts t# keep the peace, and with
  that full and overpowering consciousness of the result, if the issue be
  decided in favour of war&mdash;we have, nevertheless, thought it to be the
duty as
  well as the interest of this country to go to war, the House may be well
  assured it was because we believe, and I am certain the country will believe,
  we are unsheathing our sword in a just cause.</p>

  <p>If I am asked what we are fighting for, I reply in two sentences. In the
  first place to fulfil a solemn international obligation, an obligation which,
  if it had been entered in between private persons in the ordinary concerns of
  life, would have been regarded as an obligation not only of law but of
  honour, which no self-respecting man could possibly have repudiated. I say,
  secondly, we are fighting to vindicate the principle which, in these days
  when force, material force, sometimes seems to be the dominant influence and
  factor in the development of mankind, we are fighting to vindicate the
  principle that small nationalities are not to be crushed, in defiance of
  international good faith, by the arbitrary will of a strong and
  over-mastering Power. I do not believe any nation ever entered into a great
  controversy&mdash;and this is one of the greatest history will ever
know&mdash;with a
  clearer conscience and stronger conviction that it is fighting not for
  aggression, not for the maintenance even of its own selfish interest, but
  that it is fighting in defence of principles, the maintenance of which is
  vital to the civilization of the world.</p>

  <p>With a full conviction, not only of the wisdom and justice, but of the
  obligations which lay upon us to challenge this great issue, we are entering
  into the struggle. Let us now make sure that all the resources, not only of
  this United Kingdom, but of the vast Empire of which it is the centre, shall
  be thrown into the scale, and it is that that object may be adequately
  secured, that I am now about to ask this Committee&mdash;to make the very
unusual
  demand upon it&mdash;to give the Government a Vote of Credit of
  £100,000,000....</p>

  <p>... In all that I have said, I believe I have not gone, either in the
  statement of our case or in my general description of the provision we think
  it necessary to make, beyond the strict bounds of truth. It is not my
  purpose&mdash;it is not the purpose of any patriotic man&mdash;to inflame
feeling, to
  indulge in rhetoric, to excite international animosities. The occasion is far
  too grave for that.</p>

  <p>We have a great duty to perform, we have a great trust to fulfil, and
  confidently we believe that Parliament and the country will enable us to do
  it.</p>
