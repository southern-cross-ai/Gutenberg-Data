<h2>A CONTEMPORARY REVIEW OF<br>
    "BRAVE EMPLOYMENTS"</h2>

<h3><i>The Spectator</i>, 18 April 1931, Page 37</h3>

<p class="first">
ONCE again Miss Bowen has maintained our trust in her as a
writer of sound historical romance, a painstaking chronicler and a
wizard who can clothe dead bones anew. This time she takes for her
theme the upheavals in Ireland during the years 1689-1691,
beginning with the arrival of King James II at Kinsale Harbour. It
is, so far as dressed-up history ever can be, an honest record.
Miss Bowen permits herself various surmises for the story's sake.
For instance, she produces a motive for the murder of the notorious
Henry Luttrell, whose death has always mystified historians.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say which is the best of this long but never
tedious book, its fact or its fiction. There are some excellent
character studies of King James, of Patrick Sarsfield, Earl of
Lucan, in whose valour the Irish maintained faith until his "flight
of wild geese" carried their hope away. Luttrell, Lord Galmoy and
D'Avaux are also well portrayed. But, to the common reader, the
chief interest of the book, apart from the picture it contains of
distressed, seething and turbulent Ireland, lies in its love story.
The Sarsfield, re-created by Miss Bowen, is a great and fastidious
lover. There were three women in his life. The first of these was
an almost symbolical figure, the spirit of Ireland herself, who was
introduced to him by a Shanahus, or story teller. The second woman
was Olivia Joyce, who married the Marquis de Bonnac and followed
him to Ireland because she hankered after Sarsfield whom she had
rejected. The third was Sarsfield's cold little wife. Miss Bowen
allows these three to play their parts in and out of the story, to
add relief to the records of history, and to supply a plot within
the great plot of warfare. Her method is most successful, and her
book deserves to be read both as a novel and a minor study of Irish
character. &mdash; <span class="smcap">B.E.T.</span></p>

<h2><a name="ch0" id="ch0"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="first">
The following <i>apologia</i> for the historical novel was made
nearly a hundred years ago by the French critic, Mons. P.
Douhaire:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"The alliance of history and fiction has nothing of the hybrid;
it is universal and as old as the world. It is the essence of an
epoch, the reality of the past made poetical. The active fecundity
of our imaginations has need of a base and it is in the past it
loves to take it...we all like to remake the world and the society
of other times. This is the charm that we find in history; it is a
feast where we satisfy our imagination. We each of us make in some
degree an historical novel when we open the pages of the
historians; for we fill in, according to our own fashion, the
outline they trace."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">
THE author of the following narrative can think of nothing better
as an excuse or explanation of the feelings about a type of fiction
that is frequently misunderstood and undervalued, and of the spirit
in which this novel has been attempted.</p>

<p>While errors of fact have been carefully avoided and the genuine
circumstances of history as carefully followed, this is a novel in
design and detail and makes no pretensions to be more.</p>

<p>No more need be said here than that all historical personages
mentioned (including Lord Galmoy, Colonel Henry Luttrell and
Galloping O'Hogan) are drawn according to what is known of their
characters.</p>

<p>The spelling of the Irish proper names makes no pretension to be
accurate; the usual English forms have been used throughout; nor,
as the story concerns people of various nationalities, has there
been any attempt to reproduce dialects or the manner of speech
actually employed by the many foreigners who passed through Ireland
in 1689-91.</p>

<p>For those readers who like to know something of the material
used by the historical novelist a brief appendix is affixed; the
author, in venturing on a subject that still provokes such bitter
controversy, feels it prudent, if not necessary, to give some
authorities for the view point taken and the incidents used.<br>

<h2><a name="ch00" id="ch00"></a>PROLOGUE</h2>

<p class="poem">IRRELAGH, 1680<br>
<br>
"Where is the glory of thy sires?<br>
The glory of Art with the swift arrow;<br>
Of Meilitan, with the swift darting spears;<br>
Of the lordly race of the O'Neil?<br>
To thee belonged red victory,<br>
When the Fenian wrath was kindled,<br>
And the heroes in thousands rode to war,<br>
And the bridles clanked on he steeds..."<br>
<br>
&mdash;"Old Bardic Lament", from the Irish.</p>
<br>

<p class="poem">
"I have heard some Great Warriors say,<br>
that in all the services which they had seen in foreign<br>
countries they never saw a more comely man than an Irishman,<br>
nor one that cometh more bravely to his charge."<br>
<br>
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Edmund Spenser</span>.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">HE suddenly saw her as an enemy.</p>

<p>"You are Irish yourself, mademoiselle, it is strange that you do
not understand."</p>

<p>"But I do&mdash;a faery tale." Olivia Joyce did not care to be under
the imputation of belonging to the defeated, the subject race.
"I've no claim to be Irish, though; 'tis centuries since the Joyces
left Connemara, Captain Sarsfield."</p>

<p>"More is the pity, and that Ireland should be alien to one
bearing your name."</p>

<p>"Why, so it is, and barbarous, too, and I'll be glad to return
to London."</p>

<p>She smiled, to humour him; she was not fine enough to sense that
he felt her as hostile; he had been bred in Paris, trained in the
French wars, polished at Whitehall; she did not believe that his
wretched country could mean much to him.</p>

<p>"So you'll not marry me?"</p>

<p>"No. And you can understand why."</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>"My father would tell you. He looks higher than a younger son, a
gentleman of the King's Guard, a landless man!"</p>

<p>She affected to sigh romantically; she did regret the loss of
this ardent lover, but she was cold and prudent; she preferred the
fine, safe marriage her family were negotiating for her; she
intended to go no further with this delightful coquetry he had
taken too seriously.</p>

<p>"Tell me some more tales of your kingdom of Kerry." She smiled,
enticing as a spread flower.</p>

<p>"I will not, since you believe none of them." He looked at her
unsmilingly. "Do you refuse me because I am Irish, Olivia?"</p>

<p>"You are too downright. There is every obstacle between us. And
I do not care for you enough to do anything foolish for your sake,
Captain Sarsfield."</p>

<p>"You will never do anything foolish for the sake of any
man."</p>

<p>He had been acquainted with her since they were children. He
knew her indifference to human passions and human dreams. Yet had
never ceased to desire to possess her with a perversity that was at
once his torment and his delight.</p>

<p>He thought: "Why does she not like me enough?"</p>

<p>This was the first time they had been together in Ireland;
chance had brought the young officer to his brother's demesne at
Lucan where he had heard that Olivia Joyce was reluctantly visiting
some of her mother's kin near Kenmare. When he had crossed Ireland
to see her, she had welcomed him; she found the wet summer
dull.</p>

<p>Now this interlude was over; she had refused him, he would go,
she would return to London, then to Paris where her marriage with
the Marquis de Bonnac would be concluded. Convention was heavy over
both of them.</p>

<p>"It is raining again." She gazed out of the window, past trees,
the wide, distant lake, mountains silvered with vapour, at a sky
crossed with rainbows that leapt from peak to peak. "It is a
mournful country, I do not know how people can live here."</p>

<p>"There are some who wonder how those who have Irish blood can
live away. God knows, I count myself an exile!"</p>

<p>He considered her sadly, his usual gaiety overclouded, it was
easy to see that she really was an enemy; descendant of renegades
who had long since forsaken the ancient land to fawn on the
conqueror. She was of mixed blood too, cold English, hard French,
daughter of the merchants and the traders, yet to him lovely as a
rose carved in snow, with her features of infantile purity, her
fine locks of silver-gold, the exquisite delicacy of her shape.
Perhaps her small mouth, so richly coloured, had already too firm a
line, perhaps the gold-brown eyes had too calculating a gleam;
perhaps, to the cynic and the experienced, her early youth gave
promise of a future cold voluptuousness, wanton and heartless, but
she was beautiful enough to Patrick Sarsfield who was a man who
must have a goddess.</p>

<p>"Will you come with me to the Abbey of Irrelagh this evening?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"To see a ruin and an old woman and, maybe, a ghost?"</p>

<p>"To say a charm with me under the ancient yew, Olivia, my
darling, one that will bind us all our lives, whether you will or
no."</p>

<p>His presence and his persistence shook her; her blood strove
against her training; she was convent-bred, cautious and dutiful,
ignorant, unawakened beneath her city manners, only twenty years
old; she was determined on the grand marriage that meant a rich
court life, but she quivered at the caress in the voice of this
rejected suitor. The rain was pale at the window; the silent house
was desolate.</p>

<p>"I go back to London to-morrow," she sighed; "the long journey
is hateful, but I shall be glad to be away from Ireland."</p>

<p>"Come to Irrelagh this evening. I'll show you the wonders you
laugh at, and you'll not laugh. The yew there is a thousand years
old, the quiet woman knows much magic, or maybe I could row you out
to Innisfallen, and there's the world well forgot."</p>

<p>"I could not come."</p>

<p>"You could. They leave you quite free. It is not far away."</p>

<p>She considered him, feature by feature. There was an uneasy stir
in her liking for him that had been so serene; almost she was
troubled. She regretted his magnificence, she felt jealous as she
realised the other women who would gladly take this love she could
not accept, she felt baulked by destiny and cheated by convention.
The rainbows were brilliant beyond the rain. He opened the window
and she saw him outlined against the radiance and moisture. He was
of great height and strength, yet slim and flexible and not many
years older than herself. She liked his clear brow with the thick
fair hair, red as scorched flax, his noble outline&mdash;liked his
well-shaped, full mouth, and the alertly-open gray eyes, his broad
shoulders and slender hips. She liked the bravery of the King's
Gentlemen which he wore so easily; she liked his strong hands and
full throat, and the Irish turn in his speech, persistent through
long exile. She inclined towards him, but she did not forget her
admired father's judgment of this Patrick Sarsfield&mdash;"Reckless,
thriftless, without influence or the gifts that make success,
penniless...a younger son."</p>

<p>Fear and fascination opposed each other in her mind; his eyes
grew heavy with meaning as, full of lightness and grace, he came
back from the window; she had more beauty in his regard then than
she would ever really possess. She saw the rainbows behind his head
as he bent directly to her face.</p>

<p>"You'll come to Irrelagh this evening?"</p>

<p>A strong tremor ran through her yielding limbs; she knew that
this was the end of playing with him, and she mourned the loss of a
flattering amusement. She winced before the brilliant eyes so near,
she sank beneath the warm lips pressed on hers, he held her close
and she felt useless, helpless in the circle of his strength.</p>

<p>But her carefully-trained virtue asserted itself; she rejected
the natural warmth that moved her, she refused to lose herself in
this unworldly love, she chilled his tide of passion by her
resistance. As he was very proud, he put her by...</p>

<p>To be rid of him and her own blind emotion, she said:&mdash;"I will
come to Irrelagh this evening."</p>

<p>When he had gone she was ashamed of the heat in her blood, she
almost hated him for disturbing her coolly ordered life.</p>

<p>The young man frequently looked back at the flat damp-stained
façade of the mansion of the MacCarthys; through the swaying gray
boughs of the dripping ash-tree and the lush lawn, he could long
see the brightness of her spruce town dress at the wide window.</p>

<p>To him she was innocent and sweet as she was lovely; he could
not see her as hard, ambitious, mercenary, petty-minded, though he
disdained these faults in the stock from which she came; her
nobility, like her beauty, lay largely in his generous fancy; she
was no more than a pretty young woman, finely shaped.</p>

<p>Even her contempt of Ireland and her laughter at what she called
his superstition, he forgave her; but in London he had been in two
brawls with Englishmen who had sneered at his country, and his
shoulder sometimes ached from a thrust got in a duel provoked by
some insult to his despised island.</p>

<p>He lodged in a peasant's hut near the lake edge; he had only a
few days before he must return to London; he put that out of his
mind. He envied his elder brother who might live at Lucan on the
estates; never before the visit had he known how dear Ireland was,
how desolate and how hopeless. He realised that he was capable of
two passions, each full of stimulation and inspiration&mdash;one for
Olivia Joyce, one for Ireland.</p>

<p>The country opened about him generous with an unbelievable
beauty; the deep solitude was flooded with a golden light that
glanced sparkling in the misty rain; the distant peaks showed azure
and violet against heavy veils of pure, tender vapour which
glittered with raindrop hues. Changing shadows passed over the
surface of the lake, ruffling the waters from silver to purple. All
was warm, exotic, drowsy, the ferns and grasses clustered in rich
tangles gemmed with drops of moisture, starred with prodigal
flowers expanding in the damp heat. The smooth stems and dark
glossy leaves of the arbutus waved in groves of extravagant
loveliness. Patrick Sarsfield had not seen this tree before. He
felt moved at this hidden exotic exceeding beauty that was the
beauty of Ireland, which no one praised. So opulent and warm was
the scene that he did not notice the loneliness.</p>

<p>At sunset he was in Irrelagh Abbey expecting Olivia Joyce; his
very soul surged towards her in expectation. His romantic mind
endowed her with all the beauty of the Ireland that she disliked.
This moment made all his life that had gone before&mdash;the soldiering,
the city days, the repetition of commonplace&mdash;seem utterly trivial,
a wastage of time.</p>

<p>The woman he had met before at Irrelagh was seated in the ruins;
she had told him she was a Shanahus, a story-teller, descendant of
the bards or historians attached to the great sept of O'Donaghoe,
Princes of Kerry. But it was the MacCarthys, Princes of Desmond,
who had built the abbey; the Franciscans it had housed had long
vanished; pious hands had repaired it two generations ago, but it
now stood in desolate decay, surrounded by gravestones and dense
groves of ash, oak and sycamore.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield passed through the roofless nave; thick
fragrant weeds grew between the stones that covered the vaults
where lay the dust of kings. Mural tablets showed the stately arms
and coronets of MacCarthy Mór, Glencare and the last of the
O'Donaghoes. Above the gray altar waved ash saplings, long trails
of dark, glossy ivy garlanded the porch. There was a perpetual
sound of the wind sighing in the trees and long grasses, and
through the empty belfry.</p>

<p>The young man joined the Shanahus in the gray marble cloisters.
She sat under one of the moss-covered arches with her beads in her
hands. Her dress and shawl were gray-green as the abbey stones, and
her face was as expressionless as one of the saint-like masks
mouldering above the pillars. She wore a hare's skin cap over a red
kerchief tied under her chin.</p>

<p>"Good-evening to your honour."</p>

<p>"Good-evening to you, Shanahus. I have come to meet a fair
woman, and you must give me the charm that will bind us for this
world and the next. For, humanly speaking, she is denied to
me."</p>

<p>"And what fair woman should be denied to your honour and you
fine as King Finvarra? And like one of the Sidhe yourself with your
red sash and the gold band on your hat."</p>

<p>"I've neither land nor money, Shanahus, nor careful arts. I've
nothing at all but the blood of Conn of the race of Rory and of
Rory O'More. And they are dead and the splendour of them, and this
is a good place to remember it." He smiled across the gray arches
to the overgrown graves which marked where the proud, the
disinherited, the forgotten rested.</p>

<p>In the centre of the garth grew a yew tree, so mighty and
spreading that the trunk was like a pillar, and the boughs touched
the four walls of the cloisters. There was no tree more famous in
Ireland; to profane it was damnation, to pluck a leaf carelessly
was death. In the twilight the shade was black beneath the yew
tree. The Shanahus peered there with searching eyes.</p>

<p>"Does your honour think Ireland is dead, and the last Prince of
O'Donaghoe, murdered by the English, resting beneath us? You can
see Castle Ross hollow to the moonlight, but the O'Donaghoe will
rise every year and ride across the lake on his white horse. What
can your honour see beneath the yew tree? The Phouca waiting, or
the horned women making their spells?"</p>

<p>"I can see nothing but dark shadows, Shanahus. Teach me the
charm that I may learn how to bind my beloved."</p>

<p>The gray woman looked at him wistfully; yearning, vague and
unsatisfied were her eyes. She was a peasant, a beggar, but she
roused in the young man an emotion enthusiastic, passionate,
infinitely mournful; the shadow of great unattainable glories and
losses fell over his spirit; the foreboding of useless sorrow
darkened his heart. Without speaking he leant against the damp gray
pillar of the cloister, the tips of the flat, black yew boughs
touched his braided shoulder-knot. In his strength and fairness,
with his red and gold, his air of noble candour, he looked indeed
like one of the Princes of the Sidhe, who will never know death nor
immortality, but who flourish in their beauty and splendour, till
on the Last Day they vanish utterly.</p>

<p>"The finest charm I could give your honour and the kindest,"
said the Shanahus, "would be the power to hear the harp of the
unseen people."</p>

<p>"And what benefit would I get from that?"</p>

<p>"Forgetfulness you would get. All the old memories of the race
of Conn that torment you would be still. And you would not be able
to guess the future that is coming to you."</p>

<p>"Is it evil, then, the future?"</p>

<p>"Evil it is not." The Shanahus stooped and plucked a long trail
of ground ivy. "Hold this as a safeguard against the Evil One. It
is bold to recite charms by the yew of Saint Bridget."</p>

<p>He smiled as he took the small, firm, shining sprig; he feared
that Olivia Joyce would not come, and all the magic and beauty of
this evening be lost like rare, cherished wine spilled on the
common ground.</p>

<p>She was fearful and town-bred and foreign; he was sorry that he
loved her, he felt hostile towards her and drawn with sudden
passion to this sad spot of earth. Through the blackness of the yew
he could see the misty sapphire brilliancy of twilight. The
Shanahus recited, as she turned her beads, the glories of the royal
house of O'Donaghoe. Great they had been and beautiful, slain in
their pride, the earth lay on their white breast-bones and the
foxglove grew on their mouldering hearths. Ross Castle was open to
the dews and winds of heaven, and the empty lakes lay desolate
beneath the bare hills of the Kingdom of Kerry.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield felt the company of the dead gathered close
about him in the shade of the great yew. Very ancient the tree was
and unutterable the legends that enfolded it. Some said that is was
from the very heart of Saint Bridget herself that it grew.</p>

<p>"The fair woman is coming," said the Shanahus. "The Merciful
word, the Singing word, and the Good word&mdash;may the power of these
be on all the men of Ireland!"</p>

<p>The young man startled; his heart beat hot and magnificent. A
stately gold flashed behind the yew, the final sunburst coloured
the darkened land. The graves were outlined in shadow and the
raindrops glittered like fire on the rank leaves of wild flowers
and the lush grasses heavy with moisture. In this transient light
the Shanahus appeared withered and small like a bat, like the
mocking Phouca itself. She pointed down the cloisters where the
gold air could not penetrate. There in the shadows, dense and
heavy, stood the woman.</p>

<p>She had disguised herself with care. A gown of gray drugget
concealed her form, the linen kerchief tied round her chin was
pulled forward to muffle her face. Without speaking she passed
under the black boughs of the yew into the heart of the shadow.</p>

<p>The last light of the sun faded, the blue darkness, swift as the
stroke of a wing, fell over the ruins of Irrelagh.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield followed into the dense shade of the yew. In
the dark hollow under the boughs he and the woman stood side by
side. She put out her hand to him and he was profoundly touched
that she had come. He drew her cold hand to his heart and felt a
deep wave of excited joy suffuse his being. At that moment his
whole life was vowed to her service.</p>

<p>In his warm eager voice, that no sensitive ear could listen to
with indifference, he repeated the charm the Shanahus had taught
him.</p>

<p>"By the power that Christ brought from Heaven mayest thou love
me, woman! As the sun follows its course, mayest thou follow me. As
light to the eye, as bread to the hungry, as joy to the heart, may
thy presence be with me, O woman that I love, till death comes to
put us asunder!"</p>

<p>Quick and soft she answered him:</p>

<p>"This is a charm I set for love; a woman's charm of love and
desire, a charm of God none can break. You for me and I for you,
and none else. Your face to mine and your head turned from all
others!"</p>

<p>These whispering husky tones were strange to him; he caught hold
of her and drew her swiftly through the black boughs. The sharp
foliage brushed against them. When he had her unresisting in the
gray cloisters he plucked the kerchief from her head. The twilight
showed him a stranger in his arms.</p>

<p>Dark eyes looked up at him, dusky hair fell on his sleeve, a
creature who was in all different from Olivia Joyce smiled at him
with beseeching tenderness.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield felt the keen humiliation of one fooled by his
own romantical dreaming; he set the girl from him and turned
bitterly to the Shanahus.</p>

<p>"Belike I deserve this for meddling with old wives' trumpery,
but what is at the bottom of your trick?"</p>

<p>"It is your honour who is tricked," replied the Shanahus coolly,
"not to know the woman of your heart when you hold her. How long
have you lived in exile, Patrick Sarsfield, that you have let
yourself be deceived by the daughter of the enemy?"</p>

<p>He looked at the young girl who still leant against the gray
marble cloisters; even through his disappointment, his disillusion,
something in his blood responded to the fantastic moment, he
thought of dark childhood tales of the unseen people, of the Sidhe
who sometimes visit the earth to draw mortals into their invisible
world of delight and damnation.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Look on me," she replied. "Can you love me? Every time you have
come to the lake edge or walked in the ruins I have followed you.
Could you not join your fate to mine?"</p>

<p>He strove to put aside the sense of strangeness that overpowered
him almost to faintness.</p>

<p>"You are unknown to me, and it must be that you speak in mockery
or folly."</p>

<p>The Shanahus rose; she seemed angry, her eyes sparkled under the
shade of her hare-skin cap.</p>

<p>"Would you pledge yourself to the cold foreign woman of the mean
soul and the narrow heart? Do not the Sidhe hate the niggard hand
and the bargaining tongue? Would you turn your back on your own
people for the foreigner? This is Ishma O'Donaghoe who has waited
for you since she was cradled in the ruins of Ross Castle. Is she
not fitted for you, royal and fair, lover of music and song, and
noble pleasures?"</p>

<p>The girl moved forward from the deeper shadows, but it was now
so dusk that she seemed but a cloud wraith.</p>

<p>"Did the Shanahus mistake," she sighed, "when she told me you
wished to say the love charm with me?"</p>

<p>He knew she was beautiful and graceful. Her voice was full of a
soft, enticing melancholy; all the passionate qualities of his race
responded to her; all the extravagance of dreams ever creating
incredible passion and glory, all the fantastic belief in wonder,
all the deep yearning towards the mystic, the unseen, that had
always been hidden in him, overlaid by the limitations of his
commonplace life, rose in his baffled heart, and almost he could
have accused these two of bewitching him, almost he could have
believed they belonged to the lost race of the Sidhe. He crossed
his breast and fixed his mind on Olivia Joyce.</p>

<p>"We meet and part as strangers," he sighed painfully.</p>

<p>Instantly the girl turned and walked away down the cloisters,
huddling her dark shawl over her head. In a moment she had
disappeared among the graves. A louder sigh came from the ash trees
and the tall grasses as the wind rose across the shivering
lake.</p>

<p>The Shanahus slipped her hands into her bosom.</p>

<p>"It is a pity that a grand gentleman like your honour should try
to mock the power of God. But the charm is said and will not be
broken not even when one of you lies beneath the hawthorn by the
Holy Porch, and the other far away under sods the strangers have
turned."</p>

<p>The warm, soft dark was about him like a charm indeed. He made a
movement to follow the girl, but missed his way; when he turned
about, the Shanahus had gone or was hiding from him in the
interlacing shadows.</p>

<p>He was alone in the ruins of Irrelagh. He had thought to sit
here with Olivia Joyce waiting for the moon that was to guide them
home. Safe in her bed, contemptuous of him and his love, she would
be watching the crescent rise through the ash trees on the lawn. He
sat on a gravestone and took his head in his hands. He thought of
the woman who had come in place of Olivia Joyce. He had rejected
her; but these were his people and this was his place; he yearned
towards them in a mute longing. He found nothing fantastical in the
episode and the charm he had uttered, and her reply seemed to be
repeated in the sighing of the ash trees over the altar stone, in
the murmur of the grasses on the graves.</p>

<p>When the moon had mounted through wraiths of blown, hurrying
clouds, and cast an uncertain light over the ruins of Irrelagh, the
young man rose and returned through the groves of arbutus to the
cottage by the lake's edge. Wet ferns brushed against his knees,
the scent of night flowers was in his nostrils. The quivering lake
was pallid beneath the moon clouds and purple dark of the woods of
Innisfallen.</p>

<p>The owner of the hut where he lodged had returned from fishing;
he was cooking salmon over a fire of arbutus wood, the glowing
light of the flames fell over Patrick Sarsfeld as he paused, and
the Kerryman looked at him in a great admiration. In this race,
only he may be King who is strong and beautiful, splendid and
gentle.</p>

<p>The peasant would have been happy to give his life for this
noble gentleman.</p>

<p>"Is there a woman lives here or near who is named Ishma
O'Donaghoe?"</p>

<p>"There is not. Has not your honour seen the graves of them in
Irrelagh, and they slain by the English?"</p>

<p>The smoke was blown across the lake and mingled with the
moonshine. Swift veils of fine cloud confused the glittering
radiance of light on sky and water. The smoke from the arbutus wood
vanished, as did the sense of the meeting and parting in Irrelagh.
A trick put on him by a cunning peasant who had thought him
credulous. But she had not asked nor waited for money.</p>

<p>The young man gazed across the lake to the moon-misted hills.
All his life the truth of his heart and soul had been repressed. In
dry routine, in serving foreigners, in learning their manners and
their catchwords, in loving one of their daughters, his powers had
been laid waste.</p>

<p>And he would return to the dulling round of commonplace;
Irrelagh, the whispered charm beneath the black yew, the Shanahus
and the girl who had asked, "Could you love me?" would be but
fragments of a thwarted vision.</p>

<p>His nature, ardent, sensitive, enthusiastic, did not resent the
play of the Shanahus. There had been something lovely in the
mockery. In the warm breath of the secret young woman had been,
maybe, the spell to connect him with all from which he had been
exiled so long&mdash;Ireland herself, desolate, forsaken, captive.</p>

<p>He wished to put up a little prayer for many things, but his
heart was heavy. All night he watched by the shores of the lake.
The wind grew more lusty in the arbutus, the ash and the oak, yet
remained but a gentle sound. The warm rain fell on the soft mosses
and lush grasses. In his gold-corded, scarlet coat Patrick
Sarsfield rested among the tall, strong ferns, in the shelter of
the waving sycamore. Sometimes the moonbeams struggled through the
mournful vapours, the thick boughs, and fell on his face, pale and
finely shaped with the upcurling locks of flaxen red and the wide
gray eyes heavy with defeated slumber.</p>

<p>In her warm bed in the old mansion of the MacCarthys Olivia
Joyce woke to listen to the drifts of rain through the ash trees on
the lawn.</p>

<p>She was pleased that she had been able to resist a childish
impulse to go to Irrelagh. She wished she could forget his kiss.
His mouth was soft and finely shaped, and his breath had had a
perfume of health and the pure air. She moved her limbs uneasily
beneath the coverlets, she hoped she would never see him again. She
tried to think of the lean, dark face of the man she was pledged to
marry. As the moonlight cast vague beams on to her bed she hid from
them beneath the sheet. Comfortable and dreamless, she slept.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
When Patrick Sarsfield came to the quiet shadowed house in the
morning he found she had gone. He did not follow her; his
loneliness was inexpressible.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-1" id="ch1-1"></a>ONE</h2>

<p class="first">
PATRICK SARSFIELD leant on the gilt rail of the French ship and
watched, through glowing gleams of rain, the coast of Ireland; the
distant hills of Cork, dimmed by the soft, swiftly-moving clouds
which passed across their summits, showed, even behind the straight
March rain, with that tender azure he had seen in no other country.
The long, gray, racing waves of the sea parted round the noble ship
as she turned into the bay past the grim promontory of the harbour
with the bleak outline of Fort Charles in the east; spray and rain
wetted the Irishman's clear pale face and his thick, strong, fair
hair blown stiffly behind him as he stood bareheaded on the
poop.</p>

<p>He thought:</p>

<p>"That is my country and I am a man in the best of his years with
some power and authority, maybe some gifts of strength and wit.
What can I do for Ireland?"</p>

<p>He considered his youth and early manhood spent in foreign
service, carrying the Lilies of France behind Turenne, or wearing
the gold and scarlet of a gentleman of His Majesty's Guard. He yet
wore that uniform, for he believed his chance had come to serve
Ireland, and emotion, almost impossible to suppress, possessed him
as the sombre, rocky coast showed nearer through the mist; above
the ship loomed the old Head of Kinsale, with the desolate ruins of
Duncearma Castle; hawks and sea eagles flew through the rain to
their high rocky eyries; pallid beams of sunlight fell aslant the
misty, moving vapours that blurred the grand outline of the purple
cliffs of Cork and Waterford.</p>

<p>Nearly ten years had passed since Patrick Sarsfield had last
looked on these hills; they seemed then ten empty years of waiting.
He recalled the ruins of Irrelagh and the night he had spent beside
the ashes of the arbutus fire on the banks of the lake, the black
yew and a strange girl whom he had never seen before or since, and
with whom he had exchanged a love-charm. He smiled at the
persistency of his own folly in remembering such futility, yet he
knew that this smile was but an assumed sophistication resulting
from the routine of his ordinary life, and not touching his wild
and secret heart, his deep and fantastic beliefs.</p>

<p>The decks of the magnificent French man-of-war were crowded with
men straining for a first glance of Ireland. Some few were exiles
returning, but most were foreigners and, of them all, only Patrick
Sarsfield was lost in single-hearted love for the land at which he
looked. These weeping skies, these dark secret bays, jutting crags,
and lonely stretches of lofty hills, even the chill, blue pearly
light which penetrated all the drifting rain and was, to Patrick
Sarsfield, so lovely, seemed alien and desolate to these strangers,
forbidding to the exiles used to foreign comfort.</p>

<p>Count d'Avaux, who represented the French king, shivered into
his mantle. He was an elderly man, a civilian, of refined habits,
his thin blood soon ran cold. He smiled at his companion, the
Marshal Konrad de Rosen.</p>

<p>"It looks forbidding, I had hardly supposed so grim a
coast."</p>

<p>De Rosen replied, in his gruff, off-hand manner:</p>

<p>"No matter for the land, my dear Count, it's the people who
concern me."</p>

<p>He spoke with feeling, for he was in charge of nearly five
hundred captains, lieutenants, cadets and gunners who were to train
the Irish kerns and squireens into an efficient army not only able
to hold their own island, but if need should be, to undertake an
invasion of Scotland.</p>

<p>De Rosen, rude, violent tempered, but able and experienced,
wished he had a convoy of ships behind him with ten thousand
Frenchmen. He gloomed at the prospect of raising his army from this
country which he believed was half-barbarous. He glanced doubtfully
and shrewdly at Lieutenant-General Maumont and Brigadier Pusignan
who, wrapped in their greatcoats, were silently leaning against the
rail. They were regarding the coast of Ireland with inscrutable
eyes, and De Rosen knew that their thoughts were the same as
his&mdash;suspicious, discontented, disdainful.</p>

<p>"I wish," he grumbled half to himself, "I knew more of the
Irish."</p>

<p>"The Irish gentlemen," remarked D'Avaux, "are of the finest
material in the world. Consider Colonel Sarsfield&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He has been bred in France, he has served France, and for
years. I take him to be almost a Frenchman."</p>

<p>D'Avaux replied quietly with his dry, precise air:</p>

<p>"Indeed you make a vast mistake, Marshal. Colonel Sarsfield is
nothing but an Irishman, and I dare swear that, of all those in
this ship, he alone has no thought of self-interest. I shall do my
utmost," he added abruptly, "to have him made Brigadier."</p>

<p>De Rosen shrugged, pulling his cockaded hat across his broad
brow, for the driving rain was strong.</p>

<p>"I have not noticed," he replied, "that he has more than
ordinary ability, and it is against my principles to give high
commands to foreigners."</p>

<p>D'Avaux insisted, with some emphasis:</p>

<p>"Use all the material you have, my dear De Rosen, all the
material you have! If you can find honesty, and patriotism, and
enthusiasm, and sincerity&mdash;well, make the most of them. You will
find them as useful qualities for your purpose as paid jobbery or
hired knavery. Colonel Sars 'd," added the old minister, "was the
only one of His Majesty's Guards who remained faithful to him&mdash;the
only one, mark you, my dear Marshal."</p>

<p>"That," replied De Rosen, "might set him down merely as a
simpleton, and, indeed, I take him to be a visionary, one with
fantastic notions about loyalty and patriotism; I do not know, my
dear Count, that I have great use for such a man."</p>

<p>"But, I take it, Marshal," the diplomat reminded the soldier
dryly, "that you yourself are actuated by principles of honour and
loyalty."</p>

<p>"But you and I serve France&mdash;" De Rosen checked himself with a
shrug. "How can you make such a comparison&mdash;France and this
miserable island?"</p>

<p>"Yet perhaps, my dear De Rosen, to Patrick Sarsfield this
miserable island means the same as France to us." But he recalled
that his companion was a Livonian. He lightly touched the Marshal's
arm to point his words. "And since we are forced, my dear De Rosen,
to use this barbarous, boggy rock and its inhabitants, let us make
the most of men like Patrick Sarsfield. Trust me, I have observed
him well. Look at him now and tell me if there is not an asset
there?"</p>

<p>The two glanced covertly at the Irishman who was oblivious of
them and every one else on the ship. He stood apart from all, and
even to the dry, professional insensibility of De Rosen, there was
something touching in his isolation, his self-absorption, and in
the magnificence of his appearance; the force of his splendid
presence would have impressed in any company.</p>

<p>"Certainly," admitted De Rosen, "he would look well at the head
of an army."</p>

<p>"The Irish people may think so," commented D'Avaux. "He is
descended, I believe, through his mother, from some of their
mythical champions, and it is very likely he will arouse in them an
enthusiasm which we shall find useful."</p>

<p>De Rosen did not reply. He intended to have no rivals, least of
all an Irish rival, in this mission with which his king had
entrusted him. To him it was quite intolerable that an Irishman
should be put on a level with a French officer in any post. He
wondered at D'Avaux's championship of Patrick Sarsfield.</p>

<p>"Keep him a colonel," he said at length abruptly, "see what use
he is in recruiting men; I hear he has come into his estates
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By his brother's death," replied D'Avaux, "I believe he has
some rich lands and a fine fortune. You may be sure it will all be
dedicated to His Majesty's cause. But it is the man himself, not
his money, who will be most useful to us."</p>

<p>Again they keenly and cautiously considered the Irishman with
the eyes of traders ruminating over a piece of merchandise.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield, then about thirty-four years of age, was far
above the common height and had that aspect of noble candour and
heroic enthusiasm which is one of the most valuable qualities in a
leader of men. This was given by the ease and grace of his
carriage, an air of radiance that came from his thick, upspringing,
richly-curling flaxen-red hair, the healthy pallor of his
finely-shaped face, and the wide, clear alertly-open eyes which
were something of the azure gray hue of his native skies; he had
great charm, vitality and a look of incomparable distinction.</p>

<p>De Rosen, bred in a court where personal appearance was a ready
passport to fortune, conceded:</p>

<p>"It is a pity he is not a Frenchman&mdash;or a Russian."</p>

<p>The high, violet hills, with low clouds blowing about them like
tattered banners, darkened the bay with purple shadows as the
French vessel, burnished gold through the pure mist, steered for
Kinsale. Above the crow's-nest fluttered the blue and silver
elegance of the Bourbon flag and the hot, tawny, yellow and
vermilion of the Royal Arms of England.</p>

<p>Count d'Avaux made his way cautiously across the wet deck to
where Patrick Sarsfield leant, his face towards the encroaching
darkness of the Irish hills.</p>

<p>"This must be an agreeable home-coming for you, Colonel
Sarsfield?"</p>

<p>The Irishman started, and almost painfully, for he was sunk in a
reverie and had forgotten time and place, but on seeing the little
Frenchman, he instantly smiled with his ready good humour which was
entirely without artifice or calculation.</p>

<p>"Agreeable? Indeed I do not know, monseigneur." He spoke French
with cultured ease, but to D'Avaux he was all Irish as he stood
there outlined in the moist and shifting light against the purple
azure Irish horizon. "I have great hopes surely, for I see that
there is much to be done."</p>

<p>"And you should be the man to help us do it," smiled D'Avaux.
"We, too, have great hopes and in you, Colonel Sarsfield."</p>

<p>"I'll do what I can for the King and for Ireland."</p>

<p>D'Avaux's smile deepened as he noted how the last three words
had been spoken unconsciously.</p>

<p>"I intend," he said, "to use all my influence to have you made
Brigadier."</p>

<p>Sarsfield faintly flushed. He was not personally ambitious but
avid for some scope in which to prove his powers.</p>

<p>"Indeed, monseigneur, I had hardly looked for that."</p>

<p>"You undervalue yourself." The Frenchman spoke with gracious
kindness. "You allow yourself to be jostled by more presumptuous
men. Your service has been very distinguished and, believe me," he
added, "I at least know how to prize a probity and honour without
stain."</p>

<p>Sarsfield, by breeding and nature exquisitely sensitive, did not
know how to answer this. He almost winced before what seemed
flattery, but D'Avaux added in a tone which took all offence from
his commendations:</p>

<p>"Believe me, my dear Colonel, we are surrounded by men bat-blind
to those words: 'probity and honour.' I represent His Majesty King
Louis. I stand for his interests and nothing else, as you, I
believe, stand for Ireland and nothing else."</p>

<p>"I should not have put it so boldly," murmured Sarsfield. He put
his hand to his cheek which was wet with rain.</p>

<p>"No, you have grown accustomed to other loyalties. Your
allegiance is to King James, that for the moment jumps with your
own secret desires. Pray do not think me prying, Colonel Sarsfield,
but too well I know the rarity of men like you. Look to me for
friendship and support."</p>

<p>"Can I make use of them?" asked Sarsfield wistfully. "I know not
yet what I can do for any man, even for myself. It is true I have
my brother's estates, the Manor of Lucan, some two thousand a year,
but I am not of the position of my Lords Mountcashel or
Galmoy."</p>

<p>"But you will be more important. Pray realise that in this ship
we have a few trained officers, three generals, a certain amount of
ammunition and money&mdash;equipment for an army; all else is to be
found in Ireland, a country of which we none of us know much."</p>

<p>"Ireland will give of her all, monseigneur, no doubt."</p>

<p>D'Avaux smiled. "But I have spent my life at court, in
diplomacy, I know the difficulties of bringing even an ordinary
task to a conclusion, and this is no ordinary task, my dear
Colonel, but the setting on his throne again of a king who is,
between you and me, detested in his own country and has all Europe,
except France, against him. We have also," added D'Avaux in a
confidential tone, "to deal with men of varying nationalities,
ambitions and honesties. His Britannic Majesty himself will never
be either energetic or popular."</p>

<p>"Why," asked Sarsfield candidly, "do you put these obstacles
before me?"</p>

<p>D'Avaux replied instantly:</p>

<p>"Because I see, perhaps, what no one else in this expedition
will see, that we shall have to rely on men like you who understand
the Irish."</p>

<p>He turned away abruptly and joined a group of French officers
pacing the upper deck. The wind shouted in the flapping wet sails,
the sailors strained at the creaking cordage; Patrick Sarsfield
glanced up at the two flags which straggled out with difficulty
against the rain in a wan gleam of sun&mdash;the flag of France, the
flag of England, but where, he thought, the flag of Ireland? He was
conscious, as never before, of being surrounded by self-interested
foreigners and aliens meaning to use him and his country for their
own ends. Had not the old man warned him of as much just now?
Wishing to use him, to gain his friendship, his confidence, for his
own ends? He had been clever enough to see that he, an Irishman,
cared for Ireland. He had pounced on that proud, hidden patriotism
as another factor in the game for France.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield, watching Kinsale come into view, knew that he
cared nothing at all for France and nothing at all for England, and
nothing at all for King James praying in the cabin below. But that
he cared everything for this chance to redeem Ireland from the yoke
that pressed so heavily on her galled shoulders.</p>

<p>"He said that I understand them, that I might have
influence...Suppose I had such influence?"</p>

<p>The mist lifted in long shreds, showing the dark trees, the pale
cleft valleys, the little poor dwellings, the distant lonely
grandeur of the hills. An unreasoning love of this hushed ancient
land shook him; he felt stupid before his own emotion. The years
had passed and he had done nothing save sometimes weep a little in
his heart for Ireland, sometimes pray for Ireland in an alien
church. The years had passed.</p>

<p>"One must die or grow old and what will have been done? Is this
a chance? Can I do anything?"</p>

<p>There had been something, Sarsfield thought, easily contemptuous
behind the Frenchman's graceful courtesy; he wished to use every
possible material for the aggrandisement of France; he was playing
a fine, difficult game for his master; he looked upon the Irish as
an ignorant, credulous rabble who must be made to serve their
turn.</p>

<p>Sarsfield's superb glance rested on the widely extended outline
of the noble bay. He held out his hand through the chill purity of
the vaporous rain. A sea hawk, stern and beautiful, swooped near
his open fingers and his drenched laces.</p>

<p>The shouts of the French sailors, bringing the ship to anchor
cut across the lawless cries of the ocean birds.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-2" id="ch1-2"></a>TWO</h2>

<p class="first">
FITFUL gusts of soft wind drove apart the rain clouds and showed
the translucent, azure heavens above the pale, vivid mountains.
Foaming on the rocky shores in opal traceries the strong swell of
the Atlantic Seas made a restless surge in the wide bay. Above, the
Old Head of Kinsale, dark and mighty, broke pale and melancholy
sunshine, the pearl-gray gulls circled round the mighty foreign
ship, with the proud alien standard floating above, with stout
sails furled as she rode at anchor.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield, leaning on the taffrail, watched the small
boats putting out, through the breaking waves, to Kinsale. To him
the land was all glamour, crossed and recrossed by silvery-golden
light and trailing mists of azure moisture; as the balmy wind
shifted, the loose clouds revealed prospect after prospect of
tender distance, the mountains so radiant and of so exquisite a
glow that one might not tell whether they were of earth or
heaven.</p>

<p>To sail across the great rolling gray waves of the seas, through
lowering tumults of gales and lashing storms of mid-ocean into this
warm harbour, circled by these hills of gold and pearl, was to find
credible the ancient fable that said Ireland had been created by a
race of magicians and wizards, the Firbolgs, who, before they had
perished utterly through the onslaught of brute force, had left
much of their magic behind them.</p>

<p>Looking at this land enveloped in shifting light and shade,
Patrick Sarsfield forgot the company he was in, where he stood and
what tasks lay before him; his spirit was rapt away to mossy fairy
glades, through forests filled with immemorial silence, to the
infinitely pure light on the infinitely far hills...</p>

<p>He was about to take a place in one of the boats; his mood fell.
He glanced at the other men disembarking; they were alert, absorbed
in their own affairs, silent, save for those who had to give
commands. Their faces were turned with a secret curiosity and a
secret hostility towards Ireland. Sarsfield could discern that they
disliked this warm mist, this slanting rain, these lonely hills.
If, to contemplate the fair land had been exaltation, to
contemplate this company was depression. The words of Count
d'Avaux, spoken in what appeared such candid friendship, had
dissipated something of Patrick Sarsfield's romantic and
enthusiastic illusion, for he was, in spite of his native readiness
to visionary self-deception, keen and intelligent. He saw all those
disembarking at Kinsale as cards in a great pack being dealt out by
that foreign king in Versailles. None of them&mdash;neither the old
monarch (who had been hurled from his English throne) nor his two
stripling bastard sons, nor Melfort, his Scottish minister, nor the
loyal exiles who accompanied him, nor the three able French
generals, nor all these experienced trained officers, recruiting
sergeants and gunners, were anything to King Louis but so many
cards that, for the moment, he happened to hold in his hand, and
Ireland was merely the table on which he laid them. Among all these
there was only one who was of any real importance in Versailles,
and that was the diplomat who represented King Louis, D'Avaux, the
man who had the money, the authority, and the secret instructions
from Louvois and his master.</p>

<p>As Sarsfield watched the trim, well-equipped, well-groomed
Frenchmen disembark from boat after boat, he recalled very vividly
the royal personality which was behind them&mdash;that urbane, courtly
gentleman, with his smiling courtesy, his Gaelic face with the high
cheek-bones and the narrow lips, who had so overwhelmed the fallen
monarch and his faithful followers with flattery, with compliments,
with gifts, and who had cared nothing at all for any of them, but
merely used them as so many assets in the struggle he waged against
the only man who had ever challenged his supremacy in Europe.</p>

<p>"And I, too, I and my like are to be used," thought Patrick
Sarsfield. "And what do any of these care what becomes of Ireland
as long as their king gets best from the Dutchman?"</p>

<p>But, as he set foot on Irish soil his spirit lifted again.</p>

<p>"It is for us to make our count in this; surely while they use
us we can use them."</p>

<p>The rain clouds wholly lifted and the wintry sun, mild and
melancholy, shone on the shouting people who were on the quay-side
to welcome the Frenchmen. It was noisy as a fair. Kerns, priests,
monks, peasants, beggars, gentlemen on fine horses, esquires on
foot or on steady small garrons, barefoot, handsome girls with
shawls and drugget gowns, gentlewomen on palfreys, all contended in
a struggling, shouting press to welcome the Frenchmen, and the king
whom the Frenchmen had sworn to set upon his throne again. None of
these people knew anything of European politics; few knew much of
English politics. They were not cognisant of any of the events
which had led to the second son of Charles I. losing his throne as
his father had lost his before him, nor did they know why that
great fleet had sailed from the Netherlands in the November of '88,
nor why the old king's nephew had taken his throne amid the wild
acclaim of the English and at the snap of a finger; nor did they
know why, having lost two of his kingdoms, James Stewart had
decided to make his stand in this his third; nor had they any
knowledge of the complicated statecraft which had decided Louis of
France and his ministers to choose their island (which had seemed,
during the last two hundred years, to have been forgotten in
Europe) for the scene of his renewed conflict with William of
Orange.</p>

<p>All that these Irish, shouting and struggling in their
enthusiasm on the quay of Kinsale, knew was that this king was the
king of their old faith, a faith hitherto persecuted and despised;
that he had come to lead them against the Saxon oppressor, the
loathed and feared Protestant settler; that Tyrconnel, his viceroy
and friend, had armed and set them against these same Protestants,
refusing to recognise the revolutionary government of England, and
promising them deliverance from that tyranny which had been their
lot since the days of Strongbow, of Elizabeth Tudor, of Oliver
Cromwell.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield considered this impulsive, thoughtless crowd
and smiled wistfully. He, who had long been close to the courts of
Versailles and Whitehall, knew something of the affairs of Europe
and could plumb the depths of the Irish ignorance. He stood aside
and watched the French officers disembark. Quick and sensitive to
every impression, he glanced at their faces; for the most part
these had set and inscrutable expressions, but here and there the
aliens showed an active disdain, as they made their way through,
what no doubt seemed to them, a crowd of barbarians. They had the
aloofness and the concentration of men who have a duty to perform,
who may neither question nor complain.</p>

<p>Two other Irishmen, Colonel Henry Luttrell and Claude Hamilton,
Earl of Abercorn, who both had served with Patrick Sarsfield on the
Rhine under Turenne, stepped on to the wet quay. Sarsfield thought
that not only their uniform but their air set them apart from their
countrymen.</p>

<p>"They are like foreigners here," he thought sadly. He
remembered, what he had not troubled to recall before, that
Abercorn was not of the native Irish, but descended from the
conquerors&mdash;Normans of the Pale.</p>

<p>The earl shrugged as he looked at his friend on the quay and
seemed to show that he too remembered he had a right to disdain the
native Irish, but Luttrell smiled easily, and paused.</p>

<p>"Hold your hand and bide your time, my dear Sarsfield, these are
troubled waters and I dare swear stinking too, but maybe we can
fish in them to our own advantage."</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield liked Henry Luttrell; there was something bold
yet reserved, enthusiastic yet haughty in his demeanour; his
character Sarsfield did not know very well, but he had found
Luttrell in everything attractive, and among the friends he so
readily made, he had singled him out for his special confidence. It
was with him that he walked along the cobbled, narrow and dirty
streets of Kinsale.</p>

<p>When the Irish gathered on the shore saw the good supply of
ammunitions, the imposing arms and massive equipments landed by the
French, the files of trim cornets, mechanics and gunners who
disembarked, they became distracted with a lively stirring of joy
and excitement. Every church bell in Kinsale was ringing. The music
of pipe and harp sounded from every alley corner. The kerns and the
squireens were pulling off their long frieze coats and throwing
them down on the mud and stones for the king and the French to walk
over.</p>

<p>Luttrell and Sarsfield were quartered in the same house, one of
the best in Kinsale, and next to that which Tyrconnel had prepared
for the King. When they had found their way there through the
confusion, Luttrell touched Sarsfield's arm:</p>

<p>"I did not know that Madame the Marquise de Bonnac had come with
the expedition."</p>

<p>"I knew, but I had forgotten. Have you seen her?"</p>

<p>Luttrell smiled towards the house opposite. There, in the
low-arched doorway, full of shade, stood Madame de Bonnac, hesitant
and reluctant, with some other officers' wives, staring down the
wet, dirty street. Sarsfield turned into his lodgings with no
comment, but Colonel Luttrell laughed gently; he knew something and
could guess more of how matters were between Patrick Sarsfield and
this lady.</p>

<p>Olivia Joyce had married another man nearly ten years ago, and
she and Sarsfield had been separated by time and space, chance and
circumstance, but Luttrell knew that Sarsfield could not be in her
presence without uneasiness, that he had kept inviolate that love
idyll of their common youth. Colonel Luttrell never showed how much
he knew or guessed, even his laugh just then might have meant
something else; but Sarsfield, whose spirits were already sunk,
felt them further flag and wither at the sight of Madame de Bonnac.
He wished that she had not accompanied this expedition, and
recalled with a pang how near they were to the ruins of Irrelagh
and the mansion of the MacCarthys, where so many years before, he
had asked her to marry him and she had dismissed him without
regret; and he had turned from what had wounded him, to earthly
vanities, for consolation.</p>

<p>Henry Luttrell peered from the window and watched the French
officers searching for their quarters.</p>

<p>"What will they make of Ireland?" he mocked. Then, "Did you see
the Livonian's scowl?"</p>

<p>"He was wondering, no doubt," said Patrick Sarsfield dryly,
"where he was going to discover the ten thousand to wear his fine
equipments. Did you mark how he glowered at the rabble, lowering
and scornful, how he put them aside with the back of his gloved
hand, as if he would not have them press on him too close? He may
be hated if he does not have a care."</p>

<p>Luttrell, leaning easily in the window-place, answered
relevantly:</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> could find the ten thousand Irish, Sarsfield."</p>

<p>"If I was allowed to recruit them as Irishmen to fight for
Ireland, maybe, but will they be drilled and officered by Frenchmen
to fight for a French quarrel? And, as for the king&mdash;" He checked
himself.</p>

<p>Luttrell finished the sentence:</p>

<p>"The king is an old, a burdensome, a miserable man, with neither
grace nor prudence. Besides, he counts for very little&mdash;he is
reproached, nicknamed, scorned as weak and low; it is D'Avaux who
is everything, even De Rosen is under his orders." He added
casually, "Madame de Bonnac is at the window opposite. She really
is very beautiful, in a loose and carnal fashion, even after the
usage of the voyage. What folly for a woman like a glass-house lily
to come to this miserable country!"</p>

<p>"She may not wish to leave her husband for perhaps many a long
campaign," said Sarsfield, without irony.</p>

<p>Colonel Luttrell of Luttrelstown laughed again. He was lithe, of
medium height, dark and elegant, with an easy, well-bred,
good-humoured air, and a touch of lightness in all he did. He had a
certain influence over any one on whom he chose to exercise it, and
it was difficult to discern that the essential man was wild,
reckless and unstable; though he was clever at flattery, as a rule
he disdained such beguilements, but fascinated merely by good
nature, his air of casual candour, the attractiveness of his
personality; his face was well shaped, his eyes curious; one
disfigured by a cast, which, however, seldom showed under his heavy
lids; he was foppish in his habits.</p>

<p>One of D'Avaux's secretaries, greenish and sour from the sea
voyage, came to beg Colonel Sarsfield's presence at His Majesty's
lodgings. Henry Luttrell lightly wished his companion ample
luck.</p>

<p>"Nobody singles me out for favours," he mocked, "but D'Avaux
seems to have taken a sharp liking to you. I saw him talking to you
on the ship, hat in hand&mdash;smiling like a ferret."</p>

<p>"He had no good matters to say," replied Sarsfield, buckling on
his sword. "He merely reminded me very civilly that we are all
pawns in the game played by His Most Christian Majesty."</p>

<p>Lord Tyrconnel, who had come posting from Dublin to receive his
master, had done what he could to prepare a regal lodging, but the
best house in Kinsale was not magnificent, and in the eyes of the
French officers used to Versailles, Marli, the Louvre and
Fontainebleau, the apartments prepared for His Majesty were
wretched; this was even worse accommodation, they whispered to each
other with a sneer, than they expected to find when on an active
campaign in Flanders or Italy.</p>

<p>King James himself peered round with a muttering disgust, then
dropped into the worn leather chair drawn up by the wide wood fire.
He had refused any food, but warmed his stomach, queasy from the
sea voyage, with brandy; when Patrick Sarsfield was shown into his
presence his grim humour had not abated, and he listened with
listless annoyance to the bitter remarks of the men who were
arguing about his chair.</p>

<p>Sarsfield knew all these. D'Avaux himself, Tyrconnel (James's
loyal viceroy who had held Ireland for him when his other two
kingdoms had slipped away) John Drummond Earl of Melfort, His
Majesty's Scottish Councillor; Marshal de Rosen, and the king's
eldest bastard son James Fitzjames, Duke of Berwick.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield waited inside the door, apart from this group
of men. For a while the king took no notice of him at all. He leant
forward and began to complain to Tyrconnel, sometimes muttering
under his breath, sometimes raising his voice in sullen protest,
thus silencing the harsh arguments of the others.</p>

<p>Everything, he declared, was wrong. He told D'Avaux that his
comfort had not been properly considered on the voyage, told
Tyrconnel that his reception had been contemptible, told De Rosen
that it was ridiculous to bring officers and no soldiers; he
complained and lamented:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is the use of attempting anything in this accursed
country?"</p>

<p>D'Avaux and De Rosen, clear-headed and unimaginative,
concentrated on their responsibilities and their work, made but
superficial response. In Melfort's remarks only was there some
sympathy; he also detested the Irish, and the circumstances that
had sent him to Ireland.</p>

<p>The young Duke of Berwick held himself dignified and
inscrutable; his eyes flashed to Sarsfield a look of understanding.
To both of these young men the old king seemed a symbol of
disillusion and defeat. Here was royalty in eclipse, one of an
unfortunate house most unfortunate, one who had, foolhardy in the
extreme, tempted his destiny and brought all his honours tumbling
into the dust beneath his feet; one who still blamed all but
himself.</p>

<p>Sarsfield was sorry to see the king's heavy, full-veined hands
shake as he held them over the spluttering fire, and when he said
he was thirsty Tyrconnel offered him, casually, a wooden noggin of
goat's milk.</p>

<p>The king seemed to perceive something of his own humiliation; he
muttered to Melfort, who paid him more deference than did the
others:</p>

<p>"The Lord hath broken the man in me&mdash;I grow old."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-3" id="ch1-3"></a>THREE</h2>

<p class="first">
AT the first pause in His Majesty's renewed complaints D'Avaux
put in quietly:</p>

<p>"Here is Colonel Sarsfield, sire, whom I have sent for to wait
on you."</p>

<p>The king's heavy, swollen eyes glanced up ungraciously at the
Irishman.</p>

<p>"Monsieur D'Avaux wishes me to make you a brigadier, Colonel
Sarsfield," he said. "What can you do for me?"</p>

<p>"Sire," replied Sarsfield gravely, "as much as any man of my
power and position may."</p>

<p>He was sad with compassion for the old king whose whole life had
been exile and misery, who had always been greatly detested in
England both for his religion and his character, who had never made
many friends, nor evoked much loyalty, and who had, at the climax
of his fortunes, been forsaken even by his own children. It was not
possible that many could have loved this James Stewart, who was a
passionate bigot and a cold voluptuary, characteristics which do
not gain the affections of mankind. He was also of a narrow
understanding, obstinate and arrogant, and one who could never bend
himself to the gracious word, or engage with the generous gesture
and (defects which would have mattered less had he been able to
disguise them) withal cruel and tyrannical.</p>

<p>He stared sourly at Sarsfield, though he knew well enough that
this man was the only one of all his guards who had remained
faithful to him, that he had been in the skirmish at Wincanton, one
of the few who had drawn their sword in his cause against the
Prince of Orange, and that he had refused the offer of the usurping
prince to confirm him in his estates and employ him as an envoy to
Tyrconnel.</p>

<p>"It is necessary that we raise men immediately and I think you
are among those well qualified to do this, Colonel Sarsfield. Must
I be plagued with business? It seems I am to have no moment to
myself."</p>

<p>The king pulled his broad-leaved hat over his brows.</p>

<p>D'Avaux very respectfully, yet as one who is master of the
situation, said:</p>

<p>"Much must be arranged before we get to Dublin."</p>

<p>Tyrconnel took the word, he had been silent hitherto,
considering with intense dislike the rough, passionate De Rosen,
whom he already saw as a rival. The Livonian appeared to regard the
viceroy with disdain and fumed in gross impatience, anxious to be
about his own business.</p>

<p>Tyrconnel stepped in front of the king and began to expound,
with many fine words and wide gestures, on his own high services.
He was, he flattered himself, the only man in the room who had any
influence with King James. He had been the rakish friend of his
early licentious manhood and always in his confidence; though he
bore the magnificent name of Talbot he was only of the
middle-classes, yet he stood there an earl, Commander-in-Chief of
the Irish forces and Viceroy of Ireland. He related with much
enthusiasm how he, when every one else had forsaken His Majesty,
had held Ireland firm to his cause, and done his best to reduce
Derry. With his deep voice, with his majestic gestures&mdash;for he was
a man of a noble and commanding port&mdash;Tyrconnel painted an
encouraging picture of the state of the last kingdom belonging to
His Majesty.</p>

<p>Sarsfield listened with a rising hope that after all there might
be in all this something for Ireland. The viceroy was Irish, though
not native of the soil, but descended of the English of the Pale.
He glanced about him and, seeing that every one was listening to
him intently, became more glowing in his account of the condition
of the kingdom.</p>

<p>"The diligence of the Roman Catholic nobility and gentry," he
grandiloquently declared, "have raised about fifty regiments of
foot and several troop of horse and dragoons...I have all defined
as accurately as possible in my army list; I have distributed among
them above twenty thousand arms, but they are mostly so old and
unserviceable that not above a thousand of the matchlocks may be of
use. There are," he added, "about one battalion of Guards, together
with MacCarthy's, Clancarty's and Newcomen's troops, all pretty
well armed, also there are Mountjoy's several companies...I have
besides three regiments of horse, my own, Russell's and one of
dragoons."</p>

<p>As he came to a pause waiting for the silent king's praise, De
Rosen asked sharply, "If all the Catholics in the country were
armed?" And Tyrconnel was forced to admit that they were not,
whereas the Protestants had great plenty of war material, and the
best horses in the kingdom.</p>

<p>"And your artillery?" asked De Rosen with a scowl.</p>

<p>Tyrconnel replied that he had about eight small pieces in a
condition to march, the rest not mounted...</p>

<p>"From what you told me," put in D'Avaux suavely, "I fear, my
lord, that you have few stores in the magazine, little powder and
ball, that all the best officers have gone to Ulster and there is
no money in cash."</p>

<p>Tyrconnel lifted his lip at the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"All that is true. You must remember, sir, that this country is
the only one that has held firm to His Majesty, that all the north
is in rebellion, even in other parts of the country we have many
Protestants and settlers who are better equipped with arms and
money than the native Irish; though I have done what I can it has
been impossible to completely efface these difficulties."</p>

<p>"And you have not," jeered De Rosen coolly, "been able to reduce
Derry, that is a pity."</p>

<p>At mention of this defiant town which he regarded with a
peculiar dislike, the sullen king flared up:</p>

<p>"That nest of rebels must be reduced at once&mdash;I have been much
abused in this business. You shall have all I can give you&mdash;cannon
and mortars. I consider it is of the first consequence to master
Derry."</p>

<p>"We shall do that soon enough," boasted Tyrconnel, "with the
fine help that we now have from France. As soon as Your Majesty is
in Dublin and has summoned your parliament, I doubt not these
sturdy rebels will lose some of their stoutness."</p>

<p>"They will receive help from England, without doubt," said
D'Avaux. He did not add, what he perfectly well knew, that King
Louis intended to create a diversion in Ireland which should bring
over the flower of the English army and possibly the usurping
prince in person. Louvois, the French minister of war, had even
said that it might be possible to detain the Prince of Orange ten
years in Ireland with his best generals and troops, while the King
of France swept the board in Europe.</p>

<p>Melfort put in:</p>

<p>"I hope we shall not be long for Dublin. The news from Scotland
is of the best. Claverhouse has roused the entire Highlands. If we
could but get His Majesty to Edinburgh the struggle were half
won&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We must think first," put in D'Avaux, "of getting His Majesty
to Dublin."</p>

<p>The king agreed with Melfort. After a few hours in Ireland he
felt more exiled than in France, where he had had every comfort,
splendour, luxury and deference. The winter had been bright and
shining in France, crisp snow in the parks and clear blue skies
above the bare <i>allées</i>, but here, this greenish, pale gold
sunshine streaming athwart the endless wreaths of mist, this
incessant rain, these hordes of dirty, shouting, barbarous people,
this rough accommodation&mdash;all irritated King James into a
melancholy of distaste. He had for a long while resisted King
Louis's advice to "make his stand in Ireland;" now he regretted
that he had in the end taken it; like all of his race and caste he
utterly despised the neglected island and its inhabitants and could
hardly keep his speech from disdain of them, even in face of
Tyrconnel and Sarsfield. Painfully he kept to the business in which
Tyrconnel, D'Avaux and De Rosen had instructed him.</p>

<p>"Do you think you could raise a troop of horse, Colonel
Sarsfield? I intend to ask as much of Berwick, Abercorn, Luttrell,
Dangan, Sutherland, Parker and a few others. I suppose you have
enough influence to get some men from your own estates?"</p>

<p>D'Avaux put in shrewdly:</p>

<p>"My Lord Berwick is to make an attempt on Derry immediately.
Colonel Henry Luttrell is to be Governor of Sligo. We will find
some post of honour for you, Colonel Sarsfield."</p>

<p>The king sat moody, sunk-in his chair, as if he had forgotten
all of them. There was a certain stately grace in his gaunt figure
and his haggard face, but that was all he had of kingliness. He was
very richly dressed in the French fashion&mdash;cinnamon brown velvet,
gallooned, looped and scrolled with gold bullion, much costly lace
and an imposing blond peruke. But all this luxury seemed but a
fantastic comment on his dispirited old age.</p>

<p>Tyrconnel crossed to D'Avaux, eagerly flattering the Frenchman;
though he resented De Rosen (who might challenge his military
ascendency), yet he was keen to keep in favour with the King of
France: as D'Avaux had written to his master, "if a Frenchman had
been made Viceroy of Ireland he could not be more zealous for the
interests of Your Majesty."</p>

<p>The viceroy knew that through D'Avaux's interest he had been
promised the patent for a dukedom; if his manners had not been very
polished and engaging there would have been something fulsome and
fawning in the deference he paid to the French plenipotentiary. The
viceroy was a big, strutting, magnificent man with something of the
haughty port of King Louis himself and when he spoke loudly, with
many gestures and flourishes, he seemed to dwarf all who were about
him.</p>

<p>The king sat silent as Tyrconnel spoke to D'Avaux; Sarsfield
crossed to the window place where Berwick and Melfort whispered
with De Rosen and told the French commander that he believed he
could by his own influence and at his own expense raise a troop of
two hundred and fifty men.</p>

<p>"If every gentleman of your standing does as much," conceded the
Livonian, "we shall not do so badly for cavalry."</p>

<p>Berwick remarked:</p>

<p>"Tyrconnel has been very energetic and done remarkably well, but
from all I can hear the north is strong and the Protestant
opposition considerable, even without they send nothing from
England."</p>

<p>"But the moment," said De Rosen, "they know that I am raising an
army they will send troops from England."</p>

<p>Berwick shrugged. "Well, we must do what we can. If we have
trained men to oppose them&mdash;" He shrugged again and added slightly:
"It seems to me that we have gotten into a barbarous country, and
that it will be very difficult to make good soldiers out of these
people."</p>

<p>He spoke without the least intention of offence to Sarsfield,
for he had really forgotten that that officer was native Irish, and
considered him more as an Englishman or a Frenchman, which last
indeed he was by training. But the very fact that the slighting
words were spoken so thoughtlessly, added to their sting.</p>

<p>All his life Sarsfield had known how the Irish were regarded by
the rest of Europe. The bitterness of that knowledge was
accentuated, he felt, when he was on his native soil.</p>

<p>He looked at Berwick shrewdly and wondered whether he disliked
him or not. This young prince had a remarkable personality. He was
the son of Arabella, the sister of that John Churchill who, long
the favourite of King James, had been the first to desert him with
cynical coolness. If this youth, half Stewart, half Churchill, with
many of the gifts of both brilliant families, had been legitimate,
it is possible his father had not lost his throne. He was then
twenty years old, Jesuit-trained, reserved, stately, cautious
beyond his years, fastidious in his manners, alert and sensitive
under a smooth and austere exterior. He had entered the service of
the Emperor at fourteen and at the age of sixteen had distinguished
himself in commanding troops at the siege of Buda; he was
essentially a leader of men. Recalled from the battlefields of
Esseth and Mockhals to help support his father's falling government
he had distinguished himself with ardour in the Stewart cause,
striving to maintain Portsmouth against the Prince of Orange. He
had been one of that small company who had gone with King James
when he had escaped the guards at Rochester and crossed to France
in a small boat which had landed at Ambleteuse at six o'clock on a
Christmas morning.</p>

<p>Sarsfield envied him; he was so young, he had every opportunity
for glory, "for it is almost better to be the base-begotten son of
a king than to belong to a country wholly despised."</p>

<p>The king rose, peevishly cut short all their mingled talk,
Tyrconnel's boasting, D'Avaux's advice, Melfort's cautious
suggestions. He was weary, his priests awaited him, he had an
intense longing to cast himself into the comfort of what would have
been (in another man) a spiritual ecstasy, but which was with him,
some thought, merely the support of a heavy superstition. He
dismissed all save Melfort at whom Tyrconnel cast a look of growing
dislike; the viceroy feared the quiet and elegant Scotsman who
undermined his influence with the king.</p>

<p>They went down the mean stairs into the mean streets of Kinsale;
the last rays of watery sunshine fell on the huddled houses and the
rain clouds were gathering again.</p>

<p>Two French officers, acting on the king's express instructions,
kept back with scant gentleness the crowd of Irish enthusiasts who
loyally besieged His Majesty's door, clamouring to kiss his hand,
his foot, even for a glimpse of him. The remarks the Frenchmen made
to each other as they kept the street clear caused Sarsfield to
wince. He said impetuously to D'Avaux, who walked at his side:</p>

<p>"No one will be able to manage these people who treats them like
dogs."</p>

<p>D'Avaux replied:</p>

<p>"That is why I wish to employ Irish officers and gentlemen like
yourself as much as possible, Colonel Sarsfield. I rely on you,
your loyalty and discretion, that is why I have got you brigadier
in command of the second Troop of Horse." He glanced up at the tall
Irishman striding beside him over the cobbles, and added: "You do
not seem as pleased as I thought you would have been with this mark
of confidence from His Majesty."</p>

<p>"His Majesty," repeated Sarsfield, "you mean the King of
France?"</p>

<p>D'Avaux smiled. He knew, and Sarsfield knew that there was only
one king for him.</p>

<p>They parted at the door of D'Avaux's lodgings. The diplomat's
heart was heavy; there seemed before him a task of almost
impossible difficulty. He secretly despised and disliked the
feeble, sour bigot whose every act was, to a man like D'Avaux, one
of almost incredible folly, and he saw this King Log who had
neither the wit, the courage nor the presence to play the leader,
was surrounded by profiteers, turncoats, traitors and dishonest
jobbers. Tyrconnel was violent, blustering, indiscreet and, D'Avaux
suspected, corrupt. Melfort was sly, cautious, dishonest and
probably cowardly. Berwick and his younger brother, Henry
Fitzjames, were mere youths, probably serving their secret
ambitions. De Rosen was a good man, but utterly ignorant of
Ireland, hard and autocratic, and not likely to get on well with
Tyrconnel. Then there were the native Irishmen like Galmoy, Galway,
Abercorn, Luttrell&mdash;impulsive, impetuous, hasty, who, long-exiled
from their own country, could have but little influence,
quarrelling among themselves, poverty stricken...</p>

<p>"There is only," said D'Avaux to himself, "one single-hearted,
single-minded man, and that's Patrick Sarsfield, and exactly
because," added the diplomat with a bitterness born of a long
experience, "he is single-minded and single-hearted, honest and a
patriot, every one else will be against him, and I shall make
myself exceedingly unpopular if I venture to support him."</p>

<p>He lingered at the door of his house and watched the figure of
the tall Irishman going up the narrow street, the last rays of
precious gold gleaming through the moving mists on to the fine
appointments of his uniform.</p>

<p>"If I had my way, I would make that man Viceroy of Ireland, put
him in full authority over all the others."</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield paused in the wet street. The soldier of an
army that was not yet raised, commander of a nonexistent regiment,
he had nothing to do. He envied the Frenchmen their precise, set
tasks, As he lingered he saw Madame de Bonnac again standing at the
door of her house. It was strange that she should have come to
Ireland, that they should meet again so close to where they had
parted ten years before. A great gulf of time was between them; he
had seen so little of her since her marriage, he did not know
whether she was content with her state or no. He had but small
acquaintance with her husband. He believed him a dull man immersed
in routine. That they should meet thus in Ireland seemed to bridge
the years and many of the formalities and conventions which had
kept them apart while she was in France and he in England.</p>

<p>She beckoned him to her side, and told him the sad depression
she felt at being again in this miserable country.</p>

<p>"Why did you come?"</p>

<p>"Oh"&mdash;she lifted her pretty shoulders&mdash;"the war may go on for
years. I could not endure to be one of those women who wait, wait,
wait&mdash;"</p>

<p>He supposed from this that she was attached to her husband. He
thought that through the silver twilight she appeared curiously
beautiful. She was silver, rosy fair, very exquisite. Of the real
woman behind that frail yet opulent loveliness he knew nothing. She
startled him by asking:</p>

<p>"Is it true that you are going to marry Lord Galway's sister,
Honor de Burgh?"</p>

<p>"How have you heard that, Madame de Bonnac? It is true there has
been some talk of it between Galway and myself, it is also true
that it is time I had an establishment."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes"&mdash;she smiled&mdash;"you are wealthy now, you have the
estates, and are free to marry."</p>

<p>He knew she was remembering that she had refused him ten years
ago, exactly because he had neither money nor estates. With her
lovely red lips, dewy fresh, she idled into a song:&mdash;"<i>The
grasshopper sang all the summer."</i></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-4" id="ch1-4"></a>FOUR</h2>

<p class="first">
MADAME DE BONNAC told him that her husband was engaged in the
disembarkation of the arms and stores, that the other ladies were
abroad satisfying their curiosity by visiting the town, and she
asked him to come into the parlour and keep her company for this
half-hour of twilight.</p>

<p>He followed her, and he thought, "Perhaps she would like me to
tell her that I still love her, that I have never loved any one
else all these years since I knew her first as a child in France,
and," he added in his heart, "would it be true if I did so tell
her? Love? Who is to define it? It has certainly seemed impossible
for me to rid myself of the thought of her, of the desire for her,
lack of her has left me restless and incomplete, all other women
whom I have tried to put in her place I remember with regret and
shame." Yet, as he was by nature chaste and temperate, he could
look at her without any uneasy violence of passion; his religion
was to him real and definite and by its aid he had been able to
transmute his feelings for Olivia de Bonnac into a chivalrous,
half-mystical, half-visionary devotion.</p>

<p>Olivia put off her hood; her gray dress was fantastic and very
costly. In the candlelight the soft loops of her blonde hair showed
like new cedarwood in hue, her flesh seemed to have the warm
whiteness and the close texture of a summer-warmed rose.</p>

<p>They had not been alone together in a room since he had parted
from her in the solitary mansion of the MacCarthys. He smiled at
the thought of how young he had been then, with what hopeful ardour
he had pressed her to meet him beneath the haunted yew, and
exchange charms taught him by the Shanahus. He could recall
poignantly his sensation of utter loneliness when he had discovered
that she had not come, when he realised that she had never intended
to come.</p>

<p>In a manner, that sensation of loneliness had never left him
since. He remembered, too, the other girl, the stranger who had
seemed to grow out of and then dissolve into the shadows of the
gray alabaster cloisters. But that part of the adventure in
Irrelagh had seemed unreal, it had been so odd, so transient. He
found it hard to credit that he and a girl named Ishma O'Donaghoe
had ever exchanged love vows under the shade of the yew at
Mucruss.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of?" asked Madame de Bonnac, sitting on
the table and resting her rounded chin in her rosy palm.</p>

<p>"Of Irrelagh, it is quite near here, I shall visit it on the
march to Dublin."</p>

<p>"Why, has it such a pleasant memory? I can remember the rain
falling like it falls now. Does the sun never shine in Ireland?"
She did not speak querulously, but in rather a soft and pleasing
melancholy.</p>

<p>"Those were old dreams, beatitudes and ardours of youth," he
thought, "now we are man and woman and the world has us firmly. I
must never ask her if she regrets those days, and she will never
tell me."</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac questioned:</p>

<p>"Is it true that you are to have a troop of horse?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall have some work to do." And because she was Olivia
Joyce he could not keep his dearest wish from his tongue, that
which he would not have voiced to any other. "I hope to do
something for Ireland."</p>

<p>"Always an enthusiast," she smiled. "What can any man do for
Ireland?" Then she added: "Honor de Burgh is a patriot too."</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield did not take up that challenge, if challenge
it were. He was surprised that she had heard this rumour of his
approaching marriage; Lord Galway, ruined, disinherited,
discouraged, had suggested to him this match with his young sister.
They were one in nationality, faith and loyalty. Sarsfield's
chivalry and loneliness had been moved towards the dowerless orphan
girl; she was young and malleable, she might cure him of some of
his aching melancholy. Yet he had hesitated to use her thus
selfishly, and she had never given him any mark of favour; he
feared she could not care for him. He had let Galway's proposals
wait&mdash;neither accepting nor denying them, but now, as he stood
before Madame de Bonnac, he thought that he would like to have a
wife between him and this other man's wife, if they were to be in
Ireland together in this cruel proximity.</p>

<p>For ten years he had evaded the Marquise de Bonnac, now he could
not evade her; he wished he did not consider her so beautiful. Her
blunt features were almost coarse, her mouth was not a fine shape,
but her complexion was so pure, her lips so freshly crimson, her
hair so silver-gold that it seemed to hold light, and she had such
vitality, such radiance, she seemed so sure of herself and her
destiny. Her voluptuous air promised a kind forgiving comfort, she
was easy and elegant. Yet she could be cruel and her good breeding
often failed sufficiently for her to maliciously diminish some one
in his own esteem with a glance or a sneer.</p>

<p>But now she was, to Sarsfield, all melting tenderness.</p>

<p>"You will do well, you will succeed, among all these jobbers and
poor sneaking fellows who surround the king." She dismissed him
sedately, he barely touched her hand; as he left she was biting her
handkerchief with her small, white, irregular teeth.</p>

<p>Sarsfield found in his lodgings Henry Luttrell already writing
out the list of men who were to officer his troop of horse.</p>

<p>"Consider"&mdash;he smiled&mdash;"that we shall not only have to raise,
but maintain, these men at our own charges."</p>

<p>"D'Avaux is responsible."</p>

<p>"Ay," replied Luttrell, "he may be responsible, but it will be a
long time before we shall see any French gold, especially," he
added, "if it has to pass through Melfort's hands. Well, I am to go
to Sligo," he concluded, "and that's as good a post as
another."</p>

<p>As Sarsfield did not reply, Luttrell added with emphasis: "Trust
none of these foreigners, my dear Sarsfield, let us use them as
they intend to use us&mdash;'He who gains the knaves and fools need
never fear the wise men.'"</p>

<p>Sarsfield saw that he wished to convey more than the actual
meaning of the words and candidly questioned him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I mean," cried Luttrell, with some impatience and a wild
air, "we owe allegiance neither to King James nor King Louis, and
it might be possible for us to throw both of them overboard and set
up some one of our own."</p>

<p>Sarsfield laughed this off as a reckless impossibility, but he
looked at Henry Luttrell very keenly. Luttrell had a way of making
the fantastic seem possible, an enticing manner of presenting the
incredible; Sarsfield had heard him called a grand hypocrite and a
crafty cheat, but set this abuse down to malice; no doubt Luttrell
had his mixture of alloy, but Sarsfield gave him both respect and
trust.</p>

<p>Looking up from his papers Luttrell laughed, and he had an
agreeable laugh that could gild the most dismal situation; the cast
in his lively eyes seemed no defect in his pleasing features;
Sarsfield, fastidious himself, was gratified by the neatness of his
companion's habit; Colonel Luttrell wore the scarlet and gold of
the English Guards that King James's officers retained in default
of any other uniform; a Paris tailor had set off his elegant shape
very handsomely; like most of the younger fashionable men he wore
his own hair carefully curled on to his shoulders; this was nut
brown and glossy. Good taste and judgment showed in his whole
person; his deportment befitted his noble birth and the grandeur of
his breeding.</p>

<p>"I see," he observed, "that I must be very specious with you, or
what I have to say will not go down."</p>

<p>"What have you to say?"</p>

<p>"To-night&mdash;nothing. You are brigadier and are to have a troop of
horse. I am to be Governor of Sligo&mdash;these are the lollipops, but
we must sweat to earn 'em."</p>

<p>He turned decently and easily to his task; he had already listed
almost all his officers and was now concerned with quarter-master,
chaplain and surgeon; he seemed by his absorption in his business
to dismiss Sarsfield, but with so obliging a mien that no offence
could be taken.</p>

<p>That night Patrick Sarsfield could not sleep. At dawn he rose
and noticed a light burning in the chamber of Madame de Bonnac in
the house opposite. Then he saw the taper extinguished and a pale
arm draw the drugget curtain aside, and her dim-seen face peer up
the street towards the eastern sky.</p>

<p>They were divided, it seemed to him, not only by the narrow
street, but by a thousand futilities, by years of absence, and
conventions, each had been going for so long a different way in a
different life. He knew nothing of her mind or her moods; they
might be regretful and sad, or gay and content; she was careful to
be inscrutable.</p>

<p>She leaned on her elbow and stared along the little rainy street
at the sky, flushing faintly to a wet dawn.</p>

<p>It was some years ago, he believed, since he had lived down the
devastating fury of passion with which he had once desired her. But
then as he watched her, framed in the mean window, half-seen in
that melancholy silvery light, he believed that furious passion
might easily return to torment him. Why had she come to Ireland
where there was so much work, man's work, ready to his hand? She
would not be, she had said, one of the women 'who stay behind and
wait.' Yet he could not believe that she loved her husband so much
that she could not endure to be parted from him. He did not know
why, but it seemed to him incredible, this marital devotion. Far
out of his reach as she had been for so long he could never really
think of her as belonging to another. She was childless and this
helped to keep her aloof from common life, and leave her tender,
virginal air to dignify her florid beauty.</p>

<p>In the opal azure of dawn the little hushed town was empty of
everything except that blurred loveliness at the window opposite.
The sea breeze blew fresh and pure on his face, a misty rain
trembled in the fragrant air which was balmy with the first scent
of spring and with, he fancied, the perfume of the arbutus growing
by the lake's edge near Innisfallen. He drew back behind the
curtain feeling that she would consider she was spied upon if she
saw him; their relations had been for long so formal. He could see
the warm pallor of her raised face, the drifting loop of her
silvery hair over her smooth shoulder. Was it possible that she was
thinking of him, of the strangeness of their meeting here in
Kinsale?</p>

<p>The silence and sanctity of the untouched hour of dawn made him
feel that the facts of every day were ridiculous; always had he
felt a passionate desire to escape from the commonplace into a
world of his own creation; it seemed to him absurd that anything
should keep him from Olivia de Bonnac, ridiculous that he did not
cross the narrow street, mount the mean stairs, and take her in his
arms, press his body to her body, her lips to his lips. He mused:
"I will not be cheated of everything, I will not end my youth, like
an eminent simpleton, having tasted nothing but pretences. There's
Ireland and I'll find another woman."</p>

<p>The estates were his now, and the name; he had a chance to
obtain renown, an opportunity for glory, he must have
heirs...Olivia was the unpossessed, the departing woman...There was
Honor, so young, almost a child, with her husky voice, her
dead-leaf hair, her blue eyes...He persuaded himself that in Honor
he could see a likeness to the girl with whom he had exchanged the
love charm beneath the haunted yew of St. Bridget. He vowed to the
pale sky and the drifting rain of Ireland that he would make Honor
de Burgh love him, that he would love her with great loyalty; in a
newly-redeemed country they would preserve renown and dignity.</p>

<p>He turned back into the low room; the light filtering through
the window he had uncurtained showed him Henry Luttrell awake on
his pallet bed, resting on his elbow regarding him, Sarsfield
thought, with eyes of a tender mockery. Luttrell had a way of
smiling as if he knew every one's secrets.</p>

<p>Sarsfield said: "It's raining again, a wet dawn, and the whole
country will be sodden."</p>

<p><br>
On the morrow the streets were glittering with the French, with the
gleam of polished leather, of glossy horses, of scoured steel, of
gold buckles and sword-hilts. The disembarkation had proceeded
smoothly, and Tyrconnel was boastful about the way he had done his
part; but De Rosen found much to complain of; both the transport
and the horses were inadequate, the roads, he said, were in the
worst possible condition, and he showed violent impatience with the
excited Irish who impeded progress on the atrocious Dublin
highway.</p>

<p>At the sight of the king and his corps of Jesuit priests the
motley crowd had gone wild with anticipated triumphs, had capered
round the <i>cortege,</i> and almost swept the rearing horses off
their legs. The king's haggard face showed the bitterest disgust;
he harshly ordered aside the women who were struggling to kiss his
hand, even his stirrup; he pulled his hat over his weary eyes, and
did not attempt to acknowledge them; it was obvious in his every
look and gesture that he considered himself humiliated by such
barbarous loyalty. The French priests also held themselves
haughtily; it seemed as if they did not recognise the Irish
Catholics as being of their faith. With poignant self-pity the king
kept behind his guards who began, with the flat of their swords, to
beat a way through the squealing, shouting, ragged and filthy
Irish.</p>

<p>Tyrconnel, to please the king's mood, made vigorous efforts to
clear the way; as the frieze and drugget coats were flung in the
mud for the king to ride over his sallow face flushed with
vexation. The rain came down with sudden warm heaviness, cloud and
mountain were alike eclipsed in mist; this increased the confusion;
the struggling column halted, trying to maintain order. Sarsfield
rode up to Galway in the press, he wished to settle his own destiny
at least; he was too apt in his impulses, too quick in putting a
vagrant thought into concrete action.</p>

<p>"If your sister would like me," he said. "Well, my lord, we'll
settle all at Dublin."</p>

<p>Galway jumped at once to the meaning of this, he scarcely
troubled to disguise his gratitude. He had, like many another Irish
gentleman, lost everything by espousing the Stewart cause. His
father had been Clanricarde, and wealthy&mdash;all that was gone. He was
thankful to place his sister in the hands of a man like Sarsfield.
The two young men, in that pause of the march, reached out across
their saddles and pressed each other's hands.</p>

<p>Sarsfield thought with pleasure, "They are Irish of the Irish,
no drop of alien blood in Honor's veins." Yes, he would be happy
and content, raised above the need for brutish and transitory
follies; he turned and glanced back at the rude carriages in which
the women were travelling.</p>

<p>But Madame de Bonnac was on horseback, graceful, alert, in a
cavalier's habit; indifferent to the veils of warm rain she stared
curiously at the shouting crowds which lined the road. The Irish
gave evidence of the most frantic loyalty. Again the women's
shawls, the men's long coats, were thrown down on the muddy way.
D'Avaux and De Rosen gazed at the rabble, critically glancing over
the men, sizing them up as possible material for the use of His
Most Christian Majesty.</p>

<p>De Rosen thought: "Fine, likely-looking fellows, but <i>mon
Dieu!</i> how long will they take to train, and are they to be
trained?" For they seemed to the Livonian no better than savages.
The further he glanced along the road, the more he saw of the wild,
uncultivated country, the ragged, shouting people, the deeper grew
his scowl and the less he liked either Ireland or his task...some
of the peasants wore no more than blankets, with wisps of straw for
hats&mdash;most were barefoot.</p>

<p>The broken column, now closing up, now dividing, halting and
proceeding in an irregular manner, made little progress that first
day. Small streams which crossed the road were swollen with the
rains of winter, these fordings were difficult, the road itself in
places almost impassable, the yelling, disorderly crowds impeded
the horses and baggage wagons.</p>

<p>Tyrconnel, stung by the king's complaints and the Frenchman's
disdain, was moved to swear passionately "that he had not made the
highways."</p>

<p>De Rosen sneered to General Pusignan:</p>

<p>"I think the devil made the whole country."</p>

<p>Melfort talked of the necessity of rapidly subduing the north
and then going to Scotland; he dwelt on the untrustworthiness of
the Irish and their false superstitious patriotism, and warned the
king there was no reliance to be placed on their present display of
fanatic, unbalanced loyalty.</p>

<p>Berwick was silent; he had the quiet enthusiasm of a youth eager
to test his own powers, but his brother, Henry Fitzjames (the Lord
Grand Prior and Duke of Albemarle), said openly that he thought it
"folly to leave a civilised country for a place like this, that
they owed little gratitude to His Most Christian Majesty for
equipping this most foolish expedition."</p>

<p>That night they encamped as best they might at Mallow. Sarsfield
regretted Kinsale, the rocky promontory with the ruins of the
castle of the Kings of Ireland, and the seagulls flying grandly
overhead. He yearned towards the bleakness and desolation, the bold
romantic grandeur of those emerald-blue cliffs. But a deeper reason
for his regret was that he had an almost superstitious dislike to
turn again to Killarney, yet he knew if they halted here for long
he must once more visit the Abbey of Irrelagh. To protect himself
by reality from the torment of this thin substance of dreams he
found out the Lady Honor de Burgh, and put to her the question he
had put to her brother that morning. She was lodged very poorly,
but seemed resigned; her head hung wearily, her attitude was
drowsy.</p>

<p>"Could you like me, Honor, could you trust me and accept all I
have to give, now and for ever? Your brother has spoken to you?
Forgive this scant courtship, dear heart, the times are hurried and
full of manifest confusion." He was as unconscious of the
magnificence of the gift he offered, as he had been ten years
before when he had proposed himself to Olivia Joyce; in his
dignity, grandeur and strength he stood humbly before the young
girl who looked like one of the nuns whose charge she had lately
left, so quiet was her gray habit, so modest her air.</p>

<p>She regarded him curiously with a deep searching look, and yet
as if she knew she could hope to learn no more than the outward
aspect of him; she seemed sweetly surprised by his words, her
fingers trembled over a crucifix on her girlish bosom.</p>

<p>"The angels guard us in all our ways, Colonel Sarsfield, and
offend our enemies! My brother spoke to me, but I, who might once
have been a match for a gentleman, have, through our present ruin,
nothing to bring."</p>

<p>"I have sufficient to treat you according to your estate, Honor,
happy is he who can get and keep a noble gentlewoman like yourself.
If you could be at ease in this marriage, you would give me
gracious advantages, nay, dear heart, we have known each other
long, though formally, pray don't think I speak in a careless way,
now pray don't."</p>

<p>"I may not, if I would, be nice or difficult," she answered
seriously, looking away. "But you, sir, should satisfy a woman with
every right to be exacting. I do accept you, as my brother,
advises. May," she added quickly, "we each bring a deep and
diligent care to the other's misfortune."</p>

<p>Moved by her youth, her submission and her trouble, he answered,
plain and opened-hearted:</p>

<p>"You shall be my best and dearest friend, Honor."</p>

<p>"God grant as much," she said, and escaped him with a profound
reverence.</p>

<p>Honor de Burgh thus accepted Patrick Sarsfield candidly, without
confusion. He thought her too young to have any knowledge of love
or life, and pitied her simple innocence. She was small, elegant
and lively, well graced and finely bred. He vowed desperately to
attach her to him by every means in his power. She would give him
peace, a sense of reality, children. With her, and his estates, and
the war he would be able to be done with many dreams.</p>

<p>But the next morning when he learnt that the king sickened and
would halt for some days at Mallow, Patrick Sarsfield obtained
leave for a few hours and at once mounted the fine gray he had
bought at Kinsale and took the road for Killarney. As soon as he
was clear of the noise of the little town suddenly invaded by
soldiers and foreigners, and the defilements of the camp, his
nostrils expanded and he breathed in the pure air with delight. It
was still raining and there was a warm hush over the newly-budding
trees; odours of wet ferns and mosses which he had not known for
ten years filled him with an inexpressible, almost an incredible
pleasure; his whole heart and being lifted towards the blue line of
the Killarney Mountains robed in the pearly azure of interchanging
misty cloud-shapes. No country surely was ever as green as Ireland;
even now, in the early spring, lush grasses were vivid as jewels;
the strong curled fronds of the young ferns, the small thick buds
on the lofty trees seemed alike of a pure richness of verdure
unknown anywhere else, and nowhere was there this blue pearliness
of distance, this hyacinth azure of hills and clouds, this
rippling, cerulean, violet-silver of silent lakes.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield's heart hardened against all those men whom he
had left behind in Mallow&mdash;greedy, autocratic, domineering
foreigners, or Irishmen who had lived abroad so long that they had
forgotten their blood...</p>

<p>He reached at the evening the solitary mansion of the MacCarthys
where he had parted from Olivia. It was deserted, a witness to the
devastation of war. Bare willows which he remembered in full
leafage swept the lawns of last year's grass grown long and coarse.
The gate was broken between the stone posts, a blackening of smoke
showed on one side of the house. Sarsfield rode on, frowning; he
knew that Ireland would be ruined like that from shore to shore,
with neighbour risen against neighbour, countryman against
countryman; rapine, bloodshed, murder, bitterness, fury, and
restrained, but now suddenly loosened hatred, devastated Ireland.
So much Patrick Sarsfield knew, but it was difficult to credit it
in the perfect peace of the Kerry landscape.</p>

<p>He turned sadly away from the sight of the deserted mansion; he
saw a girl walking by the hedgerow beyond the fallen wall. She wore
a drugget petticoat and a dark shawl, but her gait was not that of
a peasant. He knew her at once for Ishma O'Donaghoe, the woman with
whom he had exchanged the love-charm under the haunted yews. She
walked slowly like one musing pleasantly; the breeze divided her
hair into long strands that blew softly about her fine head. She
seemed full of delicate thoughts. The wan light, falling through
the bare trees, fell like a gift of fine gold on to her open
bosom.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-5" id="ch1-5"></a>FIVE</h2>

<p class="first">
PATRICK SARSFIELD, eager, nervous, reined up his horse and gazed
at the girl who lingered by the leafless yet fragrant hedgerow with
the first young weeds, green and hardy, springing strongly round
her sandalled feet. He conceded to himself a freedom to escape from
the world of commonplace into that visionary realm where he was
most at ease.</p>

<p>He felt that his return to this desolate place had been long
expected, as if the girl standing there had the power to summon
him, that the years which had passed since he had first seen her
were no matter at all; she seemed to him one of those lovely mystic
creatures who have strange knowledge and the gift to know the
hidden mysteries because they stand apart from all the gross
violences and bitter desires of life.</p>

<p>He noted that she carried a little gray ash wilding, and he
recalled the tale which said this was sacred, and held by holy
women when they prayed and cherished by those who timidly fill
their lives with deeds of fruitful graciousness and generous
kindness.</p>

<p>She moved a little towards him and he recalled an old saying
(heard in his childhood) applied to those who had this lightness of
step, so delicate that, like the old warriors of the Sidhe, it
seemed as if they might pass over a rotting bough and never break
it. "He has danced to faery music on the green hills," was said of
such. Part of the old life of ancient Ireland was this woman, part
of the old deeds, and music, and words, and beliefs which the
conquering English had trampled into the dust; he felt the whole
country enclose her with a clear love.</p>

<p>"You are early," she said.</p>

<p>Her shawl had fallen back, her dark hair had a purple look like
the depths of her native hills, her shirt was of pleated linen of
saffron Irish yellow. A torque of native gold held together the
folds across her breast. She was the colour of honeysuckle buds,
faintly golden, firm of contour, with the bloom given by wind and
rain; her eyes were gray as wood ash or chilled early violets.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield dismounted and stood by his horse. He doubted
now if she was Ishma O'Donaghoe whom he had held for so brief a
moment in his arms beneath the magic yew...that dark night of
blowing rain in the Abbey of Irrelagh became one with many nights
of dreams when he and this woman had met.</p>

<p>Looking at him she sighed deeply, and crossed herself as a girl
might who gazes at the ghost of her lover.</p>

<p>"Are you coming to the lake?" she asked, she touched him with
the ash wand which is so powerful a charm against all manner of
witchcraft and evil, she was very serious; she seemed to cleave to
him with full purpose of heart.</p>

<p>Leading his horse Patrick Sarsfield walked beside her down the
muddy narrow lane. A mild wind shook the buds on the high trees.
They turned away from the desolate mansion of the MacCarthys and
followed the rough track through groves of alder, of sycamore and
of oak to the banks of the great lake. A deep love for the noble
shape of the mountains rising like castles from the still dark
water, for the mist and the rain and the clouds, for the woman
beside him, combined into one passion in the heart of Patrick
Sarsfield, it was a passion touched also with an infinite
melancholy...he was an exile from his beloved, almost an alien, he
had missed so much.</p>

<p>He thought with horror of his companions on the voyage, of the
old, sick, peevish king; of the shrewd, keen, managing Frenchman;
of the dishonest, quarrelling, chaffering, bargaining men who
surrounded both; of their jealousy, greed and self-seeking. He
thought with profound bitterness of the days when his beautiful
Ireland had only native kings and native swords to protect her,
when saints and faeries had mingled on the gentle undulating hills
and in the lush secret valleys and by the banks of the gray, still
rivers.</p>

<p>Looking at the girl beside him he thought of Oonagh, the wife of
Finvarra, King of the Unseen People, the Sidhe, who were once holy
in Paradise, but who had lost their immortal souls and are doomed
to the horror of utter annihilation at the Day of Judgment; yet
while they live they have all that is rapturous and dwell in magic
palaces of translucent emerald in the heart of the green hills;
youth, loveliness, pleasure and music have been given to the Sidhe;
yet often they are driven to despair with the madness of longing
for the immortality which they may never obtain.</p>

<p>Their melodies, Sarsfield knew, were of a music so plaintive, so
mournful and poignant that it had the power to enchant the soul out
of man, and he remembered how the Shanahus, ten years ago, in the
ruins of Irrelagh, had told him that it would be best for him if he
could hear such music and forget the earth, and all which he might
be appointed to do in this earthly life&mdash;"a little sleep, a little
slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep."</p>

<p>"You are not a stranger, but you come in the attire of a
stranger," said the girl; there was a hand's breadth between them;
she caressed the horse as the animal walked quietly, fatigued with
the long ride.</p>

<p>"It is only the attire," answered Sarsfield, "my heart is
here."</p>

<p>"But how long you have been away!"</p>

<p>"Was it you I met in the twilight of Irrelagh?"</p>

<p>She did not reply. Had it been she, she must have been young
indeed, younger than he...for now she seemed but in the full bud of
youth. She asked him, as if it were but a matter of simple
courtesy, if he would come to her abode and partake of food. She
did not demand his business, why he was there, or what was the
uniform he wore, or express any fear, though she seemed to live
lonely in the midst of a land rent by war. He thought her protected
by invisible powers...that there were guides and seers about her,
who would not suffer her to miscarry.</p>

<p>She led him along a winding path bordered by low evergreen
plants of fresh green; the noise of water tumbling heavily was in
his ears; a turn brought them in sight of a water-break, dispersing
in swirling foam among smooth greenish rocks and leaping in
darkening violence towards a gloomy gorge that opened into the
shining lake beneath.</p>

<p>Young ferns uncurled, varied mosses showed cold green against
the wet boulders, fine spray hung in the chill air; behind a
cluster of brilliant-leaved holly trees stood a beehive-shaped
oratory or chapel, pierced with rude windows and surrounded by a
low wall of undressed stone; the broken base of a round tower stood
close, from the centre of which grew the smooth gray stems of young
ash trees and beyond this a scatter of huts; there were no graves,
for people would carry their dead weary miles to rest in Mucruss
Abbey; the huts were sheltered from the waterfall by an arm of
rock.</p>

<p>The air on the wooded shore was warm and mild, filled with the
eternal noise of the falling waters which gleamed behind the
church; misty shadows of clouds lay over the distant heather-purple
mountains glimpsed beyond the gorge; there was a tang in
Sarsfield's nostrils of peat smoke, of wet earth, of fresh, first
sprouting buds; his nostalgia became almost unbearable.</p>

<p>The girl led him to the most important of the huts, built of
hard green stone in the old wattle shape with a rectangular doorway
and a little window in the eastern wall; he had to stoop low to
enter, holding his sword close to his side and pulling off his
great cockaded hat; a barefoot beautiful boy, girdled with rags,
had led away his horse. As Sarsfield straightened himself inside
the cottage he looked at the maiden who was regarding him
gravely.</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Ishma O'Donaghoe."</p>

<p>There was an aged woman baking cakes amid the fine clean embers;
he believed she was the Shanahus of ten years ago, withered like a
bat, like the Phouca, with her hare-skin cap and drugget gown. All
the Irishman's haunted blood saw the supernatural in this scene&mdash;in
the quiet girl in her ancient dress, the withered woman, in the
loneliness of these few huts, the grand beauty of the waterfall,
the untouched trees and the hoary rocks, azure and emerald, the
temperate wind, the veiled, opal gray skies. He forgot the routine
he had left, the routine that awaited him, even the uniform that he
wore, and that he must return to Mallow.</p>

<p>He sat on a wooden stool by the fire of arbutus wood which burnt
slowly into white ash. Salmon and trout were cooking beside the
cakes, there was an oak noggin of goat's milk and two platters set
ready.</p>

<p>The girl shook off her shawl and her purple-black hair fell
tangled over the saffron-dyed bodice. He was convinced that these
people knew nothing of the commotions about them, that they lived
in the old Ireland of the saints and the Sidhe, the mists and the
rainbows, the harpers and the poets, the seers and the wise men. He
wished that he also lived in that world which was where his soul
belonged. His elbows on his knees, holding his face in his hands,
he asked them "if they had seen any of the fighting and the
troubles?"</p>

<p>The old woman crossed herself, the girl touched the beads of
carved black bog oak which hung at her waist.</p>

<p>"We are under a protection here," they answered together.</p>

<p>They spoke the old Irish of which he could understand very
little, and their English was laboured and difficult, yet soft with
a melancholy inflection. And he forgot his French and his court
English, and answered them in a simple language which had the same
inflection which his nurse had taught him at Lucan; it came back
very easily to his tongue.</p>

<p>The old woman said that on the coast of Cork and Kerry, and in
the dark defiles of Munster there were pirates and smugglers and
wild evil men, that these had lately come their way, robbing,
burning and slaying what they might find; then they had gone again
discovering but little, for the land had long since been laid waste
by Cromwell and the English, the Kingdom of O'Donaghoe had been
desolate for two generations. As the old woman served the meal on
the wooden bench she nodded and laughed towards the musing
girl:</p>

<p>"She is a princess, a king's daughter; by right the Queen of all
Kerry. The English thought they had slain every O'Donaghoe, but her
father was left and was brought up secretly. He married a
descendant of Donald MacCarthy Môr, who built the Abbey of
Irrelagh, and this is their daughter, and there has been no greater
Iady in Ireland since Queen Maeve of Connaught."</p>

<p>Like one spinning a tale she continued her low speech. Patrick
Sarsfield cared nothing that what she said was wild, incredible.
She spoke of the extermination of the royal line of O'Donaghoe by
Ludlow who brought ships on to the lake and took Ross Castle&mdash;as
the old wise sibyls had prophesied. And told how one little child
had been hidden by his nurse and had grown up to wed a daughter of
the sept of MacCarthy Môr, and how, loving each other as if they
were chained together with gold, they had been taken young by the
Sidhe to dwell beneath the lake.</p>

<p>"They died," said Sarsfield.</p>

<p>The Shanahus ignored this; she continued her story. She declared
that the Lady Ishma had been served by her, as if she was a
princess indeed. She had often taken her to Ross Island, and they
had wandered together over the mighty keep where Ishma's
forefathers had watched, they had mounted the spiral staircase to
the summit of the square tower whence they could see the disused
copper mines which were full of unseen folk. Often had Ishma stood
in the ruins of the great window from which the O'Donaghoe leapt on
his white charger into the noble lake.</p>

<p>"You know," said Ishma, turning on Sarsfield her eyes, the
colour of fading violets, "that every seventh year he rises from
the waters and rides over the surface of Lough Lein."</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>He thought she was indeed like one of royal birth, and he had
known many palace-born, sumptuous ladies; it was easy to see that
she had never done manual work, that she had been carefully tended,
bathed, combed and waited upon, and that she accepted this service
with ingenuous simplicity; her ankles and wrists were very
delicate, her step very light, she had an easy stateliness and the
gaiety of one who leads naturally a chaste and pious life; though
sweetly coloured by sun, wind and rain and perfumed only by
hedgerow flowers, she was in nothing common.</p>

<p>The young man said:</p>

<p>"You do not know my name. I am Patrick Sarsfield of Lucan."</p>

<p>"I know you very well," replied the Shanahus.</p>

<p>"Should you ever be able to find me of service I shall be in
Dublin, or be heard of there."</p>

<p>"Dublin is a long way off," said Ishma. "Weary would be the need
and sad, could take one so far."</p>

<p>An Irish wolf-hound walked softly in through the doorway, he
came up to Sarsfield and laid his head on the man's knee, looking
up with keen and affectionate topaz-coloured eyes. The girl smiled
and the old woman seemed pleased; she was certainly the Shanahus;
she began to recite a fragment of an old bardic description of a
dog in the ornate language of the professional storyteller.</p>

<p>"We call him Bran, who was the dog of the great Fionn Macoul. Is
he not the same, a ferocious, small-headed, white-breasted,
big-haunched hound? With the eyes of a dragon, the claws of a wolf,
the vigour of a lion, the venom of a serpent?"</p>

<p>Sarsfield put out his hand in warm greeting to stroke the
animal's head. He then saw beneath the rough, clean fur a splendid
collar of plaited, greenish gold and silver exquisitely
interwrought. The old woman's wrinkled smile deepened. She glanced
up and down the magnificence of Sarsfield and crooned:</p>

<p>"A noble, handsome, fair-haired Fianian, young, courteous,
manly, puissant; powerful in action, tallest of the warriors,
strongest of the champions, most beautiful of the human
race..."</p>

<p>And she went on to mutter about the great Fianna meeting when
three thousand princes had gathered with three thousand hounds. A
fine army truly was this. All the knights wearing silk under their
mail, mantles the hue of spring leaves and pleated, violet-coloured
burnished cloaks, gold and flashing diamond helmets on their heads,
a keen javelin in each man's hand...She began to tell the story of
Bran, the mighty wolf-hound of Fionn, who chased the ice-white hart
over the endless blue hills, until the pursued animal leaped into
the cold purple lake and was changed into the form of a handsome,
enticing woman who drew the noble dog down beneath the silent
water...this creature was not really lovely or gracious, but was
called the "Hag of the Lake," a foul, clever witch, and "many times
still will she work her evil spells...She might sometimes be seen
in the dark gloom of a dreadful day washing her clothes in some
stormy dark inlet of the lake...monstrous, dreadful, the wind
blowing her out of one terrible shape into another..."</p>

<p>Ishma spoke across this tale, a voice of gold over the elder
woman's mutter.</p>

<p>"Why have you been away so long?" she asked. "Why have you come
back now?"</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield tried to tell her of the war which had blazed
up in their country, of the king in France who had sent men and
money, and stores to assist the King of England to regain his
throne, but all this sounded dry, and trite, and sordid on his
tongue, and indeed he had himself largely forgotten the rights and
the wrongs of the quarrel.</p>

<p>The two women, the hut of dark-green stone, and the meal of fish
and bread cooked on the embers, the bowl of milk and the wooden
platters, the view of the lake and the rain from the window, the
perfume from the arbutus ash, and the musing eyes of Ishma in the
oval Irish face, reduced all those heavy worldly matters to
ridiculous folly; here all was firmly settled and well grounded in
peace.</p>

<p>They served him as if he were a prince and he, who had always
been set aside and sneered at for an Irishman, thwarted and
chagrined by his nationality, found himself honoured for the sake
of his race. Here he was no mere adventuring alien, proscribed
papist, set below the foreigner, overlooked and jostled in the race
for preferment and honours, he was a prince, descendant of
MacCarthy Môr, heir to the splendid chieftain who had fought with
Brian Boru at the battle of Clontarf; so much the Shanahus seemed
to know of him, though he never spoke of these things.</p>

<p>They brought out treasures from a cupboard of oak wood. There
was a magnificent royal chess-board made of the bones of the king's
enemies, the old woman said, a precious stone in every square, and
a bag of woven gold wire in which to keep the pieces, some of which
were of shining wood and some of yellow ivory. Ishma had ornaments
besides the torque she wore&mdash;rings, bracelets and pins, all of pure
gold, Irish gold, she said, twisted in intricate patterns, which
had been long lying in the earth, turned up by spade or harrow from
the long green raths in the days when Kerry was prosperous.</p>

<p>"Take me," said Patrick Sarsfield, "to the ruins of
Irrelagh."</p>

<p>The old woman watched them depart. They thought from the look of
her that she gave them her blessing. She said (and surely she was a
witch-wife) that this night the kingly ghost might leap from the
hollow walls of Ross castle and ride across the surface of the
lake...</p>

<p>"She is a wise woman?" asked Patrick Sarsfield, as they walked
through the short grass, beginning to show the luscious green of
spring, and the spray of the water-break.</p>

<p>Ishma replied that the woman was a descendant of the secret
people, bards or storytellers, who acquired great wisdom. She knew
the ancient, venerable language and minstrelsy, and the powers of
sacred herbs; she could cure disease, cause love or hatred, peer
into the mysteries of life and death, and even converse with the
unseen people; she knew in what lonely glen to pluck the faery
plant which was sought for its potency in divination. She had
learnt the worth of dark ivy, pungent vervaine, eye-bright,
groundsel, deadly foxglove, and the bark of the elder tree and the
young shoots of the hawthorn. She could tell where to find the
magic elf stone near an ancient rath which, being once lifted up
with a spade, must never touch earth again or all its virtue is
gone...She was skilful to make a plaister for wounds from the wood
wind-flowers and in using the many properties of the hazel tree and
the yarrow, the best cure for many diseases; she knew too the faery
grass of straysod which is dangerous to step on, for whoever puts
his foot on the path it grows on will travel on without stopping,
following an irresistible impulse, all through the night, delirious
and restless, over bog and mountain, through hedges and ditches
till, wearied and bruised, he finds himself&mdash;where? All those who
touch the faery grass have a sensation of flying and are unable to
pause or turn back or change their career.</p>

<p>"It is called the straysod or faery grass among us mortals,"
said Ishma; "but its real name no one will dare to pronounce."</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield smiled at her. He thought that he might truly
say that he had touched some such magic herb, for he had forgotten
all his yesterdays and felt indeed as if he asked no more than for
ever to travel beside this woman along the shores of the lake.
Though he had forgotten everything that till this morning he had
considered of importance, forgotten even his restless and
devastating passion for Olivia Joyce, and the formal pledge he had
given to Honor de Burgh, yet he could remember very clearly the
charm he had repeated under the yew tree nearly ten years
before:</p>

<p><i>"As the sun follows its course, mayest thou follow me, woman!
As light to the eye, as bread to the hungry, as joy to the heart,
may thy presence be with me, O woman that I love, till death come
to part us asunder."</i>
</p>

<p>He looked down at Ishma, walking stately and simple, beside
him.</p>

<p>"Did you say a love-charm with me many years past in the holy
Abbey of Irrelagh?"</p>

<p>She replied:</p>

<p>"It is you who should remember."</p>

<p>As she led him through the braes into the old gray alabaster
cloisters she said with a touching look of faith:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will give you a charm&mdash;The fair man and the turbulent woman
who laid Christ in the grave&mdash;a charm which God made for Himself
when His divinity within Him was darkened..."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-6" id="ch1-6"></a>SIX</h2>

<p class="first">
IN the cool cloistral shade of one of the cells, which yet
remained well roofed from the weather, Ishma O'Donaghoe had laid
fragrant bracken which served as a couch. Thin webs of moisture,
one behind the other, descended till stone and early greenery were
all alike spangled with the sweet mild rain which seemed visibly to
draw forth life from the earth; Ishma invited Patrick Sarsfield to
the clean dryness of the cell. Through the open door they could see
the moss-grown cloisters and the shadowed arcade where grew the
gigantic tree. Behind the cold dead blackness of the yew which wore
withered winter foliage, dropped last faint gleams of sun and
Patrick Sarsfield, standing at the door of the fern-lined cell and
looking out, felt that his senses presented to him some mock world,
some wrack of old sleepy dreams which it was agony to remember and
despair to forget. Ishma clasped her hands round her knees and
began to tell him of herself, as if he were an ancient lover newly
returned, yet in all she did and said she was impersonal.</p>

<p>She told him of her life with the Shanahus in the hut by the
edge of the lake, of her deep, tangled memories of the green
valleys, of fern-plumed shores and the azure-opal mountains, and
the skies of endless movement and change and of all the unseen
people unthwarted who had made this solitude crowded to the mind.
She spoke of the treasure she had saved from the princely fortunes
of her ancestors&mdash;the fine, pale Irish gold, the chessmen, and the
collar of the wolf-hound&mdash;buried all very deeply in a crock outside
the hut like the treasure of the leprechaun at the rainbow's
end&mdash;for fear, she said, of pirates and smugglers and the wild men
or rapparees.</p>

<p>Sarsfield asked her if she felt safe in her green solitude, and
if the late war, the springing to arms of all the country, had made
any difference to her retreat.</p>

<p>Ishma seemed surprised at this and answered, "No."</p>

<p>There had always been war and tumult not far from the kingdom of
Kerry, but they were too poor to attract any marauders, she was
surprised that the mansion of the MacCarthys had been burnt down.
Then she glanced at him and laughed with the candour of a child,
and put her hands behind her neck, looking past him at the pale
fire of the sky gleaming beyond the monstrous darkness of the
yew.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield wished that he could reconcile the world in
which she lived with the world from which he had come and to which
he must return, but he knew that this was hopeless. Never could he
take her away from the lake's edge, her safe solitude, and never
could she draw him to remain with her there. And, while he looked
at her, old mists of fancy obscured all reality, but he strove to
tell her something of his task, why he had come to Ireland and what
he hoped to do, and his heart ached because she did not
understand.</p>

<p>The slant sun pierced the light clouds and fell athwart the yew
tree into the unglazed window of the cell in which she sat, tufts
of early grass were by her feet near the dried gold of last year's
ferns and through the aperture trailed stiff, hairy tendrils of
ivy, showing the first hard red-green of the new leaves. The lonely
silence was sweet as honey, pure as the rain.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield broke his casual whispered talk. He heard his
own voice tremble to a dim eagerness.</p>

<p>"Can you remember coming here and exchanging a love charm with
me? Was it you trapping me, unwary, to a desolate dream?"</p>

<p>Ishma looked at him; she was neither disturbed nor
discontented.</p>

<p>The last sunlight strengthened and made a shower of golden
sparkles in the delicate moisture of the air. Dank and cold from
years of rain, the alabaster of the cloisters shone like muted
silver in the ebbing rain; in the rich black loam beneath the yew
Sarsfield saw the splendour of toadstools and fungi not an hour old
but brocaded like kings. Protected by the magic yew and by the
haunted cloisters from what men call the world, there was nothing
to break the golden shadows of their mutual dreams.</p>

<p>Seated on her rough bed of ferns Ishma answered gravely, like
one searching for the exact truth; he thought that never before had
she been asked in her shadow-life to grasp realities; that, moving
through the dun twilight of flower-seeking, never before had she
been asked to face the bright noisy day. He thought, too, that she
hardly knew the difference between the deep chill of death and the
fiery heat of love.</p>

<p>"It may be," she said carefully, "that I have met you before,
and even exchanged with you some vows&mdash;standing by a cold fountain
in the green rock or watching the changing lake; the Shanahus would
tell me many things, when I was young I always found light and
shade mingled, nor could really tell one from the other. But I have
met armoured heroes, princes of the Fianna, knights of Mirvanna,
and perhaps," she added with a poignant simplicity, "you were one
of those."</p>

<p>"I am no armoured hero nor shining god, but a poor mortal man,"
and it was in him to beseech her to come out of her endless world
of fantastic dreaming and look upon him as he was.</p>

<p>"You have met me before," he insisted. "Why did you bring me to
this place?"</p>

<p>She scrutinised him carefully and rose, leaning against the wall
of the cell, so that the hesitant light from the window was full on
her noble head and tender throat. The thinning rain clouds had let
through the tender azure fire of the sinking March sun, and the
little cell was illuminated as if with light reflected from a clear
blue jewel.</p>

<p>"I do not know," she said. "At times the Shanahus has had a
charm on me, and I have gone I know not where and returned I know
not when. I have feasted in the crystal bright mansions of
Mirvanna, in the heart of the mountains, and sailed along pale
streams that had no end, and met the ancient knights in their
silken raiment, the scarlet sashes and the gold bands on their
heads, and I have been below the lake in a city that has many round
towers and bells that ring continuously."...Her voice was
dove-soft, hoarse yet sweet. "It may be that among these adventures
I found my lover."</p>

<p>"Did you not say to me," asked Patrick Sarsfield eagerly,
forgetting all else, "did you not say to me, 'Could you not join
your fate with mine?'"</p>

<p>"If I had met my lover so might I have spoken. But why do you
question me? If we are bound together with a charm we must meet
again and again until at the end we are together always."</p>

<p>And he remembered the words she had spoken ten years ago so near
this spot..."My face turned away from all others."</p>

<p>"Do you like me?" he asked. "Do you wish me to stay?" He felt
like a shadow seeking consolation in a world of shadows that was as
bright as tossed water, glittering in airy descent to vanish for
ever into the earth; the light coming through the rain mist closed
over them.</p>

<p>"It matters not if you go or stay," said, Ishma. "If you are
indeed my lover."</p>

<p>He frowned down at his sword which looked fierce and alien in
this place.</p>

<p>"Am I to be like a drifting weed? To come and go knowing nothing
of the wherefore?"</p>

<p>But he knew that he could never take her with him into the hard,
sensual world to which he had been given as a child and to which he
now belonged. If the eyes of curiosity, lust and greed, maybe of
mockery and laughter, flicked over her she would die, as a
wind-flower, taken from the dewy wood into a close room lit with
gross wax candles, dies. And the other alternative? To leave
everything of action, of manliness, of decision, of danger, and
stay with her in her forgotten and forsaken kingdom, haunted by the
rain-blowing wind, fair days, fantastic nights, all shot with
changing glories of dreams...She seemed to him to be shut in a
paradise to which he had no entry. The lewd din of the world he had
left clanged like brass in his ears; compared with all he had ever
known of women she was like the very source of a light so blinding
that he must shield his eyes.</p>

<p>He left the fern-lined cell and walked in the gray-green
cloisters. He was still so far away from her that he could not
imagine what it would be like to love her, to hold her like a
lakeside flower, dewy from dawn rays, in his bosom. He felt that he
must be purged of much before he could completely understand her or
touch her hand with a sense of equality.</p>

<p>She came out of the cloistered chilliness of her cell; she was
as glamorous to him as if she had drawn over her head the dark hood
of magic. Dumb and listless he leant against the ashen-coloured
pillars carved by pious hands so many centuries ago. He was
bareheaded, and the sunburnt fairness of his blond hair, radiant as
scorched gold, seemed too bright for the rain-wreaths shot with the
pale spangles of the March sun, for the alabaster of the
rain-stained cloisters, for the blackness of the wintry yew.</p>

<p>"Am I to be a drifting weed on a dark stream?" he repeated.</p>

<p>She seemed surprised at his question, as if she was secure that
she did not know what either danger or discontent meant. She said
with a sudden touching warmth of feeling:</p>

<p>"Wherever you go and whatever you do, Knight of Mirvanna, may
the blessing of Christ, St. Bridget and St. Patrick rest upon you
and your deeds."</p>

<p>Conscious neither of hyperbole nor exaggeration, he
answered:</p>

<p>"I wish I could do some deed of arms to restore you to your
kingdom, Princess."</p>

<p>Ishma was used to this mode of address from the Shanahus and the
other dwellers in the little village by the lake, and acknowledged
it by a glance of grave courtesy, then asked him, as if there were
no question but of their parting, if he would not be on his way
again?</p>

<p>"How few come here, and how long I shall remember this coming of
yours!" She led him again to the graves, pointing out where kings
and chieftains lay beneath stones carved with mystic letters,
uncouth Latin and ancient Irish.</p>

<p>As he trampled these rain-wet graves, the glowing splendour of
him in his magnificent manhood turned all this into but a dark
sadness of cold decay. The rainy wind lifted his harsh, stiff hair
from his shoulders. He ceased to feel that he was Patrick
Sarsfield, newly-created brigadier in His Britannic Majesty's
non-existent army, he ceased to remember that he was Patrick
Sarsfield of Lucan. He was part of the rain-wet soil from which the
ashes and sycamores had sprung, part of the bones of the dead men
lying beneath. He felt their ancient pride and splendour, their
aspirations and frustrations, their generous arrogance and their
noble princeliness, their complete defeat, fused in his blood. And
in the still woman walking beside him in her pleated saffron linen,
her peasant's gown, her blue-black rain-wet hair loose on her
shoulders, he saw the heiress of all dead, beautiful Ireland, of
all that was brave and magical in the country.</p>

<p>As they neared the village the ragged boy brought the horse
(which Patrick Sarsfield had bought in Kinsale) towards them
through the short tufts of sweet new grass. It was a splendid
animal and stepped finely, and Sarsfield thought of the great
ancient necromancers who built forts in the hills and bred steeds;
"that could not be surpassed in the world, with arched necks, broad
chests and quivering nostrils like fire and flame; they were shod
with bright silver, had bridles of precious plaited gold and no
slave was allowed to ride them. A splendid sight it was to see the
knights of Tuatha Danann riding in a stately procession, each with
a starlike jewel on his white forehead; all such as were kings had
folded grass-green mantles fringed with the precious gold, and
casques crested with living blooms on their heads, each having in
his long fine hand a delicate golden spear..."</p>

<p>This fragment from an ancient tale told in the words of his old
nurse who had brought him up at her knee in Lucan before he went
abroad to serve the alien, flashed across the mind of Sarsfield, as
he saw the horse of noble blood being led towards him, and walked
with the woman by the shore of the tumbling water...he also
remembered the story of the Queen, Ireland's Helen, who had been
taken away by Midir, chief of the unseen people; the song by which
he had won her from the feast held by her husband, the King of
Munster, had been chanted to Sarsfield in his childhood.</p>

<p>"O woman, if thou comest to my proud people, the golden crown
shall circle thy head, thou shalt dwell in the sweetness of my land
and drink mead as wine in the arms of thy lover."</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield looked down at the girl beside him and wished
that he could put his arm round her waist and lead her away into
the mountains, or to the crystal and coral under the water.</p>

<p>But Ishma said nothing to detain him; she had no arts or any
guile, and even as he saw the ancient church and the hovels he
steadied himself by the thought of common things and told his
incredulous soul that she was but a peasant, maybe of the ancient
Irish blood, but living in a manner which the English would call
barbaric, knowing nothing but the sights of nature which had been
round her from her birth, the ancient mysteries and old-time
legends which had been told her since she could understand any
word; shadowy traditions and fantastic dreams nourished her; in
those twilight ways she would always walk, nor could he, if he
would, disturb her.</p>

<p>Yet it might be that in leaving her he put by the dearest gifts
that any God could ever offer him.</p>

<p>He crossed his brow and then his breast and took her little
rain-wet hand and pressed it beneath his and, looking into the
childlike radiance of her gray eyes, he forgot both Olivia Joyce
and Honor de Burgh and almost that there was any other place in the
world besides this.</p>

<p>"Why have you been so kind to me and treated me with such
hospitality and charity?"</p>

<p>She replied, not lowering her eyes:</p>

<p>"So I have been taught, for any wayfarer might be a holy saint
or a Knight of the Fianna in disguise. And you have treated me with
the true courtesy which is beloved both of the holy men and the
invisible people, who hate a meanness and are never malignant nor
harsh-natured."</p>

<p>The spring sunshine was then full over them, the veils of rain
had drawn away across the lake and had flushed into azure emerald
over the distant mountains.</p>

<p>She left her hand between his and added earnestly:</p>

<p>"It might be that you are bound to me by some charm, for I think
I recall some dream within a vision, when I said the words that
bound me to some such knight as your self, but take no heed for
that, go your way. But, if we are thus enchained together, our
souls entangled, we shall meet when God and the invisible people
will." Then she took her hand from his and crossed her forehead and
breast.</p>

<p>There seemed a great urgency on Patrick Sarsfield to depart. He
turned and rode away and did not look back. The road wound swiftly;
the church, the huts and the pasturage in the hollow of the shore
by the lake beneath the water-break were soon hidden by dark purple
rocks and trees heavy with March buds. He passed the broken walls
and fallen gate-posts of the mansion of the MacCarthys and did not
think of Olivia Joyce; and so rode long and slowly through the
night; only when he returned to Mallow and saw the sordid
defilements of the encampment about him again, and heard the
shouting and the clamour which marked the coming and going of many
strangers, did he recall that he had bound himself in honour to
Honor de Burgh, and his heart sank; though there was no fickleness
in him, he had found himself against his will entangled with three
women.</p>

<p>The cavalcade was taking the desolate Dublin road. Henry
Luttrell sought out Patrick Sarsfield and smiled at him as if he
knew where he had been...so long away.</p>

<p>"You are a dreamer," he mocked. "I believe you have forgotten
even why we are all here. Why did you ride away into the
wilderness?"</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield did not answer that question.</p>

<p>"I am a poor dreamer," he said with self-contempt, "for I have
not the courage to believe in my dreams."</p>

<p>"We all have need of them," mocked Luttrell, "and it's little
else we'll get here, I dare swear&mdash;the French already feel they've
been bubbled, De Rosen has the temper of a Bedlamite."</p>

<p>They fell into their several places in the procession of
horsemen and wound their way towards Dublin. The sun clouded over
suddenly and the rain fell heavily from a low sky. The banners that
were borne before them sank in heavy dripping folds.</p>

<p class="first">
PATRICK SARSFIELD felt the need of a miracle to reconcile him
with life, so piteous was the difference between what he would have
and what he must endure. The thought was too strong to be
suppressed; he put it into words addressed to his companion, Olivia
de Bonnac; brave and gay she replied immediately:</p>

<p>"You have your miracle&mdash;the Irish flag over Dublin Castle."</p>

<p>He smiled at her quickness and at the stinging truth behind her
comment&mdash;Dublin had never been Irish, but the city of the
conqueror, the alien and the usurper. Every stone in it was a
symbol of the subjection of the native population; the memories of
its walls and streets were those most hateful and humiliating to an
Irishman, and, as Olivia had reminded him with some touch of irony,
this was the first time in the hundreds of years since the city had
been built that the native flag had been broken above the sombre
citadel built to overawe the native Irish.</p>

<p>"It may not fly there long, or ever again," she reminded him
with a sudden restlessness in her demeanour. "Why must you trouble
yourself about these things? A miracle," she added sharply. "You
waste life looking for miracles."</p>

<p>"I waste time here," he reminded her gently, and he pondered
what she had said. Yes, even now when the proud flag with
Tyrconnel's motto "Now or Never, Now and For Ever" hung above the
castle, it could not be said that an Irishman of the old race ruled
there. The new Irish banner hung over a horde of foreigners,
self-seeking, obeying an alien master; and Sarsfield, walking up
and down the elegant chamber, confessed to the woman, who regarded
him with a barely-restrained impatience, that he was glad to be
away from the dark and gloomy castle of ugly history and ill omen
for all who named themselves Irish.</p>

<p>"That is why you come to be partaker of my leisure, I suppose,
Colonel Sarsfield? Not for the pleasure of my company but to be
away from work?"</p>

<p>The Marquis de Bonnac had hired a fashionable house in Skinner's
Row close to the pompous mansions of the Butlers and Geraldines.
Madame de Bonnac had surrounded herself with the costly modern
furnishings to which she had been used in Paris. Her extreme luxury
contrasted sharply with the stark poverty of the land to which she
had come and the already obvious embarrassment of the court to
which her husband was attached.</p>

<p>She idled by a desk of ivy and olive wood, in a gown of thick
gray satin cunningly arranged to show off her voluptuous shape. At
thirty years of age she was in the full bloom of a flamboyant
beauty. "<i>Belle à la folie</i>" Sarsfield had heard her named by
one of her countrymen. There was a radiance about her colouring, a
dazzle about her eyes, a rich grace about her movements which
prevented any but the coldest spectator from remarking her
defects&mdash;the underlip too heavy, the brown eyes too wide apart, the
neck too long, a certain native grossness that for all her dainty
breeding tainted her magnificence, but man must make beauty where
he can find even a hint of it, for Patrick Sarsfield, as for other
men, she offered enough out of which to create a goddess.</p>

<p>He asked her why she did not come more often to the court in
Dublin, where Tyrconnel's wife, Frances Jennings, and her three
daughters by her first marriage with Hamilton, contrived to make
some gaiety and diversion, though it was hectic and distraught, a
gilding of penury and alarm.</p>

<p>"I did not," replied Madame de Bonnac, "come to Ireland for
either gaiety or diversion."</p>

<p>"I wonder, madam, you came to Ireland at all," he smiled
candidly. "You live so close here that it must be very tiresome for
you to be mewed up after Paris."</p>

<p>"How do you know," she asked, "what my life has been in Paris?
Why do you suppose I should regret it? Did I not tell you at
Kinsale that I was not one of those women who could stay behind and
wait?"</p>

<p>"You wished to be with your husband?" remarked Sarsfield
quietly.</p>

<p>She replied: "My husband..." and there was a silence between
them.</p>

<p>Indeed he knew nothing of her life and little of the man to whom
she was married, save what was apparent to the most casual
observer; Mons. de Bonnac was a steady, efficient officer, a quiet,
self-controlled gentleman of whom no one had heard either much good
or any evil. It being impossible to discuss him, Sarsfield began to
speak of his own affairs, of his recent visit to his estates at
Lucan, and his busy recruiting for a troop of horse, of the Duke of
Berwick being sent to subdue Derry, and all the divisions there
were between De Rosen and Tyrconnel...Madame de Bonnac cut him
short with a sudden flare of impatience.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that you are so stupid as to come here and talk
to me of these affairs, or do you merely wish to torment me? You
know I detest my husband. Have you not even guessed it?"</p>

<p>The brutal statement came to Sarsfield with a certain shock. He
stood in the window-place looking at her intently, while she broke
out into a low railing against the man she had married, whispering
complaints and lamentations, all the familiar charges usually
brought by a partner in an unhappy marriage. The man neglected her,
ill-treated her, scorned her and spied on her, kept one miss after
another... Ah, his infidelities!</p>

<p>Sarsfield sickened to hear her speak so. He felt involved in a
subtle treachery, she debased herself in his estimation by these
spiteful complaints.</p>

<p>He felt that she should have endured anything rather than loosen
her secrets before him, and Olivia de Bonnac was clever enough to
see by his face that she was injuring herself in his regard. She
checked herself, furious at her indiscretion, and broke into tears,
genuine tears of disappointment, humiliation and anger; at that he
was deeply moved and blamed himself that he had judged her. Surely
she had a right to express her distress, surely he should have been
honoured that she had taken him into her confidence and he had been
petty-minded to condemn her...</p>

<p>He made an impulsive movement towards her where she sat gorgeous
at her elegant desk. She put out her beautiful hand appealingly,
and he stood holding it, gazing down on her, and thought of that
moment ten years ago in the old mansion of the MacCarthys, when the
rain had swept through the willows on to the lush grass of the lawn
and the rainbow had hovered over the golden-purple of the distant
hills, and life had seemed as untainted as an April flower.</p>

<p>"You used to love me," she whispered. "I came to Ireland to be
near you because I could not endure my barren life any longer...was
that a gross delusion? Do you, like the spider's web, deceive those
who trust you?"</p>

<p>"Olivia, I can be of no comfort to you. My hands are full with
many tasks and, I fear, mean affairs, and I am to be married to
Honor de Burgh."</p>

<p>"That child!" she exclaimed angrily. Contemptuously she pulled
her soft hand away. "A cold-hearted girl, artful, sly and
impertinent, who will make you her bubble on every pleasing
occasion." She rose to face him, turning on him her magnificent
tear-filled eyes full of reproach; her full, gleaming satin gown,
ample as it was, yet showed the outline of her long limbs.</p>

<p>He was conscious of something both tragic and splendid in her
demeanour which redeemed her words and her attitude from commonness
or spite; and, flushed and moved as she was, her rosy comeliness
shone very bright.</p>

<p>"You are a dreamer." Her words had the sound of an accusation.
"You think so much of Ireland that you have let the years go by and
done nothing for Ireland. You think so much of me, and the years
have gone by and you have done nothing for me. You have drifted
into a betrothal with this little creature who is a stranger to
you; you have never inquired whether I was not waiting for you. Was
I to rest for ever in a forced, girlish choice?"</p>

<p>"You were married, Olivia, and for all I knew happily."</p>

<p>"But you had not stopped for that?"</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield raised his hand and let it fall again. He
believed that he had loved her all these ten years with a hidden
aching torment of love, but never had he considered that he might
make her his mistress, and that seemed what she was offering on the
eve of his own wedding.</p>

<p>He was stirred, confused, excited; but there was too much
between them, his honour was nice and fastidious and even while
Madane de Bonnac looked at him with those passionate reproachful
eyes he remembered her husband and Galway's sister...he thought,
too, with an odd, perverse ache of disappointment, of the queenly
Irish girl with whom he had exchanged the vows under the black yew
of Irrelagh.</p>

<p>He turned from Olivia de Bonnac and looked out of the window
into the narrow, fashionable street, crowded with the coming and
going of the French, Scotch and Irish adherents of King James who
then overwhelmed the city. It had been weak of him ever to have
entered this elegant house in Skinner's Row, he must not come
again; he still believed her pride was stronger than her passion,
that she would wish him to forget what she had just said...as an
expedient for a sudden extremity.</p>

<p>Olivia de Bonnac watched this cold lover with a despairing
impatience.</p>

<p>Ever since her marriage she had regretted this man refused from
prudence; an unnecessary prudence, for he was now as rich as her
husband, better considered and more highly placed.</p>

<p>She wished she could read his mind or understand his hesitation.
Part of his persistent attraction for her was his difference from
other men (an extraordinary difference from her own countrymen),
yet this same strangeness then chafed her furiously. She stared at
him keenly and saw a gentle tenderness in his face; his attitude
was indolent and resigned, yet she knew his intelligence quick and
his nature passionate; she knew the deep well-springs of a fanatic
love for Ireland were within him.</p>

<p>Yet, what had he done, what would he do for Ireland?</p>

<p>She would have accepted his country if he had accepted her, and
she thought that she might have inspired him with those definite
aims, that earnest energy which is the mainspring of heroic
success. Yet for the moment she dare say no more, nor dissemble and
fawn, lest he should suddenly despise her as trivial or even base;
for, though she was without any high ideals herself, she sensed how
strongly he held to honour and virtue.</p>

<p>Sarsfield turned to glance at her and there was something wild
and woful in his gaze, as if he pleaded her indulgence for an
inevitable failure on his part; he took her hand again and kissed
it. She was too cunning to ask for an explanation; she had been
revealed to him and surely he must remember that...He looked at her
earnestly, still as if he entreated desperately for her
indulgence...</p>

<p>"It is as if a doom had been laid on us," he murmured. "In all I
attempt nothing goes fairly. I am diverted here and there, 'till at
last the end cometh like an armed man.'"</p>

<p>"'Tis in yourself the fault lies. Strike straight for what you
want, be bold and short with your desires."</p>

<p>He sighed without replying, and she could not keep the tremble
of warm scorn from her enchanting voice as she added:</p>

<p>"You do not know what you want, Colonel Sarsfield," and she was
the one who turned away to save herself the pang of being left;
there was nothing ignoble in her retreat.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield went out into the crowded narrow street and
passed through the fashionable locality inhabited by the followers
of King James round the castle. He tried to readjust his mind after
this poignant confession from Olivia de Bonnac. He told himself
that she was not for him and that he would not take her. It was too
late. Perhaps she expected of him, perhaps he ought to have felt, a
passion so overwhelming, so devastating, that he would have
responded at once to her proud advances. But this was not so. Had
it been so, he told himself, he would not have waited patiently,
away from her, for ten years. He was sorry that she had spoken; he
had so much to do apart from women; his spirit was clogged with a
dead weight of melancholy; she had lost her hazard.</p>

<p>At the corner of Fishamble Street a gentleman, with whom he had
some slight acquaintance, one Captain Brian Maguire, addressed him
impulsively, asking "if he might have a commission in his
newly-raised troop of horse?"</p>

<p>Sarsfield startled himself out of his reflections to answer
civilly:</p>

<p>"I thought you were under my Lord Galmoy's command?"</p>

<p>"You have not heard why I left it?" asked the other, and
appeared surprised. He was a stout young gentleman with a candid
face.</p>

<p>"No, I have heard nothing," replied Sarsfield. "I have been but
a few weeks in Ireland, as you know."</p>

<p>Maguire then told him, standing at the street corner and
speaking in a loud voice for all the passers-by to hear, the
occasion of his resigning his commission under Lord Galmoy.</p>

<p>He, Brian Maguire, had been captured by the Protestant rebels at
Crom, and Lord Galmoy had offered to exchange a certain Captain
Dixie for him.</p>

<p>This proposal had been accepted and Maguire in due form
released. But when the Jacobites came to Belturbet, where my Lord
Galmoy, lately defeated by Hamilton, had his headquarters, the
Jacobite general had refused to give up the Protestant prisoner
unless he forswore his heresy and followed King James. Captain
Dixie, in vigorous and peremptory terms, had haughtily refused and,
with a fellow-prisoner, was ruthlessly hanged from a signpost in
Belturbet, exposed to the mocks and jeers of the Jacobite
soldiers.</p>

<p>"I could no longer serve under such a man. It was impolitic as
well as infamous, for it hath made a great stir in Ireland and has
put poison into all the quarrels, and many of the rebels have vowed
neither to give nor receive quarter from a Jacobite, reminding each
other of my Lord Galmoy's broken word."</p>

<p>Sarsfield sickened. He had heard of too many of these
treacherous and hasty deeds. He was revolted by these traits of
baseness and cruelty in his countrymen; a queer secret pride
reminded him that Piers Butler, Lord Galmoy, was not native Irish
but English of the Pale...but so he was himself on his father's
side...he was defeated by his vanity.</p>

<p>Captain Maguire strode beside him towards the castle in the
crowd of foreigners, contractors, hucksters, traders, loose women,
moneylenders, priests, who swarmed in Dublin.</p>

<p>"What is to come out of all this welter, Colonel Sarsfield?"</p>

<p>Troubled, Sarsfield replied:</p>

<p>"I do not know, I cannot see a pace ahead. If the English send
an army we may fight, I suppose."</p>

<p>"If the French don't send more supplies," said Maguire, "we may
starve, I suppose."</p>

<p>As they entered the grim precincts of the old castle they heard
the babbled news (which had speedily gone abroad) that the young
Duke of Berwick and his newly-raised troop of horse had been
repulsed from the walls of Derry, the stoutest and most bitter of
the rebel towns and one which King James had vowed to take.</p>

<p>Despite Tyrconnel's boast, half the island was in the hands of
the Protestants. Every one remarked on the fallen mien and
confusion of the king, who seemed confounded. From the day when,
entering Dublin, he had been met at the castle gates by four of his
bishops bearing the Host and had fallen on his knees in the mud to
receive the blessing from the primate, the viceroy's brother, he
had done nothing either to endear himself to these subjects who had
embraced his cause or to forward his own advantages. His privy
council, his parliament, his proclamations, had had but little
effect; the country wanted good government, men and money; and
already the differences between the Scotch and Irish followers of
the king and the wishes of Louis XIV. (who paid the piper and
expected to call the tune) showed in an ominous series of clashes.
Tyrconnel and the French faction, Melfort and the English faction
tried to draw the king along a different road. D'Avaux doled out
the French gold with increasing reluctance; his expression became
inscrutable, his dispatches to his master very long.</p>

<p>Sarsfield felt heavy-hearted and was relieved to see Henry
Luttrell, the Governor of Sligo, among the crowd cursing and
arguing in the shabby antechamber. Luttrell's fine face wore an
expression of amusement; he left the press to take Sarsfield by the
arm and whisper to him that he had much to relate; Sarsfield always
felt comforted by the presence of this man; there was a steadiness
beneath his lightness, a good fellowship beneath his mockery that
revealed a strong and settled character.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-8" id="ch1-8"></a>EIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">
"WHAT do you see amidst these manifold confusions?" asked
Sarsfield.</p>

<p>He was not himself interested in politics, nor keen in any court
or bedchamber intrigues, and he relied considerably on Henry
Luttrell&mdash;a man who always seemed to have the most intricate
affairs of the moment at his fingers' ends and to be able to give a
good and clear account of them.</p>

<p>Colonel Luttrell smiled and seemed to be amused by the trouble
and heaviness of his companion as he explained that he had come
from Sligo, where there was nothing to do, to be at the heart of
events in Dublin Castle. He had contrived, as he had a way of
contriving, to be in any place where he wished to be, to be present
at the last privy council held by the king.</p>

<p>Briefly and shrewdly he related to Sarsfield what he had heard
there and his own conclusions. The king, it seemed, was still
reluctant to wholly trust the Irish, he relied sooner on the
French. D'Aaux and Louis, his master, had perceived, Henry Luttrell
thought, that it would be hopeless to endeavour to oust William of
Orange from the English throne, but they did believe it might be
possible to establish James permanently in Ireland, to expel from
that island the puritan colonists, restore the roman catholics and
establish their Church there.</p>

<p>"King Louis," said Luttrell with his indulgent smile, "counts on
the Irishmen to fight his battles, on our harbours to shelter his
troops, and all of us to be a thorn in the side of England. D'Avaux
went so far as to say the best thing King James could do would be
to forget that he had ever reigned in Great Britain and think only
of establishing himself in Ireland.</p>

<p>"And did the king agree?"</p>

<p>"The king, as always, hesitated. Melfort, the English and the
Scotch are for the other side. They would have him wait till Derry
falls&mdash;and they believed it would fall immediately&mdash;and then sail
for Scotland. That is the king's own wish. He detests us, my dear
Sarsfield, as much as we are doubtful of him.</p>

<p>"He will never be popular in Ireland," said Sarsfield.</p>

<p>The wild enthusiasm with which the exiled Stewart had been
received at Kinsale had indeed sharply waned. There had been
several ugly incidents showing alike the king's bigotry, imprudence
and want of tact. By his behaviour he had alienated the
Protestants, some of whom might have been induced to join him from
motives of loyalty to his House. He had repelled harshly and even
brutally the advances of the populace, having the crowd cleared
from his doors by the soldiery; a recruit who had dropped a carbine
through clumsiness had been shot because the weapon had exploded;
both in public and in private the king had been heard to make
sneering remarks about the Irish; Tyrconnel backed him, looking
beyond James and despairing of any restoration in England he relied
entirely on the court of Versailles.</p>

<p>"These intrigues," said Sarsfield, "make my head and my heart
ache. What will be the upshot?"</p>

<p>Colonel Luttrell said that he thought the king would go north
and join the Jacobite army which was endeavouring to quell the
colonists who had shown such a surprisingly strong resistance. In
spite of Berwick's repulse at the walls of Derry they believed that
town might fall, and once they had Derry and Inniskillen they might
count on having the whole of Ireland.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," said Sarsfield, "we sit about and talk. Why does no
one do anything? I have raised my troop of horse, maintained and
paid them at my own expense, but no use is made of them."</p>

<p>Pacing about he told Luttrell of the information he had gathered
from stragglers and fugitives as to the state of the country. There
were hundreds of wild rapparees abroad, burning and slaying,
killing the cattle for the mere sake of the tallow and fat; crops
were unsown, fields uncultivated, rivers defiled&mdash;all a chaos;
private feuds and hates being satisfied regardless of the public
interest or the king's cause.</p>

<p>Then he mentioned the contempt of De Rosen and his officers that
he, as a trained soldier, was bound to share for the Irish they
were endeavouring to recruit. "Uncouth, stubborn and conceited, the
Irish must be governed with rigour and severity and were not to be
wrought upon with lenity and gentleness; they respected no officer
except he who beat them daily without mercy and followed none but
their own particular leaders to the utter ruin of the army."</p>

<p>Colonel Luttrell smiled, with his fingers in the nut-brown curls
on his breast.</p>

<p>"The officers know no more than the men and understand nothing
of how to exercise or train them. How should they?&mdash;for there is
scarce a gentleman among them. They are sons of bakers and even of
cowherds."</p>

<p>"Some of them have been sent to the north," said Sarsfield, "who
have never seen service. As for arms, they have been taught the
little they know with sticks; when they come to handle pike or
musket they are to begin again. One cannot blame De Rosen for
saying that he can do nothing with officers who are from the
plough, from digging potatoes, and from such like exercise, or who
have been put into commission because they have a few men to follow
them and bear the name of a good family, and who are," added
Sarsfield with gloomy heat, "without experience, without conduct,
without authority, without even a sense of honour."</p>

<p>Luttrell agreed that the only troops worth considering in the
event of an army being sent from England were the troops of horse
raised by private noblemen and which consisted of eight regiments,
each having about two hundred and fifty men.</p>

<p>Luttrell also commented, and with his usual light irony, on the
misery of the assistance rendered by France.</p>

<p>For months they had talked of supplies from France as they might
have talked of Golconda or El Dorado, as if that country not only
possessed all the gold of the Indies, but was willing to send it to
Ireland. It had been cheerfully discussed as to how many millions
must be poured into the west by the generous hands of King Louis;
but ever since the landing at Kinsale, D'Avaux had been doling out
pence with a more and more reluctant hand. He now stated that he
had nearly exhausted the gold he had brought with him from France
and had, so far, received no promise of any more. The officers' pay
was long in arrears; the men were paid by the gentlemen who had
raised them or not at all; poverty began to show bleakly even in
the royal household; the food was coarse and poor; appointments had
become tarnished and ragged, service unwilling and sullen. Even the
spirited Lady Tyrconnel and her gay daughters were no longer able
to lend an air of elegance and gaiety to the gloomy chambers of
Dublin Castle.</p>

<p>"Yet, withal that affairs are so bad with us," said Sarsfield
stubbornly, "it will cost the English something to dislodge us, and
dislodge us they must; for, without the subjugation of Ireland,
England cannot flourish and perhaps not subsist, for if England
does not hold our harbours where is her famous and boasted
trade?"</p>

<p>"We are here and we shall stay," replied Luttrell. "You do not
yet know your own power."</p>

<p>This sudden personal note startled Sarsfield.</p>

<p>"How do I come into this?" he asked, surprised, and added with
some bitterness, "I am no more than the least of those who follow
King James. I am only spoken fair because I could raise two hundred
and fifty men and pay them. They have given me the rank of
brigadier but I have no power."</p>

<p>"You have if you wish," urged Luttrell swiftly. "The Irish love
you and would follow you. You are the only one among them who
thinks of the people as the people and who puts in no claim for
himself&mdash;of the ancient blood, too, not gay, brisk, modish, but
grave such as carries weight."</p>

<p>Sarsfield could not follow the trend of this; he had never quite
understood Luttrell, but the man fascinated him.</p>

<p>"There's a party for France, Colonel Sarsfield, a party for
England and a party for Scotland, and those who think of nothing
but restoring the House of Stewart at any cost. Why not a party for
Ireland?"</p>

<p>Rising, he added rapidly: "Trust none of them; neither D'Avaux,
nor De Rosen, who is, after all, only a blustering wooden soldier;
nor Tyrconnel, nor the old worn-out king himself. Make your count
and your party where you may and rely on me."</p>

<p>"Do you think I am willing or wishful to join in these
intrigues? I am a plain soldier&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tis unfortunate," interrupted Luttrell drily. "Had you some
head for politics you might best all these wrangling
foreigners."</p>

<p>It was plain that he would have said more but the two were
interrupted by a messenger who came to summon Sarsfield to
D'Avaux's closet.</p>

<p>The Frenchman, who had behaved to him with uniform but official
kindness since the conversation he had had with him on the
man-of-war in the harbour of Kinsale, greeted him now with a
friendliness which seemed full of goodwill and candour. With that
simplicity so effectively employed by many wily and veteran
diplomats, D'Avaux put before him his views and plans.</p>

<p>"Whatever you hear, Colonel Sarsfield, do not believe that King
Louis still hopes to put King James on the throne of Great Britain.
It is manifest that the Prince of Orange is very firmly established
there and not a man to be lightly dislodged. But King Louis does
intend to maintain King James in Ireland. Forget everything else,
Colonel Sarsfield."</p>

<p>"But why have you told this to me, monseigneur?"</p>

<p>"Because it will only be by the aid of men like you that King
James can be maintained in this country. I spoke to you frankly
before; I need your enthusiasm, your patriotism. King Louis will
know how to reward your services."</p>

<p>Sarsfield did not attempt to refrain from answering:</p>

<p>"I serve the King of England, not the King of France. I would
not touch French money or French rewards."</p>

<p>"Without King Louis," smiled D'Avaux, "King James is nothing.
There is no need to press that point with you, you are a man of
sense. I have work for you," he said with a smile of engaging
encouragement. "I intend to send you with your guards and some
others, say a body of five hundred, to Lough Erne in
Fermanagh."</p>

<p>He indicated a place on the map which lay under his hand.</p>

<p>"There you may try your mettle, face to face with these invaders
and usurpers whom you, Colonel Sarsfield, regard with such
warrantable detestation. A chance," he added shrewdly, "to make
your name sparkle, to attract the attention of those whose
attention it is worth while to attract. You will receive your
formal orders from De Rosen or Tyrconnel, but I tell you this early
and in confidence that you may have good time for preparations.
Which preparations, I believe," he added, smiling more deeply,
"include a marriage."</p>

<p>"Yes, monseigneur, I would be married before I leave Dublin. It
will be hurried, but in time of war that may be overlooked."</p>

<p>Comte d'Avaux held out his hand; Sarsfield noticed that it shook
a little; the diplomat was not the man he had been when he stood on
the warship and looked for the first time at the coast of Ireland.
He was worn, weakened, even on the verge of nervous illness;
dealing with King James, with Tyrconnel, with Melfort, had shaken
even his humble constancy and quiet patience.</p>

<p>"Be careful of Henry Luttrell," he advised. "He is a sly,
cautious, working man; of a great charm, I admit, and a curious
fascination. But I would not be of his advice, by his means
fortunes might be cast away."</p>

<p>The Frenchman rose with a gracious gesture of dismissal, as if
he would have no comment on this statement, which had astonished
Sarsfield, who had always regarded Henry Luttrell as an upright
gentleman not likely to be miscalled by any; yet he respected
D'Avaux's observation and judgment.</p>

<p>Sarsfield was exhilarated at the prospect of action; he left the
presence of D'Avaux elated with the thought of leading his troop to
Fermanagh, but at the same time he was something confounded by the
thought of the sudden marriage that this would mean. His relations
with Honor de Burgh had been so formal. The girl, on a closer
acquaintance, had seemed slight, childish, trivial. He believed
that he wronged her in making her his wife while he felt for her no
more than a kindly indifference. But her brother and her other
relatives were expecting of him the fulfilment of his bond. They
would certainly consider that he must assure her future before he
went into the campaign. And there was Olivia de Bonnac; his heart
warmed at the thought of her but his spirit sank. Must he say
farewell to this woman who had twice told him she was not of those
who are left behind? would he mortify her by a silent
departure?</p>

<p>And there was that other, blithe as a wood-thrush in June, who
had already shared with him a leave-taking and gone serenely to her
dreams; and he grew weary of these buffetings of chance, he felt
hoodwinked by events, unable to get so much as a glimpse of a
definite truth.</p>

<p>He passed with indifference through the busy passageways of the
castle and was startled through his reverie by a voice saying:</p>

<p>"'Tis with great reluctance, Colonel Sarsfield, that I broach to
you a nice subject."</p>

<p>The Duke of Berwick stood at his elbow; Sarsfield paused with
quick courtesy and invited the young man into a little disused
cabinet of pictures collected by former viceroys; he stood civilly
waiting, his back to the light from the corridor (there was no
window), and so disinterested that he was considering an Italian
landscape with ice-blue mountains and daisied foreground. He
believed Berwick, who appeared absorbed in his profession, wished
to speak to him on some military matter.</p>

<p>But as the young duke remained rigid and motionless Sarsfield
glanced at him keenly; despite his recent sharp defeat in the brush
with the rebel colonists the youth retained his usual composure;
Sarsfield reflected that, being a landless and a nameless man,
James Fitz James had had little to lose through the misfortunes of
his royal father, that in any case his life would have had to be
one of pure adventure; he would never have much that he would not
be able to gain for himself.</p>

<p>Berwick stood in an erect, precise attitude; he looked older
than his twenty years; his long, smooth face had the Stewart
outlines and the Churchill beauty; he was very graceful, his eyes
large, dusky, thoughtful, his abundant hair of the Stewart auburn
and richly curled, his handsome scarlet and gold gallooned uniform
was very nicely kept; he made an admirable figure. As he continued
silent, in what seemed an austere musing, Sarsfield asked with a
smile:</p>

<p>"Well, my lord, what did you wish with me?"</p>

<p>Berwick gave him a sharp and strange look, then said:</p>

<p>"Nothing, after all. Silence is best, sir," and turned on his
heel and walked rapidly away without a backward look, his hand
grasped tightly on the hilt of his Parisian sword.</p>

<p>Sarsfield was impressed that whatever the young duke had had on
his mind to say had not been of a trivial nature, and he was
puzzled. He had never had any intimacy with Berwick; he thought
that they would never have either vice or virtue in common. He was
not jealous of the king's bastard; he even felt his own unblemished
descent superior to this tainted royalty, and he had been stung
when his brother had married Monmouth's sister; but he did not
think he would ever like Berwick, so cool, so sure of himself, so
little concerned in those matters over which Sarsfield's heart
ached...</p>

<p>"What could he have meant to say to me? But if he does not
intend to speak I shall never loosen his resolve."</p>

<p>The shadows gathered round the work of dead men in the little
closet; Sarsfield wearied at his own reluctance to face the
relentless demands of everyday.</p>

<p>"I have no patience thus to beat the air to no purpose&mdash;I must
put aside this musing."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-9" id="ch1-9"></a>NINE</h2>

<p class="first">
WHEN Sarsfield approached the Lady Honor de Burgh he felt
awkward, uneasy and almost guilty. She had rooms in the castle and
the kindness of Lady Tyrconnel had secured her the name of
lady-in-waiting on herself, but the title, like all titles of this
mock court, meant nothing. This convent-bred girl, clad in
mignonette-coloured silk, faded and unadorned, sat at her
harpsichord in one of the large gloomy chambers of the citadel; she
sang in an idle, casual voice a song from a book in front of her,
the meaning of which Sarsfield was sure she did not understand:</p>

<br>

<p class="poem">"Brightness falls from the air;<br>
Queens have died young and fair;<br>
Dust fills Helen's eyes;<br>
I am sick, I must die.<br>
<br>
&mdash;'Miserere Domini!'"</p>

<br>

<p>She stood up dutifully when he entered and his heart went out to
her in pity, remorse and tenderness. He tried to snatch at memories
of formal marriages between strangers which had ended in mutual
love and comfort, and he hoped fervently that so it might be with
him and Honor de Burgh.</p>

<p>He told her that he was ordered to Fermanagh and asked her with
kind humbleness if she would have him before he went. There were
many of her and of his relations in the castle in Dublin, and they
might be wed with some ceremony in the chapel...he thought his
words sounded dry as autumn leaves.</p>

<p>She replied meekly that she "supposed it was all arranged, that
her brother had seen to the affair, as for herself, why, she was
willing enough."</p>

<p>Sarsfield explained to her that the reason for this hasty
wedding was that she might find herself, in case of any mishap,
mistress of Lucan and his fortune.</p>

<p>Honor put in quickly:</p>

<p>"But it seems, sir, that you spend all that on your troops, that
there will be little enough left for your poor wife or widow."</p>

<p>She smiled prettily, that he might take her words for
childishness, yet it seemed to him a strange thing for her to have
said, and he remembered Olivia de Bonnac's large and generous scorn
of her as a sly, artful girl.</p>

<p>He assured her that she should be provided for and that, bar his
total ruin, which could only come if the Roman Catholic cause and
that of King James were completely lost, she was safe enough, and
that in a waste of woe and the desolation of war in which few were
secure.</p>

<p>He asked if she would go to Lucan or if he should hire a house
for her in Dublin, in Fishamble Street or Skinner's Row, or if she
would remain near her brother and her relatives in the castle?</p>

<p>"'Tis the same to me," replied the Lady Honor. "Everywhere I
feel homeless. When is the war coming to an end?" she asked in a
kind of sharp simplicity, and turned on him clear, questioning blue
eyes.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew, my dear, one must not expect to get one religion
and king out, and another in, in a week or so."</p>

<p>"Will the Protestants and colonists return to Scotland or
England," she asked, "now they see that they are dispossessed, that
their cause is hopeless?"</p>

<p>"They do not believe it is hopeless," replied Sarsfield. "There
is no doubt they will fight, and one cannot but applaud 'em for it.
You cannot, my dear," he added sadly, "cast down the mighty and
exalt the humble without much confusion. It is a dull and tedious
time for the women," he added, with tenderness for her slight,
childish figure in the pale, faded silk, for her wistful resigned
face.</p>

<p>"Or else too gay," said Honor de Burgh.</p>

<p>And again he was faintly startled at her shrewd and worldly
air.</p>

<p>"What do you know of such gaiety," he smiled, "who have not been
above six months from a convent?"</p>

<p>Honor replied:</p>

<p>"Lady Tyrconnel and her daughters are lively and splendid
enough, they contrive to find diversions even when mewed up in the
castle."</p>

<p>"Why, so shall you if you will." And all his anxiety to please
and win her glowed in his words.</p>

<p>She gazed into his handsome face keenly, but not with candour.
She was small, finely formed, her soft hair was of a soft brown
colour and hung heavily on her shoulders; her features were
precise; but she seemed too reserved for her age. As he considered
her he knew that never would he have chosen this woman; he could
not now get back to or understand the mood which had allowed him to
drift into an acceptance of her brother's proposals, and even here
he half recoiled from the final step and wondered if, however deep
his honour and his dignity were engaged, it would not be more
honest to release Honor from her formal promise. Their indifference
to each other was too manifest.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of?" she asked, noting his abstraction,
and she added: "Of Madane de Bonnac, perhaps?" Her tone was
curious, free from all jealousy. He was contemptuous of himself for
supposing that she would not have heard his name coupled with that
of Olivia.</p>

<p>"You are much, sir, in her company?" added Honor with her
probing air. "For myself, I do not like her; she will never be a
friend of mine."</p>

<p>"There is no need that she should be, dear heart&mdash;I shall do all
in my power to oblige you, in this and everything else. I wish to
be your servant in all&mdash;you shall find my heart immovable against
allurements from your service."</p>

<p>"So," said Honor, with her odd little air of quiet assurance,
"you would make a faithful husband, but it is certain that you have
been a laggard lover."</p>

<p>He learnt from that, that she was displeased with her marriage
and that she had gossiped about him with her friends, as he might
have expected, and he said to her immediately and with a remorseful
sincerity:</p>

<p>"Honor, I have been no lover to you at all, this has been but a
formal and easily fixed affair, though in the estate in which we
are, many marriages have no more pretence than conveniency in them.
If your heart is elsewhere or you would be free of me, why, say so,
and I will contrive all for your peace of mind and dignity."</p>

<p>"You cannot hope," she replied, with a slow smile, "that I
should have any great tenderness for you, Colonel Sarsfield. You
are to me a stranger, and you have never wooed me; though, without
effort, you have won me."</p>

<p>"Yet," he replied earnestly, "I do not enter into this marriage
lightly. I intend that there shall be affection and even love
between us, companionship and comfort. And as we are of one faith
and one nationality, bound in one effort and one misfortune, that
should not be so difficult, Honor."</p>

<p>She faltered a little beneath this earnestness touched with
passion, and he urged further, clasping both her small hands:
"Could you not trust me and help me, Honor, in this proud yet
dreadful moment for Ireland? Amid all this turmoil and confusion
could we not stand together?"</p>

<p>He broke off and pressed her fingers convulsively.</p>

<p>"Believe me, I could easily love you, Honor." He spoke
sincerely; he believed at that moment that he could easily love any
woman who asked of him protection, who gave him affection; his life
had been so long barren, filled merely with the music of dreams
lulling a monotonous routine.</p>

<p>As she did not answer but hung her head, he released her hands
and said:</p>

<p>"If you would be free, tell me so, I conjure you, Honor." And as
she still did not reply&mdash;"There's no other holds your fancy or
affection?"</p>

<p>At that she looked up, and smiling, said: "No, and 'tis my wish
that this marriage should take place."</p>

<p>"You speak truly, Honor, faithfully? Do not be frightened or
ashamed. Confide in me who am so much yout elder."</p>

<p>She smoothed the stiff folds of mignonette silk which rippled
from her waist.</p>

<p>"I do confide in you," she said, "and I will marry you and be
your good and faithful wife, and wait for your return, as other
ladies await their lords. Try to be satisfied with this." But she
spoke with too little emotion; either she was cold-hearted or was
concealing something from him and, since he could get no more from
her, he felt rebuffed, despondent.</p>

<p>After what she had said it was impossible for him to free
himself, even had he wished it, and he persuaded himself that he
did not wish it, and he was glad he was going to share his life
with this young, innocent, delicate girl, high-born, finely-bred,
of his own nationality and faith.</p>

<p>Now there were the estates and the money, the wife, the high
military command, work to do&mdash;the thought of all this inspired him
to snatch her to him and kiss her with sudden passion which brought
the colour to her smooth cheeks.</p>

<p>But she whispered no endearments and endured his caresses rather
than welcomed them. But he believed in her truth.</p>

<p>Believing her to be childish yet and not disliking her for that,
he spoke to her of certain jewels which had come to him with Lucan
that he would send to her; she seemed pleased at that and flushed,
and told him that she was indeed stripped of everything, her
brother having had to sell her mother's gems in Paris.</p>

<p>When he left her he felt fortified against the doubts and
confusions and distress; he was able to think, with serenity, of
Olivia de Bonnac.</p>

<p>It was better for her as for him that this woman should be put
between them, and he turned into the sombre chapel of the castle
where, for the first time since the reformation, Romish incense
darkened the air, and prayed with the full ardour of his simple and
manly faith.</p>

<p>He believed in God and in what the priests told him. He believed
in honour and in keeping the law of heaven and of earth.</p>

<p>But through his prayers came a thought, and behind his locked
hands he saw a face, and neither the thought nor the face should
have been in this holy place. He thought in a passion of weary
home-sickness of Irrelagh, the shimmer of the lake, the purple-gold
of the mountains, and all the drifting veils of rain, the high
battalions of airy clouds and the night-black yew, the wet marble
and the graves of the gray old kings, and his heart was like to
burst from his bosom with longing to be away from this alien city,
these alien people, all these complications and conventionalities
of everyday life, and to stand once more in the ruins or by the
lake edge, and smell the peat and the fern, and to know that Ishma
O'Donaghoe stood beside him, in her garment of saffron yellow,
saying: "It may be I pledged myself to you and if so and we are
united lovers we must meet again."...Dreams, wild and foolish
dreams and faery romances of his lost youth, matters to be put
aside.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield left the chapel with a heavy step; the even
serenity which he believed he had gained by his understanding with
Honor had largely left him.</p>

<p>He went aside into a neglected gallery where rolls of tapestry
and furniture, used only on festival occasions, were piled; but
there he could not be alone for Henry Luttrell had spied him
leaving the chapel and had followed him. At first Sarsfield was
irritated, then glad because of this man's company; difficult for
him to realise, impossible for him to explain the fascination Henry
Luttrell had for him; there was a comfort in his presence he had
not found in the chapel.</p>

<p>Pacing up and down in the long, dusty, disused gallery,
encumbered with the chairs covered with canvas, with arras on
wooden rollers, pictures turned to the wall, disturbed now and then
by the scamper of rats, the two soldiers talked of Ireland;
Sarsfield earnestly, sadly; Luttrell with his mocking
lightness.</p>

<p>Sarsfield mentioned with impatient contempt and horror the
episode Maguire had told him, and Luttrell laughed and said all
Ireland rang with the rank tale. He added that Galmoy had allowed
his soldiers to decapitate the two young men after they were hanged
and make footballs of their heads...Galmoy was that manner of
man.</p>

<p>"But worse has happened than that, I marvel that you wonder at
it. What can you expect of a country where such hate is let
loose?"</p>

<p>"But men like Galmoy ruin us," said Sarsfield. "It was an ugly
thing to send Mountjoy to Paris on a false errand and then have him
flung into the Bastille. The English cast that in our faces. We
have used too much treachery, Luttrell."</p>

<p>"See that you keep your own hands clean," mocked the other,
amiably. "We are fighting for our very existence. What do
<i>you</i> intend to do when you go north? You think you will find
warfare like you are used to in Flanders and Italy? The Protestants
are flying as fast into Ulster as if the devil was after 'em. You
will see the ditches filled with their household goods, and if you
do come across a mansion from which the colonists have not been
able to escape in time, why, you will find all the inhabitants
massacred from the oldest dame to the youngest babe."</p>

<p>"We are recruiting the scum of Ireland!"</p>

<p>"Not only that," said Luttrell smoothly. "The orders of De Rosen
and his generals say 'Massacre all the Protestants and the
colonists! If they will not leave the island that is the only way
to be rid of them. After all, they have had their choice. The king
has offered an amnesty to such as would lay down their arms and
acknowledge him, and the most prudent have done so or fled already.
Waste no pity on them, my dear Sarsfield. After all, it is what
they did in the days of Elizabeth and Cromwell. These people have
long memories. If they massacre the Protestants they only massacre
the descendants of those who slew their ancestors'."</p>

<p>Sarsfield, wearied before the truth of this, almost turned away
from his task and his duty, for he was a man of a mild and merciful
disposition, who could not in cold blood slaughter his worst
enemy.</p>

<p>Three days later Patrick Sarsfield and Honor de Burgh were
married before a gay company in the chapel of St. Patrick in Dublin
Castle. For a few hours all made shift to forget the war; a
creditable feast was provided, and the bride received rich presents
from the king, Tyrconnel, De Rosen, her own relatives and those of
her husband. She seemed in high spirits and Sarsfield was soothed
at the thought of future happiness, so much glow and excitement did
she display...</p>

<p>Yet, even as she knelt at the altar steps in her silver run
brocade she was eclipsed by Olivia de Bonnac who stood beneath a
cluster of white candles in silent radiance, the light on her
pearly satins, her pear-shaped diamonds, her brilliant hair, her
sparkling eyes opulent with triumph; for she knew that all must
mark the difference between her and the little bride.</p>

<p>Sarsfield did not look at Olivia; as he knelt at the altar with
Honor he had sworn, not only with his lips but in his soul,
fidelity to this young creature entrusted to him in circumstances
so piteous. His warm imagination and tender heart had almost
presuaded him that he was beginning to love her; he thought of her
as one with the task before him; behind the church violins was the
throb of war drums. On his wedding-night, when he went into the
chamber, he surprised her in a passion of tears; at his entrance
she started aside like a broken bow; she was weeping in an
abandonment of half-hysterical despair.</p>

<p>Amazed beyond prudence, dismayed, he questioned her. She refused
to answer, hid her face in terror against the great bed; Sarsfield
pulled her to her feet. She was his wife, he could suffer no
mystery. From her young bosom, from her hot moist hands, fell a
picture in little of the Duke of Berwick.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-10" id="ch1-10"></a>TEN</h2>

<p class="first">
IT was a noble apartment, arranged with some pomp, through the
impetuous kindness of the Duchess of Tyrconnel. Hangings, showing
in deep colours the Jovian loves, darkened the walls; the sumptuous
curtains of the high plumed bed cast coverlet and pillows, satin
embroidered, gold fringed, into heavy shade; all the tapers had
been quenched save two on the toilet table where the bride's jewels
and favours had been flung down before the round mirror which
reflected nothing but darkness.</p>

<p>Sarsfield stood by the bed pillar with the miniature of Berwick
dangling by a short ribbon from his fingers; he recalled stupidly
that the young Duke had been the only person of note not present at
the marriage; with his inscrutable, cold air he had ridden away
that morning to the camp at Ardee (he had said); Sarsfield stared
at the painted face that smiled haughtily from the ivory; he wished
to give his wife some leisure in which to compose herself; he
wished, too, for a pause in which to take up his own courage; he
felt overthrown.</p>

<p>He had come to her full of tenderness; he had been so glad to
escape, with his easy good humour, from the merrymaking and the
pleasant jesting of their friends, to this privacy where he might
(he thought) reassure and comfort the woman committed to his
charge; it was hateful to him to have thus outraged her privacy,
her secret; why had her simpering chamber woman, putting away the
bride robe in the closet, admitted him eagerly, saying: "My lady is
waiting"?</p>

<p>He moved away to the dishevelled toilet table and stared down at
some of his own jewels, no doubt cast aside with aversion...and she
had seemed so pleased to receive them...he could not leave her
without all was clear between them; he prayed that she might cease
weeping; this she soon contrived to do; her overthrow was the
painful overthrow of a woman whose intelligence usually mastered
her emotion. The humiliation of having betrayed herself and the
ignominy of this surprise by the stranger who was her husband
served to nerve her into calm. He could hear her struggling
desperately and sincerely to control her sobs, and respected her
courage.</p>

<p>But he wished bitterly she had not lied to him a few days before
when she had said that she was heart-free and willing for their
marriage to take place. All his hopes of creating some happiness
and peace out of this union were blasted. He blamed himself and
pitied her, and smarted under the behaviour of Berwick. When she
was silent, he turned at last, and said:</p>

<p>"My poor child, I am very sorry, you should have been candid
with me."</p>

<p>Honor was again cool, reserved, proud. He marvelled at so much
self-control in one so young and inexperienced; at her lack of
ardour, too, even her tears seemed passionless; she must be the
same age as Ishma, but how poor and pale in comparison; he could
not think that she had any sweet, joyous love to bring any man;
Ishma was brightly shining with life, straight and lustrous as a
lily on its stem...why must he think of Ishma? Honor was now his
care; she looked at him with eyes already dry though reddened; she
wore a silk shift under a loose bed-gown; he could see her slight
shoulders, her bare feet, her garters, a confusion of rose-yellow
ribbons on the bed step; he winced from this enforced intimacy;
never had she seemed more of a stranger to him; he felt deeply
punished for some obscure but unpardonable sin.</p>

<p>"I will now tell you everything," said Honor hoarsely.</p>

<p>"No, it is your secret," he replied, "and I am sure an
honourable one."</p>

<p>He spoke sincerely, and when she, still cold, stammered that the
original of the picture she had been cherishing had no more than
kissed her hand, he believed her, yet thought she should have been
too innocent to need to offer this assurance.</p>

<p>"But you should not have married me, Honor, if you think so well
of him. Why did you do it?"</p>

<p>They had been united by Holy Church in face of God and men; a
contract for ever, sacred, not to be broken without the last step
in sinning. He dreaded the years ahead.</p>

<p>Honor did not answer, and he could painfully guess her piteous
need for silence.</p>

<p>She had married him at the prudent urging of her brother, the
cautious advice of her relatives; it would not be likely that she
would easily find a man of her own rank with money and lands
willing to marry her in the midst of the stress and confusion of
war.</p>

<p>She was neither a beauty nor a wit, she was herself careful and
timid; maybe others knew her infatuation for Berwick, maybe that
was why Galway had proposed and urged on the marriage; Sarsfield
felt trapped and taken.</p>

<p>He blamed no one; his own life, his own marriage seemed as
difficult and as ill-omened as the sad affairs of his country. He
put his hand before his eyes, the light of the two candles beside
the dark surfaced mirror made them ache, and said:</p>

<p>"Honor, you were too young to know that you should not have
married me&mdash;I am much troubled by the lateness of this
knowledge."</p>

<p>She had wiped away the tear-stains from her childish face.</p>

<p>"We stand as equals," she said quietly. "You know that you
prefer Madame de Bonnac to any other woman, and had no thought at
all for me."</p>

<p>"Alas that you have listened to this idle vapouring, which it
was a breach of charity to bring to your ears!"</p>

<p>"People will talk, and I am not so young. Every one knows your
devotion to her, and she is very beautiful, or most think so."</p>

<p>"She is not your rival, there is capacity in the heart for many
secret loyalties&mdash;to dreams maybe&mdash;this of mine was no matter for
prying worldlings."</p>

<p>"You wished to marry her once."</p>

<p>"That was ten years ago&mdash;so you've heard that too!"</p>

<p>Sarsfield marvelled at the eager, curious spite which circulated
all these tales. Who had told Honor that he had once been the
persistent suitor of Olivia Joyce? And in this moment of distress,
confusion and humiliation, his mind and heart both turned back with
a glad leap of escape to the memory of Irrelagh and that woman
there of whom no one knew, whose name none could turn over their
tongue, who would be for ever hidden, secret in his heart.</p>

<p>"I have no confession to make," said Honor, keeping her voice
surprisingly steady. "But it is better I should tell you."</p>

<p>She glanced at the miniature, a skilful painting of the smooth,
dark face, which he had dropped on the coverlet beside her, and
added with a pride and a control he respected: "I cared for my lord
very greatly, and he allowed me to think he held me dear. We did
not see each other very often nor speak very much, but we appeared
absolutely to understand each other, when we were together
everything was different."</p>

<p>Sarsfield could believe that; knowing Berwick and knowing her he
could discern there was something akin in their natures; both were
hard, brilliant, inclined to be cold and austere, prudent,
thoughtful, proud...</p>

<p>"What was there between you&mdash;what was the difficulty?"</p>

<p>"He did not think enough of me to let me hamper his fortunes. He
said he was in no way to think of a wife, that he was dependent on
his father and King Louis, and that neither of them wished him to
wed so young, and I believe, too, there was a scheme afoot to unite
him to a French princess&mdash;" Honor's delicate face quivered, she
spoke with a piteous dryness. "And I thought to the very last he
would have intervened."</p>

<p>Sarsfield recalled the incident of a few days ago when Berwick
had met him in the gallery, stopped, and said he had to speak with
him, then mused awhile in silence, and turned on his heel; he had
then been struggling with his pride, prudence and self-interest, no
doubt; he had deliberately sacrificed his strong inclination,
perhaps his strong love, to ambition.</p>

<p>"He has nothing," whispered Honor, turning away her head, "he is
nameless and landless, a pretence of a prince! Let him go, I am
your wife now."</p>

<p>"You do well to remind me," said Sarsfield heavily, "we must
even make the best of this same marriage."</p>

<p>"It shall be no worse than others," she replied with that irony
that sat so painfully on her extreme youth. She took the miniature
from the bed, came towards him, and said quickly: "Take that back
to my Lord Berwick, say I sent it."</p>

<p>"If you wish."</p>

<p>Sarsfield himself thought it as well that Berwick should be
aware that Honor's husband knew of this thwarted romance.</p>

<p>As he put the case in his pocket he wondered how deep it went
with her; a girl's caprice, a woman's whim, or a deep, endless
passion? She had greatly wronged herself by this marriage, and he
had wronged her by taking her when he could give her no more than a
faint compassion. He could no longer create tenderness or affection
out of this compassion. He looked at her with an immense coldness
not to be overcome. He wondered what Berwick, so uncommonly gifted,
attractive, had seen in this haughty, chill creature; for even now
in her humiliation and distress she repulsed him, and he could not
bring himself to offer warm comfort.</p>

<p>"Will you go to Lucan?" he asked.</p>

<p>She seemed to shrink from that prospect, rather would she stay
in Dublin in the castle with her relatives and friends where there
was some attempt at diversion; she plucked at the bed curtains; she
was half-lost in shade.</p>

<p>"You need not fear for me," she said, catching at his thoughts
too shrewdly for his liking, "for my Lord Berwick is going
north."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry for your distress and your state. You can do
nothing now to help yourself but to break utterly with him, even in
your thought."</p>

<p>"You need not, sir, remind me of my plain duty."</p>

<p>"Each of us," said Sarsfield, "must become used to our duty. You
will see nothing of me for some weeks. Think of me kindly and as
your husband."</p>

<p>Honor sank on to the bed-step; she seemed exhausted and
overborne. With her strange worldly wisdom, which at once pierced
and alienated Sarsfield, she whispered:</p>

<p>"If you had loved me, if you could come to love me, you might
make me forget that other. As it is&mdash;" She broke off with a
hopeless gesture.</p>

<p>Sarsfield could force no tenderness, they might both have been
of stone for all the emotion, passion, or feeling there was between
them; he remembered what Madame de Bonnac had said of her&mdash;"artful,
sly;" he was resolved not to blame her, but he could not set her
high; she had put a cheat on herself, on him, which all his life he
must pay for; how much had they not both irrecoverably lost!</p>

<p>He thought: "I must not be defeated by this, it is many a man's
lot&mdash;time is already so far past that there is only half my life to
live at longest." And he dwelt with relief on the mischances of
war; he was eager not to leave her disconsolate, and stood,
hesitant as to what he should say of kindness and comfort...</p>

<p>Honor, drawn deeper into her curtained shade, regarded him
shyly; unobserved by him there was the same expression, half
regret, half vexation, in her eyes which ten years before had
darkened Olivia's gaze when she had looked at him across the
rain-swept window of the MacCarthys' mansion.</p>

<p>In his unconscious pain and dignity, his comeliness set off by
his formal splendour, carefully arrayed for his marriage, Patrick
Sarsfield would have been splendid in any woman's eyes; he had
pushed back the thick hair from his forehead and his beautiful lips
were pale and strained; he impetuously approached the slight,
watchful figure by the marriage bed, and she as impetuously drew
away.</p>

<p>"You must leave me. I'll not be touched."</p>

<p>She had her bed-gown to her throat, and her figure, held back
against the coverlet, was rigid and defiant; Sarsfield was heavily
rebuked by her misunderstanding.</p>

<p>"Think not," he said sternly, "I sought you for wilful desires
or amorous designs&mdash;such with me are lost or laid aside&mdash;I came but
to contrive&mdash;how we might come upon comfort, believing that was my
clear obligation to you&mdash;but all that is changed."</p>

<p>"You approached me."</p>

<p>"Ay, I still had it in my mind to offer some compassion, but
all, it seems, is turned to mischief and calamity."</p>

<p>Honor glanced at him, saw his proud distress, and snatched the
coverlet to her face, crouching away in shame. He left her in her
bereaved bridal-chamber and went to his closet; as he unbuckled his
sword, put off his sash and baldric, lovely as the sound and sight
of running water pure from the mountains through fragrant grasses
came the memory of Irrelagh; the gray alabaster ruins, the black
enchanted yew, and Ishma, serene and bright as a rainbow, who had
walked beside him above the graves.</p>

<p>"No sleep for me to-night, nor any certainty to reflect on&mdash;I
have this proud, wilful hurt child on my hands, and a parcel of
regrets to haunt me."</p>

<p>But his resolution to help his country was not shaken; that held
firm even through this acrid disillusion of his marriage; Ireland
was more to him than Honor de Burgh, than Madame de Bonnac, Ireland
was one with Ishma O'Donaghoe, his secret treasure.</p>

<p>He was to go to Bundoran on Lough Erne, to guard the outposts
against Ulster; there, in Fermanagh, with work to do, he could
think without distress of these poor women, so weak, impulsive and
frustrated; he opened the window in his closet; it looked over the
grim, massive bastions, faintly visible in the light of an
overclouded moon. Patrick Sarsfield felt the cool air blowing
across his face as he gazed at the gray-smoky outline of the
sleeping city. Again, in his weariness and disillusion, he felt the
need of a miracle to reconcile him with life, and, for the first
time, that deep longing, known sooner or later to all, for the
final release of death.</p>

<p>He remained long at the window, watching the scudding vapours
hasten across the moon that was shining over the darkness of the
yew at Irrelagh and on the hut of dark-green stone where Ishma was
sleeping on her pillow of fern, guarded by the dog with his collar
of fine plaited Irish gold. But he could come to no firm
conclusions about either the heavy matters or the thin gaudy toys
that made up his life.</p>

<p>Yet, though this hateful night brought torment instead of repose
to him, he was, with composed front, attendant early in the chapel
which was yet hung with the adornments for his marriage.</p>

<p>Colonel Henry Luttrell knelt beside him and followed him when
Mass was over; Sarsfield envied this man who seemed on such good
terms with his destiny, who was able to maintain the part of an
amused spectator of other's farces and tragedies without being ever
affected himself.</p>

<p>"The king is to go to Ardee," said Luttrell. "Melfort hath
over-persuaded him against D'Avaux, who would keep him in
Dublin."</p>

<p>"And Ardee is but a step on the way to Scotland?"</p>

<p>"Ay, the news from Dundee is good&mdash;Melfort hopes to beat the
Ulster rebels in one large battle, and then, laurelled, lead His
Majesty to Edinburgh&mdash;" Luttrell was smiling. "The court hums with
this, your marriage is already forgotten. Lord! the long faces of
the Irish&mdash;they believe the king will forsake them and they take
D'Avaux for their man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tis clear as noon," said Sarsfield. "We are to be sucked and
flung away like a squeezed orange&mdash;what does De Rosen say?"</p>

<p>"He is to try to reduce Derry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tis against all credibility that it should hold out against
French troops."</p>

<p>"So Melfort thinks; he waits daily for the news that both
Inniskillen and Derry have fallen."</p>

<p>"I admire the Protestants' stubborn courage," said
Sarsfield.</p>

<p>Luttrell laughed and gave his companion an ironic glance.</p>

<p>"These Protestants," continued Sarsfield, "whom one might have
taken to be cornered like rats, desperate and undone, are worthy of
much praise."</p>

<p>Luttrell carelessly agreed that "every one expressed their
astonishment at the foolhardy impudence of the colonists in
refusing the free pardon offered them by Tyrconnel on condition
that they laid down their arms."</p>

<p>He added that the Council of the North had had indeed the
insolence to tell the Duke of Tyrconnel that, he having broken all
such undertaking as he had lately made to the Protestants, they
"had no reason to expect a true performance of the offers made to
them, but could only suppose that they would be reduced to poverty
and slavery." They had reminded each other of the cases of Captain
Dixie and Lord Mountjoy and had warned each other that "as we value
our lives it is well not to put confidence in the Lord Tryconnel or
any of his promises, but, if we possibly can, to defend ourselves
to the utmost."</p>

<p>"They all make but a puppet of His Majesty," said Sarsfield. He
felt some pity for the fallen king who was turned this way and that
by the Irish, English and French...he asked, "where Berwick had
been sent yesterday? To Ardee?"</p>

<p>Luttrell replied, no, the young duke had but gone to visit a
depot in Dublin; Sarsfield understood that Berwick had purposely
left the castle and purposely given out that he had been ordered to
the northern headquarters; he recalled Madame de Bonnac's epithets,
"sly, artful"&mdash;perhaps these might be applied to Berwick as well as
to Honor; but he tried to think generously of both of them.</p>

<p>Luttrell seemed to understand his troubled silence; there were
few subtleties that Luttrell did not understand.</p>

<p>"I am to reinforce you at Sligo&mdash;perhaps we shall see a little
action, I feel my sword stick to its scabbard with rust, and I grow
stale myself," he said warmly, "with all this fiddle faddle of
politics."</p>

<p>The castle was full of activity; brisk, ordered movement among
the soldiers, some confusion and agitation among the civilians and
women, who were to be left, as they felt, defenceless; but the
general atmosphere was one of hopefulness; the French, Scotch and
English were sure that De Rosen would reduce Derry, that, once the
king took the field he could utterly defeat the rebels for whom no
help came from England; only the Irish were sullen, discontented,
believing themselves overlooked, forsaken, despised through this
desertion of their capital.</p>

<p>Sarsfield, under immediate orders to march (the council's
resolution had hastened the departure of all the troops) sought out
Berwick; though Luttrell advised him to "let be the wilful, haughty
youth."</p>

<p>"Why, you don't know for what reason I would see him," said
Sarsfield, smiling at Luttrell's vehemence.</p>

<p>"He is no friend to you, nor like to be, you want him on some
nice punctilio, and will get but dry courtesy for your pains."</p>

<p>But Sarsfield was resolved to see Berwick; it might well be that
one of them or both of them would never return to Dublin.</p>

<p>As he went up one of the gloomy, old-fashioned stairways, he saw
a group of ladies mournful in a doorway, all agitated, hesitant,
some half-weeping; this was, for them, the first sharp pinch of
war, this sudden separation from lovers, this quick leave-taking
from friends, this prospect of fear-filled waiting for news.</p>

<p>Among them was Honor; it was grotesque to Sarsfield to remember
she was his wife; last night's scene in the desolate bridal chamber
returned before his inner eye with the ugly livid hues of something
evil; he thought:</p>

<p>"Well, she will be glad of my sudden going."</p>

<p>But Honor stepped forward, she seemed to appeal to him to help
her disguise the desperate breach between them.</p>

<p>"Oh, these sudden hurries make the heart ache!" she cried.
"There is much I would have said."</p>

<p>She was hastily attired; her delicacy easily took a look of
illness; she appeared so young, so full of tears; Sarsfield
remembered that she would have to part from her brother as well as
Berwick and he was filled with kindly human compassion for her; he
took her hand so warmly that the other women moved aside, thinking
they intruded on a tender moment.</p>

<p>"I would forfeit much to have some comfort to give you," he said
sincerely.</p>

<p>"There is only God."</p>

<p>He did not think that these words sounded false or pretentious;
he could not account, even to himself, for the respect he had for
Honor.</p>

<p>"I'll not detain you," she added swiftly. "I wished to exchange
a decent civility. Pray consider me obedient. Write sometimes."
Withdrawing her hand, she whispered: "Return that futility to my
Lord Berwick&mdash;that lies much in my desire."</p>

<p>"I do go now about that business. It is difficult. I see him
after we leave Dublin. Farewell, God keep you safe and easy. You'll
not forget the name you now have?"</p>

<p>"I will not. Trust me. Farewell."</p>

<p>He discovered Berwick in company with Lord Galmoy, a man
singularly hateful to Sarsfield, doubly loathsome since the affair
of Captain Dixie which had set many an Irish gentleman against his
murderer; this man was of a brutal appearance, but coarsely
handsome, with fine manners; many extraordinary stories were told
of him, and none was to his honour; but his birth and influence
were high; he was courted and flattered and his insolence
flourished; he thought it sufficient to be Piers Butler without
straining after other virtues; and many others seemed to think so
too.</p>

<p>Upon Sarsfield's insistence to see Berwick privately, Galmoy who
had been merely casually boasting of his horses, left the cabinet,
but not in an agreeable fashion.</p>

<p>"You don't favour him, Colonel Sarsfield?" smiled Berwick. "You
were scarcely civil."</p>

<p>"Nor meant to be, my lord, such men taint our ranks&mdash;I hold him
foul. The rebels will never forgive what he did. It was plain
murder."</p>

<p>Berwick frowned; he was himself, albeit coldly, chivalrous.</p>

<p>"I know. But one cannot be too queasy. There are many men I must
use I would not sit down to table with."</p>

<p>"Use for what, sir?" asked Sarsfield curiously, for the landless
adventurer spoke like a king.</p>

<p>"Mine own ends. And now, your business? I have to march with De
Rosen to Derry&mdash;you, I think, to Bundoran."</p>

<p>"It is because we shall be separated, perhaps eternally," smiled
Sarsfield, "that I must intrude on you now."</p>

<p>He drew the miniature from the wide pocket of his uniform;
Berwick immediately observed it, and a faint flush crept under his
pure olive skin; but he remained master of himself, even retaining
that air of authority by which he contrived to efface his extreme
youth.</p>

<p>Sarsfield felt for him exactly the same manner of cold respect
that he felt for Honor; he held out the locket on the lilac
ribbon&mdash;piteously childish, pretty and forlorn.</p>

<p>"The Lady Honor asked me to put this into your hands. I think
there is little to be said."</p>

<p>Berwick took the case with superb self-assurance, showing
neither humiliation nor amazement.</p>

<p>"But you might have told me," added Sarsfield, sternly stung by
this calm, "how matters stood with you."</p>

<p>"My fortunes," replied Berwick coolly, "are in no fit state for
me to think of a wife. I have nothing but my sword and am a
penniless gentleman-at-arms."</p>

<p>"Yet you did allow yourself, my lord, some love passages&mdash;they
must be forgotten."</p>

<p>"Does she wish them forgotten?" asked Berwick. "Have you won her
so soon? You could afford a wife and I could not, and there's an
end of it."</p>

<p>"I have been wronged in the affair; you are very young, my lord,
to be so prudent and so far-seeing. I had liked you better had you
married her out of hand without so much thought of fortune, or for
the future in these days when none of us has stable destinies."</p>

<p>Berwick took no offence at this clear speaking. He replied
thoughtfully:</p>

<p>"I was minded to tell you the other day, but thought better of
it. We are as we are made and I am, as you say, prudent; I cannot
easily, with open eyes, commit a folly."</p>

<p>Sarsfield could get no more from him, nor did indeed wish to
hear any more; he admitted that this dryness was better than a
wordy romantical fit of passion.</p>

<p>That day, without seeing Madame de Bonnac, Colonel Sarsfield and
his troop of horse rode towards Lough Erne.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-11" id="ch1-11"></a>ELEVEN</h2>

<p class="first">
COLONEL SARSFIELD, with his brigade of five hundred horse, had
his headquarters at Bundoran, where Lough Erne widens into the Bay
of Donegal; he was supported by Colonel Luttrell and his troop who
occupied Sligo; the post was important but monotonous; despite
their vigilant patrolling the Jacobites could detect no sign of
activity in the Protestants.</p>

<p>The lovely waters of the lake, beautiful with many green
islands, remained undisturbed under the changing, melancholy skies
of spring; remote from all echoes of war, Sarsfield shook from his
mind the miasma of Dublin; he could not remain impervious to the
influence of the vistas of gray-green water, of the eternal hills,
horizon merging into horizon, that had seen war and peace come and
go. He found in the melancholy austerity of nature a charm to
soothe transient passions; for he was not one of those who see
their own moods reflected in the landscape; to him the beloved
country was immutable, indifferent beyond all human emotions, and
in this implacable calm he discovered consolation.</p>

<p>Henry Luttrell frequently visited him at Bundoran; this man,
whose usual demeanour was one of negligent grace and self-indulgent
ease, proved himself alert, resourceful, tireless. Sarsfield was
surprised by his energy and industry; he had trained his troops to
a nicety and was most diligent in visiting his outposts,
strengthening Sligo and looking to the equipment of his garrison;
it might then be claimed that he and Sarsfield had brought their
troops of horse to as fine a pitch of efficiency as any in the
French service. The expresses who came in from the main army had
nothing but sour news.</p>

<p>King James's army had advanced to Charlemont, to Strabane,
through foul weather, enduring every hardship, to actual privation
at the royal table; D'Avaux, a sick and shaken man, utterly out of
humour with this northern campaign, had returned to Dublin.</p>

<p>"Our sole trouble, sire," he wrote to his master, "is the
irresolution of the King of England, who so often changes his mind
and never decides on the best course. He busies himself with little
things with which he employs all his time and passes lightly over
the more essential matters."</p>

<p>This bad opinion of King James was shared by most of the native
Irish who, the farther he went north, distrusted him the more. All
expected soon to hear the news that he had cut through the
Protestants and sailed for Scotland. De Rosen could make no
impression on the walls of Derry and Inniskillen; his two generals,
De Pusignan and Maumont, had been slain in an attack on the
stubborn cities.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield, though himself on his father's side of the
Norman blood, had always felt a strong, racial dislike towards the
Protestant colonists, those dour, haughty, resolute men who bore
themselves always with the superiority of a dominant and conquering
people, who regarded the Pope as Antichrist, the native Irish as
dogs and slaves, but he did not underestimate the worth of these
people nor the inadequacy of the forces opposed to them.</p>

<p>General de Rosen himself had been heard to say that if the walls
of Derry had been of buckram instead of stone he could scarcely
have been expected to take the town, so ragged and miserable, wild,
undisciplined and unarmed were the Irish troops with which the
French officers contended. The besiegers and the besieged alike
lacked everything, but the iron spirit of resolute Puritanism
within the walls was the strongest factor in the struggle.</p>

<p>"They will never give in," said Sarsfield. "It is a shameful
thing to be held in check by a handful of rebels. Why was not I
sent to Derry? Berwick is a boy and Hamilton incompetent&mdash;I had
thought D'Avaux stood my friend."</p>

<p>He and Colonel Luttrell were riding along the shores of Lough
Erne between the outposts; rain was falling, but so lightly that it
scarcely disturbed the surface of the lake which gleamed into
silvery distances between the jutting, woody shores; the hues were
those dull, pale tints of the early year on a misty day; from a
nearby island rose the ruins of a church and the gray height of a
round pillar tower, broken at the summit.</p>

<p>Sarsfield shook off the drowsy influence of this scene which
made all violence seem grotesque, and added briskly:</p>

<p>"I had thought that D'Avaux had put me in a post of greater
activity."</p>

<p>Luttrell replied with his smooth irony:</p>

<p>"D'Avaux is not as powerful now that he has ceased to supply the
gold so freely." Then added with a sudden flare of passionate
impatience unlike his usual demeanour: "Why d'ye endure this,
Sarsfield? Why do you not make a party of your own, call all the
native Irish together, and see what we may do against all these
foreigners?"</p>

<p>Sarsfield took this as a jest, for Luttrell was a man of
whimsies. He put it aside without much regard, but Luttrell
insisted with a glowing earnestness:</p>

<p>"You have gotten into the country, you have an influence here,
you are the only native Irishman in any important rank who is in
the least liked or trusted by the people. Mountcashel, Galway,
Galmoy, Hamilton&mdash;all of them are men of no capacity or
ambition."</p>

<p>"What capacity and ambition do you think I have?" asked
Sarsfield.</p>

<p>Luttrell replied with his cool smile:</p>

<p>"I know what I would do in your place."</p>

<p>"Why do you not do it then in your own place?" asked Sarsfield,
looking curiously through the rain mist at his companion.</p>

<p>"You know me," said Luttrell, with a frankness that was oddly
distasteful to the other man; "I am not trusted or greatly liked. I
can intrigue but not command. I have no influence, my dear
Sarsfield, but I can provide all the qualities which you lack. I
can scheme and make a party for you and defeat the French and the
Scots, and the English in the council or the court if not in the
camp&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sarsfield checked what seemed to him arrant fantasy.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to fall into a rebellion and add to the
confusion?" he demanded; he looked across the lake towards the
tower and the island.</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed Luttrell, "if I were raising men and paying
them myself I'd listen to no master."</p>

<p>And he proceeded with clarity and decision to sketch out a plan
whereby Patrick Sarsfield might put forward a party as strong as
any in the distracted island.</p>

<p>It was clear from the way he talked that he had reasoned out his
scheme. He pointed out the difficulties, almost the impossibilities
which the French officers had to contend with in training and
commanding the Irish troops who refused all obedience to the
foreigner, and how this mutual dislike was fostered by the haughty
impatience of the French. He dwelt on the waning popularity of the
king who never had much hold on the hearts of the people. He
remarked on the huge quantities of rapparees, kerns, or
gallow-glasses as they were severally termed, a large body of
roving Irish who owned no master, but lived on what they found,
plundering, marauding and slaying to the desolation of all. He
pointed out that on the receipt of the first good news from
Scotland, or on the fall of Derry or Inniskillen, the king would at
once escape north and, failing that, at the first brush with the
enemy he would fly to France...he was a man discredited, broken, in
whom no one any longer believed...old Shamus, the Irish called him
with contempt, with terms not to be named.</p>

<p>"And Tyrconnel?" put in Sarsfield dryly.</p>

<p>"Are you so simple? Tryconnel will treat with the Prince of
Orange. I doubt not that he is a traitor already."</p>

<p>Sarsfield had not thought of that. A deeper shade of vexation
fell on his soul; he felt himself simple beside the other man, so
ready, so easy, so brilliant and cool.</p>

<p>"Tyrconnel blusters and raves," added Luttrell, "but I doubt not
he is already in treaty with the usurper. His wife is the
sister-in-law of the traitor, Marlborough. Do you not believe that
they have communicated one with the other? They do not think of
Ireland or the Roman Catholic faith but only of their own private
fortunes."</p>

<p>Sarsfield was silent. He considered Luttrell's scheme wild,
impracticable, fantastic; but it had a certain swift audacity that
tempted his own nature and even while he completely rejected it he
felt he showed a certain irresolution and timidity in doing so.
After all, if Ireland were ever to be free of the foreigner and
conqueror, was not this the moment? By what right was James Stewart
King of Ireland? By no greater right than was William of
Orange&mdash;only by the right of conquest...And might it not be
possible, in this time of tumult and stress, that all the natives,
now roused and partially armed and trained, could be led to
overcome alike English, French and Scots?</p>

<p>"Throw 'em all out," insinuated Luttrell, "as the French were
thrown out at the Sicilian Vespers."</p>

<p>He sat easy in the saddle with something mocking in his air as
usual, and his queer eyes in which the cast was pronounced, were
keen and eager in the shade of his great plumed hat.</p>

<p>Sarsfield looked at him; there was then something implacable
about him, despite his careless air.</p>

<p>"What's your count in this, Luttrell? Why don't you put this
scheme into practice yourself?"</p>

<p>"I'm not the man, I know what I can do and what I can't do. I
can stand behind you and rise on your shoulders&mdash;your adviser, your
devil, what you will&mdash;but I cannot do this by myself. Why, who
would follow me? You have but to lift your finger and you will get
thousands. Have you no imagination, Sarsfield? Cannot you see the
scene, when you would raise a native flag and proclaim Ireland for
the Irish at last?"</p>

<p>Sarsfield laughed. They were surely in the realm of pure
fantasy, and therefore, licensed by fantasy, his mind went back to
Irrelagh and his Irish princess dwelling beneath the arbutus shade
in the green-stone hut by the water-break, a symbol of
Ireland&mdash;fair, wronged, desolate and despised; the beauty of the
rain-gray landscape through which he rode was heavy on him like an
enchantment.</p>

<p>"The days of knight-errantry are past," he said, with an effort,
"and it is not for me to play the liberator."</p>

<p>Luttrell stared, frowning; his steady eyes showed disappointment
and some scorn. He said coolly:</p>

<p>"Why, I thought you pretended to some such part, I thought you
held life to be more than mere brutish pleasure or stiff dull
duties, that you were willing to make a push for a sparkle of
greatness."</p>

<p>"All this has a tang of rambling fancy," replied Sarsfield
sternly, and then he laughed. "Let us take that boat and row out to
the island."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Luttrell, reining up suddenly.</p>

<p>"It is good to have a little leisure, 'twill be but half an
hour."</p>

<p>Luttrell indulged this fantasy without comment; one of the men
idling on the shore took the two horses; the other agreed to row
the officers to the island; it was a holy place; people often went
there to fulfil a vow; the flat-bottomed boat was used for
funerals; from very far mourners brought their dead to rest in the
sacred ruins; often was the placid lake disturbed by the echoes of
the keeners and the bards; the peasant did not know why the wild,
lonely island should be so venerated, only that it was consecrated
ground.</p>

<p>"A gloomy spot," remarked Luttrell; but his easy cheerfulness
did not seem affected; Sarsfield thought that he was observing him,
obliquely but intently.</p>

<p>The stout young man, slowly rowing the cumbrous boat, told them,
with awe, of the great age of the ruins and the tower on the green
island; they had been built by the saints and the faeries,
creatures who seemed one in his mind, when Ireland was free; the
invisible people still dwelt there; "sometimes you could hear their
lamentations sighing in the ash trees."</p>

<p>They landed on the island; as the boat was drawn through the
shallows, the two officers ascended the slight incline on which the
ruins stood; beyond were several other islands, darkling in water
that a mournful gleam of sun had changed to sudden gold, beyond
these the cloud-wrapped hills that bounded the lake shut in the
horizon rich with hues of purple and azure. A boat with a single
sail proceeded slowly under the guidance of a gentle wind, there
was a scent, sweet and crude, from the wild plants blowing on the
rocks and silence save for the sound, so poignant to Sarsfield, of
the breeze stirring the budding gray foliage of the ash trees.</p>

<p>The pillar tower was already thickly grown about with weeds and
bushes; in and round the ruin were crosses and head-stones, some
green with moss, some fresh and stark.</p>

<p>"There are nothing here but graves," said Colonel Luttrell.</p>

<p>The dead lay close to the sacred ruins as if they clustered
there for refuge; the spot was full of the atmosphere of grief and
resignation; some of the stones were split from time and weather,
some of the crosses had sagged as if the strong ivy that entwined
them had dragged them down; the sunlight strengthened and threw
into relief the broken delicate traceries of the ruined church
window, then the light clouds, swift and low, eclipsed the radiance
and enveloped the whole island.</p>

<p>Colonel Luttrell looked about him with a decent curiosity; he
uncovered as they entered the roofless church.</p>

<p>"Does this place stir your lukewarm inclinations?" he asked; he
spoke without mockery, but Sarsfield was vexed to be so well read;
for it was true that in these Irish solitudes he found excitement,
beauty, splendour, dreams, ay, even when walking above Irish
graves, and standing here he might very well fancy himself in
Mucruss Abbey.</p>

<p>"Well," added Luttrell, leaning against one of the half-fallen
doors and folding his arms. "Pray to your Irish saints to help you
save Ireland."</p>

<p>"Talk sober sense," smiled Sarsfield. "Consider that I have no
money and that the Church and France are behind King James."</p>

<p>"I have gone over that with you, was not Ireland to be your
peculiar care? Will you risk nothing?"</p>

<p>"All&mdash;within honour."</p>

<p>"I see you quibble, like a playhouse fool," Luttrell spoke
gently like one confident from long experience; Sarsfield became
aware that he was beguiling, enticing, using all his power to
persuade and influence, as he stood there, seemingly at ease,
smiling, half-mocking, yet flashing out such keen earnest
purpose.</p>

<p>Sarsfield crossed the tender wet grass in the open chancel;
leaning against one of the walls was a rude stone coarsely cut with
the likeness of a coiled serpent.</p>

<p>"I wonder what we all mean," he said, staring at this ugly
carving.</p>

<p>With a defiant curl of his lip Luttrell replied:</p>

<p>"I know well enough my own meaning and have explained it."</p>

<p>As Sarsfield neither turned nor answered, the other added:</p>

<p>"Do you take me to be one caught up in hysterical fancies, bred
of sick charms? You know me for a man who thinks clearly, sees
straight. Neither did I speak obscurely."</p>

<p>"Nay, not obscurely."</p>

<p>"You feel so loyal to His Majesty, this old, mean, fallen
prince, in whom there is no sparkle of greatness?"</p>

<p>"I would avoid a miscarriage of affairs that would leave Ireland
without remedy."</p>

<p>"So would I." Luttrell's answer came quickly. "I have thought
on't more than you. But you keep my purpose dangling, do not
scruple to say that you will have none of my offer."</p>

<p>"An offer, Luttrell?"</p>

<p>"Ay, and one I might take to Mountcashel, Galmoy or Berwick,
should you put me off with fiddle-faddle catchwords."</p>

<p>Sarsfield turned so that his back was to the serpent on the
stone and looked at Luttrell who had not changed his careless
attitude; the mist had wavered and sunk, it floated in shreds
through the ruined aisles; Sarsfield felt his hands and face wet
from this vapour.</p>

<p>"Galmoy is a scoundrel, Mountcashel of moderate parts, Berwick a
youth," he answered sternly. "The folly of it! What do you think
you could do with such?"</p>

<p>"They are lively, ambitious," replied Luttrell, with a flash of
impatience that seemed to throw prudence to the winds. "Berwick I
take to be of great parts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But cautious, prudent, for his years oddly so, as well I
know."</p>

<p>"Ay, you'll know that," smiled Luttrell. "I've raked up an old
sore there, no doubt; I'll swear my young lord's prudence has set
your affairs askew."</p>

<p>"You guess too freely."</p>

<p>"You mean that I observe too sharply, the simpleton thou art to
think thyself secure from watching!&mdash;most of us have spoiled and
soiled something in our lives, eh? God will have His japes of
us."</p>

<p>"You will neither entice nor anger me," said Sarsfield. "I am a
poor hand at intrigue, nor do I fancy being any man's cat's-paw,
even thine, my dear Luttrell."</p>

<p>Luttrell replied in a voice that seemed warm with sincerity.</p>

<p>"You mistake me. Before God, you have me wrong! I, too, am
Irish; I detest these greedy, sucking foreigners; I choose the
perilous way, rather than follow 'em. D'ye think I find sport in
their sneers and insults? D'ye think that I dote on their doled-out
pay and preferments? I would use 'em and keep straight on mine own
path."</p>

<p>Sarsfield considered this bold statement; he was himself
absolutely fearless; of that courage which could feel the steel at
his breastbone and not wince; without effort he could affront any
danger; like most of his countrymen he was full of audacity,
resource, sharp devices, brilliant expedients; none of these
qualities had yet been used, for he had always been in an inferior
position under the orders of others. Therefore, Luttrell's plans,
at once reckless and skilfully laid, daring and prudently devised,
giving scope alike for skill and boldness, appealed to Patrick
Sarsfield; but he had been rigidly trained, carefully disciplined
in convention of honour and duty towards the English crown. And he
knew that, should he lend himself to Luttrell's essentially
reckless scheme, he would have for his support neither the coinage
of Caesar nor the blessing of God; he could not see where he was to
obtain a penny of money, and the Church would be behind the old
tradition of royalty, supporting the divine right of kings.</p>

<p>From the inner chapel (the hermit's cell as the peasants called
it) a stranger came briskly out and interrupted the talk of the two
officers; this was a rosy, pursy priest, full of cheerful goodwill
and vitality, shabby and humble in his attire.</p>

<p>He saluted the gentlemen and simply explained his presence on
the island; it had always been his habit to offer a prayer, once a
year, on the ancient altar in the sacred shrine; the peace of the
sanctuary had a mystical healing quality, even in time of war one
could here feel in touch with God.</p>

<p>"Ay, no doubt," smiled Luttrell, "in Ireland, God must be far to
seek these days."</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the priest earnestly. "He is everywhere&mdash;it
is only that being mortal our weakness is comforted by the place
where we may feel assured of His presence."</p>

<p>He did not ask their business in this lonely spot. He was a
tactful, experienced man who had been enabled (by the grace of God
as he was sure) to detach his soul from worldliness; as he came
slowly over the wet grass, holding his battered hat in his hand, he
looked keenly from one gentleman to another. Luttrell still lounged
in the broken arch, Sarsfield still stood with his back to the
great serpent in stone; the priest discerned that they were both
remarkable men; he saw Luttrell, whose attitude was easy to
indifference and whose expression was composed to gentle mockery,
as the more powerful force; quite clearly the priest could see that
this was a man obsessed by ambition, full of energy and violence,
held taut as a coiled spring, of a most dominating personality,
implacable, dangerous; as Luttrell turned on him his intense
crooked glance vivid beneath the heavy lids, the priest felt as if
some one had brutally thrust at his very soul. Terence O'Fahy had
come to know humanity very well; he was sure that there was force,
cruelty, vindictive malice and pride behind this well-bred
distinction. The priest then glanced at the other officer and felt,
as the Irish folk at Irrelagh had felt, that there was something
almost legendary about the grandeur of Patrick Sarsfield; the
simple in heart might so easily mistake him for some prince of the
Tuatha Danaan, or for one of the Fianna, or for Conall, the Red
Branch champion celebrated in the bardic tales; so the priest
thought, not knowing that Sarsfield was descended from this same
Conall Cearnach the Victorious of the famous race of Rury,
descended from Ir, the son of Milith, who gave his name to
Ireland.</p>

<p>Sarsfield, to the quick, clear observation of this man, seemed
above his fellows in spirit as in stature, to belong to another
age, almost to another world, to be lonely, out of tune with all
his company, to be filled by longings that came from an immense
distance.</p>

<p>Father O'Fahy had only heard of one man who could give that
impression.</p>

<p>"You are Colonel Patrick Sarsfield of Lucan?" he declared
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Ay, how strange you should guess it!"</p>

<p>They began to converse, standing by the serpent stone, Luttrell
silently observing both. Father O'Fahy came from the borders of
Fermanagh, he had seen much of the sudden tumult that had followed
King James's decree restoring the Catholics to their estates, this
meant the turning out of the Protestants who had in some cases
lived on these lands since the days of Essex.</p>

<p>"It is not easy to right an old wrong," said Sarsfield, "many of
the colonists must feel unjustly treated as well as ruined."</p>

<p>"Indeed it is so."</p>

<p>And the priest, cheerfully and modestly inspired by the (to him)
almost unearthly magnificence of the man to whom he spoke, pleased
Sarsfield with tales of how he had been the means of saving many
Protestants, protecting their property and finding them ways of
escape from the country. He also told of many instances where the
Roman Catholic gentlemen, far from retaliating on their neighbours
for the deep wrongs of many gene ations, had helped these in their
distress, and Sarsfield, quick to respond to all that had a touch
of splendour or heroism, liked the priest and his tales of the
chivalry which had gilded the Roman Catholic cause. There had been
no massacres to repeat those of 1641, but there might well have
been. It was true that many of the sturdy colonists had chosen to
stay and fight, but numbers of women and children had sailed from
Carrickfergus for England or Scotland, taking their fortunes with
them.</p>

<p>"We are well rid of 'em," put in Luttrell; "but I would they had
left their money and goods behind. I hold it a pernicious weakness
to have let those go. I hope you speak on hearsay information."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I was there myself doing what I could. Do not repine,
there will be ere this war is over enough of woe to glut all
malice."</p>

<p>The rain was closing over them again; they were isolated from
reality in the sweet pure mist through which the budding trees
shook their wet leaves above the gray ruins and the thick-set
graves; neither Sarsfield nor the priest noticed this mist, but
Luttrell discovered a sudden resolute impatience.</p>

<p>"We must return if the boatman can see the shore."</p>

<p>They left the roofless chancel; the vapour, perpetually rising
and falling, disclosed the foreshore, the funeral boat and the
peasant, huddled in his frieze, waiting with a sad patience.</p>

<p>They got into the boat; Sarsfield looked, to the priest,
uncommon tall through the vapour; his vermilion uniform, the
glitter of his bullion fringes and epaulettes, his bright, stiff,
slightly harsh hair, reddish-flaxen, so boldly curling on to his
shoulders, his fine features, clearly defined, his wide-open gray
eyes, and the carriage of his head, unconsciously proud like a
hawk, or a lion, all formed an heroic picture in the eyes of the
Irish priest.</p>

<p>He thought: "What will this man do for Ireland?"</p>

<p>Luttrell seemed to guess this unspoken question; he leaned
forward, put his gloved hand on the priest's arm and asked:</p>

<p>"What do you think of Colonel Sarsfield? I see you have a mind
above the craft whereby your cloth usually get their living&mdash;is
this not a man to help us now?"</p>

<p>"He is," nodded the priest.</p>

<p>"And yet," smiled Luttrell, "he puts me off with apologies,
evasions and sophisms."</p>

<p>"I do not," said Sarsfield. "I think you talk like a
pamphlet-monger or a flashy-head&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am willing," replied Luttrell, shaking the moisture out of
his wet plumes (for he held his hat on his knee), "to plunge my
hand into a hot crucible to get gold."</p>

<p>"Then," said the priest gravely, "you are willing to damn
yourself in a vain curiosity."</p>

<p>"'Tis probable," said Luttrell.</p>

<p>They landed; Luttrell fee'd the man, who blessed all three, the
priest returning gently:</p>

<p>"Let no loss discourage you, no menaces turn you from the right
way."</p>

<p>Father O'Fahy then took leave of them; he was journeying on foot
to Dublin, where his sister was one of the Clares in the new
convent King James had allowed to be established there; there was
work for him in the capital, but he preferred his toilsome mercies
on the Protestant borders.</p>

<p>Sarsfield asked him:&mdash;"if he was not already weary with so long
a trudge?"</p>

<p>The priest confessed, with a smile, that the soles of his feet
had soon become covered with blisters, but that a poor woman at
whose hut he had stopped had run clean wool thread through these
and given him great ease.</p>

<p>Sarsfield caught his reins from the waiting peasant.</p>

<p>"Father O'Fahy," he asked, "dost thou consider a man should obey
his conscience, albeit he comes at that dimly, or the precise
letter of the law?"</p>

<p>"To most, Colonel Sarsfield, I would make some bandying in my
reply to that&mdash;to many I would say, obey the law and question not.
To you I say, be your own warrant for your deeds, put all nicely to
your own conscience and abide the decision."</p>

<p>Sarsfield mounted without replying, but Luttrell smiled on the
priest.</p>

<p>"I bow to your good authority," he declared; "may my friend do
the same!"</p>

<p>"I said that Colonel Sarsfield's conscience, sir, was to be his
tribunal, not any advice of thine."</p>

<p>"Make not a clutter about that," said Luttrell.</p>

<p>The priest took leave of them; they watched his short, thick
figure, walking heavily, disappear into the rainy woods.</p>

<p>The two officers continued their ride along the sedgy borders of
the lake.</p>

<p>"That priest," said Luttrell, "has a prompt and active wit."</p>

<p>"A man of some holiness, I thought."</p>

<p>"That too, if thou wilt; now, I have allowed thee thy
meditation, what of my project?"</p>

<p>Sarsfield leaned forward and caressed his horse, the feel of the
warm, wet, firm flesh gave him pleasure, he loved the beast as he
loved the gray lake by which he rode, and the cool rain on his
face, and the wet trees overhead.</p>

<p>"How can you hesitate?" demanded Luttrell sternly, "seeing the
lamentable condition of blood and confusion this island is in? And
blind fortune throwing this way and that with none to direct her
gifts."</p>

<p>Sarsfield was not hesitant, but quiet, reflecting gravely.</p>

<p>"I'll think on't," he conceded. "If King James should fail us
wholly, if the French should grow too insolent&mdash;well, I'll think
on't."</p>

<p>And with that Colonel Henry Luttrell seemed well content.</p>

<p>That night, at the fall of the darkness, Patrick Sarsfield
lonely in the little house in Bundoran that served as his
headquarters, lit a small lamp and wrote a love letter.</p>

<p>He had seen silent women with the placid sheep on the banks of
Lough Erne who had reminded him of Ishma; grave, blithe, they were,
with sombre folded hair, and eyes the colour of mist or ashes, yet
vivid; and clothed in drug-get gown and saffron shirt, as he
thought on them he seemed wrapped in a flame of joy; the letter was
easy to write in the silence and solitude.</p>

<p>When he had finished it he went to the window and pulled back
the shutter; it was raining across a veiled moon; the lamplight
glittered on the slow, round water-drops, on the coarse pane of
thick glass.</p>

<p>The soldier returned to the table and tore up his letter, across
and across, into small pieces. Then he wrote another&mdash;gentle, full
of dutiful affection and the superscription was, "To the Lady Honor
Sarsfield, The Castle, Dublin."</p>

<p>Sarsfield, diligently patrolling Lough Erne, watched the coming
of summer; Luttrell, alert, vigilant, also waited on the news.</p>

<p>The campaign seemed to be ending in a series of skirmishes;
England sent no help to the colonists, nor France to the Irish; on
each side was a good deal of talk; on Lough Erne all was quiet, it
seemed the very heart of peace.</p>

<p>"Waste and parade for nothing!" exclaimed Luttrell. Derry and
Inniskillen continued, incredibly, to hold out.</p>

<p>Berwick was now at Newry, then marching and countermarching
between Inniskillen, Donegal and Trellick. He had had some
successes&mdash;burnt a magazine and the town of Donegal, brought off
oxen, sheep and horses&mdash;but none of this was of much importance.
Then came the news that Wolseley, the Williamite Colonel, had flung
himself out of Belturbet, and defeated Berwick's forces at
Tullaghmongan near Cavan. Sarsfield, sickening in his inactivity,
thought of the young Duke and of Honor, and wondered if they wrote
to one another. She expressed herself with more than dutiful
kindness, she begged his pardon for any errors or faults in the
past, she looked forward (she said) impatiently to his return, she
gave him news of Tyrconnel's court; the slow slipping by of the
days, the added pinch of war showing more keenly in everyday life,
the miseries caused by the brass money, the delay of supplies from
France, the ill-health of Mons. d'Avaux and the passionate temper
of Marshal de Rosen.</p>

<p>Sarsfield read all this without interest, he knew as much
before. At the end of the letter were a few sentences that suddenly
startled all his blood. Honor wrote:</p>

<p>"Three uncouth creatures have been at the castle asking for you.
They were brought to me and I could scarce understand their
language. They come from Cork County and are fugitives, it seems.
'Tis a priest, and an old and a young woman. They claim to have
known you once, but I think it scarce possible. They might be spies
for all I know, and I sent them to Mons. d'Avaux's secretary who
could make nothing of them, so I gave them a little money for
charity's sake and sent them off into the town. Pray tell me if you
have any knowledge of such creatures. The women spoke of having met
you at Irrelagh."</p>

<p>Sarsfield crushed up the letter and walked out of the streets of
Bundoran to the shores of Lough Erne. A full moon filled the
midsummer sky with light, a high wind was in the boughs of the
lonely groups of trees, the little town was sleeping, there was
silence round the standard of King James which hung above the house
where Sarsfield lodged; the moonlight made glittering sallies in
the dance of the ripples on the lake; the air was deep azure and
the hills enclosed by pearly vapour.</p>

<p>Sarsfield stared across the water which lapped at his feet; the
unseen flowers absorbed into the night gave out faint perfumes; it
was an hour to make the disembodied dead homesick for the
earth.</p>

<p>Ishma in flight, in peril, in distress had fled to him for
protection, and his wife had sent her away with "a little money for
charity's sake."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-12" id="ch1-12"></a>TWELVE</h2>

<p class="first">
SARSFIELD wrote to his wife, entreating her, with the candour of
a man who disdains a misunderstanding, to give especial courtesies
to the fugitives; he said he would inform her of his reasons (and
the whole tale) on his return. Honor replied, by the next express,
that she had lost sight of the refugees, but that she supposed the
nuns in Dublin would look after all such&mdash;she believed these
creatures had gone to the Convent of the Poor Clares. Sarsfield
applied for leave to return to Dublin; it was curtly refused, and
he felt the yellow sunshine of midsummer on him like a weight; he
sunk as if panting and struggling in the embrace of death.</p>

<p>"Surely," he said, "I am a fool to be thus bruised, for she is
nothing to me."</p>

<p>Once that summer the <i>Te Deum</i> rose from the gothic chapel
in Dublin Castle and the scented aisles of Christ Church, and that
was when the Count of Chateau-Renard, in spite of the opposition of
Admiral Herbert, landed stores and money at Bantry Bay, while the
English commander was compelled to withdraw to the Scilly Islands
for reinforcements.</p>

<p>But Marshal de Rosen retired in furious disgust from under the
impregnable walls of Derry. He declared that if he had had a dozen
battering pieces he would have made himself master of the town
within twelve days after the trenches had been opened; the
passionate, proficient, thwarted Livonian fell ill of chagrin and
mortification.</p>

<p>The Duke of Tryconnel had quarrelled with Berwick, who remained
in charge of a flying division employed to check the raids of the
men of Inniskillen. The young Duke had been defeated in several
skirmishes, had lost many of his soldiers and had numbers taken
prisoner; the viceroy accused him to his father's face of
incapacity and avarice. In this he was seconded by D'Avaux who did
not care for the king's son, he thought him an incapable officer, a
man too prudent and saving for his years.</p>

<p>Sarsfield pondered all these flying rumours which he received in
letters, advices and newspapers. The year was slipping away in
worse than inaction, for on every side were growing discords and
discontents, furies and hatreds.</p>

<p>The ships for the relief of Derry lay in the Foyle, under
Colonel Kirk, and he sent a detachment for the relief of
Inniskillen under the command of Colonel Wolseley. With two
thousand Ulster recruits this English officer, who had repulsed
Anthony Hamilton, advanced against the Jacobites to protect
Inniskillen. He was met by General MacCarthy, recently made Lord
Mountcashel. With his hastily-raised soldiers, mostly Protestant
civilians, Wolseley grimly faced six thousand professionals across
the bog beyond the village of Newtown-Butler. The news of this
sudden offensive on the part of the Protestants was brought to
Sarsfield at Bundoran by an express from Mountcashel; Luttrell, in
Sligo, was immediately warned, and Sarsfield set out through the
haze of August sunshine towards the enemy.</p>

<p>"I am glad," he said gaily, "that the rebels should have given
us this joy, for we were grown drowsy in Bundoran."</p>

<p>His spirits were high as he rode to the battle; he felt assured
(despite his late terrors) that Ishma was safe and trustful of him,
that he would be happy with his wife; but he was sorry that
Mountcashel's forces so outnumbered the English.</p>

<p>At Wattlebridge Sarsfield's horse met a body of Irish
smoke-blackened, panic-shaken dragoons; they would not pause to
give their news; the foot followed, gouted with blood, hacked and
torn; there was a sombre red streak in the sky beyond
Newtown-Butler, and the sound of cannon mingled with the crack of
shot.</p>

<p>Sarsfield himself seized the reins of a dragoon whose frightened
horse was stumbling along the rough road slowly, for it was
lame.</p>

<p>"What's this? A defeat's impossible!"</p>

<p>The fellow gave a silly laugh; one of his eyes was closed,
purple and bleeding.</p>

<p>"A defeat, sir. Hundreds drowned in the lough, hundreds slain
and made prisoner&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Mountcashel?"</p>

<p>"A prisoner, too, they say, or dead. God help us! Get back to
Sligo, sir," added the dragoon, half-weeping with rage and terror.
"Surely the devil is on the side of these filthy rogues."</p>

<p>Sarsfield drew his horse aside; his troop was near overwhelmed
by the press of fugitives; little by little the truth came out;
Sarsfield, galloping back to Sligo, forced to abandon the banks of
Lough Erne and Bundoran, found it incredible. The whole of Ulster
now remained in the hands of the Williamites. And this despite the
marvellous French administration directed by the great genius of
Louvois, despite the skill of the French officers and the care they
had taken in recruiting the Irish, despite the fact that
Mountcashel had had three times the number of men. With a bitter
heart Sarsfield listened to the tale of the flight, both of the
horse and foot, before the fierce onslaught of the irregular
troops; hard on Newtown-Butler came the news that Derry had been
relieved; the Protestants had materially and morally triumphed.
"You see what the French have done for us," said Luttrell, when
Sarsfield arrived at Sligo. "The blaze of their boasting has soon
been damped."</p>

<p>"Had I been there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, but thou wast not there, because thou art not thine own
master."</p>

<p>Colonel Luttrell bore the news of the defeat with equanimity; he
had always had a mean opinion of Mountcashel; he wished that Kirke
and Wolseley would charge in the direction of Sligo, though the
place was ill-prepared, he was pleased by the humiliation of the
French, delighted by the rumour that King James, overwhelmed by the
ill news, meant to retreat to France. But Sarsfield, who felt as if
he had been tumbled backwards to the ground, cared for nothing of
this; "the Irish <i>fled</i>" was all that mattered to him; he was
wounded through all his defences.</p>

<p>Sligo was full of tattered, defeated men; some of them had
brought with them the torn rags of company colours; Luttrell
threatened to shut the gates on any more "useless carcases" as he
termed them; the sweet shores of Lough Erne were fouled by
corpses.</p>

<p>Sarsfield fumed that there came no summons from Dublin; his
letters to Honor and his friends remained unanswered, as if
communications were broken; a sense of confusion, of futility
soured everything. Luttrell said:</p>

<p>"This will be a gripping medicine for De Rosen and no buttered
parsnips for Tyrconnel, there'll be a mighty bustle in Dublin."</p>

<p>Among the French officers who had retreated to Sligo was the
Marquis de Bonnac, Olivia's husband, and Sarsfield, in the light of
his wife's tales of him, observed him closely with a kind of
curious reluctance, for he detested anything that savoured of
prying or espionage.</p>

<p>Mons. de Bonnac, he found on report from the other Frenchmen,
was respected by his fellow-officers and liked by his men, his
ability was not conspicuous but he did his duty carefully.
Sarsfield learnt that through some unfortunate investment or
speculation he had lost much of his fortune, and was by no means
the rich man he had been when Olivia had married him. Sarsfield
wondered if this had anything to do with the lady's impatience with
her marriage. He could not dislike De Bonnac, nor see him as a man
cruel to a woman, nor, despite his wife's accusations did he seem
loose in his manners, but rather of an austere and even puritanical
bearing, such as Sarsfield had sometimes noticed in the Huguenot
French, though De Bonnac was a Catholic. He was a slight man with a
pale, gray face, much given to study and reading in his leisure
moments.</p>

<p>His constant companion was an elderly abbé of an unobtrusive
presence, who appeared to serve him as secretary or adviser and who
helped him in his learned diversions; this priest had accompanied
him to Newtown-Butler and been his companion in his flight. De
Bonnac treated Sarsfield as a mere casual acquaintance, with
official courtesy and no more. He mentioned his wife only once and
that suddenly when he said, upon remarking that the state of the
country grew daily worse, that "he was sorry she had followed him
to Ireland, for it was no country for a civilised woman." Sarsfield
thought of Olivia like a rich exotic rose, with her carefully
cultivated beauty and her fastidious exquisitiveness, blooming amid
all this filth and blood, chaos and despair.</p>

<p>He wondered if De Bonnac had heard of his relations with Olivia
which had been so maliciously distorted by the gossips, but the
Frenchman remained, in his quiet way, friendly.</p>

<p>"This must go hard with one of your mettlesome temper, Colonel
Sarsfield."</p>

<p>"With any Irishman, monseigneur."</p>

<p>"Well, we have gotten no glory out of it either. De Rosen was
confounded by the resistance of Derry. Strange how men will defend
what they love! At Newtown-Butler I saw an ensign with both legs
shattered, fighting with an empty pistol to protect the
colours."</p>

<p>"Any man would like to die like that."</p>

<p>"Any man? Oh, I don't know!" The marquis gave his aslant, not
displeasing smile.</p>

<p>The little abbé put in:</p>

<p>"Some would rather die brawling about a woman."</p>

<p>Mons. de Bonnac added:</p>

<p>"It is better to do one's duty with honour, though that may
sound dull. Some women are worth a man's whole attention, but he
who finds them is fortunate."</p>

<p>Sarsfield wondered if these suave words were directed at him; he
cared nothing; all the three women with whom his life was involved
had gone into the background of his thoughts, nor was he vexed or
troubled by any concern about them, save only he was sometimes
distressed by the thought of Ishma in Dublin, yet he felt a secret
assurance that between the care of the Shanahus and the priest she
was hidden in some house for holy women.</p>

<p>Suddenly Luttrell and Sarsfield were summoned to Dublin; Sligo
was left well-garrisoned and they went hastily.</p>

<p>"Now," said Luttrell, "we shall see who is to be jostled out of
office and who kicked in; methinks the French and their money are
parted, and I tell ye, Sarsfield, have an eye to their shams, and
do not let 'em persuade you that a cabbage is a cucumber."</p>

<p>"I will not."</p>

<p>The two men exchanged hardy glances.</p>

<p>"Don't endure their little peddling devices," urged Luttrell,
"which will inflict a wound on Ireland from which she'll maybe not
recover."</p>

<p>"I'll be alert and ready," replied Sarsfield. "I'll watch 'em
all, study all their affronts, rudeness and extravagances to see
how the Irish may come by their own. There is none I respect save
D'Avaux and he serves another master."</p>

<p>"We shall find ourselves," declared Luttrell, "amid a rabble of
cause-splitters, hectors, ruffians and puppies ready to swear a
riot, jobbers and traitors all covered up by a cloak of
loyalty&mdash;test 'em by common sense."</p>

<p>The two officers had scarcely dismounted from their sweating
horses in the castle yard than they were summoned to a general
council (summoned hastily and even in a manner of panic), at which
D'Avaux insisted Sarsfield should be present; the French ambassador
had never ceased to press Sarsfield's claims to consideration; and
when it came to the pinch, as now, he did not hesitate to show who
was really master and peremptorily told Melfort to his face that
Colonel Sarsfield should be of the council.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the meeting, held in one of the large gloomy
chambers of the castle, which had an almost dungeon-like air and
had been built for defence, not pleasure, was one of irresolution,
anger, almost despair.</p>

<p>The king sat huddled in a great chair with arms, at the head of
the long dark table. He wore a plain cinnamon-coloured suit with a
small black braid, the George slung on a blue ribbon round his
shoulder, a brown hat with a feather pulled over his brow; his head
was sunk a little on his breast, so that the thick curls of his
fair wig shaded his hollow face. His hands lay along the arms of
the chair and hung down with a helpless and inactive look; his
height, his trained and stately carriage gave him an air of sullen
grace, but his expression and his attitude conveyed sulky
discouragement and peevish ill-humour.</p>

<p>Beside him, erect and smooth-faced, stood Berwick, recently
returned from his foray on the Ulster border; Sarsfield disliked
the expression of almost contemptuous unconcern on his handsome
features, which seemed to say that he was a mere spectator in this
quarrel, and had no stake in any of the interests employed; a
king's son, young and brilliant already, at twenty well trained as
a soldier, he could find work either in Spain or the Empire, and it
must matter very little to him what became of Ireland. He was
dressed with that careful splendour which distinguished the French
officers, who, by this meticulous attention to magnificence in
their person, seemed to give an added scoff at the poverty of the
country in which they found themselves, and at the ragged misery of
the troops they commanded.</p>

<p>The powdered curls and perfumed precision of these Frenchmen
served to emphasise their conscious superiority to the Irish.</p>

<p>Sarsfield was sensible of this, he glanced from Berwick to De
Rosen, whose heavy face was scowling with ill-suppressed anger, and
then at Henry Luttrell seated beside him.</p>

<p>Luttrell smiled openly and returned the Frenchman's stare,
insolence for insolence. Sarsfield envied him his mocking ease.
Berwick's younger brother, Henry Fitz James, Duke of Albemarle and
Grand Prior, lounged and fidgeted next the small anxious figure of
D'Avaux; Sarsfield thought it one mistake among many to include
this restless, pampered and impatient boy in even such a council as
this. Tyrconnel, huge and stately, carelessly attired, his hands
shaking, his eyes suffused, stared across the table at Melfort, the
precise Scotchman, whose good-looking face was blank of all
expression; the viceroy had been gambling as usual; oddly for him
he had left the tables a loser.</p>

<p>It was a full summer day; the air blew sweetly, all gold, blue
and green, without, but the light fell bleakly from a high-set
window and gave a grim pallor to all these defiant, anxious, alert
faces.</p>

<p>Lord Melfort spoke first.</p>

<p>His manner was by training pleasant, his voice devoid of any
tone of offence, but, regardless of the presence of Luttrell and
Sarsfield, he spoke with the utmost contempt and scorn of the
Irish.</p>

<p>It had been proved, he said, what their loyalty was worth. Of
all the men raised and trained during six months of excessive
labour under the direction of some of the most experienced officers
in the world, not a dozen were worth their pay. They had failed
before Derry and Inniskillen&mdash;two towns which a battalion of
trained troops could have taken in a fortnight. Then, at
Newtown-Butler, the first brush with the enemy, they had with all
their advantage of numbers and superior officers, fled in an
ignoble panic before the onslaught of unprepared recruits.</p>

<p>Melfort then touched on the defeats suffered in the border
skirmishes and smoothly, with a courteous motion of his head
towards Berwick, put this down to the material that young general
had had at his command.</p>

<p>He then mentioned the selfish scramble of the Irish Roman
Catholics to return to their estates without any regard for the
service of the king which required every man actively in the field.
He dwelt on the fact that the island was running short of
provisions, even raw material, and that King Louis neither could
nor would send sufficient money, food and ammunition and arms to
equip the whole of Ireland for an indefinite period; he brought out
the growing strength and confidence of the north, and the tone of
the advices from England which revealed the increasing interest in
that country for the Protestant colonists, and the growing resolve
of the English Parliament that the north should be supported. He
was certain, despite the retirement of Herbert to the Scilly Isles,
that a fleet would sail to Carrickfergus bringing relief to the
Williamites. It was even rumoured that the usurping prince would
come in person to conclude the quarrel; the sum of this speech on
the part of Lord Melfort was that King James should instantly, and
while flight was possible, leave this miserable bog where he had
met with nothing but humiliation and disaster, and embark at Cork
or Waterford for France.</p>

<p>When he had made this speech Melfort leant back in his chair,
with the air of placid triumph of a man who has said what cannot
very easily be disputed, and who has put before others mere common
sense. But he knew perfectly well that his project was directly
against the interests of King Louis who had determined to keep King
James as long as possible in Ireland, thus causing a torment in
England and distracting the attention of William of Orange from the
continent; he knew too that if a considerable army and even the
usurping prince himself were to come from England that would be
exactly what King Louis had intended.</p>

<p>D'Avaux was aware that Melfort knew this and leant forward
wearily, putting his fingers together and resting his sharp chin on
them. He did not waste many words, but said directly that His
Britannic Majesty knew his, D'Avaux's, mind, which was the mind of
King Louis.</p>

<p>"The <i>will</i> of King Louis," muttered Melfort, with a
smile.</p>

<p>D'Avaux affected not to hear, but addressed himself to the
figure of the drooping king at the head of the table.</p>

<p>"One defeat, sire, is nothing. As for the reinforcements from
England, they are not here yet, and when they are, they will have
to strive with the same difficulties as those which go far to
overwhelm us. Surely I do not need to repeat to Your Majesty King
Louis's intention to hold you here established. Have we not had
within the last few weeks proof of his earnestness in the supplies
brought by Mons. Chateau-Renard?"</p>

<p>King James spoke for the first time, wearily raising his head;
he looked ill; he had had that morning a bleeding from the nose;
the handkerchief he took from his nostrils was faintly spotted with
blood.</p>

<p>"These supplies were not enough," he said sombrely. "Every time
I speak to you, D'Avaux, I have to tell you that what your master
sends is not enough. You know perfectly well that the subsidies
which my Irish Parliament have voted me were made on paper, and it
will be almost impossible to collect these taxes and, could I do
so, they are in commission. You know yourself I am reduced to brass
money, which makes me a ridicule and a reproach." He glanced at
Melfort, and added with an irresolute air: "I am for retiring to
Scotland, Dundee contrives to hold the Highlands, and it is
certainly true that I should feel easier in Scotland, easier
anywhere out of Ireland."</p>

<p>The unfortunate gentleman seemed to dwell with longing on the
thought of Scotland. He had many grievances against his northern
kingdom, but at least it was his native place, the seat of his
ancestors, and half the population were animated by a passionate
and unreasoning loyalty to his House and to his person, which he
had never found even the reflection of in Ireland.</p>

<p>"None of these people," he added sullenly, looking round the
council table, "love our person. See how they fight for me, see how
I am respected." He turned sharply to De Rosen: "Marshal de Rosen,
have you not found these Irish impossible to train or
discipline?"</p>

<p>De Rosen replied at once in brutal language, depicting with
coarse invective the vices, cowardice, instability and poverty of
the Irish in every department, both civil and military. A look from
D'Avaux checked him; the impetuous soldier reflected that he must
consider before his own feelings the policy of his master, so he
said with a graceless effort: "I doubt not, sire, that with
reinforcements the country could be held&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Must</i> be held," commented D'Avaux, pressing his fingers
in his chin.</p>

<p>Sarsfield glanced up and took the word.</p>

<p>"It <i>will</i> be held," he said, his wide gray eyes glanced
from the Frenchman to the king.</p>

<p>Every one looked at him; in appearance he was by much the most
remarkable man there; he seemed quite easy under their
scrutiny.</p>

<p>Colonel Luttrell's glance applauded his audacity and warned him
not to carry it too far; Luttrell was always for subtle methods; it
did not irk him at all to be very civil to those whom he despised
and meant to use.</p>

<p>The pale sunlight seemed to gather colour as it rested on the
splendour of Patrick Sarsfield; but his eyes were heavy with
fatigue; the coolness with which he faced them all was quite
unconscious, so little was he thinking of himself.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-13" id="ch1-13"></a>THIRTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">
THE king looked up sharply at Sarsfield's words which were
spoken with a superb self-assurance seldom heard in the Jacobite
councils.</p>

<p>"I admire your assurance, Colonel Sarsfield," he sneered, "yet I
think that all you have gotten to your credit is a defeat. Did not
the Protestants push back your patrol at Lough Erne?"</p>

<p>"They were outnumbered ten to one, I had but five hundred men in
all. We have, sire, all of us, the greatest difficulties in the
world to contend with."</p>

<p>"And yet you speak confidently," said the king.</p>

<p>"I speak confidently, sire, because I believe in Ireland."</p>

<p>"A patriot," murmured the king, sourly, stroking his long chin.
"Well, I do not know that you can do much for me."</p>

<p>"I can do a great deal, sire, had I a free hand." Sarsfield
controlled himself, he did not wish to betray enthusiasm, ardour,
or his deep and secret passion for his country before these cold,
self-interested worldly men; he wished to maintain the practical
matter-of-fact tone of the assembly, where all seemed to be
speaking from their heads not their hearts. Even young Berwick had
a dryness in his look which seemed to bespeak disdain of all
generous sentiments; his brother, Henry Fitz James, lounged as if
he was at a tavern, and made a little game for himself with dice
that he took from his pocket, and tossed up and down on the cloth.
In such a company Sarsfield could not reveal his soul, he merely
said:</p>

<p>"Neither Ireland nor the Irish have had a chance, sire."</p>

<p>D'Avaux came to his support. The dry little Frenchman remarked,
speaking to the king with an indifference that was scarcely
respectful:</p>

<p>"Colonel Sarsfield has been wasted, sire. From the first I have
urged you to use his abilities, his popularity. Any pretty fellow
who has just gotten a commission in the Guards could have kept the
patrol on Lough Erne, Colonel Sarsfield's troop of horse are well
trained, they do not run away&mdash;a pity they were not at
Newtown-Butler&mdash;"</p>

<p>Colonel Henry Luttrell put in without regard for precedence or
permission:</p>

<p>"Irishmen require to be officered by Irishmen and by gentlemen.
When you recruit cow herds and ploughmen you must take some pains
in the turning of them into honest soldiers. I agree with Mons.
d'Avaux that Colonel Sarsfield is the man to recruit his
countrymen."</p>

<p>D'Avaux gave Henry Luttrell a sharp and, Sarsfield thought, not
altogether a friendly look. The king interrupted impatiently:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Words, words, always words!"</p>

<p>"Irresolution, irresolution, always irresolution," muttered
D'Avaux, even he, long trained to patience as he was, could
scarcely endure the daily fret of dealing with this wavering, weak,
undecided man.</p>

<p>Marshal de Rosen threw his sharp opinion across that of the
others, without any regard for what had been said, before he
demanded more severity.</p>

<p>The king, he swore, "was too lenient." This was a charge that
had not been brought against King James before, and Melfort,
remembering some affairs in Scotland and the west of England,
smiled discreetly behind his hand, but the French general, his face
suffused with passion&mdash;for he was a man hot-tempered almost to
madness&mdash;insisted that "the king had been too lenient."</p>

<p>No terms should have been offered to the Protestants or, if they
had, upon their refusal all the rebels should have been massacred,
it was the only way to deal with obstinate heretics.</p>

<p>De Rosen spoke as a man smarting under a rebuff, for the king
had sharply rebuked him for driving all the women, children and old
men under the walls of Derry, thus exposing them to the fire of the
defenders, their kinsmen. King James was once a cruel, even a
merciless man, but of late his malice seemed to have failed him.
Perhaps he remembered what his bloody severity had cost him in
England and Scotland; in any case, in Ireland, to the fury of De
Rosen and even to the irritation of D'Avaux, he hesitated to take
stern measures; at one moment he would be tyrannical, at the next,
clement; one day he would endeavour to flatter the Protestants, the
next, sacrifice them to the Roman Catholics; it seemed as if he
fought against his own nature.</p>

<p>"Wait till I get two regiments of French dragoons," stormed De
Rosen, "and I will clear the country of these gray rats within a
few weeks."</p>

<p>"But the dragoons have not arrived," put in Melfort smoothly,
"and if they should arrive they must be fed and clothed, and
armed."</p>

<p>Sarsfield said impetuously:</p>

<p>"We rely too much on foreign aid, we must look to ourselves, the
country must be so organised that it can itself provide even for
its own sustenance and defence."</p>

<p>"That is the only true policy," agreed Colonel Luttrell. He gave
his oblique and mocking glance at D'Avaux, and added: "But we must
remember that we do not serve our own policy, but that of the King
of France. We are the bait, are we not, Mons. d'Avaux, to draw
aside the dogs who fly at the throat of His Most Christian Majesty
King Louis?"</p>

<p>D'Avaux ignored this stinging truth by saying:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, gentlemen, we wrangle to no purpose! You know my
mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That of your master," interrupted Luttrell, half under his
breath, "and that is to keep us here till we are all dead and
damned." He turned to Sarsfield, urging him to speak again.</p>

<p>Colonel Luttrell was the only man who did not feel slightly
uneasy, faintly vexed by the presence of Patrick Sarsfield, whose
sincerity and single-mindedness were repellent to the others; as
Father Terence O'Fahy had noticed, Sarsfield spoke with the
spiritual accents of another race; his place was not here; there
was, too, to some, cause for offence in the splendour of his
appearance and his unconsciousness of it; and cause for dismay in
his growing popularity, which was puzzling to many. The Irish, who
had begun to show anger against both King James and the French, now
shouted for Patrick Sarsfield whenever they saw him; his own troop
regarded him with proud devotion; it was clear that he would soon
have an immense influence with the army.</p>

<p>For all these reasons the other men at the council board, save
only Henry Luttrell who hoped to associate himself with this
strange power possessed by Sarsfield, regarded the magnificent
Irishman with distrust and suspicion. Sarsfield was not conscious
of this atmosphere; he was too absorbed in his energetic desires to
think of himself or to consider any man's opinion of him; he began
to speak in that warm, persuasive voice which soothed even his
enemies, but he was interrupted after a few sentences.</p>

<p>Melfort's secretary broke in; an express from Scotland, news
from the Highlands...</p>

<p>The king broke the seal slowly; his fingers were unsteady, every
one was silent, some fidgeting, some steady in their places.</p>

<p>Sarsfield looked at all of them; they seemed revealed, like
portraits of themselves, in that sudden enforced silence; the
ruined splendour of Tyrconnel with his violet, drink-sodden
features, his gaudy ill-kept clothes; De Rosen's brutal precision;
the anxious, sober neatness of D'Avaux; the prim, handsome slyness
of Melfort; Berwick's unblemished, but oddly cold youthfulness; his
brother already marked by sloth and vice; Luttrell alert, visibly
mocking, disclosing himself to none, squinting at the king.</p>

<p>And the king himself, so old, so pitiful, so little master of
himself or his destiny, with that air of unprovoked, unmerited doom
that the Stewarts contrived to cast over the failures their own
faults and follies had brought about. A sense of futility sank the
enthusiasm of Sarsfield; what could one hope to do with such
men?&mdash;with any men?</p>

<p>"We are all surely," he thought, "a little mad, a little
childish; each to be so much in earnest about his affairs, one
would think we were going to live for ever&mdash;these old men, too, so
in earnest, so fierce, and soon they will be dead and no one
speaking of them. And while we sit here wrangling, time is flowing
away, and peace and beauty to be had without price if we willed it
so."</p>

<p>King James looked up from his despatch and round at the anxious
faces, all tense save those of Berwick, Sarsfield and Luttrell.</p>

<p>The news from Scotland was good and bad; the Cameronians had
defeated the Jacobites at Dunkeld. The Highlanders had defeated the
Williamites at Killiecrankie; but Lord Dundee was slain.</p>

<p>"The war in the Highlands is over," said King James, "and
Scotland closed to me."</p>

<p>The council broke up in disorder and dismay. Melfort kept his
countenance and was heard to say, above the vehemence and
disjointed comments, that "though it might no longer be expedient
for His Majesty to go to Scotland, there was no reason why he
should not retreat to France."</p>

<p>"Why retreat anywhere?" asked D'Avaux sharply, catching the
remark through the tumult. "I think that Killiecrankie was a
victory, not a defeat."</p>

<p>"But Dundee is dead," emphasised Melfort quickly.</p>

<p>"Have you no other leaders?" asked the Frenchman, as he glanced
at Sarsfield. "Is there no one will do for Ireland what Dundee did
for Scotland?"</p>

<p>"None, sir," replied Melfort smoothly, and the king added with a
sour impatience:</p>

<p>"Has it not always been my misfortune to be ill-served? Men like
Dundee are rare enough, where shall I find another to give me such
service?" And he glanced with dislike at all who surrounded him.
"They follow me, not for my good it seems, but for what rewards
they may get out of me."</p>

<p>The young Duke of Berwick turned on his father a look of blank
haughtiness; this was the first sign he had given of being
interested in the proceedings of the council.</p>

<p>"You might, sire, have excepted me."</p>

<p>King James glanced at his son with a half-reluctant
affection.</p>

<p>"You're too young," he conceded.</p>

<p>Berwick smiled patiently. "The fault will mend."</p>

<p>Colonel Luttrell whispered to Sarsfield as they moved from the
room: "How they despise us! We had to sit there and listen to
Ireland being insulted; they forget that we are Irish."</p>

<p>"And that," retorted Sarsfield, "is the worst insult of
all."</p>

<p>"Tyrconnel hates you," said Luttrell. "D'Avaux praises you too
much, and the viceroy has become jealous&mdash;the taking away of the
apartments in the castle from the Lady Honor was meant as a slight;
he poisons you all he can to the king. I have been at some pains to
discover how you are served in Dublin."</p>

<p>"I care not."</p>

<p>"Hast thou fallen into an easy sloth with all this brisk news on
hand? Is a little action irksome to thee?"</p>

<p>"You try to wheedle and hector me, Harry."</p>

<p>"Think of what we discussed at Bundoran&mdash;be not abased."</p>

<p>"Why do you seek to inflame me?" asked Sarsfield wearily.
"Surely we must have what unity we may in our wretched councils.
Daily I pray for patience, and you would take from me the little
that I have."</p>

<p>"It is no time for patience, or inaction, or procrastination,"
said Luttrell. "Have you thought what it would mean," he asked,
with an earnestness uncommon to his volatile moods, "if we had a
few more defeats like Newtown-Butler? Supposing the Prince of
Orange sent over a number of regular troops or even came himself?
Supposing that the reinforcements from France do not arrive, that
the king flies like a cur, the French draw off, sucking burnt
fingers...what then?"</p>

<p>"It is scarcely possible."</p>

<p>"I think it very possible. We shall then have to submit to the
foreigner and usurper or go ruined into exile; our only chance for
existence to volunteer to fight the Turks. I say," he added with
vehemence, "we must look out for ourselves and trust none of these
people."</p>

<p>Sarsfield did not reply, but stood with downcast eyes in the
antechamber closet where they had drawn aside, and Luttrell
continued.</p>

<p>"Does the counsel I gave you at Bundoran seem so fantastical
now? Can you view these men at close sight, consider their separate
self-interests, rogueries, jobberies, indifferences and
treacheries, ay, treacheries (do not trust Tyrconnel) and still
believe that by their means we can come to any good for
Ireland?"</p>

<p>"You did not use," said Patrick Sarsfield, "to be so vehement a
patriot, Luttrell."</p>

<p>"A patriot!" replied Luttrell lightly. "You may give it what
name you like, the truth is I would take some active part in these
active times and I marvel that you are so slow." He paused, and
looked at Sarsfield keenly and added: "I think the Duke of Berwick,
in whom I see some hints of greatness, would make a throw for
it."</p>

<p>"A throw for what?" asked Sarsfield sharply.</p>

<p>And Luttrell replied:</p>

<p>"Why, some pre-eminence. He is a king's son and has
extraordinary parts; his age is a fault that will mend, as he said
just now. I told you this before, lately I have observed him
better&mdash;a sweet youth, hard and sharp as tempered steel."</p>

<p>Sarsfield checked his companion.</p>

<p>"Thou art a wild, fantastical fellow, Harry, or sometimes I
think so; but what you say has some bottom of sound sense, with the
government so unsettled and all in pieces&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your chance has come to unravel the whole contrivance of our
confusions."</p>

<p>"I will," replied Sarsfield, "consider this, if the king forsake
us, even the odium of rebellion, even the risk of being totally
trampled down might be dared. Come to me in Fishamble Street, let
us not be seen whispering here."</p>

<p>No doubt, he thought, as Luttrell left him, that resolute man
had taken these words as a pledge and Sarsfield was much minded to
make them so; all were dull and helpless, or greedy and corrupt,
broaching impudent and mischievous schemes, they had treated him
with disdain, too, because he was Irish; why, even after the
despatch had been read, some one might have asked him to take up
his speech, but no one had cared to hear what he might have been
about to say&mdash;of Ireland, for Ireland...</p>

<p>Galway had lodged his sister in Fishamble Street; Sarsfield
dreaded intruding on his wife but she would be expecting him, he
wondered if she and Galway, her brother, would be of Luttrell's
advice?</p>

<p>As he left the castle he had to pass the door of the royal
apartments; the king stood in the entrance; behind him were the
figures of two priests; James stopped Sarsfield who remained,
surprised at being accosted, his hat in his hand, in the centre of
the corridor.</p>

<p>The king supported himself against the door jambs; he played
with his handkerchief stained with small spots of fresh blood; his
full-veined hand shook. Sarsfield observed the rough gray stubble
on his ill-shaven jaws, the bistre shadows beneath his sunk eyes
almost hidden by the weighty lids, the deep-cut, sour lines from
nose to mouth which was set in a constant sneer; some of the braid
was loose on his coat; his linen was slightly soiled; he was no
longer prinked out as he had been at St. Germains or on his first
coming into Ireland.</p>

<p>Sarsfield was expecting some reproach against the Irish.</p>

<p>The king said:</p>

<p>"Colonel Sarsfield, I hold you to be one of my best officers. At
the council I spoke out of a weariness and impatience. I know you
would do very much for me. Without all doubt you spoke to good
purpose. But I am much hemmed in."</p>

<p>This, coming straight on his words to Luttrell, left Sarsfield
without a reply; the king's dim gaze, clouded with melancholy,
filled the Irishman with remorse.</p>

<p>"I am resolved to stay in Ireland, Colonel Sarsfield, don't
think you are to be forsaken."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty is well advised."</p>

<p>"I do hope it. They say you have influence with the rabble. I
pray you control their ruffling which often smacks little of
loyalty to me."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty means the Irish?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I am much in the hands of others." The king's attention
seemed to wander; he gave his hand, still elegant, to Sarsfield to
kiss. "I thank you for your loyalty." He fumbled in his deep, laced
pocket, and brought out a small crystal phial enclosing a dry
reddish substance. "'Tis a drop of the blood of Saint Ignatius," he
muttered, "of much virtue. Keep it always on your person. Do not
think I confuse you with a parcel of peevish fellows who ought to
be hanged out of the way."</p>

<p>Sarsfield, under some concern, thanked him for the relic.</p>

<p>"It hath been my great misfortune," added the king, "to be ill
served and often betrayed."</p>

<p>He entered his apartment; the door closed on him and the
priests.</p>

<p>"It would be a Judas trick to play him false," thought
Sarsfield; the aslant light from a deep-set window shone on the
relic in his hand.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-14" id="ch1-14"></a>FOURTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">
PATRICK SARSFIELD made his way through filthy crowded streets
foul with smells drawn up by the rays of summer sun, to the house
Galway had chosen for Honor in the fashionable Fishamble
Street.</p>

<p>The lady was prepared for her husband's arrival; he believed her
a person who would never be either astonished or confused; there
was a certain proud fineness about her that he much admired.</p>

<p>She wore a dress of shining silk, dead-lavender colour, with
much silver tinsel and braiding, that gave her a moonlight
brightness; her childish slenderness was dignified by her prim
carriage, and the stately dressing of her smooth hair, the colour
of a faded bay leaf. She seemed a stranger to Sarsfield and not the
girl whose overthrow in their bridal chamber he had miserably
witnessed.</p>

<p>He was glad she had left those gloomy chambers in the castle;
this commonplace fashionable house had an ordinary cheerfulness
that suited Honor and her husband's need for solace.</p>

<p>She had fitted up a tiny chapel in a closet off the dining-room;
a lamp hung before a half-seen shrine; the wick fluttered behind
the red glass so that the glowing light shook in a perpetual
monotony; a pastel slowly consumed in a brazier, the fumes
withering a vase of curled lilies on the narrow altar. The Lady
Honor had all in order, she had been well trained by the nuns.</p>

<p>The neat house, the decent, sober servants, the exact
appointments, the air of quiet regularity, the costly and courtly
appearance of Honor herself took away all embarrassment from their
meeting.</p>

<p>She received her husband with a ceremonious kindness, a dutiful
respect, that warmed his heart towards her. She had spent his money
freely. Her rooms, he observed, were elegant and full of trivial
luxuries. She had recompensed herself for her period of poverty by
purchasing all that Dublin could afford of comfort and
extravagance.</p>

<p>Sarsfield, though the most easy and generous of men, cared
nothing for luxury and marked with a secret regret his wife's
expensiveness. For the more of his money that went to her the less
there was for Ireland, and he was already maintaining his troop of
horse at his own expense.</p>

<p>Honor, for all her youth easy and sophisticated, startled him by
saying with a cool, pleasant air, "that she had seen much of the
young Duke of Berwick" during her husband's absence; "he was sent
here and there on a series of skirmishes but was often in
Dublin."</p>

<p>"His Grace said it was the most horrid silly campaign he had
ever heard of," she smiled, "and when he came to the castle he was
kind enough to wait on me and give me all the news. But," she
added smoothly, "I never spoke to him save in the way of
honour."</p>

<p>"You do yourself a wrong to assure me of that," said Sarsfield;
the kindness of her welcome was overcast when he thought, with a
chill, how utterly a stranger she was to him, how they must live
together, man and wife, till death did remove one of them; how much
was to be debated and corrected between them.</p>

<p>"The duke," she added undeterred by his rebuke, "speaks very
highly of you, sir, and thinks it is a misfortune for the country
and His Majesty's cause that you have not been further advanced and
more conspicuously employed."</p>

<p>Sarsfield smiled a little sadly. It was odd that she should
repeat to him the praise and patronage of the Duke of Berwick&mdash;had
she forgotten their wedding-night, when he had found her wildly
sobbing over that youth's miniature? Some men might have taken this
as the very dregs of impertinence. He turned away lest he should
show vexation with her dainty curious gossip; but Honor, like one
who has a point to pursue, refused to be turned from her
object.</p>

<p>"If you made a party," she added, "the duke would be of it."</p>

<p>"A party for me! Who would be talking to you of that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Colonel Luttrell spoke to every one of this. He intrigues
for you very cleverly."</p>

<p>"Behind my back and without my knowledge," said Sarsfield. "Has
he also been much at Dublin?"</p>

<p>"Oh, frequently. In fact, sir, I think you were the only officer
of position and merit who has been kept so far and so long from the
court, and you must, no doubt, perceive in it the malice of some
enemy."</p>

<p>"If my inaction has irked me I have made no complaints nor do I
wish others to do so for me. My duty, if monotonous, has been
plain. Honor, I do not wish to mingle in intrigue."</p>

<p>"But merely," she asked, "to do as you are bid as any young
fellow who carries a pair of colours in the Guards?"</p>

<p>Sarsfield saw himself being drawn into an argument.</p>

<p>He was not able, experienced or willing in discussion, and he
could see his wife, with adroit feminine wit and shallow
cleverness, defeating him at every turn by mere choice of phrase
and use of darting stinging words. At once and with an air of
finality, he said:</p>

<p>"Honor, it does not please me that you, or Luttrell, or Berwick,
should intrigue in my behalf. Such influence as I may possess with
the Irish I intend to use in the service of His Majesty, and it is
but a dream, misbegotten during the furies of these difficult
times, to suppose that I could set myself up."</p>

<p>"Colonel Luttrell said that you were slow and heavy in
spirit."</p>

<p>"And I say," returned Sarsfield quietly, "that he is
subtle-working and artful; I shall withdraw my friendship from him
and I desire, Honor, that you do the same." It seemed to him, as he
spoke, that this woman, whom he must welcome to his board and bed
and see for ever on his hearth, had joined his enemies; and yet
this was a fact, too, that she had done him no wrong, only
chattered and gossiped a little, listened to designing and foolish
people. And what else had she to do, poor soul, shut up lonely in
Dublin, with the name of wife only? He came abruptly to a matter
that had been close to his heart since he had returned to the
city.</p>

<p>"What of those poor creatures who came to you asking for
protection in my name, those of whom you wrote, Honor? You did not
mention them again, though I requested you for some further
knowledge as to their fortunes."</p>

<p>"The matter went from my mind," said the Lady Honor, casually.
"The old woman is dead, we have had the plague in the lower parts
of the city, and the priest gone I know not where&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The girl," interrupted Sarsfield. "Where is the girl?"</p>

<p>"Are you concerned in the girl?" smiled his young wife.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you must go to Madame de Bonnac for your news. She took
pity on the creature when none else would."</p>

<p>Sarsfield's whole soul flowed out in a glow of gratitude towards
Olivia de Bonnac.</p>

<p>"Could not you have kept her yourself, given her some post about
you?" he asked, but gently and not in a tone of reproach.</p>

<p>"I? No. Then I had the apartments in the castle and there was no
accommodation; besides the girl was good for nothing, she had no
accomplishments&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think she had," said Sarsfield, "there were many matters in
which you might have employed her."</p>

<p>"You know her well?" asked his wife.</p>

<p>"I have seen her"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"twice, I think. Of gentle
birth," he added dryly, and then paused; it was impossible for him
to tell Honor of the half-faery atmosphere in which he had seen
Ishma O'Donaghoe, of her regal descent, of her strange life on the
banks of the lake in the west. And Honor looked at him shrewdly,
and seemed amused.</p>

<p>"Of course, you know, sir," she remarked, "the girl is a
simpleton, a natural, there is one in every village."</p>

<p>"Does she seem so to you?" asked Sarsfield, and then he
reflected that so indeed might Ishma O'Donaghoe appear to the Lady
Honor...a natural, a simpleton, a half-wit.</p>

<p>"Her head's full of nonsense," said Honor; "scarcely can one get
any sense out of her. Her language, too, is uncouth; she knows
nothing and has seen nothing; indeed, I could not be plagued with
her, and I wondered how she came to know your name and think she
might ask protection from you."</p>

<p>Sarsfield would speak no more of this matter to his wife.</p>

<p>"I have half-forgotten myself," he replied.</p>

<p>Honor leant back in her low yellow satin chair and clasped her
small hands behind her smooth head; she looked at him, Sarsfield
thought, as if she read him; his affairs seemed as public as if
they had been bawled in the streets. His heart turned from
Luttrell; the man must be no better than a busy intriguer, talking
with women, trying to draw all into his schemes; how carefully he
had kept from Sarsfield that he had frequently left Sligo for
Dublin, that he had endeavoured to involve Honor and&mdash;of all
men&mdash;Berwick, whom he had rather spoken of as a possible rival. And
Honor wished him to fall into these secret workings against
authority; her childish vanity entered into Luttrell's plots...</p>

<p>The whole affair which, discussed on the shores of Lough Erne or
broached after the hot sting of Newtown-Butler, had had a certain
brave nobility, was now tainted for Sarsfield.</p>

<p>Candles were brought in; husband and wife looked at each other
across the sudden light. She noted that he was fatigued beyond his
natural pallor, and he noted that her young face was delicately
painted.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-15" id="ch1-15"></a>FIFTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">
"SIR," smiled the Lady Honor, "if you wish to see the simple
creature, pray go to Madame de Bonnac and make inquiry after
her..."</p>

<p>"I do intend to do as much."</p>

<p>"I hope, sir, you do not blame me for some supposed lack of
charity."</p>

<p>"I blame you for nothing, but as this Irish lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You call her by that title," broke in Honor softly.</p>

<p>"I have told you she is a gentlewoman. I say that if this lady,
this gentlewoman, came to Dublin asking for my protection, I had
rather she had been at the charges of my wife than at those of
Madame de Bonnac."</p>

<p>"She is at no one's charges," replied Honor; "the woman is well
supplied. She had some old cried-up gems, some gold work in three
colours that she sold very well in Dublin&mdash;again, through Madame de
Bonnac's care."</p>

<p>"And again," replied Sarsfield, "I would it had been through
yours, dear heart."</p>

<p>And he thought, "Had we been really husband and wife, had there
been any tenderness between us, for my sake she would have done
what she could for this other woman."</p>

<p>He made no disguise of the haste he was in to be on his errand,
but deferred all her business, her household accounts and some
requests she had to make, the gossip which had accrued since his
departure, until he had visited Madame do Bonnac.</p>

<p>That lady still lodged in Skinner's Row; Sarsfield made his way
through the crowd, now more ragged and more clamorous than before,
for the French, the English refugees, the Roman Catholic Irish were
flocking to and swarming in the capital. The brass money, the
scanty supplies from France, the continued obstinacy of the rebel
north, the ill news from Scotland, England and the continent had
left their mark upon the followers of King James. There were
discontented faces and ragged coats, sly looks and sulky brows,
among the press which hurried or lounged in the fashionable streets
of Dublin. It was a hot summer evening, the defilements of the city
filled the afternoon air with a sour reek. Sarsfield thought of
that other Ireland&mdash;the wild, noble coast of Cork; the sweet vistas
of purple mountains; the placid lake between the azure hills and
the arbutus trees waving long leaves in the pure air overhung with
pearly skies. He ached with home-sickness as he elbowed his way
among this alien crowd, over the dirty pavements, through the dull
alleys.</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac was not abroad and Sarsfield was received
immediately. As he entered the trim house he met Colonel de Bonnac
issuing from a cabinet with the little abbé, his inseparable
companion, beside him. For a second he glanced at Sarsfield,
without hostility, but as if he did not recognise him, though they
had so lately met in Sligo. His face was curiously without colour
and his lips strained in a half-grin, his right hand pressed
tightly to his side. Sarsfield explained his business and then
Mons. de Bonnac appeared to remember him and greeted him
civilly.</p>

<p>"The young damsel is in my wife's charge, I believe. The women
say that she is half-witted, but for myself I perceive nothing of
the kind."</p>

<p>"Her simplicity," declared Sarsfield, grateful for this opinion,
"is merely that of one who has lived long enclosed in solitude with
nature and the old tales that rise from nature; there are many such
in my unfortunate country, Mons. de Bonnc, who must appear as
simpletons to the sophisticated."</p>

<p>"My wife will tell you further of her," replied the Frenchman,
and he courteously motioned his guest up the rich narrow stairway.
His regard was keen but not unfriendly; Sarsfield liked the
man.</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac received him as if she had been waiting for
him; indeed she made no disguise of the fact that since she had
heard of his arrival in Dublin she had been expecting him, and had
sat at home, putting off her pleasures abroad.</p>

<p>"I knew that you would come," she smiled, "but do not accuse me
of conceit. I did not expect you for my own sake."</p>

<p>"I must relieve you of a charge you take for me," replied
Sarsfield. "I am sorry it hath been so long. I knew nothing of it
and was detained these many months at Bundoran."</p>

<p>"You did not get leave as did the other officers," remarked the
lady. "There are few of them I have not seen in my drawing-room
this spring and summer&mdash;save only yourself, Colonel Sarsfield."</p>

<p>He was conscious, seeing her again after these many months, of a
sweeth warmth and radiance in her lovely presence. She seemed to
give out light and joyousness as Honor, his poor wife, appeared to
give out chilliness and disdain. Her beauty, besides, was of a
luxuriance impossible to ignore and the old, uneasy passion rose in
him. He admired, too, of all things, her generosity and her action
towards Ishma O'Donaghoe which had done much to revive his
admiration for her. He wished in all simplicity that he had been
coming home to Madame de Bonnac instead of to the Lady Honor
Sarsfield. She put him utterly at his ease, her manners were
sweetly tolerant, she made no effort to rouse his tenderness; here
was affection, understanding, sympathy. She related to him, with
pleasant matter-of-factness, her chance visit to Dublin Castle to
the Duchess of Tyrconnel where she had heard through one of the
vicereine's daughters of the Lady Honor Sarsfield's embarrassment
on the arrival of the three fugitives from Cork.</p>

<p>"So I relieved her of her difficulty, which I could very easily
do&mdash;why, there is nothing in it. The young girl is no trouble. She
cards and spins very neatly and is neat and innocent in all her
ways."</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield winced at this hint that Ishma might have been
reduced to some genteel manner of servitude.</p>

<p>"She is a gentlewoman, Madame de Bonnac."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think she is a gentlewoman, but one strangely bred, I
only just begin to understand her speech." Madame de Bonnac smiled
delicately and added: "She is simple-minded or what we worldly folk
call so. See her for yourself," she added, "and judge if or no I
have been kind," and her last whisper sighed, "for your sake."</p>

<p>She opened an inner door and led him through an antechamber into
a pleasant closet overlooking the street, which was light and
sweet, with a large open window.</p>

<p>Sarsfield first noticed a long dark crucifix on one wall and a
tumult of flowers in a beaupot on a side-table, then Ishma
O'Donaghoe between blossoms and cross, seated at a delicate
spinning-wheel, carding pure white wool.</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Madame de Bonnac, "she has some explanation to
make to you, to me she would say nothing."</p>

<p>Ishma O'Donaghoe rose and curtsied to her hostess and Sarsfield;
she had easily learned a touching formality and her simplicity had
an air of breeding; her candid eyes turned to Sarsfield with
pleasure and without amaze, as if she welcomed one long-expected;
he remembered that sweet expression on her face when he had met her
by the ruined mansion of the MacCarthys, holding the ash-wand in
her hand, walking on the lonely road.</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac left them and Patrick Sarsfield sat down by the
open window as Ishma again took her place by the spinning wheel.
The air was purer here than down in the street and blew freshly
across his face. He said:</p>

<p>"I am very sorry that you should have come to Dublin and found
me away."</p>

<p>She answered: "I have found a gracious hospitality with your
friend."</p>

<p>Ishma sat still by her spinning wheel and looked at him without
timidity, and he looked at her and found all the best of Ireland in
her aspect, so warm and innocent, so lovely pure she was in her
comely grace, in her abandonment and desolation, with her air of
gentle, secret musing.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he asked in a low voice, for he was most moved, "what
happened to disturb you in your pleasant solitude?"</p>

<p>Ishma folded her hands childishly in her lap and told him, in a
language that he found difficult to follow yet sweetly musical to
hear, that a horde of rapparees had broken into the lonely village
and murdered some people, caused others to flee, and burnt the
huts, nobody knowing the why and the wherefore. She and the
Shanahus and the priest had set out, inquiring their way from
village to village, from road to road, until they had come to
Dublin where, he had told her, he might be found if she were in any
distress or necessity. They had their hardships and their terrors
on this journey, but had escaped outrage. They had had a little
money which they had managed to conceal in their bundles and some
of their treasures&mdash;the collar of the wolf-hound, the chessmen,
some brooches and bracelets of fine pale Irish gold.</p>

<p>"The Shanahus is dead," she added, and her gray-purple eyes were
washed with tears.</p>

<p>The priest had gone, seeking help from a convent he knew of
outside Dublin, and she had not seen him again. She had sold,
through Madame de Bonnac, some of her treasures, she would accept
hospitality but not charity, she had waited for his coming, his
wife had repulsed her, almost (she thought) with mockery. She
excused that and had taken no offence. She added that it was
strange that he should have a wife, she had not thought of him as
wed; at Irrelagh he had seemed so free, there was much she could
not piece together.</p>

<p>"My marriage was but a few months ago," said Sarsfield, and he
wished to add that it had been but a mere matter of convention and
ceremony, but loyalty to Honor silenced him. He wondered, with
anguish, what he should do with Ishma. There she sat, paler and
slighter than before, with her heavy blue-black hair and her purple
shadowed eyes, her serene and queenly face, her childlike air,
waiting in a proud patience for his decision. In the regard of
every one she would be, he knew, but one penniless refugee the more
in the already overcrowded city, a peasant girl without friends or
kinsfolk, of no matter at all; even to his own heart he dare not
confess what she was to him. He wished to take her into his own
home but thought of Honor's cool sophisticated smile, her cruel
wonder; he pondered if he might send her to his own demesne at
Lucan...She broke into his thoughts by saying:</p>

<p>"I would not be a bewilderment or a distress to you; it was not
knowing of any other and we fugitive, and the murdering rapparees
behind us that made me think of the great city and the name you had
given me."</p>

<p>He rose, approached her and asked:</p>

<p>"What would you like to do, Ishma O'Donaghoe? Are you happy here
with Madame de Bonnac?"</p>

<p>She replied, looking at him earnestly, but without appeal or
coquetry:</p>

<p>"I would rather be independent, I would rather return to
Irrelagh, I would rather live alone somewhere in the country."</p>

<p>"I fear it is not possible, we have most bloody war from coast
to coast; all women and feeble folk must gather in the towns."</p>

<p>"Then if I must stay here, I would have a little room to myself,
and bide quiet, and it may be a decent old woman to wait on me, for
I have never done the work of a servant and I'm an O'Donaghoe. And
may be a priest to visit me now and then, and a chapel nearby where
I can go for my prayers, I might see you perhaps from a window
sometimes coming to and fro the castle."</p>

<p>She smiled like a child who has painted some delicious picture
of delightful but impossible pleasure, and Patrick Sarsfield turned
aside that she might not guess the emotion he could scarcely
hide.</p>

<p>"That can easily be done, I will contrive it for you, and I
think myself that you should no longer be in the charge of Madame
de Bonnac, who is not even an Irishwoman."</p>

<p>"She has a fair regard for you. She did for me what your wife
would not do&mdash;without stint or question or reproach, she sheltered
me."</p>

<p>"The Lady Honor is very young and inexperienced. She has come
from a convent but a few months since."</p>

<p>"It is in the convent that they, these holy women of God, should
teach the kindness of heart and hospitality and charity. But the
narrow heart and the closed hand Christ and the Sidhe do not bless.
They delight in the magnificence and the splendour of love, the
generosity and the kindness."</p>

<p>She wound her white wool close on the spindle and looked at him
as a gentle queen, as one giving audience.</p>

<p>"I have treasure"&mdash;she did not appear to know the word
"money"&mdash;"and Brian the wolf-hound yet; they keep him here for me
in the stables. I am unskilled in the city and in any manner of
business, but if you could find me a lodging, a room like this,
high-set if possible, above the filth of the streets, I should be
satisfied. To some come the loneliness and the waiting and the
courage to put aside desire."</p>

<p>Sarsfield, full of confused sorrow, stood looking at the girl,
who expected nothing more from him but his departure. He longed to
ask her if she could recall the details of their last meeting, and
if she could remember at all when he had held her under the dark
yew at Irrelagh.</p>

<p>Again he knew that overwhelming need of a miracle to reconcile
himself to the drab commonplaces of life; he was so bound by duty
and convention, and what he must term honour, that he could
scarcely venture to ask her why she had come to him, what she
expected of him, and what her feelings might be.</p>

<p>Ishma's mien and face told him nothing, but he believed that she
had brought her invisible world with her, that she was aware of
very little of what passed about her; therefore no doubt she was
termed a simpleton. He kissed her hand with great respect and she
accepted the homage without confusion, and went back to her
pleasant toil. There was nothing to be said, nothing to be
done.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield returned to Madame de Bonnac who sat in a
listless attitude in a gleaming brocade-covered chair, her
beautiful rounded arm supporting her fair face, her glittering hair
falling heavily round her white wrist. She glanced up at him and
smiled a little wistfully.</p>

<p>"She is beautiful, is she not?" she asked. There was a great
mirror behind her in which she was reflected, brilliant in the
light of the cluster of candles.</p>

<p>"Do you think she is beautiful?" he evaded, listless, heavy with
distress.</p>

<p>Then Madame de Bonnac said that which startled him out of his
melancholy reverie.</p>

<p>"My Lord Galmoy thinks her beautiful&mdash;eh, <i>mon Dieu</i>! He
finds her fresh, sweet, I know not what."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry my Lord Galmoy hath seen this lady. Is he a
friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"He knows my husband, he comes here sometimes with the other
officers," replied Madame de Bonnac indifferently. "What have you
against him?"</p>

<p>"All honest men have against him the murder of Captain Dixie and
many other such acts," replied Sarsfield hotly. "He hath done more
than any to make the name of the loyalists detested in this
country. I dislike him."</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac shrugged her smooth bare shoulders with a
negligence that seemed to say, "These are the affairs and judgments
of men and nothing to do with me."</p>

<p>"He is a pretty fellow and has smooth manners," was her comment.
"He is fastidious in his choice of beauty and I thought you would
be pleased to hear that he confirmed your taste for this young
creature&mdash;this wild maiden with the barbaric name. My lord named
her 'the snowy-breasted pearl.'"</p>

<p>"Who else hath remarked her?"</p>

<p>"Why, one or two greedy glances were given her but none were as
eager as my Lord Galmoy, yet he did not think so highly of her when
I commented that she was scattered in her intellects."</p>

<p>"It is not fair to burden you with her, especially as you think
her a simpleton, Madame de Bonnac. She has, as you said, some
treasure and some pride; I will take her away and house her with
some of my own relatives."</p>

<p>This was not his intention. He intended to keep Ishma O'Donaghoe
secretly, as she herself had suggested, in some sequestered chamber
with some decent woman as a companion, but he spoke of his
relatives to give the affair a conventional air, though he knew
there was none of them who would not have regarded Ishma O'Donaghoe
as his wife regarded her, and treated her with amused
indifference.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to take her away?" demanded Madame de Bonnac
with sudden heat. "Have I not been kind to her, have I not done all
I could? She is not an easy house companion."</p>

<p>"For that reason," exclaimed Sarsfield, quick to seize his
advantage, "I will remove her. She is my responsibility, not yours,
Madame de Bonnac. Her gratitude, my gratitude are infinite." The
words "we cannot take favour from a foreigner" rushed foolishly to
his lips, but he checked them. "It is but a trifling affair," he
said with an affected lightness, "and I will not have you concerned
further in't."</p>

<p>"Where did you meet this charmer?" asked Madame de Bonnac, also
affecting a light indifference to the whole matter, but her
gleaming eyes beneath her lowered lids showed an avid
curiosity.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield smiled at the question. Impossible to answer
that he had met the girl when he had been waiting for her, Olivia
Joyce, that he had held and kissed the girl under the dark yew,
thinking it was she, Olivia Joyce, whom he then believed his dear,
true love. He could not tell her this fantastic story, could not
speak in her presence of that faint, far-off episode, that vision
within a dream...how foolish, how romantical, how obsessed he had
been to suppose that Olivia Joyce would ever come to murmur a
love-charm amid the graves and ruins of Irrelagh; he knew her now
and knew his own folly; the hum of the spinning-wheel sounded from
the closet. Sarsfield replied that he had met the girl and her
relatives when he had been quartered near Kinsale, that they had
offered him kindness...why, no more.</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac did not urge for details. She rose to her full
height, but was still little beside him; she stared at his martial
presence so handsomely equipped for war and asked him with heavy
impatience in her rich voice:</p>

<p>"Have you come back to Honor or to me?" She linked her soft
hands together and added swiftly. "Do you think I am going to be
for ever patient?"</p>

<p>The hum of the spinning stopped, went on, stopped; in the tawny
candle-light the folds of Madame de Bonnac's satins gleamed like
solid silver, the shadows were of an exquisite tenderness beneath
her chin, between her round, half-exposed breasts.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-16" id="ch1-16"></a>SIXTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">
"I AM sorry to the heart," said Sarsfield, "that you should be
displeased with me."</p>

<p>He was overwhelmed by a sense of perpetual frustration; he felt
a great need of Olivia de Bonnac, of her worldly gaiety, of the
serenity with which she dealt with confused affairs, of her warm
beauty and lively charm which made existence so adorned and so
easy. But he was deep-rooted in tradition, in honour, in reserve,
which bred a thousand hesitations.</p>

<p>"I believe," smiled Madame de Bonnac, "that you still dream as
you did when you were a boy," and she added, "Take care or you will
miss everything worth while, even the dream."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," he replied, "I think that I have already missed it.
Believe that I am conscious of my failure."</p>

<p>She gave him from under her heavy lids a glance which was at
once an offer and a reproach, but she was not the woman to
importune or plead.</p>

<p>"So," she said quietly and with a smile, "you did return to
Dublin for Honor and not for me?"</p>

<p>"I am pledged to her," he replied; "we need each other's
help."</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac pulled at the laces which fell over a bosom the
colour and texture of orange blossom in the warm yellow light.</p>

<p>"If you really wished to help little Honor you should bid her be
more discreet. She has seen a good deal of my Lord Berwick during
your absence. I suppose you will think me no more than a vulgar
gossip, but I cannot endure that you should be laughed at. No one
respects the deceived husband."</p>

<p>She swiftly lowered herself in his eyes by this; he thought her
very gross in her judgment and much lacking in that gentleness he
so prized in women. He could not answer and moved away, and she
laughed in his face as if she thought him childlike and simple; and
this laugh also said, "I have not done with you yet, however
impregnable you think yourself." She drew him into another
apartment, as if the hum of the spinning-wheel vexed her; preceding
him she carried in her steady hand a branched candlestick, the
light went before them into the dark room, dispelling shadows.</p>

<p>"I have been and may be deceived in much," smiled Sarsfield,
"but never in the character of my wife. What you term indiscretion
is but a proud candour."</p>

<p>"I'll not dispute it," replied Madame de Bonnac slightly, "'tis
of no matter."</p>

<p>She set down the candles.</p>

<p>"No doubt you are eager to begone, Colonel Sarsfield, but I wish
to speak to you&mdash;and not of love."</p>

<p>But she looked at him as if love must be her sole theme.</p>

<p>"What business can we have to discuss?" asked Sarsfield in pure
surprise; he had never thought of Olivia de Bonnac as likely to be
concerned in anything save languorous frivolities.</p>

<p>"Colonel Luttrell," she answered, "has been much with me this
summer. He is very able and daring&mdash;he is the man you need&mdash;I, too,
would help&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sarsfield checked her immediately and sternly; Luttrell's
project, Luttrell himself was now finally condemned in his eyes;
there was, it seemed, no patriotism, no sincerity in it, nothing
but chamber intriguing and the drawing in of artful women&mdash;so
Luttrell had chattered, not only to Honor but to Olivia de Bonnac!
Sarsfield looked at her with newly-opened eyes; she was the type so
well known at the court from which she came&mdash;the busy, subtle
intriguer, though he had never troubled to guess it; but Henry
Luttrell had found her out and quietly and quickly enough;
Sarsfield was humiliated.</p>

<p>"We have all mistaken one another, Madame de Bonnac. If Colonel
Luttrell used my name it was without my warranty&mdash;if I had any
hesitation 'tis over." As she was about to answer he added angrily,
"Set no snares for me, nor try to encumber me with persuasions. I
do intend to be free of all of it."</p>

<p>"Have you no ambition?"</p>

<p>"None to be Luttrell's cat's-paw. And you, how far have you gone
in his schemes? Your husband is a French officer, and Luttrell
designs directly against the French interest."</p>

<p>"That is spoken like a child. I hope you will come to a clearer
sense of what is intended for you. Ah, I perceive I must fight your
engrossing dreams. Could you put them away you might be a great
man, you might even save the country over which you have mused so
much&mdash;have you thought of that? I am more powerful than you think.
And so is Henry Luttrell."</p>

<p>"I do believe it. I pray you let us have no more of this."</p>

<p>The whole intrigue was hateful to Sarsfield; he was disgusted,
ashamed at ever having been involved in even the fringes of it; his
pride and his honesty alike recoiled from the thought of Henry
Luttrell, Olivia de Bonnac and his wife (the most strangely
assorted company, surely!) intriguing, for their several ambitions
and vanities, to exploit his shy and guarded patriotism.</p>

<p>"I am too clumsy for these fine webs," he said, "even should you
enmesh me I should break them. Hold me, Madame, too simple, too
dull to serve your turn."</p>

<p>Olivia de Bonnac had the grace and prudence not to foment this
into a quarrel; she saw she dealt with an angry, disgusted man; she
could even conceal her own pain, and that was keen.</p>

<p>Her smile appealed for pity; she seemed to offer her beauty in
extenuation of all her faults; she sighed, raised her hand, let it
fall and sighed again.</p>

<p>He went into the other room and picked up his hat and cane; he
thought that this was the end of all between him and Henry
Luttrell, between him and Olivia de Bonnac.</p>

<p>The lady thought otherwise. But for the moment she dismissed him
with a smiling gentleness, and he went heavily down the stairs
trying to put women out of his head, for he had many affairs on his
mind. As he descended he could hear the hum of the Irish girl's
spinning-wheel, and it made a melody in the most secret recesses of
his heart.</p>

<p>As he was leaving the house he was accosted by the little abbé,
who was secretary to Mons. de Bonnac. This person begged leave to
accompany him a few yards along the street.</p>

<p>"Mons. de Bonnac," remarked the abbé, as they moved adroitly
through the jostling crowds in Skinner's Row, "and I also in my
poor judgment think that you should move the young Irish
gentlewoman to another lodgment."</p>

<p>Sarsfield was surprised by this and answered readily:</p>

<p>"Such was my intention. She is, in a manner, my responsibility,
and above all I would not have Mons. de Bonnac's establishment
incommoded&mdash;"</p>

<p>The abbé interrupted:</p>

<p>"It is not that, my master is not ungenerous nor inhospitable.
The young gentlewoman, as you understand, knows nothing."</p>

<p>"She is totally inexperienced, hath lived entirely away from
what we call the world."</p>

<p>"Therefore she is out of place in that house," replied the abbé.
"Madame de Bonnac is a woman of the world. She receives a worldly
company; there is much idleness and lewd play in Dublin now and
many men who think of nothing but amusement&mdash;" He broke off and
then added with an agreeable smile and a conciliatory air: "Mons.
de Bonnac thinks that your young refugee would be happier in a
convent such as that of the Clares than mingling in society which
to her must be alien." With that he saluted his companion and
returned rapidly through the press.</p>

<p>Sarsfield was startled. He was forced to suppose this was part
of the malice of which Madame de Bonnac had complained in her
husband, for though there was obvious wisdom in the advice, it was
not possible for him to believe that Ishma O'Donaghoe was not as
safe in the house of Olivia de Bonnac as she would have been in a
convent; nevertheless he felt an added pressure on him to remove
her. He thought of his mother, of his two sisters&mdash;Lady Kilmallock
and Lady Mount Stephen. These gentle and enthusiastic women, who
would willingly have helped him, had remained at St. Germains in
the court of the exiled Queen, together with many other ladies of
their rank who were not willing to risk the confusion of war in
Ireland.</p>

<p>A convent! He did not wish to put that young creature, the very
symbol of all that was natural and free, behind the high walls and
under the rigid discipline of a nunnery. And as he returned to his
own house he was already considering how he might place the Irish
girl on his own estates in Lucan...somewhere safe from all of them,
their convents, their advice, their amusements.</p>

<p>Honor was waiting in the apartment she had so elaborately and
extravagantly adorned; her look and her attitude reminded him that
he had left her alone on the first evening of his return as he had
left her alone on his wedding-night, and that they were in reality
strangers. She greeted him nervously and seemed at once pleased to
see him and angry with him; he remembered that he had been with two
women whom she might consider her rivals.</p>

<p>"You saw the young creature from Irrelagh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Honor, and Madame de Bonnac. Do not concern
yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p>She interrupted:</p>

<p>"Madame de Bonnac said something spiteful of me, I dare
swear."</p>

<p>Sarsfield was amused at the way these women understood each
other. He replied drily: "It need not concern you what Madame de
Bonnac or any other woman may say, it is you and I who have to make
a life together. As for the young girl, she will be protected and
you need think of her no more."</p>

<p>For answer Honor put her face into her hands and began to
weep.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield could not reproach her; she was a young girl
overborne by worldly considerations and her relatives; he was a man
many years older and had committed as great a folly; his impetuous
chivalry, his need of a companion in his new honours had wrought as
much harm as her cowardice.</p>

<p>"Honor, you must not weep for our mistakes. It is true that I
thought you very simple and heart-whole, that I considered our
marriage as formal as between people of our quality&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You married me out of pity and charity."</p>

<p>"Nay, Honor, you must never think so. It was largely for my own
sake, too; I needed a wife&mdash;some one to stand close to me, to help
me in many ways, and I thought that you were she. Honor, for your
own sake, you must be that woman now.</p>

<p>"For we are bound before God and man," added Honor, sobbing.</p>

<p>She had been brought up in undeviating submission to her Faith
and her principles were high, but the thought of the man whom she
really loved was humbling her spiritual pride. Her husband
perceived this and felt an immense pity. How strong, how detestable
was this conventional ambition, this selfish greed and cold
timidity which had robbed him of Olivia Joyce, which had come
between Honor de Burgh and James Fitz James, which had set all
their destinies awry and made a hard, bitter struggle of what
should have been ease and felicity.</p>

<p>"Honor, it is better you see no more of this young gentleman. If
he respects you he will stay away from you."</p>

<p>"Nothing but formalities have passed between us," she replied
mournfully; "but it is difficult for us to keep out of one
another's company."</p>

<p>She rose, and added with some pride: "I do not know how I find
the courage to tell you this, but after all I suppose you married
me to put some one between yourself and Madame de Bonnac."</p>

<p>This accurate reading, this bald statement of one of his
half-unavowed motives coming from one whom he had deemed so
inexperienced and simple, made the man smile sadly.</p>

<p>"It seems we are very plain with one another, Honor," he
replied, "and honesty is surely a fair foundation for a good
understanding." As she did not answer he added: "You will
understand I married you intending to be faithful to you in thought
and deed."</p>

<p>"I believe it," she replied, "but what is that without love? Had
you loved me," she continued perversely, "you might have made me
forget that other."</p>

<p>As he did not respond to that she added listlessly: "Why did you
and Madame de Bonnac part ten years ago?"</p>

<p>"She would not marry me because of worldly prudence."</p>

<p>Honor hung her head; she recalled the sting inflicted upon her
by the worldly prudence of her favoured lover, the worldly wisdom
which had put aside passion for convenience and profit.</p>

<p>"You would have married where you loved, without thought or
consideration, like a rash fool?" she asked her husband.</p>

<p>"Ay, Honor, so I would have wed."</p>

<p>"And I, too. We are both unfortunate."</p>

<p>"Why, so are many, Honor, and it is a mistake to think that we
are born into this world for pure happiness and delight. It is true
that you are young for such a blow as you have received, but you
are not alone, Honor; I will stand by you all I may."</p>

<p>She looked at him, her eyes wet, all her pride sunk, her
attitude suddenly humbled.</p>

<p>"If you could love me a little," she whispered, "if you could
only feign to love me..."</p>

<p>Sarsfield could understand that; being a woman and so young,
love was really all she required and without it her life would be
intolerably arid; she wanted a lover&mdash;a lawful lover&mdash;to make her
forget the love she might not have; he admired her, he pitied
her...Could not his will overpower his heart, could he not
endeavour to put her in the place of Olivia de Bonnac and that
other?</p>

<p>It was not difficult for him, in his disillusion and fatigue, to
embrace her; she did not resist but rather clung to him and, in the
intensity with which she submitted to his sad caresses, he could
read her long loneliness, her secret heartbreak, her pitiful need
for comfort. He tried to forget that he embraced a substitute in
her as she embraced a substitute in him, but still in the secret
recesses of his heart, like an enticing entreaty, was the thrum of
the spinning-wheel turned by Ishma O'Donaghoe.</p>

<p>They could not long comfort one another; their relationship was
too false; her pride too sharp, too newly stung. She left him.</p>

<p>"If you could have loved me," she muttered in unreasonable
reproach.</p>

<p>Sarsfield remained alone in the handsome, alien room; he put his
hand idly into his pocket and felt the little phial given him by
King James. Only, he thought, in loyalty and honour could there be
any defence against a load of cares.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-17" id="ch1-17"></a>SEVENTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">
THE COMTE D'AVAUX endeavoured to obtain the command of
Mountcashel's Brigade for Sarsfield, but was thwarted by
Tyrconnel's and De Rosen's influence over the king; Berwick was
sent to Newry to affront the north; on August 13th Ireland was
invaded; an English fleet sailed into Belfast Lough bringing twenty
thousand troops under the Duke of Schomberg.</p>

<p>Sarsfield fought his way through the press of officers, jobbers,
loungers, the idle, the self-interested, the curious who encumbered
the antechambers, into the presence of the viceroy.</p>

<p>Tyrconnel was, as usual, doing nothing; his restless inaction
showed him to be waiting on events; he did not wish to see
Sarsfield and his fine, flourishing, courtly manner hardly
disguised a jealous impatience.</p>

<p>"Will your grace give me something active to do?" demanded
Sarsfield. His courtesy was strained. Tyrconnel remembered that
this subordinate was better born than himself, more respected, in
everything a finer man.</p>

<p>He replied sourly:</p>

<p>"Before God, what is there for any one save swearing, roaring
and huzza-ing?&mdash;jobs I believe your followers are clever enough at,
Colonel Sarsfield."</p>

<p>"I have no followers."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have heard you make a party for yourself."</p>

<p>"I suppose we have all heard foolish fanatic tales of each
other, my lord duke. Why do you trouble your head with such
libels?"</p>

<p>Tyrconnel straddled in front of the fireplace. He was very grand
and imposing, as stately and dignified as King Louis himself, but
Sarsfield dwarfed him.</p>

<p>"Send me to Connaught, my lord. I will undertake to raise men
there on my own credit."</p>

<p>"That might be dangerous&mdash;a setting up of parties and
seditions."</p>

<p>"As long as I am in the king's service it were pitiful and
ridiculous in you, sir, to question my loyalty."</p>

<p>Tyrconnel's swollen eyes glanced at him sideways.</p>

<p>"Well, well, Colonel Sarsfield, power will make any man feel he
hath in him a wild ambition, not easy to bridle."</p>

<p>"I ask some active part. I hear you, sir, have refused Mons.
d'Avaux's request in my favour for Mountcashel's Brigade."</p>

<p>"Ay, he should not interfere, that embroils all; we are sweetly
mixed here, every man with his nose in t'other's poke."</p>

<p>"These are mere blustering vapours, there is work for those
who'll find the will for it. Schomberg hath taken Carrickfergus and
is advancing, but it seems as if every one in Dublin had forgotten
it."</p>

<p>"Berwick is at Newry to meet him."</p>

<p>"I was serving under Luxembourg when Berwick was in
petticoats&mdash;send me at least to reinforce him."</p>

<p>"I thought," remarked Tyrconnel with an unpleasant grin, "that
young Berwick hung over your head like a scourge."</p>

<p>Observing Sarsfield's stare, he dare pursue this theme no
further, but broke into the ranting, bullying air that so often
took the place of his fine manners.</p>

<p>"I don't fear the damned old rascal Schomberg, nor his raw yokel
army, he's got the accursed climate to consider as much as we have;
let him sink in a bog and rot to death."</p>

<p>"All this means, sir, that you wink at sloth, inaction,
incapacity?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied the viceroy, biting his forefinger, "it
certainly don't mean I wink at your intrigues with Harry
Luttrell."</p>

<p>"There are none, and you know it. Whatever I did 'twould be
open. I've no wits for intrigue."</p>

<p>"I wonder."</p>

<p>"You need not. I ask for some active post. I can't see all go to
the dogs and stay here mewed up in Dublin with swaggerers, jobbers
and speechmakers all railing like naughty boys against the
birch."</p>

<p>"Oh, ye can't, can't ye? I think ye're a little too broad,
Colonel Sarsfield."</p>

<p>"And I see your Grace means to put me off with a parcel of
uncivil words."</p>

<p>The viceroy's overworn countenance coloured deeply with wrath,
he freely used vile language which seemed to Sarsfield but a silly
piece of impertinence, and then declared:</p>

<p>"I have heard much to your disparagement and, as for Luttrell, I
take him to be little better than a subtle working traitor who
would rise behind you."</p>

<p>Sarsfield smiled; he thought: "How well we are all known one to
the other!" Aloud he said: "I am not the keeper of Harry Luttrell's
conscience. I like the man, no more."</p>

<p>"He is a double-damned, confounded dog," swore Tyrconnel. "I
have a packet of complaints of him from Sligo."</p>

<p>"Why, tell him so; he'll have an answer&mdash;but what of my
affair?"</p>

<p>"I can do nothing."</p>

<p>"Will you say so before the king?"</p>

<p>Tyrconnel gave Sarsfield a fiery glance, plucked at the curls of
his huge periwig and took up the challenge with dignity.</p>

<p>"Ay, I'll carry you to the king myself immediately."</p>

<p>James was closeted with Marshal de Rosen and D'Avaux, but
Tyrconnel broke in on them without ceremony.</p>

<p>The king seemed indifferent as to who was in his company; he was
sunk very low in his chair and appeared to be listening to none.
The Comte d'Avaux was in the window-place; he winced and shut his
lips tightly as Tyrconnel blustered into the cabinet, then turned
his head to stare out into the dull enclosed courtyard.</p>

<p>"He must be sick of Ireland, he does his duty very well,"
thought Sarsfield with sympathy.</p>

<p>"Sire," said Tyrconnel, "here is Colonel Patrick Sarsfield of
Lucan desiring some active post, and no excuse will avail to
silence him."</p>

<p>The king turned as if about to speak; but, swelling with rage,
Marshal de Rosen imposed silence on them all.</p>

<p>The Livonian, an angry man since landing at Kinsale, had been by
no means softened by the misery he had seen around him since he had
come to Ireland. He had always been of opinion that some of the
wonted severity that he had been allowed to employ in King Louis's
service would have reduced Derry, and he had been heard to declare
more than once that no terms should be offered the rebels but that
they should be obliged to surrender themselves with halters about
heir necks.</p>

<p>Standing forward now, with his hands on his hips, he addressed
the king, who looked at him with hostility, but appeared to lack
the spirit to answer, and when Sarsfield would have stepped forward
to say something, he motioned that officer into silence with a
gesture of his heavy, weary-looking hand.</p>

<p>"You," he declared, scowling towards Sarsfield, "with your
patrolling of Lough Erne know nothing of the real conditions of the
country&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've seen enough," muttered Sarsfield, and he half-turned his
back on Marshal de Rosen whom he considered a man no better than
Lord Galmoy. He had heard how the French general had ordered
gallows to be erected on the double bastion in sight of the enemy's
camp, and commanded all the prisoners to prepare for instant death.
In a word, Marshal de Rosen had treated the Protestants as what
Sarsfield could not regard them&mdash;malefactors, traitors and rebels.
He marvelled that the king should continue to listen to this man;
that D'Avaux, though he looked worried and anxious, made no
endeavour to stop him.</p>

<p>"I have heard all this before," remarked the king peevishly.</p>

<p>"I wonder then," said the Livonian, with a hot look, "Your
Majesty does not see that your orders are better attended, that
Irish officers, like Colonel Sarsfield here, do not stop their
vauntings and boastings of what they can do in the country."</p>

<p>"Sire," said Sarsfield, addressing the king, "I know not if
Marshal de Rosen needs to insult me, but Ireland being so
troublesome and embarrassed I take no heed of it."</p>

<p>The king replied:</p>

<p>"Let De Rosen speak, he knows my affairs better than any
man."</p>

<p>Scowling, grumbling and working himself up to a pitch of passion
near madness, De Rosen continued:</p>

<p>"Troops that were sent to me lately outside Derry were in the
worst possible condition, their arms damaged and broken and
accordingly useless, and in the whole army there was not a single
gunsmith to mend them."</p>

<p>"'Tis incredible," murmured Tyrconnel smoothly.</p>

<p>"Hamilton's troops were in as vile a plight," added De Rosen,
"entirely lost and ruined. The strongest battalion had but two
hundred men and more than two-thirds of them without belts, swords
or bandoliers."</p>

<p>"But was not your cavalry good enough?" asked the king drearily
and without much hope; he looked at Sarsfield.</p>

<p>"The cavalry and dragoons were not the better that they were the
more numerous," replied De Rosen with black sarcasm, "for of the
strongest company not more than twelve or fourteen troopers were
able to serve&mdash;all this I have set forth in my memorandum."</p>

<p>"The Duke of Berwick&mdash;my son Berwick&mdash;acquitted himself very
well," replied the king weakly.</p>

<p>"The detachment under the Duke of Berwick's command," replied De
Rosen scornfully, "being more than thirty miles from Derry weakened
us extremely. But, sire, useless to go over all this
embarrassment." The Livonian, however, could not hush his
grievances: he added: "There was but one road and that a bad
one...The guns could not be mounted for lack of carriages, and when
the regiments of Walter Butler came from Dublin without swords,
without powder and ball, I confess I was surprised."</p>

<p>"Tyrconnel should have seen to that," said the king, sneering
towards the viceroy.</p>

<p>"Recommend me not to my Lord Tyrconnel," replied De Rosen,
purpling even more deeply in the face; "when the money was sent
from Dublin under Bagnall's escort and they had not a single shot
between them, although the officers had begged for
ammunition&mdash;Hamilton, Lord Galmoy, Lord Galway can do nothing,
patriots though they be&mdash;and no others may effect anything when the
country is in such a condition."</p>

<p>Sarsfield replied quietly:</p>

<p>"But very much may be done with affairs even in the condition
Marshal de Rosen laments. For the very reason that he, used to
commanding disciplined and foreign troops, finds matters here
difficult, it is possible that a native officer may with more ease
achieve some success."</p>

<p>"I applaud that," said D'Avaux, fixing his bright yet tired eyes
on the king.</p>

<p>But James, with that peevish, obstinate sticking to one point or
repetition of one fact which often distinguishes the weak and
ill-tempered man, replied:</p>

<p>"Colonel Sarsfield's patrol was defeated at Lough Erne&mdash;Colonel
Sarsfield fell back after Newton-Butler&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>!" cried D'Avaux. "Any man would have been
defeated at Lough Erne. Many officers have reported to me that they
frequently asked for arms without being able to obtain any."</p>

<p>De Rosen continued, his grievances seemed to rise up and break
from him without his own volition:</p>

<p>"The garrison of Belturbet is in the same situation, having, as
Sutherland told me, but little powder and not a single ball. My
heart bleeds, sir," added the ferocious Livonian, "when I reflect
on the continuation of this negligence, for it appears to me that
no one is in any pain about the ruin of your affairs and," he added
with a biting sarcasm, "with very profound respect, submission and
loyalty, sire, I ask Your Majesty how it may be supposed that a few
officers, native Irish like Colonel Sarsfield, though they may have
a far higher spirit than we have reckoned on, can do anything at
this juncture?"</p>

<p>The king glared at D'Avaux. He appeared to ignore both De Rosen
and Sarsfield, and suddenly fixed an exasperated malice on the
diplomat; the early dislike between the two men had developed
almost to hatred.</p>

<p>Whatever James might do openly to oblige D'Avaux out of fear of
his master, because he was the source of all financial supplies,
secretly he turned towards Melfort, the subtle Scotchman.</p>

<p>The king, too, had lately discovered that D'Avaux had had with
him, when he landed at Kinsale last March, double the amount of
money to which he had confessed; one portion had been secretly
retained for an emergency; James had been intensely irritated at
this slur on his prudence, still more by D'Avaux's answer, when he
had charged him with keeping back some of the money, that Lord
Melfort, who had the handling of the king's finances, was not to be
trusted; at the end of the wrangle D'Avaux had said dryly: "I may
tell Your Majesty that now all is spent, both what I had to display
openly and my secret reserve."</p>

<p>This grievance returned now to the slow and obstinate mind of
the king and he said:</p>

<p>"Instead of listening with what seems to me relish to the
account by Marshal de Rosen of the disasters and ill-discipline
which have dogged my troops in the field, you might consider how it
is that my policies at Dublin have caused this dismal state of
affairs. How can my cavalry be anything but inferior, my infantry
but little better than half-armed and half-drilled rapparees, my
laws and edicts anything but disregarded everywhere when I have no
means? What king can do anything with little money and scant
credit? The brass tokens I was obliged to issue put us all in a
confusion, and the guinea fetches three pounds ten in this
coinage."</p>

<p>"That was last June," smiled D'Avaux dryly, "at present it is at
least five pounds. We have issued a million of this brass money and
it will probably be necessary to issue at least another
half-million to carry us over the winter."</p>

<p>"Brass itself is growing scarce," scowled De Rosen, "and I have
already been asked to forego the great gun in the castle yard in
order that it may be melted down and coined."</p>

<p>"I have written here with my own hand to His Most Christian
Majesty about this scarcity of money and even of brass," said James
sourly.</p>

<p>"If His Majesty can do nothing else," smiled D'Avaux, "he may,
sire, send you a few ancient guns."</p>

<p>He turned into the room. He had an air of fortitude, yet of
great fatigue as of a man weary to the bone.</p>

<p>"We lose time and temper in these recriminations," he added. "We
all know the state of Your Majesty's affairs, the despair and
desolation of the country, the ill-equipment of the troops, the
disorganisation of the civilian population&mdash;"</p>

<p>The king stopped him impatiently:</p>

<p>"But what we do not know is how far His Most Christian Majesty
intends to help us."</p>

<p>Sarsfield's sympathies were with the king; for what was he but a
most unfortunate man who had been made the puppet for the devices
and ambitions of other princes?</p>

<p>As Sarsfield eyed the two Frenchmen he said with some sternness
and some tone of authority:</p>

<p>"Mons. d'Avaux, certainly it would be for the good of the cause
if we could have some assurance as to the help we may be likely to
expect from His Most Christian Majesty."</p>

<p>D'Avaux replied:</p>

<p>"You speak boldly, Colonel Sarsfield, and I think none the less
of you for it. His Majesty will send you succour in due
course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Words, words, as usual," replied Sarsfield. And King James, who
was never burdened with much sense of gratitude, sneered:</p>

<p>"We do not want a handful of officers to drill recruits and a
few damaged guns to turn into coins, but a large well-disciplined
army, fit to meet the army which has been sent from England."</p>

<p>D'Avaux stroked his chin and did not reply at once. He knew what
was not perfectly clear even to De Rosen, that it was not part of
the policy of King Louis and his minister, Louvois, to send large
supplies of either men, money or material to Ireland; their object
was to prolong the struggle there, not to gain any sensational
victory, but to distract the English Government and draw away from
Flanders and the other seats of war the troops of the Prince of
Orange and the other Allies. He knew from his despatches sent from
Louvois that already the Emperor was telling the usurping King of
England that the trouble in Ireland must be settled before the war
could be pursued with fitting fervour on the other front, and that
the other Allies, the German princes, the King of Spain, were even
hinting&mdash;and rather broadly hinting&mdash;that they might be induced to
make a separate peace unless this running sore of Ireland could be
healed. For it was clear to them that the usurping king could not
maintain his new government with this fester in his side. D'Avaux
said nothing of this, but fell back on the smooth, well-worn
language of diplomacy and soothed the king as well as he could with
vague and dubious promises and encouragements for the future.</p>

<p>To these General de Rosen listened with ill-concealed ferocity;
he longed to say that he hoped if this game in Ireland was to
continue for long he might be recalled; he considered his task a
hopeless one. It was all very well talking about native recruits,
but he considered Ireland a nation impossible to deal with. When he
had looked at so-called regiments, newly-raised by the French
officers, he had remarked with bitter sarcasm: "There is nothing
uniform about them but their rags."</p>

<p>Suavely and pleasantly D'Avaux came round to what had been
uppermost in his mind since the entrance of Tyrconnel and
Sarsfield; the employment of the latter in some important command.
He again urged the king to send this officer to Connaught, infested
by the enemy, and employ him to hold Sligo, the key to those parts
of Ireland.</p>

<p>"Else, sir," he added, "a Protestant army will be well into the
centre of the island, whereas, with Sarsfield at Sligo&mdash;"</p>

<p>The king suddenly rose.</p>

<p>"No doubt," he said, "with Colonel Sarsfield at Sligo we shall
be safe enough."</p>

<p>Sarsfield did not know if this were meant for an expression of
confidence or for sarcasm; but he recalled the moment when James
Stewart had pressed the little relic into his hand.</p>

<p>"I think I could do it, sire," he said. "I will take my own
troop of dragoons and possibly those of Mountcashel and see what
men I can raise, and arm on my own credit and persuasion. It is
true there are those, even among these so-called rapparees, who
will follow and serve, and serve with loyalty one of Irish birth
and name."</p>

<p>"You've a hard task," sneered De Rosen insultingly. "My God! to
hold Connaught with a rabble of cattle thieves."</p>

<p>"I know," replied Sarsfield, "I came to Ireland prepared for a
hard task and found one harder than I anticipated&mdash;that of waiting
and doing nothing, Marshal de Rosen."</p>

<p>"And Berwick&mdash;what is Berwick to do?" asked the king, jealous of
his young son's credit. "Berwick stays idle at Newry."</p>

<p>D'Avaux replied glibly:</p>

<p>"Marshal de Rosen, if my advice had to be followed I would say
that the Duke of Berwick had better keep his headquarters at Newry,
and that His Majesty should join him there, setting up the royal
standard to hearten the rest."</p>

<p>"Am I to leave Dublin again?" exclaimed the unfortunate king,
dismayed. "'Tis bad enough here with the discomforts and the
miseries. But these camps and headquarters...I am not a young man,
Mons. d'Avaux, to fall into these broils."</p>

<p>"All shall be made as smooth as possible for Your Majesty,"
replied D'Avaux, gentle but implacable. "Yet I do consider it
necessary that Your Majesty should be seen with the army."</p>

<p>De Rosen, who loathed the king as representing everything
detestable to his nature, was thankful that James was not appointed
to be with his contingent. He made a brief salute and left the
chamber, bearing himself as if he was master of all. Tyrconnel
swung after him.</p>

<p>The king looked at Sarsfield.</p>

<p>"You have your wish, Colonel Sarsfield," he said with dignity.
"You shall go to Connaught. You shall raise men on your own credit.
You see how I am beset."</p>

<p>"I ask nothing, sire, but what you have given me. I do undertake
to defend Connaught."</p>

<p>"I trust you," replied James. "And I am a prince whose trust
hath often been betrayed."</p>

<p>He was not a man of much intelligence, but Sarsfield felt that
there were some truths he understood very well; no doubt he, too,
had heard (what every one seemed to have heard) of the intrigues of
Henry Luttrell.</p>

<p>"Even my own children," added the king; he suddenly spoke, out
of the confusion of his faults and misfortunes, with exact clarity.
"Loyalty is worth while, Colonel Sarsfield. I have found that even
in much misery&mdash;loyalty to God."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sarsfield gravely.</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other directly; it was a moment of
complete comprehension; each saw clearly into the soul of the
other.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir." The king bent his head as if accepting a gift;
all his peevish ingratitude, his querulous impatience had left him.
"'Tis worth while," he repeated.</p>

<p>He turned away, his tall stooping figure blocked the light, his
trembling fingers fumbled with a little crucifix enclosing a
portion of the True Cross, that hung under the laces on his bosom.
He left the closet.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-18" id="ch1-18"></a>EIGHTEEN</h2>

<p class="first">
SARSFIELD stood silent; his fancy was far away, D'Avaux was
regarding him keenly.</p>

<p>Sarsfield's mind was busy with that other Ireland; not the
country which these foreigners had been discussing, the starved
ragged troops, the ill-organised, crowded, foul cities, the jobbing
and the intriguing; but the Ireland of the gray-green rivers and
the silver-bosomed lakes, of the purple azure mountains and the
emerald green swards. He thought of the wet wind, the racing waves
on the long rocky shores, the cry of the cormorants and the gulls,
and a gray ruined chapel and cloisters; the beautiful outline of
gigantic crosses in lonely places, the purple dun stretches of the
swamps, the pale bog lilies floating on dark, distant and solitary
pools. This secret, real Ireland, of the soil, of the elements, of
the old faiths and virtues, of the unseen magic people, combined in
one personality, that of the girl he had left under the charge of
Madame de Bonnac; a fair, lonely creature who belonged to no one
and therefore to all, who had seemed of another race seated in the
fashionable room between the spinning-wheel and the loosened rich
flowers, in her resigned ruin, in her unsurprised bewilderment. His
poignant longing for the lonely gray places and the companionship
of that girl, for the old days when he had walked from the mansion
of the MacCarthys under the arbutus trees, with the long grasses
and the wet mosses beneath his feet, and in the distance the lake
slipping in between the hills with gleams of radiant colour, so
obsessed him that he believed he was alone. His poignant vision of
Ireland and Ishma as one entity seemed to be connected with the
king's words, the king's trust; Ireland had been often betrayed,
even by her own children, as had James Stewart; he could not help
her by playing the traitor to the king; "loyalty is worth while,"
the old man had said; despite his own looseness and weakness he
knew that. Out of treachery, out of intrigues with Harry Luttrell,
with Olivia de Bonnac, nothing noble could come. "Obey your
conscience," the shabby, cheerful old priest on the sacred island
of Lough Erne had advised, and nothing but rectitude would satisfy
the conscience of Patrick Sarsfield. And it seemed curious that the
king, of all men, alone knew this. D'Avaux began to speak,
Sarsfield started and looked at him stupidly. The Frenchman said
dryly:</p>

<p>"I believe, Colonel Sarsfield, that I have gotten you this
command. You are willing to go immediately to Connaught? 'Tis hard
for you as you have but a new-made wife whom you have been forced
to leave already."</p>

<p>"My wife and I understand each other," replied Sarsfield, with
an effort bringing himself back to sad reality. "She has her
relatives and her brother coming and going." And in his heart he
added: "She has her thoughts of Berwick and no doubt will see much
of him, as his father will contrive that he often visits
Dublin."</p>

<p>"You will need to concern yourself no more about the matter,"
said D'Avaux, "it is certain you have the command; irregular as it
may be," he added acidly. "But all our organisation is irregular.
You will take, at least while he is a prisoner, Lord Mountcashel's
troop and your own, and you will raise as many more men as you can,
and you will endeavour to hold Sligo and Connaught against the
Protestants. You will keep in communication with the Duke of
Berwick at Newry. You see, I am giving you your orders, I dare say
you will take them better than from Marshal de Rosen." He was
silent for a second, keenly observing Sarsfield, then added: "And I
dare say you will not take them from either of us much longer,
Colonel Sarsfield. I will not conceal from you that it will be
almost impossible for me to continue long in my post, I cannot lend
myself to the humours of King James nor adapt myself to a man so
various, so uncertain, and in every way"&mdash;the Frenchman pursed his
lips&mdash;"so inefficient and unfortunate."</p>

<p>"Unfortunate," repeated Sarsfield, "and an old, ailing man."</p>

<p>D'Avaux said no more of King James; in taking leave of Sarsfield
he felt he was taking leave of all that was best in Ireland, of all
at least that he could understand in Ireland.</p>

<p>With the desire to give some comfort to a man left with what he
felt to be an impossible task, he added:</p>

<p>"Believe me, Colonel Sarsfield&mdash;and here I speak with
authority&mdash;that whatever you may hear or think for yourself, it is
not King Louis's intention to abandon Ireland, although he has had
some advice in that direction."</p>

<p>"From Tyrconnel?" asked Sarsfield quickly.</p>

<p>"You may be assured," said D'Avaux dryly, "that I have my eye on
my Lord Tyrconnel. I trust neither him nor Melfort, nor indeed any
man save yourself."</p>

<p>This compliment made Sarsfield wince; he felt it no honour to be
the only honest man in a company of rogues.</p>

<p>"One thing more," D'Avaux spoke earnestly, "of all whom I
mistrust Colonel Luttrell comes first."</p>

<p>"Is every one to warn me of Harry Luttrell?" asked Sarsfield
indifferently. "For my part, though he may brag and intrigue I do
not think him capable of active harm, and his services are very
valuable in Sligo."</p>

<p>"I hold him," insisted D'Avaux, "to be a dangerous man."</p>

<p>"Not to me," said Sarsfield, and thought he spoke the truth.</p>

<p>There remained then the evening and Honor; he had got the post,
the difficult, perilous post for which he had striven and hardly
hoped, but the triumph was damped by a subtle sadness, by the
thought of the three women with whom he was involved, and by
certain drowsy dreams that would not be banished; in these moods,
when his melancholy was on him, he wondered, with self-contempt, if
he really was a man of action.</p>

<p>He looked back at the castle, the Irish flag hung heavily in the
hazy summer air; it was impossible to read Tyrconnel's boasting
motto: "Now or Never, Now and Forever."</p>

<p>Sarsfield went direct to his wife and told her of his
appointment, and asked if she would come with him to Connaught. But
Honor shrugged her pretty shoulders.</p>

<p>"Am I to be left again? Is this war never coming to an end? Why
should they choose you of all men to go to Connaught? 'Tis known to
be a barbarous place."</p>

<p>He ignored her childish complaints and stroked the little hand
which lay in his, not unwillingly, he thought, despite her
temper.</p>

<p>"Did I not ask you to come with me, Honor, that you might not be
left alone?"</p>

<p>"But it will be rough in Connaught, worse than it is here. I
shall have no conveniences or privacies. There will be few other
women there and those few hateful."</p>

<p>"Well then, Honor, if you are nice and dainty you must stay in
Dublin, and in that case I am forced to tell you that you must be
careful with your expenses, for I shall have little assistance in
this work I do, and have undertaken to raise what men I can at my
own credit."</p>

<p>"And I am to go short for that?" she exclaimed
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I did not say short, Honor. This is a time of war, there is no
need for Parisian luxury, nor to have two maids where one will do;
nor to spend on toys what is needed for necessities."</p>

<p>"You call your troop a necessity?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I call the defence and protection of Ireland a necessity,
Honor."</p>

<p>She saw that she had vexed him and was silent, but she had not
given in graciously and he was minded to add:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If my Lord Berwick comes to and fro Dublin, and he may have
that indulgence being the King's son, I beg of you, Honor, for you
own sake, to see but little of him, even in company, even at a
music-making or a card-playing avoid him."</p>

<p>"In sooth," said she, biting her pretty underlip, "I see a dull
season ahead of me."</p>

<p>"It will be such a season as all other women must endure. Do not
reproach me, Honor; I thought we had straightened affairs between
us and at least I may console myself that your estate is not worse
because of your marriage to me."</p>

<p>"I will do my best," she faltered with a childish air, "but
loneliness and economy&mdash;"</p>

<p>He would have reminded her that she should have been used to
economy, since she had spent her girlhood strictly in a convent,
and when she had come into the world the family fortunes had been
already ruined; but he endeavoured to soothe and caress her, though
with an absent heart.</p>

<p>"You will have your friends and your toys and games within
reason, Honor; I would not be harsh, and if it were not for the
war, why, you should have all my fortune without question. I am not
one for preaching, but you must have, being a woman and so young, a
tender heart, and do you but think of the misery that is abroad
now, and of the ladies of gentle birth brought to a state that I
would not even have you guess at, and enduring humiliations and
privations I would not have you even know of. Take a little comfort
that you are not so ill-entreated, my Honor."</p>

<p>She did not answer but sat meekly, leaving her hand in his, and
his eyes dwelt on her kindly; how pretty she was, how smooth and
precise, with what care she had arranged her toilet, how fragrant
and elegant was her whole appearance; yet how completely
indifferent she left him!</p>

<p>"You will want to say good-bye to Madame de Bonnac, I suppose
she remains in Dublin too."</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall say good-bye to her, Honor."</p>

<p>"That girl?"</p>

<p>"I shall provide for her also."</p>

<p>Sarsfield hesitated, he half-thought of endeavouring once more
to persuade Honor to the gentleness and kindness which he, in his
masculine simplicity, felt must be inherent in one so young and so
soft-looking. He thought that if he could leave Ishma as companion
to Honor his mind would be at rest, his heart at ease, and he would
be able, whatever toil and difficulty, alarm and peril awaited him,
to think of the two girls together in loving friendliness, one
helping the other in sweet companionship.</p>

<p>Then he despised this as sentimentality, as weakness, and some
fierce, secret pride in him revolted at the thought of Ishma being
his wife's companion, and he decided even in that moment that he
would take her away to his estates at Lucan and lodge her there
with one of his tenants in placid secrecy, in some place where she
might live as she wished to live, with the dog, Brian, and a priest
at hand, the wide-open country and gentle solitude. She would like
Lucan, he thought, the great avenues and the wide park, the lake
and all that was his. She could live there in some cottage without
scandal or affront to any, without curiosity, without questioning
from either his wife or Madame de Bonnac. So he said no more to
Honor about Ishma O'Donaghoe and she did not question him, but her
manner was unsatisfied; and he knew, little wise as he was in
affairs of love, that there must be this deep discontent between
them until some real affection grew, so false was their
position.</p>

<p>He was leaving her in a kind but formal fashion when she called
him back; there was fear, almost panic in her voice. Returning
slowly to where she sat, he reminded himself that he was her
husband.</p>

<p>"Don't leave me so," she whispered.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-19" id="ch1-19"></a>NINETEEN</h2>

<p class="first">
WHEN the tall man, magnificent in his military equipment,
cunningly designed for parade and pomp, was standing close to her
chair, waiting for her to speak, Honor's nervously wrought up
courage sank.</p>

<p>"I spoke on a foolish impulse," she whispered. "Have no heed,
trouble with me no more."</p>

<p>"A generous impulse, I'll go warrant, Honor, and woe befall the
heart that has none such, better be wrong with a warm folly than be
ever right with a cold calculation."</p>

<p>She did not answer and, eager to comfort her, he continued:</p>

<p>"It is a fine pride to feel you can trust some one, Honor."</p>

<p>"Can you trust me, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can." He thought of himself and the king.</p>

<p>"I trust you, though I know nothing of you save that you care
not at all for me. Can we," she added timidly, "do anything with
those dry loyalties? I am much your inferior in everything."</p>

<p>"That makes a rank fool of me, Honor. We must treasure any spark
of loyalty."</p>

<p>"'Tis all," she whispered looking down, "so horrid strange&mdash;like
a raving in dreams, when all should be orderly and agreeable, my
own short life seems to me already incredible."</p>

<p>"Were we, any of us, dear heart, to confess to our real
adventures of mind and soul, 'twould make odd, oft fearful reading.
'Tis why so much must be glossed over with feints and
ceremonies&mdash;our poor defences, Honor. But let us not make all
fruitless between us."</p>

<p>She looked up at him, her dignity and her calm largely
recovered.</p>

<p>"You know, lately I have got much comfort out of old tales, and
your speech minded me of them. My mother used to tell me about the
unseen people, how they were everywhere and sometimes became
visible to mortal eyes&mdash;how they loved music and noble deeds, the
open hand, the generous heart&mdash;" She smiled at her own memories
which already seemed of events and speeches very far away. "We were
never allowed to put out the embers or lock up the food and the
maidens had to leave milk in the jugs and the doors ajar, and now
and then a new baked cake on the threshold, and indeed we all felt
a sweet blessing on the house. But in the convent we were taught
differently."</p>

<p>"Yet 'tis all the same," said Sarsfield, consoled that they had
this bond in common; they were both Irish, fed on the same
traditions, the same faiths. "Such, too, are my early
recollections, difficult to speak of, heartening to muse
over&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I believe in all of it," sighed Honor, shielding her face with
her hand. "And all was easy then&mdash;lately I have been at a plunge
and all flies in my face."</p>

<p>"We must overbear our disillusions, Honor, not be drudge to our
own disappointments."</p>

<p>"You remember, sir, the ban-sidhe, who gave warning of death;
methought I heard her once, wailing high in a budding ash tree
before my mother died, and to comfort me they talked of the
leanan-sidhe, the spirit of life, how beautiful and serene she was,
and so different from mortal men; some said she was Ireland
herself, lonely and patient, after many miseries."</p>

<p>Sarsfield did not answer, and Honor added shyly:</p>

<p>"That girl from Cork made me think of the leanan-sidhe."</p>

<p>"Why did you turn her away, Honor?"</p>

<p>"I cannot answer that."</p>

<p>Fearful lest she should again fall into her deep reserve he
snatched at her hand, then went on his knee beside her chair.</p>

<p>"Come with me to Connaught, Honor, be my wife in true earnest.
Honor, I am somewhat serious, we may not pretend at happiness, but
maybe we shall come on something of greater value."</p>

<p>She sat taut, thinking, he knew, of Berwick; touched by despair
Sarsfield added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am much alone, Honor. I, too, have had my bouts with fortune
and have been deceived by trumpery."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know&mdash;Olivia de Bonnac," said Honor. "I have seen how you
have turned from her&mdash;at last. And she has seen also."</p>

<p>Sarsfield could not forbear a smile at this young girl's
shrewdness even as he replied:</p>

<p>"I did not think of that."</p>

<p>Honor rose impetuously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am tormented most pitifully!"</p>

<p>She could not escape, he held her, seeking his own release as
much as hers; a gallant defiance of misery was heart-rending in one
so young, so feeble, so inexperienced.</p>

<p>She stood still against him for a while, then put out her
fingers and, like a child recovering from exhausting sobs, played
in an absorbed fashion with the long braided tassels that fell from
his epaulettes.</p>

<p>He believed that with care and patience he might win her; he
believed she was worth winning, he promised himself, if he should
survive the war, if fortune should be kind, an honourable life with
her at Lucan...</p>

<p>As if she very well knew his thoughts she whispered:</p>

<p>"I'll help. You shall have no complaints of me. I am very tired
and afraid, stay with me to-night&mdash;only to-night. I'll not come to
Connaught to plague you."</p>

<p>He had hardly thought, the strait he was in, that it had been so
much comfort to hold her in his arms, to feel her warm, soft,
gentle, needing him; he too was tired and, though not afraid, grave
with many expectations of tragedy. She prayed that night, aloud and
childishly, in the gaudy little oratory she had fitted up so
dutifully, and when he came into her bed-chamber he saw that she
had been weeping; but she turned to him with relief. He did not
feel, as he had felt on their bridal night, that he intruded, that
he was hateful to her; in the fine tester bed, in the shade of the
curtains with gold lilies, she looked, in her thin smock, candid,
childish, sincere; he vowed to himself that whatever ambuscade
might be in wait for his soul, he would never hurt or forsake
Honor.</p>

<p>"You want me to stay, Honor, this it not a patch'd up
peace?"</p>

<p>"I would be an honest wife," said Honor, sunk in the pillows
with her eyes closed.</p>

<p>Her submissive youth, her pure prettiness, his pity helped them
to forget that they were strangers who knew no passion for each
other.</p>

<p>But when Patrick Sarsfield woke suddenly and found the early
dawn light between the curtains he thought it was the hum of a
spinning-wheel which had aroused him, and that his spirit had come
from very far away, from some rain-blown solitude where a bog lily
floated on darkness.</p>

<p>He looked at Honor lying in slumber beside him. He had heard
her, between sleeping and waking, murmur, a few hours before,
another name than his own; her defencelessness, her childish aspect
greatly moved him; she seemed to be again rapt in a secret
isolation, the shy, horrible solitude of the very young who are
alone, frightened and proud. He let the first sunshine into the
room, folded the coverlet close about her and left her for the work
waiting in his own cabinet; he had got his responsible post;
Connaught was his to defend.</p>

<p>Honor did not wake till she heard high voices in the narrow
streets; one of these voices she knew; she was quickly in her
bed-gown, quickly at the window, peeping between the curtains.</p>

<p>Olivia de Bonnac was below, even at this early hour she was
carefully rich as if she had been long closeted with her tire
maids...such provoking summer gauzes, such glittering flower-sewn
silks, such dyed curled feathers, an air so radiant, good-humoured
and indifferent!</p>

<p>Honor shivered as if she was naked in a great cold; odd that she
should have slept so heavily. She stared at herself in the mirror
with the fine apple and acanthus frame; odd that she should look
the same as she had looked yesterday...now she was really his wife,
but they each moved in separate worlds in whatever kind desperation
their bodies might embrace; she felt wounded as a broken flower,
plucked by one who has no value for what he has in duty taken.</p>

<p>But when her husband came into the room she was smiling
valiantly above the French brocade which protected her
childishness.</p>

<p>"That was Madame de Bonnac, Honor; you heard some ado? She has
brought another gentlewoman."</p>

<p>"She always had a cunning decorum."</p>

<p>"Will you see her, Honor?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I must."</p>

<p>"It is about&mdash;that girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at least I must make it so. That affair must be settled
before I go to Connaught."</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"And Madame de Bonnac&mdash;"</p>

<p>Honor turned away murmuring so that he could not catch the sense
of what she said.</p>

<p>"It is not of Madame de Bonnac I should be afraid."</p>

<p>The Frenchwoman was easily at home in Honor's precise parlour;
the other lady, with mischievous glances, had gone on up the street
in her painted chair&mdash;to early mass, she said...Olivia de Bonnac
appeared to know everything (even some secrets she could not
possibly have come by); with this exasperating air of completely
understanding him and his affairs she greeted Sarsfield.</p>

<p>Her husband, she said, must stay in Dublin with De Rosen, tied
to the capital; she had come to take leave of the Lady Honor&mdash;"and
yourself, Colonel Sarsfield."</p>

<p>"My wife will not go to Connaught."</p>

<p>"Then I must sometimes lend her my poor company."</p>

<p>Her beautiful eyes <i>(fleur de la tête</i>, as Sarsfield had
heard the French call them) were full of a light mockery. She asked
him, if he would sometimes have leave, and he replied, "yes, he
supposed so."</p>

<p>Their interview was most formal until he spoke to her about the
Irish girl still in her care.</p>

<p>When she heard of his plan of taking Ishma to one of his tenants
on his estates at Lucan she fell into a temper and with fast
violence struck one hand on the other, and asked him if he did not
"consider her fit to be at the charge of looking after his
protegée?"</p>

<p>This was a betrayal of that coarseness or commonness which
smirched all Madame de Bonnac's charm for Sarsfield and made it
easy for him to deal with her enticing allure.</p>

<p>"You put the matter on too common a level," he replied. "I do
what I do for honourable reasons and so you should take them."</p>

<p>"But I have a liking for the creature, she amuses me, we have
become good friends; I take her out into company, I am civilising
her." As she spoke Sarsfield remembered the words of the little
abbé. A malicious, a stupid warning, no doubt, but he could not
altogether ignore what had been so deliberately spoken.</p>

<p>"Ishma is not a creature to be civilised, I will take her away,
Madame de Bonnac."</p>

<p>"Ah, so formal!" she cried. "I shall begin to think that it is
she and not your wife who is my rival."</p>

<p>"Our affection is not such that you should talk of a rival. And
this is Honor's house, and she above stairs while we talk. No more,
for common charity."</p>

<p>But, either from deliberate malice or common weakness, she
said:</p>

<p>"You loved me once."</p>

<p>"And the echo of that love has long been in my heart," he
replied, "and is there still, but it may not be dragged down to
colour cruelty and malice. The world is close to us, we must tread
our peculiar ways, Olivia. And I have certain duties to which I do
mean to be faithful."</p>

<p>"That is grandly spoken," replied she in a temper, "and I hope I
shall not hear that you have made this pretty peasant your
mistress."</p>

<p>"I wish you had not said that. It shows you know so very little,
that you must speak from tricks or idleness, having seen this
gentlewoman."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have known smooth faces before kept candid to give a
colour to what must be outbrazened; the creature has a coarse
rustic comeliness, as others have remarked, I have no warranty that
your taste does not lie that way; plain dealing is a jewel, if you
find this miss a shrewd temptation it were wiser you told me
so."</p>

<p>This scarcely touched Sarsfield, save that it told him Ishma
must instantly leave Dublin and no one know where she was
hidden.</p>

<p>"We can have no descants on this matter, madame, my decision is
steady; and, as I would avoid all umbrage of offence, why, it were
better we spoke no more."</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac rose, very handsome and sumptuous.</p>

<p>"Consider me not at all," she said, "we may meet again and in
another mood."</p>

<p>She was gone; almost he could persuade himself she was not in a
transport of fury, so cleverly could she bear herself.</p>

<p>He returned to his wife; she was lying on her bed again as if
she had no heart to begin the day.</p>

<p>"Madame de Bonnac has gone."</p>

<p>"It matters so little&mdash;Madame de Bonnac."</p>

<p>Sarsfield could see, through the open door of the closet, his war
equipment, his polished pistol, his sword, lying ready. He looked
down at his wife, stretched prone with a wave of dark hair across her
smooth brow, and thought how bitterly poignant was this leave-taking
between two who did not love each other, but were bound together by
invisible and spoken loyalties. She had clung to him, she had wept
on his shoulder, and he had felt how frail and delicate she was; her
brother had told him that her health was not strong; she had all that
was necessary to appeal to his chivalry and his pity, and he detested
himself that he remained so cold towards her. He could, however, admire
her; she was not capable of flinging at him the words that Madame de
Bonnac had tossed like an insolent gesture in his face: "I hope I shall
not hear you have made the Irish girl your mistress."</p>

<p>As he saw the expression on her face, fatigue and weariness
overshadowing extreme youth, he wished that he had left her the
little miniature of Berwick, and that Berwick had been another kind
of man and had married her despite her poverty and the uncertainty
of their fortunes. "So it had gone differently for me and for
her."</p>

<p>He roused her to say farewell; he could not tell when he might
return from Connaught; all affairs, both of war and state, were in
a turmoil of uncertainty.</p>

<p>Honor sat up on the large bed; she looked pale against the heavy
darkness of the curtains which made a cavern of shadow behind her
white figure. She pulled the over-rich bed-gown about her, her chin
quivered a little, and her hands clasped on her slight bosom; he
heard from her pale lips the familiar rhythm of prayer.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield went on his knees on the bed-step, clasped his
hands and bowed his head, and prayed as he had been taught to pray
since he was a little child&mdash;for himself, for her, for Ireland, and
that God in His graciousness would permit them all to keep their
integrity.</p>

<p>Her fingers timidly stroked the thick curls on his bent head.
"My husband," she sighed wistfully.</p>

<p>And he was touched, and yet wondered if she were not imagining
another man in his place.</p>

<p>When he rose from his knees she gave him her hand and said
piteously: "I will remember what you said about the extravagance."
And at that he could do no more than reply impetuously:</p>

<p>"Have what you will, I can deny you nothing, Honor. Some way I
will provide for my troop. I do not need, my child," he added
tenderly, "to stint you in anything, and I shall deal more in faith
and loyalties than in money." He stooped to kiss her, and it seemed
to him, in the summer light which was to him without colour or
radiance, that she had already lost her bloom. Fine lines like
little scars were between her brows and at the corners of her lips,
her eyes had faint violet stains beneath them, the extreme
freshness of her youth was already gone.</p>

<p>"One little matter, Honor. You spoke of Colonel Luttrell, he is
very busy with intrigue. I think him honest enough but restless,
full of fantastical whimsies. But I&mdash;I must be loyal to the king. I
have thought on't and prayed on't&mdash;not even for Ireland&mdash;no use
that way. So, should Luttrell get to Dublin and I not near, you'll
give his rash talk no countenance."</p>

<p>She had listened gravely; he had expected some flare of vanity,
of ambition, of peevishness, but there was none of this. Looking at
him intently, like a child who makes a promise, she said
earnestly:</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>She wished him good fortune, but did not ask him why he had
departed so early though she must have known well enough that his
troop did not leave Dublin until the afternoon. Without demur, or
reproach, or regret, or more than a loyal goodwill she let him
go...</p>

<p>Sarsfield closed the door between her chamber and the closet;
while he was putting on his uniform and appointments he heard her
lonely sobbing, but he did not return to her, he had no comfort to
offer beyond what he had already given, and to see her again was
but to renew a pain; he had nothing more to offer Honor.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-20" id="ch1-20"></a>TWENTY</h2>

<p class="first">
PATRICK SARSFIELD left the castle thus early because he had to
escort Ishma to his estates of Lucan before departing for
Connaught. It was Henry Luttrell who had arranged this embarrassing
affair. Luttrell, with all his cynicism, his mocking ways,
uncertain moods and unscrupulous schemes, was possessed of a
fastidious fineness and an exquisite tact which made him rarely
useful on such an occasion. At Sligo Sarsfield had told him of the
girl who had come to Dublin seeking him; by chance (he did not know
how the words had slipped out) he had mentioned at the castle his
vexation that she should have been seen and admired by the
dissolute gallants of Dublin, particularly by Piers Butler, Lord
Galmoy. Henry Luttrell had sympathised with a delicate appreciation
of the situation at which it was impossible for Sarsfield,
sensitive as he was on this matter, to take any offence. He had
himself seen the girl in Madame de Bonnac's salon and declared that
she looked "like a windflower among a bouquet of tuberoses, a
creature whom a vitiated air or a too-closely perfumed atmosphere
would blast," and he agreed with Sarsfield that it was wise she
should go to Lucan until affairs were more certain.</p>

<p>He listened with respect to the disjointed account Sarsfield,
encouraged by this sympathy, gave of the poor girl's simple, sad
story.</p>

<p>Luttrell, himself Irish, found nothing strange in the
circumstances, in the legends, in the landscape, which had given
birth to Ishma O'Donaghoe. When Sarsfield had told him that he
wished to remove the girl from the French woman's care, and this
for many subtle, unexplained reasons, Luttrell, who had a wide
acquaintance with all manner of people, proposed at once an old
sempstress who had been his nurse, and who at present did his
lace-making, embroidering and fine mending. This woman, who had
been a portress at the Convent of Poor Clares in France, had come
to Dublin with King James and his troops, and was now installed in
decent apartments in the city.</p>

<p>Sarsfield was grateful to be able to put Ishma in this good
creature's care. Her name was Brighita Begg. She was a large dwarf,
rugged and clean, pious and precise; she seemed to have a deep
devotion for Henry Luttrell.</p>

<p>Ishma accepted these changes in her fortunes without
apprehension or excitement. She seemed to rely on Sarsfield as if
it were the most natural thing in the world for her to do so.</p>

<p>He recalled, with a pang, the gesture, at once simple and noble,
with which she had taken from her own wrist a double-knotted
bracelet of fine gold, plaited, perhaps, a thousand years ago, and
given it to Madame de Bonnac with graceful words of gratitude for
her hospitality. There had been something that hurt him in this,
the juxtaposition of the two women&mdash;the Irish girl's stately
simplicity and the mockery in the fine light eyes of the
Frenchwoman as she had taken the bracelet with careless courtesy
and shot at him a glance of malice.</p>

<p>Many other of Ishma's ornaments he had himself sold in Dublin;
he would passionately have liked to pay her expenses from his own
means, but a fastidious loyalty to her own wishes forbade him to do
this. He safeguarded her independence as carefully as she could
have done herself, and the ornaments, in a city where gold was so
scarce and daily becoming scarcer, fetched a high price. Ishma had
sufficient good English guineas to keep her for many months in the
modest fashion in which she lived. It was, perhaps, unnecessary for
Sarsfield himself to take the girl to Lucan, but he felt this to be
an imperative duty.</p>

<p>When he went out into the street which looked unfamiliar in this
pale, early light, in this emptiness, he felt a thrill before him
as of a pleasing adventure. The evening before he had taken Ishma
from Madame de Bonnac and left her with Brighita; now, all
arrangements made, he went to fetch her. Ishma had been told to be
ready immediately, and all her simple preparations were made. She
was waiting in a little parlour, seated by a table. There was a
great peace in the chamber, which was poor; the one window was
darkened by a wall without. A little lamp was lit and standing on
the table and the pool of pale light which it made was like a pool
of luminous water. All seemed suave and immobile. Sarsfield felt a
sweet torpor descend upon his spirit. He had been, without knowing
it, greatly fatigued the last few days, mind and body. The long and
inevitable struggle in which he and Ireland were engaged suddenly
overcame him with a sense of exhaustion. He sat down the other side
of the table and looked at Ishma without speaking, while the dwarf
put together the packages, and Brian, the large greyhound, lifted
his head from his post at Ishma's feet, but, scenting a friend,
fell again into his stately repose; here Sarsfield could forget his
debates with Tyrconnel, D'Avaux, De Rosen, his promises to the
king, his wife, Madame de Bonnac and her malice.</p>

<p>Ishma greeted Sarsfield with a gentle blessing, almost as old as
the solitudes from which she came; then she fell, too, into a
silence which was without fear or expectation.</p>

<p>Her dark wool cloak fell away from her shoulders. Her rich hair
was knotted with a simple fillet of green.</p>

<p>In cruel contrast to his poor young wife and to the brilliancy
of Olivia, the freshness, the purity of Ishma were almost
unearthly; she bloomed like a lily breaking the sheath, strong,
untouched, unblemished. There was a warmth about her pallor, a
firmness about the curves of her lips, a soft brightness in her
candid eyes, that seldom remain beyond childhood. All her movement,
all her looks bespoke a simplicity and an innocence of which she
was herself unconscious.</p>

<p>"She is one of those who have the right to deride all, yet do
not do so out of sweet humility," thought Sarsfield, and he gave
himself up to the illusion that there existed nothing in the world
but the felicity and peace of this lamp-lit room, and the young
girl sitting the other side of the humble table, the dog like a
noble guardian at her feet, the city without shut away; all
ferocity, all cruelty, all bestiality hushed, distant and chained,
so that there was not even the most distant noise, the most far
away menace to disturb this utter calm.</p>

<p>It was Ishma who spoke first, asking, "if he was not ready?" She
would not, she said, with gentle courtesy, disturb him more than
she need, for she had heard that he and his troop must leave the
city that day.</p>

<p>She rose and he observed the fair exquisite fineness and pallor
of the hands which fastened the brooch at the throat of her dress.
She made him think of all that was fresh and lovely&mdash;of infancy, of
the early morning in springtime, of a rose in bud, of pure mountain
water running between fresh mosses, above all of the secret,
hidden, untouched Ireland, the gray-green pools, the unseen bog
lilies, the secret clusters of water violets, the willows sighing
in the rain and the cascades of pure water falling over green and
gray marble. As she stood there with her long delicate hands
arranging the torque of many colours at her young bosom, she turned
and smiled at him.</p>

<p>"One must do much for Ireland, must one not?" she said, without
a note of complaint in her low voice; "suffer and, perhaps, die."
Then she added reflectively: "No doubt to die would be the easiest
of all."</p>

<p>"There are things one must do before one dies," said Sarsfield;
as he spoke he felt a knocking at his heart, a clamour for the
ultimate rest, that yearning for the complete slumber which assails
men throughout their lives; by some sad shifting of his tired
thoughts, the pure virginity of the girl with her infantile
freshness seemed blended with the thought of death, as if immortal
sleep were offered to him with her pale graces as, soft-footed, she
came towards him.</p>

<p>He could not tell if she had inclined her body towards him, or
if he had taken her in his arms, but she was resting against his
breast and for a long moment stood thus. Tall as she was her head
only came to his shoulder.</p>

<p>They stood quite still, he enchanted by her proximity and by the
solemn sweetness of her voice. She began to tell him of the things
she had seen and heard in Dublin, of her adventures hiding in the
mountains before she had been able to make the city, and the sum of
it all in her own mind which was the great need of Ireland calling
out from wood and pasture, from lake and river, from mountain and
village, from church and wayside cross, for succour. She raised her
ingenuous regard, there seemed nothing strange to either of them in
the fact that she lay loosely in his embrace; though he was capable
of the utmost heights of passion there was nothing sensual in this
contact, nor was he conscious of the least infidelity to his
wife.</p>

<p>He said: "I will do what I can for Ireland, but you, my darling,
will pray." And half to himself he added: "It is a difficult life
for a woman."</p>

<p>His heart was full of desolate love and of sad joy. He thought:
"It is something to meet, even once, amid all the foolish
contradictions and stupid frustrations of destiny, one perfect
love!" He wished to extract from her something of her thoughts, her
emotions, to make the utmost of this lovely moment, which might
never have a counterpart, to lay up for himself richnesses of
memories which no one could steal; yet it was impossible to find
words, where each word must be rare, essential, poignant. He felt
confounded in face of this precious opportunity.</p>

<p>Her clothes were still perfumed with the fragrancy of fern and
moss; a scent of bay leaves came from her hair; as if she had set
aside some garland that was her due.</p>

<p>They moved apart without shyness; the dwarf entered and
said:</p>

<p>"It is a hot summer day, though there was a great mist happened
about the sunrise."</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-21" id="ch1-21"></a>TWENTY-ONE</h2>

<p class="first">
COLONEL HENRY LUTTRELL came to see the little cavalcade, which
consisted of Sarsfield and his body-servant, Ishma and the dwarf
woman, Brighita Begg, leave Dublin, and Sarsfield was touched by
this friendly consideration and by the respect with which Luttrell,
who was so often dissolute in his manners, treated Ishma,
considered her comfort and her welfare and listened with what
seemed a keen interest to Sarsfield's description of where he meant
to house her and her companion, in a keeper's cottage close to the
chapel on his demesne nearby the great cross with the runes which
the peasants considered magic, the three ash trees and the well.
All these things made the place a sacred one in the eyes of
Sarsfield's tenantry, and he thought it fitting that Ishma should
be housed there. Luttrell agreed, with a certain suave tenderness
in his assent; Sarsfield thought: "I have considered this man in
too ill a fashion, he has a finer nature than I believed." And the
two parted warmly, Luttrell saying that he wished to speak on
matters of importance to Sarsfield when he returned from Lucan and
before he left for Connaught.</p>

<p>Ishma said: "That is a noble and courteous cavalier. Does he
also fight for Ireland?"</p>

<p>"We are all supposed to be fighting for Ireland," replied
Sarsfield, "but do not confuse yourself, child, with all these
issues."</p>

<p>"There should be no confusion; either you fight for Ireland or
you do not; either you love or you do not."</p>

<p>These words seemed to him to rouse all his strength and all his
tenderness. He knew himself her lover and her slave. Through the
spiritual passion which had long been growing in his heart for her
rose a thrill sad of voluptuousness.</p>

<p>Withdrawn into their reveries they rode through the gates of
Dublin. A slight rain fell through the heat haze. From the heights
of the dry roofs the long trickles descended and dripped into the
streets. Sarsfield no longer felt the strength in himself to
struggle against destiny, whatever it might be. He could do no more
than submit himself to the clemency of God.</p>

<p>The small Irish horses were fresh and trotted briskly, the sound
of their hoofs on the cobbles fell into a rhythm in Sarsfield's
brain like the rhythm of Honor's prayer that morning in her
chamber. The day, after fair promise, became wet and cloudy, the
obscurity of the dawn returned; the shade of everything was gray
and dim.</p>

<p>They had hardly passed the gates when they were met by what
seemed to Sarsfield the unhappiest of mischances&mdash;Galmoy with a
group of companions returning from some dissolute haunt or evil
errand; even in the rank life of Dublin Galmoy had an ugly
name.</p>

<p>He recognised Sarsfield and the girl and drew up his horse,
laughing unpleasantly and coarsely, thrusting his gloved hand on
his hip as he stared with vulgar curiosity from one to the other.
His presence seemed to dissipate the mysterious tranquillity of the
morning, the mournful reverie in which Sarsfield's soul had been
withdrawn. He saluted briefly this man whom he despised, who lived
by rapine, pillage, treachery and all atrocities; but Galmoy was
not minded to let this encounter pass so easily. Brusquely and in a
brutal voice he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"So it begins&mdash;the pretty stratagem!"</p>

<p>Ishma raised her face, the pure outline of her features was
clear in the gray gold light behind the obscure veils of the light
rain. She said:</p>

<p>"I have met this cavalier at Madame de Bonnac's house."</p>

<p>"The airs of a princess!" sneered Galmoy, pushing back a hat
with a broken feather; but he ventured no further for Sarsfield's
look had crossed his; Galmoy put what insult he could into a gross
laugh and rode away with his lewd companions, who stupidly
applauded his insolence.</p>

<p>The rain increased, but was light, fresh and pleasant. Like a
distant menace they heard behind them the raucous voices of the
city; drop by drop the water fell from their equipment, from their
cloaks and from the ears of the horses.</p>

<p>Ishma appeared glad of the rain. She threw back her mantle and
her hair, like a dark vapour, spread over her shoulders; now and
then the breeze penetrated the rain, lifting a lock across her
pale, pure forehead; the golden distant sun was veiled and unveiled
by the quick passing clouds. The girl kept her eyes on the heavens
when she was not guiding her horse and gave no attention to the
ugly sights along the road and all the defilements of war, the
foulness of the soldiery.</p>

<p>The little horses went steadily, Sarsfield and Ishma side by
side, the dwarf woman and his body-servant behind; they rode almost
all the way beside the Liffey and were glad of the river. As they
neared his demesne of Lucan beauty began to spread about them in
protected fields, in ancient trees, full blooming with summertide
opulence, in pastures gray and cool and lush, in untainted air. The
sunbeams slipped through the rain and rainbows leapt from horizon
to horizon before them. Sarsfield recalled the rainbow on the day
when he had first met Ishma in the ruins of Irrelagh.</p>

<p>They entered his park and seemed as far from the war as they
were from the city. Noble <i>allées</i> of beech hung golden leaves
against the pearl-gray clouds and the vivid rainbow; the very
shadows were full of radiance.</p>

<p>By an enchantment of the senses this moment became fused with
many other moments in the life of Patrick Sarsfield, fused with
those earliest days when, an ardent child, he had read the rich
legends of his country and had made impetuous vows that he would
help this grand and piteous land which had given him birth, and
which had been so long enchained; with those alien days in a
foreign country where he had felt himself lonely and, even despite
his strength, his beauty and his gifts, despised; and with the day,
when after his monotonous foreign service, he had returned to
Ireland and seen her afresh in her lovely desolation, and met at
Irrelagh the girl who now rode beside him.</p>

<p>He turned away from the wide avenue which led to his mansion,
uninhabited since his brother's death and, with love in his looks,
gained the spot he had selected for the habitation of Ishma. It was
not unlike that where he had found her first on the banks of the
lake. There was a well guarded by may trees, which in their season
of flowering were hung with offerings and ribands, and there was
the cross, mighty, gray, interlaced with strange circles and runic
letters, to which the faithful on bare knees would make pilgrimage;
and there was a little chapel where from generation to generation
the Sarsfields had sent up their prayers and sometimes buried their
dead or christened their children. There was the priest's house,
long since empty, for Sarsfields chaplain had for many years
resided in the mansion. But this priest came daily. The cross and
the well of the sacred may trees, and the chapel were carefully
tended as if the war were far away. The little house itself was in
good repair, for many a refugee or poor distracted creature had
found shelter there. And at a word from the lord of the demesne the
four rooms had been decently furnished and the neat abode stood
fair and sweet, with the windows wide on to the wet grass and the
fresh rain and the distant blowing trees, and the view of a small
lake on which the swans swam in slow tranquillity.</p>

<p>"This is a poor place for you," said Patrick Sarsfield.</p>

<p>He lifted her from her horse across the threshold and he knew
that this&mdash;this precise moment, never any other before or
since&mdash;was the moment of bringing his wife home.</p>

<p>"It is a finer abode than I have left," she said.</p>

<p>He could not tell her of his regrets that he was unable to
install her in his mansion; that was what he wished to have
done&mdash;to put her like a great lady, like a fine princess, like a
delicate queen, in his noble halls and grand rooms and surround her
with all the treasure which his ancestors had accumulated. But this
could not be. Lucan, like his loyalty, belonged to Honor de Burgh.
Ishma divined nothing of his thoughts, she was grateful for this
sweet and gentle shelter. The poor dwarf, Brighita Begg, who had
long lived in penury and discomfort in Dublin, helped only by the
kindness of Henry Luttrell, was full of joy. She was eager with
housewifely business, putting this and that in order.</p>

<p>"I must return to Dublin," smiled Sarsfield. "This afternoon I
ride for Connaught."</p>

<p>Ishma made no demur, without speech everything seemed clear
between them. He remembered the charm he had murmured over her bent
head in the shade of the black yew at Irrelagh.</p>

<p>"I for thee, thee for me, and thy face turned from all
others."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a passionate submission; he did not dare
raise his eyes. Her hand touched his, and she said:</p>

<p>"We met too late or wrongly, my love, but let there be no
mistake, O darling of my heart, what thou art to me, nor any"&mdash;and
her voice rose more clearly&mdash;"as to what thou shalt be for
Ireland." She clasped her warm arms about him, her wrists were rain
wet; the same thoughts passed through their minds.</p>

<p>"Do you not feel," she murmured, "that you are in the middle of
a great agony&mdash;a silent agony? Can you not hear the friars and the
priests saying the mass for the dying and dead? Can you not hear,
vague and profound, the lamentations of all Ireland?"</p>

<p>"I have been slow to hear it," he said, "the world has been too
much with me, but now I understand. The rest of my life is for
Ireland and for you."</p>

<p>"For duty," Ishma said, leaning on his breast, "is it not the
duty of all of us to sacrifice ourselves to our dreams? For what is
true, my darling, but dreams? They alone cannot deceive us, they
alone are not corrupt with the desires and passions of men."</p>

<p>He bent his face on to her two hands which he raised tenderly.
At that moment he was conscious of nothing but his complete love
for her, a love faithful, burning, humble, which was one with his
love for Ireland, with the resolve to be loyal to Honor and the
forsaken.</p>

<p>As if exhausted, although the ride had been short and easy, she
leant against the wall and then let him take her once more in his
arms, yet gently; there was an unspoken bond between them which he
would never violate.</p>

<p>Over her head he could see the changing colour of the leaves,
bronze, gold and silver, as they shook against the fading rainbow;
the vistas of gray-green grass and the blue-gray lake where the
swans moved tranquilly. His sense of solitude was so strong he
could scarcely believe that his body-servant and the dwarf were
moving about the other rooms of the house.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall not see you again," whispered Ishma. "Do you
remember how in the old far-off days you came and did not know
me?"</p>

<p>She was effaced, humble before him, and again he was conscious
of her freshness and her purity like the freshness and purity of
mountain water at dawn. It seemed impossible that there should ever
be any discord between them, yet they were separated for ever.</p>

<p>"My prayers," she said, with infantile sweetness, "will brighten
your sword. There will be a glory on your flag&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will be safe here," he murmured, and felt the words futile,
hollow and foolish.</p>

<p>"Of what account is my safety? When you are victorious you will
return to your wife. She, too, is Irish; she, too, will rejoice in
your success."</p>

<p>"I cannot explain to you how little there is I may do. My master
is foreign&mdash;" He checked himself, words seemed a gross
stupidity.</p>

<p>"To remain thus longer is a weakness," she reminded him.</p>

<p>But, fine as thistledown though the idyll was, he could not
resist the human supplication:</p>

<p>"Do you care for me, Ishma? Could you have loved me if it had
been different?"</p>

<p>"What difference should have made any contradiction in my love?
I have always loved you, perhaps in a dream I first met you, I do
not know. The Shanahus led me once to the cloisters of Irrelagh and
under a black yew I said the charm. And ever since that love has
been with us both, invisible." Tears, crystal clear, hung on her
dark lashes.</p>

<p>"And I betrayed that love." He began to abuse himself for a
fool, a beast, stupid, gross, worldly...</p>

<p>But she hushed him, putting her delicate hands on his trembling
lips.</p>

<p>"None of that matters&mdash;it is you and I always. Perhaps at the
end and without wronging any we shall come together."</p>

<p>She covered her face to protect it from his possible kisses and
to conceal her disarray.</p>

<p>He said on a great sigh:</p>

<p>"Weep no more." And kissed those sheltering hands, and rode
away.</p>

<p>Only once did he have the courage to look back; then he saw the
dwarf woman standing at the doorway watching his departure with, he
thought, regret, and the noble outline of the hound lying under the
may trees on which the red fruit began to glisten, as if he kept
there a rendezvous for some ancient Irish knight who had been
mortally wounded in most distant battle, and would never return;
but the hound would keep vigil beneath the hawthorns until all the
berries had fallen, and the snow fell light and thin round the holy
well.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-22" id="ch1-22"></a>TWENTY-TWO</h2>

<p class="first">
WHEN King James joined Berwick's camp at Newry, Colonel Henry
Luttrell left Dublin for his governorship of Sligo.</p>

<p>Sarsfield who had, in a few weeks, on his own credit and through
his own popularity, raised two thousand men in Connaught, received
Luttrell with pleasure for his own sake and with distaste for what
his mission might be.</p>

<p>The very day he had left Dublin, Luttrell, encroaching on the
confidence Sarsfield had been induced to give him in the affair of
Ishma, had again approached him with suggestions of "forming a
party of native Irish and kicking all the Jack Hell-rogues out of
office."</p>

<p>Sarsfield had checked him with some sternness and, in an
endeavour to make him understand his attitude to the king, had
shown him the relic James had given him.</p>

<p>"Does it work miracles?" Luttrell had asked.</p>

<p>"Nay, not in my hands, of a surety."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell thee the greatest miracle worker of all and
that's Saint Ignoramus; bethink thee of the mass of superstition
thou hast to deal with in Ireland; why, a few old tales dressed up,
a few wonders worked, and all who be in a flame&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Am I a vulgar cheat?" Sarsfield had replied.</p>

<p>When Colonel Luttrell came to Sligo he showed no sign of
remembering this rebuke; he was all serene gaiety and pleasant
mocking humour; the most heartening and agreeable of companions. He
was, with his secret finesse, often the first to receive important
news and was believed to employ spies and agents on his own
account. He informed Sarsfield that Berwick would probably be
forced to fall back on Omagh; the Protestants were firmly settled
at Bundoran and Ballyshannon, the posts that Sarsfield had been
forced to abandon. Luttrell knew what D'Avaux had written to
Louvois of the defeats of Newtown-Butler, Derry and
Inniskillen.</p>

<p>"The troops returned from the siege of Derry were entirely
ruined, and those commanded by Lord Mountcashel beaten and put to
flight in a manner to make one despair of such soldiers. When the
Inniskilleners came in great disorder, but with much courage, to
attack Mountcashel, the cavalry and dragoons fled without firing a
pistol, and after some of them had burst their horses with the
force of flight they took to their heels, threw away their weapons,
their swords and jackets that they might run the more swiftly&mdash;the
infantry also behaved badly. Mountcashel, who headed the reserve
battalions, has been wounded, his horse killed, himself taken and,
as he was forsaken by all, it was reported that he was dead, but he
is under good treatment at Inniskillen."</p>

<p>"Such was the Frenchman's despatch," smiled Luttrell, showing a
clerkly copy to Sarsfield.</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I have my ways of finding out&mdash;I am no mole to work in the
dark."</p>

<p>"Thou art too keen and violent, Harry, under thy bright
japes."</p>

<p>"Can I say nothing thou wilt not scruple at?"</p>

<p>"Not on this matter."</p>

<p>"You have no stomach for ill news? Well, King James will be at
Drogheda in a day or so. Melfort even advises him to retire, to
Castle Rathfarnham and give up the struggle; 'tis touch and go if
D'Avaux and Tyrconnel succeed in keeping him at his post."</p>

<p>"Whether or no," replied Sarsfield, "I can hold Connaught, I am
better provided than I was at Bundoran."</p>

<p>But Henry Luttrell seemed little impressed by this.</p>

<p>"It is certain," he said, "that this struggle can have but one
conclusion. Schomberg has twenty thousand men, all, I take it,
armed and well-disciplined troops. He may be followed by his
master."</p>

<p>"Prince William would never dare to leave England."</p>

<p>"I think there is little Prince William would not dare to do to
end this quarrel."</p>

<p>"The French have always underrated the English and the
Protestants," frowned Sarsfield. He himself intensely disliked the
colonists, their hard faces, their brusque manners, their
money-getting ways, their stern religion; the very fact of their
being there at all, usurping aliens, pressing this yoke firmly on
the necks of the natives, was sufficient to raise in him a deep
detestation amounting to loathing, but he recognised their quality,
their fanaticism, their fortitude, their persevering courage and
their grim belief in a grim God, which made them almost
unconquerable foes.</p>

<p>It was already eight months since James had landed with such
hope and confidence on the part of his allies at Kinsale and the
struggle had gone steadily in favour of the rebellious colonists.
The amateur soldiers, without experienced generals or help from
England, had contrived to more than hold their own and now, with
the raising of the siege of Derry and Inniskillen, it seemed to
Sarsfield's clear mind and wise experience that Luttrell judged
correctly. But he said with more confidence than he felt:</p>

<p>"Schomberg also will have the country, the rapparees and the
climate to contend with. He will arrive in a land already ruined
and, unless he is well supplied from England, I pity his case.
Schomberg is also old and cautious and will not risk a battle. His
troops will be decimated by disease and treachery. Believe me, my
dear Luttrell, he will not find things so easy."</p>

<p>"No one has ever found anything easy in Ireland," smiled
Luttrel; "but one must believe that the Protestant government in
London is in earnest. Schomberg is not the least capable of their
generals," he added, with meaning.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield admired and respected the Marshal of France
who, at the age of seventy, had cast away a brilliant career for
the sake of conscience. Frederick Herman, Duke of Schomberg, had
faithfully served King Louis until the latter had begun to
persecute the Huguenots. Since his landing at Bangor in County Down
the whole of the northwest of Ireland had come into the hands of
the Protestants, while in the north-east the Jacobites merely held
Newry and Charlemont.</p>

<p>"Even Schomberg might be stopped," said Sarsfield, pacing up and
down the withdrawing-room of the house which formed his
headquarters at Sligo; "he might be stopped, but it is not done.
How many men has Berwick?"</p>

<p>"Sixteen hundred,"&mdash;said Luttrell instantly; he was always
well-informed&mdash;"at Drogheda, where he has four regiments, De Rosen
is raising an army in Dublin."</p>

<p>"The Protestants are raising an army, too, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Yes, I lave heard fine accounts of 'em, too, from some who have
come over to us from Ulster."</p>

<p>"We have more to fear from them than from the troops that will
be sent from England, but they will not bear discipline or be under
the orders of any foreigners," said Sarsfield. "Why do we discuss
this matter? Have we nothing to do but turn our tongues about
events which we cannot control?"</p>

<p>"But you can control them," put in Luttrell quickly. "Multitudes
admire you and you do nothing with it&mdash;in a sense, you betray those
who look to you. Galway, your own wife's brother, hinted as much to
me."</p>

<p>"I know," replied Sarsfield, "the rock whereon I am set."</p>

<p>"I know the dreams that befog thee." He looked closely at
Sarsfield, peering with his oblique glance. "Art thou fanatic,
Sarsfield?" Then he added almost instantly: "No, it is not
possible."</p>

<p>"I grope and wonder, and take comfort where I can," replied the
other soldier.</p>

<p>"I fear thy comforts are but trumpery, would ye keep a mistress
and never enjoy her? Despise a king and serve him? Hold to dim,
fantastical, vague loyalties beyond a plain man's understanding?
Confuse all clear issues with scruples and doubts that are beyond
the patience of all to unravel?"</p>

<p>"Thou art clever," smiled Sarsfield, with some affection in his
look, "and may be a better man than I. But I am not so weak that I
must spy through another's glasses."</p>

<p>Luttrell changed the matter of his discourse.</p>

<p>"Have you heard lately from your lady in Dublin?" he asked
easily. "The roads are so bad the expresses come through with
difficulty."</p>

<p>"I have had letters from her full of evil news; of what else
should she write, poor soul, from a damned city? Her health fails,
too; they lack luxuries there and even necessities."</p>

<p>Honor had told him she was expecting his child; news given
without pleasure and received almost with pain; he felt her
resentment through her formal phrases, it was clear that this would
bring them no nearer. Absence seemed to have withered all their
valiant endeavour at an understanding.</p>

<p>"Well," said Colonel Luttrell, "the Lady Honor is better
entertained in Dublin than she could be in Sligo; the capital is
not so ill provided and some of the ladies are gay enough. The
vicereine contrives to hold a court, and Madame de Bonnac has her
salon. They say she has made a favourite of my Lord Galmoy."</p>

<p>Sarsfield did not know if he said this with the intention to
sting. But it was not like Luttrell to wound and possibly he had
already, with his delicate sense, guessed that Sarsfield had become
indifferent as to who might enjoy the graces of Madame de Bonnac.
Sarsfield could think of this lady without regret or
reluctance...</p>

<p>"And that other?" asked Luttrell gently, with a certain
tenderness, "that poor girl, Ishma&mdash;that child? I hope she is
well."</p>

<p>Sarsfield replied with the same candour as he was offered;
subterfuge or any manner of concealment never came naturally to
him; though he knew how perilous the truth could be, he had never
learnt to lie.</p>

<p>"She is still at my demesne, Lucan. My bailiff writes to me of
her with other news; she has no company beyond Mrs. Brighita Begg,
thy friend, and the dog. But I take it she is happy."</p>

<p>"If one can be who has lost everything," smiled Luttrell.</p>

<p>"What do you think she has lost?" asked Sarsfield, startled.</p>

<p>"Why, all. But then she never hoped for anything."</p>

<p>"You seem to understand her very well," exclaimed the other; his
gray eyes wide open, his head held high. "Remember, she is a
stranger to both of us."</p>

<p>"There are some people whom one never sees as strangers. I do
understand that girl very well. To you and to me, too, she is
Ireland herself&mdash;the beautiful little daughter of the beautiful
earth, sprung from such far off, such ancient and such sacred hopes
and loves&mdash;" He changed his tone briskly. "Or is she but a peasant
from Irrelagh, whom some would call simpleton?"</p>

<p>Sarsfield interrupted him:</p>

<p>"You understand too much, Luttrell, you read me too clearly. You
twist yourself too closely round my heart, I would not have such a
near friend."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because," sighed Sarsfield, with something of an effort to put
a difficult thought into words, "I know you must want something of
me."</p>

<p>"But could I not love you for yourself alone?" asked Luttrell in
his most candid manner. "You do yourself wrong, my dear Sarsfield,
you are the most popular of men."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt your sincerity," said Sarsfield, walking to and
fro again, with his hands clasped behind the wide flaps of his
skirts, "and yet I feel there is something insinuating in your
address." He broke off to add: "And I have not forgotten what you
said to me before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what I must say to you again. You are more foolish than any
man of your parts could be if you do not take advantage of the
fortune now spread before you. <i>Mon Dieu</i>! if I were in your
place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why do you not put yourself in my place?" asked Sarsfield
quickly, "you have all the opportunities that I have."</p>

<p>Luttrell replied in a mild manner but with a deep
impatience:</p>

<p>"I have none of your opportunities. Are you not beloved by all,
have you not great influence? Has it not come easy to you to raise
these men in Connaught? How many have you now under your
command?"</p>

<p>"Two thousand," said Sarsfield, without pride. "All Irishmen and
willing to die for Ireland."</p>

<p>"That is the kind of bravado we want," smiled Luttrell. "A man
who can talk like that. Well, why don't <i>you</i> go with these
men and meet Schomberg while he is still entangled in difficulties,
curtailed in supplies, riddled by treachery? Confound King James
and King Louis, and endeavour to obtain Ireland for the Irish."</p>

<p>Sarsfield replied with a force and sternness rare in him. He was
both impressed and troubled. He could not doubt his friend's
earnestness, but he must, after all, suspect his sincerity. He
paused in front of Luttrell, towering over him, making the other,
for all his ease and elegance, look small and insignificant by
comparison.</p>

<p>"What is your count in this, Luttrell?" he demanded. "What do
you want from me that you urge me on to this strange, fantastical
course? Once again let us have it clear between us."</p>

<p>"If you like to put it brutally I want to rise by your
influence, I want to be to you"&mdash;he laughed&mdash;"what Louvois is to
King Louis. I have all the qualities you lack. Your virtues would
remedy my defects. Between us we could rule Ireland very well, far
better than these fools, fops and braggarts and jobbing knaves who
at present undertake the task. You for the field," he went on with
growing animation; "I for the cabinet; believe me, I know more than
you credit of the government, the affairs and state of this
country&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sarsfield broke in:</p>

<p>"It is not possible that you can be serious!"</p>

<p>"It seems to me," replied Luttrell coolly, "impossible that you
should refuse to take me seriously. What is this King Shamus to us?
A poltroon, a miserable old man, a foreigner! Do you want to raise
native Irish to bleed and die for <i>him</i>? Is not this the
moment?" He struck his fine, delicate hand lightly on the table
near which he stood. "Perhaps you have not heard that Berwick has
burnt Newry and that Schomberg is approaching Drogheda? Aye, burnt
Newry," he continued impatiently and contemptuously; "that is the
manner of man this princeling is. He has simply provoked the
English who have sent a trumpeter to warn him that if any other
towns are thus treated they will give no quarter. I did not mean to
tell you, yet better you should know."</p>

<p>"Where is Schomberg now?" asked Sarsfield, in a low voice. "You
seem well informed, Luttrell."</p>

<p>"I had an express but ten minutes before I spoke to you,"
replied Luttrell. "Schomberg is about a mile northwest of Dundalk.
The country about him is deserted, he is encamped on the marshy
ground behind the river, with castle Dundalk on his right flank,
the sea on the left."</p>

<p>"He cannot be attacked," said Sarsfield.</p>

<p>"He is waiting to see what we do at Drogheda. And are we to wait
on both of them&mdash;on King James and on Schomberg?"</p>

<p>"It may be counted as a success that we have gotten into Sligo,"
said Sarsfield dryly.</p>

<p>"Leave the old man behind the Shannon then, aye, leave it all to
chance," said Luttrell, and he turned away with a look of such real
disappointment and gloom that Sarsfield was softened, and followed
him, putting his hand upon his shoulder, saying:</p>

<p>"I cannot consider what you say. It may be that if King James
follows cowardly counsel, and the Protestants gain more successes
that I might throw in my own hand to strike for Ireland
herself&mdash;but never as a rebel."</p>

<p>Luttrell clasped Sarsfield's hand and replied warmly:</p>

<p>"I am behind you in all you do, and I have more weight than you
perhaps think."</p>

<p>Sarsfield looked at him keenly, wondering what this man, with
his peculiar fascination, his subtlety and his unscrupulousness,
quite hoped from this strange alliance; he did not really fear him
nor his schemes; he believed that he could afford to smile at his
wild ambitions, and that when it came to a push Harry Luttrell
would be as loyal as he himself.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-23" id="ch1-23"></a>TWENTY-THREE</h2>

<p class="first">
PATRICK SARSFIELD had little space in which to consider the
bold, insidious and, as he thought, perfidious counsels of Henry
Luttrell, for he was summoned to Drogheda where King James held a
council as to what was to be done in the face of Schomberg's
encampment behind the Shannon.</p>

<p>De Rosen had contrived to assemble twenty thousand men at this
rendezvous. The three disasters of Derry, Inniskillen and
Newton-Butler had shaken the confidence alike of officers and men,
all were disheartened by the sense of failure and by the activities
of deadly disease. Fevers, agues, the bloody flux, dysentery were
rife among the disorderly ranks; there was a shortage of all
necessities.</p>

<p>Sarsfield found the cavalry fairly good, the infantry in no more
than passable condition, and most of the officers inefficient. He
found, too, divided counsels. He was the only officer who had any
success to report. Not only had he succeeded in securing Sligo, the
key of Connaught, and in leaving troops there, but he had been able
to arm Galway, thus holding the western provinces for James. For
the rest, no one had good news; they remained like men confounded;
many clamoured that the King should abandon Dublin and cross the
Channel.</p>

<p>De Rosen desired to withdraw to Athlone, to play a waiting game
till winter set in, by merely defending the line of the river,
disciplining his men and endeavouring to obtain supplies. He
declared, with his brutal impetuosity, that the loss of a battle
now would be fatal to the prestige of the King of France. An
efficient officer, he had studied all the details of the plans he
proposed.</p>

<p>"The Shannon in spate," he declared, "presented a strong barrier
to the Protestants and from the fortified towns along its banks
they might be assailed without fear of pursuit, and the wild
mountains of Connaught abounded in rocky defiles and deep retreats
which were known only to the Irish. If the river were crossed the
English might be harried by continuous attacks."</p>

<p>D'Avaux, for once, seconded the advice of De Rosen, but James
protested that to retreat to Athlone meant the surrender of Dublin,
and Tyrconnel threw his weight on the side of the king, who, with a
flash of his old spirit, declared that he would not "be walked out
of Ireland without having, at least, one blow for it;" the viceroy
added "that the effect of a withdrawal would be disastrous on the
spirits of the fresh levies." De Rosen trembled at this decision
but he knew the defects of the officers he commanded; the king
vacillated between one counsel and another.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield, leaning forward across the council table,
pointed out that between Schomberg and Dublin lay nothing except
the River Boyne and the Pass of Duleek. He believed that a
well-executed diversion in the west might compel the English to
retreat...He had only got thus far in his speech when an express
came post to Drogheda. Schomberg had sent the Inniskillens across
the Curlew mountains and astonished the outposts by a fierce attack
in the fog of an autumn day.</p>

<p>Over two hundred and fifty Jacobites had been killed and three
hundred, including their colonel, O'Kelly, captured, and eight
thousand head of cattle taken; the Inniskillens had lost no more
than fourteen men. The express added that Schomberg had ordered
both the artillery and musketry to make three salvoes in honour of
this success.</p>

<p>He had been himself so pleased that he had paraded the
Inniskillens and praised them for their soldier-like qualities,
riding along the whole line with head uncovered.</p>

<p>"If the rest of the army were like the Inniskillens," remarked
Sarsfield, when this news was made known to the council, "he would
be marching into Dublin, but he knows that his men are as unfit as
our own, and no doubt he is determined to remain on the defensive
until we are all forced into winter quarters."</p>

<p>"If he had attacked us when he first landed," said De Rosen, "he
might have been in Dublin at a step; we had not two thousand men
ready to defend the capital. The old fox was too cautious, and now,
whatever flourishes the Inniskillens may make, we have thirty
thousand to meet him."</p>

<p>The council at Drogheda broke up with no decision arrived at,
and Sarsfield returned to Connaught.</p>

<p>He contrived, as a counterblast to Schomberg's success, to
capture Jamestown, but when De Rosen, attempting to cut off
Schomberg's communications with Newry, failed, there was a lull in
operations.</p>

<p>The weather was hot and stagnant, and seemed of a piece with the
spirits of the men in both the opposing camps.</p>

<p>Neither De Rosen nor Schomberg wished to risk a battle though
many on James's side were for vigorous action, and though the
Prince of Orange wrote impetuously from London bidding his cautious
old general attempt an engagement before disease ruined his troops,
and fresh reinforcements for James arrived from France.</p>

<p>Schomberg remained at Dundalk fifty miles distant from the
capital. Spies, traitors, deserters and scouts brought a fair
account of the state of the invading army to Sarsfield in
Connaught. Schomberg's finance, transport, and supplies were all
cruelly mismanaged. Commissary-General Henry Shales had gathered
large supplies at Belfast, but lacked means to convey them to the
front; so there was an abundance of beef, flour, bread and brandy
at Belfast, but none at Dundalk. There was no bread issued to the
officers because there was not sufficient for the men. When the
army halted the officers were forced to dig out potatoes and forage
for stray herbs and vegetables. The corn still lay in the fields,
rotted with the heavy rains; the other crops had been devoured or
destroyed. When the long-delayed supplies did arrive the men,
already weakened by semi-starvation, found them unwholesome. They
could neither eat the beef nor drink the brandy. Two months after
the Treasury had paid the bill the shoes had not arrived at the
camp. Schomberg was reported to be almost sinking under the load of
anxiety laid on his aged shoulders. He was used to efficiency, to a
well-disciplined army, to regular supplies and proper
communications; he could do little or nothing with the English
peasants he commanded; they did not, it appeared, know how to load
their pieces, the dragoons did not know how to manage their horses.
He was further discouraged by discovering a conspiracy; some of his
French companies were in communication with D'Avaux, six men were
hanged and two hundred sent to England in irons. In one of his
despatches to the Prince of Orange, Schomberg wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The army is without shoes, a march of two days would leave my
army barefoot besides their other miseries."</p>

<p>On the other hand, Sarsfield learned that James was at length
stirred to activity and wished to give battle. De Rosen knew and
feared the effect of inactivity and sickness, hardship and
discipline upon the Irish; his numbers were at present superior to
those of the invader. His chief advantage consisted in at least
eight to ten thousand well-mounted cavalry, while Schomberg, on
landing, had never had more than two or three thousand; the Irish
army was then punctually paid, the brass money passed as currency;
there was plenty of good beef, corn, mutton, French wines and
brandy; meanwhile the condition of Schomberg's men became steadily
worse and the cautious old general refused to fight until he
believed himself ready.</p>

<p>Sarsfield was moved by the accounts the spies brought of the
miseries endured by the invaders. The heavy autumn rains had
descended on the low-lying boggy soil, the indolent and ignorant
English did not erect huts till it was impossible to secure dry
timber for the walls or dry straw for the roofs.</p>

<p>Schomberg had exclaimed bitterly: "I never was in an army where
there were so many new and lazy officers, if all were broke who
deserved it on this account there would be few left." The English
soldiers succumbed first, from want and privation.</p>

<p>"The English nation," wrote Schomberg, "are so delicately bred
that as soon as they are out of their own country they die in the
first campaign in all countries where I have seen them serve."</p>

<p>The men would not renew the rotting ferns in their wretched beds
and they would not drain the marshy soil; the miseries of poor
insufficient food were added to the horrors of exposure and
filth...</p>

<p>Within a month after their arrival at Dundalk one thousand of
the fourteen thousand were in hospital.</p>

<p>Men made use of their dead comrades for pillows and when the
dying were carried to hospital those who remained behind lamented
that they were the more exposed to the wet winds; the bloody flux
began in the camp and numbers died daily.</p>

<p>The weather continued very various, sometimes rain, then sharp
cold, then foggy.</p>

<p>The Inniskillens, the other northerners who were used to the
climate, and the Dutchmen survived, but the peasants of Yorkshire
and Derbyshire were unable to resist.</p>

<p>Schomberg did all that one man could do, and Sarsfield could not
help his heart going out to the veteran who was enduring such a
terrible experience in his old age. He was hampered by the
heartlessness of his officers who did not care how many died; the
more deaths there were the more pay for their pockets.</p>

<p>The old general did not spare himself; he gave the least jaded
men the labour of searching for wood, and ordered stimulants to be
given even to those not sick; the fatal camp was moved from low
boggy land to higher ground; some of the sick were sent on board
war vessels lying in Belfast docks.</p>

<p>King James's peasants also began to suffer. Out of a total of
forty thousand men, about fifteen thousand perished of disease. As
the wet autumn stormed into winter neither army any longer thought
of victory; as one Irishman expressed the matter: "They contended
for the honour of who could look the longest at the Angel of Death
encamped with them."</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield could do nothing but hold Connaught; horrors
seemed to thicken on the earth and in the air until all the
atmosphere was congealed with dread, like the gray misery of a
nightmare.</p>

<p>At the beginning of November the Jacobites withdrew into Dublin
to winter quarters, and Schomberg, retrieving his mistake of
leaving Ulster and seeing now, with great bitterness, how delusive
had been his hope of a speedy conquest of Ireland, moved his tents
from Dundalk to Lisburne.</p>

<p>When he had pitched his camp there before, he had had fourteen
thousand troops; only seven thousand survived to leave the
graveyard of their fellows; some regiments had not sixty effective
men in their ranks.</p>

<p>Schomberg sat his horse for hours in the chill wind and blowing
rain watching this wretched remnant of the invading army pass;
trembling with age and emotion he gave his thanks to the dispirited
ranks as they defiled past him, offered them his sympathies for
their sufferings and endeavoured to inspire them with renewed hope.
The distress and courage of the old man and the memory of what he
had endeavoured to do for them moved some of the wretched soldiers
to tears; none of them knew what the war was really about; they
were tired of catch words and had heard nothing else.</p>

<p>De Rosen might easily have fallen on the army of the Protestants
as they marched to Lisburne, weary and enfeebled, encumbered with
so many sick and disabled.</p>

<p>Such an attack would have been greatly to the advantage of King
James, but not, as D'Avaux and De Rosen well knew, to that of King
Louis who did not wish any victory but a prolonged struggle in
Ireland.</p>

<p>The Jacobites, when they returned to Dublin, leaving a garrison
at Drogheda and some others dispersed through Connaught and
Leinster, persuaded themselves that they might be congratulated on
a successful campaign. "They had done tolerably well and Schomberg
might count himself defeated," declared the young officers in haste
to get to Dublin, where "the ladies expected them with
impatience."</p>

<p>Through idleness and disease the army had become debauched and
"Dublin was a seminary of vice, an academy of luxury," the
Protestants said forcibly, "a sink of corruption, a living emblem
of Sodom."</p>

<p>For three months nothing had happened, yet the Protestants had
lost well nigh half their army. Schomberg had not advanced nearer
Dublin, indeed he had fallen back. James might plume himself on
this, and though there were rumours that William himself intended
coming to Ireland it was believed in Dublin that party emergencies
would mean his setting out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the sturdy Protestants in the north held their own
despite the disasters attendant on Schomberg. From Lough Erne to
Belfast stretched, guarding their lines, a succession of their
outposts which formed the basis of fresh expeditions against the
Jacobites.</p>

<p>Berwick did his best to keep the Irish communications open
between Drogheda and Dublin, and was sometimes sent to endeavour to
cut off English communications between Inniskillen and Lisburne.
The Williamites had a striking success in the capture of Belturbet,
thus leaving Charlemont the only fortress in Ulster still in the
possession of James. This, however, did not take place before the
garrison had been forced to eat horse-hide, and Schomberg, on
seeing the wretched men march out, expressed good-humoured contempt
for the miserable appearance they made. Friend and foe alike showed
scorn for the native Irish.</p>

<p>But King James, shut up in Dublin, was not feeling as confident
or as fortunate as perhaps his enemies believed he might be;
Sarsfield, with his hand always on the pulse of affairs, saw that
the king's own plans had helped to ruin the country and that their
sole hope of salvation still lay in France.</p>

<p>When the Jacobites came south they drove their cattle with them,
and with the crowds of animals the grass and corn threatened to
fail; the march of the soldiery infuriated the Irish farmers and
the land was neglected. At the same time D'Avaux was writing to
France that no army composed of Irishmen could succeed. It was
suggested that De Rosen and D'Avaux, neither of whom got on well
with the king, should be recalled.</p>

<p>Sarsfield was kept at his post much later than the other
officers; he still felt himself shut out from the confidence of the
inner council by the marked hostility on the part of Berwick, the
growing indifference on the part of D'Avaux, the growing hatred on
the part of De Rosen; the dispirited king took no notice of him,
Tyrconnel was his open enemy and on every occasion flouted him.</p>

<p>Sarsfield sent a memorandum to the king pointing out several
defects and suggesting various improvements in the organisation of
the army. He remarked that, "Ireland possessed no gun factories nor
arsenals, that it was not easy to import war material; that though
the brass money might pass muster at home, abroad foreign merchants
refused to accept it." He pointed out without pride that he himself
had been able to recruit, maintain and discipline a considerable
body of men in Connaught, amounting at times to three thousand, and
with them to guard the passes of the Shannon and hold the whole
province, and that if he were allowed a free hand he might do as
much with the rest of the army.</p>

<p>There was no answer to this letter and Sarsfield hid his heart
in silence. "They all despise us," he thought, "they none of them
can see the spirit there is behind the rags and the misery; none of
them can believe that a nation exists, they see nothing but hordes
of untrained peasants, of quarrelling mercenaries, of braggadocio
cowards."</p>

<p>He felt strangely overborne, as if the miseries of the whole
country, Catholic and Protestant, increasing with every day,
weighed on his own breast. He received letters more and more rarely
from his wife. She was in poor health, but she was guarding his
honour and his coming child. He tried not to think of her as a
stranger. Reports of Madame de Bonnac's gaieties fell coldly on his
ears.</p>

<p>The bailiff at Lucan reported that the poor refugee, Ishma
O'Donaghoe, lived like a nun and was seldom seen abroad. When at
last Sarsfield had permission to retire to winter quarters it was,
by an uncontrollable impulse, to his domain at Lucan that he rode
before entering the capital.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-24" id="ch1-24"></a>TWENTY-FOUR</h2>

<p class="first">
PATRICK SARSFIELD'S splendid mansion stood closed and silent,
the precise façade white against the autumnal sky covered with
loose, flying clouds which seemed to gather and take up with them
the last dry leaves in one continuous and steady whirl of
destruction.</p>

<p>A certain gracious obscurity was over the whole landscape,
mournful the place was and melancholy, yet far from the echoes of
war. Everything seemed harmonious and natural, as if all had
achieved a perfect grace and beauty, and would never suffer any
unworthy change.</p>

<p>Sarsfield mounted the wide winged steps, entered the empty but
well-kept house and went slowly from room to room. He thought of
his mother and the childhood he had spent here, those early days
full of brave dreams, and wonders, and poignant delights. He would
not have the shutters opened nor the curtains drawn, but passed
from one chamber to another in deep greenish shade, where the
furniture and the tapestry, the huge beds and the great chairs, the
massive overmantels appeared monstrous and almost unreal, like
forms seen in the depths of a forest that was itself a vision.</p>

<p>Sarsfield was glad to be away from the veiled light of day. He
took no practical heed of what was about him, he scarcely listened
to what his steward said, he made no inspection; he barely sensed
that all his property was in order.</p>

<p>As he passed from room to room he was allowing himself to enter
that secret world which is the right of every man to find refuge
in. He thought of the wife he should have brought home here, the
children who should have run about these closed-up chambers, of
their heritage that should have been the freedom and independence,
and the name of a proud nation. The portraits of his forbears on
the walls, the mirror in which he saw his own pale, composed face
reflected&mdash;all to him were eloquent of the tarnished bravery of his
futile dreams. Majestic and magnificent, but veiled by the gray
austerity of the clouds, the park lay spread in the waning light of
the waning year. The trees were bare, the crossing of their boughs
in the great <i>allès</i> made a darkness in the air, the dead
leaves were thick under foot, they rested on the still surface of
the lake, and when the breeze lifted them like a blown breath they
floated through the air as if borne reluctantly to an invisible
destination.</p>

<p>Sarsfield went to the lake. He found the water soothing and
delicious, he stooped and trailed his fingers in it; the swans
floated beyond the swathes of dry leaves, they seemed no more real
than their own pure reflection. Sarsfield felt indescribably moved
by this water which mirrored year after year the moon, the sun, the
fires of the evening and the distant brilliancy of the stars. The
serenity and loneliness of the scene filled him at once with pain
and compassion. He thought of the wearinesses, of the fatigues and
miseries, of the humiliations and the cruelties of the past year,
not only for himself but for others. He thought of the dead and
dying, of the drunken, the lewd and the blasphemous, of all who
defiled and were themselves defiled, and he pitied all; he thought
of the English peasants in Schomberg's army, rotting in the
stagnant marsh; of the men choking with plague, using a dead
companion's body for a shelter against the wind, of the sullen
sound of the firing as the soldiers gave the last salute over a
body trampled into the bog. He thought of Schomberg himself who had
been a Marshal of France, the proud, grand man, sitting there on
his lean horse, trembling with age and grief while he tried to
mumble out a few words to hearten the scarecrow remnant of his
men.</p>

<p>He thought of the Irish rapparees, the scorned, despised of all,
burning and slaying, and in their own turn burnt and slain.</p>

<p>They were all about him, hiding in the bogs and in the
mountains, even behind the sheaves of grain mouldering in the
ground, crouching behind the trees heavy with unplucked and corrupt
fruit, the fields which had not been sown, the harvest which had
not been reaped, or hiding in the bogs up to their lips drawing in
air through pipes; the Irish of Ireland perishing daily with every
ignominy and horror.</p>

<p>The thought of all these miseries, of all this waste, tormented
the heart of Patrick Sarsfield as he paced in the dead leaves by
the border of the lake; he thought of all he had done and all he
must do, of the failures that lay like a garland of straw at the
end of all his travail.</p>

<p>For he had no great confidence in himself nor any hope of
success for Ireland. His own unhappiness seemed to spread out and
embrace the unhappiness of all these others. There was a doom on
all of them and surely on his beloved. Say what she would, keep up
her heart as she might, she was sad, she suffered and she was
lonely and alone in the midst of strangers.</p>

<p>He walked slowly through the park towards her cottage and the
little church. In the distance he could see the gaunt bulk of the
cross raised against the sky which was now darkening down to a
violet tint, overblown with blue vapours. The air was heavy with
the dull sweetnesses of decay, the may trees beside the holy well
were robbed of all but the last coronel of small wrinkled leaves,
their thorns were sharply visible.</p>

<p>Ishma was at her door as if she had expected him. He recalled
that in all their meetings she had been there with that air of
waiting for him. She was grave, but not sad, and unchanged, in a
gown of her own weaving and sewing, a kerchief knotted under her
chin, her ornaments gleaming like the pale gold of a harvest moon.
She stood aside and invited him to pass into the cottage.</p>

<p>"It is all clean and decent," she said, "there is no dust on any
of the furniture."</p>

<p>"An invisible dust," thought Sarsfield, "the dust of our
memories of a time ended, an epoch disappeared."</p>

<p>"There would have been," said Ishma, "flowers on the table, but
it is so late now there are none in your garden."</p>

<p>There was an odour in the room, (though its poverty was bare and
stark,) of balm and aromatic herbs, and an unknown poignant perfume
of freshness.</p>

<p>Ishma sat down by the spinning-wheel, her eyes were closed, her
hands folded in her lap. It seemed to Sarsfield almost as if she
slept, but, watching her keenly, he saw two tears of crystal purity
tremble at the edge of her lashes and fall down her cheeks. He
asked her, not of his own volition for never had he considered
putting such a question at once so intimate and so cruel:</p>

<p>"What would you have done if I had not come back?"</p>

<p>Her mouth was tormented by an expression of grief or fear. He
approached her, he knelt beside her, placing his hands and then his
face on her knees. Then she spoke:</p>

<p>"It does not seem as if you had been away, and if these monsters
which are now in Ireland had devoured you, my darling, we should
have been together all the sooner."</p>

<p>"I cannot stay," said Sarsfield, "we must always be separated."
But he spoke as if this separation seemed to him impossible.</p>

<p>He had some pearls and diamonds in his pocket which he had taken
earlier in the day from the charge of his steward. It seemed to him
the most natural thing in the world, nay, a desire that it was
almost impossible to resist, to take these jewels, long worn by the
women of his family, and lay them in the lap of Ishma. But they
were for his wife and he must carry them to Dublin and offer them
to Honor.</p>

<p>"Are you not content?" came Ishma's gentle voice. "Have you not
confidence?"</p>

<p>"In what, my darling?" he asked. "There is but to go on and do
what one may."</p>

<p>He raised his noble head a little and saw behind her shoulders
the landscape suddenly illuminated by the scarlet of the sunset
which trailed in vivid vapours behind the bare trees.</p>

<p>He took between his cold hands the sweet and gentle face of
Ishma, and softly pressed his fingers into the masses of her black
hair, drawing her so close that he could perceive the tear-drops
forming in the corners of her candid eyes like wet water violets,
the freshness of her carnation which was all lily pure; the red
transient light of the passing of the sun streamed through the
narrow window over both of them.</p>

<p>Forgetting all else he said, with passion:</p>

<p>"We must re-find our great happiness, our happiness without
shame, our innocent happiness which caused no suffering to
any."</p>

<p>"Suffering?" she repeated, "we suffer enough ourselves; surely
we shall be pardoned." Her lids drooped, the tears overbrimmed and
ran down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"You are happy here, Ishma, there is nothing I can do, there is
no way I can change your life?"</p>

<p>"What else? Though I am in Ireland, I feel in exile. Perhaps one
day I may return to Irrelagh, but there everything was
destroyed...Yes, I am happy, the world is very beautiful. No one
could guess," she added, with a musing smile, "the sweetnesses of
my grief, the glories of my miseries."</p>

<p>The evening air was of an extraordinary damp freshness.</p>

<p>He could see outlined in the red light of the sunset the heavy
arms of the sculptured cross, and the bell-tower and bell of the
little church, and one of the hawthorns with dry and seemingly
broken outline, and he thought of the crown of thorns.</p>

<p>"How long have you been gone?" she asked, "and when will you
return? I cannot measure the time."</p>

<p>"I shall be in Dublin, my Iove, the great city which is but a
few miles from here, and all these about you are my servants. If
you have any need of me you must tell them and I would come
quickly."</p>

<p>"Beautiful strange dream!" she cried. "Get up, my love, and ride
away before it breaks to pieces in our hands."</p>

<p>He obeyed and she, too, got to her feet and stood beside him,
resting her hands on his shoulders and looking into his eyes. With
a touching care, with a loving gentleness, he caressed her as with
an ingenuous pride he passed through his fingers the rings of her
dark hair.</p>

<p>Outside the trees rustled in a rising wind, the bare branches
crossing and recrossing beneath the fiery sky, and on the heavy
sombreness of the runic cross the sunset light lay in a stain like
ancient blood.</p>

<p>Sarsfield thought of what this approaching autumn night would
bring of agony and despair for many in Ireland and a tenderness of
superhuman pity drew him towards the woman. She was Ireland herself
that he pressed to his bosom. It was she then who took his cold,
firm face between her long hands and gazed at it intently, while
her whole body seemed broken with languor and sweet submission, as
she murmured:</p>

<p>"I cannot remember when I loved you for the first time, it is so
long ago."</p>

<p>He said farewell almost with indifference, it was as if nothing
now could further move him. He left her in the darkening room; he
was conscious of the dwarf woman Brighita Begg and his body-servant
standing by the well, and of Brian, the dog, the two human beings
talking and the dog sleeping, the autumn wind blowing over all of
them, and the cross gaunt and dark above.</p>

<p>Sarsfield entered the church but could not pray, a confusion was
between him and God, but he leant against the humble wall full of a
lassitude that seemed as vast as the earth and sky. The priest was
there, placid in the shadows. He spoke to him, kindly and
respectfully, seeming not to notice his emotion. But Sarsfield,
without concealment of his pain, said:</p>

<p>"The young gentlewoman&mdash;how does she live, how does she conduct
herself? There is not too much suffering, too much loneliness?"</p>

<p>The priest replied gravely: "It is a saint, one of those sent to
show us what the angels are."</p>

<p>Sarsfield did not smile at the extravagance of his language. He
said faintly:</p>

<p>"I think she is one of the sidhe, of the unseen people, father;
I doubt if she is a mortal at all."</p>

<p>But the priest, with some reproach, replied:</p>

<p>"But the unseen people have no souls and this young gentlewoman
is no pagan, but a pious Christian. If prayers could save
Ireland&mdash;" He shook his heavy head sadly. "She lives in another
world than ours," he added.</p>

<p>Sarsfield felt as if he were losing control of his senses, as if
all the arduous, monotonous work of the campaign was now suddenly,
in one burden, weighing on his shoulders; the peace of this place
affected him like a blow shattering his fortitude; the livid red
had faded from the sky, a glacial blue overspread the vista behind
the long allées which now began to be obscured in deep shade; they
were like endless roads to nowhere. The feeble wind increased in
force. Sarsfield spoke in a low voice not to trouble the charm of
this immense solitude.</p>

<p>"You will take care of her, my father?"</p>

<p>"She shall have everything she wants." The old man inclined his
rough head.</p>

<p>"My soul is disarmed before you, and I need give neither
explanations nor excuses; you have seen her, you know her."</p>

<p>Sarsfield made an effort to forget his lassitude; he conquered
the almost unconquerable desire to return to the woman and lie on
the floor at her feet on a pillow of fern, and sleep away the
fatigue, misery, the despair and delusion.</p>

<p>But he took his horse from his body-servant and rode to Dublin,
slowly, under the bare trees along the gray Liffey.</p>

<p>His wife made some delay about receiving him. He guessed that
some one had told her that he had gone first to Lucan. He was
distressed and even angry that she should be thus disturbed.</p>

<p>When at last he did see her he was moved by her look of
ill-health, the more touching compared with the delicate robustness
of Ishma. In a few months his child would be born; she admitted in
despair that she had led a life gay and fatiguing, that she had
gone from routs to balls, gaming parties, riding parties, and
danced till the dawn, regardless of prudence, of decorum, of his
wishes; she seemed to have found the brave pact she had made with
him impossible to keep.</p>

<p>"What else is one to do?" she asked. "There is nothing in my
life but pleasure."</p>

<p>She looked at him defiantly, daring him to reproach her, but he
sensed the pain behind the words and was silent.</p>

<p>That evening he did not share her chamber; all was prepared for
him in his closet; their separation seemed complete.</p>

<p>When all were abed, he stayed late in the oratory; he still
cherished the king's relic, though it was probable that James had
himself forgotten it, and even that he had put his trust in
Sarsfield.</p>

<p>"But what matters that if I remember?"</p>

<br>

<p class="poem">O bone Jesu, exaudi me.<br>
Intra tua vulnera absconde me.<br>
Ne permittas me separari a te.<br>
Ab hoste maligno defende me."</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-25" id="ch1-25"></a>TWENTY-FIVE</h2>

<p class="first">
THE JACOBITES kept their winter quarters in Dublin with a show
of worldly grandeur as if they had accomplished some stupendous
victory and seemed alike regardless of the miseries of the country
and of the uncertainties of the future.</p>

<p>The sober men among them advised, with bitterness and vexation,
a greater prudence and a more stringent care, pointing out that now
was the moment to recruit the troops, see to their health and
comfort, and look out supplies for the forthcoming campaign.</p>

<p>But confident in the retreat of Schomberg and in the news from
England, which seemed to indicate that the usurping prince would
not be spared from the conflict of politics to come in person to
Ireland, King James's officers gave themselves up to those lewd and
unrestrained diversions which always form the interludes of any
internecine warfare. It was playing on the edge of an abyss and
spending the last reserves of treasure, health and material in
pleasure. For Louvois and his master, Louis, thinking they had
already lavished away enough money in Ireland, sent no further
supplies. D'Avaux, who had pushed disagreement with King James to
an extremity, confided to Sarsfield his intention of returning in
the spring; he felt that he could no longer serve his master in a
country abandoned even by her own patriots.</p>

<p>"I had hopes of you, Colonel Sarsfield," he said frankly; "but
it seems you can do nothing."</p>

<p>"What I have been asked to do I have done. I am holding
Connaught and Galway."</p>

<p>277</p>

<p>"What you do not do," replied D'Avaux sombrely, "is not done,
and it's impossible for one man&mdash;" He checked, and added: "Unless
he has supreme power, to save the country. If you were in King
James's place"&mdash;he smiled&mdash;"or even in that of the Duke of
Berwick&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sarsfield started and thought of Henry Luttrell's schemes; he
wondered whimsically if the Frenchman would be his guide and
inspiration supposing he were to stand out for his own hand? but
the thought passed as quickly as it had come, for he knew it was
not in the least the French policy to consider Ireland, but only to
keep King James there as a means of vexing and distracting
England.</p>

<p>"You are disappointed in us," he declared, "you feel that we
have treated you meanly, muddled you in your expectations. Believe
me," he added with force, "we also have been a little deceived.
Your assistance, my dear Count, has never been sufficient. A few
more men, a little more money, and we might have beaten not only
the Protestant colonists but Schomberg himself."</p>

<p>D'Avaux admitted frankly:</p>

<p>"You know we have played for time. Schomberg's army is dying of
disease and want. The Prince of Orange will find it more and more
difficult to send assistance and supplies. He has already been
severely hampered in his continental campaign&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sarsfield interrupted impatiently:</p>

<p>"All this I know. And you must be aware, my dear count, that
while you stand for France, I stand for Ireland."</p>

<p>D'Avaux looked at him keenly, and added softly:</p>

<p>"I have heard something of this."</p>

<p>"Of what?" asked Sarsfield quickly.</p>

<p>"That you intended to set yourself up regardless of us. And yet
I take you to be a man of too great a sense to ferment new broils
at such a time as this."</p>

<p>"Who told you this? From whom did you get your information? It
is untrue that I have done anything outside my duty. This is not a
boast," he added sternly, "for I begin to think that I may have
been a fool in my restraint."</p>

<p>"I have had Henry Luttrell watched and spied upon, some of my
information comes from a woman, I believe you know who. She holds a
salon in Dublin and is very useful to me."</p>

<p>"Madame de Bonnac," murmured Sarsfield involuntarily.</p>

<p>"I speak no names. Henry Luttrell is a man full of upstart
inventions, using many seductive arguments and eager
importunities&mdash;"</p>

<p>"None of them prevail with me," broke in Sarsfield shortly. "I
have no intrigues to confess to you. I am content to serve King
James, to oust the Protestants and keep off the English, and I
trust to the honour of France to see that when we have conquered,
Ireland gets her rights."</p>

<p>"Have you found many people concerned in the rights of Ireland?"
asked D'Avaux shrewdly; "even myself I am only interested so far as
I can make your patriotism serve my cause. You see, I am frank and
would not fool a man of your quality."</p>

<p>"Fickle are the friendships of great men," smiled Sarsfield,
"our mutual endearments have only been for our mutual advantages.
But I remain unshaken in my duty, which is to King James."</p>

<p>"Not to King Louis?"</p>

<p>"I am not a subject of His Most Christian Majesty."</p>

<p>"Do not let any one put it into your head that you can do
without my master, he is as necessary to Ireland as he is to
Christendom."</p>

<p>"We speak from different points of the compass," smiled
Sarsfield, "but have no spiteful surmises of me."</p>

<p>"I have none," said the Frenchman, "I treat you as a man of
honour."</p>

<p>"But what you have said has been meant as a warning, and as such
I take it. As for Henry Luttrell, he is a friend of mine and, I
believe, a good patriot, but his notions are often
fantastical."</p>

<p>He paused, drawing on his gloves, then raised his wide gray eyes
and asked with candour:</p>

<p>"Does Madame de Bonnac play the spy?"</p>

<p>"You should know her better than I," evaded D'Avaux. Then he
said irrelevantly: "Her husband is a man of the strictest probity.
As for Madame de Bonnac," he laughed wryly, "she has all the
virtues and good qualities that belong to a woman of her dignity,
her condition well declares the same. As for more on this matter I
must humbly beseech you to spare me; for yourself I had thought,
Colonel Sarsfield, that it would be well for you to leave Ireland
and to command one of the Irish regiments which are to be sent to
France for the use of His Most Christian Majesty. I have already
approached the king on this subject, and though he seemed loth to
lose so good an officer I believe I can persuade him to this
end."</p>

<p>"But I," said Sarsfield, "would refuse any service outside my
own country." And on that they parted; each felt that neither could
any longer serve the other, and that the formal friendship was at
an end; but mutual respect remained.</p>

<p>Sarsfield went directly to Madame de Bonnac. He had avoided her
withdrawing-room where the most sumptuous company in Dublin was to
be found, but now he felt bound to face her on this subtle and
vital matter.</p>

<p>He walked through streets full of vile characters and
over-dressed, overfed men and women loaded with ornaments,
contemptuous French officers, English and Scotch refugees, Jews,
beggars displaying their sores, pimps, agents, spies and all the
refuse that will gather where there may be some carcase to pick,
all the birds of prey who will hover to dip their bloody heads into
corruption, and found himself, with a sick sense of loathing, in
the presence of the beautiful woman who had been so long his secret
desire, but for many months now nothing to him.</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac showed beautiful indeed, flourishing in the
full bloom of her maturity; her vivid complexion, her brilliant
hair, the vermilion of her lips, and the whiteness of her
complexion again reminded him of a rose in snow.</p>

<p>It was the afternoon and she was expecting a press of company;
her salon was gorgeously apparelled; she seemed to be spending her
husband's fortune as lavishly as Honor was spending
Sarsfield's...Her robe, of royal purple, Ballooned with gold,
lacked no cunning art to set off the voluptuous loveliness of her
figure.</p>

<p>"I wonder, madame," said Sarsfieid, "that you care to stay in
Dublin where all is either miserable or full of lewd practices,
where you must see every day a hundred hideous and humiliating
sights. Would you not be better esteemed and better entertained in
Paris?"</p>

<p>"You speak in a tone of rebuke," she cried, "as if you would put
me to shame. What have you against me?"</p>

<p>To this direct challenge he replied:</p>

<p>"I believe you have meddled in my affairs. I have been flatly
told so by Mons. d'Avaux, and I would have you consider your
modesty and not venture into these disorderly politics, and if you
endeavour to draw me into any intrigue or to suffer it to be said
that I am already in them you do me and yourself wrong, and it is
all a weariness."</p>

<p>"Speak to Henry Luttrell, not to me. He has repeated to me some
conversations you have had together."</p>

<p>"Henry Luttrell will sometimes outsay truth and bury it under a
heap of lies and slander."</p>

<p>Gazing at him with her beautiful clear eyes which appeared never
to have been vexed or troubled, she replied:</p>

<p>"You are foolish not to listen to Henry Luttrell; he is a wiser
man than you."</p>

<p>"Let him, then, take the place he designs for me. Let him set
himself up as a rebel against King James and call together a herd
of rapparees and gallow-glasses."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Madame de Bonnac contemptuously, "you were always one
to talk and dream, and so will accomplish nothing. Henry Luttrell
is a man who will succeed in the world."</p>

<p>"Let him succeed. I like neither his temper nor his advice."</p>

<p>Walking about this apartment rich with the luxury so hateful to
him, he added:</p>

<p>"It is not a man like Henry Luttrell who will cure our
distemper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But a man like you supported by Henry Luttrell," she put in
quickly, "might do so."</p>

<p>"Aye, and so be horribly dishonoured," cried Sarsfield
impetuously. He paused in front of Madame de Bonnac and looked at
her with amazement. It seemed so strange to him that since his love
for her had vanished he had seen her with other eyes, as very
beautiful but very alien; he could hardly believe she was the same
woman whom he had left with tears and anguish in the old mansion of
the MacCarthys while the rainbow spanned the hills and the willows
drooped over the lush grass on the lawn&mdash;the same woman for whom he
had waited in the ruins of Irrelagh, where instead his own true
secret love had come.</p>

<p>"What is your count in this?" he asked. "You are no Irish
patriot and by serving me or Henry Luttrell in some fantastical
rebellion you do damage to your own cause, and your own kin. It
does not require such complications."</p>

<p>"Henry Luttrell," replied Madame de Bonnac, "has done you good
service in swaggering in your interest, and do not you endeavour so
to varnish over your heart and soul to me, sir. Well I know you.
You now play cold chastity with me whom once you desired, yet out
of idleness would not take."</p>

<p>Her displayed bosom heaved, her eyes sparkled, she seemed in a
passion she could not restrain.</p>

<p>"With ingenuity and quaint invention you denied yourself to me,"
she said; "you are a strange man, and I am tormented that I do care
for you. Yet play not the saint with me, it is not for your wife's
sake that you leave me, but for that of your peasant mistress whom
you keep so snug in Lucan. How many times did you visit her during
the last campaign?"</p>

<p>He beheld her as but a vulgar fair vanity, yet because he had
once held her so high he was ashamed, and could not rebuke her for
her words.</p>

<p>"We have never understood each other, but, believe me, I have
never regarded you with lustful covetousness. My love for you was
of a different nature."</p>

<p>"<i>Was?</i>" she cried, clapping her hands together. "Is it
then no more?"</p>

<p>"No more indeed," he replied gravely, "than that I may give to
any woman who is fair and of good report. No man could look on you
and not find you lovely, but for me, I have changed."</p>

<p>"But I can change you back again," she declared, with a proud
smile. "It is impossible that we have been completely and for ever
parted. But you must not play the hypocrite with me, sir, your
little wife is nothing to you.</p>

<p>"She is much to me. I think of her continually, day and night; I
feel towards her a vast responsibility."</p>

<p>"She feels little towards you, I think," sneered Madame de
Bonnac. "Do you know how often she has seen young Berwick while you
have been campaigning? I have seen them exchanging looks, she at
her harpsichord, and he with his music, too, their sighs, and their
hands touching."</p>

<p>"This affects me nothing. I trust in her honour as in my
own."</p>

<p>"So self-confident and so flourishing!" smiled Madame de
Bonnac.</p>

<p>"So sure of her, madame, and so sure of myself. Meddle not with
me nor with my marriage, meddle not with Henry Luttrell's
fantastical schemes."</p>

<p>"Your little mistress," she cried bitterly, "has you fast
indeed; by now I had thought that over."</p>

<p>"Madame," replied Sarsfield mournfully, "I thought of you once
very well, even as a garden of delight, and give me not this pain
to hear you befoul yourself."</p>

<p>"'Tis another woman I befoul!" she said fiercely.</p>

<p>"That you cannot do. The girl of whom you speak is so little of
the world that no slander can soil even the hem of her
garment."</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac threw back her fair head with a hard and
painful laugh. She said coarsely:</p>

<p>"I dare swear 'tis only an earthen drinking-pot that a blow
would shatter!"</p>

<p>Sarsfield turned away with sad disgust. This gorgeous woman
seemed to him then as detestable as she had once been desirable. He
said:</p>

<p>"I think to take my wife away from Dublin. It has become a
sottish place full of impostures and devilry, and never have I
loved this alien city; therefore, it is not likely that we shall
meet often. I would we could part with goodwill, Madame de Bonnac,
for the sake of the dreams you once gave me."</p>

<p>"Oh, your dreams! Your dreams!"</p>

<p>This seemed to Sarsfield to come to but a wrangle; he would have
broken it short and, gathering all his forces, he turned on Madame
de Bonnac and with stately composure reminded her "not to interfere
in his affairs, nor to intrigue in his name with Henry Luttrell,
for I will have none of it&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she interrupted, approached him impetuously and cast herself
against him, so that he felt, close to his heart, her warm bosom,
her satin gown, her delicate weight, and sensed in his nostrils the
perfume she used; her carefully-dressed locks of shining hair were
against his lips. Her ill temper was gone or was controlled. With
pleading wilfulness she laughed and said:</p>

<p>"My love, could I not be more to you than that stupid peasant,
whom all call a half-wit? What do you expect to get from your
designs? Trophies of pride, of victory? I tell you there will be
none, your country is lost and damned! But we are very free to take
some pleasure."</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield did not need to put her by, so little she
tempted him; he suffered her to remain leaning against him and
smiled down at her. How less than nothing she meant to him! Even
her beauty did not seem so fair and tempting as it had when he had
first entered her room. He looked upon her naked breasts and
shoulders, her ruffling and fantastic garb, her patches and
painting, her curlings and crispings, as so many fooleries...And
she, shrewd enough, felt this indifference a worse beggary than if
he had violently repulsed her...</p>

<p>She withdrew and seated herself at a table of rich-coloured
marble, cunningly devised to show up the roundness and whiteness of
her arm, and for a moment she forgot her arts and said with real
pain:</p>

<p>"Is it possible that you leave me to go to that dull creature
you have hidden in Lucan?"</p>

<p>"I leave you, madame, and very easily, but I have no mistress
hid in Lucan nor in any other quarter of the globe, and who spreads
such a beastly scandal spreads an abominable falsehood; so much I
can vouch on good authority."</p>

<p>He added sternly: "And so much you know, madame, by your proper
wit, what you have said was but an invention to draw me."</p>

<p>"Why, no," she cried, with apparent sincerity, "nothing of the
kind! I cannot believe that there is not love between you and that
girl. I have watched you both&mdash;I know, but for her you had been all
mine&mdash;'tis love, I say!"</p>

<p>Sarsfield thought: "Aye, but what manner of love? Is it possible
Olivia cannot conceive a pure affection?"</p>

<p>He pitied her for this lack and, looking at her, he thought she
could not understand any simple or pure affection, but only a
voluptuous and carnal appetite. Do what she would, wring her hands
and plead with him, even in a vague way threaten him as if she
would thus demolish his constancy, by any means, even those without
dignity or grace...she could not move him...</p>

<p>He left her with a stately courtesy, the more stinging to her as
it showed she had not in the least discomposed his steadfastness.
Only on the threshold did he repeat to her his warning, begging her
to keep a golden mean in her discourse and actions.</p>

<p>When he returned to the Castle he felt the heavy day lay idle on
him. He was surprised to find the Duke of Berwick's body-servant
waiting for him with a request that he would immediately attend His
Grace.</p>

<p>He had not spoken with Berwick in private since he had returned
him Honor's miniature.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-26" id="ch1-26"></a>TWENTY-SIX</h2>

<p class="first">
THE DUKE OF BERWICK received Patrick Sarsfield with that
courtesy which seemed a natural heritage of the Churchills. His
personality, so suave, so austere, never failed to impress the
older man. Berwick had a precocious habit of command and an air of
authority which was not ridiculous on his extreme youth. His
appointments and the care he had taken with his person set off an
attractive personality to advantage. Had it not been for the
singular beauty of his face, which was of a manly, resolute and
stately cast, he might have been accused of foppishness. Whenever
he came into the young prince's presence, Sarsfield thought of his
extreme suitability as a lord for Honor; he was sure that they had
not much, but everything, in common, and he could not control a
bitter pang at the thought of his useless marriage and the
misplaced impulsive chivalry, as foolish and as dangerous in its
way, as Berwick's misplaced prudence, which had come between these
two appointed lovers, and he thought to himself, "Should I
disappear amid the chances of war, I believe this young man, who
has now learned his lesson, would marry her," and he hoped that it
might be so.</p>

<p>Berwick began by asking Sarsfield if he intended to take
advantage of D'Avaux's offer and go with the newly-raised Irish
regiments which were to sail for France? These were to form the
nucleus of an Irish Brigade in foreign service and were to be some
recompense to King Louis for the troops he had supplied for King
James's use in Ireland.</p>

<p>"You know," added Berwick, "that D'Avaux and De Rosen are both
to be recalled&mdash;they have been failures."</p>

<p>"It has scarcely been their fault."</p>

<p>"No, but possibly the fault of the people they have come to
help. D'Avaux himself says that he was sent to be a sacrifice to a
poor-spirited and cowardly people, whose soldiers would never
fight, whose officers would never preserve order."</p>

<p>"My lord duke," said Sarsfield, "I am Irish and, though well
inured to insult, that was needless."</p>

<p>Berwick shrugged. "I have heard," he said, "that Lauzun is to be
sent in place of De Rosen."</p>

<p>Sarsfield felt a shoot of despair. The Duke of Lauzun, an
eccentric adventurer, was well known to be useless as a general and
unreliable and fantastic as a man.</p>

<p>"It is His Majesty," said Berwick, "who naturally has conceived
a great affection for Mons. de Lauzun because he contrived the
escape of the queen from London."</p>

<p>"A mountebank courtier like that!" exclaimed Sarsfield
softly.</p>

<p>"But to come to our affairs and the reason for which I have
asked of you this interview. You know something," he said, with dry
precision unsuited to his years, "of our situation. You have heard
great tales of the stresses on the other side, of how Shale,
Schomberg's Commissary-General, has behaved, but you must confess
that our own Lord Dover is no better. He has no magazines or depots
and is forced to import breadstuff, his staff-officers quarrel
among themselves, with De Rosen, with the Government, and with the
king; the officials are enriching themselves at the expense of the
public."</p>

<p>"I well know," said Sarsfield bitterly, "that more soldiers
exist on paper than ever appear on the parade ground; that I, and
Hamilton, and Luttrell, and, I think," he added with reluctance,
"Lord Galmoy alone have well-disciplined troops."</p>

<p>"We shall need them," said Berwick with still greater dryness.
"I believe that the Prince of Orange gathers a formidable troop and
is well aware that on the next Irish campaign may depend the fate
of Europe&mdash;he regards it as the scene of an international struggle
and realises that for him, as well as for us, all is at stake. We
must not expect," continued the young duke, "any very great help
from King Louis, for I am sure D'Avaux's report has been to the
effect that money sent here will be money wasted."</p>

<p>"My lord, have you asked me here to discuss these miseries and
uncertainties? It seems to me that neither you nor I are in a
position to remedy them."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for the women," remarked Berwick; for all his
composure he showed a slight sign of emotion, his candid brow was
troubled, a faint flush stained the long, smooth,
olive-complexioned face.</p>

<p>"He loves her," thought Sarsfield, "and he bears it with
fortitude."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am sorry for the women," he repeated aloud. "But you,
sir, have none to your account, and I do the best for those who
depend on me."</p>

<p>Berwick added, not without a deepening of his flush:</p>

<p>"'Twere well that the Lady Honor Sarsfield were sent to Lucan,
Dublin is no fit place for a gentlewoman of her breeding. The court
has become corrupt and dissolute. They all behave as if they had
lost control of their destiny and were riding with loose reins to
the devil."</p>

<p>He spoke with a personal bitterness that Sarsfield could well
interpret, for the king had returned to his former ways of dull
licentiousness and had taken for his mistresses two women of
ill-repute in Dublin, such as were contemptuously termed "old
trollops"; these accompanied him everywhere and contended with his
confessor and his attendant priests for his confidence. Berwick's
brother, too, had taken on a lewd and foolish course. His brawls
were of daily occurrence and more than once he had insulted
officers in a coffee-house or the street. There had been an
occasion when the most open and deadly scandal had been saved only
by the smooth intervention of Henry Luttrell. The vicereine, too,
was light and gay, and her daughters thought of nothing but
pleasure; honesty and good manners seemed to be alike considered of
no value.</p>

<p>"I cannot take my wife to Lucan since she has conceived some
dislike of the place and will not go."</p>

<p>"Is that your honest reason?" asked Berwick, in such a tone of
authority that Sarsfield flashed into a haughty reply. "What right
have you, my lord, to question me?"</p>

<p>The young man did not flinch nor abase his princely air as he
replied in formal stateliness:</p>

<p>"The right of one who has always had the welfare of Lady Honor
close to his heart."</p>

<p>"Too close, perhaps, my lord," said Sarsfield with a bitter
smile. "You forget that if I were not very tolerant we might have
crossed swords on this affair. But I have had a greater work in
hand than to concern myself with the disaster of my marriage."</p>

<p>"You admit that it was a disaster?"</p>

<p>"To me, to her and, I think, to you," replied Sarsfield heavily,
turning away and leaning in the window-place. "But it is done and
may not be undone. You know how I regard the vows I took."</p>

<p>"I know how she regards them," said Berwick dryly. "No man could
have a more faithful wife."</p>

<p>"He who doubted it would be a dolthead, but you may believe, my
lord, that this is not a matter I can easily discuss. I have been
blasted by many untoward affairs. The lady's interests are now
twisted inseparably with mine."</p>

<p>"Therefore I do request you," said Berwick, "consider removing
her from Dublin to your estates where you are fortunate enough to
have some peace and quietness away from this frenzied extravagance
which here undoes all sober men."</p>

<p>Sarsfield repeated:</p>

<p>"She will not go."</p>

<p>"But must she stay here?" asked the duke with a rising passion,
"among the bankrupts, sots and cullies, the upstarts and bullies
who fill the castle and the city?"</p>

<p>"I think, sir, we play at cross-purposes. I know the mind of my
wife."</p>

<p>A sudden violent antagonism flashed out between the two men.
Sarsfield, though so much the older and admiring the youth, could
not altogether control his sense of deep dislike of this cold and
stately antagonist.</p>

<p>"Do not domineer, my lord," he added dryly.</p>

<p>And Berwick, not yielding an inch, said:</p>

<p>"I have heard some scandalous report, that the Lady Honor cannot
go to Lucan because you keep a mistress there."</p>

<p>"Madame de Bonnac told you that," replied Sarsfield, smiling
with pale lips. "I do ignore it. You become tedious, my lord duke,
you shall lay no plot nor trap to seize my good temper."</p>

<p>Berwick controlled himself with admirable strength of mind and
skilfully turned the subject:</p>

<p>"I have another matter on which to speak to you. It may be that
is also a libel."</p>

<p>He put his handkerchief to his full lips and his dark eyes were
full of a suppressed passion.</p>

<p>"I believe you intrigue, Colonel Sarsfield, and leave the
management of it to Henry Luttrell."</p>

<p>"This matter seems very well noised abroad. Have we not enough
troubles on our hands that we must embroil ourselves in these
private stupidities? Might not you, my lord duke, as well as
myself, better manage our time by making some preparation for the
invading army which is like to be on us in the spring than by
exchanging gossip of the chitcats?"</p>

<p>"I knew you would outface this," replied Berwick coldly, "but I
am well aware of what truth there is behind this smoke of rumour. I
myself have been approached," he added.</p>

<p>This startled Sarsfield; Luttrell then was deeper, more
determined than he thought.</p>

<p>"Henry Luttrell has been to me. He thinks the king means nothing
and is already disliked in Ireland. He knows that the French are
not popular, but he sees a nation in arms and would find a
leader."</p>

<p>"He has suggested your grace as this leader?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Berwick, "with insinuation and oblique temptation.
But I am a plain man and would have none working secretly for my
advantage. I am," he added with great pride, "ever likely to stand
alone, and I do not doubt my ability to do so."</p>

<p>"None deny you brilliant gifts," said Sarsfield coldly. "But why
tell me, my lord, what must have filled you with abhorrence? Of all
men you are the last who should make a clamour against your
father."</p>

<p>He added, with a rising impatience:</p>

<p>"These intrigues of Henry Luttrell seem to me but a ridiculous
impertinence."</p>

<p>"Have you told him so?"</p>

<p>"I have put off all his notions as mere fantasy."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that. I spoke to you because of the friendship I
have for you, an interest in your fortunes, and I would not have
you entangle yourself. I wish to give you warning, too, that if you
do intrigue and it comes to my knowledge, I shall publicly denounce
you."</p>

<p>"Why speak of friendship when your grace means me to understand
that you are my enemy?"</p>

<p>Berwick looked at him, and a softer passion seemed to show in
his large dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Forgive me if I speak with some heat," he said, with even more
than his wonted stateliness yet in a gentle manner, "for I have
found these last months but a miserable time of frustration and
have been robbed and foiled," he continued in anguish and
heaviness.</p>

<p>"My lord," replied Sarsfield, "not you alone, but I, too. You
can assure yourself that not the highest seat of all honour or the
most princely place of dignity could, by devised practices and
false, deceitful, wild subtlety, be attempted by me."</p>

<p>"I believe you," replied the duke, "and will listen no more to
anything that Henry Luttrell says, for I take him to be a man most
rampant and mischievous in evil working."</p>

<p>"I do not understand him," admitted Sarsfield, "he has ever
seemed a friend of mine and I liked the fellow. Maybe he is moved
by patriotism and that <i>you</i> would scarce understand, your
grace. There are some of us who feel that even King James is not
the real master of Ireland. But let that go, I do not think it
moves Henry Luttrell, though he has always passed as a gentleman of
good credit, yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One day he will be of very ill repute."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry that this has arisen. I see around me such a
darkness in our affairs, such intriguers, jobbers and the devil
knows what, that it is impossible to find the root of the
matter."</p>

<p>"We thus must go on from day to day," said Berwick, "and hope
for a victory next campaign."</p>

<p>"We do not seem to be preparing for one."</p>

<p>The young man replied with his gracious seriousness: "We must do
what we can for the conservation of the Catholic Faith and the
sustaining of God's Honour."</p>

<p>"Amen," said Sarsfield proudly, and leaving the chamber he
added: "Make no unjust and inconsequent judgments on any incidental
passages you hear of me and any woman, my lord. Believe that the
gentlewoman, my wife, will be indulged by me in her least
conceit."</p>

<p>As he returned to his own apartments he wondered sadly if Honor
had any part in this affair. He believed not, but he was smitten to
think of the true and deep love with which Berwick seemed to regard
her, and he had no doubt that she returned it, and his mind played
over the possibility of a divorce...if he might place her in the
care of Berwick and take Ishma to his heart for ever...</p>

<p>But there was no excuse he could put forward at Rome&mdash;no
relationship, no illegality in the ceremony. And she was about to
have his child; with all his most diligent deliberations he could
see no way out for the three of them save his own death in battle.
That he would have met very readily if it were certain that there
was no more he could do for Ireland.</p>

<p>He was hardly in his own house, meaning to have a gentle
interview with Honor, for he was lonely, when the man of whom he
had just been speaking, Henry Luttrell, came upon him and insisted
on instant speech.</p>

<p>Sarsfield sat in the window-place and watched the rain that came
down in a great drench over the city. It gave him small comfort to
think of the Irish flag hanging soaked over the castle.</p>

<p>"You heard some noise and clamours of me," said Luttrell, with
his curious oblique glance and his fascinating smile, "my honour
and integrity have been assaulted. Berwick is a pragmatical young
Jesuit and Madame de Bonnac&mdash;the devil knows what she is."</p>

<p>Sarsfield replied with some heat.</p>

<p>"You have confounded me by your intrigues, nay, by what seemed
to be grossly and notoriously blown abroad, by asserting that I
have listened to any chimerical scheme. Berwick knows and Madame de
Bonnac knows, no doubt, Galmoy and other of my enemies know&mdash;if it
gets to the ears of the king or De Rosen I am but a ruined
man."</p>

<p>"Softly! softly!" exclaimed Henry Luttrell with a deepening of
his cool smile. "Hold your prating, my dear Sarsfield, or I will
take you also for a pragmatical ass if you fall foul of your only
friend. Why are you in so stiff and ill a humour? Your lady wife
promises you an heir, you have your mistress safe at Lucan&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sarsfield interrupted with bitter heat:</p>

<p>"Luttrell, you turn all to a poison, like a spider. I fear that
your roguery comes out and confounds us all."</p>

<p>"You are bat-blind and bigoted," said Luttrell. "I tell thee,
Sarsfield, once and for all, you lose a great gain for nothing. I
will not rake up sluttish stories little to your credit if such be
your will, but parade no airs of virtue! Do you intend to trudge on
like some hungry starved lieutenant, content with a mere promise of
guineas? Do you not see the state of all about us?"</p>

<p>"Madame de Bonnac and Berwick have already run over that matter
with me," replied Sarsfield. "I see what this winter in Dublin is
like to be and what the campaign to come is like to be, and I am
resolved to do the part I have undertaken. I tell you, Luttrell,"
he cried, striking his hand on the window-sill, "I, who have been
able to forego the fairest flowers that life can offer, do not
hanker after any uneasy grandeur. Go, search another for your
plots, Luttrell, if you must have such to beguile your tedium."</p>

<p>Luttrell laughed lightly, with a charming air of
good-humour.</p>

<p>"The devil helps his children," he asserted, with a swagger that
had nothing in it of affront or offence and left Sarsfield to his
gloomy meditations, and these were no less mournful and melancholy
than the rain which fell over the riot and filth of Dublin.</p>

<p>He was sorry to have lost Luttrell for a friend (it seemed he
must lose him). The man fascinated him, though he felt the
seduction of his charming manners were but shams and hypocrisies to
cover his real designs. And he remembered what Luttrell had said
that he would be Louvois to his Louis, the power behind the throne,
the subtle, corrupt, unscrupulous intriguer, working behind a
florid figurehead...</p>

<p>"My God! he takes me for less than a man," thought Sarsfield
bitterly. "The woman, too&mdash;I suppose she would be the
Montespan&mdash;the gold-glutted mistress, and I the fool between my
jackal and my doxy!"</p>

<p>He believed that he had taken an inveterate spleen against
Luttrell and could never meet the man more. That sad evening he was
heartened by a letter from his bailiff enclosing one from the
priest, which had but one line about Ishma, and that
sufficient&mdash;"She grows daily in great grace."</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-27" id="ch1-27"></a>TWENTY-SEVEN</h2>

<p class="first">
COLONEL PATRICK SARSFIELD of Lucan, on a night of storm, rode
from Dublin towards Howth across the site of the battle of
Clontarf.</p>

<p>He was pleased to leave behind the filth, the lewd pleasures,
the raucous noises and purposeless quarrels of the city.</p>

<p>He had had a sharp, a humiliating little quarrel with his wife.
She had given him a son but this had not brought them nearer
together. She had wished to call his heir James, after the king,
she said, but Sarsfield knew that it was Berwick of whom she was
thinking, and his pride of race and of manhood first refused this
concession to her secret passion, then gave way, coldly. She had
displayed a cutting indifference to the child which stung him
sorely, and, as soon as she was able to leave her room, had
returned to her mechanical pleasures; Sarsfield had endeavoured to
get in touch with her heart, with her spirit, to draw her somehow
closer in to his side; he had said:</p>

<p>"Honor, if you would like me a little?"</p>

<p>And she had replied, flaming hostility showing horribly on her
pale, painted little face:</p>

<p>"It is not that, if you could have loved me at all! What a wrong
you did me to marry me with nothing but indifference in your heart
for me! Nay, though you are so suave and pleasant with me,
sometimes I think you feel not indifference but dislike."</p>

<p>He knew the truth beneath these furious sentences. If he could
have loved her only a little he could have won her away from
Berwick. He had come to her empty-handed. And she had added
mournfully with a sense of infinite loss:</p>

<p>"You are a man who could win any woman if you wished, but you
have never wished to win me."</p>

<p>Without waiting for his reply she had returned to her gambling
parties, to her dances, her visits to mantuamakers, fortune-tellers
and theatres, leaving her child to the foster-mother and him to his
solitude.</p>

<p>So poignant had become his loneliness that he had been minded to
ride to Lucan, if only to see for one fine moment the pure face of
the woman from Irrelagh. At the very gate of the city he had
checked and turned in another direction. He believed that it was
already whispered that his wife could not go to his demesne because
he kept a secret mistress there.</p>

<p>Though he was exalted above the petty stings of gossip (from
which he knew none was exempt), he could not endure to give this
handle to lies about Ishma. So he rode out along the great tongue
of land which stretched beyond the city round the bay across the
site where the black ravens of the Danes had been beaten down and
trampled in the bloody mud by the forces of King Brian Boru.</p>

<p>A storm was coming up from the distant sea which was usually of
a celestial blue, so calm, so hazed with pearl-like mist that it
seemed incredible it should wash the shores of the man-made city of
Dublin.</p>

<p>The moon was high overhead, cold, blue and sharp as ice,
floating in the chill and mist of the distant heavens. Around this
space where the moon shone, the storm-clouds scudded, above, then
before the silver light of the remote orb, leaving the lonely rider
for a space in almost complete darkness.</p>

<p>His senses were very acute. He thought he could distinguish the
separate sound of each leaf that trembled on the trees which formed
a mournful broken avenue beyond the city gates. Then he was
bereaved even of the trees and out upon the low-lying marshland
which led to the rock of Howth. The moon conquered the clouds and
the night was not altogether sombre, though the lower sky darkened
as Sarsfield rode towards the sea.</p>

<p>A convulsive flame darting along the horizon lit up the great
mass of the rock of Howth and the pale line of the midnight ocean
beyond. This livid landscape shown by the lightning was like an
hallucination, a vision forced on the misty obscurity of the
moonlight. The gusty wind caught Sarsfield's light mantle, his
thick hair and the harsh mane of his horse and blew all
seaward.</p>

<p>The man felt an immense desire to be free of his life, to leap
exultant into the abyss of death; yes, he was like a slave chained
by the feet to the ground, while all his body and soul were
straining for liberty.</p>

<p>The thunder rumbled over the ancient battlefield. Sarsfield
believed that an invisible company of dead warriors were crowding
about him, gigantic in stature, massive in form, brandishing bloody
spears, erect, superb and terrible for the defence of Ireland.
Though it was early spring the day had been cold, but the storm had
brought an unnatural heat as if the burning breath of some
crouching monster poisoned all the air; yet when the moon showed in
the rifts of the tempest clouds it was cold, icy, very far
away.</p>

<p>Sarsfield heard the alarmed cry of a bird which flew over his
head into the darkness, the cracking and bending of the low scrub
bushes before the wind, and on his hand felt the first drops of
rain. The silence between the distant claps of thunder was
frightful and charged with menace. He rode on.</p>

<p>"Who is riding beside me?" said Patrick Sarsfield, not knowing
he spoke.</p>

<p>His gray eyes were wide, his senses alert; he seemed to be
surrounded by a supernatural light, to be attended by a
supernatural company.</p>

<p>He thought of the dead Irish kings buried under the wet gray
marble of the abbey of Irrelagh, of the unseen people, the sidhe,
in whom every one of Irish birth believed; like a monstrous drum,
summoning the huge army of dead warriors, the distant storm beat
across the sea, like the torn banners of innumerable defeats the
lightning flashed convulsively across the hurrying blackness of the
clouds.</p>

<p>The moon was swiftly obscured by veil on veil of vapour; and all
Patrick Sarsfield's dreams and reveries, sprung from solitude and
enchantment, that he so sternly banished in the world of what men
called real affairs, gathered round him, pressing close to his
saddle.</p>

<p>He was tormented, yet in the midst of his torment he had a sense
of inner peace. He listened to his own heart-beats, regular as
those of a sleeping man. In the midst of his misery he felt
submissive, resigned; but it was difficult to resist the impulse to
ride on and on until his horse trod the wet sands, until the
lashing foam of the sea began to flicker in his face.</p>

<p>"Have I not already expressed all my soul? Have I not already
exhausted all my pains? May I not slip into the beautiful abyss of
death without reproach from any?"</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield crossed himself on his brow and looked up at
the faint light of the moon, veiled more and more deeply by the
hurrying storm. It was like the pale impassive face of God
withdrawn before the darknesses cast upward by the passions of
men.</p>

<p>He prayed, for his faith was always strong within him. The
hordes of stern and valiant spirits were at the same time superb
and beautiful, they seemed to drag at him by the bridle, to pull
him across the ancient battlefield towards the cold oblivion of the
sea and to whisper in his ear through the long-blown tresses of
their hair, their nodding tattered plumes, that "his work was done
and his country lost, that he might now take his rest."</p>

<p>But he thought, though heart and soul responded to this wild
appeal:</p>

<p>"She lives, the woman lives and prays for me."</p>

<p>In that thought, through all his grief and disarray, was
comfort. "But what can I do? I am helpless, overborne. I will
neither be the puppet of another man's intrigue nor a frantic rebel
against authority; yet how can those I serve help Ireland?"</p>

<p>The moon and her light disappeared entirely. The horse started
as the rain fell straight on him with a steady sound as imposing
and as frightful as the silence which had preceded the
downpour.</p>

<p>"Who has anything to reproach me with?" asked Sarsfield of his
invisible companions. "I have betrayed none, not willingly have I
made any one suffer. Must I spend more years of unease, of agony,
of suspense, of delusion?"</p>

<p>Through the rain the gigantic spirits seemed to grow more
imperious and more threatening; they shook their plumed heads and
appeared to urge him to snatch at final peace.</p>

<p>"Here we fought for Ireland, here we conquered. And what did it
avail? How often has the victor trod above our dust! Our exploits
are become tales for the chimney-corner, our names are the names of
forgotten people, our wounds and our deaths benefited none. And so
shall it be with thee."</p>

<p>Sarsfield turned his head to listen; the horse went slowly
through the dark; the lightning showed fainter; it lit in greenish
pallor a phantom sea, a high dark rock, an ancient battlefield.</p>

<p>"Meet the embraces of the waves, let them draw thee down to
slumber, it is good to sleep. What wilt thou have at best for all
thy labour, self-sacrifice and tears? A little sleep...Take it
now."</p>

<p>Sarsfield thought that Prince O'Donaghoe paced beside him on the
white horse on which he was wont to ride across the waters by
Innisfallen.</p>

<p>"I am come for thee, descendant of Conall, because thou hast
cherished my little daughter in her beauty, because thou hast left
her innocence and pride about her like the petals about a lily. I,
too, loved Ireland well."</p>

<p>Across the moon mist showed a kingly face, a glittering coronal,
the sparkling eyeballs, the floating mane of a daemon steed, white
as bleached bone.</p>

<p>"Shall I not fetch for thee my little maiden so that she may
sleep with thee, resting forever in thy clasp of love?"</p>

<p>"I am a haunted man," said Sarsfield aloud. By his ears rushed
the voices of many spirits urging him to ride into the ocean; the
storm was a little stayed; the moonlight was cold as snow on the
rock of Howth and on the tossed-up foam of the flashing sea.</p>

<p>The phantoms dissolved into the moonbeams; their voices became
one with the rise and fall of the waves.</p>

<p>The rain ceased as suddenly as it had begun, the last clouds
were torn asunder and the moon appeared with a vaporous light
which, to Sarsfield's exalted gaze, took the form of a cross. That
was all, that was enough; his agony returned. It was not for him to
seek ease by forbidden ways.</p>

<p>"My dreams are too powerful, too dear, too poignant and too
close. I must never allow them again nearly to gain the
mastery."</p>

<p>There came again to his lips the prayer of Saint Ignatius which
he had uttered in Honor's little oratory:</p>

<br>

<p class="poem">"Anima Christi, sanctifica me,<br>
Corpus Christi, salve me,<br>
Sanguis Christi, inebria me,<br>
Aqua lateris Christi, lava me,<br>
Passio Christi, comforta me."</p>

<br>

<p>"If she lives and is not afraid to suffer constantly, may not I
endure a little longer a great pain? Because nothing is understood
much must be borne, while life has me in thrall I must obey."</p>

<p>He thought he heard his own words taken away on a gust of wind;
yet knew not if he himself or another had spoken.</p>

<p>Sarsfield reined up the obedient horse, he stroked the animal's
wet neck and turned his head towards the foul city; the beautiful
creature was not frightened, surely there had been no evil
abroad.</p>

<p>"But I cannot return to that woman whom I do not love and who
does not love me."</p>

<p>The rain had stirred a melancholy perfume from the marshy earth,
flavoured, Sarsfield thought, with the ancient blood of those
long-dead Irish over whose bones his horse must be treading. With
the pause in the rain the wind had risen, and there was once more
the cry of frightened birds and the groaning of the dead trees, and
in the distance, accompanying the retreating thunder, the hard,
monotonous beat of the surf on the shore...a menace...a
farewell.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield evoked the image of Ishma; in his desolation
he had only his forlorn spirit to offer her; he did not even know
if she would have wished him to empty his life into the ocean.</p>

<p>She had followed him all the way, passive, modest, meek; through
the armed forces of the spirits, through the tumult of the storm
she had been beside him; she was attired like an ancient queen
seated in a great hall on a green mountain in the days when Ireland
was free, with pale native gold on her brow, pure and peaceful,
with the hues of grass and flowers blowing through her robe; tall
and serene, with fair hands folded; thus he had been taught to
believe the sidhe looked; but this woman was not one of the unseen
people who have no souls, for she looked at him with eyes clear
with the ecstasy of self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>He put out his hands towards her and held but an intangible
moonbeam which ran over his fingers with pale colours.</p>

<p>Sarsfield returned to the city; the foul smells, the coarse
incessant noises, the crude lights, the pressure of the crowds
blended into one agony for him. His desire to go to Ishma was so
powerful that he shook like a man in a fever; but he returned to
his house and went at once to his wife's chamber where she lay
wide-awake in her great bed, the coverlet sewn with wild
strawberries drawn to her chin; "frightened," she said, "of the
storm."</p>

<p>"How terrible to die young," she murmured, "if God should take
one on a night like this."</p>

<p>Sarsfield had taken off his wet cloak and she marked that even
his' undergarments were damp and stained, and that he was without
his boots; he looked at her in silent appeal for comfort and
solace.</p>

<p>"You've been riding in the wet," she said quickly, "out in the
storm."</p>

<p>She thrust herself forward, eagerly, curiously, it was seldom he
came to her; in the warm shadows of the bed-curtains she appeared
young, so sickly, without her paint, her eyes so feverishly
anxious. She coughed frequently, her voice was hoarse. He
remembered that the doctors had always had a bad opinion of her
health; perhaps she also inwardly endured much in patience.</p>

<p>"You have been riding in the storm," she repeated keenly.</p>

<p>"I was glad to get away from the city for a while, but I have
come back to you, Honor, as a refuge."</p>

<p>"To me!" Her thin pale lips receded into a wild smile. "But you
know I can give you no comfort."</p>

<p>"We should be able to comfort each other. Honor, we have both
been so deceived and cheated, we both have such difficult lives to
live. Come, my child, you know well enough that these foolish toys
and hollow pleasures of yours give you no more satisfaction than do
my monotonous duties."</p>

<p>She lay back on the pillows and turned her head away from
him.</p>

<p>"There is a question I long to ask you but may not," she
whispered, evading a reply.</p>

<p>"I know. You would demand if I have been to Lucan&mdash;'tis not so.
I have been riding out towards the sea, towards Clontarf and
Howth."</p>

<p>This was the pure truth; yet he did not feel that he could so
truthfully have told her that he had not seen Ishma O'Donaghoe.</p>

<p>He approached the bed and looked down on her; she had said that
she could give him no comfort; she was herself in need of solace;
dreadful was the thought to him that she turned from the child who
should have consoled her, because he was the father.</p>

<p>Without looking at him, sunk in the pillows, she whispered:</p>

<p>"You rode into the storm towards Clontarf?"</p>

<p>"I did not notice the storm."</p>

<p>"Your hair is wet, so is your coat, even your shirt. Why did you
go?"</p>

<p>"How shall a man say what drives him into solitude? But I have
come back to you."</p>

<p>With a violent movement Honor sat up in the bed; she clasped her
hands round her knees, her hair, usually so smooth, was shaken in
tangles over her thin shoulders.</p>

<p>"I know why you rode into the storm&mdash;withdrawn into
secrecy."</p>

<p>"Do you, Honor?"</p>

<p>He sat on the end of the great bed, far from her, and leant
against the footboard; he was a man whose strength it was difficult
to exhaust, he had an heroic cast of body; but of late he often
looked fatigued, and now he seemed completely weary.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>"Tell me then, Honor, anything, so that we may have some solid
understanding between us."</p>

<p>She replied without looking at him:</p>

<p>"Because you wished so much to go to Lucan."</p>

<p>"My wife, I would take you to Lucan; the demesne is wide and the
house large and peaceful. You would be better there than in Dublin
you and&mdash;and the child."</p>

<p>Her look of anguish and pride further bleached her already pale
face. She shook her head. He believed that she thought, as did
Madame de Bonnac, that he kept a mistress there. He said with some
sternness:</p>

<p>"I have infinitely trusted you, Honor; you might, in your
charity, trust me."</p>

<p>"I have never reproached you," she replied proudly. "I know you
married me out of chivalry and pity. I am in your debt. It is very
petty in me that I spend your fortune when you need it to fulfil
you own loyalties. But a woman must have something."</p>

<p>With fierce self-contempt she added:</p>

<p>"I have my plays, ploys, gowns and trinkets; you have your
troops, your horses, your hopes for Ireland."</p>

<p>"We both have the child," pleaded Sarsfield, full of tenderness
and compassion, leaning towards her eagerly.</p>

<p>Honor replied with a bitter coldness as if she alienated herself
deliberately from him:</p>

<p>"The child is nothing to me. Look you after the child, he is
your heir."</p>

<p>"You can help me no further than that?" he asked. He rose and
turned away from her that he might not see her sad angry face.</p>

<p>"Leave me," she said. "It has all gone beyond words."</p>

<p>"Why, then, Honor, let us come on peace at least. I'll intrude
on thee no more."</p>

<p>Honor's hoarse voice flung at him:</p>

<p>"What value has your fidelity to me? What care I if you go to
Lucan or no?"</p>

<p>"Very little, as I suppose. I have not asked nor offered
fidelity, Honor, yet neither I nor you are so easy and common as to
readily smirch what is full of grace. Why should a pledge be
honoured? You know and I know, Honor."</p>

<p>He left her. It was still early in the evening, the narrow
street was full of noise; he had hoped to find a refuge with her,
but she had barred him out.</p>

<p>He should have been dead by now; he could see his scarlet
uniform washed to and fro in the moonlit waves...the horse speeding
back to the gates...</p>

<p>He held a taper close to the reflection of his face in a mirror
in his closet.</p>

<p>"What wilt thou do now, my fool? Go down into the stews and get
drunk?"</p>

<p>He pulled on his boots, took up his hat and sword and went out
into the street and made his way to the Several Keys&mdash;a tavern much
frequented by the fashionables of Dublin.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-28" id="ch1-28"></a>TWENTY-EIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">
THE TAVERN PARLOUR that Sarsfield deliberately sought was the
antithesis of the stormy landscape of Clontarf and of the solitude
of Honor's bedchamber; it was noisy, garish, reeking of smoke,
fumes of food, of wine, and the stench of mud brought in on the
boots of the officers.</p>

<p>By the fireplace four men were gambling: Galmoy, Galway, Henry
Fitz James, Grand Prior of Malta and Duke of Albemarle, and Henry
Luttrell; behind them stood Berwick leaning against the wall, his
arms folded.</p>

<p>The three first were drunk, their eyes swollen and inflamed by
lack of sleep; the Jacobites, during their winter quartering in
Dublin, had lived in the most reckless and dissolute fashion, nor
were they much to be blamed, for all was not only confusion but
chaos; the administration of the cabinet, the army, the city, was
alike corrupt and incapable. The high-born officers, having no
duties and none, save Berwick, any ambition, spent their enforced
idleness in what they termed pleasures, devices gross or foolish
according to their natures and their means. The Duke of Albemarle,
a dissolute and useless youth, was quarrelling violently with
Galmoy, who received his insults with a half-mocking, half-amused
fashion. They were discussing some woman in the coarsest terms;
when Sarsfield approached they, drunk as they were, turned the
conversation. He wondered, with indifference, why they took this
trouble; he seated himself on the bench beside Berwick; he had
deliberately chosen this company as he had deliberately chosen the
tavern. He asked the drawer for a rummer of French brandy; it was
odd to feel the curls on his breast wet from the rain that had
blown across the field of Clontarf, and again he saw himself tossed
to and fro by the clean, lovely waves, a sparkling cascade of foam
falling on his face beneath the waxing moon. That seemed more real
than the tavern scene of which he was part; here and not beneath
the storm he was surrounded by ghosts.</p>

<p>The Duke of Albemarle threw over a bottle of claret, purposely,
Sarsfield thought, and this stupid incident absorbed them all in
foolish laughter.</p>

<p>Berwick stood apart. He was, as always, sober, and Sarsfield
wondered why he should thus waste his leisure. Ignoring his
disorderly companions he spoke with his usual cool stateliness to
Sarsfield:</p>

<p>"You have heard that De Rosen and D'Avaux are to depart
immediately, and it is decided that Lauzun is to come? We shall
take the field very soon."</p>

<p>"God be thanked for that!" said Sarsfield.</p>

<p>Lord Galmoy insolently looked up at him.</p>

<p>"Why?" he demanded. "Has it not been pleasant enough in these
winter months in Dublin?"</p>

<p>Sarsfield replied with indifferent contempt:</p>

<p>"I am glad that you have found it so, Lord Galmoy."</p>

<p>Albemarle suddenly broke into unreasoning invective:</p>

<p>"It has been agreeable for all except sour-faced knaves; we want
no lily-livered Calvinists here, whining psalms through their
noses, let such villains hang, I say!"</p>

<p>Sarsfield was conscious of a deep hostility directed against him
emanating from this young man and from Galmoy; even Galway, his
brother-in-law, seemed unfriendly. But Berwick, with the air of a
much older man, said calmly:</p>

<p>"These are but drunken tavern brawls and serious men should keep
out of them."</p>

<p>"Why are you here?" demanded Sarsfield, amused, negligent of all
of them.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have to see that my brother Albemarle does not make too
great a fool of himself."</p>

<p>Henry Luttrell glanced up, alert, cool, yet excited.</p>

<p>"There is certain news," he said, "that another English
expeditionary force will be landed in the spring."</p>

<p>"I'll lay a wager that will be denied," said Albemarle.</p>

<p>"Do you value the drivellings of the chitcats and gazetteers?
But as for Schomberg, we'll roast the old fool in bad earnest." The
youth was very drunk; he put down his cards and swayed back in his
seat. Luttrell ignored him and looked at Sarsfield; he too had been
drinking heavily enough, but never showed himself fuddled in his
senses; in contrast to the carelessness of his three companions he
was as aways neat in his attire; a certain precise grace seemed
natural to him. He mixed much in companies where wantonness and
debauchery were passports to the general favour; but himself lived
quietly, hoarding his health and his fortune. He kept a discreet
mistress in his lodgings and was supposed to entertain her more for
her house-wifely economies and careful management than her charms;
she was seldom seen, but known to sing exquisitely; Luttrell,
however, never allowed her to parade this talent; but sometimes an
idler going home at night would hear a gentle lovely voice float
out from his high-set window in Skinner's Row.</p>

<p>"You look as if you had ridden far into the storm," smiled
Colonel Luttrell, with his odd, queer, squinting glance.</p>

<p>Galmoy turned and stared at Sarsfield over his shoulder; he had
taken off his wig and hung it on the knob of his chairback; his
reddish hair was cropped close to his shapely head; drink had
brought out the brutality of his face; though handsome and finely
bred there was something ignoble about him. He began to laugh
offensively at Sarsfield, and Albemarle, in his boyish tones,
joined the gross, stupid ribaldry.</p>

<p>"They make all a mere May game and laughing-stock," remarked
Berwick scornfully. He put no gloss on his disgust. In his slightly
sneering withdrawal from the ribaldry of the others, he had an air
of his father; he reminded Sarsfield of a painting of his uncle the
Duke of Gloucester who had died young.</p>

<p>"My lord," sniggered Albemarle, "you may be packing if you would
damp down all honest mirth."</p>

<p>Galway seemed a little shamefaced, he was never quite easy in
the presence of Sarsfield; he knew that Honor's marriage was not
happy though he would not glance at that subject.</p>

<p>"You look cloudily, Patrick," he said with a foolish smile.</p>

<p>"Would you have me towering on the wind with affairs as they
are?" Sarsfield drank his brandy regardless of all of them. "One
would think ye all cannon-proof, with your childish ploys and
filthy lewd nonsense, when all's to be done."</p>

<p>"May the devil fetch me to hell in a hand-basket," swore Galmoy,
"if I would not slit the throat of all the pragmatical dogs in
Dublin!"</p>

<p>"Amen," hiccoughed Albemarle.</p>

<p>Galway feared that his brother-in-law would be dangerously
incensed at this, but Sarsfield was indifferent; he saw all of them
as vague unsubstantial figures, squeaking puppets impotently
banging sticks; he smiled beyond them at the kingly shapes trailing
moonshot clouds that had (he thought) accompanied him to the
tavern. Galway began an incoherent tale of some exploit which had
ended in "a rogue being brought to the wooden ruff and the whipping
post."</p>

<p>"'Tis unjust," frowned Berwick, "if you speak of the affair of
O'Hogan."</p>

<p>Galway said he meant O'Hogan and did not the fellow deserve a
whipping?</p>

<p>"He'll be hanged," said Galmoy fiercely. "I've seen to't, as
I'll see any double-damned scoundrel hanged who interferes," he
added, staring about him.</p>

<p>Luttrell laughed.</p>

<p>"Who shall be hanged and why?" asked Sarsfield. "Where there is
so much licence, prithee, what's the fault deserves a rope?"</p>

<p>From their ranting and swaggering, their drunken talk, a few
gibes from Luttrell, a few dry comments from Berwick, Sarsfield
learnt a clear tale.</p>

<p>O'Hogan, known as Galloping O'Hogan from his horsemanship, was a
leader of those rapparees who fought sometimes for King James,
occasionally for the Protestants, and often independently. He came
from Athlone and was valuable because of his courage, his cunning,
his influence with the horde he had gathered about him, and his
minute and exact knowledge of the country; he had a wild eloquence
and an impressive port; or as Colonel Luttrell put it, "he knew how
to bounce and vapour."</p>

<p>He had been in Dublin on some crafty business and had crossed
Galmoy whom he had met (in Luttrell's words "in some cabal, or
tavern conventicle, or bog house in the suburbs, or club for
ranters and roarers.") O'Hogan was born a gentleman and is as "fine
as if the devil was his tailor, so ho! boys, and up we go! Here's
good company for my Lord Galmoy."</p>

<p>Sarsfield was not listening; when the three men talked at once
and Albemarle broke in with a drunken catch, Berwick tapped his
foot impatiently and eyed his brother with cold irritation.</p>

<p>"It was about a horse," said Luttrell. The words came clearly to
Sarsfield through the turmoil and then he listened; he could never
be wholly indifferent when horses were discussed; he gave his
attention to the disjointed tale and made out these
particulars.</p>

<p>O'Hogan had possessed a horse, named John Luby, of which he made
great vaunt and boast; Galmoy had envied the animal and had offered
good English guineas, not brass money, for him; O'Hogan had
accepted the price, then hidden the horse; Galmoy had found it and
taken it to his own stables. On this O'Hogan had sought out my lord
where he sat over his dish in an ordinary, had insulted him,
calling him thief, horse-stealer and, in conclusion, had struck him
over the face.</p>

<p>It had been, of course, impossible for Lord Galmoy to challenge
a known rapparee, and O'Hogan had been arrested and (without a
trial, civil or military, as far as Sarsfield could understand)
condemned to death; in the state of Dublin at present it was not
difficult for a man in Galmoy's position to contrive this
punishment for an enemy.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for the loss of O'Hogan," smiled Luttrell. "The
villain was useful."</p>

<p>Galmoy smiled in brutal satisfaction; Sarsfield thought that he
must have looked so when he watched his troopers kicking Captain
Dixie's head about the village street.</p>

<p>"So," said Galmoy, "I was punished for my horrid silly
forbearance; the horse was, of course, in the first place stolen,
and I should have taken it without any to-do."</p>

<p>"Where is O'Hogan?" asked Sarsfield.</p>

<p>"In the castle prison," replied Luttrell; he seemed to speak
maliciously, "lying by the brink of his grave."</p>

<p>Albemarle, on a sudden, provoked a quarrel with Galway and,
staggering to his feet, struggled to draw his sword; Berwick seized
hold of him, but the shouting boy bid him defiance. Sarsfield
helped to wrench his hand from his sword hilt, for Galway was
dangerously inflamed.</p>

<p>"Does your grace think O'Hogan justly condemned?" he asked
Berwick through the scuffle.</p>

<p>"No, I spoke to the king of it, but was rebuked and will not be
so again. And no doubt 'tis a ruffian, maybe well out of the
way."</p>

<p>"What's that you say, my lord?" cried Galmoy.</p>

<p>"Nothing I'll repeat to thee," replied Berwick, and dragged his
brother away with the help of the drawer.</p>

<p>Galmoy cursed lewdly and swore he'd "take no setting down from
Belle Churchill's bastard."</p>

<p>"Say that to his face," advised Sarsfield; indifferent to
Galmoy's look of black hate he left the tavern, Luttrell followed
him and after them came the laughter of the others.</p>

<p>"You are going to see O'Hogan," said Luttrell, as they stood in
the narrow, dark street. The wind that had blown away the storm
rattled the sign of The Several Keys above their heads.</p>

<p>"You read me well, Harry. I think Galmoy lied."</p>

<p>"It is very sure. But O'Hogan is also a ruffian and to interfere
is to provoke Galmoy's hate. He is already incensed against you for
taking Captain Maguire into your troop and reflecting on the
hanging of Dixie."</p>

<p>"Galmoy lives in settled habits of corruption," replied
Sarsfield wearily; "all his actions must be suspect."</p>

<p>"There is no soul in the man; 'tis one whom death will catch
with wine in his head, flesh between his teeth, like the lusting
Israelites, and, no doubt, a harlot in his arms."</p>

<p>Luttrell followed Sarsfield up the lamp-lit street; a barefoot
woman was dancing in the gutter, splashing the liquid filth; sounds
of a quarrel came from a cellar flap. "I'm for bed, let the rogue
be; he deserves all of a hanging&mdash;why cross Galmoy?"</p>

<p>"I'm in no mood for sleep, Harry."</p>

<p>"But thou art very weary." Luttrell's soft voice was gentle with
affection.</p>

<p>"'Tis true. But I am past repose to-night."</p>

<p>Sarsfield needed something to blunt and dull his mind; his
distresses ached for a palliative, but not for these reasons did
he, when Colonel Luttrell left him, turn towards Dublin Castle, but
because he could not endure injustice.</p>

<p>It was easier for him to do what he would than it was for many
having greater authority; all the Irish were eager to obey him;
without difficulty he found himself in the cell of Toby O'Hogan,
who was condemned to be whipped and hanged on the morrow.</p>

<p>He was lodged in one of the old, dismal dungeons of the castle
which smelt of damp and bad air; Sarsfield obtained a lamp from the
gaoler, and, when it was set on the rude table, stood within the
heavy doorway looking at the prisoner, who rose from the straw
where he had flung himself.</p>

<p>"Colonel Patrick Sarsfield of Lucan," said O'Hogan.</p>

<p>"You know me then?"</p>

<p>"Every one knows you. I had not thought you had meddled with my
affair."</p>

<p>O'Hogan was a splendid-looking man, powerful and graceful, near
as tall as Sarsfield himself; he did not appear either brutal or
stupid; Sarsfield found a faint likeness to Ishma, in the shape of
his wide face, in the masses of his purple-black hair, in the hue
of his clear, gray-violet eyes; he wore the tatters of gaudy finery
that had been torn in a fierce struggle; his shirt and cravat were
in rags over his noble chest, bunches of ribbons hung in tatters at
his knees; he was manacled and chained by one ankle to the
wall.</p>

<p>"I've heard Galmoy's story of his quarrel with you just now for
the first time. I should like to hear your account of it, Mr.
O'Hogan."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I know Galmoy to be a liar."</p>

<p>"He is that. But I am sentenced to death. Would you be troubling
with me, Colonel Sarsfield?"</p>

<p>"Will you answer a few questions, Mr. O'Hogan?"</p>

<p>"I know," said the rapparee without servility, "that you have a
noble temper and good breeding. I'll answer your questions
straightly."</p>

<p>"First, did you steal the horse John Luby?"</p>

<p>"I did not. I hid him myself on a little demesne I had in
Athlone. I reared him and taught him; he would obey a whisper of
mine."</p>

<p>"Did Galmoy offer for him?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"And you took the money?"</p>

<p>"I did not. I would take no money for John Luby. I refused."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Mr. O'Hogan, what then occurred?"</p>

<p>"Galmoy stole the horse&mdash;broke into the stables when I was away,
and his troopers killed a little lad I had who was defending John
Luby. And then I went directly and charged him with it, and he set
servants on me to throw me out as a ranting brawler; but I first
called him a filthy horse-thief and child-slayer and struck him
across his ugly jowl. God be praised!"</p>

<p>"This is all true?" asked Sarsfield.</p>

<p>"On my word of honour," said the rapparee gravely. He stood
erect with folded arms; by not so much as a glance did he ask for
pity, mercy, or help.</p>

<p>"I believe you," said Sarsfield. "There is no honour in my Lord
Galmoy."</p>

<p>"There is none. I know somewhat of his dirty acts."</p>

<p>"I'll not hear them. As for your case I'll do what I can, Mr.
O'Hogan. But build nothing on't, prithee, for I know not how much
influence I may have, having never yet asked for anything. My Lord
Berwick spoke for you to the king and in vain."</p>

<p>"You know nothing of me, Colonel Sarsfield," remarked O'Hogan.
"I've lived a freebooter since the troubles began."</p>

<p>"That does not touch me. I believe you unjustly condemned. I'll
do what I may. You shall at least hear from me within a few
hours."</p>

<p>O'Hogan glanced curiously over the tall figure in the scarlet
and gold whose magnificence was hardly dimmed by the ugly horror of
the cell.</p>

<p>"You look a weary man," he said quietly. "Why should you break
your rest for me? You've heard me called hell-rogue, if you've
heard of me at all."</p>

<p>"You do not break my rest, Mr. O'Hogan. My own affairs keep me
abroad. A good-night, sir."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Colonel Sarsfield. You are the only man in Dublin
would have done this."</p>

<p>The rapparee added no more either of thanks or supplication and
Sarsfield left the cell. For several hours he could do nothing; it
was not near the dawn, it was even possible that the king might not
be astir before the hour fixed for O'Hogan's execution, but
Sarsfield remembered that he always attended early mass in the
chapel of the castle.</p>

<p>That night Colonel Sarsfield did not return home, but slept a
little on a chair in the guard-room, and when King James approached
the door of the chapel in the morning, he perceived this officer
standing in his way, and asked him "if he attended the mass?"</p>

<p>Sarsfield said his business could not wait and directly asked
for a reprieve for Toby O'Hogan.</p>

<p>The king was distracted, impatient; Tyrconnel was with him and
tried to put Sarsfield aside with his stately bluster&mdash;Galmoy had
settled the affair, he declared&mdash;O'Hogan was a known ruffian.</p>

<p>But the king's mistress, who hung on his arm, looked with eyes
of favour at Sarsfield; she was a woman past everything save the
favours of the old man she despised and soon, she knew, to be left
by him, for his dull likings did not long endure; but she had gay
and kindly memories of a joyous youth, and the sight of Sarsfield
stirred in her a thousand regrets. She pulled about her a great
flounced skirt of green taffeta and showed pretty buckled shoes; in
her casual and tawdry comeliness she reminded Sarsfield of the
woman he had seen, a few hours ago, dancing in the gutter under the
street lamp.</p>

<p>"Give Colonel Sarsfield what he asks," she coaxed the king.
"Surely he held Galway and Connaught when none other could, and has
asked nothing for it."</p>

<p>"Why do you want the life of this notorious villain?" asked the
king uneasily.</p>

<p>"For simple justice," replied Sarsfield.</p>

<p>"It will mean angering Lord Galmoy, sire," remarked Tyrconnel,
definitely saying the wrong thing. The king frowned into some
majesty.</p>

<p>"And what obligations am I under to my Lord Galmoy?" he demanded
dryly. "I believe I am not yet so insignificant that I need go
nicely with such as he. Colonel Sarsfield deserves this favour. You
shall have your reprieve."</p>

<p>"I thank Your Majesty. And may Mr. O'Hogan have his horse again
which Galmoy took by force?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that too; but tell him to leave Dublin for some secret
place. I want no roaring and bawling."</p>

<p>The king passed into the chapel, not waiting for Sarsfield's
gratitude; but the woman lingered and held out her hand
wistfully.</p>

<p>"You've the kind heart, Colonel Sarsfield."</p>

<p>She spoke as one who would soon need kindness herself.</p>

<p>"I owe my success to you, madam," replied Sarsfield, and kissed
her hand, at which she shrugged, laughed, sighed, and followed the
king and Tyrconnel into the chapel.</p>

<p>Sarsfield entrusted the matter of Toby O'Hogan and the recovery
of the horse from Galmoy to Captain Maguire. By midday that
energetic officer reported that the rapparee, mounted on John Luby,
had left Dublin before Galmoy, who was abroad on his pleasures,
knew anything of the matter.</p>

<p>Sarsfield did not expect to hear of Toby O'Hogan again.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-29" id="ch1-29"></a>TWENTY-NINE</h2>

<p class="first">
THE CAMPAIGN of 1690 opened with the Prince of Orange sending
over seven thousand Danes under the Duke of Wurtemburg; soon after
several other English and Dutch regiments landed. They had money
and weapons, and thus reinforced morally as well as physically
Schomberg's camp at Dundalk. As a counterblast, Lauzun landed with
seven thousand three hundred men at Kinsale. King Louis, however,
declared that he must receive an equal number of Irish to replace
them. Accordingly four Irish regiments under Mountcashel, who had
contrived to escape from Derry, sailed for France; D'Avaux and De
Rosen, both embittered by the most unfriendly feelings towards King
James and the Irish, went back in the transport which had brought
the new Commander. D'Avaux again tried to persuade Sarsfield to
bring his wife and little son with him to France.</p>

<p>"You will do nothing in this country," he said with emphasis,
"nothing."</p>

<p>But Sarsfield instantly and without reflection refused. He had
been stimulated by the news of the arrival of fresh forces from
England; he hoped that he might soon find an opportunity of meeting
the enemy in open battle; he even believed that, despite the
cautious waiting policy of the French, he might be able to force a
definite victory which would raise Ireland in the eyes of the whole
of Europe.</p>

<p>The Duke of Lauzun had, however, received instructions
absolutely contrary to the hopes of Sarsfield, for Louvois had told
him not to be carried away "by the excitement of giving battle or
achieving a triumph, but to play a waiting game."</p>

<p>Lauzun remarked ironically when he landed at Kinsale that he
"was obliged to wait in any case for though his coming had long
been expected, on landing he found not cosmos but chaos."</p>

<p>There was absolutely nothing ready for him, no preparations
whatever had been made, there lacked the meanest transports to take
his troops to Dublin; there were no magazines, no depots,
everywhere was quarrelling, jobbery, avarice, dishonesty and even
treachery; Lauzun, the excitable, accomplished courtier, was no man
to struggle with such a state of affairs.</p>

<p>Sarsfield himself soon noticed that the fiery Livonian, De
Rosen, experienced and skilful, had been the better man for such an
impossible post. The treasury at Dublin was also empty. Such means
as the Jacobites possessed, instead of being garnered against the
opening of the campaign, had been scattered in dissipation, and had
fallen into the hands of traders and Jews who refused to part with
them. Lauzun, with the best grace possible, waived his pay which he
could not have received since such a sum did not exist.</p>

<p>A little heartened by the sight of the French troops, encouraged
too by the presence of Lauzun, who, although in much a vain
braggadocio, was high in the favour of His Britannic Majesty, James
set out for his headquarters on the south banks of the Boyne, thus
affronting as closely as possible the camp of the invaders.</p>

<p>News from the north reported that, highly encouraged by their
reinforcements, the Protestants were eager for battle and confident
of victory over "a tattered, cowardly Irish army."</p>

<p>Before Sarsfield left with the troops for the opening of the
campaign, he came again on what he would most willingly have
avoided&mdash;a clash of wills with his wife.</p>

<p>The Lady Honor had come to know obliquely (through Henry
Luttrell, Sarsfield suspected) that her husband had refused the
chance to go with the Irish troops to France. She summoned him
imperiously to her presence. They did not meet casually then but
were so far separate that it needed some sudden special occasion
for him to come into her apartments.</p>

<p>She greeted him with vivid reproaches.</p>

<p>"Why did you not take this chance?" she cried. "Do you think I
wish to stay in this country which daily becomes more impossible?
Perhaps you have no idea of what I have suffered during this
hideous winter in Dublin?"</p>

<p>Sarsfield leant against the marble mantelpiece of her sumptuous
apartment. He was so weary and heartsick that only his exquisite
breeding enabled him to maintain a courteous demeanour.</p>

<p>He found his wife in everything unreasonable, her extravagance
had been without bounds and often the matter of his stern rebuke.
Her company was such that he could not approve, and though through
all she maintained that hard, unblemished honour, still she had
done nothing to help him in the terrible coil in which they found
themselves.</p>

<p>Often he had thought, with a rising bitterness, that a little
kindness, a little generosity from Honor would have made his way
easier. Now she reproached him with all the unreasonableness of a
disappointed nervous woman. She would have liked to return to
France. The English exiles were treated with every consideration at
St. Germains; with her rank and his fortune she might have hoped
for a pleasant life...</p>

<p>"Your mother and your sisters stay there," she reminded him.
"Why should I be exposed to all the horrid chances of war? The
usurper is landing with an enormous army; he may even take Dublin.
What is to become of me if we are all fugitive?"</p>

<p>"Believe me, you are in no danger," replied Sarsfield wearily.
"The Prince of Orange's object is not to outrage but to conciliate;
even should he prove victorious you are safe from every possible
outrage. If Dublin is distasteful to you, you may go to my estates
at Lucan."</p>

<p>Honor pinched her painted lips and cast up her neat head and was
about, he was sure, to remind him of "the miss" he kept at Lucan;
but he turned on her such a look of stately rebuke that she was
silent. She had generally saved herself from the last meanness of
ignoble reproaches. Now she seemed overwrought to the point of
tears. "All the men would be leaving Dublin, she would be left
alone with the women, with the raddle, careless, casual crowd
gathered round Lady Tyrconnel and Madame de Bonnac, who disliked
her and lost no opportunity of expressing that dislike..."</p>

<p>"Your position would have been far better in France," she
reminded her husband; "you would have been certain at least of your
pay and your position; but here all is chaos. What manner of man is
Lauzun to serve under? Tyrconnel seems beside himself." And she
added, repeating the name proudly and defiantly: "There is only the
Duke of Berwick who can be relied upon."</p>

<p>"There are many men who can be relied upon," said Sarsfield
quietly, "but they lack one to lead them. But it is useless, my
dear, for me to discuss this matter, I have definitely refused to
go to France. I am not in the service of King Louis but in that of
King James, and if I do not fight for Ireland I am no more than a
mercenary soldier."</p>

<p>"Many a noble gentleman is that," she retorted, "and makes a
fair fortune out of it."</p>

<p>"I have resolved to remain in Ireland and you, as I say and can
swear to you, are safe enough, either in Dublin or Lucan, and no
more exposed to the chances of war than the queen herself." And he
added: "Since you have chosen we should be strangers, Honor, my
absence will grieve you little."</p>

<p>He raised his hand and let it fall on the cold white marble
mantelpiece; the grief on his face was such that even Honor was
almost moved to pity, but she hardened her heart, it was not
difficult for her proud resolute nature to do so.</p>

<p>She was indeed truly disappointed and shocked that he had
refused the chance to return to Paris; she saw herself mated for
ever to a man who would always pursue an impossible and vexatious
ideal and never consider gain, security or comfort.</p>

<p>Sarsfield could guess at the suffering she expressed in trivial
laments and was gentle with her, the more so as she made a gallant
shift to check her upbraiding and to give him a dignified
farewell.</p>

<p>"I am very weak and infirm," she said suddenly. "I vacillate
greatly in my resolves. You have never seen the best of me."</p>

<p>"But I do know it, Honor. Remember that I shall not be far away,
that an express may easily reach me and that, bar some great
downfall that I will never suspect, you are safe and cosy in
Dublin. Recall, too, how possible it is that this campaign may end
all, and we live at peace in Ireland."</p>

<p>Honor smiled with a touch of tenderness.</p>

<p>"Live in peace, Patrick? You and I at Lucan?"</p>

<p>"There would be no obstacle," he smiled.</p>

<p>"None&mdash;but your heart and mine. And there, I think, we should
find penance enough. Well, I must stay here, waiting for news of
battles."</p>

<p>"Pray that I be slain, poor soul," thought Sarsfield; he
marvelled how he had ever resisted that impulse to ride into the
sea beyond Clontarf; how easy a widowhood would Honor have
had...and so he was gone from her, and he knew that he would have
nothing but formal farewells before he rode away.</p>

<p>Some of his last leisure was broken in upon by Olivia de Bonnac;
he did not wish to see her nor yet care enough to evade her
invitation, so went openly to her fashionable little house where
she had kept such jovial company all the winter.</p>

<p>The moon was at the full, the spring night sweet even in the
centre of the city. Madame de Bonnac's windows were open, and above
the black roofs opposite was a wide space of sky, vivid and dark as
violets under water.</p>

<p>Olivia received Sarsfield with a certain radiant impatience that
warned him she had, in her own mind, brought affairs between them
to a crisis.</p>

<p>He found Colonel Henry Luttrell in her company and knew
definitely (what he had sensed long before), that these two were in
secret, if not open, league.</p>

<p>Luttrell lounged at his ease in a <i>chaise-longue.</i> Madame
de Bonnac was alert, vigilant, seated by her alabaster table. She
was gorgeously set off by French brocades, her fine pearls in her
ears and round her throat. Sarsfield knew that this woman was his
opponent; he recalled what he had learnt from D'Avaux who had
hinted she was a spy or agent, no doubt not of one party, but of
whoever paid her the highest fee. Her obvious beauty was without
any blemish that its merits could not conceal; amid all the
privations and miseries; the ruinous pleasures and hectic
dissipations of this winter in Dublin she had survived, blooming
like a hardy exotic which appears so frail, yet is very firm and
robust...a tuberose, an orange or citron bloom. Her carnation was
dazzling, her hair, elaborately dressed and perfumed, gleamed in
smooth loops, she needed no paint, her eyes sparkled with a
flashing lustre; yet there was something hard, even metallic, about
this radiant and brilliant beauty so carefully cherished, so
laboriously set off. She moved him not at all; she was not even the
echo of an old dream.</p>

<p>"Eh, well, madam," he asked, with some impatience, "I am full of
business after too long an idleness, and what can you and Colonel
Luttrell have to say to me?"</p>

<p>"I think you can guess," she said directly, like a challenge.
"You have evaded me too long."</p>

<p>"And is Colonel Luttrell to be a witness of this interview?"
asked Sarsfield, smiling towards that gentleman.</p>

<p>Colonel Luttrell was full of vital energy under his insolent air
as Sarsfield well knew, but he remained outwardly passive,
squinting pleasantly before him, and playing with the gold acorns
on his sword hilt.</p>

<p>"Colonel Luttrell and I," cried Olivia de Bonnac, putting an
exquisite hand on an exquisite bosom and speaking with fine
breeding and fine contempt, "have often discussed you and your
prospects, Colonel Sarsfield. I believe offers were made to you by
D'Avaux to take your troop to France?"</p>

<p>"Why, so they were," smiled Sarsfield, "though it seems to me
this is no business of the present company, and I refused."</p>

<p>"You did well to refuse," said Luttrell casually, "no one but a
fool would have accepted."</p>

<p>Sarsfield's smile deepened as he thought how contrary this was
to the advice and reproaches of his wife.</p>

<p>"Some think one thing and some another," he replied negligently;
"but it is my wish to remain and fight in Ireland."</p>

<p>"Still to fight for King James?" demanded Madame de Bonnac.</p>

<p>He replied directly to her challenge.</p>

<p>"Still to fight for King James, madam."</p>

<p>She lifted her shoulders, sparkles of fury lit her magnificent
eyes.</p>

<p>"Are you stupid, doltish, or infatuate?"</p>

<p>"I am patient," he replied, "or I should not be here to listen
to your abuse, which you have on no account whatever the right to
use."</p>

<p>"I have always been interested in you." She looked at Luttrell,
much as to say: "Here is what we have to deal with!"</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Sarsfield, moving forward so that he stood
between the two of them. "Why are you and Harry Luttrell interested
in me?"</p>

<p>"My dear Sarsfield," said Luttrell, rising, "you know perfectly
well why, it is long since I told you. I am interested in you
because I know&mdash;yes, I know&mdash;that you are the one man who can
create anything out of the present chaos. If you were to make a
party of your own...Think how easily you contrived the O'Hogan
affair&mdash;no other man could have done that&mdash;your popularity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have listened to all that before," interrupted Sarsfield. "I
count it as of little worth."</p>

<p>"I wish you to listen to it again," cried Madame de Bonnac. "I
know the world and so does Colonel Luttrell, and surely in
you"&mdash;here her voice took on a note of appeal&mdash;"we do not still
deal with an incompetent dreamer."</p>

<p>"A dreamer, certainly," smiled Sarsfield, "I cannot conceive how
a man can exist on any other terms than that of having dreams. But
I have not troubled you for many a year with any dreams of mine. As
for you, Colonel Luttrell, have I not suggested to you again and
again that you take the place you offer to me?"</p>

<p>"If I were to endeavour to raise what you would call a
'rebellion,'" said Luttrell calmly, "I should find myself with a
halter round my neck. No one would follow me, no one would listen
to me, nor respect me. With you it is different. You are, though
you do not seem to know it, the one power in Ireland."</p>

<p>At these words Sarsfield's blood stirred in spite of himself; he
could not be altogether impervious to Luttrell's insinuating
address, the quiet force in his cool phrases; he knew there was
truth in it; he knew his own popularity, not only with his own men
but with the entire army, he knew how easy it would be for him to
rouse the native Irish not only against the invader but against the
French and the English king whom they had learned to despise, and
who despised them. But he replied:</p>

<p>"It is fantastic."</p>

<p>"Do you tell me to my face," said Madame de Bonnac, "that it is
fantastic? Why, Colonel Luttrell will work for you and I will work
for you, and," added the proud woman significantly, "neither he nor
I is an ally to be despised. We are equal to all their lies, shams
and outcries."</p>

<p>"I suppose you would make your terms," smiled Sarsfield. He knew
what her terms would be; she would have to be his mistress more or
less openly; a flaunting demi-queen of revolt; while Harry Luttrell
would hold him in the hollow of his hand, make of him a puppet,
write his speeches for him, no doubt, dictate his actions, whisper
dropped counsel in his ear, point out this and that to
do...Sarsfield turned away...Not on these conditions nor by these
two was Ireland to be saved.</p>

<p>"Go your own way and fail," said Madame de Bonnac, furious at
his gesture of refusal.</p>

<p>"And remember," added Henry Luttrell lazily, "that you have made
an enemy at least of me, for I am tired of your impertinent
vanity."</p>

<p>"You are tired," said Sarsfield, "of trying to flatter me
without success. I bear you no ill-will, Luttrell, you have been a
charming companion. To Madame de Bonnac I owe much." He looked at
her with ease. "But to the proposal that you have made to me I say
again&mdash;No."</p>

<p>There could be no mistaking the finality of his words.</p>

<p>"That was all I wished to learn," said Luttrell, "whether you
still, at this last chance, refused us."</p>

<p>"You say us&mdash;are you and this lady in a cabal? Let me warn you,
Harry, for old friendship, you go too far, all know of your
intrigues&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And none can stop 'em."</p>

<p>"Will you hear what we have done?" asked Olivia. "What is
offered you?"</p>

<p>"No, 'tis but to inflame ourselves for nothing&mdash;a starting of
devices and an evading of them&mdash;"</p>

<p>Colonel Luttrell sprang to his feet; his passion made the defect
in his eyes appear an ugly deformity.</p>

<p>"You will make too many enemies, Sarsfield. Galmoy is hot after
you, he believes you meddled in the O'Hogan scandal, though all
your Irish are mum for your sake."</p>

<p>"You bungle this with clamour," replied Sarsfield. "Once and for
all, I am not your man."</p>

<p>He was at the door when Olivia called him, and he stayed in mere
courtesy.</p>

<p>"What works against us in your mind?" she demanded.</p>

<p>He was silent because it was impossible to satisfy her on this
point, and she continued while Luttrell watched him keenly.</p>

<p>"Is it not that rustic piece you have hidden in Lucan, with her
pious, mystical airs who has made you sick of a canker of visionary
virtues?"</p>

<p>This was at once so near the truth and so utterly false that
Sarsfield smiled; true inasmuch as contact with Ishma had made him
incapable of perjury, disloyalty, or love for Olivia; false
inasmuch as Ishma was entirely ignorant of any shade of
intrigue.</p>

<p>Luttrell said:</p>

<p>"I thought by now that you had been clear of that besotted
folly. God! that a man of your parts should be so blinded by the
superstition of the vulgar; I'll warrant this white witch has
addled your wits."</p>

<p>This was a violent speech for Luttrell and Sarsfield responded
violently; he felt himself in the presence of active enemies, and
this was the more odious to him in that he had once given the woman
his candid love, the man his candid friendship.</p>

<p>"You'll not ruffle me, Luttrell, with these notorious, lying
scandals, furbished up to vex me&mdash;'tis pitiful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And may be dangerous!" cried Olivia.</p>

<p>"Why, what have I to fear from thee?" asked Sarsfield with an
angry smile. "Or from that poor intriguer Luttrell with his
perverse and unlawful schemes? I am weary of your glosses and
colours with which you seek to palliate your silly fiddle-faddle of
plots and intrigues!"</p>

<p>They would have spoken again but he left them; he indeed thought
he was invulnerable before either Luttrell or Madame de Bonnac, and
put them resolutely out of his mind.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-30" id="ch1-30"></a>THIRTY</h2>

<p class="first">
COLONEL SARSFIELD soon discovered, to his great chagrin, that
Lauzun had been inspired by Tyrconnel with dislike of himself. He
found the king, too, dull at his interviews with him, inattentive
to his suggestions; Melfort also was hostile, indeed it seemed as
if he had not a single friend among all the Jacobites, except the
native Irish officers who were mostly in insignificant
commands.</p>

<p>Sarsfield endeavoured to hearten the king into making a stand,
but he saw that James was intimidated by the reports he had heard
of the magnitude of the forces brought against him, by the failure
of the revolt in Scotland, and by the solid form which the English
Government had then taken; it seemed hopeless to suppose that
anything would move the Prince of Orange from the throne he had
usurped.</p>

<p>"I wish," he said to Sarsfield, "I could trust your countrymen
better."</p>

<p>"If you would trust them a little more, they, sire, would serve
you with a greater zeal."</p>

<p>But James only gave his rare melancholy smile and shrugged his
bent shoulders; he seemed without hope.</p>

<p>Resolutely Sarsfield made all his preparations for the campaign;
with a shrinking of his heart he thought of Ishma and Lucan. All
the winter he had not seen her, and when he had visited his demesne
he had avoided the little cottage by the holy well and the may
trees.</p>

<p>Only from his bailiff or the rough, square-headed priest had he
learnt that the girl was well, and occupied herself in humble but
sometimes gay tasks.</p>

<p>In the spring she had gone abroad in the park with ease and
lightness, watching the Irish hound course through the long grass,
the swans sailing with proudly-arched wings on the azure surface of
the lake, or had sat with her needlework beneath the budding may.
"She herself as white and as pure," said the old priest
tenderly...</p>

<p>"But now I go into the most horrible confusion," thought
Sarsfield, "I can be no more sure of my life than if I were a man a
hundred years old. And I have given much to discipline and duty,
surely it will be no sin to seek her out."</p>

<p>He vowed it should be for the last time, that even if he came
alive out of the forthcoming fierce campaign nevermore would he see
Ishma O'Donaghoe alone. He had listened to the old priest's advice,
which was that the girl should be moved to one of the convents
newly established in Ireland since the coming of King James, and
there take up her residence to discover whether or no she had a
vocation. Or, if Sarsfield wished for her even greater safety, she
might be sent to some establishment in France. Sarsfield's whole
spirit winced at the thought of separating the girl from Ireland.
But he agreed she was too young to spend her whole life in passive
inactivity in the little cottage on his demesne.</p>

<p>Besides, whichever way the war went, the time would come when he
must live at Lucan and take his wife there. Evil scandal had
already poisoned all chance of the two women being companions. He
could not endure the thought that Honor might have the opportunity
to lift her skirt away from Ishma or glance at her with haughty
coldness, or that Madame de Bonnac, visiting his wife, might give
one of her gross laughs and fling out one of her coarse
remarks.</p>

<p>And, if Ishma had no vocation, she must find a woman's
life&mdash;husband, children, work in the world. And he must endure to
live through the news of her troth-plight...Yet that seemed an
impossible prospect. He thought of Ishma as perpetually virginal, a
faery who would vanish from the close embrace of any mortal. He
said sternly to himself: "I have never been a profligate, I have
kept myself above those voluptuous vices by which men ruin body and
soul. Why should I be ashamed of this honourable love even in my
secret heart? I have nothing to lament but mistakes."</p>

<p>So he rode to Lucan along the banks of the Liffey on a fair
day.</p>

<p>He found Ishma sitting by the holy well in the shade of the may
trees which were in the full perfection of their blossom, and flung
out a rich odour like almonds on the pearl-coloured air.</p>

<p>She was no tormented saint, betrayed or outraged, or full of
conscious virtue, but a young woman, very candid and lovely and
gay, it seemed to Sarsfield, despite their long absence from one
another; yet he did not marvel at this gaiety for he felt their
love was above all human vicissitudes and composed of pure joy.</p>

<p>He sat beside her on the stone well edge, his scarlet coat and
gold bravery making brilliant colour in that pale moving
shadow.</p>

<p>"Ishma," said he, turning on her his tired yet brilliant eyes,
"bid me good-bye and pray for me if you will. At last after many
crosses and frustrations I go to fight in a pitched battle for
Ireland."</p>

<p>"Are there not enough battlefields in Ireland?" she said
gravely. She clasped her hands in her lap; the sunlight falling
through the hawthorn boughs flecked over her fingers.</p>

<p>"Ishma, we must fight again, and I believe we have good chances,
though there seems some providence which interferes with all our
endeavours. Oh, my dear, it has gone beyond words. I go and you
remain. And all is a horror of war, save only here, where I must
not stay."</p>

<p>"You will think of me sometimes? In the battle and when the
night is silent?"</p>

<p>"How can I forget you when you are Ireland to me? Out of all the
discords which have of late surrounded me you are the one natural
and simple pleasure."</p>

<p>A few small petals from the may tree fell on to her passive
hands. She smiled at him without either reproach or anguish. She
was as utterly without pride as without fear, and he wondered, with
compassion and admiration, at her serene calm; for she was at the
mercy of the world, and had none but himself to stand between her
and utter disaster.</p>

<p>He began to reassure her, telling her how she was living well
behind the Jacobite lines, that Prince William was a merciful man
with disciplined troops, that she need have no fear of outrage; and
yet he felt that it was needless thus to speak to her, for she had
no dread or apprehension.</p>

<p>"But what does it matter?" She smiled. "One could die so easily.
The battlefield does not provide the only means of escape."</p>

<p>"Well, eh, well, perhaps it is enough to colour all the
years&mdash;the may flowers, the blue sky, and you and I sitting here,
at peace at least for half an hour&mdash;without dissembling, or
reproaches, or need of speech."</p>

<p>The small, dark leaves of the trees and the clusters of little
cup-shaped blossom were between him and the prospect of the park,
between him and reality; under the low sweep of the boughs he could
see the huge base of the heavy cross and Brian, the dog, lying
against the gray stone. All this was very beautiful to
Sarsfield.</p>

<p>Ishma placed her hand on his and looked at him with grave
eyes.</p>

<p>With her other hand she took a cross of gold covered with
delicate symbols in the finest wire, and with a simple gesture,
held it to his lips.</p>

<p>It was at that period of the spring day when all motion seemed
to be at pause, the very hours to stand still; a few sheep grazed
on the peaceful slope beyond where they sat; azure and green the
pastures faded into the mist of perfect peace.</p>

<p>Sarsfield kissed the little gold cross she held to his lips and
she without a word returned it to her bosom.</p>

<p>He thought: "Though we have had no pleasure, no joy, no sport,
nor worldly lust in this our love, perhaps we have had a deeper
tenderness and a higher nobility than if mischance had not come so
sorely our way; perhaps my great folly has been rewarded instead of
being chastised."</p>

<p>He felt his love light and pure as the dew in May falling on an
open flower.</p>

<p>They sat hand in hand and neither spoke. The priest passed and
entered the little chapel.</p>

<p>They heard the bell and rose, and passed in together to pray
with the shepherd, and Sarsfield's tenants and servants.</p>

<p>He bent his head, overwhelmed by sweetness and sadness.</p>

<p>A soft dreaminess fell over him, his spirit was nearly spent;
but when they parted at the church door a certain strength upheld
him; the task before him appeared neither gigantic nor impossible.
Ishma, standing by the door, smiled at him as if she humbly
entreated to be allowed to share his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Surely we think too much of ourselves," she said. "Living quiet
here I have heard the cry of all Ireland in my ears. The priest and
your servants have told me of the great army that invades us. Last
night I thought I stood on the mountains and saw the naked bodies
of the Irish dead, white as sheep on the slopes. Then again I saw
the ranks of the heroes, the Fianna, rising from the lake and
galloping fast&mdash;and thou wert there, my love."</p>

<p>Sarsfield thought of the night when he had ridden over the
battlefield of Clontarf.</p>

<p>"Is it very terrible, the war?" asked Ishma. "Much slaying,
misery and fire?"</p>

<p>He could not answer that, nor bring into her enclosed peace any
taint of what the war meant.</p>

<p>"And the children," said Ishma, "sometimes I hear little
children crying, very frightened. And that is very hard for a
woman."</p>

<p>Still Sarsfield did not speak; he had never told her that he had
a son; she did not heed his silence, and he saw that she had a
musing smile as if pleased at happy, secret thoughts.</p>

<p>"Yet life is lovely," she added, "and very lovely the thought of
death."</p>

<p>A faint smoke rose from the cottage; through the open door the
dwarfish figure of Brighita Begg could be seen moving busily to and
fro; the ancient cross, so gaunt and rugged, was softened by the
early sunlight into a tender amber hue, as if brushed (he might
think), by gold dust from angelic wings.</p>

<p>"I have such agreeable pleasures every day," mused Ishma. "It is
not just, when so many others suffer."</p>

<p>"Dost thou not suffer, dear heart, in that we must part?"</p>

<p>"But we are never parted." She spoke gaily. "Such joys are mine!
'Thy face turned from all others...'"</p>

<p>The dog came forward to meet them, the plaited gold of his
collar shone through his long fur.</p>

<p>"Guard her well, Brian," said Sarsfield as the animal looked up
at him; then, to the priest who was closing the door of the church:
"Guard her well."</p>

<p>They had but a few moments more; but a few moments of lingering
by the door; Ishma then seemed to him queenly, as she had appeared
on the battlefield of Clontarf.</p>

<p>"A blessing of God, Christ and His angels go with thee," she
said, smiling on the humble threshold as if she stood by a
throne.</p>

<p>"My dear."</p>

<p>A light breeze shook the hawthorn blossoms on to the stones of
the old well.</p>

<p>"Though our meetings," said Ishma, "have been brief as the
shadow of a flying bird which falls through a little window, yet
love ever bridges the deepest abyss."</p>

<p>Still smiling she put up her little hand and touched his face
very lightly, then went into the dwelling.</p>

<p>Sarsfield leant for a second against the lintel of the door, and
time seemed to rush by him, so that he knew not in what place his
life was set. Then he sat his horse and rode away out of his noble
demesne of Lucan; the misty spring sunshine shone in glances of
gold on his breastplate; the beech trees were budding, the grass
was thick with opening flowers; on the lake the swans idled with
arched snowy wings.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-31" id="ch1-31"></a>THIRTY-ONE</h2>

<p class="first">
OVER AT LAST was the long idle waiting, the skirmishes, the
purposeless marching and counter-marching, the meaningless outrages
and cruelties, the deadly dalliance with decisive events, which had
devastated the country since the landing of King James at
Kinsale.</p>

<p>A decisive struggle between implacable foes had begun in bad
earnest, a struggle that was not to be checked or ended other than
violently.</p>

<p>William of Orange, a man never to be turned from his purpose nor
daunted, had landed in Ireland.</p>

<p>When Sarsfield reached his headquarters he heard that the
usurper was at Carrickfergus; he had escaped the French fleet,
either because they wished this formidable enemy shut up in Ireland
or through negligence. This prince had with him a fine army of
well-disciplined, well-trained mercenaries. The mistake made the
previous year with the army of Schomberg was not repeated. The
commissariat, with transport and provisions, was provided by
responsible contractors. Sarsfield smiled to learn that the Prince
of Orange, with that statesman-like tact which distinguished all
his actions, had brought with him but few English regiments; if he
gained the victory he hoped, he did not wish to leave among the
Irish the bitter feeling that they had been beaten by their ancient
enemies, the English. All his actions were marked by moderation and
wisdom, or, as his enemies declared, by cunning and artifice. He
forbade plunder, nor would he permit his men to press carts and
horses from the farmers; he gave generous and tactful rewards to
the loyal and zealous.</p>

<p>It was reported in the Irish camp that he had ordered the entire
army to take the field, that when Schomberg still counselled delay
he had replied "that he had not come to Ireland to let the grass
grow under his feet, but to prosecute the war with the utmost
rigour." Thirty-six thousand men were at his camp at
Loughbrickland.</p>

<p>The Duke of Lauzun was as resolute to avoid a battle as William
of Orange was to force one.</p>

<p>Sarsfield hoped that the enemy would triumph in their designs,
he despised Lauzun, and more and more detested the policy of his
master.</p>

<p>Some good news cheered the Jacobite headquarters; Tourville had
beaten Herbert in a decisive battle off Beachy Head, had landed,
and burnt the small fishing village of Teignmouth. None of James's
counsellors was statesman-like enough to perceive that this action
would do the French little good, and unite the English only the
more firmly under the banner of the Prince of Orange.</p>

<p>Sarsfield warned Lauzun, who was openly exulting in the
Teignmouth affair, "that a little moderation had been better for
the cause."</p>

<p>The Prince of Orange marched through Loughbrickland and Newry,
then halted at Dundalk, Schomberg's winter camp.</p>

<p>Lauzun, who had no great experience and was blinded by conceit
and the favour of King James, was, however, soldier enough to
perceive that he could hardly avoid, much as he desired to do so, a
battle with the enemy advancing so steadily upon him.</p>

<p>He had already been forced to retire from Dundalk, and take up
an inferior encampment on the south bank of the Boyne.</p>

<p>Sarsfield pointed out that they "had given up a stronghold
without fighting for it, merely to retire to a weak enough
position," but Lauzun was indifferent to these reproaches; he made
no disguise of the fact that he did not wish to fight; he was then
only eight miles from the enemy; nothing was between them but the
River Boyne, which was in several places fordable.</p>

<p>On the 29th of June the two armies affronted each other&mdash;the
Williamites had advanced to the north bank, and the Jacobites stood
at bay on the south bank of the old gray river.</p>

<p>Lauzun, whatever his mistake in abandoning Dundalk, had made the
best of his position with skilful care.</p>

<p>He was protected in front by the river and marshy land, behind
the adjacent morass were rising fields steep enough, so that the
enemy could not see how many men were concealed by the undulations
of the ground; he had thrown up breastworks along the winding sedgy
banks of the river.</p>

<p>A stone house at Oldbridge, quickly fortified, formed his
headquarters; the village beyond was also protected by trenches and
held by Tyrconnel's dragoons.</p>

<p>The Irish army had, Lauzun thought, what seemed an impregnable
front and a safe retreat through Duleek on the high road to
Dublin.</p>

<p>It was believed that the Williamites intended to attack at
whatever disadvantage and at any cost; they had been observed
reconnoitring in small parties along the sloping fields and glens
of the north bank.</p>

<p>King James&mdash;vacillating, reluctant, alarmed as usual&mdash;held his
council of war; the prospect of a battle put no heart into him,
though it was pointed out, even by Tyrconnel, by no means a
confident man, that the deficiency in the Jacobite numbers was more
than balanced by their good position. Moreover, they were
defending, not attacking&mdash;another considerable advantage...besides
the road to Dublin lay open to them through Duleek.</p>

<p>"Will your Irish fight?" asked James, looking at Sarsfield and
Berwick; "much depends on that."</p>

<p>These two officers commanded between them the best of the native
cavalry; Berwick had the second troop of Guards, Sarsfield was now
major-general in command of the third troop of horse.</p>

<p>"I can answer for my men as for myself," said Berwick, "but the
infantry are very unreliable."</p>

<p>James smoothed his long chin and looked at Sarsfield.</p>

<p>"No need for you to speak," he said, "I know your faith, General
Sarsfield; but can you put your courage into other men? Eh, well,
well!"</p>

<p>Lauzun, compliant and civil as he was to the king, bore himself
insolently to the Irish officers. He looked now at Sarsfield with
contempt.</p>

<p>"The only troops Your Majesty may really be sure of," he
declared, "are those I brought with me from France, and they are
but seven thousand odd, while the Prince of Orange reviewed
thirty-six thousand at Dundalk." He stared about him with his
high-flown air of bravado, and added: "I can only repeat the advice
I gave Your Majesty when I heard that the usurper had landed&mdash;a
battle always seemed to me impossible&mdash;retreat, and delay, was our
only course. I would have burnt Dublin and, falling back from point
to point, have devastated the land completely."</p>

<p>"And you came as Ireland's friend," said Sarsfield, with bitter
sternness.</p>

<p>The king sat silent; he put his elbows on the table, his hand
over his eyes; he had aged greatly since he had come to Ireland;
his lips were continually unsteady and unnatural bistre stains in
the deep wrinkles of his face showed up the waxy sallowness of his
complexion.</p>

<p>Lauzun leant back in his seat with an air of cocksure
triumph.</p>

<p>"I would still urge that advice," he declared. "What is to
prevent us stealing away in the night, destroying Dublin, and
laying waste the country?"</p>

<p>"You would get no Irishman to obey such orders," said
Sarsfield.</p>

<p>Lauzun smiled complacently.</p>

<p>"I have enough French for such work."</p>

<p>The king uncovered his eyes.</p>

<p>"The plan seems to me too cruel," he said. "I have shed enough
blood. Let us give a blow for it to-morrow."</p>

<p>He pulled forward the map that Colonel Richard Hamilton and
General Sarsfield had carefully prepared; Tyrconnel snuffed the
candles.</p>

<p>No one believed that the Prince of Orange would risk a direct
attack; Hamilton eagerly pointed out that the enemy had failed, by
some curious oversight, to secure the road from Slane Bridge to
Duleek.</p>

<p>"It is the key to the whole position," said Sarsfield
keenly.</p>

<p>But Lauzun sneered; he vowed that Slane Bridge had no
importance, and brushed aside Sarsfield's argument that the enemy,
by using Slane Bridge and the Duleek road, might take them in the
rear and cut off their retreat to Dublin. James followed Lauzun's
opinion; the Prince of Orange had found a ford near the narrow glen
opposite; the struggle would be there; but he admitted the
importance of the ford at Rosnaree and agreed with the Frenchman
that it was worth while to send a detachment of dragoons there,
though Hamilton protested, "there were no men to spare for a post
of dubious importance."</p>

<p>"We have no artillery," remarked the king sombrely, and he added
that he would take his stand by the church of Donore; there was a
hill there, and with a glass he would be able to see the action
very well.</p>

<p>There was little more for any one to say; Lauzun asked no
advice, but stated his orders; Sir Neill O'Neill was to hold
Rosnaree ford; Berwick was to be stationed at Oldbridge&mdash;it could
not be so easy, the Frenchman boasted, for the Williamites to cross
the river and even if they succeeded in doing this, the rising
ground gave many chances of resisting their onslaughts.</p>

<p>Sarsfield asked dryly "where he was to be stationed?"</p>

<p>Lauzun hesitated, shrugged and vapoured; the king seemed sunk in
a musing indifference; Sarsfield was conscious that all the other
officers regarded him with jealous hostility.</p>

<p>The July night was hot; a fly buzzed in a soiled glass; an old
clock in a corner ticked loudly.</p>

<p>Lauzun at length announced that Sarsfield's cavalry was to hold
the road that ran from the Dublin highway to the river between
Oldbridge and Rosnaree; this seemed likely to be well out of the
main action, but on Sarsfield's protest and demand to be sent to
Slane Bridge, Lauzun conceded that he might be sent for to
reinforce Berwick who, with Tyrconnel and Hamilton, would be with
the bulk of the foot, and the right wing of horse and dragoons at
Oldbridge...or to support the king's escort at Donore.</p>

<p>Sarsfield listened no more; he saw enmity in all the faces bent
over the map on which were a few drops of grease from a guttering
candle; even Berwick would not look at him; but, as the short
council broke up, he saw Luttrell's crooked glance directed towards
him with malice.</p>

<p>Through the newly-made loopholes in the walls of the house the
summer air blew warm with the scent of the July pastures.</p>

<p>Sarsfield watched the king, with a small escort, mount and ride
towards Donore Church; his dark progress had an air of flight; it
was so still that a little wind could be heard, creeping through
and rustling the reeds on the edges of the marshy river banks.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-32" id="ch1-32"></a>THIRTY-TWO</h2>

<p class="first">
MAJOR-GENERAL PATRICK SARSFIELD of Lucan sat his horse at the
head of the third regiment of horse which was largely the result of
his own expense and effort; eager as himself, the men were taut in
their saddles behind him. He knew, that with the exception of
Berwick's brigade of Guards, his was the best cavalry in the
Jacobite army, though Luttrell, Galmoy, Abercorn and others had
fine regiments.</p>

<p>He had been intensely chagrined at being given a post to guard a
road which was not likely to be attacked; but he expected at any
moment a summons from Lauzun to join in the main action.</p>

<p>He believed it impossible, much as Lauzun disliked him and many
enemies as he had&mdash;in Tyrconnel, in Melfort, in Luttrell, possibly
in Berwick&mdash;that his fine body of horsemen would be left out of the
Jacobite defence.</p>

<p>The sky was of an unblemished azure, overlustred with the lovely
gold of the July sun; the gray-green Boyne took on tints of blue in
the shallows; on the lush grasses, where only yesterday the herds
had grazed, still glittered the drops of dew.</p>

<p>Sarsfield, a professional soldier since his early youth, felt no
excitement; he found it difficult to credit that this was the day,
reached after so much effort, intrigue and misery, which was at
last to decide, perhaps for many generations, the fate of Ireland;
he applauded the implacable resolution of William of Orange which
had forced a battle; he would have wished to have served under such
an energetic leader; he thought with disgust of the ill-managed
Jacobite retreat to Drogheda, pass after pass abandoned, the
Williamite army behind, the Williamite fleet hugging the coast. How
many difficulties the usurper had had to put underfoot before he
had been able to come to Ireland, delayed by conspiracy, forced to
send Dartmouth&mdash;accused of a scheme to destroy English navies and
arsenals&mdash;to the Tower, on every side harassed, hampered, menaced;
yet he was here, making a throw for it on the banks of Boyne
water.</p>

<p>"So," thought Sarsfield, "I would have done in his place."</p>

<p>And he longed to meet, face to face, with his troop of horse,
William of Orange at the head of his Blue Guards.</p>

<p>The heavy cannonade of the English shattered the pastoral peace
of the dawn, the Jacobites had no artillery with which to reply;
but Oldbridge had been tolerably well entrenched and fortified.</p>

<p>Sarsfield sent his adjutant, Major d'Archange, to discover how
the action went; he himself could see very little, owing to the
rising ground. D'Archange reported that the English right wing
under Douglas and the younger Schomberg, comprising nearly all the
English horse, had been on the road to Slane Bridge at six o'clock;
Schomberg, discovering unexpectedly the ford at Rosnaree, had
defeated O'Neill and his dragoons, and crossed there, driving the
Jacobites towards Duleek.</p>

<p>"And Slane Bridge could have been secured last night!" muttered
Sarsfield.</p>

<p>The Duke of Lauzun did his best to retrieve his error in not
guarding this ford; he immediately observed that he had been
outmanceuvred and threw his Frenchmen towards Rosnaree; but the
Prince of Orange had also observed the importance of this little
ford, and Douglas with two brigades of English infantry swept to
the assistance of Schomberg.</p>

<p>The enemies were perforce inactive, for between them there lay a
great boggy marsh where a horse could not move and in which even
the infantry sunk above their boots; but the English had crossed
the river, they watched the French across this morass.</p>

<p>Tyrconnel, Berwick and Hamilton remained at Oldbridge in charge
of nine regiments of foot and the right wing of horse and dragoons.
The Prince of Orange, learning that his right flank had crossed the
river, gave the signal for the Duke of Schomberg to attack this
main body of the Jacobites.</p>

<p>It had always been his secret intention, disclosed to none for
fear of treachery on the part of the English officers, to execute a
flank movement; he now began to put his design into practice.</p>

<p>Sarsfield, listening keenly, noted that the great cannon ceased
firing, and were followed by the rattle and pipe of drums and
fifes.</p>

<p>"'Tis an advance of the Guards," he said to Captain Maguire; the
two officers rode to the top of the incline on which the summer
grass was glowing and intently Sarsfield stared through his
perspective glass towards the river at Oldbridge, about two miles
away; the drums and fifes throbbed through the deep stillness of
the sunny day, the honeyed quiet of repose and summer idleness.</p>

<p>Sarsfield noted a yellow butterfly which flew from the flowering
grasses and lit with incredible fragile lightness on his horse's
ears, then fluttered away to descend again upon Maguire's gauntlet.
Turning in his saddle and using his glasses Sarsfield could see the
Dutch Blue Guards, one of the finest regiments in Europe, stepping
out, a steady block of azure under the July sun, towards the
Oldbridge ford. They were supported by a gray mass which he knew to
be that of the two Inniskillen regiments, another brigade and the
Danes; then they were crossing the river, it was no longer possible
to see the water, only the mass of blue and red, the sweeping green
of the leafy twigs each man carried in his hat; the men were
carrying their carbines in their teeth so as to keep them above the
water line; a heavy volley of musketry from the Irish crackled out,
but the blue mass advanced against the breastworks. As the Dutch,
Danes and Inniskillens struggled out of the water, the marshy banks
and the sedges, they were charged by Berwick's Horse; Sarsfield
could see the young man's white plumes floating in the blue air,
and the fiery glint of his unsheathed sword.</p>

<p>The Dutch scrambled clear of the muddy reaches of the Boyne and
met the cavalry with a sharp fire; the Derry men went swiftly to
their support, blue and gray mingled, pressed forward slowly,
advanced more quickly, held back the charge. In the bright
confusion Berwick was down; then old Schomberg sank from sight at
the crossing, but it was clear through the acrid confusion of the
dense smoke which there was no wind to disperse, the hideous
noises, the ugly mêlée of the battle, that the Williamites
continued to advance to, and beyond the Irish fortifications.
Richard Hamilton made gallant endeavours to check the steady
forward plunge of the Danes; but the Antrim men under him fled at
the first belch of fire; the fight at Oldbridge and the vicinity
was hand to hand; Parker charged the Huguenots; Berwick had rallied
his cavalry; unmistakably the Jacobites were falling back towards
Donore where the king watched the battle. Sarsfield saw that the
enemy were now beginning a second flank movement; another large
body of men were fighting through the river between Oldbridge and
Drogheda.</p>

<p>Major d'Archange, galloping up to Sarsfield, told him that the
Prince in person was leading this detachment; in the gray mass
behind him were the Ulstermen; the Jacobite cavalry fell back in
stern retreat to Plantin House near the Drogheda road; they paused,
turned about and made a stand; Sarsfield saw the colours go up, he
believed he could distinguish Berwick, Hamilton and Parker; the
glass shook in his hand.</p>

<p>"The Irish," said the <i>aide,</i> who had lost his hat, and
with a mechanical movement put back the flowing hair from his face,
"are certainly bested&mdash;I believe Lauzun has given up all for lost
and is making for the Dublin road."</p>

<p>"My God!" muttered Sarsfield, not in blasphemy. "My God! are
there no orders for us? Has Lauzun forgotten that I exist? Does he
think so lowly of us that he believes my men would be of no use to
him?"</p>

<p>Major d'Archange replied that from what he could learn there
were "no generals and no orders" any longer; it was each for
himself; some of the Irish were running like scared sheep; almost
all the Williamites were across the river; the Prince of Orange had
laid his plans with great skill and put them into execution with
great audacity.</p>

<p>"The Horse make a stand at Plantin House?" asked Sarsfield.</p>

<p>"Yes, to allow the remnants of the infantry to escape to Duleek,
they show great devotion."</p>

<p>"And the Prince of Orange attacks in person?"</p>

<p>"So, sir, 'tis reported."</p>

<p>Sarsfield drew his lace handkerchief from his gallooned
pocket-hole and wiped the sweat from his face, it was not his
intention to show the least agitation but he had a nervous horror
of this inaction which became almost unendurable. He had attired
himself for the battle with precision, no officer in either army
flourished more bravely in scarlet and bullion, fine lace and
spotless plumes. His fine Irish horse was well groomed and
furnished with a splendid set of harness. Sarsfield nervously
turned his eyes towards the men sitting rigidly behind him beneath
the slope; he could see that they too, were strained to the utmost;
they were so far from the battle; there was something hideous and
sinister in the peace of the fenced fields, the swaying of the
grass in the breeze, the clear pearl blue of the sky overhead; some
of O'Neill's dragoons came struggling up; their commander was badly
wounded; such as had unscathed horses were riding <i>ventre à
terre</i> towards Duleek; Sarsfield sent Captain Nargle to rally
them; they paid no heed, but disappeared over the hillocks.</p>

<p>"Since no one will give us orders," declared Sarsfield
vehemently, "we will act without 'em." And he bade his troop follow
him in the direction of Plantin House.</p>

<p>At this spot was taking place the last stand of the Irish; all
else, on the scattered battlefield, was chaos; Berwick had resolved
at any cost to gain time; but he had to face greatly superior
numbers, and one whose name was worth many veteran troops; the
Prince of Orange was himself leading the attack; in the first
charge he made, at the head of the Inniskilleners, he was repulsed
fiercely; but the counter charge of the Irish was foiled by the
gleaming defence of the pikes of the Huguenots; the Danes grimly
supported their comrades; the Prince of Orange again led a charge
against Berwick and Hamilton; the undaunted ardour of their king
filled his men with fiery enthusiasm; since his landing at
Carrickfergus his personality and his actions had made him the
darling of the north, as Patrick Sarsfield was the darling of the
south.</p>

<p>He had been wounded the night before and carried one arm in a
sling; he had been unhorsed and down in the mud of the Boyne ford;
his holster pistols had been broken, he had been lost in the mêlée
and had had an Ulsterman's carbine thrust at his breast in the
confusion; he was a mark for all the Jacobite fire; for on the
breast of his blue uniform glittered the costly diamonds of the
star of the garter.</p>

<p>"If we could get him," muttered Berwick, "we should end the
war." And the impetuous young man sought out his princely cousin
through the press of man and horse.</p>

<p>When Sarsfield and his troop of horse reached Plantin House the
Jacobite resistance was broken; Berwick had been thrown and
trampled on, Hamilton taken a prisoner before the Prince he had
betrayed; the rest were in retreat towards the Duleek road; but
their half-hour's gallant fight had prevented the total destruction
of the infantry which was now moving in disorder towards Donore and
Dublin.</p>

<p>Sarsfield's fresh troop of nearly four hundred men was useless
save to swell the flight; his lieutenant-colonel, Lord Kinsale,
began to curse bitterly.</p>

<p>"Can we not," cried Sarsfield, "charge again?"</p>

<p>But his men, without waiting for his orders, were already
swinging along the Dublin road. Berwick had succeeded in rallying
his broken troop; Sarsfield made his way to the side of the young
officer who had already recovered that noble serenity which masked
the impetuous ardour of his youth; it was a quality inherited from
his uncle, the Earl of Marlborough, a peculiar dignity that
impressed even when disguising base actions.</p>

<p>Berwick had been unhorsed three times; once he had been wounded;
his right sleeve was in rags, a long bruise disfigured one cheek,
his hair was clotted with dust and sweat. "We charged ten times,"
he remarked, "the best part of the Foot should have gotten off;" in
the same breath he asked Sarsfield for his handkerchief and,
receiving it, wiped away a trickle of blood that ran from a cut on
his forehead into his eyes; he had the coolness, the insensibility
of one bred to arms from childhood.</p>

<p>"All lost? A defeat?" cried Sarsfield. "'Tis incredible&mdash;my God!
incredible!"</p>

<p>"They were superior in number and we had no artillery," said
Berwick calmly. "Besides, the Irish ran."</p>

<p>Sarsfield felt sick; a frightful paleness overspread his face,
he was wounded, humiliated in the most vulnerable places of his
manhood; he felt abased, fooled, insulted.</p>

<p>"Defeat," he repeated.</p>

<p>Berwick glanced at him, noted his appearance and glancing at his
own tattered sleeve and scarred arm, said simply:</p>

<p>"Yes, we had bad luck."</p>

<p>"Where is the king?" exclaimed Sarsfield. "Surely he has some
desire to make a further stand?"</p>

<p>But all, pressing along the dusty road, were crying: "To Dublin!
To Dublin!"</p>

<p>All was confusion, there was no one either to give Sarsfield
orders or to take his commands. The bitterest mortification was in
his heart. He asked of every one of authority he passed as he rode
at the head of his fresh troops:</p>

<p>"Why was I not sent for? Why was I sent to that outpost and left
there?"</p>

<p>The officers whom he questioned shrugged or laughed or grimaced
according to their humour. But one who overheard him cried with a
bitterness equal to his own:</p>

<p>"You chose to be a pawn and now you know what it is to be kicked
off the board."</p>

<p>"I did not know it was you, Luttrell," said Sarsfield, staring
at the speaker; their horses were jostling side by side in the
crowd; Luttrell was much defaced with dust and smoke; his cravat
was swathed, a bloody rag, round his neck, a shot had carried away
the heel of one of his boots; he tossed back the lank tangle of his
dark hair from his squinting eyes.</p>

<p>"You!" He grinned at Sarsfield. "You have been no use, no, none
at all! Look at the coil we have gotten into! This is the result of
your pragmatical virtue!"</p>

<p>He edged his rearing roan away; Sarsfield could not speak, even
his own horse were leaving him, each man seeking helter-skelter his
own safety; a field of standing corn with the sun on it seemed to
Sarsfield the oddest sight in the world. He made his way to the
little hill at Donore where, beside the old church, King James had
watched the struggle at Oldbridge, at Rosnaree, at Plantin House;
he had been well out of the action; he showed the greatest
bitterness in his old yellow face, a man well used to defeat, he
had been again cruelly buffeted; he stared at Tyrconnel and
Sarsfield galloping up to the churchyard wall.</p>

<p>"How you Irish fight!" he muttered; then, seeing all his men in
full retreat about him, he gave orders that all were to fall back
on Dublin; orders that were not needed, as the entire Jacobite army
was pressing towards the capital.</p>

<p>Sarsfield turned in his saddle and looked back at the Boyne;
through the smoke which had spread in a thick haze from Oldbridge
to Plantin House he could discern the colours of the Dutch, Danes,
English and Huguenot regiments slowly advancing; he saw that to
charge the enemy was impossible by reason of the double ditches and
a little brook.</p>

<p>"We are not going to abandon Dublin?" he asked of Tyrconnel who,
breathing heavily, was trying to ease his smoke-inflamed eyes with
the end of a handkerchief dipped in water from his flask.</p>

<p>"I don't know," muttered the viceroy. "I don't know."</p>

<p>Sarsfield glanced at the graves in the little churchyard, at the
church, empty, silent; the priest had fled.</p>

<p>Luttrell and Galmoy set their horses at Donore hill and stayed
them by the king; Luttrell shouted:</p>

<p>"Sire! Lauzun is ahead&mdash;on the Dublin road!"</p>

<p>Galmoy looked at Sarsfield with contempt; he whispered a
half-heard remark about his brilliant uniform, his unblemished
horse; then the two were away, their broken baldrics and ragged
cravats flying behind them.</p>

<p>The king turned his head towards Dublin; the road was choked
with soldiers; they overspread into the fields, beating down fences
and hedges, trampling crops.</p>

<p>Many of them did not seem to see much sting in their defeat,
they were even elated that they had been allowed to draw off in
fairly good order, and congratulated themselves that they had kept
up so fine a countenance; and that the Prince of Orange observing
it, had thought it more prudent to halt and suffer them to march
away.</p>

<p>The truth was that the Prince believed that the Irish would
scatter and then surrender; a sharp pursuit would only have brought
about a useless rout and bloodshed, and of that he had always a
horror. Besides, Schomberg was dead. William's siege train had not
arrived, he did not know of what value were the regiments of
militia which James had still in reserve in Dublin. He reflected
that it was perhaps imprudent to advance on the capital while
Drogheda remained untaken. Without a commissariat with the army and
the land so exhausted that nothing could be derived from it the
victorious general did not think it prudent to advance farther. He
had, besides, out of the last forty hours spent thirty-five in the
saddle, with brief intervals.</p>

<p>Sarsfield did not know these considerations. He only thought
with sick rage and mortification that as the pursuit had been so
mild they might have turned about and made a counter-attack.</p>

<p>The retreat settled into a more orderly march as the enemy made
no great attempt to harry their flight.</p>

<p>Sarsfield believed that the Williamites were something
disorganised by the suddenness of their victory. From a military
point of view the action had not been of much account; from a
political one even Sarsfield, who was no politician, could see that
it might, nay, that it must be of tremendous account.</p>

<p>A detachment of the enemy followed the Jacobites, but every time
there was a forced halt at a defile or pass, the Williamites halted
also.</p>

<p>"They are allowing us to go very peacefully," smiled Berwick.
"Nay, I believe they are glad to build us a golden bridge to be rid
of us; if old Schomberg had not fallen, this had been a rout
indeed!"</p>

<p>"Why is the doubled-damned, confounded Dutchman letting us off
so cheap?" shouted Tyrconnel.</p>

<p>"He wishes," replied Berwick, "to shed as little blood as
possible, and he thinks we shall abandon Dublin without any more
ado."</p>

<p>The young man had the complacent calm of one who has done his
utmost; beneath the stain of blood and the bruises his olive
complexion showed no more than its usual pallor. With a stiff
precision and a control which showed him already inured to the most
disconcerting chances, he straightened his cravat and baldric;
Sarsfield riding up beside him as their cavalry passed through a
defile between marshy ground broke out:</p>

<p>"Could you not guess, my lord duke, what it meant to me to be
left out of this?"</p>

<p>Berwick's almond eyes turned on him without friendliness.</p>

<p>"Lauzun was in command, General Sarsfield."</p>

<p>"Lauzun is malicious or a fool!"</p>

<p>"It may be," returned Berwick, "I did as I was bid," he added,
with a stare; "and so did you. I suppose neither of us has any
reason to blame the other."</p>

<p>"You might, my lord, have said a word for me. You might, on your
own authority, have sent for me."</p>

<p>As Berwick did not answer, he added passionately: "Luttrell,
Galmoy&mdash;had their chances."</p>

<p>"I know nothing about it," declared Berwick; "Lauzun made no
confidant of me. Luttrell and Galmoy are your enemies. I believe
you know why."</p>

<p>"And you, too, an enemy," thought Sarsfield; he knew they both
thought of Honor.</p>

<p>The straggling, broken ranks pressed towards Dublin through
suffocating dust.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-33" id="ch1-33"></a>THIRTY-THREE</h2>

<p class="first">
KING JAMES brought the news of his own defeat to Dublin Castle;
after a ride of near five hours he entered the capital with his
staff officers and a small escort at ten o'clock at night; the
victor Prince had halted at the pass of the Naul; a dead weight of
fatigue was on every one.</p>

<p>"Dusty, wounded and tired soldiers were coming in till one
o'clock, several of James's Guards came straggling in without
pistols or swords, and could not tell what had become of His
Majesty. Near ten that night he came in with near 200 horse all in
disorder. We concluded now that it was a total rout and that the
enemy were just ready to come into the town, but were greatly
surprised when an hour or two afterwards we heard the whole body of
Irish Horse come up in very good order, with kettle-drums, hautboys
and trumpets, and early the next morning the French and a great
party of Irish foot. These being a little rested marched out again
to meet the enemy, which was supposed to draw nigh."</p>

<p>So wrote "a person of quality" resident in Dublin; the capital
was astir with rumour, excitement, alarm and joy; already the
Catholics were packing up their goods, the priests taking the
shrines and relics from the churches and chapels; the women were
running about looking for their men.</p>

<p>James was received at the castle gates by Lady Tyrconnel who,
after he was upstairs, asked him "what he would have for supper,"
he then gave her an account of "what a breakfast he had got that
made him have little stomach for his supper."</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards he shut himself in his apartments, none
with him but his priests.</p>

<p>As Sarsfield rode into the courtyard, with all his troop now
very orderly, the kettledrums beating, he glanced up at Tyrconnel's
Irish flag hanging livid in the first light of the dawn.</p>

<p>It was full day before he could send a message to his house in
Fishamble Street; he begged Honor to come to the castle, he did not
know when he might be able to leave his duty; with several other
officers of high rank he slept on rolled-up mantles in the
guard-room; when they awoke after a few uneasy hours they heard
that the king had already sent for the Lord Mayor and Council.</p>

<p>Sarsfield went into the great throne-room; it was thronged with
men and women; Honor was beside Lady Tyrconnel, she gave her
husband a cold smile. The viceroy had adjusted his attire with
surprising quickness; only his cut chin and bandaged cheek showed
he had been in a battle; Sarsfield could see neither Luttrell,
Galmoy, nor Berwick.</p>

<p>The king stood on the steps of the throne; he was forlorn and
majestic, tall, haggard and bent; when he spoke his voice was
steady; he looked before him as if he spoke to an empty room.</p>

<p>He told them all "that though the Irish did not desert him as
did his subjects in England yet when it had come to the trial they
had basely fled the field, and left it a spoil to his enemies, nor
could they be prevailed upon to rally, though the loss in the whole
defeat was inconsiderable, so that henceforth he determined never
to head an Irish army and was now resolved to shift for himself, as
they must do. He advised them not to burn the town, but to submit
to the Prince of Orange who was a merciful man and would set the
prisoners at liberty."</p>

<p>Many were confounded at this for they had expected to have made
a stand at Dublin; Lauzun, strutting and important, gave no sign of
his feelings; he appeared to try to diminish the importance of the
whole affair.</p>

<p>The king moved from the throne, he held himself with
dignity.</p>

<p>"Justice," he said, "is on my side, but Fate is against me.
Enough blood has been spilt already. Release all the Protestant
prisoners you have and surrender the city. You are faced with the
Prince of Orange, he is a merciful man."</p>

<p>He repeated reflectively this tribute to his son-in-law, nephew,
conqueror, and sighed; perhaps he recalled that he had not been a
merciful man and that his pitiless cruelty had not availed; he had
no more to say, but he appeared to linger in a state of
indecision.</p>

<p>Sarsfield, unnoticed in his corner, put his hand before his
eyes; the crowd broke into whispers, movements; Lauzun took
snuff.</p>

<p>The French officers and many of the Irish knew that by the
flight of James to France the victory of William at the Boyne would
be converted from a mere flourishing military skirmish into a
victory of the first magnitude. But they also knew that James would
listen to nothing. He was as sharply determined to fly as he had
been that wretched day at Whitehall when he had ordered Lord
Craven's guard to give place to the Dutchmen; standing there, tall
and gaunt, before them, broken from the battle in which he had
taken no part, in this hour of his defeat, of his evasion, of his
cowardice, James II was not without a certain dignity, even a
certain grandeur; the seal of utter failure, of complete misfortune
was upon him, but it was borne with a touch of magnificence. There
was some nobility in the gentle way in which he referred to the
merciful qualities of his rival, something of the fascination of
his race and breed in the grace with which he took farewell of his
adherents, and walked from the room and, in a melancholy, stately
fashion, towards the staircase, leaving "each to shift for
himself," as he said.</p>

<p>Yet whatever gloss of grandeur he might give to his behaviour it
smacked not only of foolishness but of baseness. He betrayed by his
flight a whole nation, a whole faith, a whole dynasty; he showed
himself to be unworthy of the sacrifice of the meanest
rapparee.</p>

<p>Sarsfield, watching the king through a cloud of unhappy
thoughts, heard Tyrconnel's voice loudly raised "for an immediate
surrender, for making terms with the Prince of Orange, for giving
up everything&mdash;" Sarsfield started out of his gloomy reverie and
hotly recommended the sternest possible resistance...</p>

<p>The king checked the argument between the two men who so
disliked each other and who were so opposed in ideas, who had
flamed at once into active opposition.</p>

<p>"You had best fall back on Limerick," he advised, "and discuss
your plans there."</p>

<p>For himself he was riding at once for Waterford, where the
<i>Comte de Lauzun</i> rode at anchor; he had done with Ireland. He
complained again that "the Irish had infamously forsaken him," as,
with the stiff step of age and holding on to the balusters, he
proceeded down the stairs.</p>

<p>An <i>aide-de-camp</i> broke into the king's painful progress;
he came from Berwick. That energetic young leader had gathered
together seven thousand foot at Brazeel, he asked his father for
reinforcements; his design was to stay the advance of the Prince of
Orange. James, after some hesitation, ordered some of Luttrell's
dragoons and some of Abercorn's horse to his son's relief, but he
was in no wise heartened by this news; he was still for
Waterford.</p>

<p>Sarsfield watched the king go; again he had been
overlooked...for good reasons, no doubt; in no way had he
distinguished himself; he wondered if Luttrell and Galmoy were at
Brazeel. All agreed that the next stand must be made at Limerick or
Galway; hasty but not disorderly preparations were made for
retreat; apart from the hopes held out by Berwick at Brazeel, it
was not believed likely that the Prince of Orange would advance in
any impetuous haste on Dublin; a peaceful occupation was known to
be his desire, and all were well aware how keenly he wished to
avoid a personal encounter with his father-in-law; it might easily
be two or three days before the victorious army entered the
capital.</p>

<p>Tyrconnel, suddenly heartened and drinking himself into a
patriotic fervour, swore to defend Limerick; out of a cloud of
argument, passion and excitement the resolve to abandon Dublin and
make a final stand there was come to; it was then late in the
afternoon; exhausted and heavyhearted, Sarsfield turned to his
private affairs.</p>

<p>Already the Protestants were coming out of their homes and
rejoicing openly in the streets. Honor was safe with the other
women, her child and nurse and her goods, and with that order,
prudence and decorum which characterised all her actions, she had
prepared her flight.</p>

<p>Greeting her husband without either reproach or enthusiasm she
had asked him a few direct questions, and when she had learned that
all was lost had made her arrangements without stupid haste or
alarmed delay. She could accept defeat like a soldier's daughter.
Her peaked little face, now free of paint, showed resolute but
wistful; she neither invited nor offered caresses, but she pleased
her husband's pride by relying entirely on his advice and
protection. She told him that it was already decided that the
Duchess of Tyrconnel was to go to France...</p>

<p>"Will you go, too, Honor?"</p>

<p>"Is not another stand to be made at Limerick?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But you wished to return to France&mdash;it will be safe for
you with the king; I should not resent it, Honor."</p>

<p>"No." Her voice was hard. "But I will stay&mdash;do we go to-night to
Limerick?"</p>

<p>"Within a few hours."</p>

<p>But before he could go an imperative duty claimed him; Honor was
safe, amply protected and provided for; but Ishma waited at Lucan
for his news. Lucan would, with Dublin, fall into the hands of the
invader. But Sarsfield's thoughts scarcely touched the fact that he
was a ruined man now, would be outlawed, his estate confiscated; he
was thinking of Ishma, waiting; perhaps she had already heard
frightful rumours...He must snatch a few hours in which to fetch
her himself; there was now no choice in the disposal of the girl,
she must go to Limerick with his wife. Leaving Lord Kinsale in
charge of his troop and unattended, riding a fresh, stout horse, he
took the road for his demesne of Lucan.</p>

<p>Before he left Dublin came the news that the army gathered
together at Brazeel had completely dispersed; before the
reinforcements could arrive Berwick had lost every man...</p>

<p>The road was now open to the Williamites, and Sarsfield had
another reason for haste. As he neared the gates he encountered
Madame de Bonnac on a fine jennet, in company with her husband and
another French officer; he wondered if she intended to retire to
France with Tyrconnel's wife&mdash;he hoped so.</p>

<p>"General Sarsfield!" she cried out, when he would have passed.
"Do you forsake us like His Majesty?"</p>

<p>He was forced to rein up his horse and reply. She was composed,
brilliant as usual; she even seemed as if exulting in some secret
pleasure.</p>

<p>"She is glad of my discomfiture," thought Sarsfield.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" she exclaimed softly, peering through the
ghastly light of the street lamps, "you look very pale and
overborne, General Sarsfield."</p>

<p>Sarsfield explained, more to her grave husband than to her, that
he "rode to Lucan to secure some papers and other property, and
should not be gone from his post more than a few hours or so."</p>

<p>Mons. de Bonnac said it was very wise to save what one could,
such as title deeds; his wife's vivid prominent eyes flashed a look
at Sarsfield that sneered:</p>

<p>"You are going to fetch your little mistress."</p>

<p>Sarsfield rode on; such a sudden gust of laughter was borne
after him from the lady that he wondered negligently what her
companions could have said to amuse her, for it was the laugh of
one surprised into sudden merriment.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-34" id="ch1-34"></a>THIRTY-FOUR</h2>

<p class="first">
SARSFIELD rode along the banks of the Liffey in the summer
twilight, his estates lay away from the road that led to the Boyne,
and all was silent.</p>

<p>As he came clear into the open country and felt the low evening
breeze on his forehead a hundred wild enthusiasms burnt in his
heart. "They are baseless exaltations," he thought, "but the
delusion they give is exquisite."</p>

<p>He had no longer need for action, and into his tired mind
slipped pictures of the day of battle that he hardly knew he had
seen. His forced inaction had caused him to observe very clearly
sights and episodes that if he had been hotly engaged he would
never have seen; the English floundering in the bog beyond
Donore&mdash;the Irish stragglers who had thrown away their arms being
shot down "like hares among the corn"&mdash;the scattered wounded
horsemen riding pell-mell up and down the slopes&mdash;Lauzun's
senseless bravado of "dying on the field"&mdash;Berwick's Horse
struggling across the Nanney Water, and across the hill of
Cruizrath&mdash;the hard fighting below Donore&mdash;the sound of the Dutch
bugles&mdash;the sudden stoppage of their drums as the waters of the
Boyne, swollen by so many men, rose to their waists, their
armpits&mdash;the rain of badly-aimed shot from the Meath bank&mdash;the six
small Irish guns firing frantically against the heavy enemy
artillery; and with this transient confusion the curving river
embracing the battlefield, the wide plain with the old graves of
the kings of half magic lineage who had been conquered by the race
of Milith, as the native Irish had been conquered by the Dutchman's
mercenaries; lonely, lonely, even amid the mêlée of the battle were
those solitary tumuli between Rosnaree and Oldbridge, those remote
memorials of another world.</p>

<p>Into that other world the spirit of Sarsfield travelled; wooed
and soothed by the murmur of the Liffey that was like the murmur of
the low voice of Ishma, blithe, serene and lovely; the peace of the
July evening almost effaced from his lacerated heart the
bewilderment and fury of his bitter humiliation; his vivacious and
impetuous spirit even began to throb with renewed hope. If the
king, poor irresolute creature that he was, returned to France and
took with him the braggadocio Frenchman, Lauzun, and the incapable,
perhaps treacherous Tyrconnel, Melfort, and such men; if he even by
some chance took with him the arrogant Berwick, why, then would
come honourably the opportunity that he, Sarsfield, had refused
when offered with dishonour by Luttrell and Madame de Bonnac.</p>

<p>The whole of the west still remained to the Jacobites...He might
organise the defence of Limerick, ay, and hold it as Derry had held
out against De Rosen. The foreigners, the harpies, and the jobbers
gone, the native Irish might honourably undertake their own
defence; and he wondered if he could, in honesty, persuade his wife
to go with Lady Tyrconnel to France. She would be happy there, he
thought, away from him and amid her comforts and luxuries; if she
had found Dublin odious, how much rougher would be Limerick, in the
midst of the most boggy and desolate parts of the country and
deprived of all but the sternest necessities of life; nay, better
for Honor to be lapped in the silken graces of Versailles among
women of her own breed and misfortune, than side by side, through
all the grim perils of the siege, with the husband whom she did not
love, to whom she could not even offer sympathy or comradeship. He
had seen, at the top of the painted staircase, the coldness of her
little face through the dark grimness of the shadows as she had
looked at him. Then his warm impulsive heart was filled with pity
for Honor with her impossible love, and even for Berwick; he pitied
the inexperience of that youthful commander who had so gallantly
and hopefully gathered together his army at Brazeel, then seen all
scatter, leaving him ridiculous.</p>

<p>Strange that the king should fly! Sarsfield anticipated the
verdict of Louvois in his estimate of James Stewart; he thought he
had "lost everything by his ignorance, overconfidence and folly";
in the eyes of the proudest, most severe military caste in Europe,
the French, this runaway monarch must cut a deplorable
figure...</p>

<p>As Sarsfield reached the gates of his own demesne he forgot the
king; fragments of thought disturbed him; could one hold Limerick
and Galway? How much help would the French continue to give? Could
one trust Tyrconnel, Galmoy, Luttrell&mdash;if not, whom?</p>

<p>The native Irish could easily be roused to make a stand; he knew
their temperament, quickly cast down, quickly raised up&mdash;"like
myself."</p>

<p>He began to feel almost light-headed; the fatigue, the long and
bitter anxiety of the last few days and nights, the tension of the
mind began to react more strongly on the body; the hurried and
shameful retreat to Dublin, the confused disgraceful scenes in
Dublin Castle, the ride back through the city, the hasty gallop to
Lucan (for he had no more than just time for this errand) had left
him, after all the stress, in that mood when, through fatigue, the
invisible world draws closely about a man. He was no longer sure
what he had himself experienced and what had come to him in dreams
and visions.</p>

<p>His park was very desolate under the golden shadows of the July
twilight.</p>

<p>He found his mansion empty, the usual guardians gone, the
bailiff fled; he was surprised that his people had not more
loyalty. But he steadied himself by remembering the wild rumours,
the uncertain news that must have been brought to them, and, after
all, why should one expect these poor creatures to have more
fortitude than a king? If James were to fly, swift as a startled
hare, why, many would be in his track.</p>

<p>But he stayed his horse by his deserted home and sorrow pierced
his heart; then he rode about, called, hallo'ed and knocked; yet
knew the while there was no one there.</p>

<p>The sun was setting behind the beech trees; Sarsfield rode away
from the empty house; his mind again veered from the poignancy of
the present moment and dwelt perversely on the incidents of the
bitter months which had passed since he had landed, so full of
hope, with King James at Kinsale. And all that frustration seemed
haunted with the smooth, radiant, placid and yet half-malicious
beauty of Madame de Bonnac, and with the cold, reproachful, hostile
glances of Honor, his wife.</p>

<p>There were no swans on the lake; in the dark water lay the red
reflection of the sunset; the trees in full leafage rustled like
the flowing of water, like the running of the Liffey.</p>

<p>"Tyrconnel," thought Sarsfield wildly, guiding his beautiful
horse through the <i>allées</i>, "thinks all is over. Now, perhaps,
I may have a chance to show what I think."</p>

<p>Here hidden in his demesne of Lucan was his soul's solace and
delight; only once had he kissed her...to-night she would ride
behind him, close on the friendly horse.</p>

<p>He turned up the path which led to the holy well; against the
sky, in the universal gold of the last hour of light, he could see
the massive, dark and mournful outline of the ancient cross;
instinctively he stayed his horse, murmured a prayer and made the
sign of the cross on his own forehead.</p>

<p>The may trees had lost all blossoms, but the small leaves showed
compactly against the dazzling clarity of the sky, as did the
outline of the little church and the cottage.</p>

<p>For a second Sarsfield lost heart. He thought, "If every one is
fled, who protected Ishma?"</p>

<p>He pressed his hand to his eyes, and was surprised at the
roughness of the war gauntlet on his lids and the shaking of his
own fingers.</p>

<p>But he consoled himself rapidly: "The priest would be faithful,
the dwarf woman and the dog, and who should come here as yet
ravaging? I am crazy, the enemy can be no nearer than the pass of
Naul. Besides"&mdash;his comfort grew valiant&mdash;"the Prince of Orange
permits no plundering."</p>

<p>He rode up to the cottage and dismounted. There was no light in
any of the little windows, no light in the church save the unhuman
glow of the sunset on the panes. He struck on the door and called
her name. No answer. Sarsfield, to steady himself, took a long time
in securing his horse to one of the may trees; he looked about in
the gathering obscurity, hoping to see some living creature in the
darkening park. He returned to the cottage; there was no smoke from
the chimney. "What matter of that&mdash;'tis a warm evening, and the dog
does not bark because he knows the step of a friend." He
knocked.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Begg! Mrs. Begg!" He opened the door.</p>

<p>"Ishma, I am here! Do not be frightened!" He entered the small
empty room. "Ishma! Ishma!"</p>

<p>The room was dark; even the crimson glow of the sunset had
receded from the window panes; outside was cold, violet twilight;
Sarsfield had a tinder box in his hand and soon contrived a light.
There was a taper standing on the shelf near the door. He lit that
and saw her spinning-wheel with white wool on the thrum, and over a
wooden chair was the Irish saffron shirt he had seen her wear, but
nothing else of hers...</p>

<p>She had gone. He passed into the other room. He called upon her
and upon the dwarf woman, Mrs. Brighita Begg, with a wilder and a
wilder accent. But he knew that he shouted merely to relieve his
own secret passion, for he had no hope of any response. The cottage
was abandoned. He had known as much since he had first seen the
dark windows.</p>

<p>Ishma had gone.</p>

<p>Sarsfield stood on the threshold of the bedchamber which he knew
must be hers; so straight and simple the bed with the white linen
coverlet, so sweet the air of purity and calm! The whitewashed
walls, the wooden crucifix, the summer flowers tenderly arranged; a
box of women's work, a pair of latchet shoes, a crock of water&mdash;all
hers, he knew; he had had to stoop to enter the little room. He
held the taper high to scatter the bewildering shadows.</p>

<p>"Ishma, Ishma!"</p>

<p>Beyond the spinning-wheel lay a dark shape in a pool of shade;
Sarsfield sprang forward and saw, with the utmost horror, the dead
body of Brian the wolfhound.</p>

<p>The animal had been violently maltreated, his throat was gashed,
his body battered, his collar of fine, plaited Irish gold gone.</p>

<p>Sarsfield stood staring down, the taper sunk in his hand. Had
the dog been slain in endeavouring to defend his mistress?</p>

<p>The thought was unbearable; but as in a vision Sarsfield saw the
girl leaping from her bed, ruffians rushing in on her, the dog
snarling to the defence, a murderous struggle, the girl running to
the cross, standing there at bay, but snatched away while the dog
stiffened in his last agony...</p>

<p>"I must control myself, this is but fantasy."</p>

<p>He stared round the room; nothing disturbed, nothing overthrown,
not even the sheets ruffled, not even the bowl of flowers
overcast...then, no violence...the dog had been slain by one of his
own kind, in dying he had dragged himself back to the sanctuary
that in life he had so proudly guarded...</p>

<p>With this exercise of reason Sarsfield struggled to subdue his
anguish; even at this moment she might be in Dublin asking for
him...</p>

<p>He knelt down beside the animal and stroked the rough fur,
stared with pity and admiration at the glazed eyes, at all the
blood and foam about the snarling mouth, the stiff, bleeding limbs.
Then he took the taper and carefully examined the floor of the
cottage; he sighed with relief; his desperate surmise had been
correct. There was a trail of blood from the outer door to the
bedchamber; the animal had dragged himself from without to die.</p>

<p>Sarsfield passed out of the cottage; it was odd to see his horse
waiting patiently under the may trees which bore little discoloured
ribbon flags from the last festival which fluttered in the dusk; he
passed into the open church.</p>

<p>In vain he called the priest; the silence was heavy. The
building was as he had last seen it, undesecrated; and (it seemed
to him) untouched; the silver vessels and silk-stitched cloths were
on the altar, the mournful and sombre faces of saints frowned out
of the shadows as he held aloft his taper. In every cranny he
searched in hope that the girl would be hiding there. There was no
one. His wild fantasy again possessed him; he began to mutter to
himself:</p>

<p>"She was not mortal, the sidhe have taken her, she has returned
to the courts of Mirvanna, under the lakes, in the depths of the
hills; she has vanished into the elements, even now she may be
shining over Irrelagh."</p>

<p>He came out into the churchyard; the heavy tombstones showed
dark in the uncut grass. There was, even in that moment, rest and
peace in the heavy lines of the cross rising a shadow among the
shadows.</p>

<p>Sarsfield was able to think:</p>

<p>"How much suffering when that was cut a thousand years ago! And
all now dust...And I shall be dust in so much less than a hundred
years, and what will all this matter?"</p>

<p>His duty tugged at him; it would be something of a scandal if it
was known he had left his regiment at such a time, on such an
errand; there was every urgent need to return at once to
Dublin.</p>

<p>"But first I will bury the dog."</p>

<p>He would not have her chamber defiled and he felt a brotherhood
with the animal; he took off his gorget, coat, baldric and sword;
he found a spade and dug a deep hole at the foot of the hawthorn
trees; the leaves and the sacred ribbons rustled above his head; he
stuck the taper on the edge of the stone well to give him light.
The exercise of his strength gave him ease; he never thought how
grotesque it might seem to many that Major-General Sarsfield should
bury a dog with his own hands.</p>

<p>He fetched the animal, laid him in the grave, and cast in the
earth; it was then nearly completely dark, but the taper held.</p>

<p>He returned to her room, after he had put on his coat, and
gathered into a sheet all that might have been hers, leaving the
room bare save for the furniture; her crucifix he put into his
breast. Then he returned to his horse and fastened the sheet to the
saddle and rode to the lake; he cast in there all that he believed
might have been used by Ishma&mdash;her shoes, her flowers, her
needlework, her smock, and watched the pure water suck at the sheet
that contained them&mdash;the sheet in which she had lain...He rode back
to the mansion and searched again, looked into the priest's
apartment; there was no disorder; it was as if everybody, at a
given signal, had taken flight.</p>

<p>Sarsfield endeavoured to use his intellect to dominate his
emotion. Why, because he had found the dead dog, should he imagine
any evil? The girl, the dwarf and the priest might have fled with
his other dependants days before. They might have gone on the first
news of a possible engagement at the Boyne; they might have gone
immediately the army had left Dublin for the campaign, immediately
he had taken farewell of her...How was he to tell? He was lost in
wild conjecture, he had had no communication with any of them
since. The priest, a man of wisdom, of foresight, might have
withdrawn the two poor women to some place of shelter; there were a
hundred comforting possibilities. The dog Brian&mdash;how could he
account for that? And he tried to accept that the creature had
fought with another of its own kind&mdash;yes, that might be. There were
many fierce, half-maddened dogs abroad now, he had seen them on the
high roads searching for a human carcase...On this he would let his
mind rest; he forced himself by a supreme effort to remember that
he had other responsibilities&mdash;Honor and his child awaited him in
Dublin&mdash;there was, too, his military duty. What was the use of his
boasting of his wish to do something for Ireland, his complaint of
his inaction, when he was thrown out of his way by an incident like
this? The girl was gone but not lost. And he reminded himself again
that she had been with friends, that the whole countryside was
Jacobite; there was no one who could possibly have entered his
demesne and harmed her...No stragglers from the great defeat had
touched Lucan, not so much as a twig was broken in the park&mdash;all
reason told him that she was safe.</p>

<p>But he stayed his horse at his wide-set gates and asked himself
wildly:</p>

<p>"Where have I been? What have I done and seen?"</p>

<p>Webs of fantasy encumbered his aching heart; Ishma floated past
him on the night breeze, in the first falling leaves of the dry
summer; as he rode back to Dublin she seemed to call him from the
gray waters of the Liffey.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-35" id="ch1-35"></a>THIRTY-FIVE</h2>

<p class="first">
THE Prince Of Orange was advancing slowly from the Naul; in this
Pass he had slept in his carriage; most of his troops bivouacked on
the ground without tents; it appeared as if he wished to give his
enemies time to get clear of Dublin; his desire to avoid further
bloodshed was obvious.</p>

<p>Lauzun, Tyrconnel and all the members of the Jacobite court at
Dublin prepared, despite all difficulties (many found themselves
almost penniless) to withdraw with the army to Limerick; the
viceroy sent expresses to all the isolated garrisons to withdraw
behind the Shannon; again changing his mind, he had decided not to
treat with the conqueror.</p>

<p>Lauzun felt bitter towards every one; he had failed and he knew
what his reception at Versailles would be; his one object was to
return to France with the greatest possible credit and not to risk
another French soldier; for all his misfortunes he blamed (and
loudly) King James and the Irish.</p>

<p>It was true that the King, who had been regarded with some
contempt by all men of spirit, even before the battle, was now
looked upon with active disdain and anger even by those who had
pitied him before&mdash;his anxiety for his personal safety, his
abandonment of those who had rallied to his always dubious cause,
disgusted all; and his abuse of the native Irish was returned by
them with a flame of hate; they admired and applauded more William
of Orange, the man they were determined to resist to the utmost,
than the man for whom they had risked and lost everything.</p>

<p>On the morning of the Wednesday after the battle, Patrick
Sarsfield rode into the courtyard of the castle, which was crowded
with carriages, waggons, carts and all manner of conveyances,
priests, servants, bundles, packages encumbered the ground; Lauzun
and his bodyguard were in the midst of the press.</p>

<p>Henry Luttrell, who appeared in a cool, indifferent mood,
indicated to Sarsfield where his wife awaited him in a small
carriage; he had not seen her since before the ride to Lucan; she
had, he found, already asked for him; she was waiting his return,
her child on the nurse's knees beside her; a great scarf was
wrapped round her head. He thought he had never looked at any one
who was so utterly a stranger to him, the loss of Ishma seemed to
put him still further from his wife. She had said nothing except to
ask him in commonplace tones and phrases where they were to go and
when. Was it to Limerick?</p>

<p>"To Limerick at once," he replied. "What has Tyrconnel decided?"
he asked negligently of Luttrell who had followed him in a
thoughtful manner across the courtyard and halted by the little
carriage.</p>

<p>"Tyrconnel will probably go to France. First there is to be a
council in Limerick."</p>

<p>"Where were you last night?" asked Honor, pulling at the
leathers of the carriage window.</p>

<p>Sarsfield stared at her a second before answering; he did not
seem to see her; Luttrell laughed, apparently at nothing.</p>

<p>"I was at Lucan," said Sarsfield, "endeavouring to see what I
could save&mdash;then&mdash;I had many duties."</p>

<p>Lauzun, pompous and florid, his dwarf-like figure massed with
splendours, was riding to and fro gathering together the French
officers, saying continually in a loud and pompous voice:</p>

<p>"The affair of the Boyne was nothing, nothing; it was a mere
scuffle. We had no artillery, and then those wretched Irish
recruits&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tyrconnel, biting his finger fiercely, hurled out at last, his
deep voice cutting through the Frenchman's ejaculations:</p>

<p>"Skirmish! A scuffle! It has driven the king from Ireland!"</p>

<p>Colonel Luttrell turned in his saddle and remarked
carefully:</p>

<p>"You know quite well, my dear Lauzun, that the Boyne was a most
disastrous check to His Most Christian Majesty."</p>

<p>Lauzun rode away without replying.</p>

<p>"I suppose the Protestants will be here by now," smiled
Luttrell. "I have already seen many long, severe faces peering out
of windows and even parading the streets; let us get away, for it
is a hideous sight."</p>

<p>The Protestants were indeed triumphing; with great fervour they
waited for the Prince of Orange; they saw the Jacobite cavalry
departing; sullenly, reluctantly, but departing; they saw the king
had left the castle with even the very furniture and plate
untouched in his rooms, so hurried was his flight; they saw that
every Roman Catholic rose up from the house where he lay and made
for the gates without even pausing to take his goods, they began to
flourish and show a cautious triumph.</p>

<p>Before Lauzun was well on the road the Protestants had broken
into the cathedral and removed all the symbols of the Romish faith
and put back the furniture of the church as it had been before King
James had taken up his residence in the castle.</p>

<p>Sarsfield remained till the last, seeing the women and children,
the infantry and his own troops well on the way, then he, too, left
Dublin.</p>

<p>The only flash of spirit came from Berwick who, undaunted by his
check at Brazeel, asked Tyrconnel if, with the cavalry (amounting
to three thousand five hundred men), he might raid the advancing
Williamites? Tyrconnel refused; he said there was nothing to be
done but to get beyond the Shannon; he was quite confounded by the
flight of his king and friend.</p>

<p>He had no longer any confidence in the Irish army, and remarked
with his usual impudent truculence: "that for all the good the
French had been they might as well have stayed at home."</p>

<p>Lauzun replied furiously: "How can men be expected to fight when
there is no chance of either glory or spoil?"</p>

<p>Quarrelling, they took the road; neither believed that Limerick
could be defended, nor Galway; Lauzun wondered how soon he could
get to France and what kind of tale he could dress up to appease
the keen contempt of Louvois; Tyrconnel wondered what chances there
were of coming to some manner of respectable terms with the Prince
of Orange, but he joined with Lauzun in execrating the usurper who
had been, they declared, the plague of Europe since he was in
petticoats; it was maddening, the Frenchman declared, to reflect
that though this Nassau&mdash;this "little Lord of Breda"&mdash;was so often
down, so often defeated in the field and in the cabinet, yet he was
never daunted, but contrived to confound them all by some odd luck,
cunning or shifty intrigue...And the Frenchman roundly cursed the
man who had fired the bullet which had hit, but not killed, the
Dutchman as he was breakfasting on the grass.</p>

<p>Sarsfield eagerly searched among the press of fugitives for
Ishma, Mrs. Begg, the priest, one of his servants, but found
himself always staring at strangers.</p>

<p>He thought:</p>

<p>"I am behaving like a cornet of eighteen&mdash;I am thirty-five, have
a high rank and grave responsibilities&mdash;was it I last night who
threw her possessions into the lake lest they should be profaned?
What little shoes she had, and her chamber how sweet and clean," he
mused bitterly, and, being a man of an intense inner vision, he saw
himself, like a spectre in the twilight, digging the dog's grave at
the foot of the hawthorns decked with flags, as he had seen himself
in his uniform, scarlet in the moonlight, tossing to and fro in the
waves beating on the rock of Howth.</p>

<p>By noon that day the evacuation of Dublin was complete; not a
Jacobite, not a Catholic remained in the city.</p>

<p>Sarsfield watched the flag with Tyrconnel's device: "Now or
Never, Now and for Ever" being taken down from the castle.</p>

<p>In a few hours the English standard would again be broken there;
and for how long would it hang above Dublin? How many years must
pass, how much blood be shed, how many miseries endured before the
native flag again dominated the capital?</p>

<p>Sarsfield would not look back at the bare staff; he tasted to
the dregs the shame of defeat, the mortification of inaction, the
pangs of unutterable loss.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant day, but he saw all through greyness; the
very sunshine was tainted.</p>

<p>Yet beneath his melancholy was a steady resolution: "Whatever
they say, I'll fight."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-36" id="ch1-36"></a>THIRTY-SIX</h2>

<p class="first">
A CONFERENCE was hastily summoned at Limerick; Major-General
Boisseleau had the command of the garrison; under him was
Major-General the Duke of Berwick and Major-General Patrick
Sarsfield of Lucan. The Commander-in-Chief of the Irish forces was
still the Duke of Tyrconnel who also continued to hold the empty
and nominal post of viceroy.</p>

<p>There was an end of James Stewart, as far as Ireland was
concerned, it seemed, and all the men gathered round the table in a
room in Limerick Castle thought that it might mark a crisis in
their fortunes; Luttrell laughed up his sleeve at the chagrin of
the French. They had not reckoned on this flight of James which
turned the skirmish at the Boyne into a decisive victory for the
Williamites.</p>

<p>James Stewart had ridden post-haste to Waterford, put to sea in
the <i>Comte de Lauzun</i> which made for Kinsale, and there,
finding a French squadron, he had re-embarked on a frigate and was
conveyed to Brest. Dublin was in the hands of the Williamites, the
Protestants were in the full blast of their triumph, a Calvinist
service was rising once more from the proud aisles of the
cathedral; the usurper was encamped at Finglass, after having
ridden through the capital like a conqueror with a crown on his
head&mdash;it was the complete triumph of the Protestant cause.</p>

<p>Sarsfield, leaning back in his place at the table, could see the
many intelligent glances of meaning which passed between Lauzun and
Tyrconnel. They were, no doubt, the staunchest of friends, both of
them were his enemies; as for the Duke of Berwick, he did not feel
that he could range him among his supporters. The young duke was,
as usual, austere and self-contained, he gave himself away to no
man, nor disclosed his thoughts to any, but held himself precisely
and proudly; though he had been in defeat he had been in a battle
and behaved with credit; he seemed continually, by his looks and
gestures, to show his consciousness of his renown.</p>

<p>But Patrick Sarsfield had power, secret power; he saw the tired
sarcastic eyes of Henry Luttrell seated opposite to him, gazing at
him across the table, he remembered that intriguer's talk of his
being "the darling of the army"; and more than ever he was popular
among the Irish; his countrymen knew how he had been treated at the
Boyne and the slight and humiliation that had been put upon them
which he had in a way shared; they had sensed in him the national
hero, the national symbol. There were fifteen thousand men in
Limerick and nearly all of them ready to do his bidding; Sarsfield
listened to the futile comments, complaints and quarrels that
passed round and round the table; only Berwick maintained the
dignity of silence while forced to listen to hard things of his
father which appeared to affect him very little; he wore the Star
of the Garter which the king allowed him to display although his
banner had never been hung at Windsor. At length Sarsfield rose; he
had been called on for his opinion, but negligently, as a matter of
form.</p>

<p>As he rose he was conscious of the atmosphere of general
hostility, but he was unconscious how much of this was provoked by
his superiority, his magnificent appearance, his power over his
countrymen, the sincerity of his motives and his unblemished
integrity. Without any desire on his own part he was like a king
speaking courteously to his subjects.</p>

<p>"I know, gentlemen, all you would say; let us make no more weak
words." He smiled, his soft persuasive voice with the Irish accent
was gentle. "I have heard my lord, the Duke of Tyrconnel, observe
that the great army which we at first raised has been disbanded to
almost half. He has dwelt on the ill-success of the armies at
Newtown-Butler, at Derry, at Inniskillen, their miscarriage at the
Boyne, through which the province of Leinster and the best part of
Munster hath been lost; he hath reminded us that the king has
returned to France, that the French Brigade is going away, that the
brass money has been brought to no value, and that we have no
other; there is no store of provisions, that Connaught"&mdash;and
Patrick Sarsfield's smile deepened; he was again thinking of his
own sacrifices in that province&mdash;"is not able to maintain the army
and the vast multitudes of people brought there together from the
other provinces. Limerick is a very weak town, yet is our chief
defence against the enemy. Mons. de Lauzun hath reminded us that
even if the Prince of Orange should be beaten in a pitched battle,
England, with the assistance of Holland, would send yet another
army and after that another, rather than be at the mercy of King
James or that he should be restored to the Irish throne. We have
been told, too, that His Most Christian Majesty is not in a state
to send us competent aid by reason that he has so many enemies
which keep all his armies at work, and that while the Catholic army
was entire was the proper time to get advantageous conditions from
the Prince of Orange who would readily grant them to secure his
crown. We have heard all this, gentlemen, heard, in fine, that it
was not prudent, in the aforesaid circumstances, to run the risk of
destroying the lives and liberties of the people by a strained
undertaking together with the expectation of their estates and
their hopes of enjoying their religion&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sarsfield paused, he could see that they were all surprised that
he should speak so contrary to his known opinions, putting thus
briefly and better than they could have put themselves the usual
objections to his own plan; in particular, Berwick's long almond
eyes dwelt upon him shrewdly; Luttrell looked down, Sarsfield
sensed that he was all attention.</p>

<p>"But, despite all this," continued Sarsfield, "my opinion and
the opinion of thousands of my countrymen is not altered. I believe
that we could defend Limerick as Derry was defended, that men of
Catholic faith and loyalties can do what men of heretic faith and
loyalties did&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut tut," interrupted Tyrconnel impatiently. "You will split us
into two parties as before, the moderates and the extremists."</p>

<p>"Are there not always," asked Berwick, with something of a
sneer, "two parties in every cause, as you have named them, the
moderates and the extremists?"</p>

<p>"We have twenty thousand men in the town," added Sarsfield,
continuing coolly, his hand on his hip above the tassel of his
baldric, "and our cavalry, my lord"&mdash;he looked towards
Berwick&mdash;"being encamped on the Connaught side it will be easy for
us to level the suburbs and burn the neighbouring country houses.
Consider, too, that the Williamites are not in any vast numbers;
they cannot, I think, be more than our own, allowing for the
garrisons they have thrown into Dublin, Waterford and other towns.
We must remember, too, that the Prince of Orange is stinging under
the news of the defeat of Beachy Head, and must be anxious to end
the campaign and return to England."</p>

<p>"I think," cried Tyrconnel rudely, "that you talk, sir, a great
manner of romantic nonsense. For my part I am of the opinion of
Mons. de Lauzun; it is wise to make the best terms with the usurper
whom, on my faith, I am inclined to call usurper no longer but King
of England. It is said that he is merciful and it is known he is
prudent. He will no doubt give us fair and generous
conditions."</p>

<p>"I believe His Highness to be a just and resonable man," replied
Sarsfield with impetuous vivacity, "but that is nothing to do with
the matter." His look, his bearing defied them all. "Aye, and the
Irish intend to fight."</p>

<p>"Even if you stand alone, sir?" asked Mons. de Lauzun, rising to
the full height of his dwarfish figure, with an odd air of pompous
dignity.</p>

<p>"It seems," replied Sarsfield, "that we shall stand alone, since
it is your intention to take your brigade back to France."</p>

<p>Lauzun began to bluster and swagger, "that King Louis's interest
was still very important in Ireland, that he had spent much money
on the country, that many of his soldiers would remain there, that
the very Governor of Limerick was a Frenchman&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sarsfield cut him short:</p>

<p>"I have other things to think of," he said decisively, as if he
were in sole command, "matters that may not interest you, sir, in
view of your return to France, but which are vastly important to
me."</p>

<p>He turned to Berwick and spoke to him as to a man who might
dislike him, but whom he felt he could trust and who would trust
him.</p>

<p>"My lord," he urged, "you must understand how Limerick lies on
the Shannon, how it is very finely defended by nature if poorly by
man. We have in the middle of the river King's Island, where we are
now, a castle, a cathedral and the old city. Remember that the
stone walls which enclose us have long since defied the attacks of
Ireton...We have outworks between the river and St. John's Gate;
beyond the wall we have a great ditch with a bank of earth and
stones, near a month hath been spent in strengthening the defences.
At Englishtown we have a bastion, and Ireton fort hath been
repaired. We have a new fort at the north end of King's
Island&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You appear to ignore me, sir," said Tyrconnel, hardly able to
contain his rage and dislike; "you seem to have made your plans as
if you were in command of Limerick. I take it that I am still
Viceroy of Ireland and Mons. de Boisseleau the governor of the
garrison?"</p>

<p>"Sir," replied Sarsfield, the summer sun streaming through the
window in front of him was full on his pale beautiful face, on his
heavy hair, his perfectly-formed mouth, and on the precision of his
worn but carefully-kept uniform; "I am not to consider who is put
in authority over me by a king who has deserted me, and by
foreigners who seek to serve their own ends, but rather what I may,
at this push, do for my own country."</p>

<p>The Duke of Lauzun, smarting with injured vanity, spoke with
great rancour and virulence.</p>

<p>"It will be impossible," he sneered, "to defend Limerick, the
walls could be beaten down by rotten apples." And he added
vehemently that "the town is weak, it has no outward works, but a
toy of a palisade before some part of it, not a rampart within, the
wall itself is of old standing and far from being thick&mdash;"</p>

<p>Berwick quietly gave his opinion:</p>

<p>"The place hath no fortifications. What are walls without
ramparts having only some miserable little towers without ditches?
Major-General Boisseleau has done what he could, but&mdash;" Berwick
broke off with a smile at that officer, who added:</p>

<p>"All the works are old and irregular, the stone walls are not
cemented. I have made a kind of covered way and a horn work
palisaded before the great gate; it is true that I have twenty
thousand men, but only half of them are armed; the MacMahon
regiment has not a single weapon of any kind."</p>

<p>"The strength of a town lies in its defenders," replied
Sarsfield. "We are as well fortified and as well provided as was
Derry or Inniskillen, if we fail in the same manner of pinch where
they succeeded it can only be that our resolution and courage are
less."</p>

<p>"Words! words!" stormed Tyrconnel, angrily clutching at his
wig.</p>

<p>"I am prepared to offer more than words," smiled Sarsfield.</p>

<p>Berwick, glancing up from an agate seal handsomely set with
diamonds with which he had been playing, pulling to and fro the
laces on his wrist idly, remarked dryly:</p>

<p>"General Sarsfield has great popularity, the Irish shout for him
wherever he shows his face."</p>

<p>"Of what use," asked Lauzun, "are the shouts of the Irish?"</p>

<p>The Frenchman's words touched Sarsfield very little.</p>

<p>"Now is the moment," he urged, "when we can prove of what mettle
we are made. Let us show the Prince of Orange that he has at least
one opponent who does not fly from him like a hare scuttling to her
form."</p>

<p>"There were those at the Boyne," said Berwick with icy tones,
"who did not fly."</p>

<p>"I know, my lord, but your courage and that of your cavalry were
useless where there was so much incompetence, and never," cried
Sarsfield, "never will I forgive that I and my cavalry were allowed
to remain inactive!" He glanced at Lauzun and added dryly: "Were we
private gentlemen, sir, and this not a time of war, we could cross
swords over that matter."</p>

<p>The Frenchman turned away with a certain uneasiness; he was
conscious of having gratified a futile and a private spite in
leaving Sarsfield out of the battle of the Boyne. It had been to
please his own vanity, to please Tyrconnel, in a way to please
Berwick and Luttrell, but it had been foolish and, perhaps, helped
to cause the loss of the day.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield left the council without waiting for the
permission of any; he felt as if he was the master of them all. At
last he had come into his kingdom. Everywhere he showed himself the
Irish gathered round him; he had become the darling, the idol of
the soldiery; even the French considered him with a new respect.
His old ardours and enthusiasms mounted high in his bosom; what did
it matter if all these men flung away hope&mdash;fled in the track of
the king? He would rally Ireland and Ireland would rally to
him.</p>

<p>And any day, hour or moment he would hear news of Ishma; he was
sure of that; he had to be sure of that or lose his faith; her
little crucifix hung beneath his shirt.</p>

<p>The lovely bells of Limerick's ancient cathedral were pealing as
he passed through the narrow streets made dark by the lofty houses
built in the step-gabled Flemish fashion.</p>

<p>Here and there an alley allowed a swift glimpse of the sparkling
waters of the Shannon, and the soft green summer fields; the whole
city, Sarsfield thought, was fairly well fortified by nature, and,
embraced by a narrow arm of the Shannon, that portion named
Englishtown was like a fortress itself...Sarsfield, warmly saluted
by every passerby, crossed the ancient Thomond's Bridge and came
out at the simple house overlooking the water where his wife was
lodged; women were knee-deep in the water's edge washing clothes;
the smoky mist of the old town made a haze in the veiled gold of
the summer day. The bells still rung soft, gay, blithe, like Ishma
herself, from St. Mary's steeple.</p>

<p>When Sarsfield entered his house he felt that spiritual
exaltation which has so little to do with material considerations;
for no reason at all he felt glad, triumphant; as if he had done
with all hindrances, all handicaps&mdash;and was free.</p>

<p>But he had other oppositions to endure than those shown him in
the council chamber.</p>

<p>His wife greeted him with enmity, she was enraged at the
prospect of a siege; she still urged him to fly to Waterford, to
endeavour to make for Kinsale before the French squadron
departed.</p>

<p>She complained continuously of the dreariness of the town, of
the misery of her apartments, of all her discomforts and
discontents.</p>

<p>She asked, with what seemed a peculiar bitterness, why he had
brought nothing away from Lucan? His demesne was now, of course, in
the hands of the enemy&mdash;Lucan, the mansion, the lake, the old
cross, the may trees, the cottage, all that he had known and loved
as his own were sequestrated, soon, no doubt, to be granted to some
follower of the conqueror&mdash;there must be a great change in affairs
before they could ever hope to see Lucan again, for she was sure
that he would find himself put on the next bill of outlawry; he was
penniless save for what he might earn as a mercenary soldier...</p>

<p>"You have brought nothing away?" urged the Lady Honor. "What was
that hurried visit to Lucan so late at night for if it were not to
fetch something? Why, you might have taken servants and a wagon
with you and at least have brought some silver, some ornaments,
even some chests of linen&mdash;and what of the title deeds? We have a
son."</p>

<p>"They would have been of no use, Honor; title deeds or no, all
is lost while I continue Catholic and loyal to King James."</p>

<p>But he admitted that perhaps Honor's anger was justified; it was
true that during that hurried visit to Lucan he had not thought of
her at all; and again he saw that spectre of himself digging a
dog's grave, casting a maid's humble possessions into a lake...</p>

<p>But Honor, who had hardly spoken to him since they had come to
Limerick, continued to lament his carelessness&mdash;the papers, the
valuables&mdash;Sarsfield hardly listened&mdash;how unimportant such things
were! Did she know him so little as to imagine that when the
invader was fast approaching Dublin he had left everything to fly
to Lucan to fetch household treasures? But Honor was sincerely
vexed at what she thought his negligence. She reminded him that she
was unprovided with everything, he had had time to rescue much that
would have been for her ease and comfort.</p>

<p>"But I do not believe," she cried at last, "that you did go
there out of any prudence or foresight, but merely to discover if
that girl was safe!"</p>

<p>Sarsfield did not answer.</p>

<p>"Was she there?" insisted Honor, "was she? What's to become of
her? Have you hidden her somewhere?"</p>

<p>Then Sarsfield did look at his wife. In her cold but candid eyes
he read with deep relief that she knew nothing about Ishma; there
had been times when he had had to face the ugly thought that
perhaps she had had the girl conveyed away out of spite and
jealousy, but he believed that Honor was, as always, upright; no
such baseness was on her conscience; he answered frankly:</p>

<p>"Yes, I went there to find if the young gentlewoman was still
there as I expected she should be. She was under the protection of
a priest." He could hardly bring himself to tell the story, the
words came cold, almost evenly. "She was gone. I did not find any
trace of her. I have searched for her since&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you have searched for her," interrupted Honor. "Was she as
important as that?"</p>

<p>"To me she was important, she was one who had trusted me."</p>

<p>"Ay, it's all very romantical, but I was left behind in the
city, while you must go galloping after a stranger. And, after all,
she had no courage, she has very likely fled with some soldier,
some gallant who has been visiting her while you were away."</p>

<p>"No," said Sarsfield quietly. "She had no lover."</p>

<p>"Are you so sure?"</p>

<p>"Very sure."</p>

<p>Honor opened her pale lips as if to speak but said no more.</p>

<p>That evening Lauzun and Tryconnel withdrew to Galway; in a few
days the Prince of Orange, who had been reassured that neither the
defeat at Fleurus nor that at Beachy Head was of any importance,
marched from Cahirconlish and, unfurling his standard before Ireton
Fort, summoned Boisseleau to surrender.</p>

<p>The Frenchman replied in terms of courteous defiance and the
Williamites began to open their trenches.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-37" id="ch1-37"></a>THIRTY-SEVEN</h2>

<p class="first">
FROM THE SUMMIT of the old castle of Limerick Sarsfield could
see with his glass the standard of the heretic Prince of Orange
rising from the camp of the besiegers at Singland on the sacred
place where St. Patrick saw the vision of an angel; this gave him a
strong exultation and raised his already high spirits; he thought
much of the personality of the usurper; when, as a boy, he had
served under Luxembourg against the young stadtholder, he had
admired that adamant opponent of the French, and now he thought
wistfully (envy was not in his nature) "that man of about my own
age has had the life I would have wished. What he has done! And
I&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>But here in Limerick might be a chance for action, for decision,
for using his long-pent-up energy; he was second-in-command,
Boisseleau, his superior, was civil, honest and willing to be
advised; Tyrconnel had taken his angry despondency, his violent
vacillation, to Galway; with him had gone Lauzun, wholly concerned
in his own prestige and the care of the French troops; Galmoy was
posted with his cavalry along the Shannon and did not often come
into the city; Sarsfield was, therefore, rid of the forced company
of those whom he most disliked; Luttrell, a declared enemy and
Berwick, a cold acquaintance, remained in Limerick, but Sarsfield
could not dislike Luttrell nor mistrust Berwick.</p>

<p>There still seemed, to all the Irish, good hopes of successfully
maintaining this last stand of a Church and a Kingdom; though the
town was assaulted on the Munster side, supplies could be freely
obtained from Clare; and through Clare also was free egress and
entry for the garrison.</p>

<p>Openly declaring his passionate national feelings, revealing
himself for the first time as the man he was, Sarsfield, at length
freed of all authority, dominated the Irish and infused into them
something of his own spirit; he occupied himself with a thousand
cares, precautions and labours; he brought his own troops to a
pitch that evoked the praise even of Boisseleau who, courteous as
he was, shared his countrymen's prejudice against the Irish.</p>

<p>So occupied was the soldier with this definite important task
entrusted to him, that he had no time for other matters, for other
thoughts than those connected with the defence of Limerick. King
William lacked guns; his small cannon made no impression even on
the walls Lauzun had declared could be "beaten down with rotten
apples"; this ineffectual firing was a pleasant sound in the ears
of Sarsfield, but he knew that the besiegers were expecting a heavy
siege train from Dublin, and that when this arrived the position in
Limerick would be desperate indeed; but he was not daunted, his
mood had still that unreasoning exhilaration of the man who,
despite all material appearances, trusts in a favourable
destiny.</p>

<p>So absorbed was he in his duties that Honor scarcely existed for
him; he could give her no more than a distracted kindness.</p>

<p>But sometimes, hurrying through the dark streets of Limerick, he
would see the Shannon rippling round the long sedges on the banks,
or he would glance up one night when on a tour of inspection and
see the moon or the stars veiled by summer clouds, or on a wet day
he would be striding over the pavements and notice the sky
reflected in a pool at his feet, so that he seemed to be treading
in heaven, or he would scent the perfume of wildings, pulled by
some casual hand from the moist earth; and at these times Ishma
would be there.</p>

<p>It did not concern him that Madame de Bonnac was among the few
Frenchwomen in Limerick; her husband was on Boisseleau's staff and
she had refused to go with the other women to Kinsale.</p>

<p>Yet one twilight when he came upon her full and unexpectedly, he
was somehow shocked. She was leaving her chair at the door of her
house by the old Baal Bridge and Luttrell was in attendance by her
gate; he was saying:</p>

<p>"I abhor the odour of lilies and hawthorn&mdash;'tis the sickly sweet
of almond pie."</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac, glancing at the small garden, replied:</p>

<p>"The hawthorns are dead and the lilies rot&mdash;I will have both
removed&mdash;one is very ill-lodged in Limerick."</p>

<p>Sarsfield paused; he could not pass them without open
discourtesy and he, who never bore rancour to any, had almost
forgotten that these two had declared themselves his enemies; there
was something childish, to Sarsfield, about that sordid episode.
Why then did the appearance of Olivia de Bonnac shock him? He was
bewildered by his own sensations.</p>

<p>She was gorgeous, with the radiance of a woman who makes her
beauty her first consideration; even in Limerick she had with her a
most accomplished Parisian tirewoman; the brilliancy of her
colouring, the lustre of her eyes and hair concealed all the
defects of her features; the careless richness of her silk robe,
her satin mantle, her curled plumes put to shame the humble house
before which she stood; but what stirred Sarsfield was that she had
paused beneath a blighted may tree; the rusty leaves, the dry
boughs looked harsh in the twilight.</p>

<p>Luttrell, lounging at the mean gate while Sarsfield spoke his
civil commonplaces, remarked:</p>

<p>"It is withered at the roots."</p>

<p>He and Madame de Bonnac looked at Sarsfield who had come to a
stand in his walk; never before had he met Luttrell's direct
glance, for those squinting eyes habitually gazed pleasantly aside,
but now, wide open, they gazed at him and it was very noticeable
how the clear, light orbs turned inwards; the effect on Sarsfield
was as if a stranger stared at him; in Madame de Bonnac's prominent
eyes seemed, too, to dwell a creature whom he did not know; the
twilight darkened and he passed on.</p>

<p>And for the first time since he had been married he observed
something agreeable in the atmosphere of the transient home which
Honor created about her; though in contrast to Olivia de Bonnac she
showed a plain little creature, for she took no more trouble with
herself than sufficed to preserve neatness. She was playing on a
small Irish harp as her husband entered, and singing to herself in
a low pleasing voice; in the soft light of the lamp the tiny boy
showed snug in his cradle; Honor, of late, had the child more often
with her; the evening salvo from the ineffective Williamite guns
sounded in the distance.</p>

<p>"There is a strange fellow to see you," said Honor, putting
aside the harp. "He would wait, I dared not send him away, not
knowing in these times what may be of importance."</p>

<p>Sarsfield commended her care, but he had so little time to give
any one&mdash;still, he would see the man...</p>

<p>"In your small cabinet at the back," said Honor. She rose, lit a
taper and gave it to him; the sudden flame showed her reddened
eyes.</p>

<p>"I fear you are lonely and troubled, my dear," he said
gently.</p>

<p>"Oh, no more than the others! I fear I have complained too much.
I have lacked patience."</p>

<p>Her husband knew, even through his own absorption, that she
prayed a good deal; he believed that her character was changing;
surely she was less petulant, less hard; her innate dignity and
fastidious honour seemed emphasised; in an access of pity he
stooped to kiss her brow.</p>

<p>The man waiting alone in the little closet rose at Sarsfield's
entrance; the taper light showed him to be Toby O'Hogan, the
rapparee leader; Sarsfield had forgotten him; he set the taper on
the bureau.</p>

<p>"What is your business, Mr. O'Hogan?"</p>

<p>The rapparee was roughly dressed in a countryman's suit of
frieze; he wore knives and pistols, no sword, his long black hair
was buckled back from a face darkened by exposure to all chances of
weather; he had no marks left of the gentility he had always
claimed except his speech and his hands, which held a broad-leafed
hat.</p>

<p>"My business is to serve you," he replied at once. "May be,
General Sarsfield, I can now repay a little of what I owe."</p>

<p>"Where have you been these many weeks, Mr. O'Hogan?"</p>

<p>The rapparee replied simply that he had been "keeping out of
Galmoy's path&mdash;that noble lord would make no scruple of getting a
man put out of the way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Galmoy has had many ploys and affrays since then, Mr. O'Hogan.
He will have forgotten his little difference with you."</p>

<p>"He will not, nor how you helped me, General Sarsfield. Why
should he?" The Irishman did not seem to expect any one to forgo a
revenge. "If he knows the last," added O'Hogan, "I hope not."</p>

<p>"What doth it matter? You have not come here to talk to me of my
Lord Galmoy?"</p>

<p>"I have not. I know things, General Sarsfield. I have many
obedient men, and spies; there is no one as clever as I in finding
the ways across the bogs, the fords across the Shannon, the defiles
in the hills. I have the map of the southwest in my mind. I know
all the people too, and where one may hide and escape."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. O'Hogan?" Sarsfield spoke without impatience.</p>

<p>"King Willie is expecting field guns from Dublin," remarked the
rapparee.</p>

<p>"You name him king, do you?"</p>

<p>"King enough. It is an able man and a brave&mdash;but King Shamus!"
O'Hogan made a gesture of unutterable contempt. "<i>You</i> are the
leader for us, General Sarsfield."</p>

<p>"About the Prince of Orange's artillery&mdash;you've heard
something?"</p>

<p>"This is Sunday night; to-morrow night the train will be as far
as Ballyneety."</p>

<p>"You are sure?"</p>

<p>"Sure. I have my certain means of information."</p>

<p>"What does this train consist of?"</p>

<p>O'Hogan answered promptly:</p>

<p>"One hundred and fifty-five ammunition wagons, five mortars, two
eighteen-pounders, six twenty-pounders, twelve wagons of
provisions, and a set of eighteen pontoon boats under the convoy of
two troops of the second dragoon guards."</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other across the flicker of the
taper.</p>

<p>"Limerick will fall as soon as that siege train arrives," said
the rapparee.</p>

<p>"This information should go to Major-General Boisseleau."</p>

<p>"But I bring it to you, Patrick Sarsfield of Lucan."</p>

<p>"You think I could intercept them?"</p>

<p>"You could. You could cross at Killaloe, ambush at Keeper's
Hill, fall on them at night, blow the ammunition store up and
retire by Banagher at the head of Lough Derg. I could guide you,
General."</p>

<p>The rapparee outlined this daring exploit as if it were the
simplest thing in the world to put it into execution. And as simply
Sarsfield replied:</p>

<p>"I will make the attempt. Meet me in three hours at the
gates."</p>

<p>"I shall be there."</p>

<p>O'Hogan was leaving when Sarsfield stayed him.</p>

<p>"I should value a further service, Mr. O'Hogan, with your great
knowledge of the country&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I would do anything."</p>

<p>"Before we left Dublin I visited my demesne. My servants, my
chaplain were gone. I have never seen any of them since."</p>

<p>"'Twould be difficult, the country being as it is."</p>

<p>"There was a dwarf woman, a Mrs. Begg, and in her charge a young
gentlewoman under my protection. I have searched for them&mdash;"</p>

<p>Quick and subtle the rapparee understood.</p>

<p>"If they are to be found, I'll find them, General
Sarsfield."</p>

<p>"They might be in a religious house or gone away over the
mountains, not caring to reveal themselves."</p>

<p>"She was that manner of gentlewoman?"</p>

<p>Sarsfield raised his eyes.</p>

<p>"She was."</p>

<p>"And what sort of woman to look at, General arsfield?"</p>

<p>"Kind and tall, dark and gentle, blithe, gay, much rapt above
the earth."</p>

<p>"As she might have been a sidhe or a saint," said the rapperee
gravely.</p>

<p>"She was like that, she wore the clothes of a peasant, but Irish
gold, three colours, plaited, like you find in the old raths. Her
name is Ishma O'Donaghoe."</p>

<p>"If a mortal can find her," said the rapparee, "I shall be
he."</p>

<p>Sarsfield, disdaining the rapparee's wish for secrecy, went
directly to Boisseleau, told him what he had heard and volunteered
to intercept the Williamite convoy; the French commander gave
instant permission; he quickly perceived that this audacious
enterprise was the only chance of saving Limerick.</p>

<p>That evening, under the light of a full harvest moon, Patrick
Sarsfield and eight hundred cavalry, guided by Galloping O'Hogan,
who was mounted on John Luby, rode under the Jacobite fort at
Thomond's Bridge, by Harold's Cross, and then proceeded through
Bridgetown and Ballycorney; when they reached Killaloe they avoided
the bridge, which was held by the enemy and, skilfully guided by
O'Hogan, who knew every inch of the way, crossed the Shannon at the
ford of Ballyvalley.</p>

<p>They encamped for the remaining hours of the August night on the
side of Keeper Mountain; a man named O'Ryan offered Sarsfield
shelter in his cottage, but the soldier preferred to sleep, wrapped
in his cloak, on the sweet grass.</p>

<p>Before he rested he took Ishma's cross from his bosom and looked
at it in the mingled light of the setting moon and rising sun. It
was one of the happiest moments of his life.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-38" id="ch1-38"></a>
</h2>

<p class="first">
DURING the next day Sarsfield and his troop lurked by the
mountain; the weather was fair but cloudy, the solitude undisturbed
save by a party of rapparees galloping past under the spur of the
hill to hide their plunder in some secret defile. Late in the
afternoon Sarsfield's scouts rode into his hidden camp to inform
him that the Williamite convoy was nearing the old castle of
Ballyneety where they intended to encamp.</p>

<p>Almost immediately afterwards he was himself able to observe the
siege train with the escort of dragoon guards slowly winding along
the path beneath the mountain.</p>

<p>Toby O'Hogan, who had his disguised rapparees everywhere,
informed Sarsfield that some news of the raid had leaked through
(from a Protestant Irish gentleman, Magnus O'Brien) to the English
camp.</p>

<p>"He saw us crossing at Killaloe."</p>

<p>Sarsfield gripped his perspective glass nervously.</p>

<p>"Then they'll be warned?"</p>

<p>"No," smiled the rapparee. "Mr. O'Brien went to the Dutchman, he
they call Portland, and he made nothing of it&mdash;he said it was
cattle-raiding."</p>

<p>"That's what they think of us, Mr. O'Hogan."</p>

<p>"They do," replied the rapparee blandly. "Cattle-thieves, rogues
and villains they name us." His gray eyes gazed blandly at
Sarsfield. "How could you expect a Dutchman to understand an
Irishman?"</p>

<p>"If it gets to the ears of the Prince of Orange, he'll listen,"
remarked Sarsfield thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"It will not&mdash;in time."</p>

<p>"And if the train encamp inside the castle there will be no
getting at them."</p>

<p>"They will not, they are too confident. I've got their password.
You'll smile to hear it&mdash;'tis 'Sarsfield.'"</p>

<p>The two Irishmen looked at each other and laughed; there were
moments when a kinship of blood made Sarsfield feel more intimate,
more at one with the rapparee chief than with any of his own equals
and friends; they understood each other without need of exchanging
confidences, and Sarsfield relied absolutely on the loyalty of the
man whose life he had saved.</p>

<p>The rising moon was obscured by thick scudding clouds when the
Irish cavalry, skilfully guided by O'Hogan, came cautiously down
the slopes of Keeper Mountain.</p>

<p>The rapparee scouts, slipping unseen through the fields, brought
the most welcome of information; the convoy had halted without
taking any precautions; they were but seven miles from Limerick and
felt secure; the wagons had been left outside the protection of the
stout ruins of Ballyneety; the horses had been turned out to grass;
wagoners and soldiers were alike asleep; there were neither
sentries nor vedettes, only a corporal's guard.</p>

<p>Sarsfield waited motionless at the head of his troop until a
languidly-advancing cloud dimmed, darkened, then totally hid the
moon. Sarsfield gave the order for the night attack. An outpost
heard the approach and challenged them; Sarsfield gave his own name
and the man stood aside; again, and then close to the camp, a guard
demanded "Who goes there?"</p>

<p>"Sarsfield," was the answer. "Sarsfield is the word and
Sarsfield is the man!"</p>

<p>Without further pause the Irish hurled themselves on the
Williamites; there were cries, shouts, a bugle sounded "To horse!"
Figures sprang towards the picketed animals; but the surprise was
complete; most of the English were sabred in their sleep or shot as
they ran for their horses; a few escaped in the darkness, flying
towards the village of Ballyneety.</p>

<p>The moon cleared the clouds; as Sarsfield saw the great guns he
felt a high exultation; O'Hogan called out to him that a troop was
riding hard, at last, from the Prince of Orange's camp.</p>

<p>"We have very little time, General Sarsfield."</p>

<p>"Time enough, Mr. O'Hogan."</p>

<p>Sarsfield ordered the guns to be crammed to the mouth with
powder and the muzzles sunk in the earth; the broken pontoon
bridges, ammunition wagons, stores and carriages to be heaped round
and powder poured over all.</p>

<p>"'Tis a bonfire they'll see in Singland camp!" cried O'Hogan
with joy.</p>

<p>All the Irish, implicitly obeying Sarsfield as he rode here and
there giving directions, worked with speed and skill, the rapparees
were as cool and adroit as the trained soldiers; though their haste
was extreme they bungled nothing. The train of powder was lit; the
Irish drew back; the whole night seemed to break into noise and
flame as the burst guns, like monsters in a quick death agony,
sprang into the reddened air. The deep roar of the explosion, the
shuddering of the earth, the long jets of flame that licked all
whiteness from the moonlight, shrieks and lamentations that were
unhuman yet surely came from human throats, changed the peaceful
night scene into a vision of hellish unreality, Sarsfield, the tall
man on the heavy horse, hatless, his hair blown back, his eyes wide
open, his features strained with exultation and stained crimson
from the glare, looked monstrous on his dark hillock.</p>

<p>Success, complete and obvious success.</p>

<p>"Quick," said O'Hogan; "by Banagher ford&mdash;the English are at
O'Brien's Bridge."</p>

<p>Sarsfield gave the order to retreat; there were still six guns
that he had not been able to spike, but he could delay no longer;
with celerity and clever handling the Irish brought away with them
four hundred draught horses and a hundred chargers of Colonel
Villier's regiment, which were saddled, bridled, and with pistols
in their holsters.</p>

<p>Galloping O'Hogan rode beside Sarsfield as they galloped along
Lough Derg; the moon showed the rapparee's blood-stained, bare arms
and his face which was set in a grin of intense satisfaction.
Sarsfield understood that the slaying of the sleeping men had given
O'Hogan great pleasure; he asked, as their horses cautiously
stepped into the water, if there had been much slaughter.</p>

<p>"All we could find," replied the rapparee, with simple
barbarity. "Wagoners, country people&mdash;there were some women,
too."</p>

<p>"Women?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you could hear their squealing."</p>

<p>"I gave no orders for that!" cried Sarsfield fiercely.</p>

<p>"I needed none." The rapparee squarely met his gaze. "My men are
used to that work. 'Tis the less to breed heretics. King Willie
will be in a great rage."</p>

<p>The professional soldier, the high-bred gentleman in Sarsfield
was revolted; he thought of Galmoy, his own exploit that had been
so glorious was marred by the same atrocities which stained the
name of that officer.</p>

<p>"It is infamous," he said sternly, as the horses mounted the
opposite bank.</p>

<p>"It is war," replied O'Hogan unmoved.</p>

<p>Glancing back at the red glare in the sky Sarsfield thought of
Honor; thought of Ishma; a sudden horror caused him to turn a
speechless stare on O'Hogan; the rapparee who was quick of
perception as he was lawless and brutal, said instantly:</p>

<p>"No&mdash;they had yellow hair."</p>

<p>But though Boisseleau had Limerick illuminated for Sarsfield's
brilliant piece of audacity, and declared that this "was the finest
piece of service any officer had done His Majesty since the
beginning of the war," the hero of the daring exploit felt his
triumph tainted. But never before had he been so praised and
admired; and the Irish were more heartened than they had been since
Boyne water.</p>

<p>When the information given by Mr. O'Brien to the Earl of
Portland came to the knowledge of the Prince of Orange, Sir John
Lanier was sent with a troop of horse to further protect the
convoy; this officer did not set out until four hours after he had
received his urgent orders; when he did take the road it was too
late. He was amazed by a sudden flash as of lightning breaking the
stillness of the early morning, a shuddering of the earth and the
hideous tumult of a terrible explosion. When he arrived, breathless
and expectant of the worst, near Ballyneety, he found shattered
corpses, glowing embers, spiked cannon, charred provisions, nothing
but useless wreckage. He dashed after Sarsfield, but missed
him...This achievement was of the utmost importance, the moral
effect was out of all proportion to the material amount of success
gained.</p>

<p>Blackened by smoke, portions of his uniform charred, his face
lined with fatigue, Sarsfield in that early morning pointed out
triumphantly to Boisseleau that unless William was able, by some
miracle, to completely surround the city&mdash;and how could he do that
seeing the Clare side was uninvested?&mdash;he had no chance of
capturing Limerick.</p>

<p>The Duke of Berwick alone refused to join in the laudation given
to Sarsfield; he said: "that the night attack had the air of a
cattle raid, that it was shameful to consort with rapparees and
such trash, that Sarsfield was no general and was like to have his
head turned by Henry Luttrell who went about crying him up in all
companies."</p>

<p>And with his pedantic air Berwick commented on the news from
Galway where the Duke of Tyrconnel had summoned a meeting of the
general officers of the Irish army, and read to them a letter from
His Majesty, which gave permission "to such of the officers as
pleased to take advantage of the French fleet, then riding in
Galway Bay, to join him in France," and allowing all men of
inferior rank to make "the best terms in their power with the
Prince of Orange."</p>

<p>"What men we serve!" cried Sarsfield, and contempt for both the
king and the viceroy sickened him, destroying his pleasure in his
own success.</p>

<p>He had always suspected this side to Tyrconnel's character. He
could do little, however, to counteract the effect of the viceroy's
declaration, save by that stating that "when the king wrote such a
letter he could not have been aware how strong a position Limerick
was in, that there was a large army of Irish still in the field,
willing and able to fight to the last drop of their blood, that
Connaught at least could hold out for a long while."</p>

<p>Sarsfield looked up at King James's standard flying above the
tower of St. Mary's Church, and then at the invader's farthest set
colours flying on the stone pillar above the camp at Singland; his
sense of a personal struggle was increased; he felt himself pitted,
man to man, against William of Orange.</p>

<p>Another siege train came up from Waterford; the Williamites,
vigorously disciplined, kept down the rapparees who had been so
troublesome.</p>

<p>On the 17th August the energetic Dutchman had forty guns
directing hot fire against Limerick. The Irish were almost
immediately driven from their advanced redoubts. Sarsfield
recognised that the Prince of Orange left nothing unattempted that
"the art of war, the skill of a great captain, the valour of
veteran soldiers" could put into execution to gain the place. He
saw to it that the garrison omitted nothing that courage and
constancy could practise to defend it. He had contrived to rouse
all the Irish in Limerick to a high pitch of exalted enthusiasm,
which was increased by a curious detail, very important to a
superstitious people. An old prophecy had said that an "O'Donnell
with the red mark" should free his country from the dominion of the
English, and at one of the most critical moments of the siege a
certain Roe O'Donnell, with a red mark on his forehead, arrived
from Spain. Sarsfield, remembering some episodes in his own life,
felt he could not scorn any superstition, and used this Irishman's
presence to ferment the excitement and the enthusiasm in
Limerick.</p>

<p>Sarsfield recognised that the usurper was employing as much
enthusiasm and energy as he was himself; led by their Prince in
person the Grenadiers, in their piebald red and yellow, with their
cope-crowned, furred caps, with bells on their belts to frighten
the horses, took redoubt after redoubt.</p>

<p>The new battering train executed hideous damage in the ancient
city; red-hot shot sizzled into the waters of the Shannon, split
the pavement and set the houses alight, the thirty-six pounders and
mortars kept up a continual fire.</p>

<p>Sarsfield and Boisseleau rode about the devastated streets
encouraging the citizens; Honor moved her child to the cellar of
her house; her prayers took on an almost fanatic fervour; her
husband sometimes wondered if she prayed for him&mdash;for Berwick, or
for Ireland; she made no complaint even when the bombardment became
so furious that many inhabitants of Limerick left their
half-destroyed houses to live in huts on the Clare side of the
Shannon, and on King's Island.</p>

<p>The rains began early that year, and the low-lying banks of the
river soon became swamps from which rose thick miasmas of disease.
Of all the women in Limerick only Madame de Bonnac retained her
bloom, her radiance, her gaiety; while the shot was falling below
her windows she was carefully tending her beauty which remained
unstained by fear, anxiety or compassion. She was constantly with
Henry Luttrell; Sarsfield cared nothing for the rumour that she was
his mistress.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-39" id="ch1-39"></a>THIRTY-NINE</h2>

<p class="first">
SPIES AND DESERTERS constantly crept into Limerick on the Clare
side. These encouraged Sarsfield in some of his wildest and most
secret hopes. Always daring and full of romantical and fantastical
ideas he was tempted by the thought of ending the war by the death
or capture of the Prince of Orange. It was well known that this
Prince was most reckless in his care of his own person, that in
order to encourage his men he would go through the trenches like
any common soldier, risking his life in the most hazardous
fashion.</p>

<p>A deserting French gunner showed Sarsfield the exact spot where
the royal tent was pitched. Sarsfield turned his batteries in that
direction. The shots fell thick and fast; the tent was removed.</p>

<p>"'Tis as if he had a charmed life," muttered Sarsfield; but it
was well known that the Prince had had many narrow escapes, and
many slight wounds.</p>

<p>The early autumn settled into heavy rains. The Williamites who
were encamped outside Limerick had to keep their blood warm in
their bodies by constant potations of claret, cinnamon and Geneva.
The camp was intersected with drains and bogs; such a quantity of
rain fell that the marshes became puddles; the bloody flux broke
out. Round each tent a ditch had to be cut to draw off the stagnant
water; the officers and such of the privates as could afford it set
fire every night to a pewter dish full of brandy to take off the
hideous raw damp, foul with disease, which penetrated to the
marrow.</p>

<p>On the 20th August William of Orange led a sussessful attempt to
take the strong redoubt near St. John's Gate. The struggle was
fierce and bitter. Under Sarsfield's passionate leadership the
Irish sallied forth to retake the captured fort, but were repelled
by the Sixth Dragoon Guards. Over three hundred Irish were killed;
Sarsfield heard some beg for quarter, and the English reply that
"they should receive the same mercy as the wagoners at
Ballyneety."</p>

<p>Colonel Luttrell, who behaved with great gallantry, got the
credit of this engagement.</p>

<p>The besiegers had now a battery nearer the inner walls, their
trenches were only about twenty yards from the last ditch of the
city; a breach had been made; the firing was incessant, so was the
rain.</p>

<p>Sarsfield's hopes were increased by the news brought in by spies
and scouts that this endless rain was adding greatly to the
miseries of the besiegers; disease had increased considerably in
their camp; their supply of ammunition was beginning to run short.
It became obvious that the city must either be stormed or the siege
raised. Knowing the man with whom he had to deal, Sarsfield was
sure that the first alternative would be taken.</p>

<p>"If the rain continues," said the Irishman grimly to himself,
"it will be impossible for the oxen to draw off the heavy
guns."</p>

<p>On secure information mostly brought in by the rapparees, and in
particular by Galloping O'Hogan, Sarsfield then proceeded to put
into execution his most audacious plan, which he believed would not
only end the siege of Limerick but also the war.</p>

<p>He did not inform Boisseleau of this design as he had informed
him of the night attack on Ballyneety; he knew the plan would seem
too rash to the Frenchman. Sarsfield was in a foolhardy mood and
did not wish to listen to prudence; the sense of his power among
the Irish had brought out his natural audacity; he preferred the
advice of the wild rapparee to that of the sober Frenchman who was
merely coldly performing his duty; and he was able, on his mere
personal influence, to obtain the services of as many Irish as he
wished.</p>

<p>So he conceived his plan with O'Hogan, who slipped secretly in
and out of Limerick for fear of Galmoy; this officer, though his
post was farther up the passes of the Shannon, was often in the
city in the company of Albemarle, Galway or Luttrell, and the
rapparee kept out of his way with the cunning agility of a cat.</p>

<p>Accompanied only by O'Hogan, Sarsfield was on his way to a
rendezvous he had made with his men on the Clare side when, having
to pass Madame de Bonnac's house, she, who seemed watching, opened
the door, and called out:</p>

<p>"General Sarsfield! Sarsfield!"</p>

<p>Her voice came warm and round through the beat of the rain, the
dismal boom of the distant firing.</p>

<p>"I cannot stay," said Sarsfield.</p>

<p>"A moment only&mdash;'tis important."</p>

<p>He paused by the withered hawthorn, then bid O'Hogan precede him
to the meeting place; it mattered to him so little whether he spoke
to Madame de Bonnac or no; he knew that she had no power to detain
him against his wish.</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac had drawn her curtains closely, fire and
lamplight gave a warmth to her charming little room, so
incongruously furnished in primrose brocade, gilt-framed
wall-glasses and fashionable Parisian trifles, which she had
somehow contrived to bring to the very seat of war.</p>

<p>Sarsfield, pausing inside the door, laughed; he was in the
wildest high spirits.</p>

<p>"You seem in a good humour," remarked Madame de Bonnac,
scattering bon-bons in a crystal box. "And you have no reason."</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>She ran over his misfortunes.</p>

<p>"You are defeated, even if you hold Limerick what does it
matter? Your cause is lost&mdash;was lost from the first. And you are
ruined&mdash;your estates, all gone!"</p>

<p>"That is true."</p>

<p>"And you are not so fortunate in your <i>affaires du coeur</i>,
eh? What prospects have you? None."</p>

<p>"What have these material things," smiled Sarsfield pleasantly,
"to do with exhilaration of spirits? Can you not imagine a
happiness that has nothing to do with such matters?"</p>

<p>"No." She was angry in a quiet fashion; he thought that she
really did not understand, when she suddenly added,
half-breathless:</p>

<p>"Is it possible that there is another world and that you come
from it?" Then she swept that aside, and exclaimed: "You are Irish!
Irish! Irish!"</p>

<p>It was like an accusation and one that Sarsfield accepted; he
was indeed Irish, his Norman blood had counted very little in his
heritage; he belonged to the soil that his forebears had conquered;
to the race into which they had married. In his unreasonable
melancholy, in his unreasonable high spirits, in his moods alike of
exaltation and gloom, in his fantastic imaginings, in his queer
sensitive pride, in his temperate fastidiousness, in his capacity
for chaste and romantic passion, he was Irish. In his audacity, his
recklessness, his reserve and his impeding, tormenting, yet
uplifting dreams, in his certainty of the invisible worlds, he was
Irish.</p>

<p>And lately, the long painfully-acquired manners and habits of an
alien race had fallen from him; all that foreign civilisation,
really so distasteful to him, but which he had not been able to
escape nor judge (since he knew no other), had begun to mean very
little to Patrick Sarsfield; he had found his affinity more in Toby
O'Hogan than in any of the French, English or Norman-Irish fine
gentlemen who had once been his friends. Now that he had native
Irish under him, that he lived close to them and had learned their
language and their thoughts, he saw how much he was like them, in
their faults, their misfortunes, their consolations, their
sufferings...</p>

<p>"Yes, I am Irish." He smiled, nothing could put him out of
humour; he was eager to be away. "What did you want with me?"</p>

<p>"<i>Vous êtes fou</i>," whispered Madame de Bonnac. She then saw
him exactly as he was, but he saw no more than the shell of her.
"I, too, am mad," she added; "'tis the incessant cannonading and
the incessant rain. I'd sooner ride through it than hear it beating
on the window-panes."</p>

<p>Sarsfield felt a touch of her ancient magic; he would not have
minded taking her in his arms and kissing her farewell, for maybe
the errand he was going on would be fatal to him. But his loyalty
was with Ishma spiritually, to his wife materially. Olivia de
Bonnac had no place in his affections and very little in his
desires. Yet she was beautiful enough as she stood there, and
beauty had been rare in Sarsfield's life the last few months; she
remained unblemished through all the horrors of the siege like a
strong lily growing out of filth; her hair was burnished, her eyes
shone, her bosom was smooth and pure beneath her lawn chemisette.
There was about her a certain romantic gallantry, a certain
audacious courage which accorded well with his own disposition and
his own mood.</p>

<p>"If everything had been different," he thought, with ironic
scorn of himself, "she might have made me a good wife and I her a
good husband."</p>

<p>"Where are you going to-night?" she demanded. "A piece of folly,
I'll warrant, like Ballyneety&mdash;that was no more, though
successful."</p>

<p>He laughed in her face. Was it likely he would tell her, for he
still suspected her of being little better than a spy of Tyrconnel
and Lauzun; perhaps even worse than that, perhaps a spy of the
Williamites...</p>

<p>"The rain, I say," she cried, with a sudden change of mood, "is
beginning to drive me mad, I fear I cannot bear much more of it. It
never ceases&mdash;day and night one hears it upon the roof, splashing
in the puddles or in the gutter."</p>

<p>"You should have gone to Galway," he told her, with smiling
eyes.</p>

<p>"I wish," she said wildly, "that wherever you were going I could
accompany you, I should have made a fine soldier," added the
strange woman, smiling. "Better the rain outdoors than indoors,"
she declared. "Why do you not surrender the town and have done with
it? Will you have us all dead of starvation or shelled to
pieces?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, madam," replied Sarsfield, "it matters very little to
me what happens to any so long as I save Limerick and Ireland. But,
indeed, I must be gone, if you have no more to say than random
talk."</p>

<p>Olivia persisted in detaining him; she wished to know where he
was going. She seemed to know so much of his movements that he
thought she must have had him watched, she could get nothing out of
him but laughter.</p>

<p>Suddenly she recoiled into silence and stood still considering
him; he was cloaked and held his plumed leaf hat in his hand; the
steel and linen at his throat and breast were hard and colourless
against the firm, healthy pallor of his face; his thick rather
harsh hair had darkened in his middle years from the scorched flax
colour she remembered it, and he had fastened it out of his way
(she could imagine the impatient gesture) with a horn buckle; his
clear eyes were wide open; was that look of his, she wondered,
expectant, startled or haunted?</p>

<p>"God keep you," he said, and turned away.</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac spoke one of the few sentences that could have
detained him.</p>

<p>"Have you found Ishma, the little Irish girl?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Who told you she was lost?" demanded Sarsfield keenly. "Not I,
I do not think we have been in that intimacy, madam, to make me
give you so much information."</p>

<p>"It was your wife who told me."</p>

<p>He was sorry that Honor gossiped over his affairs, if this could
be called gossip; he did not wish any one, least of all these two
women, to talk over Ishma and himself; he frowned, swinging his
heavy war gloves.</p>

<p>"Put the whole thing out of your head, I have it in my mind that
she is safe," he said. "It is impossible that any evil could come
to her. The enemy were not near Lucan, and even if they had been
they could be trusted to make no outrage."</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac smiled sourly.</p>

<p>"How can you trust any one in time of war? If you like to think
the little creature safe, if it comforts you&mdash;" She saw him turn
aside and open the door. "Ah, my God!" she cried, "you are going
into danger and will not even say good-bye to me, you do not know
what my patience has been."</p>

<p>"Waste no patience on me, madam," he replied impetuously. "I
have but one thought in my mind and but one thing to do."</p>

<p>"You are different from any man I have ever met!"</p>

<p>"To your mischance, no doubt, Olivia."</p>

<p>"Oh, 'tis Olivia again, after all!"</p>

<p>"If you please&mdash;what matter is it? You poor creature, this is no
life for you."</p>

<p>"You think kindly of me then, and of Henry Luttrell, too. He
praises you everywhere."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, you both declared yourself my enemies once&mdash;but that
was folly. I have no malice towards any, but must be gone."</p>

<p>"<i>Vous êtes fou</i>," repeated Madame de Bonnac, in her own
language.</p>

<p>She followed him on to the narrow stairhead; he dwarfed the mean
house; she had, she thought, seen him dwarf a palace; she would
almost have given her beauty to have been his lover. But she would
have her farewell of him whatever he might say or do; she caught
him to her, her beautiful head resting on his arm&mdash;how tall he was!
She kissed his hand, she interlaced her fair fingers round his
wrist, between a sob and a smile she bade him farewell. There was a
warmth about that unwelcome embrace which he had missed in the
chill good-bye of Honor...she listened to his departure, to his
laughing good-natured:</p>

<p>"Good-night, Olivia!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-40" id="ch1-40"></a>FORTY</h2>

<p class="first">
LORD GALMOY had discovered, by what means Sarsfield did not
know, though he suspected Luttrell's spying, that some audacious
enterprise was on foot and he was at the Clare Gate rendezvous
where, greeting Sarsfield, he eagerly offered his services,
affirming, with many oaths, "that he was weary of the monotony of
the siege to which the vile weather added an infernal
discomfort."</p>

<p>Sarsfield would not have taken Galmoy with him on any expedition
whatsoever. His dislike of the man, although it had little to feed
on, had grown fiercely. He could not look at him with patience.</p>

<p>He therefore curtly refused to have him with him; he said that
the expedition was secret and important, and entirely undertaken on
his own responsibility.</p>

<p>"But you take some other gentlemen with you," sneered Galmoy,
who was near roaring drunk, "and even, I believe, promise yourself
the company of such a rogue as Galloping O'Hogan."</p>

<p>"A useful rogue," replied Sarsfield, refusing to be offended,
"and one who knows the country well. Believe me, my lord, this is
no pleasure party and I would risk no reputation in it beyond my
own."</p>

<p>"You mean, I suppose," shouted Galmoy, "that you will take with
you none but your friends?"</p>

<p>Sarsfield laughed; the big, bullying, blustering man, with his
sodden features and gross voice, really amused him; in a
dishevelled array and mounted on a raw-boned chestnut, Piers Butler
Lord Galmoy looked no better than one of the cattle stealers he
despised. He began to rail against Sarsfield as "a silly,
crack-brained fanatical fellow who would have his lesson yet"&mdash;he
then poured out blasphemies, and asked if Sarsfield "considered
himself a great general because he had blown up the guns at
Ballyneety, which exploit was in the compass of any fool, and if he
took to himself Luttrell's compliments which were really meant in
mockery?" And then turning his horse, so as to impede Sarsfield's
passage to the gate, he demanded where was his "peculiar lady?"</p>

<p>"You are roaring drunk sir!" cried Sarsfield. "Do not presume to
meddle with me!"</p>

<p>He was angry at being kept in the narrow, wet street under the
heavy rain when his men must be waiting for him, he was angry at
the company of Galmoy being thrust on him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have been sent to spy," he added fiercely; "but you
have taken too much drink to be able to do your business&mdash;let me
pass!"</p>

<p>"May I be fetched to hell in a basket if I do! Wherever you go
'tis without Boisseleau's knowledge&mdash;you will have to answer to
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Break off this wrangle&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sarsfield thrust aside the chestnut and galloped to the gate; he
heard Galmoy shouting after him and smiled, for his good humour was
restored, his spirits soared.</p>

<p>Yet it was a frightful night and there was something in the
incessant downpour falling through the heavily-clouded dark
sufficient to depress the spirits of any man; though Sarsfield knew
the damage it was doing in the enemy's camp, through the ghastly
diseases that were rising from the damp bogs, the spectres evoked
from the marshes and puddles, he could not help wishing that the
rain might cease.</p>

<p>"I am late," he said to O'Hogan, who was waiting patiently on
the soaked ground by a clump of willows streaming with water. "I
had to get rid of tedious company:"</p>

<p>"There is time enough, General Sarsfield."</p>

<p>The little expedition started cautiously, guided by
half-darkened lanterns.</p>

<p>Sarsfield had with him fifty of his best troopers, Galloping
O'Hogan and several other rapparees whose great use was their
perfect knowledge of the country. They were able to discover paths
across what seemed impassable bog and through what appeared
impregnable mountains; they had secret nooks and hiding-places in
the most unlikely holes and corners. They were besides completely
loyal to the Irish cause and as unscrupulous as ferocious.
Sarsfield had no hesitation in availing himself of the services of
these men, though he knew the invader decried them as thieves and
murderers. He even felt in himself some taint of that reckless
ferocity which had disgusted him at Ballyneety; yet he was a man of
a naturally soft and merciful disposition.</p>

<p>"The most peaceful man will fight," he muttered to himself in
justification, "when he gets his back to the wall."</p>

<p>They left Limerick and passed out through the Clare side, and
made their way in a wide semi-circle beyond the lines of the
besiegers' camp at Singland. Slowly they advanced from hedge to
hedge till they came to bog land, and stole across the Shannon at
the ford between Bridgetown and Bailycarney; then across the
orchards and hedges the enemy had felled, then made their way, with
even greater caution, till they were beyond and behind the English
camp. The cannonade had stopped; the rain was incessant and
although it was not yet the end of August the air was chill. The
Irish were muffled to the throat, their hats pulled over their
eyes. Sarsfield felt streams of water pouring off the edge of his
beaver; his feet began to squelch in his boots, he was often
obliged to dismount and lead his horse; the rain seemed to slash
the darkness, as if it would never cease; but for the careful
guiding of the rapparees they would have been several times sunk in
the treacherous bog. But Galloping O'Hogan knew his way. He led
them deftly and with the greatest patience and skill to the spot he
had in his mind; they came almost in sight of Newcastle House, used
by the Williamites as an observation post.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," muttered Sarsfield, touching the rapparee's
shoulder through the wet dark, only faintly dispersed by the beams
of the necessary lantern which the man screened as much as possible
under his mantle, "that he ever comes here?"</p>

<p>"He is of an extraordinary recklessness," replied the rapparee.
"Impatient, too, always riding about seeing to everything."</p>

<p>"I know as much," said Sarsfield, "from the old days. But now?
This is no fool's errand?"</p>

<p>"My information is certain," replied the rapparee; his loyalty
to Sarsfield was such that he could take no offence at anything he
might say; with a careful patience he declared (for the hundredth
time) how carefully he had laid his plans, how impossible it was
for them to miscarry; there were the most resolute and skilful
spies in the Williamite camp; indeed the whole war, the whole
country, camp and council, was riddled with treachery...</p>

<p>"He thinks to put up a battery in the old mansion," added Toby
O'Hogan. "He believes that from this point he can command Limerick
very well."</p>

<p>"If I know the spot, I believe he has not chosen ill."</p>

<p>"He is impatient of all restraint and goes about with no more
than a small escort," smiled Galloping O'Hogan, "as you saw
yourself, General Sarsfield, at Boyne water."</p>

<p>It was to an abandoned and partly-demolished stone mansion,
raised on a little height beyond Singland, similar to the
castleways (embattled houses of Limerick), to which Galloping
O'Hogan finally led Sarsfield and his guards; Sarsfield disposed
his men about the stone walls. He, Toby O'Hogan and Galway, his
brother-in-law, went into one of the chambers and, firmly
shuttering the broken windows, permitted themselves a light. They
took off their soaked mantles and hats and refreshed themselves
with draughts from their brandy flasks; even in the house the night
was of an incredibly chilly rawness.</p>

<p>"He'll never come," complained Galway, wringing out his dripping
gauntlets; he was subject to glooms of depression. The enterprise,
to which his brother-in-law had persuaded him, now seemed to him
ridiculous; he could hear the echo of the laughter of his friends.
He could see the sneer of the French if they should guess what they
had been at and how egregiously they had failed when he must return
to Limerick in the morning. He comforted himself with the thought
of Ballyneety&mdash;that had appeared not only impossible but
ridiculous, yet it had been achieved. His elegant French watch told
him that it was near the dawn; there must be at least an hour of
impatient waiting. The rain had not ceased. It fell in sheets, the
monotonous noise was almost unbearable.</p>

<p>Sarsfield and O'Hogan went to and fro with the dark lanterns
seeing to everything; they were both in the best of humours.</p>

<p>But Galway felt a fool, playing dice with Major d'Archange,
trying to keep himself warm over the small fire they had lit on the
ruined hearth, yawning and wishing he had remained in Limerick
where at least it was possible to snatch a few hours of sleep or
diversion; so he passed what had been a miserable and, he believed,
a purposeless vigil.</p>

<p>At the dawn Sarsfield entered the bare room, opened the shutters
and put out the lanterns. To right and left stretched the
purple-brown expanses of the swampy bog; here and there an oak
tree, standing on higher ground, showed dark, soaked, dripping
leaves in the colourless light of the stormy dawn, the arms of the
Shannon showed ghost-white in the distance.</p>

<p>"Nothing, no one," said Galway in a tone of the most acute
disappointment; his depression increased with the sight of the
bleak and dreary landscape, the distant view of the beleaguered
city rising gray and mournful out of the universal swamp and the
large formidable camp of the invader.</p>

<p>Sarsfield, absorbed in his own thoughts, took no heed of the
other officers; he kept his mind on the information O'Hogan had
given him. "He will wear the uniform of the Dutch Blues, he will
have a guard of no more than ten men of that regiment, he will come
and go quickly before it is quite light, he will have with him
either Ruvigny, Portland, or some such foreigner."</p>

<p>Galway looked at his brother-in-law leaning in the window-place
and said gloomily to himself, kicking at the ashes with his yet wet
boot: "I hope he is not mad."</p>

<p>O'Hogan came in.</p>

<p>"'Twill be 'Now or Never'," he quoted Tyrconnel's motto, then
said he would creep out on the side nearest the English camp and
scout.</p>

<p>"Lord! Lord!" cried Galway, "soon it will be too light for us to
return."</p>

<p>Sarsfield continued to stare at the yellowish sky rapidly
becoming gray; he felt a need of distraction, of immediate action;
the long, seemingly senseless vigil was telling on him too; he
alternated between melancholy and his high spirits of the night
before; there was no doubt that they were all in danger.</p>

<p>"How lonely he is," thought Galway, looking at him; it was a
pity about Honor...and now that her husband was ruined there was
nothing in the match, after all; dull and spiritless the young earl
continued throwing the dice.</p>

<p>"It is true," said Sarsfield, "that I cannot risk the men much
longer."</p>

<p>He strode out into the open, himself took his horse from the
broken stables, and rode out into the twilight; the dawn glow could
hardly penetrate the cloudy obscurity; the air was humid, steaming
vapour made a fog; riding slowly through this on the narrow path
Sarsfield almost jostled into two horsemen coming from the opposite
direction; they were laboriously setting their horses at the
slippery incline.</p>

<p>Enemies. Sarsfield lifted his whistle to his lips; in a second
the Irish had run out from the courtyard and surrounded the two
strangers who, after exchanging a whisper in some foreign tongue,
came quietly.</p>

<p>Major d'Archange said in disappointment:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They are not of any importance or rank&mdash;a couple of
scouts."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied Sarsfield, "they will give us some
information."</p>

<p>He looked at the two figures, gray in the mist; they were
wrapped in horsemen's cloaks and wore plain buckled hats without
plumes. Sarsfield brought them into the courtyard; they dismounted;
he did not disarm them of their swords, their pistols were left in
the holsters.</p>

<p>"Will they tell us anything?" asked d'Archange.</p>

<p>Sarsfield said: "No, they seem to be gentlemen." He believed,
too, that they could talk no English, they were probably Germans or
Danes. The prisoners, who comported themselves with much
philosophy, followed Sarsfield into the bare room where the other
Irish officer waited.</p>

<p>Sarsfield laughed at himself; he felt as if he had perilously
hunted a royal stag and brought down, in the end, a couple of
sparrows.</p>

<p>"Of what use are two prisoners to us?" grumbled Galway. "We have
mouths enough to feed in Limerick as it is. Best let them go."</p>

<p>"It may be," suggested another officer in the ear of Sarsfield,
"these are the forerunners of the man we wait for. Question them
cleverly."</p>

<p>Sarsfield very civilly brought the two officers to what remained
of the fire; he was interested in meeting any of his enemies face
to face; he took them to be Danes and treated them courteously,
offering them such accommodation as there was in the matter of
broken chairs, brandy in dirty glasses and stale biscuits.</p>

<p>One foreigner was a tall, imposing man in a lightish wig with an
air of grandeur in his presence; there was nothing to indicate his
rank. Sarsfield thought him to be no more than a captain or else
that all his martial insignia had been carefully removed. He was
older than his companion, who remained wrapped in his heavy
horseman's mantle and whom Sarsfield took to be some lieutenant or
cornet; this prisoner seated himself silently, coughing in the
choking damp.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," remarked Sarsfield, smiling pleasantly, "I
have only a poor hospitality to offer you. I must confess you are
not the guests I expected."</p>

<p>Galway turned away in disgust; the bleak light was filling the
gaunt room in every cranny. The man in the light peruke took a pair
of square spectacles from his pocket and adjusted them on his nose;
he was an elderly though fine man, the other was of about
Sarsfield's own age.</p>

<p>The elder officer said: "It is surely strange, sir, for you to
be expecting any guest at this time and place. Am I to suppose I
have walked into an ambush?"</p>

<p>"It is not, sir," replied Sarsfield, "an ambush set for
you."</p>

<p>"May I ask," replied the officer, "who then you were expecting?"
He spoke in an easy French, and Sarsfield replied in that
language.</p>

<p>"No doubt, sir, you can guess; it is not for me to enlighten
you. I suppose," he added negligently, "it is useless to ask you
for any information."</p>

<p>At this the younger man spoke and in a strong accent of irony,
in a hoarse, slow voice.</p>

<p>"I think it is needless for you to ask us for any information,
General Sarsfield, seeing you must be so well served by your
spies."</p>

<p>"You know me?"</p>

<p>"It is not difficult. Your features are familiar to me from the
public prints and caricatures. Besides, there can't be many like
you, General Sarsfield, in the rebel army."</p>

<p>The elder officer remarked: "You surely are aware, General
Sarsfield, that your appearance is as conspicuous as your
character?"</p>

<p>Sarsfield did not like the tone of these remarks; he resented
the word "rebel." He said in rather a peremptory manner:</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, I suppose it behoves me to send you into
Limerick as prisoners of war?"</p>

<p>He felt suddenly dejected; his plans had failed. It was merely
stupidly reckless of him to endanger his men by lingering longer in
the daylight in this exposed position, he would get back to
Limerick as fast as he could. As for the two insignificant
prisoners, they were merely a mockery of his original intention;
yet he lingered, interested in his enemies. The elder of them,
addressing him coolly, demanded: "Whom had he hoped to ambush?"</p>

<p>"Why, your Prince," replied Sarsfield, with a frankness that
surprised Galway, but not the rapparees. "I have heard he rides
about recklessly, reconnoitring, and that he intended to come here
with the dawn. He is, I know, impatient and restless, and is often
abroad with no more than twenty-five escort or so, and I believe if
they had been more," he added quietly, "we could have disposed of
them as we disposed of the men at Ballyneety."</p>

<p>The younger officer remarked, his handkerchief to his lips, his
glance on the glowing ashes:</p>

<p>"You are a very useful man, no doubt, General Sarsfield. I am
sorry you are not fighting on the same side as myself."</p>

<p>"I'm fighting for Ireland," said Sarsfield mournfully; "no one
understands that; no doubt you'll have a poor opinion of the Irish.
Who are you, sir, one of the Prince of Orange's mercenaries?"</p>

<p>"Not a mercenary, and I understand very well, General Sarsfield,
that you should wish to fight for your country. I have spent all my
life," he added, "fighting for mine." He smiled as he spoke, and
for the first time Sarsfield was drawn to look at him closely.</p>

<p>The elder officer, staring about from behind his square
spectacles, put in:</p>

<p>"We are captains in De Ruvigny's regiment, French Huguenots.
This is a detestable climate."</p>

<p>"I hope it will drive you away, gentlemen!" cried Sarsfield
gaily. "Take off your wet coats and dry them a little. Galway, my
dear, get up the fire."</p>

<p>They were safe for half an hour or so; the rapparees were
scouting far; O'Hogan would see he was not surprised.</p>

<p>"I perceive," remarked the younger officer, "that you are a man
of volatile spirits, General Sarsfield. You have helped your
country make an extraordinary resistance&mdash;and that is a fine, a
difficult thing to do. To hearten a crowd of defeated, betrayed,
ill-armed people, a defenceless nation! Not easy."</p>

<p>"'Tis strange that you should be enthusiastic about what I've
tried to do," said Sarsfield, interested.</p>

<p>The elder man rather nervously stroked his stiff, long features
and said:</p>

<p>"His Majesty is tolerant to a fault&mdash;and his officers learn it
from him."</p>

<p>"Tolerant! I like a good sharp, clean hate. And who is His
Majesty?"</p>

<p>"King William; 'tis childish to deny him the title."</p>

<p>"I do and must; but, a brave able man. I wish you would change
leaders with us."</p>

<p>The younger officer replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, a good hate is a fine stimulus, no doubt. But 'tis more
noble to hate a principle than a man. 'Tis the cause we sense, the
cause we fight." He added, with sudden vivacity: "You and I, for
instance, General Sarsfield, would not hate each other."</p>

<p>"Put off your wet mantle, sir," said Sarsfield, wishing to see
the Huguenot's uniform.</p>

<p>The officer did so, at the same time he made a swift movement
from his breast to his pocket. Sarsfield could not understand this,
it was certainly not a weapon that had been so quickly concealed.
His instincts of breeding forbade him to demand of a gentleman that
he should show the contents of his pocket. He let the episode pass;
plainly the Huguenot was of no great rank, his uniform was of the
simplest; a chamois undercoat, a blue sash, a red coat, an orange
scarf of knitted silk (the colour worn by the Williamites in
compliment to their king), jack-boots spattered to the thigh with
mud, a plain cravat the ends of which were tucked into his
bosom&mdash;there was nothing of importance in the person of the
Huguenot.</p>

<p>He took off his wet gauntlets and held out his hands to the
blaze Galway had evoked by fresh wood on the embers; he wore no
rings (Sarsfield judged him poor); his hands were of an
extraordinary elegant fineness; he wore his own hair, of a dark
chestnut, and this, damp and abundant, hung forward over his
face.</p>

<p>Sarsfield liked him; and at once, with his impulsive, reckless
generosity, decided to release him. Useless to him was this
prisoner who was obviously a man of no consequence; and supplies
were running short in Limerick.</p>

<p>"You have been strangely misled, General Sarsfield; though the
King of England exposes himself with a great deal of carelessness,
he is not such a fool as to gallop about your swamps
unattended."</p>

<p>"What were you doing here?" asked Sarsfield.</p>

<p>The officer replied that they had been sent out as scouts from
Ruvigny's battalion which intended to reconnoitre the mansion to
see if it were a fit spot for a battery&mdash;"For His Majesty means, at
all costs, to take Limerick."</p>

<p>"And I mean to prevent him," smiled Sarsfield, his spirits
rising.</p>

<p>The younger officer spoke.</p>

<p>"You are a brave, honest man, General Sarsfield, but if you save
Limerick you will not save Ireland."</p>

<p>Sarsfield was nettled by this haughty compliment coming from an
inferior and a prisoner.</p>

<p>"What do you know of it, sir?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Do you not perceive," returned the other, raising his large
weary eyes which were full of ardour and pride, "that even if
I&mdash;even if&mdash;I mean, we, the English, withdraw now we shall return?
Another army will be sent. Limerick will fall, if not this year,
next. And Ireland will be lost to King James forever. It is clear
that he is not a man who can keep anything."</p>

<p>"It is true. Your king must think us all fools to follow
him."</p>

<p>"There are fools, rogues, jobbers, traitors on both sides, that
is why we make so little progress towards a good settlement. We
lack toleration, cool heads, unselfish aims, sincerity, men like
yourself, General Sarsfield."</p>

<p>The elderly Huguenot, who was walking about with quick steps,
here asked nervously:</p>

<p>"What would you have done, General Sarsfield, if your crazy
scheme had succeeded, and you had really captured the King of
England?"</p>

<p>Sarsfield glowed as he replied:</p>

<p>"I'd have had him to Waterford, on board a French frigate&mdash;he'd
have been in Paris, keeping his uncle company in a week or so."</p>

<p>The younger prisoner appeared extraordinarily moved by this.</p>

<p>"My God!" he exclaimed. "My God!" He put his handkerchief again
to his mouth. Sarsfield perceived that his eyes, staring above it,
were dark with rage.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've touched you!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The Huguenot replied with an effort:</p>

<p>"I was thinking that if you had been successful you would have
upset the affairs of Europe." Then he turned again to the fire and
seemed lost in thought. The flames leaping up disclosed his austere
face, remarkable for its look of stately composure; Sarsfield, more
and more interested in him, thought he had endured much with
courage and, though this was grotesque, that the countenance shaded
by thick and now disordered locks of that peculiar dark chestnut,
had a large look of Berwick; surely the same long, almond-shaped
eyes, the same finely-formed lips! But the man moved and the
likeness was lost.</p>

<p>"'Tis curious," he remarked, "we should be sitting here, General
Sarsfield; you are a bold, curious fellow. It is fine to be able to
do something for one's country; but I fear you will lose this
throw."</p>

<p>"What does it matter what goes, if one neither loses nor breaks
faith?" smiled Sarsfield.</p>

<p>"Why, that's true," the other cried, and turned to his
companion. "Do you hear? That's very true!"</p>

<p>"May be," added Sarsfield, "you've suffered in this war&mdash;lost
all, maybe?"</p>

<p>"Suffered? One does not think of it," the Huguenot replied, with
an ungrateful haughtiness. "Lost? Eh, my God!" he added coldly.
"Yes, no doubt you are right. What is your intention now? One of
our vedettes will be here very soon."</p>

<p>He rose; he seemed both weary and excited, but his self-control
was very powerful; the agitation of his companion increased.</p>

<p>"Well," said Sarsfield, with a great sigh, "you'd best get back
to your camp, gentlemen, and I to Limerick."</p>

<p>Galway protested&mdash;the two prisoners might be questioned, might
be induced, forced to speak...the younger Huguenot looked at him
aside and very dryly.</p>

<p>"Petty actions," he said, "are certainly beneath any one who
undertakes to command men. I commend you for your generosity,
sir."</p>

<p>"I would rather," replied Sarsfield, "have a fine enemy than a
mean friend. I do not hate you nor yet your Prince. I served
against him once&mdash;it seems a long time ago."</p>

<p>"I remember that," said the elder officer nervously; "but I
understand your loyalty. I think I can assure you that if William
of Orange should do what you call 'conquer Ireland' you would not
be the worse off for it, a good settlement all round, eh?"</p>

<p>"He shall not have the chance to prove his magnanimity, if I can
prevent it," smiled Sarsfield. "No, I've not lost hope, I'm not
disillusioned&mdash;"</p>

<p>The three went out into the courtyard where the prisoners'
horses, held by rapparees, waited. The landscape was clear in a
dull gray light; the fog had lifted. The foreigners mounted easily
and Sarsfield noted the extreme beauty of the younger man's
charger; a Polander of great speed and lightness. The rapparees
were reluctant to part with their prize, but made no attempt to
disobey Sarsfield.</p>

<p>Limerick, the Shannon, the besieging camp lay below in a faint,
distant mist; Sarsfield mocked himself; this was not a second
Ballyneety. He had failed, foolishly failed, as the reckless, the
audacious must so often fail; a sharp sting of mortification bit
him, but he smiled gallantly.</p>

<p>"You're lucky in your animal, sir," he said, stroking the arched
neck of the gray steed. "Plunder, or a lucky bargain?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" asked the rider, as if startled; then he laughed
good-humouredly, looking round at the dirty gray stone house, the
drab landscape, the dark lines of the beleaguered city. "They ought
to begin the cannonade," he remarked.</p>

<p>Then to Sarsfield: "'Tis very generous of you to give us our
liberty, General Sarsfield; I take you to be a good officer. We
could do with such, but&mdash;well, you will fight according to your
conscience and that is God's province."</p>

<p>He smiled on all about him and made a little bow, touching his
hat, then offered his hand to Sarsfield; as the Irishman took it he
felt, pressed into his palm, the other's handkerchief wrapped about
some hard object.</p>

<p>"My ransom."</p>

<p>The two officers turned their horses, made for the ruined gate,
and galloped through and across the bog path towards Singland.</p>

<p>Sarsfield unwrapped the handkerchief, which was of a costly
fineness unsuitable to a poor captain of Ruvigny's regiment; it
contained a vinaigrette, heavily mounted in gold.</p>

<p>O'Hogan ran into the courtyard breathless, his face red, his
hair wild, his clothes wet with thick mud.</p>

<p>"I had work to avoid them&mdash;Solms' men&mdash;two hundred of them;
they've caught some of us. That made me late getting through the
bog&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sarsfield gave brisk Borders&mdash;"To Limerick, the way we
came!"</p>

<p>O'Hogan said:</p>

<p>"You have him? He came this way&mdash;alone&mdash;with Solms, wearing the
uniform of De Ruvigny's men to-day, in his cunning, flattering way,
riding up here in a shabby great cloak?"</p>

<p>"Who? Who?" demanded Sarsfield, as his men began to hasten from
the courtyard.</p>

<p>"Why, King Willie&mdash;hoarse, very plain and quiet, not like any of
the prints of him&mdash;cool, but impatient too, wearing the George,
though&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sarsfield did not reply; he led his men under O'Hogan's skilful
care back to the ford, the Clare banks; the rain began again, the
whole landscape was sodden and colourless.</p>

<p>O'Hogan, disappointed and exhausted, dared not question
Sarsfield as to the particulars of this enterprise which had failed
so ignominiously, nor did he remark on the odd sentence which
Sarsfield muttered as the horses floundered through the swamps:</p>

<p>"I suppose that was what he put in his pocket."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-41" id="ch1-41"></a>FORTY-ONE</h2>

<p class="first">
THE LADY HONOR SARSFIELD looked at her husband sleeping on the
camp bed that he kept in his closet; she could see that he was very
weary; he had flung himself down without even pulling off his
boots; he was splashed with the bog mud, and his thick, rain-soaked
hair was still in wet rings. She considered him very keenly; his
face, shadowed and overspread with a pallor of fatigue, was the
same in slumber as in his most vivacious mood; his candid soul had
no secrets. She noted that and remembered that never had she
detected the slightest subterfuge in him; he was so tall, too, a
giant; but when he moved she was hardly aware of that, he was so
swift and graceful.</p>

<p>He grew restless under her scrutiny and woke, sat up startled,
then smiled quickly to see her there.</p>

<p>"You are overborne," said Honor. "I have made you some
coffee."</p>

<p>He listened to the rain and the cannonade, and came back to all
his fatigues. He was very grateful to Honor for the coffee.</p>

<p>"Another day! And I overslept!"</p>

<p>"You did not come back till the dawn, you were out all
night&mdash;such weather."</p>

<p>"A wild expedition, Honor, and it failed through my own great
folly." He looked despondent and mortified, then added to himself:
"But of course after all it was not he."</p>

<p>Honor took no heed of this; she never pried into his affairs; it
was very unusual for them to be alone together, he noticed that she
stayed with him and he was pleased.</p>

<p>"This is dismal for you, Honor, mewed up." Then he added shyly,
"The boy is well?"</p>

<p>"Yes. One contrives."</p>

<p>He considered her plain, almost drab, attire; she was very neat
and her natural dignity much emphasised of late, he thought.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I spoke about the spending, in Dublin, Honor; get
yourself some brocade, some lace&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How could I&mdash;in Limerick?" she smiled. "Besides, I don't want
it; I have given away much of what I had&mdash;or sold it."</p>

<p>"For money? For your needs?" He was startled, he was so careless
about money; they were very poor, having nothing but his pay and
that often delayed, but he had never thought of that, nor how he
had fallen from affluence to poverty; but now he wondered who had,
or would have, Lucan&mdash;some foreigner&mdash;</p>

<p>"For charity," said Honor, "there are always some Jews who are
willing to buy."</p>

<p>"I don't like you trading, Honor, I'd rather you wore the
things." He recalled Madame de Bonnac's careful splendour. "The
world isn't worth while without extravagance."</p>

<p>"There is the boy to think of, I try to put a little by for
him."</p>

<p>Sarsfield did not reply; he had nothing to leave his son. He
poured out more coffee and drank it slowly. The cannonading became
more violent; some of the big guns were being brought into action.
War, ever since Honor could remember, war somewhere; the boy, too,
he would have to be a mercenary soldier; she had no hope for the
future.</p>

<p>"I must go to the castle," said Sarsfield, roused by the
challenge of the firing; but she tried to detain him.</p>

<p>"Do you think there is a chance?"</p>

<p>"For us?"</p>

<p>"For Ireland."</p>

<p>"I don't know." He was very grave. "We've our backs to the wall.
If we are defeated we can't stay, not under a conqueror; it will be
exile." Then suddenly: "Do you care&mdash;for Ireland?"</p>

<p>She had not before seemed much concerned though she was a De
Burgh.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. I've felt it, shut up here&mdash;the horror, the shame,
harried, dispossessed by these foreigners. Yes, I care."</p>

<p>He could not speak of it, even after that; to thank her he
said:</p>

<p>"Luttrell and Berwick have distinguished themselves in the
sorties." The sudden tears rushed to her eyes, and he held out his
hand. "Berwick's a good lad, pedantic maybe, and too prudent,
but&mdash;well, only a lad&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is my age."</p>

<p>"Yes," he stared at her. "I forget, I'm too old for you&mdash;fifteen
years and more&mdash;that's too much, poor child."</p>

<p>He considered that death might soon release her; but could he
count on Berwick? If not, she would be desolate indeed, and there
was his boy...</p>

<p>"'Tis odd I've never had a wound," he mused. Swiftly she read
his thought.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't think I want that! I pray for your safety."</p>

<p>"I know, I know, the kindest heart, the tenderest
conscience&mdash;"</p>

<p>She wept at his praise; this was a finer man than he whom she
loved.</p>

<p>"I see nothing of the Duke of Berwick," she assured him
childishly.</p>

<p>"What if you did? I know you, Honor, and him&mdash;he does very
well." Then, as he knew Berwick had spoken spitefully of him, he
added, not being able to take a mean reprisal: "He will make a very
good soldier, a great man, perhaps. For his youth he lives very
soberly, no lewd pleasures like his brother&mdash;"</p>

<p>She understood that he assured her delicately that her lover had
no mistress, and her tears fell faster.</p>

<p>"Don't weep, Honor, now prithee don't, there are tears enough in
Ireland."</p>

<p>Duty was driving him; he was buckling on his sword, tying on his
sash. Honor desperately checked her sobs.</p>

<p>"Have you found&mdash;that girl?"</p>

<p>He paused, his hands on the buckles, and stared at her,
amazed.</p>

<p>"The girl&mdash;at Lucan," added Honor, gathering up her courage.</p>

<p>"No, I have not."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you've searched?"</p>

<p>"Toby O'Hogan is looking for her for me&mdash;he'll find her if any
can."</p>

<p>"Oh, he has given you no news?"</p>

<p>"I've not asked; when he finds her he'll tell me," replied
Sarsfield simply; "and he'll never give up searching."</p>

<p>"Do you think she is safe?"</p>

<p>"I must think she is safe."</p>

<p>"But, humanly speaking, these times&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She had a woman with her and a priest, and&mdash;" He stopped, not
wishing to speak of the dog.</p>

<p>"Oh, so well guarded!"</p>

<p>"The best I could."</p>

<p>His wide eyes looked at her with a complete candour, she knew he
concealed nothing, nor ever would.</p>

<p>"I wish," she said, "I had not sent her away."</p>

<p>"Do you, Honor?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have wanted to tell you so, there has been no chance. I
wish, Patrick, that I had been more&mdash;noble."</p>

<p>"You would have liked her," he said ingenuously. "She knows
nothing, but a princess by birth, Honor, a great lady, turning all
to dignity and favour, like yourself, Honor. Patient, too, and
blithe; gay, though she never had anything. Nothing at all."</p>

<p>Honor thought: "How he loves her and he has scarcely kissed her,
once perhaps&mdash;no more."</p>

<p>"Where can she be, Patrick?"</p>

<p>He made a gesture with his hand as if he followed the flight of
something almost intangible.</p>

<p>"She'll be safe," he said, "between God and the sidhe," he added
in his mind.</p>

<p>"If you find her, bring her to me."</p>

<p>"To you? You wish that, Honor? I expect she would be very
docile."</p>

<p>"I do wish it."</p>

<p>As he pulled his sash-knot into place he said:</p>

<p>"Why did you tell Madame de Bonnac about her being gone from
Lucan?"</p>

<p>"I did not. Madame de Bonnac and I hardly speak, hardly meet;
she has nothing but contempt for me. She told you I had so spoken?
She often lies."</p>

<p>"How would she come to know of it, Honor?"</p>

<p>"Oh, easily! She has so many&mdash;gallants. Colonel Luttrell finds
out everything; Lord Galmoy, too, and others. They have their spies
and agents."</p>

<p>"But this news would be of no importance to them, Honor."</p>

<p>"They gossip over everything," said Honor briefly. And Sarsfield
remembered that Madame de Bonnac had seen him riding to Lucan, and
had probably guessed his errand.</p>

<p>"She is a proud, expensive woman," added Honor. "She keeps
herself very fine whatever the miseries of others may be, and the
men like to go with her as a diversion; she is always clever, cool
and beautiful&mdash;one can understand"&mdash;she smiled shrewdly&mdash;"the value
of a creature like that&mdash;always brilliant, she is like a light in a
bog damp. Well, you must go?"</p>

<p>She approached him, hardly to his shoulder, but full of
dignity.</p>

<p>"I want to be very loyal, a faithful wife." She frowned in her
earnestness. "Do you&mdash;do you think that has any value, Patrick, to
you? Knowing what you do of my heart&mdash;and yours?"</p>

<p>"A great value, dear."</p>

<p>"It is not mere lip service? A hollow formality?"</p>

<p>"No." He thought of himself and the king he served. "Loyalty is
something in itself&mdash;worth while&mdash;I know, my poor child; now
prithee, be not burdened with these problems. Look up, dear heart,
thou art so young, bethink of the years to come, of the love that
surely awaits thee."</p>

<p>He stooped, kissed her brow, and was gone.</p>

<p>"How faithful he is to her," thought Honor and, lonely, wept
anew.</p>

<p>Sarsfield, making his way through the shelled streets and the
rain, thought of last night's wasted effort; no one would ever
know; O'Hogan and his Irish would be as mute over this as they had
been over the Dublin episode; Sarsfield's interference in that had
never come to the ears of Galmoy. But his personal mortification
was keen.</p>

<p>"Not to know him! He knew me, the sharp, cunning fox, and not to
betray himself by a look&mdash;but I'll not think it he, but one of
Ruvigny's Frenchmen."</p>

<p>Still Sarsfield's mood, saddened by the pathos of the interview
with his young wife, was one of unrest and despondency. If he
should have actually captured his victim and allowed him to escape!
It seemed an incredible piece of misfortune, and he was bound to
ascribe it largely to his own romantic folly...Galway and all his
friends would blame him severely if they knew; yet in his heart was
a feeling not altogether of mortification or regret, there had been
something noble in the episode. As for the Prince of Orange,
whatever he might be towards King James or towards Ireland,
Sarsfield liked the man. He pulled from his pocket the handkerchief
given him by the stranger last night, and for the first time
ventured to look closely at the vinaigrette it contained. The
crystal, that held a pungent aromatic, was engraved with the arms
of Nassau; the stopper was a royal crown with the beautiful cipher
of enlaced W's...Sarsfield smiled bitterly. "But he might easily
have had that without being the Prince."</p>

<p>But he remembered that cool, that ironic farewell bow&mdash;that
plunge of the noble horse into the dark. How was it that he had not
known that face which would have been noticeable anywhere? It
seemed so incredible that even the Prince's well-known recklessness
would go to the extent of riding far with a single companion. Yet
it was well noised abroad that he was of a careless impatience
which could ill brook even a short period of inaction, that he had
a passion for long and lonely rides, and cared nothing for the rain
or swamp.</p>

<p>"Like myself," thought Sarsfield, recognising a kinship with his
enemy, "that is what I would have done in his place. Well, 'twas a
fine chance to end the war, and I lost it. I was too sure. I
despised that ruffian Galmoy, but if I'd taken him with me maybe
he'd have known."</p>

<p>He heard the echo of Madame de Bonnac's "<i>Vous êtes fou</i>,"
and "Irish! Irish!"</p>

<p>That afternoon an assault was made on Limerick, and Sarsfield's
entire energies were instantly and completely absorbed.</p>

<p>After midday there came a pause in the rain, and the red August
sun shone on the beleaguered city, the swamps, the fierce struggle,
on the two standards&mdash;one at Singland and one on the steeple of St.
Mary's Church.</p>

<p>Harassed by the plundering of the rapparees who, under the
guidance of O'Hogan, effected considerable damage and annoyance on
the besiegers whose health and <i>morale</i> were undermined by the
interminable raids, by disease in several of its most ghastly
forms, by the approach of autumn, the Prince of Orange endeavoured
to take Limerick by storm and so bring this costly siege to an
end.</p>

<p>Through his glasses Sarsfield saw wool-packs and fascines being
conveyed to the trenches, where the grenadiers under General
Douglas had the post of honour.</p>

<p>At half-past three in the afternoon these strange-looking
soldiers, supported by a large body of horse, rushed from their
trenches, crossed the counterscarp and hurled themselves on the
breach, vigorously throwing their grenades. The Irish fell back,
hotly chased by the foe. But success did not long lie with the
English, the Prince of Orange was not there and the wrong order was
given, to attack the counterscarp (instead of storming the city);
the grenadiers were not supported in their swift advance. The Irish
rallied and overpowered the English; Sarsfield, leading in person,
animated his men valiantly; even the women joined in the foray,
crowding on the breach, hurling stones and broken glass. The
Brandenburgers threw themselves to the rescue and had near captured
the Black Battery when the magazine exploded.</p>

<p>The Germans wavered before the frightful burst of fire, and
Sarsfield charged with every man under his command. After a deadly
struggle of three hours the besiegers retreated sullenly,
reluctantly to their swampy camp; Limerick was not taken. About the
counterscarp were scattered five hundred English dead and more than
a thousand wounded, who writhed, moaned, struggled up and sank
again, their blood washed away by the rain that with the sunset
again fell incessantly.</p>

<p>The Prince of Orange sent a trumpet to ask permission of
Boisseleau to bury his dead and fetch his wounded...that was a
proud moment for Sarsfield, who was smoke-blackened, ragged,
filthy, but animated into high spirits by the hand-to-hand
fight.</p>

<p>"He will give it up," remarked Boisseleau with satisfaction; "he
will raise the siege." He added that he knew "the plague was
increasing in the Williamites' camp, and the ammunition becoming
more scanty, and that it would soon be impossible for the oxen to
draw off the heavy guns&mdash;he must give it up."</p>

<p>"And that will be difficult for a man like that," said Sarsfield
exultantly.</p>

<p>The Frenchman made a wry face; he disliked enthusiasm. "But of
course the Prince of Orange has conquered Ireland," he remarked
dryly. "Another army will be sent in the
spring&mdash;and&mdash;<i>voila</i>!"</p>

<p>Sarsfield remembered the previous night, and the man who had
spoken almost these very words; he laughed, wondering why, in all
the desperate fighting on the counter-scarp, he had received no
more than bruises and scratches.</p>

<p>That night a fireball set alight one of the houses; the flames
raged so violently, despite the rain, that it was necessary to blow
up some of the other houses to prevent the whole city being
burnt.</p>

<p>Exultant from deeds of arms, animated by unreasonable ardour,
Sarsfield superintended this work, aided by some of the rapparees
to whom this task of lavish destruction was very congenial.</p>

<p>As the stone dwellings blew into the air and the flames shot up
the Irish gave cries of excitement and pleasure, and leapt about
among the wreckage. The light illuminated the surgeons, chaplains
and Dutch soldiers who, during the brief truce, were removing the
dead and the dying from the shattered counterscarp; they worked
quietly without looking up; Sarsfield watched them curiously.</p>

<p>Presently, amid the sounds of the intermittent explosions and
the yells of the rapparees, he heard the rise and fall of a
Protestant hymn, resolute, steady, monotonous; these people were
not defeated; Sarsfield knew that they might retreat but that they
would return.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-42" id="ch1-42"></a>FORTY-TWO</h2>

<p class="first">
THE ASSAULT on Limerick which had been, in the words of one of
the Williamites, "one continual cloud of smoke which left many of
our men powder blind," had been the last effort of the Prince of
Orange to take the stubborn city. He had lost over two thousand men
in the final attack; it was a severe reverse.</p>

<p>Sarsfield was exultant to hear that the Prince had stood near
Cromwell's Fort all the time of the final assault "very much
concerned, with a mixture of anger and sorrow in his countenance."
Sarsfield watched the besiegers strike their tents and slowly draw
off through the rain and mist. All the Protestants followed the
army, with them went waggons of wounded and sick; such stores as
could not be taken away were blown up; the camp was burnt; behind
this screen of fire, the enemy went out of sight to Cahirconlish on
the Waterford road.</p>

<p>No sooner had they disappeared than Lauzun and the viceroy sent
ammunition and men into Limerick from Galway.</p>

<p>"The powder was needed," said Sarsfield simply. "There were but
fifty barrels left in Limerick, and not much of anything else." The
Lady Honor wept with relief at the cessation of the
cannonading.</p>

<p>Sarsfield was one of those detailed to destroy what remained of
the enemy's encampments, to remove the last defilements of the
heretics from the spot made holy by association with the blessed
Saint Patrick.</p>

<p>He got what satisfaction he could from this check to the Prince
of Orange; the defence of Limerick was, after all, a fine feat of
arms.</p>

<p>Against great odds his own religious and patriotic fervour had
accomplished a task which serious soldiers had told him it was
ridiculous to attempt.</p>

<p>Major-General Boisseleau had done his duty, but no more than his
bare duty. He would be rewarded by the King of France for what
seemed a magnificent effort, but it was to Sarsfield that all was
owing. Abandoned by the commander who should have defended her,
spoken of with contempt by experienced warriors, Limerick had yet
been able to resist veteran troops and one of the finest generals
in the world.</p>

<p>But Sarsfield felt a perverse loneliness at the loss of his most
worthy enemy; the Prince of Orange would return to England&mdash;"a man
I understood and who understood me."</p>

<p>Solms and Wurtemburg, left in command of the Protestants, were,
to Sarsfield, merely mercenaries. Now the enemy had gone, Lauzun
and Tyrconnel returned to Limerick; the latter, always an
opportunist, was inclined to regard the Irish cause as now more
hopeful; yet he was fast friends with Lauzun who was not at all
impressed by the raising of the siege of Limerick and still
resolute to take his men back to France together with his field
train&mdash;"of which (he boasted) he had only lost one gun and that not
to the enemy but in a damned bog."</p>

<p>Sarsfield endeavoured to persuade him to remain during the
winter in order to meet the English army which would certainly be
sent in the spring.</p>

<p>Lauzun, with his petulant air, turned on him roundly: "If there
was one to whom I wished the greatest plague in the world I would
get him sent to Ireland! It is a desperate business to be in my
place which is only fit for some one who has neither interest, nor
quiet, nor anything else to lose!"</p>

<p>Sarsfield did not reply, but Tyrconnel, who had lately grown
very corpulent and violent, put in that "After all it was a piece
of mere good nature on His Christian Majesty's part to keep up a
war in Ireland at all, and that for his part he knew that the
French officers only came over&mdash;to get there, to fight, and to get
back again."</p>

<p>"You must admit that it is a barbarous country, lacking
everything," added Lauzun, eyeing Sarsfield with irritation, and
playing with the George of Charles I, which King James had given
him. "Even our privates cannot live like your cow-stealers, on a
handful of oatmeal a day, and it is all quite impossible for a
gentleman."</p>

<p>"You are delicate," said Sarsfield quietly; "one understands,
you want white bread, dainties, clean linen, good wine, clear
fires, down beds, soft pretty women, gold to gamble with&mdash;but
perhaps, monseigneur, if you were fighting for your country, and
that down, down, down, you would contrive to do without these
things."</p>

<p>The autumn set in with mists, fogs, heavy continual storms of
rain and sleet; fighting was nearly over for the year; the various
armies went into winter quarters, such French as did not sail with
Lauzun went to Carlow, the Dutch and Danes to Clonmel, Cashel and
Waterford. The Duke of Wurtemburg and General Scravemore marched to
Cork.</p>

<p>Berwick and Sarsfield, who wished to celebrate the end of the
campaign by some encouraging and brilliant exploit, endeavoured to
take Birr Castle which was occupied by the Inniskillens; General
Kirk with the Blues and other regiments came to the relief, and the
two Jacobites were obliged to retire, not with a heightening of
their reputation.</p>

<p>Sarsfield's friends, the rapparees, whom he had found so useful,
were bringing some disrepute on his name; they plundered, too, do
what he would, enemy and friend with equal rapacity; he discovered
that even his officers were conniving at this rapine and robbery,
sometimes actually encouraging it because they themselves were on
the same game.</p>

<p>Near Mallow the Duke of Wurtemburg came upon a large body of
these rapparees who, encouraged by Sarsfield, had made up a manner
of regiment of their own; the Germans inflicted severe punishment
on these Irish, killing above three hundred and recovering some
rich plunder, including magnificent horses and rich swords; the
Williamites, however, continued to be seriously harried by the
rapparees who were so skilful that "when they feared detection they
would sink down into the long grass, standing corn or other
convenient cover, would dismount the locks of their pieces, stow
them away in some dry spot or about their clothes, would stop the
muzzles of their pieces with corks and the touch-holes with small
quills, and then throw them away confidently into a pond so that a
hundred of them might be seen without arms looking like the most
miserable creatures in the world"; and the Williamites could search
them until they were weary before they "could find one gun, yet
when the rapparees had a mind to do a mischief they were all ready
at an hour's warning." Sarsfield, strictly bred a professional
soldier, thought with chagrin of the strict discipline enforced by
the Prince of Orange who, in his anger at seeing a poor woman
robbed, had struck the offender with his cane, and hanged any man
of his who dared to plunder; but he could not blame his poor Irish
who, unpaid, despised, starving, hounded, were fighting for their
lives, their country, their faith.</p>

<p>General Ginckel, a Dutchman of high repute, was left in command
of the English forces; he had not finished the campaign as
Sarsfield had too confidently believed.</p>

<p>The Earl of Marlborough landed at the Cove of Cork at the end of
September and made a union with the Duke of Wurtemburg; within a
few days Cork and Kinsale fell.</p>

<p>Tyrconnel and Lauzun appeared more pleased with this ill news
than they were with the raising of the siege of Limerick. Sick with
the hardships of Ireland which he detested and longing more with
every day to return to France, Lauzun impressed once again on
Sarsfield the complete folly of any attempt to further resist the
King of England, as he now openly named William of Orange.</p>

<p>Sarsfield found himself heading a "No surrender party" against
the followers of the viceroy, who finally decided to sail for
France with Lauzun, to put, he said, "the Irish case before King
Louis."</p>

<p>He relegated his military authority to the Duke of Berwick with
a council of twelve officers to assist him. With a smile of real
humour Sarsfield saw his name last on the list of those who were to
advise the boy of twenty; there was something childish about the
viceroy's jealousy of the one man who could have helped him save
Ireland.</p>

<p>"Well," thought Sarsfield with his ardent spirits rising,
"Berwick is already a better man than his father, and maybe help
will come from France."</p>

<p>He had the name of Governor of Connaught, with what authority he
could himself obtain. But he could not disguise from himself the
frightful state of the country; there was a dearth of everything;
the "gun" or brass money was no longer accepted anywhere; the trade
with France which had continued during the war had now to be kept
up by means of barter; tallow, cattle, butter, corn and hides being
sent in return for other provisions and war material.</p>

<p>Limerick having been battered almost to a ruin, the Jacobites
moved their headquarters to Galway, the old, dark, severe Spanish
town.</p>

<p>The news from France was bewildering, if amusing. Lauzun had
only escaped the Bastille through the pleas of Mary of Modena; King
James often waited in vain on the threshold of King Louis's
antechambers, and Tyrconnel was reported to be urging Louvois to
send supplies to Ireland which was "well worth fighting for."</p>

<p>"Tyrconnel veers with every wind that blows," said Sarsfield.
"Who may guess what game he plays now?"</p>

<p>But his own duty was plain; he must continue to animate the
party willing to make a last stand for Ireland.</p>

<p>Matters did not go smoothly in Galway; civil affairs were
controlled by a council of twelve; faction fights were continuous;
the Duke of Berwick was neither of the age nor the authority to
quell them. With disarming candour Sarsfield sought out the young
Duke and asked of him his intentions, for since he had been in the
position of commander-in-chief Berwick had borne himself with his
usual haughty, austere reserve.</p>

<p>"You need not, my lord, talk to me of politics," said Sarsfield
mournfully. "I am as intimate as you with the various factions and
intrigues which distract us. I know that Tyrconnel at one moment
urges Louvois to send fresh troops here, and at another moment he
is maybe in secret negotiation with the Prince of Orange."</p>

<p>"He is not the only one," said Berwick coolly. "Do you suspect
none other?"</p>

<p>"I suspect many," said Sarsfield bitterly, "but I do not know
who your grace means in particular."</p>

<p>Berwick replied: "Henry Luttrell."</p>

<p>Sarsfield was startled. He knew the man to be, under his cool,
mocking exterior, both sly and ambitious, and he remembered the
proposals he had made to both Berwick and himself, but he had not
believed he would go so far as negotiations with the enemy...</p>

<p>"You are sometimes simple, sir," added Berwick. "I at least am
having Luttrell watched; I may order his arrest at any moment."</p>

<p>"I believe it would be dangerous&mdash;the man has a considerable
following."</p>

<p>"Why, every jumped-up-Jack hath a considerable following,"
sneered Berwick. "But you have spoken to me frankly and I would
frankly answer. I have sent a deputation secretly to France to
explain directly to Louvois, who is more important than King Louis,
the Irish point of view. I have ordered these men to urge," he
added, with cold pride, "my own inexperience, and that my legal
authority is questioned. I have begged them to send a
<i>generalissimo</i> of weight and knowledge, some man who will be
obeyed and respected by all."</p>

<p>"My lord, your grace has acted nobly."</p>

<p>"I have done my plain duty."</p>

<p>Sarsfield did not answer, he had not known till now where
Berwick considered his plain duty lay, he was not an Irishman; it
was strange that he should have so correctly gauged the Irish
feeling, that he should have had the dignity to understand that he
was in an impossible position and the address to try to get out of
it with credit.</p>

<p>"It's the only way to get French help," he added; "it's the only
way to prolong the war. Now, General Sarsfield, you understand my
intentions, I hope you respect my integrity."</p>

<p>"That I have always done."</p>

<p>"I do not think King Louis will utterly break with us, we are
but a pawn in his game, yet we are a pawn which may at any moment
be useful. I believe he will send a general, also some supplies and
money, and I believe with this help, General Sarsfield," added the
young man with a brilliant flash in his long eyes, "you and I and
the Irish can hold out even against General Ginckel and the Earl of
Marlborough. There is much to put right," he added, walking up and
down and speaking with an authoritative air. "There is too much
pillage; you and your friendship with the rapparees, Sarsfield, are
responsible for much of that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have done what I can," replied the Irishman; "it is almost
impossible to control these people or to manage without their
help."</p>

<p>"I must warn you," continued Berwick, who seemed to be holding
himself well in hand and labouring under the stress of some strong
emotion that he would by no means disclose, "that if a
<i>generalissimo</i> is sent from France I may be recalled. That
will be of little loss to you, you will not miss a friend, but you
may miss an ally," he added with his cool smile. "But I, as matters
stand, am useless here. I have to learn to obey before I can
command. None of you Irish listen to me. I suppose to you I am an
alien like my father."</p>

<p>"If you are going, my lord, I am sorry," said Sarsfield.
"Indeed, I would sooner have you here than any French general. I
must confess that I shall ill brook to act under such a one."</p>

<p>"You will act under Tyrconnel," said Berwick; "he will
return."</p>

<p>The two men, who had so much in common, who shared a mutual
admiration one for the other, yet who were separated by a great
deal, shook hands. Sarsfield remembered how he had clasped hands
with the enemy officer who might have been the most redoubtable of
his foes&mdash;there was something noble in a fine enmity, in the
hand-grasp of one disliked but respected and trusted.</p>

<p>"It will be the last stand," remarked Berwick coolly. "If we do
not succeed in this next campaign it will be other battlefields for
us, my dear Sarsfield"; and he added in a gentle tone: "I am sorry
for your wife&mdash;I am sorry for all the women."</p>

<p>Young as he was the words did not sound absurd, nor did
Sarsfield smile.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-43" id="ch1-43"></a>FORTY-THREE</h2>

<p class="first">
THE HOUSE that the Lady Honor had in Galway was a noble mansion
but stately and gloomy, too grand, she said, for her state; the
dark Spanish city oppressed her; the wild loneliness of the sea
flowing into the great bay was in the very air, she thought. But
she rallied her spirits and her dignity and lived with some
distinction in the grim, austere house. This grandiose dwelling
stood at the corner of the street and was handsomely adorned with
coats of arms, sculptured brackets and deep mullioned Gothic
windows; the entries were wide, the stairs broad, an inner stone
courtyard was filled with heavy vases that held the withered flags
of what had been summer flowers.</p>

<p>The furniture was sombre, massive; Honor tried to please her
husband by making what light and splendour she could in these rooms
too large, in these corridors too shadowy. In dresses of pale
sarcenet and flowered taffeta with small braids of pearl and little
combs of coral she modestly entertained Sarsfield's friends; Galway
her brother, Dominic Sarsfield, Lord Kilmallock, her husband's
cousin, Berwick, some of the French officers and their ladies, and
Colonel Luttrell, who lately professed the warmest friendship for
Sarsfield and seemed to have forgotten that they had ever had any
cause of difference; and Sarsfield was willing to forget it also.
Luttrell was the most entertaining of companions and could make
himself as agreeable in a lady's parlour as in a tavern or a
guard-room. He took the colour of any society he was in and was as
elegant at a tea-drinking as he was lively in a pothouse.</p>

<p>It was difficult to resist such vivacity, such insinuating
charm, when all was so sad, uncertain and painful; Luttrell
encouraged Sarsfield's natural easy humour and made Honor laugh
with his tales which were a little wild and fantastic, but always
fitting the austerity of the little <i>dévote,</i> as Luttrell
named Honor in his heart.</p>

<p>He did much to enlighten the winter in Galway where the most
distinguished of the Irish shut up in Connaught and Clare had
crowded.</p>

<p>When the viceroy returned from France in the middle of January
the Lady Honor was entertaining a little company in her dark
leather-hung withdrawing-room; they were listening to Henry
Luttrell's (Brigadier now, and of great influence in court and
camp) amusing account of the capture of Charlemont Castle, which
had been taken by Schomberg who now lay waiting his monument in St.
Patrick's Cathedral.</p>

<p>Charlemont had been held for James by a tough old soldier,
Teague O'Regan who, when summoned to surrender, roared a high
defiance: "Tell your master he is an old knave and, by St. Patrick,
he shall not have the place!" Schomberg replied that Teague should
have greater cause for anger before long and sent reinforcements
and soon starved out the garrison of eight hundred men...they were
allowed to march out with arms and baggage, women and children.</p>

<p>"And then was a sight diverting indeed," smiled Luttrell, "and
one very creditable to the spirit of the ancient Irish. Old Teague
was mounted upon an old horse and he very lame with the scratches,
spavin, ringbone and other infirmities, but withal vicious and
would fall a-kicking and squealing if any one came near
him...Teague himself had a great hunch upon his back, a plain red
coat, an old weather-beaten wig hanging down at full length, a
little narrow white beaver cocked up, a yellow cravat-string, but
that all one side, boots with a thousand wrinkles in them; and,
though it was a very hot day, yet he had a great muff hanging about
him, and to crown all, he was almost tipsy with brandy! Schomberg,
seeing so many women and children, asked the reason of keeping such
a number in the garrison, who no doubt destroyed their provisions?
Teague answered that naturally the Irish were very hospitable and
that they all fared alike, but the greatest reason was that the
soldiers would not stay in the garrison without their wives and
mistresses. The duke replied there was more love than policy in
it."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for the old man," said Honor, but she laughed;
Luttrell had brought gaiety into the shadowed, ancient room.</p>

<p>The gathering was interrupted by the entry of Tyrconnel who had
just arrived in Galway, and with odd condescension had come to
Sarsfield's house; the company rose to receive him. He seemed in
the best of humours and his huge person, still most corpulent, was
set off with Paris clothes and a fine great periwig, so that he had
a very majestic, stately appearance.</p>

<p>He made himself very affable to the ladies and complimented all
on the fashion in which the government had been run in his absence.
Sarsfield smiled openly; Tyrconnel must know, he thought, the real
state of affairs; for himself, his conscience and his hands were
clean.</p>

<p>He had maintained honourable but cold relations with Berwick,
the young commander-in-chief, who had continued to accept his
position with grace and dignity, holding himself above the quarrels
and intrigues of the civil and military councils. Sarsfield
regarded the viceroy with some suspicion and dislike, for he
half-believed that Tyrconnel had played a treacherous part at St.
Germains, thinking only of his own interests and assuring the king
and his ministers it was useless to send further help to "a lost
island and a cowardly people." But the viceroy, whose character it
was difficult for any man to precisely come at, had a way of
trimming his sails to the breeze at the moment&mdash;he might have
honestly tried to get help from France. At the first opportunity he
withdrew Sarsfield into a small closet, complimented him again,
appeared satisfied with everything and laughed over Lauzun whom he
termed "a vicious old monkey," having just escaped the
Bastille.</p>

<p>"I thought he was your grace's friend," remarked Sarsfield.</p>

<p>With many full, round oaths the viceroy justified his change of
sentiment towards Lauzun; Sarsfield had always admired Tyrconnel's
command of flowing invective and blasphemous abuse which he
contrived to deliver with a stately and dignified air.</p>

<p>Leaning on the back of a heavy bureau, fine in his purple velvet
coat and his fashionable appointments, the viceroy laid bare
affairs with what seemed noisy candour&mdash;and professed a new and odd
friendliness for Sarsfield. He had brought with him Sir Richard
Nargle and Sir Stephen Wright entrusted with the king's commands
for the civil administration&mdash;very able men who would make all go
smoothly. In his jovial, hasty manner he seemed to court Sarsfield
who, worn and pale with public and private anxiety, looked at him
dubiously.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, affairs go very well and you shall have no need to
complain of me. I do not admit that we have not had our
differences, as honest gentlemen must; there have been times when
we have not danced in step."</p>

<p>"I doubt if we ever shall," smiled Sarsfield.</p>

<p>But Tyrconnel motioned him to silence with a wave of his plump
hand.</p>

<p>"We must, we must. You have not heard me out." Then his spirits
seemed to fail; he stared moodily at the small fire.</p>

<p>Sarsfield had noticed that the viceroy looked ill and as if he
had been drinking heavily. He was after all but a wreck of his
former magnificence, although so sumptuously decked in French
fashions. He spoke again rapidly and, rather to the Irishman's
surprise, as if he wished to win Sarsfield to his views. He
repeated with oaths (and Sarsfield was almost sure he was lying)
that he had done all he could to persuade the King of France to
send succours to Ireland. "And he is sending them. I am followed by
a frigate and nine other vessels," he boasted, striding about
heavily. "And what is in the ships?" demanded Sarsfield.
"Provisions, clothes, arms, ammunition, money, money, my dear
Sarsfield&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But no men?"</p>

<p>"Nay. I myself advised His Majesty that French and Irish
soldiers do not agree well, that we have plenty of troops here and
gallant fellows, too, if they were well-officered by men like
yourself and some experienced Frenchmen."</p>

<p>Sarsfield loathed this flattery; in Tyrconnel's sunken eyes he
thought he saw the ancient hatred still gleaming viciously, "like
in the eyes of a bad-tempered horse with a hard mouth."</p>

<p>"How much money has His Most Christian Majesty deigned to send?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Eight thousand pounds," said Tyrconnel, and Sarsfield laughed
aloud.</p>

<p>"Berwick will be recalled," said Tyrconnel, without noticing the
bitter interruption, "and instead we are to have Lieutenant-General
St. Rhue, who will bring with him <i>Maréchaux de Camp</i> D'Usson
and De Tessé; they have orders to replenish all the stores, to
overhaul our defences, to inspect and organise everything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Such inspection and organisation that could be done Berwick and
I have done," cried Sarsfield. "Is this man to be put over all of
us, this Frenchman?"</p>

<p>"Not over me," replied Tyrconnel, purpling in the face. "I shall
remain his superior both in the council and in the camp. I doubt,"
he added with a chuckle, "if he will brook it very well, for he is
a creature of a most imperious temper who has never been
controlled. He has earned a hard name by his severity in the
Cevennes."</p>

<p>"He does not sound to me the manner of man who will please the
Irish."</p>

<p>"No," grinned Tyrconnel, "but it may be that he is the manner of
man who will beat the English."</p>

<p>"I hear," said Sarsfield, "that you have also brought a number
of lawyers. There have been complaints already about that."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"The Irish believe," smiled Sarsfield with his mournful glance
fixed on the gross yet still impressive figure of the Duke of
Tyrconnel, "that you have come with no soldiers because you still
wish to make a treaty with the English, and that you have brought
your lawyers to engross the parchment."</p>

<p>"These tales," returned the viceroy contemptuously, "get abroad
with any public man. I wonder that you should listen to them."</p>

<p>"I must listen to everything I hear; my position is one of great
difficulty, almost intolerable."</p>

<p>Tyrconnel shrugged and Sarsfield continued:</p>

<p>"You have given great discontent, my lord duke, by ordering the
release of those friends of yours, in particular Riverstown and
Daly, whom we cast into prison on suspicion that they wished to
treat with the English."</p>

<p>"They were falsely charged," blustered Tyrconnel. His friendly
manner to Sarsfield, which had been but a gloss over his deep
dislike, began to disappear. "It seems to me you wish to pick a
quarrel," he added. "I tell you I have been a sick man...You may
think yourself very loyal and patriotic in holding Limerick and
Connaught, but I tell you it's been nothing to the bedchamber
intrigues I have been through in Paris. By St. Patrick! I've had to
deal with King Louis and Louvois and King James, who has almost
turned dotard monk. Why do you doubt my zeal? Only yesterday when I
landed I issued a proclamation inviting the English soldiers to
return to His Majesty, offering a reward to each man who does so,
promising to send them to France if they wish, and I'll dare swear
that a good many will come forward in the hope of getting out of
this accursed country."</p>

<p>"You call it an accursed country!" said Sarsfield. "Do not,
therefore, my lord, expect me to believe in your patriotism and
loyalty. Besides, you talk of offering temptations, enticing
bribes&mdash;where is the money to make good your promises?"</p>

<p>The Duke of Tyrconnel seemed after all resolute not to be
affronted; Sarsfield perceived that his design was to preserve at
least an outward amity with himself. He further confirmed this
impression by saying that he would reside in Galway where Sarsfield
intended to make his winter quarters, in order, as he said, "to
prove to the Irish that harmony was restored and that their leaders
were acting in concert." Then he added, with a touch of
graciousness in his manner:</p>

<p>"I have brought you a reward for your loyalty and gallantry. I
have in my pocket your commission as Lieutenant-General and your
patent as Earl of Lucan, Viscount Tully and Baron Rosberry."</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield flushed. It seemed to him that this was like a
sugar-plum offered to a schoolboy. Tyrconnel was quick and adroit
enough to see that he had merely offended the man to whom he spoke,
and he added courteously:</p>

<p>"It will please my lady your wife and gratify the people to whom
you are such an idol&mdash;well, well, take it for what 'tis worth."</p>

<p>"I want authority, not commissions and titles," said Sarsfield.
"You took good care, my lord duke, to put my name last on the
Council&mdash;these belated honours come ill from your hands." And he
wondered, with a sickening depression of spirit, if Tyrconnel tried
to bribe him, if there was some scheme (in which he was to be
involved), whereby the rest of Ireland was to be delivered over to
the conqueror. No men sent and very little money&mdash;Tyrconnel in this
mood, sly and cunning&mdash;so that one could not get hold of his real
intentions&mdash;this title, flung as it were in his face&mdash;</p>

<p>"You've deserved more, no doubt," remarked the stout duke,
stroking his sleek, fleshy jowl with his carefully-kept hand, "but
it must suffice for a time, my lord. And now," he added, as if he
threw a weight off his broad shoulders, "let us endeavour to make
the winter in Galway as gay as the winter in Dublin, and have a few
balls and banquets, fetes and entertainments to please the
ladies&mdash;ay, and to show the accursed Dutchman, Ginckel, that we
have a little spirit left."</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed Sarsfield, "shall we not rather think to get
ourselves in good fettle for the next campaign which I do believe
will be the last?"</p>

<p>"Gloom and repining," declared Tyrconnel curtly, "will help
nothing. You should take a lesson from the court of France where
they contrive to dance and amuse themselves and rule the world as
well. And I advise you"&mdash;there was a touch of sharpness in his
voice&mdash;"to prepare yourself, my lord, to get on well with the
Marquis St. Rhue; he is a difficult man and I cannot say I, myself,
can well endure his damned arrogance, but we must put up with it;
in the Cevennes he was known as the scourge of the heretics."</p>

<p>"That is not the manner of man to send to Ireland when the
Prince of Orange uses the weapons of conciliation and moderation,"
exclaimed Sarsfield. "Does this Frenchman think he has come here to
flog the Protestants as he did in France?"</p>

<p>"Why, so he does, and a great deal of good it would do 'em!"</p>

<p>Sarsfield left the interview feeling like a man who has been
entreated with indulgent irony&mdash;a title, a commission as
lieutenant-general! He judged himself and weighed up his actions.
Well, perhaps he deserved no more. What had he done after all? In
so much he had failed. Tyrconnel's words: "It will please my lady
your wife," echoed in his ears. No doubt women liked these
honours&mdash;after all the striving&mdash;a toy to please his wife!</p>

<p>Sarsfield took some faint pleasure in informing Honor that she
was a countess. She did seem, at first, to glow at the news and to
appreciate the kindness with which he gave it; but she did not long
conceal from him that she was in panic grief. He knew why. Berwick
was departing on the frigate that was bringing the French
generals.</p>

<p>"Patrick," she said, (how seldom had she given him his name,)
"this is the end for me; you know how I have striven; I have done
nothing wrong," she said, with the pitiful futility of a child
caught in a mischief, "and it has been hard."</p>

<p>"Hard for all of us," said Sarsfield, "and better he should
go."</p>

<p>Honor flung herself on her husband's bosom and clasped him
passionately. Her smooth cheek pressed into the gold braid on his
uniform, and he held her in an infinite pity and not without a hope
that even yet some comfort might come between them, one from the
other.</p>

<p>"There is only you now," she said. "There is only you, and I
have resolved to think of you as my husband. I have been harsh and
cruel and left undone so much I might have done."</p>

<p>"God knows," said Sarsfield, stroking her smooth dark hair;
"there are few of us who could not say that, if we were sincere,
and I bear you no grievance, my wife."</p>

<p>Honor dried her tears and, with a wild change of mood in itself
indicating unhappiness, began to dilate on the gaieties promised in
Galway that winter. After all, the prospect was not so dark...The
Prince of Orange had left, Marlborough had come and gone...Cork
might have fallen and Kinsale, but Galway and Connaught were safe,
and they did not lack supplies. She babbled foolishly of these
things, but her mention of Cork and Kinsale had reminded him that
Irrelagh was in the hands of the enemy, and even while his wife
talked to him, voluble in her piteous, hollow gaiety, in her new
honour, and pathetically anxious, he thought, to please and
conciliate him, he was thinking of the lost Ishma&mdash;vanished like a
dryad in leaves, like a nymph in foam...Oh, she was safe in some
dark defile, some hidden glen...some secret cloister!</p>

<p>Ishma was with him like his sword, never thought of but ever
necessary, she had become one with Ireland; never, he believed,
could he have achieved this frantic exaltation, this almost
desperate agony of patriotism, had it not been for Ishma
O'Donaghoe. He was strangely supported in his belief, which was one
with his unquestioning faith, that somewhere the girl was safe,
hidden and safe...But at times pain would overtake him, seizing,
overwhelming the citadel of his fortified heart and mind. So
changed became his face that his wife stopped her chattering and
asked him sharply, "what ailed him?"</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Patrick? You are not thinking of me, nor
Tyrconnel, nor his news, your mind is very far away."</p>

<p>Sarsfield started; Honor, who had been so valiantly talking down
her own perturbed heart, stood looking at him in silence; the last
January light falling faintly in the narrow street, through the
narrow window, showed her slim youth in the pale green silk, the
seed pearls with the smooth banded hair, the fine precise face. He
did not attempt to deceive her.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, Honor," he added whimsically. "I am sorry,
too, that now we have the title of Lucan we have not the
estate."</p>

<p>"'Tis a pity."</p>

<p>"But all may come, there is to be one more throw for it, next
spring."</p>

<p>"Would that you were to take the post given to this
Frenchman."</p>

<p>"Would I were!" cried Sarsfield, all his soul in his eyes. "But
I am only an Irishman." He took Honor's hands in his and added
simply: "I wonder if the day will ever come when Irishmen will rule
in Ireland. No French, or English, or any foreigners&mdash;but we alone
in our own country."</p>

<p>"You dream of that, Patrick?"</p>

<p>"Yes, even after centuries of subjection, of contempt, of ruin
and slavery, I dream of that. But not for me, I think, nor for my
children's children."</p>

<p>Honor trembled and her husband at once assumed a lighter
tone.</p>

<p>"Luttrell was here to-day. He is a man I like but do not trust.
Never a word before him you would not say before your
coachman."</p>

<p>"Oh, he only tells foolish stories that distract, but indeed I
am careful."</p>

<p>He left her, he had to attend the viceroy at the council; left
her to walk about in the shadows of the dark Spanish mansion and
muse over the lover who would so soon leave Ireland and whom it was
very unlikely she would see again.</p>

<p>That night of solitude even her prayers did not soothe Honor de
Burgh, now Countess of Lucan; she saw a spectre in every shade,
heard a cry in every gust of wind, and woke in cold terror to dream
she saw the ban sidhe seated on the sill of her narrow window.</p>

<p>"For whom art thou come?" cried the young woman, solitary in her
dark-hung bed; she clutched her thin night-gear to her slight bosom
and marked with horror the wavering red light cast by the little
lamp beneath a shrine set high above the door through the gloom,
and the cold creep of the January wind down the chimney which blew
the ashes on the hearth.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-44" id="ch1-44"></a>FORTY-FOUR</h2>

<p class="first">
HORRIBLE were the days, dreadful was the waiting that winter in
Galway. Tyrconnel flattered the Earl of Lucan, almost fawned on
him, but their public and private enmity continued...Lucan
perpetually reproached the viceroy for not making sufficient
preparations for the arrival of the new commander-in-chief; he
reminded him what an ill effect the letting out of prison of the
men who had been treacherously dealing with England had had.
Tyrconnel had laughed in his face and said:</p>

<p>"The Duke of Berwick who put them there is himself suspected of
corresponding with his uncle, the Earl of Marlborough."</p>

<p>Lucan did not believe this. He went his own way, that of wild
action; he seldom attended the balls, the banquets, the gambling
parties, the useless, expensive, foolish entertainments where his
handsome face and figure, his brilliant presence were so admired
and applauded; when he did he was like an automaton, his heart and
mind elsewhere. Tyrconnel made little attempt to control him, no
attempt to support him; with an army largely of his own raising
Lucan defended the passes of the Shannon, now here, now there, with
his rapparees, his horse, his almost unarmed volunteers, lacking
artillery, lacking powder, lacking all but the staunch fortitude,
the flame of ardour which is all; he kept Douglas, Kirke, Lanier
and Tettau at bay, he fed his men on corn cunningly buried, he
mounted them on horses stolen in raids from the enemy; he took
twenty-two mounts from General Lanier's stables under his very
nose; he worried Ginckel himself, the cautious Dutchman safe in his
winter quarters at Mullingar...</p>

<p>Always swift in action, kept by the rapparees accurately
informed of the movements of the English, he galloped from post to
post, Toby O'Hogan usually by his side, guarding the great noble
river, strengthening guards, entrenching positions, protecting the
very heart of Ireland...in truth the governor of Connaught.</p>

<p>Tyrconnel, who held that there should be no fighting in the
winter, smiled offensively through his flatteries, and said:</p>

<p>"My lord, this is freebooters' behaviour; you should wait till
St. Rhue comes in May."</p>

<p>Lucan did not answer; he was absorbed in watching for a chance
to take the offensive against Kirke or Lanier...he seldom came to
Galway where the mad gaieties of the garrison offended him; he had
fixed his headquarters at Athlone.</p>

<p>But he left Honor, under the protection of the viceregal court,
in the old Spanish mansion, and now and then visited her; riding in
muddy, rain-soaked; with great haste and with an escort of Irish,
scarf, hair and sash blowing in the harsh winds from the Atlantic,
a superb figure taking heed of none save those willing to fight
with him, disdainful of the factions, the intrigues, the party
spites that seethed among the Jacobites.</p>

<p>Once he galloped into Limerick and found his wife abroad
card-playing at Galway's lodgings; he followed her there and strode
into the heated room, bringing with him the scent of the rain, the
bog, the frost. And all stared.</p>

<p>"Honor," said Lucan, ignoring them all, and his pale young wife
rose up from her stool beneath a garlanded wall mirror.</p>

<p>"Have you come home, Patrick? Will you stay tonight?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Lanier is moving on Lanesborough. I have no time at
all&mdash;for a word only, my dear."</p>

<p>She followed him, too proud to make excuses, out between the
gamblers and idlers. But one there was not minded to let him go so
easily; Madame de Bonnac, leaning across a card-table glittering
with real gold (part of the French hoard), caught him by the coat
lapel as he passed and asked him earnestly, so that he was forced
to look down and regard her beauty, "why he was so stern and
hasty?"</p>

<p>"If you have a secret grief perhaps I can help you."</p>

<p>Brigadier Henry Luttrell and Lord Galmoy, who were in her
company, laughed, whispering comments on "great rapparees and muddy
cow-stealers."</p>

<p>"Do you try to make me publicly ridiculous, madam?" asked Lucan
without bitterness; he gently loosened the lovely fingers that held
his coat.</p>

<p>But she rose and followed him and his wife and spoke again by
the doorway, where there was a little space so that they could not
easily be overheard. She seemed in a wild, emotional mood. She
challenged him, asking him to his face if he could suppose that she
had ever forgotten him, if he imagined that she had ever given up
hope "of being your friend, my lord."</p>

<p>"Your wife," she added, with a boldness that was not without its
generosity, "is nothing to me, nay, nor that other girl."</p>

<p>Lucan smiled without replying; he considered her beauty, as
something cold, almost repellent, a blossom without root or fruit.
But she had her heart, her feelings, it seemed. She broke into
checked tears and turned away from him, a stately, voluptuous woman
overcome by what looked like heartbreak; he watched her return to
the card table and fling about the gold pieces with Luttrell,
laughing loudly, then he followed his wife from the room.</p>

<p>"If I had known that you were coming I had been at home," said
Honor.</p>

<p>"It matters not. I cannot say when I may come or when I may go.
Tyrconnel gives you news?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"So I thought. I am come to tell you, Honor, my poor child, that
the Marquis de St. Rhue is due in a week or so, and that now 'tis
certain Berwick will return to France on the frigate that brings
him."</p>

<p>He was frightened by her face and turned aside.</p>

<p>"Why do you tell me this?"</p>

<p>"You might hear it in company from others. Have you seen him
much of late?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, no. They say he now minds his youthful pleasures more
than his duties."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;still?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Always, I think. I would I had not this tedious
fidelity."</p>

<p>"Say farewell to him, Honor, in private, when you will.
If you wish I will bid him wait on you."</p>

<p>"You came to Galway for this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, maybe I shall not be able to come again before Berwick
leaves."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Must you go so soon&mdash;now?"</p>

<p>"Why, you don't want my company?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Oh, a great deal. Look, there is a little fire here, let
us sit by it but half an hour."</p>

<p>He indulged her out of pity for her loneliness, grief and youth,
out of respect for her valiancy. The rain beat on the small panes
of the window hidden by the red curtains; the noise of the gamblers
could be faintly heard; Honor shivered, sat on a stool near the
hearth, and put her little feet near the feeble embers.</p>

<p>"The young gentlewoman&mdash;you have not heard of her?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear. But I have no fears."</p>

<p>She looked at him and envied, as Olivia Joyce had once envied,
any woman whom he might love; though he wore his uniform as
lieutenant-general in His Majesty's Forces he had no longer the
spruce look of a soldier on parade; but seemed more a man acting on
his own authority, having many to obey him; she could see that he
cared very little for Tyrconnel; "The viceroy gives me a thousand
caresses," he said, "but I do not trust him," and he added that he
was himself sending despatches direct to Louvois.</p>

<p>Generously responding to her unfeigned interest, he told her
something of his work on the Shannon...he had hoped to cross the
river and attack the English in the rear but had had to dash to
support O'Hara attacked at Jamestown by Douglas who aimed at Sligo.
"And I can't rely on Clifford; he is one of Tyrconnel's men, he
ought to have been made a major-general, that would have kept him
quiet; twice he has asked permission to throw up his commission; I
fear he'll abandon Ballymore, I must get him removed."</p>

<p>"Is that place important?"</p>

<p>"Ay, dear heart, it supports a county of twenty thousand
peasants with their cattle, besides several regiments; it threatens
the garrisons of Mearescourt and Streamtown. When the campaign
opens it will be the first place Ginckel will attack. I must," he
added restlessly, "get there at once; Clifford has burnt a castle
near Mullingar that I wished to hold, and without orders from me."
He glanced down at his wife's pale, intent face and laughed. "What
is all this hard business to thee?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry," she said, with a glow of real championship, "that
this Frenchman will come to supersede you in what you do so
well."</p>

<p>"Why, so am I; if I were in the place the Marquis de St. Rhue
will have!" He paused, then added simply: "There was a riot in
Limerick the other day, the men wanted to seize Tyrconnel and make
me commander-in-chief&mdash;I had but to speak the word."</p>

<p>"And you would not?"</p>

<p>"I would not."</p>

<p>"Out of loyalty to that old cowardly king who ran away?"</p>

<p>"Out of loyalty to loyalty, Honor." He smiled brilliantly.
"You'll understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it is hard. This new Frenchman will be difficult like
De Rosen and Lauzun?"</p>

<p>"I hope not. I must pray not; I mean to serve him zealously. I
have written to Louvois begging that he be sent with full
independance of Tyrconnel who, if he has the least authority, is
capable of spoiling the designs of the best captain in Europe."</p>

<p>"You know nothing of him?"</p>

<p>"Why, nothing. We never met in France. But I must ask him to
trust me, to be my friend. Do you think I can, Honor?"</p>

<p>"You can win any one whom you choose," replied his wife,
speaking truthfully; she leant back, heavy with lassitude; he
hardly heard what she said; his wide clear eyes were turned towards
the embers.</p>

<p>"If I had but some artillery, or more matchlocks&mdash;but those
miserable Turkish pieces mounted on cart wheels!"</p>

<p>A stronger gust blew the rain with a sharper violence against
the curtained pane; an opened door allowed a shriller burst of
merriment to be heard from Galway's guests...</p>

<p>"I must be gone," said Lord Lucan.</p>

<p>As he bent to kiss his wife she saw, twisted under the laces on
his wrist, a rough rosary of bog oak, with a plain crucifix such as
the peasants used attached...she was sure that one or both of these
pious objects had belonged to Ishma...</p>

<p>His lips were cool and firm on her cheek; his hair,
unfashionably buckled back, fell over his shoulder and brushed her
right hand...she wished him "good fortune," and when he had gone
she returned silently, without taking leave of any, to the old,
shadowed, Spanish house near the market-place.</p>

<p>Before Sarsfield rode back to Athlone he went quietly under the
rain which was shot by the beams of a rising moon, to the fishing
village of Cloddagh, for no reason save that he loved the place on
the noble bay of Galway, which stretched as far as the Isles of
Arran, loved the sullen, massive proud people, speaking their
ancient language, resenting the stranger; loved the haughty
solitude of this grand coast line "where you can hear no tongue but
the native tongue and can believe that Ireland belonged to the
Irish."</p>

<p>The strong mighty man sat his horse so sunk in musing that he
might have been a statue of one of the ancient heroes; the boom of
the surf was in his ears, he felt the salt on his lips, the wind
rushing by, the rain falling on his ungloved hands.</p>

<p>The intermittent moonlight flushed with silver the crests of the
waves and showed a glimpse of an horizon infinitely far away; the
man who watched and listened was snatched above mischance and, in a
sad rapture, content. Some of the fisherfolk, taking their nets
from the night boats, saw the magnificent horseman staring at the
sea, his red and gold dimmed in the moonlight, and crossed their
brows, thinking him one of the hidden folk made visible; they
thought the still horseman beautiful, audacious, formidable and
dominant; but when he turned away he bowed his head beneath the
burden of a dream.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-45" id="ch1-45"></a>FORTY-FIVE</h2>

<p class="first">
PATRICK SARSFIELD, Lord Lucan, guarding the passes of the
Shannon, became more and more obsessed with the thought of the
arrival of the Marquis de St. Rhue and the personality of the new
commander-in-chief of the forces in Ireland on whom, he felt, so
much of the success of this last campaign depended; during his
marches and countermarches, his brushes with Lanier, Kirke and
Douglas, he considered deeply in his heart the man who held the
post which he would have given half his life to have held; he
wondered if St. Rhue was as difficult as De Rosen or Lauzun; the
new general had a reputation for haughty courage and unbending
pride, for cruelty and sternness; he was one of King Louis's most
experienced generals, a man in the prime of life, for whom the most
brilliant future was predicted&mdash;but what did any one know of
him?</p>

<p>"If he should hate me," thought Lucan, "as De Rosen and Lauzun
hated me, then I and, I fear, the country are lost."</p>

<p>He resolved that he would do his utmost to conciliate, to bring
himself into the good graces and favour of this man, the new actor
on the crowded scene of Ireland who was to mean so much to her
future.</p>

<p>"I will do anything," he resolved. "I will put pride under foot,
I will serve him loyally, if he can but best the English there will
be no limit to what I will endure from him."</p>

<p>That Tyrconnel, nominally the Frenchman's superior, already
disliked him depressed Lucan's spirits, but he hoped to circumvent
the viceroy and to ingratiate himself by every means in his power
with the foreigner; it was not the first time that he had had to
coin his personality to gain his ends, to use all his charm, all
his gifts of persuasion, all the graces of his fine presence to win
some one who might be useful for Ireland...</p>

<p>He went so far as to endeavour to persuade Tyrconnel to give
"the Frenchman a free hand, to stand back and in every way flatter
him."</p>

<p>But the viceroy swore, with a gust of oaths, that he would see
"the blasted Frenchman up to his neck in a bog before he cringed to
him."</p>

<p>"Your grace warned me not to interfere with him."</p>

<p>"That's different. I'm the king's deputy. I'll not give an
inch."</p>

<p>"You'll be in a peck of troubles, sir, if the man is half as
arrogant as is reported. Good God! How can one govern a country
with these factions?"</p>

<p>Hast ever seen a country governed without, my lord? Wilt
<i>thou</i> stand down?"

<p>Tyrconnel smiled cunningly.</p>

<p>"Ay, I will&mdash;I'll lavish on him all the flatteries he needs, if
he'll get us together to beat the English&mdash;do you think I wish to
ferment broils? I'll stand down, never fear."</p>

<p>The viceroy, who seemed out of pure idleness or malice to wish
to raise a discord between Lucan and St. Rhue, added that the
Irishman "would not even be second-incommand, the Chevalier de
Tessé would have that position."</p>

<p>"I care nothing, I will do anything he bids. Why should we not
work together? He can have no cause in the world to dislike
me."</p>

<p>"He is a very overbearing, passionate man," said Tyrconnel, as
coolly as if those defects could never be laid to his own charge.
"The very swagger of him is enough to give an honest fellow the
bile."</p>

<p>"I'll endure it," smiled Lucan.</p>

<p>He was indeed prepared to put more labour and pains into gaining
St. Rhue than he had even put into winning a woman; he ingenuously
reminded himself that he had never found it difficult to get on
with his fellows of any nationality.</p>

<p>He did all in his power to make matters smooth for the coming of
the Frenchman, and watched Ginckel who surely, cautious as he was,
would with the first fine weather attack Ballymore. The spring was
late, as the last autumn had been early; the swamps and bogs,
marshes and overflows of the Shannon between Galway, Athlone and
Limerick were slow in drying; the winds and rains were keen and
violent, the first leaves on the bowed, swaying trees were drowned
or blasted as they appeared; the land heaved with the crawlings of
disease and misery as a corpse will heave with the writhing of
vermin.</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac, vowing she was weary of the bitter Atlantic
gales, came, dainty in a carriage above the befouled mud from
Galway to Athlone, from nothing she seemed able to create an
illusion of glory and beauty; she rode about Athlone on a white
jennet, a handkerchief dipped in vinegar at her nostrils.</p>

<p>She found, after many endeavours, occasion to speak to Lucan as
he came and went on his desperate affairs; she set the jennet
across his path as he rode with Colonel O'Hara and Toby O'Hogan
towards the gates.</p>

<p>Lucan reined up and gave her his wide stare, as if he had
forgotten her existence.</p>

<p>She broke at once into her business, as if she feared he would
ride past.</p>

<p>"The Marquis de St. Rhue will be here in a fortnight. I know him
very well."</p>

<p>Lucan paused, interested.</p>

<p>She looked up, cool, smiling; there was nothing about her of the
sorceress; she seemed able, when she wished, to obscure all that
was dangerous in her beauty.</p>

<p>There was no extravagance in her carriage, no flaunting in her
habit; yet in all she said and did was something ambiguous.</p>

<p>"Eh, well, madam," smiled Lucan, "tell me of St. Rhue."</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac's smooth complacency made it almost impossible
to believe (he thought) that she was the same woman who had so
passionately disclosed her utmost soul to him. Deftly and eagerly
the lady described the new commander-in-chief:</p>

<p>"At one time he was most intimate with my husband, they were
together at Saint Cyr...He is severe, haughty, a peer of France,
very brilliant..."</p>

<p>"He must be," said Lucan firmly, "my friend."</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac laughed; he wondered why she should laugh at
such a moment; perhaps, underneath her half-contemptuous calm her
nerves were giving way through the long strain of war and
intrigue...</p>

<p>"Is he a man," he continued, "who could, if he would, beat the
English? Though the Earl of Marlborough hath gone General Ginckel
is not contemptible."</p>

<p>"Yet, I think if he wished, St. Rhue could beat him." She smiled
as if she spoke to a child, promising him a toy. "How do you feel
in your new honours, my lord?" she asked. "You have deserved them
long since." She laughed again. "Do you remember the mansion of the
McCarthys? I did not know then that I was refusing an earl and a
fortune. We women are often fools."</p>

<p>"The fortune has gone," he reminded her. "I have nothing but my
soldier's pay. The Prince of Orange will put me on the roll of
outlawry. Lucan and all my demesne are in the enemy's hands."</p>

<p>"But if St. Rhue," simpered Madame de Bonnac, "were to beat them
you would have that and more returned to you." She added, swinging
a heart-shaped crystal, hard and brilliant, which hung about her
bosom, "I believe you are the kind of man who will never realise
how much a simpleton you have been."</p>

<p>"Will that matter?" asked Lucan.</p>

<p>He added, with maddening kindness, as if he feared her not at
all:</p>

<p>"Why do you stay in Ireland, madam? It becomes daily less fit
for a woman."</p>

<p>"Oh, I must be near my husband&mdash;my duty is there."</p>

<p>She glanced at him without meaning and went her way through the
filthy streets, very nice and dainty, her aromatics to her
nostrils.</p>

<p>Tyrconnel, with what pomp he could muster, went to meet St. Rhue
when he landed, after long delays by storms, early in May; Lucan
was not invited to accompany this expedition; he hastened to
Limerick where, like thunder heralding a storm, the fierce
complaints of the new commander-in-chief had preceded him; he had
objected to everything and already quarrelled with Tyrconnel.</p>

<p>Brigadier Luttrell, who had a few weeks ago unaccountably gone
to France, had returned with St. Rhue and, with his wicked habit of
being able to enjoy himself anywhere and at any one's expense, gave
an amusing account of the new general to Lucan.</p>

<p>"Faith, he has brought material for twenty thousand
mouse-coloured tunics for the Irish whom he has heard are miserably
naked. Oh, he hopes to see as fine an army, created out of your
cow-stealers, as ever paraded at Versailles."</p>

<p>"Your jest is sour," said Lucan; "the misery of the people is
beyond belief&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and help. Whose fault is that?"</p>

<p>"What else has St. Rhue brought&mdash;with his escort of thirty-five
ships?"</p>

<p>Luttrell replied that the French had brought arms, food,
brandy...</p>

<p>"We need them," replied Lucan simply. "Most of us are ragged and
starving. What of this man himself?"</p>

<p>"He is one of the best captains the French have&mdash;Rosen and
Lauzun are amateurs to him; the Marquis d'Usson and the Chevalier
de Tessé are good men. There are, too," added Luttrell maliciously,
"civilians sent to look after the money and stores&mdash;they think us a
lot of bedraggled thieves."</p>

<p>Lucan took no notice of Luttrell's wild talk; he made all
efforts to give the French a worthy reception in Limerick which
remained half-battered to ruins from the siege. He found that he
missed the presence of the young Duke of Berwick; austere, cold,
difficult to read as that youth was, at least there had been about
him, as there was about the Lady Honor, something steadfast and
trustworthy. Lucan felt that, as Berwick had himself said, he had
lost, if not a friend, at least an ally. But Berwick could not come
again to Ireland, his interest in the island had been but
transitory; after all, he had the whole of Europe out of which to
carve his errant fortune...</p>

<p>"I shall not meet him again," thought Lucan, "unless all is lost
and I, too, am forced to France."</p>

<p>The French commander-in-chief, embittered by long beating about
the dangerous Kerry coast in a troopship, had not hesitated
immediately to tell Tyrconnel to his face how disgraceful he
considered the state of everything; he had not accepted with
Lauzun's courtly indifference the condition of the roads, of the
troops sent to meet him, of the depots which he passed on his way.
He was reported, Lucan heard, to have said sharply to
Tyrconnel:</p>

<p>"I see, my lord duke, you have made no provision for this
campaign."</p>

<p>"It is for you, monseigneur," Tyrconnel had replied insolently,
"to make up for lost time."</p>

<p>The Frenchman had retorted without ceremony:</p>

<p>"I begin to perceive I have come to a country where time is not
considered a valuable commodity."</p>

<p>Burning with zeal and ardour, sick with anxiety to gain the
friendship or, at least, the trust of this important man, Lord
Lucan met St. Rhue after his formal entry into Limerick.</p>

<p>The Irishman was instantly impressed by the magnificence of the
figure who came forward (supported by his brilliant, insolent
staff) obviously a step or two before Tyrconnel, taking as his
right full precedence.</p>

<p>Charles Calmotte, Marquis de St. Rhue, was a man almost of
Lucan's own height and superb bearing; all the generals of the King
of France were chosen, not only for their useful qualities in the
field, but for grandeur and majesty in their deportment, and these
qualities Lieutenant-General the Marquis de St. Rhue possessed in
full; he was eminently fitted to shine on the parade ground or at
the head of troops. His breeding and training had all combined to
enhance his natural advantages; he was a fighting general, but had
served under the famous tactician, Catinat.</p>

<p>His sumptuous uniform, the gorgeous honours dazzling on his
breast, the excellence and precision of every detail all helped in
the magnificence of the effect he created; a critical eye might
have judged&mdash;"a figurehead, a coffee-house fop!" But there was a
pride of port, a haughtiness of gesture, an abruptness of speech
which could belong to no puppet courtier or man of fashion.</p>

<p>The Frenchman was in the flower of his days, about Lucan's own
age, with well-formed features, olive complexion, black hair and a
powerful glance. His whole expression was one not only of intense
arrogance, but of utter wilfulness; he made no attempt to disguise
his disdain for all who did not belong to the proud aristocratic
military caste of France. He had brought with him four valets, a
perruquier, a train of servants; he was shaved to the blood,
powdered, perfumed, curled, and Lucan, whose red coat, for all
Honor's care, showed signs of the ravages of the winter's fighting,
whose linen was plain, who had no jewelled orders, whose sword was
cheap, looked shabby beside him; but the Irishman, in his
ingenuous, zealous desire to please, took no thought of his
disadvantages.</p>

<p>But when formal salutations were exchanged Lucan was as startled
as confounded to observe that the new commander-in-chief regarded
him with what seemed a cold hostility.</p>

<p>"Now what can he have heard of me?" he thought, overwhelmed by
this new misfortune. "Can he dislike the mere look of me?" Abrupt
and cold as the Frenchman's manners were to all it was not possible
to mistake the extra edge of enmity with which he regarded
Lucan.</p>

<p>After the curtest greeting he began a complaint.</p>

<p>"I believe, my lord"&mdash;he spoke in careful English&mdash;"that you
have much influence with the Irish troops. How is it possible then
that they are not in a better condition?"</p>

<p>Lucan, for all his desire to please, could not bring himself to
instant flattery after this rebuke. He answered in French, his
fluency in that language appeared to annoy St. Rhue.</p>

<p>"I have had, monseigneur, to take the material at my hand. You
yourself will find you are obliged to summon to your standard men
you would no doubt consider as robbers and murderers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have already," put in Tyrconnel pompously, "issued a
proclamation directing all the rapparees in Connaught to join the
army without delay...And you, I fear,"&mdash;he addressed St.
Rhue&mdash;"will find it necessary to second me. You must also order the
men to drive with them all the cattle of private owners found on
the line of march to enable you to maintain your soldiers, for you
have not, I am sorry to see, brought with you sufficient provisions
to last even the first part of the campaign."</p>

<p>He smiled provokingly, ready for any quarrel, and St. Rhue's
expression said that he considered this mere insolence on the part
of the viceroy. He turned on his heel, and said with disgust:</p>

<p>"I have been informed that only six boats are available for the
work of conveying stores from Limerick to Athlone. Neither water
carriage nor land carriage is effective. Gentlemen"&mdash;he addressed
both Lucan and Tyrconnel&mdash;"do you realise that the delay in
forwarding supplies will prevent the Irish army taking the field
early? I have come here to act promptly, I have come here to end
the campaign and, if possible, the war. The English are already
gathering their forces on the other side of the Shannon, reviewing
troops, advancing on Ballymore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You tell me what I know, monseigneur," said Lucan civilly. "I
hoped that you had come to correct many of these disorders, and
that we might work together in amity."</p>

<p>The Marquis de St. Rhue stared at him without replying.</p>

<p>"Unless I am bewildered in my wits," said Lucan to himself, "it
is hate that I read in that man's eyes. Now, dear God in heaven,
what can be the cause?"</p>

<p>With his dashing and audacious impetuosity he longed to inquire
at once if there was any reason why the new commander-in-chief
should dislike him, but reminded himself of his resolution to win
this man&mdash;"and win him I will, however difficult he makes it."</p>

<p>The Frenchman had further complaints to put forward:</p>

<p>"The Irish troops were disgracefully equipped, the very officers
in rags, all the French money would go in mere doles to relieve
beggary; as for the condition of the country he had not believed
such a place could exist outside hell." He swung round on Tyrconnel
and broke out about the army lists supplied by the viceroy; there
were twelve thousand more on paper than in reality: "How did his
grace account for that?"</p>

<p>Tyrconnel was not perturbed; he was always ready to hold his own
in any dispute, and retorted boldly that he "had not allowed for
the four thousand men captured at Cork, and as for the others, they
had followed that double-damned rogue, Baldearg O'Donnell, who had
been sent by the devil from Spain and had slunk into the wilds of
Sligo with a swarm of rapparees at his heels, and who would obey
none, declaring himself to have a better right to be King of
Ireland than either the Stewart or the Dutchman."</p>

<p>"<i>Grand Dieu!</i>" cried St. Rhue furiously; "is this what I
am to contend with?"</p>

<p>"And worse," said Tyrconnel smoothly. "But, surely, all our
difficulties will disappear now we have a fine, clever, bold man
like yourself to lead us."</p>

<p>Lucan, anxious to placate, put in some more sober account of the
state of affairs; he mentioned what had been done during the winter
in defending the passes of the Shannon, in harrying the enemy; two
thousand cavalry were mounted on horses taken in these raids&mdash;</p>

<p>St. Rhue interrupted scornfully:</p>

<p>"These are the exploits of <i>banditti,</i> mere robbing and
slaying."</p>

<p>"Well," said Lucan good-humoredly, "where is the difference,
monseigneur, between your troops flogging and hanging the heretics
in the Cevennes, and my poor fellows killing them in
Connaught?"</p>

<p>"All the difference," replied St. Rhue, without humour. "One is
discipline, the other is not."</p>

<p>"You won't find," chuckled Tyrconnel, "that discipline goes down
very well in Ireland."</p>

<p>St. Rhue flared out on him.</p>

<p>"<i>Grand Dieu!</i> what I say goes down&mdash;if it needs a ramrod
behind it; learn that first and last, my lord duke."</p>

<p>The viceroy purpled as if on the verge of a seizure, but Lucan
adroitly stepped before him, forcing the Frenchman's attention on
himself.</p>

<p>"We are prepared to make any sacrifice," he said gravely. "I
have done what I could&mdash;a better man had done better; we are in
your hands entirely. No pretensions, no factions that I can prevent
(and I have some influence) shall vex you, monseigneur; command me
in all." This generous candour did not disarm the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Oh, you," he muttered, and glanced back over his heavy gold
epaulette at his staff as if he invited a scornful survey of the
Irishman; "a leader of bog trotters!"</p>

<p>The insolence was too stressed to be overlooked; a faint colour
overspread Luck's pale features, he replied steadily:</p>

<p>"Yes, I, Patrick Sarsfield of Lucan, Earl and Lieutenant-General
in His Britannic Majesty's army, I know a little of soldiering&mdash;I
also was at St. Cyr. I have served under Luxembourg. I know a great
deal of Ireland, my help is not to be despised, General the Marquis
de St. Rhue."</p>

<p>The Frenchman made a violent effort to control himself;
conscious that he had gone too far, he tried to speak more civilly;
but there could be no mistaking the hatred in his narrow dark
eyes.</p>

<p>"And why?" thought the Irishman in misery. "Why?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-46" id="ch1-46"></a>FORTY-SIX</h2>

<p class="first">
GENERAL THE MARQUIS DE ST. RHUE set himself vigorously to make
the best of what he considered the atrocious materials at his
command. It was a dreadful spring; the French squadron under the
Chevalier de Nesmond had to ride in the mouth of the Shannon
waiting for the gales to cease. All efforts were concentrated on
the river line, which was bridged only at the French headquarters
at Limerick, at Athlone and Ballagher.</p>

<p>General Ginckel proceeded with infinite precaution towards
Ballymore; he had, to Lucan's chagrin, discovered the importance of
that place, and it would be impossible to spare men to defend
it.</p>

<p>Lucan had relinquished his command of the Shannon passes and his
governorship of Connaught without complaint; he received neither
reward nor gratitude for his winter's strenuous work, and was
coldly subordinated not only to St. Rhue but to De Tessé.</p>

<p>His relations with the commander-in-chief were his principal
interest; he was puzzled, amazed, disheartened by the Frenchman's
active enmity, but he was too single-hearted to be angry; he
watched and waited, doing all he could to forward the opening of
the campaign, already late.</p>

<p>St. Rhue did not have all his own way; on every possible point
Tyrconnel opposed him; he was, compared with St. Rhue (St. Ruth to
the Irish and English) no soldier, but he had his rights, his
dignities and opinions, and stuck to all with a stoutness that
Lucan, much as he disliked him, secretly admired.</p>

<p>This inflamed St. Rhue almost to madness, but his control was
admirable, and he was a fine routine worker, superbly trained,
experienced, active, laborious and careful; he therefore absorbed
himself in his task.</p>

<p>He found that the infantry which he reviewed twenty thousand
strong, were in no such ill-condition as he had feared, and he was
diligent in providing them with gray tunics, and the white Bourbon
cockade.</p>

<p>The lack of horses was bitter to him, and he sharply rebuked
Lucan for allowing "animals to perish of neglect during the
winter."</p>

<p>"Many human beings perished the same way, sir."</p>

<p>St. Rhue sneered; he remarked, "A lot of useless people have
been kept needlessly alive." He showed Lucan a report from the
Marquis d'Usson, who had reviewed fifteen battalions at
Killaloe&mdash;"Their discipline was poor and the lack of arms at least
a hundred a battalion."</p>

<p>"Ginckel," said Lucan, steadily refusing to take offence, "has
also to deal with rough, untrained recruits; his infantry is
inferior to ours."</p>

<p>"But his cavalry is four times as strong, and he has a very good
artillery."</p>

<p>"We must do what we can, monseigneur, and avoid cabals which
break out fresh every day."</p>

<p>St. Rhue did not reply to that; he came out with another furious
comment on the Irish; the regiments complained about wearing the
mouse-coloured tunics and white cockades.</p>

<p>"<i>Grand Dieu!</i> it is a lunatic people! There was the same
trouble with Mountcashel's Brigade in Savoy, the Irish wanted red
coats and a flag with St. George's Cross and the Lion&mdash;do they want
to fight under the standard of their oppressors, the English?"</p>

<p>Lucan winced.</p>

<p>"'Tis pitiful, these poor Irish&mdash;" He caught himself up,
identified himself proudly with the despised, the conquered. "We, I
should say, have no flag of our own. These men think the English
standard is theirs." Erect before the Frenchman's sneer, he added:
"One should respect so much misery."</p>

<p>St. Rhue did not answer, but stared as if he had forgotten what
was being spoken of; his lustrous southern eyes were slumbrous with
dark thoughts as he gazed at Lucan as if he would read his secret
heart.</p>

<p>Lucan, quick, fine, subtle, thought:</p>

<p>"He is not happy, he has some private anguish, there is more
than Tyrconnel, more than the war tormenting him, but why this
hatred of me?"</p>

<p>For Lucan could not doubt hatred when he saw it any more than he
could doubt love.</p>

<p>St. Rhue recovered himself and looked away.</p>

<p>"We must rally yet some more horses."</p>

<p>Lucan brought himself to ask Tyrconnel what inner fury "beyond
loathing of us all" was driving the commander-in-chief?</p>

<p>The viceroy said that St. Rhue, a very passionate man, bold and
extravagant in his amours, was probably tormented by some woman&mdash;"a
mistress who would not follow him here, or some creature dead or
lost."</p>

<p>Lucan thought of Ishma, and for the first time could feel some
sympathy for the Frenchman; but day by day he saw himself deprived
of all effective power and this, though many an Irish officer had
gone to St. Rhue and said to the brilliant Frenchman's face:</p>

<p>"I care nothing for the King of France nor for the King of
England, I obey Patrick Sarsfield. If he were to tell me to cut the
throat of any man in the army I would do it&mdash;"</p>

<p>No one could tell Lucan why St. Rhue should have this particular
dislike to him; all agreed he was a man who would ill brook any
manner of interference, most said that he was probably jealous of
Lucan's prestige and influence. But Brigadier Henry Luttrell
remarked casually: "There is a good reason why the Marquis de St.
Rhue does not like you and will not trust you, but I doubt if you
will ever know what it is."</p>

<p>Lucan was inclined to take this as mere impertinence; yet he had
a secret dread of Luttrell, a growing mistrust, a deepening
suspicion of his goodwill, his good faith. As far as he knew
Luttrell had never harmed him, never thwarted or intrigued against
him, though he had not been in his confidence since he had refused
to accede to Luttrell's desire to make of him a puppet rebel.</p>

<p>But he sometimes remembered those threats in Madame de Bonnac's
Dublin house and, though he was himself utterly fearless, yet he
would then feel a startled dread that in some way Luttrell was his
enemy and would interfere in his work for Ireland.</p>

<p>However Lucan might burn under the evidences of the new
commander-in-chief's antagonism, he saw that the Frenchman
continued both courageous and active; he did his best to repair the
faults of Tyrconnel's administration though it was obvious that,
imperious as he was, he suffered bitterly from the advice,
suggestions and even orders of the viceroy.</p>

<p>Lucan eagerly seconded him. He thought: "What does it matter if
he hates me or I hate him, this campaign is Ireland's last
stand."</p>

<p>St. Rhue, haughty and stern as he was, neither giving nor asking
a confidence, was not beloved by the Irish (whom he hung by the
dozen for light offences,) although he was supposed to have been
popular with the exiles in France.</p>

<p>By early June there was no doubt that General Ginckel intended
to assault Athlone; St. Rhue laughed at the Dutchman's insolent
presumption, and made his final preparations to take the field.</p>

<p>His dislike of Lucan and his unswerving intention of setting
that officer down on every occasion could no longer be overlooked
by any; even his constant quarrels with Tyrconnel had not the
deadly spite of his constant slightings of Lucan.</p>

<p>"You say you know," Lucan demanded in despair of Luttrell. "Tell
me then, whatever it is, it must be set right." Luttrell smiled,
squinted and laughed the matter off. "No one will tell you, my dear
Lucan," he declared. But the Irishman swore to himself that he
would know if he had to challenge St. Rhue to his face.</p>

<p>General Ginckel was in the field first; regarding Ballymore as
lost, St. Rhue proceeded to protect Athlone. Since his arrival in
Ireland he had worked hard and got his men into some semblance of
the armies he was used to command, but he was intensely galled by
lack of artillery and horses, and seemed consumed by some hidden
grief or rage which could only be assuaged by fierce action; nor
was his humour improved by the viceroy's determination to accompany
the army and even to assume the airs of commander-in-chief; the
affair had a laughable side.</p>

<p>"But their comedy," thought Sarsfield sadly, "is Ireland's
tragedy."</p>

<p>The French commander marched with twenty thousand foot and five
thousand horse from Loughrea towards Athlone, and encamped at
Ballinasloe on the River Suck.</p>

<p>He had hardly got his men under canvas before he heard that
Ballymore (which was defended by about a thousand men under Colonel
Alec Bourke) had surrendered, and was already fortified and
garrisoned by Ginckel.</p>

<p>Lord Lucan, burning for action, did all in his power to bring
himself to the favourable notice of the commander-in-chief; he was
wrought to a pitch of anxious expectancy which was almost
unendurable; the full extent of the miseries of his most wretched
country was daily under his eyes.</p>

<p>St. Rhue had left behind on the banks of the Shannon all the old
men, women and children who had gathered in the protecting wake of
the army; all through the winter the Irish had sent all their
people useless for war over to the English side of the Shannon, to
live or die as best they could; Ginckel could not feed this
multitude and had endeavoured to drive them back. Lucan heard daily
reports from the rapparees of how these wretches, crazed with
hunger, were still crowding round Ginckel's camp devouring the
refuse thrown away by the soldiers, "falling on dead horses,
crawling with vermin as the sun parched them, while the infants
sucked those carcases with as much eagerness as if they were their
mothers' breasts."</p>

<p>As the hideous June suddenly burned into great heat, Ginckel
crept steadily onwards till his outposts neared the Suck. Lucan
found himself still ignored, frustrated, set down at every turn. As
the time for action neared, the Irishman, overborne by sorrow, went
to St. Rhue, and asked him: "What cause for offence he had found in
him that he so refused to take advantage of his experience and his
services?"</p>

<p>St. Rhue stared; his English was limited to a few sentences.
Lucan continued in French:</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of me, monseigneur, because I am too popular
with the Irish? Believe me, I have refused many insidious rogues
who would set me up as a rebel against His Majesty. I have no
thought but loyally to fulfil my commission."</p>

<p>Saint Rhue looked at him steadily, and replied:</p>

<p>"It would have a better effect, my lord, if you were to wear the
uniform of the King of France, you would easily get a
commission."</p>

<p>Lucan wore the scarlet of the English guards. He heard in this
remark a direct insult, but he replied quietly:</p>

<p>"I serve not the King of France, but the King of England."</p>

<p>"Well, serve him," said St. Rhue, "I put nothing in your
way."</p>

<p>"You give me no help," cried Lucan passionately. "Do you not
understand what this campaign is to me?"</p>

<p>The Frenchman replied with increasing coldness:</p>

<p>"It is something also to me. My reputation stands on it. You do
not think that I wish to return to Versailles as Lauzun
returned&mdash;recalled, disgraced? Believe me, I can beat General
Ginckel and without your assistance or that of any Irishman."</p>

<p>Ignoring Lucan's appeal he began to break out against Tyrconnel,
who had had the impertinence to pitch his tent in the encampment,
to thrust his presence on the army councils, to give advice to him,
St. Rhue.</p>

<p>The commander-in-chief spoke with the hard arrogance of the
efficient, he knew his business completely, which was more (he was
sure) than could be said of any Irishman; but Lucan took the part
of the viceroy, much as he was forced to mistrust him; he knew that
the opportunist is often right.</p>

<p>"Tyrconnel," he said as suavely as possible, "is right about the
entrenchment on the south of Athlone, that should be levelled."</p>

<p>"Tyrconnel is right about nothing, Lord Lucan."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, he hath a large following and I hope you won't push
matters to a pinch with him&mdash;we are promised a decisive action, and
'tis the last moment for a divided camp."</p>

<p>"The Duke of Tyrconnel must return to Limerick," insisted St.
Rhue, with a face of adamant. "I thought you were his opponent, now
you speak for him, how can I trust any of you?"</p>

<p>Lucan was silent in sheer despair; he felt that the hard,
pragmatical Frenchman would never believe any one save one so dull
as to be incapable of any invention; what was presented to him with
any subtlety, or fire, or imagination he utterly discredited; he
could no more understand the Irish temperament than he could speak
their language, and what he could not understand he utterly ruled
out from the scheme of the universe.</p>

<p>He stiffly waited for Lucan to take his leave but the Irishman,
struggling with himself to maintain calm and civility, tried to put
forward the viceroy's side of the matter.</p>

<p>"Even if I am against him I can see his point of view&mdash;you can't
humiliate the man before the whole camp, and he is right about the
entrenchment, is the King's Deputy, after all, and he has local
knowledge and speaks English at least. You, monseigneur, must
depend on some one for these points."</p>

<p>"Brigadier Luttrell has been useful to me on such matters,"
conceded St. Rhue impatiently.</p>

<p>"And he is the last man to be relied on!" exclaimed Lucan, who
had noticed with deep vexation that Luttrell, with his insinuating
manners and graceful flatteries, had worked himself into the good
favours of even St. Rhue&mdash;was there any, man or woman, Luttrell
could not charm?</p>

<p>Lucan rose; he felt it useless to say more; he looked with
distaste round the over rich pavilion hung with tapestry, lit by
crystal lamps, furnished with elegance, at the bureau scattered
with objects in onyx and agate, silver and ivory, at Saint Rhue
himself in his extravagant uniform with the diamonds of the Saint
Esprit star sparkling insolently on his breast. Then his glance met
that of the Frenchman and again he saw hatred, lively and
audacious, in those narrowed dark eyes, unmistakable defiance in
the precise lines of the sensual mouth and slightly heavy jaw.</p>

<p>"I have sent a formal message to the Duke of Tyrconnel," said
St. Rhue, "that unless he leaves the camp by to-morrow morning the
cords of his tent will be cut."</p>

<p>Lucan, with the briefest salutation, left the pavilion; his
despondence almost overwhelmed him; impossible to deal with this
man from whom he had hoped so much, who must mean everything to
Ireland; impossible to fathom this steady hostility, this deep
hatred that could have no basis. He stood among the tents thinking
of his winter's work, gone for nothing; of the valiant defence of
Limerick, gone for nothing; of the thousands of poor Irish who had
died in torment during the last few months&mdash;all for nothing. Like a
rift in the mists of a foul miasma there came to him suddenly a
picture of the may trees at Lucan and the holy well with Ishma, so
gay and gentle, seated there...</p>

<p>That was gone too; in the darkness, scattered by starlight and
the lanterns and flares of the camp, Lucan stood motionless, his
hand to his side.</p>

<p>Who had his estates? In the eyes of the conqueror he was an
outlaw; there would be a heretic priest in the little chapel, the
hawthorns felled perhaps, the well-head and cross demolished as
relics of popery. The utter bitterness of the dispossessed
penetrated his soul; he sighed and made his way to the tent of
Tyrconnel which stood on the confines of the village of
Ballinasloe.</p>

<p>He urged his flagging spirits as a man may urge a weary horse
and entered the presence of the viceroy. At all costs these two,
Tyrconnel and St. Rhue, must not quarrel.</p>

<p>He found the viceroy and his retinue preparing to leave.
Tyrconnel was in one of his grand, stately moods and welcomed Lucan
as a friend; he had received St. Rhue's message...</p>

<p>"Look ye, Lucan, if I would I could best him, I have the larger
following in the camp, but I don't want a division now."</p>

<p>"I commend your grace's self-restraint!" cried Lucan, gay with
relief. "'Tis the better man gives way in an affair of this
sort."</p>

<p>"I know; St. Rhue is a fool, ay, under all his bravado, a fool.
He can see but one aspect of a case and that the wrong one." A
crisp flow of invective further expressed the viceroy's opinion of
St. Rhue; but he comported himself with dignity, corpulent as he
was, his crimson face veined with purple, his eyes sunk and
blurred, his hands shaking, he had more serenity than the Frenchman
who was in a tumult behind his forced control.</p>

<p>"I am no soldier, they say, but I am no skulker either. I don't
want to stay behind the lines when there is a fight on, but dealing
with a fool like that! A leaden brain! Well, I'll be
reasonable."</p>

<p>He swallowed a cup of apricot brandy; he looked ten years older
than on the night before. Lucan warmly praised his resolution.</p>

<p>Tyrconnel' smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, you never believed in me, but we are both Irish, I
suppose. I do something for Ireland to-night&mdash;cut the cords of my
tent, would ye, ye rascal with a brow of brass? I'd like to twist
his stiff neck for him and could too, though he is twenty years
younger. But, enough of this tragical bickering&mdash;" He broke out
again: "So rude, so ungenteel! But I'll be patient."</p>

<p>"We all must be, sir. St. Rhue treats me with the highest
insolence. I feel like a horse bloody from a pulled bit, ready to
start at a shadow; he has me so vexed and stung and I have been
mighty civil to him. But you, sir," added Lucan, with sudden
humour, "have, it must be confessed, done your best to exasperate
him from the first."</p>

<p>"Thank God for that!" cried the viceroy, "since this is to be
the end on't."</p>

<p>The two Irishmen laughed, and Tyrconnel added:</p>

<p>"Once this battle is over I'll give the brazen rogue such
trouble that he'll cut his own throat in a fury, 'tis a creature of
no stability and mad with vanity."</p>

<p>Tyrconnel paused and watched his tent being dismantled; a
sadness overspread his purpling face. Lucan felt for him&mdash;"an old,
brave man and humiliated."</p>

<p>"I did my best for Ireland," added the viceroy, "and for King
James. I always stood his friend. I may have jumped with times and
parties, but I've been staunch and I believe in Ireland."</p>

<p>"Do you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Ay, even now. I took the liberty of writing to His Majesty and
saying he ought to pawn the shirt off his back to help Ireland at
this juncture."</p>

<p>"But he has nothing," smiled Lucan; "even his shirt belongs to
King Louis."</p>

<p>Tyrconnel strode into the open and mounted his great
square-looking horse. The tent was struck, the viceroy flung on his
hat which was adorned with costly, streaming feathers; he leaned
down towards Lucan.</p>

<p>"As for that damned gray cloth our fellows won't wear, it has
been rotting for years in French warehouses, and no one knowing
what to do with it&mdash;tell him so if he throws it up at you!"</p>

<p>"This is a farcical comedy," smiled Lucan bitterly. He watched
the viceroy and his suite ride along the Limerick road, and was
returning wearily through the encampment when a man silent as a
shadow was by his side.</p>

<p>"Toby O'Hogan, my lord."</p>

<p>"Come into my pavilion, Mr. O'Hogan."</p>

<p>"No, I will not," replied the rapparee; "and they discrediting
you for keeping company with cow-stealers. And the news I have is
said in a word or so."</p>

<p>"News?" Lucan stood at pause.</p>

<p>"A man of mine, now beyond Aughrim, sends to say he has seen a
dwarf woman among the poor people of Loughrea&mdash;a large dwarf, he
said, but she slipped away, and there are many such. But I am
having her tracked. That is all."</p>

<p>"Quite all, Mr. O'Hogan?"</p>

<p>"Nothing else. And not for lack of searching."</p>

<p>"I know." Lucan closed his eyes. "I feel she is safe. 'Tis an
article of faith with me. Snatched from it all, Mr. O'Hogan, in
some isle or mountain where there is still peace&mdash;she'll be
there."</p>

<p>"And not sending you a word of comfort?" asked the rapparee
simply.</p>

<p>"She would have forgotten all the world. She was like that."</p>

<p>"More a spirit," said Mr. O'Hogan gravely, "than a woman. A maid
from the hidden people, maybe, I've heard tell of them. And she
would go away in silence."</p>

<p>"Yes, she would do that."</p>

<p>"I'll bring you more news if I get it&mdash;this is nothing, just a
dwarf woman seen beyond Aughrim."</p>

<p>The rapparee slipped away among the tents; Lucan thought
stupidly:</p>

<p>"Were I in St. Rhue's place and O'Hogan my second, we'd beat the
Dutchman as flat as a plate."</p>

<p>He came to his own tent to be told that a French officer waited
to see him. Thinking at once of some further insults from St. Rhue,
Lucan swung into the presence of his visitor.</p>

<p>It was the Marquis de Bonnac who faced him, who smiled, and
said:</p>

<p>"I come on my own business."</p>

<p>Lucan had forgotten his existence.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-47" id="ch1-47"></a>FORTY-SEVEN</h2>

<p class="first">
LORD LUCAN, dishevelled and wide eyed, with a wild look about
him, stared at the neat Frenchman who greeted him as if their
meeting was the most ordinary event in the world; but Lucan had not
seen the man for months nor thought of him all the winter.</p>

<p>"I should like half an hour of your time," said M. de Bonnac. "I
fear, sir, I a little amaze you&mdash;being scarcely of your
acquaintance and coming on you thus suddenly. In the midst of
important affairs, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Sir, you must forgive me, I have been with the viceroy&mdash;my
thoughts were scattered&mdash;and with St. Rhue&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He does not love you&mdash;<i>cet animal la?"</i></p>

<p>"All the world knows that," replied Lucan; he wondered if De
Bonnac was the secret agent of some intriguer; he sighed and seated
himself heavily. A man of action and of a candid, impulsive nature,
he was totally unfitted for politics and loathed plots; a deadly
weariness oppressed him.</p>

<p>But the Frenchman, perceiving his discomfort, said
courteously:</p>

<p>"I am not here either to discuss politics&mdash;eh, <i>grand
Dieu,</i> how childish&mdash;nor the war&mdash;how tedious is war! I,
monseigneur, I am a philosopher."</p>

<p>Lucan trimmed a cheap lamp that lit an untidy tent, then leant
back on his hard seat. He wished the Frenchman would come quickly
to the point; there was a letter to Honor in Galway that should
have gone to-night...</p>

<p>"I have come to speak," said M. de Bonnac, "of the marquise&mdash;of
my wife."</p>

<p>The other man did not reply.</p>

<p>"She is at present lodged in Ballinasloe," continued the
Frenchman. "Do you think you know her very well?"</p>

<p>"Olivia? No, I do not."</p>

<p>"Olivia? Eh, an impossible word for us. We use her second
name&mdash;Solange. I wish to tell you something about her."</p>

<p>"You think that it has anything to do with me?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;a little. Remember always I am a philosopher. I am
sorry if I fatigue you, you look weary."</p>

<p>Lucan glanced into the Frenchman's haggard, cool face; he had
honest, hazel eyes, a sensitive mouth. Lucan had always liked
him&mdash;despite Olivia's tales.</p>

<p>"You do not fatigue me. And I am always a little weary."</p>

<p>"I heard of you, my Lord Lucan, some years ago&mdash;a penniless
younger son who was no <i>parti</i> for Olivia Joyce. I was a fool
myself in those days. I thought it was glorious to possess a
beautiful woman. I thought that to marry Solange would be to
possess her&mdash;she is beautiful, is she not?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;very beautiful," said Lucan. He folded his arms on his
breast and watched the other man keenly.</p>

<p>M. de Bonnac continued, in a musing manner:</p>

<p>"She will not be beautiful when she is dead&mdash;without colour and
her hair in a napkin. Some women are lovely in death. But Solange,
no! But alive one does not notice her defects. Of course she
despised me from the first. And from the first was unfaithful. Did
you suspect that?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Ah, I thought you did not. You are not exactly a simpleton, but
you are apt to think that every well-behaved woman is chaste. You
could have had her&mdash;any time."</p>

<p>"Eh, monseigneur&mdash;this is of a revolting frankness!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry. I came here to be plain and always admired you.
Potiphar must have had some regard for Joseph, do you not
think?"</p>

<p>"If you imagine I played that ridiculous part&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know it. <i>Not</i> ridiculous&mdash;it simply never occurred to
you to behave otherwise. I have studied your nation. It really
amused me to see her vain devices and I respected you. Not that it
would have mattered among so many&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You speak very lightly of your own&mdash;misfortune, monseigneur,"
remarked Lucan sternly.</p>

<p>"Shame, disgrace perhaps you mean? Eh, <i>bien,</i> I am not one
of those who think one can be dishonoured by the actions of
another. I am quite detached from it all. I study Mons. Des Cartes
and collect curiosities." The Frenchman smiled with dry pride.
"This light woman is really nothing to me."</p>

<p>"I had not so thought of her&mdash;even now it seems
impossible&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To no one but yourself. She takes so little trouble to conceal
anything. Henry Luttrell, Galmoy, others." M. de Bonnac's cold
voice was suddenly edged with hate. "A harlot."</p>

<p>"My God! Why need I know it?"</p>

<p>"It hurts, I am sure. You made an idol of her for years&mdash;you
never satisfied more than your senses with other women&mdash;she was
always the chaste unattainable&mdash;and you could have had her by a
whistle."</p>

<p>Lucan spoke with an effort; there was an ugly weight on his
heart.</p>

<p>"But at least&mdash;all is past, now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not yet. I must be just to Solange&mdash;she has for you an
unappeasable passion, I almost think that, could she snare you she
would let the others go and be faithful&mdash;for a while, at least. She
has suffered a good deal this winter, poor Solange."</p>

<p>Lucan felt a sick bewilderment as he realised that this quiet,
drab man, unnoticed by any, had been observing him so closely, so
keenly for so long; studying his character, remarking his actions;
he could not speak.</p>

<p>"Do you recall, my Lord Lucan, when I asked you&mdash;when I sent my
friend to advise you&mdash;to take that young gentlewoman from our
house?"</p>

<p>Lucan turned away his face.</p>

<p>"Now you will understand why."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>M. de Bonnac continued to speak of his wife; his discourse was
discursive; he could not, he said, put all he had to say into a few
words. With a cool, keen irony he sketched the character and career
of Olivia; for ten years he had been narrowly observing her without
illusion or pity; he showed her stripped of every grace.</p>

<p>"You are not listening, monseigneur? You look as if your mind
was far away."</p>

<p>"To give you candour for candour, M. de Bonnac, the affairs of
this lady have long been indifferent to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what infuriates her so. But I have something to
tell you about her to which you will not be indifferent. Though
most of her lovers have soon tired of her, there is one man whom
she holds as if in a spell. He desires her to madness. And she
knows how to shrewdly torment him." M. de Bonnac rose. "I must tell
you," he added very dryly, "that Solange has some excuse&mdash;I bruised
my side slipping from my saddle years ago and I have an imposthume
there&mdash;a sick, a suffering man, always in pain, eh? One could not
tolerate that, unless there was some kindness and affection&mdash;and
there never was any&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucan rose also; he faintly reddened; Olivia had certainly lied
about this man.</p>

<p>"The little <i>abbé</i> is my doctor&mdash;that is why we are always
together&mdash;he keeps me just able to get through my duties. That
young demoiselle, now, she is safe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure she is safe." Lucan did not know that he
lied.</p>

<p>"I am glad. A fair creature, I thought. I admire Ireland. The
<i>abbé</i> makes me little sketches. One amuses oneself somehow
and what does any of it matter? All will soon be over."</p>

<p>"You had some purpose in seeking me out?"</p>

<p>M. de Bonnac looked up shrewdly, with kindly indulgence, at the
tall Irishman.</p>

<p>"Yes, I wanted to help you&mdash;to tell you the source of all your
troubles&mdash;your difficulties&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know it?"</p>

<p>"I do. St. Rhue is Solange's infatuate lover, and she has
persuaded him that you are his favoured rival. He is really a fool
and a cunning woman can do anything with him."</p>

<p>M. de Bonnac was gone softly, with a philosophic air.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-48" id="ch1-48"></a>FORTY-EIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">
LORD LUCAN sat alone in his tent, his head in his hands; all was
combining against him, like the moves on a chessboard all leading
to the final "check!" He understood with the fullest sense of
dismay the appalling situation in which he found himself...</p>

<p>So St. Rhue was the lover of Olivia de Bonnac; Lucan could
understand.</p>

<p>It mattered nothing at all to him whom she loved; he was sorry
for her husband, that dry, austere, unattractive man. Not any
passion, however idyllic, he might once have felt for her, not any
restraint of honour or of decorum would prevent him from setting
right this grotesque mistake. He would refuse to be enmeshed in
intrigues with this dangerous woman as before he had refused to be
ensnared by Henry Luttrell; St. Rhue's mad jealousies should be
eased. With every half-hour that passed he heard how opportunities,
instead of going to him, had been given to others. It was
abundantly clear that he was to be set down and overlooked while
the incompetent, perhaps the treacherous, were to hold the fortunes
of Ireland in their hands...</p>

<p>Tyrconnel was not to be trusted, St. Rhue hated him, every
officer in the army seemed to have more influence, more power, more
scope than himself. Yet, he had but to lift his finger and every
Irishman in Ballinasloe would follow him...</p>

<p>Yes, almost better to do what that rogue adventurer, O'Donnell
had done, set up for oneself in some inaccessible bog with a crowd
of rapparees than be the puppet&mdash;the fool&mdash;of these
foreigners&mdash;Olivia and St. Rhue&mdash;she and her lies, Ireland's last
chance to go for that! Through his fatigued, yet excited mind,
fevered with this fresh mischance, spun intermingled visions;
spectres of himself kissing Olivia in the old mansions of the
MacCarthys with the willows and the rainbow without&mdash;talking with
the old priest on the Isle of Lough Erne&mdash;burying the dog under the
cross, casting <i>her</i> garments into the undefiled water, riding
over the field of Clontarf&mdash;and tossing in his red coat in the
moonlit surf under the rock of Howth...</p>

<p>He endured a brief night of anguish, then in the fresh blue
daylight went to the house in Ballinasloe where Madame de Bonnac
lodged. He was resolved to see her, if it meant forcing aside her
domestics. But she received him immediately, came down easily and
lightly into the humble room, in her dress of mulberry and
amber-coloured silk, silver ribbons at her breast. She stepped to
the window, careless of the pure azure light, and played with the
roses that touched the sill, looking at him aside; she appeared to
have been expecting him, she appeared&mdash;and this perversity further
angered him&mdash;pleased at his quiet wrath.</p>

<p>Her prominent eyes seemed to flash mockingly: "So I have at last
roused you, so I have at last made you take some notice of me."</p>

<p>"I perceive," she remarked coldly, "by your looks, Lord Lucan,
that this visit is not on a matter of love."</p>

<p>As Lucan answered his agony overcame his wrath:</p>

<p>"I fear that you hate me and have set about me to pull me down.
Ay, madam, I fear more than that, I fear that you have accomplished
your design."</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac waited for him to disclose himself, giving him
no help whatever; she stood still, was neat and sumptuous, playing
with the flowers. When he saw her well-nourished, well-cherished
beauty, so carefully guarded, so exquisitely adorned, and thought
of the hideous corpses, the starving refugees who made foul the
banks of the Shannon, he loathed her. She seemed to him like a
bright poison, a gorgeous fruit gaily glossed but ashes within.</p>

<p>"Women like you," he said sternly, "should keep away from the
seat of war. Only those who know how to suffer have the right to be
here."</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac, never lacking in rapartee, said: "And have you
come to make me suffer, Lord Lucan?"</p>

<p>"I do not know if that is possible," he replied. "I have come to
ask you if it is true that between you and the new
commander-in-chief there is some intrigue?"</p>

<p>"Put your matter more plainly," she said, contemptuous of the
courtesy which he maintained even in his pain. "You have come to
ask me if I have been Saint Rhue's mistress. I wondered," she added
insolently, "how long you would be in finding it out, and I wonder
who told you at the last."</p>

<p>"That is no matter," replied Lucan. "I can judge by your hard
words and your look of indifference, madam, you will not deny the
charge which you have made against yourself. You and this man have
been, perhaps are, lovers."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she replied; "he is very brilliant, and there have
been many women"&mdash;and she plucked a rose&mdash;"at Versailles who would
have done much for his good graces."</p>

<p>"That concerns me not at all, nor your relations with this
gentleman. What I have come here to know"&mdash;and he spoke striving
with an overwhelming passion&mdash;"is, have you told Saint Rhue that I
am his favoured rival? Is that the cause of his enmity which he
scarcely takes the trouble to disguise, is it the cause why I, at
this crisis of my fortunes and the fortunes of Ireland, am cast
aside as useless?"</p>

<p>"It may be," she said again, with provoking insolence.</p>

<p>"I told you, and I think it was some while ago, that in me you
had an enemy, or," she added indifferently, "perhaps it was
Brigadier Luttrell who told you."</p>

<p>"Luttrell has played the fool and havoc with Ireland," cried
Lucan; "and I believe with me! But let him go&mdash;deal with me&mdash;with
me, I say!"</p>

<p>She turned, eagerly, as if she welcomed his wrath; never before
had she seen him openly angry.</p>

<p>He asked her directly and with a brutality of which he had not
believed himself capable "Have you told St. Rhue that you are my
mistress, either to inflame his passion or to injure me?"</p>

<p>"No woman would answer such a question."</p>

<p>"No woman such as you, perhaps," he said, in sudden despair; "I
waste my time in coming to you, I might have known."</p>

<p>He turned away so directly that she could see at once, adroit
and shrewd as she was, that he had some keen purpose in his mind;
she became a little alarmed and strove to detain him.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do? How do you mean to find out?" she
exclaimed. And added fiercely: "I believe it was my miserable
husband told you, it is not the first time that he has behaved thus
dishonourably to me."</p>

<p>Lucan could not answer that. He opened the door and she flung
herself upon him&mdash;perfume, satin, flowing hair and sparkling eyes,
yet in everything loathsome to his senses.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will tell you if you will wait a little, perhaps I
will let you know everything, if you would give me something of
your company," she implored in warm, soft accents.</p>

<p>"I desire nothing of you, madam. You often have reminded me I am
a fool, and in nothing a greater fool than this, that I came to you
now. I will go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>And he, to be rid of her, said:</p>

<p>"To the commander-in-chief himself and to tell him, whatever
your lies, I am not his rival."</p>

<p>She seemed startled even through her insolent effrontery.</p>

<p>"Can a man do such a thing?" she demanded; she had always relied
on a certain masculine code of honour.</p>

<p>"I am past that. I am not going to lose a chance for Ireland out
of respect for the delicacy of a discredited woman," he
replied.</p>

<p>She fell back, with exasperating persistence, on her old plea;
still putting her arms about him, so that it was impossible for him
to pass through the doorway without rudely shaking her off, she
urged in supplicating tones:</p>

<p>"You loved me once, you wanted me for years."</p>

<p>But he turned his head, straining away from her as far as
possible without violently loosening her clinging hands.</p>

<p>"This, madam, is of a revolting absurdity!"</p>

<p>She cried with fury:</p>

<p>"It is not for your wife's sake that you have been thus austere,
but because you had another mistress."</p>

<p>"Leave it at that, then." He looked down at her. "Say I had, say
that any trollop who followed the army pleased me better than you,
Madame de Bonnac; say or do anything so it is clear that all is
finished between us! I tell you in no way do you please me or
impress me. I would rather expose you for what you are before the
entire camp than jeopardise for one moment further the fallen
fortunes of my most wretched country."</p>

<p>Olivia, prying, peering, saw the anguish in his eyes, the quiver
of his finely-shaped mouth, but she knew that these were no signs
of softening towards her. She withdrew from him, pressing her long
fine fingers on a breast which rose and fell bitterly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps one day you will know that I am even more dangerous
than you seem to think; you may humble me, you cannot make me
humble&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am sunk very low," said Lucan, "that I must stand here and
listen to a light woman's invective."</p>

<p>He put her by, and left her; her insulting laughter sounded
through the roses.</p>

<p>Lucan went directly to the pavilion of Saint Rhue.</p>

<p>The commander-in-chief was in a good humour, for he was pleased
with the success of a strange piece of cunning which he had
employed to make up for the lack of horses. He had asked all the
Jacobite gentlemen throughout Connaught to appear mounted at
Limerick, and when they had come, eager for his orders or favours,
they were asked to dismount and hand over their steeds for the use
of His Britannic Majesty.</p>

<p>The acquisition of this large number of fine Irish horses, and
the disgust of the Irish gentry whom he hated, had gratified St.
Rhue. He also felt sure that he was about to very soon witness or
to hear of the complete discomfiture of Ginckel; he believed that
when he marched towards Athlone it would be to see the retreating
brigades of the Dutch commander. He and all his French officers
swore that it was impossible to cross the river, and he had
remarked in his superb insolent fashion:</p>

<p>"General Ginckel's master should hang him for trying to take
Athlone, and mine ought to hang me if I lose it."</p>

<p>Also there was the departure of Tyrconnel to soothe him.</p>

<p>He therefore received even Lucan with a sufficiency of courtesy,
though he expressed his surprise at the earliness of the visit when
they had met only yesterday.</p>

<p>The pavilion showed very sumptuously in the daylight and lacked
no possible detail of luxury. It was in haughty and, Lucan thought,
in bitter contrast to the desolation of the boggy, swampy country
swarming with the natives, the starved, the dying and the dead. St.
Rhue was in a brocade bed-chamber gown, and fresh from the hands of
his barber.</p>

<p>He asked Lucan to seat himself, and the two men, so magnificent
in their physical bearing, so different in all else, faced each
other.</p>

<p>For a second Lucan could not speak, so hateful to him was the
thing he must say, but as he watched the cold hatred mount slowly
in the Frenchman's fine eyes he was sure that Madame de Bonnac had
lied, that her husband had spoken the truth&mdash;and it came to him
more easily to speak with that candour which was natural to
him.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, I believe you have been misinformed as to my
success in the favours of a certain lady. The affair seems
impossible to discuss, yet it is more impossible that we should
labour under any misunderstanding. I cannot endure to be left out
of another battle as I was left out of the Boyne Water
skirmish."</p>

<p>Completely taken by surprise St. Rhue did not answer; his
handsome face grew harder, more hostile and imperious in
expression; he turned aside and picked up an inlaid fowling piece.
Lucan added haughtily:</p>

<p>"You understand me, Monseigneur?"</p>

<p>"I understand," said the Frenchman sternly, "what you would wish
me to understand, but you must know there is no good reason why I
should believe you, Lord Lucan."</p>

<p>"If this lady&mdash;whom it is needless for me to name&mdash;has, through
coquetry, or because she is a most intriguing woman, conveyed to
you that I am her favoured lover she has dealt in lies, before God
and on my honour I may swear it!"</p>

<p>He leaned forward as he spoke, his whole being absorbed in
endeavouring to read St. Rhue's soul as that personage turned
slowly to face him, still holding the fowling piece.</p>

<p>The expression of smouldering fury, of half-belief, of
half-incredulity, of hope and passion that he read in that dark
face, despite the Frenchman's efforts to maintain an impressive
calm, convinced Lucan that Madame de Bonnac's tactics had been
indeed what her husband had declared; partly to torment the man who
loved her, partly to ruin Lucan whom she believed she loved, she
had told a ruinous lie.</p>

<p>"Do you not believe me," he asked, "sooner than&mdash;that
woman?"</p>

<p>St. Rhue averted his fine eyes. He was struggling with a most
imperious pride with jealousy, an instinctive hatred of the
splendid Irishman and a situation which was, as Lucan had surmised,
most difficult for him. For it was perfectly true that though
Madame de Bonnac had been for years his mistress, he still desired
her with a haughty and jealous desire; that he had been unable to
find any one to put in her place since her wilful exasperating
departure from France; that she had informed him by letter and by
contemptuous words since he had come to Ireland that Lord Lucan was
his successor in her graces. He so far betrayed himself to say:</p>

<p>"I believe many years ago you were a suitor for the hand of
Mademoiselle Olivia Joyce."</p>

<p>This showed Lucan how keen an interest he took in the affairs of
Madame de Bonnac, and how accurately he had informed himself as to
the events of her life.</p>

<p>"That was the beginning and the end. I desired the lady in
honour."</p>

<p>"Pouf!" cried St. Rhue. "<i>Grand Dieu!</i> I do not think we
are here to talk of honour&mdash;" He stopped and seemed to again
struggle with himself. "You are a good soldier, Lord Lucan," he
added, rising and walking up and down, "you are very popular with
your countrymen, I have heard nothing but fair reports of you."</p>

<p>"I desire to serve you, to second you. I assure you that what I
have just told you is the truth; I hope that you find it impossible
to doubt my word."</p>

<p>St. Rhue, who seemed resolute not to return to that detestable
subject, added:</p>

<p>"Brigadier Luttrell, he is also a very clever man and popular
with the Irish, your friend, too, I think?"</p>

<p>Not understanding what this sudden allusion meant, Lucan
said:</p>

<p>"That was some time ago."</p>

<p>"But Luttrell," added St. Rhue, "I suspect of double-dealing. I
think he treats underhand with the English."</p>

<p>"It may very well be, but it was not on this matter,
monseigneur, that I came to speak to you. I feel myself in a maze
of treachery, of intrigue&mdash;"</p>

<p>He would have spoken something of his frantic patriotism and the
agony of his desire that in this last stand Ireland should acquit
herself well, but he felt too shame-faced to talk before the
arrogant and heartless Frenchman of the love and pain so near his
heart, as he had been ashamed to mention it three years before when
the first council was called at Kinsale.</p>

<p>But St. Rhue appeared to guess what was in his mind and
said:</p>

<p>"You are eager in the cause of your country, Lord Lucan. Ireland
is nothing to me. I can only tell you, what I told you before, that
I shall do my utmost to obtain a victory over your enemies."</p>

<p>"Will you give me any part in that?" demanded Lucan, with eager
candour. "I can help. Will you give me a chance? Trust me? Believe
in me? I came here to have all straight between us&mdash;"</p>

<p>St. Rhue looked at him clearly and steadily for a moment and
Lucan had a wild hope that despite the sly treachery of Madame de
Bonnac his difference with the commander-in-chief might come to a
generous solution.</p>

<p>But the Frenchman was not the man to decide on a magnanimous
course, nor could his imperious and cynic nature easily believe in
candour and honesty. His hatred of the Irishman was deep-rooted,
not only because of Madame de Bonnac, but on professional grounds.
Tyrconnel had warned him from the first that in Lord Lucan he would
find a serious rival to his influence and authority; nor could St.
Rhue forget any more than De Rosen or Lauzun had forgotten that he,
St. Rhue, represented the King of France, that Lucan was of the
despised, the conquered, the outcast race. Besides he was sure
Madame de Bonnac loved him. Therefore, he turned at last on his
heel, and said dryly:</p>

<p>"I have not yet decided on my orders, Lord Lucan. When I have
you shall know them and your post."</p>

<p>The words were empty, formal, but the tone, for deliberate
intention of insolence, was like a blow in the face. Ignoring the
presence of Lucan, the Frenchman called to one of his valets and
complained of some rust on the fowling piece; it was his intention,
he said, to go shooting that morning.</p>

<p>Lucan left the pavilion; he had been dismissed like a
lackey.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-49" id="ch1-49"></a>FORTY-NINE</h2>

<p class="first">
ON THE LAST DAY of June, St. Rhue, who had moved his camp two
miles from Athlone on the Connaught side, gave an entertainment to
the gentlefolk of Galway and the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>He was perfectly confident about the progress of the siege which
General Ginckel had commenced on the eighteenth of June when he
had, after garrisoning Ballymore, marched to Ballyburn Pass with
twenty thousand men. St. Rhue, it is true, had only arrived after
Ginckel had taken Englishtown, that portion of Athlone on the other
side of the Shannon, but he made very little of this, still holding
to his opinion that "it was impossible for the Dutchman to get
across the river, and that he would soon raise the siege."</p>

<p>There had been severe fighting round the bridge, and several
attempts to ford the waters of the Shannon; but Ginckel remained on
the Westmeath bank, and there the French were sure he would stay
until he fell back, discomfited, on Ballymore.</p>

<p>With Lucan and his party humiliated, Tyrconnel withdrawn to
Limerick, Luttrell and his followers fawning on him, St. Rhue was
tolerably satisfied with the manner in which he had, as he put it
to himself, "quelled the mutineers and asserted the supreme
authority of the King of France."</p>

<p>He was completely contemptuous of his growing unpopularity among
the Irish soldiery, whose fierce loyalty was given to Lucan under
whose leadership they had endured the miseries of the past winter,
fighting with him for their country as best they could, even
passing the Shannon when snow was on the ground. He was the man who
had been their idol, their darling, who knew every inch of their
ground, every corner of their hearts, and who, from being governor
of Connaught and first in command, was now degraded to a
subordinate position to a foreigner who delighted in humiliating
him at every turn, and their deep love smouldered near to
rebellion.</p>

<p>It was impossible for St. Rhue to omit Lucan from his
entertainment, and almost impossible for the Irishman to come to
his table. But Lucan's supporters urged him to keep up a semblance
of civility.</p>

<p>Lucan came to the Frenchman's pavilion early, but with no
thought of relaxation, ease or diversion in his tormented mind. He
wished to make a protest against the weakening of the garrison of
Athlone, now held only by weak recruits without bullets in their
pouches, and against the obstinacy of the commander, the Marquis
d'Usson, in refusing to level the fortifications on the Connaught
side, in neglecting to use scouts, vedettes, or even sentries.</p>

<p>"How do you know all this, Lord Lucan?" demanded St. Rhue. "It
seems to me none of your affair&mdash;I am responsible for
Athlone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is why I thought you would like the warning,
monseigneur."</p>

<p>"The siege is over, Ginckel will retreat to-morrow."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I think he will make another attack."</p>

<p>"Again, where do you get your information?"</p>

<p>"I have men, native Irish, on whom I can rely, who never fail to
keep me supplied with all details of the enemy's movements. If I
had not had such faithful allies I had not been able to hold
Connaught last winter, deprived as I was of everything."</p>

<p>"You continue to stress your own services, Lord Lucan.
Your forays were of no importance&mdash;these thieves and
<i>banditti</i> you employ make you little better than a mutineer.
My Lord Galmoy tells me he suspects you encourage a notorious
rogue, one O'Hogan, or some such barbarous name, who, should have
been hanged long since&mdash;but broke prison&mdash;perhaps with your
connivance, eh? Understand I'll not employ such scoundrels."</p>

<p>"I am reprimanded?" asked Lucan. He was very pale, he tried to
smile, but his lips were stiff.</p>

<p>"You may take it so, if you please, Lord Lucan."</p>

<p>The pavilion was drenched in aromatics to deaden the stenches of
the camp. The French valets prevented, by fine nets, the entrance
of the swarms of bloated flies that fed on rotting corpses of men
and animals, on filth and refuse. Services of silver and crystal,
Persian carpets, linen stiff with lace, silk cushions and bouquets
of roses created an illusion of civilisation.</p>

<p>Provisions were ample among the staff officers though the
soldiery starved where they could not rob. St. Rhue had brought the
choicest luxuries from France, and these the French cooks turned
into exquisite dishes.</p>

<p>After supper there were to be bonfires, music, dancing,
illuminations and fireworks; it would really he quite a creditable
copy of a fête at Versailles or Marli. The filthy, brutal, ragged
Irish were to keep, at the bayonet's point, far from the
commander-in-chief's pavilion and the surroundings, now turned into
a pleasure ground.</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac was the queen of this festival; it was given
for her, to please her, woo her, intoxicate her into forgetting the
discomforts of war, her silly passion for a wild Irishman&mdash;to bring
her again into the arms of the man who longed for her with so
bitter, so jealous a passion.</p>

<p>She had been very fine of late; it was supposed that her
fashionable Paris clothes and modish jewels must have been brought
from France by St. Rhue himself. She made all the other ladies seem
shabby, almost draggled. She kept her other admirers; Luttrell,
whose flattery of St. Rhue was the ironic servility of a clever man
making a dupe of a vain one, was still her gay cavalier; Galmoy was
openly in her company.</p>

<p>She arrived radiant in white and rose brocade under a coat of
azure velvet in the pavilion; plumes frosted with silver mingled
with her lustrous tresses. She had an air of triumph, of
self-assurance, of gaiety, some special grace and beauty that drew
all eyes.</p>

<p>Lucan was thankful that Honor, formally bidden to his festival,
had declined to leave the dark Spanish mansion in Galway.</p>

<p>Luttrell began to abuse Ginckel in a light, sneering way, making
a jest of the slow, cautious Dutchman, telling little anecdotes to
his discredit, holding him up to ridicule. St. Rhue was pleased,
but Lucan winced. He knew that the Dutchman had shown great skill
and energy, that he was a man of an even temperament and a sweet
disposition, respected by all; his justice and moderation had done
much for the English cause in Ireland. He had also superseded three
officers, Douglas, Kirk, and Lanier, who were not popular among the
Protestants, and replaced them by Mackay, Ruvigny and Talmash. It
was reported that these, with Generals Nassau and Wurtemberg, and
the troops of various nationalities which they commanded, worked
together in perfect concord. Lucan remarked on this, and St. Rhue
replied with a sneer:</p>

<p>"That therein would lie their success as in their perpetual
disputes would lie the failure of the Irish."</p>

<p>Lucan went to the door of the pavilion; the June afternoon was
of a thick sweetness, the sky above the purple bogs was
dove-coloured, veiled with hues of changing pearl. From very far
away came scents of summer, hay, hedgerows, water sedges, wayside
flowers&mdash;or so he thought.</p>

<p>Lucan looked along the causeway which led across the swamps to
Athlone. Everything was still save for the chatter in the pavilion.
Lucan returned to the company who were drinking French brandy and
wines in glasses like frozen lilies. St. Rhue was close to Olivia
de Bonnac. Lucan heard one of his staff murmur that the
commander-in-chief was "<i>ivre avec d'amour et de haine&mdash;"</i></p>

<p>Lucan was considering the details of the siege and the skill and
caution of Ginckel, which had defeated his own brilliant audacity;
the Dutchman had thrown up entrenchments at the foot of the bridge
across the river and mounted fresh batteries on Englishtown; a
train of artillery on a scale which had not been hitherto known had
been made ready at Dublin&mdash;thirty-nine pieces of cannon, six mortar
and twelve steel pieces and five hundred draught horses came to
reinforce Ginckel who, learning from the experience of the Prince
of Orange before Limerick the preceding year, had taken every
precaution against a surprise. It had been impossible for Lucan to
repeat his exploit at Ballyneety. Every day powder and provisions
came up from the great depots at Mullingar. Ginckel could not at
first discover a ford across the Shannon, and his tin boats and
pontoons were insufficient to convey his army across the swift
river. A ford was found; Lucan saw this, and St. Rhue had erected
earthworks commanding the passage...Ginckel made no further attempt
in this direction...for four days the English guns had fired
without ceasing...the main prize was the bridge. Since Ginckel was
not able to cross by the ford he concentrated all his arts upon
this.</p>

<p>St. Rhue, to amuse Madame de Bonnac, was talking about this
fight round this bridge which had been blasted so that only one
arch remained.</p>

<p>"It was so narrow that a few men might hold it against an army,
and I was confident that it could not be taken."</p>

<p>The Dutch general also began to think so, but other devices
appeared equally impossible...he could not attempt to build a
pontoon under gunfire; he could not attempt to pass the keenly
guarded ford; he came reluctantly to the decision that he must take
the stone bridge.</p>

<p>The English contrived to lay planks across the wide chasm which
yawned between the end of the masonry and the broken arch; Maxwell
perceived that Athlone was seriously threatened.</p>

<p>St. Rhue, lightly, and with the air of a man talking to please
ladies, told of a little exploit on last Sunday morning, which had
been "quite a pretty piece of work"&mdash;he had himself seen it through
his perspective glasses.</p>

<p>Lucan listened, gnawing his nether lip; his head was aching and
fits of giddiness made the overheated, over-perfumed tent spin
before his weary eyes.</p>

<p>"Of course, madam, it was death to go on the bridge, but very
necessary to destroy the planks&mdash;which of these animals would go?
<i>Grand Dieu,</i> on my faith, a sergeant and ten men volunteered
to put on their armour and creep out to destroy the beams. With
axes and swords they crawled out, exposed to cannon, musket shot
and hand grenades. I soon could not see them for flames&mdash;when the
smoke had a little blown away I saw eleven dead, but the planks had
been torn up and cast into the Shannon...eleven others sprang
forward and when they were gone the English work had been
destroyed, the beams were floating down the river together with the
bodies&mdash;it was really a very useful piece of work&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucan approached the speaker:</p>

<p>"Does not this brilliant act of devotion do much to raise the
name of Irishmen in the eyes of the Frenchmen?" he asked.</p>

<p>St. Rhue stared at him as if he had been a stranger, then
said:</p>

<p>"It was no doubt quite courageous&mdash;if they had been Frenchmen
one might have called it heroic, but I suppose these animals are so
stupid they do not know what they risk&mdash;but I remain obliged to
them, as Ginckel has not since tried to take the bridge."</p>

<p>But Madame de Bonnac cried, in the liveliest fashion:</p>

<p>"But the Irish are the bravest people in the world and the
handsomest men&mdash;eh, <i>le beau gars</i>!"</p>

<p>And she gave Lucan looks of love and favour that sent St. Rhue's
hand clutching on his sword.</p>

<p>Lucan saw her design to create enmity and hatred, confusion and
fury.</p>

<p>"If she forces her amorous advances on me, I'll insult her
before them all&mdash;"</p>

<p>Luttrell, squinting with amusement, began to tell stories of the
wretched rapparees, thus hitting at Lucan who protected them, and
pleasing St. Rhue, who detested them; he mentioned one who "called
himself a sergeant who had been found like an otter, hiding in a
stream with only his nose out&mdash;he had been dragged out and hanged
though he had offered forty shillings for his life, which he
thought a great sum!"</p>

<p>Every one laughed save Lucan; and Luttrell added, in tones of
sparkling malice, he "wondered what would become of the poor
garrison of Ballymore who had been sent to the Isle of Lambray to
starve?"</p>

<p>Lucan went out into the outer air; at the risk of an open breach
with St. Rhue he could not eat with these people.</p>

<p>An express from Maxwell, on duty that day in Athlone, broke in
with a request for reinforcements on the French entertainment, as
the Scot suspected that Ginckel was about to make some
movement.</p>

<p>St. Rhue replied that "if General Maxwell was afraid, another
should be sent to take his place"&mdash;to a request for powder he
returned: "Did they want to shoot laverocks?"</p>

<p>Lucan, sullenly, mournfully seated in his own desolate tent, did
not hear of this; but, as the angelus bells were ringing, Toby
O'Hogan crept into his presence and said that Ginckel was certainly
intending an attack.</p>

<p>"You're sure, O'Hogan?"</p>

<p>"I am sure."</p>

<p>Lucan returned to the commander-in-chief's tent; the sumptuous
supper had begun; jest, wine, music, laughter, boasts, merry tales
made the aromatic air full of noise.</p>

<p>Standing in the doorway, pale and unsmiling, Lucan gave his
information.</p>

<p>"Brought by one of your cow-stealers, I suppose?" smiled St.
Rhue.</p>

<p>"By a friend of mine. There is great negligence, your
self-assurance is shared by D'Usson who has not demolished the
ramparts as he has been ordered to do; he even became careless in
the matter of sentinels when he saw that the English were
withdrawing their troops. I said there is great negligence&mdash;"</p>

<p>A silence fell on the insolent, brilliant company of French
officers, all looked at the Irishman standing immovable in the
doorway, the June sunshine behind him; Olivia de Bonnac made a
movement as if she would rise and go to him, but St. Rhue with a
sudden, violent gesture caught her bare arm and pulled her to her
seat with a force that revealed his passion.</p>

<p>"This to my face!" he cried.</p>

<p>"I accuse you," replied Lucan, "of folly, of neglect, to your
face&mdash;"</p>

<p>St. Rhue leapt to his feet; his staff closed in behind him; but
before he could speak a dusty dragoon broke in to stammer that the
English soldiers were breasting the ford.</p>

<p>The commander-in-chief replied imperiously, "that the thing was
impossible! That the English would not attack a town at such a
disadvantage when he was near with his army to succour it, that he
would give a thousand pistoles to see them make the attempt!" But
on the instant arrival of several other messengers with the same
incredible news, the furious Frenchman reluctantly left his
pavilion, and ordered Hamilton to the town. Too late; as the
Jacobites approached Athlone they found themselves unable to enter;
D'Usson had not demolished the fortifications and the Jacobites
found their own gates shut in their faces, the drawbridge raised,
their own guns fired upon them; St. Rhue, who had not taken
sufficient interest in the news to refrain from returned to his
pavilion, was informed of the amazing tidings by Lucan, who had
been galloping to and fro, doing what he could.</p>

<p>"Taken!" Saint Rhue exclaimed. "It cannot be! A town taken and I
close by with an army to relieve it!"</p>

<p>He rode out into the summer twilight and beheld with his own
eyes the English flag raised above the citadel of Irishtown.</p>

<p>Athlone had fallen in half an hour.</p>

<p>Mackay, Wurtemberg, Tettau Hesse (accompanied by Talmash as a
simple volunteer), and Hamilton had made an assault at six o'clock
that same evening...as the angelus was ringing and St. Rhue's
guests laughing, two thousand troops, each man carrying fifteen
rounds of ammunition and wearing as a badge a spray of green in
their hats, had made the attack, their advance covered by their
powerful guns. It was an utter rout; Maxwell had handed over his
sword in silence; St. Rhue met D'Usson being carried along
unconscious over the bog; he had been trampled down in the flight
of his own men "So the impossible has happened," said Lucan.</p>

<p>The tents were struck, rich wines spilled, gay finery soiled
into the mud as in all haste the French fell back on
Ballinasloe.</p>

<p>Lucan saw beneath his horse's hoofs the hat with the silvered
plumes worn by Madame de Bonnac; as the English fired the Irish
batteries from Athlone, he remarked:</p>

<p>"St. Rhue has had his fireworks, after all."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-50" id="ch1-50"></a>FIFTY</h2>

<p class="first">
ST. RHUE'S dinner-party was spoilt; spoilt, too, seemed the
chances of the King of France of detaining indefinitely the Prince
of Orange in Ireland.</p>

<p>The end was in sight.</p>

<p>There remained nothing, in Lucan's opinion, but to make a last
stand in Connaught, and nothing, in St. Rhue's opinion, to retrieve
his shattered reputation but a brilliant battle.</p>

<p>The dogged perseverance of the Dutch general had won the day,
and the bitterness of gall had been in the heart of St. Rhue as he
gave orders for his troops to withdraw. As soon as he did so,
General Wauchope surrendered the castle of Athlone. The English, in
this surprise assault, had taken Athlone with a loss only of twelve
killed and thirty wounded...</p>

<p>As St. Rhue retreated he heard that the small garrisons guarding
the fords of the Shannon had abandoned their posts, that the
peasants were going over in large numbers to the English camp,
promising henceforth to live "as loyal subjects of King William and
Queen Mary."</p>

<p>General Ginckel, who had accomplished an extraordinary feat in
taking a fortified town in the face of a large army, bore his
honours with modesty, and with his usual good-natured intolerance
granted letters of protection to all who asked for them; he was in
this matter in complete understanding with his master, who had
secretly told him to take measures of the utmost clemency with the
Irish. The prudent and thoughtful Dutchman expressed his pleasure
at finding six fine brass guns, two mortars, twenty barrels of
powder and huge quantities of provisions in Athlone.</p>

<p>Lucan had done little in the action; though he had foreseen the
surprise he shared the blame and disgrace that fell upon St. Rhue;
his hands had been tied and he had been as inactive as a
puppet...</p>

<p>During the retreat to their headquarters at Ballinasloe he had
seen Madame de Bonnac gorgeously arrayed in a satin
gold-embroidered cloak, travelling in a little light wagon...She
was laughing and seemed to regard the misfortunes of her lover as a
jest full of flavour...</p>

<p>Sensitive as Lucan was, and often changing his mood according to
circumstances, he shared to the full the Irish liability to
depression in misfortune and exultation in good fortune; he was in
a black despondency and advised a retreat to Limerick. There was
obviously no hope of retaking Athlone which Ginckel had repaired
and re-fortified.</p>

<p>At Ballinasloe a council of war was held; it was impossible to
exclude Lucan from this, though he knew that St. Rhue would like to
have done so; losing Athlone under such humiliating circumstances
had made a deal of difference to the mood of the French commander
who, always harsh and imperious, was now gloomy and sullen, and
disguised from none how embittered he was with the sting of defeat.
He fiercely and coldly blamed Tyrconnel for his interference which
had rendered their joint part so difficult...and tried to put the
blame on the "runaway Irish." In reality he knew, as every soldier
under his command knew, that the loss of Athlone was largely due to
the fatal faults of underrating the enemy, and his own over
self-assurance. These errors St. Rhue now meant, by every means in
his power, to repair. The imperious Frenchman, who brooked not even
the slightest advice and who considered himself the superior of
every Irishman yet owned a master and dreaded to return to
Versailles in disgrace. He feared that he might be recalled to meet
the stare of His Most Christian Majesty and the sneer of Louvois;
he feared disgrace, perhaps the Bastille.</p>

<p>In the council chamber he declared vehemently, with an
impulsiveness that hitherto seemed foreign to his character, that
he would fight, throwing all his forces to defend the passage of
the river...Tyrconnel objected; he could not see that victory lay
in the gaining of a single battle; he declared that it was better
to make a defensive and dilatory war in expectation that they would
be superior next year by reason of succours from France.</p>

<p>With a touch of his old wit, which had been much in eclipse of
late, he swore that the best Irish generals were "General Rain" and
"General Disease."</p>

<p>Lucan backed Tyrconnel; he said that he considered the counsel
of St. Rhue too difficult, and added that it was perilous to risk
all in a single encounter. He thought that Galway and Limerick
ought to be further garrisoned&mdash;he spoke soberly, almost dully,
like a man detached from life; he had avoided St. Rhue for he knew
that their private meeting would mean a quarrel.</p>

<p>"No doubt," sneered St. Rhue, "the Irish fight better under
cover than they do in the open."</p>

<p>Without a change of expression Lucan added:</p>

<p>"We can give Ginckel enough to do until French assistance shall
arrive; we could make raids in Munster or Leinster, or could
blockade the Dutchman in Athlone."</p>

<p>"All talk!" exclaimed St. Rhue impatiently. "What is the use of
that? It is my intention to fight."</p>

<p>"You are thinking, Monseigneur, of your own reputation, not of
Ireland."</p>

<p>"I was not sent here," was the retort, "to think of
Ireland."</p>

<p>The council ended in mutual quarrelling, recrimination and heat.
St. Rhue, absorbed in his own private shames, jealousies and
furies, took no heed of what any of them said; Madame de Bonnac
continued to torment him with all the subtle arts of a sensual,
heartless woman; through torturing him she knew that she achieved
her real aim which was to torture Patrick Sarsfield (always that to
her), the man she perversely loved.</p>

<p>Never before that July night had Lucan noticed such crowded
galaxies of stars; the glittering clusters hung low as marsh lights
over the dark stretches of the swamp. Lucan, fatigued, overwrought,
anguished, felt the supernatural drawing veils about his soul;
somewhere in the camp an Irish harp was playing; the peaty smell of
the bog was strong; he felt as if he must put out his hand to brush
aside the stars; they seemed to dazzle his eyes and impede his
progress.</p>

<p>When he half stumbled into his tent he found O'Hogan waiting in
the shadows.</p>

<p>Lucan cast himself down on a pile of mantles.</p>

<p>"The Frenchman means to fight, O'Hogan&mdash;out of injured vanity.
Risk all for that!"</p>

<p>"You have quarrelled with him, my lord?"</p>

<p>"As far as I dare."</p>

<p>"It would not be difficult," mused the rapparee, "to put a
bullet through his hard, black heart."</p>

<p>As Lucan did not answer, he added:</p>

<p>"&mdash;and that gay mischief, too. She would make a dainty meal for
the crows, with her soft, white flesh and her fine blue eyes&mdash;a
delicate dainty vermin."</p>

<p>"Let her go."</p>

<p>"I know what she does. Every one knows. She tells the damned
Frenchman that you enjoy her, under his nose, and laugh at him&mdash;and
he mad with brutish lust."</p>

<p>"Let them go."</p>

<p>"And you in torment, as it might be a foretaste of Hell. God is
good, but the Devil is everywhere! Supposing they were strangled
and flung together in the bog of Urrachree?" The rapparee looked
longingly at his strong hands. "It has been the grave of many a
finer man, of many a fairer woman."</p>

<p>"I have to go on," said Lucan. "I suppose I must go on and see
all lost&mdash;lost&mdash;lost! Sometimes I feel the heart of Ireland break
in my breast."</p>

<p>The rapparee bowed his head; his heavy, handsome figure was
black in the shadows; only a small taper lit the tent which was
very poorly furnished.</p>

<p>"Why are we thus accursed!" added Lucan wildly. "O, Ireland! I
am sick with the smell of blood, of rotting flesh&mdash;I am deafened by
wails and cries, I am giddy with staring at desolation! What shall
avail! Twenty died to cut the bridge at Athlone and it makes a jest
for the foreigner! When shall they have a song, a monument! Where
are our laurels, our flags, our privacies, our prides? Who shall
ever right the wrongs we endure!"</p>

<p>"Exile for us, captivity or death," sighed the rapparee, "and
for our children's children the same, the yoke of the conqueror,
the scorn of the heretic, desecration in our sacred places and on
all we love pollution. O Holy Ghost! Look down on this poor
isle!"</p>

<p>Lucan crossed his brow.</p>

<p>"We must play our part, O'Hogan. Blessed are those already
beneath the waters of the Shannon, happy those whose bones we see
whiten the bog&mdash;we have yet more to suffer."</p>

<p>The rapparee rose suddenly and spoke in a different tone.</p>

<p>"And you, Patrick Sarsfield, more than you yet know. I debated
if I would speak or not, but nothing but the truth can be between
us."</p>

<p>"What would you tell me? I am so weary and I thought that I was
a man who could never tire."</p>

<p>"My men found the dwarf woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The dwarf&mdash;Brighita Begg?"</p>

<p>"In a peat cutter's hut, on the bogs, towards Athenry."</p>

<p>"Put out that taper, O'Hogan. It hurts my eyes&mdash;I grow
near-sighted of late, like Mountcashel."</p>

<p>The rapparee obeyed; he held back the tent flap; the dazzle of
stars seemed very near; out of the dark Lucan spoke:</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>"The young gentlewoman is with her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not Ishma?"</p>

<p>"I do think so. They are very timid and will not answer
questions. I am having them watched. Protected."</p>

<p>"Oh, not Ishma!"</p>

<p>"You will come yourself and see&mdash;it is not five miles from the
camp."</p>

<p>Lucan did not move.</p>

<p>"You know their story, O'Hogan?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Did you ask it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Why should I? They were just two women sheltering in a hut&mdash;as
there be many."</p>

<p>"Where had they come from? Why did they not ask my protection?
What do you know? Answer me."</p>

<p>The rapparee's voice came low and hoarse.</p>

<p>"I will not. Come yourself, come now, not in white daylight with
all the curious spies about, but now at night when the darkness is
kind and the stars are light enough."</p>

<p>Lucan replied that he would go at once, but before he could
leave the tent came the message that St. Rhue, who appeared to have
bowed to the decision of the majority of the council, had in the
end obeyed the dictates of his own imperious temper, and resolved
to fight. Abandoning the fords of the Suck he had decided to retire
to Kilcommodon Hill, a position behind his camp, which sloped up
from the bog. Ginckel had already passed the Shannon and taken
possession of the heights of Corbally. It seemed his intention also
to risk all on a battle.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-51" id="ch1-51"></a>FIFTY-ONE</h2>

<p class="first">
LORD LUCAN followed Galloping O'Hogan from the camp at
Kilcommodon across the gloomy waste of bog stretching beyond the
little village of Aughrim towards Athenry; as he followed the
rapparee into the quiet of the windy twilight he glanced behind him
and saw the Jacobite forces occupying the ridge of the hill for
about two miles.</p>

<p>St. Rhue's pavilion was pitched near the steepest part of the
hill where lay the majestic ruins of two old mighty fortifications.
Toby O'Hogan passed to the north of this where a great swampy
valley spread for miles, sloping beneath the castle of Aughrim
which dominated the road from Ballinasloe.</p>

<p>"We're not going there?" asked Lucan, for he knew that beyond
this the bog was impassable; behind the marsh, the hill of
Urrachree was mournful in the solemnity of the pale azure summer
twilight; the low stream trickling through the bog, which was too
soft for the cavalry to use and could only be crossed by the
infantry if they were guided by one who knew the paths, reflected
the opal silver light of the waning sky.</p>

<p>Lucan followed the rapparee, who was wrapped in his Irish
mantle, into the deepening twilight. Lucan himself wore over his
uniform that antique Irish garment of which an Englishman had once
said indignantly: "It is a fit house for an outlaw, a meet bed for
a rebel, an apt cloak for a thief." He was disguised; he did not
wish his brave scarlet to be recognised; St. Rhue or Tyrconnel
might even claim that leaving his post at such a moment amounted to
cowardice or treachery.</p>

<p>It was so still that they could hear on a sudden a bell tolling
out from the little church at Aughrim.</p>

<p>Overhead were multitudes of sea birds with coral-red feet; Lucan
noted their swift brilliant grace and their unblemished purity,
they did not seem to belong to the same creation as that which
defiled and soiled the gloomy earth. He wished that he could fly
with them across the wild Bay of Galway through the scud and foam
of the great Atlantic waves. The melancholy of the country
depressed him. They came up to the peat-cutter's hut, a
miserable-looking hovel, a place too wretched to attract even the
attention of the marauding soldiery; only on the purple bogs, only
to be found by one who knew the hidden causeway.</p>

<p>"Is she here?"</p>

<p>The rapparee noded and entered the door of the mud cabin.</p>

<p>A turf fire was smouldering on the hearth in a rude circle of
stones and a pot was suspended from an iron crane above; a bent
creature who was covered by an old ragged yellow frieze cloak
(Lucan instantly recognised her as Mrs. Brighita Begg) crouched
over these embers; though it was summer the day was chill; a wind
was abroad, blowing humid mists.</p>

<p>Making the sign of the cross with a reverence which was in ill
accordance with his ferocious appearance, the rapparee humbly
pointed the way to an inner apartment.</p>

<p>Lucan stumbled on the threshold.</p>

<p>He saw a straw bed with a rude coverlet, a plain chest on which
was a taper still unlit and a cup; everything showed penury and
misery.</p>

<p>The dwarf woman who had suddenly observed Lucan's entrance (for
she had seemed in a manner of stupor when he had first darkened the
door) sprang up, and, with a raucous cry, endeavoured to prevent
him passing into the inner room.</p>

<p>She tugged at his peasant mantle which fell apart; she saw the
fine scarlet uniform beneath; at that she gave another mournful and
bitter exclamation and hid her withered face in her dirty
hands.</p>

<p>"But you must go in, my lord," said Galloping O'Hogan. "The
gentlewoman I want you to see lies there...on the bed."</p>

<p>Lucan could not, for the first fell moment, put his fortitude to
the test; he turned his head sharply aside and stared out of the
small square unglazed window, at the cheerless and desolate
country; stretches of loose stones and a gloomy swamp, patches of
miserable tillage, the few poverty-stricken dwellings of the
peasantry presented a wretched picture of Ireland's woe.</p>

<p>Close by the hut where he stood were a few stunted thorns and he
was reminded, with that unutterable pang happy memories can give,
of the thorn trees by the well on his estate at Lucan, and of how
before he had lost Ishma he had sat there with her hand lying in
his; staring at this gray and melancholy waste he felt that his
destiny and his country were alike accursed.</p>

<p>He bowed his head, the door was very low; he entered the mean
room and bent over the pallet in the corner. The creature beneath
the tattered coverlet did not stir. All that he could see was
straggling locks of dark hair spread on the pile of straw that
served as a pillow. He seated himself on the low chest and gently
turned back the patched rags.</p>

<p>The girl lying there seemed to be asleep or blind; she was
wasted by fierce disease; her beauty had long since been effaced
but her youth was as apparent as her present misery.</p>

<p>Her lover knew at once, despite this frightful change, that it
was she. The poor blanket fell from his hand which went up to his
heart; he sighed deeply.</p>

<p>Galloping O'Hogan, with such delicacy and self-effacement that
it was impossible for his presence to be an offence, stood humbly
in the doorway.</p>

<p>He asked softly and in the native Irish, which Lucan had lately
learned to understand:</p>

<p>"Is it she? Is it the gentlewoman?"</p>

<p>Lucan replied:</p>

<p>"It is she whom I sought."</p>

<p>A low sound of protest broke from the lips of the rapparee; he
turned into the outer room.</p>

<p>Lucan lifted up Ishma; her weight seemed lighter than that of a
young child, no loveliness at all remained to her, she was wasted,
scarred, unclean.</p>

<p>"Are you blind, my love?" he asked. "Cannot you see me? Do you
not know that I am come at last?"</p>

<p>And he was sure by her blank look that she had lost her sight;
after she had gazed at him blindly a while, she timidly, with
wasted fingers, touched his laces and his gold braid, then
whispered: "A man! A soldier!" and a convulsive shudder of horror
shook her and she tried to struggle from him; he laid her back on
the straw. The mud floor crawled with vermin; the very light that
flowed through the narrow window seemed soiled; her long locks were
harsh and rusty; her lips were strained out of shape; from a deep
sore on her brow the blood trickled; for the first time he saw her
bare breasts, her bare arms; they were fallen and thin beneath her
rags; no longer did she wear gold ornaments, no longer was her skin
smooth and fine. Her soul was as vacant as her stare; he saw that
her intellect was clouded, she was like hundreds of abandoned,
starving, perishing women whom he had seen of late.</p>

<p>"Surely I am dying," he thought. "Surely I shall soon be
dead."</p>

<p>He took off his mantle and placed it over her. She seemed to
sleep; he could believe she did not suffer. He went into the outer
room where Mrs. Begg cowered and O'Hogan stood with downcast
head.</p>

<p>Leaning against the wall to hold himself upright, for his
strength had all slipped from him, Lucan asked:</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>Yet too well he knew.</p>

<p>Mrs. Begg, with sunk eyes scarlet from much weeping, peered at
him mournfully.</p>

<p>"The soldiers took her away, the soldiers came up to Lucan, they
killed the dog&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who could have done it?" whispered Lucan stupidly. "The enemy
was not then within Dublin. Who? Who?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Begg did not answer; she seemed stupid and confused; she
gave a deep moan, wrapped her tattered cloak closer round her
deformed shoulders, and huddled over the embers.</p>

<p>"Not the enemy," said O'Hogan; "base villains who are the
enemies of all."</p>

<p>The tall man leant in the wretched window place; the rapparee
stood near to support him if he should seem to fall.</p>

<p>"Then tell me," muttered Lucan. "What happened? What is their
story?"</p>

<p>"There is no need to tell their story. The young girl was
snatched by the fine gentlemen, then given to the soldiers, then
lost among the refugees and hidden in the mountains, and now the
Blessed Virgin has pity on her and is taking her away."</p>

<p>"She's dying," said Lucan, leaning on O'Hogan's heavy
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Will not you pray that she may die?"</p>

<p>Lucan turned to the window. The wide expanse of bog was dark
brown and purple in the deepening twilight, the thorns stood out
black and gaunt against the cold blue sky tinged with violet. One
star hung above the dreary swamp.</p>

<p>Lucan put his hands to his face and wept the first tears of his
manhood.</p>

<p>The rapparee glanced aside, Mrs. Begg continued her lamentations
under her breath.</p>

<p>Lucan said, staring out at the bog that they might not see his
tears:</p>

<p>"She does not know me."</p>

<p>"She knows no one," said O'Hogan. "We must praise God that she
will have forgotten everything."</p>

<p>"She is blind?"</p>

<p>"She went blind with what she had to see."</p>

<p>Lucan did not hear, his stiff lips formed, stumblingly some of
his broken thoughts:</p>

<p>"You would have thought that she could pass through flames&mdash;and
they fall back&mdash;she had such a bloom and lustre of innocence&mdash;a
child and a queen, too. Why was I so sure this would not happen to
her? Yet every day I have seen the mischances of others&mdash;but I
dreamed&mdash;not to her&mdash;not to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We are all great fools," said O'Hogan, "and what is left to any
of us, Lord Lucan, but the fortitude with which we face that
fact?"</p>

<p>"What shall I do? She trusted me. I thought she was so safe at
Lucan. And all undisturbed, so that it seemed she had fled&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was their cunning&mdash;no doubt they contrived it so, putting
all neat behind them."</p>

<p>Lucan began to laugh stupidly...he saw himself throwing her
garments into the pure lake lest they should be defiled...burying
the dog beneath the cross; he saw again his vision of Ishma
springing frantically to the shelter of the holy trees...in
vain.</p>

<p>"'Tis bewildering about God," he muttered. "I trusted God."</p>

<p>"He is so far away, Lord Lucan, and there are so many of us in
trouble&mdash;grief crowns us all. Who can understand? He sends His
tempests against the flowerets."</p>

<p>"What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"You are a man."</p>

<p>"Something still to do, eh? The battle to-morrow? But
first&mdash;tell me&mdash;who was it?"</p>

<p>His sombre eyes stared wildly at the wall; his glance was
atrocious; the rapparee thought: "He is mad."</p>

<p>"I will tell you after the battle, after the great fight for
Ireland. Tell you what I know, Lord Lucan," he said aloud simply,
"and I will kill for you any one you name."</p>

<p>"I should do that myself&mdash;but you understand me."</p>

<p>No words of devotion, of loyalty, of acceptance of service, of
gratitude or affection had ever passed between these two; such
avowals would have been a slur on a complete trust; this was as far
as Lucan had ever gone in rewarding the rapparee; nor did he ask
him how he had found Ishma, nor by what means he knew her
story.</p>

<p>"She lives yet," he said, "and there have been miracles&mdash;take
her to Galway&mdash;nay, I do not trust my brother-in-law, he would give
up the town at the first alarm&mdash;take her to Limerick where the
viceroy is&mdash;you can do it?"</p>

<p>"I can. I can get a light cart&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are some Poor Clares in Limerick&mdash;I forget where&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will find them."</p>

<p>Lucan moved from the window where the last light glinted in the
gilt of his sword.</p>

<p>"I must go and fight," he said. "You have men, I will give you
all the money you need. Take these two and house them in Limerick."
He counted out the gold, his last pay, carefully hoarded; he had
meant to send it to Honor who had moved to Limerick, feeling safer
there. "I have not enough money. This was for my wife. I
forgot."</p>

<p>"I will find the money and anything else you want, Lord
Lucan."</p>

<p>"I will get it presently, there is much owing to me."</p>

<p>He gave the name of an inn in Limerick where he was well known;
he was surprised that he was able to do this, but his instructions
were precise and methodical. He put down half the good money he had
(gold, not the down-cried brass tokens) into the rapparee's
hand.</p>

<p>"Give her all she needs, more than all she needs, every luxury;
lawn sheets and fine wool, gold for her wrists and hair, if any can
be got in Limerick, delicate ornaments, everything, and after the
battle I will come to you again."</p>

<p>"I will get everything," said the rapparee.</p>

<p>"Like a queen, she must pass like a queen&mdash;and after the battle
you will tell me what you know."</p>

<p>He went to the door of the inner room; Ishma lay in a stupor;
her eyes that he had thought like water violets were ashy in the
taperlight as she stared before her into desolation.</p>

<p>"She never had anything," muttered Lucan; "nothing at all."</p>

<p>He came from the inner room; the rapparee thought that his soul
was absent from his body&mdash;"Jesu, he looks a man of fifty!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Begg, feeding herself from the pot on the hearth, was
muttering:</p>

<p>"A little old woman must have a little cup of food&mdash;a little old
woman must have a few embers of fire."</p>

<p>Lucan looked through the window. In the deepening violet of the
evening the one large star showed brighter. He said:</p>

<p>"I can find my way across the bog, I know the paths now very
well. Do you as I have commanded you, use my name, my power, my
authority, my money, everything."</p>

<p>He walked slowly, heavily to the door; then turned, rigid with
an access of frenzy, seized the rapparee by the shoulders, and
shouted:</p>

<p>"Tell me who it was!"</p>

<p>"Not till after the battle&mdash;if you were to strangle me."</p>

<p>Lucan stared at him in sombre fury; then let him go and turned
away and took the causeway across the bog. Very terrible was the
landscape; yet he knew that his misery made it so, and that in
truth all was beautiful save for human wretchedness.</p>

<p>As he was then without his cloak his scarlet uniform showed
vivid even in the waning, livid light; he had forgotten his hat and
his hair blew back in a soft gale of wind that bent, with invisible
force, the thorns blasted by sea winds.</p>

<p>He thought, stupidly:</p>

<p>"Nesmond will be able to get out of the Shannon&mdash;the tempests
have dropped."</p>

<p>He passed through the poor patches of tillage, the dismal huts;
the people crawled out to stare at him, so strange a figure
striding along the causeway towards Aughrim.</p>

<p>With the instinct of love they knew him; who else had this
gigantic form, this majestic port?&mdash;"Patrick Sarsfield, the world's
wonder; Patrick Sarsfield, Ireland's hope; Patrick Sarsfield,
Ireland's darling&mdash;"</p>

<p>The ragged, starving wretches blessed him as he passed; a woman
was holding a dying child at whom she looked with love unutterable;
he put the rest of his scanty hoard into her bony hand, forgetting
Honor; two corpses sprawled across the causeway; he had to step
over them; beyond the scatter of huts two lean-ribbed dogs were
tearing at the body of an old man; his thin blood mingled with the
starlight in the soggy bog pools.</p>

<p>"Why did I hope to escape," muttered Lucan, "from Ireland's
curse!"</p>

<p>The strong man staggered, like one heavily burdened; when, near
Kilcommodon Hill, he lifted his eyes, it was to see the stark
outline of the gallows on which St. Rhue had hanged the Irish;
against a rift of gold-washed sky in which the stars sparkled
gorgeous with celestial pomp, the bound corpses showed black, with
bowed heads.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-52" id="ch1-52"></a>FIFTY-TWO</h2>

<p class="first">
GENERAL THE MARQUIS DE ST. RHUE was irritated because when, on
the eve of this most important engagement, he sent a messenger to
Lord Lucan, that officer was shut in his tent and would see no one;
his body-servant turned all away; his master had taken an opiate,
he had a fever.</p>

<p>But early in the morning the Irishman appeared in the pavilion
of the commander-in-chief with a wild suddenness that further
offended the Frenchman; nor was Lucan's uniform and deportment
according to the severe rules laid down by that haughty caste that
was the chivalry of France.</p>

<p>Lucan flung down a letter among the bijoux on St. Rhue's
bureau.</p>

<p>"These were brought me last night&mdash;they show Brigadier Luttrell
to be a traitor. He should be arrested at once."</p>

<p>Lucan spoke as if he cared nothing for the business and St. Rhue
was more deeply outraged.</p>

<p>"How did you come by this letter?" he demanded. "It is not
addressed to you."</p>

<p>Lucan replied briefly:</p>

<p>"The trumpeter who came yesterday to inquire after the English
wounded officers who are prisoners brought this too&mdash;it is from
Colonel Sebastian, one of General Ginckel's men&mdash;Luttrell being at
the cavalry depot this was handed to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why? It should have come to me."</p>

<p>"What does it matter? It is full of plain treachery&mdash;Luttrell
has been selling us for weeks."</p>

<p>"I should have had this letter last night." As it was in French
St. Rhue could read the epistle, which plainly showed Luttrell to
be in the pay of Ginckel; but the Frenchman seemed to make little
of it. "Why should <i>you</i> break the seal?"</p>

<p>"Last night I was overcome by private miseries&mdash;there is time
enough&mdash;arrest him at once."</p>

<p>"On this?" sneered St. Rhue. "It may be forged&mdash;you seem to take
the ruin of your friend very lightly."</p>

<p>"I think of Ireland. Do we fight to-day?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;to-morrow with the dawn, I believe."</p>

<p>"And you'll take no notice of Luttrell's treason?"</p>

<p>"Not on this. There must be inquiries."</p>

<p>"He is capable of it&mdash;I will see him myself."</p>

<p>"You Irish are always quarrelling," replied St. Rhue sternly.
"If you provoke this gentleman to a dispute I will have you broken,
Lord Lucan. But what you talk is folly."</p>

<p>"Very well. Who leads the cavalry to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Lord Galmoy."</p>

<p>"And De Tessé is your second in command?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me your designs?"</p>

<p>"No. You should have come to the council last night, Lord Lucan.
I sent for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Last night I could not see or stand."</p>

<p>"Drunk, eh?" smiled St. Rhue.</p>

<p>"No, not drunk." Lucan smiled also. "Give me, instead of Galmoy,
the cavalry to-morrow&mdash;he fights well, though a rogue, but I should
fight better&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will give it," said St. Rhue, "to whom I choose."</p>

<p>Profoundly vexed by being interrupted in his plans for the
morrow, he stared at Lucan (who cared nothing for that) with
haughty coldness. Lucan had about him the force of a man labouring
under a great passion; and even St. Rhue recognised this and
listened when, rising and pacing about he broke into speech,
pushing his thick hair from his forehead with a total disregard for
ceremony.</p>

<p>"I have lost all I valued in the world, there is nothing for me
but to seek out some way of dying, and I do entreat you to put me
in the forefront to-morrow. Give me some post of authority. Let me
taste once before I die what it is to lead a charge of Irishmen
against the enemy."</p>

<p>St. Rhue was impressed, but would not show it; the fellow was
mad, he thought.</p>

<p>"I will do what I can for you, Lord Lucan."</p>

<p>"If you set me down to-morrow you are less than a man. Do you
think I care for your blunders, or for those of your master? If I
do not have orders to fight I may fight without orders."</p>

<p>St. Rhue flamed at that.</p>

<p>"Insubordination! Lord Lucan, do you intend to join Brigadier
Luttrell, then be court-martialled and probably shot?"</p>

<p>"I have some power among the Irish," said the other, not as a
boast or a threat, but as a plain statement, "and I might use
it."</p>

<p>He paused by the seated Frenchman and stared down at him with
such utter disregard for all conventions, with such complete
self-absorption in some secret passion, that even St. Rhue was
checked in what he meant to have said.</p>

<p>He reflected on the situation. He was moved, almost impressed by
the deep passion, the recklessness of Lucan. He saw that he dealt
with a man profoundly roused, who had received some main blow which
made him indifferent to time and chance, and he believed he knew
what that was. He thought that Lucan had quarrelled with, perhaps
been dismissed by, Madame de Bonnac. He himself had had a fierce
scene with that cruel wanton woman, but in the end he had shown her
that he was master; that he had come to the end of his patience
with her lures and tricks; he had told her what she was and how
soon she would be old and past any man's desire.</p>

<p>She had taunted him with her preference for Lucan, had tried to
drive him nearly mad with frustrated desire and flaming jealousy,
and he smiled grimly to himself, as he thought that very likely in
this same manner had she tormented Lucan.</p>

<p>No doubt, after the manner of her kind, she played fast and
loose with the two of them. St. Rhue, who had a great contempt for
women and a great admiration for a fine soldier, a splendid man
like the Irishman, was minded for a moment to be generous with his
rival; after all he had conquered in his struggle with Solange de
Bonnac; she had said at last: "Come to me as soon as you can after
the battle"&mdash;she would be waiting for him in the little house at
Ballinasloe when he had beaten the English.</p>

<p>"Give me what I ask," demanded Lucan.</p>

<p>Almost St. Rhue was overwhelmed by this desperate, this quiet
passion; the man had said he wanted to die&mdash;and he was losing
Solange. But the thought of the woman he wanted and had for so long
lost, the woman who might only recently have lain in Lucan's arms
and mocked at him, St. Rhue, the thought that he was dealing with
one who had been a successful rival hardened him against the
Irishman's passion and his plea.</p>

<p>Yet the Frenchman had sufficient shrewdness not to outrage the
man utterly, for he knew Lucan's vast popularity with the Irish,
and on the Irish would depend to-morrow. He said bitterly
enough:</p>

<p>"Lord Lucan, I have not yet made my final decision for
to-morrow, when I have I will let you know."</p>

<p>"You can offer me no more than that?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And you will do nothing about Luttrell?"</p>

<p>"For the moment, no."</p>

<p>With that Lucan, who felt the strength of his passion suddenly
spent, turned and left the tent.</p>

<p>St. Rhue stared after him and quieted his hate and rage by
dwelling on the great victory he would soon win and the beautiful,
wilful and envied woman whom he would soon enjoy.</p>

<p>Lucan sent an express off to Tyrconnel in Limerick telling of
Luttrell's treachery, then shut himself up in his tent; he had no
orders, he did not know the plans for the battle, his troop was in
readiness; there was nothing for him to do; he would see no one and
his body-servant said he was sick; it was believed that he would
not fight on the morrow.</p>

<p>But towards evening he sent out for a priest; a poor friar was
found who went in to him, and was closed long in the inner tent.
The body-servant was frightened by the sound of the voice that rose
against that of the old, patient priest; he knew that none but his
master was there&mdash;"but that is not the voice of my master, or&mdash;"
The man crossed himself. "He is mad."</p>

<p>About that hour, when all the camp was in movement in
preparation for the battle, St. Rhue had had a short interview with
Luttrell and shown him the intercepted letter; Luttrell had treated
the affair lightly; he said "that it was a clumsy device on the
part of the Dutchman to destroy his credit with the French, that he
had never heard of Colonel Sebastian, and that he wondered that
Lord Lucan should do him so ill a turn, out of mere spite and
jealousy&mdash;perhaps he had even written the letter himself."</p>

<p>Brigadier Luttrell, cool, easy and ironically servile, with his
hat cocked insolently over his narrow squinting eyes, swaggered out
of the commander-in-chief's presence as if he had not a care in the
world. And he was no sooner gone than an Irish squireen named
O'Kelly and his shepherd, who had been waiting all day for the
chance, slipped into the pavilion of St. Rhue, who was intensely
irritated at seeing these two wretched figures before him; both
wore the native Irish dress and that soiled and torn.</p>

<p>But he quickly controlled his imperious and hasty temper for he
remembered that he must fight with Irish troops on the morrow and
how important the morrow was to him&mdash;the battle in which he must
conquer or die with loss of reputation, for he had resolved not to
survive a defeat, and he had only the Irish with whom to gain a
victory.</p>

<p>The grand gentleman, therefore, forced himself to ask the two
civilly: "what was their need in thus forcing themselves upon him
for an audience?"</p>

<p>The squireen, who gave his name as O'Kelly said "that he had
come to demand redress&mdash;some of the French soldiers had taken his
sheep."</p>

<p>This triviality, coming on the top of his heavy day's work, was
almost too much for St. Rhue's control. He said with the greatest
sternness in his difficult English:</p>

<p>"<i>Morbleu!</i> You might as well spare a few sheep for the
soldiers who are fighting to protect you, your lands and Ireland
itself!"</p>

<p>"What, your honour, is any of that to me?" persisted O'Kelly.
"We do not know who is fighting to protect us and who is here to
rob us. All the soldiers are thieves and we could have done without
the battles and camps." And, dropping his voice to what he
considered a persuasive note, he pleaded: "Will not your honour
give me back those sheep?"</p>

<p>St. Rhue's brief control left him. He exclaimed in French, which
he bade his valet translate:</p>

<p>"Be off! or I will hang you from the nearest tree, you and your
hireling, too!"</p>

<p>These were the methods he had been encouraged to use in the
Cevennes; it seemed to him intolerable that he should be afflicted
with such vermin as O'Kelly and his shepherd, and that they ought
really to be hanged for their effrontery in venturing to address
him at all; he was furious that they had got into his
presence...</p>

<p>O'Kelly turned to his shepherd and said in Irish:</p>

<p>"Mark the general."</p>

<p>"I will do so, your honour," replied the man in the same
language. "He's robbed you, master, ask him for the skins."</p>

<p>In a whining, cringing tone O'Kelly began to plead for the skins
of the sheep which had been slaughtered...</p>

<p>But St. Rhue, who knew that the soldiers were using sheep skins
to sleep on, peremptorily refused this last request, told the man
to begone and to be thankful that he was not first beaten and then
hanged as he ought to be...</p>

<p>The two left the tent and St. Rhue did not give them another
thought. After exchanging a few low sentences in Irish the pair
crossed the bog by ways only known to the natives, to the enemy's
lines, where the precaution of the far-seeing Ginckel had already
drawn everything up in order of battle. The Dutchman was of a very
different temperament and character to the Frenchman; he did not
refuse to see the two Irishmen when his <i>aide-de-camp</i> told
him they were inquiring for him under a plea of "important
news."</p>

<p>With that simplicity which might have been cunning or guile they
told their story through an interpreter to Ginckel.</p>

<p>The Dutchman made no comment.</p>

<p>He sent for an Irish artillery officer named Trench and told him
that these men "might be able to show him a mark worth shooting
at."</p>

<p>Trench was appointed to one of the batteries on the Aughrim side
and he took the shepherd and the squireen away with him to his
post.</p>

<p>"If there is nothing in it," remarked Ginckel placidly, "there
is no harm done; if there is something in it, it may be very much
worth while."</p>

<p>St. Rhue, having entirely put out of his mind the futile
incident of the insolent Irishmen, set himself to do his utmost to
ensure a victory on the following day. He even forced himself to
endeavour to win the hearts of the Irish, though he could not bend
himself to try to win the heart of the leader of the Irish, Lucan,
whom he did not see again that night. He ordered public masses to
be said and the priests to go from rank to rank, exhorting the
soldiers; he endeavoured to give both a national and a religious
character to the battle. But he cared nothing for the Faith or for
Ireland, he was merely thinking of himself, and how he had staked
all his future on the issue of the morrow&mdash;of how he must win a
victory before the news of Athlone got to Paris&mdash;of the laurels,
the Te Deum and the woman to follow that victory.</p>

<p>The Irish were astir early in the morning. St. Rhue rode forth,
impressive in his massed decorations, honours and splendid uniform,
to address his men who, to even his professional eye, looked
soldierly enough.</p>

<p>At that moment Lucan received his orders. He was to stay with
the reserves of cavalry behind the sloping hill on which stood the
dark Castle of Aughrim, and not to move unless he received a
positive command.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-53" id="ch1-53"></a>FIFTY-THREE</h2>

<p class="first">
SO THICK was the mist that it was midday before the two opposing
armies could see each other; one was on the hill of Aughrim, the
other on the opposite heights of Urrachree. The Marquis de St. Rhue
had done his best to ensure success and to win the Irish to whom
that success must be entrusted. In the early morning he had spoken,
through the drifting vapour that rose from the dark bog, to the
despised aliens who were his sole hope in the forthcoming fray.</p>

<p>Cold and haughty as he was, he contrived, through the pressure
of his own need, to put some passion into his words; little cared
he for the liberty of Ireland; but he cared greatly about the issue
of the day. Therefore, in passionate tones, he warned the soldiers
"that they were fighting for their religion, their liberty, their
honour."</p>

<p>The late unfortunate affairs, but too generally known, had
brought a reproach on the national character for bravery and
military qualities.</p>

<p>"Everywhere," declared the haughty Frenchman, "Irish soldiers
are mentioned with a sneer; and now," he added, "you have the
opportunity to retrieve the good name, the valour, of your
country."</p>

<p>Brigadier Luttrell translated this speech with force and
eloquence.</p>

<p>As St. Rhue sat with his staff officers and the inspired (he
hoped) soldiers around him, he felt a return of his usual superb
self-assurance and cold complacency. He had seen Lucan ride past to
take his post behind the hill of Castle Aughrim, and had remarked
with a sneer to Lord Galmoy:</p>

<p>"The man looks half-frantic. I have heard him very highly spoken
of, but I do not admire his character nor his behaviour&mdash;he spoke
to me very wildly&mdash;he has no idea of discipline."</p>

<p>Galmoy grinned.</p>

<p>"A little fanatic, Monseigneur, a man with impossible ideas in
his head. He has tried to fasten quarrels on me often enough,"
added Galmoy negligently, "but I was always careful to keep out of
his way. I did not want ruptures in the midst of a campaign."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i> the man boasts himself a patriot and a good
soldier, but it seems to me that before the summer is over he will
find himself cashiered or sharing the prison of the traitors and
rebels."</p>

<p>"What then will become of him?" asked Galmoy indifferently.</p>

<p>"He will probably be shot," said St. Rhue, thinking of Solange,
and, raising his glass, he surveyed the attempt by Ginckel to take
Urrachree, and he put the woman and her lover out of his mind.</p>

<p>The Irish eagerly repelled the advancing English.</p>

<p>St. Rhue was delighted to see that the cavalry was behaving with
the greatest gallantry and holding their own even when Portland's
Horse and two of the Duke of Wurtemburg's battalions went to the
assistance of the hard-pressed English; the struggle became
stationary, neither side gaining an advantage.</p>

<p>After a short pause Ginckel's troops again attacked the pass of
Urrachree. The fight continued desperately for two hours, the
volleying was incessant; the men became powder blind and deafened;
with the muzzles of the English against their breasts the Irish
furiously, slowly, reluctantly retreated, step by step through the
pass of Urrachree, falling back from hedge to hedge. St. Rhue,
seeing that this assault attacked his weakest point, ordered up
reinforcements from Aughrim.</p>

<p>Mackay, the Williamite general, at once observed this and how it
left the French centre exposed, and sent his infantry across the
bog; a feat which they accomplished, thigh-deep in the marsh, under
a murderous fire, driving the marksmen from behind the hedges until
they had reached the main line of the Irish front.</p>

<p>When the English had gone too far to retreat the Irish Horse,
under Galmoy, rushed down the hillside and drove the broken foe
back into the bog with a loss so enormous that the spot was always
known afterwards as "Bloody Hollow."</p>

<p>While St. Rhue, with intense satisfaction, was observing this
success through his glass, he received the news that the
Inniskillens, under Colonel St. John and Lord George Hamilton, had
struggled across the bog along the right, been ambushed and run
down by the cavalry and obliged to make a retreat, up to their
middles in mud and water, leaving many dead and wounded.</p>

<p>"So far," exulted the French commander-in-chief, "the English
left-centre is repulsed, the right has done nothing, the day is
ours, <i>mes enfants,"</i> he added, turning in his saddle to his
staff officers; "we will drive them before us to the very walls of
Dublin. There will be no need, after all, to call my Lord Lucan to
our assistance."</p>

<p>So intense was his hatred of the Irishman that in the moment of
his triumph this thought gave an added glow to his pleasure.
Putting his spy-glass to his eye again, he saw the regiments under
Mackay making a desperate onset towards the ruined castle of
Aughrim, the road to which was so narrow that only two horsemen
could ride abreast. St. Rhue had received one surprise in the
doggedness and perseverance of Ginckel before the walls of Athlone;
this was another. He watched, first with contempt, then amusement
and some excitement what appeared to be an impossible feat of arms.
The perseverance of the Dutchman was indeed amazing, for the
twilight was falling and the battle might have been considered
lost; but the Blues continued to flounder through the morass,
facing the effective fire of the Irish. As St. Rhue watched them
bogged, fall, rise and fall again, and still press on, he
exclaimed, letting the perspective glass fall from his eyes:</p>

<p>"What on earth can they mean by it?" Then his astonishment
turned to admiration and the experienced soldier exclaimed: "By
heavens, they are gallant fellows, and it is quite a pity that they
should thus court death." He looked again, all eagerness, and saw
the stubborn Blues lay down hurdles on the morass. He shrugged his
shoulders and remarked: "The more who pass the more will be
beaten." But the English had succeeded in fighting through the
worst part of the bog and they were quickly followed by a
magnificent advance on the part of Ruvigny's Horse and the sixth
and third Dragoon Guards to protect the Huguenot infantry, who were
defending themselves behind a <i>chevaux de frise</i> of the pikes,
which their sappers carried with them as a last defence; they had
no hope, but that of "selling their lives dearly."</p>

<p>The Irish cavalry were then outnumbered&mdash;Ruvigny's cavalry came
forward in an overwhelming sweeping charge across the dry ground
beyond the bog; the Irish broke, even Galmoy, who was at their
head, would have been glad then of the assistance of Lucan's
reserve; all seemed at hazard. The artillery on both sides was
useless, so intermingled were the forces.</p>

<p>St. Rhue was vexed but not shaken in his majestic
self-confidence, nor could he even at this crisis overcome his
hatred and jealousy of Lucan. He sent an <i>aide-de-camp</i> to
that general, bidding him send half his cavalry, but adding that he
was himself to remain with the other half behind the hill; and, to
prevent any impetuous action which he was always fearing on the
part of the Irishman, he told his messenger to add: "The day was
going well and the demand for half the reserve was a mere
precaution," and, insultingly, "that the Irish fought like men of
another nation."</p>

<p>Lucan sent half his magnificent horse immediately. Saint Rhue
left his observation post and proceeded to put himself at the head
of these reserves; he intended to meet the English squadron which
had just almost incredibly fought through the morass, pressing on
to the very snaphances of the Irish thrust through the hedges. "It
is victory," cried St. Rhue, "it is most assuredly victory! I am
glad they have been such fools, we shall kill the more of them and
it will make the day more decisive."</p>

<p>Ginckel was indeed fighting desperately to save himself from
utter rout; he had thrown forward his last resources to help the
masses of men, fighting fiercely, enmeshed in the bog into which
they were being driven back from the high slopes and ditches round
the castle.</p>

<p>"Yes!" cried St. Rhue, tossing his hat with the panache of white
plumes above his head. "I shall beat them back to the gates of
Dublin! It is three times they have been repulsed."</p>

<p>He saw with pleasure one colour after another, English,
Huguenot, Dutch, falter, sink and fall into the mud...Mackay was
making a grim last stand beyond the boggy trenches beneath the
castle, where he had contrived to fight his way and where he was
now trapped...</p>

<p>St. Rhue, observing the veteran Scot's plight, was furious that
O'Bourke, commanding in the castle, did not demolish at once this
audacious cavalry...</p>

<p>But O'Bourke was helpless; he had discovered that his bullet
chests were empty&mdash;there were no bayonets and the balls were too
large for the cannon; treachery or negligence as dangerous! The
Irish filled their carbines with chopped ramrods and buttons...</p>

<p>St. Rhue saw that the moment had come to make a decisive charge;
he put himself at the head of the cavalry, which, had he not been
inflamed by jealous hate, he should have allowed Lucan to lead.</p>

<p>It was the hour of sunset. Through the incessant volleying and
the heavy thud of the cannon from Ginckel's defiant batteries rang
out the angelus from the little church of Aughrim. The pale sky,
from which the mist had long since swept away, was flecked with red
stains in the west, which lay reflected in vivid patches in the
pools of the purple-brown bog; the bent and withered thorns beside
the distant hovels were gilded with a false and transient gold, the
whole landscape, a fitting background for the obstinate battle,
seemed to express nothing but the burden of the mournful futility
of the earth and existence; it was the saddest hour between waning
day and darkening night. But St. Rhue felt no melancholy.</p>

<p>His heart swelled to think that he would be able now to redeem
the disgrace of Athlone and to return to honours, advancement, and
the king's smile, to the arms of Solange de Bonnac&mdash;eh, there would
be something to lay at her feet!</p>

<p>He had, after all, snatched high good fortune and all the spoils
of a victory out of these hateful bogs where his duty had so
unfortunately led him, and that without help from Lucan, his rival
in love and war, who had endeavoured to steal from him both the
creature for whom he lusted and the honours he considered his
own..."The day is ours, <i>mes enfants!</i> They are broken, let us
beat them to some purpose!" Leading his fresh cavalry he rode
slowly down the hill.</p>

<p>At this moment, as the Frenchman, with the fading sunlight
bright upon him, put himself directly before his camp at the head
of his troops, one of two ragged earth-coloured men crouching
beside a battery on the Aughrim side, remarked to the officer in
command:</p>

<p>"Master, I see the Frenchman."</p>

<p>It was the shepherd of the squireen who had been repulsed so
haughtily by St. Rhue the previous night. He spoke in Irish and
Trench impatiently asked "what he meant?"</p>

<p>O'Kelly interpreted "that the shepherd had seen St. Rhue leaving
his observation post and coming forward at the head of the cavalry
down the hill."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked Trench, with his hand on the gun.</p>

<p>"There," replied the shepherd, "as fine as a bandsman in front
of the Horse!"</p>

<p>St. Rhue was a magnificent figure in the full panoply of a
French general; with gold and azure and lace, flying plumes and
scarves, and tasselled gauntlets, an unsheathed sword in his hand
along which the last light dripped red, his dark curls blown back
from his handsome, imperious face, which was flushed with the
anticipation of triumph. His magnificently-appointed horse, fresh
and impatient for the charge, was caracoling in the finest fashion
of the <i>haute école.</i></p>

<p>Without a word Captain Trench himself directed the laying of the
gun and sighted it. He found it to be too low, for the front wheels
of the carriage had sunk into the soft, boggy ground.</p>

<p>He then sat down and pulled off his long, stiff, hard jackboots,
placed them as a hurdle under the wheels, and then sighted the
gorgeous figure pointed out by the Irishmen.</p>

<p>O'Kelly and his shepherd grinned at each other with malign
excitement. The gun was fired; for a second they could see nothing,
a puff of smoke obscured their view.</p>

<p>When this dissolved Trench called out impatiently:</p>

<p>"Is the Frenchman hit?"</p>

<p>"He's on his horse yet," said the shepherd; "you've only blown
the hat off him. No! by the Holy Virgin! But the head's in it, too,
for I see it rolling down the hill!"</p>

<p>Trench looked and saw that St. Rhue's splendid horse had swerved
round, then charged forward; but the steed only carried a headless
trunk which clung to the saddle for a few strides, then was tossed
off beside an old twisted hawthorn, from which gunfire had long
since burnt off all leaves. Down the slope towards the ranks of De
Ruvigny's straggling cavalry rolled the head of St. Rhue, plumed,
bedizened, the brilliant curls bloody, a smile of triumph fixed in
a stiff grin on the writhing lips.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-54" id="ch1-54"></a>FIFTY-FOUR</h2>

<p class="first">
THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF was slain in full sight of the advancing
Irish cavalry and the effect on them was like a spell, as if at a
given signal they broke and reeled.</p>

<p>The body of St. Rhue, gleaming in the sunset in all its
magnificent decorations, was taken up, covered with a common
soldier's frieze cloak, and carried to the rear. De Tess, now in
command, gave no orders; the other leaders, falling back before
their wavering ranks, did nothing. A deserter, scrambling across
the bog, took the news of St. Rhue's death to the enemy, it leaped
from rank to rank till it reached Ginckel himself. The Dutchman,
who had been in grim despair, ordered another onslaught on the
dismayed enemy. De Ruvigny had not needed this; he had seen the
headless body fall beside the hawthorn and had charged with
desperation, with elation, with hope...</p>

<p>Only one leader among the Irish-French forces gathered on those
dreadful slopes behaved with fortitude and promptitude. Piers
Butler Lord Galmoy led the remnants of his horse in a frantic
charge; on his loyalty and courage there was at least no stain.</p>

<p>Ruvigny's cavalry, however, swept him back with irresistible
force. The Irish right wing, completely broken, fled across the
darkening morass.</p>

<p>During a murderous and fiercely-contested battle the balance had
hung now this way, now that; but with the death of St. Rhue fortune
definitely threw her favours into the lap of the English.</p>

<p>The entire Irish front quivered, hesitated, broke and fled&mdash;the
defeat became a flight.</p>

<p>The sunset-flecked dusk fell on ten thousand corpses strewn
across the hill, pastures and bogs; for Ginckel's men fought with
fury; they rushed to victory over the heaped bodies of their
enemies.</p>

<p>Lucan, half a mile away behind the hill, knew nothing of this
disaster; as at the Boyne, he waited for the orders that never
came. The last express from St. Rhue that had asked for half his
forces had brought an insolent message of self-satisfied assurance
of success; the first Lucan knew of the rout at Aughrim was when
the scattered infantry came running over the hill.</p>

<p>Mackay's Horse had driven back Tyrconnel's Foot and Luttrell's
Dragoons, (who had continued to make an obstinate resistance), thus
turning the Irish left flank. Galmoy, fighting like a devil, was
trapped between Mackay and Ginckel. When Lucan with his fresh
reserves swept round the hill of Aughrim the battle was over, and
the Irish in full rout.</p>

<p>Ginckel's perseverance, Mackay's skill and Ruvigny's magnificent
charge had crushed the last hopes of Ireland on the slopes of
Aughrim.</p>

<p>"Where," cried Sarsfield, like a man crazed; "where are Tessé,
D'Usson, Galmoy?"</p>

<p>Galmoy was a prisoner, he was told, no one knew what had become
of the Frenchmen. The English had captured cannon, tents, baggage
and field equipage; standards and colours by the armful. The battle
had become a massacre.</p>

<p>There was nothing left for Lucan to do but to rally the
fugitives and draw them off towards Limerick. He wheeled and swept
away, followed by what remained of the army got together by St.
Rhue. The Irish railed round him as naturally as round a national
flag; even his enemies wrote of him that he "performed miracles,
and if he was not killed or taken it was no fault of his own."</p>

<p>Time ceased for Lucan; the long hour of twilight seemed the dim
light of eternity. His own secret soul marvelled at his own energy,
decision, rapidity of action. He seemed to see himself, as if he
stared at another man conducting that frightful retreat, not only
of a defeated army but of a vanquished people.</p>

<p>Toby O'Hogan had come to his side and was ably seconding him.
Lucan accepted without surprise the presence of the rapparee among
his regular staff.</p>

<p>The progress was slow along the narrow road; to hasten, to step
aside was to risk being sucked into the bog. Lucan envied Galmoy
whom he had hated. Piers Butler had been taken fighting fiercely
with defiance on his lips; he had been able on that bloody field to
uphold the ancient honour of Ireland.</p>

<p>The merciful dark seemed so long coming. The Irish detachment
under Lucan fought as they retreated; others, in uttermost
confusion, ran for the causeways. The ditches were levelled with
the fields by the piled-up corpses.</p>

<p>Shrieks of desolate and limitless agony rose from the
battlefield, cries of intolerable pain from mangled horse and man.
Amidst the drifting mist stars twinkled through the
obscurity...Sarsfield once or twice dashed his hand across his
eyes, and in that stale battle smoke his morning thoughts returned.
He could scarcely distinguish the real from the unreal, the seen
from the unseen; his mind was breaking through a deep thicket of
visions, dreams and memories; rage and agony had made him tired,
horribly tired.</p>

<p>A party of French, even then still insolent, pushed through the
fugitives; they bore the magnificent, headless body of St. Rhue,
wrapped in the common, bloody mantle. At this sight O'Hogan shouted
out:</p>

<p>"Take him to the dainty harlot whom he envied! She'll be waiting
for him, all clean and painted!"</p>

<p>But Lucan put his hand to his eyes as past him was carried the
body of the man whose pride and jealousy had cost the liberty of
Ireland, as Lucan wildly thought.</p>

<p>The camp followers and plunderers were already about the fringes
of the fight, the naked bodies of the men looked like sheep in the
twilight...Lucan recalled how Ishma had once spoken of "bodies like
flocks on the hills."</p>

<p>The pursuit slackened. Ginckel was pausing to bury his dead,
Mackay to give solemn thanks to the God who had gotten him the
victory; but the Irish dead would remain to rot above the earth
they could not save.</p>

<p>As they neared Lough Derg they were clear of the slaughter, but
the wounded dropped at every pace. By a sudden lantern flare Lucan
saw Mons. de Bonnac fallen in a ditch; his old wound had broken
out, and he was fast dying. Lucan stooped to give him the
vinaigrette of the Huguenot officer whom he had so fantastically
thought might be the Prince of Orange. The Frenchman pressed his
hand, said that "philosophy now stood him in good stead," and bid
Lucan hasten on. Before he could remount De Bonnac was dead, prone
in the mud-filled ditch; the little <i>abbé</i> who accompanied him
everywhere caught him to his bosom.</p>

<p>By the dawn they were near Killaloe and out of sight of any
pursuit. Lucan believed that Ginckel, after securing the passes of
the Shannon, would make for Galway which lay in his rear, and which
he must know to be poorly garrisoned and full of careful men, rich
from the trade with France...The news somehow came through the
press of struggling fugitives. D'Usson had made for Galway with
what French he could bring off from the disaster. But the Irish
continued to press on towards Limerick.</p>

<p>"I can ride no more," said Lucan; he leant from his saddle
across his horse's neck. O'Hogan had him out of the line of march
into a fair little field grown with ash trees. With the dawn came a
wind; at once there was light and movement in the heavens, clouds
gossamer as thistledown veiled the setting stars; the nightjar from
a dark thicket gave his lonely cry; the solitary bird seemed angry
at the noisy passing of the fugitives along the road.</p>

<p>Lucan slipped from the saddle and lay on the ground beneath the
ash trees. O'Hogan tethered the animals and sat down beside him.
Lucan noticed that the rapparee rode a strange horse.</p>

<p>"Where is John Luby, O'Hogan?"</p>

<p>"He broke his legs on a hurdle in the bog, and I shot him."</p>

<p>"Oh, this has been a dreadful day!"</p>

<p>"Have you lost heart at last, Lord Lucan?"</p>

<p>"It seems"&mdash;he struck his breast&mdash;"as if I have no heart to
lose&mdash;all empty here!"</p>

<p>O'Hogan saw that his sleeve was wet and dark.</p>

<p>"You have been wounded&mdash;you are sick with loss of blood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have I? I feel nothing. I can do no more."</p>

<p>"You have done all any one could, Lord Lucan."</p>

<p>"And all in vain." He dragged himself up, but fell against the
tree trunk. "I feel as weak as a woman in childbirth&mdash;all my
strength is gone."</p>

<p>He looked towards the east, and in the pure light his distorted
face looked (O'Hogan thought) unhuman.</p>

<p>"Another day&mdash;the sun to rise on this! O Holy Ghost, O pitiful
Jesu! look down on Thy slaughtered people! O God save Ireland in
her bitter extremity!"</p>

<p>He leant against the rapparee; from behind the hedge came the
sound of the flight from Aughrim. The ash leaves swayed and
shivered, the strengthening light revealed lovely flowers in the
fresh, dewy grass. Through the broken hedge, the exhausted, the
maimed, crept to die; and following the fugitives came the howls
and bayings of the great dogs who hurried to feast on the
corpses.</p>

<p>Heavy against the breast of the rapparee Lucan said:</p>

<p>"Now you must tell me who it was."</p>

<p>"Not now, and you without strength."</p>

<p>"I shall have strength to go to her&mdash;is she alive?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday she was alive, and safe in Limerick."</p>

<p>"I shall have strength to be avenged. Who was it?</p>

<p>"Lord Lucan, do not force me to say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You promised&mdash;after the battle. The battle is over." Sarsfield
raised his head with a mad, atrocious look. "Tell me."</p>

<p>"Well," said Galloping O'Hogan sombrely, "a man has no right to
be cheated of his revenge...It was Lord Galmoy&mdash;and Brigadier
Luttrell&mdash;and a woman."</p>

<p>As Lucan, still staring at him, did not seem to understand, the
rapparee repeated: "Galmoy, Luttrell and the damned harlot, De
Bonnac's wife."</p>

<p>Lucan muttered something inarticulate. Toby O'Hogan looking down
at the grass told what he knew of the rape of Ishma O'Donaghoe.
Told what he had cleverly and with infinite pains discovered&mdash;the
murder of the priest and the bailiff, the flight of Mrs. Begg after
her charge, the careful setting in order of everything in Lucan, so
that no trace of violence might appear. It was no doubt
thoughtfully planned by Luttrell, Galmoy not having the cool head
for such an affair&mdash;"as for what had followed&mdash;" Toby O'Hogan
ceased to speak.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," whispered Lucan, "the women at
Ballyneety?"</p>

<p>He turned away and lay prone on the grass, his fingers in his
hair.</p>

<p>"They shall die for it," said Toby O'Hogan, bending over him. "I
swear on the rood they shall die for it."</p>

<p>"I must do that," muttered the fallen man.</p>

<p>"A duel?" asked the rapparee. "The gentlemen's way?"</p>

<p>A savage dog, maddened by hunger and blood, was dragging a yet
warm and shuddering corpse across the meadow. O'Hogan drew his
pistol from his belt and shot the animal cleanly through the head;
as the smoke and yelps ceased, he said:</p>

<p>"Like that. At least for Henry Luttrell."</p>

<p>"Help me up," cried Lucan; he struggled to a sitting posture and
dragged the soiled linen from his throat. "Those two had Ishma, and
after them&mdash;" He turned sharply on his side again.</p>

<p>O'Hogan, peering over him, found that he had fainted.</p>

<p>The rapparee, always well provided for the chances of a wild and
desperate life, had both vinegar and brandy about his person. With
gentle care he administered to his friend and presently got him up
again, leaning half against himself, half against the ash trees;
the sunlight was glittering in the clear air, the flies began to
buzz over the bodies of the man and dog sprawling together on the
crushed flowers.</p>

<p>"What is it all for, O'Hogan? What can we, unambitious men, ever
gain that is worth what we suffer?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. I was content with a small place to eat and
sleep in, a horse and a little land; my own people and freedom to
pray and ride as I would, a little estate of two hundred a year. I
was happy and counted an honest gentleman. But they are all
murdered, all I loved, and all my pleasant hours withered like
leaves in spring when a great storm blows in from the angry ocean.
And I in my turn have slain many; and all is so dark I know not if
I may say, 'Jesu, forgive thy poor rogue and thief.'"</p>

<p>"I must go to Limerick." Lucan struggled to his feet. "She is
there&mdash;and Luttrell."</p>

<p>The rapparee rose also and went to the horses, his figure was
dark and heavy in the blue air.</p>

<p>"There is Tyrconnel, too," he said quietly. "You must make your
report to him, Lord Lucan, you must show him what you brought off
from Aughrim."</p>

<p>"Can I do it?"</p>

<p>"You can do it, Lord Lucan." He gave the other man his brandy
flask, but Lucan put it aside, mounted and gathered up the
reins.</p>

<p>"How long have we been here, O'Hogan? My senses have been
clouded."</p>

<p>"Not half an hour."</p>

<p>They rode through the broken hedge and took the trampled road to
Limerick.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-55" id="ch1-55"></a>FIFTY-FIVE</h2>

<p class="first">
A SOFT muffled sound met Lucan as he ascended the dark stairs.
Her voice, surely, crying out for him. He leant against the door
behind which O'Hogan said she might be found, but soon controlled
himself to enter softly. He could not know then, but he remembered
afterwards with tender gratitude, how finely, for such a time of
war and such a pitch of fortune, the room was decked. The light was
dim, the shadows golden, and he saw here and there a holy picture,
a crucifix, a golden vessel on the mantelshelf, a <i>prie-dieu</i>
with silver lilies worked on the back, and the rich hangings of a
bed, old, worn, but cherished, smelling of preserving lavender and
showing here and there a tarnished gold thread.</p>

<p>By that bed Lucan stood mute. For a second, in his lonely
hopelessness, he had a curious spark of consolation, as if
somewhere, somehow, there might be deliverance, that in this great
and horrible darkness, so encompassing that it seemed a witchery,
there might yet rise some shining star of hope.</p>

<p>He glimpsed a nun the other side of the bed, one of the Poor
Clares whom His Majesty had permitted to establish themselves in
Dublin, and who, with the falling of that city to the Protestants,
had followed the army.</p>

<p>He took no heed of her whatever, nor did he see the woman in the
plain mantle who was behind her. He put back the curtains and
looked down at Ishma, lying straight and narrow in the noble bed,
propped on fine cushions covered with linen and lace. Over her was
a glittering coverlet on which was embroidered his own arms in new
glistening colours. He had seen it before, he had seen some one
working this design, but he was not surprised to find it here, and
the circumstances when he had last beheld it would not come back to
his mind. He looked monstrous tall as he stood there in the taper
light which had been set in a far corner so as not to trouble the
eyes of the dying girl. His uniform was splashed with bog mud, he
had put off his hat, his scarf, his sword, his gloves; his hair
fell unclasped over his shoulders; his face, always pale, appeared
quite bloodless; he looked ten years older than before his visit to
the hut on the bogs, before Aughrim. His bare duty had occupied all
the day; this and that to-do in Limerick for the garrison, for the
press of fugitives; this was his first half-hour of freedom.
O'Hogan had told him that she lived, O'Hogan had brought him to the
house by Baal's Bridge, that was scarred by the cannonade of the
first siege.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the nun (he thought it was the nun who spoke, at
least it was a voice which came out of the shadows from the other
side of the bed), "speak to her, she will not long understand
anything, if indeed she understands now."</p>

<p>Lucan went on his knees on the bed-step and gathered the
frail-limbed, the ruined beauty which had once been so gay and
sweet, into his arms.</p>

<p>"I have never ceased to love you, you must understand that. So
much came between, I have been so unstable and understood none of
it. I would have died that this did not happen, I must die because
it has happened. Speak to me, Ishma, but one word to take away with
me."</p>

<p>The wasted figure stirred faintly in his embrace and the woman
the other side of the bed whispered:</p>

<p>"You must take her up closer, you must press her to your bosom
and kiss her; you must make her understand you are here. She has
waited all day."</p>

<p>Lucan was not conscious of the bystanders; he muttered: "I thank
you." And drew Ishma to his shoulder, her hair, now so harsh and
colourless, fell over his gold epaulette. Her face, which was like
a wan reflection in bog water of the face he had seen last under
the may trees at Lucan, lay close to his, there was a bandage
across her brow. He felt her feeble heart, her feeble breast.</p>

<p>"Know me, love me," he pleaded.</p>

<p>Ireland gone...Ishma gone...failure...his whole life...his whole
love...All his world blown away like the smoke after the battle
slowly disappearing across the desolation of the morass.</p>

<p>Her eyes which had so often looked at him with innocent love and
ingenuous kindness turned on him through the death-glaze. He was
aware that she stared into darkness and knew him not.</p>

<p>"Kiss her," urged the woman in the farther darkness. "Hold her
close."</p>

<p>Ishma spoke, so low that none but he could hear, and even to him
the words were like a whisper out of a dream:</p>

<p>"Water&mdash;a little water."</p>

<p>He called out for this, and a small gold cup was put into his
hand. He held it to her lips, but she shook her head. "Water to
wash&mdash;water to be clean."</p>

<p>She turned away from him and sat up with sudden strength. They
brought her pure water in a silver bowl and set it on her knees.
Lucan guided her weak hands and she bathed them, slowly, gravely,
passing them in and out of the water as if she performed a
ritual.</p>

<p>"To be clean, to be clean," she repeated. There was grandeur in
her words and her action; she held herself like one of royal birth.
All were hushed while she put her wet fingers over her scarred
face, over her blind eyes; it was a defiled queen who performed
stately ablutions. "The hawthorn blooms were very clean," she said
sternly, addressing none; "but they lasted such a little while. I
used to hold them in my hands and they were soon gone. My dear
never came. I go alone."</p>

<p>The nun moved nearer the amber light of the faltering taper.</p>

<p>"She has received the <i>Viaticum</i>," she whispered; "the
priest waits in the other chamber if she would see him again But
the woman beside the nun who kept her hood over her face,
commanded:</p>

<p>"Leave her with her lover."</p>

<p>With a dull and desperate obstinacy the kneeling man
thought:</p>

<p>"She must not die, she will not die...Ireland will not be
defeated, Ireland will not be enslaved&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could not command his thoughts; magnificent images raced
through his mind, he felt as if he were again in that swift rout
riding his horse flecked with blood, matted with sweat, through the
curses and falling colours, and flashing weapons, again lying on
the flowery grass while the nightjar whistled in the thicket.</p>

<p>Through the open door of the inner chamber he saw a fine spiral
of incense; the perfume came gratefully to his nostrils. He tried
to say a psalm, a prayer; he tried to repeat the charm first spoken
under the black yew at Irrelagh, but his lips remained closed. In
his heart only beat the words: "Thy face towards mine and mine
turned from all others."</p>

<p>Sternly, gravely, Ishma put her hands through the water
whispering: "Clean&mdash;clean&mdash;as I was before they took me away."</p>

<p>She fell back and the women caught up and removed the basin as
the man snatched her close.</p>

<p>In that moment he was conscious of all the suffering of all
Ireland, like a brand on his brow. He kissed Ishma on the forehead,
and she sighed and died there leaning on him, her hands and face
still wet.</p>

<p>It was some minutes before he laid her back on the pillows. All
his actions were mechanical and, as he thought, against his own
volition; he noticed how her poor body, so disfigured by disease
and shame, was beautifully arrayed with heavy lace, azure and lilac
ribbons. The woman on the other side of the bed leaned forward and
put a gold-bordered handkerchief over the dead girl's face after
she had closed her dimmed eyes. As she did so her own hood fell
aside, and Lucan became conscious of the presence of others besides
Ishma in the room; he recognised his wife. "Who told you?" he asked
stupidly.</p>

<p>"Mr. O'Hogan told me," she answered, "to whom else should he
come? A woman was needed for this service." She added: "I did what
I could and I was glad to come."</p>

<p>"You heard what I said&mdash;you know it all?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then this was not easy for you."</p>

<p>"I hope it was not difficult," said Honor, "I have so many
faults, and of late they have been heavy on me. I pray that I may
have learnt at least charity."</p>

<p>Lucan leant against the bed-post and stammered out he knew not
what. His wife came round the old, rich curtain and took his
arm.</p>

<p>"Defeat&mdash;utter rout," he muttered; "and this my love laid
low."</p>

<p>"How I have been to blame!" sighed Honor. "I played my own heart
false and yours! But you have lived with me and slept with me, and
we know each other's secrets. Bear with me a little."</p>

<p>The taper flame bent and flickered as if a cold wind had
suddenly entered the room. The prayers, the incense, the kindness
of Honor, the brave richness of the room were very sweet to Lucan.
Above the thin, dead hands that Honor folded gently one above the
other he saw bracelets that had once belonged to his wife.</p>

<p>"You will not take them away?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, I am not so poor as that."</p>

<p>He lifted up the gold-bordered handkerchief and looked once more
on that strange, sweet sadness&mdash;her dead face.</p>

<p>He said stupidly:</p>

<p>"Galmoy&mdash;where is Galmoy? And Luttrell&mdash;Henry Luttrell? Defeated
there, too," muttered Lucan, with a mad glance.</p>

<p>Honor went on her knees and whispered a prayer by the bed. She
found it difficult to confine herself to the formula of piety, the
words that beat in her brain and almost on her lips were: "I might
have prevented this, I might have prevented so much. O pride and
ignorance, folly and grief!"</p>

<p>There was little time even for this sorrow; the needs of a
nation pressed. Ginckel was known to be preparing to march on
Galway&mdash;and who in Galway was to be trusted?</p>

<p>Lucan was wanted everywhere. Was Limerick to hold out as before?
Could he inspire Ireland again?...The messengers came knocking at
the death chamber.</p>

<p>"I will see her laid in holy turf in the shade of Saint Mary,"
said Honor. She knew that as yet her husband was hardly aware of
her presence or of her ministrations to Ishma, but as she followed
him down the stairs he turned and put his hand on hers, and each
felt that in their desolation they had at least one friend.</p>

<p>Lucan turned from the others, and sought out O'Hogan who had
followed him close all day.</p>

<p>"Where is Luttrell&mdash;Henry Luttrell?"</p>

<p>"I cannot find him. I think he knows and is skulking away. I
have seen several of his dragoons, and they say he was riding to
Limerick."</p>

<p>Lucan went to Tyrconnel who, overwhelmed by work and misfortune,
was dictating despatches in the castle.</p>

<p>"My God! Lord Lucan, you look as if your business was done! Have
you the falling sickness or a mortal wound?"</p>

<p>"Where is Brigadier Luttrell?"</p>

<p>"He rode into Limerick a couple of hours ago and came here, as
fresh and insolent as you please."</p>

<p>"Where is he? I must see him immediately."</p>

<p>"Where d'ye expect him to be?" asked Tyrconnel dryly. He really
thought that Aughrim had unsettled Lucan's wits. "I had him
arrested at once. He is in the dungeons, and it will go hard with
me if I don't get him hanged&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Arrested?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. Did not you yourself send me his damned treasonable
correspondence with Ginckel?"</p>

<p>"I forgot," said Lucan stupidly, "it went altogether out of my
mind."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-56" id="ch1-56"></a>FIFTY-SIX</h2>

<p class="first">
A FEW DAYS after Aughrim, Galway fell; the seven poor regiments
under D'Usson and Lord Dillon which comprised the garrison
surrendered to Ginckel. The soldiers marched to Limerick with their
arms, six pieces of cannon, drums beating, colours flying, match
lighted and bullet in mouth.</p>

<p>Ginckel wished to hurry to Limerick before the summer campaign
was over and he had granted easy terms; the secret instructions of
his master were indeed to grant easy terms to all who reasonably
submitted. Yet there were those who thought there had been some
treachery in the quick surrender of Galway, for D'Usson was a
friend of Tyrconnel and Dillon was his nephew.</p>

<p>Ginckel advanced on Cahirconlish and there paused, hoping that
Limerick would fall without a siege. Deserter after deserter joined
him. All had the same tales and those ever pleasant ones for the
Dutch general to hear; tales of suspicion and strife, bitterness
and quarrels in the city that was the scene of the last stand of
the conquered, tales of the trial of Henry Luttrell and his
sentence of death, of the mad behaviour of Lucan who was a changed
man since Aughrim, of Tyrconnel, ageing, stricken, but noisy and
valiant still, and of D'Usson yet at this desperate juncture giving
his banquets and balls...</p>

<p>Lucan saw the body of Ishma O'Donaghoe laid in the shade of
Saint Mary's Church; it was the day before that appointed for the
hanging of Brigadier Luttrell. All was confusion, no one knew whom
to trust; many were involved in Luttrell's treason, nor could their
names be come at. Tyrconnel tried to animate all to offer a
resistance to the victors of Aughrim who would not wait much longer
patiently at Cahirconlish; he was assured, he declared, of fresh
help from France; but there were many who did not trust him, nor
any man.</p>

<p>When Lucan came from Ishma's grave he met a woman whom he had
forgotten. She stood directly in his path; though he did not know
it she had been following him&mdash;Olivia de Bonnac.</p>

<p>"Come with me," he said. He took her by the wrist and led her
into the nearest inn, and into the dirty parlour at the back which
looked on to the dull waters of the Shannon. Since her husband had
fallen, undistinguished among the many distinguished dead, since
her lover, St. Rhue, had dropped headless by the stunted hawthorn
on Aughrim slopes, there were not many to concern themselves much
about Madame de Bonnac.</p>

<p>"What do you want with me?" she asked.</p>

<p>He leant against the patched and broken wall; she sank into a
mean chair by the stained table. Outside was the sound of drums and
trumpets, as D'Usson's guards made what parade they could.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, Lord Lucan?" she repeated.</p>

<p>Madame de Bonnac was no longer so bold as she used to be; there
was a dimness about the brilliancy of her spirits, about the
radiance of her beauty. She drew back against her chair and caught
round her white throat a mantle no longer costly.</p>

<p>He thought of all the piled-up dead in Ireland, and of Ishma
beneath the hasty sods in Limerick churchyard, he forgot almost the
woman before him, forgot on what impulse he had drawn her into this
private room, even what he had to say to her. What could he have
now to say to any about Ishma and Ireland?</p>

<p>She took courage from his silence, thinking that his spirit
failed him, and she shrugged and grimaced with something of her old
arrogance, and ventured to stamp her foot, demanding:</p>

<p>"Why have you behaved to me so unmannerly?"</p>

<p>He glanced at her then with a fierce enough fire in his
wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>She shrank back quickly, with the odd thought that he would
spring forward and strike her on the cheek, on the mouth, but he
did not move.</p>

<p>"Who was it?" he asked. "You, Galmoy and Luttrell?"</p>

<p>She laughed shrilly.</p>

<p>"All without your reach. Galmoy, a prisoner of the English;
Luttrell a prisoner of the Irish, that is if he be not hanged or
shot already; and I, a woman!"</p>

<p>"Woman!" repeated Lucan. "I have seen desolate women seated by
swollen corpses and famished children sucking offal...I thought I
had somewhat to say to you, but I find no words will come."</p>

<p>"You pay the penalty for being a fool," she replied, her
vehemence gathering force as she saw that she was safe with him.
"You would not serve Luttrell's purpose or mine. I wooed you for
years in vain. Do you think that a woman like myself is to be with
impunity put aside? You thought that I was your dainty doll, a dead
image in a shrine. It was very dangerous for you to forget that I
was a woman. Luttrell might have made you a king, or as near a king
as is no matter, and I might have made you as fine a mistress as
man ever had. But, no, you must mock, mope and hesitate, and
scruple&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough!" cried Lucan, raising his hand and letting it fall
again. "Enough, I pray you!"</p>

<p>He turned and leant against the wall of the tavern parlour as if
he was spent. Even to the fierce bitter enmity of the woman who
contemptuously regarded him, there was something terrible in so
much weakness overcoming so much strength.</p>

<p>Never in her eyes had he looked less magnificent than he did
now, his heart and soul gone from him, his bright hair falling over
his gray-hued face, the lips set slackly, the brilliant eyes
bloodshot, his hands hanging as if they were of no use to him. She
gazed at him in a wondering curiosity; almost rather would she have
had him upbraid and reprove her; strike and maltreat her; she would
like to have been handled by him even in rage. She too had lost
everything, she admitted complete defeat.</p>

<p>"This is an accursed country," she exclaimed, "would that I had
never set foot in it. I shall leave behind here all I valued."</p>

<p>And then he answered her as he turned to leave her:</p>

<p>"What you value, madam, may be found in any place."</p>

<p>He noticed that a great clock over the mantelshelf was ticking,
that the sound was intolerable. She made to speak again, but he
left her to visit Brigadier Luttrell's prison in Limerick
Castle.</p>

<p>Even before Aughrim, Tyrconnel had been writing desperately to
King James to procure for the Irish Government as much as a
thousand pistoles. Now he found the deserted Irish were left
entirely to their own resources and exertions, maddened by leaders
whose views were differing and distracted. The distant king himself
had remarked that he was "not disposed to make further use of such
ill-suited and jarring instruments." Tyrconnel was bent with age
and weighed down with corpulency, but he kept up his spirits and
was very active.</p>

<p>It was well known that only Patrick Sarsfield, that darling of
the army, had prevented Limerick from surrendering at the first
siege. Now, seeing a nation disunited and hopeless, Tyrconnel
divided his remnant of power with Lucan. Zealous and anxious to
give an example of patriotism he had urged on the trial and
sentence of Luttrell who lay in the dungeon of Limerick Castle
under sentence of death. The court martial found that his treason
had been made manifest; with almost insolent boldness and
indifference he had been dealing with the Williamites, offering to
betray the interests of his own party in return for the money and
honours which were eagerly enough offered. For General Ginckel had
been commanded to be at no expense in procuring adherence to his
master's cause. His great object was not so much the conquest as
the pacification of Ireland. And all, Roman Catholics and
Protestants alike, might have almost what they would if they would
live peaceably under the new government. But, however desperate
might seem the affairs of Ireland, Tyrconnel, the ageing, heavy,
sick man, continued to show great activity, running about repairing
the fortifications of the town, establishing magazines and
endeavouring to enforce discipline, making the officers and
soldiers take an oath of fidelity to James. At the same time he
sent an express to St. Germains begging speedy succour or leave to
make terms, yet all the main business he left to Lucan and no
longer contradicted him in anything.</p>

<p>So it was easy for Lucan to do what he would in Limerick; he had
more real power than he had ever enjoyed before, and no one
questioned him when he said he would visit the man who had been
Brigadier Luttrell of Luttrelstown, one of the proudest of Irish
gentlemen and his own friend. Nor was any demur raised when he took
with him Toby O'Hogan, who appeared openly since the capture of
Galmoy.</p>

<p>That evening the Marquis D'Usson was giving a banquet to the
viceregal court, Lucan alone did not attend it. Some thought it a
generosity and some a meanness in him that he should prefer the
company of his disgraced and doomed friend to the festival.</p>

<p>Henry Luttrell then had twenty-four hours to live. He had
rejected the ministrations of a priest, declaring that he was
"above all the superstitions of men."</p>

<p>As Lucan entered the dungeon, which was a decent enough room
though with cold gray walls and scant furniture. ("Far finer,"
thought Lucan, "than the hovel where I found Ishma.") Luttrell was
seated by the window; falling full upon his person was the August
sunshine, which streamed through a vapour of late afternoon, yellow
as run honey. The prisoner, looking up, could see the top of a
tree, gold where the sunshine caught it on nether side, tossing
against the veiled azure of the sky.</p>

<p>There was no change in him. Lucan had wildly expected to see
something monstrous about his person; crazily enough he felt that
he would be shown into the presence of a beast or a demon.</p>

<p>But here was the Henry Luttrell of the old days who had been
such a pleasant companion and, it had seemed, such a warm friend,
of so fantastic an imagination, of so much wit and valour, of gifts
so brilliant, so amusing and agreeable in his light fastidious
way&mdash;here was the same Henry Luttrell seated in his dungeon
awaiting death. He had been stripped of his uniform, that was the
sole difference in his appearance. He wore a civilian suit of a
dark colour with many steel buttons; his linen was fair and fresh,
his hair neatly dressed. His curious face, always pallid, showed
little trace of what he had been through, but as he turned at
Sarsfield's entrance, the oblique cast in his eye was very
pronounced. ("That is the sole mark of the Devil about him.")</p>

<p>Luttrell did not rise at Lucan's entrance, but remained in his
slightly lounging attitude and glanced again at the tree beyond the
window with the air of a man who has done with worldly forms and
ceremonies.</p>

<p>Lucan advanced, and Galloping O'Hogan was close beside him like
a dog who presses nearer to his master in a moment of danger, and
danger there was, though Lucan wore his sword and pistols, and the
prisoner was unarmed.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you did?"</p>

<p>"When and where did you find her, Lord Lucan?" replied Luttrell
coolly. He glanced with a cold and indeed a satisfied curiosity at
the man who addressed him.</p>

<p>"I found her in a hovel near Aughrim."</p>

<p>"The happier for you," smiled Luttrell. "I hope you had a
pleasant meeting."</p>

<p>"The new sods lie fresh upon her in Saint Mary's holy
ground."</p>

<p>"Well for her." Luttrell still smiled.</p>

<p>"But at Aughrim all was lost."</p>

<p>"Then I hope you do not blame me for treating with the
Williamites."</p>

<p>"I am not concerned with that&mdash;you are one of many traitors, and
in a few hours will pay for that same treachery. But I cannot
sleep, I cannot rest day or night, for the thought of her, or the
wonder of why you did it...the horror&mdash;the rage."</p>

<p>"Who found her?" asked Luttrell dryly. "I thought that had been
difficult. I lost sight of her months ago. The soldiers took her
away."</p>

<p>"I went to her on the eve of Aughrim. It was one defeat to me&mdash;I
cannot disentangle the two events."</p>

<p>"They were right then who complained of you," sneered Luttrell,
"as leaving your post on the eve of an engagement, to visit a young
harlot."</p>

<p>And he thought as he saw Lucan's eyes: "He has come to murder
me, no doubt. He is mad. Better, perhaps," he thought, for he was
utterly fearless, "to die at his hands than by hanging or shooting,
whichever they intend for me to-morrow."</p>

<p>Lucan leant against the wall; as weak, he seemed, as if his mind
was vacant. He said to O'Hogan:</p>

<p>"Take my hands and hold them behind my back."</p>

<p>Then Luttrell knew that he did not wish to strike a defenceless
and doomed man, and as the rapparee did as he was bid the prisoner
smiled.</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Lucan, very hoarse and low, "what motive you
had?"</p>

<p>Luttrell squinted at the rapparee whose expression was
ferocious.</p>

<p>"Why should I," he demanded, "who must presently die, and
miserably too, thus paying all debts&mdash;I have heard it said that
death mends everything&mdash;explain to you what motives I had?"</p>

<p>Lucan did not answer. The rapparee said:</p>

<p>"Do not flourish too much, Mr. Luttrell of Luttrelstown, 'tis
only the gallows that saves you from me. I had sworn to get you,
and no man whom I have sworn to get is living."</p>

<p>"Oh, you bring your bully to insult me!" cried the prisoner.</p>

<p>Lucan's hands twisted in the grasp of his friend. Luttrell again
believed that he would be murdered. Straining towards him, Lucan
spoke:</p>

<p>"You said you were my friend, yet you took my whole hope and
slung it in the mud."</p>

<p>"You denied me," said Luttrell, and a rising passion coloured
his face. "You denied Madame de Bonnac. I loathe a fool...Have you
seen her?" he added sharply.</p>

<p>"I have seen her, but she is less than nothing." And again he
begged O'Hogan to hold his arms tightly. It had long been in his
mind&mdash;(long?&mdash;it seemed long since Aughrim,) that he must kill this
man like a rat, and he had the strength to do it; the rapparee
gripped his wrists.</p>

<p>Luttrell folded his arms on his breast and, careless of his
great peril (which he saw very well), spoke his clear mind.</p>

<p>"'Tis you who are less than nothing now," he said; "the Irish
cause is lost; you are a thrice-damned fool not to have seen it
lost months ago. You were the only man who could have saved us, but
you would not. You had your scruples, your niceties and your pride,
and your hidden obsession&mdash;a peasant mistress kept snugly on your
estates, with her priest, her dog, and her dwarf! There is all the
weakness of the Irish, my dear Lucan. Do you think one of your
conquerors would have so behaved?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lucan. "No."</p>

<p>With his malign sideway glance and a lift of his lip, Luttrell
continued:</p>

<p>"You are in a thicket of dreams and have never been able to cut
through them. I saw, and saw brightly, the chance; but you would
not take it...What did we want with their mumbling, priest-ridden
king? What did we want with their insolent French commanders? We
wanted an Irishman to lead us&mdash;a man like me to intrigue for him, a
woman like Madame de Bonnac to help him. But no, you would
not."</p>

<p>"No, I would not," repeated Lucan; "not that way for me."</p>

<p>"Well then, the other way, the one you have taken. Where are you
now? All gone."</p>

<p>"All gone for you too, Luttrell. But your reason? I want to
know; all is so dark&mdash;to spite me because I would not be your tool?
Was that your reason?"</p>

<p>"Mine and hers together," Luttrell grinned. "We thought that
when you came back from your defeat you should find your toy gone,
no bauble at Lucan to console you. Who was she? Of no value. Always
unsettled in her wits, I think, but poor sport. I did not find her
so beautiful, but Galmoy had a brief favour for her."</p>

<p>"Galmoy," muttered Lucan, "was made prisoner at Aughrim, or I
had slain him. And were you not a man also doomed I would have
slain you too, Luttrell."</p>

<p>"Was she worth so much?" asked Luttrell. "Well, I am glad on't.
I wanted to sting you, I wanted to bring you down, you deserved to
have your eyes opened to your own folly. I have no more words to
say." He leant in the window-place, an elegant figure, and looked
up at the tree, which swayed to and fro in the brightening
sunshine.</p>

<p>Lucan strained in O'Hogan's grasp, but for all his great
strength the massive hands of the rapparee held him tight.</p>

<p>"Lord Lucan, you have said your say and there is no more to it;
he is a man waiting to die the death of a felon. What more revenge
could your honour want?"</p>

<p>"It is not revenge," said Lucan, tortured to the quick. "It is
not revenge I want, O'Hogan&mdash;it's understanding&mdash;to get to the
bottom of it."</p>

<p>"And you'll not get that from him," said O'Hogan.</p>

<p>"I know well what you mean&mdash;it's the confusion and the darkness
that sting, the wonder why things should happen and the difficulty
of it all."</p>

<p>"You'll get no answer to any of these problems from me," said
Henry Luttrell. He turned as he spoke and, despite his civilian
attire, he looked exactly as he had looked that day at Kinsale, two
years ago, when he had so stood in the window of their lodgings and
Patrick Sarsfield had counted him a friend.</p>

<p>"Come away," urged the rapparee, with the persistence of a dog
tugging at his master's curb; "come away, Lord Lucan, there's no
good to be got here, it's like a glimpse into the darkness and a
sniff of hell. Holy Virgin and the Saints! The man you're looking
at, Lord Lucan, is bound straight to his destination, that's the
place where there is no pity."</p>

<p>"Spare me," flashed Luttrell, "the comments of your rascally
fellow! 'Tis a disgrace, my Lord Lucan, that you have had to enlist
the help of all the scum of Ireland, it has not improved our name
in Europe."</p>

<p>Lucan cried, like a man struggling through the influence of a
drug:</p>

<p>"Tell me what happened, tell me what you did to her&mdash;was it you
or Galmoy?" He stammered and his words trailed away. "What said the
Syrian? 'Would a dog do this? But thou art the dog who did
it!'"</p>

<p>"Ay, thou art a dog," grinned O'Hogan; "and like a dog shall
perish."</p>

<p>"Tell me," cried Lucan, beside himself, "why did you do it?"</p>

<p>Luttrell did not flinch, though he believed his death even
nearer than the morrow.</p>

<p>"Don't ask it," pleaded O'Hogan. The rapparee, nearly as tall as
Lucan, breathed in his ear: "Hear nothing of it, you can guess, and
there's less torment in the guessing than in the reality. She lies
at peace with the bells ringing over her. Leave it at that."</p>

<p>"However," sneered Henry Luttrell, "you pleaded or threatened,
you would get no more satisfaction from me."</p>

<p>O'Hogan whispered in Lucan's ear:</p>

<p>"He'll be hanged to-morrow."</p>

<p>He drew Lucan towards the door; the betrayed man muttered:</p>

<p>"All gone&mdash;no revenge&mdash;no explanation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Find that," cried Luttrell, who overheard, "in your own
weakness, your own failure. You have followed a myth, a marsh fire.
You call me a traitor, but I have tried to end the war, to make
good terms for Ireland. 'Tis men like you, without sense, without
subtlety, entangled in legends and dreams, striving for the
impossible, who ruin Ireland."</p>

<p>"I do not hear what he says," muttered Lucan, and he suffered
the rapparee to lead him away.</p>

<p>There was a great brightness of sunset on the ramparts. The
sunshine across the doomed city seemed incredible, an insult and a
menace. O'Hogan wished that it would rain.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking of John Luby," he said, "and how I kept him
through all&mdash;fine, glossy and well fed he was...and they to ruin
him on the hurdles. The crows will be picking him clean. And
to-morrow they will be picking Henry Luttrell of Luttrelstown."</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-57" id="ch1-57"></a>FIFTY-SEVEN</h2>

<p class="first">
AS LORD LUCAN and Toby O'Hogan left the dungeons of Limerick
Castle, Major d'Archange met them. The Lord Lieutenant was ill; at
D'Usson's banquet, after a fierce argument as to the defence of
Limerick, Tyrconnel had collapsed suddenly, choking with rage,
bemused with apricot brandy. The viceroy, over-exerted by his
efforts to fortify Limerick, distracted and chagrined by defeat and
misfortune, had fallen in an apoplexy; he had asked for Lucan.</p>

<p>In a hastily-arranged room the huge corpulent man, who was still
stately and formidable, lay dying; he had been blooded and
plastered. He was bandaged and reeking of drugs; his clay-coloured
face, distorted by the stroke, showed horrible from the pillows on
which his heavy head, bristling with gray hairs, was sunk. His
spirit remained lively; he pressed Lucan's hands with twitching
fingers.</p>

<p>"That damned Frenchman, he'll deliver the place. Look to
it&mdash;what d'ye think he said?"</p>

<p>Lucan bent low to catch the raucous murmur of the dying man, who
rambled on with gaps in his speech.</p>

<p>"D'Usson said we were beaten, that it was impossible to avoid a
capitulation...even if France sent horses and dragoons
enough&mdash;impossible to keep 'em in a country so ruined and
desolate&mdash;no flesh left, which is necessary for the
garrison...Limerick is nothing but the ruins of a town...Supplies
could not be drawn from a blasted country&mdash;in another month we
should be in need of bread, and can expect none from any part."</p>

<p>As Tyrconnel's labouring voice failed, Lucan said:</p>

<p>"D'Usson wants to capitulate?"</p>

<p>"Yes," came the rattling whisper. "But I'm damned if I do. You
should get 'em to support me. Confound ye, Lucan, we've had our
quarrels, but you're an honest fellow."</p>

<p>"D'Usson is resolute?"</p>

<p>"Ay, he said we have no news of the convoy from France that may
have started from Brest, and even if it were to come as far as the
mouth of the river at Limerick we cannot hope to make use of the
bread before the last days of the month of October...Better, he
said, take advantage of the foolish terms which General Ginckel has
decided to offer, and for us to pass into France with as many men
as will follow, we being assured of the greatest number of
'em...But I call this cowardly talk&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucan made no answer.</p>

<p>Rage convulsed the gigantic frame of the dying man. He tried to
raise his head so as to stare at the silent man seated by the
bed-curtains.</p>

<p>"What ails ye? Lost heart since Aughrim, eh? Before God, I had
not thought it, Patrick Sarsfield! Well, if I'm dead and you're
broken, the Irish business is done."</p>

<p>"You would try to defend Limerick?"</p>

<p>Tyrconnel swore several of his vehement oaths.</p>

<p>"I would." He sat up, with dignity he demanded: "What means this
prodigious change in Patrick Sarsfield who was once the most active
of all our commanders? Who took such pains to persuade every one to
a stand? Patrick Sarsfield in whom the Irish nation reposed their
greatest confidence? And who they all believed to be the very last
to hearken to any demand for a surrender?"</p>

<p>Lucan did not seem roused or stung; he said:</p>

<p>"I suppose the Frenchman talks common sense. We are beaten to
our knees&mdash;vanquished.</p>

<p>"May I be blasted if I am!" cried the viceroy, with an echo of
his old fury. Forcing the last of his strength he insisted on Lord
Dillon, who was waiting in the antechamber, coming in and reading
the last reports of the movements of the enemy.</p>

<p>Panting on his pillows, Tyrconnel listened to the low voice of
Dillon whose nervous fingers fumbled with the papers. Lucan,
passive, snuffed the candles; the night was very hot, the windows
had been opened and D'Usson's continuous drums and trumpets sounded
in the distance. Dillon's news was not good; it supported the
pessimism of D'Usson.</p>

<p>General Ginckel, even with certain victory in sight, had abated
nothing of his usual prudence...He had secured the passage across
the river with a pontoon bridge and erected a fresh battery between
Ireton and Old Church Fort to prevent a sally of the enemy. The
English fleet had landed a naval brigade in County Clare...</p>

<p>The city was completely cut off from all communication with the
cavalry stationed near Six-Mile Bridge; the English possessed the
forts and earthworks on the Clare side of Limerick.</p>

<p>Tyrconnel groaned; he had already had some report of this
disaster...The Irish had made a sortie from King John's Castle,
been forced back across Thomond's Bridge. The French major in
charge of the bridge was afraid that the besiegers might enter as
well as the besieged, and pulled up the drawbridge too hastily,
leaving six hundred of his allies outside, who were drowned and
slain...No quarter had been given, though the Irish had cried for
mercy, holding up their handkerchiefs. Twenty officers and a
hundred men were taken prisoners in the fort with three brass guns
and five cannon.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Lucan, "D'Usson has good cause for his
despondency."</p>

<p>"You did not use to talk in such a tone," muttered the dying
man, and he impatiently motioned to Dillon to continue.</p>

<p>Dillon replied that "Ginckel was slow and cautious but
deadly...It seemed as impossible to evade him here as it had been
in Galway and Athlone...The French officers were satisfied that
they had done their duty, even their king, stern and exact as he
was in military matters, could not blame them. It was impossible to
hold the city, with their backs to the sea and the sea occupied by
the enemy, and they without food or ammunition."</p>

<p>"You too," groaned Tyrconnel, "you have lost spirit!" Without
comment and in a dull official voice Dillon continued his
report:</p>

<p>"Ginckel was slowly closing round on the city. Large escorts
were bringing up the heavy trains of artillery from the Athlone
depot, nine twenty-four pounders, nine eighteen-pounders and three
mortars...From Dublin came twenty pontoon boats, a fleet of
eighteen ships under Captain Coal had sailed from Galway Bay and
anchored three miles below the town...The eleventh Foot and the
fifth Dragoon Guards were manufacturing two thousand fascines.
Mackay was attacking Ireton Fort; and Count Nassau Cromwell Fort,
both would surrender very soon."</p>

<p>"Read no more," said Lucan suddenly. "His grace is past these
earthly matters."</p>

<p>Dillon dropped the papers that he had been reading without
spirit or interest, and with a look of horror bent over his uncle
who lay convulsed in the final agony.</p>

<p>"Oh, he was faithful and honest!" cried the young man.</p>

<p>A sudden cannonade from the English in King John's Castle
silenced D'Usson's trumpets and drums. Tyrconnel seized Lucan's
hand.</p>

<p>"I am glad Luttrell will be hanged," he gasped. Then, with a
horrid force in one nearly spent, he exclaimed: "Did ye hear that
rogue, Baldearg O'Donnell, who promised to join us at Aughrim, and
then here has been bought by Ginckel for money and my title?
There's a fact for ye&mdash;he's Tyrconnel now...A jest&mdash;a jest."</p>

<p>The viceroy was dead.</p>

<p>"He must be buried," said Lucan, "not as his station, but as the
time demands."</p>

<p>He spoke indifferently; there was only one grave in Galway for
him. He left Dillon to do what remained to be done for Richard
Talbot, Duke of Tyrconnel, Viceroy for King James in Ireland, and
returned to his own house near Baal's Bridge.</p>

<p>Honor was waiting for him; he had hardly taken any notice of her
since Aughrim. He rejected the food and drink she set before him.
He said:</p>

<p>"Henry Luttrell will be hanged to-morrow."</p>

<p>Honor gazed at him with deep remorse, with sad compassion. She
knew what the other officers said:</p>

<p>"&mdash;that there was no hope of holding out in Limerick unless they
had been inspired by some such wild and fanatic enthusiasm as had
inspired Derry, Inniskillen and this same town when it was besieged
before...But that the man who could have supplied that inspiration
was broken, as if the mainspring of a watch had snapped...With the
striking down of Sarsfield (they said) the heart of Ireland was
struck down, with his collapse, Limerick too must fall like a house
of cards."</p>

<p>But Honor knew that she could not inspire him; sunk in his
misery he did not regard her at all; she could not help him to lead
this last hope. It was too late and she was not the woman. Even
when she snatched up her child, and said: "Let him not consider
himself the son of a defeated man," she could not rouse his
lethargy.</p>

<p>"He is the heir," said Lucan wildly, "of a defeated nation. We
must take the Dutchman's generosity, my dear, we must take his
charity, my darling; we must let the aliens drive us from our
native land, we must go into exile." He sighed. With a sudden
brilliant hope he added: "How is it that I have never been touched?
Why have I been preserved? It may be that if we could have but one
more sally I might be slain, it would be good to die in
Ireland."</p>

<p>"Ay," said Honor, "that I can understand."</p>

<p>"For die I must, as Galway died at Aughrim, and soon. And I hope
there is one who will protect you, dear Honor, and maybe the child
as well."</p>

<p>He looked at her tenderly, remembering how she had taken Ishma
to her unblemished bosom, how Ishma lay with her jewels adorning
her body...</p>

<p>"I believe he is faithful," he muttered, "I believe I can trust
him&mdash;a king's son. O'Hogan too."</p>

<p>The tears lay in Honor's eyes, but she tried for courage and
faltered:</p>

<p>"Even if they exile us we will return and wrest Ireland from
them yet."</p>

<p>But these were empty words, sounding like the mournful rustle of
dead leaves in the wind, useless.</p>

<p>That evening Lucan, in a sudden wild fury, headed a desperate
<i>sortie</i> from Limerick.</p>

<p>The Irish were defeated and driven back with heavy loss, but
Lucan did not receive a scratch, though he had been in the hottest
of the fire and seemed to run hither and thither seeking out death.
Limerick was battered to a hollow ruin by Ginckel's revenge. There
was hardly a house in the streets that was not shattered by shot
and shell; the bombs and the cannon balls fell steadily on the
forts and earthworks on the Clare side. Lady Dillon was killed by a
fireball as her husband was directing the coffining of the viceroy.
Clouds came up and a sudden rain broke the heat.</p>

<p>When Patrick Sarsfield returned to the city from the fray in
which death had evaded him, he did not return to his men, to his
wife, nor to Ishma's grave.</p>

<p>He went to a filthy inn where the rapparees were drinking,
gambling and quarrelling, while an old blind harper played ancient
airs.</p>

<p>With his arms on the greasy table, his face in his hands, torn,
powder-blackened, his tattered uniform darkened with splashed blood
and dirt, he watched the Irish&mdash;drunk, despairing, hideous, fight
and lament to the mournful thin melody of the little harp.</p>

<p>In the morning he presented himself before D'Usson who received
him coldly, eyeing askance the wild disorder of his person.</p>

<p>"Is Henry Luttrell hanged?" he demanded.</p>

<p>D'Usson pursed up his lips.</p>

<p>"I had a trumpet from General Ginckel who had heard of
Luttrell's plight. He said that if we put to death any man who had
a mind to come over to him he would avenge it on the Irish, and all
his prisoners&mdash;and, <i>mon Dieu!</i> he has many."</p>

<p>"What has happened to Luttrell?"</p>

<p>"What could I do? Ginckel has many distinguished men in his
hands, though he is merciful he is a good general and means what he
says; I let Luttrell go. He rode at once into the English
camp."</p>

<p>Lucan began to laugh. He rested his elbows on the table, his
face in his hands, as he had sat in the inn last night, and
laughed, as if at some secret jest, so that the French officers
paused in what they were saying and glanced at him in
amazement.</p>

<p>Lucan ceased to laugh, and stared blankly in front of him.</p>

<p>The French officers exchanged scornful looks full of contempt
for the volatile Irishman. They had, in this final issue, counted
on the popularity and dash of this "darling of the Irish army."
They had hoped that Lord Lucan would show something of the spirit
which had inspired the Irish to resist from the first siege of
Limerick, but the man seemed spent.</p>

<p>D'Usson remarked that during last night's severe bombardment a
wide breach had been made in English Town wall between Baal's
Bridge and the Abbey&mdash;broad enough for two coaches to drive
abreast. The city was also now completely invested from the Clare
side, and the Dutch general had issued a new proclamation in which
he offered the garrison, in the event of their capitulation within
eight days, the most favourable terms, pardon, restitution of their
estates, rewards for their services...</p>

<p>Lucan said nothing to this.</p>

<p>D'Usson thought: "He is as Irish as Baldearg O'Donnell, and not
much more to be relied on&mdash;Saint Rhue was right to give him no real
power."</p>

<p>Another of the French officers emphasised the points that "food
was running short and no relief seemed possible by sea or land, and
that even if the French fleet contrived to sail up the estuary the
English fleet lay waiting for them&mdash;"</p>

<p>Heavy rain splashed against the deepest windows of the castle;
the bells of Saint Munchin could be heard tolling for
Tyrconnel.</p>

<p>Lucan still did not speak. The French officers turned away
feeling that here they had a man useless to them. They wondered
much at this sudden, unexpected collapse of a leader whom, despite
themselves, they had counted on; whom, despite themselves, they had
admired. D'Usson, though he had quarrelled with the violent
Tyrconnel on the point, had been willing to make a last stand in
Limerick; he had done all he could, even causing money to be
distributed among the rapparees who, shut up in the beleaguered
city, had begun to mutiny.</p>

<p>But without Lucan's help he could do nothing, and it seemed that
from Lucan no help was coming.</p>

<p>The severe Frenchman was inwardly moved by the spectacle of
Patrick Sarsfield seated there in his tattered, bloody clothes,
with his bruised face, his clenched hands pressing his cheeks, his
hair matted with grime and sweat, and nothing to say, moved by the
obviously heart-broken, magnificent Irishman, who scarcely seemed,
since Aughrim, able to put through his mere routine duty. D'Usson
thought: "He is like an oak tree, green in the branches, but dead
inside and ready to fall."</p>

<p>"Well," he said aloud, "it seems to me, Lord Lucan, if you have
nothing to suggest&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then Lucan looked up; he listened (it seemed) a while to the
tolling of the great bell of Saint Munchin.</p>

<p>The French, seeing his wide eyes fixed on them, expected at last
an outbreak of protest against the proposal of surrender. They
would have been surprised if the man whom they had thought would be
so difficult should have come so quickly to their own prudent
conclusions...</p>

<p>D'Usson was about to speak, but suddenly Lucan rose to his great
height.</p>

<p>"I know what you are going to say," he said, staying him with an
uplifted hand; "let a parley be beaten round the walls and a white
flag be hung out."</p>

PATRICK SARSFIELD, Lord Lucan, watched King James's shot-riddled
flag being hauled down from the castle of Limerick, and the
Dutchman's clean colours being run up; A great wind rose and blew
it wide in the gray autumn air.</p>

<p>As this standard of the alien and the victor broke above the
shattered city that had seen the last stand of a vanquished nation,

utter misery&mdash;the low lamentation of the lost and hopeless.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>POSTLOGUE</h2>

<h3>(1693)</h3>

<p class="first">
CAPTAIN TOBY O'HOGAN stood in the garden of a cottage in the
small village of Huy, close to Neer-Winden in Flanders; a large
lime-tree in full leaf and flower cast a scented shade nearby;
under it an old woman was picking over the thin fine leaves for
<i>tilleul</i> tea; she was so blind and deaf that she did not know
a murderous battle had recently taken place a few miles away; old
age enclosed her in silence, in darkness, in peace; monotonously,
mechanically her shivering stiff fingers cast into a pile the
bruised and stripped lime leaves.</p>

<p>Another Irish soldier came up, halting and dusty. He paused by
the fence that sheltered the brilliant summer flowers; he quickly
answered O'Hogan's anxious questions&mdash;"No, he could find neither
priest nor surgeon; he had sent O'Hara to bring the Lady Honor from
Glembloux; he doubted she'd be there in time"&mdash;all was in
confusion, 'twas but twenty-four hours after the engagement, which
had been fierce and bloody even in the judgment of veterans...the
enemy had been utterly routed, but the Prince of Orange had covered
his retreat in so magnificent a manner that Luxembourg was like to
find his victory barren...the Dutchman had been the last to leave
the field, the last to leave the bridge across the Gheet piled high
with the bodies of his broken troops.</p>

<p>"Ay, he would do that," said the Jacobite. "Brave, brave, by
heaven, he deserves to wear a crown!"</p>

<p>"And my lord?" asked O'Hara.</p>

<p>"Dying."</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"He is always alone, whoever is with him."</p>

<p>The two Irishmen were silent a moment; they both looked at the
old woman under the trees who picked her leaves steadily, unknowing
of their presence; swarms of bees hummed in the lime tree, the sun
turned their bodies the same amber gold as the clustered blossoms,
the swaying foliage; there was no sound nor sight of war.</p>

<p>"You must," said O'Hogan, who, in his neat French uniform, no
longer looked a cattle-thief or vagabond but a trim officer, "find
a fresh horse, O'Hara, and try again to get a priest and a
surgeon&mdash;and Berwick. Where is my Lord Berwick, he would come,
surely?"</p>

<p>"Hamilton told me that Berwick had been taken in the first
attack. I'll do what I can."</p>

<p>As O'Hara turned away along the white dusty road, O'Hogan went
back to the cottage; the peasant woman who had been watching the
dying man, impressed by his magnificence, asked timidly "who the
great gentleman was?"</p>

<p>"Maréchal de Camp the Earl of Lucan."</p>

<p>O'Hogan went into the inner room; Lucan lay on a rude bed drawn
beneath the open window; he had only spoken once since he had been
carried from the field, where he had been struck down in the final
charge of the French cavalry as they forced the English back to the
banks of the Gheet; then, as he lay on the trampled ground he had
put his hand to his breast under the bullion-braided uniform, and
taking it away covered with blood, had said: "Would this had been
for Ireland! Would this had been for Ireland!"</p>

<p>Toby O'Hogan sat on the stool by the low bed; into his weary and
sorrowful mind the silence crept like a spell, bringing many
memories of things of which he never spoke; he thought of his
country which he had not seen for two years of exile, and might
never see again...of the fall of Limerick.</p>

<p>Two days after the Treaty was signed a French relief expedition
had sailed into Dingle Bay...eighteen ships of war, six fire ships
and twenty other large vessels, two hundred officers and three
thousand men and arms for ten thousand&mdash;a force that would have
enabled D'Usson and Lucan to hold out through the winter season and
force the English to raise the siege.</p>

<p>But it was too late.</p>

<p>O'Hogan's musing look became murderous. This was all Henry
Luttrell's doing; in breaking the heart of Patrick Sarsfield he had
broken the heart of Ireland; Sarsfield would never have given in
had not Luttrell's treachery laid him low...very keenly had O'Hogan
sought for Luttrell after the fall of Limerick; but the traitor had
fled to the besieger's camp; his reward had been a thousand a year
and his brother's estates; he lived comfortably in Dublin, avoiding
the wars.</p>

<p>"I'll have him yet," said O'Hogan aloud, brushing aside a bee
that buzzed above the head of the unconscious man...</p>

<p>Toby O'Hogan watched the summer sunlight which cast a lustre on
the lime tree boughs beyond the open window and thought of many
trivial things...Of the long negotiations after Limerick, of the
kindliness of Ginckel which seemed so galling, of that last scene
when the Irish exiles (the "flight of the wild geese," they called
it) had left for ever the wild shores of Kerry, the women clinging
to the boats, dragged into the water, drowning in the waves, for
there was not room for them, the wild keening...he remembered the
news from England, how the conquered Irish colours had been taken
to the young Queen, how she had given a diamond ring and five
hundred pounds to the man who brought them. Why did he think of
such things? Again his thoughts turned to Luttrell&mdash;Luttrell who
flourished exceedingly with pensions and honours, a proud gentleman
in the Williamite's administration at Dublin.</p>

<p>How monotonous had been the years spent in foreign service
fighting under alien flags since O'Hogan had left Ireland an exile.
Always with the hope, a hope put off from day to day, from hour to
hour growing fainter, that he and Sarsfield's Brigade might be sent
back to Ireland.</p>

<p>Twelve thousand Irish had followed Lucan into exile, refusing
the bribes offered by the Dutchman, though their condition was so
wretched that the French officers standing by had made jests of
it...every month since the dispossessed, the loyal, the ruined, had
followed a myth into exile; O'Hogan had seen them in Paris,
despised, starving, proud gentlemen of fair estates, acting as foot
soldiers swarming round the beggared court at St. Germains...happy
those who were able to get into the Irish Brigade...the rest&mdash;the
disabled, the old, the sickly&mdash;were "<i>pauvres diables</i>" and
"<i>pauvres gueux</i>"...tasting a bitterness unspeakable.</p>

<p>Lucan stirred and O'Hogan raised him a little on the pillows;
not unskilled in such matters, he had done what he could for the
dying man...but he knew it was over for Patrick Sarsfield&mdash;the
futilities, the frustrations, the heartbreaks, the dreams...Lucan
opened his eyes and stared about him; his mind was quite clear. He
asked "if his wife was coming?" O'Hogan answered that "his lordship
might live many hours, perhaps a couple of days, that my lady was
hurrying, a message having been sent immediately."</p>

<p>"You should not," said Lucan, "have concerned yourself so much
with me."</p>

<p>He knew that he owed it to the fidelity of O'Hogan that he had
even this rough comfort, and had not been left to perish, to be
trampled under foot and stripped on the bitterly-fought
battlefield. He pulled at the cross of the Saint Esprit which
O'Hogan had left glittering on his tunic.</p>

<p>"Take away this trumpery&mdash;I liked better the other honours I
had."</p>

<p>O'Hogan gently took off the splendours of a French general, the
glittering decorations of a <i>Maréchal de Camp</i>...the rewards
of the foreigner. What had the great Luxembourg's warm praise
availed Lucan?&mdash;"A splendid soldier, a magnificent officer!"&mdash;but
one who could not save his own country!</p>

<p>"Why," thought O'Hogan, "did he not fall like Dillon, Galway and
so many other gentlemen in Ireland? O Ireland! what will become of
Ireland? I remember before I left Limerick how I turned back and
lit the little lamp under the shrine of Saint Patrick in the ruined
chapel...They gave us fine terms by the treaty and the Prince and
the general meant to keep them, but the parliaments will not.
'Twill be the city of the broken treaty, and I would he could have
died then...Why has God made play with him in keeping him alive
till he has tasted the bitterness of exile, eating the bread and
taking the pay of the stranger?"</p>

<p>But O'Hogan said nothing of this aloud; for the two men never
spoke of Ireland. Lucan asked "if Berwick could be found&mdash;if he
would come?"</p>

<p>"He was made prisoner, Lord Lucan."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry. I am thinking of <i>her</i>. He might&mdash;d'ye
think he would? She will be quite ruined and desolate&mdash;there is
nothing to leave her, nothing at all."</p>

<p>"I'll answer for my Lord Berwick."</p>

<p>Lucan stared out at the lime tree; the sunlight was deepening in
the amber gold leaves; the angelus, a cracked, timid bell, sounded
from the village church.</p>

<p>"To-night I shall not dream," he said in a muse of pain, fatigue
and sad memory. "Or are the dreams over, O'Hogan?" he asked,
opening his eyes wider (he always had that large gaze), his pale
beautiful lips curved into a smile. "Or do not the dreams perhaps
now begin?"</p>

<p>"Lord Lucan, very like it is so," said O'Hogan. The tears lay
under his small, fierce, inflamed lids; he replaced on the other's
bosom a rosary of bogwood and the crucifix that had belonged to the
woman whose name was never spoken by Patrick Sarsfield or any
other; her unmarked grave was in the hands of the conqueror and all
the places that had known her were ravished by the enemy.</p>

<p>Lucan did not speak again; he seemed to sleep and O'Hogan
watched.</p>

<p>As the twilight fell a woman entered the room; in the village
began noise and confusion, for the camp-followers, the wives and
sweethearts and the children were coming up now that the English
had made their sullen and magnificent retreat, and were searching
for the wounded on the battlefield and in the cottages.</p>

<p>This woman was not the Countess of Lucan.</p>

<p>It was Madame de Bonnac that O'Hogan saw; a creature still of a
rich beauty, but now flaunting in overblown gaudiness like a
loosened flower at autumn's end. She had been openly the mistress
of many men since her husband's death and with no pretence of love
in any bargain. Her secret coarseness and her open degradation
showed in her attire&mdash;too rich, too brilliant and yet a little
tarnished and tattered.</p>

<p>She had entered the hut before any could stop her, being clever
at obtaining information, and never having for long lost sight of
Patrick Sarsfield. She crossed to his bedside and, without noticing
O'Hogan's glare of hate, lit a small taper and held it high above
the dying Irishman.</p>

<p>He lay flat on the low bed as Ishma had lain in the hut by
Aughrim, his fair hair was tangled with blood and sweat; she
remembered it when he had wooed her in the old mansion of the
McCarthys, and how she had likened it to scorched corn. She
remembered all the beauty of the love he had offered her in his
magnificent and splendid youth, of what she might have had from
him, and how she had been revenged on him and what she had wilfully
missed, and how she had taken everything that he valued, in spite
and fury. She smiled, thinking how strange was both the beginning
and the end of their knowledge of each other. She put back her
hood, too heavily embroidered with tarnished bullion, and fingered
the beads round her throat, and stared again down at him and
said:</p>

<p>"Patrick Sarsfield, I think you are dying." And then she turned
away and left the hut.</p>

<p>And Lucan answered nothing; whether he heard or not O'Hogan did
not know.</p>

<p>That evening tired O'Hara brought a priest, the village
<i>curé</i>, obscure, frightened, honest, who looked with regret
and compassion at the splendour thus laid low, and shook his head
at the wide futility of war and murmured:</p>

<p>"A man like that!"</p>

<p>Captain O'Hogan left them together and went into the kitchen
where the old woman was putting the lime leaves into a pot and a
young woman was putting a child to sleep; the world outside was
full of murmuring noises.</p>

<p>When the priest came out with his little case under his arm,
O'Hogan went back to his vigil; he knew now that neither the wife
nor the friend could arrive in time...Berwick might have had leave
to come...Lucan had been chivalrous with the English prisoners
after Steinkirk and Ginckel (Athlone now) had, with his king's
consent, sent him a present of some fine horses..."But 'tis all too
late," thought O'Hogan, "all the contrivances&mdash;too late."</p>

<p>Lucan was thinking of his wife; through the vague dazzling of
his increasing fever he fingered the crucifix the old priest had
put into his hands, and moved his head restlessly from side to
side...if only Berwick could have come; he had always been able to
trust Berwick. Poor Honor, still so childish, so often ill and
coughing, patient and dignified. In these years of exile she had
been brave and faithful...Poor Honor! He felt her fate so much
harder than his own.</p>

<p>He could not speak of her, but deep in his mind, clouded with
many visions and dreams, was the tormenting thought of how he would
leave her...</p>

<p>They had now two children...As the result of their sad
reconciliation had come a daughter...He thought of his dear demesne
in Lucan which his heirs would never even see.</p>

<p>He said nothing but lay silent on the straw mattress enduring
his martyrdom.</p>

<p>"If I was to speak now what has never been spoken since we left
Limerick?" thought O'Hogan in anguish&mdash;"of the lost woman, and the
lost land&mdash;would he like to hear?"</p>

<p>And he was tormented because he could not guess what was in the
mind of the dying man.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell him I'll have Luttrell one day, or will that
disturb his peace with God?"</p>

<p>Lucan smiled.</p>

<p>"His Majesty will be pleased to hear of this victory&mdash;Luxembourg
must have taken many flags."</p>

<p>"The old king is almost turned Trappist; I doubt if he'll
care."</p>

<p>"You'll give to <i>her</i>, O'Hogan, all that's in my
pockets&mdash;'tis all I have. And there are the brilliants studded in
the Star. But keep for yourself the phial with the blood of St.
Ignatius. King James gave it to me. Bend low, I fear I speak very
faint. King James said 'loyalty is enough in itself.' Well, I
believe he'll fumble his way to God...just by that."</p>

<p>"O'Hogan put his arm under Lucan's shoulders and raised him
high, for his breathing was laborious. It was the darkest hour of
the summer night, the taper light showed a fair change in the dying
man's face.</p>

<p>"I sink deathwards," he whispered, "very fast."</p>

<p>"O Patrick Sarsfield of Lucan!" cried O'Hogan in despair, "will
you not say one word of what must be in your heart&mdash;of Ireland&mdash;of
the woman under St. Mary's sod?"</p>

<p>He felt the heavy man sag in his arms; he heard the whisper.</p>

<p>"Ireland? I remember on the mountains there used to be rainbows,
even in December. Oh, I've a longing&mdash;"</p>

<p>With but a little struggling as if he made no resistance to the
overwhelming darkness Patrick Sarsfield passed; he looked stern,
gigantic and terrible on the straw pallet.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>POSTSCRIPTUM</h2>

<p class="first">
IN THE YEAR 1717 Brigadier Henry Luttrell of Luttrelstown, who
had grown to great estates and honours under the rule of the
Protestants, was, one wild wet evening, shot in his chair as he was
being carried through the streets of Dublin.</p>

<p>It was believed that the murderer was one of the native Irish
who resented the traitor's escape after Limerick, and in particular
one Toby O'Hogan, was suspected; this man, once a noted outlaw and
rapparee, had been in French service and then in the household of
Honor, Duchess of Berwick, who had once been Countess of Lucan;
after her death of a consumption in 1698, Captain O'Hogan had
attached himself to James Sarsfield, called by the Jacobites Earl
of Lucan; but on that youth going to Spain, O'Hogan (it was
believed) had come back to Ireland and lived, with other secretly
returned exiles, in the Connemara Mountains or the wilds of
Sligo.</p>

<p>But the murderer of Henry Luttrell, despite such surmises,
remained for ever unknown.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>APPENDIX</h2>

<p class="first">
THE period covered by this novel is one that has excited the
bitterest differences of opinion; both sides have been
misrepresented, abused, exalted, overpraised. The earlier writers
were mostly Protestants, and there is no doubt that they were not
modest in the claims for their own persuasion, nor generous in
their allowances to the other; Lord Macaulay caused much irritation
by his purely Whig attitude and by his treatment of William III. as
a kind of party hero, tactlessly stressing that Nonconformist
aspect of this Prince which was best calculated to inflame his
opponents. Nor were these slow to retaliate and Macaulay's
partisanship pales before the fierce flames of vindictive abuse
with which the Jacobite historians have sought to support their
cause; these, too, have been guilty of far worse defacements of the
truth than ever was Lord Macaulay; some are models of suppression,
twisted statements and omission coloured with a blind spitefulness
that makes them valueless; there exist among Jacobite books
virulent examples of unabashed <i>parti pris</i> without any
attempt at common fairness to "the other side" which, I think,
would be impossible to match among the Protestant writers, but, not
to further increase controversy, it is wiser not to mention names.
Such works, though lively reading, are useless to the historian and
create a cloud of bad feeling, prejudice and intolerance that
completely confuses the subject. One has to seek clearer air to
come at even the relative truth, for as one party writer cancels
out the other, the seeker after knowledge is left starved. The
<i>Political History of England</i>, Vol. VIII., by Sir Richard
Lodge, 1910, gives a cool and unenthusiastic account of this period
that cannot be attacked on the score of either accuracy or
prejudice, but it is of necessity brief and not intimate. The book
that the present writer has mainly used (besides contemporary
sources like Kelly, Story, D'Avaux and Berwick), and which seems in
every way unexceptional, is <i>Revolutionary Ireland and its
Settlement</i>, by Robert Murray, with an Introduction by J. P.
Mahaffy, London, 1911. The complexity of the subject and the amount
of material available are shown by Dr. Murray's bibliography that,
ranging from contemporary memoirs like Dean Story's classic,
<i>True and Impartial History</i>, and pamphlets like Sir William
Temple's <i>Essay on the Advancement of Trade in Ireland</i> to
Lecky, Klopp and books like Bellesheim's <i>Geschichte der
Catholischen Kirche in Irland</i>, comprises three hundred and two
entries under "contemporary authorities," including twenty-nine
volumes of <i>State Papers for Ireland</i>, and under the section
"modern authorities," one hundred and forty-three. It might be
noted that the very important <i>Négociations en Irlande,
1689-90</i>, by the Comte D'Avaux, have not been translated or
annotated, and are very difficult to obtain; here is a work
awaiting the attention of modern scholarship.</p>

<p>This selection contains, of course, expression of all possible
shades of opinion, and Dr. Murray's scholarly and laborious book,
written with insight and justice, is based on a painstaking
assimilation of this mass of material with the result that it would
have to be a violently prejudiced reader who would fail to be
convinced that he has got as near the truth as mortal is likely to
get; Dr. Mahaffy's Introduction gives an impartial and succinct
account of the state of affairs in Ireland prior to 1688. Both Dr.
Murray and Dr. Mahaffy, it may be mentioned, while giving the
Protestants full blame for their acts of cruelty and intolerance,
are distinctly favourable to them, and look upon the struggle
between William III. and Louis XIV. as that between tyranny and
freedom; the war in Ireland was a mere side issue in this titanic
contest, but immensely important to the native Roman Catholic
population, who hoped to find their own count by fishing in these
very troubled waters. It is impossible not to feel sympathetic with
the Irish at this juncture; they were exploited, deceived,
abandoned, abused and despised by both Louis XIV. and James II.;
and William III., who would have given them a fair deal, was
committed to their enemies and divided from them by their deepest
loyalties and bitterest prejudices. It was because Patrick
Sarsfield stood for none of the foreign kings, but entirely for
Ireland (and was almost alone in this) that he speedily and justly
obtained such power and popularity with his countrymen during his
life and became a national hero after his death.</p>

<p>The Irish instinctively felt that with "the flight of the wild
geese," headed by Patrick Sarsfield, their brief and frantic hope
of independence was gone and the yoke of the loathed Protestant
settler sunk more deeply on their shoulders. Sarsfield had many of
the qualities that fit a man to become symbolic of a brave and
ancient nation; he was of an heroic presence, of an unquestioned
honour, of an unblemished courage, and had that gay, gallant, easy
bearing which so endears to all; above everything he was
single-minded, utterly sincere; in the midst of every variety of
corrupation and double-dealing he remained untainted, the ideal
patriot.</p>

<p>There is much of the life of this fine Irishman that is unknown,
and there are curiously few biographies or memoirs dealing with
him; that by Dr. John Todhunter is the only "Life" known to the
present writer; it is very interesting but brief and not
documented; very little of fact has survived relating to Sarsfield,
his personality lives largely in tradition and legend, sure sign of
a people's love.</p>

<p>There are several portraits of Patrick Sarsfield in existence;
that in the Franciscan convent in Dublin shows a beautiful face of
great spirituality, so does the wax relief for a medallion in the
Dublin Museum. His grave is lost, he was probably buried in the
little church at Huy, where he died from wounds received at the
battle of Landen.</p>

<p>The background, Ireland, has an even larger bibliography than
the immediate period; from Ledwich's <i>Antiquities of Ireland</i>
to Stephen Gwynn's <i>Fair Hills of Ireland</i> such tributes to
this famous country are legion; a book of peculiar charm is W. H.
Bartlett's <i>Ireland</i>; a collection of exquisite romantic
copperplates, full of faery atmosphere with text, "historical and
descriptive" in the best sense of the words, by Stirling Coyne, N.
P. Willis, etc. Sir William and Lady Wilde made enthusiastic
researches into the antiquities and legends of Ireland, not totally
free from error, but erudite and laborious.</p>

<p>To those who are interested in the officers who fought for King
James II. may be recommended <i>King James's Irish Army List,
1689</i>, by John D' Alton, 2 Vols., London, 1861. This most
painstaking though confusing work gives an account of all the
gentlemen who served under the Stewart standard; it contains,
therefore, notices of most of the ancient families of Ireland;
modern research on the subject is embodied in <i>The Irish
Brigades, 1689-1745</i>, by F. H. B. Shrine (1921).</p>

<p>The songs, ballads and squibs provoked by the Irish revolution
in 1689 have been collected by T. C. Croker in <i>Historical Songs,
1688-1691</i> (1841), they are all extremely poor; the only one of
any merit being "The Low Lands of Holland," of Scotch origin; the
others are doggerel, even the famous "Boyne Water" hardly rises
above this level; but the editor's comments are instructive.</p>

<p>The present writer feels that the above notes may be considered
rather heavy and pretentious for a work of fiction; they are given
because so many readers of historical novels evince a curiosity as
to the dry bones of the tale, and because the author knows from
personal experience that a not inconsiderable number have their
attention first drawn to some period or character by a work of
fiction, and through that wish to take up the subject seriously. In
the service of such the above is offered.</p>

<p>A few personal comments: where matters of fact have been dealt
with, every care has been taken to give as accurate an impression
as possible; often this has been difficult enough as it has meant
finding one's way through a maze of conflicting statements;
historical characters have been treated impartially; Lord Galmoy
was unquestionably guilty of the murder of Captain Dixie, and Henry
Luttrell, "the bad son of a bad man," was so detested that eighty
years after his death his grave was broken open and his skull
smashed in as a "mark of infamy"; the author felt, therefore, no
scruples at making these two "the villains of the piece."</p>

<p>A great amount of material relative to the revolution of 1689 in
Ireland, the Irish exiles in France, the scenery, ruins and legends
of Ireland was necessarily collected and necessarily not used in
the final selection; a reader conscious of omission or gaps is
referred to the authorities quoted above.</p>

<p>Finally, if a mere novelist may be allowed so much presumption,
the author would like to plead that this novel should not be judged
by either the standards of the historian, the antiquary, the
folklorist or the theological controversialist; it merely
represents (with what faults and failure the author too well knows)
the very deep impression made on one individual by the history and
landscape of Ireland and the personality of Patrick Sarsfield, Earl
of Lucan, Viscount Tully and Baron Rosberry, Major-General in the
army of King James II., and Maréchal de Camp in that of King Louis
XIV. his grave is unknown, but "the whole earth is the sepulchre of
famous men; their story lives on far away, without visible symbol,
woven into the stuff of other men's lives" (<i>Pericles</i>).</p>
