<h2>What Doth It Profit<br>
<br>
by<br>
<br>
Ben Ames Williams</h2>

<hr>

<p>The Bay was very still and quiet; no sound came from it save the
lapping of little waves no more than an inch or two high, as the
tide crept in across the rocks toward the sea wall at our feet. It
was the dark of the moon; but there were northern lights glowing in
the skies, and they shed a certain vague and ghostly luminosity
across the water. A motor boat went past, exhaust pat-patting
sharply in the stillness. We could see its lights, see the white
blur of its hull. We were sitting, Bill and I, on the veranda of
Bill's cottage, in the dark. In one of the other cottages, down the
shore, we could hear two or three women laughing and talking
together. Someone passed in the darkness, in the direction of the
tennis court, humming under his breath: "My Dame has a Lame. Tame
Crane..." Four or five people were playing "Pounce" in the cottage
up the shore, their sharp, excited laughter rupturing the silence
of the night.</p>

<p>My friend Bill smokes a pipe with a long, straight stem; and in
the summer time it is his habit to look disreputable. But he is
never quite so disreputable as he looks. He has taught
school&mdash;grammar school, high school, private school&mdash;for
something like forty years; and now he is retired, and spends his
time nursing a young apple orchard on one of the inland hills.
There is a ripeness about him; he finds, at times, matters well
worth while to say, and it is often worth while to submit, to him
your perplexities.</p>

<p>"The most interesting part of the whole system," I said to him
this night, "is that each one of these crimes, these disobediences,
brings with it an inescapeable and peculiar penalty."</p>

<p>He puffed at his pipe and asked succinctly, "As how?"</p>

<p>"It had not occurred to me till I studied the thing out, but
it's true," I told him. "For example: God, or Moses for God, said:
'Thou shalt have none other Gods before me!' And if you disobey,
the penalty is that you lose the god you have chosen. If you have
any other god, you can't keep him. If your god is money&mdash;you
have to leave it behind you when you die. Or anything else. The
only god you can hold to is God."</p>

<p>Bill nodded. "Yes, that's so," he agreed.</p>

<p>"Or, 'Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah, thy God, in
vain.' And the penalty of disobeying is the same that was incurred
by the boy who cried: 'Wolf!' once too often. When you want to be
believed thereafter, you are not believed..."</p>

<p>"Like using too much slang," Bill suggested. "You lose the gift
of tongues."</p>

<p>"And the commandment with a promise," I reminded him. "'Honor
thy father and mother.' If you don't, your own children won't honor
you. It never fails."</p>

<p>His interest was caught. "True of them all, I guess," he said.
"I remember a passage in Proverbs...Something about the man who
commits adultery destroying his own soul."</p>

<p>"'They're so plain to be seen, when you look for them," I
agreed. "I've been thinking of the one about stealing. 'Thou shalt
not steal!' There's the most common vice, or most common crime in
this country today. A stenographer manicures her finger nails on
office time; or her boss makes her work overtime without extra pay.
Stealing, either way. A brick-layer lays five hundred bricks a day
when he could lay a thousand; or a contractor pays a man twenty
dollars who is worth thirty. Everybody steals, somehow. Steals
credit, steals time, steals money, steals honor, steals reputation.
People used to take this crime more seriously."</p>

<p>"They had to," Bill suggested. "The institution of property was
the foundation of civilization. The cave men didn't have property;
they had possessions. And they had them as long as they could keep
them, and no longer. Just as soon as a man could leave his bow and
arrow hung in a tree and say 'That is mine' and know it would be
there when he got back, civilization began."</p>

<p>"And the law put on a heavy penalty for taking that bow and
arrow, too," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Necessity," said Bill. "If people stole, somebody was going to
suffer. Maybe die. Out west, thirty or forty years ago, if a man's
horse was stolen he might be left afoot to die. So they hung horse
thieves. Hung all thieves of any account, a couple of hundred years
ago in England. Used to cut off their hands, in some places. Oh,
stealing was a crime in those days."</p>

<p>"And now it's a peccadillo."</p>

<p>"Unless you get found out," Bill amended.</p>

<p>We were silent for a little; till I said at last, "But the
penalty is still there."</p>

<p>Bill swung his head around, the bowl of his pipe glowing in the
darkness. "What do you make it?" he asked. "What is the
penalty?"</p>

<p>"You come to hate and despise the man you stole from," I replied
confidently. "You call him a boob. You inflate yourself with your
own conceit; and you see no wisdom or good in any other man. So you
become miserable. There's no one so miserable as the man who sees
no good in other men."</p>

<p>Bill thought that over. "I don't know," he said.</p>

<p>I was anxious to convince him&mdash;for I was myself not fully
convinced. "True, though," I insisted. "The slacking clerk thinks
he is fooling his boss; the driving boss thinks he is fooling his
clerks. The burglar despises the householder; the bunco man calls
his victims boobs..."</p>

<p>"It's not enough," said Bill. I waited, wondering. "Your
penalty's not heavy enough," he repeated. "It's too abstract. It
has no teeth."</p>

<p>"But there's always a penalty," I insisted. "To fit the crime.
That's the nature of things."</p>

<p>"Sure," Bill agreed. "But you've got the wrong one. The thief
gets his wage; but his wage is not what you think."</p>

<p>"What, then?" I asked; and Bill was silent for a moment, as
though considering. Then chuckled, in a way that had no mirth in
it.</p>

<p>"I saw a man up town the other day," he told me, stuffing a
fresh load of tobacco into his pipe. "A man I hadn't seen for a
good many years. He went to school to me fifteen or twenty years
ago. I've heard about him, off and on, indirectly..."</p>

<p>"What made you think of him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Because he's always been a thief." said Bill. "And because you
can see so plainly what his pay has been."</p>

<p>I made no immediate comment. Bill lighted his pipe, his face
illumined for a moment by the leaping flame of the match; and he
settled back into his chair, puffing great clouds of smoke out
across the veranda rail. After a moment, lifted his feet upon the
rail, so that he was more comfortable.</p>

<p>So told this tale.</p>

<p>You said a while ago (Bill spoke thickly, for his teeth were
clenched across his pipe stem) that we are all thieves; that
stealing is the universal vice, or the universal crime. Probably
you are right. Under a broad definition, most of us steal pretty
consistently; and by the same token, most of us incur the penalty
of theft. If that's so, we ought to know what it is we incur...</p>

<p>This man I'm going to tell you about was a natural born thief.
If we're all thieves, yet most of us have our honest moments. This
man had no honest moments. He's an extreme case; a clear-cut case.
And correspondingly easy to analyze and to understand. I remember
three or four of his thievings. You can see in each the workings of
the universal Law.</p>

<p>I said this man went to school to me, as a boy. Lots of people
have gone to school to me, one time or another. There's no better
way to get acquainted with a person than to try to teach him
something. I've become mighty well acquainted with some people, in
that fashion; and I came to know this man, Arthur Jessop, through
and through, during the year he lived under my roof, when I was
instructor and house master in a certain private school...</p>

<p>It was toward the end of his year with us that the thing
happened about which I propose to tell you. Oh, there had been
other incidents that I had let pass without comment. He was a boy I
disliked from the beginning. This may have been one of those
instinctive repugnances for which it is impossible to account; but
I think it was prompted by the fact that he had not even the
rudimentary sense of honor which other boys were developing, at
that age. He would lie, for example; and he seemed to enjoy it.
Most healthy boys hate to lie.</p>

<p>I had tried to straighten him out as well as I could.</p>

<p>I put him to room with Roy Ward, a boy a little older than
himself, small and frail, and too much inclined to his books,
hoping each would be good for the other; but before the end of the
year I knew this experiment was not going to succeed.</p>

<p>The thing I want to set forth came along with the June
examinations. These examinations were rather important&mdash;in the
eyes of the boys, for many of them were preparing for college and
wished to make sure of getting there. Roy Ward, I remember, spent
all his spare time in studying. But Arthur was not working, and
once or twice I advised him to buckle down. He had a careless
assurance, told me that he wasn't worried; and it was, after all,
not my affair how much he studied, so long as he passed the
examination.</p>

<p>My courses were in mathematics&mdash;algebra and
geometry&mdash;and Arthur was in two of my classes. He had an alert
mind; extraordinarily so. But he did not care to put in the
necessary digging, so that he was shaky on fundamentals. I thought
he would have trouble with the final papers.</p>

<p>As the time for the examinations approached, Arthur began to
question me, more or less skilfully, in an effort to find what the
questions would be like. I, of course, gave him no satisfaction;
but I watched him. Most of my work was done at my desk at home; and
this desk was in my bedroom. He and Roy were in a room on the floor
above. Twice I came out from my room to find Arthur in the hall,
apparently just passing through. It occurred to me that he was
watching me as closely as I was watching him.</p>

<p>So I did a thing that was perhaps unfair. I drafted the
examination papers in algebra and in geometry put them in
envelopes, labelled them, and left them in a pigeon hole of my
desk. Twenty problems on each paper, and all as simple and as easy
as I could make them. Then I put in the big pad on the desk a fresh
blotter, untirely unmarked, its soft surface without a depression;
and I left it there when I went across the lawn to the school
building to act as monitor of the study hour for the smaller
boys.</p>

<p>From the school window, I could see the side door of my house;
and toward midafternoon, I saw Arthur go in at this door. He was
inside perhaps twenty minutes, then came out again. When I went
home, just before dinner, I held the blotter toward the light and
saw, as I had expected, that it was covered with depressions. In
places I could recognize Arthur's handwriting. He had brought a
sheet or two of paper from his room and copied the examination
questions in pencil; and the pressure of the pencil had marked the
blotter.</p>

<p>I debated for a while, what to do; and eventually decided to say
nothing to the boy at the time. But I was careful to prepare new
examination papers, and stiff ones; and when the day of the
examination came, and Arthur tackled it, it was almost amusing to
see his consternation. He had memorized the solutions to the easy
problems on the other papers; but he was completely at a loss
before the new questions. I graded the other boys' papers
leniently; but with him I was severe. And I flunked him on the
course.</p>

<p>The point is, he could have passed the examination with a little
work, could probably have passed it anyway but for the shock of
surprise when he found that he had been fooled. As it was, he
failed; and we refused to pass him for college.</p>

<p>He and his mother came to me to try to make some arrangement. I
told him the truth. Arthur denied it, and his mother believed him;
and they threatened to sue the school. But of course, they did not
do so. He tutored through the summer, and passed the college
entrance examinations in the fall. But as far as his theft of the
questions was concerned, you perceive, he had his trouble for his
pains.</p>

<p>After Jessup went to college I heard no more of him for a number
of years, except in the most indirect way. I knew that he and Roy
Ward had roomed together, during their freshman year; and I knew
that Arthur had played baseball sufficiently well to make his
college team, and that he was good enough at football to be a
substitute outside. But Arthur never came back to the school
reunions, and neither did Roy Ward. Some of the other boys came
back; and from them I heard that Arthur and Roy had broken up their
friendship; that they had quarrelled; and that the weight of
Arthur's college popularity had made Roy correspondingly
unpopular.</p>

<p>Knowing the two boys as I did, I wondered; and when Roy came
back to school in June of the seventh year after he left us, I made
occasion to get him to myself and to approach the subject of his
trouble with Arthur.</p>

<p>Roy told me the story reluctantly; and I saw that he was
reluctant because he thought I would not believe him. He had grown
into a shy, awkward, uncertain young man; one of those men who seem
always to have their tails between their legs. I was sorry for
him...</p>

<p>The thing was simple enough. The two had, as I said, roomed
together. Arthur had the commercial instinct highly developed; and
toward the end of their freshman year he conceived a plan for
making some money. The plan was not original with him; such things
are done in college, year by year. But&mdash;he invited Roy into
partnership. They were to buy from graduating seniors as much
furniture as they could finance and store; and in September they
would sell this furniture to incoming freshmen. Roy had no fitness
for either buying or selling; but&mdash;he had money, while
Arthur's father and mother were not well-to-do. The agreement was
that Roy should furnish the money; that Arthur should do the work;
and that they should split the profits equally.</p>

<p>Roy told me that it wasn't till after they came back to college
in the fall, that he found out what Arthur had done. Roy
said:&mdash;"When the furniture was all sold, Arthur came to
me&mdash;we didn't room together that year, anyway&mdash;and said
he hadn't done well; that the storage charges had been heavier than
he thought, and that the freshmen would not pay the prices he
asked... He said the profit had been less than twenty dollars; and
he gave me back the money I had furnished, and persuaded me to let
him keep all the profits, because he had worked so hard.</p>

<p>"He was clever, too. Our original agreement had been in writing,
like a note for the money I had loaned him; and he said the
simplest thing was just for me to receipt the note, showing he
didn't owe me any money. So I did."</p>

<p>Then Roy began to discover that Arthur had bilked him. Arthur
had kept books, of a sort. These books showed the price paid for
each piece of furniture, and the price received. Names of buyer and
seller were not given. But Roy happened upon a leather couch in a
freshman's room, which he happened to recognize; and he asked the
boy how much the couch had cost. The answer set him
investigating.</p>

<p>He found that Arthur had paid less than the figures on the
books; had charged more. "It wasn't much," Roy told me.</p>

<p>"I don't think he made over a hundred dollars out of it. But it
made me mad, and I hunted him up, and accused him of it..."</p>

<p>But his case was, of course, hopeless. Arthur had his signed
release; he had back of him the weight of his popularity as an
athlete and a good fellow, while Roy was a solitary, and a student.
And Arthur simply said that Roy lied. It broke Roy up rather badly,
spoiled his four years in college, and went far, I thought, to
spoil his life...</p>

<p>I asked him what Arthur did with the money. "Lost it," Roy told
me. "He played poker with some fellows who had more money than he,
and lost a lot, that fall. Mine went with the rest, I suppose. I
remember he worked in a club, the rest of that year, to pay his
board."</p>

<p>That was the story as I got it from Roy. I've no reason to doubt
that it was true. You might call it Jessop's second theft.</p>

<p>The next time I heard of him, it was from a man who had known
him in school under me. What I'm going to tell now, I got from him;
and later on, I met Charlie Day himself, and Charlie said it was
true.</p>

<p>It seems that when Arthur left college, he went to work as a
bond salesman. Such places pay very small salaries; but a good man
makes money out of his commissions. Arthur had the instincts of a
salesman; he could have made a legitimate success in that line. And
he did, at the first, rather well. His house had taken him on
because of his college record; he had the momentum of his college
successes behind him; and after a year or two, he must have had a
comfortable and an increasing income.</p>

<p>About that time, he went up to Worcester on a bond-selling
expedition; and because he had friends everywhere, he was invited
to one of the country clubs, and to a dance or two. It was at the
club that he met the girl he married. Her name was Laura Marsh; and
when Arthur met her, she was engaged to this Charlie Day, one of
his college classmates. Charlie introduced him to her.</p>

<p>Jessop's reputation, where women were concerned, was later on to
become very bad indeed; but at that time his exploits had either
not begun, or they had been well hidden. He became infatuated with
Laura Marsh; and the unscrupulous strain which was a part of him by
that time made him determine to marry her. To marry her, in spite
of the fact that she was already engaged, and had been for a matter
of a year, to Charlie. They were waiting till Charlie had enough
money to support a wife.</p>

<p>Arthur Jessop set out to steal her. He succeeded. The man had
charm; he was shrewd. He paid Laura the sort of attention she had
always longed for; the sort Charlie Day had not enough imagination
to devise. He made her like him, made her fond of him, made her
want to see much of him. She was, apparently, of a romantic tum;
and he boasted, years afterward, of how he cajoled her. "You should
always do something to make a girl remember you," he explained. "I
could see she was romantic. So when I bade her good night, that
first night, I kissed her hand."</p>

<p>The mechanics of his conquest are not worth repeating. He had,
remember, the college glamour still about him. On his third trip to
Worcester, he was satisfied that Laura was sufficiently won to be
willing to marry him if she were free. But she had scruples, which
he recognized.</p>

<p>He met these scruples by lying about Charlie Day to her, lying
as lago did, as though unwillingly and under compulsion. He excited
her curiosity by veiled suggestions, then answered with apparent
reluctance the questions she put to him. After they were divorced,
when he was in his cups, he used to brag about these matters...</p>

<p>About that time, Charlie Day went down to Boston, and Arthur
took him to dinner in the evening, and they went to the theatre
afterward. When Arthur next saw Laura Marsh, she spoke of this
evening they two had spent together. Arthur showed surprise, a
little chagrin. "Did Charlie tell you about that?" he asked, in an
astonished tone.</p>

<p>Laura said: "Why, yes. Why not?"</p>

<p>"I didn't think he would," Arthur replied.</p>

<p>And so she questioned him; and so, with reluctance in every
gesture, he told her the final lie. Told her they had been accosted
by two girls, upon the street; told her Charlie had gone, with one
of these girls, to a private dining-room in the café. "Of course, I
ditched the other girl," Arthur assured her. "Then I waited around
to meet Charlie as we had planned. He was going to spend the night
with me."</p>

<p>"Did he?" Laura asked.</p>

<p>And Arthur said: "No. No, he didn't come."</p>

<p>Two days later she went to Boston, ostensibly for shopping, and
she and Arthur were secretly married there. They planned to keep it
secret; but Charlie Day, with the instinct of a lover, half guessed
and half discovered what had happened.</p>

<p>He went to see Laura. She was still in the first flood of her
infatuation; and she told him the truth, told why she had abandoned
him. So Charlie sought out Jessop, and in his slow, thorough way,
gave the man a thrashing. Then set hopelessly to work to prove that
Arthur had bed.</p>

<p>Of course, he could not do that. Jessop had been too clever. And
after a month or two, Charlie gave it up; but he continued to
worship Laura, silently, as such men will... He seems to have been
sure she would turn to him, some day.</p>

<p>And he was right, Jessop had stolen her, but he could not keep
her. It is often so with stolen goods. Two or three months after
they were married, they began housekeeping in a little flat in
Brookline. But a month after that she left him, left him and went
home, probably Charlie knows why, but no one else. Arthur tried to
get her back; but when he found he could not, he was not long in
giving her grounds enough for half-a-dozen divorces. In the end she
married Charlie. They have two boys now, coming toward manhood, I
believe.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
That winning of Laura Marsh seems to have been the crest of
Jessop's career. After that, he began to go steadily downhill.</p>

<p>I said he did well, in the beginning, as a bond salesman. Might
have continued to do well, for he was in the employ of one of the
three oldest and soundest houses in Boston. But the man was a thief
by nature; he was not satisfied to plod.</p>

<p>About five years after he left college and after his divorce,
boom times came along. One of those periods when the market goes up
and up, when every one seems to have money for any investment that
is offered, and when the wildest schemes are floated successfully,
and gold bricks turn to gold. Arthur was in clover. He had never
made so much money before; and after a little while, he was not
satisfied with legitimate profits, but began reaching out for
something more.</p>

<p>I occasionally bought a bond from his house; and one day he
called upon me to see if I wished to take any new securities. I had
accumulated a little surplus capital. Even a school teacher
sometimes succeeds in saving money, you know; and I bought a
thousand dollar railroad bond that seemed to be thoroughly
sound.</p>

<p>When we had arranged that, Arthur looked at me with that old
assurance in his eyes, and asked quizzically: "Are you inclined to
take on a little speculation?"</p>

<p>I said I was not, of course; nevertheless he produced a folder
and handed it to me.</p>

<p>"There's a fine chance," he said. "I tell you frankly, it's a
gamble. You may never get a dividend; and you may never get your
principal back. It's a pure gamble. But if it wins, a hundred
dollar bond will be worth a thousand in a year's time."</p>

<p>I refused again, and he accepted my refusal; but I remembered
the incident when his smash up came, a month later. He had been
marketing worthless bits of paper, in this way, among the clients
of his house, and pocketing the proceeds. It was ingenious enough.
A man who had put one or five or ten thousand dollars into sound
paper might very readily put a hundred into even so pure a gamble
as this one of Arthur's. He had made no false representations;
there was no law that touched him. But his employers discharged
him; and the incident gave him a black eye in the financial world,
from which he did not recover.</p>

<p>Arthur himself laughed at it, at first. He had made a
substantial sum out of his trickery; but he lost it by going short
on that boom market, and then he tried to get another job. I heard
that he had failed to get work with any bond house; then he was
involved in a swindling scheme, and barely escaped the law; and
after that he took to the road as a clothing salesman. They
discharged him for falsifying his expense accounts.</p>

<p>That was the last I heard of him, until I met him up town the
other day. I talked with him a little while. He said he had had
mighty hard luck; that he kept losing every job he got, somehow...
You could read his story in his face.</p>

<p>He was trying to sell one of the clothing stores up town a line
of cheap and worthless jewelry. And he had no luck at it. The stuff
was the barest fraud, on its very face. Shiny gilt and dull
stones... And Jessop himself had a whine in his voice that was
enough to brand him.</p>

<p>He was shabbily dressed. A threadbare, dingy collar, and
ravelings on the edges of his cuffs. Bags under his eyes. A wreck
of a man. I can remember, even now, what an upstanding youngster he
used to be. It made me feel pretty badly; and when he begged a
loan, I gave him a five dollar bill and wished him luck.</p>

<p>I saw him grin behind my back, when he thought I had turned
away. He left town on the noon train... Don't suppose I'll ever see
Arthur Jessop again.</p>

<p>Bill fell silent, and for a moment neither of us spoke. Then he
looked toward me, as though to hear my comment.</p>

<p>"You see, I was right," I told him. "He brags of how he fooled
his wife; brags, no doubt, of how he fooled his customers. Calls
the whole world 'boob', just as he thought you a fool for giving
him that money."</p>

<p>"Doubtless," Bill assented. "But that is not what I mean. To
come to think all men are fools is not sufficient punishment for a
thief; there is a heavier."</p>

<p>I, puzzled for a moment, could not see. "Then what is the
penalty?" I asked.</p>

<p>Bill puffed slowly at his pipe. "Arthur stole the examination
questions&mdash;and did not get them," he reminded me. "He stole
from Roy Ward, and lost the money. He stole a wife&mdash;and could
not keep her. He stole from his customers&mdash;and the loot
slipped through his fingers. Always his thefts have been fruitless.
That is the real punishment of thieving."</p>

<p>"That what you steal you cannot keep?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That what you steal you cannot keep," he agreed. The stars
overhead were bright; the blurred whiteness of the Milky Way
touched the horizon northeast of where we sat. A miracle of order
in the heavens; and Bill lifted a hand to point that way. "There's
a Law down here as there is up there," he said. "A Way to be
followed, and a fit punishment for leaving of the Way. Arthur
Jessop stole&mdash;and his stealing netted him nothing at all.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all. That's the thief's wage. He was paid his wage,
you see."</p>
