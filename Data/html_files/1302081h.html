  <h2><a id="ch1-1"
     name="ch1-1">CHAPTER I.<br>
  The Three Cranes in the Vintry.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Adjoining the Vintry Wharf, and at the corner of a narrow
  lane communicating with Thames Street, there stood, in the early part of the
  Seventeenth Century, a tavern called the Three Cranes. This old and renowned
  place of entertainment had then been in existence more than two hundred
  years, though under other designations. In the reign of Richard II., when it
  was first established, it was styled the Painted Tavern, from the
  circumstance of its outer walls being fancifully coloured and adorned with
  Bacchanalian devices. But these decorations went out of fashion in time, and
  the tavern, somewhat changing its external features, though preserving all
  its internal comforts and accommodation, assumed the name of the Three
  Crowns, under which title it continued until the accession of Elizabeth, when
  it became (by a slight modification) the Three Cranes; and so remained in the
  days of her successor, and, indeed, long afterwards.</p>

  <p>Not that the last-adopted denomination had any reference, as might be
  supposed, to the three huge wooden instruments on the wharf, employed with
  ropes and pulleys to unload the lighters and other vessels that brought up
  butts and hogsheads of wine from the larger craft below Bridge, and
  constantly thronged the banks; though, no doubt, they indirectly suggested
  it. The Three Cranes depicted on the large signboard, suspended in front of
  the tavern, were long-necked, long-beaked birds, each with a golden fish in
  its bill.</p>

  <p>But under whatever designation it might be known&mdash;Crown or
  Crane&mdash;the tavern had always maintained a high reputation for excellence
  of wine: and this is the less surprising when we take into account its close
  proximity to the vast vaults and cellars of the Vintry, where the choicest
  produce of Gascony, Bordeaux, and other wine-growing districts, was
  deposited; some of which we may reasonably conclude would find its way to its
  tables. Good wine, it may be incidentally remarked, was cheap enough when the
  Three Cranes was first opened, the delicate juice of the Gascoign grape being
  then vended, at fourpence the gallon, and Rhenish at sixpence! Prices,
  however, had risen considerably at the period of which we propose to treat;
  but the tavern was as well-reputed and well-frequented as ever: even more so,
  for it had considerably advanced in estimation since it came into the hands
  of a certain enterprising French skipper, Prosper Bonaventure by name, who
  intrusted its management to his active and pretty little wife Dameris, while
  he himself prosecuted his trading voyages between the Garonne and the Thames.
  And very well Madame Bonaventure fulfilled the duties of hostess, as will be
  seen.</p>

  <p>Now, as the skipper was a very sharp fellow, and perfectly understood his
  business-practically anticipating the Transatlantic axiom of buying at the
  cheapest market and gelling at the dearest-he soon contrived to grow rich. He
  did more: he pleased his customers at the Three Cranes. Taking care to select
  his wines judiciously, and having good opportunities, he managed to obtain
  possession of some delicious vintages, which, could not be matched elsewhere;
  and, with this nectar at his command, the fortune of his house was made. All
  the town gallants flocked to the Three Cranes to dine at the admirable French
  ordinary newly established there, and crush a flask or so of the exquisite
  Bordeaux, about which, and its delicate flavour and bouquet, all the
  connoisseurs in claret were raving. From, mid-day, therefore, till late in
  the afternoon, there were nearly as many gay barges and wherries as lighters
  lying off the Vintry Wharf; and sometimes, when accommodation was wanting,
  the little craft were moored along the shore all the way from Queenhithe to
  the Steelyard; at which latter place the Catherine Wheel was almost as much
  noted for racy Rhenish and high-dried neat's tongues, as our tavern was for
  fine Bordeaux and well-seasoned pâtés.</p>

  <p>Not the least, however, of the attractions of the Three Cranes, was the
  hostess herself. A lively little brunette was Madame Bonaventure, still
  young, or, at all events, very far from being old; with extremely fine teeth,
  which she was fond of displaying, and a remarkably neat ancle, which she felt
  no inclination to hide beneath the sweep of her round circling farthingale.
  Her figure was quite that of a miniature Venus; and as, like most of her
  country-women, she understood the art of dress to admiration, she set off her
  person to the best advantage; always attiring herself in a style, and in
  colours, that suited her, and never indulging in an unwarrantable
  extravagance of ruff, or absurd and unbecoming length of peaked boddice. As
  to the stuffs she wore, they were certainly above her station, for no Court
  dame could boast of richer silks than those in which the pretty Dameris
  appeared on fête days; and this was accounted for by reason that the good
  skipper seldom returned from a trip to France without bringing his wife a
  piece of silk, brocade, or velvet from Lyons; or some little matter from
  Paris, such as a ruff, cuff, partlet, bandlet, or fillet. Thus the last
  French mode might be seen at the Three Crowns, displayed by the hostess, as
  well as the last French <i>entremet</i> at its table; since, among other
  important accessories to the well-doing of the house, Madame Bonaventure kept
  a <i>chef de cuisine</i>&mdash;one of her compatriots&mdash;of such
  superlative skill, that in later times he must infallibly have been
  distinguished as a <i>cordon bleu</i>.</p>

  <p>But not having yet completed our description of the charming Bordelaise we
  must add that she possessed a rich southern complexion, fine sparkling black
  eyes, shaded by long dark eye-lashes, and over-arched by jetty brows, and
  that her raven hair was combed back and gathered in a large roll over her
  smooth forehead, which had the five points of beauty complete. Over this she
  wore a prettily-conceived coif, with a frontlet. A well-starched,
  well-plaited ruff encompossed her throat. Her upper lip was darkened, but in
  the slightest degree, by down like the softest silk; and this peculiarity (a
  peculiarity it would be in an Englishwoman, though frequently observable in
  the beauties of the South of France) lent additional piquancy and zest to her
  charms in the eyes of her numerous adorers. Her ankles we have said were
  trim; and it may be added that they were oftener displayed in an embroidered
  French velvet shoe than in one of Spanish leather; while in walking out she
  increased her stature "by the altitude of a chopine."</p>

  <p>Captain Bonaventure was by no means jealous; and even if he had been, it
  would have mattered little, since he was so constantly away. Fancying,
  therefore, she had some of the privileges of a widow, our lively Dameris
  flirted a good deal with the gayest and handsomest of the galliards
  frequenting her house. But she knew where to stop; no licence or indecorum
  was ever permitted at the Three Cranes; and that is saying a great deal in
  favour of the hostess, when the dissolute character of the age is taken into
  consideration. Besides this, Cyprien, a stout well-favoured young Gascon, who
  filled the posts of drawer and chamberlain, together with two or three other
  trencher-scrapers, who served at table, and waited on the guests, were
  generally sufficient to clear the house of any troublesome roysterers. Thus
  the reputation of the Three Cranes was unblemished, in spite of the
  liveliness and coquetry of its mistress; and in spite, also, of the malicious
  tongues of rival tavern-keepers, which were loud against it. A pretty woman
  is sure to have enemies and calumniators, and Madame Bonaventure had more
  than enow; but she thought very little about them.</p>

  <p>There was one point, however, on which it behoved her to be careful: and
  extremely careful she was,&mdash;not leaving a single loop-hole for censure
  or attack. This was the question of religion. On first taking the house,
  Madame Bonaventure gave it out that she and the skipper were Huguenots,
  descended from families who had suffered much persecution during the time of
  the League, for staunch adherence to their faith; and the statement was
  generally credited, though there were some who professed to doubt it. Certain
  it was, our hostess did not wear any cross, beads, or other outward symbol of
  Papacy. And though this might count for little, it was never discovered that
  she attended mass in secret. Her movements were watched, but without anything
  coming to light that had reference to religious observances of any kind.
  Those who tried to trace her, found that her visits were mostly paid to Paris
  Garden, the Rose, and the Globe (where our immortal bard's plays were then
  being performed), or some other place of amusement; and if she did go on the
  river at times, it was merely upon a party of pleasure, accompanied by gay
  gallants in velvet cloaks and silken doublets, and by light-hearted dames
  like herself, and not by notorious plotters or sour priests. Still, as many
  Bordeaux merchants frequented the house, as well as traders from the Hanse
  towns, and other foreigners, it was looked upon by the suspicious as a hotbed
  of Romish heresy and treason. Moreover, these maligners affirmed that English
  recusants, as well as seminary priests from abroad, had been harboured there,
  and clandestinely spirited away from the pursuit of justice by the skipper;
  but the charges were never substantiated, and could, therefore, only proceed
  from envy and malice. Whatever Madame Bonaventure's religious opinions might
  be, she kept her own council so well that no one ever found them out.</p>

  <p>But evil days were at hand. Hitherto, all had been smiling and prosperous.
  The prospect now began to darken.</p>

  <p>Within the last twelve months a strange and unlooked for interference had
  taken place with our hostess's profits, which she had viewed, at first,
  without much anxiety, because she did not clearly comprehend its scope; but
  latterly, as its formidable character became revealed, it began to fill her
  with uneasiness. The calamity, as she naturally enough regarded it, arose in
  the following manner. The present was an age of monopolies and patents,
  granted by a crown ever eager to obtain money under any pretext, however
  unjustifiable and iniquitous, provided it was plausibly coloured; and these
  vexatious privileges were purchased by greedy and unscrupulous persons for
  the purpose of turning them into instruments of extortion and wrong. Though
  various branches of trade and industry groaned under the oppression inflicted
  upon them, there were no means of redress. The patentees enjoyed perfect
  immunity, grinding them down as they pleased, farming out whole districts,
  and dividing the spoil. Their miserable victims dared scarcely murmur; having
  ever the terrible court of Star-Chamber before them, which their persecutors
  could command, and which punished libellers&mdash;as they would be accounted,
  if they gave utterance to their wrongs, and charged their oppressors with
  mis-doing,&mdash;with fine, branding, and the pillory. Many were handled in
  this sort, and held up <i>in terrorem</i> to the others. Hence it came to
  pass, that the Star-Chamber, from the fearful nature of its machinery; its
  extraordinary powers; the notorious corruption and venality of its officers;
  the peculiarity of its practice, which always favoured the plaintiff; and the
  severity with which it punished any libelling or slanderous words uttered
  against the king's representative (as the patentees were considered), or any
  conspiracy or false accusation brought against them; it came to pass, we say,
  that this terrible court became as much dreaded in Protestant England as the
  Inquisition in Catholic Spain. The punishments inflicted by the Star-Chamber
  were, as we learn from a legal authority, and a counsel in the court, "fine,
  imprisonment, loss of ears, or nailing to the pillory, slitting the nose,
  branding the forehead, whipping of late days, wearing of papers in public
  places, or any punishment but death." And John Chamberlain, Esq., writing to
  Sir Dudley Carlton, about the same period, observes, that "The world is now
  much terrified with the Star-Chamber, there being not so little an offence
  against any proclamation, but is liable and subject to the censure of that
  court. And for proclamations and patents, they are become so ordinary that
  there is no end; every day bringing forth some new project or other. As,
  within these two days, here is one come forth for tobacco, wholly engrossed
  by Sir Thomas Roe and his partners, which, if they can keep and maintain
  against the general clamour, will be a great commodity; unless, peradventure,
  indignation, rather than all other reasons, may bring that filthy weed out of
  use." [What, would be the effect of such a patent now-a-days? Would it, at
  all, restrict the use of the "filthy weed?"] "In truth," proceeds
  Chamberlain, "the world doth even groan under the burthen of these perpetual
  patents, which are become so frequent, that whereas at the king's coming in
  there were complaints of some eight or nine monopolies then in being, they
  are now said to be multiplied to as many scores."</p>

  <p>From the foregoing citation, from a private letter of the time, the state
  of public feeling may be gathered, and the alarm occasioned in all classes by
  these oppressions perfectly understood.</p>

  <p>Amongst those who had obtained the largest share of spoil were two persons
  destined to occupy a prominent position in our history. They were Sir Giles
  Mompesson and Sir Francis Mitchell,&mdash;both names held in general dread
  and detestation, though no man ventured to speak ill of them openly, since
  they were as implacable in their animosities, as usurious and griping in
  their demands; and many an ear had been lost, many a nose slit, many a back
  scourged at the cart's tail, because the unfortunate owners had stigmatized
  them according to their deserts. Thus they enjoyed a complete immunity of
  wrong; and, with the terrible court of Star-Chamber to defend them and to
  punish their enemies, they set all opposition at defiance.</p>

  <p>Insatiable as unscrupulous, this avaricious pair were ever on the alert to
  devise new means of exaction and plunder, and amongst the latest and most
  productive of their inventions were three patents, which they had obtained
  through the instrumentality of Sir Edward Villiers (half-brother of the
  ruling favourite, the Marquess of Buckingham)&mdash;and for due
  consideration-money, of course,&mdash;for the licensing of ale-houses the
  inspection of inns and hostelries, and the exclusive manufacture of gold and
  silver thread. It is with the two former of these that we have now to deal;
  inasmuch as it was their mischievous operation that affected Madame
  Bonaventure so prejudicially; and this we shall more fully explain, as it
  will serve to show the working of a frightful system of extortion and
  injustice happily no longer in existence.</p>

  <p>By the sweeping powers conferred upon them by their patents, the whole of
  the inns of the metropolis were brought under the control of the two
  extortioners, who levied such imposts as they pleased. The withdrawal of a
  license, or the total suppression of a tavern, on the plea of its being a
  riotous and disorderly house, immediately followed the refusal of any demand,
  however excessive; and most persons preferred the remote possibility of ruin,
  with the chance of averting it by ready submission, to the positive certainty
  of losing both substance and liberty by resistance.</p>

  <p>Fearful was the havoc occasioned by these licensed depredators, yet no one
  dared to check them&mdash;no one ventured to repine. They had the name of law
  to justify their proceedings, and all its authority to uphold them.
  Compromises were attempted in some instances, but they were found unavailing.
  Easily evaded by persons who never intended to be bound by them, they only
  added keenness to the original provocation, without offering a remedy for it.
  The two bloodsuckers, it was clear, would not desist from draining the
  life-current from the veins of their victims while a drop remained. And they
  were well served in their iniquitous task,&mdash;for the plain reason that
  they paid their agents, well. Partners they had none; none, at least, who
  cared to acknowledge themselves as such. But the subordinate officers of the
  law (and indeed some high in office, it was hinted), the sheriff's followers,
  bailiffs, tipstaves, and others, were all in their pay; besides a host of
  myrmidons,&mdash;base, sordid knaves, who scrupled not at false-swearing,
  cozenage, or any sort of rascality, even forgery of legal documents, if
  required.</p>

  <p>No wonder poor Madame Bonaventure, finding she had got into the clutches
  of these harpies, began to tremble for the result.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-2"
     name="ch1-2">CHAPTER II.<br>
  Sir Giles Mompesson and His Partner.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Madame Bonaventure had already paid considerable sums to the
  two extortioners, but she resisted their last application; in consequence of
  which she received a monition from Sir Giles Mompesson, to the effect that,
  in a month's time, her license would be withdrawn, and her house shut up,
  unless, in the interim, she consented to make amends to himself and his
  co-patentee, Sir Francis Mitchell, by payment of the sum in question,
  together with a further sum, equal to it in amount, by way of forfeit; thus
  doubling the original demand.</p>

  <p>Our pretty hostess, it would seem, had placed herself in an awkward
  predicament by her temerity. Sir Giles was not a man to threaten idly, as all
  who had incurred his displeasure experienced to their cost. His plan was to
  make himself feared; and he was inexorable, as fate itself, to a creditor. He
  ever exacted the full penalty of his bond. In this instance, according to his
  own notion, he had acted with great leniency; and certainly, judged by his
  customary mode of proceeding in such cases, he had shown some little
  indulgence. In this line of conduct he had been mainly influenced by his
  partner, who, not being insensible to the attractions of the fair hostess,
  hoped to win her favour by a show of consideration. But though Madame
  Bonaventure was willing enough, for her own purposes, to encourage Sir
  Francis Mitchell's attentions (she detested him in her secret heart), she by
  no means relied upon him for security. A more powerful friend was held in
  reserve, whom she meant to produce at the last moment; and, consequently, she
  was not so ill at ease as she otherwise would have been, though by no means
  free from misgiving.</p>

  <p>Sir Giles Mompesson was a terrible enemy, and seldom thwarted in his
  purpose. That she knew. But no man was more keenly alive to his own interest
  than he; and she persuaded herself he would find it to his advantage not to
  molest her: in which case she was safe. Of Sir Francis Mitchell she had less
  apprehension; for, though equally mischievous and malevolent with his
  partner, he was far feebler of purpose, and for the most part governed by
  him. Besides, she felt she had the amorous knight in her toils, and could
  easily manage him if he were alone.</p>

  <p>So the case stood with respect to our pretty hostess; but, before
  proceeding further, it may be well to give a more complete description of the
  two birds of prey by whom she was threatened with beak and talon.</p>

  <p>The master-spirit of the twain was undoubtedly Sir Giles Mompesson. Quick
  in conception of villainy, he was equally daring in execution. How he had
  risen to his present bad eminence no one precisely knew; because, with the
  craft and subtlety that distinguished him, he laid his schemes so deeply, and
  covered his proceedings with so thick a veil, that they had been rarely
  detected. Report, however, spoke of him as a usurer of the vilest kind, who
  wrung exorbitant interest from needy borrowers,&mdash;who advanced money to
  expectant heirs, with the intention of plundering them of their
  inheritance,&mdash;and who resorted to every trick and malpractice permitted
  by the law to benefit himself at his neighbour's expense. These were bad
  enough, but even graver accusations were made against him. It was whispered
  that he had obtained fraudulent possession of deeds and family papers, which
  had enabled him to wrest estates from their rightful owners; and some did not
  scruple to add to these charges that he had forged documents to carry out his
  nefarious designs. Be this as it may, from comparative poverty he speedily
  rose to wealth; and, as his means increased, so his avaricious schemes were
  multiplied and extended. His earlier days were passed in complete obscurity,
  none but the neediest spendthrift or the most desperate gambler knowing where
  he dwelt, and every one who found him out in his wretched abode near the
  Marshalsea had reason to regret his visit. Now he was well enough known by
  many a courtly prodigal, and his large mansion near Fleet Bridge (it was said
  of him that he always chose the neigbourhood of a prison for his dwelling)
  was resorted to by the town gallants whose, necessities or extravagance
  compelled them to obtain supplies at exorbitant interest. Lavish in his
  expenditure on occasions, Sir Giles was habitually so greedy and penurious,
  that he begrudged every tester he expended. He wished to keep up a show of
  hospitality without cost, and secretly pleased himself by thinking that he
  made his guests pay for his entertainments, and even for his establishment.
  His servants complained of being half-starved, though he was constantly at
  war with them for their wastefulness and riot. He made, however, a great
  display of attendants, inasmuch as he had a whole retinue of myrmidons at his
  beck and call; and these, as before observed, were well paid. They were the
  crows that followed the vultures, and picked the bones of the spoil when
  their ravening masters had been fully glutted.</p>

  <p>In the court of Star-Chamber, as already remarked, Sir Giles Mompesson
  found an instrument in every way fitted to his purposes; and he worked it
  with terrible effect, as will be shown hereafter. With him it was at once a
  weapon to destroy, and a shield to protect. This court claimed "a superlative
  power not only to take causes from other courts and punish them there, but
  also to punish offences secondarily, when other courts have punished them."
  Taking advantage of this privilege, when a suit was commenced against him
  elsewhere, Sir Giles contrived to remove it to the Star-Chamber, where, being
  omnipotent with clerks and counsel, he was sure of success,&mdash;the
  complaints being so warily contrived, the examinations so adroitly framed,
  and the interrogatories so numerous and perplexing, that the defendant, or
  delinquent, as he was indifferently styled, was certain to be baffled and
  defeated. "The sentences of this court," it has been said by one intimately
  acquainted with its practice, and very favourably inclined to it, "strike to
  the root of men's reputations, and many times of their estates;" and, again,
  it was a rule with it, that the prosecutor "was ever intended to be
  favoured." Knowing this as well as the high legal authority from whom we have
  quoted, Sir Giles ever placed himself in the favoured position, and, with the
  aid of this iniquitous tribunal, blasted many a fair reputation, and
  consigned many a victim of its injustice to the Fleet, there to rot till he
  paid him the utmost of his demands, or paid the debt of nature.</p>

  <p>In an age less corrupt and venal than that under consideration, such a
  career could not have long continued without check. But in the time of James
  the First, from the neediness of the monarch himself, and the rapacity of his
  minions and courtiers and their satellites,&mdash;each striving to enrich
  himself, no matter how&mdash;a thousand abuses, both of right and justice,
  were tolerated or connived at, crime stalking abroad unpunished. The
  Star-Chamber itself served the king as, in a less degree, it served Sir Giles
  Mompesson, and others of the same stamp, as a means of increasing his
  revenue; half the fines mulcted from those who incurred its censure or its
  punishments being awarded to the crown. Thus nice inquiries were rarely made,
  unless a public example was needed, when the wrongdoer was compelled to
  disgorge his plunder. But this was never done till the pear was fully ripe.
  Sir Giles, however, had no apprehensions of any such result in his case. Like
  a sly fox, or rather like a crafty wolf, he was too confident in his own
  cunning and resources to fear being caught in such a trap.</p>

  <p>His title was purchased, and he reaped his reward in the consequence it
  gave him. Sir Francis Mitchell acted likewise; and it was about this time
  that the connection between the worthy pair commenced. Hitherto they had been
  in opposition, and though very different in temperament and in modes of
  proceeding, they had one aim in common; and recognizing great merit in each
  other, coupled with a power of mutual assistance, they agreed to act in
  concert. Sir Francis was as cautious and timid as Sir Giles was daring and
  inflexible: the one being the best contriver of a scheme, and the other the
  fittest to carry it out. Sir Francis trembled at his own devices and their
  possible consequences: Sir Giles adopted his schemes, if promising, and
  laughed at the difficulties and dangers that beset them. The one was the
  head; the other the arm. Not that Sir Giles lacked the ability to weave as
  subtle a web of deceit as his partner; but each took his line. It saved time.
  The plan of licensing and inspecting taverns and hotels had originated with
  Sir Francis, and very profitable it proved. But Sir Giles carried it out much
  further than his partner had proposed, or thought prudent.</p>

  <p>And they were as different in personal appearance, as in mental qualities
  and disposition. Mompesson was the dashing eagle; Mitchell the sorry kite.
  Sir Francis was weakly, emaciated in frame; much given to sensual indulgence;
  and his body conformed to his timorous organization. His shrunken shanks
  scarcely sufficed to support him; his back was bent; his eyes blear; his head
  bald; and his chin, which was continually wagging, clothed with a scanty
  yellow beard, shaped like a stiletto, while his sandy moustachios were curled
  upward. He was dressed in the extremity of the fashion, and affected the air
  of a young court gallant. His doublet, hose, and mantle were ever of the
  gayest and most fanciful hues, and of the richest stuffs; he wore a diamond
  brooch in his beaver, and sashes, tied like garters, round his thin legs,
  which were utterly destitute of calf. Preposterously large roses covered his
  shoes; his ruff was a "treble-quadruple-dedalion;" his gloves richly
  embroidered; a large crimson satin purse hung from his girdle; and he was
  scented with powders and pulvilios. This withered coxcomb affected the
  mincing gait of a young man; and though rather an object of derision than
  admiration with the fair sex, persuaded himself they were all captivated by
  him. The vast sums he so unjustly acquired did not long remain in his
  possession, but were dispersed in ministering to his follies and depravity.
  Timorous he was by nature, as we have said, but cruel and unrelenting in
  proportion to his cowardice; and where an injury could be securely inflicted,
  or a prostrate foe struck with impunity, he never hesitated for a moment. Sir
  Giles himself was scarcely so malignant and implacable.</p>

  <p>A strong contrast to this dastardly debauchee was offered by the bolder
  villain. Sir Giles Mompesson was a very handsome man, with a striking
  physiognomy, but dark and sinister in expression. His eyes were black,
  singularly piercing, and flashed with the fiercest fire when kindled by
  passion. A finely-formed aquiline nose gave a hawk-like character to his
  face; his hair was coal-black (though he was no longer young), and hung in
  long ringlets over his neck and shoulders. He wore the handsomely cut beard
  and moustache subsequently depicted in the portraits of Vandyke, which suited
  the stern gravity of his countenance. Rich, though sober in his attire, he
  always affected a dark colour, being generally habited in a doublet of black
  quilted silk, Venetian hose, and a murrey-coloured velvet mantle. His conical
  hat was ornamented with a single black ostrich feather; and he carried a long
  rapier by his side, in the use of which he was singularly skilful; being one
  of Vincentio Saviolo's best pupils. Sir Giles was a little above the middle
  height, with a well proportioned athletic figure; and his strength and
  address were such, that there seemed good reason for his boast when he
  declared, as he often did, "that he feared no man living, in fair fight, no,
  nor any two men."</p>

  <p>Sir Giles had none of the weaknesses of his partner. Temperate in his
  living, he had never been known to commit an excess at table; nor were the
  blandishments or lures of the fair sex ever successfully spread for him. If
  his arm was of iron, his heart seemed of adamant, utterly impenetrable by any
  gentle emotion. It was affirmed, and believed, that he had never shed a tear.
  His sole passion appeared to be the accumulation of wealth; unattended by the
  desire to spend it. He bestowed no gifts. He had no family, no kinsmen, whom
  he cared to acknowledge. He stood alone&mdash;a hard, grasping man: a
  bond-slave of Mammon.</p>

  <p>When it pleased him, Sir Giles Mompesson could play the courtier, and fawn
  and gloze like the rest. A consummate hypocrite, he easily assumed any part
  he might be called upon to enact; but the tone natural to him was one of
  insolent domination and bitter raillery. He sneered at all things human and
  divine; and there was mockery in his laughter, as well as venom in his jests.
  His manner, however, was not without a certain cold and grave dignity; and he
  clothed himself, like his purposes, in inscrutable reserve, on occasions
  requiring it. So ominous was his presence, that many persons got out of his
  way, fearing to come in contact with him, or give him offence; and the broad
  walk at Paul's was sometimes cleared as he took his way along it, followed by
  his band of tipstaves.</p>

  <p>If this were the case with persons who had no immediate ground of
  apprehension from him, how much terror his sombre figure must have inspired,
  when presented, as it was, to Madame Bonaventure, with the aspect of a
  merciless creditor, armed with full power to enforce his claims, and resolved
  not to abate a jot of them, will be revealed to the reader in our next
  chapter.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-3"
     name="ch1-3">CHAPTER III.<br>
  The French Ordinary.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The month allowed by the notice expired, and Madame
  Bonaventure's day of reckoning arrived.</p>

  <p>No arrangement had been attempted in the interim, though abundant
  opportunities of doing so were afforded her, as Sir Francis Mitchell visited
  the Three Cranes almost daily. She appeared to treat the matter very lightly,
  always putting it off when mentioned; and even towards the last seemed quite
  unconcerned, as if entertaining no fear of the result. Apparently, everything
  went on just as usual, and no one would have supposed, from Madame
  Bonaventure's manner, that she was aware of the possibility of a mine being
  sprung beneath her feet. Perhaps she fancied she had countermined her
  opponents, and so felt secure. Her indifference puzzled Sir Francis, who knew
  not whether to attribute it to insensibility or over-confidence. He was
  curious to see how she would conduct herself when the crisis came; and for
  that purpose repaired to the tavern, about dinner-time, on the appointed
  day.</p>

  <p>The hostess received him very graciously; trifled and jested with him as
  was her custom, and looked all blandishments and smiles to him and everybody
  else, as if nothing could possibly happen to disturb her serenity. Sir
  Francis was more perplexed than ever. With the levity and heedlessness of a
  Frenchwoman, she must have forgotten all about the claim. What if he should
  venture to remind her of it? Better not. The application would come soon
  enough. He was glad it devolved upon his partner, and not on himself, to
  proceed to extremities with so charming a person. He really could not do it.
  And yet all the while he chuckled internally as he thought of the terrible
  dilemma in which she would be speedily caught, and how completely it would
  place her at his mercy. She must come to terms then. And Sir Francis rubbed
  his skinny hands gleefully at the thought. On her part, Madame Bonaventure
  guessed what was passing in his breast, and secretly enjoyed the idea of
  checkmating him. With a captivating smile she left him to attend to her
  numerous guests.</p>

  <p>And very numerous they were on that day. More so than usual. Sir Francis,
  who had brought a boat from Westminster, where he dwelt, experienced some
  difficulty in landing at the stairs, invested as they were with barges,
  wherries and watermen, all of whom had evidently brought customers to the
  Three Cranes. Besides these, there were two or three gilded pinnaces lying
  off the wharf, with oarsmen in rich liveries, evidently belonging to persons
  of rank.</p>

  <p>The benches and little tables in front of the tavern were occupied by
  foreign merchants and traders, discussing their affairs over a stoop of
  Bordeaux. Others, similarly employed, sat at the open casements in the rooms
  above; each story projecting so much beyond the other that the old building,
  crowned with its fanciful gables and heavy chimnies, looked top-heavy, and as
  if it would roll over into the Thames some day. Others, again, were seated
  over their wine in the pleasant little chamber built over the porch, which,
  advancing considerably beyond the door, afforded a delightful prospect, from
  its lantern-like windows, of the river, now sparkling with sunshine (it was a
  bright May day), and covered with craft, extending on the one hand to
  Baynard's Castle, and on the other to the most picturesque object to be found
  then, or since, in London&mdash;the ancient Bridge, with its towers,
  gateways, lofty superstructures, and narrow arches through which the current
  dashed swiftly; and, of course, commanding a complete view of the opposite
  bank, beginning with Saint Saviour's fine old church, Winchester House, the
  walks, gardens, and play-houses, and ending with the fine groves of timber
  skirting Lambeth Marshes. Others repaired to the smooth and well-kept bowling
  alley in the narrow court at the back of the house, where there was a
  mulberry tree two centuries older than the tavern itself&mdash;to recreate
  themselves with the healthful pastime there afforded, and indulge at the same
  time in a few whiffs of tobacco, which, notwithstanding the king's
  fulminations against it, had already made its way among the people.</p>

  <p>The ordinary was held in the principal room in the house; which was well
  enough adapted for the purpose, being lofty and spacious, and lighted by an
  oriel window at the upper end. Over the high carved chimney-piece were the
  arms of the Vintners' Company, with a Bacchus for the crest. The ceiling was
  moulded, and the wainscots of oak; against the latter several paintings were
  hung. One of these represented the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, and another
  the triumphal entry of Henri IV. into rebellious Paris. Besides these, there
  were portraits of the reigning monarch, James the First; the Marquis of
  Buckingham, his favourite; and the youthful Louis XIII., king of France. A
  long table generally ran down the centre of the room; but on this occasion
  there was a raised cross-table at the upper end, with a traverse, or curtain,
  partially drawn before it, proclaiming the presence of important guests. Here
  the napery was finer, and the drinking-vessels handsomer, than those used at
  the lower board. A grand banquet seemed taking place. Long-necked flasks were
  placed in coolers, and the buffets were covered with flagons and glasses. The
  table groaned beneath the number and variety of dishes set upon it. In
  addition to the customary yeomen-waiters, there were a host of serving-men in
  rich and varied liveries, but these attended exclusively on their lords at
  the raised table, behind the traverse.</p>

  <p>As Sir Francis was ushered into the eating-room, he was quite taken aback
  by the unusually magnificent display, and felt greatly surprised that no hint
  of the banquet had been given him, on his arrival, by the hostess. The feast
  had already commenced; and all the yeomen-waiters and trencher-scrapers were
  too busily occupied to attend to him. Cyprien, who marshalled the dishes at
  the lower table, did not deign to notice him, and was deaf to his demand for
  a place. It seemed probable he would not obtain one at all; and he was about
  to retire, much disconcerted, when a young man somewhat plainly habited, and
  who seemed a stranger to all present, very good-naturedly made room for him.
  In this way he was squeezed in.</p>

  <p>Sir Francis then cast a look round to ascertain who were present; but he
  was so inconveniently situated, and the crowd of serving-men was so great at
  the upper table, that he could only imperfectly distinguish those seated at
  it; besides which, most of the guests were hidden by the traverse. Such,
  however, as he could make out were richly attired in doublets of silk and
  satin, while their rich velvet mantles, plumed and jewelled caps, and long
  rapiers, were carried by their servants.</p>

  <p>Two or three turned round to look at him as he sat down; and amongst these
  he remarked Sir Edward Villiers, whose presence was far from agreeable to
  him,&mdash;for though Sir Edward was secretly connected with him and Sir
  Giles, and took tithe of their spoliations, he disowned them in public, and
  would assuredly not countenance any open display of their rapacious
  proceedings.</p>

  <p>Another personage whom he recognised, from his obesity, the peculiarity of
  his long flowing periwig, and his black velvet Parisian pourpoint, which
  contrasted forcibly with the glittering habiliments of his companions, was
  Doctor Mayerne-Turquet, the celebrated French professor of medicine, then so
  high in favour with James, that, having been loaded with honours and
  dignities, he had been recently named the King's first physician. Doctor
  Mayerne's abilities were so distinguished, that his Protestant faith alone,
  prevented him from occupying the same eminent position in the court of France
  that he did in that of England. The doctor's presence at the banquet was
  unpropitious; it was natural he should befriend a countrywoman and a Huguenot
  like himself, and, possessing the royal ear, he might make such
  representations as he pleased to the King of what should occur. Sir Francis
  hoped he would be gone before Sir Giles appeared.</p>

  <p>But there was yet a third person, who gave the usurious knight more
  uneasiness than the other two. This was a handsome young man, with fair hair
  and delicate features, whose slight elegant figure was arrayed in a
  crimson-satin doublet, slashed with white, and hose of the same colours and
  fabric. The young nobleman in question, whose handsome features and
  prematurely-wasted frame bore the impress of cynicism and debauchery, was
  Lord Roos, then recently entrapped into marriage with the daughter of Sir
  Thomas Lake, Secretary of State: a marriage productive of the usual
  consequences of such imprudent arrangements&mdash;neglect on the one side,
  unhappiness on the other. Lord Roos was Sir Francis's sworn enemy. Like many
  other such gay moths, he had been severely singed by fluttering into the
  dazzling lights held up to him, when he wanted money, by the two usurers; and
  he had often vowed revenge against them for the manner in which they had
  fleeced him. Sir Francis did not usually give any great heed to his threats,
  being too much accustomed to reproaches and menaces from his victims to feel
  alarm or compunction; but just now the case was different, and he could not
  help fearing the vindictive young lord might seize the opportunity of serving
  him an ill turn,&mdash;if, indeed, he had not come there expressly for the
  purpose, which seemed probable, from the fierce and disdainful glances he
  cast at him.</p>

  <p>An angry murmur pervaded the upper table on Sir Francis's appearance; and
  something was said which, though he could not gather its precise import did
  not sound agreeably to his ears. He felt he had unwittingly brought his head
  near a hornet's nest, and might esteem himself lucky if he escaped without
  stinging. However, there was no retreating now; for though his fear
  counselled flight, very shame restrained him.</p>

  <p>The repast was varied and abundant, consisting of all kinds of fricassees,
  collops and rashers, boiled salmon from the Thames, trout and pike from the
  same river, boiled pea-chickens, and turkey-poults, and florentines of puff
  paste, calves-foot pies, and set custards. Between each guest a boiled salad
  was placed, which was nothing more than what we should term a dish of
  vegetables, except that the vegetables were somewhat differently prepared;
  cinnamon, ginger, and sugar being added to the pulped carrots, besides a
  handful of currants, vinegar, and butter. A similar plan was adopted with the
  salads of burrage, chicory, marigold leaves, bugloss, asparagus, rocket, and
  alexanders, and many other plants discontinued in modern cookery, but then
  much esteemed; oil and vinegar being used with some, and spices with all;
  while each dish was garnished with slices of hard-boiled eggs. A jowl of
  sturgeon was carried to the upper table, where there was also a baked swan,
  and a roasted bustard, flanked by two stately venison pasties. This was only
  the first service; and two others followed, consisting of a fawn, with a
  pudding inside it, a grand salad, hot olive pies, baked neats' tongues, fried
  calves' tongues, baked Italian puddings, a farced leg of lamb in the French
  fashion, orangeado pie, buttered crabs, anchovies, and a plentiful supply of
  little made dishes, and <i>quelquechoses</i>, scattered over the table. With
  such a profusion of good things, it may appear surprising that Sir Francis
  should find very little to eat; but the attendants all seemed in league
  against him, and whenever he set his eye upon a dish, it was sure to be
  placed out of reach. Sir Francis was a great epicure, and the Thames salmon
  looked delicious; but he would have failed in obtaining a slice of it, if his
  neighbour (the young man who had made room for him) had not given him the
  well-filled trencher intended for himself. In the same way he secured the
  wing of a boiled capon, larded with preserved lemons, the sauce of which was
  exquisite, as he well knew, from experience. Cyprien, however, took care he
  should get none of the turkey poults, or the florentines, but whipped off
  both dishes from under his very nose; and a like fate would have attended a
  lumbar pie but for the interference of his good-natured neighbour, who again
  came to his aid, and rescued it from the clutches of the saucy Gascon, just
  as it was being borne away.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-4"
     name="ch1-4">CHAPTER IV.<br>
  A Star-Chamber Victim.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">His hunger being somewhat stayed, Sir Francis now found
  leisure to consider the young man who had so greatly befriended him, and, as
  a means of promoting conversation between them, began by filling his glass
  from a flask of excellent Bordeaux, of which, in spite of Cyprien's efforts
  to prevent him, he had contrived to gain possession. The young man
  acknowledged his courtesy with a smile, praised the wine, and expressed his
  astonishment at the wonderful variety and excellence of the repast, for which
  he said he was quite unprepared. It was not Sir Francis's way to feel or
  express much interest in strangers, and he disliked young men, especially
  when they were handsome, as was the case with his new acquaintance; but there
  was something in the youth that riveted his attention.</p>

  <p>From the plainness of his attire, and a certain not unpleasing rusticity
  of air, Sir Francis comprehended at once that he was fresh from the country;
  but he also felt satisfied, from his bearing and deportment, that he was a
  gentleman: a term not quite so vaguely applied then, as it is now-a-days. The
  youth had a fine frank countenance, remarkable for manly beauty and
  intelligence, and a figure perfectly proportioned and athletic. Sir Francis
  set him down as well skilled in all exercises; vaulting, leaping, riding, and
  tossing the pike; nor was he mistaken. He also concluded him to be fond of
  country sports; and he was right in the supposition. He further imagined the
  young man had come to town to better his fortune, and seek a place at Court;
  and he was not far wrong in the notion. As the wily knight scanned the
  handsome features of his companion, his clean-made limbs, and symmetrical
  figure, he thought that success must infallibly attend the production of such
  a fair youth at a Court where personal advantages were the first
  consideration.</p>

  <p>"A likely gallant," he reflected, "to take the fancy of the king; and if I
  aid him with means to purchase rich attire, and procure him a presentation,
  he may not prove ungrateful. But of that I shall take good security. I know
  what gratitude is. He must be introduced to my Lady Suffolk. She will know
  how to treat him. In the first place, he must cast his country slough. That
  ill-made doublet of green cloth must be exchanged for one of velvet slashed
  in the Venetian style like mine own, with hose stuffed and bombasted
  according to the mode. A silk stocking will bring out the nice proportions of
  his leg; though, as I am a true gentleman, the youth has so well formed a
  limb that even his own villainous yarn coverings cannot disfigure it. His
  hair is of a good brown colour, which the king affects much, and seems to
  curl naturally; but it wants trimming to the mode, for he is rough as a young
  colt fresh from pasture; and though he hath not much beard on his chin or
  upper lip, yet what he hath becomes him well, and will become him better,
  when properly clipped and twisted. Altogether he is as goodly a youth as one
  would desire to see. What if he should supplant Buckingham, as Buckingham
  supplanted Somerset? Let the proud Marquis look to himself! We may work his
  overthrow yet. And now to question him."</p>

  <p>After replenishing his glass, Sir Francis addressed himself in his
  blandest accents, and with his most insidious manner, to his youthful
  neighbour:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"For a stranger to town, as I conclude you to be, young Sir," he said,
  "you have made rather a lucky hit in coming hither to-day, since you have not
  only got a better dinner than I (a constant frequenter of this French
  ordinary) ever saw served here&mdash;(though the attendance is abominable, as
  you must have remarked&mdash;that rascally Cyprien deserves the bastinado,);
  but your civility and good manners have introduced you to one, who may,
  without presumption, affirm that he hath the will, and, it may be, the
  ability to serve you; if you will only point out to him the way."</p>

  <p>"Nay, worthy Sir, you are too kind," the young man modestly replied; "I
  have done nothing to merit your good opinion, though I am happy to have
  gained it. I rejoice that accident has so far befriended me as to bring me
  here on this festive occasion; and I rejoice yet more that it has brought me
  acquainted with a worthy gentleman like yourself, to whom my rustic manners
  prove not to be displeasing. I have too few friends to neglect any that
  chance may offer; and as I must carve my own way in the world, and fight for
  a position in it, I gladly accept any hand that may be stretched out to help
  me in the struggle."</p>

  <p>"Just as I would have it," Sir Francis thought, "The very man I took him
  for. As I am a true gentleman, mine shall not be wanting, my good youth," he
  added aloud, with apparent cordiality, and affecting to regard the other with
  great interest; "and when I learn the particular direction in which you
  intend to shape your course, I shall be the better able to advise and guide
  you. There are many ways to fortune."</p>

  <p>"Mine should be the shortest if I had any choice," the young man rejoined
  with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Right, quite right," the crafty knight returned. "All men would take that
  road if they could find it. But with some the shortest road would not be the
  safest. In your case I think it might be different. You have a sufficiently
  good mien, and a sufficiently good figure, to serve you in lieu of other
  advantages."</p>

  <p>"Your fair speech would put me in conceit with myself, worthy Sir," the
  young man rejoined with a well-pleased air; "were I not too conscious of my
  own demerits, not to impute what you say of me to good nature, or to
  flattery."</p>

  <p>"There you wrong me, my good young friend&mdash;on my credit, you do. Were
  I to resort to adulation, I must strain the points of compliment to find
  phrases that should come up to my opinion of your good looks; and as to my
  friendly disposition towards you, I have already said that your attentions
  have won it, so that mere good nature does not prompt my words. I speak of
  you, as I think. May I, without appearing too inquisitive, ask from what part
  of the country you come?"</p>

  <p>"I am from Norfolk, worthy Sir," the young man answered, "where my life
  has been spent among a set of men wild and uncouth, and fond of the chase as
  the Sherwood archers we read of in the ballads. I am the son of a broken
  gentleman; the lord of a ruined house; with one old servant left me out of
  fifty kept by my father, and with scarce a hundred acres that I can still
  call my own, out of the thousands swept away from me. Still I hunt in my
  father's woods; kill my father's deer; and fish in my father's lakes; since
  no one molests me. And I keep up the little church near the old tumble-down
  hall, in which are the tombs of my ancestors, and where my father lies
  buried; and the tenantry come there yet on Sundays, though I am no longer
  their master; and my father's old chaplain, Sir Oliver, still preaches there,
  though my father's son can no longer maintain him."</p>

  <p>"A sad change, truly," Sir Francis said, in a tone of sympathy, and with a
  look of well-feigned concern; "and attributable, I much fear, to riot and
  profusion on the part of your father, who so beggared his son."</p>

  <p>"Not so, Sir," the young man gravely replied; "my father was a most
  honourable man, and would have injured no one, much less the son on whom he
  doated. Neither was he profuse; but lived bountifully and well, as a country
  gentleman, with a large estate, should live. The cause of his ruin was that
  he came within the clutches of that devouring monster, which, like the
  insatiate dragon of Rhodes, has swallowed up the substance of so many
  families, that our land is threatened with desolation. My father was ruined
  by that court, which, with a mockery of justice, robs men of their name,
  their fame, their lands, and goods; which perverts the course of law, and
  saps the principles of equity; which favours the knave, and oppresses the
  honest man; which promotes and supports extortion and plunder; which reverses
  righteous judgments, and asserts its own unrighteous supremacy, which, by
  means of its commissioners, spreads its hundred arms over the whole realm, to
  pillage and destroy&mdash;so that no one, however distant, can keep out of
  its reach, or escape its supervision; and which, if it be not uprooted, will,
  in the end, overthrow the kingdom. Need I say my father was ruined by the
  Star-Chamber?"</p>

  <p>"Hush! hush! my good young Sir," Sir Francis cried, having vainly
  endeavoured to interrupt his companion's angry denunciation. "Pray heaven
  your words have reached no other ears than mine! To speak of the Star-Chamber
  as you have spoken is worse than treason. Many a man has lost his ears, and
  been branded on the brow, for half you have uttered."</p>

  <p>"Is free speech denied in this free country?" the young man cried in
  astonishment. "Must one suffer grievous wrong, and not complain?"</p>

  <p>"Certes, you must not contemn the Star-Chamber, or you will incur its
  censure," Sir Francis replied in a low tone. "No court in England is so
  jealous of its prerogatives, nor so severe in punishment of its maligners. It
  will not have its proceedings canvassed, or its judgments questioned."</p>

  <p>"For the plain reason, that it knows they will not bear investigation or
  discussion. Such is the practice of all arbitrary and despotic rule. But will
  Englishmen submit to such tyranny?"</p>

  <p>"Again, let me counsel you to put a bridle on your tongue, young Sir. Such
  matters are not to be talked of at public tables&mdash;scarcely in private.
  It is well you have addressed yourself to one who will not betray you. The
  Star-Chamber hath its spies everywhere. Meddle not with it, as you value
  liberty. Light provocation arouses its anger; and once aroused, its wrath is
  all-consuming."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-5"
     name="ch1-5">CHAPTER V.<br>
  Jocelyn Mounchensey.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Notwithstanding the risk incurred, the young man, whose
  feelings were evidently deeply interested, seemed disposed to pursue the
  dangerous theme; but perceiving one of their opposite neighbours glancing at
  them, Sir Francis checked him; and filling his glass essayed to change the
  conversation, by inquiring how long he had been in town, and where he
  lodged?</p>

  <p>"I only arrived in London yesterday," was the reply; "yet I have been here
  long enough to make me loth to return to the woods and moors of Norfolk. As
  to my lodging, it is without the city walls, near St. Botolph's Church, and
  within a bow shot of Aldgate: a pleasant situation enough, looking towards
  the Spital Fields and the open country. I would fain have got me others in
  the Strand, or near Charing Cross, if my scanty means would have allowed me.
  Chance, as I have said, brought me here to-day. Strolling forth early to view
  the sights of town, I crossed London Bridge, the magnificence of which amazed
  me; and, proceeding along the Bankside, entered Paris Garden, of which I had
  heard much, and where I was greatly pleased, both with the mastiffs kept
  there, and the formidable animals they have to encounter; and, methought, I
  should like to bait mine enemies with those savage dogs, instead of the bear.
  Returning to the opposite shore in a wherry, the waterman landed me at this
  wharf, and so highly commended the Three Cranes, as affording the best French
  ordinary and the best French wine in London, that seeing many gentlefolk
  flocking towards it, which seemed to confirm his statement, I came in with
  them, and have reason to be satisfied with my entertainment, never having
  dined so sumptuously before, and, certes, never having tasted wine so
  delicious."</p>

  <p>"Let me fill your glass again. As I am a true gentleman, it will not hurt
  you; a singular merit of pure Bordeaux being that you may drink it with
  impunity; and the like cannot be said of your sophisticated sack. We will
  crush another flask. Ho! drawer&mdash;Cyprien, I say! More wine&mdash;and of
  the best Bordeaux. The best, I say."</p>

  <p>And for a wonder the order was obeyed, and the flask set before him.</p>

  <p>"You have been at the Bankside you say, young Sir? On my credit, you must
  cross the river again and visit the theatres&mdash;the Globe or the Rose. Our
  great actor, Dick Burbadge, plays Othello to-day, and, I warrant me, he will
  delight you. A little man is Dick, but he hath a mighty soul. There is none
  other like him, whether it be Nat Field or Ned Alleyn. Our famous Shakespeare
  is fortunate, I trow, in having him to play his great characters. You must
  see Burbadge, likewise, in the mad Prince of Denmark,&mdash;the part was
  written for him, and fits him exactly. See him also in gentle and love-sick
  Romeo, in tyrannous and murderous Macbeth, and in crookback Richard; in all
  of which, though different, our Dick is equally good. He hath some other
  parts of almost equal merit,&mdash;as Malevole, in the 'Malcontent;'
  Frankford, in the 'Woman Killed with Kindness;' Brachiano, in Webster's
  'White Devil;' and Vendice, in Cyril Tournour's 'Revenger's Tragedy.'"</p>

  <p>"I know not what may be the nature of that last-named play," the young man
  rather sternly remarked; "but if the character of Vendice at all bears out
  its name, it would suit me. I am an avenger."</p>

  <p>"Forbear your wrongs awhile, I pray you, and drown your resentment in a
  cup of wine. As I am a true gentleman! a better bottle than the first! Nay,
  taste it. On my credit, it is perfect nectar. I pledge you in a brimmer;
  wishing Success may attend you, and Confusion await your Enemies! May you
  speedily regain your Rights!"</p>

  <p>"I drink that toast most heartily, worthy Sir," the young man exclaimed,
  raising his beaded flagon on high. "Confusion to my Enemies&mdash;Restoration
  to my Rights!"</p>

  <p>And he drained the goblet to its last drop.</p>

  <p>"By this time he must be in a fit mood for my purpose," Sir Francis
  thought, as he watched him narrowly. "Harkye, my good young friend," he said,
  lowering his tone, "I would not be overheard in what I have to say. You were
  speaking just now of the shortest way to fortune. I will point it out to you.
  To him, who is bold enough to take it, and who hath the requisites for the
  venture, the shortest way is to be found at Court. Where think you most of
  those gallants, of whom you may catch a glimpse through the traverse, derive
  their revenues?&mdash;As I am a true gentleman!&mdash;from the royal coffers.
  Not many years ago, with all of them; not many months ago, with some; those
  brilliant and titled coxcombs were adventurers like yourself, having barely a
  Jacobus in their purses, and scarce credit for board and lodging with their
  respective landladies. Now you see how nobly they feast, and how richly they
  bedeck themselves. On my credit! the like good fortune may attend you; and
  haply, when I dine at an ordinary a year hence, I may perceive you at the
  upper table, with a curtain before you to keep off the meaner company, and
  your serving-man at your back, holding your velvet mantle and cap, like the
  best of your fellow nobles."</p>

  <p>"Heaven grant it may be so!" the young man exclaimed, with a sigh. "You
  hold a dazzling picture before me; but I have little expectation of realizing
  it."</p>

  <p>"It will be your own fault if you do not," the tempter rejoined. "You are
  equally well-favoured with the handsomest of them; and it was by good looks
  alone that the whole party rose to their present eminence. Why not pursue the
  same course; with the same certainty of success? You have courage enough to
  undertake it, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"If courage alone were wanting, I have that," the young man
  replied;&mdash;"but I am wholly unknown in town. How then shall I accomplish
  an introduction at Court, when I know not even its humblest attendant?"</p>

  <p>"I have already said you were lucky in meeting with me," Sir Francis
  replied; "and I find you were luckier than I supposed, when I told you so;
  for I knew not then towards what bent your desires tended, nor in what way I
  could help you; but now, finding out the boldness of your flight, and the
  high game you aim at, I am able to offer you effectual assistance, and give
  you an earnest of a prosperous issue. Through my means you shall be presented
  to the king, and in such sort that the presentation shall not be idly made.
  It will rest then with yourself to play your cards dexterously, and to follow
  up a winning game. Doubtless, you will have many adversaries, who will trip
  up your heels if they can, and throw every obstacle in your way; but if you
  possess the strong arm I fancy you do, and daring to second it, you have
  nothing to fear. As I am a true gentleman! you shall have good counsel, and a
  friend in secret to back you."</p>

  <p>"To whom am I indebted for this most gracious and unlooked-for offer?" the
  young man asked, his breast heaving, and his eye flashing with
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"To one you may perchance have heard of," the knight answered, "as the
  subject of some misrepresentation; how justly applied, you yourself will be
  able to determine from my present conduct. I am Sir Francis Mitchell."</p>

  <p>At the mention of this name the young man started, and a deep angry flush
  overspread his face and brow.</p>

  <p>Perceiving the effect produced, the wily knight hastened to remove it.</p>

  <p>"My name, I see, awakens unpleasant associations in your breast," he said;
  "and your look shows you have been influenced by the calumnies of my enemies.
  I do not blame you. Men can only be judged of by report; and those I have had
  dealings with have reported ill enough of me. But they have spoken falsely. I
  have done no more than any other person would do. I have obtained the best
  interest I could for my money; and my losses have been almost equal to my
  gains. Folks are ready enough to tell all they can against you; but slow to
  mention aught they conceive to be in your favour. They stigmatize me as a
  usurer; but they forget to add, I am ever the friend of those in need. They
  use me, and abuse me. That is the way of the world. Wherefore, then, should I
  complain? I am no worse off than my neighbours. And the proof that I can be
  disinterested is the way in which I have acted towards you, a perfect
  stranger, and who have no other recommendation to my good offices than your
  gracious mien and gentle manners."</p>

  <p>"I cannot accept your proffered aid, Sir Francis," the young man replied,
  in an altered tone, and with great sternness. "And you will understand why I
  cannot, when I announce myself to you as Jocelyn Mounchensey."</p>

  <p>It was now the knight's turn to start, change colour, and tremble.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-6"
     name="ch1-6">CHAPTER VI.<br>
  Provocation.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A momentary pause ensued, during which Mounchensey regarded
  the knight so fiercely, that the latter began to entertain apprehensions for
  his personal safety, and meditated a precipitate retreat. Yet he did not dare
  to move, lest the action should bring upon him the hurt he wished to avoid.
  Thus he remained, like a bird fascinated by the rattlesnake, until the young
  man, whose power of speech seemed taken from him by passion, went on, in a
  tone of deep and concentrated rage, that communicated a hissing sound to his
  words.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am Jocelyn Mounchensey," he said, "the son of him whom your arts
  and those of your partner in iniquity, Sir Giles Mompesson, brought to
  destruction; the son of him whom you despoiled of a good name and large
  estates, and cast into a loathsome prison, to languish and to die: I am the
  son of that murdered man. I am he whom you have robbed of his inheritance;
  whose proud escutcheon you have tarnished; whose family you have reduced to
  beggary and utter ruin."</p>

  <p>"But Sir Jocelyn, my worthy friend," the knight faltered, "have patience,
  I pray of you. If you consider yourself aggrieved, I am willing to make
  reparation&mdash;ample reparation. You know what were my intentions towards
  you, before I had the slightest notion who you might be. (If I had but been
  aware of it, he thought, I would have taken care to keep at a respectful
  distance from him.) I will do more than I promised. I will lend you any sums
  of money you may require; and on your personal security. Your bare word shall
  suffice. No bonds&mdash;no written obligations of any kind. Does that sound
  like usury? As I am a true gentleman! I am most unfairly judged. I am not the
  extortioner men describe me. You shall find me your friend," he added in a
  low earnest tone. "I will re-establish your fortune; give you a new title,
  higher and prouder than that which you have lost; and, if you will follow my
  counsel, you shall supplant the haughty favourite himself. You shall stand
  where Buckingham now stands. Hear reason, good Sir Jocelyn. Hear reason, I
  entreat you."</p>

  <p>"I will hear nothing further," Jocelyn rejoined. "Were you to talk till
  Doomsday, you could not alter my feelings towards you a jot. My chief errand
  in coming to London was to call you and Sir Giles Mompesson to strict
  account."</p>

  <p>"And we will answer any charges you may bring against us
  readily&mdash;most readily, Sir Jocelyn. All was done in
  fairness&mdash;according to law. The Star-Chamber will uphold us."</p>

  <p>"Tut! you think to terrify me with that bugbear; but I am not so easily
  frightened. We have met for the first time by chance, but our next meeting
  shall be by appointment."</p>

  <p>"When and where you please, Sir Jocelyn," the knight replied; but
  recollect the duello is forbidden, and, though I would not willingly
  disappoint you in your desire to cut my throat, I should be sorry to think
  you might be hanged for it afterwards. Come, Sir Jocelyn, lay aside this idle
  passion, and look to your true interests, which lie not in quarrelling with
  me, but in our reconciliation. I can help you effectually, as I have shown;
  and, as I am a true gentleman, I <i>will</i>help you. Give me your hand, and
  let us be friends!"</p>

  <p>"Never!" Jocelyn exclaimed, withdrawing from him, "never shall the hand of
  a Mounchensey grasp yours in friendship! I would sooner mine rotted off! I am
  your mortal foe. My father's death has to be avenged."</p>

  <p>"Provoke him not, my good young Sir," interposed an elderly man, next him,
  in a long furred gown, with hanging sleeves, and a flat cap on his head, who
  had heard what was now passing. "You know not the mischief he may do
  you."</p>

  <p>"I laugh at his malice, and defy him," Jocelyn cried&mdash;"he shall not
  sit one moment longer beside me. Out, knave! out!" he added, seizing Sir
  Francis by the wing of his doublet, and forcibly thrusting him from his seat.
  "You are not fit company for honest men. Ho! varlets, to the door with him!
  Throw him into the kennel."</p>

  <p>"You shall rue this, villain!&mdash;you shall rue it bitterly," Sir
  Francis cried, shaking his clenched hands at him. "Your father perished like
  a dog in the Fleet, and you shall perish there likewise. You have put
  yourself wholly in my power, and I will make a fearful example of you. You
  have dared to utter scandalous and contemptuous language against the great
  and high court of Star-Chamber, before the decrees of which, all men bow;
  impugning its justice and denying its authority; and you shall feel the full
  weight of its displeasure. I call upon these worthy gentlemen to testify
  against you."</p>

  <p>"We have heard nothing, and can testify nothing," several voices
  cried.</p>

  <p>"But you, Sir, who were next him, you must have heard him?" Sir Francis
  said, addressing the elderly man in the furred gown.</p>

  <p>"Not I!" rejoined the person appealed to; "I gave no heed to what was
  said."</p>

  <p>"But I did, Sir Francis," squeaked a little whey-faced man, in a large
  ruff and tight-laced yellow doublet, from the opposite side of the table; "I
  heard him most audaciously vilipend the high court of Star-Chamber and its
  councils; and I will bear testimony against him when called upon."</p>

  <p>"Your name, good Sir, your name?" Sir Francis demanded, taking out his
  tablets.</p>

  <p>"Set me down as Thopas Trednock, tailor, at the sign of the Pressing Iron,
  in Cornhill," the whey-faced man replied, in his shrill tones, amid the
  derisive laughter of the assemblage.</p>

  <p>"Thopas Trednock, tailor&mdash;good!" the knight repeated, as he wrote the
  name down. "You will be an excellent witness, Master Trednock. Fare you well
  for the present, <i>Master</i> Jocelyn Mounchensey, for I now mind well your
  father was degraded from the honour of knighthood. As I am a true gentleman!
  you may be sure of committal to the Fleet."</p>

  <p>As may be supposed, the scuffle which had taken place, attracted the
  attention of those in its immediate vicinity; and when the cause of it became
  known, as it presently did throughout both tables, great indignation was
  expressed against Sir Francis, who was censured on all hands, jeered and
  flouted, as he moved to the door. So great was the clamour, and so
  opprobrious were the epithets and terms applied to him, that the knight was
  eager to make his escape; but he met Cyprien in his way; and the droll young
  Gascon, holding a dish-cover in one hand, by way of buckler, and a long
  carving-knife in the other, in place of a sword, opposed his egress.</p>

  <p>"Let me pass, knave," Sir Francis cried in alarm.</p>

  <p>"By your leave, no," returned Cyprien, encouraged by the laughter and
  plaudits of the company. "You have come hither uninvited, and must stay till
  you have permission to depart. Having partaken of the banquet, you must,
  perforce, tarry for the rerebanquet. The sweets and cates have yet to come,
  Sir Francis."</p>

  <p>"What mean you, sirrah?" the knight demanded, in increased
  trepidation.</p>

  <p>"Your presence is necessary at a little entertainment I have provided to
  follow the dinner, sweet Sir Francis," Madame Bonaventure cried, advancing
  towards him; "and as you have a principal part in it, I can by no means spare
  you."</p>

  <p>"No one can spare you, sweet Sir Francis," several voices chimed in,
  derisively. "You must remain with us a little longer."</p>

  <p>"But I will not stay. I will not be detained. There is some conspiracy
  a-foot against me. I will indict you all for it, if you hinder me in going
  forth," the knight vociferated, in accents of mingled rage and terror. "Stop
  me at your peril, thou saucy Gascon knave."</p>

  <p>"<i>Cornes du diable</i>!&mdash;no more a knave than yourself, <i>gros
  usurier</i>!" Cyprien cried.</p>

  <p>"<i>Laissez-lui,</i> Cyprien," Madame Bonaventure interposed;&mdash;"the
  courteous knight will yield to my entreaties, and stay of his own free
  will."</p>

  <p>"I have business that calls me hence. I must go," Sir Francis said,
  endeavouring to push by them.</p>

  <p>"Let the door be closed," an authoritative voice cried from the head of
  the table.</p>

  <p>The order was instantly obeyed. Two serving-men stationed themselves
  before the place of exit, and Sir Francis found himself a prisoner.</p>

  <p>The roof rang with the laughter and gibes of the guests.</p>

  <p>"This is a frolic, gentleman, I perceive. You are resolved to make me your
  sport&mdash;ha! ha!" Sir Francis said, trying to disguise his uneasiness
  under an appearance of levity&mdash;"But you will not carry the jest too far.
  You will not maltreat me. My partner, Sir Giles Mompesson, will be here anon,
  and will requite any outrage committed upon me."</p>

  <p>"Sir Giles is impatiently expected by us," a spruce coxcomb near him
  replied. "Madame Bonaventure had prepared us for his coming. We will give him
  the welcome he deserves."</p>

  <p>"Ah! traitress! then it was all planned," Sir Francis thought;&mdash;"and,
  blind owl that I am, I have fallen into the snare."</p>

  <p>But the poor knight was nearly at his wit's end with fright, when he saw
  Lord Roos quit his place at the upper table and approach him.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-7"
     name="ch1-7">CHAPTER VII.<br>
  How Lord Roos obtained Sir Francis Mitchell's signature.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"What, my prince of usurers!" exclaimed Lord Roos, in a
  mocking tone; "my worthy money-lender, who never takes more than cent. per
  cent., and art ill content with less; who never exacts more than the penalty
  of thy bond,&mdash;unless more may be got; who never drives a hard bargain
  with a needy man&mdash;by thine own account; who never persecutes a
  debtor&mdash;as the prisons shall vouch for thee; who art just in all thy
  transactions&mdash;as every man who hath had dealings with thee will affirm;
  and who knows not how to lie, to cheat, to cozen&mdash;as some usurers
  do."</p>

  <p>"You are pleasant, my lord," Sir Francis replied.</p>

  <p>"I mean to be so," Lord Roos said; "for I esteem thee for thy rare
  qualities. I know not thy peer for cunning and knavery. Thy mischievous
  schemes are so well-conceived that they prove thee to have an absolute genius
  for villany. Scruples thou hast none; and considerations and feelings which
  might move men less obdurate than thyself, have no influence over thee. To
  ruin a man is with thee mere pastime; and groans of the oppressed are music
  in thine ears."</p>

  <p>"Aha! a good jest. You were always merry with me, my lord."</p>

  <p>"Yes, when I borrowed money from thee&mdash;but not when I had to repay it
  twice over. I laughed not then; but was foolish enough to threaten to take
  thy life. My anger is past now. But we must drink together&mdash;a rousing
  toast."</p>

  <p>"At your lordship's pleasure," Sir Francis replied.</p>

  <p>"Cyprien! a flask of wine, and thy largest goblet," Lord Roos cried. "'Tis
  well! Now pour the whole into the flagon. Do me reason in this cup, Sir
  Francis?"</p>

  <p>"What! in this mighty cup, my lord?" the knight replied. "Nay, 'tis too
  much, I swear. If I become drunken, the sin will lie at your door."</p>

  <p>"Off with it! without more ado. And let the toast be what thou
  practisest&mdash;'Pillage and Extortion!'"</p>

  <p>"I cannot drink that toast, my lord. 'Twill choke me."</p>

  <p>"'Sdeath! villain, but thou <i>shalt</i>, or thou shalt never taste wine
  more. Down with it, man! And now your signature to this paper?"</p>

  <p>"My signature!" Sir Francis cried, reeling from the effect of the wine he
  had swallowed. "Nay, my good lord; I can sign nothing that I have not read.
  What is it?"</p>

  <p>"A blank sheet," Lord Roos rejoined. "I will fill it up afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Then, my lord, I refuse&mdash;that is, I decline&mdash;that is, I had
  rather not, if your lordship pleases."</p>

  <p>"But my lordship pleases otherwise. Give him pen and ink, and set him near
  the table."</p>

  <p>This was done; and Sir Francis regarded the paper with swimming eyes.</p>

  <p>"Now, your name,&mdash;written near the bottom of the sheet," Lord Roos
  cried.</p>

  <p>"'Tis done under com&mdash;compulsion; and I pro&mdash;protest against
  it."</p>

  <p>"Sign, I say," the young nobleman exclaimed, rapping the table
  peremptorily.</p>

  <p>On this, Sir Francis wrote his name in the place indicated.</p>

  <p>"Enough!" Lord Roos cried, snatching up the paper. "This is all I want.
  Now set him on the table, that his partner may have him in full view when he
  arrives. 'Twill give him a foretaste of what he may himself expect."</p>

  <p>"What mean you, ruff&mdash;ruffians? 'Tis an indignity to which I shall
  not submit," cried Sir Francis, who was now, however, too far gone to offer
  any resistance.</p>

  <p>A leathern girdle was found, with which he was fastened to the chair, so
  as to prevent him slipping from it; and in this state he was hoisted upon the
  table, and set with his face to the door; looking the very picture of
  inebriety, with his head drooping on one side, his arms dangling uselessly
  down, and his thin legs stretched idly out. After making some incoherent
  objections to this treatment, he became altogether silent, and seemed to fall
  asleep. His elevation was received with shouts of laughter from the whole
  company.</p>

  <p>The incident had not taken place many minutes, and a round had scarcely
  been drunk by the guests, when a loud and peremptory summons was heard at the
  door. The noise roused even the poor drunkard in the chair, who, lifting up
  his head, stared about him with vacant eyes.</p>

  <p>"Let the door be opened," the same authoritative voice exclaimed, which
  had before ordered its closure.</p>

  <p>The mandate was obeyed; and, amidst profound silence, which suddenly
  succeeded the clashing of glasses, and expressions of hilarity, Sir Giles
  Mompesson entered, with his body-guard of myrmidons behind him.</p>

  <p>Habited in black, as was his custom, with a velvet mantle on his shoulder,
  and a long rapier by his side, he came forward with a measured step and
  assured demeanour. Though he must necessarily have been surprised by the
  assemblage he found&mdash;so much more numerous and splendid than he could
  have anticipated&mdash;he betrayed no signs whatever of embarrassment. Nor,
  though his quick eye instantly detected Sir Francis, and he guessed at once
  why the poor knight had been so scandalously treated, did he exhibit any
  signs of displeasure, or take the slightest notice of the circumstance;
  reserving this point for consideration, when his first business should be
  settled. An additional frown might have darkened his countenance; but it was
  so stern and sombre, without it, that no perceptible change could be
  discerned; unless it might be in the lightning glances he cast around, as if
  seeking some one he might call to account presently for the insult. But no
  one seemed willing to reply to the challenge. Though bold enough before he
  came, and boastful of what they would do, they all looked awed by his
  presence, and averted their gaze from him. There was, indeed, something so
  formidable in the man, that to shun a quarrel with him was more a matter of
  prudence than an act of cowardice; and on the present occasion, no one liked
  to be first to provoke him; trusting to his neighbour to commence the attack,
  or awaiting the general outbreak.</p>

  <p>There was one exception, however, and that was Jocelyn Mounchensey, who,
  so far from desiring to shun Sir Giles's searching regards, courted them; and
  as the knight's eagle eye ranged round the table and fell upon him, the young
  man (notwithstanding the efforts of his pacific neighbour in the furred cloak
  to restrain him) suddenly rose up, and throwing all the scorn and defiance he
  could muster into his countenance, returned Mompesson's glance with one
  equally fierce and menacing.</p>

  <p>A bitter smile curled Sir Giles's lip at this reply to his challenge, and
  he regarded the young man fixedly, as if to grave his features upon his
  memory. Perhaps they brought Mounchensey's father to mind, for Sir Giles
  withdrew his gaze for a moment to reflect, and then looked again at Jocelyn
  with fresh curiosity. If he had any doubts as to whom he beheld, they were
  removed by Sir Francis, who managed to hiccup forth&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Tis he, Sir Giles&mdash;'tis Jocelyn Mounchensey."</p>

  <p>"I thought as much," Sir Giles muttered. "A moment, young man," he cried,
  waving his hand imperiously to his antagonist. "Your turn will come
  presently."</p>

  <p>And without bestowing further notice on Jocelyn, who resisted all his
  neighbour's entreaties to him to sit down, Sir Giles advanced towards the
  middle chamber, where he paused, and took off his cap, having hitherto
  remained covered.</p>

  <p>In this position, he looked like a grand inquisitor attended by his
  familiars.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-8"
     name="ch1-8">CHAPTER VIII.<br>
  Of Lupo Vulp, Captain Bludder, Clement<br>
  Lanyere, and Sir Giles's other Myrmidons.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Close behind Sir Giles, and a little in advance of the rest
  of the myrmidons, stood Lupo Vulp, the scrivener.</p>

  <p>Lupo Vulp was the confidential adviser of our two extortioners, to whom
  they referred all their nefarious projects. He it was who prepared their
  bonds and contracts, and placed out their ill-gotten gains at exorbitant
  usance. Lupo Vulp was in all respects worthy of his employers, being just as
  wily and unscrupulous as they were, while, at the same time, he was rather
  better versed in legal tricks and stratagems, so that he could give them apt
  counsel in any emergency. A countenance more replete with cunning and knavery
  than that of Lupo Vulp, it would be difficult to discover. A sardonic smile
  hovered perpetually about his mouth, which was garnished with ranges of the
  keenest and whitest teeth. His features were sharp; his eyes small, set wide
  apart, of a light gray colour, and with all the slyness of a fox lurking
  within their furtive glances. Indeed, his general resemblance to that astute
  animal must have struck a physiognomist. His head was shaped like that of a
  fox, and his hair and beard were of a reddish-tawny hue. His manner was
  stealthy, cowering, suspicious, as if he feared a blow from every hand. Yet
  Lupo Vulp could show his teeth and snap on occasions. He was attired in a
  close-fitting doublet of russety-brown, round yellow hose, and long stockings
  of the same hue. A short brown mantle and a fox-skin cap completed his
  costume.</p>

  <p>The leader of the troop was Captain Bludder, a huge Alsatian bully, with
  fiercely-twisted moustachios, and fiery-red beard cut like a spade. He wore a
  steeple-crowned hat with a brooch in it, a buff jerkin and boots, and a sword
  and buckler dangled from his waist. Besides these, he had a couple of
  petronels stuck in his girdle. The captain drank like a fish, and swaggered
  and swore like twenty troopers.</p>

  <p>The rear of the band was formed by the tipstaves&mdash;stout fellows with
  hooks at the end of their poles, intended to capture a fugitive, or hale him
  along when caught. With these were some others armed with brown-bills. No
  uniformity prevailed in the accoutrements of the party, each man arraying
  himself as he listed. Some wore old leather jerkins and steel skirts; some,
  peascod doublets of Elizabeth's time, and trunk-hose that had covered many a
  limb besides their own; others, slops and galligaskins; while the poorer sort
  were robed in rusty gowns of tuft-mockado or taffeta, once guarded with
  velvet or lined with skins, but now tattered and threadbare. Their caps and
  bonnets were as varied as their apparel,&mdash;some being high-crowned, some
  trencher-shaped, and some few wide in the leaf and looped at the side.
  Moreover, there was every variety of villainous aspect; the savage scowl of
  the desperado, the cunning leer of the trickster, and the sordid look of the
  mean knave. Several of them betrayed, by the marks of infamy branded on their
  faces, or by the loss of ears, that they had passed through the hands of the
  public executioner.</p>

  <p>Amongst these there was one with a visage more frightfully mutilated than
  those of his comrades; the nose having been slit, and subsequently sewed
  together again, but so clumsily that the severed parts had only imperfectly
  united, communicating a strange, distorted, and forbidding look to the
  physiognomy. Clement Lanyere, the owner of this gashed and ghastly face, who
  was also reft of his ears, and branded on the cheek, had suffered infamy and
  degradation, owing to the licence he had given his tongue in respect to the
  Star-Chamber. Prosecuted in that court by Sir Giles Mompesson, as a notorious
  libeller and scandaller of the judges and first personages of the realm, he
  was found guilty, and sentenced accordingly. The court showed little leniency
  to such offenders; but it was a matter of grace that his clamorous tongue was
  not torn out likewise, in addition to the punishment actually inflicted. A
  heavy fine and imprisonment accompanied the corporal penalties. Thus utterly
  ruined and degraded, and a mark for the finger of scorn to point at, Clement
  Lanyere, whose prospects had once been fair enough, as his features had been
  prepossessing, became soured and malevolent, embittered against the world,
  and at war with society. He turned promoter, or, in modern parlance,
  informer; lodging complaints, seeking out causes for prosecutions, and
  bringing people into trouble in order to obtain part of the forfeits they
  incurred for his pains. Strange to say, he attached himself to Sir Giles
  Mompesson,&mdash;the cause of all his misfortunes,&mdash;and became one of
  the most active and useful of his followers. It was thought no good could
  come of this alliance, and that the promoter only bided his time to turn upon
  his master, against whom it was only natural he should nourish secret
  vengeance. But, if it were so, Sir Giles seemed to entertain no apprehensions
  of him, probably thinking he could crush him whenever he pleased. Either way
  the event was long deferred. Clement Lanyere, to all appearance, continued to
  serve his master zealously and well; and Sir Giles gave no sign whatever of
  distrust, but, on the contrary, treated him with increased confidence. The
  promoter was attired wholly in black&mdash;cloak, cap, doublet, and hose were
  of sable. And as, owing to the emoluments springing from his vile calling,
  his means were far greater than those of his comrades; so his habiliments
  were better. When wrapped in his mantle, with his mutilated countenance
  covered with a mask which he generally wore, the informer might have passed
  for a cavalier; so tall and well formed was his figure, and so bold his
  deportment. The dangerous service he was employed upon, which exposed him to
  insult and injury, required him to be well armed; and he took care to be
  so.</p>

  <p>Two or three of Sir Giles's myrmidons, having been selected for particular
  description, the designations of some others must suffice&mdash;such as
  Staring Hugh, a rascal of unmatched effrontery; the Gib Cat and Cutting Dick,
  dissolute rogues from the Pickt-hatch in Turnbull Street, near Clerkenwell;
  old Tom Wootton, once a notorious harbourer of "masterless men," at his house
  at Smart's Quay, but now a sheriffs officer; and, perhaps, it ought to be
  mentioned, that there were some half-dozen swash-bucklers and sharpers from
  Alsatia, under the command of Captain Bludder, who was held responsible for
  their good conduct.</p>

  <p>Such was Sir Giles's body-guard.</p>

  <p>On his entrance, it may be remarked, the curtain in front of the raised
  table was more closely drawn, so as completely to conceal the guests. But
  their importance might be inferred from the serving-men, in rich liveries,
  standing before the traverse.</p>

  <p>Profound silence reigned throughout the assemblage.</p>

  <p>Having uncovered, as before mentioned, and made a formal reverence to the
  company, Sir Giles spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I crave your pardon, worthy Sirs," he said, in a distinct and resolute
  voice, "for this intrusion, and regret to be the means of marring your
  festivity. I came hither wholly unprepared to find such an assemblage. Yet,
  though I would willingly have chosen a more fitting opportunity for my visit,
  and would postpone, if I could, to another occasion, the unpleasant duty I
  have to fulfil; the matter is urgent, and will not admit of delay. You will
  hold me excused, therefore, if I proceed with it, regardless of your
  presence; and I am well assured no let or interruption will be offered me,
  seeing I act with the royal licence and authority, of which I am the unworthy
  representative."</p>

  <p>"Truly, your conduct requires explanation," Jocelyn Mounchensey cried, in
  a mocking tone. "If I had not been here in London, I should have judged, from
  your appearance, and that of your attendants, that a band of desperate
  marauders had broken in upon us, and that we must draw our swords to defend
  our lives, and save the house from pillage. But after what you have said, I
  conclude you to be the sheriff, come with your followers to execute some writ
  of attachment; and therefore, however annoying the presence of such a
  functionary may be,&mdash;however ill-timed may be your visit, and unmannerly
  your deportment,&mdash;we are bound not to molest you."</p>

  <p>Provocation like this was rarely addressed to Sir Giles; and the choler
  occasioned by it was increased by the laughter and cheers of the company.
  Nevertheless he constrained his anger, replying in a stern, scornful
  tone&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I would not counsel you to molest me, young man. The mistake you have
  committed in regard to myself may be pardoned in one of your evident
  inexperience; who, fresh from the boorish society of the country, finds
  himself, for the first time, amongst well-bred gentlemen. Of all here present
  you are probably the sole person ignorant that I am Sir Giles Mompesson. But
  it is scarcely likely that they should be aware, as I chance to be, that the
  clownish insolent who has dared to wag his tongue against me, is the son of a
  Star-Chamber delinquent."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-9"
     name="ch1-9">CHAPTER IX.<br>
  The Letters-Patent.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A slight reaction in Sir Giles's favour was produced by his
  speech, but Jocelyn quite regained his position with the company when he
  exclaimed&mdash;</p>

  <p>"My father was misjudged. His prosecutor was a villain, and his sentence
  iniquitous."</p>

  <p>"You have uttered your own condemnation, Jocelyn Mounchensey," Sir Giles
  cried, with a savage laugh. "Know, to your confusion, that the High Court of
  Star-Chamber is so tender of upholding the honour of its sentences, that it
  ever punishes such as speak against them with the greatest severity. You have
  uttered your scandals openly."</p>

  <p>"Imprudent young man, you have, indeed, placed yourself in fearful
  jeopardy," a gentleman near him observed to Jocelyn. "Escape, if you can. You
  are lost, if you remain here."</p>

  <p>But instead of following the friendly advice, Jocelyn would have assaulted
  Sir Giles, if he had not been forcibly withheld by the gentleman.</p>

  <p>The knight was not slow to follow up the advantage he had gained.</p>

  <p>"Stand forward, Clement Lanyere," he exclaimed, authoritatively.</p>

  <p>The promoter instantly advanced.</p>

  <p>"Look at this man," Sir Giles continued, addressing Jocelyn; "and you will
  perceive how those who malign the Star-Chamber are treated. This disfigured
  countenance was once as free from seam or scar as your own; and yet, for an
  offence lighter than yours, it hath been stamped, as you see, with indelible
  infamy. Answer, Clement Lanyere,&mdash;and answer according to your
  conscience,&mdash;Was the sentence just of the high and honourable court by
  which you were tried?"</p>

  <p>"It was just," the promoter replied, a deep flush dyeing his ghastly
  visage.</p>

  <p>"And lenient?"</p>

  <p>"Most lenient. For it left my foul tongue the power of speech it now
  enjoys."</p>

  <p>"By whom were you prosecuted in the Star-Chamber?"</p>

  <p>"By him I now serve."</p>

  <p>"That is, by myself. Do you bear me malice for what I did?"</p>

  <p>"I have never said so. On the contrary, Sir Giles, I have always declared
  I owe you a deep debt."</p>

  <p>"Which you strive to pay?"</p>

  <p>"Which I <i>will</i> pay."</p>

  <p>"You hear what this man says, Mounchensey?" Sir Giles cried. "You have
  been guilty of the same offence as he. Why should you not be similarly
  punished?"</p>

  <p>"If I were so punished, I would stab my prosecutor to the heart," Jocelyn
  replied.</p>

  <p>At this rejoinder, Lanyere, who had hitherto kept his eyes on the ground,
  suddenly raised them, with a look of singular expression at the speaker.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Sir Giles ejaculated. "I must proceed to extremities with him, I
  find. Keep strict watch upon him, Lanyere; and follow him if he goes forth.
  Trace him to his lair. Now to business. Give me the letters-patent, Lupo," he
  added, turning to the scrivener, as Lanyere retired. "These Letters-Patent,"
  continued Sir Giles, taking two parchment scrolls with large seals pendent
  from them from Lupo Vulp, and displaying them to the assemblage, "these Royal
  Letters," he repeated in his steady, stern tones, and glancing round with a
  look of half-defiance, "passed under the great seal, and bearing the king's
  sign-manual, as ye see, gentlemen, constitute the authority on which I act.
  They accord to me and my co-patentee, Sir Francis Mitchell, absolute and
  uncontrolled power and discretion in granting and refusing licenses to all
  tavern-keepers and hostel-keepers throughout London. They give us full power
  to enter and inspect all taverns and hostels, at any time that may seem fit
  to us; to prevent any unlawful games being used therein; and to see that good
  order and rule be maintained. They also render it compulsory upon all
  ale-house-keepers, tavern-keepers, and inn-keepers throughout London, to
  enter into their own recognizances with us against the non-observance of our
  rules and regulations for their governance and maintenance, and to find two
  sureties: and in case of the forfeiture of such recognizances by any act of
  the parties, coming within the scope of our authority, it is provided that
  one moiety of the sum forfeited be paid to the Crown, and the other moiety to
  us. Lend me your ears yet further, I pray ye, gentlemen. These Royal Letters
  empower us to inflict certain fines and penalties upon all such as offend
  against our authority, or resist our claims; and they enable us to apprehend
  and commit to prison such offenders without further warrant than the letters
  themselves contain. In brief, gentlemen," he continued in a peremptory tone,
  as if insisting upon attention, "you will observe, that the absolute control
  of all houses of entertainment, where exciseable liquors are vended, is
  delegated to us by his most gracious Majesty, King James. To which end ample
  powers have been given us by his Majesty, who has armed us with the strong
  arm of the law. Will it please ye to inspect the letters, gentlemen?" holding
  them forth. "You will find that his Majesty hath thus written;&mdash;'<i>In
  cujus rei testimonium has Literas nostras fieri fecimus patentes. Teste
  Meipso, apud Westm. 10 die Maij, Anno Regni nostri</i>,' etc. Then follows
  the royal signature. None of ye, I presume, will question its
  authenticity?"</p>

         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>A deep silence succeeded, in the midst of which Jocelyn Mounchensey broke
  forth:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I, for one, question it," he cried. "I will never believe that a king,
  who, like our gracious sovereign, has the welfare of his subjects at heart,
  would sanction the oppression and injustice which those warrants, if
  entrusted to unscrupulous hands, must inevitably accomplish. I therefore
  mistrust the genuineness of the signature. If not forged, it has been
  obtained by fraud or misrepresentation."</p>

  <p>Some murmurs of applause followed this bold speech; but the gentleman who
  had previously counselled the young man again interposed, and whispered these
  words in his ear:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Your rash vehemence will undo you, if you take not heed. Beyond question,
  Sir Giles hath the king's sanction for what he does, and to censure him as
  you have done is to censure the Crown, which is next to treason. Be ruled by
  me, my good young Sir, and meddle no more in the matter."</p>

  <p>Sir Giles, who had some difficulty in controlling his choler, now
  spoke:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You have cast an imputation upon me, Jocelyn Mounchensey," he cried with
  concentrated fury, "which you shall be compelled to retract as publicly as
  you have made it. To insult an officer of the Crown, in the discharge of his
  duty, is to insult the Crown itself, as you will find. In the King's name, I
  command you to hold your peace, or, in the King's name, I will instantly
  arrest you; and I forbid any one to give you aid. I will not be troubled
  thus. Appointed by his Majesty to a certain office, I exercise it as much for
  the benefit of the Royal Exchequer, as for my own personal advantage. I have
  his Majesty's full approval of what I do, and I need nothing more. I am
  accountable to no man&mdash;save the King," addressing this menace as much to
  the rest of the company as to Jocelyn. "But I came not here to render
  explanation, but to act. What, ho! Madame Bonaventure! Where are ye, Madame?
  Oh! you are here!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Bon jour</i>, sweet Sir Giles," the landlady said, making him a
  profound obeisance. "What is your pleasure with me, Sir? And to what am I to
  attribute the honour of this visit?"</p>

  <p>"Tut! Madame. You know well enough what brings me hither, and thus
  attended," he replied. "I come in pursuance of a notice, served upon you a
  month ago. You will not deny having received it, since the officer who placed
  it in your hands is here present." And he indicated Clement Lanyere.</p>

  <p>"<i>Au contraire</i>, Sir Giles," Madame Bonaventure replied. "I readily
  admit the receipt of a written message from you, which, though scarcely
  intelligible to my poor comprehension, did not seem as agreeably worded as a
  <i>billet-doux. Mais, ma foi</i>! I attached little importance to it. I did
  not suppose it possible&mdash;nor do I suppose it possible now"&mdash;with a
  captivating smile, which was totally lost upon Sir Giles&mdash;"that you
  could adopt such rigorous measures against me."</p>

  <p>"My measures may appear rigorous, Madame," Sir Giles coldly replied; "but
  I am warranted in taking them. Nay, I am compelled to take them. Not having
  made the satisfaction required by the notice, you have deprived yourself of
  the protection I was willing to afford you. I am now merely your judge. The
  penalties incurred by your neglect are these: Your licence was suspended a
  month ago; the notice expressly stating that it would be withdrawn, unless
  certain conditions were fulfilled. Consequently, as ever since that time you
  have been vending exciseable liquors without lawful permission, you have
  incurred a fine of one hundred marks a day, making a total of three thousand
  marks now due and owing from you, partly to his Majesty, and partly to his
  Majesty's representatives. This sum I now demand."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Dieu! three thousand marks!" Madame Bonaventure screamed. "What
  robbery is this!&mdash;what barbarity! 'T is ruin&mdash;utter ruin! I may as
  well close my house altogether, and return to my own fair country. As I am an
  honest woman, Sir Giles, I cannot pay it. So it is quite useless on your part
  to make any such demand."</p>

  <p>"You profess inability to pay, Madame," Sir Giles rejoined. "I cannot
  believe you; having some knowledge of your means. Nevertheless, I will
  acquaint you with a rule of law applicable to the contingency you put.
  '<i>Quod non habet in cere, luet in corpore</i>' is a decree of the
  Star-Chamber; meaning, for I do not expect you to understand Latin, that he
  who cannot pay in purse shall pay in person. Aware of the alternative, you
  will make your choice. And you may thank me that I have not adjudged you at
  once&mdash;as I have the power&mdash;to three months within the Wood Street
  Compter."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Sir Giles! what an atrocious idea. You are worse than a savage to
  talk of such a loathsome prison to me. Ah! mon Dieu! what is to happen to me!
  would I were back again in my lovely Bordeaux!"</p>

  <p>"You will have an opportunity of revisiting that fine city, Madame; for
  you will no longer be able to carry on your calling here."</p>

  <p>"Ciel! Sir Giles! what mean you?"</p>

  <p>"I mean, Madame, that you are disabled from keeping any tavern for the
  space of three years."</p>

  <p>Madame Bonaventure clasped her hands together, and screamed aloud.</p>

  <p>"In pity, Sir Giles!&mdash;In pity!" she cried.</p>

  <p>The inexorable knight shook his head. The low murmurs of indignation among
  the company which had been gradually gathering force during the foregoing
  dialogue, now became clamorous. "A most scandalous proceeding!" exclaimed
  one. "Deprive us of our best French ordinary!" cried another. "Infamous
  extortioner!" shouted a third. "We'll not permit such injustice. Let us take
  the law into our own hands, and settle the question!" shouted a fourth. "Ay,
  down with the knight!" added a fifth.</p>

  <p>But Sir Giles continued perfectly unmoved by the tempest raging around,
  and laughed to scorn these menaces, contenting himself with signing to
  Captain Bludder to be in readiness.</p>

  <p>"A truce to this, gentlemen;" he at length thundered forth; "the King's
  warrant must be respected."</p>

  <p>Again Madame Bonaventure besought his pity, but in vain. She took hold of
  his arm, and feigned to kneel to him; but he shook her coldly off.</p>

  <p>"You are a very charming woman, no doubt, Madame," he said sarcastically;
  "and some men might find you irresistible; but I am not made of such yielding
  stuff, and you may spare yourself further trouble, for all your powers of
  persuasion will fail with me. I renew my demand&mdash;and for the last time.
  Do not compel me to resort to extremities with you. It would grieve me," he
  added with a bitter smile, "to drag so pretty a woman through the public
  streets, like a common debtor, to the Compter."</p>

  <p>"Grace! grace! Sir Giles," cried Madame Bonaventure. Then seeing him
  remain inflexible, she added, in an altered tone, "I will never submit with
  life to such an indignity&mdash;never!"</p>

  <p>"We'll all protect you, Madame," cried the assemblage with one
  voice&mdash;"Let him lay hands upon you, and he shall see."</p>

  <p>Sir Giles glanced at his myrmidons. They stepped quickly towards him in a
  body. At the same time Jocelyn Mounchensey, whom no efforts of the friendly
  gentleman could now restrain, sprang forward, and, drawing his sword, was
  just in time to place himself before Madame Bonaventure, as she drew hastily
  back.</p>

  <p>"Have no fear, Madame, you are safe with me," the young man said, glancing
  fiercely at the knight and his troop.</p>

  <p>The greatest confusion now reigned throughout the room. Other swords were
  drawn, and several of the guests mounted upon the benches to overlook the
  scene. Cyprien, and the rest of the drawers and tradesmen ranged themselves
  behind their mistress, prepared to resist any attempt on the part of the
  myrmidons to seize her. The curtain at the head of the room was partly drawn
  aside, showing that the distinguished persons at the upper table were equally
  excited.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," Sir Giles said, still maintaining perfect calmness in the
  midst of the tumult, "a word with you ere it be too late. I don't address
  myself to you, Jocelyn Mounchensey, for you are undeserving of any friendly
  consideration&mdash;but to all others I would counsel forbearance and
  non-resistance. Deliver up that woman to me."</p>

  <p>"I will die upon the spot sooner than you shall be surrendered," said
  Jocelyn, encouraging the hostess, who clung to his disengaged arm.</p>

  <p>"Oh! merci! grand merci, mon beau gentilhomme!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Am I to understand then, that you mean to impede me in the lawful
  execution of my purposes, gentlemen?" Sir Giles demanded.</p>

  <p>"We mean to prevent an unlawful arrest," several voices rejoined.</p>

  <p>"Be it so," the knight said; "I wash my hands of the consequences." Then
  turning to his followers, he added&mdash;"Officers, at all hazards, attach
  the person of Dameris Bonaventure, and convey her to the Compter. At the same
  time, arrest the young man-beside her&mdash;Jocelyn Mounchensey,&mdash;who
  has uttered treasonable language against our sovereign lord the King. I will
  tell you how to dispose of him anon. Do my bidding at once."</p>

  <p>But ere the order could be obeyed, the authoritative voice which had
  previously been heard from the upper table exclaimed&mdash;"Hold!"</p>

  <p>Sir Giles paused; looked irresolute for a minute; and then checked his
  myrmidons with a wave of the hand.</p>

  <p>"Who is it stays the law?" he said, with the glare of a tiger from whom a
  bone has been snatched.</p>

  <p>"One you must needs obey, Sir Giles," replied Lord Roos, coming towards
  him from the upper table. "You have unconsciously played a part in a
  comedy&mdash;and played it very well, too&mdash;but it is time to bring the
  piece to an end. We are fast verging on the confines of tragedy."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you, my lord," Sir Giles returned, gravely. "I
  discern nothing comic in the matter; though much of serious import."</p>

  <p>"You do not perceive the comedy, because it has been part of our scheme to
  keep you in the dark, Sir Giles."</p>

  <p>"So there is a scheme, then, a-foot here, my lord?&mdash;ha!"</p>

  <p>"A little merry plot; nothing more, Sir Giles&mdash;in the working of
  which your worthy co-patentee, Sir Francis Mitchell, has materially
  assisted."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Sir Giles, glancing at his partner, who still occupied his
  elevated position upon the table&mdash;"I presume, then, I have to thank you,
  my lord, for the indignity offered to my friend?"</p>

  <p>"As you please, Sir Giles," Lord Roos returned carelessly. "You call it an
  indignity; but in my opinion the best thing to be done with a man whose head
  so swims with wine that his legs refuse to support him, is to tie him in a
  chair. He may else sacrifice his dignity by rolling under the table. But let
  this pass for the nonce. Before Sir Francis was wholly overcome, he was good
  enough to give me his signature. You saw him do it, gentlemen?" he added,
  appealing to the company.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;yes!&mdash;we saw him write it!" was the general reply.</p>

  <p>"And to what end was this done, my lord?" Sir Giles demanded, sternly.</p>

  <p>"To enable me," replied the imperturbable young nobleman, "to draw out a
  receipt in full of your joint claims against Madame Bonaventure. I have done
  it, Sir Giles; and here it is. And I have taken care to grant a renewal of
  her licence from the date of your notice; so that no penalties or fines can
  attach to her for neglect. Take it, Madame Bonaventure" he continued, handing
  her the paper. "It is your full acquittance."</p>

  <p>"And think you, my lord, that this shallow artifice&mdash;to give it no
  harsher term&mdash;will avail you any thing?" Sir Giles cried scornfully. "I
  set it aside at once."</p>

  <p>"Your pardon, Sir Giles; you will do no such thing."</p>

  <p>"And who will hinder me?&mdash;You, my lord?"</p>

  <p>"Even I, Sir Giles. Proceed at your peril."</p>

  <p>The young nobleman's assurance staggered his opponent.</p>

  <p>"He must have some one to uphold him, or he would not be thus confident,"
  he thought. "Whose was the voice I heard? It sounded like&mdash;No matter!
  'Tis needful to be cautious."</p>

  <p>"You do not, then, hold yourself bound by the acts of your partner, Sir
  Giles?" Lord Roos said.</p>

  <p>"I deny this to be his act," the knight replied.</p>

  <p>"Better question him at once on the subject," Lord Roos said. "Set him
  free, Cyprien."</p>

  <p>The Gascon did as he was bidden, and with the aid of his fellow drawers,
  helped Sir Francis from the table. To the surprise of the company, the knight
  then managed to stagger forward unassisted, and would have embraced Sir
  Giles, if the latter had not thrust him off in disgust, with some
  violence.</p>

  <p>"What folly is this, Sir Francis?" Sir Giles cried angrily. "You have
  forgotten yourself strangely, you have taken leave of your senses,
  methinks!"</p>

  <p>"Not a whit of it, Sir Giles&mdash;not a whit. I never was more my own
  master than I am at present, as I will prove to you."</p>

  <p>"Prove it, then, by explaining how you came to sign that paper. You could
  not mean to run counter to me?"</p>

  <p>"But I did," Sir Francis rejoined, highly offended. "I meant to run
  counter to you in signing it, and I mean it now."</p>

  <p>"'Sdeath! you besotted fool, you are playing into their hands!"</p>

  <p>"Besotted fool in your teeth, Sir Giles. I am as sober as yourself. My
  hand has been put to that paper, and what it contains I stand by."</p>

  <p>"You design, then, to acquit Madame Bonaventure? Consider what you
  say?"</p>

  <p>"No need for consideration; I have always designed it."</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand thanks, Sir Francis!" the hostess cried. "I knew I had an
  excellent friend in you."</p>

  <p>The enamoured knight seized the hand she extended towards him, but in the
  attempt to kiss it fell to the ground, amid the laughter of the company.</p>

  <p>"Are you satisfied now, Sir Giles?" asked Lord Roos.</p>

  <p>"I am satisfied that Sir Francis has been duped," he replied, "and that
  when his brain is free from the fumes of wine, he will bitterly regret his
  folly. But even his discharge will be insufficient. Though it may bind me, it
  will not bind the Crown, which will yet enforce its claims."</p>

  <p>"That, Sir Giles, I leave competent authority to decide," Lord Roos
  replied, retiring.</p>

  <p>And as he withdrew, the curtains before the upper table were entirely
  withdrawn, disclosing the whole of the brilliant assemblage, and at the head
  of them one person far more brilliant and distinguished than the rest.</p>

  <p>"Buckingham!" Sir Giles exclaimed. "I thought I knew the voice."</p>

  <p>It was, indeed, the King's omnipotent favourite. Magnificently attired,
  the Marquis of Buckingham as far outshone his companions in splendour of
  habiliments as he did in stateliness of carriage and beauty of person. Rising
  from the table, and donning his plumed hat, looped with diamonds, with a
  gesture worthy of a monarch, while all the rest remained uncovered, as if in
  recognition of his superior dignity, he descended to where Sir Giles
  Mompesson was standing. It need scarcely be said that Jocelyn Mounchensey had
  never seen the superb favourite before; but he did not require to be told
  whom he beheld, so perfectly did Buckingham realize the descriptions given of
  him. A little above the ordinary height, with a figure of the most perfect
  symmetry, and features as aristocratic and haughty as handsome, it was
  impossible to conceive a prouder or a nobler-looking personage than the
  marquis. His costume was splendid, consisting of a doublet of white cut
  velvet, roped with pearls, which fitted him to admiration. Over his shoulders
  he wore a mantle of watchet-coloured velvet; his neck was encircled by a
  falling band; and silken hose of the same colour as the doublet completed his
  costume. His deportment was singularly dignified; but his manner might have
  conciliated more if it had been less imperious and disdainful.</p>

  <p>Sir Giles made a profound obeisance as Buckingham advanced towards him.
  His salutation was haughtily returned.</p>

  <p>"I have heard something of your mode of proceeding with the keepers of
  taverns and hostels, Sir Giles," the proud marquis said; "but this is the
  first occasion on which I have seen it put in practice,&mdash;and I am free
  to confess that you deal not over gently with them, if the present may be
  considered a specimen of your ordinary conduct. Those letters-patent were not
  confided to you by his Majesty to distress his subjects, for your own
  particular advantage and profit, but to benefit the community by keeping such
  places of entertainment in better order than heretofore. I fear you have
  somewhat abused your warrant, Sir Giles."</p>

  <p>"If to devote myself, heart and soul, to his Majesty's service, and to
  enrich his Majesty's exchequer be to abuse my warrant, I have done so, my
  lord Marquis,&mdash;but not otherwise. I have ever vindicated the dignity and
  authority of the Crown. You have just heard that, though my own just claims
  have been defeated by the inadvertence of my co-patentee, I have advanced
  those of the King."</p>

  <p>"The King relinquishes all claims in the present case," Buckingham
  replied. "His gracious Majesty gave me full discretion in the matter, and I
  act as I know he himself would have acted."</p>

  <p>And waving his hand to signify that he would listen to no remonstrances,
  the Marquis turned to Madame Bonaventure, who instantly prostrated herself
  before him, as she would have done before royalty itself, warmly thanking him
  for his protection.</p>

  <p>"You must thank my Lord Roos, and not me, Madame," Buckingham graciously
  replied, raising her as he spoke. "It was at his lordship's instance I came
  here. He takes a warm interest in you, Madame."</p>

  <p>"I shall ever be beholden to his lordship, I am sure," Madame Bonaventure
  said, casting down her eyes and blushing, or feigning to blush, "as well as
  to you, Monseigneur."</p>

  <p>"My Lord Roos avouched," pursued Buckingham, "that at the Three Cranes I
  should find the prettiest hostess and the best wine in London; and on my
  faith as a gentleman! I must say he was wrong in neither particular. Brighter
  eyes I have never beheld&mdash;rarer claret I have never drunk."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Monseigneur! you quite overwhelm me. My poor house can scarcely hope
  to be honoured a second time with such a presence; but should it so
  chance"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You will give me as good welcome as you have done to-day. No lack of
  inducement to repeat the visit. Sir Giles Mompesson!"</p>

  <p>"My lord Marquis."</p>

  <p>"I lay my commands upon you, good Sir Giles, that no further molestation
  be offered to Madame Bonaventure, but that you give a good report of her
  house. Withdraw your followers without delay."</p>

  <p>"Your commands shall be obeyed, my lord Marquis," Sir Giles rejoined; "but
  before I go I have an arrest to make. That young man," pointing to Jocelyn,
  "has been talking treason."</p>

  <p>"It is false, my lord Marquis," Jocelyn replied. "His Majesty hath not a
  more loyal subject than myself. I would cut out my tongue rather than speak
  against him. I have said the King is ill served in such officers as Giles
  Mompesson and Sir Francis Mitchell, and I abide by my words. They can reflect
  no dishonour on his Majesty."</p>

  <p>"Save that they seem to imply a belief on your part that his Majesty has
  chosen his officers badly," Buckingham said, regarding the young man
  fixedly.</p>

  <p>"Not so, my lord Marquis, These men may have been favourably represented
  to his Majesty, who no doubt has been kept in ignorance of their iniquitous
  proceedings."</p>

  <p>"What are you driving at, Sir?" Buckingham cried, almost fiercely.</p>

  <p>"I mean, my lord Marquis, that these persons may be the creatures of some
  powerful noble, whose interest it is to throw a cloak over their
  malpractices."</p>

  <p>"'Fore heaven! some covert insult would seem to be intended," exclaimed
  Buckingham. "Who is this young man, Sir Giles?"</p>

  <p>"He is named Jocelyn Mounchensey, my lord Marquis; and is the son of an
  old Norfolk knight baronet, who, you may remember, was arraigned before the
  Court of Star-Chamber, heavily fined, and imprisoned."</p>

  <p>"I do remember the case, and the share you and Sir Francis had in it, Sir
  Giles," Buckingham rejoined.</p>

  <p>"I am right glad to hear that, my lord," said Jocelyn. "You will not then
  wonder that I avow myself their mortal enemy."</p>

  <p>"We laugh to scorn these idle vapourings," said Sir Giles; "and were it
  permitted," he added, touching his sword, "I myself would find an easy way to
  silence them. But the froward youth, whose brains seem crazed with his
  fancied wrongs, is not content with railing against us, but must needs lift
  up his voice against all constituted authority. He hath spoken contemptuously
  of the Star-Chamber,&mdash;and that, my lord Marquis, as you well know, is an
  offence, which cannot be passed over."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for it," Buckingham rejoined; "but if he will retract what he
  has said, and express compunction, with promise of amendment in future, I
  will exert my influence to have him held harmless."</p>

  <p>"I will never retract what I have said against that iniquitous tribunal,"
  Jocelyn rejoined firmly. "I will rather die a martyr, as my father did, in
  the cause of truth."</p>

  <p>"Your kindness is altogether thrown away upon him, my lord," Sir Giles
  said, with secret satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"So I perceive," Buckingham rejoined. "Our business is over," he added, to
  the nobles and gallants around him; "so we may to our barges. You, my lord,"
  he added to Lord Roos, "will doubtless tarry to receive the thanks of our
  pretty hostess."</p>

  <p>And graciously saluting Madame Bonaventure, he quitted the tavern
  accompanied by a large train, and entering his barge amid the acclamations of
  the spectators, was rowed towards Whitehall.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-10"
     name="ch1-10">CHAPTER X.<br>
  The 'Prentices and Their Leader.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">While the Marquis of Buckingham and his suite were moving
  towards the wharf, amid the acclamations of the crowd (for in the early part
  of his brilliant career the haughty favourite was extremely popular with the
  multitude, probably owing to the princely largesses he was in the habit of
  distributing among them), a very different reception awaited those who
  succeeded him. The hurrahs and other vociferations of delight and enthusiasm
  were changed into groans, hootings, and discordant yells, when Sir Francis
  Mitchell came in sight, supported between two stout myrmidons, and scarcely
  able to maintain his perpendicular as he was borne by them towards the wherry
  in waiting for him near the stairs. Though the knight was escorted by Captain
  Bludder and his Alsatian bullies, several of the crowd did not seem disposed
  to confine themselves to jeers and derisive shouts, but menaced him with some
  rough usage. Planting themselves in his path, they shook their fists in his
  face, with other gestures of defiance and indignity, and could only be
  removed by force. Captain Bludder and his roaring blades assumed their
  fiercest looks, swore their loudest oaths, twisted their shaggy moustaches,
  and tapped their rapier-hilts; but they prudently forbore to draw their
  weapons, well knowing that the proceeding would be a signal for a brawl, and
  that the cry of "Clubs!" would be instantly raised.</p>

  <p>Amongst the foremost of those who thus obstructed Sir Francis and his
  party was a young man with a lithe active figure, bright black eyes, full of
  liveliness and malice, an olive complexion, and a gipsy-like cast of
  countenance. Attired in a tight-fitting brown frieze jerkin with stone
  buttons, and purple hose, his head was covered with a montero cap, with a
  cock's feather stuck in it. He was armed neither with sword nor dagger, but
  carried a large cudgel or club, the well-known and formidable weapon, of the
  London 'prentices, in the use of which, whether as a quarterstaff or missile,
  they were remarkably expert. Even a skilful swordsman stood but poor chance
  with them. Besides this saucy-looking personage, who was addressed as Dick
  Taverner by his comrades, there were many others, who, to judge from their
  habiliments and their cudgels, belonged to the same fraternity as himself;
  that is to say, they were apprentices to grocers, drapers, haberdashers,
  skinners, ironmongers, vintners, or other respectable artificers or
  tradesfolk.</p>

  <p>Now Dick Taverner had an especial grudge against our two extortioners, for
  though he himself, being 'prentice to a bookseller in Paul's Churchyard, had
  little concern with them, he was the son of an inn-keeper&mdash;Simon
  Taverner, of the Emperor's Head, Garlick Hill&mdash;who had been recently
  mined by their exactions, his licence taken from him, and his house closed:
  enough to provoke a less mettlesome spark than Dick, who had vowed to revenge
  the parental injuries on the first opportunity. The occasion now seemed to
  present itself, and it was not to be lost. Chancing to be playing at bowls in
  the alley behind the Three Cranes with some of his comrades on the day in
  question, Dick learnt from Cyprien what was going forward, and the party
  resolved to have their share in the sport. If needful, they promised the
  drawer to rescue his mistress from the clutches of her antagonists, and to
  drive them from the premises. But their services in this respect were not
  required. They next decided on giving Sir Francis Mitchell a sound ducking in
  the Thames.</p>

  <p>Their measures were quickly and warily taken. Issuing from an arched
  doorway at the side of the tavern, they stationed some of their number near
  it, while the main party posted themselves at the principal entrance in
  front. Scouts were planted inside, to communicate with Cyprien, and
  messengers were despatched to cry "Clubs!" and summon the neighbouring
  'prentices from Queenhithe, Thames Street, Trinity Lane, Old Fish Street, and
  Dowgate Hill; so that fresh auxiliaries were constantly arriving. Buckingham,
  with the young nobles and gallants, were, of course, allowed to pass free,
  and were loudly cheered; but the 'prentices soon ascertained from their
  scouts that Sir Francis was coming forth, and made ready for him.</p>

  <p>Utterly unconscious of his danger, the inebriate knight replied to the
  gibes, scoffs, and menaces addressed to him, by snapping his fingers in his
  opponents' faces, and irritating them in their turn; but if he was insensible
  of the risk he ran, those around him were not, and his two supporters
  endeavoured to hurry him forward. Violently resisting their efforts, he tried
  to shake them off, and more than once stood stock-still, until compelled to
  go on. Arrived at the stairhead, he next refused to embark, and a scene of
  violent altercation ensued between him and his attendants. Many boats were
  moored off the shore, with a couple of barges close at hand; and the watermen
  and oarsmen standing up in their craft, listened to what was going forward
  with much apparent amusement.</p>

  <p>Hastily descending the steps, Captain Bludder placed himself near the
  wherry intended for the knight, and called to the others to make short work
  of it and bring him down. At this juncture the word was given by Dick
  Taverner, who acted as leader, and in less than two minutes, Sir Francis was
  transferred from the hands of his myrmidons to those of the 'prentices. To
  accomplish this, a vigorous application of cudgels was required, and some
  broken pates were the consequence of resistance; but the attack was perfectly
  successful; the myrmidons and Alsatians were routed, and the 'prentices
  remained masters of the field, and captors of a prisoner. Stupefied with rage
  and astonishment, Captain Bludder looked on; at one moment thinking of
  drawing his sword, and joining the fray; but the next, perceiving that his
  men were evidently worsted, he decided upon making off; and with this view he
  was about to jump into the wherry, when his purpose was prevented by Dick
  Taverner, and a few others of the most active of his companions, who dashed
  down the steps to where he stood. The captain had already got one foot in the
  wherry, and the watermen, equally alarmed with himself, were trying to push
  off, when the invaders came up, and, springing into the boat, took possession
  of the oars, sending Bludder floundering into the Thames, where he sunk up to
  the shoulders, and stuck fast in the mud, roaring piteously for help.</p>

  <p>Scarcely were the 'prentices seated, than Sir Francis Mitchell was brought
  down to them, and the poor knight, beginning to comprehend the jeopardy in
  which he was placed, roared for help as lustily as the half-drowned Alsatian
  captain, and quite as ineffectually. The latter was left to shift for
  himself, but the former was rowed out some twenty or thirty yards from the
  shore, where, a stout cord being fastened to his girdle, he was plunged
  head-foremost into the river; and after being thrice drawn up, and as often
  submerged again, he was dragged on board, and left to shiver and shake in his
  dripping habiliments in the stern of the boat. The bath had completely
  sobered him, and he bitterly bemoaned himself, declaring that if he did not
  catch his death of cold he should be plagued with cramps and rheumatism
  during the rest of his days. He did not dare to utter any threats against his
  persecutors, but he internally vowed to be revenged upon them&mdash;cost what
  it might. The 'prentices laughed at his complaints, and Dick Taverner told
  him&mdash;"that as he liked not cold water, he should have spared them their
  ale and wine; but, as he had meddled with their liquors, and with those who
  sold them, they had given him a taste of a different beverage, which they
  should provide, free of cost, for all those who interfered with their
  enjoyments, and the rights of the public." Dick added, "that his last sousing
  was in requital for the stoppage of the Emperor's Head, and that, with his
  own free will, he would have left him under the water, with a stone round his
  neck."</p>

  <p>This measure of retributive justice accomplished, the 'prentices and their
  leader made for the stairs, where they landed, after telling the watermen to
  row their fare to the point nearest his lodgings; an order which was seconded
  by Sir Francis himself, who was apprehensive of further outrage. Neither
  would he tarry to take in Captain Bludder, though earnestly implored to do so
  by that personage, who, having in his struggles sunk deeper into the oozy
  bed, could now only just keep his bearded chin and mouth above the level of
  the tide. Taking compassion upon him, Dick Taverner threw him an oar, and,
  instantly grasping it, the Alsatian was in this way dragged ashore;
  presenting a very woful spectacle, his nether limbs being covered with slime,
  while the moisture poured from his garments, as it would from the coat of a
  water-spaniel. His hat had floated down the stream, and he had left one boot
  sticking in the mud, while his buff jerkin, saturated with wet, clung to his
  skin like a damp glove.</p>

  <p>Leaving him to wring his cloak and dry his habiliments in the best way he
  could, the leader of the 'prentices collected together his forces, and,
  disposing them in something like military array, placed himself at their
  head, and marched towards the tavern, where they set up a great shout.
  Hitherto they had met with no interruption whatever. On the contrary, the
  watermen, bargemen, and others, had cheered them on in their work of
  mischief; and the crowd on shore appeared rather friendly to them than
  otherwise. Flushed with success, the riotous youths seemed well disposed to
  carry their work of retribution to extremities, and to inflict some
  punishment upon Sir Giles proportionate to his enormities. Having
  ascertained, from their scouts, that no one connected with the usurious
  knight had come forth, they felt quite secure of their prey, and were
  organising a plan of attack, when intelligence was brought by a scout that a
  great disturbance was going on inside, in consequence of a young gentleman
  having been arrested by Sir Giles and his crew, and that their presence was
  instantly required by Madame Bonaventure.</p>

  <p>On hearing this, Dick Taverner shouted&mdash;"To the rescue! to the
  rescue!" and rushed into the house, followed by the 'prentices, who loudly
  echoed his cries.</p>

  <p>"<i>Par ici, Messieurs! Par ici!</i>&mdash;this way, this way!"
  vociferated Cyprien, who met them in the passage&mdash;"the
  bowling-alley&mdash;there they are!"</p>

  <p>But the Gascon's directions were scarcely needed. The clashing of swords
  would have served to guide the 'prentices to the scene of conflict.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-11"
     name="ch1-11">CHAPTER XI.<br>
  John Wolfe.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When Jocelyn Mounchensey called for his reckoning, Madame
  Bonaventure took him aside, showing, by her looks, that she had something
  important to communicate to him, and began by telling him he was heartily
  welcome to all he had partaken of at her ordinary, adding that she considered
  herself very greatly his debtor for the gallantry and zeal he had displayed
  in her behalf.</p>

  <p>"Not that I was in any real peril, my fair young Sir," she continued,
  "though I feigned to be so, for I have powerful protectors, as you perceive;
  and indeed this was all a preconcerted scheme between my Lord Roos and his
  noble friends to turn the tables on the two extortioners. But that does not
  lessen my gratitude to you; and I shall try to prove it. You are in more
  danger than, perchance, you wot of; and I feel quite sure Sir Giles means to
  carry his threat into execution, and to cause your arrest."</p>

  <p>Seeing him smile disdainfully, as if he had no apprehensions, she added,
  somewhat quickly&mdash;"What will your bravery avail against so many, <i>mon
  beau gentilhomme? Mon Dieu</i>! nothing. No! no! I must get you assistance.
  Luckily I have some friends at hand, the 'prentices&mdash;<i>grands et forts
  gaillards, avec des estocs;</i>&mdash;Cyprien has told me they are here. Most
  certainly they will take your part. So, Sir Giles shall not carry you off,
  after all."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn's lips again curled with the same disdainful smile as before.</p>

  <p>"<i>Ah I vous etes trop temeraire!"</i> Madame Bonaventure cried, tapping
  his arm. "Sit down here for awhile. I will give you the signal when you may
  depart with safety. Do not attempt to stir till then. You understand?"</p>

  <p>Jocelyn did not understand very clearly; but without making any
  observation to the contrary, he took the seat pointed out to him. The
  position was well-chosen, inasmuch as it enabled him to command the movements
  of the foe, and offered him a retreat through a side-door, close at hand;
  though he was naturally quite ignorant whither the outlet might conduct
  him.</p>

  <p>While this was passing, Sir Giles was engaged in giving directions
  respecting his partner, whose inebriate condition greatly scandalized him;
  and it was in pursuance of his orders that Sir Francis was transported to the
  wharf where the misadventure before related befel him. Never for a moment did
  Sir Giles' watchful eye quit Jocelyn, upon whom he was ready to pounce like a
  tiger, if the young man made any movement to depart; and he only waited till
  the tavern should be clear of company to effect the seizure.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile another person approached the young man. This was the friendly
  stranger in the furred gown and flat cap, who had sat next him at dinner, and
  who, it appeared, was not willing to abandon him in his difficulties.
  Addressing him with much kindness, the worthy personage informed him that he
  was a bookseller, named John Wolfe, and carried on business at the sign of
  the Bible and Crown in Paul's Churchyard, where he should be glad to see the
  young man, whenever he was free to call upon him.</p>

  <p>"But I cannot disguise from you, Master Jocelyn Mounchensey&mdash;for your
  dispute with Sir Francis Mitchell has acquainted me with your name," John
  Wolfe said&mdash;"that your rashness has placed you in imminent peril; so
  that there is but little chance for the present of my showing you the
  hospitality and kindness I desire. Sir Giles seems to hover over you as a
  rapacious vulture might do before making his swoop. Heaven shield you from
  his talons! And now, my good young Sir, accept one piece of caution from me,
  which my years and kindly feelings towards you entitle me to make. An you
  'scape this danger, as I trust you may, let it be a lesson to you to put a
  guard upon your tongue, and not suffer it to out-run your judgment. You are
  much too rash and impetuous, and by your folly (nay, do not quarrel with me,
  my young friend&mdash;I can give no milder appellation to your conduct) have
  placed yourself in the power of your enemies. Not only have you provoked Sir
  Francis Mitchell, whose malice is more easily aroused than appeased, but you
  have defied Sir Giles Mompesson, who is equally implacable in his enmities;
  and as if two such enemies were not enough, you must needs make a third, yet
  more dangerous than either."</p>

  <p>"How so, good Master Wolfe?" Jocelyn cried. "To whom do you refer?"</p>

  <p>"To whom should I refer, Master Jocelyn," Wolfe rejoined, "but to my lord
  of Buckingham, whom you wantonly insulted? For the latter indiscretion there
  can be no excuse, whatever there may be for the former; and it was simple
  madness to affront a nobleman of his exalted rank, second only in authority
  to the King himself."</p>

  <p>"But how have I offended the Marquis?" demanded Jocelyn, surprised.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible you can have spoken at random, and without knowledge of
  the force of your own words?" John Wolfe rejoined, looking hard at him. "It
  may be so, for you are plainly ignorant of the world. Well, then," he added,
  lowering his tone, "when you said that these two abominable extortioners were
  the creatures of some great man, who glozed over their villainous practices
  to the King, and gave a better account of them than they deserve, you were
  nearer the truth than you imagined; but it could hardly be agreeable to the
  Marquis to be told this to his face, since it is notorious to all (except to
  yourself) that he is the man."</p>

  <p>"Heavens!" exclaimed Jocelyn, "I now see the error I have committed."</p>

  <p>"A grave error indeed," rejoined Wolfe, shaking his head, "and most
  difficult to be repaired&mdash;for the plea of ignorance, though it may
  suffice with me, will scarcely avail you with the Marquis. Indeed, it can
  never be urged, since he disowns any connection with these men; and it is
  suspected that his half-brother, Sir Edward Villiers, goes between them in
  all their secret transactions. Of this, however, I know nothing personally,
  and only tell you what I have heard. But if it were not almost treasonable to
  say it, I might add, that his Majesty is far too careless of the means
  whereby his exchequer is enriched, and his favourites gratified; and, at all
  events, suffers himself to be too easily imposed upon. Hence all these
  patents and monopolies under which we groan. The favourites <i>must</i> have
  money; and as the King has little to give them, they raise as much as they
  please on the credit of his name. Thus everything is <i>sold</i>; places,
  posts, titles, all have their price&mdash;bribery and corruption reign
  everywhere. The lord-keeper pays a pension to the Marquis&mdash;so doth the
  attorney-general&mdash;and simony is openly practised; for the Bishop of
  Salisbury paid him £3,500 for his bishopric. But this is not the worst of it.
  Is it not terrible to think of a proud nobleman, clothed almost with supreme
  authority, being secretly leagued with sordid wretches, whose practices he
  openly discountenances and contemns, and receiving share of their spoil? Is
  it not yet more terrible to reflect that the royal coffers are in some degree
  supplied by similar means?"</p>

  <p>"'Tis enough to drive an honest man distracted," Jocelyn said, "and you
  cannot wonder at my indignation, though you may blame my want of caution. I
  have said nothing half so strong as you have just uttered, Master Wolfe."</p>

  <p>"Ah! but, my good young Sir, I do not publicly proclaim my opinions as you
  do. My lord of Buckingham's name must no more be called in question than his
  Majesty's. To associate the Marquis's name with those of his known
  instruments were to give him mortal offence. Even to hint at such a
  connection is sufficient to provoke his displeasure! But enough of this. My
  purpose is not to lecture you, but to befriend you. Tell me frankly, my good
  young Sir&mdash;and be not offended with the offer&mdash;will my purse be
  useful to you? If so, 'tis freely at your service; and it may help you in
  your present emergency&mdash;for though there is not enough in it to bribe
  the master to forego his purpose against you, there is amply sufficient to
  procure your liberation, privily, from the men."</p>

  <p>"I thank you heartily, good Master Wolfe, and believe me, I am not
  withheld by false pride from accepting your offer," Jocelyn replied; "but I
  must trust to my own arm to maintain my liberty, and to my own address to
  regain it, if I be taken. Again, I thank you, Sir."</p>

  <p>"I grieve that I cannot lend you other aid," John Wolfe replied, looking
  compassionately at him; "but my peaceful avocations do not permit me to take
  any part in personal conflicts, and I am loath to be mixed up in such
  disturbances. Nevertheless, I do not like to stand by, and see outrage
  done."</p>

  <p>"Concern yourself no more about me, worthy Sir," interrupted Jocelyn.
  "Perhaps I shall not be molested, and if I should be, I am well able to take
  care of myself. Let those who assail me bear the consequences."</p>

  <p>But John Wolfe still lingered. "If some of my apprentices were only here,"
  he said, "and especially that riotous rogue, Dick Taverner, something might
  be done to help you effectually.&mdash;Ha! what is that uproar?" as a
  tumultuous noise, mixed with the cries of "Clubs!&mdash;Clubs!" was heard
  without, coming from the direction of the wharf. "As I live! the 'prentices
  <i>are</i> out, and engaged in some mischievous work, and it will be strange
  if Dick Taverner be not among them. I will see what they are about." And as
  he spoke he hurried to the oriel window which looked out upon the wharf,
  exclaiming&mdash;"Ay, ay,&mdash;'t is as I thought. Dick <i>is</i>among them,
  and at their head. 'Fore heaven! they are attacking those ruffianly braggarts
  from Whitefriars, and are laying about them lustily with their cudgels. Ha!
  what is this I see? The Alsatians and the myrmidons are routed, and the brave
  lads have captured Sir Francis Mitchell. What are they about to do with him?
  I must go forth and see."</p>

  <p>His purpose, however, was prevented by a sudden movement on the part of
  Sir Giles and his attendants. They came in the direction of Jocelyn
  Mounchensey, with the evident intention of seizing the young man. Jocelyn
  instantly sprang to his feet, drew his sword, and put himself in a posture of
  defence. The myrmidons prepared to beat down the young man's blade with their
  halberds, and secure him, when Jocelyn's cloak was plucked from behind, and
  he heard Madame Bonaventure's voice exclaim&mdash;"Come this
  way!&mdash;follow me instantly!"</p>

  <p>Thus enjoined, he dashed through the door, which was instantly fastened,
  as soon as he had made good his retreat.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-12"
     name="ch1-12">CHAPTER XII.<br>
  The Arrest and the Rescue.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Lupo Vulp had endeavoured to dissuade Sir Giles from putting
  his design of arresting Jocelyn into immediate execution; alleging the great
  risk he would incur, as well from the resolute character of the young man
  himself, who was certain to offer determined resistance, as from the temper
  of the company, which, being decidedly adverse to any such step, might
  occasion a disturbance that would probably result in the prisoner's
  rescue.</p>

  <p>"In any case, Sir Giles," said the wily scrivener, "let me counsel you to
  tarry till the greater part of the guests be gone, and the assemblage outside
  dispersed; for I noted many turbulent 'prentices among the mob, who are sure
  to be troublesome."</p>

  <p>"Since the young man shows no present disposition to quit the house," Sir
  Giles replied, looking askance at Jocelyn, who just then had moved to another
  part of the room with Madame Bonaventure, "there is no urgency; and it may be
  prudent to pause a few moments, as you suggest, good Lupo. But I will not
  suffer him to depart. I perceive, from her gestures and glances, that our
  tricksy hostess is plotting some scheme with him. Plot away, fair mistress;
  you must have more cunning than I give you credit for, if you outwit me a
  second time in the same day. I can guess what she proposes. You note that
  side door near them, Lupo? She is advising the youth's flight that way; and
  he, like a hair-brained fool, will not listen to the suggestion. But it will
  be well to watch the outlet. Hark ye, Lanyere," he added to the promoter,
  "take three men with you, and go round quickly to the passage with which yon
  door communicates. Station yourselves near the outlet; and if Mounchensey
  comes forth, arrest him instantly. You see the door I mean? About it,
  quick!"</p>

  <p>And Lanyere instantly departed with three of the myrmidons.</p>

  <p>"I would this arrest could be lawfully effected, Sir Giles," said Lupo
  Vulp, "by a serjeant-at-arms or pursuivant. There would then be no risk.
  Again I venture to counsel you to proceed regularly. No great delay would be
  occasioned, if your worship went to Westminster, and made a complaint against
  the young man before the Council. In that case a messenger of the Court would
  be despatched to attach his person; and even if he should quit the house in
  the meanwhile, Lanyere will keep on his track. That were the surest course.
  As to the manner of proceeding, I conclude it will be by <i>Ore tenus</i>. It
  is not likely that this youth's headstrong temper, coupled with his fantastic
  notions of honour, will permit him to deny your worship's accusation, and
  therefore his confession being written down, and subscribed by himself, will
  be exhibited against him when he is brought to the bar of the Star-Chamber,
  and he will be judged <i>ex ore suo</i>. Your worship will make quick work of
  it."</p>

  <p>"<i>Cum confitente reo citius est agendum</i>" replied Sir Giles. "No one
  knows better than thou, good Lupo, how promptly and effectually the court of
  Star-Chamber will vindicate its authority, and how severely it will punish
  those who derogate from its dignity. No part of the sentence shall be
  remitted with my consent. This insolent youth shall suffer to the same extent
  as Lanyere. Pilloried, branded, mutilated, degraded, he shall serve as a
  warning to my enemies."</p>

  <p>"Your worship can scarce make him more of a scarecrow than you have made
  of Lanyere," Lupo remarked with a grin. "But do you decide on applying in the
  first instance to the Council?"</p>

  <p>"No," Sir Giles replied, "I will not lose sight of him. He shall not have
  a chance of escape. Marked you not, Lupo, how the rash fool committed himself
  with Buckingham? And think you the proud Marquis would hold me blameless, if,
  by accident, he should get off scot-free, after such an outrage? But see! the
  room is well-nigh cleared. Only a few loiterers remain. The time is
  come."</p>

  <p>And he was about to order the attack, when the disturbance outside reached
  his ears, and checked him for a moment. Sir Giles was considering what could
  be the cause of the tumult, and hesitating whether to go forth and support
  Sir Francis, in case he stood in need of assistance, when the discomfited
  myrmidons rushed into the room. A few words sufficed to explain what had
  occurred, and indeed the bloody visages of some of the men showed how roughly
  they had been handled. Though greatly exasperated, Sir Giles was determined
  not to be baulked of his prey; and fearing Jocelyn might escape in the
  confusion, which an attack upon the 'prentices would occasion, he gave the
  word for his instant seizure, and rushed towards him, as before related. How
  he was baffled has already been told. His wrath knew no bounds when the young
  man disappeared. He hurled himself furiously against the door, but it
  resisted all his efforts to burst it open. Suddenly the bolt was withdrawn,
  and Clement Lanyere and his men stood before him.</p>

  <p>"Have you secured him?" Sir Giles demanded, trying to descry the fugitive
  among them. "Death and fiends! you have not let him escape?"</p>

  <p>"No one has passed us, except Madame Bonaventure," the promoter replied.
  "She was wholly unattended, and came in this direction. We were stationed
  within yon anti-chamber, which appears to be the sole means of communication
  with this passage, and we ought therefore to have intercepted the young man
  when he came forth."</p>

  <p>"You were not wont to be thus short-sighted, Lanyere. There must be some
  other mode of exit, which you have failed to discover," Sir Giles cried
  furiously. "Ha! here it is!" he exclaimed, dashing aside a piece of tapestry
  that seemed merely hung against the wall, but in reality concealed a short
  flight of steps. "Purblind dolts that you are, not to find this out. You
  shall answer for your negligence hereafter, if we take him not."</p>

  <p>And, accompanied by the troop, he hurried down the steps, which brought
  him to a lower room, communicating on one hand with a small court, and, on
  the other, with the kitchen and offices attached to the tavern. Directing
  Lanyere to search the latter, Sir Giles rushed into the court, and uttered a
  shout of savage joy on perceiving Jocelyn, sword in hand, scaling a wall
  which separated the court from the bowling-green.</p>

  <p>Some difficulty, it appeared, had occurred to the hostess in forcing open
  a private door in the yard leading to the green, which being rarely used (for
  the principal entrance was situated elsewhere), its fastenings were rusty,
  and refused to act. This delay favoured the pursuers; and on hearing their
  approach, Jocelyn strove to effect his retreat in the manner described.</p>

  <p>But Sir Giles was further served, though unintentionally, by Madame
  Bonaventure, who succeeded in drawing back the rusty bolt at the very moment
  he came up; and no impediment now existing, the knight thrust her rudely
  aside, and sprang through the doorway just as Jocelyn leaped from the
  wall.</p>

  <p>Disregarding Sir Giles's summons to surrender, the young man hurried on
  till he reached the middle of the bowling-green, where, finding flight
  impossible, as there was no apparent outlet at the further end of the garden,
  while it was certain that the tipstaves would pluck him from the wall with
  their hooks if he attempted to clamber over it, he turned, and stood upon his
  defence.</p>

  <p>Willing to have the credit of disarming him unaided, and confident in his
  own superior strength and skill, Sir Giles signed to his myrmidons to stand
  back, while he alone advanced towards the young man. A turn in his strong
  wrist would, he imagined, suffice to accomplish his purpose. But he found out
  his error the moment he engaged with his opponent. In dexterity and force the
  latter was fully his match, while in nimbleness of body Jocelyn surpassed
  him. The deadly glances thrown at him by the young man showed that the
  animosity of the latter would only be satisfied with blood. Changing his
  purpose, therefore, Sir Giles, in place of attempting to cross his
  antagonist's sword, rapidly disengaged his point, and delivered a stoccata,
  or in modern terms of fence, a thrust in carte, over the arm, which was
  instantly parried. For some minutes the conflict continued without material
  success on either side. Holding his rapier short, with the point towards his
  adversary's face, Jocelyn retreated a few paces at first, but then, charging
  in turn, speedily won back his ground. Stoccatas, imbroccatas, drittas,
  mandrittas, and riversas were exchanged between them in a manner that
  delighted the myrmidons, most of whom were amateurs of sword-play. Infuriated
  by the unexpected resistance he encountered, Sir Giles, at length, resolved
  to terminate the fight; and, finding his antagonist constantly upon some sure
  ward, endeavoured to reach him with a half incartata; but instantly shifting
  his body with marvellous dexterity, Jocelyn struck down the other's blade,
  and replied with a straight thrust, which must infallibly have taken effect,
  if his rapier had not been beaten from his grasp by Clement Lanyere at the
  very moment it touched his adversary's breast. At the same time the young
  man's arms were grasped from behind by two of the myrmidons, and he lay at
  his enemy's disposal.</p>

  <p>Sir Giles, however, sheathed his rapier, saying, with a grim smile, "that
  he did not mean to deprive himself of the satisfaction of seeing his foe
  stand in the pillory, and submit to the sworn torturer's knife;" adding, "it
  was somewhat strange that one who could guard his body so well, should keep
  such indifferent watch over his tongue."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn made no reply to the sarcasm, and the knight was preparing to
  depart with his followers, when a loud and tumultuous uproar proclaimed the
  approach of the apprentices. The posse of victorious youths made their way to
  the bowling-green by the principal entrance, situated, as before mentioned,
  at a different point from the door by which the others had gained it. More
  apprehensive of losing his prisoner, than concerned for his personal safety
  (for though the aggressive party greatly exceeded his own in numbers, he knew
  well how to deal with them, being accustomed to such encounters), Sir Giles
  gave some orders respecting Jocelyn to Clement Lanyere, and then prepared to
  resist the onslaught, by causing his band to form a solid square; those armed
  with bills and staves being placed in the foremost ranks. This disposition
  being quickly made, he drew his sword, and in a loud authoritative tone
  commanded the apprentices to stand back. Such was the effect produced by his
  voice, and the terrors of his countenance, which seldom failed to strike awe
  into beholders, that the intending rescuers came to a halt, and showed some
  hesitation in engaging him.</p>

  <p>"What means this disturbance?" thundered Sir Giles; "and why do you offer
  to molest me in the execution of my duty? Know you not that assemblages like
  yours are unlawful, and that you are liable to severe punishment, unless you
  immediately disperse yourselves, and peaceably depart to your own
  habitations? About your business, I say, and trouble me no longer! But first,
  I command you to deliver up your ringleaders, and especially those who, as I
  am told, have perpetrated the gross outrage and violence upon the person of
  Sir Francis Mitchell. An example shall be made of them."</p>

  <p>"You waste your breath, Sir Giles, and your big words will avail you
  nothing with us," Dick Taverner replied. "Now hear me in return. We, the bold
  and loyal 'prentices of London, who serve our masters and our masters'
  master, the king's highness, well and truly, will not allow an unlawful
  arrest to be made by you or by any other man. And we command you peaceably to
  deliver up your prisoner to us; or, by the rood! we will take him forcibly
  from your hands!"</p>

  <p>"Out, insolent fellow!" cried Sir Giles; "thou wilt alter thy tune when
  thou art scourged at the cart's-tail."</p>

  <p>"You must catch me first, Sir Giles," replied Dick; "and two words will go
  to that. We have read Sir Francis Mitchell a lesson he is not likely to
  forget; and we will read you one, an you provoke us. We have a few old scores
  to wipe off."</p>

  <p>"Ay, marry! have we," cried an embroiderer's apprentice; "these
  extortioners have ruined my master's trade by their gold-and-silver-thread
  monopoly."</p>

  <p>"Hundreds of worthy men have been thrown out of employment by their
  practices," said a vintner's 'prentice. "We sell not half the wine we used to
  do. And no wonder! seeing two-thirds of the inns in London are shut up."</p>

  <p>"The brewers will be all ruined," said a burly 'prentice, with a wooden
  shovel over his shoulder; "since every day a fresh ale-house is closed; and
  no new licences are granted. Murrain seize all such monopolists! They are
  worse than the fly in hops, or smut in barley."</p>

  <p>"Ay, plague take 'em!" exclaimed Dick Taverner. "They are as bad as the
  locusts of Egypt. When they have devoured the substance of one set of
  tradesfolk they will commence upon that of another. No one is safe from them.
  It will be your turn next, Master Mercer. Yours after him, Master Ironmonger,
  however hard of digestion may be your wares. You will come third, Master
  Fishmonger. You fourth, Master Grocer. And when they are surfeited with
  spiceries and fish, they will fall upon you, tooth and nail, Master
  Goldsmith."</p>

  <p>"I trow not," cried the apprentice last appealed to. "Our masters are too
  rich and too powerful to submit to such usage."</p>

  <p>"The very reason they will undergo it," replied Dick. "Their riches are
  only a temptation to plunder. I repeat, no man is safe from these
  extortioners. Since the law will not give us redress, and put them down, we
  must take the law into our own hands. They shall have Club Law."</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay&mdash;'Prentices' law&mdash;Club law!" chorussed the others.</p>

  <p>"Sir Giles will make a Star-Chamber matter of it. He will have us up
  before the Council," laughed the goldsmith's 'prentice.</p>

  <p>"He will buy a monopoly of cudgels to deprive us of their use," cried a
  bowyer.</p>

  <p>"We will bestow that patent upon him gratis," quoth Dick, making his staff
  whistle round his head.</p>

  <p>"The prisoner!&mdash;gentlemen 'prentices&mdash;do not forget him!" cried
  Cyprien, who, with two other serving-men and the cook, had joined the
  assailing party. "Madame Bonaventure implores you to effect his rescue."</p>

  <p>"And so we will, my jovial Gascon," replied Dick. "Come, Sir Giles! are we
  to have the young gentleman from you by force or free-will?"</p>

  <p>"You shall have him in neither way, sirrah," the knight rejoined. "You,
  yourself, shall bear him company in the Fleet. Upon them, my men, and make
  for the door!"</p>

  <p>And as the command was given, he and his troop made a sudden dash upon the
  'prentices, who, unable to stand against the bills levelled against their
  breasts, gave way. Still, the gallant youths were by no means routed.
  Instantly closing upon their opponents, and being quite as nimble of foot as
  they, they contrived to cut off their retreat from the garden; and a sharp
  conflict took place between the parties, as they came to close quarters near
  the entrance. Three of the myrmidons were felled by Dick Taverner's cudgel;
  and at last, watching his opportunity, with both hands he launched a bowl
  which he had picked up at Sir Giles's head. If the missile had taken effect,
  the fight would have been over; but the knight avoided the blow by stooping
  down, and the bowl, passing over him, hit Lupo Vulp full in the stomach, and
  brought him to the ground deprived of breath. Meanwhile, Sir Giles, springing
  quickly forward, pinned the apprentice against the wall with his rapier's
  point.</p>

  <p>"I have thee at last, knave," he cried, seizing Dick by the collar, and
  delivering him to the custody of the myrmidons nearest him&mdash;"I told thee
  thou should'st visit the Fleet. And so thou shalt."</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the capture of their leader, the 'prentices fought
  manfully, and it still appeared doubtful whether Sir Giles would be able to
  effect a retreat after all, embarrassed as he now was with two prisoners.
  Under these circumstances he made a sign to Clement Lanyere to withdraw with
  Jocelyn through the other door, ordering the two myrmidons who had charge of
  Dick Taverner to follow him with their captive.</p>

  <p>It was no easy task to carry out the order; but the promoter managed to
  accomplish it. Single-handed he drove back all who opposed his progress,
  while the two prisoners were borne towards the door by the men having them in
  custody.</p>

  <p>Hitherto Jocelyn had made no attempt at self-liberation; awaiting,
  probably, the result of the 'prentices' efforts in his behalf, or some more
  favourable opportunity than had hitherto presented itself. On reaching the
  little court the time for exertion seemed to be come. Shaking off the
  myrmidons who pinioned him, and seizing a bill from one of them, he instantly
  stretched the fellow at his feet, and drove off his comrade. This done, he
  lent immediate assistance to Dick Taverner, setting him free, and arming him
  with as much promptitude as he had used to effect his own deliverance.</p>

  <p>While thus engaged, he received no interruption from Clement Lanyere,
  though, if he had chosen, the promoter might no doubt have effectually
  opposed him. But Lanyere either was, or feigned to be, engaged with some
  skirmishers at the door; and it was only when both the prisoners had got
  free, that he rushed towards them, loudly reprehending the men for their
  carelessness. But if they were to blame, he was no less so, for he showed
  little address in following the fugitives, and managed to take a wrong turn
  in the passage, which led both him and the myrmidons astray, so that the
  prisoners got clear off.</p>

  <p>How Jocelyn and Dick Taverner contrived to reach the Vintry Wharf, neither
  of them very distinctly knew,&mdash;such was the hurried manner in which they
  passed through the tavern; but there they were, precisely at the moment that
  Sir Giles Mompesson, having fought his way through all opposition, issued
  from the porch at the head of his band.</p>

  <p>Quite satisfied with his previous encounter with the redoubtable knight,
  and anxious to escape before his evasion should he discovered, Dick beckoned
  to his companion, and, making all the haste they could to the stairs, they
  both jumped into the nearest wherry, when the apprentice ordered the two
  watermen within it to row for their lives to London-bridge.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-13"
     name="ch1-13">CHAPTER XIII.<br>
  How Jocelyn Mounchensey encountered<br>
  a masked horseman on Stamford Hill.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Two days after the events last recorded, a horseman,
  followed at a respectful distance by a mounted attendant, took his way up
  Stamford Hill. He was young, and of singularly prepossessing appearance, with
  a countenance full of fire and spirit, and blooming with health, and it was
  easy to see that his life had been passed in the country, and in constant
  manly exercise; for though he managed his horse&mdash;a powerful bay
  charger&mdash;to perfection, there was nothing of the town gallant, or of the
  soldier, about him. His doublet and cloak were of a plain dark material, and
  had seen service; but they well became his fine symmetrical figure, as did
  the buff boots defending his well-made, vigorous limbs. Better seat in
  saddle, or lighter hand with bridle, no man could possess than he; and his
  noble steed, which like himself was full of courage and ardour, responded to
  all his movements, and obeyed the slightest indication of his will. His arms
  were rapier and dagger; and his broad-leaved hat, ornamented with a black
  feather, covered the luxuriant brown locks that fell in long ringlets over
  his shoulders. So <i>débonnair</i> was the young horseman in deportment, so
  graceful in figure, and so comely in looks, that he had excited no little
  admiration as he rode forth at an early hour that morning from Bishopgate
  Street, and passing under the wide portal in the old city walls, speeded
  towards the then rural district of Shoreditch, leaving Old Bedlam and its
  saddening associations on the right, and Finsbury Fields, with its gardens,
  dog-houses, and windmills, on the left. At the end of
  Bishopgate-Street-Without a considerable crowd was collected round a party of
  comely young milkmaids, who were executing a lively and characteristic dance
  to the accompaniment of a bagpipe and fiddle. Instead of carrying pails as
  was their wont, these milkmaids, who were all very neatly attired, bore on
  their heads a pile of silver plate, borrowed for the occasion, arranged like
  a pyramid, and adorned with ribands and flowers. In this way they visited all
  their customers and danced before their doors. A pretty usage then observed
  in the environs of the metropolis in the month of May. The merry milkmaids
  set up a joyous shout as the youth rode by; and many a bright eye followed
  his gallant figure till it disappeared. At the Conduit beyond Shoreditch, a
  pack of young girls, who were drawing water, suspended their task to look
  after him; and so did every buxom country lass he encountered, whether seated
  in tilted cart, or on a pillion behind her sturdy sire. To each salutation
  addressed to him the young man cordially replied, in a voice blithe as his
  looks; and in some cases, where the greeting was given by an elderly
  personage, or a cap was respectfully doffed to him, he uncovered his own
  proud head, and displayed his handsome features yet more fully.</p>

  <p>So much for the master: now for the man. In his own opinion, at
  least&mdash;for he was by no means deficient in self-conceit&mdash;the latter
  came in for an equal share of admiration; and certes, if impudence could help
  him to win it, he lacked not the recommendation. Staring most of the girls
  out of countenance, he leered at some of them so offensively, that their male
  companions shook their fists or whips at him, and sometimes launched a stone
  at his head. Equally free was he in the use of his tongue; and his jests were
  so scurrilous and so little relished by those to whom they were addressed,
  that it was, perhaps, well for him, in some instances, that the speed at
  which he rode soon carried him out of harm's reach. The knave was not
  ill-favoured; being young, supple of limb, olive-complexioned, black-eyed,
  saucy, roguish-looking, with a turned-up nose, and extremely white teeth. He
  wore no livery, and indeed his attire was rather that of a citizen's
  apprentice than such as beseemed a gentleman's lacquey. He was well mounted
  on a stout sorrel horse; but though the animal was tractable enough, and easy
  in its paces, he experienced considerable difficulty in maintaining his seat
  on its back.</p>

  <p>In this way, Jocelyn Mounchensey and Dick Taverner (for the reader will
  have had no difficulty in recognising the pair) arrived at Stamford Hill; and
  the former, drawing in the rein, proceeded slowly up the gentle ascent.</p>

  <p>It was one of those delicious spring mornings, when all nature seems to
  rejoice; when the newly-opened leaves are greenest and freshest; when the
  lark springs blithest from the verdant mead, and soars nearest heaven; when a
  thousand other feathered choristers warble forth their notes in copse and
  hedge; when the rooks caw mellowly near their nests in the lofty trees; when
  gentle showers, having fallen overnight, have kindly prepared the earth for
  the morrow's genial warmth and sunshine; when that sunshine, each moment,
  calls some new object into life and beauty; when all you look upon is
  pleasant to the eye, all you listen to is delightful to the ear;&mdash;in
  short, it was one of those exquisite mornings, only to be met with in the
  merry month of May, and only to be experienced in full perfection in Merry
  England.</p>

  <p>Arrived at the summit of the hill, commanding such extensively charming
  views, Jocelyn halted and looked back with wonder at the vast and populous
  city he had just quitted, now spread out before him in all its splendour and
  beauty. In his eyes it seemed already over-grown, though it had not attained
  a tithe of its present proportions; but he could only judge according to his
  opportunity, and was unable to foresee its future magnitude. But if London
  has waxed in size, wealth, and population during the last two centuries and
  a-half, it has lost nearly all the peculiar features of beauty which
  distinguished it up to that time, and made it so attractive to Jocelyn's
  eyes. The diversified and picturesque architecture of its ancient
  habitations, as yet undisturbed by the innovations of the Italian and Dutch
  schools, and brought to full perfection in the latter part of the reign of
  Elizabeth, gave the whole city a characteristic and fanciful appearance. Old
  towers, old belfries, old crosses, slender spires innumerable, rose up amid a
  world of quaint gables and angular roofs. Story above story sprang those
  curious dwellings; irregular yet homogeneous; dear to the painter's and the
  poet's eye; elaborate in ornament; grotesque in design; well suited to the
  climate, and admirably adapted to the wants and comforts of the inhabitants;
  picturesque like the age itself, like its costume, its manners, its
  literature. All these characteristic beauties and peculiarities are now
  utterly gone. All the old picturesque habitations have been devoured by fire,
  and a New City has risen in their stead;&mdash;not to compare with the Old
  City, though&mdash;and conveying no notion whatever of it&mdash;any more than
  you or I, worthy reader, in our formal, and, I grieve to say it,
  ill-contrived attire, resemble the picturesque-looking denizens of London,
  clad in doublet, mantle, and hose, in the time of James the First.</p>

  <p>Another advantage in those days must not be forgotten. The canopy of smoke
  overhanging the vast Modern Babel, and oftentimes obscuring even the light of
  the sun itself, did not dim the beauties of the Ancient City,&mdash;sea coal
  being but little used in comparison with wood, of which there was then
  abundance, as at this time in the capital of France. Thus the atmosphere was
  clearer and lighter, and served as a finer medium to reveal objects which
  would now be lost at a quarter the distance.</p>

  <p>Fair, sparkling, and clearly defined, then, rose up Old London before
  Jocelyn's gaze. Girded round with gray walls, defended by battlements, and
  approached by lofty gates, four of which&mdash;to wit, Cripplegate, Moorgate,
  Bishopgate, and Aldgate&mdash;were visible from where he stood; it riveted
  attention from its immense congregation of roofs, spires, pinnacles, and
  vanes, all glittering in the sunshine; while in the midst of all, and
  pre-eminent above all, towered one gigantic pile&mdash;the glorious Gothic
  cathedral. Far on the east, and beyond the city walls, though surrounded by
  its own mural defences, was seen the frowning Tower of London&mdash;part
  fortress and part prison&mdash;a structure never viewed in those days without
  terror, being the scene of so many passing tragedies. Looking westward, and
  rapidly surveying the gardens and pleasant suburban villages lying on the
  north of the Strand, the young man's gaze settled for a moment on Charing
  Cross&mdash;the elaborately-carved memorial to his Queen, Eleanor, erected by
  Edward I.&mdash;and then ranging over the palace of Whitehall and its two
  gates, Westminster Abbey&mdash;more beautiful without its towers than with
  them&mdash;it became fixed upon Westminster Hall; for there, in one of its
  chambers, the ceiling of which was adorned with gilded stars, were held the
  councils of that terrible tribunal which had robbed him of his inheritance,
  and now threatened him with deprivation of liberty, and mutilation of person.
  A shudder crossed him as he thought of the Star-Chamber, and he turned his
  gaze elsewhere, trying to bring the whole glorious city within his ken.</p>

  <p>A splendid view, indeed! Well might King James himself exclaim when
  standing, not many years previously, on the very spot where Jocelyn now
  stood, and looking upon London for the first time since his accession to the
  throne of England&mdash;well might he exclaim in rapturous accents, as he
  gazed on the magnificence of his capital&mdash;"At last the richest jewel in
  a monarch's crown is mine!"</p>

  <p>After satiating himself with this, to him, novel and wonderful prospect,
  Jocelyn began to bestow his attention on objects closer at hand, and examined
  the landscapes on either side of the eminence, which, without offering any
  features of extraordinary beauty, were generally pleasing, and exercised a
  soothing influence upon his mind. At that time Stamford Hill was crowned with
  a grove of trees, and its eastern declivity was overgrown with brushwood. The
  whole country, on the Essex side, was more or less marshy, until Epping
  Forest, some three miles off, was reached. Through a swampy vale on the left,
  the river Lea, so dear to the angler, took its slow and silent course; while
  through a green valley on the right, flowed the New River, then only just
  opened. Pointing out the latter channel to Jocelyn, Dick Taverner, who had
  now come up, informed him that he was present at the completion of that
  important undertaking. And a famous sight it was, the apprentice said. The
  Lord Mayor of London, the Aldermen, and the Recorder were all present in
  their robes and gowns to watch the floodgate opened, which was to pour the
  stream that had run from Amwell Head into the great cistern near Islington.
  And this was done amidst deafening cheers and the thunder of ordnance.</p>

  <p>"A proud day it was for Sir Hugh Myddleton," Dick added; "and some reward
  for his perseverance through difficulties and disappointments."</p>

  <p>"It is to be hoped the good gentleman has obtained more substantial reward
  than that," Jocelyn replied. "He has conferred an inestimable boon upon his
  fellow-citizens, and is entitled to their gratitude for it."</p>

  <p>"As to gratitude on the part of the citizens, I can't say much for that,
  Sir. And it is not every man that meets with his desserts, or we know where
  our friends Sir Giles Mompesson and Sir Francis Mitchell would be. The good
  cits are content to drink the pure water of the New River, without bestowing
  a thought on him who has brought it to their doors. Meantime, the work has
  well-nigh beggared Sir Hugh Myddleton, and he is likely to obtain little
  recompense beyond what the consciousness of his own beneficent act will
  afford him."</p>

  <p>"But will not the King requite him?" Jocelyn asked.</p>

  <p>"The King <i>has</i> requited him with a title," Dick returned. "A title,
  however, which may be purchased at a less price than good Sir Hugh has paid
  for it, now-a-days. But it must be owned, to our sovereign's credit, that he
  did far more than the citizens of London would do; since when they refused to
  assist Master Myddleton (as he then was) in his most useful work, King James
  undertook, and bound himself by indenture under the great seal, to pay half
  the expenses. Without this, it would probably never have been
  accomplished."</p>

  <p>"I trust it may be profitable to Sir Hugh in the end," Jocelyn said; "and
  if not, he will reap his reward hereafter."</p>

  <p>"It is not unlikely we may encounter him, as he now dwells near Edmonton,
  and is frequently on the road," Dick said; "and if so, I will point him out
  to you, I have some slight acquaintance with him, having often served him in
  my master's shop in Paul's Churchyard. Talking of Edmonton, with your
  permission, Sir, we will break our fast at the Bell,[1] where I am known, and
  where you will be well served. The host is a jovial fellow and trusty, and
  may give us information which will be useful before we proceed on our
  perilous expedition to Theobalds."</p>

  <p>"I care not how soon we arrive there," Jocelyn cried; "for the morning has
  so quickened my appetite, that the bare idea of thy host's good cheer makes
  all delay in attacking it unsupportable."</p>

  <p>"I am entirely of your opinion, Sir," Dick said, smacking his lips. "At
  the Bell at Edmonton we are sure of fresh fish from the Lea, fresh eggs from
  the farm-yard, and stout ale from the cellar; and if these three things do
  not constitute a good breakfast, I know not what others do. So let us be
  jogging onwards. We have barely two miles to ride. Five minutes to Tottenham;
  ten to Edmonton; 'tis done!"</p>

  <p>It was not, however, accomplished quite so soon as Dick anticipated. Ere
  fifty yards were traversed, they were brought to a stop by an unlooked-for
  incident.</p>

  <p>Suddenly emerging from a thick covert of wood, which had concealed him
  from view, a horseman planted himself directly in their path; ordering them
  in a loud, authoritative voice, to stand; and enforcing attention to the
  injunction by levelling a caliver at Jocelyn's head.</p>

  <p>The appearance of this personage was as mysterious as formidable. The
  upper part of his features was concealed by a black mask. His habiliments
  were sable; and the colour of his powerful steed was sable likewise. Boots,
  cap, cloak, and feather, were all of the same dusky hue. His frame was
  strongly built, and besides the caliver he was armed with sword and poniard.
  Altogether, he constituted an unpleasant obstacle in the way.</p>

  <p>Dick Taverner was not able to render much assistance on the occasion. The
  suddenness with which the masked horseman burst forth upon them scared his
  horse; and the animal becoming unmanageable, began to rear, and finally threw
  its rider to the ground&mdash;luckily without doing him much damage.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the horseman, lowering his caliver, thus addressed Jocelyn, who,
  taking him for a robber, was prepared to resist the attack.</p>

  <p>"You are mistaken in me, Master Jocelyn Mounchensey," he said; "I have no
  design upon your purse. I call upon you to surrender yourself my
  prisoner."</p>

  <p>"Never, with life," the young man replied. "In spite of your disguise, I
  recognise you as one of Sir Giles Mompesson's myrmidons; and you may conclude
  from our former encounter, whether my resistance will be determined or
  not."</p>

  <p>"You had not escaped on that occasion, but for my connivance, Master
  Jocelyn," the man in the mask rejoined. "Now, hear me. I am willing to
  befriend you on certain conditions; and, to prove my sincerity, I engage you
  shall go free if you accept them."</p>

  <p>"I do not feel disposed to make any terms with you," Jocelyn said sternly;
  "and as to my freedom of departure, I will take care that it is not
  hindered."</p>

  <p>"I hold a warrant from the Star-Chamber for your arrest," said the man in
  the mask; "and you will vainly offer resistance if I choose to execute it.
  Let this be well understood before I proceed. And now to show you the extent
  of my information concerning you, and that I am fully aware of your
  proceedings, I will relate to you what you have done since you fled with that
  froward apprentice, whose tricks will assuredly bring him to Bridewell, from
  the Three Cranes. You were landed at London Bridge, and went thence with your
  companion to the Rose at Newington Butts, where you lay that night, and
  remained concealed, as you fancied, during the whole of the next day. I say,
  you fancied your retreat was unknown, because I was aware of it, and could
  have seized you had I been so disposed. The next night you removed to the
  Crown in Bishopgate Street, and as you did not care to return to your
  lodgings near Saint Botolph's Church without Aldgate, you privily despatched
  Dick Taverner to bring your horses from the Falcon in Gracechurch Street,
  where you had left them, with the foolhardy intention of setting forth this
  morning to Theobalds, to try and obtain an interview of the King."</p>

  <p>"You have spoken the truth," Jocelyn replied in amazement; "but if you
  designed to arrest me, and could have done so, why did you defer your
  purpose?"</p>

  <p>"Question me not on that point. Some day or other I may satisfy you. Not
  now. Enough that I have conceived a regard for you, and will not harm you,
  unless compelled to do so by self-defence. Nay more, I will serve you. You
  must not go to Theobalds. 'Tis a mad scheme, conceived by a hot brain, and
  will bring destruction upon you. If you persist in it, I must follow you
  thither, and prevent greater mischief."</p>

  <p>"Follow me, then, if you list," Jocelyn cried; "for go I shall. But be
  assured I will liberate myself from you if I can."</p>

  <p>"Go, hot-headed boy," the man in the mask rejoined, but he then added
  quickly; "yet no!&mdash;I will not deliver you thus to the power of your
  enemies, without a further effort to save you. Since you are resolved to go
  to Theobalds you must have a protector&mdash;a protector able to shield you
  even from Buckingham, whose enmity you have reason to dread. There is only
  one person who can do this, and that is Count Gondomar, the Spanish
  lieger-ambassador. Luckily, he is with the King now. In place of making any
  idle attempts to obtain an interview of his Majesty, or forcing yourself
  unauthorised on the royal presence, which will end in your arrest by the
  Knight Marshall, seek out Count Gondomar, and deliver this token to him. Tell
  him your story; and do what he bids you."</p>

  <p>And as he spoke the man in the mask held forth a ring, which Jocelyn
  took.</p>

  <p>"I intended to make certain conditions with you," the mysterious personage
  pursued, "for the service I should render you, but you have thwarted my plans
  by your obstinacy, and I must reserve them to our next meeting. For we
  <i>shall</i> meet again, and that ere long; and then when you tender your
  thanks for what I have now done, I will tell you how to requite the
  obligation."</p>

  <p>"I swear to requite it if I can&mdash;and as you desire," Jocelyn cried,
  struck by the other's manner.</p>

  <p>"Enough!" the masked personage rejoined. "I am satisfied. Proceed on your
  way, and may good fortune attend you! Your destiny is in your own hands. Obey
  Count Gondomar's behests, and he will aid you effectually."</p>

  <p>And without a word more, the man in the mask struck spurs into his horse's
  sides, and dashed down the hill, at a headlong pace, in the direction of
  London.</p>

  <p>Jocelyn looked after him, and had not recovered from his surprise at the
  singular interview that had taken place when he disappeared.</p>

  <p>By this time, Dick Taverner having regained his feet, limped towards him,
  leading his horse.</p>

  <p>"It must be the Fiend in person," quoth the apprentice, contriving to
  regain the saddle. "I trust you have made no compact with him, Sir."</p>

  <p>"Not a sinful one I hope," Jocelyn replied, glancing at the ring.</p>

  <p>And they proceeded on their way towards Tottenham, and were presently
  saluted by the merry ringing of bells, proclaiming some village festival.</p>

  <p>FOOTNOTES:</p>

  <p>[1] Lest we should be charged with an anachronism, we may mention that the
  Bell at Edmonton, immortalized in the story of John Gilpin, was in good
  repute in the days we treat of, as will appear from the following extract
  from John Savile's Tractate entitled, <i>King James, his Entertainment at
  Theobald's, with his Welcome to London</i>. Having described the vast
  concourse of people that flocked forth to greet their new Sovereign on his
  approach to the metropolis, honest John says&mdash;"After our breakfast at
  Edmonton at the sign of <i>the Bell</i>, we took occasion to note how many
  would come down in the next hour, so coming up into a chamber next to the
  street, where we might both best see, and likewise take notice of all
  passengers, we called for an hour-glass, and after we had disposed of
  ourselves who should take the number of the horse, and who the foot, we
  turned the hour-glass, which before it was half run out, we could not
  possibly truly number them, they came so exceedingly fast; but there we broke
  off, and made our account of 309 horses, and 137 footmen, which course
  continued that day from four o'clock in the morning till three o'clock in the
  afternoon, and the day before also, as the host of the house told us, without
  intermission." Besides establishing the existence of the renowned
  <i>Bell</i>at this period, the foregoing passage is curious in other
  respects.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-14"
     name="ch1-14">CHAPTER XIV.<br>
  The May-Queen and the Puritan's Daughter.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Popular sports and pastimes were wisely encouraged by James
  the First, whose great consideration for the enjoyments of the humbler
  classes of his subjects cannot be too highly commended; and since the main
  purpose of this history is to point out some of the abuses prevalent during
  his reign, it is but fair that at least one of the redeeming features should
  be mentioned. It has ever been the practice of sour-spirited sectarianism to
  discountenance recreations of any kind, however harmless, on the Sabbath; and
  several flagrant instances of this sort of interference, on the part of the
  puritanical preachers and their disciples, having come before James during
  his progress through the northern counties of England, and especially
  Lancashire, he caused, on his return to London, his famous Declaration
  concerning Lawful Sports on Sundays and holidays to be promulgated; wherein a
  severe rebuke was administered to the Puritans and precisians, and the cause
  of the people espoused in terms, which, while most creditable to the monarch,
  are not altogether inapplicable to other times besides those in which they
  were delivered. "Whereas," says King James, in his Manifesto, "We did justly
  rebuke some Puritans and precise people, and took order that the like
  unlawful carriage should not be used by any of them hereafter, in the
  prohibiting and unlawful punishing of our good people for using their lawful
  recreations and honest exercises upon Sundays and other holidays, after the
  afternoon sermon or service: we now find that two sorts of people wherewith
  that country is much infested (we mean Papists and Puritans) have maliciously
  traduced those our just and honourable proceedings. And therefore we have
  thought good hereby to clear and make our pleasure to be manifested to all
  our good people in those parts." And he sums up his arguments, in favour of
  the license granted, as follows:&mdash;"For when shall the common people have
  leave to exercise, if not upon the Sundays and holidays, seeing they must
  apply their labour, and win their living in all working days?" Truly, an
  unanswerable proposition.</p>

  <p>At the same time that these provisions for rational recreation were made,
  all unlawful games were prohibited. Conformity was strictly enjoined on the
  part of the Puritans themselves; and disobedience was rendered punishable by
  expatriation, as in the case of recusants generally. Such was the tenor of
  the royal mandate addressed to the bishop of each diocese and to all inferior
  clergy throughout the kingdom. Arbitrary it might be, but it was excellent in
  intention; for stubborn-necked personages had to be dealt with, with whom
  milder measures would have proved ineffectual. As it was, violent opposition
  was raised against the decree, and the Puritanical preachers wore loud in its
  condemnation, and as far as was consistent with safety, vehement in their
  attacks upon its royal author.</p>

  <p>The boon, however, was accepted by the majority of the people in the
  spirit in which it was offered, and the licence afforded them was but little
  abused. Perfect success, indeed, must have attended the benign measure, had
  it not been for the efforts of the Puritanical and Popish parties, who made
  common cause against it, and strove by every means to counteract its
  beneficial influence: the first because in the austerity of their faith they
  would not have the Sabbath in the slightest degree profaned, even by innocent
  enjoyment; the second, not because they cared about the fancied desecration
  of the Lord's day, but because they would have no other religion enjoy the
  same privileges as their own. Thus sectarianism and intolerance went for once
  hand in hand, and openly or covertly, as they found occasion, did their best
  to make the people dissatisfied with the benefit accorded them, trying to
  persuade them its acceptance would prejudice their eternal welfare.</p>

  <p>Such arguments, however, had no great weight with the masses, who could
  not be brought to see any heinous or deadly sin in lawful recreation or
  exercises after divine service, always provided the service itself were in no
  respect neglected; and so the King's decree prevailed over all sectarian
  opposition, and was fully carried out. The merry month of May became really a
  season of enjoyment, and was kept as a kind of floral festival in every
  village throughout the land. May-games, Whitsun-ales, Morrice-dances, were
  renewed as in bygone times; and all robust and healthful sports, as leaping,
  vaulting, and archery, were not only permitted on Sundays by the authorities,
  but enjoined.</p>

  <p>These preliminary remarks are made for the better understanding of what is
  to follow.</p>

  <p>We have already stated that long before Jocelyn and his companion reached
  Tottenham, they were made aware by the ringing of bells from its old
  ivy-grown church tower, and by other joyful sounds, that some festival was
  taking place there; and the nature of the festival was at once revealed, as
  they entered the long straggling street, then, as now, constituting the chief
  part of the pretty little village, and beheld a large assemblage of country
  folk, in holiday attire, wending their way towards the green for the purpose
  of setting up a May-pole upon it, and making the welkin ring with their
  gladsome shouts.</p>

  <p>All the youths and maidens of Tottenham and its vicinity, it appeared, had
  risen before daybreak that morning, and sallied forth into the woods to cut
  green boughs, and gather wild&mdash;flowers, for the ceremonial. At the same
  time they selected and hewed down a tall, straight tree&mdash;the tallest and
  straightest they could find; and, stripping off its branches, placed it on a
  wain, and dragged it to the village with the help of an immense team of oxen,
  numbering as many as forty yoke. Each ox had a garland of flowers fastened to
  the tip of its horns; and the tall spar itself was twined round with ropes of
  daffodils, blue-bells, cowslips, primroses, and other early flowers, while
  its summit was surmounted with a floral crown, and festooned with garlands,
  various-coloured ribands, kerchiefs, and streamers. The foremost yokes of
  oxen had bells hung round their necks, which they shook as they moved along,
  adding their blithe melody to the general hilarious sounds.</p>

  <p>When the festive throng reached the village, all its
  inhabitants&mdash;male and female, old and young&mdash;rushed forth to greet
  them; and such as were able to leave their dwellings for a short while joined
  in the procession, at the head of which, of course, was borne the May-pole.
  After it, came a band of young men, armed with the necessary implements for
  planting the shaft in the ground; and after them a troop of maidens, bearing
  bundles of rushes. Next came the minstrels, playing merrily on tabor, fife,
  sacbut, rebec, and tambourine. Then followed the Queen of the May, walking by
  herself,&mdash;a rustic beauty, hight Gillian Greenford,&mdash;fancifully and
  prettily arrayed for the occasion, and attended, at a little distance, by
  Robin Hood, Maid Marian, Friar Tuck, the Hobby-horse, and a band of
  morrice-dancers. Then came the crowd, pellmell, laughing, shouting, and
  huzzaing,&mdash;most of the young men and women bearing green branches of
  birch and other trees in their hands.</p>

  <p>The spot selected for the May-pole was a piece of green sward in the
  centre of the village, surrounded by picturesque habitations, and having, on
  one side of it, the ancient Cross. The latter, however, was but the remnant
  of the antique structure, the cross having been robbed of its upper angular
  bar, and otherwise mutilated, at the time of the Reformation, and it was now
  nothing more than a high wooden pillar, partly cased with lead to protect it
  from the weather, and supported by four great spurs.</p>

  <p>Arrived at the green, the wain was brought to a halt; the crowd forming a
  vast circle round it, so as not to interfere with the proceedings. The pole
  was then taken out, reared aloft, and so much activity was displayed, so many
  eager hands assisted, that in an inconceivably short space of time it was
  firmly planted in the ground; whence it shot up like the central mast of a
  man-of-war, far overtopping the roofs of the adjoining houses, and looking
  very gay indeed, with its floral crown a-top, and its kerchiefs and streamers
  fluttering in the breeze.</p>

  <p>Loud and reiterated shouts broke from the assemblage on the satisfactory
  completion of the ceremony, the church bells pealed merrily, and the
  minstrels played their most enlivening strains. The rushes were strewn on the
  ground at the foot of the May-pole, and arbours were formed, with marvellous
  celerity, in different parts of the green, with the branches of the trees. At
  the same time, the ancient Cross was decorated with boughs and garlands. The
  whole scene offered as pretty and cheerful a sight as could be desired; but
  there was one beholder, as will presently appear, who viewed it in a
  different light.</p>

  <p>It now came to the Queen of the May's turn to advance to the pole, and
  stationing herself beneath it, the morrice-dancers and the rest of the
  mummers formed a ring round her, and, taking hands, footed it merrily to the
  tune of "Green Sleeves."</p>

  <p>Long before this, Jocelyn and his attendant had come up, and both were so
  much interested that they felt no disposition to depart. Gillian's
  attractions had already fired the inflammable heart of the apprentice, who
  could not withdraw his gaze from her; and so ardent were his looks, and so
  expressive his gestures of admiration, that ere long he succeeded, to his no
  small delight, in attracting her notice in return.</p>

  <p>Gillian Greenford was a bright-eyed, fair-haired young creature; light,
  laughing, radiant; with cheeks soft as peach bloom, and beautifully tinged
  with red, lips carnation-hued, and teeth white as pearls. Her parti-coloured,
  linsey-woolsey petticoats looped up on one side disclosed limbs with no sort
  of rustic clumsiness about them; but, on the contrary, a particularly neat
  formation both of foot and ankle. Her scarlet bodice, which, like the lower
  part of her dress, was decorated with spangles, bugles, and tinsel ornaments
  of various kinds,&mdash;very resplendent in the eyes of the surrounding
  swains, as well as in those of Dick Taverner,&mdash;her bodice, we say,
  spanning a slender waist, was laced across, while the snowy kerchief beneath
  it did not totally conceal a very comely bust. A wreath of natural flowers
  was twined very gracefully within her waving and almost lint-white locks, and
  in her hand she held a shepherdess's crook. Such was the Beauty of Tottenham,
  and the present Queen of the May. Dick Taverner thought her little less than
  angelic, and there were many besides who shared in his opinion.</p>

  <p>If Dick had been thus captivated on the sudden, Jocelyn had not escaped
  similar fascination from another quarter. It befel in this way:</p>

  <p>At an open oriel window, in one of the ancient and picturesque habitations
  before described as facing the green, stood a young maiden, whose beauty was
  of so high an order, and so peculiar a character, that it at once attracted
  and fixed attention. Such, at least, was the effect produced by it on
  Jocelyn. Shrinking from the public gaze, and, perhaps, from some motive
  connected with religious scruples, scarcely deeming it right to be a
  spectator of the passing scene, this fair maiden was so placed as to be
  almost screened from general view. Yet it chanced that Jocelyn, from the
  circumstance of being on horseback, and from his position, was able to
  command a portion of the room in which she stood; and he watched her for some
  minutes before she became aware she was the object of his regards. When, at
  length, she perceived that his gaze was steadily fixed upon her, a deep blush
  suffused her cheeks, and she would have instantly retired, if the young man
  had not at once lowered his looks. Still, he ever and anon ventured a glance
  towards the oriel window, and was delighted to find the maiden still
  there,&mdash;nay, he fancied she must have advanced a step or two, for he
  could unquestionably distinguish her features more plainly. And lovely they
  were&mdash;most lovely! pensive in expression, and perhaps a thought too
  pale, until the crimsoning tide had mounted to her cheek. Thus mantled with
  blushes, her countenance might gain something in beauty, but it lost much of
  the peculiar charm which it derived from extreme transparency and whiteness
  of skin&mdash;a tint which set off to perfection the splendour of her
  magnificent black eyes, with their darkly-fringed lids and brows, while it
  also relieved, in an equal degree, the jetty lustre of her hair. Her features
  were exquisitely chiselled, delicate and classical in mould, and stamped with
  refinement and intelligence. Perfect simplicity, combined with a total
  absence of personal ornament, distinguished her attire; and her raven hair
  was plainly, but by no means unbecomingly, braided over her snowy forehead.
  Something in this simplicity of costume and in her manner inclined Jocelyn to
  think the fair maiden must belong to some family professing Puritanical
  opinions; and he found, upon inquiry from one of his neighbours in the
  throng&mdash;an old farmer&mdash;that this was actually the case.</p>

  <p>The young lady was Mistress Aveline Calveley, his informant said, only
  child of Master Hugh Calveley, who had but lately come to dwell in Tottenham,
  and of whom little was known, save that he was understood to have fought at
  the battle of Langside, and served with great bravery, under Essex, both in
  Spain and in Ireland, in the times of good Queen Bess&mdash;such times as
  England would never see again, the old farmer parenthetically remarked, with
  a shake of the head. Master Hugh Calveley, he went on to say, was a strict
  Puritan, austere in his life, and morose in manner; an open railer against
  the licence of the times, and the profligacy of the court minions,&mdash;in
  consequence of which he had more than once got himself into trouble. He
  abhorred all such sports as were now going forward; and had successfully
  interfered with the parish priest, Sir Onesimus, who was somewhat of a
  precisian himself, to prevent the setting up the May-pole on the past
  Sunday,&mdash;for which, the farmer added, some of the young folks owe him a
  grudge; and he expressed a hope, at the same time, that the day might pass by
  without any exhibition being made of their ill-will towards him.</p>

  <p>"These Puritans are not in favour with our youth," the old man said; "and
  no great marvel they be not; for they check them in their pleasures, and
  reprove them for harmless mirth. Now, as to Mistress Aveline herself, she is
  devout and good; but she takes no part in the enjoyments proper to her years,
  and leads a life more like a nun in a convent, or a recluse in a cell, than a
  marriageable young lady. She never stirs forth without her father, and, as
  you may suppose, goes more frequently to lecture, or to church, or to some
  conventicle, than anywhere else. Such a life would not suit my grandchild,
  Gillian, at all. Nevertheless, Mistress Aveline is a sweet young lady, much
  beloved for her kindness and goodness; and her gentle words have healed many
  a wound occasioned by the harsh speech and severe reproofs of her father.
  There, Sir,&mdash;you may behold her fair and saintly countenance now. She
  seems pleased with the scene, and I am sure she well may be; for it is always
  a pleasant and a heart-cheering sight to see folks happy and enjoying
  themselves; and I cannot think that the beneficent Power above ever intended
  we should make ourselves miserable on earth, in order to win a place in
  heaven. I am an old man, Sir; and feeling this to be true, I have ever
  inculcated my opinions upon my children and grandchildren. Yet I confess I am
  surprised&mdash;knowing what I do of her father's character&mdash;that
  Mistress Aveline should indulge herself with beholding this profane
  spectacle, which ought, by rights, to be odious in her eyes."</p>

  <p>The latter part of this speech was uttered with a sly chuckle on the part
  of the old farmer, not altogether agreeable to Jocelyn. The growing interest
  he felt in the fair Puritan rendered him susceptible. The eyes of the two
  young persons had met again more than once, and were not quite so quickly
  withdrawn on either side as before; perhaps, because Aveline was less alarmed
  by the young man's appearance, or more attracted by it; and perhaps, on his
  part, because he had grown a little bolder. We know not how this might be;
  but we <i>do</i> know that the fair Puritan had gradually advanced towards
  the front of the window, and was now leaning slightly out of it, so that her
  charms of face and figure were more fully revealed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the May-pole had been planted, and the first dance round it
  concluded. At its close, Gillian, quitting her post of honour near the tree,
  and leaving the morrice-dancers and mummers to resume their merry rounds,
  unsanctioned by her sovereign presence, took a tambourine from one of the
  minstrels, and proceeded to collect gratuities within it intended for the
  hired performers in the ceremony. She was very successful in her efforts, as
  the number of coins, soon visible within the tambourine, showed. Not without
  blushing and some hesitation did the May Queen approach Dick Taverner. The
  'prentice made a pretence of fumbling in his pouch in order to prolong the
  interview, which chance had thus procured him; and after uttering all the
  complimentary phrases he could muster, and looking a great deal more than he
  said, he wound up his speech by declaring he would bestow a mark (and that
  was no slight sum, for the highest coin yet given was a silver groat) upon
  the minstrels, if they would play a lively dance for him, and she, the May
  Queen, would grace him with her hand in it. Encouraged by the laughter of the
  bystanders, and doubtless entertaining no great dislike to the proposal,
  Gillian, with a little affected coyness, consented; and the mark was
  immediately deposited in the tambourine by Dick, who, transported by his
  success, sprang from his saddle, and committing his steed to the care of a
  youth near him, whom he promised to reward for his trouble, followed close
  after the May Queen, as she proceeded with her collection. Ere long she came
  to Jocelyn, and held out the tambourine towards him. An idea just then
  occurred to the young man.</p>

  <p>"You have a pretty nosegay there, fair maiden," he said, pointing to a
  bunch of pinks and other fragrant flowers in her breast. "I will buy it from
  you, if you list."</p>

  <p>"You shall have it and welcome, fair Sir," Gillian replied, detaching the
  bouquet from her dress, and offering it to him.</p>

  <p>"Well done, Gillian," the old farmer cried approvingly.</p>

  <p>"Ah! are you there, grandsire!" the May Queen exclaimed. "Come! your gift
  for the minstrels and mummers&mdash;quick! quick!"</p>

  <p>And while old Greenford searched for a small coin, Jocelyn placed a piece
  of silver in the tambourine.</p>

  <p>"Will you do me a favour, my pretty maiden?" he said courteously.</p>

  <p>"That I will, right willingly, fair Sir," she replied; "provided I may do
  it honestly."</p>

  <p>"You shall not do it else," old Greenford observed.</p>

  <p>"Come, your gift, grandsire&mdash;you are slow in finding it."</p>

  <p>"Have patience, wench, have patience. Young folks are always in a hurry.
  Here 'tis!"</p>

  <p>"Only a silver groat!" she exclaimed, tossing her head. "Why, this young
  man behind me gave a mark; and so did this gallant gentleman on
  horseback."</p>

  <p>"Poh! poh! go along, wench. They will take better care of their money when
  they grow older."</p>

  <p>"Stay, my pretty maiden," Jocelyn cried; "you have promised to do me a
  favour."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Present this nosegay on my part to the young lady in yonder window."</p>

  <p>"What! offer this to Mistress Aveline Calveley?" Gillian exclaimed in
  surprise. "Are you sure she will accept it, Sir?"</p>

  <p>"Tut! do his bidding, child, without more ado," old Greenford interposed.
  "I shall like to see what will come of it&mdash;ha! ha!"</p>

  <p>Gillian could not help smiling too, and proceeded on her mission. Jocelyn
  put his horse into motion, and slowly followed her, almost expecting Aveline
  to withdraw. But he was agreeably disappointed by finding her maintain her
  place at the window. She must have remarked what was going forward, and
  therefore her tarrying emboldened him, and buoyed up his hopes.</p>

  <p>Arrived beneath the window, Gillian committed the tambourine to Dick
  Taverner, who still hovered behind her like her shadow, and fastening the
  bouquet to the end of her shepherdess's crook held it up towards Aveline,
  crying out, in a playful tone, and with an arch look, "'Tis a love gift to
  Mistress Aveline Calveley on the part of that young cavalier."</p>

  <p>Whether the offering, thus presented, would have been accepted may be
  questioned; but it was never destined to reach her for whom it was intended.
  Scarcely was the flower-laden crook uplifted, than a man of singularly stern
  aspect, with gray hair cut close to the head, grizzled beard, and military
  habiliments of ancient make, suddenly appeared behind Aveline, and seizing
  the nosegay, cast it angrily and contemptuously forth; so that it fell at
  Jocelyn's feet.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-15"
     name="ch1-15">CHAPTER XV.<br>
  Hugh Calveley.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Jocelyn at once comprehended that the person who had thus
  dashed the nosegay to the ground could be no other than Hugh Calveley. But
  all doubt on the point was removed by Aveline herself who exclaimed in a
  reproachful tone&mdash;"O father! what have you done?"</p>

  <p>"What have I done?" the Puritan rejoined, speaking in a loud voice, as if
  desirous that his words should reach the assemblage outside. "I have done
  that which thou thyself should'st have done, Aveline. I have signified my
  abhorrence of this vain ceremonial. But wherefore do I find you here? This is
  no fitting sight for any discreet maiden to witness; and little did I think
  that daughter of mine would encourage such profane displays by her presence.
  Little did I think that you, Aveline, would look on and smile while these
  ignorant and benighted folk set up their idol, piping, dancing, and singing
  around it as the Gentiles did at the dedications of their deities. For it
  <i>is</i> an idol they have set up, and they have become like the heathens,
  worshippers of stocks and stones. Are we not expressly forbidden by the Holy
  Scriptures to make unto ourselves idols and graven images? The sins of
  idolatry and superstition will assuredly provoke the Divine displeasure, and
  kindle the fire of its wrath, as they did in the days of Moses, after the
  worshipping of the Golden Calf by the Israelites. Thus spake offended
  Heaven:&mdash;'Let me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that
  I may consume them.' Grievously will the Lord punish such as are guilty of
  these sins, for hath He not declared, as we read in Leviticus, 'I will make
  your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries to desolation?' And be assured,
  O daughter, that heavy judgments will descend upon the land, if warning be
  not taken in time."</p>

  <p>"Nay, dear father, I cannot view the matter in the same serious light that
  you do," Aveline rejoined, "neither do I think evil can be derived from
  pastimes like the present, unless by the evil disposed. I must frankly own
  that it is pleasant to me to witness such innocent enjoyment as is here
  exhibited; while as to yon May-pole, with its pretty floral decorations, I
  can never be brought to regard it as an emblem of superstition and idolatry.
  Nevertheless, had you commanded me to refrain from the sight, I would
  unhesitatingly have obeyed you. But I thought I was free to follow my own
  inclinations."</p>

  <p>"Why so you were, child," the Puritan rejoined, "because I had full
  reliance on you, and did not conceive you could have been so easily beguiled
  by Satan. I lament to find you cannot discern the superstition and wickedness
  lurking within this false, though fair-seeming spectacle. Do you not perceive
  that in setting up this wooden idol, and worshipping it, these people are
  returning to the dark and sinful practices of Paganism of which it is an
  undoubted remnant? If you cannot discern this, I will make it manifest to you
  anon. But I tell you now briefly," he continued in a voice of thunder,
  calculated to reach those at a distance, "that the ceremony is impious; that
  those who take part in it are idolaters; and that those who look on and
  approve are participators in the sin; yea, are equal in sin to the actors
  themselves."</p>

  <p>Hereupon some murmurs of displeasure arose among the crowd, but they were
  instantly checked by the curiosity generally felt to hear Aveline's reply,
  which was delivered in clear and gentle, but distinct tones.</p>

  <p>"Far be it from me to dispute with you, dear father," she said; "and it is
  with reluctance that I offer an opinion at all adverse to your own. But it
  seems to me impossible to connect these pastimes with heathenish and
  superstitious rites; for though they may bear some resemblance to ceremonials
  performed in honour of the goddesses Maia and Flora, yet, such creeds being
  utterly forgotten, and their spirit extinct, it cannot revive in sports that
  have merely reference to harmless enjoyment. Not one, I am sure, of these
  worthy folk has the slightest thought of impiety."</p>

  <p>"You know not what you say, girl," the Puritan rejoined sharply. "The evil
  spirit is <i>not</i> extinct, and these growing abominations prove it to be
  again raising its baleful crest to pollute and destroy. Listen to my words,
  ye vain and foolish ones!" he continued, advancing to the front of the
  window, and stretching forth his arms towards the assemblage. "Repent! and
  amend your ways ere it be too late! Hew down the offensive idol, which you
  term your May-pole, and cast it into the flames! Cease your wanton sports,
  your noisy pipings, your profane dances, your filthy tipplings. Hear what the
  prophet Isaiah saith:&mdash;'Wo to them that rise up early in the morning,
  that they may follow strong drink.' And again:&mdash;'Wo to the drunkards of
  Ephraim.' And I say Wo unto you also, for you are like unto those drunkards.
  'O do not this abominable thing that my soul hateth.' Be not guilty of the
  brutish sin of drunkenness. Reflect on the words of holy Job,&mdash;'They
  take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. They spend
  their days in mirth, and in a moment go down, to the grave.' Hew down your
  idol I say again. Consume it utterly, and scatter its ashes to the winds.
  Strip off the gaudes and tinsel in which you have decked your foolish May
  Queen. Have done with your senseless and profane mummeries; and dismiss your
  Robin Hoods, your Friar Tucks, and your Hobby-horses. Silence your pestilent
  minstrels, and depart peaceably to your own homes. Abandon your sinful
  courses, or assuredly 'the Lord will come upon you unawares, and cut you in
  sunder, and appoint your portion among unbelievers.'"</p>

  <p>So sonorous was the voice of the Puritan, so impressive were his looks and
  gestures, that his address commanded general attention. While he continued to
  speak, the sports were wholly stopped. The minstrels left off playing to
  listen to him, and the mummers suspended their merry evolutions round the
  May-pole. The poor denounced May Queen, who on the rejection of her nosegay
  had flown back to Jocelyn, now looked doubly disconcerted at this direct
  attack upon her and her finery, and pouted her pretty lips in vexation. Dick
  Taverner, who stood by her side, seemed disposed to resent the affront, and
  shook his fist menacingly at the Puritan. Jocelyn himself was perplexed and
  annoyed, for though inclined to take part with the assemblage, the growing
  interest he felt in Aveline forbade all interference with her father.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-16"
     name="ch1-16">CHAPTER XVI.<br>
  Of the Sign Given by the Puritan to the Assemblage.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Meanwhile, a great crowd had collected beneath the window,
  and though no interruption was offered to the speaker, it was easy to discern
  from the angry countenances of his hearers what was the effect of the address
  upon them. When he had done, Hugh Calveley folded his arms upon his breast,
  and sternly regarded the assemblage.</p>

  <p>He was well-stricken in years, as his grizzled hair and beard denoted, but
  neither was his strength impaired, nor the fire of his eye dimmed. Squarely
  built, with hard and somewhat massive features, strongly stamped with
  austerity, he was distinguished by a soldier-like deportment and manner,
  while his bronzed countenance, which bore upon it more than one cicatrice,
  showed he must have been exposed to foreign suns, and seen much service.
  There was great determination about the mouth, and about the physiognomy
  generally, while at the same time there was something of the wildness of
  fanaticism in his looks. He was habited in a buff jerkin, with a brown,
  lackered, breast-plate over it, thigh-pieces of a similar colour and similar
  material, and stout leathern boots. A broad belt with a heavy sword attached
  to, it crossed his breast, and round his neck was a plain falling band. You
  could not regard Hugh Calveley without feeling he was a man to die a martyr
  in any cause he had espoused.</p>

  <p>A deep groan was now directed against him. But it moved not a muscle of
  his rigid countenance.</p>

  <p>Jocelyn began to fear from the menacing looks of the crowd that some
  violence might be attempted, and he endeavoured to check it.</p>

  <p>"Bear with him, worthy friends," he cried, "he means you well, though he
  may reprove you somewhat too sharply."</p>

  <p>"Beshrew him for an envious railer," cried a miller, "he mars all our
  pleasures with his peevish humours. He would have us all as discontented with
  the world as himself&mdash;but we know better. He will not let us have our
  lawful sports as enjoined by the King himself on Sundays, and he now tries to
  interfere with our recreations on holidays. A pest upon him for a
  cankerbitten churl!"</p>

  <p>"His sullen looks are enough to turn all the cream in the village sour,"
  observed an old dame.</p>

  <p>"Why doth he not betake himself to the conventicle and preach there?" old
  Greenford cried. "Why should we have all these bitter texts of scripture
  thrown at our heads? Why should we be likened to the drunkards of Ephraim
  because we drink our Whitsun-ales? I have tasted nothing more than my morning
  cup as yet."</p>

  <p>"Why should our May-pole be termed an idol? Answer me that, good
  grandsire?" Gillian demanded.</p>

  <p>"Nay, let him who called it so answer thee, child, for I cannot," the old
  farmer rejoined. "I can see naught idolatrous in it."</p>

  <p>"Why should our pretty May Queen be despoiled of her ornaments because
  they please not his fanatical taste?" Dick Taverner demanded. "For my part I
  can discern no difference between a Puritan and a knave, and I would hang
  both."</p>

  <p>This sally met with a favourable reception from the crowd, and a voice
  exclaimed&mdash;"Ay, hang all knavish Puritans."</p>

  <p>Again Hugh Calveley lifted up his voice. "Think not to make me afraid," he
  cried; "I have confronted armed hosts with boldness when engaged in a worse
  cause than this, and I am not likely to give way before a base rabble, now
  that I have become a soldier of Christ and fight his battles. I repeat my
  warnings to you, and will not hold my peace till you give heed to them.
  Continue not in the sins of the Gentiles lest their punishment come upon you.
  These are fearful times we live in. London is become another Nineveh, and
  will be devoured by flames like that great city. It is full of corruption and
  debauchery, of oppressions, thefts, and deceits. With the prophet Nahum I
  exclaim&mdash;'Wo to the city, it is full of lies and robbery! What griping
  usury, what extortion are practised within it! What fraud, what injustice,
  what misrule! But the Lord's anger will be awakened against it. Palaces of
  kings are of no more account in His eyes than cottages of peasants.&mdash;He
  cutteth off the spirits of Princes: he is terrible to the Kings of the
  earth.' He knoweth no difference between them that sit on thrones, and those
  that go from door to door. For what saith the prophet Isaiah?&mdash;'I will
  punish the stout heart of the King of Assyria, and the glory of his high
  looks.' Let the Great Ones of the land be warned as well as the meanest, or
  judgment will come upon them."</p>

  <p>"Methinks that smacks of treason," cried Dick Taverner. "Our Puritan has
  quitted us poor fowl to fly at higher game. Hark ye, Sir!" he added to Hugh
  Calveley. "You would not dare utter such words as those in the King's
  presence."</p>

  <p>"Thou art mistaken, friend," the other rejoined. "It is my purpose to warn
  him in terms strong as those I have just used. Why should I hold my peace
  when I have a mission from on high? I shall speak to the King as Nathan spoke
  to David."</p>

  <p>"He speaks like a prophet," cried the miller; "I begin to have faith in
  him. No doubt the iniquities of London are fearful."</p>

  <p>"If he preach against extortioners and usurers only, I am with him," Dick
  Taverner said. "If he rid London of Sir Giles Mompesson and his peers he will
  do good service&mdash;still better, if he will put down corruption and
  injustice as exhibited in the Court of Star-Chamber&mdash;eh, Master Jocelyn
  Mounchensey?"</p>

  <p>At the mention of this name the Puritan appeared greatly surprised, and
  looked round inquiringly, till his eye alighted upon the young man.</p>

  <p>After regarding him for a moment fixedly, he demanded&mdash;"Art thou
  Jocelyn Mounchensey?"</p>

  <p>The young man, equally surprised, replied in the affirmative.</p>

  <p>"The son of Sir Ferdinando Mounchensey, of Massingham, in Norfolk?"
  inquired the Puritan.</p>

  <p>"The same," Jocelyn answered.</p>

  <p>"Thy father was my nearest and dearest friend, young man," Hugh Calveley
  said; "and thy father's son shall be welcome to my dwelling. Enter, I pray of
  you. Yet pause for a moment. I have a word more to declare to these people.
  Ye heed not my words, and make a mock of me," he continued, addressing the
  assemblage: "but I will give you a sign that I have spoken the truth."</p>

  <p>"He will bring the devil among us, I trow," cried Dick Taverner.</p>

  <p>"'Tis to be hoped he will not split the May-pole with a thunderbolt," said
  the miller.</p>

  <p>"Nor spoil our Whitsun-ales," cried old Greenford.</p>

  <p>"Nor lame our Hobby-horse," said one of the mummers.</p>

  <p>"Nor rob me of my wreath and garlands," said Gillian.</p>

  <p>"That he shall not, I promise you, fair May Queen!" Dick Tavernor
  rejoined, gallantly.</p>

  <p>"I will do none of these things. I would not harm you, even if I had the
  power," the Puritan said. "But I will discharge a bolt against the head of
  yon idol," he added, pointing towards the flower-crowned summit of the
  May-pole; "and if I break its neck and cast it down, ye will own that a
  higher hand than mine directs the blow, and that the superstitious symbol
  ought not to be left standing."</p>

  <p>"As to what we may do, or what we may acknowledge, we will give no
  promise, Master Hugh Calveley," rejoined old Greenford. "But e'en let fly thy
  bolt, if thou wilt."</p>

  <p>Some dissent was offered to this singular proposition, but the majority of
  voices overruled it; and withdrawing for a moment, Hugh Calveley returned
  with an arbalist, which he proceeded deliberately to arm in view of the
  crowd, and then placed a quarrel within it.</p>

  <p>"In the name of the Lord, who cast down the golden idol made by Aaron and
  the Israelites, I launch this bolt," he cried, as he took aim, and liberated
  the cord.</p>

  <p>The short, iron-headed, square-pointed arrow whizzed through the air, and,
  by the mischief it did as it hit its mark, seemed to confirm the Puritan's
  denunciation. Striking the May-pole precisely at the summit, it shattered the
  wood, and brought down the floral crown surmounting it, as well as the
  topmost streamers.</p>

  <p>The spectators stared aghast.</p>

  <p>"Be warned by this," thundered Hugh Calveley, with gloomy triumph. "Your
  idol is smitten&mdash;not by my hand, but by His who will chastise your
  wickedness."</p>

  <p>Whereupon he closed the window, and departed. Presently afterwards, the
  door was opened by an old, grave-looking, decently-clad serving-man.
  Addressing Jocelyn, who had already dismounted and given his horse in charge
  to the youth engaged for a similar purpose by Dick Taverner, this personage
  invited him, in his master's name, to enter; and, with a heart throbbing with
  emotion, the young man complied. Chance seemed to befriend him in a way he
  could never have anticipated; and he now hoped to obtain an interview with
  Aveline.</p>

  <p>His conductor led him through a passage to a large chamber at the back of
  the house, with windows looking upon a garden. The room was panelled with
  dark shining oak, had a polished floor, an immense chimney-piece, and a
  moulded ceiling. Within it were a few high-backed chairs, and some other
  cumbrous furniture, while on an oak table at the side, was spread the simple
  morning repast of the Puritan and his daughter. But all these things were
  lost upon Jocelyn, who had eyes only for one object. She was there, and how
  lovely she appeared! How exquisite in figure&mdash;how faultless in feature!
  Some little embarrassment was discoverable in her manner as the young man
  entered; but it quickly disappeared. Her father was with her; and advancing
  towards Jocelyn, he took him kindly by the hand, and bade him welcome. Then,
  without relinquishing his grasp, he presented the young man to his daughter,
  saying&mdash;</p>

  <p>"This is Jocelyn, the son of my dear departed friend, Sir Ferdinando
  Mounchensey. Some inscrutable design of Providence has brought him hither,
  and right glad I am to behold him. Years ago, his father rendered me a signal
  service, which I requited as I best could; and there is nothing I would not
  gladly do for the son of such a friend. You will esteem him accordingly,
  Aveline."</p>

  <p>"I will not fail in my duty, father," she replied, blushing slightly.</p>

  <p>And Jocelyn thought these words were the sweetest he had ever heard
  pronounced.</p>

  <p>"I would pray you to break your fast with us, if our simple fare will
  content you," said Hugh Calveley, pointing to the table.</p>

  <p>"I am not over-dainty, and shall do ample justice to whatever is set
  before me," Jocelyn replied, smiling.</p>

  <p>"It is well," said the Puritan. "I am glad to find the son of my old
  friend is not a slave to his appetites, as are most of the young men of this
  generation."</p>

  <p>With this they approached the board; and, a lengthy grace being pronounced
  by Hugh Calveley, Jocelyn sat down by the side of Aveline, scarcely able to
  believe in the reality of his own happiness&mdash;so like a dream it
  seemed.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-17"
     name="ch1-17">CHAPTER XVII.<br>
  A Rash Promise.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">During the slender repast, Jocelyn, in reply to the
  inquiries of the Puritan, explained the two-fold motive of his coming to
  London; namely, the desire of taking vengeance on his father's enemies, and
  the hope of obtaining some honourable employment, such as a gentleman might
  accept.</p>

  <p>"My chances in the latter respect are not very great," he said, "seeing I
  have no powerful friends to aid me in my endeavours, and I must consequently
  trust to fortune. But as regards my enemies, if I can only win an audience of
  the King, and plead my cause before him, I do not think he will deny me
  justice."</p>

  <p>"Justice!" exclaimed the Puritan with deep scorn. "James Stuart knows it
  not. An archhypocrite, and perfidious as hypocritical, he holdeth as a maxim
  that Dissimulation is necessary to a Ruler. He has the cowardice and the
  ferocity of the hyaena. He will promise fairly, but his deeds will falsify
  his words. Recollect how his Judas kiss betrayed Somerset. Recollect his
  conduct towards the Gowries. But imagine not, because you have been evil
  intreated and oppressed, that the King will redress your wrongs, and
  reinstate you in your fallen position. Rather will he take part with the
  usurers and extortioners who have deprived you of your inheritance. How many
  poor wretches doth he daily condemn to the same lingering agonies and certain
  destruction that he doomed your father. Lamentable as is the good Sir
  Ferdinando's case, it stands not alone. It is one of many. And many, many
  more will be added to the list, if this tyrannical Herodias be suffered to
  govern."</p>

  <p>And as if goaded by some stinging thought, that drove him nigh distracted,
  Hugh Calveley arose, and paced to and fro within the chamber. His brow became
  gloomier and his visage sterner.</p>

  <p>"Bear with him, good Master Jocelyn," Aveline said in a low tone. "He hath
  been unjustly treated by the King, and as you see can ill brook the usage.
  Bear with him, I pray of you."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn had no time to make reply. Suddenly checking himself, and fixing
  his earnest gaze upon the young man, the Puritan said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Give ear to me, my son. If I desired to inflame your breast with rage
  against this tyrant, I should need only to relate one instance of his cruelty
  and injustice. I had a friend&mdash;a very dear friend," he continued, in a
  tone of deep pathos&mdash;"confined within the Fleet Prison by a decree of
  the Star-Chamber. He was to me as a brother, and to see him gradually pining
  away cut me to the soul. Proud by nature, he refused to abase himself to his
  oppressor, and could not be brought to acknowledge wrongs he had never
  committed. Pardon, therefore, was denied him&mdash;not pardon merely, but all
  mitigation of suffering. My friend had been wealthy; but heavy fines and
  penalties had stripped him of his possessions, and brought him to
  destitution. Lord of an ancient hall, with woods and lands around it, wherein
  he could ride for hours without quitting his own domains, his territories
  were now narrowed to a few yards; while one dark, dreary chamber was alone
  accorded him. Finding he must necessarily perish, if left to rot there, I
  prevailed upon him (not without much reluctance on his part) to petition the
  King for liberation; and was myself the bearer of his prayer. Earnestly
  pleading the cause of the unfortunate man, and representing his forlorn
  condition, I besought his Majesty's gracious intercession. But when I had
  wearied the royal ear with entreaties, the sharp reply was&mdash;'Doth he
  make submission? Will he confess his offence?' And as I could only affirm,
  that as he was guilty of no crime, so he could confess none, the King
  returned me the petition, coldly observing&mdash;'The dignity of our Court of
  Star-Chamber must be maintained before all things. He hath been guilty of
  contempt towards it, and must purge him of the offence.' 'But the man will
  die, Sire,' I urged, 'if he be not removed from the Fleet. His prison-lodging
  is near a foul ditch, and he is sick with fever. Neither can he have such aid
  of medicine or of nursing as his case demands.' 'The greater reason he should
  relieve himself by speedy acknowledgment of the justice of his sentence,'
  said the King. 'The matter rests not with us, but with himself.' 'But he is a
  gentleman, Sire,' I persisted, 'to whom truth is dearer than life, and who
  would rather languish in misery for thrice the term he is likely to last,
  than forfeit his own self-esteem by admitting falsehood and injustice.' 'Then
  let him perish in his pride and obstinacy,' cried the King impatiently. And
  thereupon he dismissed me."</p>

  <p>"O Sir!" exclaimed Jocelyn, rising and throwing, his arms round the
  Puritan's neck; "you, then, were the friend who tended my poor father in his
  last moments. Heaven bless you for it!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Jocelyn, it was I who heard your father's latest sigh," the Puritan
  replied, returning his embrace, "and your own name was breathed with it. His
  thoughts were of his son far away&mdash;too young to share his distresses, or
  to comprehend them."</p>

  <p>"Alas! alas!" cried Jocelyn mournfully.</p>

  <p>"Lament not for your father, Jocelyn," said the Puritan, solemnly; "he is
  reaping the reward of his earthly troubles in heaven! Be comforted, I say.
  The tyrant can no longer oppress him. He is beyond the reach of his malice.
  He can be arraigned at no more unjust tribunals. He is where no cruel and
  perfidious princes, no iniquitous judges, no griping extortioners shall ever
  enter."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn endeavoured to speak, but his emotion overpowered him.</p>

  <p>"I have already told you that your father rendered me a service impossible
  to be adequately requited," pursued the Puritan. "What that service was I
  will one day inform you. Suffice it now, that it bound me to him in chains
  firmer than brass. Willingly would I have laid down my life for him, if he
  had desired it. Gladly would I have taken his place in the Fleet prison, if
  that could have procured him liberation. Unable to do either, I watched over
  him while he lived&mdash;and buried him when dead."</p>

  <p>"O Sir, you have bound me to you as strongly as you were bound to my
  father," cried Jocelyn. "For the devotion shown to him, I hold myself
  eternally your debtor."</p>

  <p>The Puritan regarded him steadfastly for a moment.</p>

  <p>"What if I were to put these professions to the test?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Do so," Jocelyn replied earnestly. "My life is yours!"</p>

  <p>"Your life!" exclaimed Hugh Calveley, grasping his arm almost fiercely,
  while his eye blazed. "Consider what you offer."</p>

  <p>"I need not consider," Jocelyn rejoined. "I repeat my life is yours, if
  you demand it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I <i>shall</i> demand it," cried Hugh Calveley. "Ere long,
  perhaps."</p>

  <p>"Demand it when you will," Jocelyn said.</p>

  <p>"Father!" Aveline interposed, "do not let the young man bind himself by
  this promise. Release him, I pray of you."</p>

  <p>"The promise cannot be recalled, my child," the Puritan replied. "But I
  shall never claim its fulfilment save for some high and holy purpose."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure your purpose <i>is</i> holy, father?" Aveline said in a low
  tone.</p>

  <p>"What mean you, child?" cried Hugh Calveley, knitting his brows. "I am but
  an instrument in the hands of Heaven, appointed to do its work; and as
  directed, so I must act. Heaven may make me the scourge of the oppressor and
  evil-doer, or the sword to slay the tyrant. I may die a martyr for my faith,
  or do battle for it with carnal weapons. For all these I am ready; resigning
  myself to the will of God. Is it for nothing, think'st thou, that this young
  man&mdash;the son of my dear departed friend&mdash;has been brought hither at
  this particular conjuncture? Is it for nothing that, wholly unsolicited, he
  has placed his life at my disposal, and in doing so has devoted himself to a
  great cause? Like myself he hath wrongs to avenge, and the Lord of Hosts will
  give him satisfaction."</p>

  <p>"But not in the way you propose, father," Aveline rejoined. "Heaven will
  assuredly give you both satisfaction for the wrongs you have endured; but it
  must choose its own means of doing so, and its own time."</p>

  <p>"It <i>hath</i> chosen the means, and the time is coming quickly," cried
  the Puritan, his eye again kindling with fanatical light. "'The Lord will cut
  off from Israel head and tail.'"</p>

  <p>"These things are riddles to me," observed Jocelyn, who had listened to
  what was passing with great uneasiness. "I would solicit an explanation?"</p>

  <p>"You shall have it, my son," Hugh Calveley replied. "But not now. My hour
  for solitary prayer and self-communion is come, and I must withdraw to my
  chamber. Go forth into the garden, Jocelyn&mdash;and do thou attend him,
  Aveline. I will join you when my devotions are ended."</p>

  <p>So saying he quitted the room, while the youthful pair went forth as
  enjoined.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-18"
     name="ch1-18">CHAPTER XVIII.<br>
  How the promise was cancelled.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was a large garden, once fairly laid out and planted, but
  now sadly neglected. The broad terrace walk was overgrown with weeds; the
  stone steps and the carved balusters were broken in places, and covered with
  moss; the once smooth lawn was unconscious of the scythe; the parterres had
  lost their quaint devices; and the knots of flowers&mdash;tre-foil,
  cinque-foil, diamond, and cross-bow&mdash;were no longer distinguishable in
  their original shapes. The labyrinths of the maze were inextricably tangled,
  and the long green alleys wanted clearing out.</p>

  <p>But all this neglect passed unnoticed by Jocelyn, so completely was he
  engrossed by the fair creature at his side. Even the noise of the May Games,
  which, temporarily interrupted by Hugh Calveley, had recommenced with greater
  vigour than ever&mdash;the ringing of the church bells, the shouts of the
  crowd, and the sounds of the merry minstrelsy, scarcely reached his ear. For
  the first time he experienced those delicious sensations which new-born love
  excites within the breast; and the enchantment operated upon him so rapidly
  and so strongly, that he was overpowered by its spell almost before aware of
  it. It seemed that he had never really lived till this moment; never, at
  least, comprehended the bliss afforded by existence in the companionship of a
  being able to awaken the transports he now experienced. A new world seemed
  suddenly opened to him, full of love, hope, sunshine, of which he and Aveline
  were the sole inhabitants. Hitherto his life had been devoid of any great
  emotion. The one feeling latterly pervading it had been a sense of deep
  wrong, coupled with the thirst of vengeance. No tenderer influence had
  softened his almost rugged nature; and his breast continued arid as the
  desert. Now the rock had been stricken, and the living waters gushed forth
  abundantly. Not that in Norfolk, and even in the remote part of the county
  where his life had been passed, female beauty was rare. Nowhere, indeed, is
  the flower of loveliness more thickly sown than in that favoured part of our
  isle. But all such young damsels as he had beheld had failed to move him; and
  if any shaft had been aimed at his breast it had fallen wide of the mark.
  Jocelyn Mounchensey was not one of those highly susceptible
  natures&mdash;quick to receive an impression, quicker to lose it. Neither
  would he have been readily caught by the lures spread for youth by the
  designing of the sex. Imbued with something of the antique spirit of
  chivalry, which yet, though but slightly, influenced the age in which he
  lived, he was ready and able to pay fervent homage to his mistress's
  sovereign beauty (supposing he had one), and maintain its supremacy against
  all questioners, but utterly incapable of worshipping at any meaner shrine.
  Heart-whole, therefore, when he encountered the Puritan's daughter, he felt
  that in her he had found an object he had long sought, to whom he could
  devote himself heart and soul; a maiden whose beauty was without peer, and
  whose mental qualities corresponded with her personal attractions.</p>

  <p>Nor was it a delusion under which he laboured. Aveline Calveley was all
  his imagination painted her. Purity of heart, gentleness of disposition,
  intellectual endowments, were as clearly revealed by her speaking countenance
  as the innermost depths of a fountain are by the pellucid medium through
  which they are viewed. Hers was a virgin heart, which, like his own, had
  received no previous impression. Love for her father alone had swayed her;
  though all strong demonstrations of filial affection had been checked by that
  father's habitually stern manner. Brought up by a female relative in
  Cheshire, who had taken charge of her on her mother's death, which had
  occurred during her infancy, she had known little of her father till late
  years, when she had come to reside with him, and, though devout by nature,
  she could ill reconcile herself to the gloomy notions of religion he
  entertained, or to the ascetic mode of life he practised. With no desire to
  share in the pomps and vanities of life, she could not be persuaded that
  cheerfulness was incompatible with righteousness; nor could all the railings
  she heard against them make her hate those who differed from her in religious
  opinions. Still she made no complaint. Entirely obedient to her father's
  will, she accommodated herself, as far as she could, to the rule of life
  prescribed by him. Aware of his pertinacity of opinion, she seldom or ever
  argued a point with him, even if she thought right might be on her side;
  holding it better to maintain peace by submission, than to hazard wrath by
  disputation. The discussion on the May Games was an exception to her ordinary
  conduct, and formed one of the few instances in which she had ventured to
  assert her own opinion in opposition to that of her father.</p>

  <p>Of late, indeed, she had felt great uneasiness about him. Much changed, he
  seemed occupied by some dark, dread thought, which partially revealed itself
  in wrathful exclamations and muttered menaces. He seemed to believe himself
  chosen by Heaven as an instrument of vengeance against oppression; and her
  fears were excited lest he might commit some terrible act under this fatal
  impression. She was the more confirmed in the idea from the eagerness with
  which he had grasped at Jocelyn's rash promise, and she determined to put the
  young man upon his guard.</p>

  <p>If, in order to satisfy the reader's curiosity, we are obliged to examine
  the state of Aveline's heart, in reference to Jocelyn, we must state candidly
  that no such ardent flame was kindled within it as burnt in the breast of the
  young man. That such a flame might arise was very possible, nay even
  probable, seeing that the sparks of love were there; and material for
  combustion was by no means wanting. All that was required was, that those
  sparks should be gently fanned&mdash;not heedlessly extinguished.</p>

  <p>Little was said by the two young persons, as they slowly paced the
  terrace. Both felt embarrassed: Jocelyn longing to give utterance to his
  feelings, but restrained by timidity&mdash;Aveline trembling lest more might
  be said than she ought to hear, or if obliged to hear, than she could rightly
  answer. Thus they walked on in silence. But it was a silence more eloquent
  than words, since each comprehended what the other felt. How much they would
  have said was proclaimed by the impossibility they found of saying
  anything!</p>

  <p>At length, Jocelyn stopped, and plucking a flower, observed, as he
  proffered it for her acceptance, "My first offering to you was rejected. May
  this be more fortunate."</p>

  <p>"Make me a promise, and I will accept it," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Willingly,", cried Jocelyn, venturing to take her hand, and gazing at her
  tenderly. "Most willingly."</p>

  <p>"You are far too ready to promise," she rejoined with a sad, sweet smile.
  "What I desire is this. Recall your hasty pledge to my father, and aid me in
  dissuading him from the enterprise in which he would engage you."</p>

  <p>As the words were uttered the Puritan stepped from behind the alley which
  had enabled him to approach them unperceived, and overhear their brief
  converse.</p>

  <p>"Hold!" he exclaimed in a solemn tone, and regarding Jocelyn with great
  earnestness. "That promise is sacred. It was made in a father's name, and
  must be fulfilled. As to my purpose it is unchangeable."</p>

  <p>The enthusiast's influence over Jocelyn would have proved irresistible but
  for the interposition of Aveline.</p>

  <p>"Be not controlled by him," she said in a low tone to the young man;
  adding to her father, "For my sake, let the promise be cancelled."</p>

  <p>"Let him ask it, and it shall be," rejoined the Puritan, gazing steadily
  at the young man, as if he would penetrate his soul. "Do you hesitate?" he
  cried in accents of deep disappointment, perceiving Jocelyn waver.</p>

  <p>"You cannot misunderstand his wishes, father," said Aveline.</p>

  <p>"Let him speak for himself," Hugh Calveley exclaimed angrily. "Jocelyn
  Mounchensey!" he continued, folding his arms upon his breast, and regarding
  the young man fixedly as before, "son of my old friend! son of him who died
  in my arms! son of him whom I committed to the earth! if thou hast aught of
  thy father's true spirit, thou wilt rigidly adhere to a pledge voluntarily
  given, and which, uttered as it was uttered by thee, has all the sanctity,
  all the binding force of a vow before Heaven, where it is registered, and
  approved by him who is gone before us."</p>

  <p>Greatly moved by this appeal, Jocelyn might have complied with it, but
  Aveline again interposed.</p>

  <p>"Not so, father," she cried. "The spirits of the just made
  perfect&mdash;and of such is the friend you mention&mdash;would never approve
  of the design with which you would link this young man, in consequence of a
  promise rashly made. Discharge him from it, I entreat you."</p>

  <p>Her energy shook even the Puritan's firmness.</p>

  <p>"Be it as thou wilt, daughter," he said, after the pause of a few moments,
  during which he waited for Jocelyn to speak; but, as the young man said
  nothing, he rightly interpreted his silence,&mdash;"be it as thou wilt, since
  he, too, wills it so. I give him back his promise. But let me see him no
  more."</p>

  <p>"Sir, I beseech you&mdash;" cried Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>But he was cut short by the Puritan, who, turning from him contemptuously,
  said to his daughter&mdash;"Let him depart immediately."</p>

  <p>Aveline signed to the young man to go; but finding him remain motionless,
  she took him by the hand, and led him some way along the terrace. Then,
  releasing her hold, she bade him farewell!</p>

  <p>"Wherefore have you done this?" inquired Jocelyn reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"Question me not; but be satisfied I have acted for the best," she
  replied. "O Jocelyn!" she continued anxiously, "if an opportunity should
  occur to you of serving my father, do not neglect it."</p>

  <p>"Be assured I will not," the young man replied. "Shall we not meet again?"
  he asked, in a tone of deepest anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she answered. "But you must go. My father will become
  impatient. Again farewell!"</p>

  <p>On this they separated: the young man sorrowfully departing, while her
  footsteps retreated in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the May games went forward on the green with increased spirit
  and merriment, and without the slightest hinderance. More than once the
  mummers had wheeled their mazy rounds, with Gillian and Dick Taverner footing
  it merrily in the midst of them. More than once the audacious 'prentice, now
  become desperately enamoured of his pretty partner, had ventured to steal a
  kiss from her lips. More than once he had whispered words of love in her ear;
  though, as yet, he had obtained no tender response. Once&mdash;and once
  only&mdash;had he taken her hand; but then he had never quitted it
  afterwards. In vain other swains claimed her for a dance. Dick refused to
  surrender his prize. They breakfasted together in a little bower made of
  green boughs, the most delightful and lover-like retreat imaginable. Dick's
  appetite, furious an hour ago, was now clean gone. He could eat nothing. He
  subsisted on love alone. But as she was prevailed upon to sip from a foaming
  tankard of Whitsun ale, he quaffed the remainder of the liquid with rapture.
  This done, they resumed their merry sports, and began to dance, again. The
  bells continued to ring blithely, the assemblage to shout, and the minstrels
  to play. A strange contrast to what was passing in the Puritan's garden.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-19"
     name="ch1-19">CHAPTER XIX.<br>
  Theobalds' Palace.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The magnificent palace of Theobalds, situated near Cheshunt,
  in Hertfordshire, originally the residence of the great Lord Treasurer
  Burleigh, and the scene of his frequent and sumptuous entertainments to Queen
  Elizabeth and the ambassadors to her Court, when she "was seen," says Stow,
  "in as great royalty, and served as bountifully and magnificently as at any
  other time or place, all at his lordship's charge; with rich shows, pleasant
  devices, and all manner of sports, to the great delight of her Majesty and
  her whole train, with great thanks from all who partook of it, and as great
  commendations from all that heard of it abroad:"&mdash;this famous and
  delightful palace, with its stately gardens, wherein Elizabeth had so often
  walked and held converse with her faithful counsellor; and its noble parks
  and chases, well stocked with deer, wherein she had so often hunted; came
  into possession of James the First, in the manner we shall proceed to relate,
  some years before the date of this history.</p>

  <p>James first made acquaintance with Theobalds during his progress from
  Scotland to assume the English crown, and it was the last point at which he
  halted before entering the capital of his new dominions. Here, for four days,
  he and his crowd of noble attendants were guests of Sir Robert Cecil,
  afterwards Earl of Salisbury, who proved himself the worthy son of his
  illustrious and hospitable sire by entertaining the monarch and his numerous
  train in the same princely style that the Lord Treasurer had ever displayed
  towards Queen Elizabeth. An eyewitness has described the King's arrival at
  Theobalds on this occasion. "Thus, then," says John Savile, "for his
  Majesty's coming up the walk, there came before him some of the nobility,
  barons, knights, esquires, gentlemen, and others, amongst whom was the
  sheriff of Essex, and most of his men, the trumpets sounding next before his
  highness, sometimes one, sometimes another; his Majesty riding not
  continually betwixt the same two, but sometimes one, sometimes another, as
  seemed best to his highness; the whole nobility of our land and Scotland
  round about him observing no place of superiority, all bare-headed, all of
  whom alighted from their horses at their entrance into the first court, save
  only his Majesty alone, who rid along still, four noblemen laying their hands
  upon his steed, two before and two behind. In this manner he came to the
  court door, where I myself stood. At the entrance into that court stood many
  noblemen, amongst whom was Sir Robert Cecil, who there meeting his Majesty
  conducted him into his house, all which was practised with as great applause
  of the people as could be, hearty prayer, and throwing up of hats. His
  Majesty had not stayed above an hour in his chamber, but hearing the
  multitude throng so fast into the uppermost court to see his highness, he
  showed himself openly out of his chamber window by the space of half an hour
  together; after which time he went into the labyrinth-like garden to walk,
  where he secreted himself in the Meander's compact of bays, rosemary, and the
  like overshadowing his walk, to defend him from the heat of the sun till
  supper time, at which was such plenty of provision for all sorts of men in
  their due places as struck me with admiration. And first, to begin with the
  ragged regiments, and such as were debarred the privilege of any court, these
  were so sufficiently rewarded with beef, veal, mutton, bread, and beer, that
  they sung holiday every day, and kept a continual feast. As for poor maimed
  and distressed soldiers, which repaired thither for maintenance, the wine,
  money, and meat which they had in very bounteous sort, hath become a
  sufficient spur to them to blaze it abroad since their coming to London." The
  reader will marvel at the extraordinary and unstinting hospitality practised
  in those days, which, as we have shown, was exhibited to all comers,
  irrespective of rank, even to the "ragged regiments," and which extended its
  bounties in the shape of alms to the wounded and disabled veteran. We find no
  parallel to it in modern times.</p>

  <p>Theobalds produced a highly favourable impression upon James, who,
  passionately attached to the chase, saw in its well-stocked parks the means
  of gratifying his tastes to the fullest extent. Its contiguity to Enfield
  Chase was also a great recommendation; and its situation, beautiful in
  itself, was retired, and yet within easy distance of the metropolis. It
  appeared to him to combine all the advantages of a royal hunting-seat with
  all the splendours of a palace; and his predilections were confirmed by a
  second visit paid by him to it in 1606, when he was accompanied by his
  brother-in-law, Christianus, King of Denmark, and when the two monarchs were
  gloriously entertained by the Earl of Salisbury. The Danish king drank
  inordinately; so did the whole of his suite: and they soon inoculated the
  English Court with their sottish tastes. Bonnie King Jamie himself got
  <i>fou</i> twice a-day; and, melancholy to relate, the ladies of the Court
  followed the royal example, and, "abandoning their sobriety, were seen to
  roll about in intoxication." So says Sir John Harington, who has given a very
  diverting account of the orgies at Theobalds, and the inebriate extravagances
  of Christianus. "One day," writes Sir John, "a great feast was held; and
  after dinner the representation of Solomon's Temple and the coming of the
  Queen of Sheba was made, or (as I may better say) was meant to have been made
  before their Majesties, by device of the Earl of Salisbury and others. But
  alas! as all earthly things do fail to poor mortals in enjoyment, so did
  prove our presentment thereof. The lady that did play the Queen's part did
  carry most precious gifts to both their Majesties, but forgetting the steps
  arising to the canopy, overset her casket into his Danish Majesty's lap, and
  fell at his feet, though I rather think it was into his face. Much was the
  hurry and confusion. Cloths and napkins were at hand to make all clean. His
  Majesty then got up, and would dance with the Queen of Sheba; but he fell
  down and humbled himself before her, and was carried to an inner chamber, and
  laid on a bed of state. The entertainment and show went forward, and most of
  the presenters went backward, or fell down; wine did so occupy their upper
  chambers." Worthy Sir John seems to have been greatly scandalized, as he well
  might be, at these shameless proceedings, and he exclaims pathetically, "The
  Danes have again conquered the Britons; for I see no man, or woman either,
  that can command himself or herself." Nor does he fail to contrast these
  "strange pageantries" with what occurred of the same sort, in the same place,
  in Queen Elizabeth's time, observing, "I never did see such lack of good
  order, discretion, and sobriety as I have now done."</p>

  <p>Having set his heart upon Theobalds, James offered the Earl of Salisbury,
  in exchange for it, the palace and domains of Hatfield; and the proposal
  being accepted (it could not very well be refused), the delivery of the
  much-coveted place was made on the 22nd May, 1607; the Prince Joinville,
  brother to the Duke de Guise, being present on the occasion, where fresh
  festivities were held, accompanied by an indifferent Masque from Ben Jonson.
  Whether the King or the Earl had the best of the bargain, we are not prepared
  to decide.</p>

  <p>Enchanted with his acquisition, James commenced the work of improvement
  and embellishment by enlarging the park, appropriating a good slice of
  Enfield Chace, with parts of Northaw and Cheshunt Commons, and surrounding
  the whole with a high brick wall ten miles in circumference. Within this ring
  he found ample scope for the indulgence of his hunting propensities, since it
  contained an almost inexhaustible stock of the finest deer in the kingdom;
  and within it might be heard the sound of his merry horn, and the baying of
  his favourite stag-hounds, whenever he could escape from the cares of state,
  or the toils of the council-chamber. His escapes from these demands upon his
  time were so frequent, and the attraction of the woods of Theobalds so
  irresistible, that remonstrances were made to him on the subject; but they
  proved entirely ineffectual. He declared he would rather return to Scotland
  than forego his amusements.</p>

  <p>Theobalds, in the time of its grandeur, might be styled the Fontainebleau
  of England. Though not to be compared with Windsor Castle in grandeur of
  situation, or magnificence of forest scenery, still it was a stately
  residence, and worthy of the monarch of a mighty country. Crowned with four
  square towers of considerable height and magnitude, each with a lion and vane
  on the top; it had besides, a large, lantern-shaped central turret, proudly
  domineering over the others, and "made with timber of excellent workmanship,
  curiously wrought with divers pinnacles at each corner, wherein were hung
  twelve bells for chimage, and a clock with chimes of sundry work." The whole
  structure was built, says the survey, "of excellent brick, with coigns,
  jambs, and cornices of stone." Approached from the south by a noble avenue of
  trees, planted in double rows, and a mile in length, it presented a striking
  and most picturesque appearance, with its lofty towers, its great gilded
  vanes, supported, as we have said, by lions, its crowd of twisted chimnies,
  its leaded and arched walks, its balconies, and its immense bay windows. Nor
  did it lose its majestic and beautiful aspect as you advanced nearer, and its
  vast proportions became more fully developed. Then you perceived its grand
  though irregular facades, its enormous gates, its cloistered walks, and its
  superb gardens; and comprehended that with its five courts and the countless
  apartments they contained, to say nothing of the world of offices, that the
  huge edifice comprised a town within itself&mdash;and a well-peopled town
  too. The members of the household, and the various retainers connected with
  it, were multitudinous as the rooms themselves.</p>

  <p>One charm and peculiarity of the palace, visible from without, consisted
  in the arched walks before referred to, placed high up on the building, on
  every side. Screened from the weather, these walks looked upon the different
  courts and gardens, and commanded extensive views of the lovely sylvan
  scenery around. Hence Cheshunt and Waltham Abbey, Enfield, and other
  surrounding villages, could be distinguished through the green vistas of the
  park.</p>

  <p>On the south, facing the grand avenue, was "a large open cloister, built
  upon several large fair pillars of stone, arched over with seven arches, with
  a fair rail, and balusters, well painted with the Kings and Queens of
  England, and the pedigree of the old Lord Burleigh, and divers other ancient
  families."</p>

  <p>The body of the palace consisted of two large quadrangles: one of which,
  eighty-six feet square, was denominated the Fountain Court, from the
  circumstance of a fountain of black and white marble standing within it. The
  other quadrangle, somewhat larger, being one hundred and ten feet square, was
  called the Middle Court. In addition to these, there were three other smaller
  courts, respectively entitled the Dial Court, the Buttery Court, and the
  Dove-house Court, wherein the offices were situated.</p>

  <p>On the east side of the Fountain Court stood an arched cloister; and on
  the ground-floor there was a spacious hall, paved with marble, and
  embellished with a curiously-carved ceiling. Adjoining it were the apartments
  assigned to the Earl of Salisbury as Keeper of Theobalds, the
  council-chamber, and the chambers of Sir Lewis Lewkener, Master of the
  Ceremonies, and Sir John Finett. Above was the presence-chamber, wainscotted
  with oak, painted in liver-colour and gilded, having rich pendents from the
  ceiling, and vast windows resplendent with armorial bearings. Near this were
  the privy-chamber and the King's bed-chamber, together with a wide gallery,
  one hundred and twenty-three feet in length, wainscotted and roofed like the
  presence-chamber, but yet more gorgeously fretted and painted. Its walls were
  ornamented with stags' heads with branching antlers. On the upper floor were
  the rooms assigned to the Duke of Lennox, as Lord Chamberlain, and close to
  them was one of the external leaded walks before alluded to, sixty-two feet
  long-and eleven wide, which, from its eminent position, carried the gaze to
  Ware.</p>

  <p>In the Middle-court were the Queen's apartments, comprising her chapel,
  presence-chamber, and other rooms, and over them a gallery nearly equal in
  length to that reserved for the King. In this quadrangle, also, were Prince
  Charles's lodgings. Over the latter was the Green Gallery, one hundred and
  nine feet in length, and proportionately wide. And above the gallery was
  another external covered walk, wherein were two "lofty arches of brick, of no
  small ornament to the house, and rendering it comely and pleasant to all that
  passed by."</p>

  <p>The gardens were enchanting, and in perfect keeping with the palace.
  Occupying several acres. They seemed infinitely larger than they were, since
  they abounded in intricate alleys, labyrinths, and mazes; so that you were
  easily lost within them, and sometimes wanted a clue to come forth. They
  contained some fine canals, fountains, and statues. In addition to the great
  gardens were the priory-gardens, with other inclosures for pheasants,
  aviaries, and menageries; for James was very fond of wild beasts, and had a
  collection of them worthy of a zoological garden. In one of his letters to
  Buckingham when the latter was at Madrid, we find him inquiring about the
  elephant, camels, and wild asses. He had always a camel-house at Theobalds.
  To close our description, we may add that the tennis-court, <i>manége</i>
  stable kennels, and falconry were on a scale of magnitude proportionate to
  the palace.</p>

  <p>Beneath the wide-spreading branches of a noble elm, forming part of the
  great avenue, and standing at a short distance from the principal, entrance
  to the palace, were collected together, one pleasant afternoon in May, a
  small group of persons, consisting almost entirely of the reader's
  acquaintances. Chief amongst them was Jocelyn Mounchensey, who, having
  dismounted and fastened his horse to the branch, was leaning against the
  large trunk of the tree, contemplating the magnificent structure we have
  attempted to describe. Unacquainted as yet with its internal splendours, he
  had no difficulty in comprehending them from what he beheld from without. The
  entrance gates were open, and a wide archway beyond leading to the great
  quadrangle, gave him a view of its beautiful marble fountain in the midst,
  ornamented with exquisite statues of Venus and Cupid. Numerous officers of
  the household, pages, ushers, and serving-men in the royal liveries, with now
  and then some personage of distinction, were continually passing across the
  Fountain Court. Gaily attired courtiers, in doublets of satin and mantles of
  velvet, were lounging in the balconies of the presence-chamber, staring at
  Jocelyn and his companions for, want of better occupation. Other young
  nobles, accompanied by richly-habited dames&mdash;some of them the
  highest-born and loveliest in the land&mdash;were promenading to and fro upon
  the garden terrace on the right, chattering and laughing loudly. There was
  plenty of life and movement everywhere. Even in the Lord Chamberlain's walk,
  which, as we have said, was contrived in the upper part of the structure, and
  formed a sort of external gallery, three persons might be discerned; and to
  save the reader any speculation, we will tell him that these persons were the
  Duke of Lennox (Lord Chamberlain), the Conde de Gondomar (the Spanish
  lieger-ambassador), and the Lord Roos. In front of the great gates were
  stationed four warders with the royal badge woven in gold on the front and
  back of their crimson doublets, with roses in their velvet hats, roses in
  their buskins, and halberts over their shoulders. Just within the gates stood
  a gigantic porter, a full head and shoulders taller than the burly warders
  themselves. From the summit of the lofty central tower of the palace floated
  the royal banner, discernible by all the country round.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the tree against which Jocelyn was leaning, and
  looking down the long avenue, rather than towards the palace, stood Dick
  Taverner, who however bestowed little attention upon his master, being fully
  occupied by a more attractive object close at hand. Dickon, it appeared, had
  succeeded in inducing Gillian Greenford to accompany him in the expedition to
  Theobalds, and as the fair damsel could not of course go alone, she had
  cajoled her good-natured old grandsire into conveying her thither; and she
  was now seated behind him upon a pillion placed on the back of a strong,
  rough-coated, horse. Dick was in raptures at his success. The ride from
  Tottenham had been delightful. They had tarried for a short time to drink a
  cup of ale at the Bell at Edmonton, where Dick meant to have breakfasted,
  though chance had so agreeably prevented him, and where the liquor was highly
  approved by the old farmer, who became thenceforth exceedingly chatty, and
  talked of nothing else but good Queen Bess and her frequent visits to
  Theobalds in the old Lord Burleigh's time, during the rest of the journey.
  Little heed was paid to his garrulity by the young couple. They let him talk
  on, feigning to listen, but in reality noting scarce a word he said. As they
  entered the park of Theobalds, however, they found their tongues, and Gillian
  became loud in her admiration of the beautiful glades that opened before
  them, and of the dappled denizens of the wood that tripped lightsomely across
  the sward, or hurried towards the thickets. The park, indeed, looked
  beautiful with its fine oaks in their freshly-opened foliage of the tenderest
  green, its numerous spreading beeches, its scattered thorns white with
  blossom, and the young fern just springing from the seed in the brakes. No
  wonder Gillian was delighted. Dick was equally enchanted, and regretted he
  was not like King James, master of a great park, that he might hunt within it
  at his pleasure. Of course, if he had been king, Gillian would naturally have
  been his queen, and have hunted with him. Old Greenford, too, admired the
  scene, and could not but admit that the park was improved, though he uttered
  something like a groan as he thought that Queen Elizabeth and the Lord
  Treasurer could be seen in it no longer.</p>

  <p>After riding for a couple of miles along a road which led them over
  beautifully undulating ground, affording glimpses of every variety of forest
  scenery&mdash;sometimes plunging them into the depths of groves, where the
  path was covered by over-arching trees&mdash;sometimes crossing the open
  chace, studded by single aged oaks of the largest size&mdash;sometimes,
  skirting the margin of a pool, fringed with flags, reeds, and bulrushes for
  the protection of the water-fowl&mdash;now passing the large heronry, to the
  strict preservation of which James attached the utmost importance; they at
  length approached the long avenue leading to the palace. At its entrance they
  found Jocelyn waiting for them.</p>

  <p>The young man, who cared not for their company, had ridden on in advance.
  The strange events of the morning gave him plenty of material for reflection,
  and he longed to commune with himself. Accordingly, when the others stopped
  at Edmonton, he quitted them, promising to halt till they came up, before
  entering the precincts of the palace. If his ride was not so agreeable as
  their's, it at least enabled him to regain, in some degree, his composure of
  mind, which had been greatly disturbed by his abrupt parting with Aveline.
  Her image was constantly before him, and refusing to be dismissed, connected
  itself with every object he beheld. At first he despaired of meeting her
  again; but as he gradually grew calmer, his hopes revived, and difficulties
  which seemed insuperable began to disperse. By the time Dick Taverner and his
  companions came up, he felt some disposition to talk, and Gillian's hearty
  merriment and high spirits helped to enliven him. Having ascertained, from
  one of the royal keepers whom he had encountered, that the King, with a large
  company, was out hawking on the banks of the New River, which was cut through
  the park, and that he would in all probability return through the great
  avenue to the palace, he proposed that they should station themselves
  somewhere within it, in order to see him pass. This arrangement pleased all
  parties, so proceeding slowly up the avenue, they took up a position as
  described.</p>

  <p>More than an hour, however, elapsed, and still James, who no doubt was
  pleased with his sport, came not.</p>

  <p>Without being aware of their high quality, or having the slightest notion
  that the Conde Gondomar was one of them, Jocelyn had remarked the three
  personages in the Lord Chamberlain's Walk. He had seen them pause, and
  apparently look towards the little group of which he himself formed part.
  Shortly after this, two of the party retired, leaving the third alone in the
  gallery. By-and-by these two individuals were seen to cross the Fountain
  Court, and passing through the great gates, to direct their steps towards the
  avenue.</p>

  <p>As they approached, Jocelyn recognised one of them as Lord Roos, whom he
  had seen play so singular a part at Madame Bonaventure's ordinary. The other
  was wholly unknown to him. But that he was a person of the utmost distinction
  he felt convinced, as well from his haughty bearing and sumptuous attire, as
  from the evident respect paid him by his companion. In stature he was rather
  short, being somewhat under the ordinary standard; but his figure was
  admirably proportioned, and was displayed to the greatest advantage by his
  rich habiliments. His doublet was of sea-green satin, embroidered with silver
  and black, with rich open sleeves, and his Spanish cloak was of velvet of the
  same colour and similarly embroidered. His hose were of tawny silk, and the
  plumes in his bonnet black, striped with white. He was decorated with the
  order of the Golden Fleece, and bore at his side a genuine blade of Toledo,
  with a handle of rarest workmanship. Bound his throat he wore a large, triple
  ruff, edged with pointed lace. His face was oval in shape, his complexion of
  a rich olive hue, his eyes large, dark, and keen, his features singularly
  handsome, and his looks penetrating. His hair was raven-black, cut short, and
  removed from the forehead.</p>

  <p>Lord Roos and his companion passed close to Jocelyn without appearing to
  notice him; but they halted before Gillian, regarding her with insolent
  admiration. Evidently she was the object that had brought them forth. The
  poor damsel was terribly confused by their ardent glances and libertine
  scrutiny, and blushed to her very temples. As to Dick Taverner, he trembled
  with rage and jealousy, and began to repent having brought his treasure into
  such a dangerous neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>The person who seemed to be most struck with Gillian's charms was the
  wearer of the Spanish mantle.</p>

  <p>"En verdad!" he exclaimed, "that is the loveliest piece of rusticity I
  have seen since I came to England. I thought mine eyes did not deceive me, as
  to her beauty, when I caught sight of her from the Lord Chamberlain's
  gallery."</p>

  <p>"The Conde de Gondomar hath ever an eagle's eye for a pretty woman," Lord
  Roos replied, laughing.</p>

  <p>"The Conde de Gondomar!" mentally ejaculated Jocelyn, who had overheard
  what he said. "Why, this is he to whom the ring must be shown. The
  opportunity must not be lost."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, regardless of the impropriety of the proceeding, he uncovered
  his head, and advancing towards the Spaniard said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I believe I have the honour of addressing the Conde de Gondomar?"</p>

  <p>"What means this intrusion, Sir?" Lord Roos demanded insolently. "What
  have you to say to his Excellency?"</p>

  <p>"I bring him a token, my lord," the young man replied, exhibiting the
  ring, given him by the masked horseman, to the ambassador.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed De Gondomar, glancing at the ring, and then regarding
  Jocelyn steadfastly, "I must speak with this young man, my lord."</p>

  <p>"And abandon the damsel?" demanded Lord Roos.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;you must take care of her," De Gondomar replied in a
  low tone. "Can you not induce Lady Exeter to take her into her service?"</p>

  <p>"I will try," Lord Roos replied. "And see!" he added, pointing down the
  avenue, "the royal party is returning, so I can at once ascertain whether her
  ladyship will second your Excellency's designs."</p>

  <p>"Do so," said De Gondomar, "and I shall be for ever indebted to you. This
  girl has quite taken my fancy, and I must not lose her. And now, Sir," he
  added, stepping aside with Jocelyn, "you have brought me the token from my
  assured agent, and I understand from it that you are a person upon whom I may
  rely."</p>

  <p>"In all that beseems a gentleman and a man of honour and loyalty your
  Excellency may rely on me," Jocelyn replied.</p>

  <p>"I shall require nothing inconsistent with those principles," the Spanish
  Ambassador said. "This point disposed of, let me know how I can serve you,
  for I presume you have some request to prefer?"</p>

  <p>"Your Excellency can very materially serve me," Jocelyn returned. "I am in
  danger."</p>

  <p>"I thought as much," De Gondomar observed with a smile. "Since you have
  placed yourself under my protection, I will do my best to hold you harmless.
  But who is your enemy?"</p>

  <p>"I have two deadly enemies, Sir Giles Mompesson and Sir Francis Mitchell,"
  Jocelyn rejoined.</p>

  <p>"I know them well&mdash;instruments of Buckingham," said De Gondomar.
  "They are indeed dangerous enemies."</p>

  <p>"I have another yet more dangerous," returned Jocelyn. "I have reason to
  fear that, by boldness of speech I have incurred the enmity of the Marquis of
  Buckingham himself."</p>

  <p>"Ah! this, indeed, is serious," said De Gondomar.</p>

  <p>"I am threatened with arrest by the Star-Chamber," pursued Jocelyn; "so
  your Excellency will perceive that my position is fraught with extreme peril.
  Still I persuade myself, if I could obtain a hearing of the King, I should be
  able to set my enemies at defiance and obtain my right."</p>

  <p>De Gondomar smiled somewhat scornfully.</p>

  <p>"You will obtain little in that way," he said, "and your enemies will
  crush you effectually. But you must explain to me precisely how you are
  circumstanced, and I will then consider what can be done for you. And begin
  by acquainting me with your name and condition, for as yet I am entirely
  ignorant whom I am addressing."</p>

  <p>Upon this Jocelyn succinctly related to the Ambassador all such
  particulars of his history as have been laid before the reader. De Gondomar
  listened to him with attention, and put some questions to him as he
  proceeded. At its close his countenance brightened.</p>

  <p>"You are in an awkward dilemma, it must be owned, Master Jocelyn
  Mounchensey," he said. "But I think I can protect you in spite of them
  all&mdash;in spite of Buckingham himself. Luckily, he is not at Theobalds at
  present&mdash;so the coast is clear for action. The first blow is half the
  battle. I must present you to the King without delay. And see, his Majesty
  approaches. Stand close behind me, and act as I advise you by a sign."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-20"
     name="ch1-20">CHAPTER XX.<br>
  King James the First.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Meantime the royal cavalcade came slowly up the avenue. It
  was very numerous, and all the more brilliant in appearance, since it
  comprised nearly as many high-born dames as nobles. Amongst the distinguished
  foreigners who with their attendants swelled the party were the Venetian
  lieger-ambassador Giustiniano, and the Marquis de Tremouille, of the family
  des Ursins, ambassador from France.</p>

  <p>These exalted personages rode close behind the King, and one or the other
  of them was constantly engaged in conversation with him. Giustiniano had one
  of those dark, grave, handsome countenances familiarized to us by the
  portraits of Titian and Tintoretto, and even the King's jests failed in
  making him smile. He was apparelled entirely in black velvet, with a cloak
  bordered with the costly fur of the black fox. All his followers were
  similarly attired. The sombre Venetian presented a striking contrast to his
  vivacious companion, the gay and graceful De Tremouille, who glittered in
  white satin, embroidered with leaves of silver, while the same colour and the
  same ornaments were adopted by his retinue.</p>

  <p>No order of precedence was observed by the court nobles. Each rode as he
  listed. Prince Charles was absent, and so was the supreme favourite
  Buckingham; but their places were supplied by some of the chief personages of
  the realm, including the Earls of Arundel, Pembroke, and Montgomery, the
  Marquis of Hamilton, and the Lords Haddington, Fenton, and Doncaster.
  Intermingled with the nobles, the courtiers of lesser rank, and the
  ambassadors' followers, were the ladies, most of whom claimed attention from
  personal charms, rich attire, and the grace and skill with which they managed
  their horses.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most beautiful amongst them was the young Countess of Exeter,
  whose magnificent black eyes did great execution. The lovely Countess was
  mounted on a fiery Spanish barb, given to her by De Gondomar. Forced into a
  union with a gouty and decrepit old husband, the Countess of Exeter might
  have pleaded this circumstance in extenuation of some of her follies. It was
  undoubtedly an argument employed by her admirers, who, in endeavouring to
  shake her fidelity to her lord, told her it was an infamy that she should be
  sacrificed to such an old dotard as he. Whether these arguments prevailed in
  more cases than one we shall not inquire too nicely; but, if court-scandal
  may be relied on, they did&mdash;Buckingham and De Gondomar being both
  reputed to have been her lovers.</p>

  <p>The last, however, in the list, and the one who appeared to be most
  passionately enamoured of the beautiful Countess, and to receive the largest
  share of her regard, was Lord Roos; and as this culpable attachment and its
  consequences connect themselves intimately with our history we have been
  obliged to advert to them thus particularly. Lord Roos was a near relative of
  the Earl of Exeter; and although the infirm and gouty old peer had been
  excessively jealous of his lovely young wife on former occasions, when she
  had appeared to trifle with his honour, he seemed perfectly easy and
  unsuspicious now, though there was infinitely more cause for distrust.
  Possibly he had too much reliance on Lord Roos's good feelings and principles
  to suspect him.</p>

  <p>Very different was Lady Roos's conduct. This unhappy lady, whom we have
  already mentioned as the daughter of Sir Thomas Lake, Secretary of State, had
  the misfortune to be sincerely attached to her handsome but profligate
  husband, whose neglect and frequent irregularities she had pardoned, until
  the utter estrangement, occasioned by his passion for the Countess of Exeter,
  filled her with such trouble, that, overpowered at length by anguish, she
  complained to her mother Lady Lake,&mdash;an ambitious and imperious woman,
  whose vanity had prompted her to bring about this unfortunate match.
  Expressing the greatest indignation at the treatment her daughter had
  experienced, Lady Lake counselled her to resent it, undertaking herself to
  open the eyes of the injured Earl of Exeter to his wife's infidelity; but she
  was dissuaded from her purpose by Sir Thomas Lake. Though generally governed
  by his wife, Sir Thomas succeeded, in this instance, in over-ruling her
  design of proceeding at once to extremities with the guilty pair,
  recommending that, in the first instance, Lord Roos should be strongly
  remonstrated with by Lady Lake and her daughter, when perhaps his fears might
  be aroused, if his sense of duty could not be awakened.</p>

  <p>This final appeal had not yet been made; but an interview had taken place
  between Lady Roos and her husband, at which, with many passionate entreaties,
  she had implored him to shake off the thraldom in which he had bound himself,
  and to return to her, when all should be forgiven and forgotten,&mdash;but
  without effect.</p>

  <p>Thus matters stood at present.</p>

  <p>As we have seen, though the Countess of Exeter formed one of the chief
  ornaments of the hawking party, Lord Roos had not joined it; his absence
  being occasioned by a summons from the Conde de Gondomar, with some of whose
  political intrigues he was secretly mixed up. Whether the Countess missed him
  or not, we pretend not to say. All we are able to declare is, she was in high
  spirits, and seemed in no mood to check the advances of other aspirants to
  her favour. Her beautiful and expressive features beamed with constant
  smiles, and her lustrous black eyes seemed to create a flame wherever their
  beams alighted.</p>

  <p>But we must quit this enchantress and her spells, and proceed with the
  description of the royal party. In the rear of those on horseback walked the
  falconers, in liveries of green cloth, with bugles hanging from the shoulder;
  each man having a hawk upon his fist, completely 'tired in its hood, bells,
  varvels, and jesses. At the heels of the falconers, and accompanied by a
  throng of varlets, in russet jerkins, carrying staves, came two packs of
  hounds,&mdash;one used for what was termed, in the language of falconry, the
  Flight at the River,&mdash;these were all water-spaniels; and the other, for
  the Flight at the Field. Nice music they made, in spite of the efforts of the
  varlets in russet to keep them quiet.</p>

  <p>Hawking, in those days, was what shooting is in the present;
  fowling-pieces being scarcely used, if at all. Thus the varieties of the
  hawk-tribe were not merely employed in the capture of pheasants, partridges,
  grouse, rails, quails, and other game, besides water-fowl, but in the chase
  of hares; and in all of these pursuits the falconers were assisted by dogs.
  Game, of course, could only be killed at particular seasons of the year; and
  wild-geese, wild-ducks, woodcocks, and snipes in the winter; but spring and
  summer pastime was afforded by the crane, the bustard, the heron, the rook,
  and the kite; while, at the same periods, some of the smaller description of
  water-fowl offered excellent sport on lake or river.</p>

  <p>A striking and picturesque sight that cavalcade presented, with its
  nodding plumes of many colours, its glittering silks and velvets, its proud
  array of horsemen, and its still prouder array of lovely women, whose
  personal graces and charms baffle description, while they invite it. Pleasant
  were the sounds that accompanied the progress of the train: the jocund laugh,
  the musical voices of women, the jingling of bridles, the snorting and
  trampling of steeds, the baying of hounds, the shouts of the varlets, and the
  winding of horns.</p>

  <p>But having, as yet, omitted the principal figure, we must hasten to
  describe him by whom the party was headed. The King, then, was mounted on a
  superb milk-white steed, with wide-flowing mane and tail, and of the easiest
  and gentlest pace. Its colour was set off by its red chanfrein, its nodding
  crest of red feathers, its broad poitrinal with red tassels, and its saddle
  with red housings. Though devoted to the chase, as we have shown, James was
  but an indifferent horseman; and his safety in the saddle was assured by such
  high-bolstered bows in front and at the back, that it seemed next to
  impossible he could be shaken out of them. Yet, in spite of all these
  precautions, accidents had befallen him. On one occasion, Sir Symonds D'Ewes
  relates that he was thrown headlong into a pond; and on another, we learn
  from a different source that he was cast over his horse's head into the New
  River, and narrowly escaped drowning, his boots alone being visible above the
  ice covering the stream. Moreover the monarch's attire was excessively stiff
  and cumbrous, and this, while it added to the natural ungainliness of his
  person, prevented all freedom of movement, especially on horseback. His
  doublet, which on the present occasion was of green velvet, considerably
  frayed,&mdash;for he was by no means particular about the newness of his
  apparel,&mdash;was padded and quilted so as to be dagger-proof; and his hose
  were stuffed in the same manner, and preposterously large about the hips.
  Then his ruff was triple-banded, and so stiffly starched, that the head was
  fixed immovably amidst its plaits.</p>

  <p>Though not handsome, James's features were thoughtful and intelligent,
  with a gleam of cunning in the eye, and an expression of sarcasm about the
  mouth, and they contained the type of the peculiar physiognomy that
  distinguished all his unfortunate line. His beard was of a yellowish brown,
  and scantily covered his chin, and his thin moustaches were of a yet lighter
  hue. His hair was beginning to turn gray, but his complexion was ruddy and
  hale, proving that, but for his constant ebriety and indulgence in the
  pleasures of the table, he might have attained a good old age&mdash;if,
  indeed, his life was not unfairly abridged. His large eyes were for ever
  rolling about, and his tongue was too big for his mouth, causing him to
  splutter in utterance, besides giving him a disagreeable appearance when
  eating; while his legs were so weak, that he required support in walking.
  Notwithstanding these defects, and his general coarseness of manner, James
  was not without dignity, and could, when he chose, assume a right royal air
  and deportment. But these occasions were rare. As is well known, his pedantry
  and his pretensions to superior wisdom and discrimination, procured him the
  title of the "Scottish Solomon." His general character will be more fully
  developed as we proceed; and we shall show the perfidy and dissimulation
  which he practised in carrying out his schemes, and tried to soften down
  under the plausible appellation of "King-craft."</p>

  <p>James was never seen to greater advantage than on occasions like the
  present. His hearty enjoyment of the sport he was engaged in; his familiarity
  with all around him, even with the meanest varlets by whom he was attended,
  and for whom he had generally some droll nickname; his complete abandonment
  of all the etiquette which either he or his master of the ceremonies observed
  elsewhere; his good-tempered vanity and boasting about his skill as a
  woodsman,&mdash;all these things created an impression in his favour, which
  was not diminished in those who were not brought much into contact with him
  in other ways. When hunting or hawking, James was nothing more than a hearty
  country gentleman engaged in the like sports.</p>

  <p>The cavalcade came leisurely on, for the King proceeded no faster than
  would allow the falconers to keep easily up with those on horseback. He was
  in high good humour, and laughed and jested sometimes with one ambassador,
  sometimes with the other, and having finished a learned discussion on the
  manner of fleeing a hawk at the river and on the field, as taught by the
  great French authorities, Martin, Malopin, and Aimé Cassian, with the Marquis
  de Tremouille, had just begun a similar conversation with Giustiniano as to
  the Italian mode of manning, hooding, and reclaiming a falcon, as practised
  by Messer Francesco Sforzino Vicentino, when he caught sight of the Conde de
  Gondomar, standing where we left him at the side of the avenue, on which he
  came to a sudden halt, and the whole cavalcade stopped at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Salud! Conde magnifico!" exclaimed King James, as the Spaniard advanced
  to make his obeisance to him; "how is it that we find you standing under the
  shade of the tree friendly to the vine,&mdash;<i>amictoe vitibus ulmi</i> as
  Ovid hath it? Is it that yon blooming Chloe," he continued, leering
  significantly at Gillian, "hath more attraction for you than our court dames?
  Troth! the quean is not ill-favoured; but ye ha' lost a gude day's sport,
  Count, forbye ither losses which we sall na particularize. We hae had a noble
  flight at the heron, and anither just as guid after the bustard. God's santy!
  the run the lang-leggit loon gave us. Lady Exeter, on her braw Spanish
  barb&mdash;we ken whose gift it is&mdash;was the only one able to keep with
  us; and it was her leddyship's ain peregrine falcon that checked the fleeing
  carle at last. By our faith the Countess understands the gentle science weel.
  She cared not to soil her dainty gloves by rewarding her hawk with a
  <i>soppa</i>, as his Excellency Giustiniano would term it, of the bustard's
  heart, bluid, and brains. But wha hae ye gotten wi' ye?" he added, for the
  first time noticing Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>"A young gentleman in whom I am much interested, and whom I would crave
  permission to present to your Majesty," replied De Gondomar.</p>

  <p>"Saul of our body, Count, the permission is readily granted," replied
  James, evidently much pleased with the young man's appearance. "Ye shall
  bring him to us in the privy-chamber before we gang to supper, and moreover
  ye shall hae full licence to advance what you please in his behoof. He is a
  weel-grown, weel-favoured laddie, almost as much sae as our ain dear dog
  Steenie; but we wad say to him, in the words of the Roman bard,</p>

  <p>'O formose puer, nimium ne crede colori!'</p>

  <p>Gude pairts are better than gude looks; not that the latter are to be
  undervalued, but baith should exist in the same person. We shall soon
  discover whether the young man hath been weel nurtured, and if all correspond
  we shall not refuse him the light of our countenance."</p>

  <p>"I tender your Majesty thanks for the favour you have conferred upon him,"
  replied De Gondomar.</p>

  <p>"But ye have not yet tauld us the youth's name, Count?" said the King.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty, I trust, will not think I make a mystery where none is
  needed, if I say that my protegé claims your gracious permission to preserve,
  for the moment, his incognito," De Gondomar replied. "When I present him of
  course his name will be declared."</p>

  <p>"Be it as you will, Count," James replied. "We ken fu' weel ye hae gude
  reason for a' ye do. Fail not in your attendance on us at the time
  appointed."</p>

  <p>As De Gondomar with a profound obeisance drew back, the King put his steed
  in motion. General attention having been thus called to Jocelyn, all eyes
  were turned towards him, his appearance and attire were criticised, and much
  speculation ensued as to what could be the Spanish Ambassador's motive for
  undertaking the presentation.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lord Roos had taken advantage of the brief halt of the hunting
  party to approach the Countess of Exeter, and pointing out Gillian to her,
  inquired in a low tone, and in a few words, to which, however, his looks
  imparted significance, whether she would take the pretty damsel into her
  service as tire-woman or handmaiden. The Countess seemed surprised at the
  request, and, after glancing at the Beauty of Tottenham, was about to refuse
  it, when Lord Roos urged in a whisper, "'T is for De Gondomar I ask the
  favour."</p>

  <p>"In that case I readily assent," the Countess replied. "I will go speak to
  the damsel at once, if you desire it. How pretty she is! No wonder his
  inflammable Excellency should be smitten by her." And detaching her barb, as
  she spoke, from the cavalcade, she moved towards Gillian, accompanied by Lord
  Roos. The pretty damsel was covered with fresh confusion at the great lady's
  approach; and was, indeed, so greatly alarmed, that she might have taken to
  her heels, if she had been on the ground, and not on the pillion behind her
  grandsire.</p>

  <p>"Be not abashed, my pretty maiden," the Countess said, in a kind and
  encouraging tone; "there is nothing to be afraid of. Aware that I am in want
  of a damsel like yourself, to tire my hair and attend upon me, Lord Roos has
  drawn my attention to you; and if I may trust to appearances&mdash;as I think
  I may," she added, with a very flattering and persuasive smile, "in your
  case&mdash;you are the very person to suit me, provided you are willing to
  enter my service. I am the Countess of Exeter."</p>

  <p>"A Countess!" exclaimed Gillian. "Do you hear that, grandsire? The
  beautiful lady is a countess. What an honour it would be to serve her!"</p>

  <p>"It might be," the old man replied, with hesitation, and in a whisper;
  "yet I do not exactly like the manner of it."</p>

  <p>"Don't accept the offer, Gillian. Don't go," said Dick Taverner, whose
  breast was full of uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"Your answer, my pretty maiden?" the Countess said, with a winning
  smile.</p>

  <p>"I am much beholden to you, my lady," Gillian replied, "and it will
  delight me to serve you as you propose&mdash;that is, if I have my
  grandsire's consent to it."</p>

  <p>"And the good man, I am sure, has your welfare too much at heart to
  withhold it," the Countess replied. "But follow me to the palace, and we will
  confer further upon the matter. Inquire for the Countess of Exeter's
  apartments." And with another gracious smile, she rejoined the cavalcade,
  leaving Lord Roos behind. He thanked her with a look for her
  complaisance.</p>

  <p>"O Gillian, I am sure ill will come of this," Dick Taverner exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Wherefore should it?" she rejoined, almost beside herself with delight at
  the brilliant prospect suddenly opened before her. "My fortune is made."</p>

  <p>"You are right, my pretty damsel, it is," Lord Roos remarked. "Fail not to
  do as the Countess has directed you, and I will answer for the rest."</p>

  <p>"You hear what the kind young nobleman says, grandsire?" Gillian whispered
  in his ear. "You cannot doubt his assurance?"</p>

  <p>"I hear it all," old Greenford replied; "but I know not what to think. I
  suppose we must go to the palace."</p>

  <p>"To be sure we must," Gillian cried; "I will go there alone, if you will
  not go with me."</p>

  <p>Satisfied with what he had heard, Lord Roos moved away, nodding approval
  at Gillian.</p>

  <p>The cavalcade, as we have said, was once more in motion, but before it had
  proceeded far, it was again, most unexpectedly, brought to a halt.</p>

  <p>Suddenly stepping from behind a large tree which had concealed him from
  view, a man in military habiliments, with grizzled hair and beard, and an
  exceedingly resolute and stern cast of countenance, planted himself directly
  in the monarch's path, and extending his hand towards him, exclaimed, in a
  loud voice,</p>

  <p>"Stand! O King!"</p>

  <p>"Who art thou, fellow? and what wouldst thou?" demanded James, who had
  checked his horse with such suddenness as almost to throw himself out of his
  high-holstered saddle.</p>

  <p>"I have a message to deliver to thee from Heaven," replied Hugh
  Calveley.</p>

  <p>"Aha!" exclaimed James, recovering in some degree, for he thought he had a
  madman to deal with. "What may thy message be?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"

  </div>

  <p>And willing to gain a character for courage, though it was wholly foreign
  to his nature, he motioned those around him to keep back. "Thy message,
  fellow!" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Hear, then, what Heaven saith to thee," the Puritan replied. "Have I not
  brought thee out of a land of famine into a land of plenty? Thou oughtest,
  therefore, to have judged my people righteously! But thou hast perverted
  justice, and not relieved the oppressed. Therefore, unless thou repent, I
  will rend thy kingdom from thee, and from thy posterity after thee! Thus
  saith the Lord, whose messenger I am."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-21"
     name="ch1-21">CHAPTER XXI.<br>
  Consequences of the Puritan's Warning.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Coupling Hugh Calveley's present strange appearance and
  solemn warning with his previous denunciations uttered in secret, and his
  intimations of some dread design, with which he had sought to connect the
  young man himself, intimating that its execution would jeopardize his life;
  putting these things together, we say, Jocelyn could not for an instant doubt
  that the King was in imminent danger, and he felt called upon to interfere,
  even though he should be compelled to act against his father's friend, and
  the father of Aveline. No alternative, in fact, was allowed him. As a loyal
  subject, his duty imperiously required him to defend his sovereign; and
  perceiving that no one (in consequence of the King's injunctions) advanced
  towards the Puritan, Jocelyn hastily quitted the Conde de Gondomar, and
  rushing forward stationed himself between the monarch and his bold
  admonisher; and so near to the latter, that he could easily prevent any
  attack being made by him upon James.</p>

  <p>Evidently disconcerted by the movement, Hugh Calveley signed to the young
  man to stand aside, but Jocelyn refused compliance; the rather that he
  suspected from the manner in which the other placed his hand in his breast
  that he had some weapon concealed about his person. Casting a look of
  bitterest reproach at him, which plainly as words said&mdash;"Ungrateful boy,
  thou hast prevented my purpose," the Puritan folded his hands upon his breast
  with an air of deep disappointment.</p>

  <p>"Fly!" cried Jocelyn, in a tone calculated only to reach his ears. "I will
  defend you with my life. Waste not another moment&mdash;fly!"</p>

  <p>But Hugh Calveley regarded him with cold disdain, and though he moved not
  his lips, he seemed to say, "You have destroyed me; and I will not remove the
  guilt of my destruction from your head."</p>

  <p>The Puritan's language and manner had filled James with astonishment and
  fresh alarm; but feeling secure in the propinquity of Jocelyn to the object
  of his uneasiness, and being closely environed by his retinue, the foremost
  of whom had drawn their swords and held themselves in readiness to defend him
  from the slightest hostile attempt, it was not unnatural that even so
  timorous a person as he, should regain his confidence. Once more, therefore,
  he restrained by his gestures the angry impetuosity of the nobles around him,
  who were burning to chastise the rash intruder, and signified his intention
  of questioning him before any measures were adopted against him.</p>

  <p>"Let him be," he cried. "He is some puir demented creature fitter for
  Bedlam than anywhere else; and we will see that he be sent thither; but
  molest him not till we hae spoken wi' him, and certified his condition more
  fully. Quit not the position ye hae sae judiciously occupied, young Sir,
  albeit against our orders," he cried to Jocelyn. "Dinna draw your blade
  unless the fellow seeks to come till us. Not that we are under ony
  apprehension; but there are bluidthirsty traitors even in our pacific
  territories, and as this may be ane of them, it is weel not to neglect due
  precaution. And now, man," he added, raising his voice, and addressing the
  Puritan, who still maintained a steadfast and unmoved demeanour, with his eye
  constantly fixed upon his interrogator. "Ye say ye are a messenger frae
  heaven. An it be sae,&mdash;whilk we take leave to doubt, rather conceiving
  ye to be an envoy from the Prince of Darkness than an ambassador from
  above,&mdash;an ill choice hath been made in ye. Unto what order of prophets
  do ye conceive yourself to belong?"</p>

  <p>To this interrogation, propounded in a jeering tone, the Puritan deigned
  no reply; but an answer was given for him by Archee, the court jester, who
  had managed in the confusion to creep up to his royal master's side.</p>

  <p>"He belongs to the order of Melchisedec," said Archee. A reply that
  occasioned some laughter among the nobles, in which the King joined
  heartily.</p>

  <p>"Tut, fule! ye are as daft as the puir body before us," cried James. "Ken
  ye not that Melchisedec was a priest and not a prophet; while to judge frae
  yon fellow's abulyiements, if he belongs to any church at all, it maun be to
  the church militant. And yet, aiblins, ye are na sae far out after a'. Like
  aneuch, he may be infected with the heresy of the Melchisedecians,&mdash;a
  pestilent sect, who plagued the early Christian Church sairly, placing their
  master aboon our Blessed Lord himself, and holding him to be identical wi'
  the Holy Ghaist. Are ye a Melchisedecian, sirrah?"</p>

  <p>"I am a believer in the Gospel," the Puritan replied. "And am willing to
  seal my faith in it with my blood. I am sent hither to warn thee, O King, and
  thou wilt do well not to despise my words. Repent ere it be too late.
  Wonderfully hath thy life been preserved. Dedicate the remainder of thy days
  to the service of the Most High. Persecute not His people, and revile them
  not. Purge thy City of its uncleanness and idolatry, and thy Court of its
  corruption. Profane not the Sabbath"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I see how it is," interrupted Archee with a scream; "the man hath been
  driven stark wud by your Majesty's Book of Sports."</p>

  <p>"A book devised by the devil," cried Hugh Calveley, catching at the
  suggestion; "and which ought to be publicly burnt by the hangman, instead of
  being read in the churches. How much, mischief hath that book done! How many
  abominations hath it occasioned! And, alas! how much persecution hath it
  caused; for have not many just men, and sincere preachers of the Word, been
  prosecuted in thy Court, misnamed of justice, and known, O King! as the
  Star-Chamber; suffering stripes and imprisonment for refusing to read thy
  mischievous proclamation to their flocks."</p>

  <p>"I knew it!&mdash;I knew it!" screamed Archee, delighted with the effect
  he had produced. "Take heed, sirrah," he cried to the Puritan, "that ye make
  not acquaintance wi' 'that Court misnamed of justice' yer ain sell."</p>

  <p>"He is liker to be arraigned at our court styled the King's Bench, and
  hanged, drawn, and quartered afterwards," roared James, far more enraged at
  the disrespectful mention made of his manifesto, than by anything that had
  previously occurred. "The man is not sae doited as we supposed him."</p>

  <p>"He is not sane enough to keep his neck from the halter," rejoined Archee.
  "Your Majesty should spare him, since you are indirectly the cause of his
  malady."</p>

  <p>"Intercede not for me," cried Hugh Calveley. "I would not accept any grace
  at the tyrant's hands. Let him hew me in pieces, and my blood shall cry out
  for vengeance upon his head."</p>

  <p>"By our halidame! a dangerous traitor!" exclaimed James.</p>

  <p>"Hear me, O King!" thundered the Puritan. "For the third and last time I
  lift up my voice to warn thee. Visions have appeared to me in the night, and
  mysterious voices have whispered in mine ear. They have revealed to me
  strange and terrible things&mdash;but not more strange and terrible than
  true. They have told me how thy posterity shall suffer for the injustice thou
  doest to thy people. They have shown me a scaffold which a King shall
  mount&mdash;and a block whereon a royal head shall be laid. But it shall be
  better for that unfortunate monarch, though he be brought to judgment by his
  people, than for him who shall be brought to judgment by his God. Yet more. I
  have seen in my visions two Kings in exile: one of whom shall be recalled,
  but the other shall die in a foreign land. As to thee, thou mayst live on yet
  awhile in fancied security. But destruction shall suddenly overtake thee.
  Thou shalt be stung to death by the serpent thou nourishest in thy
  bosom."</p>

  <p>Whatever credit might be attached to them, the Puritan's prophetic
  forebodings produced, from the manner in which they were delivered, a strong
  impression upon all his auditors. Unquestionably the man was in earnest, and
  spoke like one who believed that a mission had been entrusted to him. No
  interruption was offered to his speech, even by the King, though the latter
  turned pale as these terrible coming events were shadowed forth before
  him.</p>

  <p>"His words are awsome," he muttered, "and gar the flesh creep on our
  banes. Will nane o' ye stap his tongue?"</p>

  <p>"Better hae stapt it afore this," said Archee; "he has said ower meikle,
  or not aneuch, The Deil's malison on thee, fellow, for a prophet of ill! Hast
  thou aught to allege why his Majesty should not tuck thee up with a
  halter?"</p>

  <p>"I have spoken," responded the Puritan; "let the King do with me what he
  lists."</p>

  <p>"Seize him! arrest him! ye are nearest to him, Sir," shouted the king to
  Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>The command could not be disobeyed. As Jocelyn drew near, and laid his
  hand upon Hugh Calveley, the latter looked reproachfully at him, saying,
  "Thou doest well, son of my old friend."</p>

  <p>Jocelyn was unable to reply, for a crowd now pressed forward on all sides,
  completely surrounding the prisoner. Some of the nobles threatened him with
  their swords, and the warders, who had come up from the gateway, thrust at
  him with their partizans. Jocelyn had great difficulty in shielding him from
  the infuriated throng.</p>

  <p>"Touch him not!" he cried, clearing a space around them with the point of
  his sword. "His Majesty has committed him to my custody, and I am responsible
  for him. Pardon me if I disarm you, Sir," he added in an undertone to the
  prisoner.</p>

  <p>"Here is my sword," replied Hugh Calveley, unbuckling his belt and
  delivering up the weapon it sustained to Jocelyn; "it hath never been
  dishonoured, and," he added, lowering his voice, "it hath been twice drawn in
  thy father's defence."</p>

  <p>The reproach cut Jocelyn to the heart.</p>

  <p>At this moment the crowd drew aside to allow the King's approach.</p>

  <p>"Hath he been searched to see whether any deadly or offensive weapon is
  concealed about him?" demanded James.</p>

  <p>"He cannot have any more offensive weapon than his tongue," cried Archee,
  who accompanied his royal master. "I counsel your Majesty to deprive him of
  that."</p>

  <p>"There is something hidden in his breast," cried one of the warders,
  searching in his jerkin, and at length drawing forth a short, clumsy pistol,
  or dag, as the weapon was then called. "It is loaded, an please your
  Majesty," the man continued, after examining it.</p>

  <p>Exclamations of horror arose from those around, and Jocelyn had again some
  difficulty in protecting the prisoner from their fury.</p>

  <p>"A dag!" ejaculated James, "a loaded dag, crammed to the muzzle wi'
  bullets, nae doubt. Haud it down, man! haud it down! it may fire off of
  itsel', and accomplish the villain's murtherous and sacrilegious design. And
  sae this was to be the instrument of our destruction! Dost thou confess thy
  guilt, thou bluid-thirsty traitor, or shall the torture force the truth from
  thee?"</p>

  <p>"The torture will force nothing from me," replied Hugh Calveley. "But I
  tell thee, tyrant, that I would have slain thee, had not my hand been
  stayed."</p>

  <p>"Heard ye ever the like o' that?" exclaimed James, his ruddy cheek
  blanched with fright, and his voice quavering. "Why, he exceedeth in audacity
  the arch-traitor Fawkes himsel'. And what stayed thy hand, villain?" he
  demanded,&mdash;"what stayed thy hand, thou blood-thirsty traitor?"</p>

  <p>"The presence of this youth, Jocelyn Mounchensey," rejoined Hugh Calveley.
  "Had he not come between us when he did, and checked my purpose, I had
  delivered my country from oppression. I told thee, tyrant, thou hadst been
  marvellously preserved. Thy preserver stands before thee."</p>

  <p>"Heaven defend us!" exclaimed James, trembling. "What an escape we hae
  had. There hath been a special interposition o' Providence in our behoof. Our
  gratitude is due to Him who watcheth ower us."</p>

  <p>"And in some degree to him who hath been made the instrument of your
  Majesty's preservation," observed the Conde de Gondomar, who formed one of
  the group near the King. "Since the foul traitor hath proclaimed the name of
  my young protegé", there can be no need for further concealment. Master
  Jocelyn Mounchensey hath been singularly fortunate in rendering your Majesty
  a service, and may for ever congratulate himself on his
  share&mdash;accidental though it be&mdash;in this affair."</p>

  <p>"By my halidame! he shall have reason for congratulation," cried James,
  graciously regarding the young man.</p>

  <p>"Ay, let him rise by my fall. 'Tis meet he should," cried the Puritan,
  bitterly. "Shower thy honours upon him, tyrant. Give him wealth and titles. I
  could not wish him worse misfortune than thy favour."</p>

  <p>"Hold thy scurril tongue, villain, or it shall be torn out by the roots,"
  said James. "Thou shalt see that I can as promptly reward those that serve
  me, as thou shalt presently feel I can severely punish those that seek to
  injure me. Hark ye, Count!" he added to the Spanish Ambassador, while those
  around drew back a little, seeing it was his Majesty's pleasure to confer
  with him in private, "this youth&mdash;this Jocelyn Mounchensey, hath gentle
  bluid in his veins?&mdash;he comes of a good stock, ha?"</p>

  <p>"He is the representative of an old Norfolk family," De Gondomar
  replied.</p>

  <p>"What! the son of Sir Ferdinando?" demanded James, a shade crossing his
  countenance, which did not escape the wily ambassador's notice.</p>

  <p>"You have guessed right, Sire," he said. "This is Sir Ferdinando's son;
  and, if I may be permitted to say so, your Majesty owes him some reparation
  for the wrongs done his father."</p>

  <p>"How! Count!" exclaimed James, with a look of slight displeasure. "Do you
  venture to question our judgments on hearsay&mdash;for ye can know naething
  o' your ain knowledge?"</p>

  <p>"I know enough to be satisfied that misrepresentations were made to your
  Majesty respecting this young man's father," De Gondomar replied; "for I am
  well assured that if you ever erred at all, it must have been through
  ignorance, and want of due information. This was what I designed to explain
  more fully than I can well do now, when I availed myself of your Majesty's
  gracious permission to bring the young man into your presence; and I should
  then have taken leave to express how much he merited your Majesty's favour
  and protection. Fortune, however, has outrun my wishes, and given him a
  stronger claim upon you than any I could urge."</p>

  <p>"Ye are right, Count," rejoined James cautiously. "He hath the strongest
  claim upon us, and he shall not find us ungrateful. We will confer wi'
  Steenie&mdash;wi' Buckingham, we mean&mdash;about him."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, Sire," said De Gondomar, "if I venture to suggest that your
  Majesty hath an admirable opportunity, which I should be sorry to see
  neglected, of showing your goodness and clemency, and silencing for ever the
  voice of calumny, which will sometimes be raised against you."</p>

  <p>"What mean ye, Count?" cried James. "Ye wad na hae me pardon yon
  traitor?"</p>

  <p>"Most assuredly not, Sire," De Gondomar rejoined. "But I would urge some
  present mark of favour for him who hath saved you from the traitor's fell
  designs. And I am emboldened to ask this, because I feel assured it must be
  consonant to your Majesty's own inclinations to grant the request."</p>

  <p>"It is sae, Count," rejoined James. "We only desired to consult wi'
  Buckingham to ascertain whether he had ony objections; but as this is
  altogether unlikely, we will follow our ain inclinations and do as your
  Excellency suggests."</p>

  <p>De Gondomar could scarcely conceal his satisfaction.</p>

  <p>At this moment Lord Roos pressed towards the King.</p>

  <p>"I have something to say in reference to this young man, my liege," he
  cried.</p>

  <p>"In his favour?" demanded the King.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes; in his favour, Sire," said De Gondomar, looking hard at the
  young nobleman. "You need not trouble his Majesty further, my lord. He is
  graciously pleased to accede to our wishes."</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay; nae mair need be said," cried James. "Let the young man stand
  forward."</p>

  <p>And as Jocelyn obeyed the injunction which was immediately communicated to
  him by De Gondomar, the King bade him kneel down, and taking Lord Roos's
  sword, touched him with it upon the shoulder, exclaiming, "Arise! Sir
  Jocelyn."</p>

  <p>"You are safe now," whispered De Gondomar. "This is the first blow, and it
  has been well struck."</p>

  <p>So confused was the new-made knight by the honour thus unexpectedly
  conferred upon him, that when he rose to his feet he could scarcely command
  himself sufficiently to make the needful obeisance, and tender thanks to the
  King. For a moment, his brow was flushed with pride, and his breast beat
  high; but the emotions were instantly checked, as he thought how the title
  had been purchased. Looking towards the prisoner, he beheld him in the hands
  of the warders, to whose custody he had been committed, with his arms bound
  behind him by thongs. His gaze had never quitted the young man during the
  ceremony which had just taken place, and he still regarded him sternly and
  reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"Let the prisoner be removed, and kept in a place of safety till our
  pleasure respecting him be made known," cried James. "And now, my lords and
  ladies, let us forward to the palace."</p>

  <p>And the cavalcade was once more put in motion, and passing through the
  great gateway entered the Fountain Court, where the nobility of both sexes
  dismounted, while their attendants and the falconers and varlets passed off
  to the offices.</p>

  <p>The prisoner was conveyed to the porter's lodge, and strictly guarded,
  till some secure chamber could be prepared for him. On the way thither
  Jocelyn contrived to approach him, and to say in a low tone&mdash;"Can I do
  aught for Aveline?"</p>

  <p>"Concern not yourself about her, <i>Sir</i> Jocelyn," rejoined Hugh
  Calveley, with stern contempt. "She is in a place of safety. You will never
  behold her more."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-22"
     name="ch1-22">CHAPTER XXII.<br>
  Wife and Mother-in-Law.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Quick steps descended the narrow staircase&mdash;steps so
  light and cautious that they made no sound. Before drawing aside the arras
  that covered the secret entrance to the chamber, the lady paused to listen;
  and hearing nothing to alarm her, she softly raised a corner of the woof and
  looked in.</p>

  <p>What did she behold? A young man seated beside a carved oak table, with
  his back towards her. He was reading a letter, the contents of which seemed
  greatly to disturb him, for he more than once dashed it aside, and then
  compelled himself to resume its perusal. No one else was in the room, which
  was spacious and lofty, though somewhat sombre, being wholly furnished with
  dark oak; while the walls were hung with ancient tapestry. Heavy curtains
  were drawn before the deep bay windows, increasing the gloom. The chamber was
  lighted by a brass lamp suspended from the moulded ceiling, the ribs of which
  were painted, and the bosses, at the intersections, gilded. Near the
  concealed entrance where the lady stood was placed a large curiously-carved
  ebony cabinet, against which leaned a suit of tilting armour and a lance;
  while on its summit were laid a morion, a brigandine, greaves, gauntlets, and
  other pieces of armour. On the right of the cabinet the tapestry was looped
  aside, disclosing a short flight of steps, terminated by the door of an
  anti-chamber.</p>

  <p>Almost as the lady set foot within the room, which she did after a brief
  deliberation, dropping the arras noiselessly behind her, the young man arose.
  Her entrance had not been perceived, so violently was he agitated. Crushing
  the letter which had excited him so much between his fingers, and casting it
  furiously from him, he gave vent to an incoherent expression of rage. Though
  naturally extremely handsome, his features at this moment were so distorted
  by passion that they looked almost hideous. In person he was slight and
  finely-formed; and the richness of his attire proclaimed him of rank.</p>

  <p>The lady who, unperceived, had witnessed his violent emotion was
  remarkably beautiful. Her figure was superb; and she had the whitest neck and
  arms imaginable, and the smallest and most delicately-formed hands. Her
  features derived something of haughtiness from a slightly aquiline nose and a
  short curled upper lip. Her eyes were magnificent&mdash;large, dark, and
  almost Oriental in shape and splendour. Jetty brows, and thick, lustrous,
  raven hair, completed the catalogue of her charms. Her dress was of white
  brocade, over which she wore a loose robe of violet-coloured velvet, with
  open hanging sleeves, well calculated to display the polished beauty of her
  arms. Her ruff was of point lace, and round her throat she wore a carcanet of
  pearls, while other precious stones glistened in her dusky tresses.</p>

  <p>This beautiful dame, whose proud lips were now more compressed than usual,
  and whose dark eyes emitted fierce rays&mdash;very different from their
  customary tender and voluptuous glances&mdash;was the Countess of Exeter. He
  whom she looked upon was Lord Roos, and the chamber she had just entered was
  the one assigned to the young nobleman in the Palace of Theobalds.</p>

  <p>She watched him for some time with curiosity. At length his rage found
  vent in words.</p>

  <p>"Perdition seize them both!" he exclaimed, smiting his forehead with his
  clenched hand. "Was ever man cursed with wife and mother-in-law like mine!
  They will, perforce, drive me to desperate measures, which I would willingly
  avoid; but if nothing else will keep them quiet, the grave must. Ay, the
  grave," he repeated in a hollow voice; "it is not my fault if I am compelled
  to send them thither. Fools to torment me thus!"</p>

  <p>Feeling she had heard more than she ought, the Countess would have
  retired; but as retreat might have betrayed her, she deemed it better to
  announce her presence by saying,</p>

  <p>"You are not alone, my Lord."</p>

  <p>Startled by her voice, Lord Roos instantly turned, and regarded her with
  haggard looks.</p>

  <p>"You here, Frances?" he exclaimed; "I did not expect you so soon."</p>

  <p>"I came before the hour, because&mdash;but you seem greatly agitated. Has
  anything happened?"</p>

  <p>"Little more than what happens daily," he replied. "And yet it
  <i>is</i>more; for the crisis has arrived, and a fearful crisis it is. O,
  Frances!" he continued vehemently, "how dear you are to me. To preserve your
  love I would dare everything, even my soul's welfare. I would hesitate at no
  crime to keep you ever near me. Let those beware who would force you from
  me."</p>

  <p>"What means this passion, my Lord?" inquired the Countess.</p>

  <p>"It means that since there are those who will mar our happiness; who,
  jealous of our loves, will utterly blight and destroy them; who will tear us
  forcibly asunder, recking little of the anguish they occasion: since we have
  enemies who will do this; who will mortally wound us&mdash;let us no longer
  hesitate, but strike the first blow. We must rid ourselves of them at any
  cost, and in any way."</p>

  <p>"I will not affect to misunderstand you, my Lord," the Countess replied,
  her beautiful features beginning to exhibit traces of terror. "But has it
  arrived at this point? Is the danger imminent and inevitable?"</p>

  <p>"Imminent, but not inevitable," Lord Roos rejoined. "It <i>can</i> be
  avoided, as I have hinted, in one way, and in one way only. There is a letter
  I have just received from my wife; wherein, after her usual upbraidings,
  remonstrances, and entreaties, she concludes by saying, that if I continue
  deaf to her prayers, and refuse to break off entirely with you, and return to
  her, our 'criminal attachment,'&mdash;for so she terms our love&mdash;should
  be divulged to the deluded Earl of Exeter, who will know how to redress her
  wrongs, and avenge his own injured honour. What answer, save one, can be
  returned to that letter, Frances? If we set her at defiance, as we have
  hitherto done, she will act, for she is goaded on by that fury, her mother.
  We must gain a little time, in order that the difficulties now besetting us
  may be effectually removed."</p>

  <p>"I shudder to think of it, William," said the Countess, trembling and
  turning deathly pale. "No; it must not be. Rather than such a crime should be
  committed, I will comply with their demand."</p>

  <p>"And leave me?" cried Lord Roos, bitterly. "Frances, your affection is not
  equal to mine, or you could not entertain such a thought for a moment. You
  almost make me suspect," he added, sternly, "that you have transferred your
  love to another. Ah! beware! beware! I am not to be trifled with, like your
  husband."</p>

  <p>"I forgive you the doubt, my Lord&mdash;unjust though it be&mdash;because
  your mind is disturbed; but were you calm enough to view the matter as it
  really is, you would perceive that my resolution has nothing in it
  inconsistent with affection for you; but rather that my very love for you
  compels me to the step. What <i>I</i> propose is best for both of us. The
  remedy you suggest would work our ruin here and hereafter; would drive us
  from society, and render us hateful to each other. My soul revolts at it. And
  though I myself have received a mortal affront from your wife's mother, Lady
  Lake; though she has poured forth all the malice of which she is capable upon
  my devoted head; yet I would rather forgive her&mdash;rather sue for pity
  from her than go the fearful length you propose. No, William. The pang of
  parting from you will indeed be terrible, but it must be endured. Fate wills
  it so, and it is therefore useless to struggle against it."</p>

  <p>"O, recall those words, Frances!" cried the young nobleman, throwing
  himself at her feet, and clasping her hands passionately. "Recall them, I
  implore' of you. In uttering them you pronounce my doom&mdash;a doom more
  dreadful than death, which would be light in comparison with losing you.
  Plunge this sword to my heart," he exclaimed, plucking the shining weapon
  from his side, and presenting it to her. "Free me from my misery at once, but
  do not condemn me to lingering agony."</p>

  <p>"Rise, William! rise, I pray of you," ejaculated the Countess, overcome by
  the intensity of his emotion, "and put up your sword. The love you display
  for me deserves an adequate return, and it shall meet it. Come what will, I
  will not leave you. But, O! let us not plunge deeper in guilt if it can be
  avoided."</p>

  <p>"But how <i>can</i> it be avoided?" cried Lord Roos. "Will <i>they</i>
  listen to our prayers? Will <i>they</i> pity us? Will <i>they</i> hesitate at
  our destruction?"</p>

  <p>"I know not&mdash;I know not," replied the Countess, bewildered; "but I
  stand appalled before the magnitude of the offence."</p>

  <p>"They will <i>not</i> spare us," pursued Lord Roos; "and therefore we
  cannot spare them."</p>

  <p>"In my turn I bend to you, William," said the Countess, sinking on her
  knee before him, and taking his hand. "By the love you bear me, I beseech you
  not to harm your wife! We have wronged her deeply&mdash;let us not have her
  death to answer for. If the blow <i>must</i> fall, let it be upon the
  mother's head. I have less compassion for her."</p>

  <p>"Lady Lake deserves no compassion," replied Lord Roos, raising the
  Countess, and embracing her tenderly, "for she is the cause of all this
  mischief. It is to her agency we owe the storm which threatens us with ruin.
  But things have gone too far now to show compunction for either of them. Our
  security demands that both should be removed."</p>

  <p>"I may now say as you have just said, William, and with, far greater
  reason," cried the Countess, "that you love me not, or you would not refuse
  my request."</p>

  <p>"How can I comply with it?" he rejoined. "Nothing were done, if only
  partly done. Know you the charge that Lady Roos means to bring against you?
  Though alike false and improbable, it is one to find easy credence with the
  King; and it has been framed with that view. You will understand this, when I
  tell you what it is. In this letter," he added, picking up the paper he had
  thrown down, and unfolding it, "she accuses you of practising sorcery to
  enslave my affections. She declares you have bewitched me; and that she has
  proof of the manner in which it was done, and of the sinful compact you have
  entered into for the purpose."</p>

  <p>"O William! this is false&mdash;utterly false!" exclaimed the Countess, in
  despair.</p>

  <p>"I know it," he rejoined. "You have no need to practise other enchantments
  with me than those you possess by nature. But what I tell you will show you
  the extent of their malice, and steel your heart, as it hath already steeled
  mine, against them."</p>

  <p>"But this accusation is too monstrous. It will not be believed," cried the
  Countess.</p>

  <p>"Monstrous as it is, it is more likely to be believed&mdash;more certain
  to be maintained&mdash;than the other which they lay at our door. We may deny
  all their assertions; may intimidate or give the lie to the witnesses they
  may produce against us; may stamp as forgeries your letters which have
  unluckily fallen into their hands; but if this charge of witchcraft be once
  brought against you, it will not fall to the ground. The King will listen to
  it, because it flatters his prejudices; and even my voice would fail to save
  you from condemnation&mdash;from the stake."</p>

  <p>"Horrible!" exclaimed Lady Exeter spreading her hands before her eyes, as
  if to exclude some dreadful object. "O to live in an age when such enormities
  can be perpetrated! when such frightful weapons can be used against the
  innocent&mdash;for I <i>am</i> innocent, at least of this offence. All seems
  against me; all doors of escape&mdash;save <i>one</i>&mdash;closed. And
  whither does that door lead? To the Bottomless Pit, if there be truth in
  aught we are told by Heaven."</p>

  <p>Lord Roos seemed unable or unwilling to reply; and a deep pause ensued for
  a few moments, during which the guilty pair shunned each other's regards. It
  was broken at length by Lady Exeter, who said, reproachfully, "You should
  have burnt my letters, William. Without them, they would have had no evidence
  against me. Imprudent that you were, you have destroyed me!"</p>

  <p>"Reproach me not, Prances," he rejoined. "I admit my imprudence, and blame
  myself severely for it. But I could not part with a line I had received from
  you. I inclosed the letters in a little coffer, which I deposited in a secret
  drawer of that cabinet, as in a place of perfect safety. The coffer and its
  contents mysteriously disappeared. How it was purloined I cannot inform
  you."</p>

  <p>"Do your suspicions alight on no one?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"They have fallen on several; but I have no certainty that I have been
  right in any instance," he replied. "That I have some spy near me, I am well
  aware; and if I detect him, he shall pay for his perfidy with his life."</p>

  <p>"Hist!" cried Lady Exeter. "Did you not hear a noise?"</p>

  <p>"No," he rejoined. "Where?"</p>

  <p>She pointed to the little passage leading to the ante-chamber. He
  instantly went thither, and examined the place, but without discovering any
  listener.</p>

  <p>"There is no one," he said, as he returned. "No one, in fact, could have
  obtained admittance without my knowledge, for my Spanish servant, Diego, in
  whom I can place full confidence, is stationed without."</p>

  <p>"I distrust that man, William," she observed. "When I asked whom you
  thought had removed the letters, my own suspicions had attached to him."</p>

  <p>"I do not think he would have done it," Lord Roos replied. "He has ever
  served me faithfully; and, besides, I have a guarantee for his fidelity in
  the possession of a secret on which his own life hangs. I can dispose of him
  as I please."</p>

  <p>"Again that sound!" exclaimed the Countess. "I am sure some one is
  there."</p>

  <p>"Your ears have deceived you," said the young nobleman, after examining
  the spot once more, and likewise the secret entrance by which the Countess
  had approached the chamber. "I heard nothing, and can find nothing. Your
  nerves are shaken, and make you fanciful."</p>

  <p>"It may be so," she rejoined. But it was evident she was not convinced,
  for she lowered her tones almost to a whisper as she continued. It might be
  that the question she designed to put was one she dared not ask aloud. "What
  means do you purpose to employ in the execution of your design?"</p>

  <p>"The same as those employed by Somerset and his Countess in the removal of
  Sir Thomas Overbury; but more expeditious and more certain," he replied under
  his breath.</p>

  <p>"Dreadful!" she exclaimed, with a shudder. "But the same judgment that
  overtook the Somersets may overtake us. Such crimes are never hidden."</p>

  <p>"Crimes fouler than theirs have never been brought to light, and never
  will. There was one in which Somerset himself was concerned, involving the
  destruction of a far higher personage than Overbury; and this dare not even
  be hinted at."</p>

  <p>"Because the greatest person in the land was connected with it," returned
  the Countess, "I conclude you refer to the death of Prince Henry?"</p>

  <p>"I do," answered Lord Roos. "Somerset would never have been questioned
  about Overbury, if his fall had not been resolved upon by the King."</p>

  <p>"One other question, and I ask no more," said the Countess, scarcely able
  to syllable her words. "Who is to administer the deadly draught?"</p>

  <p>"Luke Hatton, Lady Lake's apothecary. He is a creature of mine, and
  entirely devoted to me."</p>

  <p>"Our lives will be in his hands ever afterwards," said the Countess, in a
  deep whisper.</p>

  <p>"They will be in safe keeping," he rejoined, endeavouring to reassure
  her.</p>

  <p>"O, William! I would I could prevail upon you to defer this project."</p>

  <p>"To what end? The sooner it is done the better. It cannot, indeed, be
  deferred. I shall send for Luke Hatton to-night."</p>

  <p>At this announcement, the Countess, who had gradually been growing fainter
  and becoming paler, lost all power of supporting herself, and, uttering a
  cry, fell into his outstretched arms in a state of complete
  insensibility.</p>

  <p>While Lord Roos, half distracted, was considering what means he could
  adopt for her restoration, a man, with an almost tawny complexion, hair and
  eyes to match, and habited in the young nobleman's livery of crimson and
  white, suddenly entered from the ante-chamber.</p>

  <p>"How dare you come in unsummoned, Diego?" cried Lord Roos, furiously.
  "Begone instantly, sirrah!".</p>

  <p>"I crave your lordship's pardon," replied the Spanish servant; "but I was
  obliged to apprise you that your wife, the Baroness Roos, and Lady Lake are
  without, and will not be denied admission."</p>

  <p>"Damnation!" exclaimed Lord Roos. "What brings them here at such an hour?
  But you must on no account admit them, Diego&mdash;at least, till I have had
  time to remove the Countess to her own chamber. What a cursed mischance!"</p>

  <p>Diego instantly withdrew, apparently to obey his lord's command; but he
  had scarcely entered the little passage when two ladies pushed past him, and
  made their way into the room. They arrived just in time to intercept Lord
  Roos, who was conveying his insensible burthen towards the secret
  staircase.</p>

  <p>The young nobleman was as much confounded by their appearance as if two
  spectres had risen before him. Both ladies were very richly attired, and the
  younger of the two was by no means destitute of beauty, though of a pale and
  pensive character. The elder had a full, noble figure, haughty features, now
  lighted up with a smile of triumph as she gazed on Lord Roos. Very different
  was the expression of the other, who seemed so much grieved and agitated by
  what she beheld, as to be almost ready to lapse into the same condition as
  the Countess.</p>

  <p>If Lord Roos could have seen the grin upon Diego's swarthy visage, as he
  stood at the entrance of the passage leading to the ante-chamber, he would
  have had little doubt to whom he was indebted for this surprise.</p>

  <p>It is needless to say that the ladies who had thus broken upon Lord Roos's
  privacy, and obtained full confirmation of their suspicions (if they had any
  doubts remaining) were his wife and mother-in-law.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-23"
     name="ch1-23">CHAPTER XXIII.<br>
  The Tress of Hair.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">How to extricate himself from the dilemma in which he was
  placed, Lord Roos scarcely knew. But he had a good deal of self-possession,
  and it did not desert him on the present trying occasion. After such
  consideration as circumstances permitted, he could discern only one chance of
  escape, and though well-nigh hopeless, he resolved to adopt it. If consummate
  audacity could carry him through&mdash;and it was required in the present
  emergency&mdash;he had no lack of it.</p>

  <p>Hitherto, not a word had passed between him and the intruders on his
  privacy. Lady Lake seemed to enjoy his confusion too much to do anything to
  relieve it, and his wife was obliged to regulate her movements by those of
  her mother. Without breaking the silence, which by this time had become
  painfully oppressive, he proceeded to deposit the still inanimate person of
  the Countess of Exeter upon a couch, and, casting a handkerchief, as if
  undesignedly, over her face, he marched quickly up to the spot where Diego
  was standing, and said to him, in a deep, determined tone, but so low as not
  to be overheard by the others:</p>

  <p>"You have betrayed me, villain; and unless you obey me unhesitatingly, and
  corroborate all my assertions, however startling they may appear, you shall
  pay for your treachery with your life."</p>

  <p>This done, he turned towards the two ladies, and with more calmness than
  might have been expected, addressed himself to Lady Lake:</p>

  <p>"You imagine you have made an important discovery, Madam," he said; "a
  discovery which will place me and a noble lady, whose reputation you and your
  daughter seek to injure, in great perplexity. And you conclude that, being
  completely (as you fancy) in your power, I shall consent to any terms you and
  Lady Roos may propose, rather than suffer you to go forth from this chamber
  and reveal what you have seen in it. Is it not so, Madam?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, my lord," Lady Lake replied, bitterly. "You have stated the matter
  correctly enough, except in one particular. We do not <i>imagine</i> we have
  made a discovery; because we are quite sure of it. We do not <i>fancy</i> you
  will agree to our terms; because we are certain you will only too gladly
  screen yourself and the partner of your guilt from exposure and disgrace, at
  any sacrifice. And allow me to observe, that the tone adopted by your
  lordship is neither befitting the circumstances in which you are placed, nor
  the presence in which you stand. Some sense of shame must at least be left
  you&mdash;some show of respect (if nothing more) ought to be observed towards
  your injured wife. Were I acting alone in this matter, I would show you and
  my lady of Exeter no consideration whatever; but I cannot resist the
  pleadings of my daughter; and for her sake&mdash;and <i>hers</i>
  alone&mdash;I am content to suspend the blow, unless forced to strike; in
  which case, nothing shall stay my hands."</p>

  <p>"I thank your ladyship for your clemency," said Lord Roos, with mock
  humility.</p>

  <p>"O, my dear lord! do not for ever close the door between us!" cried Lady
  Roos. "Return to me, and all shall be forgiven."</p>

  <p>"Peace, Elizabeth!" exclaimed Lady Lake, impatiently. "Know you not, from
  sad experience, that your husband is inaccessible to all gentle entreaty? His
  heart is steeled to pity. Solicit not that which is your right, and which
  must be conceded, whether he like or not. Let him bend the knee to you. Let
  him promise amendment, and implore pardon, and it will then be for you to
  consider whether you will extend forgiveness to him."</p>

  <p>Lady Roos looked as if she would fain interrupt her mother, but she was
  too much under her subjection to offer a remark.</p>

  <p>"It is time to undeceive you, Madam," said Lord Roos, wholly unmoved by
  what was said. "I am not in the strait you suppose; and have not the
  slightest intention of soliciting Lady Roos's pardon, or making any promise
  to her."</p>

  <p>"O mother! you see that even <i>you</i> fail to move him," said Lady Roos,
  tearfully. "What is to happen to me?"</p>

  <p>"You will make me chide you, daughter, if you exhibit this weakness,"
  cried Lady Lake, angrily. "Let me deal with him. In spite of your affected
  confidence, my lord, you cannot be blind to the position in which you stand.
  And though you yourself personally may be careless of the consequences of a
  refusal of our demands, you cannot, I conceive, be equally indifferent to the
  fate of the Countess of Exeter, which that refusal will decide."</p>

  <p>"I am so little indifferent to the safety of the Countess, Madam, that I
  cannot sufficiently rejoice that she is out of the reach of your malice."</p>

  <p>"How, my lord!" exclaimed Lady Lake, astounded at his assurance. "Out of
  reach, when she is here! You cannot mean," she added, with an undefinable
  expression of satisfaction, "that she is dead?"</p>

  <p>"Dead!" ejaculated Lady Roos; "the Countess dead! I thought she was only
  in a swoon."</p>

  <p>"What riddle is it you would have us read, my lord?" demanded Lady
  Lake.</p>

  <p>"No riddle whatever, Madam," replied Lord Roos. "I only mean to assert
  that the person you behold upon that couch is not the Countess of
  Exeter."</p>

  <p>"Not the Countess!" exclaimed Lady Roos. "Oh, if this were possible! But
  no, no! I cannot be deceived."</p>

  <p>"I now see the reason why her face has been covered with a 'kerchief,"
  cried Lady Lake. "But it shall not save her from our scrutiny."</p>

  <p>So saying, she advanced towards the couch, with the intention of removing
  the covering, when Lord Roos barred her approach.</p>

  <p>"Not a step nearer, Madam," he cried, in a peremptory tone. "I will not
  allow you to gratify your curiosity further. You and Lady Roos may make the
  most of what you have seen; and proclaim abroad any tale your imaginations
  may devise forth. You will only render yourselves ridiculous, and encounter
  derision in lieu of sympathy. No one will credit your assertions, because I
  shall be able to prove that, at this moment, Lady Exeter is in a different
  part of the palace."</p>

  <p>"This bold falsehood will not serve your turn, my lord. Whoever she may
  be, the person on that couch shall be seized, and we shall then ascertain the
  truth."</p>

  <p>And she would have moved towards the door, if Lord Roos had not caught
  hold of her arm, while at the same time he drew his sword. Thinking from his
  fierce looks and menacing gestures that her mother might be sacrificed to his
  fury, Lady Roos fell on her knees before him, imploring pity; and she
  continued in this supplicating posture till Lady Lake angrily bade her
  rise.</p>

  <p>"You have come here without my permission, Madam," Lord Roos cried
  furiously to his mother-in-law, "and you shall not depart until I choose.
  Secure the door, Diego, and bring me the key. It is well," he continued, as
  the injunction was obeyed.</p>

  <p>Lady Lake submitted without resistance to the constraint imposed upon her.
  She could not well do otherwise; for though her screams would have brought
  aid, it might have arrived too late. And, after all, she did not intend to
  settle matters in this way. But she betrayed no symptoms of fear, and, as we
  have stated, ordered her daughter to discontinue her supplications.</p>

  <p>"And now, Madam," said Lord Roos, releasing Lady Lake, as he took the key
  from Diego, "I will tell you who that person is," pointing to the couch.</p>

  <p>"Add not to the number of falsehoods you have already told, my lord,"
  rejoined Lady Lake, contemptuously. "I am perfectly aware who she is."</p>

  <p>"But I would fain hear his explanation, mother," said Lady Roos.</p>

  <p>"What explanation can be offered?" cried Lady Lake. "Do you doubt the
  evidence of your senses?"</p>

  <p>"I know not what I doubt, or what I believe," exclaimed Lady Roos
  distractedly.</p>

  <p>"Then believe what I tell you, Bess," said her husband. "This is the
  countess's handmaiden, Gillian Greenford."</p>

  <p>"An impudent lie!" cried Lady Lake.</p>

  <p>"A truth, my lady," interposed Diego. "A truth to which I am ready to
  swear."</p>

  <p>"No doubt of it, thou false knave, and double traitor! thou art worthy of
  thy lord. There is no lie, however absurd and improbable, which he can
  invent, that thou wilt not support. Thou art ready now to perjure thyself for
  him; but let him place little reliance on thee, for thou wilt do the same
  thing for us to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I scarcely think it probable, my lady," Diego replied, bowing.</p>

  <p>Lady Lake turned from him in supreme disgust.</p>

  <p>"Admitting for a moment the possibility of your lordship's assertion being
  correct," said Lady Roos, "how comes Gillian Greenford (for so methinks you
  name her) in her mistress's attire?"</p>

  <p>"'T is easily explained, chuck," Lord Roos rejoined. "Anxious, no doubt,
  to set herself off to advantage, she hath made free with the countess's
  wardrobe. Your own favourite attendant, Sarah Swarton, hath often arranged
  herself in your finest fardingales, kirtlets, and busk-points, as Diego will
  tell you. Is it not so, rascal?"</p>

  <p>"'T is precisely as my lord hath stated, my lady," said the Spaniard to
  Lady Roos. "When Sarah Swarton hath been so habited, I have more than once
  mistaken her for your ladyship."</p>

  <p>"Yet Sarah is very unlike me," said Lady Roos.</p>

  <p>"That only shows how deceptive appearances are, chuck, and how little we
  ought to trust to them," observed Lord Roos.</p>

  <p>"How can you suffer yourself to be thus duped, Elizabeth?" said Lady
  Lake.</p>

  <p>"Because her ladyship would rather believe me than you, Madam," rejoined
  Lord Roos. "But she is <i>not</i> duped."</p>

  <p>"Heaven forgive him!" exclaimed Diego, aside.</p>

  <p>"And supposing it were Gillian, how would the case be mended, as far as
  you are concerned, Elizabeth?" said Lady Lake. "Are you not as much injured
  by one as by the other?"</p>

  <p>"It may be," replied her daughter, "but I am jealous only of the Countess.
  I would kneel to any other woman, and thank her, who would tear my husband
  from her embraces!"</p>

  <p>"Weak fool! I disown you," exclaimed Lady Lake, angrily.</p>

  <p>"What a wife!" cried Diego, apart. "His lordship is quite unworthy of her.
  Now I should appreciate such devotion."</p>

  <p>At this juncture there was a slight movement on the part of Lady Exeter,
  and something like a sigh escaped her.</p>

  <p>"She revives!" whispered Lady Lake to her daughter. "We shall soon learn
  the truth. I will find a means to make her speak. Well, my lord," she added
  aloud, and speaking in a sarcastic tone, "if you will have it so, it is idle
  to dispute it. But what will the Countess say, when she discovers your
  infidelity?"</p>

  <p>On this a brisker movement took place on the couch, and a hand was raised
  as if to snatch away the 'kerchief.</p>

  <p>"We have her," whispered Lady Lake triumphantly to her daughter. "Surely,"
  she proceeded aloud, "the Countess will deeply resent the transfer of your
  affections to her handmaiden."</p>

  <p>Lord Roos saw the peril in which he stood. A moment more and Lady Lake had
  gained her point, and the Countess betrayed herself.</p>

  <p>"Lady Exeter will place little reliance on any representations you may
  make, Madam," he said, giving particular significance to his words, "except
  so far as they concern herself, and then she will take care to refute them.
  As to the circumstance of Gillian Greenford visiting me, fainting in my arms
  (from excess of timidity, poor girl!) and being discovered by you and Lady
  Roos in that position, the Countess will laugh at it when it comes to her
  knowledge&mdash;as why should she do otherwise? But she will feel very
  differently when she finds that you and your daughter insist that it was she
  herself, and not her handmaiden, whom you beheld. Rely on it, Madam, Lady
  Exeter will contradict that assertion, and disprove it."</p>

  <p>"Let it be disproved now. Let the person on that couch disclose her
  features, and we shall then see whether she be the Countess or Gillian."</p>

  <p>"Ay, let her do that, my lord,&mdash;let her speak to us," urged Lady
  Roos.</p>

  <p>"Diablo! how is this request to be complied with, I marvel?" said Diego
  apart.</p>

  <p>But Lord Roos was too experienced a player to be defeated by this turn in
  the game.</p>

  <p>"Gillian has already been sufficiently annoyed," he cried; "and shall not
  submit to this ordeal. Besides, she has relapsed into insensibility, as you
  see."</p>

  <p>"She does what your lordship wills her, it is clear," said Lady Lake,
  contemptuously. "We know what construction to put upon your refusal."</p>

  <p>"I care not what construction you put upon it," cried Lord Roos, losing
  patience. "You and Lady Roos may think what you please, and act as you
  please. Enough for me, you can prove nothing."</p>

  <p>"Why, this is more like yourself, my lord," retorted Lady Lake,
  derisively. "Having thrown aside the mask, you will be spared the necessity
  of further subterfuge. The Countess, doubtless, will imitate your example,
  lay aside her feigned insensibility, and defy us. She need be under no
  apprehension; since she has your own warrant that we can prove nothing."</p>

  <p>"Your purpose, I perceive, is to irritate me, Madam," cried Lord Roos,
  fiercely; "and so far you are likely to succeed, though you fail in all else.
  I have no mask to throw off; but if you will have me declare myself your
  enemy, I am ready to do so. Henceforth, let there be no terms kept between
  us&mdash;let it be open warfare."</p>

  <p>"Be it so, my lord. And you will soon find who will be worsted in the
  struggle."</p>

  <p>"Oh, do not proceed to these fearful extremities, dear mother, and dearest
  husband!" cried Lady Roos, turning from one to the other imploringly. "Cease
  these provocations, I pray of you. Be friends, and not enemies."</p>

  <p>"As you please&mdash;peace or war; it is the same to me," said Lord Roos.
  "Meantime, I am wearied of this scene, and must put an end to it. Diego!" And
  beckoning his servant to him, he whispered some directions in his ear.</p>

  <p>"My lord shall be obeyed," said Diego, as he received his commission.
  "Gillian shall be conveyed with all care to her chamber."</p>

  <p>"We must have some proof that she has been here," thought Lady Lake. But
  how to obtain it? I have it. "Take these," she added in a whisper to her
  daughter, and giving a pair of scissors; "and contrive, if possible, to sever
  a lock of her hair before she be removed."</p>

  <p>By a look Lady Roos promised compliance.</p>

  <p>While this was passing, Diego had approached the couch; and fastening the
  kerchief securely round the Countess's face, he raised her in his arms, and
  moved towards the secret staircase, the tapestried covering of which was held
  aside by Lord Roos to give him passage.</p>

  <p>Rapidly as the Spaniard moved, he did not outstrip Lady Roos, whose design
  being favoured by the escape from its confinement of one of the Countess's
  long dark tresses, she had no difficulty of possessing, herself of it in the
  manner prescribed by her mother. Lady Exeter was aware of the loss she had
  sustained, and uttered a stifled cry; but this was attributed to the fright
  natural to the occasion by Lord Roos, who had not noticed what had taken
  place, and only caused him to hurry Diego's departure. But before the latter
  had wholly disappeared with his burthen, the perfumed and silken tress of
  hair was delivered to Lady Lake, who muttered triumphantly as she received
  it&mdash;"This will convict her. She cannot escape us now."</p>

  <p>The prize was scarcely concealed when Lord Roos, sheathing the sword which
  he had hitherto held drawn, advanced towards his mother-in-law.</p>

  <p>"Now that the object of your disquietude is removed, Madam, it will not be
  necessary to prolong this interview," he said.</p>

  <p>"Have we then your lordship's permission to depart?" rejoined Lady Lake,
  coldly. "We are not, I presume, to avail ourselves of the private means of
  exit contrived for your amorous adventures, lest we should make other
  discoveries."</p>

  <p>"Your ladyship will leave by the way you entered," rejoined Lord Roos. "I
  will attend you to the door&mdash;and unfasten it for you."</p>

  <p>"Before we go, I would have a word with my husband&mdash;it may be my
  last," said Lady Roos to her mother. "I pray you withdraw a little, that we
  may be alone."</p>

  <p>"Better not," rejoined Lady Lake. But unable to resist her daughter's
  imploring looks, she added, "Well, as you will. But it is useless."</p>

  <p>With this she proceeded to the little passage, and remained there.</p>

  <p>As Lady Roos turned to her husband, she saw, from the stern and inflexible
  look he had assumed, that any appeal made to him would be unavailing, and she
  attempted none. A moment elapsed before she could utter a word, and then it
  was only a murmur to heaven for guidance and support.</p>

  <p>"What say you, Elizabeth?" demanded Lord Roos, thinking she had addressed
  him.</p>

  <p>"I asked for support from on High, William, and it has been accorded to
  me," she replied in a low sweet voice. "I can now speak to you. It is not to
  weary you with supplications or reproaches that I thus detain you. I have
  something to impart to you, and I am sure you will eagerly listen to it. Come
  nearer, that we may not be overheard."</p>

  <p>Lord Roos, whose curiosity was aroused by her manner, obeyed her.</p>

  <p>"I am all attention," he said.</p>

  <p>"I feel I am in your way, William," she rejoined, in a deep whisper; "and
  that you desire my death. Nay, interrupt me not; I am sure you desire it; and
  I am equally sure that the desire will be gratified, and that you will kill
  me."</p>

  <p>"Kill you, Bess!" cried Lord Roos, startled. "How can you imagine aught so
  frightful?"</p>

  <p>"There is a power granted to those who love deeply as I do, of seeing into
  the hearts of those they love, and reading their secrets. I have read yours,
  William. Nay, be not alarmed. I have kept it to myself hitherto, and will
  keep it to the end. You wish me dead, I say; and you shall have your
  wish&mdash;but not in the way you propose. Having lost your love, I am become
  indifferent to life&mdash;or, rather, life is grown intolerable to me. But
  though death may be a release, it must not come from your hand."</p>

  <p>"You cannot mean to destroy yourself, Elizabeth?" cried Lord Roos,
  appalled.</p>

  <p>"I mean to trouble you no longer. I mean to make the last and greatest
  sacrifice I can for you; and to save you from a crime&mdash;or, if you must
  share the crime, at least to screen you from punishment. Look, here!" she
  added, producing a small phial. "Bid me drink of this, and ere to-morrow you
  are free, and I am at rest. Shall I do it?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no," rejoined Lord Roos, snatching the phial from her. "Live,
  Bess, live!"</p>

  <p>"Am I to live for you, William?" she cried, with inexpressible joy.</p>

  <p>He made no answer, but averted his head.</p>

  <p>"In mercy give me back the phial," she exclaimed, again plunged into the
  depths of despair.</p>

  <p>"I must refuse your request," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Have you done, Elizabeth?" demanded Lady Lake, coming forth from the
  passage.</p>

  <p>"A moment more, mother," cried Lady Roos. "One word&mdash;one look!" she
  added to her husband.</p>

  <p>But he neither spoke to her, nor regarded her.</p>

  <p>"I am ready to accompany you now, mother," said the poor lady faintly.</p>

  <p>"Nerve yourself, weak-hearted girl," said Lady Lake, in a low tone.
  "Revenge is ours."</p>

  <p>"If I could only strike her without injuring him, I should not heed,"
  thought Lady Roos. "But where he suffers, I must also suffer, and yet more
  acutely."</p>

  <p>And scarcely able to support herself, she followed her mother to the door
  of the ante-chamber, which was unlocked, and thrown open for them by her
  husband. He did not bid her farewell!</p>

  <p>As Lady Lake passed forth, she paused for a moment, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"To-morrow, my Lord, we will ascertain whether the tress of hair we have
  obtained from the fair visitant to your chamber, matches with that of Gillian
  Greenford or with the raven locks of the Countess of Exeter."</p>

  <p>And satisfied with the effect produced by this menace, she departed with
  her daughter, before Lord Roos could utter a reply.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-24"
     name="ch1-24">CHAPTER XXIV.<br>
  The Fountain Court.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">On the morning after the eventful passage in his life,
  previously related, our newly-created knight was standing, in a pensive
  attitude, beside the beautiful fountain, adorned with two fair statues,
  representing the Queen of Love and her son, heretofore described as placed in
  the centre of the great quadrangle of the Palace of Theobalds. Sir Jocelyn
  was listening to the plashing of the sparkling jets of water, as they rose
  into the air, and fell back into the broad marble basin, and appeared to be
  soothed by the pleasant sound. His breast had been agitated by various and
  conflicting emotions. In an incredibly short space of time events had
  occurred, some of which seemed likely to influence the whole of his future
  career; while one of them, though it had advanced him far beyond what he
  could have anticipated, appeared likely to mar altogether his prospects of
  happiness.</p>

  <p>Though the difficulties, therefore, that surrounded him had been
  unexpectedly overcome; though, by the exertions of the Conde de Gondomar, who
  had followed up his first success with wonderful promptitude and
  perseverance, and had dexterously contrived, by all the insidious arts of
  which lie was so perfect a master, to ingratiate his protegé still further
  with the King, without the protegé himself being aware of the manner in which
  he was served; though James himself appeared greatly pleased with him, at the
  banquet in the evening, to which, owing to the skilful management of the
  Spanish ambassador, he was invited, and bestowed such marked attention upon
  him, that the envy and jealousy of most of the courtiers were excited by it;
  though he seemed on the high-road to still greater favour, and was already
  looked upon as a rising favourite, who might speedily supplant others above
  him in this ever-changing sphere, if he did not receive a check; though his
  present position was thus comparatively secure, and his prospects thus
  brilliant, he felt ill at ease, and deeply dissatisfied with himself. He
  could not acquit himself of blame for the part he had played, though
  involuntarily, in the arrest of Hugh Calveley. It was inexpressibly painful
  to him; and he felt it as a reproach from which he could not free himself, to
  have risen, however unexpectedly on his own part, by the unfortunate
  Puritan's fall. How could he ever face Aveline again! She must regard him
  with horror and detestation, as the involuntary cause of her father's
  destruction. A bar had been placed between them, which nothing could ever
  remove. And though, on the one hand, he was suddenly exalted far beyond his
  hopes; yet on the other he was as suddenly cast down, and threatened to be
  for ever deprived of the bliss he had in view, the possession of which he
  coveted far more than wealth or grandeur. Additional complexity had been
  given to his position from the circumstance that, at De Gondomar's secret
  instance, of which, like all the rest, he was unaware, he had been appointed
  as officer in custody of Hugh Calveley, until the latter, who was still
  detained a close prisoner in the porter's lodge, should be removed to the
  Tower, or the Fleet, as his Majesty might direct. This post he would have
  declined, had there been a possibility of doing so. Any plan he might have
  formed of aiding the prisoner's escape was thus effectually prevented, as he
  could not violate his duty; and it was probably with this view that the wily
  ambassador had obtained him the appointment. In fact, he had unconsciously
  become little more than a puppet in the hands of the plotting Spaniard, who
  pulled the strings that moved him at pleasure, regardless of the
  consequences. What De Gondomar's ulterior designs were with him had not yet
  become manifest.</p>

  <p>These perplexing thoughts swept through Sir Jocelyn's breast, as he stood
  by the marble fountain, and listened to the sound of its falling waters.</p>

  <p>While thus occupied, he perceived two persons issue from the arched
  entrance fronting the gate (adjoining the porter's lodge, in which the
  prisoner was still detained), and make their way slowly across the
  quadrangle, in the direction of the cloister on its eastern side, above which
  were apartments assigned to the Secretary of State, Sir Thomas Lake.</p>

  <p>The foremost of the two was merely a yeoman of the guard, and would not
  for a moment have attracted Sir Jocelyn's attention, if it had not been for a
  female who accompanied him, and whom he was evidently conducting to Sir
  Thomas Lake's rooms, as Sir Jocelyn not only saw the man point towards them,
  but heard him mention the Secretary of State's name.</p>

  <p>Something whispered him that this closely-hooded female,&mdash;the lower
  part of whose face was shrouded in a muffler, so that the eyes alone were
  visible,&mdash;was Aveline. Little could be discerned of the features; but
  the exquisitely-proportioned figure, so simply yet so tastefully arrayed,
  could only be hers; and if he <i>could</i> have doubted that it was Aveline,
  the suddenness with which her looks were averted as she beheld him, and the
  quickness with which she stepped forward, so as even to outstrip her
  companion&mdash;these circumstances, coupled with the violent throbbing of
  his own heart, convinced him he was right. He would have flown after her, if
  he had dared; would have poured forth all his passionate feelings to her, had
  he been permitted; would have offered her his life, to deal with as she
  pleased; but his fears restrained him, and he remained riveted to the spot,
  gazing after her until she entered the great hall on the ground floor,
  beneath the Secretary of State's apartments. Why she sought Sir Thomas Lake
  he could easily understand. It was only from him that authority to visit her
  father could be obtained.</p>

  <p>After remaining irresolute for a few minutes, during which the magnificent
  structure around him faded entirely from his view like a vision melting into
  air, and he heard no more the pleasant plashing of the fountain, he proceeded
  to the great hall near the cloister, resolved to wait there till her
  return.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-25"
     name="ch1-25">CHAPTER XXV.<br>
  Sir Thomas Lake.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A grave-looking man, of a melancholy and severe aspect, and
  attired in a loose robe of black velvet, was seated alone in a chamber, the
  windows of which opened upon the Fountain Court, which we have just quitted.
  He wore a silken skull-cap, from beneath which a few gray hairs escaped; his
  brow was furrowed with innumerable wrinkles, occasioned as much by thought
  and care as by age; his pointed beard and moustaches were almost white,
  contrasting strikingly with his dark, jaundiced complexion, the result of an
  atrabilarious temperament; his person was extremely attenuated, and his hands
  thin and bony. He had once been tall, but latterly had lost much of his
  height, in consequence of a curvature of the spine, which bowed down his head
  almost upon his breast, and fixed it immoveably in that position. His
  features were good, but, as we have stated, were stamped with melancholy, and
  sharpened by severity.</p>

  <p>This person was Sir Thomas Lake, Secretary of State.</p>

  <p>The table at which he sat was strewn over with official documents and
  papers. He was not, however, examining any of them, but had just broken the
  seal of a private packet which he had received from his wife, when an usher
  entered, and intimated that a young maiden, who was without, solicited a
  moment's audience. The request would have been refused, if the man had not
  gone on to say that he believed the applicant was the daughter of the crazy
  Puritan, who had threatened the King's life on the previous day. On hearing
  this, Sir Thomas consented to see her, and she was admitted accordingly.</p>

  <p>As soon as the usher had retired, Aveline unmuffled herself, and, cold and
  apathetic as he was, Sir Thomas could not help being struck by her surpassing
  beauty, unimpaired even by the affliction under which she laboured; and he
  consequently softened in some degree the customary asperity of his tones in
  addressing her.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, maiden, and what seek you?" he demanded, eyeing her with
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>"I am daughter to the unfortunate Hugh Calveley, now a prisoner in the
  palace," she replied.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear it," rejoined Sir Thomas, resuming his habitually
  severe expression; "for you are the daughter of a very heinous offender. The
  enormity of Hugh Calveley's crime, which is worse than parricide, deprives
  him of all human sympathy and compassion. In coming to me you do not, I
  presume, intend to weary me with prayers for mercy; for none is deserved, and
  none will be shown. For my own part, I shall not utter a word in mitigation
  of the dreadful sentence certain to be pronounced upon him; nor shall I
  advise the slightest clemency to be shown him on the part of his Majesty.
  Such an offender cannot be too severely punished. I do not say this," he
  continued, somewhat softening his harshness, "to aggravate the distress and
  shame you naturally feel; but I wish to check at once any hopes you may have
  formed. Yet though I have no pity for him, I have much for you, since,
  doubtless, you are innocent of all knowledge of your father's atrocious
  design&mdash;happily prevented. And I would therefore say to you, shut out
  all feelings for him from your heart. The man who raises his hand against his
  sovereign cuts off by the act all ties of kindred and love. Affection is
  changed to abhorrence; and such detestation does his horrible offence
  inspire, that those of his own blood are bound to shun him, lest he derive
  comfort and consolation from their presence. Thus considered, you are no
  longer his daughter, for he has himself severed the links between you. You no
  longer owe him filial duty and regard, for to such he is no more entitled.
  Leave him to his fate; and, if possible, for ever obliterate his memory from
  your breast."</p>

  <p>"You counsel what I can never perform, honourable Sir," replied Aveline;
  "and were he even branded like Cain, I could not shut my heart towards him.
  Nothing can make me forget that I am his daughter. That his offence will be
  dreadfully expiated, I do not doubt; but if I can alleviate his sufferings in
  any way, I will do so; and I will never cease to plead for mercy for him. And
  O, honourable Sir! you regard his offence in a darker light than it deserves.
  You treat him as if he had actually accomplished the direful purpose
  attributed to him; whereas, nothing has been proven against him beyond the
  possession of a weapon, which he might keep about his person for
  self-defence."</p>

  <p>"The plea you urge is futile, maiden," rejoined Sir Thomas; "he is judged
  out of his own mouth, for his own lips have avowed his criminal
  intention."</p>

  <p>"Still, it was but the intention, honourable Sir!"</p>

  <p>"In such cases, the intention is equal to the crime&mdash;at least in the
  eyes of law and justice. No plea will save Hugh Calveley. Of that rest
  assured."</p>

  <p>"One plea may be urged for him, which, whether it avail or not, is the
  truth, and shall be made. It is painful to speak of my father as I must now
  do; but there is no help for it. Of late years he has been subject to strange
  mental hallucinations, which have bordered close upon madness, if they have
  not reached that terrible point. Nocturnal vigils, fastings, and prayers have
  affected his health. He has denied himself sufficient rest, and has only
  partaken of food barely sufficient to sustain nature, and no more. The
  consequence has been that strange fancies have troubled his brain; that at
  dead of night, when alone in his chamber, he has imagined that visions have
  appeared to him; that voices have spoken&mdash;awful voices&mdash;talking of
  prophecies, lamentations, and judgments, and charging him with a mighty and
  terrible mission. All these things I have heard from his own lips, and I have
  heard and seen much more, which has satisfied me that his intellects are
  disordered, and that he cannot be held accountable for his actions."</p>

  <p>"If such be the case, he should have been kept under restraint, and not
  suffered to go abroad," said Sir Thomas. "Such madmen are highly mischievous
  and dangerous. Much blame rests with you, maiden."</p>

  <p>"The whole blame is mine!" she exclaimed. "I confess my error&mdash;my
  crime&mdash;and will atone for it willingly with my life, provided he be
  spared. If a sacrifice must be made, let me be the victim."</p>

  <p>"There is no sacrifice, and no victim," returned Sir Thomas gravely,
  though he was not unmoved by her filial devotion. "There is an offender, and
  there will be justice; and justice must be satisfied. Inexorable as fate, her
  dread sentences cannot be averted."</p>

  <p>"O, honourable Sir! you may one day recall those words; for which of us
  can hold himself free from offence? My father is not guilty in the eyes of
  Heaven; or if he be, I am equally culpable, since I ought to have prevented
  the commission of the crime. O, I shall never forgive myself that I did not
  follow him when he parted from me yesterday!"</p>

  <p>"Let me hear how that occurred, maiden?" asked Sir Thomas.</p>

  <p>"It chanced in this way, Sir. I have already described my father's state
  of mind, and the distempered view he has been accustomed to take of all
  things. Yesterday, May-day sports were held in the village of Tottenham,
  where we dwelt; and as such things are an abomination in his sight, he took
  upon him to reprove the actors in the pastimes. They who witnessed his
  conduct on that occasion would hardly hold him to be under the due control of
  reason. Amongst the spectators was the son of an old friend, whose name
  having accidentally reached my father, he invited him into the house, and a
  misunderstanding having arisen between them, the latter suddenly
  left&mdash;dismissed almost with rudeness. On his departure, my father was
  greatly disturbed&mdash;more so than I have ever seen him. After awhile, he
  withdrew to his own chamber, as was his habit, to pray, and I hoped would
  become tranquillized; but the very reverse happened, for when he reappeared,
  I saw at once that a fearful change had taken place in him. His eye blazed
  with preternatural light, his gestures were wild and alarming, and his
  language full of menace and denunciation. He again spoke of his mission from
  Heaven, and said that its execution could no longer be delayed."</p>

  <p>"This should have been a warning to you," observed Sir Thomas, knitting
  his brows.</p>

  <p>"It should, honourable Sir. But I did not profit by it. I knew and felt
  that he was no longer under the dominion of reason&mdash;that he was
  labouring under some terrible delusion that approached its crisis; but I did
  not check him. I yielded passive obedience to his injunction, that I should
  depart instantly with an old servant to London; and I agreed to tarry at a
  house, which he mentioned, till I heard from him. I had sad forebodings that
  I should never hear from him again&mdash;or if I <i>did</i>, that the tidings
  would be worse than none at all; but I obeyed. I could not, indeed, resist
  his will. I set forth with my attendant, and my father parted with us at the
  door. He placed money in my hand, and bade me farewell! but in such a tone,
  and with such a look, that I felt his senses were gone, and I would have
  stayed him, but it was then too late. Breaking from my embrace, he sprang
  upon his horse, which was ready saddled, and rode off, taking the direction
  of Edmonton; while I, with a heart full of distress and misgiving, pursued my
  way to London. Ere midnight, my sad presentiments were verified. A messenger
  traced me out, bringing intelligence of the direful event that had happened,
  and informing me that my father was a prisoner at Theobalds. As soon as I
  could procure means of reaching the palace, I set forth, and arrived here
  about an hour ago, when, failing in my efforts to obtain an interview with my
  father, who is closely confined, and none suffered to come near him save with
  authority from the Secretary of State, I sought an audience of you,
  honourable Sir, in the hope that you would grant me permission to see
  him."</p>

  <p>"If I do grant it, the interview must take place in the presence of the
  officer to whom his custody has been committed," replied Sir Thomas. "With
  this restriction, I am willing to sign an order for you."</p>

  <p>"Be it as you please, honourable Sir; and take my heartfelt gratitude for
  the grace."</p>

  <p>Sir Thomas struck a small bell upon the table, and the usher appeared at
  the summons.</p>

  <p>"Bid the officer in charge of Hugh Calveley attend me," he said.</p>

  <p>The man bowed, and departed.</p>

  <p>Sir Thomas Lake then turned to the paper which he had just opened before
  Aveline's appearance, and was soon so much engrossed by it that he seemed
  quite unconscious of her presence. His countenance became gloomier and more
  austere as he read on, and an expression of pain&mdash;almost a
  groan&mdash;escaped him. He appeared then to feel sensible that he had
  committed an indiscretion, for he laid down the paper, and, as if forcibly
  diverting himself from its contents, addressed Aveline.</p>

  <p>"What you have said respecting your father's condition of mind," he
  observed, "by no means convinces me that it is so unsound as to render him
  irresponsible for his actions. It were to put a charitable construction upon
  his conduct to say that no one but a madman could be capable of it; but there
  was too much consistency in what he has said and done to admit of such an
  inference. But for the interposition of another person he owned that he would
  have killed the King; and the disappointment he exhibited, and the language
  he used, prove such to have been his fixed intention. His mind may have been
  disturbed; but what of that? All who meditate great crimes, it is to be
  hoped, are not entirely masters of themselves. Yet for that reason they are
  not to be exempt from punishment. He who is sane enough to conceive an act of
  wickedness, to plan its execution, and to attempt to perpetrate it, although
  he may be in other respects of unsettled mind, is equally amenable to the
  law, and ought equally to suffer for his criminality with him who has a wiser
  and sounder head upon his shoulders."</p>

  <p>Aveline attempted no reply, but the tears sprang to her eyes.</p>

  <p>At this moment the door was thrown open by the usher to admit Sir Jocelyn
  Mounchensey.</p>

  <p>The emotion displayed by the young couple when thus brought together
  passed unnoticed by the Secretary of State, as he was occupied at the moment
  in writing the authority for Aveline, and did not raise his eyes towards
  them.</p>

  <p>"Are you the officer to whom my father's custody has been entrusted?"
  exclaimed Aveline, as soon as she could give utterance to her surprise.</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask that question, mistress?" demanded Sir Thomas, looking up.
  "What can it signify to you who hath custody of your father, provided good
  care be taken of him? There is a Latin maxim which his Majesty cited at the
  banquet last night&mdash;<i>Etiam aconito inest remedium</i>&mdash;and which
  may be freely rendered by our homely saying, that 'It is an ill wind that
  bloweth nobody good luck;' and this hath proved true with Sir Jocelyn
  Mounchensey&mdash;for the gust that hath wrecked your father hath driven him
  into port, where he now rides securely in the sunshine of the King's favour.
  Nor is this to be wondered at, since it was by Sir Jocelyn that his Majesty's
  life was preserved."</p>

  <p>"The King preserved by him!" exclaimed Aveline, in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"Ay, marry and indeed, young mistress," rejoined Sir Thomas. "He arrested
  the fell traitor; was knighted on the spot for the service, by the King; was
  invited afterwards to the grand banquet in the evening, and received with
  more distinction than any other guest; and he is now, as you find, entrusted
  with the custody of the prisoner. Thus, if your father has done little good
  to himself, he hath done much to Sir Jocelyn."</p>

  <p>Aveline could not repress an exclamation of anguish.</p>

  <p>"No more of this, I entreat, Sir Thomas," cried Sir Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>"It is right she should hear the truth," replied the Secretary of State.
  "Here is her authority for admittance to her father," he continued, giving it
  to him. "It must take place in your presence, Sir Jocelyn. And you will pay
  strict attention to what they say," he added in a low tone, "for you will
  have to report all that passes between them to the council. Something may
  arise to implicate the girl herself, so let naught escape you. Be vigilant in
  your office, as is needful. I mention this as you are new to it. If the
  prisoner continues obstinate, as he hath hitherto shown himself, threaten him
  with the torture. The rack will certainly be applied when he reaches the
  Tower. I need not give you further instructions I think, Sir Jocelyn. Be
  pleased to return to me when the interview is over."</p>

  <p>Upon this, he bowed gravely, and sounded the bell for the usher. Unable to
  offer any remonstrance, Sir Jocelyn approached Aveline, who could scarcely
  support herself, with the intention of offering her assistance; but she
  shrank from him, and again muffling her face, went forth, while he slowly
  followed her.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-26"
     name="ch1-26">CHAPTER XXVI.<br>
  The Forged Confession.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Some little time had elapsed since Aveline's departure on
  her sorrowful errand, and Sir Thomas Lake was still alone, and once more
  deeply engrossed in the consideration of the document, which, it will be
  recollected, had occasioned him so much disquietude; and the feeling by no
  means diminished when the usher entered and announced Lady Lake. Severe and
  inflexible as we have described him, the Secretary of State was generally
  yielding enough towards his lady, of whom he stood in great awe, and whom he
  treated with the utmost deference; but on this occasion, contrary to
  habitude, he received her very coldly, and without rising motioned her to a
  seat beside him. Disregarding the want of attention, which, under other
  circumstances, she would have resented, Lady Lake took the seat indicated
  without remark, and continued silent till the usher had retired. Then turning
  quickly towards her husband, and fixing an inquiring look upon him, she said
  in a low voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What think you of this document, Sir Thomas?"</p>

  <p>"This forgery?" he rejoined in the same tone, but without raising his eyes
  towards her.</p>

  <p>"Ay, this forgery, if you choose to call it so," she returned. "Let me
  have your opinion upon it? Is it as it should be? Are its expressions such as
  would be used by a guilty woman, like the Countess, imploring pity, and
  seeking to shield herself from disgrace? Do you find fault with it? Can it be
  amended in any particular?"</p>

  <p>"I find such grave fault with it," replied the Secretary of State, still
  without looking up, "that I would amend it by casting it into the flames.
  Lady Lake, it is my duty to warn you. This is a fearful crime you would
  commit, and severely punishable by the law. You may excuse it to yourself,
  because you have an end in view which seems to justify the means; but the
  excuse will not avail you with others. You have said that in a conflict with
  one so cunning and unscrupulous as our noble son-in-law, you are compelled to
  fight him with his own weapons&mdash;to meet trick with trick, manoevre with
  manoeuvre; but take my word for it, you would more easily defeat him by
  straight-forward means. Be ruled by me in this one instance. Abandon a scheme
  which must inevitably lead to consequences I shudder to contemplate; and let
  this fabricated confession be destroyed."</p>

  <p>"Give it me," she cried, snatching the paper from him. "You were ever
  timid, Sir Thomas; and if you had not lacked courage, this expedient would
  not have been necessary. Odious and dangerous as it is, the measure is forced
  upon me, and I shall not shrink from it. But you shall not be called upon to
  play any part in the transaction. I alone will do it. I alone will be
  responsible for all that may ensue."</p>

  <p>"We shall all be responsible!" he rejoined. "You will not only ruin
  yourself, but all your family, if this fearful step be taken. Hitherto we
  have had right on our side, but henceforth we shall be more culpable than the
  others."</p>

  <p>"I am resolved upon the course," cried Lady Lake; "and all your
  arguments&mdash;all your warnings will not dissuade me from it, so you may
  spare your breath, Sir Thomas. As you see, I have omitted the charge of
  witchcraft, and have only made the Countess confess her criminality with Lord
  Roos, and of this we have had abundant proofs; nay, we should have them
  still, if those condemnatory letters of hers, which had come into our
  possession, had not been stolen. That mischance necessitates the present
  measure. Having managed to deprive us of our weapons, Lord Roos thinks
  himself secure. But he will find his mistake when this document is produced
  to confound him."</p>

  <p>"I tremble at the thought," groaned the Secretary of State.</p>

  <p>"These fears are worse than womanish," exclaimed his lady. "Shake them
  off, and be yourself. Who is to prove that the confession proceeds not from
  the Countess? Not she herself; since no one will believe her. Not Lord Roos;
  for he will be equally discredited. Not Diego; for his testimony would be
  valueless. The Countess's hand-writing has been so skilfully imitated, that
  the falsification cannot be detected. Compare it with this note written by
  herself to Lady Roos, and which, though it proves nothing, has so far
  answered my purpose. Compare, I say, the writing of the confession and the
  signature with this note, and declare if you can discern any difference
  between them. As to the signatures of Lord Roos and Diego affixed to the
  document, they are equally well simulated."</p>

  <p>"That the forgery is skilfully executed, I do not deny," replied the
  Secretary of State; "and that circumstance, though it does not lessen the
  crime, may lessen the chance of detection. Since nothing I can urge will turn
  you from your design, and you are determined to employ this dangerous
  instrument, at least be cautious in its use. Terrify Lord Roos with it, if
  you choose. Threaten to lay it before the Earl of Exeter&mdash;before the
  King himself&mdash;in case of our son-in-law's non-compliance with your
  demands. But beware how you proceed further. Do not part with it for a
  moment; so that, if need be, you may destroy it. Do you heed me, my
  lady?"</p>

  <p>"I do, Sir Thomas," she replied. "Be assured I will act with due
  caution.&mdash;I am glad to find you are coming round to my views, and are
  disposed to countenance the measure."</p>

  <p>"I countenance it!" exclaimed the Secretary of State, in alarm. "No such
  thing. I disapprove of it entirely, and cannot sufficiently reprehend it.
  But, as I well know, when you have once made up your mind, the fiend himself
  cannot turn you from your purpose, I give you the best counsel I can under
  the circumstances. I wash my hands of it altogether. Would to Heaven I had
  never been consulted upon it&mdash;never even been made acquainted with the
  project. However, as you have gone so far with me you may go a step further,
  and let me know what story you mean to attach to this confession? How will
  you feign to have obtained it?"</p>

  <p>"The statement I shall make will be this, and it will be borne out by so
  many corroborative circumstances that it will be impossible to contradict it.
  You observe that the document is dated on the 10th of April last. It is not
  without reason that it is so dated. On that day I and our daughter, Lady
  Roos, attended by her maid, Sarah Swarton, proceeded to the Earl of Exeter's
  residence at Wimbledon, for the purpose of having an interview with the
  Countess, and we then saw her in the presence of Lord Roos and his servant
  Diego."</p>

  <p>"But you gained nothing by the journey?" remarked her husband.</p>

  <p>"Your pardon, Sir Thomas," she rejoined; "I gained this confession. On the
  way back I reflected upon what had occurred, and I thought how flushed with
  triumph I should have been if, instead of meeting with discomfiture, I had
  gained my point&mdash;if I had brought the haughty Countess to her
  knees&mdash;had compelled her to write out and sign a full avowal of her
  guilt, coupled with supplications for forgiveness from my injured daughter
  and myself&mdash;and as a refinement of revenge, had forced Lord Roos and his
  servant to attest by their signatures the truth of the confession! I thought
  of this&mdash;and incensed that I had not done it, resolved it <i>should</i>
  be done."</p>

  <p>"An ill resolve!" muttered her husband.</p>

  <p>"In Luke Hatton, our apothecary, I had the man for my purpose," pursued
  Lady Lake. "Aware of his marvellous talent for imitating any writing he
  pleased&mdash;aware, also, that I could entirely rely upon him, I resolved to
  call in his aid."</p>

  <p>"Imprudent woman! You have placed yourself wholly in his power," groaned
  Sir Thomas. "Suppose he should betray the terrible trust you have reposed in
  him?"</p>

  <p>"He will not betray it," replied Lady Lake. "He is too deeply implicated
  in the matter not to keep silence for his own sake. But to proceed. The
  document, such as you see it, was drawn out by myself and transcribed by Luke
  Hatton, and the writing so admirably counterfeited that Lady Exeter herself
  may well doubt if it be not her own. Then, as to the circumstances, they will
  all bear me out. We were known to have been at Wimbledon on the day in
  question. We were known to have had an interview with Lady Exeter, at which
  Lord Roos and Diego were present. The interview was private, and therefore no
  one can tell what took place at it; but the probabilities are that what I
  shall assert really did occur."</p>

  <p>Sir Thomas signified his assent, and she went on.</p>

  <p>"The plot is well contrived, and, with prudent management, cannot fail of
  success. We have the time of the supposed occurrence&mdash;the actors in
  it&mdash;and the scene&mdash;for I shall describe the particular room in
  which the interview really did take place, and I shall further bring forward
  Sarah Swarton, who will declare that she was concealed behind the hangings,
  and heard the Countess read over the confession before she signed it."</p>

  <p>"Another party to the affair&mdash;and a woman!" ejaculated Sir Thomas.
  "The dangers of discovery are multiplied a hundredfold."</p>

  <p>"The danger exists only in your imagination," said his Lady. "Come, admit,
  Sir Thomas, that the scheme is well contrived, and that they must be cunning
  indeed if they escape from the meshes I have woven for them."</p>

  <p>"You have displayed ingenuity enough, I am free to own, if it had been
  directed to a better end; but in the best contrived scheme some flaw is ever
  found, which is sure to mar it."</p>

  <p>"You can detect no flaw in this I am persuaded, Sir Thomas. If you can,
  let me know it?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, it is only when too late that such things are found out. The
  supposed armour of proof is then found wanting at some vital point. However,
  I will say no more," he observed, perceiving her impatience. "What is done
  cannot be undone. Have you prepared our daughter? Will she consent to aid
  you?"</p>

  <p>"She will," replied Lady Lake. "I had some difficulty with her at first,
  but I found means to overrule her scruples, and she consented at last to act
  as I desired, provided all other means failed of accomplishing the object in
  view. And they <i>have</i> failed since we have lost those letters, for
  though I have one other proof left which might perhaps be adduced, I do not
  attach much importance to it."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" inquired Sir Thomas, quickly.</p>

  <p>"You shall know anon," she answered. "Suffice it, I have done all I could
  to avoid having recourse to the present measure; and have delayed&mdash;its
  execution to the last moment."</p>

  <p>"But that proof of which you were speaking?" cried Sir Thomas. "Let me
  hear it? Perhaps it may obviate the necessity of this dangerous
  proceeding?"</p>

  <p>"I do not think so. But you shall judge. Last night, our daughter and
  myself obtained secret admittance to Lord Roos's chamber, and we found the
  Countess there, and fainting in his arms."</p>

  <p>"Why that is enough to convict them. You want nothing more."</p>

  <p>"Hear me to an end, and you will change your opinion. Placing the
  inanimate Countess on a couch, and covering her face with a handkerchief,
  Lord Roos had the effrontery to assert that we were mistaken; insisting that
  it was not Lady Exeter we beheld&mdash;but her hand-maiden, Gillian
  Greenford; and he appealed to the perfidious knave, Diego, in confirmation of
  his assertion."</p>

  <p>"But you did not leave without satisfying yourselves of the truth?"
  demanded Sir Thomas.</p>

  <p>"His lordship took care we should have no means of doing so," she
  answered. "He caused Diego to convey her away by a secret staircase."</p>

  <p>"'Sdeath! that was unlucky. You have no proof then that it was the
  Countess you beheld?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing beyond a lock of her hair, which was secured by Lady Roos as the
  man was removing her."</p>

  <p>"That may be enough," cried the Secretary of State; "and prevent the
  necessity of resorting to this frightful expedient. We must see the girl, and
  interrogate her. Gillian Greenford you say she is called. She shall be
  brought hither at once."</p>

  <p>"It is possible she may be without," returned Lady Lake. "Before I came
  here, I summoned her in your name."</p>

  <p>"We will see," cried Sir Thomas, striking upon the bell. And the usher,
  appearing to the summons, informed him that in effect the damsel in question
  was in attendance. "She seems much alarmed, Sir Thomas," said the usher, "and
  has with her a young man, who appears to take a tender interest in her, and
  wishes to be present at the investigation."</p>

  <p>"Let him come in with her," said the Secretary of State. And seeing the
  usher pause, he inquired if he had anything further to say.</p>

  <p>"His Excellency the Spanish Ambassador and my Lord Roos are without, and
  desire admittance," replied the man.</p>

  <p>Sir Thomas consulted his lady by a look; and as she made no objection, he
  signified his pleasure that they should be admitted, and accordingly the door
  was thrown open for the entrance of all the persons mentioned.</p>

  <p>Gillian came first, and seemed much embarrassed by the situation in which
  she found herself. She had been well tutored for the part she had to play;
  but the instructions she had received entirely fled from her mind as she
  found herself in the presence of two such awful personages as Sir Thomas Lake
  and his lady, both of whom fixed keen glances upon her. Feeling ready to drop
  with fright, she looked at Dick Taverner, as if imploring his support. But
  this Dick declined to afford. His jealousy having been roused by what he had
  heard, he determined to be governed in his conduct towards her by the result
  of the investigation. Accordingly, though it cost him an effort, he held
  back. As the Conde de Gondomar appeared, Sir Thomas Lake arose, and made him
  a profound salutation, which was returned with equal ceremony by the Spanish
  Ambassador. The latter, however, did not take a seat, but remained standing
  with Lord Roos, whose presence was acknowledged by a cold and distant bow
  from his father-in-law. The young nobleman did not appear in the slightest
  degree disconcerted by the reception he met with, or apprehensive of the
  result of the investigation. He jested apart with De Gondomar; and both he
  and the Spanish Ambassador appeared greatly amused by Gillian's
  embarrassment. Behind him stood his servant Diego.</p>

  <p>"You are handmaiden to the Countess of Exeter, I presume?" demanded Lady
  Lake of the damsel.</p>

  <p>"I am, my lady," she answered.</p>

  <p>"The girl does not look as if the imputations cast upon her character can
  be true," observed Sir Thomas Lake.</p>

  <p>As this was said, poor Gillian became suffused with blushes, and hung her
  head.</p>

  <p>"Before I put any further questions to her," remarked Lady Lake, "I will
  ask Lord Roos if he still persists in affirming that it was this damsel who
  visited him last night?"</p>

  <p>Dick Taverner looked as if his fate depended upon the response the young
  nobleman might make to the inquiry.</p>

  <p>"I must decline to answer your ladyship's question," returned Lord
  Roos.</p>

  <p>"Why cannot he speak out?" muttered Dick. "This uncertainty is worse than
  anything."</p>

  <p>"What says the damsel herself," observed Sir Thomas Lake. "Does she admit
  the charge?"</p>

  <p>"You cannot expect her to do that, Sir Thomas," interposed Lord Roos.</p>

  <p>"I expect her to answer my question," rejoined the Secretary of State,
  sharply. "Were you in Lord Roos's room last night?" he added, to Gillian.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear! I am ready to faint," she exclaimed. "Catch me,
  Dick&mdash;catch me!"</p>

  <p>"Answer 'yes' or 'no,' or I won't," he rejoined.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, 'yes!' if I must say something," she replied.</p>

  <p>Poor Dick fell back, as if struck by a shot.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it," cried Sir Thomas.</p>

  <p>"Nor I either," said Dick, recovering himself. "I don't believe she could
  do such a wicked thing. Besides, it was the foreign ambassador, there," he
  added, pointing to De Gondomar, "who seemed most enamoured of her yesterday;
  and I shouldn't have been so much surprised if she had gone to see him.
  Perhaps she did," he continued, addressing the poor damsel, who again hung
  her head.</p>

  <p>"I can take upon me to affirm that such was not the case," observed De
  Gondomar.</p>

  <p>"Have you the lock of hair with you?" whispered Sir Thomas to his
  lady.</p>

  <p>"I have," she replied, taking a small packet from her bosom.</p>

  <p>The movement did not pass unnoticed by Lord Roos and the Spanish
  Ambassador, between whom an almost imperceptible smile passed.</p>

  <p>"If you have put all the interrogations you desire to make to Gillian,
  Madam," said Lord Roos to his mother-in-law, "perhaps she may be permitted to
  depart? The situation cannot be agreeable to her."</p>

  <p>"A moment more, my lord," cried Lady Lake. "If I detain her it is to clear
  her character. I know her to be perfectly innocent."</p>

  <p>At this announcement, Dick Taverner's countenance brightened, and he
  extended his arms towards Gillian, who gladly availed herself of his
  support.</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure she was not the person I surprised in your chamber last
  night," continued Lady Lake.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, Madam! How do you arrive at that conviction?"</p>

  <p>"Because that person's hair was jet black, whereas Gillian's, as we see,
  is of the exactly opposite colour."</p>

  <p>Dick Taverner could not help pressing his lips against the back of the
  pretty damsel's neck as this was uttered.</p>

  <p>"Your proof of this, Madam?" demanded Lord Roos.</p>

  <p>"Behold it!" she cried. "This look of hair was cut off before your
  visitant escaped, and has remained in my possession ever since. Ha! how is
  this?" she exclaimed, as she unfolded the packet, and disclosed a tress of
  fair hair, evidently matching Gillian's lint-white locks. "What
  transformation has taken place! Witchcraft has been practised. This is the
  Countess's work."</p>

  <p>"The minion must have been there, after all," cried Dick Taverner,
  thrusting Gillian from him.</p>

  <p>"The charge of witchcraft will not serve your turn, Madam," said Lord Roos
  derisively. "The explanation is simple. Your eyes have deceived you."</p>

  <p>"Most palpably," cried the Conde de Gondomar, who had caught Gillian in
  his arms, as the jealous apprentice cast her from him. "I am afraid her
  ladyship cannot see very clearly."</p>

  <p>"I see clearly enough that a trick has been practised upon me," Lady Lake
  rejoined sharply. "But let Lord Roos look to himself. I will have my revenge,
  and a terrible one it shall be."</p>

  <p>"Do not commit yourself," said Sir Thomas in a low tone.</p>

  <p>"Your business here is at an end, fair maiden," said the Conde de Gondomar
  to Gillian; "and as your lover abandons you, I am ready to take charge of
  you."</p>

  <p>So saying he led her forth, followed by Lord Roos, whose smile of triumph
  exasperated his mother-in-law almost beyond endurance.</p>

  <p>For a moment Dick Tayerner remained irresolute; but his mistress had no
  sooner disappeared, than he rushed after her, vowing he would have her back
  if it cost him his life.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-27"
     name="ch1-27">CHAPTER XXVII.<br>
  The Puritan's Prison.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Hugh Calveley, it has already been intimated, was lodged in
  a vault beneath the gateway. The place was commonly used as a sort of
  black-hole for the imprisonment of any refractory member of the royal
  household, or soldier on guard guilty of neglect of duty. Circular in shape,
  it contained a large pillar, to which iron rings and chains were attached.
  The walls were of stone, the roof arched with ribs springing from the pillar
  that supported it, and the floor was paved. Window there was none; but air
  was admitted through a small grated aperture in the roof; and thus
  imperfectly ventilated, it will not be wondered at that the vault should be
  damp. Moisture constantly trickled down the walls, and collected in pools on
  the broken pavement; but unwholesome as it was, and altogether unfit for
  occupation, it was deemed good enough for those generally thrust into it, and
  far too good for its present tenant.</p>

  <p>As the prisoner exhibited no violence, the thongs with which his hands
  were bound were removed on his entrance to the vault, and he was allowed the
  free use of his limbs. The breast-plate in which he was clad was taken from
  him, and his vesture was again closely searched, but no further discovery was
  made either of concealed weapon, or of any paper or letter tending to show
  that he had accomplices in his dread design. The only thing found upon him,
  indeed, was a small Bible, and this, after it had been examined, he was
  permitted to retain. To the interrogatories put to him by Master Dendy, the
  serjeant-at-arms, he returned the briefest answers; and when he had said as
  much as he thought fit, he obstinately refused to make further reply.</p>

  <p>Incensed at his perversity, and determined to extort a full confession, in
  order that it might be laid before the King, the serjeant-at-arms ordered the
  manacles to be applied. But though the torture was exquisite, he bore it with
  firmness, and without uttering a groan; maintaining the same determined
  silence as before. Had he dared, Master Dendy would have had recourse to
  severer measures; but having no warrant for any such proceeding, he was
  obliged to content himself with threats. To these Hugh Calveley replied by a
  grim smile of contempt; but as the serjeant-at-arms was departing to make his
  report to Sir Thomas Lake, he said, "I have something to disclose; but it is
  for the King's ear alone."</p>

  <p>"Better reveal it to me," rejoined Dendy, halting. "I have it in my power
  to render your situation far more tolerable, or to inflict greater torment
  upon you. Make your choice."</p>

  <p>"Deal with me as you please," returned Hugh Calveley sternly. "What I have
  to say is to the King, and to the King only; and though you break every bone
  in my body with your engines, and tear off my flesh with red-hot pincers, you
  shall not force the secret from me."</p>

  <p>Master Dendy looked at him, and felt disposed to place him in the dreadful
  instrument of torture called Skeffington's irons, which was hanging against
  the wall; but the consideration that had hitherto restrained
  him&mdash;namely, that he was without authority for the step, and might be
  called to account for it&mdash;weighed with him still; wherefore he contented
  himself with ordering the prisoner to be chained to the pillar; and having
  seen the injunction obeyed, he left him.</p>

  <p>In this miserable plight Hugh Calveley remained for some hours, without
  light and without food. How the time was passed none knew; but the two yeomen
  of the guard who entered the vault found him on his knees absorbed in prayer.
  They brought a lamp with them, and refreshments of a better kind than those
  usually afforded to a prisoner, and set them before him. But he refused to
  partake of them. The only favour he besought was permission to read his
  Bible; and the lamp placed within reach, he was soon deeply engrossed in the
  perusal of those pages from which, when earnestly sought, consolation has
  ever been derived under the most trying circumstances.</p>

  <p>Sir Jocelyn had forborne to visit the prisoner from a fear that his
  presence might be painful; but the office imposed upon him by the King left
  him no alternative; and about midnight he descended to the vault, to
  ascertain from personal inspection that Hugh Calveley was in safe custody.
  The door was unlocked by the halberdier stationed at it, and the young man
  found himself alone with the prisoner. He was inexpressibly shocked by the
  spectacle he beheld, as he had no idea how severely the unfortunate Puritan
  had been treated, nor of the sort of prison in which he was confined.</p>

  <p>Hugh Calveley, who was still intently reading the Bible, which he had
  placed upon his knee while he held the lamp near it, to throw the light upon
  its leaves, did not appear to be disturbed by the opening of the door, nor
  did he raise his eyes. But, at last, a deep groan issuing from the breast of
  the young man aroused him, and he held up the lamp to ascertain who was near.
  On discovering that it was Sir Jocelyn, he knitted his brow, and, after
  sternly regarding him for a moment, returned to his Bible, without uttering a
  word; but finding the other maintained his post, he demanded, almost
  fiercely, why he was disturbed?</p>

  <p>"Can I do aught for your relief?" rejoined the young man. "At least, I can
  have those chains taken off."</p>

  <p>"Thou speakest as one in authority," cried Hugh Calveley, regarding him,
  fixedly. "Art thou appointed to be my jailer?"</p>

  <p>Sir Jocelyn made no answer, but averted his head.</p>

  <p>"This only was wanting to fill up the measure of my scorn for thee,"
  pursued the Puritan. "Thou art worthy of thine office. But show me no favour,
  for I will receive none at thy hands. I would rather wear these fetters to my
  death, however much they may gall my limbs, than have them struck off by
  thee. I would rather rot in this dungeon&mdash;ay, though it were worse than
  it is&mdash;than owe my liberation to thee. The sole favour thou canst show
  me is to rid me of thy presence, which is hateful to me, and chases holy
  thoughts from my breast, putting evil in their place."</p>

  <p>"Why should this be so, O friend of my father?" exclaimed Sir Jocelyn.
  "And why should my presence be hateful to you? There is no man living whom I
  would less willingly offend than yourself; and in all I have done, where you
  have been concerned, I have had no free agency. Judge me not then too
  harshly. I commiserate your situation from the depths of my heart, and would
  relieve it were it possible."</p>

  <p>"Then wherefore persist in troubling me?" rejoined Hugh Calveley. "Have I
  not good cause for my dislike of you? You have disappointed the expectations
  I had formed of you. You failed me when I put your professions to the test.
  You thwarted my design at the moment when its success was certain, and when
  the tyrant was completely in my power. But for you I should not be here,
  loaded with these fetters; or if I were, I should be consoled by the thought
  that I had liberated my country from oppression, instead of being crushed by
  the sense of failure. What seek you from me, miserable time-server? Have you
  not had your reward for the service you have rendered the King? Is he not
  grateful enough? I have served as your stepping-stone to promotion. What more
  can I do?"</p>

  <p>"You can cease to do me injustice," returned Sir Jocelyn. "Honours,
  procured as mine have been, are valueless, and I would rather be without
  them. I sought them not. They have been forced upon me. Look at the matter
  fairly, and you will see that all these consequences, whether for good or
  ill, have sprung from your own desperate act."</p>

  <p>"It may be so," rejoined the Puritan. "I will not dispute it. But though
  ill has accrued to me, and good to you, I would not change positions with
  you. You will wear the tyrant's fetters for ever. I shall soon be free from
  mine."</p>

  <p>"Have you nothing to say concerning your daughter?" demanded the young
  man.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," replied the Puritan, with an expression of deep pain, which,
  however, he checked by a mighty effort. "I have done with the world, and
  desire not to be brought back to it."</p>

  <p>"And you refuse to be freed from your chains?"</p>

  <p>"My sole desire, as I have said, is to be freed from you."</p>

  <p>"That wish, at least, shall be granted," replied Sir Jocelyn, as, with a
  sad heart, he departed.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-28"
     name="ch1-28">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br>
  The Secret.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Thrice was the guard relieved during that long night, and as
  often was the prisoner visited. On the first occasion, he was found to be
  still engaged with his Bible, and he so continued during the whole time the
  man remained in the vault.</p>

  <p>The next who came discovered him on his knees, praying loudly and
  fervently, and, unwilling to disturb him, left him at his devotions.</p>

  <p>But the third who entered was struck with terror at the prisoner's
  appearance. He had risen from the ground, and was standing as erect as the
  fetters would permit, with his hands outstretched, and his eyes fixed on
  vacancy. He was muttering something, but his words were unintelligible. He
  looked like one who beheld a vision; and this impression was produced upon
  the man, who half expected some awful shape to reveal itself to him. But
  whatever it might be, spirit of good or ill, it was visible to the Puritan
  alone.</p>

  <p>After gazing at him for some minutes, in mixed wonderment and fright, the
  halberdier ventured to draw near him. As he touched him, the Puritan uttered
  a fearful cry, and attempted to spring forward, as if to grasp some vanishing
  object, but being checked in the effort by the chain, he fell heavily to the
  ground, and seemed to sustain severe injury; for when the man raised him, and
  set him against the pillar, though he made no complaint, it was evident he
  suffered excruciating pain. The halberdier poured out a cup of wine, and
  offered it to him; but, though well-nigh fainting, he peremptorily refused
  it.</p>

  <p>From this moment a marked change was perceptible in his looks. The hue of
  his skin became cadaverous; his eyes grew dim and glassy; and his respiration
  was difficult. Everything betokened that his sufferings would be speedily
  over, and that, however he might deserve it, Hugh Calveley would be spared
  the disgrace of death by the hands of the executioner. The halberdier was not
  unaware of his condition, and his first impulse was to summon assistance; but
  he was deterred from doing so by the earnest entreaty of the Puritan to be
  left alone; and thinking this the most merciful course he could pursue under
  the circumstances, he yielded to the request, scarcely expecting to behold
  him alive again.</p>

  <p>It was by this same man that the door of the vault was opened to Sir
  Jocelyn and Aveline.</p>

  <p>The shock experienced by the maiden at the sight of her father had
  well-nigh overcome her. She thought him dead, and such was Sir Jocelyn's
  first impression. The unfortunate Puritan was still propped against the
  pillar, as the halberdier had left him, but his head had fallen to one side,
  and his arms hung listlessly down. With a piercing shriek his daughter flew
  towards him, and kneeling beside him, raised his head gently, and gazing
  eagerly into his face, perceived that he still lived, though the spirit
  seemed ready to wing its flight from its fleshly tabernacle.</p>

  <p>The situation was one to call forth every latent energy in Aveline's
  character. Controlling her emotion, she uttered no further cry, but set
  herself, with calmness, to apply such restoratives as were at hand to her
  father. After bathing his temples and chafing his hands, she had the
  satisfaction, ere long, of seeing him open his eyes. At first, he seemed to
  have a difficulty in fixing his gaze upon her, but her voice reached his
  ears, and the feeble pressure of his hand told that he knew her.</p>

  <p>The power of speech returned to him at length, and he faintly murmured,
  "My child, I am glad to see you once more. I thought all was over; but it has
  pleased Heaven to spare me for a few moments to give you my blessing. Bow
  down your head, O my daughter, and take it; and though given by a sinner like
  myself, it shall profit you! May the merciful God, who pardoneth all that
  repent, even at the last hour, and watcheth over the orphan, bless you, and
  protect you!"</p>

  <p>"Amen!" exclaimed Jocelyn, fervently.</p>

  <p>"Who was it spoke?" demanded the Puritan. And as no answer was returned,
  he repeated the inquiry.</p>

  <p>"It was I&mdash;Jocelyn Mounchensey, the son of your old friend," replied
  the young man.</p>

  <p>"Come nigh to me, Jocelyn," said the dying man. "I have done you wrong,
  and entreat your pardon."</p>

  <p>"O, talk not thus!" cried Jocelyn, springing towards him. "I have nothing
  to forgive, but much to be forgiven."</p>

  <p>"You have a noble heart, Jocelyn," rejoined Hugh Calveley; "and in that
  respect resemble your father. In his name, I conjure you to listen to me. You
  will not refuse my dying request. I have a sacred trust to commit to
  you."</p>

  <p>"Name it!" cried the young man; "and rest assured it shall be
  fulfilled."</p>

  <p>"Give me some wine," gasped the Puritan, faintly. "My strength is failing
  fast, and it may revive me."</p>

  <p>And with, great effort he swallowed a few drops from the cup filled for
  him by Jocelyn. Still, his appearance was so alarming, that the young man
  could not help urging him not to delay.</p>

  <p>"I understand," replied Hugh Calveley, slightly pressing his hand. "You
  think I have no time to lose; and you are right. My child, then, is the trust
  I would confide to you. Son, behold thy sister! Daughter, behold thy
  brother!"</p>

  <p>"I will be more than a brother to her," cried Sir Jocelyn, earnestly.</p>

  <p>"More thou canst not be," rejoined Hugh Calveley; "unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Unless what?" demanded Sir Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>"I cannot explain," cried the Puritan, with an expression of agony; "there
  is not time. Suffice it, she is already promised in marriage."</p>

  <p>"Father!" exclaimed Aveline, in surprise, and with something of reproach.
  "I never heard of such an engagement before. It has been made without my
  consent."</p>

  <p>"I charge you to fulfil it, nevertheless, my child, if it be required,"
  said Hugh Calveley, solemnly. "Promise me this, or I shall not die content.
  Speak! Let me hear you."</p>

  <p>And she reluctantly gave the required promise.</p>

  <p>Sir Jocelyn uttered an exclamation of anguish.</p>

  <p>"What afflicts you, my son?" demanded the Puritan.</p>

  <p>"To whom have you promised your daughter in marriage?" inquired the young
  man. "You have constituted me her brother, and I am therefore entitled to
  inquire."</p>

  <p>"You will learn when the demand is made," said the Puritan. "You will then
  know why I have given the promise, and the nature of the obligation imposed
  upon my daughter to fulfil it."</p>

  <p>"But is this obligation ever to remain binding?" demanded Sir Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>"If the claim be not made within a year after my death, she is discharged
  from it," replied Hugh Calveley.</p>

  <p>"O, thanks, father, thanks!" exclaimed Aveline.</p>

  <p>At this moment the door of the vault was thrown open, and two persons
  entered, the foremost of whom Sir Jocelyn instantly recognised as the King.
  The other was his Majesty's physician, Doctor Mayerne Turquet. A glance
  sufficed to explain to the latter the state of the Puritan.</p>

  <p>"Ah! parbleu! the man is dying, your Majesty," he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Deeing! is he?" cried James. "The mair reason he suld tell his secret, to
  us without procrastination. Harkye, prophet of ill!" he continued, as he
  strode forward. "The judgment of Heaven ye predicated for us, seems to have
  fallen on your ainsell, and to have laid you low, even afore our arm could
  touch you. Ye have gude reason to be thankful you have escaped the woodie;
  sae e'en make a clean breast of it, confess your enormities, and reveal to us
  the secret matter whilk we are tauld ye hae to communicate!"</p>

  <p>"Let all else withdraw a few paces," said Hugh Calveley, "and do thou, O
  King, approach me. What I have to say is for thine ear alone."</p>

  <p>"There will be no danger in granting his request?" inquired James of his
  physician.</p>

  <p>"None whatever," replied Doctor Mayerne Turquet. "The only danger is in
  delay. Your Majesty should lose no time. The man is passing rapidly away. A
  few moments more, and he will have ceased to exist."</p>

  <p>On a sign from the King, Sir Jocelyn then stepped aside, but Aveline
  refused to quit her father, even for a moment.</p>

  <p>As James drew near, Hugh Calveley raised himself a little in order to
  address him. "I say unto thee, O King," he cried, "as Elijah said unto Ahab,
  'Because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the
  Lord&mdash;behold! I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy
  posterity. And I will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of
  Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation
  wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.'"</p>

  <p>"Now the muckle Diel seize thee, villain!" exclaimed James furiously. "Is
  it to listen to thy texts that thou hast brought me hither?" And as Hugh
  Calveley, exhausted by the effort he had made, fell back with a groan, he
  bent his head towards him, crying, "The secret, man, the secret! or the
  tormenter shall wring it from thee?"</p>

  <p>The Puritan essayed to speak, but his voice was so low that it did not
  reach the ears of the King.</p>

  <p>"What sayest thou?" he demanded. "Speak louder. Saul of our body!" he
  exclaimed, after a moment's pause, during which the sudden alteration that
  took place in the prisoner's features made him suspect that all was over.
  "Our belief is he will never speak again. He hath escaped us, and ta'en his
  secret wi' him."</p>

  <p>A loud shriek burst from Aveline, as she fell upon her father's lifeless
  body.</p>

  <p>"Let us forth," cried the King, stopping his ears. "We carena to be
  present at scenes like this. We hae had a gude riddance o' this traitor,
  though we wad hae gladly heard what he had to tell. Sir Jocelyn Mounchensey,
  ye will see that this young woman be cared for; and when ye have caused her
  to be removed elsewhere, follow us to the tennis-court, to which we shall
  incontinently adjourn."</p>

  <p>So saying, he quitted the vault with his physician.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-29"
     name="ch1-29">CHAPTER XXIX.<br>
  Luke Hatton.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Feigning sudden indisposition (and the excuse was not
  altogether without foundation), the Countess of Exeter quitted Theobalds
  Palace on the day after her unlucky visit to Lord Roos's chamber, and
  proceeded to her husband's residence at Wimbledon, where she was speedily
  joined by her lover, who brought her word of the advantage he had gained over
  their foe.</p>

  <p>"I have fairly checkmated my gracious mother-in-law," he cried, with a
  laugh; "and it would have diverted you as much as it did me and De Gondomar,
  who was present on the occasion, if you could have witnessed her rage and
  mortification, when she discovered the change that had been effected; and
  that in place of your magnificent black ringlet (which I now wear next my
  heart, and shall ever keep as a love-token), she had only a sorry specimen of
  your hand-maiden's lint-white locks. As I live, it was truly laughable. The
  good lady would have annihilated me if she could; and threatened me with
  terrible reprisals. At first, she tried to attribute the transformation,
  which she could not otherwise account for, to witchcraft; and though I
  derided the charge, I must needs say, the trick was so cleverly performed,
  that it <i>did</i> look like magic. The packet containing the tress of hair
  had never been out of her own keeping. This she affirmed; and it was true.
  But there was a friendly hand to open it nevertheless; to purloin its
  priceless treasure; and to substitute something of a similar kind, though of
  comparatively little value in its place. That hand,&mdash;one not likely to
  be suspected, was no other than that of my lady's confidential attendant,
  Sarah Swarton. The juggle was played by her at the instance of Diego.
  Anticipating some such occurrence as the present, and desirous of having a
  spy upon the movements of our enemies, I some time since directed Diego to
  pay secret court to Sarah, and my forethought has now been rewarded. The main
  difficulty lay with poor Gillian. She was greatly embarrassed by her
  situation; and her perplexity was increased by the presence of a jealous
  lover in the shape of an apprentice, who refused to leave her till his doubts
  should be satisfied. This was awkward, as the story could not be very well
  reconciled so as to suit all parties. Accordingly, when the discovery was
  made, which seemed to proclaim the poor girl's infidelity, the youth's rage
  and consternation were nearly equal to Lady Lake's; a circumstance that added
  considerable zest to the comedy. But I see it does not divert you so much as
  I expected, and therefore, to relieve your mind, I may tell you that the
  jealous varlet soon repented of his rash determination, and pursuing his
  mistress, whom Do Gondomar had considerately taken under his protection,
  prevailed upon her to give the amorous ambassador the slip, and return with
  him to her father's abode at Tottenham."</p>

  <p>"I am right glad to hear it," said the Countess. "Though I have seen so
  little of Gillian, I cannot help taking an interest in her; she is so pretty,
  and so innocent in appearance, and her manners are so artless and engaging. I
  owe her some reparation for the mischief I have done her, and will not
  neglect to make it. I am sorry I ever was induced by you to take her into my
  service; and I am thankful to hear she has escaped De Gondomar's snares."</p>

  <p>"You are wonderfully interested about her, methinks, Frances; and I hope
  she will be grateful for your consideration," rejoined Lord Roos, with a
  laugh. "But I should not be surprised if De Gondomar still gained his point.
  It is not his way to give up a pursuit he has once undertaken. However, to
  leave the pretty damsel to her fate, which will depend entirely on her own
  conduct, let us return to ourselves. We have good reason to be satisfied with
  the issue of this adventure of the lock of hair. Nevertheless, that
  recurrence to the charge of witchcraft on the part of my vindictive
  mother-in-law shows the extent of her malice, and I cannot doubt that in
  threatening me with reprisals she will be as good as her word. It behoves us,
  therefore, to be beforehand with her. What she may intend I cannot say, but I
  am satisfied she has a formidable scheme on foot, and that nothing but her
  husband's interposition prevented its disclosure when she was so violently
  incensed against me."</p>

  <p>"You fill me with terror, William," exclaimed the Countess. "Will this
  woman's hostility towards me never cease?"</p>

  <p>"Never," replied Lord Roos, with a sudden change of manner, and laying
  aside the levity he had hitherto exhibited. "There is but one way of ending
  the struggle. Luke Hatton can help us to it. Persuaded we should require him,
  I have brought him with me. He waits in the hall below with Diego. Shall I
  summon him to our conference?"</p>

  <p>"On no account," exclaimed Lady Exeter hastily; "I will not see him. You
  have done wrong to bring that poisoner here, my lord. You will destroy
  me."</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Frances," replied Lord Roos. "The next step taken by Lady
  Lake will be fatal to us. There must be no delay, no irresolution on our
  part, or all is lost. I cannot depend upon myself, or I would not call in
  another's aid. You will comprehend how wanting in firmness I am, when I tell
  you what happened the other night. Incredible as it may sound, my wife, in
  order to prove her devotion to me and to free me from further annoyance on
  her part, offered to take poison; and but for my interference (fool that I
  was to stay her!) would have drained the phial containing the deadly potion.
  The weakness was momentary, and I reproached myself for it when too late. But
  it convinced me that a firmer hand than mine must be employed in the
  task."</p>

  <p>"And can you, after what you have related, William,&mdash;can you
  seriously meditate the destruction of a fond woman, who has generosity enough
  to lay down her life for you? This is more incredible than the
  rest&mdash;more monstrously wicked."</p>

  <p>"Wicked it may be; but the excuse&mdash;if I have any&mdash;lies in my
  overwhelming passion for you, Frances," replied Lord Roos in a frenzied tone.
  "And it seems decided by the relentless destiny that governs me, that the
  continued indulgence of the fatal passion shall only be purchased at the
  price of my soul. That penalty I am prepared to pay rather than lose you. I
  will become obdurate, will turn my heart to stone, so that it shall no more
  melt at the tears of this fond, foolish woman; and I will slay her without
  remorse. Any other obstacle between us shall be removed;&mdash;be it her
  mother, her father&mdash;your husband! I will immolate a hundred victims at
  the altar of our love. I will shrink from nothing to make you mine for ever.
  For I would rather share eternal bale with you, Frances, than immortal bliss
  with another."</p>

  <p>"You almost make me fancy some evil being has obtained possession of you,
  William," said the Countess, gazing at him with affright.</p>

  <p>"It may be that the Fiend himself hath accepted my wild offer," he
  rejoined gloomily; "but if my wish be granted it matters not."</p>

  <p>"I will not listen to such fearful impiety," said the Countess,
  shuddering. "Let us dismiss this subject for the present, and recur to it
  when you are calmer."</p>

  <p>"It cannot be postponed, Frances. Time presses, and even now Lady Lake may
  have got the start of us. I shall be calm enough when this is over. Will you
  consent to see Luke Hatton?"</p>

  <p>"Why need I see him?" inquired the Countess with increasing uneasiness.
  "Why will you force his hateful presence upon me? If the deed must be done,
  why can you not alone undertake it?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell why I cannot," he replied in a sombre tone, and regarding her
  fixedly. "I must have a partner in the crime. It will bind us to each other
  in links not to be severed. I shall have no fear of losing you then,
  Countess. I go to bring Luke Hatton to you."</p>

  <p>And without waiting for her reply he strode out of the room. Lady Exeter
  would have arrested him, but she had not the nerve to do so, and with an
  exclamation of anguish she fell back in her chair.</p>

  <p>"What dominion sin has usurped over me!" she mentally ejaculated. "I have
  lost the power of resisting its further encroachment. I see the enormity of
  the offence I am about to commit, and though my soul revolts at it, I cannot
  hold back. I am as one on the brink of a precipice, who beholds the dreadful
  gulf before him, into which another step must plunge him, yet is too giddy to
  retreat, and must needs fall over. Pity me, kind Heaven! I am utterly
  helpless without thy aid."</p>

  <p>While the unhappy lady thus unavailingly deplored the sad position in
  which her own misconduct had placed her, and from which she felt wholly
  incapable of extricating herself; while in this wretched frame of mind, she
  awaited her lover's return,&mdash;with, as we have shown, some remains of
  good struggling with the evil in her bosom,&mdash;we will cast a hasty glance
  round the chamber in which she sat. And we are prompted to do this, not
  because it merits particular description, but because it was the room
  referred to by Lady Lake as the scene of the confession she had forged.</p>

  <p>The apartment, then, was spacious and handsomely furnished in the heavy
  taste of the period, with but little to distinguish it from other rooms
  visited by us in the course of this story. Like most of them, it had a gloomy
  air, caused by the dark hue of its oaken panels, and the heavy folds of its
  antiquated and faded tapestry. The latter was chiefly hung against the lower
  end of the chamber, and served as a screen to one of the doors. At the
  opposite end, there was a wide and deep bay window, glowing with stained
  glass, amid the emblazonry of which might be discerned the proud escutcheon
  of the house of Exeter, with the two lions rampant forming its supporters. On
  the right of the enormous carved mantel-piece, which, with its pillars,
  statues, 'scutcheons, and massive cornice, mounted to the very ceiling, was
  hung a portrait of the Earl of Exeter&mdash;a grave, dignified personage,
  clad in the attire of Elizabeth's time; and on the left, was a likeness of
  the Countess herself, painted in all the pride of her unequalled beauty, and
  marvellous in resemblance then; but how different in expression from her
  features now!</p>

  <p>In the recess of the window stood an oak table, covered with a piece of
  rich carpet fringed with gold, on which a massive silver inkstand and
  materials for writing were placed; and this table was seized upon by Lady
  Lake as a feature in her plot. Here she would have it the confession was
  signed by the Countess.</p>

  <p>Another point in reference to this scheme must not be passed unnoticed. We
  have mentioned the heavy hangings at the lower end of the room. According to
  the plotter, it was behind these that Sarah Swarton&mdash;the intended
  witness of the imaginary scene&mdash;was concealed. The principal subjects
  represented on the arras were the Judgment of Solomon, and the Temptation of
  our first Parents in the Garden by the Serpent. The hangings had evidently
  not been removed for years, and did not reach within two feet of the
  ground&mdash;a circumstance that had escaped the attention of Lady
  Lake&mdash;proving the truth of her husband's observation, that in the best
  contrived plot some imperfection will exist certain to operate in its
  detection.</p>

  <p>To return to the unhappy Countess. So lost was she in reflection, that she
  did not remark Lord Roos's return till made aware of it by a slight touch on
  the shoulder. When she raised her eyes, they fell upon an object that
  inspired her with the dread and aversion that a noxious reptile might have
  produced. She had never seen Luke Hatton before; and if she had figured him
  to her mind at all, it was not as anything agreeable; but she was not
  prepared for so hideous and revolting a personage as he appeared to be. His
  face was like an ugly mask, on which a sardonic grin was stamped. His
  features were large and gaunt, and he had the long, hooked nose, and the
  sharp-pointed bestial ears of a satyr, with leering eyes&mdash;betokening at
  once sensuality and cunning. He had the chin and beard of a goat, and
  crisply-curled hair of a pale yellow colour. With all this, there was
  something sordid in his looks as well as his attire, which showed that to his
  other vices he added that of avarice. A mock humility, belied by the
  changeless sneer upon his countenance, distinguished his deportment. It could
  be seen at once that, however cringing he might be, he despised the person he
  addressed. Moreover, in spite of all his efforts to control it, there was
  something sarcastic in his speech. His doublet and hose, both of which had
  endured some service, and were well-nigh threadbare, were tawny-coloured; and
  he wore a short yellow cloak, a great ruff of the same colour, and carried a
  brown steeple-crowned hat in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I await your ladyship's commands," said Luke Hatton, bowing
  obsequiously.</p>

  <p>"I have none to give you," Lady Exeter rejoined with irrepressible
  disgust. "I have not sent for you. Go hence."</p>

  <p>Not at all abashed by this reception, Luke Hatton maintained his place,
  and threw an inquiring glance at Lord Roos.</p>

  <p>"My dear Countess," said the young nobleman, seating himself negligently
  upon a tabouret beside her, "I must pray you not to dismiss this worthy man
  so hastily. You will find him eminently serviceable; and as to his
  trustworthiness, I have the best reasons for feeling satisfied of it, because
  I hold in my hand a noose, which, whenever I please, I can tighten round his
  neck. Of this he is quite aware, and therefore he will serve us faithfully,
  as well from fear as from gratitude."</p>

  <p>"Her ladyship may place entire confidence in me," remarked Luke Hatton,
  with a grin. "This is not the first affair of the kind in which I have been
  engaged. I have prepared potions and powders which Mistress Turner (with
  whose reputation your ladyship must needs be acquainted) used to vend to her
  customers. My draughts have removed many a troublesome husband, and silenced
  many a jealous wife. I have helped many an heir to the speedy enjoyment of an
  inheritance, which, but for my assistance, would not have come to him for
  years. The lover with a rival in his way, who has come to me, has soon been
  freed from all anxiety on that score. The courtier, eager for a post which a
  superior held, has gained it by my aid. Yet none of those whom I have thus
  benefited have been suspected. Your ladyship, I repeat, need have no fears of
  me&mdash;and no scruples with me. State your wishes, and they shall be
  implicitly obeyed."</p>

  <p>"I have no wish, except to be relieved of a presence which is disagreeable
  to me," replied the Countess.</p>

  <p>Again Luke Hatton consulted Lord Roos with a regard.</p>

  <p>"I find I must act for her ladyship," said the young nobleman. "You will
  take, therefore, the instructions I shall give you, as proceeding from her.
  What two names do you find upon that paper?"</p>

  <p>"Those of your lordship's wife and mother-in-law," returned Luke
  Hatton.</p>

  <p>"You comprehend what her ladyship would have done with those persons?"
  said Lord Roos, looking at him steadfastly.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," replied Luke Hatton.</p>

  <p>"O, do not give this fatal order, my Lord!" cried Lady Exeter,
  trembling.</p>

  <p>"How many days do you require to effect their removal?" demanded Lord
  Roos, without appearing to notice her remark.</p>

  <p>"I do not require many hours," replied Luke Hatton; "but it will be well
  not to be too precipitate. Neither must they die at the same time. All
  precaution shall be taken. The names are placed in a particular order. Is it
  so the Countess would have them taken? In that case I must commence with Lady
  Roos."</p>

  <p>"Wretch! dost thou dare to make such an appeal to me?" cried Lady Exeter
  rising. "Begone, instantly, I say. Thou hast no order whatever from me; or if
  thou fanciest so, I revoke it."</p>

  <p>"The order cannot be revoked," cried Lord Roos, grasping her arm. "This is
  not a time for hesitation or repentance. Having commenced the work, you must
  go through with it&mdash;whether you will or not."</p>

  <p>"Whether I will or not!" exclaimed Lady Exeter, regarding him with angry
  surprise. "Have I heard you aright, my Lord? Am I to be forced into
  association in this foul deed? Have I sunk so low in your esteem that you
  venture to treat me thus?"</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, Frances&mdash;pardon me!" he cried, imploringly. "I have said
  more than I intended. If I appear to exercise undue influence over you now,
  you will forgive me hereafter, because the situation is one that requires
  decision, and that quality I possess in a higher degree than yourself. Luke
  Hatton must obey the orders given him. And you must sanction them."</p>

  <p>"Never!" she exclaimed, emphatically.</p>

  <p>"Then we part for ever," cried Lord Roos. "No matter what the pang may
  be&mdash;nor what befals me&mdash;I will go. Farewell for ever,
  Countess!"</p>

  <p>"Stay!" she cried. "We must not part thus."</p>

  <p>"Then you consent?" he exclaimed. "Luke Hatton receives his orders from
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Ask me not that question!" she cried, with a shudder.</p>

  <p>"If her ladyship will but sign this," said Luke Hatton, holding towards
  her the paper on which the names were written, "it will suffice for me."</p>

  <p>"You hear what he says, Frances. You will do it?" cried Lord Roos. "'Tis
  but a few strokes of a pen."</p>

  <p>"Those few strokes will cost me my soul," she rejoined. "But if it must he
  so, it must. Give me the pen."</p>

  <p>And as Lord Roos complied, she signed the paper.</p>

  <p>"Nov you may go," said Lord Roos to Luke Hatton, who received the paper
  with a diabolical grin. "You may count upon your reward."</p>

  <p>"In a week's time, my lord," said Luke Hatton, still grinning, and
  shifting his glance from the half-fainting Countess to the young nobleman;
  "in a week's time" he repeated, "you will have to put on mourning for your
  wife&mdash;and in a month for your mother-in-law."</p>

  <p>And with a cringing bow, and moving with a soft cat-like footstep, he
  quitted the room, leaving the guilty pair alone together.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="bk2"

  <br></h2><a id="ch2-1"
        name="ch2-1">CHAPTER I.<br>
  Poison.<br>
  <br></a>

  <p>The execution of Lady Lake's criminal and vindictive project would not
  have been long deferred, after the defeat she had sustained from Lord Roos,
  but for her husband's determined opposition. This may appear surprising in a
  man so completely under his wife's governance as was Sir Thomas; but the more
  he reflected upon the possible consequences of the scheme, the more averse to
  it he became; and finding all arguments unavailing to dissuade his lady from
  her purpose, he at last summoned up resolution enough positively to interdict
  it.</p>

  <p>But the project was only deferred, and not abandoned. The forged
  confession was kept in readiness by Lady Lake for production on the first
  favourable opportunity.</p>

  <p>Not less disinclined to the measure than her father was Lady Roos, though
  the contrary had been represented to Sir Thomas by his lady; but accustomed
  to yield blind obedience to her mother's wishes, she had been easily worked
  upon to acquiesce in the scheme, especially as the fabricated confession did
  not appear to hurt her husband, for whom (though she did not dare to exhibit
  it) she maintained a deep and unchanging affection. So utterly heart-broken
  was she by the prolonged and painful struggle she had undergone, that she was
  now almost indifferent to its issue.</p>

  <p>For some time her health had given way under the severe shocks she had
  endured; but all at once more dangerous symptoms began to manifest
  themselves, and she became so greatly indisposed that she could not leave her
  room. Extremely distressing in its effects, the attack resembled fever.
  Inextinguishable thirst tormented her; burning pains; throbbing in the
  temples; and violent fluttering of the heart. No alleviation of her
  sufferings could be obtained from the remedies administered by Luke Hatton,
  who was in constant attendance upon her; nor will this be wondered at, since
  we are in the secret of his dark doings. On the contrary, the fever increased
  in intensity; and at the end of four days of unremitting
  agony,&mdash;witnessed with cynical indifference by the causer of the
  mischief,&mdash;it was evident that her case was desperate.</p>

  <p>From the first Lady Lake had been greatly alarmed, for with all her faults
  she was an affectionate mother, though she had a strange way of showing her
  affection; and she was unremitting in her attentions to the sufferer,
  scarcely ever quitting her bedside. After a few days, however, thus spent in
  nursing her daughter, she herself succumbed to a like malady. The same
  devouring internal fire scorched her up, and raged within her veins; the same
  unappeasable thirst tormented her; and unable longer to fulfil her task, she
  confided it to Sarah Swarton, and withdrew to another chamber, communicating
  by a side door, masked by drapery, with that of Lady Roos.</p>

  <p>Devoted to her mistress, Sarah Swarton would have sacrificed her life to
  restore her to health; and she cared not though the fever might be
  infectious. The gentleness and resignation of the ill-fated lady, which
  failed to move Luke Hatton, melted her to tears; and it was with infinite
  grief that she saw her, day by day, sinking slowly but surely into the grave.
  To Lady Roos, the presence of Sarah Swarton was an inexpressible comfort. The
  handmaiden was far superior to her station, with a pleasing countenance, and
  prepossessing manner, and possessed of the soft voice so soothing to the ear
  of pain. But the chief comfort derived by Lady Roos from the society of Sarah
  Swarton, was the power of unbosoming herself to her respecting her husband,
  and of pouring her sorrows into a sympathising ear. Lord Roos had never been
  near his wife since her seizure&mdash;nor, that she could learn, had made any
  inquiries about her; but notwithstanding his heartless conduct, her great
  desire was to behold him once more before she died, and to breathe some last
  words into his ear; and she urged the wish so strongly upon her confidante,
  that the latter promised, if possible, to procure its accomplishment.</p>

  <p>A week had now nearly elapsed&mdash;the fatal term appointed by Luke
  Hatton&mdash;and it could be no longer doubted that, if the last
  gratification sought by Lady Roos were to be afforded her, it must not be
  delayed.</p>

  <p>The poor sufferer was wasted to a skeleton; her cheeks hollow; eyes sunk
  in deep cavities, though the orbs were unnaturally bright; and her frame so
  debilitated, that she could scarcely raise herself from the pillow.</p>

  <p>Sarah Swarton accordingly resolved to set out upon her errand; but before
  doing so, she sought an interview with Lady Lake, for the purpose of
  revealing certain fearful suspicions she had begun to entertain of Luke
  Hatton. She would have done this before, but there was almost insuperable
  difficulty in obtaining a few words in private of her ladyship. The
  apothecary was continually passing from room to room, hovering nigh the
  couches of his patients, as if afraid of leaving them for a moment, and he
  seemed to regard Sarah herself with distrust. But he had now gone forth, and
  she resolved to take advantage of his absence to make her communication.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-2"
     name="ch2-2">CHAPTER II.<br>
  Counter-Poison.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The physical tortures endured by Lady Lake were exceeded by
  her mental anguish. While the poison raged within her veins, the desire of
  vengeance inflamed her breast; and her fear was lest she should expire
  without gratifying it. Bitterly did she now upbraid herself for having
  delayed her vindictive project. More than once she consulted Luke Hatton as
  he stood beside her couch, with the habitual sneer upon his lips, watching
  the progress of his own infernal work, as to the possibility of renovating
  her strength, if only for an hour, in order that she might strike the blow.
  But he shook his head, and bade her wait. Wait, however, she would not, and
  she became at length so impatient, that he agreed to make the experiment,
  telling her he would prepare a draught which should stimulate her into new
  life for a short time, but he would not answer for the after consequences.
  This was enough. She eagerly grasped at the offer. Revenge must be had, cost
  what it would. And it was to prepare the potion which was to effect her brief
  cure that Luke Hatton had quitted her chamber, and left the coast clear for
  Sarah Swarton.</p>

  <p>Startled by the abrupt entrance and looks of the handmaiden, Lady Lake
  anxiously inquired if all was well with her daughter.</p>

  <p>"As well as it, seems ever likely to be with her, my lady," replied Sarah
  Swarton. "She is somewhat easier now. But has your ladyship courage to listen
  to what I have to tell you?"</p>

  <p>"Have I ever shown want of courage, Sarah, that you should put such a
  question?" rejoined Lady Lake, sharply.</p>

  <p>"But this is something frightful, my lady."</p>

  <p>"Then do not hesitate to disclose it."</p>

  <p>"Has your ladyship never thought it a strange illness by which you and my
  Lady Roos have been seized?" said Sarah, coming close up to her, and speaking
  in a low, hurried tone, as if afraid of being overheard, or interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Why should I think it strange, Sarah?" returned Lady Lake, regarding her
  fixedly. "It is a dreadful and infectious fever which I have taken from my
  daughter; and that is the reason why Sir Thomas, and all others, except Luke
  Hatton and yourself, are forbidden to come near us. What we should have done
  without you, Sarah, I know not, for Luke Hatton tells me the rest of the
  household shun us as they would a pestilence. I trust you will escape the
  disorder, and if I am spared your devotion shall be adequately requited. As
  to Luke Hatton, he seems to have no fear of it."</p>

  <p>"He has no reason to be afraid," replied Sarah, significantly. "This is no
  fever, my lady."</p>

  <p>"How!" cried Lady Lake. "Would you set up your ignorance against the skill
  and science of Luke Hatton? Or do you mean to insinuate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I insinuate nothing, my lady," interrupted Sarah; "but I beseech you to
  bear with fortitude the disclosure I am about to make to you. In a word, my
  lady, I am as certain as I am of standing here, that poison has been
  administered both to you and to my Lady Roos."</p>

  <p>At this terrible communication, a mortal sickness came over Lady Lake.
  Thick damps gathered upon her brow, and she fixed her haggard eyes upon
  Sarah.</p>

  <p>"Poisoned!" she muttered; "poisoned! If so, there is but one person who
  can have done it&mdash;but one&mdash;except yourself, Sarah!"</p>

  <p>"If I had committed the crime, should I have come hither to warn you, my
  lady?" rejoined Sarah.</p>

  <p>"Then it must be Luke Hatton."</p>

  <p>"Ay," replied Sarah, looking round anxiously. "It is he. When he did not
  think I noticed him, I chanced to see him pour a few drops from a phial into
  the drink he prepares for your ladyship and my Lady Roos; and my suspicions
  being aroused by his manner as much as by the circumstance, I watched him
  narrowly, and found that this proceeding was repeated with every draught;
  with this difference merely, that the dose was increased in strength by one
  additional drop; the potion administered to your ladyship being some degrees
  less powerful than that given to my dear lady, and no doubt being intended to
  be slower in its effects. That it was poison, I am certain, since I have
  tested it upon myself, by sipping a small quantity of the liquid; and I had
  reason to repent my rashness, for I soon perceived I had the same symptoms of
  illness as those which distress your ladyship."</p>

  <p>"Why did you not caution me sooner, Sarah?" said Lady Lake,
  horror-stricken by this narration.</p>

  <p>"I could not do so, my lady," she replied. "It was only yesterday that I
  arrived at a positive certainty in the matter, and after my imprudence in
  tasting the drink, I was very ill&mdash;indeed I am scarcely well yet; and,
  to tell truth, I was afraid of Luke Hatton, as I am sure he would make away
  with me, without a moment's hesitation, if he fancied I had discovered his
  secret. Oh, I hope he will not come back and find me here."</p>

  <p>"Who can have prompted him to the deed?" muttered Lady Lake. "But why ask,
  since I know my enemies, and therefore know his employers! Not a moment must
  be lost, Sarah. Let Sir Thomas Lake be summoned to me immediately. If he be
  at Theobalds, at Greenwich, or Windsor, let messengers be sent after him,
  praying him to use all possible dispatch in coming to me. I cannot yet decide
  what I will do, but it shall be something terrible. Oh, that I could once
  more confront the guilty pair! And I will do it&mdash;I will do it! Revenge
  will give me strength."</p>

  <p>"I cannot undertake to bring the Countess hither, my lady," said Sarah.
  "But I may now venture to inform you that I am charged with a message from my
  dear lady to her cruel husband, with which I am persuaded he will comply, and
  come to her."</p>

  <p>"Lure him hither, and speedily, by any means you can, Sarah," rejoined
  Lady Lake. "Before you go, help to raise me from my couch, and place me in
  that chair. It is well," she cried, as her wishes were complied with. "I do
  not feel so feeble as I expected. I was sure revenge would give me strength.
  Now give me my black velvet robe, and my coif. Even in this extremity I would
  only appear as beseems me. And hark ye, Sarah, open that drawer, and take out
  the weapon you will find within it. Do as I bid you quickly, wench. I may
  need it."</p>

  <p>"Here it is, my lady," replied Sarah, taking out a dagger, and giving it
  to Lady Lake, who immediately concealed it in the folds of her robe.</p>

  <p>"Now go," pursued the lady; "I am fully prepared. Let not a moment be lost
  in what you have to do. Do not give any alarm. But bid two of the trustiest
  of the household hold themselves in readiness without, and if I strike upon
  the bell to rush in upon the instant. Or if Luke Hatton should come forth,
  let him be detained. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, my lady," replied Sarah, "and I make no doubt they will obey.
  I am sure it has only been Luke Hatton who, by his false representations, has
  kept them away, and I will remove the impression he has produced."</p>

  <p>"Do not explain more than is needful at present," said Lady Lake. "We know
  not precisely how this plot may have been laid, and must take its authors by
  surprise. You were once more intimate than I liked with that Spanish knave,
  Diego. Breathe not a word to him, or all will be repeated to his master."</p>

  <p>"Rest assured I will be careful, my lady. I have seen nothing whatever of
  Diego of late, and care not if I never behold him again. But what is to
  happen to my dear lady?"</p>

  <p>"Leave her to me," replied Lady Lake. "I hope yet to be able to save her.
  Ha! here comes the villain. Away with you, Sarah, and see that my orders are
  obeyed."</p>

  <p>The handmaiden did not require the command to be repeated, but hastily
  quitted the room, casting a terrified look at the apothecary, who entered it
  at the same moment.</p>

  <p>Luke Hatton appeared greatly surprised on finding Lady Lake risen from her
  couch, and could not help exclaiming, as he quickly advanced towards
  her&mdash;"You up, my lady! This is very imprudent, and may defeat my
  plans."</p>

  <p>"No doubt you think so," rejoined Lady Lake; "but knowing you would oppose
  my inclination, I got Sarah to lift me from the couch, and tire me during
  your absence. Have you prepared the mixture?"</p>

  <p>"I have, my lady," he replied, producing a small phial.</p>

  <p>"Give it me," she cried, taking it from him.</p>

  <p>After examining the pale yellow fluid it contained for a moment, she took
  out the glass stopper, and, smelling at it, perceived it to be a very subtle
  and volatile spirit.</p>

  <p>"Is this poison?" she demanded, fixing her eyes keenly upon Luke
  Hatton.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, my lady," he replied, without expressing any
  astonishment at the question, "it would be an antidote to almost any poison.
  It is the rarest cordial that can be prepared, and the secret of its
  composition is only known to myself. When I said your ladyship would incur
  great risk in taking it, I meant that the reaction from so powerful a
  stimulant would be highly dangerous. But you declared you did not heed the
  consequences."</p>

  <p>"Nor do I," she rejoined. "Yet I would see it tasted."</p>

  <p>"Your mind shall be made easy on that score in a moment, my lady," said
  Luke Hatton.</p>

  <p>And taking a small wine-glass that stood by, he rinsed it with water and
  carefully wiped it; after which he poured a few drops of the liquid into it
  and swallowed them.</p>

  <p>During this proceeding Lady Lake's gaze never quitted him for a second.
  Apparently satisfied with the test, she bade him return the phial to her.</p>

  <p>"You had better let me pour it out for you, my lady," he replied,
  cleansing the glass as before. "The quantity must be exactly observed. Twenty
  drops, and no more."</p>

  <p>"My hand is as steady as your own, and I can count the drops as
  accurately," she rejoined, taking the phial from him. "Twenty, you say?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty, my lady," rejoined Hatton, evidently displeased; "but perhaps you
  had better confine yourself to fifteen, or even ten. 'T will be safer."</p>

  <p>"You think the larger dose might give me too much strength&mdash;ha! What
  say you to fifty, or a hundred?"</p>

  <p>"It must not be, my lady&mdash;it must not be. You will destroy yourself.
  It is my duty to prevent you. I must insist upon your giving me back the
  phial, unless you will consent to obey my orders."</p>

  <p>"But I tell you, man, I will have a hundred drops of the cordial," she
  cried pertinaciously.</p>

  <p>"And I say you shall not, my lady," he rejoined, unable in his anger to
  maintain the semblance of respect he had hitherto preserved, and endeavouring
  to obtain forcible possession of the phial.</p>

  <p>But she was too quick for him. And as he stretched out his hand for the
  purpose, the dagger gleamed before his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Back, miscreant!" she cried; "your over-eagerness has betrayed you. I now
  fully believe what I have hitherto doubted, that this is a counter-poison,
  and that I may safely use it. It is time to unmask you, and to let you know
  that your villanies are discovered. I am aware of the malignant practices you
  have resorted to, and that my daughter and myself would have been destroyed
  by your poisonous preparations. But I now feel some security in the antidote
  I have obtained; and if I do perish I have the satisfaction of knowing that I
  shall not die unavenged, but that certain punishment awaits you and your
  employers."</p>

  <p>On this she poured out half the contents of the phial into the glass,
  saying as she drank it, "I reserve the other half for Lady Roos."</p>

  <p>Luke Hatton, who appeared thunder-stricken, made no further effort to
  prevent her, but turned to fly. Lady Lake, however, upon whom the restorative
  effect of the cordial was almost magical, ordered him to stay, telling him if
  he went forth he would be arrested, on hearing which he sullenly obeyed
  her.</p>

  <p>"You have not deceived me as to the efficacy of the potion," said the
  lady; "it has given me new life, and with returning vigour I can view all
  things as I viewed them heretofore. Now mark what I have to say, villain. You
  have placed me and my daughter in fearful jeopardy; but it is in your power
  to make reparation for the injury; and as I hold you to be a mere instrument
  in the matter, I am willing to spare the life you have forfeited, on
  condition of your making a full confession in writing of your attempt, to be
  'used by me against your employers. Are you willing to do this, or shall I
  strike upon the bell, and have you bound hand and foot, and conveyed to the
  Gatehouse?"</p>

  <p>"I will write that I was employed by the Countess of Exeter to poison you
  and my Lady Roos," replied Luke Hatton, stubbornly; "but I will do nothing
  more."</p>

  <p>"That will suffice," replied Lady Lake, after a moment's reflection.</p>

  <p>"And when I have done it, I shall be free to go?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You shall be free to go," she replied.</p>

  <p>There were writing materials on an adjoining table, and, without another
  word, Luke Hatton sat down, and with great expedition drew up a statement
  which he signed, and handed to Lady Lake; asking if that was what she
  required?</p>

  <p>A smile lighted up her ghastly features as she perused it.</p>

  <p>"It will do," she said. "And now answer me one question, and you are free.
  Will this cordial have the same effect on my daughter as on me?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely the same. It will cure her. But you must proceed more
  cautiously. Were she to take the quantity you have taken, it would kill her.
  Am I now at liberty to depart?"</p>

  <p>"You are," replied Lady Lake.</p>

  <p>So saying, she struck the bell, and immediately afterwards the door was
  opened; not, however, by the attendants, but by Sir Thomas Lake.</p>

  <p>As the Secretary of State perceived that the apothecary avoided him, and
  would have passed forth quickly, he sternly and authoritatively commanded him
  to stay, exclaiming, "You stir not hence, till you have accounted to me for
  my daughter, who, I understand, is dying from your pernicious treatment. What
  ho, there! Keep strict watch without; and suffer not this man to pass
  forth!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-3"
     name="ch2-3">CHAPTER III.<br>
  Showing that "our pleasant vices<br>
  are made the whips to scourge us."</a></h2>

  <p class="first">We must now request the reader to visit the noble mansion in
  the Strand, erected by Thomas Cecil, then Earl of Exeter, and bearing-his
  name; in a chamber of which Lord Roos and the Countess of Exeter will be
  found alone together&mdash;alone for the last time.</p>

  <p>Very different was the deportment of the guilty pair towards each other
  from what it used to be. The glances they exchanged were no longer those of
  passionate love, but of undissembled hatred. Bitter reproaches had been
  uttered on one side, angry menaces on the other. Ever since the fatal order
  had been wrested from the Countess, her peace of mind had been entirely
  destroyed, and she had become a prey to all the horrors of remorse.
  Perceiving the change in her sentiments towards him, Lord Roos strove, by the
  arts which had hitherto proved so successful, to win back the place he had
  lost in her affections; but failing in doing so, and irritated by her
  reproaches, and still more by her coldness, he gave vent to his displeasure
  in terms that speedily produced a decided quarrel between them; and though
  reconciled in appearance, they never again were to each other what they had
  been.</p>

  <p>As this was to be their final meeting, they had agreed not to embitter it
  with unavailing reproaches and recriminations. Lord Roos acquainted the
  Countess that he had decided upon travelling into Italy and Spain, and
  remaining abroad for a lengthened period; and the announcement of his
  intention was received by her without an objection. Perhaps he hoped that
  when put to this trial she might relent. If so, he was disappointed. She even
  urged him not to delay his departure, and concluded her speech with these
  words&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Something tells me we shall meet no more in this world. But we are
  certain to meet hereafter at the Judgment Seat. How shall we regard each
  other then?"</p>

  <p>"Trouble me not with the question," rejoined Lord Roos gloomily; "I have
  not come here to listen to sermons, and will brook no more reproaches."</p>

  <p>"I do not mean to reproach you, William," she returned meekly; "but the
  thought of our dire offence rises perpetually before me. Would we could undo
  what we have done!"</p>

  <p>"I tell you it is too late," rejoined Lord Roos harshly.</p>

  <p>At this moment Diego suddenly presented himself, and apologizing for the
  abruptness of his entrance, accounted for it by saying that Sarah Swarton
  besought a word with his Lordship. She brought a message, he added, from Lady
  Roos, who was much worse, and not finding his Lordship at his own residence
  had ventured to follow him to Exeter House to deliver it.</p>

  <p>"I will come to her anon," said Lord Roos carelessly.</p>

  <p>"No, no; admit her at once, Diego," cried the Countess; "I would hear what
  she has to say." And the next moment Sarah Swarton being ushered into the
  room, she rushed up to her and eagerly demanded, "How fares it with your
  lady? Is there any hope for her?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," replied Sarah, shaking her head sadly. "She is past all
  chance of recovery."</p>

  <p>"Then Heaven pardon me!" ejaculated the Countess, clasping her hands
  together, and falling upon her knees.</p>

  <p>Sarah Swarton gazed at her in astonishment; while Lord Roos, rushing
  towards her, commanded her to rise.</p>

  <p>"Take heed what you say and do, Countess," he whispered. "You will excite
  this woman's suspicions."</p>

  <p>"Why should your ladyship implore Heaven's pardon because my poor dear
  lady is near her end?" inquired Sarah.</p>

  <p>"I sue for it because I have caused her much affliction," replied the
  Countess.</p>

  <p>"Your message, Sarah&mdash;your message?" interposed Lord Roos. "What have
  you to say to me?"</p>

  <p>"My lady desires to see you once more before she expires, my lord,"
  replied Sarah. "She would take leave of you; and&mdash;and&mdash;she has
  something to impart to you. You will not refuse her last request?"</p>

  <p>"He will not&mdash;he will not, I am sure," cried the Countess, seeing him
  look irresolute.</p>

  <p>"I did not expect to be seconded by you, my lady," observed Sarah, in
  increasing surprise.</p>

  <p>"Would that I, too, might see her and obtain her forgiveness!" exclaimed
  the Countess, without heeding the remark.</p>

  <p>"An idle wish, and not to be indulged," said Lord Roos.</p>

  <p>A sudden idea appeared to strike Sarah, and she cried, "Your ladyship's
  desire may possibly be gratified. My poor lady desires to part in peace with
  all the world, even with those who have injured her. I will communicate your
  wishes to her, and it may be she will consent to see you."</p>

  <p>"You shall have a reward well worthy of the service if you accomplish it,"
  said the Countess. "Hasten to her with all speed, my Lord, and I will follow
  in my litter, ready to attend Sarah's summons."</p>

  <p>"I like not the plan," rejoined Lord Roos. "You are wrong to go. Why need
  you see her?"</p>

  <p>"Why?" she answered, regarding him fixedly. "Because it may be some little
  consolation to me afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Then go alone," said Lord Roos savagely. "I will not accompany you."</p>

  <p>"I do not ask you to accompany me, but to precede me," she replied. "Now,
  mark me, my Lord," she added in a low, firm tone, "and be assured I do not
  advance more than I will perform. If you refuse your wife's dying request, I
  will go back with Sarah and confess all to her."</p>

  <p>Lord Roos looked as if he could have annihilated her, and muttered a
  terrible imprecation on her head.</p>

  <p>"Threaten me&mdash;ay, and execute your threats hereafter if you will,"
  continued the Countess in the same low decided tone, "but go you
  <i>shall</i>now."</p>

  <p>Her manner was so irresistible that Lord Roos was compelled to obey, and
  he quitted the room without a word more, followed by Diego and Sarah Swarton,
  the latter of whom signed to the Countess that she might depend upon the
  fulfilment of her wishes.</p>

  <p>They had not been gone many minutes before Lady Exeter entered her litter,
  and wholly unattended by page or serving-man, except those in charge of the
  conveyance, caused herself to be conveyed to Sir Thomas Lake's lodgings in
  Whitehall.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-4"
     name="ch2-4">CHAPTER IV.<br>
  How the forged Confession was produced.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Summoning up all his firmness for the interview with his
  lady, Lord Roos entered her chamber, attended by Sarah Swarton, and beheld
  her propped up by pillows, bearing evident marks in her countenance of the
  severe sufferings she had endured. She was emaciated in frame, and almost
  livid in complexion; hollow-cheeked and hollow-eyed; but still with a look of
  unaltered affection for him.</p>

  <p>Having fulfilled her mission, Sarah left them alone together.</p>

  <p>He took the thin fingers extended towards him, and pressed them to his
  lips, but scarcely dared to raise his eyes towards his wife, so much was he
  shocked by her appearance. It was with difficulty she gave utterance to the
  words she addressed to him.</p>

  <p>"I thank you for coming to me, my Lord," she said; "but you will not
  regret your kindness. We are quite alone, are we not? My eyes are so dim that
  I cannot distinguish any object at the other end of the room&mdash;but I can
  see you plainly enough, my dear Lord."</p>

  <p>"We are alone, Elizabeth," replied Lord Roos, in a voice of some emotion,
  after glancing around.</p>

  <p>"Then I may speak freely," she continued. "What I predicted has occurred.
  You did not do well, my dear Lord, to take that phial from me and place it in
  other hands. Nay, start not! I know I am poisoned: I have known it from the
  first. But I have made no effort to save myself, for I was aware it was your
  will I should die."</p>

  <p>"O, Elizabeth!" murmured her husband.</p>

  <p>"I was aware of it," she repeated; "and as I have never voluntarily
  disobeyed you, I would not now thwart your purpose, even though I myself must
  be the sacrifice. It was to tell you this that I have sent for you. It was to
  forgive&mdash;to bless you."</p>

  <p>And as she spoke she threw her arms round his neck, and he felt his cheek
  wet with her tears.</p>

  <p>"This is more than I can bear," cried Lord Roos, in a voice suffocated by
  emotion. "I thought I had firmness for anything; but it deserts me entirely
  now. You are an angel of goodness, Elizabeth; as I am a demon of darkness. I
  do not deserve your forgiveness."</p>

  <p>"You will deserve it, if you will comply with the request I am about to
  make to you," she rejoined, looking at him beseechingly.</p>

  <p>"Whatever it be it shall be granted, if in my power," he rejoined
  earnestly. "I would redeem your life, if I could, at the price of my own. You
  have exorcised the evil spirit from me, Elizabeth."</p>

  <p>"Then I shall die happy," she replied, with a smile of ineffable
  delight.</p>

  <p>"But the request! What is it you would have me perform?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I would have you spare my mother," she replied. "I know she has been
  dealt with in the same way as myself; but I also know there is yet time to
  save her."</p>

  <p>"It shall be done," said Lord Roos, emphatically. "Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"In the adjoining chamber."</p>

  <p>"Is Luke Hatton in attendance upon her?"</p>

  <p>"In constant attendance," she rejoined. "That man has obeyed you well, my
  Lord. But take heed of him: he is a dangerous weapon, and may injure the hand
  that employs him. Strike gently upon that bell. He will attend the
  summons."</p>

  <p>Lord Roos complied; when, to his astonishment and dismay, the curtains
  shrouding the entrance to the adjoining room were drawn aside, and Lady Lake
  stalked from behind them. Never before had she surveyed her son-in-law with
  such a glance of triumph as she threw upon him now.</p>

  <p>"You were mistaken you see, Elizabeth," said Lord Roos to his lady. "Your
  mother needs no aid. She is perfectly well."</p>

  <p>"Ay, well enough to confound you and all your wicked purposes, my Lord,"
  cried Lady Lake. "You have not accomplished my destruction, as you perceive;
  nor shall you accomplish your wife's destruction, though you have well-nigh
  succeeded. Let it chafe you to madness to learn that I possess an antidote,
  which I have myself approved, and which will kill the poison circling in her
  veins, and give her new life."</p>

  <p>"An antidote!" exclaimed Lord Roos. "So far from galling me to madness,
  the intelligence fills me with delight beyond expression. Give it me, Madam,
  that I may administer it at once; and heaven grant its results may be such as
  you predict!"</p>

  <p>"Administered by you, my Lord, it would be poison," said Lady Lake,
  bitterly. "But you may stand by and witness its beneficial effects. They will
  be instantaneous."</p>

  <p>"As you will, Madam, so you do not delay the application," cried Lord
  Roos.</p>

  <p>"Drink of this, my child," said Lady Lake, after she had poured some drops
  of the cordial into a glass.</p>

  <p>"I will take it from no hand but my husband's," murmured Lady Roos.</p>

  <p>"How?" exclaimed her mother, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Give it me, I say, Madam," cried Lord Roos. "Is this a time for
  hesitation, when you see her life hangs upon a thread, which you yourself may
  sever?"</p>

  <p>And taking the glass from her, he held it to his wife's lips; tenderly
  supporting her while she swallowed its contents.</p>

  <p>It was not long before the effects of the cordial were manifest. The
  deathly hue of the skin changed to a more healthful colour, and the
  pulsations of the heart became stronger and more equal; and though the
  debility could not be so speedily repaired, it was apparent that the work of
  restoration had commenced, and might be completed if the same treatment were
  pursued.</p>

  <p>"Now I owe my life to you, my dear Lord," said Lady Roos, regarding her
  husband with grateful fondness.</p>

  <p>"To him!" exclaimed her mother. "You owe him nothing but a heavy debt of
  vengeance, which we will endeavour to pay, and with interest. But keep calm,
  my child, and do not trouble yourself; whatever may occur. Your speedy
  restoration will depend much on that."</p>

  <p>"You do not adopt the means to make me calm, mother," replied Lady
  Roos.</p>

  <p>But Lady Lake was too much bent upon the immediate and full gratification
  of her long-deferred vengeance to heed her. Clapping her hands together, the
  signal was answered by Sir Thomas Lake, who came forth from the adjoining
  room with Luke Hatton. At the same time, and as if it had been so contrived
  that all the guilty parties should be confronted together, the outer door of
  the chamber was opened, and the Countess of Exeter was ushered in by Sarah
  Swarton.</p>

  <p>On seeing in whose presence she stood, the Countess would have
  precipitately retreated; but it was too late. The door was closed by
  Sarah.</p>

  <p>"Soh! my turn is come at last," cried Lady Lake, gazing from one to the
  other with a smile of gratified vengeance. "I hold you all in my toils. You,
  my Lord," addressing her son-in-law, "have treated a wife, who has ever shown
  you the most devoted affection, with neglect and cruelty, and, not content
  with such barbarous treatment, have conspired against her life, and against
  my life."</p>

  <p>"Take heed how you bring any charge against him, mother," cried Lady Roos,
  raising herself in her couch. "Take heed, I say. Let your vengeance fall upon
  her head," pointing to the Countess&mdash;"but not upon him."</p>

  <p>"I am willing to make atonement for the wrongs I have done you, Lady
  Roos," said the Countess, "and have come hither to say so, and to implore
  your forgiveness."</p>

  <p>"You fancied she was dying," rejoined Lady Lake&mdash;"dying from the
  effects of the poison administered to her and to me by Luke Hatton, according
  to your order; but you are mistaken, Countess. We have found an antidote, and
  shall yet live to requite you."</p>

  <p>"It is more satisfaction to me to be told this, Madam, than it would be to
  find that Luke Hatton had succeeded in his design, which I would have
  prevented if I could," said Lady Exeter.</p>

  <p>"You will gain little credit for that assertion, Countess," remarked Sir
  Thomas Lake, "since it is contradicted by an order which I hold in my hand,
  signed by yourself, and given to the miscreant in question."</p>

  <p>"O Heavens!" ejaculated the Countess.</p>

  <p>"Do you deny this signature?" asked Sir Thomas, showing her the paper.</p>

  <p>Lady Exeter made no answer.</p>

  <p>"Learn further to your confusion, Countess," pursued Lady Lake, "that the
  wretch, Luke Hatton, has made a full confession of his offence, wherein he
  declares that he was incited by you, and by you alone, on the offer of a
  large reward, to put my daughter and myself to death by slow poison."</p>

  <p>"By me alone!&mdash;incited by me!" cried Lady Exeter; "why, I opposed
  him. It is impossible he can have confessed thus. Hast thou done so,
  villain?"</p>

  <p>"I have," replied Luke Hatton, sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Then thou hast avouched a lie&mdash;a lie that will damn thee," said Lady
  Exeter. "Lord Roos knows it to be false, and can exculpate me. Speak, my
  Lord, I charge you, and say how it occurred."</p>

  <p>But the young nobleman remained silent.</p>

  <p>"Not a word&mdash;not a word in my favour," the Countess exclaimed, in a
  voice of anguish. "Nay, then I am indeed lost!"</p>

  <p>"You are lost past redemption," cried Lady Lake with an outburst of fierce
  exultation, and a look as if she would have trampled her beneath her feet.
  "You have forfeited honour, station, life. Guilty of disloyalty to your proud
  and noble husband, you have sought to remove by violent deaths those who
  stood between you and your lover. Happily your dreadful purpose has been
  defeated; but this avowal of your criminality with Lord Roos, signed by
  yourself and witnessed by his lordship and his Spanish servant,&mdash;this
  shall be laid within an hour before the Earl of Exeter."</p>

  <p>"My brain turns round. I am bewildered with all these frightful
  accusations," exclaimed the Countess distractedly. "I have made no
  confession,&mdash;have signed none."</p>

  <p>"Methought you said I had witnessed it, Madam?" cried Lord Roos, almost as
  much bewildered as Lady Exeter.</p>

  <p>"Will you deny your own handwriting, my Lord?" rejoined Lady Lake; "or
  will the Countess? Behold the confession, subscribed by the one, and
  witnessed by the other."</p>

  <p>"It is a forgery!" shrieked the Countess. "You have charged me with
  witchcraft; but you practise it yourself."</p>

  <p>"If I did not know it to be false, I could have sworn the hand was yours,
  Countess," cried Lord Roos; "and my own signature is equally skilfully
  simulated."</p>

  <p>"False or not," cried Lady Lake, "it shall be laid before Lord Exeter as I
  have said&mdash;with all the details&mdash;ay, and before the King."</p>

  <p>"Before the King!" repeated Lord Roos, as he drew near Lady Exeter, and
  whispered in her ear&mdash;"Countess, our sole safety is in immediate flight.
  Circumstances are so strong against us, that we shall never be able to
  disprove this forgery."</p>

  <p>"Then save yourself in the way you propose, my Lord," she rejoined, with
  scorn. "For me, I shall remain, and brave it out."</p>

  <p>The young nobleman made a movement towards the door.</p>

  <p>"You cannot go forth without my order, my Lord," cried Sir Thomas Lake.
  "It is guarded."</p>

  <p>"Perdition!" exclaimed Lord Roos.</p>

  <p>Again Lady Lake looked from one to the other with a smile of triumph. But
  it was presently checked by a look from her daughter, who made a sign to her
  to approach her.</p>

  <p>"What would you, my child?&mdash;more of the cordial?" demanded Lady
  Lake.</p>

  <p>"No, mother," she replied, in a tone so low as to be inaudible to the
  others. "Nor will I suffer another drop to pass my lips unless my husband be
  allowed to depart without molestation."</p>

  <p>"Would you interfere with my vengeance?" said Lady Lake.</p>

  <p>"Ay, mother, I will interfere with it effectually unless you comply,"
  rejoined Lady Roos, firmly. "I will acquaint the Countess with the true
  nature of that confession. As it is, she has awakened by her conduct some
  feelings of pity in my breast."</p>

  <p>"You will ruin all by your weakness," said Lady Lake.</p>

  <p>"Let Lord Roos go free, and let there be a truce between you and the
  Countess for three days, and I am content."</p>

  <p>"I do not like to give such a promise," said Lady Lake. "It will be hard
  to keep it."</p>

  <p>"It may be harder to lose all your vengeance," rejoined Lady Roos, in a
  tone that showed she would not be opposed.</p>

  <p>Compelled to succumb, Lady Lake moved towards Sir Thomas, and a few words
  having passed between them in private, the Secretary of State thus addressed
  his noble son-in-law&mdash;</p>

  <p>"My Lord," he said in a grave tone, "at the instance of my daughter,
  though much against my own inclination, and that of my wife, I will no longer
  oppose your departure. I understand you are about to travel, and I therefore
  recommend you to set forth without delay, for if you be found in London, or
  in England, after three days, during which time, at the desire also of our
  daughter&mdash;and equally against our own wishes&mdash;we consent to keep
  truce with my lady of Exeter; if, I say, you are found after that time, I
  will not answer for the consequences to yourself. Thus warned, my Lord, you
  are at liberty to depart."</p>

  <p>"I will take advantage of your offer, Sir Thomas, and attend to your
  hint," replied Lord Roos. And turning upon his heel, he marched towards the
  door, whither he was accompanied by Sir Thomas Lake, who called to the
  attendants outside to let him go free.</p>

  <p>"Not one word of farewell to me! not one look!" exclaimed his wife,
  sinking back upon the pillow.</p>

  <p>"Nor for me&mdash;and I shall see him no more," murmured the Countess,
  compressing her beautiful lips. "But it is better thus."</p>

  <p>While this was passing, Luke Hatton had contrived to approach the
  Countess, and now said in a low tone&mdash;"If your ladyship will trust to
  me, and make it worth my while, I will deliver you from the peril in which
  you are placed by this confession. Shall I come to Exeter House
  to-night?"</p>

  <p>She consented.</p>

  <p>"At what hour?"</p>

  <p>"At midnight," she returned. "I loathe thee, yet have no alternative but
  to trust thee. Am I free to depart likewise?" she added aloud to Sir
  Thomas.</p>

  <p>"The door is open for you, Countess," rejoined the Secretary of State,
  with mock ceremoniousness. "After three days, you understand, war is renewed
  between us."</p>

  <p>"War to the death," subjoined Lady Lake.</p>

  <p>"Be it so," replied the Countess. "I shall not desert my post."</p>

  <p>And assuming the dignified deportment for which she was remarkable, she
  went forth with a slow and majestic step.</p>

  <p>Luke Hatton would have followed her, but Sir Thomas detained him.</p>

  <p>"Am I a prisoner?" he said, uneasily, and glancing at Lady Lake. "Her
  ladyship promised me instant liberation."</p>

  <p>"And the promise shall be fulfilled as soon as I am satisfied my daughter
  is out of danger," returned Sir Thomas.</p>

  <p>"I am easy, then," said the apothecary. "I will answer for her speedy
  recovery."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-5"
     name="ch2-5">CHAPTER V.<br>
  A Visit to Sir Giles Mompesson's Habitation Near the Fleet.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Allowing an interval of three or four months to elapse
  between the events last recorded, and those about to be narrated, we shall
  now conduct the reader to a large, gloomy habitation near Fleet Bridge. At
  first view, this structure, with its stone walls, corner turrets, ponderous
  door, and barred windows, might be taken as part and parcel of the ancient
  prison existing in this locality. Such, however, was not the fact. The little
  river Fleet, whose muddy current was at that time open to view, flowed
  between the two buildings; and the grim and frowning mansion we propose to
  describe stood on the western bank, exactly opposite the gateway of the
  prison.</p>

  <p>Now, as no one had a stronger interest in the Fleet Prison than the owner
  of that gloomy house, inasmuch as he had lodged more persons within it than
  any one ever did before him, it would almost seem that he had selected his
  abode for the purpose of watching over the safe custody of the numerous
  victims of his rapacity and tyranny. This was the general surmise; and, it
  must be owned, there was ample warranty for it in his conduct.</p>

  <p>A loop-hole in the turret at the north-east angle of the house commanded
  the courts of the prison, and here Sir Giles Mompesson would frequently
  station himself to note what was going forward within the jail, and examine
  the looks and deportment of those kept by him in durance. Many a glance of
  hatred and defiance was thrown from these sombre courts at the narrow
  aperture at which he was known to place himself; but such regards only
  excited Sir Giles's derision: many an imploring gesture was made to him; but
  these entreaties for compassion were equally disregarded. Being a particular
  friend of the Warden of the Fleet, and the jailers obeying him as they would
  have done their principal, he entered the prison when he pleased, and visited
  any ward he chose, at any hour of day or night; and though the unfortunate
  prisoners complained of the annoyance,&mdash;and especially those to whom his
  presence was obnoxious,&mdash;no redress could be obtained. He always
  appeared when least expected, and seemed to take a malicious pleasure in
  troubling those most anxious to avoid him.</p>

  <p>Nor was Sir Giles the only visitant to the prison. Clement Lanyere was as
  frequently to be seen within its courts and wards as his master, and a
  similar understanding appeared to exist between him and the jailers. Hence,
  he was nearly as much an object of dread and dislike as Sir Giles himself,
  and few saw the masked and shrouded figure of the spy approach them without
  misgiving.</p>

  <p>From the strange and unwarrantable influence exercised by Sir Giles and
  the promoter in the prison, they came at length to be considered as part of
  it; and matters were as frequently referred to them by the subordinate
  officers as to the warden. It was even supposed by some of the prisoners that
  a secret means of communication must exist between Sir Giles's habitation and
  the jail; but as both he and Lanyere possessed keys of the wicket, such a
  contrivance was obviously unnecessary, and would have been dangerous, as it
  must have been found out at some time by those interested in the
  discovery.</p>

  <p>It has been shown, however, that, in one way or other, Sir Giles had
  nearly as much to do with the management of the Fleet Prison as those to whom
  its governance was ostensibly committed, and that he could, if he thought
  proper, aggravate the sufferings of its unfortunate occupants without
  incurring any responsibility for his treatment of them. He looked upon the
  Star-Chamber and the Fleet as the means by which he could plunder society and
  stifle the cry of the oppressed; and it was his business to see that both
  machines were kept in good order, and worked well.</p>

  <p>But to return to his habitation. Its internal appearance corresponded with
  its forbidding exterior. The apartments were large, but cold and comfortless,
  and, with two or three exceptions, scantily furnished. Sumptuously decorated,
  these exceptional rooms presented a striking contrast to the rest of the
  house; but they were never opened, except on the occasion of some grand
  entertainment&mdash;a circumstance of rare occurrence. There was a large hall
  of entrance, where Sir Giles's myrmidons were wont to assemble, with a great
  table in the midst of it, on which no victuals were ever placed&mdash;at
  least at the extortioner's expense&mdash;and a great fire-place, where no
  fire ever burnt. From this a broad stone staircase mounted to the upper part
  of the house, and communicated by means of dusky corridors and narrow
  passages with the various apartments. A turnpike staircase connected the
  turret to which Sir Giles used to resort to reconnoitre the Fleet Prison,
  with the lower part of the habitation, and similar corkscrew stairs existed
  in the other angles of the structure. When stationed at the loophole, little
  recked Sir Giles of the mighty cathedral that frowned upon him like the
  offended eye of heaven. His gaze was seldom raised towards Saint Paul's, or
  if it were, he had no perception of the beauty or majesty of the ancient
  cathedral. The object of interest was immediately below him. The sternest
  realities of life were what he dealt with. He had no taste for the sublime or
  the beautiful.</p>

  <p>Sir Giles had just paid an inquisitorial visit, such as we have described,
  to the prison, and was returning homewards over Fleet Bridge, when he
  encountered Sir Francis Mitchell, who was coming in quest of him, and they
  proceeded to his habitation together. Nothing beyond a slight greeting passed
  between them in the street, for Sir Giles was ever jealous of his slightest
  word being overheard; but he could see from his partner's manner that
  something had occurred to annoy and irritate him greatly. Sir Giles was in no
  respect changed since the reader last beheld him. Habited in the same suit of
  sables, he still wore the same mantle, and the same plumed hat, and had the
  same long rapier by his side. His deportment, too, was as commanding as
  before, and his aspect as stern and menacing.</p>

  <p>Sir Francis, however, had not escaped the consequences naturally to be
  expected from the punishment inflicted upon him by the apprentices, being so
  rheumatic that he could scarcely walk, while a violent cough, with which he
  was occasionally seized, and which took its date from the disastrous day
  referred to, and had never left him since, threatened to shake his feeble
  frame in pieces; this, added to the exasperation under which he was evidently
  labouring, was almost too much for him. Three months seemed to have placed as
  many years upon his head; or, at all events, to have taken a vast deal out of
  his constitution. But, notwithstanding his increased infirmities, and utter
  unfitness for the part he attempted to play, he still affected a youthful
  air, and still aped all the extravagances and absurdities in dress and manner
  of the gayest and youngest court coxcomb. He was still attired in silks and
  satins of the gaudiest hues, still carefully trimmed as to hair and beard,
  still redolent of perfumes.</p>

  <p>Not without exhibiting considerable impatience, Sir Giles was obliged to
  regulate his pace by the slow and tottering steps of his companion, and was
  more than once brought to a halt as the lungs of the latter were convulsively
  torn by his cough, but at last they reached the house, and entered the great
  hall, where the myrmidons were assembled&mdash;all of whom rose on their
  appearance, and saluted them. There was Captain Bludder, with his braggart
  air, attended by some half-dozen Alsatian bullies; Lupo Vulp, with his crafty
  looks; and the tipstaves&mdash;all, in short, were present, excepting Clement
  Lanyere, and Sir Giles knew how to account for his absence. To the inquiries
  of Captain Bludder and his associates, whether they were likely to be
  required on any business that day, Sir Giles gave a doubtful answer, and
  placing some pieces of money in the Alsatian's hand, bade him repair, with
  his followers, to the "Rose Tavern," in Hanging Sword Court, and crush a
  flask or two of wine, and then return for orders&mdash;an injunction with
  which the captain willingly complied. To the tipstaves Sir Giles made no
  observation, and bidding Lupo Vulp hold himself in readiness for a summons,
  he passed on with his partner to an inner apartment. On Sir Francis gaining
  it, he sank into a chair, and was again seized with a fit of coughing that
  threatened him with annihilation. When it ceased, he made an effort to
  commence the conversation, and Sir Giles, who had been pacing to and fro
  impatiently within the chamber, stopped to listen to him.</p>

  <p>"You will wonder what business has brought me hither to-day, Sir Giles,"
  he said; "and I will keep you no longer in suspense. I have been insulted,
  Sir Giles&mdash;grievously insulted."</p>

  <p>"By whom?" demanded the extortioner.</p>

  <p>"By Sir Jocelyn Mounchensey," replied Sir Francis, shaking with passion.
  "I have received a degrading insult from him to-day, which ought to be washed
  out with his blood."</p>

  <p>"What hath he done to you?" inquired the other.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you, Sir Giles. I chanced to see him in the court-yard of the
  palace of Whitehall, and there being several gallants nigh at hand, who I
  thought would take my part&mdash;ough! ough! what a plaguey cough I have
  gotten, to be sure; but 't is all owing to those cursed 'prentices&mdash;a
  murrain seize 'em! Your patience, sweet Sir Giles, I am coming to the
  point&mdash;ough! ough! there it takes me again. Well, as I was saying,
  thinking the gallants with whom I was conversing would back me, and
  perceiving Mounchensey approach us, I thought I might venture"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Venture!" repeated Sir Giles, scornfully. "Let not such a disgraceful
  word pass your lips."</p>

  <p>"I mean, I thought I might take occasion to affront him. Whereupon I
  cocked my hat fiercely, as I have seen you and Captain Bludder do, Sir
  Giles."</p>

  <p>"Couple me not with the Alsatian, I pray of you, Sir Francis," observed
  the extortioner, sharply.</p>

  <p>"Your pardon, Sir Giles&mdash;your pardon! But as I was saying, I regarded
  him with a scowl, and tapped the hilt of my sword. And what think you the
  ruffianly fellow did? I almost blush at the bare relation of it. Firstly, he
  plucked off my hat, telling me I ought to stand bareheaded in the presence of
  gentlemen. Next, he tweaked my nose, and as I turned round to avoid him, he
  applied his foot&mdash;yes, his foot&mdash;to the back of my trunk-hose; and
  well was it that the hose were stoutly wadded and quilted. Fire and fury! Sir
  Giles, I cannot brook the indignity. And what was worse, the shameless
  gallants, who ought to have lent me aid, were ready to split their sides with
  laughter, and declared I had only gotten my due. When I could find utterance
  for very choler, I told the villain you would requite him, and he answered he
  would serve you in the same fashion, whenever you crossed his path."</p>

  <p>"Ha! said he so?" cried Sir Giles, half drawing his sword, while his eyes
  flashed fire. "We shall see whether he will make good his words. Yet no!
  Revenge must not be accomplished in that way. I have already told you I am
  willing to let him pursue his present career undisturbed for a time, in order
  to make his fall the greater. I hold him in my hand, and can crush him when I
  please."</p>

  <p>"Then do not defer your purpose, Sir Giles," said Sir Francis; "or I must
  take my own means of setting myself right with him. I cannot consent to sit
  down calmly under the provocation I have endured."</p>

  <p>"And what will be the momentary gratification afforded by his
  death&mdash;if such you meditate," returned Sir Giles, "in comparison with
  hurling him down from the point he has gained, stripping him of all his
  honours, and of such wealth as he may have acquired, and plunging him into
  the Fleet Prison, where he will die by inches, and where you yourself may
  feast your eyes on his slow agonies? That is true revenge; and you are but a
  novice in the art of vengeance if you think your plan equal to mine. It is
  for this&mdash;and this only&mdash;that I have spared him so long. I have
  suffered him to puff himself up with pride and insolence, till he is ready to
  burst. But his day of reckoning is at hand, and then he shall pay off the
  long arrears he owes us."</p>

  <p>"Well, Sir Giles, I am willing to leave the matter with you," said Sir
  Francis; "but it is hard to be publicly insulted, and have injurious epithets
  applied to you, and not obtain immediate redress."</p>

  <p>"I grant you it is so," rejoined Sir Giles; "but you well know you are no
  match for him at the sword."</p>

  <p>"If I am not, others are&mdash;Clement Lanyere, for instance," cried Sir
  Francis. "He has more than once arranged a quarrel for me."</p>

  <p>"And were it an ordinary case, I would advise that the arrangement of this
  quarrel should be left to Lanyere," said Sir Giles; "or I myself would
  undertake it for you. But that were only half revenge. No; the work must be
  done completely; and the triumph you will gain in the end will amply
  compensate you for the delay."</p>

  <p>"Be it so, then," replied Sir Francis. "But before I quit the subject, I
  may remark, that one thing perplexes me in the sudden rise of this upstart,
  and that is that he encounters no opposition from Buckingham. Even the King,
  I am told, has expressed his surprise that the jealous Marquis should view
  one who may turn out a rival with so much apparent complacency."</p>

  <p>"It is because Buckingham has no fear of him," replied Sir Giles. "He
  knows he has but to say the word, and the puppet brought forward by De
  Gondomar&mdash;for it is by him that Mounchensey is supported&mdash;will be
  instantly removed; but as he also knows, that another would be set up, he is
  content to let him occupy the place for a time."</p>

  <p>"Certes, if Mounchensey had more knowledge of the world he would distrust
  him," said Sir Francis, "because in my opinion Buckingham overacts his part,
  and shows him too much attention. He invites him, as I am given to
  understand, to all his masques, banquets, and revels at York House, and even
  condescends to flatter him. Such conduct would awaken suspicion in any one
  save the object of it."</p>

  <p>"I have told you Buckingham's motive, and therefore his conduct will no
  longer surprise you. Have you heard of the wager between De Gondomar and the
  Marquis, in consequence of which a trial of skill is to be made in the
  Tilt-yard to-morrow? Mounchensey is to run against Buckingham, and I leave
  you to guess what the result will be. I myself am to be among the
  jousters."</p>

  <p>"You!" exclaimed Sir Francis.</p>

  <p>"Even I," replied Sir Giles, with a smile of gratified vanity. "Now, mark
  me, Sir Francis. I have a surprise for you. It is not enough for me to hurl
  this aspiring youth from his proud position, and cover him with
  disgrace&mdash;it is not enough to immure him in the Fleet; but I will
  deprive him of his choicest treasure&mdash;of the object of his devoted
  affections."</p>

  <p>"Ay, indeed!" exclaimed Sir Francis.</p>

  <p>"By my directions Clement Lanyere has kept constant watch over him, and
  has discovered that the young man's heart is fixed upon a maiden of great
  beauty, named Aveline Calveley, daughter of the crazy Puritan who threatened
  the King's life some three or four months ago at Theobalds."</p>

  <p>"I mind me of the circumstance," observed Sir Francis.</p>

  <p>"This maiden lives in great seclusion with an elderly dame, but I have
  found out her retreat. I have said that Sir Jocelyn is enamoured of her, and
  she is by no means insensible to his passion. But a bar exists to their
  happiness. Almost with his last breath, a promise was extorted from his
  daughter by Hugh Calveley, that if her hand should be claimed within a year
  by one to whom he had engaged her, but with whose name even she was wholly
  unacquainted, she would unhesitatingly give it to him."</p>

  <p>"And will the claim be made?"</p>

  <p>"It will."</p>

  <p>"And think you she will fulfil her promise?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it. A dying father's commands are sacred with one like
  her."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen her, Sir Giles? Is she so very beautiful as
  represented?"</p>

  <p>"I have not yet seen her; but she will be here anon. And you can then
  judge for yourself."</p>

  <p>"She here!" exclaimed Sir Francis. "By what magic will you bring her
  hither?"</p>

  <p>"By a spell that cannot fail in effect," replied Sir Giles, with a grim
  smile. "I have summoned her in her father's name. I have sent for her to tell
  her that her hand will be claimed."</p>

  <p>"By whom?" inquired Sir Francis.</p>

  <p>"That is my secret," replied Sir Giles.</p>

  <p>At this juncture there was a tap at the door, and Sir Giles, telling the
  person without to enter, it was opened by Clement Lanyere, wrapped in his
  long mantle, and with his countenance hidden by his mask.</p>

  <p>"They are here," he said.</p>

  <p>"The damsel and the elderly female?" cried Sir Giles.</p>

  <p>And receiving a response in the affirmative from the promoter, he bade him
  usher them in at once.</p>

  <p>The next moment Aveline, attended by a decent-looking woman, somewhat
  stricken in years, entered the room. They were followed by Clement Lanyere.
  The maiden was attired in deep mourning, and though looking very pale, her
  surpassing beauty produced a strong impression upon Sir Francis Mitchell, who
  instantly arose on seeing her, and made her a profound, and, as he
  considered, courtly salutation.</p>

  <p>Without bestowing any attention on him, Aveline addressed herself to Sir
  Giles, whose look filled her with terror.</p>

  <p>"Why have you sent for me, Sir?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I have sent for you, Aveline Calveley, to remind you of the promise made
  by you to your dying father," he rejoined.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she exclaimed; "then my forebodings of ill are realized."</p>

  <p>"I know you consider that promise binding," pursued Sir Giles; "and it is
  only necessary for me to announce to you that, in a week from this time, your
  hand will be claimed in marriage."</p>

  <p>"Alas! alas!" she cried, in accents of despair. "But who will claim
  it?&mdash;and how can the claim be substantiated?" she added, recovering
  herself in some degree.</p>

  <p>"You will learn at the time I have appointed," replied Sir Giles. "And
  now, having given you notice to prepare for the fulfilment of an engagement
  solemnly contracted by your father, and as solemnly agreed to by yourself, I
  will no longer detain you."</p>

  <p>Aveline gazed at him with wonder and terror, and would have sought for
  some further explanation; but perceiving from the inflexible expression of
  his countenance that any appeal would be useless, she quitted the room with
  her companion.</p>

  <p>"I would give half I possess to make that maiden mine," cried Sir Francis,
  intoxicated with admiration of her beauty.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" exclaimed Sir Giles. "More difficult matters have been
  accomplished. Half your possessions, say you? She is not worth so much.
  Assign to me your share of the Mounchensey estates and she shall be
  yours."</p>

  <p>"I will do it, Sir Giles&mdash;I will do it," cried the old usurer,
  eagerly; "but you must prove to me first that you can make good your
  words."</p>

  <p>"Pshaw! Have I ever deceived you, man? But rest easy. You shall be fully
  satisfied."</p>

  <p>"Then call in Lupo Vulp, and let him prepare the assignment at once,"
  cried Sir Francis. "I shall have a rare prize; and shall effectually revenge
  myself on this detested Mounchensey."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-6"
     name="ch2-6">CHAPTER VI.<br>
  Of the Wager between the Conde de Gondomar<br>
  and the Marquis of Buckingham.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At a banquet given at Whitehall, attended by all the
  principal lords and ladies of the court, a wager was laid between the Conde
  de Gondomar and the Marquis of Buckingham, the decision of which was referred
  to the King.</p>

  <p>The circumstance occurred in this way. The discourse happened to turn upon
  jousting, and the magnificent favourite, who was held unrivalled in all
  martial exercises and chivalrous sports, and who, confident in his own skill,
  vauntingly declared that he had never met his match in the tilt-yard;
  whereupon the Spanish Ambassador, willing to lower his pride, immediately
  rejoined, that he could, upon the instant, produce a better man-at-arms than
  he; and so certain was he of being able to make good his words, that he was
  willing to stake a thousand doubloons to a hundred on the issue of a
  trial.</p>

  <p>To this Buckingham haughtily replied, that he at once accepted the
  Ambassador's challenge; but in regard to the terms of the wager, they must be
  somewhat modified, as he could not accept them as proposed; but he was
  willing to hazard on the result of the encounter all the gems, with which at
  the moment his habiliments were covered, against the single diamond clasp
  worn by De Gondomar; and if the offer suited his Excellency, he had nothing
  to do but appoint the day, and bring forward the man.</p>

  <p>De Gondomar replied, that nothing could please him better than the
  Marquis's modification of the wager, and the proposal was quite consistent
  with the acknowledged magnificence of his Lordship's notions; yet he begged
  to make one further alteration, which was, that in the event of the knight he
  should nominate being adjudged by his Majesty to be the best jouster, the
  rich prize might be delivered to him.</p>

  <p>Buckingham assented, and the terms of the wager being now fully settled,
  it only remained to fix the day for the trial, and this was referred to the
  King, who appointed the following Thursday&mdash;thus allowing, as the
  banquet took place on a Friday, nearly a week for preparation.</p>

  <p>James, also, good-naturedly complied with the Ambassador's request, and
  agreed to act as judge on the occasion; and he laughingly remarked to
  Buckingham&mdash;"Ye are demented, Steenie, to risk a' those precious stanes
  with which ye are bedecked on the skill with which ye can yield a frail
  lance. We may say unto you now in the words of the poet&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Pendebant ter ti gemmata monilia collo;'</p>

  <p>but wha shall say frae whose round throat those gemmed collars and
  glittering ouches will hang a week hence, if ye be worsted? Think of that, my
  dear dog."</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty need be under no apprehension," replied Buckingham. "I shall
  win and wear his Excellency's diamond clasp. And now, perhaps, the Count will
  make us acquainted with the name and title of my puissant adversary, on whose
  address he so much relies. Our relative chances of success will then be more
  apparent. If, however, any motives for secrecy exist, I will not press the
  inquiry, but leave the disclosure to a more convenient season."</p>

  <p>"<i>Nunc est narrandi tempus</i>," rejoined the King. "No time like the
  present. We are anxious to ken wha the hero may be."</p>

  <p>"I will not keep your Majesty a moment in suspense," said De Gondomar.
  "The young knight whom I design to select as the Marquis's opponent, and whom
  I am sure will feel grateful for having such means of honourable distinction
  afforded him, is present at the banquet."</p>

  <p>"Here!" exclaimed James, looking round. "To whom do you refer, Count? It
  cannot be Sir Gilbert Gerrard, or Sir Henry Rich; for&mdash;without saying
  aught in disparagement of their prowess&mdash;neither of them is a match for
  Buckingham! Ah! save us! We hae it. Ye mean Sir Jocelyn Mounchensey."</p>

  <p>And as the Ambassador acknowledged that his Majesty was right, all eyes
  were turned towards the young knight, who, though as much surprised as any
  one else, could not help feeling greatly elated.</p>

  <p>"Aweel, Count," said James, evidently pleased, "ye might hae made a waur
  choice&mdash;that we are free to confess. We begin to tremble for your braw
  jewels, Steenie."</p>

  <p>"They are safer than I expected," replied Buckingham, disdainfully. But
  though he thus laughed it off, it was evident he was displeased, and he
  muttered to his confidential friend, Lord Mordaunt,&mdash;"I see through it
  all: this is a concerted scheme to bring this aspiring galliard forward; but
  he shall receive a lesson for his presumption he shall not easily forget,
  while, at the same time, those who make use of him for their own purposes
  shall be taught the risk they incur in daring to oppose me. The present
  opportunity shall not be neglected."</p>

  <p>Having formed this resolution, Buckingham, to all appearance, entirely
  recovered his gaiety, and pressed the King to give importance to the trial by
  allowing it to take place in the royal tilt-yard at Whitehall, and to extend
  the number of jousters to fourteen&mdash;seven on one side, and seven on the
  other. The request was readily granted by the monarch, who appeared to take a
  stronger interest in the match than Buckingham altogether liked, and
  confirmed him in his determination of ridding himself for ever of the
  obstacle in his path presented by Mounchensey. The number of jousters being
  agreed upon, it was next decided that the party with whom Buckingham was to
  range should be headed by the Duke of Lennox; while Mounchensey's party was
  to be under the command of Prince Charles; and though the disposition was too
  flattering to his adversary to be altogether agreeable to the haughty
  favourite, he could not raise any reasonable objection to it, and was
  therefore obliged to submit with the best grace he could.</p>

  <p>The two parties were then distributed in the following order by the
  King:&mdash;On the side of the Duke of Lennox, besides Buckingham himself,
  were the Earls of Arundel and Pembroke, and the Lords Clifford and Mordaunt;
  and while the King was hesitating as to the seventh, Sir Giles Mompesson was
  suggested by the Marquis, and James, willing to oblige his favourite, adopted
  the proposition. On the side of Prince Charles were ranked the Marquis of
  Hamilton, the Earls of Montgomery, Rutland, and Dorset, Lord Walden, and, of
  course, Sir Jocelyn Mounchensey. These preliminaries being fully adjusted,
  other topics were started, and the carouse, which had been in some degree
  interrupted, was renewed, and continued, with the entertainments that
  succeeded it, till past midnight.</p>

  <p>Not a little elated by the high compliment paid to his prowess by the
  Spanish Ambassador, and burning to break a lance with Buckingham, Sir Jocelyn
  resolved to distinguish himself at the trial. Good luck, of late, had
  invariably attended him. Within the last few weeks, he had been appointed one
  of the Gentlemen of his Majesty's Bed-chamber; and this was looked upon as
  the stepping-stone to some more exalted post. Supported by the influence of
  De Gondomar, and upheld by his own personal merits, which by this time, in
  spite of all hostility towards him, had begun to be appreciated; with the
  King himself most favourably inclined towards him, and Prince Charles
  amicably disposed; with many of the courtiers proffering him service, who
  were anxious to throw off their forced allegiance to the overweening
  favourite, and substitute another in his stead: with all these advantages, it
  is not to be wondered at, that in a short space of time he should have
  established a firm footing on that smooth and treacherous surface, the
  pavement of a palace, and have already become an object of envy and jealousy
  to many, and of admiration to a few.</p>

  <p>Possessing the faculty of adapting himself to circumstances, Sir Jocelyn
  conducted himself with rare discretion; and while avoiding giving offence,
  never suffered a liberty to be taken with himself; and having on the onset
  established a character for courage, he was little afterwards molested. It
  was creditable to him, that in a court where morality was at so low an ebb as
  that of James I., he should have remained uncorrupted; and that not all the
  allurements of the numerous beauties by whom he was surrounded, and who
  exerted their blandishments to ensnare him, could tempt him for a moment's
  disloyalty to the object of his affections. It was creditable, that at the
  frequent orgies he was compelled to attend, where sobriety was derided, and
  revelry pushed to its furthest limits, he was never on any occasion carried
  beyond the bounds of discretion. It was still more creditable to him, that in
  such venal and corrupt days he maintained his integrity perfectly unsullied.
  Thus severely tested, the true worth of his character was proved, and he came
  from the ordeal without a blemish.</p>

  <p>The many excellent qualities that distinguished the newly-made knight and
  gentleman of the bed-chamber, combined with his remarkable personal
  advantages and conciliatory manner, considerably improved by the polish he
  had recently acquired, drew, as we have intimated, the attention of the
  second personage in the kingdom towards him. Struck by his manner, and by the
  sentiments he expressed, Prince Charles took frequent opportunities of
  conversing with him, and might have conceived a regard for him but for the
  jealous interference of Buckingham, who, unable to brook a rival either with
  the King or Prince, secretly endeavoured to set both against him. Such,
  however, was Sir Jocelyn's consistency of character, such his solidity of
  judgment and firmness, and such the respect he inspired, that he seemed
  likely to triumph over all the insidious snares planned for him. Things were
  in this state when the trial of skill in jousting was proposed by De
  Gondomar. The wily Ambassador might have&mdash;and probably had&mdash;some
  secret motive in making the proposal; but whatever it was, it was unknown to
  his <i>protégé</i>.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-7"
     name="ch2-7">CHAPTER VII.<br>
  A Cloud in the Horizon.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">But it must not be imagined that Sir Jocelyn's whole time
  was passed in attendance on the court. Not a day flew by that he did not pay
  a visit to Aveline. She had taken a little cottage, where she dwelt in
  perfect seclusion, with one female attendant, old Dame Sherborne,&mdash;the
  same who had accompanied her on her compulsory visit to Sir Giles
  Mompesson,&mdash;and her father's faithful old servant, Anthony Rocke. To
  this retreat, situated in the then rural neighbourhood adjoining Holborn, Sir
  Jocelyn, as we have said, daily repaired, and the moments so spent were the
  most delicious of his life. The feelings of regard entertained for him from
  the first by Aveline, had by this time ripened into love; yet, mindful of her
  solemn promise to her father, she checked her growing affection as much as
  lay in her power, and would not, at first, permit any words of tenderness to
  be uttered by him. As weeks, however, and even months, ran on, and no one
  appeared to claim her hand, she began to indulge the hope that the year of
  probation would expire without molestation, and insensibly, and almost before
  she was aware of it, Sir Jocelyn had become complete master of her heart. In
  these interviews, he told her all that occurred to him at
  court&mdash;acquainted her of his hopes of aggrandisement&mdash;and induced
  her to listen to his expectations of a brilliant future, to be shared by them
  together.</p>

  <p>The severe shock Aveline had sustained in the death of her father had
  gradually worn away, and, if not free from occasional depression, she was
  still enabled to take a more cheerful view of things. Never had she seen Sir
  Jocelyn so full of ardour as on the day after the banquet, when he came to
  communicate the intelligence of the jousts, and that he was selected to essay
  his skill against that of Buckingham. The news, however, did not produce upon
  her the effect he expected. Not only she could not share his delight, but she
  was seized with anticipations of coming ill, in connection with this event,
  for which she could not account. Nor could all that Jocelyn said remove her
  misgivings; and, in consequence, their meeting was sadder than usual.</p>

  <p>On the next day, these forebodings of impending calamity were most
  unexpectedly realised. A mysterious personage, wrapped in a long black cloak,
  and wearing a mask, entered her dwelling without standing upon the ceremony
  of tapping at the door. His presence occasioned her much alarm, and it was
  not diminished when he told her, in a stern, and peremptory tone, that she
  must accompany him to Sir Giles Mompesson's habitation. Refusing to give any
  explanation of the cause of this strange summons, he said she would do well
  to comply with it,&mdash;that, indeed, resistance would be idle as Sir Giles
  was prepared to enforce his orders; and that he himself would he responsible
  for her safety. Compelled to be satisfied with these assurances, Aveline
  yielded to the apparent necessity of the case, and set forth with him,
  attended by Dame Sherbourne. With what passed during her interview with the
  extortioner the reader is already acquainted. She had anticipated something
  dreadful; but the reality almost exceeded her anticipations. So overpowered
  was she by the painful intelligence, that it was with difficulty she reached
  home, and the rest of the day was occupied with anxious reflection. Evening
  as usual brought her lover. She met him at the door, where he tied his horse,
  and they entered the little dwelling together. The shades of night were
  coming on apace, and in consequence of the gloom he did not remark the traces
  of distress on her countenance, but went on with the theme uppermost in his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"I know you have ever avoided shows and triumphs," he said; "but I wish I
  could induce you to make an exception in favour of this tilting-match, and
  consent to be present at it. The thought that you were looking on would nerve
  my arm, and make me certain of success."</p>

  <p>"Even if I would, I cannot comply with your request," she replied, in an
  agitated tone. "Prepare yourself, Jocelyn. I have bad news for you."</p>

  <p>He started; and the vision of delight, in which he had been indulging,
  vanished at once.</p>

  <p>"The worst news you could have to tell me, would be that the claim had
  been made," he observed. "I trust it is not that?"</p>

  <p>"It is better to know the worst at once. I have received undoubted
  information that the claim <i>will</i> be made."</p>

  <p>A cry of anguish escaped Sir Jocelyn, as if a severe blow had been dealt
  him&mdash;and he could scarcely articulate the inquiry, "By whom?"</p>

  <p>"That I know not," she rejoined. "But the ill tidings have been
  communicated to me by Sir Giles Mompesson."</p>

  <p>"Sir Giles Mompesson!" exclaimed Sir Jocelyn, scarcely able to credit what
  he heard. "Your father would never have surrendered you to him. It is
  impossible he could have made any compact with such a villain."</p>

  <p>"I do not say that he did; and if he had done so, I would die a thousand
  deaths, and incur all the penalties attached to the sin of disobedience,
  rather than fulfil it. Sir Giles is merely the mouth-piece of another, who
  will not disclose himself till he appears to exact fulfilment of the fatal
  pledge."</p>

  <p>"But, be it whomsoever it may, the claim never can be granted," cried Sir
  Jocelyn, in a voice of agony. "You will not consent to be bound by such a
  contract. You will not thus sacrifice yourself. It is out of all reason. Your
  father's promise cannot bind you. He had no right to destroy his child. Will
  you listen to my council, Aveline?" he continued, vehemently. "You have
  received this warning, and though it is not likely to have been given with
  any very friendly design, still you may take advantage of it, and avoid by
  flight the danger to which you are exposed."</p>

  <p>"Impossible," she answered. "I could not reconcile such a course to my
  conscience, or to my reverence for my father's memory."</p>

  <p>"There is still another course open to you," he pursued, "if you choose to
  adopt it; and that is, to take a stop which shall make the fulfilment of this
  promise impossible."</p>

  <p>"I understand you," she replied; "but that is equally out of the question.
  Often and often have I thought over this matter, and with much uneasiness;
  but I cannot relieve myself of the obligation imposed upon me."</p>

  <p>"O Aveline!" cried Sir Jocelyn. "If you allow yourself, by any fancied
  scruples, to be forced into a marriage repugnant to your feelings, you will
  condemn both yourself and me to misery."</p>

  <p>"I know it&mdash;I feel it; and yet there is no escape," she cried, "Were
  I to act on your suggestions, and fly from this threatened danger, or remove
  it altogether by a marriage with you&mdash;were I to disobey my father, I
  should never know a moment's peace."</p>

  <p>There was a brief pause, interrupted only by her sobs. At length Sir
  Jocelyn exclaimed quickly,</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, we may be unnecessarily alarming ourselves, and this may only be
  a trick of Sir Giles Mompesson. He may have heard of the promise you have
  made to your father, and may try to frighten you. But whoever is put forward
  must substantiate his claim."</p>

  <p>As those words were uttered, there was a slight noise in the apartment,
  and looking up, they beheld the dusky figure of Clement Lanyere, masked and
  cloaked, as was his wont, standing beside them.</p>

  <p>"You here?" cried Sir Jocelyn, in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Ay," replied the promoter; "I am come to tell you that this is no idle
  fear,&mdash;that the claim <i>will</i> be made, and <i>will</i> be
  substantiated."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Aveline, in a tone of anguish.</p>

  <p>"You will not seek to evade it, I know, young mistress," replied the
  promoter; "and therefore, as you have truly said, there is no escape."</p>

  <p>"Only let me know the claimant's name," cried Sir Jocelyn, "and I will
  engage he shall never fulfill his design."</p>

  <p>"O no; this must not be&mdash;you must not resort to violence," said
  Aveline. "I will never consent to owe my deliverance to such means."</p>

  <p>"You shall have all the information you require after the jousts on
  Thursday," said Lanyere; "and let the thought strengthen your arm in the
  strife, for if you fail, Aveline Calveley will have no protector in the hour
  of need."</p>

  <p>With this, he departed as suddenly and mysteriously as he had come.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-8"
     name="ch2-8">CHAPTER VIII.<br>
  Whitehall.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Tilt-yard at Whitehall, where the jousting was appointed
  to take place, was situated on the westerly side of the large area in front
  of the old Banqueting House (destroyed by fire soon after the date of this
  history, and replaced by the stately structure planned by Inigo Jones, still
  existing), and formed part of a long range of buildings appertaining to the
  palace, and running parallel with it in a northerly direction from
  Westminster, devoted to purposes of exercise and recreation, and including
  the Tennis-court, the Bowling-alley, the Manage, and the Cock-pit.</p>

  <p>A succession of brick walls, of various heights, and surmounted by roofs
  of various forms and sizes, marked the position of these buildings, in
  reference to Saint James's Park, which they skirted on the side next to King
  Street. They were mainly, if not entirely erected, in 1532 by Henry VIII.,
  when, after his acquisition from Wolsey, by forfeiture, of Whitehall, he
  obtained by exchange from the Abbot and Convent of Westminister all their
  uninclosed land contiguous to his newly-acquired palace, and immediately
  fenced it round, and converted it into a park.</p>

  <p>To a monarch so fond of robust sports and manly exercises of all kinds as
  our bluff Harry, a tilt-yard was indispensable; and he erected one on a grand
  scale, and made it a place of constant resort. Causing a space of one hundred
  and fifty yards in length and fifty in width to be inclosed and encircled by
  lofty walls, he fixed against the inner side large scaffolds, containing two
  tiers of seats, partitioned from each other like boxes in a theatre, for the
  accommodation of spectators. At the southern extremity of the inclosure he
  reared a magnificent gallery, which he set apart for his consort and the
  ladies in attendance upon her. This was decorated with velvet, and hung with
  curtains of cloth of gold. On grand occasions, when all the court was
  present, the whole of the seats on the scaffolds, previously described, were
  filled with bright-eyed beauties, whose looks and plaudits stimulated to
  deeds of high emprise the knights, who styled themselves their "servants,"
  and besought "favours" from them in the shape of a scarf, a veil, a sleeve, a
  bracelet, a ringlet, or a knot of ribands. At such times Henry himself would
  enter the lists; and, in his earlier days, and before he became too unwieldy
  for active exertion, no ruder antagonist with the lance or sword could be
  found than he. Men indeed, existed in his days, very different in hardihood
  of frame and personal strength from the silken sybarites, enervated by
  constant riot and dissipation, who aped the deeds of arms of their
  grandfathers in the time of James the First.</p>

  <p>But the tilt-yard was by no means neglected by Elizabeth. This
  lion-hearted queen encouraged a taste for chivalrous displays, and took
  almost as much delight in such exhibitions as her stalwart sire. During her
  long reign no festivity was thought complete unless jousting was performed.
  The name of the gallant Sir Philip Sidney need only be mentioned, to show
  that she possessed at least one perfect "mirror of chivalry" amongst her
  courtiers; but her chief favourites, Essex and Leicester, were both
  distinguished for knightly prowess. Many a lance was splintered by them in
  her honour. When the French Embassy arrived in London to treat of a marriage
  between Elizabeth and the Duc d'Anjou, and when a grand temporary
  banqueting-house, three hundred and thirty feet long, and covered with
  canvas, was improvised for the occasion, a magnificent tournament was given
  in the tilt-yard in honour of the distinguished visitors. Old Holinshed tells
  us, that&mdash;"the gallery or place at the end of the tilt-yard, adjoining
  to her Majesty's house at Whitehall, where, as her person should be placed,
  was called, and not without cause, the Castle or Fortress of Perfect Beauty,
  for as much as her highness should be there included." And he also gives a
  curious description of the framework used by the besiegers of the fortress.
  "They had provided," he says, "a frame of wood, which was covered with
  canvas, and painted outwardly in such excellent order, as if it had been very
  natural earth or mould, and carried the name of a rolling-trench, which went
  on wheels which way soever the persons within did drive it. Upon the top
  thereof were placed two cannons of wood, so passing well coloured, as they
  seemed to be, indeed, two fair field pieces of ordnance; and by them were
  placed two men for gunners, clothed in crimson sarcenet, with their baskets
  of earth for defence of their bodies by them. And also there stood on the top
  of the trench an ensign-bearer, in the same suit with the gunners, displaying
  his ensign, and within the said trench was cunningly conveyed divers kinds of
  most excellent music against the Castle of Beauty. These things thus all in
  readiness, the challengers approached, and came down the stable toward the
  tilt-yard." The challengers were the Earl of Arundel, Lord Windsor, Sir
  Philip Sidney, and Sir Fulke Greville; and the defenders were very numerous,
  and amongst them was the doughty Sir Harry Lee, who, as the "unknown knight,"
  broke "six staves right valiantly." All the speeches made by the challengers
  and defenders are reported by Holinshed, who thus winds up his description of
  the first day's triumph:&mdash;"These speeches being ended, both they and the
  rest marched about the tilt-yard, and so going back to the nether end
  thereof, prepared themselves to run, every one in his turn, each defendant
  six courses against the former challengers, who performed their parts so
  valiantly on both sides, that their prowess hath demerited perpetual memory,
  and worthily won honour, both to themselves and their native country, as fame
  hath the same reported." And of the second day he thus writes:&mdash;"Then
  went they to the tourney, where they did very nobly, as the shivering of the
  swords might very well testify; and after that to the barriers, where they
  lashed it out lustily, and fought courageously, as if the Greeks and Trojans
  had dealt their deadly dole. No party was spared, no estate excepted, but
  each knight endeavoured to win the golden fleece, that expected either fame
  or the favour of his mistress, which sport continued all the same day." These
  pageantries were of frequent occurrence, and the pages of the picturesque old
  chronicler above-cited abound with descriptions of them. Yet, in spite of the
  efforts of Elizabeth to maintain its splendour undiminished, the star of
  chivalry was rapidly declining, to disappear for ever in the reign of her
  successor.</p>

  <p>The glitter of burnished steel, the clash of arms, the rude encounter, and
  all other circumstances attendant upon the arena of martial sport, that had
  given so much delight to his predecessors, afforded little pleasure to James;
  as how should they, to a prince whose constitutional timidity was so great
  that he shuddered at the sight of a drawn sword, and abhorred the mimic
  representations of warfare! Neither were the rigorous principles of honour on
  which chivalry was based, nor the obligations they imposed, better suited to
  him. Too faithless by nature to adopt the laws of a Court of Honour, he
  derided the institution as obsolete. Nevertheless, as trials of skill and
  strength in the tilt-yard were still in fashion, he was compelled, though
  against his inclination, to witness them, and in some degree to promote them.
  The day of his accession to the throne&mdash;the 24th March&mdash;was always
  celebrated by tilting and running at the ring, and similar displays were
  invariably made in honour of any important visitor to the court.</p>

  <p>Even in this reign something of a revival of the ancient ardour for
  knightly pastimes took place during the brief career of Prince Henry, who, if
  he had lived to fulfil the promise of his youth, would have occupied a
  glorious page in his country's annals, and have saved it, in all probability,
  from its subsequent convulsions and intestine strife. Inuring himself betimes
  to the weight of armour, this young prince became exceedingly expert in the
  use of all weapons&mdash;could toss the pike, couch the lance, and wield the
  sword, the battle-axe, or the mace, better than any one of his years. The
  tilt-yard and the tennis-court were his constant places of resort, and he was
  ever engaged in robust exercises&mdash;too much so, indeed, for a somewhat
  feeble constitution. Prince Henry indulged the dream of winning back Calais
  from France, and would no doubt have attempted the achievement if he had
  lived.</p>

  <p>Of a more reflective cast of mind than his elder brother, and with tastes
  less martial, Prince Charles still sedulously cultivated all the
  accomplishments, proper to a cavalier. A perfect horseman, and well skilled
  in all the practices of the tilt-yard&mdash;he was a model of courtesy and
  grace; but he had not Prince Henry's feverish and consuming passion for
  martial sports, nor did he, like him, make their pursuit the sole business of
  life. Still, the pure flame of chivalry burnt within his breast, and he fully
  recognised its high and ennobling principles, and accepted the obligations
  they imposed. And in this respect, as in most others, he differed essentially
  from his august father.</p>

  <p>The tilt-yard, and the various buildings adjoining it, already enumerated,
  were approached by two fine gates, likewise erected by Henry VIII., one of
  which, of extraordinary beauty, denominated the Cock-pit Gate, was designed
  by the celebrated painter, Hans Holbein. From an authority we learn that it
  was "built of square stone, with small squares of flint boulder, very neatly
  set; and that it had also battlements, and four lofty towers, the whole being
  enriched with bustos, roses, and portcullises." The other gate, scarcely less
  beautiful, and styled the Westminster Gate, was adorned with statues and
  medallions, and the badges of the royal house of Tudor carved in stone.</p>

  <p>Viewed from the summit of one of the tall turrets of the Holbein Gate, the
  appearance of the palace of Whitehall, at the period of our history, was
  exceedingly picturesque and striking&mdash;perhaps more so than at any
  previous or subsequent epoch, since the various structures of which it was
  composed were just old enough to have acquired a time-honoured character,
  while they were still in tolerable preservation.</p>

  <p>Let us glance at it, then, from this point, and first turn towards the
  great Banqueting House, which presents to us a noble and lengthened façade,
  and contains within a magnificent and lofty hall, occupying nearly its full
  extent, besides several other apartments of regal size and splendour. In this
  building, in former days, with a retinue as princely as that of the King
  himself, Wolsey so often and so sumptuously entertained his royal master,
  that he at last provoked his anger by his ostentation, and was bereft of his
  superb abode. Satisfied with our examination of the Banqueting House, we will
  suffer our gaze to fall upon the broad court beyond it, and upon the numerous
  irregular but picturesque and beautiful structures by which that
  court&mdash;quadrangle it cannot be called, for no uniformity is observed in
  the disposition of the buildings&mdash;is surrounded. Here the eye is
  attracted by a confused mass of roofs, some flat, turreted and embattled,
  some pointed, with fantastical gables and stacks of tall
  chimneys&mdash;others with cupolas and tall clock-towers&mdash;others with
  crocketed pinnacles, and almost all with large gilt vanes. A large palace is
  a city in miniature; and so is it with Whitehall. It has two other courts
  besides the one we are surveying; equally crowded round with buildings,
  equally wanting in uniformity, but equally picturesque. On the east it
  extends to Scotland Yard, and on the west to the open space in front of
  Westminster Hall. The state apartments face the river, and their large
  windows look upon the stream.</p>

  <p>Quitting the exalted position we have hitherto assumed, and viewing
  Whitehall from some bark on the Thames, we shall find that it has a stern and
  sombre look, being castellated, in part, with towers like those over
  Traitor's Gate, commanding the stairs that approach it from the river. The
  Privy Gardens are beautifully laid out in broad terrace walks, with dainty
  parterres, each having a statue in the midst, while there is a fountain in
  the centre of the inclosure. In addition to the gardens, and separated from
  them by an avenue of tall trees, is a spacious bowling-green. Again changing
  our position, we discover, on the south of the gardens, and connected with
  the state apartments, a long ambulatory, called the Stone Gallery. Then
  returning to our first post of observation, and taking a bird's-eye view of
  the whole, after examining it in detail, as before mentioned, we come to the
  conclusion, that, though irregular in the extreme, and with no pretension
  whatever to plan in its arrangement, the Palace of Whitehall is eminently
  picturesque, and imposing from its vast extent. If taken in connection with
  Westminster Hall, the Parliament House, and the ancient Abbey&mdash;with the
  two towering gateways, on one of which we, ourselves, are perched&mdash;with
  the various structures appertaining to it, and skirting Saint James's Park,
  and with the noble gothic cross at Charing, we are fain to acknowledge, that
  it constitutes a very striking picture.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-9"
     name="ch2-9">CHAPTER IX.<br>
  Prince Charles.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There is now great stir within the palace, and its principal
  court is full of horsemen, some of them apparelled in steel, and with their
  steeds covered with rich trappings, and all attended by pages and yeomen in
  resplendent liveries. Besides these, there are trumpeters in crimson
  cassocks, mounted on goodly horses, and having their clarions adorned with
  silken pennons, on which the royal arms are broidered. Then there are
  kettle-drummers and other musicians, likewise richly arrayed and well
  mounted, and the various pages, grooms, and officers belonging to the Prince
  of Wales, standing around his charger, which is caparisoned with white and
  gold.</p>

  <p>Distinguishable even amidst this brilliant and knightly throng is Sir
  Jocelyn Mounchensey. Mounted upon a fiery Spanish barb, presented to him by
  the Conde de Gondomar, he is fully equipped for the jousts. The trappings of
  his steed are black and white velvet, edged with silver, and the plumes upon
  his helmet are of the same colours, mingled. He is conversing with the
  Spanish Ambassador, who, like all the rest, is superbly attired, though not
  in armour, and is followed by a crowd of lacqueys in jerkins and hose of
  black satin, guarded with silver.</p>

  <p>An unusual degree of bustle proclaims the approach of some personage of
  extraordinary importance.</p>

  <p>This is soon made known to be the Marquis of Buckingham. His arrival is
  announced by loud flourishes from the six mounted trumpeters by whom he is
  preceded. Their horses are caparisoned with orange-coloured taffeta, while
  they themselves are habited in gaberdines of the same stuff. After the
  trumpeters come four gentlemen ushers, and four pages, mounted on his spare
  horses, and habited in orange-coloured doublets and hose, with yellow plumes
  in their caps. To them succeed the grooms in mandilions, or loose sleeveless
  jackets, leading the Marquis's charger, which is to run in the lists&mdash;a
  beautiful dark bay jennet&mdash;trapped with green velvet, sewn with pearls,
  and pounced with gold. Next comes Buckingham himself, in a magnificent suit
  of armour, engraved and damaskeened with gold, with an aigret of orange
  feathers nodding on his casque. Thus apparelled, it is impossible to imagine
  a nobler or more chivalrous figure than he presents. Though completely cased
  in steel, his magnificent person seems to have lost none of its freedom of
  movement, and he bears himself with as much grace and ease as if clad in his
  customary habiliments of silk and velvet. For the moment he rides a sorrel
  horse, whose spirit is too great to allow him to be safely depended upon in
  the lists, but who now serves by his fire and impetuosity to display to
  advantage his rider's perfect management. Buckingham is followed by thirty
  yeomen, apparelled like the pages, and twenty gentlemen in short cloaks and
  Venetian hose. He acknowledges the presence of his antagonist and the Spanish
  Ambassador, with a courteous salutation addressed to each, and then riding
  forward, takes up a position beside the Duke of Lennox, who, mounted and
  fully equipped, and having his five companions-at-arms with him, is awaiting
  the coming forth of Prince Charles.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Lennox is very sumptuously arrayed in armour, partly blue, and
  partly gilt and graven, and his charger is caparisoned with cloth of gold,
  embroidered with pearls. Besides this he has four spare horses, led by his
  pages, in housings equally gorgeous and costly. These pages have cassock
  coats, and Venetian hose, of cloth of silver, laid with gold lace, and caps
  with gold bands and white feathers, and white buskins. His rétinue consists
  of forty gentlemen and yeomen, and four trumpeters. His companions-at-arms
  are all splendidly accoutred, and mounted on richly-caparisoned chargers. The
  most noticeable figure amongst them, however, is that of Sir Giles Mompesson;
  and he attracts attention from the circumstance of his armour being entirely
  sable, his steed jet black, and his housings, plumes, and all his equipments
  of the same sombre hue.</p>

  <p>At this juncture, a page, in the Prince's livery of white and gold,
  approaches Sir Jocelyn, and informs him that his highness desires to speak
  with him before they proceed to the tilt-yard. On receiving the summons the
  young knight immediately quits De Gondomar, and, following the page to the
  doorway leading to the state apartments, dismounts at the steps, leaving his
  steed in charge of his youthful companion.</p>

  <p>On entering the vestibule he finds a large party assembled, comprising
  some of the fairest dames of court, and several noble gallants, who intend
  taking no other part than that of spectators in the approaching
  tilting-match. Most of them are known to Sir Jocelyn, and they eagerly crowd
  round him, fearing something may have occurred to interfere with the
  proceedings of the day. The young knight allays their apprehensions, and
  after experiencing the kindling influence always produced by the smiles of
  the fair, begins to ascend the great staircase, and has nearly reached the
  door at its head, communicating with the Stone Gallery, when it is thrown
  open by an usher, and Prince Charles comes forth.</p>

  <p>The noble countenance of Prince Charles is stamped with the same gravity,
  and slightly touched with the same melancholy, which distinguished his
  features through life, but which naturally deepened as misfortune fell upon
  him. But as those dark days cannot now be discerned, and, as all seems
  brilliant around him, and full of brightest promise, this prophetic
  melancholy is thought to lend interest to his handsome features. He is
  attired in a suit of black armour of exquisite workmanship, lacking only the
  helmet, which is carried by a page&mdash;as are the <i>volante pièce</i>, the
  <i>mentonnière</i>, and the <i>grande-garde</i>, intended to be worn in the
  field. On seeing Sir Jocelyn, he pauses, and signs to his attendants to stand
  back.</p>

  <p>"I have sent for you, Sir Jocelyn," he said, "to ascertain whether it is
  true that Sir Giles Mompesson is amongst the Duke of Lennox's party."</p>

  <p>"It is perfectly true, your highness," replied Sir Jocelyn; "he is now in
  the court-yard."</p>

  <p>A shade of displeasure crossed the Prince's noble countenance, and his
  brow darkened.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear it; and but that I should grievously offend the King,
  my father, I would forbid him to take part in the jousts," he cried. "Sir
  Giles deserves to be degraded from knighthood, rather than enjoy any of its
  honourable privileges."</p>

  <p>"Entertaining these sentiments, if your highness will make them known to
  the King, he will doubtless order Sir Giles's immediate withdrawal from the
  lists," said Sir Jocelyn. "Most assuredly he is unworthy to enter them."</p>

  <p>"Not so," rejoined the Prince. "I have already represented the matter to
  his Majesty, and trusted my remonstrances would be attended to. But I find
  they have proved ineffectual. Buckingham, it appears, has more weight than I
  have. Yet this notorious extortioner's insolence and presumption ought not to
  pass unpunished."</p>

  <p>"They shall not, your highness," replied Sir Jocelyn. "I will so deal with
  him that I will warrant he will never dare show himself within the precincts
  of the palace again."</p>

  <p>"Do nothing rashly," said the Prince. "You must not disguise from yourself
  that you may displease the King, and provoke Buckingham's animosity."</p>

  <p>"I cannot help it," returned Sir Jocelyn. "I will insult him, if he
  crosses my path."</p>

  <p>"I cannot blame you," said the Prince. "In your position I should do the
  same; and I am only restrained by the injunctions laid upon me by the King,
  from commanding his instant departure. But I must proceed towards the
  tilt-yard. We shall meet again anon."</p>

  <p>With this he descended the staircase; and as soon as his train of
  gentlemen-ushers and pages had passed on, Sir Jocelyn followed, and making
  his way through the still-crowded vestibule, gained the door, and vaulted on
  the back of his steed.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-10"
     name="ch2-10">CHAPTER X.<br>
  The Old Palace-Yard of Westminster.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The throng outside the gates of Whitehall felt their breasts
  dilate, and their pulses dance, as they listened to the flourishes of the
  trumpets and cornets, the thundering bruit of the kettle-drums, and other
  martial music that proclaimed the setting forth of the steel-clad champions
  who were presently to figure in the lists.</p>

  <p>It was, in sooth, a goodly sight to see the long and brilliant procession
  formed by the fourteen knights, each so gallantly mounted, so splendidly
  accoutred, and accompanied by such a host of gentlemen ushers, pages, yeomen,
  and grooms, some on horseback, and some on foot; and the eye of the looker-on
  was never wearied of noticing the diversity of their habiliments,&mdash;some
  of the knights having cuirasses and helmets, polished as silver, and
  reflecting the sun's rays as from a mirror,&mdash;some, russet-coloured
  armour,&mdash;some, blue harness,&mdash;some, fluted,&mdash;some, corslets
  damaskeened with gold, and richly ornamented,&mdash;others, black and
  lacquered breastplates, as was the case with the harness of Prince
  Charles,&mdash;and one, a dead black coat of mail, in the instance of Sir
  Giles Mompesson. The arms of each were slightly varied, either in make or
  ornament. A few wore sashes across their breastplates, and several had knots
  of ribands tied above the coronals of their lances, which were borne by their
  esquires.</p>

  <p>In order to give the vast crowd assembled in the neighbourhood of
  Whitehall, an opportunity of witnessing as much as possible of the chivalrous
  spectacle, it was arranged by Prince Charles that the line of the procession
  should first take its course through the Holbein Grate, and then, keeping
  near the wall of the Privy Garden, should pass beneath the King's Gate and
  draw up for a short time in the Old Palace-yard near Westminster-hall, where
  a great concourse was assembled, amidst which a space was kept clear by
  parties of halberdiers and yeomen of the guard.</p>

  <p>The procession was headed by the Prince, and the stately step of his
  milk-white charger well beseemed his own majestic deportment. When the long
  train of gentlemen-ushers and pages accompanying him had moved on, so as to
  leave the course clear for the next comer and his followers, a young knight
  presented himself, who, more than any other in the procession, attracted the
  attention of the spectators. This youthful knight's visor was raised so as to
  disclose his features, and these were so comely, that, combined with his
  finely-proportioned figure, perfectly displayed by his armour, he offered an
  <i>ensemble</i> of manly attractions almost irresistible to female eyes. Nor
  did the grace and skill which he exhibited in the management of his steed
  commend him less highly to sterner judges, who did not fail to discover that
  his limbs, though light, were in the highest degree vigorous and athletic,
  and they prognosticated most favourably of his chances of success in the
  jousts.</p>

  <p>When it became known that this <i>preux chevalier</i> was Sir Jocelyn
  Mounchensey, the chosen antagonist of Buckingham, still greater attention was
  bestowed upon him; and as his good looks and gallant bearing operated
  strongly, as we have stated, in his favour, many a good wish and lusty cheer
  were uttered for him.</p>

  <p>The effect of all this excitement among the crowd on behalf of Mounchensey
  was to render Buckingham's reception by the same persons comparatively cold;
  and the cheers given for the magnificent favourite and his princely retinue
  were so few and so wanting in spirit, that he who was wholly unaccustomed to
  such neglect, and who had been jealously listening to the cheers attending
  Mounchensey's progress, was highly offended, and could scarcely conceal his
  displeasure. But if he was indignant at his own reception, he was exasperated
  at the treatment experienced by his ally.</p>

  <p>Close behind him rode a knight in black armour, with a sable panache on
  his helm. Stalwart limbs and a manly bearing had this knight, and he bestrode
  his powerful charger like one well accustomed to the saddle; but though no
  one could gainsay his skill as a horseman, or his possible prowess as a
  man-at-arms, most thought he had no title to be there, and gave unmistakable
  evidence of their conviction by groans and hootings.</p>

  <p>This black knight was Sir Giles Mompesson, and very grim and menacing was
  his aspect.</p>

  <p>Ample accommodation for the knightly company and their attendants, as well
  as for the multitudes congregated to behold them was afforded by the broad
  area in front of Westminster Hall; nevertheless, as those in the rear could
  not see as well as those in front, every chance elevation offering a better
  view was eagerly seized upon. All the accessible points of Westminster
  Hall&mdash;its carved porch and windows&mdash;were invaded. So were the gates
  of the Old Palace hard by&mdash;so were the buttresses of the Abbey; and men
  were perched, like grotesque ornaments, on crocketed pinnacles and stone
  water-spouts. The tall and curiously-painted clock tower, resembling an
  Italian campanile, which then faced the portals of Westminster Hall, was
  covered with spectators. But the position most coveted, and esteemed the
  best, was the fountain at that time standing in the midst of the old
  palace-yard. This structure, which was of great antiquity and beauty, with a
  pointed summit supported by tall slender shafts, and a large basin beneath,
  formed a sort of pivot, round which the procession turned as it arrived upon
  the ground, and consequently formed the best point of view of all; and those
  were esteemed highly fortunate who managed to obtain a place upon it.</p>

  <p>Amongst these lucky individuals were three of the reader's acquaintances,
  and we think he will scarce fail to recognise the saucy-faced apprentice with
  the cudgel under his arm, and the fair-haired, blue-eyed, country-looking
  maiden at his side, as well as the hale old rustic by whom they were
  attended. All three were delighted with their position, and Dick Taverner
  took full credit to himself for his cleverness in procuring it for them. As
  to pretty Gillian, nothing could please her better, for she could not only
  see all that was going forward, but everybody could see her&mdash;even Prince
  Charles himself; and she flattered herself that she attraeted no little
  attention. And now that the whole of the procession had come up, the picture
  was certainly magnificent, and well worth contemplation. Everything was
  favourable to the enjoyment of the spectacle. The day was bright and
  beautiful, and a sparkling sunshine lighted up the splendid accoutrements of
  the knights, the gorgeous caparisons of their steeds, and the rich
  habiliments of their attendants; while a gentle breeze stirred the plumes
  upon the helmets, and fluttered the bandrols on their lances. The effect was
  heightened by enlivening strains of minstrelsy, and the fanfares of the
  trumpeters. The utmost enthusiasm was awakened among the spectators, and
  their acclamations were loud and long.</p>

  <p>At this juncture, Dick Taverner, who had been shouting as lustily as the
  rest, tossing his cap in the air, and catching it dexterously as it fell,
  held his breath and clapped his bonnet on his head, for an object met his eye
  which fixed his attention. It was the sombre figure of a knight accoutred in
  black armour, who was pressing his steed through the throng in the direction
  of the fountain. His beaver was up, and the sinister countenance was not
  unknown to the apprentice.</p>

  <p>"Saints defend us!" he ejaculated. "Is it possible that can be Sir Giles
  Mompesson? What doth he here amidst this noble company? The villainous
  extortioner cannot surely be permitted to enter the lists."</p>

  <p>"Hold your peace, friend, if you are wise," muttered a deep voice behind
  him.</p>

  <p>"No, I will not be silent," rejoined the apprentice, without looking round
  at his cautioner, but keeping his eye fixed upon Sir Giles. "I will tell the
  felon knight my mind. I am not afraid of him. Harkye, my masters," he called,
  in a loud voice, to those around him. "Do you know who that black raven
  before you is? If not, I will tell you. He would peck out your eyes if he
  could, and devour you and your substance, as he has done that of many others.
  That bird of ill omen is Sir Giles Mompesson."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" cried a bystander, indignantly. "Yet, now I look again, 'tis
  certainly he."</p>

  <p>"As certain as that we are standing here," said the apprentice; "and if
  you want further proof, behold, he is closing his visor. He thinks to hide
  himself from our notice; but the trick shall not avail him. A groan for the
  knavish extortioner, my masters&mdash;a deep groan for Sir Giles
  Mompesson!"</p>

  <p>Thus enjoined, a great hooting was made by the bystanders, and Sir Giles's
  name was coupled with epithets that could not be very agreeable to his
  ear.</p>

  <p>"You were best let him alone, fool," cried the deep voice behind Dick.
  "You will only bring yourself into trouble."</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"

  </div>

  <p>But the apprentice was not to be thus advised; and could not even be
  restrained by the entreaties of Gillian, who was sadly apprehensive that some
  mischief would befall him. So conspicuous did he make himself in the
  disturbance, that at last Sir Giles rode towards him, and singling him out,
  seized him with his gauntleted hand, and dragged him from the edge of the
  fountain. Dick struggled manfully to get free, but he was in a grasp of iron,
  and all his efforts at releasing himself were ineffectual. He called on those
  near him to rescue him, but they shrank from the attempt. Poor Gillian was
  dreadfully alarmed. She thought her lover was about to be sacrificed to Sir
  Giles's resentment on the spot; and, falling on her knees, she piteously
  besought him to spare his life.</p>

  <p>"For shame, Gillian," cried Dick; "do not demean yourself thus. The
  caitiff knight dares not harm me for his life; and if he should maltreat me,
  I shall be well avenged by my patron, Sir Jocelyn Mounchensey. I would my
  voice might reach him&mdash;I should not long be kept here. To the rescue!
  Sir Jocelyn! to the rescue!" And he shouted forth the young knight's name at
  the top of his voice.</p>

  <p>"Who calls me?" demanded Mounchensey, pressing through the throng in the
  direction of the outcries.</p>

  <p>"I, your humble follower, Dick Taverner," roared the apprentice; "I am in
  the clutches of the devil, and I pray you release me."</p>

  <p>"Ha! what is this?" cried Sir Jocelyn. "Set him free, at once, Sir Giles,
  I command you."</p>

  <p>"What, if I refuse?" rejoined the other.</p>

  <p>"Then I will instantly enforce compliance," thundered Mounchensey.</p>

  <p>"If I release him it is because I must defend myself and punish your
  insolence," cried Sir Giles. And as he spoke, he thrust back the apprentice
  with such force that he would have fallen to the ground if he had not dropped
  into the arms of his kneeling mistress.</p>

  <p>"Now, Sir Jocelyn," continued Sir Giles, fiercely; "you shall answer for
  this interference"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Hold!" interposed the authoritative voice of Prince Charles; "we must
  have no unseemly brawls here. To your places at once in the procession, Sir
  Knights. We are about to set forward to the tilt-yard."</p>

  <p>With this, he gave the word to move on, and all further sound of
  disturbance was drowned by the trampling of steeds and the bruit of the
  kettle-drums, cornets, and trumpets.</p>

  <p>Nowise disheartened by what had occurred, Dick Taverner would have
  followed with the stream, and carried his mistress and her grandsire along
  with him; but the former had been so much terrified by what had occurred,
  that dreading lest her lover's imprudence should get him into further
  scrapes, she positively refused to proceed any further.</p>

  <p>"I have seen quite enough," she cried; "and if you have any love for me,
  Dick, you will take me away, and not expose yourself to further risk. If you
  are indeed bent on going on, I shall return with my grandsire."</p>

  <p>"He will do well to follow your advice, young mistress," said the deep
  voice which had previously sounded in Dick's ears; "if he had taken mine, he
  would not have voluntarily thrust himself into the fangs of the tiger, from
  which it is well for him that he has escaped with a whole skin."</p>

  <p>As this was said, Dick and his mistress turned towards the speaker, and
  beheld a tall man, masked, and muffled in a black cloak.</p>

  <p>"Heaven shield us! 'tis the Enemy!" exclaimed Gillian, trembling.</p>

  <p>"Not so, fair damsel," replied the disguised personage; "I am not the
  arch-enemy of man, neither am I enemy of yours, nor of Dick Taverner. Your
  froward lover neglected my previous caution, but I will give him another, in
  the hope that you may induce him to profit by it. Let him keep out of the
  reach of Sir Giles Mompesson's emissaries, or his wedding-day will be longer
  in coming than you both hope for. Nay, it may not come at all."</p>

  <p>With these words, the man in the mask mingled with the crowd, and almost
  instantly disappeared, leaving the young couple, especially Gillian, in much
  consternation. So earnest was the maiden for instant departure, that Dick was
  obliged to comply; and as the whole of the thoroughfares about Whitehall were
  impassable, they proceeded to the river side, and took boat for London
  Bridge, at a hostel near which old Greenford had put up his horse.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-11"
     name="ch2-11">CHAPTER XI.<br>
  The Tilt-Yard.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Meanwhile, the procession was pursuing its slow course
  towards the tilt-yard. It returned by the route it had taken in coming; but
  it now kept on the north side of King Street, which thoroughfare was divided
  in the midst by a railing, and deeply sanded.</p>

  <p>Here, as in the area before Westminster-hall, not a wall, not a window,
  not a roof, but had its occupants. The towers of the two great gates were
  thronged&mdash;so were the roofs of the tennis-court and the manége, and the
  summit of the cock-pit; the latter, indeed, was a capital position inasmuch
  as it not only afforded an excellent view of the procession, but commanded
  the interior of the tilt-yard. No wonder, therefore, that great efforts
  should be made to obtain a place upon it, nor is it surprising that our old
  friend, Madame Bonaventure, who had by no means lost her influence among the
  court gallants, though she lacked, the support of Lord Roos, owing to the
  absence of that young nobleman upon his travels,&mdash;it is not surprising,
  we say, that she should be among the favoured individuals who had secured a
  position there. Undoubtedly, she would have preferred a seat amongst the
  court dames in the galleries of the tilt-yard, but as this was unattainable,
  she was obliged to be content; and, indeed, she had no reason to complain,
  for she saw quite as much as those inside, and was more at her ease.</p>

  <p>From this exalted position, while listening to the inspiriting clangour of
  the trumpets, the clattering of arms, and the trampling and neighing of
  steeds, Madame Bonaventure could scrutinize the deportment of each knight as
  he issued from the lofty arch of the Holbein Gate, and rode slowly past her.
  She had ample time to count the number of his attendants before he
  disappeared from her view. As Sir Jocelyn Mounchensey approached, with his
  visor raised, and his countenance radiant with smiles at the cheers he had
  received, she recognised in him her former guest, and participating in the
  general enthusiasm, prevailing for the young knight, she leaned over the
  parapet, and addressed to him a greeting so hearty that it procured for her a
  courteous salutation in return. Enchanted with this, she followed with her
  eyes the graceful figure of Sir Jocelyn till it was lost to view&mdash;to
  re-appear a moment after in the tilt-yard.</p>

  <p>Turning in this direction,&mdash;for all her interest was now centred in
  the young knight,&mdash;Madame Bonaventure allowed her gaze to pass over the
  entrance of the lists, and she goon espied him she sought, in conference with
  Prince Charles, and some other knights of his party. Near them was stationed
  Garter King-at-arms, apparelled in his tabard, and mounted on a horse covered
  with housings of cloth of gold. Glancing round the inclosure she perceived
  that all the foremost seats in the galleries and scaffolds set apart for the
  principal court dames were already filled, and she was quite dazzled with the
  galaxy of female loveliness presented to her gaze. Behind the court dames
  were a host of fluttering gallants in rich apparel, laughing and jesting with
  them on the probable issue of the contest they had come to witness.</p>

  <p>She then looked round the arena. Stout barriers of wood were drawn across
  it, with openings at either end for the passage of the knights. At these
  openings were placed all the various officers of the tilt-yard, whose
  attendance was not required outside, including eight mounted trumpeters, four
  at one end of the field, and four at the other, together with a host of
  yeomen belonging to Prince Charles, in liveries of white, with leaves of
  gold, and black caps, with wreaths and bands of gold, and black and white
  plumes.</p>

  <p>At the western extremity of the inclosure stood the royal gallery, richly
  decorated for the occasion with velvet and cloth of gold, and having the
  royal arms emblazoned in front. Above it floated the royal standard.
  Supported by strong oaken posts, and entered by a staircase at the side, this
  gallery was open below, and the space thus left was sufficiently large to
  accommodate a dozen or more mounted knights, while thick curtains could be
  let down at the sides to screen them from observation, if required. Here it
  was intended that the Prince of Wales and his six companions-at-arms should
  assemble, and wait till summoned forth from it by the marshals of the field.
  There was a similar place of assemblage for the Duke of Lennox and his
  knights at the opposite end of the tilt-yard; and at both spots there were
  farriers, armourers, and grooms in attendance, to render assistance, if
  needful.</p>

  <p>On the right of the field stood an elevated platform, covered with a
  canopy, and approached by a flight of steps. It was reserved for the marshals
  and judges, and facing it was the post affixed to the barriers, from which
  the ring, the grand prize of the day, was suspended, at a height exactly
  within reach of a lance. Like the streets without, the whole arena was deeply
  sanded.</p>

  <p>This was what Madame Bonaventure beheld from the roof of the cock-pit, and
  a very pretty sight she thought it.</p>

  <p>All things, it will be seen, were in readiness, in the tilt
  yard,&mdash;and the arrival of the King seemed to be impatiently
  expected&mdash;not only by the knights who were eager to display their
  prowess, but by the court dames and the gallants with them, as well as by all
  the officials scattered about in different parts of the field, and enlivening
  it by their variegated costumes.</p>

  <p>Suddenly loud acclamations resounding from all sides of the tilt-yard,
  accompanied by flourishes of trumpets, proclaimed the entrance of the royal
  laggard to the gallery. James took his place in the raised seat assigned to
  him, and after conferring for a few moments with the Conde de Gondomar, who
  formed part of the brilliant throng of nobles and ambassadors in attendance,
  he signified to Sir John Finett that the jousting might commence, and the
  royal pleasure was instantly made known to the marshals of the field.</p>

  <p>The first course was run by Prince Charles, who acquitted himself with
  infinite grace and skill, but failed in carrying off the ring; and similar
  ill luck befell the Duke of Lennox. The Marquis of Hamilton was the next to
  run, and he met with no better success; and the fourth essay was made by
  Buckingham. His career was executed with all the consummate address for which
  the favourite was remarkable, and it appeared certain that he would carry off
  the prize; but in lowering his lance he did not make sufficient allowance for
  the wind, and this caused it slightly to swerve, and though he touched the
  ring, he did not bear it away. The course, however, was considered a good one
  by the judges, and much applauded; but the Marquis was greatly mortified by
  his failure.</p>

  <p>It now came to Sir Jocelyn's turn, and his breast beat high with ardour,
  as he prepared to start on his career. Keeping his back to the ring till the
  moment of setting forward, he made a demi-volte to the right, and then
  gracefully raising his lance, as his steed started on its career, he
  continued to hold it aloft until he began to near the object of his aim, when
  he gently and firmly allowed the point to decline over the right ear of his
  horse, and adjusted it in a line with the ring. His aim proved so unerring
  that he carried off the prize, amid universal applause.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-12"
     name="ch2-12">CHAPTER XII.<br>
  The Tilting Match.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">After all the other competitors for the prize had essayed a
  career within the arena, Sir Jocelyn's was held to be the best course run.
  The ring was again carried off both by the Earl of Pembroke and Lord
  Mordaunt; but in the opinion of the marshals of the field, neither of those
  noblemen displayed so much grace and skill as Mounchensey: and the decision
  was confirmed by the King.</p>

  <p>The applauses which rang through the tilt-yard, on the announcement that
  our handsome young knight had gained the first course, increased the
  bitterness of Buckingham's feelings towards him; and he expressed his regrets
  in a low tone to Sir Giles Mompesson that the combat about to take place was
  not <i>à l'outrance</i> instead of being <i>à plaisance</i>.</p>

  <p>Sir Giles smiled grimly in reply.</p>

  <p>Some little time elapsed, during which preparations were made for the
  tilting-match, and great excitement pervaded the assemblage. The King
  laughingly inquired of the Spanish ambassador if he still felt secure of
  winning his wager, and was answered by De Gondomar that he had never had the
  slightest misgiving on the subject, but he was now better satisfied than ever
  that the result of the coming struggle would justify his expectations. In the
  ladies' gallery an unusual degree of interest was manifested in what was
  going forward; and many a wish was audibly expressed by many a fair dame in
  Mounchensey's favour.</p>

  <p>At length, the trumpets sounded, and the cries of the heralds were heard,
  cheering on the combatants, as they prepared to dash furiously against each
  other, bidding them do their devoir bravely, since bright eyes looked down
  upon them. These stimulants to valorous display were scarcely needed, for the
  champions were eager to prove their prowess. Issuing one by one, from beneath
  their respective scaffolds, and curbing the impatience of their steeds till
  they received from the marshals permission to start, they rushed from their
  posts with lightning swiftness to meet with a crashing shock midway. Various
  successes attended the different combatants, but on the whole the advantage
  lay clearly on the side of the Duke of Lennox, none of whose party had
  sustained any material discomfiture; while on the side of Prince Charles, the
  Earls of Montgomery and Rutland had been unhorsed. The interest of the
  spectators was kept in breathless suspense to the last, it being arranged
  that the tilting-match should close with the conflict between Buckingham and
  Mounchensey.</p>

  <p>Thus, when the trumpets sounded for the seventh and last time, and the two
  knights stationed themselves opposite each other, every eye was intently
  fixed upon them. Apparently, no two antagonists could be better or more
  equally matched than they were; and throughout the whole field it would have
  been in vain to search for another pair equally gifted by nature, both being
  models of manly beauty of feature and symmetry of frame. Indeed they might
  have been cast in the same mould, so nearly alike were they in shape and
  size; and if their armour had been similar, and their steeds corresponding in
  colour, they would have been undistinguishable, when apart. Buckingham in
  some respects presented the nobler figure of the two, owing to his flowing
  plumes, his embossed and inlaid armour, and the magnificent housings of his
  charger&mdash;but he was fully rivalled by the grace and chivalrous air of
  his antagonist.</p>

  <p>As the Marquis, confident in his address, disdained the use of the
  <i>passe-guarde</i> and the <i>mentonnière</i>, Mounchensey abandoned those
  defences, though they were used by all the other knights, and placed his
  reliance in the strength of his breast-plate and gorget, and in the force of
  his right arm.</p>

  <p>When summoned forth by the trumpets, the two champions executed
  demi-voltes with curvets, and then stood stock-still at either end of the
  barriers. Each then selected a lance from the bundle offered them by the
  esquires, and their choice of a weapon made, they carefully fastened down
  their visors, which up to this moment had been raised.</p>

  <p>Seeing them in readiness, the heralds gave the signal for the encounter.
  Starting against each other like thunder-bolts, they met in mid-career. The
  shock was tremendous, and many a cry sprang from female lips, while bursts of
  applause arose from the hardier spectators.</p>

  <p>Both lances were shivered, but the results of the strokes dealt on either
  side were widely different. Mounchensey maintained his seat firmly in the
  saddle, though his steed had been forced back upon its haunches by his
  opponent's blow, who had touched his gorget; and riding on with all the ease,
  vigour, and grace, our young knight had previously exhibited, he threw down
  the truncheon of his lance, and opened his gauntlet to show that his hand was
  wholly uninjured.</p>

  <p>Very differently had it fared with Buckingham, whose defeat was
  unquestionable. Unhorsed and unhelmeted, he was rolled in the dust; and as he
  sprang to his feet, had the mortification of hearing the deafening cheers
  that greeted his adversary's triumph. Eager to hide his confusion, he vaulted
  upon the back of his steed, which was brought to him by an esquire, the
  animal's flanks still quivering and reeking from the terrible shock it had
  undergone, and dashed beneath the scaffold he had so lately quitted&mdash;his
  pride severely humbled.</p>

  <p>While the crest-fallen favourite thus retired to recover himself, Sir
  Jocelyn rode slowly towards the royal gallery. Having now raised his visor,
  his features were fully revealed to view, and perhaps were never seen to such
  advantage as at this proud and happy moment. His emotions were indeed
  enviable&mdash;but one thing was wanting to complete his
  satisfaction&mdash;the presence of her, before whom, of all others, he was
  most eager to distinguish himself. What mattered it that scarves and
  kerchiefs were waved to him by some of the fairest dames in the land? What
  mattered it that his name was called aloud, and that gloves and knots of
  ribands fell at his feet, as he rode past the ladies' gallery? His heart was
  untouched by smile or glance, and he paused not to pick up one of the favours
  showered upon him.</p>

  <p>But what means this sudden change in his demeanour? Why does he start and
  stop, and look inquiringly towards the back of the gallery? Whom does he
  discern amongst that bevy of beauties? Can it be Aveline? And if so, how
  comes she there?</p>

  <p>As he pauses, all eyes are fixed upon her towards whom his gaze is
  directed. There is no difficulty in detecting the object of his regards, for
  her attire is simpler than that of all the glittering dames around her, and
  of a sadder hue. Her confusion also betrays her. She would not be seen by him
  she came to see. She would muffle up her features, but it is too late; and
  she is not only fully exposed to his view, but to that of a hundred other
  curious eyes. Though many a high-born damsel marvels at the young knight's
  insensibility to her own superior attractions, none can deny that the unknown
  maiden is exquisitely beautiful, and demands are eagerly made as to who she
  may be. No one can answer&mdash;and no clue is given by her companion, for
  the elderly dame by whom she is attended, and who resembles a duenna, is
  likewise unknown to all.</p>

  <p>As soon as Sir Jocelyn recovers his surprise, he requests a favour from
  the lady of his love, and she cannot refuse him&mdash;for immediately all the
  dames in front of the gallery move aside, to let her advance.</p>

  <p>With her pale cheeks crimsoned with blushes, and her dark eyes flashing
  with mingled emotions of shame and pleasure, Aveline steps forward&mdash;and
  having no other favour to bestow upon her knight, she gives him her kerchief,
  which he presses to his lips, and then with a graceful salutation moves
  forward on his course. This is no time for explanation&mdash;and he must be
  content with his happiness, without inquiring how it has been procured for
  him.</p>

  <p>The incident, however, has been generally noticed, and causes a good deal
  of speculation and talk amongst the female portion of the assemblage. There
  is one individual, however, of the opposite sex, who witnesses it with
  sentiments different from those by which most other observers are affected.
  This is Sir Giles Mompesson. He, it appears, has not been unaware of
  Aveline's presence at the jousts, though he did not anticipate its revelation
  in this manner to Sir Jocelyn; and a bitter smile crosses his lips, as he
  watches the brief interview between the pair. He cares not what transports
  they indulge in now&mdash;nor what hopes they form for the future. He
  promises himself that he will effectually mar their bliss!</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-13"
     name="ch2-13">CHAPTER XIII.<br>
  The Felon Knight.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A few more bounds of his steed brought Sir Jocelyn to the
  royal gallery, where he dismounted, and leaving his steed in charge of an
  esquire, ascended the stairs in company with the marshals of the field, and
  presently found himself in the presence of the King. James received him very
  graciously. On the right of the monarch stood the Conde de Gondomar, who
  smiled on his <i>protégé</i> as he approached, and glanced at a silver coffer
  full of diamonds, pearls, emeralds, amethysts, and other precious stones,
  borne by an attendant in the gorgeous livery of the Marquis of
  Buckingham.</p>

  <p>"We greet ye as victor, Sir Jocelyn," said James, as the young knight made
  a profound obeisance to him; "and it rejoices us to say ye hae demeaned
  yourself honourably and fairly in the field. How say ye, Sirs?" he added to
  the marshals and others. "Shall not the prize of the day be adjudged to Sir
  Jocelyn?"</p>

  <p>"It must be so, of right, your Majesty," replied the foremost of them. "A
  better course at the ring could not be run than Sir Jocelyn hath performed,
  nor could greater 'vantage be gained in the jousts than he hath obtained over
  the Marquis of Buckingham. All has been done by him in accordance with the
  rules of honour, and without fraud or supercherie.</p>

  <p>"Enough, gentlemen," said James. "Count, ye hae won your wager; and as to
  you, Sir Jocelyn, ye hae proved yourself a very mirror of
  chivalry&mdash;<i>exemplar antiquoe fortitudinis et
  magnanimitatis</i>&mdash;on the pattern of Bayard, the knight without fear
  and without reproach, and the like of whom we scarce expected to see in these
  latter days. You are right weel entitled to the prize ye hae gained, and
  which his Excellency so honourably assigns to you."</p>

  <p>"With your Majesty's permission, I will add the diamond clasp which I
  staked against the Marquess's casket of gems," said De Gondomar, "and will
  beseech Sir Jocelyn to wear it as a testimony on my part of his merit as a
  cavalier. It is scarcely too much to say for him, after his recent brilliant
  achievements, that he takes rank amongst the foremost of the distinguished
  knights encircling your Majesty's throne."</p>

  <p>"He takes rank as the first and best," cried James, emphatically; "since
  he hath overcome Buckingham, who till this day hath held the chief place
  among our chivalry."</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty overwhelms me by your commendations," replied Sir Jocelyn;
  "and I can only say, in reply, that my best energies shall be devoted to your
  service, whenever and howsoever called upon. As to your Excellency's gift,"
  he added to De Gondomar, who had unfastened the glittering clasp and
  presented it to him, "I shall ever guard it, as a devotee in your own sunny
  land of Spain would the most precious relic."</p>

  <p>The coffer containing the gems was then, upon a sign from the King,
  delivered to Sir Jocelyn, who, as he received it from the attendant, took a
  string of pearls from it and gave them to the marshal, requesting they might
  be offered as <i>largesse</i> to the heralds; and the officer promised that
  the request should be complied with. Having bestowed a similar boon upon each
  of the marshals, Mounchensey requested that the coffer might be placed in
  charge of his esquire&mdash;and his directions were complied with.</p>

  <p>"Is all concluded?" demanded the King.</p>

  <p>"The contest for the prize is necessarily decided," replied the marshal;
  "but there yet remains the combat with the sword on horseback, if it pleases
  Sir Jocelyn to engage in it."</p>

  <p>"What saith our young knight?" demanded the King. "Is he willing to risk
  the laurels he hath so fairly won on another, and it may be more dangerous
  encounter? What he hath already done may fairly entitle him to decline
  further hazard, if he be so minded."</p>

  <p>"I should ill deserve your Majesty's high commendations if I hesitated for
  a moment," replied Mounchensey; "but so far from feeling disinclination to
  the combat, I should regret if this opportunity for further distinction were
  denied me. With your Majesty's gracious permission, I will pray the marshals
  of the field to let it be proclaimed by the heralds and pursuivants-at-arms
  that I challenge any true knight to do battle with me with the sword, and on
  horseback."</p>

  <p>"Ye will fight with a blunted blade, Sir Jocelyn," cried the King. "We
  maun hae nae risk of life. Our dear dog, Steenie, hath had his bonnie craig
  well-nigh broken, and we will hae nae mair mischief done."</p>

  <p>"The laws of the tilt-yard, with which Sir Jocelyn is doubtless well
  acquainted," observed the marshal, "require that the edge of the sword shall
  be dull, as your Majesty hath stated, and that no blow shall be dealt with
  the point of the weapon. These conditions must be strictly observed."</p>

  <p>"They shall be," replied Sir Jocelyn; "and I pray you now to do your
  devoir, and make the proclamation."</p>

  <p>On this the marshal and his followers departed; and Sir Jocelyn, bowing
  reverently to the King, took his way after them, and descending the stairs,
  leaped on the back of his charger.</p>

  <p>Soon after this, and while a sword, blunted in the manner prescribed, was
  girded round his waist by his esquire, the trumpets were sounded, and the
  challenge proclaimed by the marshal. It was immediately responded to by a
  blast from the opposite end of the arena, and a herald, stationed at this
  point, called out in a loud voice that the challenge was accepted. Again the
  excitement rose high among the spectators; again all eyes were directed
  towards Sir Jocelyn; and again many ardent aspirations were uttered by his
  numerous fair admirers for his success,&mdash;though none so fervent as that
  breathed by Aveline. Sir Jocelyn cast one glance towards that part of the
  ladies' gallery where he knew her to be placed, and then prepared for his
  last essay.</p>

  <p>As yet, he knew not who was to be his antagonist; but when a knight in
  sable armour, and with a sable plume upon his helm, rode from beneath the
  scaffold, he discovered, to his great indignation, that it was Sir Giles
  Mompesson. After a moment's reflection, he resolved upon a course of action.
  When the signal for the combat was given by the marshal, and Sir Giles, sword
  in hand, dashed into the arena, Mounchensey rode towards him, but, without
  drawing his sword, and raising himself in the saddle, commanded him in a
  thundering voice to retire.</p>

  <p>The impetuosity of Sir Giles's career carried him past his antagonist, but
  he now wheeled round, and regarded Mounchensey fiercely from beneath the bars
  of his helmet.</p>

  <p>"Retire, said you?" he exclaimed; "not unless you acknowledge yourself
  defeated. In my turn, I bid you go back to the point you started from, and
  commence the combat in due form, or I shall hold you vanquished, and compel
  you to abase your crest."</p>

  <p>"Hear me," cried Sir Jocelyn, "and let it be heard by all. I challenged
  any <i>true</i> knight to the combat, but you answer not to the description.
  I proclaim you publicly in this place as a false and felon knight, and
  declare you utterly unworthy of my sword. Back to your starting-place, and if
  the heralds do their duty, they will hack off your spurs, and drive you with
  shame from the lists."</p>

  <p>"And think you I will tamely brook this insult?" roared Sir Giles; "draw
  your sword at once, and let it be a mortal combat between us."</p>

  <p>"Never," replied Sir Jocelyn, disdainfully. "I will not stoop to the level
  of your infamy."</p>

  <p>"Then stoop to earth," cried Sir Giles, aiming a terrible blow at him with
  his sword.</p>

  <p>If the stroke had taken effect as intended, it would probably have made
  good Mompesson's threat, but Sir Jocelyn was too wary and too agile even for
  his powerful assailant. Before the sword could descend, he seized his
  adversary's wrist, and in another instant possessed himself of the blade.
  This he accomplished without injury, as the sword was blunted. Still
  maintaining his grasp of the weapon, he raised himself in his stirrups to
  give additional force to the blow, and with the pummel of the sword, struck
  Sir Giles a blow upon the brainpan with such violence, that he dropped from
  the saddle as if shot.</p>

  <p>During this strange scene, not a word had been uttered by the spectators,
  who looked on with the greatest curiosity, wondering how it would end. As Sir
  Giles fell from his horse, and lay stretched in perfect insensibility on the
  ground, a tremendous shout was raised, and Sir Jocelyn was as much applauded
  as if he had performed an extraordinary feat&mdash;so universally was the
  extortioner detested.</p>

  <p>Nor was there any sympathy manifested, when a few moments afterwards Sir
  Giles was raised from the ground by the pursuivants, and his helmet being
  removed, exhibited a countenance livid as death, with a stream of blood
  coursing slowly down the temples. Many would have been well-pleased if he had
  been killed outright, but the chirurgeon in attendance pronounced that he was
  only stunned by the blow.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-14"
     name="ch2-14">CHAPTER XIV.<br>
  The Private Cabinet of Sir Giles Mompesson.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A small room, and rendered yet smaller by the numerous
  chests and strong boxes encroaching upon its narrow limits. In some cases
  these boxes are piled, one upon another, till they touch the ceiling. All of
  them look stout enough, yet many are further strengthened by iron hoops and
  broad-headed nails, and secured by huge padlocks. The door is cased with
  iron, within and without, and has a ponderous lock, of which the master of
  the room always keeps the key, and never trusts it out of his own hand.</p>

  <p>This small chamber is the private cabinet of Sir Giles Mompesson.</p>

  <p>No one is permitted to enter it without him. Though his myrmidons are
  fully aware of its existence, and can give a shrewd guess at its contents,
  only two of them have set foot within it. The two thus privileged are Clement
  Lanyere and Lupo Vulp. Neither the promoter nor the scrivener are much in the
  habit of talking over their master's affairs, even with their comrades, and
  are almost as habitually reserved as he is himself; still, from the few words
  let fall by them from time to time, the myrmidons have picked up a tolerable
  notion of the private cabinet, of its hidden cupboards in the walls, its
  drawers with secret springs; its sliding planks with hollows beneath them;
  its chests full of treasure, or what is the same thing as treasure, bonds,
  mortgage-deeds, and other securities; and its carefully concealed hoards of
  plate, jewels, and other valuables. Some of the least scrupulous among
  them&mdash;such as Staring, Hugh, Cutting Dick, and old Tom
  Wootton&mdash;have often discussed the possibility of secretly visiting it,
  and making a perquisition of its stores; but they have been hitherto
  restrained by their fears of their terrible and vindictive master.</p>

  <p>On looking into the cabinet we find Sir Giles seated at a table, with a
  large chest open beside him, from which he has taken for examination sundry
  yellow parchments, with large seals attached to them. He is now occupied with
  a deed, on one of the skins of which the plan of an important estate is
  painted, and on this his attention becomes fixed. His countenance is
  cadaverous, and its ghastly hue adds to its grimness of expression. A band is
  tied round his head, and there is an expression of pain in his face, and an
  air of languor and debility in his manner, very different from what is usual
  with him. It is plain he has not yet recovered from the effects of the
  crushing blow he received at the jousts.</p>

  <p>Opposite him sits his partner, Sir Francis Mitchell; and the silence that
  has reigned between them for some minutes is first broken by the old
  usurer.</p>

  <p>"Well, Sir Giles," he inquires, "are you satisfied with your examination
  of these deeds of the Mounchensey property? The estates have been in the
  family, as you see, for upwards of two centuries&mdash;ever since the reign
  of Henry IV., in fact&mdash;and you have a clear and undisputed title to all
  the property depicted on that plan&mdash;to an old hall with a large park
  around it, eight miles in circumference, and almost as well stocked with deer
  as the royal chase of Theobald's; and you have a title to other territorial
  domains extending from Mounchensey Place and Park to the coast, a matter of
  twelve miles as the crow flies, Sir Giles,&mdash;and including three manors
  and a score of little villages. Will not these content you? Methinks they
  should. I' faith, my worthy partner, when I come to reckon up all your
  possessions, your houses and lands, and your different sources of
  revenue&mdash;the sums owing to you in bond and mortgage&mdash;your
  monopolies and your patents&mdash;when I reckon up all these, I say, and add
  thereunto the wealth hoarded in this cabinet, which you have not placed out
  at usance&mdash;I do not hesitate to set you down as one of the richest of my
  acquaintance. There be few whose revenue is so large as yours, Sir Giles.
  'Tis strange, though I have had the same chance as yourself of making money,
  I have not a hundredth part of your wealth."</p>

  <p>"Not a whit strange," replied Sir Giles, laying down the deed and
  regarding his partner somewhat contemptuously. "I waste not what I acquire. I
  have passions as well as yourself, Sir Francis; but I keep them under
  subjection. I drink not&mdash;I riot not&mdash;I shun all idle company. I
  care not for outward show, or for the vanities of dress. I have only one
  passion which I indulge,&mdash;Revenge. You are a slave to sensuality, and
  pamper your lusts at any cost. Let a fair woman please your eye, and she must
  be bought, be the price what it may. No court prodigal was ever more
  licentious or extravagant than you are."</p>

  <p>"Sir Giles! Sir Giles! I pray you, spare me. My enemies could not report
  worse of me."</p>

  <p>"Nay, your enemies would say that your extravagance is your sole merit,
  and that therein you are better than I," rejoined Sir Giles, with a sardonic
  laugh. "But I rejoice to think I am free from all such weaknesses. The
  veriest enchantress could not tempt me. I am proof against all female
  seductions. Think you the damsel lives who could induce me to give for her
  half these broad lands in Norfolk&mdash;this ancient hall, and its
  wide-spread domains? I trow not."</p>

  <p>"Perchance I have given too much," cried the old usurer, eagerly; "if so,
  it is not too late to amend our contract. Between us, there should be fair
  dealing, Sir Giles."</p>

  <p>"There is none other than fair dealing on my part," replied the
  extortioner sternly; "and the terms of our agreement cannot be departed from.
  What I have just said applies to your general mode of life; but you have
  better reason for your conduct in this instance than is usual with you, since
  you combine the gratification of revenge with the indulgence of your other
  passions. You obtain a fair young bride, and at the same time deprive the
  person whom you hate most of all others, of the mistress of his affections.
  This is as it should be. Vengeance cannot be too dearly purchased, and the
  more refined the vengeance, the higher must necessarily be the price paid for
  it. In no way can you so cruelly injure this detested Mounchensey, as by
  robbing him of his mistress. And the blow dealt by you, shall be followed by
  others not less severe on my part."</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay, Sir Giles, you have to wipe out the outrage he inflicted upon you
  in the tilt-yard. As I am a true gentleman, that was worse than the indignity
  I endured from him in the court-yard of the palace. It must be confessed that
  the villain hath a powerful hand as well as a sharp tongue, and follows up
  his bitter words by bold deeds. The stroke he dealt you with his sword was
  like a blow from a sledge hammer, Sir Giles. He felled you from your horse as
  a butcher felleth an ox; and, in good truth, I at first thought the ox's fate
  had been yours, and that you would never rise again. Your helmet was dinted
  in as if by a great shot. And for twelve hours and upwards you were senseless
  and speechless;&mdash;But thanks to my care and the skill of Luke Hatton the
  apothecary who tended you, you have been brought round. After such treatment,
  I cannot wonder that you are eager for revenge upon Sir Jocelyn. How will you
  deal with him Sir Giles? How will you deal with him?"</p>

  <p>"I will hurl him from the proud position he now holds," replied the other,
  "and immure him in the Fleet."</p>

  <p>"While I revel in the bliss he panted to enjoy," cried the old usurer,
  chuckling. "Take it altogether, 'tis the sweetest scheme we ever planned, and
  the most promising, Sir Giles! But when am I to claim Aveline? when shall I
  make her mine?"</p>

  <p>"You shall claim her to-morrow, and wed her as soon after as you
  list."</p>

  <p>"Nay, there shall be no delay on my part, Sir Giles. I am all impatience.
  When such a dainty repast is spread out before me, I am not likely to be a
  laggard. But now, to the all-important point on which the whole affair
  hinges! How am I to assert my claim to her hand&mdash;how enforce it when
  made? Explain that to me, Sir Giles, I beseech you."</p>

  <p>"Readily," replied the extortioner. "But before doing so let me give you a
  piece of information which will surprise you, and which will show you that my
  tenure of this great Norfolk property is not quite so secure as you suppose
  it. You are aware that Sir Ferdinando Mounchensey had a younger brother,
  Osmond&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who disappeared when very young, and died, it was concluded," interrupted
  Sir Francis, "for he was never heard of more. And it was lucky for us he did
  so die, or he might have proved a serious obstacle to our seizure of these
  estates, for I remember it being stated at the time, by one of the judges,
  that had he been living, he might have procured a reversal of the
  Star-Chamber sentence upon Sir Ferdinando in his favour."</p>

  <p>"Precisely so, and that judge's opinion was correct," said Sir Giles. "Now
  listen to me, Sir Francis. It is quite true that Osmond Mounchensey quitted
  his home when very young, owing to some family quarrel; but it is not true
  that he died. On the contrary, I have recently ascertained, beyond a doubt,
  that he is still alive. Hitherto, I have failed in tracing him out, though I
  have got a clue to him; but he has enveloped himself in so much mystery that
  he is difficult of detection. Yet I trust to succeed ere long; and my great
  business will be to prevent his re-appearance, which would be fraught with
  danger to us both. I have a scheme on foot in reference to him which will
  answer more than one purpose. You will learn it anon. And now, to give you
  the explanation you require in respect to Aveline."</p>

  <p>And he stamped upon the floor.</p>

  <p>"You are not about to invoke a spirit of darkness to our councils?" said
  Sir Francis, staring at him in astonishment and alarm.</p>

  <p>"You will see," rejoined the extortioner with a grim smile.</p>

  <p>After a brief pause, the door was almost noiselessly opened, and Clement
  Lanyere entered the chamber.</p>

  <p>"What has Lanyere to do with the matter?" cried Sir Francis, suspiciously
  regarding the promoter, who was without his mask.</p>

  <p>"You will hear," replied Sir Giles. "Be pleased to inform Sir Francis,
  good Lanyere, how you come to be in a position to demand the hand of fair
  Mistress Aveline Calveley?"</p>

  <p>"He demand it! I understand you not, Sir Giles!" exclaimed the old
  usurer.</p>

  <p>"Let him speak, I pray you, Sir Francis," returned the other. "You will
  the sooner learn what you desire to know."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-15"
     name="ch2-15">CHAPTER XV.<br>
  Clement Lanyere's Story.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"My tale shall be briefly told," said Lanyere. "You are
  aware, Sir Francis, that in the pursuit of my avocation I am often led into
  the most dangerous quarters of the metropolis, and at hours when the peril to
  any honest man is doubled. Adventures have not unfrequently occurred to me
  when so circumstanced, and I have been indebted to my right hand and my good
  sword for deliverance from many a desperate risk. Late one night, I chanced
  to be in the neighbourhood of Whitefriars, in a place called the Wilderness,
  when, hearing cries for help, accompanied by the clash of steel, I rushed
  towards a narrow court, whence the clatter and vociferations resounded, and
  perceived by the light of the moon, which fortunately happened to be shining
  brightly at the time, one man engaged with four others, who were evidently
  bent upon cutting his throat in order to take his purse. He defended himself
  gallantly, but the odds were too great, and he must have been speedily
  slain&mdash;for the villains swore with great oaths they would murder him if
  he continued to resist them&mdash;if I had not come to the rescue. I arrived
  just in time. They were pressing him hard. I struck down the point of a
  rapier which was within an inch of his breast&mdash;gave the swashbuckler who
  carried it a riposta he did not expect, and sent him off bowling&mdash;and
  then addressed myself to the others with such good effect, that in a brief
  space the stranger and I were alone together. I had been slightly wounded in
  the fray; but I thought nothing of it&mdash;a mere scratch. It seemed
  something more to the gentleman I had preserved. He expressed great concern
  for me, and bound his handkerchief round my arm. I was about to depart, but
  he detained me to renew his professions of gratitude for the service I had
  rendered him, and his earnest wish that he might be able to requite me. From
  his discourse, and from the texts of Scripture he mixed up with it, I knew
  him to be a Puritan; and I might have supposed him to be a preacher of the
  Gospel, had he not carried a sword, and borne himself so manfully in the
  encounter. However, he left me no doubt on the subject, for he told me he was
  named Hugh Calveley, and that he had served in the wars with more honour to
  himself than profit. He added, that if the knaves had succeeded in their
  design, and robbed and slain him, they would have deprived his daughter of
  her sole protector; and, indeed, of all means of subsistence, since the
  little they had would be lost with him. On hearing this, a thought struck me,
  and I said to him&mdash;'You have expressed an earnest desire to requite the
  service I have just been fortunate enough to render you, and as I am well
  assured your professions are not idly made, I shall not hesitate to proffer a
  request to you.' 'Ask what you will; if I have it to give, it shall be
  yours,' he replied. 'You make that promise solemnly, and before heaven?' I
  said. 'I make it solemnly,' he replied. 'And to prove to you that I mean it
  to be binding upon me, I will confirm it by an oath upon the Bible.' And as
  he spoke he took the sacred volume from his doublet, and reverently kissed
  it. Then I said to him&mdash;'Sir, you have told me you have a daughter, but
  you have not told me whether she is marriageable or not?' He started at the
  question, and answered somewhat sternly. 'My daughter has arrived at
  womanhood. But wherefore the inquiry? Do you seek her hand in marriage?' 'If
  I did so, would you refuse her to me?' A pause ensued, during which I
  observed he was struggling with deep emotion, but he replied at last, 'I
  could not do so after my solemn promise to you; but I pray you not to make
  the demand.' I then said to him: 'Sir, you cannot lay any restrictions upon
  me. I shall exact fulfilment of your promise. Your daughter must be mine.'
  Again he seemed to be torn by emotion, and to meditate a refusal; but after a
  while he suppressed his feelings, and replied. 'My word is plighted. She
  shall be yours.&mdash;Ay, though it cost me my life, she shall be yours.' He
  then inquired my name and station, and I gave him a different name from that
  by which I am known; in fact, I adopted one which chanced to be familiar to
  him, and which instantly changed his feelings towards me into those of
  warmest friendship. As you may well suppose, I did not think fit to reveal my
  odious profession, and though I was unmasked, I contrived so to muffle my
  hateful visage with my cloak, that it was in a great degree concealed from
  him. After this, I told him that I had no intention of pressing my demand
  immediately; that I would take my own means of seeing his daughter without
  her being conscious of my presence; and that I would not intrude upon her in
  any way without his sanction. I used some other arguments, which seemed
  perfectly to satisfy him, and we separated, he having previously acquainted
  me that he lived at Tottenham. Not many days elapsed before I found an
  opportunity of viewing his daughter, and I found her exquisitely beautiful. I
  had indeed gained a prize; and I resolved that no entreaties on his part, or
  on hers, should induce me to abandon my claim. I took care not to be seen by
  her, being sensible that any impression I might make would be prejudicial to
  me; and I subsequently learnt from her father that he had not disclosed to
  her the promise he had been rash enough to make to me. I had an interview
  with him&mdash;the third and last that ever took place between us&mdash;on
  the morning of the day on which he made an attempt upon the life of the King.
  I rode over to Tottenham, and arrived there before daybreak. My coming was
  expected, and he himself admitted me by a private door into his garden, and
  thence into the house. I perceived that his mind was much disturbed, and he
  told me he had passed the whole night in prayer. Without acquainting me with
  his desperate design, I gathered from what he said, that he meditated some
  fearful act, and that he considered his own life in great jeopardy. If he
  fell, and he anticipated he should fall, he committed his daughter to my
  care; and he gave me a written injunction, wherein, as you will find, his
  blessing is bestowed upon her for obedience to him, and his curse laid upon
  her in the event of a breach of duty; commanding her, by all her hopes of
  happiness hereafter, to fulfil the solemn promise he had made
  me&mdash;provided I should claim her hand within a twelvemonth of his death.
  The unfortunate man, as you know, died within two days of that interview,
  having, as I have since ascertained, reiterated the same solemn charge, and
  in terms equally impressive, to his daughter."</p>

  <p>"A strange story truly," observed Sir Francis, who had listened
  attentively to the relation; "but though Aveline may consent to be bound by
  her father's promise to you, I see not how Lean enforce the claim."</p>

  <p>"Hugh Calveley, when dying, disclosed no name to his daughter," said Sir
  Giles. "There is no name mentioned in the paper confided by him to Lanyere;
  and, possessed of that authority, you will represent the party entitled to
  make the claim, and can act as Lanyere would have acted."</p>

  <p>"She will not resist the demand," said the promoter. "That I can avouch,
  for I overheard her declare as much to Sir Jocelyn."</p>

  <p>"If such be the case, I am content," cried the old usurer. "Give me the
  authority," he added to Lanyere.</p>

  <p>"I have it with me, Sir Francis," rejoined the promoter; "but Sir Giles
  will explain to you that there is something to be done before I can yield it
  to you."</p>

  <p>"What does he require?" asked the old usurer, glancing uneasily at his
  partner.</p>

  <p>"Merely all these title-deeds of the Mounchensey estates in exchange for
  that paper," replied Sir Giles.</p>

  <p>"Not merely the deeds," said Lanyere; "but an assignment on your part, Sir
  Giles, and on yours, Sir Francis, of all your joint interest in those
  estates. I must have them absolutely secured to me; and stand precisely as
  you stand towards them."</p>

  <p>"You shall have all you require," replied Mompesson.</p>

  <p>"Amazement!" exclaimed Sir Francis. "Can you really mean to relinquish
  this noble property to him, Sir Giles? I thought I was assigning my share to
  you, and little dreamed that the whole estates would be made over in this
  way."</p>

  <p>"I have told you, Sir Francis," rejoined the other, "that
  vengeance&mdash;ample, refined vengeance&mdash;cannot be too dearly
  purchased; and you will now perceive that I am willing to pay as
  extravagantly as yourself for the gratification of a whim. On no other terms
  than these would Lanyere consent to part with the authority he possesses,
  which while it will ensure you the hand of Aveline, will ensure me the
  keenest revenge upon Sir Jocelyn. I have therefore acceded to his terms. Thou
  hast got a rare bargain, Lanyere; and when the crack-brained Puritan gave
  thee that paper, he little knew the boon he bestowed upon thee."</p>

  <p>"The exchange would, indeed, seem to be in my favour, Sir Giles," he said;
  "but you may believe me when I say, that though I gain these large estates, I
  would rather have had the damsel."</p>

  <p>"Well, let the business be completed," said Sir Giles; "and that it may be
  so with all dispatch, do you, Lanyere, summon Lupo Vulp to us. You will find
  him in his chamber, and bid him bring with him the deed of assignment to you
  of the Mounchensey estates which he has already prepared, and which only
  requires my signature and that of Sir Francis."</p>

  <p>"I obey you, Sir Giles," replied Lanyere, departing on the errand.</p>

  <p>As soon as they were alone, the old usurer observed to his
  partner&mdash;"I am lost in astonishment at what you are about to do, Sir
  Giles. That I should make a sacrifice for a dainty damsel, whose charms are
  doubled because she should belong to an enemy, is not surprising; but that
  you should give up so easily a property you have so long coveted&mdash;I
  confess I cannot understand it."</p>

  <p>A strange smile crossed the extortioner's countenance.</p>

  <p>"And do you really think I would give it up thus, Sir Francis?" he
  said.</p>

  <p>"But if we sign that deed&mdash;'tis his. How are you to get it back
  again?"</p>

  <p>"Ask me not <i>how</i>&mdash;I have no time for explanation. Recollect
  what I told you of Osmond Mounchensey, and the possibility of his
  re-appearance."</p>

  <p>"I will not seek to penetrate your scheme, Sir Giles," observed the old
  usurer; "but I would have you beware of Lanyere. He is cunning and
  determined."</p>

  <p>"He will scarcely prove a match for me, I think," observed the
  extortioner&mdash;"but here he comes."</p>

  <p>And as he spoke, the promoter again entered the chamber, followed by Lupo
  Vulp, with a parchment under his arm.</p>

  <p>"Give me the deed, good Lupo," said Sir Giles, taking it from him. "It
  must be first executed by me&mdash;there!&mdash;and now your signature, Sir
  Francis," he added, passing the instrument to him. "Now thou shalt witness
  it, Lupo. 'Tis well!&mdash;'tis well!" he cried, snatching it back again, as
  soon as the scrivener had finished the attestation. "All is done in due form.
  This deed makes you Lord of Mounchensey, Lanyere." And he handed it to
  him.</p>

  <p>"And this makes Sir Francis Mitchell ruler of the destiny of Aveline
  Calveley," rejoined Lanyere, giving a paper to the old usurer.</p>

  <p>"This chest and its contents are yours also, Lanyere," pursued Sir Giles,
  putting in the deeds, and locking it. "Will it please you to take the key.
  From this moment we cease to be master and servant, and become equals and
  friends!"</p>

  <p>"Equals, it may be, Sir Giles!" cried Lanyere, drawing himself up to his
  full height, and speaking with great haughtiness; "but never friends."</p>

  <p>"Ha! what are we, then?" demanded the extortioner, fiercely. "Am I
  mistaken in you? Take heed. You are yet in my power."</p>

  <p>"Not so, Sir Giles. I have nothing to apprehend from you now," replied
  Lanyere; "but you have much to fear from me."</p>

  <p>So saying, and placing the parchment within his doublet, he hastily
  quitted the chamber.</p>

  <p>"Perdition! have I been outwitted?" cried Sir Giles. "But he shall not
  escape me." And rushing after him, he called from the head of the great
  staircase&mdash;"What, ho! Captain Bludder!&mdash;and ye, Tom Wootton and
  Cutting Dick&mdash;let not Lanyere go forth. Stay him and take from him the
  deed which he hath placed in his doublet. Cut him down, or stab him if he
  resists."</p>

  <p>But, though efforts were made to obey Sir Giles's commands, the promoter
  effected his retreat.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-16"
     name="ch2-16">CHAPTER XVI.<br>
  Sir Jocelyn's Rupture with de Gondomar.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Far and wide echoed the report of Sir Jocelyn's brilliant
  achievements at the jousts; and wherever he went, he was hailed as vanquisher
  of the hitherto-unconquered Buckingham. He bore his honours meekly, yet he
  did not escape calumny; for at a court, as everywhere else, distinguished
  success is certain to awaken a spirit of envy and detraction. These paltry
  feelings, however, were entirely confined to the disappointed of his own sex.
  By fairer and more impartial judges, who had witnessed his exploits, he was
  spoken of in terms of unmingled admiration; and at the grand revel at
  Whitehall that followed the jousts, many a soft glance told him how tenderly
  the gentle heart, whose feelings it betrayed, was inclined towards him.
  Faithful, loyal, and chivalrous, our young knight was as much proof against
  these lures, as against the ruder attacks of his armed opponents in the
  lists; and his constancy to the lady of his love remained entirely unshaken.
  Far rather would he have been with Aveline, in her humble dwelling, than in
  those superb festal halls, surrounded by all that was noble and
  beautiful&mdash;all that was dangerous and delusive. Far rather would he have
  received one smile from her, one kindly look, than all the blandishments
  showered upon him by these enchantresses.</p>

  <p>Fain would he have avoided the banquet&mdash;but as the hero of the day,
  he was compelled to attend it. Indeed, he had to enact a principal part at
  the revel; and so well did he play it that compliments were lavished upon
  him, enough to have turned an ordinary head. Not from any desire for
  ostentatious display, but because Prince Charles had signified to him his
  wishes on the subject, he was arrayed in all the pearls and ornaments he had
  won from Buckingham; and more than one subtle courtier, anxious to stand well
  with him, flatteringly declared that they became him infinitely better than
  the Marquis. Others, less favourably disposed, remarked that his gem-bedecked
  doublet was like the garment of Nessus, and would cause its wearer's
  destruction; and if they could have read Buckingham's secret thoughts, when
  he beheld his rival so adorned, they would have felt that the observation was
  not unwarranted. But, though fully determined upon revenge, Buckingham
  allowed neither look nor word to betray his purpose. On the contrary, he
  displayed more than his usual affability to Mounchensey, laughed at his own
  ill-luck, and even went so far as to say that Sir Giles Mompesson had been
  rightly served; adding, that he blamed himself for including him in his
  party, and was glad Sir Jocelyn had handled him so rudely.</p>

  <p>Though our young knight might well doubt Buckingham's sincerity; he
  replied to all his courtly speeches in similar terms, and the greatest
  cordiality appeared to subsist between them. Enchanted with this show of
  friendship, the King endeavoured to promote it by keeping them near him
  throughout the evening, leading them to converse together, and fawning upon
  them, as was his way with those he highly favoured. All this could not fail
  to be satisfactory to Mounchensey; but he was far more pleased with the
  notice of Prince Charles, who treated him with marked consideration.</p>

  <p>Next morning, in compliance with an invitation to that effect he had
  received at the revel, Sir Jocelyn repaired to Ely House, in Holborn, the
  residence of the Spanish Ambassador, and was at once admitted to his
  presence.</p>

  <p>They were alone, and after a few preliminary observations upon the events
  of the previous day, De Gondomar remarked&mdash;"I think I have already
  afforded you abundant proof of my friendly feeling towards you, Sir Jocelyn.
  But I will not stop with what I have done. My power of serving you is greater
  than you may imagine it to be. I can lead you yet higher&mdash;and put you in
  a firmer position. In a word, I can place you on a level with
  Buckingham,&mdash;perchance above him,&mdash;if your ambition soars so
  high."</p>

  <p>Mounchensey endeavoured to express his deep sense of gratitude to the
  ambassador, and regretted his small means of requiting the numerous and
  important favours he had received from him.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you what to do," said De Gondomar. "You can procure me
  certain information which I desire to obtain. By my instrumentality you have,
  in some degree, already obtained the King's confidence, and ere long are sure
  to become the depositary of many important state secrets. These you shall
  communicate to me. And you must also use your best endeavours to win Prince
  Charles over to the Church of Rome."</p>

  <p>"Is this proposal seriously made to me, Count?" demanded Mounchensey,
  looking at him with astonishment, mingled with displeasure.</p>

  <p>"Unquestionably it is serious&mdash;perfectly serious," replied De
  Gondomar. "I ask you only to serve me as a certain young nobleman of your
  acquaintance served me before he was compelled to fly from England to avoid
  the consequences of a quarrel with his wife's family. Your opportunities will
  be greater than his, and therefore your service will be more valuable."</p>

  <p>"I regret that such disloyalty should be laid to the charge of any English
  noble," said Sir Jocelyn sternly. "But think not, because Lord Roos played
  the spy and traitor, as your Excellency insinuates he did, that I will be
  guilty of like baseness. Up to this moment I have felt nothing but gratitude
  to you for the favours you have heaped upon me; but the feeling is changed to
  resentment when I understand they are to be purchased at the price of my
  honour. I cannot accede to your wishes, Count. You must seek out some other
  tool. I can be none in your hands."</p>

  <p>"If this be real, and not affected indignation, Sir Jocelyn," said De
  Gondomar coldly, "it would seem that I have been altogether mistaken in you,
  and that I have been helping you up the ladder only to be kicked aside when
  you have gained a secure footing. But you have not reached the last step yet,
  and never will, unless I find you more reasonable. And allow me to ask you,
  if you are as scrupulous as you profess to be, how you came to bring a token
  to me from a hired spy&mdash;a token intended to let me know you were willing
  to undertake any secret service I might choose to confide to you? Have you
  changed your mind since then? or rather, do you not fancy yourself out of
  danger, and able to dispense with my assistance?"</p>

  <p>"I have ever been of the same opinion, Count; have ever been influenced by
  the same feelings of loyalty and devotion to my sovereign, and of detestation
  of all treasonable practices. Had I been aware of the import of the ring I
  showed your Excellency on our first meeting, I would have hacked off my
  finger rather than have displayed it. Neither did I know the character of the
  man who confided it to me; though I ought to have distrusted him. He has
  played us both false, and for what end I cannot divine."</p>

  <p>"I will solve the riddle for you, Sir: he thought to serve you," said De
  Gondomar; "and he has done so, and most effectually, though you are now
  unwilling to admit it. I have good reason to complain of him&mdash;you have
  none."</p>

  <p>"I have more reason for complaint than your Excellency," rejoined
  Mounchensey. "He has placed me in a most painful and perplexing
  position."</p>

  <p>"There you are right, Sir," said De Gondomar. "No matter how arrived at,
  you are in a position from which you cannot extricate yourself with honour.
  However disinclined you may be to act in concert with me, you have no other
  alternative. If I withdraw my support from you, your fall is inevitable.
  Think not I talk lightly. You are surrounded by enemies, though you discern
  them not. Buckingham's magnanimous conduct at the revel last night was
  feigned to mask his purposes towards you. He has not forgiven his defeat, and
  means to avenge it. You fancy yourself on the high road to preferment; but
  you are on the verge of disgrace and ruin. I alone can save you. Choose,
  then, between compliance with my wishes, coupled with present protection and
  future advancement, and the consequences certain to attend your refusal.
  Choose, I say, between my friendship and my enmity."</p>

  <p>"My answer shall be as prompt and decisive as your proposal, Count,"
  replied Sir Jocelyn. "I at once reject a friendship fettered with such
  conditions. And that I do not resent the affront put upon me in your
  dishonourable proposal, must be set down to the obligations you have imposed
  upon me, and which tie up my hands. But we are now quits; and if any further
  indignity be offered me, it will not be so lightly borne."</p>

  <p>"<i>Perdone, vuestra merced</i>!&mdash;we are not quits," cried De
  Gondomar quickly. "The account between us is far from settled; nor will I
  rest content till you have paid me in full. But we had better break off this
  interview," he added, more calmly, "since no good is like to result from it.
  It is useless to reason with you; but you are wantonly throwing away a fairer
  opportunity than falls to the lot of most men, and will see your folly when
  too late."</p>

  <p>"In taking my leave of your Excellency, as there are no terms henceforth
  to be observed between us, except those of hostility, I deem it right to
  state, that though I shall make no especial reference to yourself, I shall
  hold it my duty to acquaint his Majesty with the system of <i>espionage</i>
  introduced into the palace; and, above all, I shall take care to guard the
  Prince against the insidious snares laid for him."</p>

  <p>"It is a pity so faithful a councillor as yourself should not be listened
  to," rejoined De Gondomar. "Yet, when I shut the doors of the palace against
  you&mdash;as I will do&mdash;you will find it difficult to obtain a hearing
  either from Prince or King. In spite of all your efforts to the contrary, I
  shall learn any state secrets I desire to know, and I have great hopes of
  winning over Charles Stuart to the faith for which his lovely and martyred
  ancestress died. One more word at parting, Sir Jocelyn. You will remember,
  when we first met, you were in danger from the Star-Chamber. It would be
  useless now to say how I saved you from the punishment your rashness had
  incurred&mdash;how, while aiding you with the King, I kept aloof your
  enemies, Mompesson and Mitchell, who were prepared to attach your person for
  contempt of that terrible court, and would have done so, if I had not
  prevented them. The warrant for your arrest still exists, and can be employed
  at any moment; so you will consider how long you can count upon your freedom,
  now that you have no strong arm to protect you."</p>

  <p>"I have my own arm to trust to," rejoined Sir Jocelyn, resolutely, "and
  have no apprehensions."</p>

  <p><i>"Vaya usted con dios!"</i> said the Spaniard, bowing him out; "or I
  should rather say," he added to himself, "<i>Vaya mucho en mala
  hora</i>!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-17"
     name="ch2-17">CHAPTER XVII.<br>
  Disgrace.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Sir Jocelyn was not without great uneasiness at the result
  of his interview with De Gondomar. Had it been possible, he would have
  avoided a rupture with so influential a personage&mdash;an event to be
  dreaded at any time, but especially so at a juncture like the present, when
  dangers menaced him on all sides, and the only question appeared to be, from
  what side the first blow would come. His chief anxiety, however, was for
  Aveline, whose position was one of such strange and imminent peril, against
  which he knew not how to guard her. He was still left in the same state of
  uncertainty as to who would be the claimant of her hand; for the mysterious
  personage in the mask had not appeared again, according to his promise, after
  the jousts. This suspense was terrible, and Sir Jocelyn found it so difficult
  of endurance, that he would have preferred the actual presence of the
  calamity by which he was threatened. His fears were, that the claim he so
  much dreaded would be made by Sir Giles Mompesson in person, and in that case
  he had determined forcibly to resist him. And this supposition might account
  for the delay&mdash;since he knew that Sir Giles was suffering severely from
  the effects of the blow he had dealt him in the tilt-yard.</p>

  <p>De Gondomar's were not idle threats, as Sir Jocelyn soon found. On the
  next day, as he entered the palace, he was informed by the Lord Chamberlain
  that he was deprived of his office of Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber; and when
  he demanded the reason of his sudden dismissal, the Duke of Lennox, with a
  shrug of the shoulders, declared he was unable to afford him any information.
  But what the Duke refused was afforded by De Gondomar, who at that moment
  entered the corridor, in company with Buckingham and some other nobles, on
  his way to the presence-chamber. On seeing his late <i>protégé</i>, the
  ambassador halted for a moment, and with a smile of triumph said&mdash;"You
  owe your dismissal to me, Sir Jocelyn. I have made some few circumstances
  concerning you that had just come to my ears known to his Majesty; and as he
  does not choose to have spies about his person, he has released you from all
  further attendance upon him."</p>

  <p>"In a word, he has forbidden your attendance again at the palace," added
  Buckingham, who had paused likewise, with an insulting laugh.</p>

  <p>"I must to the King, your Grace," cried Sir Jocelyn to the Lord
  Chamberlain. "I will explain the falsehood of this charge to his Majesty, and
  show him who is the spy and traitor he has to fear."</p>

  <p>"You cannot pass, Sir Jocelyn," said the Duke of Lennox, placing himself
  in his way, while two halberdiers advanced to bar his passage with their
  partizans. "I say not a word as to the cause of your disgrace; but I may tell
  you, that his Majesty is greatly offended with you, and that it would be
  highly imprudent to approach him in his present frame of mind, even were it
  permitted you to do so&mdash;which it is not. As I have said, you are
  deprived of your office, and enjoined to absent yourself from the palace,
  till it shall be his Majesty's pleasure to recall you."</p>

  <p>"And that is not likely to be soon the case&mdash;eh, Count?" observed
  Buckingham, with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Not very likely indeed, Marquis," said the ambassador. "I much regret
  that I have been the means of introducing so unworthy a person to his
  Majesty; but I have made all the amends in my power."</p>

  <p>"Must I tamely endure all these insults and calumnies, your Grace?" cried
  Sir Jocelyn furiously.</p>

  <p>"If you will be guided by me, you will retire," rejoined the Duke of
  Lennox; "or the provocation you will receive may induce you to do some
  desperate act which may render your position worse, and put your restoration
  to the King's favour entirely out of the question."</p>

  <p>While Sir Jocelyn was debating whether he should comply with the Duke's
  advice, the door of the presence-chamber was thrown open; and James, coming
  forth from it, marched slowly along the corridor.</p>

  <p>Our young knight now fondly hoped that the King might deign to look upon
  him, and so enable him to plead his cause; and perhaps the Lord Chamberlain
  himself entertained similar expectations, for he did not insist upon Sir
  Jocelyn's withdrawal, but allowed him to remain within the corridor, though
  he was kept aloof by the halberdiers. But both were disappointed. James, no
  doubt, designedly, bestowed his most gracious marks of condescension on
  Buckingham and De Gondomar, and lingered for a few minutes to laugh and talk
  with them. After this, as he was passing Sir Jocelyn, he pretended to notice
  him for the first time, and observed, in a tone of reproof to the Lord
  Chamberlain, "What doth the spy here, my Lord Duke? I thought you had our
  orders concerning him. See they are better obeyed in future." And, when the
  young knight would have spoken, he interrupted him by an imperious gesture,
  crying out, "Not a word, Sir!&mdash;not a word! We will hear naught mair frae
  ye. We hae heard ower meikle already." And he passed on.</p>

  <p>Thus was Mounchensey's disgrace accomplished by his enemies.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-18"
     name="ch2-18">CHAPTER XVIII.<br>
  How Sir Jocelyn's cause was espoused by the 'prentices.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Stung almost to madness by the sense of intolerable wrong,
  our young knight quitted Whitehall, never, as he imagined at the moment, to
  enter the palace again. Yet he was not humiliated by his disgrace, because he
  felt it to be wholly unmerited. His enemies had triumphed over him; but he
  would not have heeded the defeat, provided he could efface the foul stigma
  cast upon his reputation, and rebut the false charge brought against him by
  De Gondomar.</p>

  <p>With a heart overflowing with rage and bitterness, and with a thousand
  wild projects passing through his brain, Sir Jocelyn took a boat at Whitehall
  stairs, and ordered the watermen to row down the river, without assigning any
  paticular place of landing. After awhile, he succeeded, to a certain extent,
  in controlling his angry emotions; and as the watermen rested on their oars
  for a moment, to inquire his destination, he looked round, and perceiving he
  was just opposite the Three Cranes in the Vintry, he desired to be put ashore
  there.</p>

  <p>No better retreat wherein to recover his composure seemed to offer itself
  than Madame Bonaventure's comfortable house of entertainment; and thither,
  therefore, he proceeded, and at his request was shown into a private room
  overlooking the river. Scarcely was he installed within it, than the buxom
  hostess, who had caught sight of him as he mounted the stairs, entered, and
  in her blandest accents, and with her most bewitching smiles, begged to know
  his commands; declaring that all that her house possessed was at his
  service.</p>

  <p>She was running on thus, but perceiving the young knight to be much
  disturbed, she instantly changed her tone, and expressed such genuine concern
  for him, that he could not fail to be moved by it. Without making her an
  entire confidante, Sir Jocelyn told her enough of what had occurred to make
  her comprehend his position; and highly indignant she was at the treatment he
  had experienced. She did her best to console him; and so far succeeded, that
  he was prevailed upon to partake of some delicacies which she caused Cyprien
  to set before him, together with a flask of the best vintage in her cellar;
  and the discussion of these good things, coupled with the hostess's
  assiduities, certainly operated as a balm upon his wounded feelings.</p>

  <p>The repast over, the good-natured dame thought it best to leave him to
  himself; and drawing his chair to the open window, he began to ruminate upon
  the many strange events that had happened to him since he first beheld that
  fair prospect almost from the same place; and he was indulging in this
  retrospect, when his own name, pronounced in tones familiar to him, caught
  his ear, and looking forth, he perceived Dick Taverner, seated on a bench in
  front of the house, drinking in company with some half dozen other
  apprentices, his boon companions.</p>

  <p>The conversation of these roysterers was held in so loud a key that it
  could not fail to reach his ears; and he soon ascertained that his own
  dismissal from court was the theme of their discourse, and that they rightly
  attributed it&mdash;doubtless owing to information derived from their
  hostess&mdash;to the instrumentality of De Gondomar. It was evidently Dick
  Taverner's design to rouse the indignation of his companions; and he had
  little difficulty in accomplishing his purpose, as they were all composed of
  very inflammable material, and prone to take fire on the slightest
  application of the match. Dick denounced the plotting and perfidious Spaniard
  as a traitor to the King and a subverter of the Protestant faith; and
  counselled vengeance upon him.</p>

  <p>Finding Dick's suggestions eagerly caught up by his companions, and that
  the number of his listeners was momently increasing, while all were becoming
  excited by what the orator uttered, Sir Jocelyn, apprehensive that mischief
  might ensue, thought it right to interfere, and accordingly, leaning forward
  from the casement, he made himself known to the group below.</p>

  <p>On seeing him, and learning who he was, the 'prentices began to shout and
  declaim vehemently against the Spanish ambassador; and instigated by Dick
  Taverner, who refused to listen either to the entreaties or commands of the
  young knight, the whole party seized their cudgels, and dispersing themselves
  in different directions, vociferated as they went&mdash;"Clubs! clubs!"</p>

  <p>It was now as vain to arrest them as it would have been to stop the course
  of a conflagration; and Sir Jocelyn was deploring the damage which must
  necessarily be done to his cause by these injudicious friends, when Dick
  Taverner, with a look of exultation, and brandishing his cudgel, burst into
  the room, crying&mdash;"We have heard all from Madame Bonaventure. We have
  heard of De Gondomar's perfidy, and his Majesty's injustice. We will set you
  right. The bold London 'prentices have taken your cause in hand, and will
  avenge you. They will hang the treacherous Spaniard, and burn his house."</p>

  <p>"Hark ye, my good friend, Dick Taverner," said Sir Jocelyn, "this must not
  be. Because I have been unjustly treated, and may perchance find it
  difficult, if not impossible, to obtain redress, it does not follow that you
  and your fellow 'prentices are to violate the law. These riotous proceedings
  will prejudice my cause rather than aid it; and if you have any regard for me
  you will use your influence with your comrades to check them ere mischief
  ensue."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Dick. "The matter has gone too far to be stopped
  now. You might as well attempt to turn back a mill-dam that has burst its
  bounds, as the headstrong London 'prentices when they have taken up their
  cudgels. Go through with the business they will. This is not the only quarrel
  we have with De Gondomar. We hate him for his insolence and arrogance, which
  have been often displayed towards us; We hate him because he is the sworn
  enemy of our religion, and would subvert it if he could. As regards myself, I
  have my own particular reasons for hating him. Do not you meddle with the
  affair, but leave its arrangement to us."</p>

  <p>"But I <i>must</i> interfere," cried Sir Jocelyn; "if you act thus, in
  spite of all my remonstrances. I must regard you in the light of enemies
  rather than friends, and shall lend my help to quell the disturbance you will
  occasion. Be ruled by me, good Dickon, and desist from it. Call in your
  comrades, who are raging about like savage dogs broken loose."</p>

  <p>"If they be dogs," rejoined Dick, with a laugh, "the Spanish ambassador is
  likely enough to become acquainted with their teeth. But I might whistle
  loudly enough to them before the staunch hounds would come back to me; and,
  in good sooth, I have no inclination to obey your commands in his instance,
  Sir Jocelyn."</p>

  <p>So saying, and fearing he might be detained altogether if he waited
  longer, he darted out of the room, and presently afterwards was heard
  shouting along the wharf with the loudest of his riotous companions&mdash;"No
  Papists! No Spanish spies! Clubs!&mdash;clubs!"</p>

  <p>Sir Jocelyn saw that a storm was roused which it would be very difficult
  to allay; but an effort must be made to do so, even if he were compelled to
  act against his friends; and he was about to follow the apprentice into the
  street, when he was prevented by the sudden entrance of a tall personage,
  wrapped in a black cloak, and masked, whom he at once recognised as the
  individual who had given him the token to De Gondomar.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to have found you, Sir Jocelyn," said this personage. "I have
  been on the look-out for you to give you a warning. Avoid any place you have
  been in the habit of frequenting; and, above all, go not near Aveline's
  dwelling. The officers of the Star-Chamber are on the watch for you; and if
  found, your arrest is certain."</p>

  <p>"I can place little reliance on aught you tell me, Sir," rejoined Sir
  Jocelyn, "after the trick you played me in causing me to deliver that ring to
  the Conde de Gondomar. Nothing you can say shall hinder me from going forth
  as I am accustomed to do; and it is my purpose to proceed ere long to the
  dwelling you specially caution me to avoid."</p>

  <p>"You will repent your rashness, young Sir," said the other; "but I pray
  you not to go forth till you have heard certain disclosures which I have to
  make to you, and which I am well assured will induce you to alter your
  opinion of me."</p>

  <p>"I can put no faith in the statements of a hireling, base enough to play
  the spy for an enemy of his country," rejoined Sir Jocelyn, scornfully.
  "Stand aside, Sir. Your employer, De Gondomar, is in danger from these
  hot-headed apprentices; and if you owe him any gratitude for past favours,
  you may find occasion for its display now."</p>

  <p>"What! are you about to take part with your enemy and against your
  friends? These apprentices are about to redress your wrongs&mdash;in a
  lawless manner it is true&mdash;but the circumstances justify their
  conduct."</p>

  <p>"No circumstances can justify outrage, and violation of the law," said Sir
  Jocelyn; "and if injury be attempted against De Gondomar, I must defend
  him."</p>

  <p>"This is mere madness," cried the other. "Stay and hear what I have to say
  to you. It imports you much to know it."</p>

  <p>"Not now," replied Sir Jocelyn, pushing past him. "On some other
  occasion."</p>

  <p>"You are throwing life and liberty away, Sir Jocelyn, and to no purpose,"
  cried the other. "He heeds me not," he added, in a tone of deep
  disappointment. "Imprudent that he is! he will thwart all the plans I have
  formed for his benefit, and at the very moment they have arrived at maturity.
  I must follow and protect him."</p>

  <p>And he too rushed down the stairs, and made all the haste he could across
  the Vintry wharf after Sir Jocelyn, who was hurrying up a narrow thoroughfare
  communicating with Thames Street.</p>

  <p>Here a numerous body of 'prentices were already collected, holding a
  consultation as to their plan of attack. After listening to a brief but
  stirring harangue from Dick Taverner, who got upon a horse-block for the
  purpose of addressing them, and recommended them to proceed to Ely House, in
  Holborn, the residence of the offending Ambassador, and there await his
  return from Whitehall; they approved of his proposal, and unanimously
  electing Dick as their leader, set forth on their expedition, gathering
  strength as they went along.</p>

  <p>By the time they reached Blackfriars they numbered many hundreds. Little
  or no interruption was offered them on their route; and the slight hindrance
  they encountered from a detachment of the city-watch was speedily overborne.
  Skirting Bridewell, they traversed Shoe Lane, and ascending Holborn Hill,
  found themselves in the vicinity of Ely House, where they came to a halt, and
  arranged their forces.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-19"
     name="ch2-19">CHAPTER XIX.<br>
  A Noble Revenge.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Nothing could be pleasanter than the situation of the
  Spanish ambassador's residence, surrounded as it was by noble gardens; but
  its beauties seemed now likely to be devastated by the blind fury of the
  apprentices. Much mischief would indeed have been done in a very short time
  if it had not been for their leader. He authoritatively commanded them to
  refrain from the work of demolition till they had settled accounts with the
  ambassador himself, who might be expected each moment, as they had
  ascertained that he was on his way home from the palace. The information they
  had received proved to be correct; and ere many minutes elapsed, a
  magnificent litter, borne by eight stout varlets, and attended by several
  gentlemen and pages, in the well-known liveries of De Gondomar, was seen to
  pass through Holborn Bars and advance towards them.</p>

  <p>Very soon, however, the bearers of the litter halted, surprised and
  alarmed at the sight of the crowd investing Ely House; but De Gondomar, who
  had no apprehension, commanded them to proceed, and they reluctantly obeyed.
  The 'prentices allowed the litter to come on till they could surround it,
  when they set up a loud shout, making it evident that mischief was
  intended.</p>

  <p>On this the gentlemen and pages in attendance upon the ambassador drew
  their swords and put themselves into a posture of defence, endeavouring to
  keep off the crowd. But their resistance was of little avail. The 'prentices'
  clubs quickly shivered their weapons, and drove them back.</p>

  <p>When he became aware of the jeopardy in which he stood, De Gondomar,
  anxious to gain time, in the hope that assistance might arrive, demanded of
  the leader of the furious-looking crew who had drawn aside the curtains of
  his litter, and ordered him in insolent tones to come forth, why they
  molested him. The individual appealed to replied that, having heard of his
  infamous usage of Sir Jocelyn Mounchensey, and of the false accusation he had
  brought against him to the King, they were determined to inflict upon his
  Excellency the punishment due to public and notorious slanderers.</p>

  <p>"And by what right do you constitute yourselves my judges?" cried De
  Gondomar. "Take heed what you do&mdash;you may bring yourselves within reach
  of a halter."</p>

  <p>"You hear what he says, brother 'prentices?" cried Dick Taverner. "He
  threatens to hang us, and no doubt if he could carry out his schemes, and
  bring back the Pope's authority, he would burn us in Smithfield, as they did
  the holy martyrs in Mary's days. He has charged a true and loyal subject of
  his Majesty with being a spy. In return we tell <i>him</i>he is the worst of
  spies&mdash;a spy employed by the Pope; and we will teach him the danger of
  his employment."</p>

  <p>"Hands off, base varlets!" exclaimed De Gondomar, endeavouring to shake
  himself free from the rude grasp imposed upon him.</p>

  <p>But, in spite of his resistance, he was dragged from the litter, while a
  shower of blows from the 'prentices cudgels fell upon his shoulders; and it
  is probable he would have experienced much severer treatment, if indeed he
  had escaped with life, if at this moment Sir Jocelyn Mounchensey, sword in
  hand and followed by Clement Lanyere, had not burst through the throng.</p>

  <p>"Ha! as I suspected," cried De Gondomar. "You, Mounchensey, are the author
  and instigator of this outrage, and are come to see that your tools do their
  work properly."</p>

  <p>"It is false," cried Dick Taverner. "Your Excellency judges of others by
  yourself. Sir Jocelyn would have checked us if he could."</p>

  <p>"I cannot be expected to believe such an assertion as this," cried De
  Gondomar incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Let my actions speak for me," cried Mounchensey. "Friends," he called
  out, "it is undoubtedly true that I have good ground of complaint against the
  Conde de Gondomar&mdash;that he has deeply injured me&mdash;and that I will
  compel him to make me reparation in due season&mdash;but I cannot permit
  outrage to be offered him; and if aught further be attempted, my arm will be
  raised in his defence."</p>

  <p>"How! can this be possible!" exclaimed De Gondomar in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Why, we are fighting Sir Jocelyn's battles, and he turns round upon us!"
  cried a burly 'prentice, while loud murmurs arose from the others, and the
  cudgels were again brandished menacingly.</p>

  <p>"Leave him to us, Sir Jocelyn," said Dick Taverner.</p>

  <p>"Ay, he had better not interfere, of he will come in for his share of the
  blows," roared several voices.</p>

  <p>"I care not what befals me," shouted Mounchensey. "You shall not injure a
  hair of his Excellency's head while I stand by."</p>

  <p>And as he spoke he warded off several blows aimed at the ambassador.</p>

  <p>"I am with you, Sir Jocelyn," said Clement Lanyere, clearing a space
  around them with his long rapier, but avoiding, so far as possible, doing
  injury to the 'prentices.</p>

  <p>At this critical juncture, and when it seemed likely that, owing to his
  chivalrous interference, Sir Jocelyn would share the ambassador's fate, he
  being fairly resolved, as he showed, to defend him with his life, a cry was
  raised that a body of the royal guards were approaching; and as the trampling
  of horse, accompanied by the clatter of swords, left no doubt of the fact,
  and as, moreover, the bold 'prentices felt no disposition to encounter
  regular soldiery, they instantly abandoned their prey and took to their
  beels, the chief part of them leaping the hedge which then grew along the
  north side of Holborn, and scouring off through the fields in every
  direction. Some half dozen were made prisoners by the guard; and amongst
  these, we regret to state, was the leader of the riotous assembly, Dick
  Taverner.</p>

  <p>"Thou art likely to make acquaintance with the pillory and the cart's
  tail, if not with the hangman, friend," said the soldier who secured him,
  with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"So I begin to fear," replied Dick. "Alack! and well-a-day! what will
  become of Gillian!"</p>

  <p>"An that be thy mistress's name, friend, you should have thought of her
  before you engaged in this disturbance. You are likely now to part company
  with her for ever."</p>

  <p>While Dick lamented the predicament in which he had placed himself, the
  Conde de Gondomar, freed from all apprehension, turned towards his deliverer,
  and proffering him his hand, said&mdash;"You have nobly revenged yourself,
  Sir Jocelyn. I trust we may be friends once more. I will make you ample
  reparation for the wrong I have done you."</p>

  <p>But the young knight, folding his arms upon his breast, sternly
  replied&mdash;"When reparation is made, Count, I may accept your hand, but
  not till then."</p>

  <p>"At least enter my house," urged the ambassador, "where you will be
  protected from arrest."</p>

  <p>"Do not hesitate, Sir Jocelyn," subjoined Lanyere. "You are in great
  peril."</p>

  <p>But the young knight haughtily refused.</p>

  <p>"I will not owe an asylum to you, Count," he said, "till my name be
  cleared from reproach." And, with a proud salutation, he departed.</p>

  <p>The Spanish ambassador shrugged his shoulders, and looked after him with
  mingled admiration and contempt. He then turned to the promoter, and said,
  "Come in with me, Lanyere. I have somewhat to say to you."</p>

  <p>"I must pray your Excellency to excuse me just now," replied the other. "I
  have business on hand."</p>

  <p>And bowing with nearly as much haughtiness as Sir Jocelyn, he followed in
  the course taken by the young knight.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-20"
     name="ch2-20">CHAPTER XX.<br>
  A Place of Refuge.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">After quitting De Gondomar, as before related, Sir Jocelyn
  hurried along Holborn with the intention of proceeding to Aveline's cottage,
  which was at no great distance from Ely House, though in a secluded
  situation, withdrawn from the road; and he was just about to strike into the
  narrow lane leading to it, when he was arrested by the voice of Clement
  Lanyere, who had followed him, unobserved.</p>

  <p>"Stay, Sir Jocelyn, I beg of you," cried the promoter, coming quickly up
  to him; "you are rushing on certain destruction. You must not go nigh that
  cottage to-day; no, nor for several days to come. Foes are lying in ambush
  round it; and the only spectacle you will afford her you love will be that of
  your arrest."</p>

  <p>There was an earnestness in the speaker's manner that could not fail to
  carry conviction of his sincerity to the breast of his hearer.</p>

  <p>"By my soul, I speak the truth," said Lanyere, perceiving the impression
  he had made, "as you will find if you go many steps further. Place yourself
  in my hands, and I will save you."</p>

  <p>"What motive can you have for acting thus?" demanded Sir Jocelyn. "What
  interest do you take in me?"</p>

  <p>"Do not question me now: you shall have full explanation hereafter. Be
  satisfied I am a friend,&mdash;perchance your best friend. Come with me, and
  I will take you to a place of safety."</p>

  <p>"But what is to happen to Aveline?" cried the young knight, in deep
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>"I will endeavour to watch over her," replied the promoter; "and I trust
  no harm will befall her. At all events, you will deprive yourself of the
  power of rendering her any protection, if you are rash enough to go forward
  now."</p>

  <p>Struck by the force of these remarks, our young knight felt he had no
  alternative but to submit to circumstances, and he accordingly agreed to
  accept the aid proffered him by his mysterious friend. But it was not without
  feelings of intense anguish that he turned away from the path leading to the
  little secluded cottage containing all he held dear, and followed his
  conductor, who seemed resolved to allow him no time for further hesitation,
  but proceeding at a rapid pace towards the west till he reached Broad Saint
  Giles's&mdash;then a rural village&mdash;and entered a small tavern, bearing
  the sign of "The Rose and Crown," the landlord of which appeared to have an
  understanding with the promoter, for at a sign from him, he immediately
  ushered his guests into a chamber up-stairs, and without saying a word, left
  them alone together.</p>

  <p>"Here you will be secure and undisturbed," said Lanyere; "and all your
  wants will be cared for by my trusty ally, Barnabas Boteler; but, for your
  own sake, you must consent to remain a close prisoner, till I bring you word
  that you may go forth with safety. I must now leave you, having much to do,
  and must defer the explanations I design to give you to a more convenient
  season. Be not uneasy if you should not see me for a few days, as
  circumstances may prevent my coming to you. When I next appear, I trust it
  may be to bring you good tidings. Till then, farewell."</p>

  <p>And without waiting for any reply from Sir Jocelyn, he hastily
  departed.</p>

  <p>Left alone, our young knight did the best he could to reconcile himself to
  the strange situation in which he was placed. He was naturally full of
  anxiety, both on his own account, and on that of Aveline; yet, on calm
  reflection, he felt satisfied he had acted for the best, and that, in
  accepting the protection of the mysterious individual who seemed bent upon
  directing his fortunes, he had followed the dictates of prudence. Barnabas
  Boteler attended him in person, and suffered no one else to come near him;
  but though the worthy host seemed anxious to anticipate his wants in every
  particular, his manner was reserved, and, in Sir Jocelyn's opinion, he had
  something of the look of a jailor, and this notion was strengthened when he
  found himself locked in his room. Probably this was only done as a
  precautionary measure by the host; and as the window was at no great height
  from the ground, and he could descend from it when he chose, he gave himself
  no great concern about the matter.</p>

  <p>In this way three days passed by without anything occurring to break the
  monotony of his wearisome confinement,&mdash;not even a visit from Clement
  Lanyere. To Sir Jocelyn's inquiries concerning him, the host professed utter
  inability to give a precise answer, but said that he might arrive at any
  moment. As he did not appear, however, on the fourth day, Sir Jocelyn's
  patience got quite worn out, and his uneasiness respecting Aveline having
  become insupportable, he determined, at all hazards, on visiting her cottage.
  Without acquainting the host with his intention, or asking to have the door
  unfastened, he opened the window which looked into a garden at the back of
  the house, and sprang from it. His furtive departure did not appear to be
  noticed, and he soon gained the road, and took the direction of Aveline's
  dwelling.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-21"
     name="ch2-21">CHAPTER XXI.<br>
  The Arrest.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">As he approached the cottage a heavy presentiment of ill
  seized Sir Jocelyn. The place seemed to have lost its customary smiling air.
  No fair countenance beamed upon him from the casement; no light footsteps
  were heard hastening to the door; no one opened it to give him welcome. Could
  Aveline have fled'?&mdash;or had some dire misfortune happened to her.
  Suspense was worse than certainty of ill: and after a moment's hesitation, he
  raised the latch, and with trembling footsteps crossed the threshold.</p>

  <p>She was gone&mdash;he could no longer doubt it. The disordered appearance
  of the chamber in which he found himself, with its furniture scattered about,
  seemed to tell of a struggle, and a forcible abduction. Nevertheless, though
  expecting no answer, he called forth her name in accents of wildest despair.
  She came not to his cries&mdash;neither she nor her companion, Dame
  Sherborne, nor her faithful attendant old Anthony Rocke. All were gone. The
  house was indeed desolate.</p>

  <p>Still clinging to hope, he flew up-stairs, but could find no traces there
  of any of the inmates of the dwelling; and with a heart now completely
  crushed, he descended to the chamber he had just quitted. Here he found
  Clement Lanyere surveying the scene of confusion around him with a stern and
  troubled look. Sir Jocelyn instantly rushed up to him, and seizing him by the
  arm, fiercely demanded what had become of Aveline?</p>

  <p>"She is in the hands of Sir Francis Mitchell," replied the promoter,
  shaking-him off; "and, for aught I know, may be wedded to him by this
  time."</p>

  <p>"Wedded!" almost shrieked the young man. "Impossible! she would never
  consent&mdash;and he would not dare have recourse to violence."</p>

  <p>"Though he might not, his partner, Sir Giles Mompesson, would have no such
  scruples," returned the promoter. "But perhaps you are right, and Aveline's
  determined resistance may intimidate them both so that they may abandon their
  design. I hope so for your sake, and for hers also&mdash;but I have my
  fears."</p>

  <p>"You know more than you choose to avow, Sir," said Sir Jocelyn
  sternly,&mdash;"and as you value your life, I command you to speak plainly,
  and tell me what has happened, and where I shall find Aveline."</p>

  <p>"So commanded by any other than yourself, Sir Jocelyn," rejoined the
  promoter, "I would <i>not</i> speak; but to you I say, as I have before
  declared, that Aveline is undoubtedly in the power of Sir Francis Mitchell,
  and that it will rest entirely with herself whether she escapes him or
  not."</p>

  <p>"And you have caused me to be detained while she has been carried off,"
  exclaimed Sir Jocelyn, furiously. "Fool that I was to trust you! You are in
  league with the villains."</p>

  <p>"Think of me what you please, and say what you will&mdash;you shall not
  anger me," rejoined the promoter. "I discovered your flight from the place of
  refuge I had procured for you, and guessing where you had come, followed you
  hither. Your danger is not past. Vainly will you seek Sir Francis Mitchell.
  You will not find him,&mdash;but you <i>will</i> find a serjeant-at- arms
  with a Star-Chamber warrant for your arrest. To this you can offer no
  resistance; and what will follow? I will tell you:&mdash;immediate
  incarceration in the Fleet Prison. And when safely lodged there, how, may I
  ask, are you to liberate Aveline?"</p>

  <p>"I must trust to chance," replied Sir Jocelyn. "I can no longer place any
  reliance upon you. Stand aside, and let me pass. I would not harm you."</p>

  <p>"You cannot injure one whose intentions are friendly to you as mine are.
  Listen to me, and let what I have to say sink deeply into your breast. Do
  anything rather than render yourself amenable to the accursed tribunal I have
  named. Abandon mistress, friend, relative&mdash;all who are near and dear to
  you&mdash;if they would bring you within its grasp."</p>

  <p>"And do you venture to give me this shameful council? Do you think I will
  attend to it?" cried Sir Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>"I am sure you will, if you hear me out&mdash;and you <i>shall</i> hear
  me," the promoter exclaimed with so much authority that the young man,
  however impatient, could not refuse attention, to him. "Look me in the face,
  Sir Jocelyn! Regard me well! Behold these ineffaceable marks made by the
  heated iron, and the sharpened knife! How came they there? From a sentence of
  the Star-Chamber. And as my offence was the same as yours, so your sentence
  will correspond with mine. Your punishment will be the same as
  mine&mdash;branding and mutilation. Ha! I perceive I have touched you
  now."</p>

  <p>"What was your offence, unhappy man?" asked Sir Jocelyn, averting his gaze
  from the hideous aspect which, now lighted up with mingled emotions of rage
  and despair, had become absolutely appalling.</p>

  <p>"The same as your own, as I have said," replied the other;&mdash;"a few
  hasty words impugning the justice of this vindictive court. Better had I have
  cut out my tongue than have given utterance to them. But my case more nearly
  resembled yours than I have yet explained, for, like you, I had incurred the
  displeasure of Sir Giles Mompesson, and was by him delivered to these hellish
  tormentors. Acting under cover of the Star-Chamber, and in pursuance of its
  iniquitous decrees, he nailed me to the pillory, and so fast, that the ears
  through which the spikes were driven were left behind. Think how you would
  like that, Sir Jocelyn? Think what you would feel, if you stood there on that
  infamous post, a spectacle to the base and shouting rabble, with a paper
  fastened to your breast, setting forth your crimes, and acquainting all that
  you were a Star-Chamber delinquent?"</p>

  <p>"Enough, Sir," interrupted Sir Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>"Ay, enough&mdash;more than enough," rejoined the other; "but I cannot
  spare you the whole of the recital, however painful it may be to you. My own
  sufferings will be yours, if you heed not. So I shall go on. In robbing me of
  my ears, the executioner had only half done his work. He had still further to
  deface the image of his Maker,&mdash;and he hesitated not in his task. No
  savage in the wilds could have treated his deadliest enemy worse than he
  treated me; and yet the vile concourse applauded him, and not a word of pity
  escaped them. My sentence was fully carried out; my features for ever
  disfigured; and the letters of shame indelibly stamped upon my cheek. You may
  read them there now if you will look at me."</p>

  <p>"You thrill me with horror," said Sir Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>"Ay, mine is not a mirthful history, though that fiend in human form, Sir
  Giles, hath often laughed at it," rejoined the promoter. "It might make you
  shudder, and perchance move you to tears, if you could hear it all; but for
  the present, I shall confine myself to such portions of it as bear upon your
  own perilous position&mdash;and I therefore hold myself out as a lesson to
  you. Again, I bid you look upon this ravaged countenance, and say, if by any
  stretch of fancy you can persuade yourself it was once as comely as your own.
  You find it difficult to believe my words&mdash;yet such was the fact. Ay,"
  he continued, in a tone of profoundest melancholy, "I was once proud of the
  gifts nature had vouchsafed me; too proud, alas! and I was punished for my
  vanity and self-boasting. In those days I loved&mdash;and was beloved in
  return&mdash;by a damsel beautiful as Aveline. After my horrible punishment,
  I beheld her no more. Knowing she must regard me with aversion, I shunned
  her. I desired not to be an object of pity. Bring this home to your own
  breast, Sir Jocelyn, and think how direful would be your lot to be driven for
  ever from her you love. Yet, such has been my case."</p>

  <p>"I cannot bear the contemplation&mdash;it were madness," cried the young
  man.</p>

  <p>There was a brief pause, after which Lanyere resumed his story.</p>

  <p>"At the time of being cast into the Fleet Prison, my prospects were fair
  enough. When I came forth I was utterly ruined. Existence was a burden to me,
  and I should have ended my days by my own hand, if the insatiable desire of
  vengeance had not bound me to the world. For this alone I consented to
  live&mdash;to bear the agonies of blighted love&mdash;to endure the scorn and
  taunts of all with whom I was brought into contact. Nay, I attached myself to
  him who had so deeply wronged me, to ensure revenge upon him. My great fear
  was, lest I should be robbed of this precious morsel; and you may remember
  that I struck up your sword when it had touched his breast. He must die by no
  other hand than mine."</p>

  <p>"Your vengeance has been tardy," observed Sir Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>"True," replied the other. "I have delayed it for several reasons, but
  chiefly because I would have it complete. The work is begun, and its final
  accomplishment will not be long postponed. I will not destroy him till I have
  destroyed the superstructure on which he has built his fortunes&mdash;till
  all has crumbled beneath him&mdash;and he is beggared and dishonoured. I have
  begun the work, I say. Look here!" he cried, taking a parchment from his
  doublet. "You would give much for this deed, Sir Jocelyn. This makes me lord
  of a large property in Norfolk, with which you are well acquainted."</p>

  <p>"You cannot mean the Mounchensey estates?" cried Sir Jocelyn. "Yet now I
  look at the instrument, it is so."</p>

  <p>"I obtained this assignment by stratagem," said the promoter; "and I have
  thereby deprived Sir Giles of the most valuable portion of his spoils; and
  though; he thinks to win it back again, he will find himself deceived. My
  measures are too well taken. This is the chief prop of the fabric it has
  taken him so long to rear, and ere long I will shake it wholly in
  pieces."</p>

  <p>"But if you have become unlawfully possessed of this property, as would
  appear to be the case by your own showing, you cannot hope to retain it,"
  said the young knight.</p>

  <p>"Trust me, Sir Jocelyn, I shall prove a better title to it than Sir Giles
  could exhibit," rejoined Lanyere; "but this is not a time for full
  explanation. If I carry out my schemes, you will not be the last person
  benefited by them."</p>

  <p>"Again, I ask you, what possible interest you can feel in me?" demanded
  the young knight with curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Next to myself, you have been most injured by Sir Giles, and even more
  than myself are you an object of dislike to him. These would suffice to
  excite my sympathy towards you; but I have other and stronger reasons for my
  friendly feeling towards you, which in due season you shall know."</p>

  <p>"All your proceedings are mysterious," observed Sir Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>"They must needs be so from the circumstances in which I am placed. I am
  compelled to veil them as I do my hateful features from the prying eyes of
  men: but they will be made clear anon, and you will then understand me and my
  motives better. Ha! what is this?" he suddenly exclaimed, as a noise outside
  attracted his attention. "Fly! fly! there is danger."</p>

  <p>But the warning was too late. Ere the young man, who stood irresolute,
  could effect his retreat from the back of the cottage, the door was thrown
  open, and a serjeant-at-arms, with three attendants in black gowns and flat
  caps, and having black staves in their hands, entered the room.</p>

  <p>Sir Jocelyn had partly drawn his sword, but restored it to the scabbard on
  a glance from Lanyere.</p>

  <p>"Resistance must not be offered," said the latter, in a low tone. "You
  will only make a bad matter worse."</p>

  <p>The serjeant-at-arms, a tall, thin man, with a sinister aspect, advanced
  towards the young knight, and touching him with his wand, said&mdash;"I
  attach your person, Sir Jocelyn Mounchensey, in virtue of a warrant, which I
  hold from the High Court of Star-Chamber."</p>

  <p>"I yield myself your prisoner, Sir," replied Sir Jocelyn. "Whither am I to
  be taken?"</p>

  <p>"You will be taken before the Lords of the Council in the first instance,
  and afterwards, in all probability, be consigned to the custody of the
  wardens of his Majesty's gaol of the Fleet," replied the
  serjeant-at-arms.</p>

  <p>"I would fain know the nature of my offence?" said Sir Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>"You will learn that when the interrogatories are put to you," replied the
  official. "But I am told you have disparaged the dignity of the High Court,
  and that is an offence ever severely punished. Your accuser is Sir Giles
  Mompesson."</p>

  <p>Having said thus much, the serjeant-at-arms turned to the promoter, and
  inquired, "Are you not Clement Lanyere?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask?" rejoined the other.</p>

  <p>"Because if you are he, I must request you to accompany me to Sir Giles
  Mompesson."</p>

  <p>"Lanyere is my name," replied the other; "and if I decline to attend you,
  as you request, it is from no disrespect to you, but from distaste to the
  society into which you propose to bring me. Your warrant does not extend to
  me?"</p>

  <p>"It does not, Sir," replied the serjeant-at-arms.
  "Nevertheless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Arrest him!" cried a voice at the back of the house,&mdash;and a window
  being thrown open, the face of Sir Giles Mompesson appeared at
  it&mdash;"Arrest him!" repeated the extortioner.</p>

  <p>The serjeant-at-arms made a movement, as if of compliance; but Lanyere
  bent towards him, and whispered a few words in his ear, on hearing which the
  official respectfully retired.</p>

  <p>"Why are not my injunctions obeyed, Sir?" demanded Sir Giles, furiously,
  from the window.</p>

  <p>"Because he has rendered me good reason why he may not be molested by
  us&mdash;or by any one else," replied the officer, significantly.</p>

  <p>Lanyere looked with a smile of triumph at the extortioner, and then
  turning to Sir Jocelyn, who seemed half disposed to make an attack upon his
  enemy, said in an under-tone, "Harm him not. Leave him to me."</p>

  <p>After which he quitted the cottage.</p>

  <p>Sir Giles then signed to the serjeant-at-arms to remove his prisoner, and
  disappeared; and the attendants, in sable cloaks, closing round Sir Jocelyn,
  the party went forth.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-22"
     name="ch2-22">CHAPTER XXII.<br>
  The Old Fleet Prison.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mention is made of a prison-house standing near the River
  Fleet as early as the reign of Richard I.; and this was one of the oldest
  jails in London, as its first wardens, whose names are on record, Nathaniel
  de Leveland, and Robert his son, paid, in 1198, a fine of sixty marks for its
  custody; affirming "that it had been their inheritance ever since the
  Conquest, and praying that they might not be hindered therein by the
  counter-fine of Osbert de Longchamp," to whom it had been granted by the
  lion-hearted monarch.</p>

  <p>The next warden of the Fleet, in the days of John, was Simon Fitz-Robert,
  Archdeacon of Wells,&mdash;probably a near relative of Robert de Leveland, as
  the wardship of the daughter of the said Robert, as well as the custody of
  the jail, was also committed to him. The freehold of the prison continued in
  the Leveland family for upwards of three centuries; until, in the reign of
  Philip and Mary it was, sold to John Heath for £2300&mdash;a large sum in
  those days, but not more than the value of the property, which from the way
  it was managed produced a large revenue to its possessor.</p>

  <p>The joint wardens of the Fleet at the time of our history were Sir Henry
  Lello and John Eldred; but their office was executed by deputy in the person
  of Joachim Tunstall, by whom it was rented. As will naturally be supposed, it
  was the object of every deputy-warden to make as much as he could out of the
  unfortunate individuals committed to his charge; and some idea of the
  infamous practices of those persons may be gathered, from a petition
  presented to the Lords of the Council in 1586 by the then prisoners of the
  Fleet. In this it is stated that the warden had "let and set to farm the
  victualling and lodging of all the house and prison of the Fleet to one John
  Harvey, and the other profits of the said Fleet he had let to one Thomas
  Newport, the deputy there under the warden; and these being very poor men,
  having neither land nor any trade to live by, nor any certain wages of the
  said warden, and being also greedy of gain, did live by bribing and
  extortion. That they did most shamefully extort and exact from the prisoners,
  raising new customs, fines, and payments, for their own advantage. That they
  cruelly used them, shutting them up in close prisons when they found fault
  with their wicked dealings; not suffering them to come and go as they ought
  to do; with other abominable misdemeanours, which, without reformation, might
  be the poor prisoners' utter undoing."</p>

  <p>In consequence of this petition, a commission of inquiry into the alleged
  abuses was appointed; but little good was effected by it, for only seven
  years later further complaints were made against the warden, charging him
  with "murders and other grave misdemeanours." Still no redress was obtained;
  nor was it likely it would be, when the cries of the victims of this
  abominable system of oppression were so easily stifled. The most arbitrary
  measures were resorted to by the officers of the prison, and carried out with
  perfect impunity. Their authority was not to be disputed; and it has been
  shown how obedience was enforced. Fines were inflicted and payment made
  compulsory, so that the wealthy prisoner was soon reduced to beggary.
  Resistance to the will of the jailers, and refusal to submit to their
  exactions, were severely punished. Loaded with fetters, and almost deprived
  of food, the miserable captive was locked up in a noisome subterranean
  dungeon; and, if he continued obstinate, was left to rot there. When he
  expired, his death was laid to the jail-fever. Rarely were these dark prison
  secrets divulged, though frequently hinted at.</p>

  <p>The moral condition of the prisoners was frightful. As the greater portion
  of them consisted of vicious and disorderly characters, these contaminated
  the whole mass, so that the place became a complete sink of abomination.
  Drunkenness, smoking, dicing, card-playing, and every kind of licence were
  permitted, or connived at; and the stronger prisoners were allowed to plunder
  the weaker. Such was the state of things in the Fleet Prison at the period of
  our history, when its misgovernment was greater than it had ever previously
  been, and the condition of its inmates incomparably worse.</p>

  <p>During the rebellion of Wat Tyler, the greater part of the buildings
  constituting the ancient prison were burnt down, and otherwise destroyed;
  and, when rebuilt, the jail was strengthened and considerably enlarged. Its
  walls were of stone, now grim and hoary with age; and on the side next to the
  Fleet there was a large square structure, resembling Traitor's Gate at the
  Tower, and forming the sole entrance to the prison. To this gate
  state-offenders were brought by water after committal by the Council of the
  Star-Chamber.</p>

  <p>Nothing could be sterner or gloomier than the aspect of the prison on this
  side&mdash;gray and frowning walls, with a few sombre buildings peeping above
  them, and a black gateway, with a yawning arch, as if looking ready to devour
  the unfortunate being who approached it. Passing through a wicket, contrived
  in the ponderous door, a second gate was arrived at, and this brought the
  captive to the porter's lodge, where he was delivered up to the jailers, and
  assigned a room in one of the wards, according to his means of paying for it.
  The best of these lodgings were but indifferent; and the worst were
  abominable and noisome pits.</p>

  <p>On entering the outer ward, a strange scene presented itself to the view.
  Motley groups were scattered about&mdash;most of the persons composing them
  being clad in threadbare doublets and tattered cloaks, and wearing caps, from
  which the feathers and ornaments had long since disappeared; but there were a
  few&mdash;probably new coiners&mdash;in somewhat better attire. All these
  wore debtors. Recklessness and effrontery were displayed in their
  countenances, and their discourse was full of ribaldry and profanity. At one
  side of this ward there was a large kitchen, where eating and drinking were
  constantly going forward at little tables, as at a tavern or cookshop, and
  where commons were served out to the poorer prisoners.</p>

  <p>Near this was a large hall, which served as the refectory of the prisoners
  for debt. It was furnished with side benches of oak, and had two long tables
  of the same wood; but both benches and tables were in a filthy state, and the
  floor was never cleansed. Indeed, every part of the prison was foul enough to
  breed a pestilence; and the place was seldom free from fever in consequence.
  The upper part of the refectory was traversed by a long corridor, on either
  side of which were the dormitories.</p>

  <p>The arrangements of the inner ward were nearly similar, and differed only
  from the outer, in so far that the accommodations were superior, as they had
  need to be, considering the price asked for them; but even here nothing like
  cleanliness could be found. In this ward was the chapel. At a grated window
  in the gate stood the poor debtors rattling their begging-boxes, and
  endeavouring by their cries to obtain alms from the passers-by.</p>

  <p>Below the warden's lodgings, which adjoined the gate, and which were now
  occupied by the deputy, Joachim Tunstall, was a range of subterranean
  dungeons, built below the level of the Fleet. Frequently flooded by the
  river, these dungeons were exceedingly damp and unwholesome; and they were
  reserved for such prisoners as had incurred the censure of the inexorable
  Court of Star-Chamber. It was in one of the deepest and most dismal of these
  cells that the unfortunate Sir Ferdinando Mounchensey breathed his last.</p>

  <p>Allusion has been previously made to the influence exercised within the
  Fleet by Sir Giles Mompesson. Both the wardens were his friends, and ever
  ready to serve him; their deputy was his creature, and subservient to his
  will in all things; while the jailers and their assistants took his orders,
  whatever they might be, as if from a master. Thus he was enabled to tyrannize
  over the objects of his displeasure, who could never be secure from his
  malice.</p>

  <p>By the modes of torture he adopted through his agents, he could break the
  most stubborn spirit, and subdue the strongest. It was matter of savage
  satisfaction to him to witness the sufferings of his victims; and he never
  ceased from persecution till he had obtained whatever he desired. The
  barbarities carried out in pursuance of the atrocious sentences of the Court
  of Star-Chamber were to him pleasant spectacles; and the bleeding and
  mutilated wretches, whom his accusations had conducted to the pillory, when
  brought back to their dungeons, could not escape his hateful
  presence&mdash;worse to them, from his fiendish derision of their agonies,
  than that of the executioner.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-23"
     name="ch2-23">CHAPTER XXIII.<br>
  How Sir Jocelyn was brought to the Fleet.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">After his arrest by the serjeant-at-arms, Sir Jocelyn was
  taken, in the first instance, to the Star-Chamber, where some of the Lords of
  the Council were sitting at the time, and examined respecting the "libellous
  language and false scandal" he had used in reference to the proceedings of
  that high and honourable court. The young knight did not attempt to deny the
  truth of the charge brought against him, neither did he express contrition,
  or sue for forgiveness; but though he demanded to be confronted with his
  accusers, the request was refused him; and he was told they would appear in
  due time. Several interrogatories were then addressed to him, which he
  answered in a manner calculated, in the judgment of his hearers, to aggravate
  the original offence. After this, he was required to subscribe the minutes of
  his confession, as it was styled; and a warant for his committal to the Fleet
  Prison, and close confinement within it, was made out.</p>

  <p>Consigned once more to the custody of the serjeant-at-arms, he was placed
  on board a barge, of ill-omened appearance, being covered with black cloth,
  like a Venetian gondola, and kept for offenders against the Star-Chamber. In
  this he was rowed down the Thames, and up the Fleet, to the entrance of the
  prison. The progress of the well-known sable barge up the narrow river having
  been noted by the passengers along its banks, as well as by those crossing
  Fleet Bridge, some curiosity was felt to ascertain whom it contained; and a
  crowd collected in front of the prison gate to witness the
  disembarkation.</p>

  <p>When the young knight's title, and the nature of his offence, which latter
  did not appear so enormous in their eyes as in those of the Lords of the
  Council, became known to the bystanders, much sympathy was expressed for him;
  and it might have found a manifestation in more than words, but for the
  guard, who kept back the throng.</p>

  <p>At this juncture, Sir Jocelyn heard his own name pronounced in familiar
  tones, and looking round for the speaker, perceived a person placed in a tub
  close beside him. The individual who occupied this singular and degrading
  position was the ill-starred Dick Taverner, who, it appeared, had made an
  attempt to escape from prison on the third day after he had been brought
  thither, and was punished, according to the custom of the place, by being
  bound hand and foot, set within a tub, and exposed to public gaze and
  derision.</p>

  <p>"Alas! Sir Jocelyn!" ejaculated the apprentice, "but for you I should not
  have been here. I undertook a thankless office, and have been rightly served
  for my folly. We have both found our way to the Fleet, but I much doubt if
  either of us will find his way out of it. As for me, I liked the appearance
  of the place, and the society it seems to furnish, so little, that I resolved
  to make a clearance of it at once; and accordingly I managed to scramble up
  yonder lofty wall, in the hope of effecting my deliverance, without asking
  for a licence to go abroad from the warden; but, unfortunately, in dropping
  down from so great a height I sprained my ankle, and fell again into the
  hands of the Philistines&mdash;and here I am, like the Cynic philosopher in
  his tub."</p>

  <p>Sir Jocelyn would have addressed a few words of consolation to the poor
  fellow, but at this moment the wicket was opened, and he was pushed through
  it by the attendants of the serjeant-at-arms, who were apprehensive of the
  crowd. The small aperture that had given him admittance to the prison was
  instantly closed, and all chance of rescue cut off.</p>

  <p>The prisoner being thus effectually secured, the officials felt more easy;
  and smiling at each other, they proceeded deliberately to the porter's lodge,
  at the entrance of which stood a huge, powerfully-built, ill-favoured man,
  evidently chosen for the post of porter from his personal strength and the
  savageness of his disposition.</p>

  <p>With a growl like that of a mastiff, to the black broad muzzle of which
  animal his own features bore a remarkable resemblance, the porter greeted the
  new comers, and ushered them into an apartment built of stone, octagonal in
  shape, with a vaulted roof, narrow windows like loopholes, and a great stone
  fireplace. Its walls, which resembled those of an ancient guardroom, were
  appropriately enough garnished with fetters; mixed up with which, as if to
  inspire greater terror among the beholders, were an executioner's heavy whip,
  with many knotted thongs, several knives, with strange blades, the purpose of
  which was obvious enough, and branding-irons.</p>

  <p>As Sir Jocelyn was brought into the lodge by his guards, an elderly man,
  with a bald head and gray beard and moustaches, and possessing, in spite of
  his years, a most repulsive physiognomy, advanced to meet him. His doublet
  and hose were of murrey-colour; and his inflamed visage, blood-shot eyes,
  fiery nose, and blotchy forehead, were in keeping with the hue of his
  apparel. This was Joachim Tunstall, Deputy Warden of the Fleet.</p>

  <p>Behind him were some half-dozen jailers, attired in garments of dark-brown
  frieze, and each having a large bunch of keys at his girdle. All of them were
  stout, hard-featured men, and bore upon their countenances the stamp of their
  vocation.</p>

  <p>The warrant for Sir Jocelyn's committal to the Fleet was delivered by the
  serjeant-at-arms to the deputy-warden; and the latter having duly perused it,
  was conferring with one of the jailers as to where the prisoner should be
  conducted, when a side-door was suddenly opened, and Sir Giles Mompesson
  issuing from it, tapped the deputy-warden on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You need not consider where the prisoner is to be lodged, Master
  Tunstall," he said, looking fixedly at Mounchensey all the while. "The
  dungeon he is to occupy is the darkest, the deepest and the dampest in the
  Fleet. It is that in which his father died. You know it well, Grimbald," he
  added, to one of the burliest of the jailers. "Take him thither at once, and
  I will go with you to see him safely bestowed.</p>

  <p>"Pass on, Sir," he continued, with a smile of fiendish satisfaction, as
  Mounchensey was led forth by the jailer.</p>

  <p>Chapter XXIV.</p>

  <p>The Abduction.</p>

  <p>Night had come on, and Aveline was anxiously expecting the arrival of her
  lover, when a loud knocking was heard at the door of the cottage; and before
  the summons could be answered by Anthony Rocke, two persons entered, and
  pushing past the old serving-man, who demanded their business, and vainly
  endeavoured to oppose their progress, forced their way into the presence of
  his mistress. Dame Sherborne was in an inner room, but, alarmed by the noise,
  she flew to the aid of her charge, and reached her at the same moment with
  the intruders. Her lamp threw its light full upon their countenances; and
  when she found who they were, she screamed and nearly let it fall, appearing
  to stand much more in need of support than Aveline herself.</p>

  <p>The foremost of the two was Sir Giles Mompesson, and his usually stern and
  sinister features had acquired a yet more inauspicious cast, from the
  deathlike paleness that bespread them, as well as from the fillet bound round
  his injured brow. The other was an antiquated coxcomb, aping the airs and
  graces of a youthful gallant, attired in silks and velvets fashioned in the
  newest French mode, and exhaling a mingled perfume of civet, musk, and
  ambergris; and in him Aveline recognised the amorous old dotard, who had
  stared at her so offensively during the visit she had been forced to make to
  the extortioner.</p>

  <p>Sir Francis's deportment was not a whit less impertinent or objectionable
  now than heretofore. After making a profound salutation to Aveline, which he
  thought was executed in the most courtly style, and with consummate grace, he
  observed in a loud whisper to his partner, "'Fore heaven! a matchless
  creature! a divinity! Introduce me in due form, Sir Giles."</p>

  <p>"Suffer me to make known to you Sir Francis Mitchell, fair mistress," said
  Mompesson. "He is so ravished by your charms that he can neither eat, drink,
  nor sleep; and he professes to me, his friend and partner, that he must die
  outright, unless you take pity on him. Is it not so, Sir Francis? Nay, plead
  your own cause, man. You will do it better than I, who am little accustomed
  to tune my voice to the ear of beauty."</p>

  <p>During this speech, the old usurer conducted himself in a manner that,
  under other circumstances, must have moved Aveline's mirth; but it now only
  excited her disgust and indignation. Sighing, groaning placing his hand upon
  his heart, languishingly regarding her, and turning up his eyes till the
  whites alone were visible, he ended by throwing himself at her feet, seizing
  her hand, and attempting to cover it with kisses.</p>

  <p>"Deign to listen to me, peerless and adorable damsel!" he cried in the
  most impassioned accents he could command, though he wheezed terribly all the
  while, and was ever and anon interrupted by a fit of coughing. "Incline your
  ear to me, I beseech you. Sir Giles has in no respect exaggerated my sad
  condition. Ever since I beheld you I have been able to do nothing else
  than&mdash;ough! ough!&mdash;dwell upon your surpassing attractions. Day and
  night your lovely image has been constantly before me. You have driven sleep
  from my eyelids, and rest from my&mdash;(ough! ough!)&mdash;frame. Your
  lustrous eyes have lighted up such a fire in my breast as can never be
  extinguished, unless&mdash;(ough! ough! ough!)&mdash;plague take this cough!
  I owe it to you, fair mistress of my heart, as well as my other torments. But
  as I was about to say, the raging flame you have kindled in my breast will
  utterly consume me, unless&mdash;(ough! ough! ough!)"</p>

  <p>Here he was well-nigh choked, and Sir Giles had to come to his
  assistance.</p>

  <p>"What my worthy friend and partner would declare, if his cough permitted
  him, fair Mistress Aveline," urged the extortioner, "is that he places his
  life and fortune at your disposal. His desires are all centred in you, and it
  rests with you to make him the happiest or most miserable of mankind. Speak I
  not your sentiments, Sir Francis?"</p>

  <p>"In every particular, good Sir Giles," replied the other, as soon as he
  could recover utterance. "And now, most adorable damsel, what say you in
  answer? You are too gentle, I am sure, to condemn your slave to endless
  tortures. Nay, motion me not to rise. I have that to say will disarm your
  frowns, and turn them into smiles of approval and assent. (O, this accursed
  rheumatism!" he muttered to himself, "I shall never be able to get up
  unaided!) I love you, incomparable creature&mdash;love you to distraction;
  and as your beauty has inflicted such desperate wounds upon my heart, so I am
  sure your gentleness will not fail to cure them. Devotion like mine must meet
  its reward. Your answer, divinest creature! and let it be favourable to my
  hopes, I conjure you!"</p>

  <p>"I have no other answer to give," replied Aveline, coldly, and with an
  offended look, "except such as any maiden, thus unwarrantably and
  unseasonably importuned, would make. Your addresses are utterly distasteful
  to me, and I pray you to desist them. If you have any real wish to oblige me,
  you will at once free me from your presence."</p>

  <p>"Your hand, Sir Giles&mdash;your hand!" cried the old usurer, raising
  himself to his feet with difficulty, "So, you are not to be moved by my
  sufferings&mdash;by my prayers, cruel and proud beauty?" he continued,
  regarding her with a mortified and spiteful look. "You are
  inflexible&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>"Utterly so," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Anthony Rocke!" cried Dame Sherborne, "show the gentlemen to the
  door&mdash;and bolt it upon them," she added, in a lower tone.</p>

  <p>"Not so fast, Madam&mdash;not so fast!" exclaimed Sir Francis. "We will
  not trouble old Anthony just yet. Though his fair young mistress is
  indisposed to listen to the pleadings of love, it follows not she will be
  equally insensible to the controlling power of her father's delegated
  authority. Her hand must be mine, either freely, or by compulsion. Let her
  know on what grounds I claim it, Sir Giles."</p>

  <p>"Your claim cannot be resisted, Sir Francis," rejoined the other; "and if
  you had followed my counsel, you would not have condescended to play the
  abject wooer, but have adopted the manlier course, and demanded her hand as
  your right."</p>

  <p>"Nay, Sir Giles, you cannot wonder at me, knowing how infatuated I am by
  this rare and admirable creature. I was unwilling to assert my rights till
  all other means of obtaining her hand had failed. But now I have no
  alternative."</p>

  <p>"Whence is your authority derived?" inquired Aveline, trembling as she put
  the question.</p>

  <p>"From your dead father," said Sir Giles, sternly. "His last solemn
  injunctions to you were, that you should wed the man to whom he had promised
  you; provided your hand were claimed by him within a year after his death.
  With equal solemnity you bound yourself to fulfil his wishes. The person to
  whom you were thus sacredly contracted is Sir Francis Mitchell; and now, in
  your father's name, and by your father's authority, he demands fulfilment of
  the solemn pledge."</p>

  <p>"O, this is wholly impossible!&mdash;I will not believe it!" almost
  shrieked Aveline, throwing herself into Dame Sherborne's arms.</p>

  <p>"It is some wicked device to ensnare you, I am convinced," said the old
  lady, clasping her to her breast. "But we defy them, as we do the Prince of
  Darkness, and all his iniquities. Avoid thee, thou wicked old
  sinner!&mdash;thou worse than the benighted heathen! Get hence! I say,
  Sathanas!" she ejaculated to Sir Francis.</p>

  <p>"Ay, I am well assured it is all a fabrication," said Anthony Rocke. "My
  master had too much consideration and tenderness for his daughter to promise
  her to a wretched old huncks like this, with one foot in the grave already.
  Besides, I knew he held both him and Sir Giles Mompesson in utter abomination
  and contempt. The thing is, therefore, not only improbable, but altogether
  impossible."</p>

  <p>"Hold thy peace, sirrah!" cried Sir Francis, foaming with rage, "or I will
  cut thy scurril tongue out of thy throat. Huncks, indeed! As I am a true
  gentleman, if thou wert of my own degree, thou shouldst answer for the
  opprobrious expression."</p>

  <p>"What proof have you that my father entered into any such engagement with
  you?" inquired Aveline, turning to Sir Francis. "Your bare assertion will
  scarcely satisfy me."</p>

  <p>"Neither will it satisfy me," remarked Anthony. "Let him produce his
  proofs."</p>

  <p>"You are acquainted with your father's handwriting, I presume, fair
  maiden?" rejoined Sir Francis. "And it may be that your insolent and
  incredulous serving-man is also acquainted with it. Look at this document,
  and declare whether it be not, as I assert, traced in Hugh Calveley's
  characters. Look at it, I say, thou unbelieving hound," he added, to Anthony,
  "and contradict me if thou canst."</p>

  <p>"It is my master's writing, I am compelled to admit," replied the old
  serving-man, with a groan.</p>

  <p>"Are you prepared to render obedience to your father's behests, maiden?"
  demanded Sir Giles, menacingly.</p>

  <p>"O, give me counsel! What shall I say to them?" cried Aveline, appealing
  to Dame Sherborne. "Would that Sir Jocelyn were here!"</p>

  <p>"It is in vain to expect his coming," rejoined Sir Giles, with a bitter
  laugh. "We have taken good care to keep him out of the way."</p>

  <p>"There is no help then!" said Aveline, despairingly. "I must submit."</p>

  <p>"We triumph," whispered Sir Giles to his partner.</p>

  <p>"Talk not of submission, my dear young lady," implored Anthony Rocke.
  "Resist them to the last. I will shed my best blood in your defence. If my
  master did give them that paper he must have been out of his senses, and you
  need not, therefore, regard it as other than the act of a madman."</p>

  <p>"Peace, shallow-pated fool!" cried Sir Giles. "And do you, fair mistress,
  attend to me, and you shall learn under what circumstances that contract was
  made, and how it becomes binding upon you. Deeply indebted to Sir Francis,
  your father had only one means of discharging his obligations. He did
  hesitate to avail himself of it. He promised you to his creditor, and
  obtained his own release. Will you dishonour his memory by a refusal?"</p>

  <p>"O, if this tale be true, I have no escape from misery!" exclaimed
  Aveline. "And it wears the semblance of probability."</p>

  <p>"I take upon me to declare it to be false," cried Anthony Rocke.</p>

  <p>"Another such insolent speech shall cost thee thy life, sirrah!" cried Sir
  Giles, fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Read over the paper again, my dear young lady," said Dame Sherborne. "You
  may, perhaps, find something in it not yet discovered, which may help you to
  a better understanding of your father's wishes."</p>

  <p>"Ay, read it!&mdash;read it!" cried the old usurer, giving her the paper.
  "You will perceive in what energetic terms your father enjoins compliance on
  your part with his commands; and what awful denunciations he attaches to your
  disobedience. Read it, I say, and fancy he is speaking to you from the grave
  in these terms&mdash;'Take this man for thy husband, O my daughter, and take
  my blessing with him. Reject him, and my curse shall alight upon thy
  head.'"</p>

  <p>But Aveline was too much engrossed to heed him. Suddenly her eye caught
  something she had not previously noticed, and she exclaimed,&mdash;"I have
  detected the stratagem. I knew this authority could never be committed to
  you."</p>

  <p>"What mean you, fair mistress?" cried Sir Francis, surprised and alarmed.
  "My name may not appear upon the face of the document; but, nevertheless, I
  am the person referred to by it."</p>

  <p>"The document itself disproves your assertion," cried Aveline, with
  exultation.</p>

  <p>"How so?" demanded Sir Giles, uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Why, see you not that he to whom my father designed to give my hand was
  named Osmond Mounchensey?"</p>

  <p>"Osmond Mounchensey!" exclaimed Sir Giles, starting.</p>

  <p>"This is pure invention!" cried Sir Francis. "There is no such name on the
  paper&mdash;no name at all, in short&mdash;nor could there be any, for
  reasons I will presently explain."</p>

  <p>"Let your own eyes convince you to the contrary," she rejoined, extending
  the paper to him and revealing to his astounded gaze and to that of his
  partner, who looked petrified with surprise, the name plainly written as she
  had described it.</p>

  <p>"How came it there?" cried Sir Giles, as soon as he could command
  himself.</p>

  <p>"I cannot say," replied Sir Francis. "I only know it was not there when
  I&mdash;that is, when I received it. It must be Clement Lanyere's handiwork,"
  he added in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"I see not how that can be," replied the other, in a like low tone. "The
  alteration must have been made since it has been in your possession. It could
  not have escaped my observation."</p>

  <p>"Nor mine," cried Sir Francis. "'T is passing strange!"</p>

  <p>"Your infamous project is defeated," cried Aveline. "Let the rightful
  claimant appear, and it will be time enough to consider what I will
  do.&mdash;But I can hold no further discourse with you, and command your
  instant departure."</p>

  <p>"And think you we mean to return empty-handed, fair mistress?" said Sir
  Giles, resuming all his wonted audacity. "Be not deceived. By fair means or
  foul you shall be the bride of Sir Francis Mitchell. I have sworn it, and I
  will keep my oath!"</p>

  <p>"As I am a true gentleman, it will infinitely distress me to resort to
  extremities, fair mistress," said the old usurer, "and I still trust you will
  listen to reason. If I have put in practice a little harmless stratagem, what
  matters it? All is fair in love. And if you knew all, you would be aware that
  I have already paid so dearly for you that I cannot afford to lose you. Cost
  what it will, you must be mine."</p>

  <p>"Never!" exclaimed Aveline, resolutely.</p>

  <p>"You will soon alter your tone, when you find how little power of refusal
  is left you, fair mistress," said Sir Giles. "A litter is waiting for you
  without. Will it please you to enter it?"</p>

  <p>"Not unless by force&mdash;and you dare to offer me violence," she
  replied.</p>

  <p>"I advise you not to put our forbearance to the test," said Sir Giles.</p>

  <p>"I should be grieved to impose any restraint upon you," subjoined Sir
  Francis; "and I trust you will not compel me to act against my inclinations.
  Let me lead you to the litter."</p>

  <p>As he advanced towards her, Aveline drew quickly back, and Dame Sherborne
  uttered a loud scream; but her cries brought no other help than could be
  afforded by old Anthony Rocke, who, planting himself before his young
  mistress, menaced Sir Francis to retire.</p>

  <p>But this state of things was only of brief duration. It speedily appeared
  that the two extortioners had abundant assistance at hand to carry out their
  infamous design. A whistle was sounded by Sir Giles; and at the call the
  cottage door was burst open by some half dozen of the myrmidons, headed by
  Captain Bludder.</p>

  <p>Any resistance that the old serving-man could offer was speedily overcome.
  Knocked down by a pike, he was gagged and pinioned, and carried out of the
  house. The cries of Aveline and the elderly dame were stifled by scarves tied
  over their heads; and both being in a fainting condition from fright, they
  were borne to the litter which was standing at the door, and being shut up
  within it, were conveyed as quickly as might be to Sir Giles Mompesson's
  mansion, near the Fleet. Thither, also, was old Anthony Rocke taken, closely
  guarded on the way by two of the myrmidons.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-25"
     name="ch2-25">CHAPTER XXV.<br>
  The "Stone Coffin."</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A dreadful dungeon! the last and profoundest of the range of
  subterranean cells already described as built below the level of the river
  Fleet: a relict, in fact, of the ancient prison which had escaped the fury of
  Wat Tyler and his followers, when the rest of the structure was destroyed by
  them. Not inaptly was the dungeon styled the "Stone Coffin." Those immured
  within it seldom lived long.</p>

  <p>A chill like that of death smote Sir Jocelyn, as he halted before the door
  of this horrible place. Preceded by Grimbald the jailer, with a lamp in one
  hand and a bunch of large keys in the other, and closely followed by the
  deputy-warden and Sir Giles Mompesson, our young knight had traversed an
  underground corridor with cells on one side of it, and then, descending a
  flight of stone steps, had reached a still lower pit, in which the dismal
  receptacle was situated. Here he remained up to the ankles in mud and water,
  while Grimbald unlocked the ponderous door, and with a grin revealed the
  interior of the cavernous recess.</p>

  <p>Nothing more dank and noisome could be imagined than the dungeon. Dripping
  stone-walls, a truckle-bed with a mouldy straw-mattrass, rotting litter
  scattered about, a floor glistening and slippery with ooze, and a deep pool
  of water, like that outside, at the further end,&mdash;these constituted the
  materials of the frightful picture presented to the gaze. No wonder Sir
  Jocelyn should recoil, and refuse to enter the cell.</p>

  <p>"You don't seem to like your lodgings, worshipful Sir," said Grimbald,
  still grinning, as he held up the lamp; "but you will soon get used to the
  place, and you will not lack company&mdash;rats, I mean: they come from the
  Fleet in swarms. Look! a score of 'em are making off yonder&mdash;swimming to
  their holes. But they will come back again with some of their comrades, when
  you are left alone, and without a light. Unlike other vermin, the rats of the
  Fleet are extraordinarily sociable&mdash;ho! ho!"</p>

  <p>And, chuckling at his own jest, Grimbald turned to Sir Giles Mompesson,
  who, with Joachim Tunstall, was standing at the summit of the steps, as if
  unwilling to venture into the damp region below, and observed&mdash;"The
  worshipful gentleman does not like the appearance of his quarters, it seems,
  Sir Giles; but we cannot give him better,&mdash;and, though the cell might be
  somewhat more comfortable if it were drier, and perhaps more wholesome, yet
  it is uncommonly quiet, and double the size of any other in the Fleet. I
  never could understand why it should be called the 'Stone Coffin'&mdash;but
  so it is. Some prisoners have imagined they would get their death with cold
  from a single night passed within it&mdash;but that's a mistaken notion
  altogether."</p>

  <p>"You have proof to the contrary in Sir Ferdinando Mounchensey, father of
  the present prisoner," said Sir Giles, in a derisive tone. "He occupied that
  cell for more than six months. Did he not, good Grimbald? You had charge of
  him, and ought to know?"</p>

  <p>"One hundred and sixty days exactly, counting from the date of his arrival
  to the hour of his death, was Sir Ferdinando an inmate of the 'Stone
  Coffin,'" said the jailer, slowly and sententiously; "and he appeared to
  enjoy his health quite as well as could be expected&mdash;at all events, he
  did so at first. I do not think it was quite so damp in his days&mdash;but
  there couldn't be much difference. In any case, the worthy knight made no
  complaints; perhaps because he thought there would be no use in making 'em.
  Ah! worshipful Sir," he added to Sir Jocelyn, in a tone of affected sympathy
  which only made his mockery more offensive, "your father was a goodly man, of
  quite as noble a presence as yourself, though rather stouter and broader in
  the shoulders, when he first came here; but he was sadly broken down at the
  last&mdash;quite a skeleton. You would hardly have known him."</p>

  <p>"He lost the use of his limbs, if I remember right, Grimbald?" remarked
  Sir Giles, willing to prolong the scene, which appeared to afford him
  infinite amusement.</p>

  <p>"Entirely lost the use of 'em," replied the jailer. "But what of that? He
  didn't require to take exercise. A friend was permitted to visit him, and
  that was more grace than the Council usually allows to such offenders."</p>

  <p>"It was far more than an offender like Sir Ferdinando deserved," said Sir
  Giles; "and, if I had known it, he should have had no such indulgence.
  Star-Chamber delinquents cannot expect to be treated like ordinary prisoners.
  If they do, they will be undeceived when brought here&mdash;eh, Master
  Tunstall?"</p>

  <p>"Most true, Sir Giles, most true!" replied the deputy-warden.
  "Star-Chamber prisoners will get little indulgence from me, I warrant
  them."</p>

  <p>"Unless they bribe you well&mdash;eh, Master Joachim?" whispered Sir
  Giles, merrily.</p>

  <p>"Rest easy on that score, Sir Giles. I am incorruptible, unless you allow
  it," rejoined the other, obsequiously.</p>

  <p>"My poor father!" ejaculated Sir Jocelyn. "And thou wert condemned without
  a crime to a death of lingering agony within this horrible cell! The bare
  idea of it is madness. But Heaven, though its judgments be slow, will yet
  avenge thee upon thy murderers!"</p>

  <p>"Take heed what you say, prisoner," observed Grimbald, changing his
  manner, and speaking with great harshness. "Every word you utter against the
  decrees of the Star-Chamber, will be reported to the Council, and will be
  brought up against you; so you had best be cautious. Tour father was
  <i>not</i> murdered. He was immured in this cell in pursuance of a sentence
  of the High Court, and he died before his term of captivity had expired, that
  is all."</p>

  <p>"O, the days and nights of anguish and despair he must have endured during
  that long captivity!" exclaimed Sir Jocelyn, before whose gaze a vision of
  his dying father seemed to pass, filling him with unutterable horror.</p>

  <p>"Days and nights which will henceforth be your own," roared Sir Giles;
  "and you will then comprehend the nature of your father's feelings. But he
  escaped what you will <i>not</i> escape&mdash;exposure on the pillory,
  branding on the cheek, loss of ears, slitting of the nose, and it may be,
  scourging. The goodly appearance you have inherited from your sire will not
  be long left when the tormentor takes you in hand. Ha! ha!"</p>

  <p>"One censured by the Star-Chamber must wear a paper on his breast at the
  pillory. You must not forget that mark of infamy, Sir Giles," said the
  deputy-warden, chuckling.</p>

  <p>"No, no; I forget it not," laughed the extortioner. "How ingeniously
  devised are our Star-Chamber punishments, Master Joachim, and how well they
  meet the offences. Infamous libellers and slanderers of the State, like Sir
  Jocelyn, are ever punished in one way; but new crimes require new manner of
  punishment. You recollect the case of Traske, who practised Judaism, and
  forbade the use of swine's flesh, and who was sentenced to be fed upon
  nothing but pork during his confinement."</p>

  <p>"I recollect it perfectly," cried Tunstall, "a just judgment. The wretch
  abhorred the food, and would have starved himself rather than take it; but we
  forced the greasy morsels down his throat. Ha! ha! You are merry, Sir Giles,
  very merry; I have not seen you so gleesome this many a day&mdash;scarcely
  since the time when Clement Lanyere underwent his sentence."</p>

  <p>"Ah! the accursed traitor!" exclaimed Sir Giles, with an explosion of
  rage. "Would he had to go through it again! If I catch him, he
  shall&mdash;and I am sure to lay hands upon him soon. But to our present
  prisoner. You will treat him in all respects as his father was treated,
  Master Joachim&mdash;but no one must come nigh him."</p>

  <p>"No one shall approach him save with an order from the Council, Sir
  Giles," replied the other.</p>

  <p>"Not even then," said the extortioner decisively. "My orders alone must be
  attended to!"</p>

  <p>"Hum!" ejaculated the deputy-warden, somewhat perplexed. "Well, I will
  follow out your instructions as strictly as I can, Sir Giles. I suppose you
  have nothing more to say to the prisoner, and Grimbald may as well lock him
  up."</p>

  <p>And, receiving a nod of assent from the other, he called to the jailer to
  finish his task.</p>

  <p>But Sir Jocelyn resolutely refused to enter the cell, and demanded a room
  in one of the upper wards.</p>

  <p>"You shall have no other chamber than this," said Sir Giles, in a
  peremptory tone.</p>

  <p>"I did not address myself to you, Sir, but to the deputy-warden," rejoined
  Sir Jocelyn. "Master Joachim Tunstall, you well know I am not sentenced by
  the Star-Chamber, or any other court, to confinement within this cell. I will
  not enter it; and I order you, at your peril, to provide me with a better
  chamber. This is wholly unfit for occupation."</p>

  <p>"Do not argue the point, Grimbald, but force him into the cell," roared
  the extortioner.</p>

  <p>"Fair and softly, Sir Giles, fair and softly," replied the jailer. "Now,
  prisoner, you hear what is said&mdash;are you prepared to obey?"</p>

  <p>And he was about to lay hands rudely upon Sir Jocelyn, when the latter,
  pushing him aside, ran nimbly up the steps, and seizing Sir Giles by the
  throat, dragged him downward.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the resistance of the extortioner, whose efforts at
  liberation were seconded by Grimbald, our young knight succeeded in forcing
  his enemy into the dungeon, and hurled him to the further end of it. During
  the struggle, Sir Jocelyn had managed to possess himself of the other's
  sword, and he now pointed it at his breast.</p>

  <p>"You have constituted yourself my jailer," he cried, "and by the soul of
  him who perished in this loathsome cell, by your instrumentality, I will send
  you instantly to account for your crimes on High, unless you promise to
  assign me a different chamber!"</p>

  <p>"I promise it," replied Sir Giles. "You shall have the best in the Fleet.
  Let me go forth, and you shall choose one for yourself."</p>

  <p>"I will not trust you, false villain," cried Sir Jocelyn. "Give orders to
  the deputy-warden, and if he pledges his word they shall be obeyed, I will
  take it. Otherwise you die."</p>

  <p>"Bid Master Tunstall come to me, Grimbald," gasped the extortioner.</p>

  <p>"I am here, Sir Giles, I am here," replied the deputy-warden, cautiously
  entering the cell. "What would you have me do?"</p>

  <p>"Free me from this restraint," cried Sir Giles, struggling to regain his
  feet.</p>

  <p>Sir Jocelyn shortened his sword in order to give him a mortal thrust, but
  his purpose was prevented by Grimbald. With his heavy bunch of keys the
  jailer struck the young knight upon the head, and stretched him insensible
  upon the ground.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-26"
     name="ch2-26">CHAPTER XXVI.<br>
  A Secret Friend.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When Sir Jocelyn again became conscious, he found he had
  been transported to a different cell, which, in comparison with the "Stone
  Coffin," was clean and comfortable. The walls were of stone, and the pallet
  on which he was laid was of straw, but the place was dry, and free from the
  noisome effluvium pervading the lower dungeon. The consideration shown him
  originated in the conviction on the part of the deputy-warden, that the young
  man must die if left in his wounded state in that unwholesome vault, and so
  the removal took place, in spite of the objections raised to it by Sir Giles
  Mompesson, who would have willingly let him perish. But Master Tunstall
  dreaded an inquiry, as the prisoner had not yet been sentenced by the
  Council.</p>

  <p>After glancing round his cell, and endeavouring recal the events that had
  conducted him to it, Sir Jocelyn tried to raise himself, but found his limbs
  so stiff that he could not accomplish his object, and he sank back with a
  groan. At this moment the door opened, and Grimbald, accompanied by a
  repulsive-looking personage, with a face like a grinning mask, advanced
  towards the pallet.</p>

  <p>"This is the wounded man, Master Luke Hatton," said the jailer; "you will
  exert your best skill to cure him; and you must use dispatch, in case he
  should be summoned before the Council."</p>

  <p>"The Council must come to him if they desire to interrogate him now,"
  replied Luke Hatton; adding, after he had examined the injuries received by
  the young knight, "He is badly hurt, but not so severely as I expected. I
  will undertake to set him upon his legs in three days. I did as much for Sir
  Giles Mompesson, and he was wounded in the same manner."</p>

  <p>"Why, this is the young knight who struck down Sir Giles at the jousts,"
  said Grimbald. "Strange! you should have two mortal enemies to deal
  with."</p>

  <p>"Is this Sir Jocelyn Mounchensey?" inquired Luke Hatton, with apparent
  curiosity. "You did not tell me so before."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I ought not to have told you so now," returned the other. "But do
  you take any interest in him?"</p>

  <p>"Not much," replied the apothecary; "but I have heard his name often
  mentioned of late. You need not be uneasy about this young man being summoned
  before the Star-Chamber. The great case of the Countess of Exeter against
  Lady Lake comes on before the King and the Lords of the Council to-morrow or
  next day, and it will occupy all their attention. They will have no time for
  aught else."</p>

  <p>"What think you will be the judgment in that case?" inquired Grimbald.</p>

  <p>"I have my own opinion," returned the apothecary, with a significant
  smile; "but I care not to reveal it. I am a witness in the case myself, and
  something may depend on my evidence. You asked me just now whether I took any
  interest in this young man. I will tell you what surprised me to find him
  here. Sir Francis Mitchell has taken it into his head to rob him of his
  intended bride."</p>

  <p>"Ah! indeed!" exclaimed the jailer, with a laugh. "The old dotard does not
  mean to marry her?"</p>

  <p>"By my troth but he does&mdash;and the wedding is to be a grand one. I
  will tell you more about it anon."</p>

  <p>At this moment Sir Jocelyn, who had hitherto remained with his eyes
  closed, uttered a cry of anguish, and again vainly endeavoured to raise
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Aveline married to Sir Francis?" he cried. "Said you she was to be forced
  into a union with that hoary miscreant? It must be prevented."</p>

  <p>"I see not how it can be, Sir Jocelyn," replied Luke Hatton, "since she is
  in the power of Sir Giles Mompesson. Besides which, the 'hoary miscreant,' as
  you style him, will take means to ensure her acquiescence."</p>

  <p>"Means! what means?" demanded Sir Jocelyn, writhing in agony.</p>

  <p>"A love-potion," replied Luke Hatton, calmly, "I am about to prepare a
  philter for her, and will answer for its effect. She will be the old
  knight's, and without opposition."</p>

  <p>"Infernal villain! and that I should be lying here, unable to give her
  aid!"</p>

  <p>And overcome by the intensity of his emotion, as well as by acute bodily
  suffering, Sir Jocelyn relapsed into insensibility.</p>

  <p>He was not, however, suffered to remain long in this state. Stimulants
  applied by Luke Hatton soon restored him to consciousness. The first object
  his gaze fell upon was the apothecary, and he was about to vent his fury upon
  him in words, when the latter, cautiously raising his finger to his lips,
  said in a whisper&mdash;"I am a friend. Grimbald is only at the door, and a
  single exclamation on your part will betray me." He then leaned down, and
  bringing his lips almost close to the young knight's ear,
  whispered&mdash;"What I said before the jailer was correct. I have been
  applied to by Sir Francis for a philter to be administered to Mistress
  Aveline, and I have promised it to him; but I am secretly in the service of
  Clement Lanyere, and will defeat the old usurer's villainous designs."</p>

  <p>Sir Jocelyn could not repress a cry of delight, and Grimbald entered the
  cell.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-27"
     name="ch2-27">CHAPTER XXVII.<br>
  Showing how judgment was given by King James<br>
  in the Star Chamber, in the great cause of the<br>
  Countess of Exeter against Sir Thomas and Lady Lake.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Five days had King James and the whole of the Privy Council
  been sitting within the Star-Chamber; and the great cause that had occupied
  them during the whole of that time was drawing to an end&mdash;little
  remaining for his Majesty to do in it, except to pronounce sentence.</p>

  <p>The cause to which James and his Councillors had lent a hearing so long
  and patient, was no other than that of the Countess of Exeter against Sir
  Thomas Lake and his Lady. Throughout it, whether prompted or not as to the
  course he pursued, the Monarch displayed great sagacity and penetration.
  Prior to the trial, and when the preliminary statements had alone been laid
  before him, he determined personally to investigate the matter, and without
  acquainting any one with his design, while out hunting, he rode over to the
  Earl of Exeter's residence at Wimbledon&mdash;the place, it will be
  recollected, where the forged confession was alleged to have been signed by
  the Countess&mdash;and proceeded to examine the particular chamber indicated
  by Lady Lake and Sarah Swarton as the scene of the transaction. He was
  accompanied by Buckingham, and some other lords high in his favour. On
  examination it was found that the chamber was of such size, and the lower
  part of it, where Sarah was reported to have been concealed, was so distant
  from the large bay window, that any conversation held there must have been
  inaudible to her; as was proved, upon experiment, by the King and his
  attendants. But the crowning circumstance was the discovery made by James
  himself&mdash;for his courtiers were too discreet to claim any share in
  it&mdash;that the hangings did not reach within two feet of the floor, and
  consequently could not have screened a secret witness from view; while it was
  further ascertained that the arras had been entirely undisturbed for several
  years. On making this discovery, James rubbed his hands with great glee, and
  exclaimed&mdash;"Aha! my Lady Lake and her handmaiden may forswear themselves
  if they choose&mdash;but they will not convince me. Oaths cannot confound my
  sight."</p>

  <p>This asseveration he repeated during the trial, at which he proffered his
  own testimony in favour of the plaintiff; and indeed it was evident from the
  first, however much he might seek to disguise it, that he was strongly
  biassed towards the Countess. Not content, however, with the discovery he had
  made at Wimbledon, James had secretly despatched a serjeant-at-arms to Rome,
  where Lord Roos had taken up his residence after leaving England, and
  obtained from him and from his confidential servant Diego, a statement
  incriminating Lady Lake, and denouncing the confession as a wicked forgery.
  Luke Hatton, moreover, who had gone over, as already intimated, to the side
  of the Countess, and who took care to hide his own complicity in the dark
  affair, and to give a very different colour to his conduct from what really
  belonged to it&mdash;Luke Hatton, we say, became a most important witness
  against the Lakes, and it was said to be owing to his crafty insinuations
  that the King conceived the idea of visiting Wimbledon as
  before-mentioned.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding all this, there were many irreconcileable contradictions,
  and the notoriously bad character of Lord Roos, his cruel treatment of his
  wife, and his passionate devotion to the Countess, led many to suspect that,
  after all, he and Lady Exeter were the guilty parties they were represented.
  Moreover, by such as had any knowledge of the man, Luke Hatton was not
  esteemed a credible witness; and it was generally thought that his testimony
  ought not to be received by the King, or accepted only with the greatest
  caution.</p>

  <p>But the opinions favourable to Lady Lake and her husband underwent an
  entire change in the early part of the trial, when, to the surprise of all,
  and to the inexpressible dismay of her parents, Lady Roos, who had been
  included in the process by the Countess, made a confession, wherein she
  admitted that the document produced by her mother against Lady Exeter, was
  fabricated, and that all the circumstances said to be connected with it at
  the time of its supposed signature, were groundless and imaginary. The
  unfortunate lady's motive for making this revelation was the desire of
  screening her husband; and so infatuated was she by her love of him, that she
  allowed herself to be persuaded&mdash;by the artful suggestions, it was
  whispered, of Luke Hatton&mdash;that this would be the means of accomplishing
  their reconciliation, and that she would be rewarded for her devotion by his
  returning regard. If such was her belief, she was doomed to disappointment.
  She never beheld him again. Lord Roos died abroad soon after the trial took
  place; nor did his ill-fated lady long survive him.</p>

  <p>Thus, it will be seen, all circumstances were adverse to the Lakes. But in
  spite of the difficulties surrounding her, and the weight of evidence, true
  or false, brought against her, no concession could be obtained from Lady
  Lake, and she stoutly protested her innocence, and retaliated in most
  forcible terms upon her accusers. She gave a flat contradiction to her
  daughter, and poured terrible maledictions on her head, ceasing them not
  until silenced by command of the King. The fearful charges brought by her
  ladyship against Luke Hatton produced some effect, and were listened to; but,
  as they could only be substantiated by herself and Sarah Swarton, they fell
  to the ground; since here again Lady Roos refused to be a witness against her
  husband.</p>

  <p>Unwilling to admit his wife's criminality, though urged by the King to do
  so in order to save himself, Sir Thomas Lake was unable to make a successful
  defence; and he seemed so much bowed down by affliction and perplexity, that
  sympathy was generally felt for him. Indeed, his dignified deportment and
  reserve gave him some claim to consideration.</p>

  <p>In this way was the trial brought to a close, after three days'
  duration.</p>

  <p>Now, let a glance be cast round the room wherein the lords of the Council
  were deliberating upon their judgment.</p>

  <p>It was the Star-Chamber.</p>

  <p>Situated on the south-eastern side of Westminster Hall, near the river,
  this famous room,&mdash;wherein the secret councils of the kingdom were then
  held, and had been held during many previous reigns,&mdash;was more
  remarkable for the beauty of its ceiling than for size or splendour. That
  ceiling was of oak, richly carved and gilt, and disposed in squares, in the
  midst of which were roses, portculises, pomegranates, and fleurs-de-lys. Over
  the door leading to the chamber was placed a star, in allusion to its name,
  with the date 1602. Its walls were covered with ancient tapestry, and it had
  many windows looking towards the river, and filled with painted glass.</p>

  <p>Though it would appear to be obvious enough, much doubt has been
  entertained as to the derivation of the name of this celebrated Court. "Some
  think it so called," writes the author of a learned treatise on its
  jurisdiction, before cited, "of <i>Crimen Stellionatus</i>, because it
  handleth such things and cases as are strange and unusual: some of
  <i>Stallen</i>. I confess I am in that point a Platonist in opinion, that
  <i>nomina naturâ fiunt potiùs quam vagâ impositone</i>. And so I doubt not
  but <i>Camera-Stellata</i> (for so I find it called in our ancient
  Year-books) is most aptly named; not because the Star-Chamber, where the
  Court is kept, is so adorned with stars gilded, as some would have
  it&mdash;for surely the chamber is so adorned because it is the seal of that
  Court, <i>et denominatio</i>, being <i>à praestantiori magis dignum trahit ad
  se minus</i>; and it was so fitly called, because the stars have no light but
  what is cast upon them from the sun by reflection, being his representative
  body, and, as his Majesty was pleased to say when he sat there in his royal
  person, representation must need cease when the person is present. So in the
  presence of his great majesty, the which is the sun of honour and glory, the
  shining of those stars is put out, they not having any power to pronounce any
  sentence in this Court&mdash;for the judgment is the King's only; but by way
  of advice they deliver their opinions, which his wisdom alloweth or
  disalloweth, increaseth or moderateth at his royal pleasure." This
  explanation, which seems rather given for the purpose of paying a fulsome
  compliment to James, in whose reign the treatise in question was written, is
  scarcely satisfactory; and we have little doubt that the name originated in
  the circumstance of the roof of the chamber being embellished with gilded
  stars. We are told in Strype's Stowe, that the Star-Chamber was "so called,
  either by derivation from the old English word <i>Steoran</i>, which
  signifieth to steer or rule, as doth the pilot of a ship; because the King
  and Council did sit here, as it were, at the <i>stern</i>, and did govern in
  the ship of the Commonwealth. Some derive in from <i>Stellio</i>, which
  signifies that starry and subtle beast so called. From which cometh the word
  <i>stellionatus</i>, that signifieth <i>cosenage</i>; because that crime was
  chiefly punishable in this Court by an extraordinary power, as it was in the
  civil law. Or, because the roof of this Court was garnished with gilded
  stars, as the room itself was starry, or full of windows and lights. In which
  respect some of the Latin Records name it <i>Camera Stellata;</i> the French
  <i>Chambre des Ètoiles;</i> and the English the Starred Chamber." The
  derivation of the name, we repeat, seems to us sufficiently simple and
  obvious; but as it has been matter of controversy, we have thought it worth
  while to advert to the circumstance.</p>

  <p>To proceed. In a chair of state, elevated above the table round which the
  Lords of the Council were gathered, and having a canopy over it, sat the
  King, calmly watching them as they pursued their deliberations,&mdash;his own
  mind being completely made up as to the sentence he should
  pronounce&mdash;and ever and anon stealing a glance at Lady Lake and her
  husband, who were seated behind a bar that crossed the room below the
  Council-table. The defendants, or prisoners&mdash;for such in effect they
  were&mdash;were under the guard of a pursuivant and a serjeant-at-arms. A
  little behind them was Sarah Swarton; but, though faint and frightened, and
  scarcely able to sustain herself, she was not allowed a seat. On a raised
  bench at the side sat the beautiful Countess of Exeter, radiant with smiles
  and triumph. She was receiving the congratulations of several dames of high
  rank by whom she was accompanied. Amongst the Judges of the Court were the
  Lord Chancellor, who sat immediately under the King, with his mace and seal
  before him; the Lord Treasurer and the Keeper of the Privy Seal; the
  President of the Council; the Judges; the Archbishop of Canterbury, and eight
  bishops and other prelates; and all the dukes, marquises, earls, and barons
  composing the Privy Council, to the number of forty. Besides these, there
  were present Prince Charles, three of the lieger ambassadors, and many other
  distinguished persons. Though all had gone against her, Lady Lake's spirit
  was still undiminished, and she eyed the Council imperiously; but her
  husband's regards were fixed upon the ground, and his head rested upon his
  breast.</p>

  <p>After some further time had been needlessly consumed by the Council in
  stating their opinions to the King, he prepared to deliver judgment. On this
  the defendants arose, and profound silence reigned throughout the Court as
  James addressed them.</p>

  <p>The sentence was to this effect:&mdash;A fine of upwards of £22,000 was
  imposed upon Sir Thomas, with a further censure of imprisonment in the Tower,
  during the King's pleasure. Lady Lake was to be imprisoned with him. A public
  recognition of their offence, for reparation of the Countess's injured
  honour, was to be made by them, in the most ample manner His Majesty could
  devise. Sarah Swarton was adjudged to the Fleet. "Thence," ran the sentence,
  "to be whipped at the cart's tail to Westminster, and afterwards from the
  same place to Cheapside. At Cheapside to be branded with F.A. (signifying
  <i>false accusation</i>), one letter on either cheek. To do public penance in
  Saint Martin's Church. To be detained in the Fleet till they do weary of her;
  and then to be sent to Bridewell, there to spend and end her days."</p>

  <p>When the poor handmaiden heard this severe sentence, she uttered a cry of
  despair, and fell down on the floor in a swoon.</p>

  <p>Thereupon the delinquents were removed; and as Lady Lake withdrew, a look
  passed between her and the Countess, which, in spite of the assurance of the
  latter, made her turn pale, and tremble.</p>

  <p>In a very remarkable letter, subsequently addressed by Lady Lake to her
  successful opponent in this great case, she said:&mdash;"I wish my submission
  could make you an innocent woman, and wash you as white as a swan; but it
  must be your own submission unto God, and many prayers, and tears, and
  afflictions, which, seeing you have not outwardly, examine your heart, and
  think on times past, and remember what I have written to you heretofore. The
  same I do now again, for I yet nothing doubt, but that, although the Lord
  Roos was sent away, and is dead, yet truth lives." The truth, however, was
  never fully brought to light; and that justice which the vindictive lady
  expected was denied her.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-28"
     name="ch2-28">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br>
  The Two Warrants.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At the conclusion of the trial, James was observed to smile,
  and Buckingham, who had drawn near the chair of state, ventured to inquire
  what it was that entertained his Majesty.</p>

  <p>"Our fancy has been tickled by a curious conceit," answered the King. "We
  discern a singular similitude between the case we hae just heard, and the
  transgression of our first parents."</p>

  <p>"How so, your Majesty?" asked the favourite.</p>

  <p>"As thus," replied James. "Sir Thomas Lake may be likened to our gude
  Father Adam, wha fell into sin frae listening to the beguilements of
  Eve&mdash;Mither Eve being represented by his dochter, my Lady Roos&mdash;and
  ye will own that there cannot be a closer resemblance to the wily auld
  serpent than we find in my Lady Lake."</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" cried Buckingham, joining in the royal laughter; "but before
  your Majesty quits that seat, I must entreat you to perform that which I know
  you delight in&mdash;an act of justice."</p>

  <p>"Anither act of justice, ye should say, my Lord," returned James in a tone
  of slight rebuke; "seeing we hae just delivered a maist memorable judgment in
  a case which has cost us five days of incessant labour and anxious
  consideration. But what is it ye require at our hands? In whose behalf are we
  to exercise our prerogative?"</p>

  <p>"In that of Sir Jocelyn Mounchensey, my gracious Liege," replied
  Buckingham, "who has been committed to the Fleet for contempt of this high
  and honourable Court, and can only be released by your Majesty's warrant. As
  I was myself present on the occasion, when the intemperate expressions laid
  to his charge were used, I can affirm that he was goaded on by his enemies to
  utter them; and that in his calmer moments he must have regretted his
  rashness."</p>

  <p>"Ye shall have the warrant, my Lord," said James, with a smile. "And it
  does ye meikle credit to have made the request. The punishment Sir Jocelyn
  has already endured is amply sufficient for the offence; and we hae nae fears
  of its being repeated. A single visit to the Fleet is eneuch for any man. But
  in respect to Sir Jocelyn, I am happy to say that his Excellency the Conde de
  Gondomar has quite set him right in our gude opinion; and has satisfactorily
  proved to us that the spy we suspected him to be was anither person, wha
  shall be nameless. Ha! here comes the Count himself," he exclaimed, as the
  Spanish Ambassador approached. "Your Excellency will be glad to hear, after
  the handsome manner you have spoken of him, that it is our intention to
  restore Sir Jocelyn to the favour he previously enjoyed. My Lord of
  Buckingham is to have a warrant for his release from the Fleet, and we shall
  trust to see him soon at Court as heretofore."</p>

  <p>"While your Majesty is in this gracious mood," said De Gondomar, bending
  lowly, "suffer me to prefer a request respecting a person of very inferior
  consequence to Sir Jocelyn&mdash;but one in whom I nevertheless take an
  interest&mdash;and who is likewise a prisoner in the Fleet."</p>

  <p>"And ye require a warrant for his liberation&mdash;ah, Count?"</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty has said it," replied De Gondomar, again bending lowly.</p>

  <p>"What is the nature of his offence?" demanded the King.</p>

  <p>"A trifling outrage upon myself," returned the Ambassador;&mdash;"a mere
  nothing, your Majesty."</p>

  <p>"Ah! I know whom you mean. You refer to that rascally apprentice, Dick
  Taverner," cried James. "Call ye his attack upon you a trifling
  outrage&mdash;a mere nothing, Count. I call it a riot&mdash;almost a
  rebellion&mdash;to assault an ambassador."</p>

  <p>"Whatever it may be, I am content to overlook it," said De Gondomar; "and,
  in sooth, the knaves had received some provocation."</p>

  <p>"Aweel, since your Excellency is disposed to view it in that light,"
  rejoined James&mdash;"since ye display such generosity towards your enemies,
  far be it from us to oppose your wishes. The order for the 'prentice's
  release shall be made out at the same time as Sir Jocelyn's. My Lord of
  Buckingham will give orders to that effect to the Clerk of the Court, and we
  will attach our sign manual to the warrants. And now&mdash;have ye not done?"
  he continued, observing that Buckingham still lingered. "Have ye any mair
  requests to prefer?"</p>

  <p>"I had some request to make on the part of the Prince, my Liege," replied
  the Marquis; "but his Highness, I perceive, is about to speak to you
  himself."</p>

  <p>As he said this, Prince Charles, who had occupied a seat among the
  Council, drew near, and stepping upon the elevation on which the chair of
  state was placed, so as to bring himself on a level with his royal father,
  made a long and apparently important communication to him in a very low tone.
  James listened to what was said by his son with great attention, and seemed
  much surprised and indignant at the circumstances, whatever they were,
  related to him. Ever and anon, he could not repress a great oath, and, but
  for the entreaties of Charles, would have given vent to an explosion of
  choler, which must have betrayed the secret reposed to his keeping. Calming
  himself, however, as well as he could, he at length said, in a low
  tone&mdash;"We confide the matter to you, since you desire it, for we are
  assured our dear son will act worthily and well as our representative. Ye
  shall be clothed with our authority, and have power to punish these heinous
  offenders as ye see fit. We will confirm your judgments, whatever they be,
  and sae will our Preevy Council."</p>

  <p>"I must have power to pardon, as well as to punish, my gracious Liege,"
  said Charles.</p>

  <p>"Ye shall hae baith," answered the King; "but the distinction is needless,
  since the ane is comprehended in the ither. Ye shall have our ain seal, and
  act as if ye were King yersel'&mdash;as ye will be ane of these days. Will
  that content ye?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," replied Charles, gratefully kissing his royal father's hand.
  And, descending from the platform, he proceeded to join Buckingham and De
  Gondomar, with whom he held a brief whispered conference.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the two warrants were made out, and received the royal
  signature; after which James quitted the Court, and the Council broke up.</p>

  <p>The warrants having been delivered by the clerk to Buckingham, were
  entrusted by the latter to Luke Hatton, who, it appeared, was waiting for
  them in the outer gallery; and, after the latter had received some directions
  respecting them from the Marquis, he hastened away.</p>

  <p>As he passed through New Palace-yard, Luke Hatton encountered a tall man
  muffled in a long black cloak. A few words were exchanged between them, and,
  the information gained by the individual in the cloak seemed perfectly
  satisfactory to him. So he went his way, while Luke Hatton repaired to the
  Fleet Prison.</p>

  <p>There he was at once admitted to the ward wherein Sir Jocelyn was
  confined, and announced to him the glad tidings of his restoration to
  freedom. By this time Sir Jocelyn was perfectly recovered from the injuries
  he had received from the jailer, during his struggle with Sir Giles
  Mompesson, so that there was no obstacle to his removal, and his natural wish
  was to quit the prison at once; but such cogent reasons were assigned by Luke
  Hatton for his remaining there for another day, that he could not but
  acquiesce in them. Indeed, when all the circumstances were explained to him,
  as they were, by the apothecary, he could not but approve of the plan, which,
  it appeared, was about to be acted upon in the next day for the punishment of
  his enemies; and it then became evident why Sir Giles should not be made
  acquainted with his release, which must be the case if the warrant were
  immediately acted upon. Neither the deputy-warden nor the jailer&mdash;both
  of whom, as he knew, were the extortioner's creatures&mdash;were to be
  informed of it till the last moment. Certain disclosures respecting Clement
  Lanyere, which were made by Luke Hatton to the young knight, affected him
  very deeply, and plunged him for a long time in painful thought.</p>

  <p>Quitting the cell of the more important prisoner, Luke Hatton proceeded to
  that of the apprentice, whom he acquainted with his good fortune, holding out
  to him certain prospects of future happiness, which drove poor Dick nearly
  distracted. At the suggestion of his new friend, the 'prentice wrote a letter
  to Gillian Greenford, conjuring her, by the love she bore him, and by their
  joint hopes of a speedy union, implicitly to comply with the directions of
  the bearer of the note&mdash;whatever they might be: and, armed with this,
  Luke Hatton quitted the Meet, and, procuring a horse, rode off, at a rapid
  pace, to Tottenham.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-29"
     name="ch2-29">CHAPTER XXIX<br>
  The Silver Coffer.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Within Sir Giles Mompesson's vast and gloomy mansion, it has
  been said there were certain rooms which, from their size and splendour,
  formed a striking contrast to the rest of the habitation. Never
  used,&mdash;except on extraordinary occasions, when their owner gave a grand
  entertainment with some ulterior object,&mdash;these apartments,
  notwithstanding their magnificence, partook in some degree of the chilling
  and inhospitable character of the house. Even when brilliantly lighted up,
  they wanted warmth and comfort; and though the banquets given within them
  were sumptuous and profuse, and the wine flowed without stint, the guests
  went away dissatisfied, and railing against their ostentatious host. Thus,
  though the stone walls were hung with rich tapestry, the dust had gathered
  thickly upon its folds, while portions of the rugged masonry were revealed to
  view. The furniture was massive, but cumbrous and ill-assorted; and the
  gilded ceiling and Venetian mirrors, from want of care, had become tarnished
  and dim.</p>

  <p>Such as they were, however, these apartments were assigned to Aveline,
  when she was forcibly brought to the extortioner's habitation, as before
  narrated. Allowed to range within them at pleasure, she was kept strictly
  within their limits. The doors were constantly guarded by one or other of the
  myrmidons; and any communication with the external world was impossible,
  because the windows were partially grated, and looked into a court-yard.
  Beyond this, she was subjected to no restraint; and her own attendants, Dame
  Sherborne and old Anthony Rocke, were suffered to remain with her.</p>

  <p>Had it not been for her exposure to the annoyance of frequent from Sir
  Francis Mitchell, and her anxiety about Sir Jocelyn, Aveline would not have
  found her confinement so intolerable. But the enamoured old usurer persecuted
  her at all hours, and she could never be free from the intrusion, since the
  doors could not be shut against him. Sometimes, he came accompanied by his
  partner, though more frequently alone, but ever with the same
  purpose,&mdash;namely, that of protesting the violence of his passion, and
  seeking to soften her obduracy. As may be well supposed, his pleadings,
  however urged, were wholly ineffectual, and excited no other feelings, except
  those of detestation, in her bosom. Such a state of things could not endure
  for ever; and her only hope was, that finding all his efforts to move her
  fruitless, he would in time desist from them. Not that she was without other
  fearful apprehensions, which were shared by her attendants.</p>

  <p>Nearly a fortnight had thus passed by, when, one day, during which she had
  seen nothing of her tormentor, and was rejoicing at the circumstance, the
  repast usually served at noon was brought in by a fresh serving-man.
  Something in this person's manner, and in the meaning glance he fixed upon
  her attracted her attention; otherwise, he was a man of singularly
  unprepossessing appearance. She addressed a few words to him, but he made no
  reply, and became suddenly as reserved as his predecessor had been. This
  deportment, however, it presently appeared, was only assumed. While placing a
  flask of wine on the table, the man said in a low tone&mdash;"I am a friend
  of Sir Jocelyn. Constrain yourself, or you will betray me. Sir Francis is
  watching us from an eyelet-hole in the door. Drink of this," he added,
  pouring wine into a goblet.</p>

  <p>"Is it medicated?" she asked in a whisper, regarding him anxiously.</p>

  <p>"It is supposed to be so," he answered, with a scarcely perceptible smile.
  "Drink, I say. If you do not, you will mar my project. 'Tis well!" he added,
  as she raised the goblet to her lips. "A few words must explain my design.
  Sir Francis will fancy you have swallowed a love-potion. Take care not to
  undeceive him, for on that belief rests your safety. When he presents
  himself, as he will do shortly, do not repulse him as heretofore. Smile on
  him as kindly as you can; and though the task of duping him may be difficult
  and distasteful to you, shrink not from it. The necessity of the case
  justifies the deception. If he presses his suit, no longer refuse him your
  hand."</p>

  <p>"I cannot do it," murmured Aveline, with a shudder.</p>

  <p>"You MUST," rejoined Luke Hatton&mdash;for it was he&mdash;"or incur worse
  dangers. Provoked by your resistance, Sir Francis has lost all patience, and
  is determined to accomplish his purpose. Knowing my skill as a brewer of
  philters, he has applied to me, and I have promised him aid. But have no
  fear. Though employed by him, I am devoted to you, and will effect your
  deliverance&mdash;ay, and avenge you upon your persecutors at the same
  time&mdash;if you follow my instructions exactly. Raise the goblet to your
  lips again. Quaff its contents without apprehension&mdash;they are perfectly
  harmless. Force smiles to your features&mdash;give tenderness to your tones,
  and softness to your glances&mdash;and all will be won."</p>

  <p>And with a grin, which, though intended to encourage her, somewhat alarmed
  Aveline, he took up the flask of wine and departed.</p>

  <p>As her singular adviser had predicted, it was not long before the old
  usurer made his appearance, evidently full of eagerness to ascertain whether
  any change had been wrought in her disposition towards him by the
  wonder-working draught. Dissembling her aversion as well as she could, and
  assuming looks very foreign to her feelings, she easily succeeded in
  persuading him that the philter had taken effect, and that all obstacles to
  his happiness were removed. Transported with rapture, he fell upon his knees,
  and besought her to crown his felicity by consenting to their union on the
  following day. Bewildered by various emotions, yet still managing to play her
  part, she returned an answer, which he construed into an affirmative; and now
  quite beside himself with delight, the amorous old dotard left her.</p>

  <p>The alteration in Aveline's manner and deportment towards her persecutor,
  did not escape the notice of her attendants, and greatly perplexed them. Dame
  Sherborne ventured to remonstrate with her, hoping she could not be in
  earnest; and old Anthony Rocke bluntly told her he would rather see her in
  her grave than the bride of such a hoary reprobate as Sir Francis. Aware that
  her actions were watched, Aveline thought it best to dissemble, even with her
  attendants; and they were both convinced she was either bewitched or had lost
  her senses; and in either case bitterly deplored her fate.</p>

  <p>Nor must it be supposed that Aveline herself was without much secret
  misgiving, however skilfully and courageously she might act her part. The
  appearance of Luke Hatton, as we have more than once remarked, was calculated
  to inspire distrust in all brought in contact with him; and with no other
  proofs of his sincerity except such as were furnished by the circumstances,
  she might well entertain suspicion of him. While professing devotion, he
  might intend to betray her. In that event, if driven to extremity, she
  resolved to liberate herself by the only means that would then be left
  her.</p>

  <p>In the evening, Luke Hatton paid her a second visit; and on this occasion
  comported himself with as much caution as at first. He applauded her conduct
  towards Sir Francis, whom he stated to be most effectually duped, and
  counselled her to persevere in the same course; adding, with his customary
  sardonic grin, that grand preparations were making for the wedding-feast, but
  he thought the cook's labours likely to be thrown away.</p>

  <p>Next day, Aveline found all her counsellor had told her was correct.
  Several of the rooms, hitherto thrown open to her&mdash;in especial the great
  banquetting-chamber&mdash;were now closed; and it was evident from the sounds
  that reached her ear&mdash;footsteps hurrying to and fro, loud impatient
  voices, and noises occasioned by the removal of furniture, and the placing of
  chairs and tables, together with the clatter of plates and dishes&mdash;that
  preparations for a festival were going on actively within them. Nothing could
  equal the consternation and distress exhibited by Dame Sherborne and old
  Anthony Rocke; but, faithful to her scheme, Aveline (however she desired it)
  did not relieve their anxiety.</p>

  <p>At noon, Luke Hatton came again. He seemed in great glee; and informed her
  that all was going on as well as could be desired. He counselled her to make
  two requests of Sir Francis. First, that he should endow her with ten
  thousand marks, to be delivered to her before the nuptials; secondly, that
  she should be permitted to shroud her features and person in a veil during
  the marriage ceremony. Without inquiring the meaning of these requests,
  which, indeed, she partly conjectured, Aveline promised ready compliance; and
  her adviser left her, but not till he had once more proffered her the
  supposed philter, and caused her to place the cup containing it to her
  lips.</p>

  <p>Ere long, he was succeeded by Sir Francis, arrayed like a bridegroom, in
  doublet and hose of white satin, thickly laid with silver lace, and a short
  French mantle of sky-blue velvet, branched with silver flowers, white roses
  in his shoes, and drooping white plumes, arranged <i>à l'Espagnolle,</i> in
  his hat. Besides this, he was trimmed, curled, oiled, and would have got
  himself ground young again, had such a process been practicable.</p>

  <p>But though he could not effect this, he did the next thing to it, and
  employed all the restoratives suggested by Luke Hatton. He bathed in milk,
  breakfasted on snail-broth, and swallowed a strange potion prepared for him
  by the apothecary, which the latter affirmed would make a new man of him and
  renovate all his youthful ardour. It certainly had produced an extraordinary
  effect; and when he presented himself before Aveline, his gestures were so
  extravagant, and his looks so wild and unpleasant, that it was with the
  utmost difficulty she repressed a scream. His cheeks were flushed, as if with
  fever, and his eyes dilated and burning with unnatural lustre. He spoke
  almost incoherently, tossing his arms about, and performing the antics of a
  madman. The philter; it was clear, had been given him, and he was now under
  its influence.</p>

  <p>Amid all this strange frenzy, so alarming to Aveline, he dwelt upon
  nothing but his inextinguishable passion, and never for a moment withdrew his
  fevered gaze from her. He told her he would be her slave for life, proud to
  wear her chains; and that she should be absolute mistress of his house and
  all his possessions. On this she mustered up resolution to prefer the
  requests she had been counselled to make; and Sir Francis, who was in no mood
  to refuse her anything, at once acceded to them. He laughed at the notion of
  the veil&mdash;said it was a delicate fancy, and quite charmed him&mdash;but
  as to the ten thousand marks, they were utterly unworthy of her acceptance,
  and she should have thrice the amount delivered to her in a silver coffer
  before the ceremony. With these, and a great many other professions, he
  released her from his presence, which had become well-nigh insupportable.</p>

  <p>After a while, a magnificent bridal-dress of white satin, richly trimmed
  with lace, together with a thick white veil of the largest size, calculated
  to envelope her whole person, were brought her by a young damsel, who told
  her she was engaged to serve her as tire-woman; adding, that "she hoped she
  would be able to satisfy her ladyship, as she had already served the Countess
  of Exeter in that capacity."</p>

  <p>"Why do you call me 'ladyship' child?" said Aveline, without looking at
  her. "I have no right to any such title."</p>

  <p>"But you soon will have," replied the young tire-woman; "as the bride of
  Sir Francis, you must needs be my Lady Mitchell."</p>

  <p>Checking the rejoinder that rose to her lips, Aveline cast her eyes, for
  the first time, on the speaker; and then, to her great surprise, perceived it
  to be her village acquaintance, Gillian Greenford. A significant glance from
  the blue eyes of the pretty damsel impressed her with the necessity of
  caution, and seemed to intimate that Gillian herself was likewise in the
  plot. And so it presently appeared she was; for when the damsel had an
  opportunity of talking quite in private to her new mistress, she informed her
  of the real motive of her coming there.</p>

  <p>"I am engaged, by one who wishes you well, to take your place, sweet
  Mistress Aveline, and to be married in your stead to Sir Francis Mitchell,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"And have you really consented to such an arrangement?" rejoined Aveline.
  "Is it possible you can sacrifice yourself thus?"</p>

  <p>"I am not to be sacrificed," returned the damsel quickly. "If it were so,
  I would never have agreed to the scheme. But I am told I shall get a fortune,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, then the ten thousand marks are for you!" interrupted the other. "I
  now see the meaning of that part of the plan. But what else do you hope to
  accomplish?"</p>

  <p>"The deliverance of my unfortunate lover, Dick Taverner, from the Fleet,"
  she answered.</p>

  <p>"But how is your marrying this wicked old usurer to effect your object?"
  inquired Aveline. "You may save me by the proposed stratagem; but you will
  destroy your own happiness, and all your lover's hopes."</p>

  <p>"No, no, I shall not," replied Gillian, hastily; "I can't tell how it's to
  be managed, but I am quite sure no harm will happen to me, and that Dick's
  restoration to liberty will be the reward of the service&mdash;if such it may
  be called&mdash;that I am about to render you. He wrote to me so
  himself."</p>

  <p>"At least, tell me by whom you are engaged, and I can then judge of the
  probability of the rest happening in the way you anticipate?"</p>

  <p>"Do not question me further, sweet mistress," replied the damsel, "for I
  am bound to secrecy. But thus much I may declare&mdash;I am the agent of one,
  who, for some purposes of his own&mdash;be they what they may&mdash;is
  determined to counteract all Sir Francis's vile machinations against you, as
  well as those of his partner, Sir Giles Mompesson, against your lover, Sir
  Jocelyn Mounchensey. Ah! you understand me now, I perceive, sweet mistress!
  You have been guarded by this unseen but watchful friend, during the whole of
  your confinement in this dreadful habitation; and he has kept an equal watch
  over your lover in the Fleet."</p>

  <p>"What! Is Sir Jocelyn a prisoner in the Fleet?" exclaimed Aveline. "I knew
  it not!"</p>

  <p>"He is; but the period of his deliverance approaches," replied Gillian.
  "The secret friend I spoke of has bided his time, and the hour is at hand
  when full measure of revenge will be dealt upon those two wicked oppressors.
  He has long worked towards it; and I myself, am to be an humble instrument
  towards the great end."</p>

  <p>"You astonish me!" cried Aveline, greatly surprised at the change in the
  damsel's manner as well as by what she said.</p>

  <p>"Do not perplex yourself, fair mistress," pursued Gillian. "All will be
  speedily made known to you. But now, no more time must be lost, and we must
  each assume the character we have to enact. As I am to be the bride, and you
  the tire-woman, you must condescend to aid me in putting on these rich robes
  and then disguise yourself in my rustic attire. We are both pretty nearly of
  a size, so there is little risk of detection in that particular; and if you
  can but conceal your features for a short while, on Sir Francis's entrance,
  the trick will never be discovered. All the rest has been arranged; and I am
  a mere puppet in the hands of others, to be played as they direct. Bless us!
  how beautiful this dress is, to-be-sure!&mdash;what satin!&mdash;and what
  lace! The Countess of Exeter has just such another. Have you heard that her
  ladyship has gained her cause against those wicked Lakes, who conspired
  against her? But what am I saying&mdash;when I know you cannot have heard of
  it! Well, then, it occupied five days in the Star-Chamber; and Sir Thomas and
  his lady are sent to the Tower, and Sarah Swarton to the Fleet. Poor
  creature! she is to be whipped and branded, and to do penance in Saint
  Martin's church. Dreadful! but I won't think of it. I wonder how this dress
  will become me! How astounded Dick Taverner would be, if he could only see me
  in it! Mayhap he will&mdash;there's no saying. And now, fair mistress, may I
  crave your aid?"</p>

  <p>While Gillian was thus running on, she had partially disrobed herself, and
  very soon afterwards was decked out in the rich attire, the effect of which
  upon her own person she was so desirous of ascertaining. When her toilet was
  complete, she could not help running up to a mirror, and on seeing the
  reflection of her well-formed figure now displayed to unwonted advantage, she
  clapped her hands and cried out with girlish delight.</p>

  <p>Allowing her to gratify her feelings of vanity by the contemplation of her
  pretty person for a few minutes, Aveline felt it necessary to recal her to
  her situation, and her own transformation into the tire-woman was speedily
  effected,&mdash;Gillian's dress fitting her exactly. The light-hearted damsel
  was quite as much pleased with this change as with the other&mdash;and vowed
  that Aveline looked far better in the rustic gown, than she herself did in
  the silken attire.</p>

  <p>But time pressed; and as Sir Francis might surprise them, they hastened to
  complete their arrangements. Gillian's comely features, as well as her
  sumptuous robe, had to be obscured by the envious veil; and as it was thrown
  over her, she could not help heaving a sigh. Aveline then put on the muffler
  which had been worn by the country damsel, and their disguises were
  complete.</p>

  <p>Not a minute too soon. At this juncture a tap was heard at a door
  communicating with the adjoining apartment, and the voice of the old usurer
  was heard inquiring whether his bride was ready. An answer in the affirmative
  was given by Aveline, and, with a throbbing heart and faltering steps,
  Gillian prepared to obey the summons.</p>

  <p>The door was thrown open, and mustering up all her resolution, she passed
  through it. Both Sir Francis and his partner were waiting to receive her. The
  latter was richly attired, but had not changed the sombre hue of his
  habiliments, even for the anticipated ceremonial, being clad, as usual, in
  black. In this respect he offered marked contrast to the gay apparel of the
  antiquated bridegroom, as well as by the calmness of his deportment and the
  stern gravity of his looks. Behind them stood Luke Hatton, bearing a heavy
  silver coffer, of antique workmanship.</p>

  <p>"What means this veil?" cried Sir Giles, gazing suspiciously at Gillian as
  she emerged from the inner room, followed cautiously by Aveline, who was
  wrapped in the muffler. "Why are the bride's features thus hidden?"</p>

  <p>"A mere whim, Sir Giles&mdash;a pleasant fancy," replied the old usurer.
  "But she must have her way. I mean to indulge her in everything."</p>

  <p>"You are wrong," rejoined the extortioner. "Make her feel you will be her
  master. Bid her take it off."</p>

  <p>"On no account whatever, Sir Giles. I have only won her by submission, and
  shall I spoil all at the last moment, by opposing her inclinations? Of a
  truth not."</p>

  <p>"Who is the maiden with her?" demanded Sir Giles, scrutinizing Aveline,
  with a keen glance. "Why does she wear a muffler? Is that a whim,
  likewise?"</p>

  <p>"Perchance it is," replied Sir Francis; "but I have given no consent to
  it. She is only the tire-woman."</p>

  <p>"Come, mistress, unmuffle. Let us see your face," cried Sir Giles,
  striding towards the terrified maiden, who thought discovery was now
  inevitable.</p>

  <p>But Luke Hatton interposed to save her.</p>

  <p>"Prevent this rudeness," he whispered, plucking Sir Francis's cloak.
  "Prevent it instantly. If her whim be thwarted, I will not answer for the
  consequences."</p>

  <p>"Desist, Sir Giles&mdash;desist, I pray you!" cried the old usurer, in
  alarm. "It is my bride's wish that her attendant be not interfered
  with&mdash;and mine too."</p>

  <p>"Well, be it as you will," replied the extortioner, testily. "But I would
  not permit the impertinence were I in your case. The bride must raise her
  veil when she stands before the priest."</p>

  <p>"She shall do as she pleases," replied Sir Francis, gallantly. "If she
  desires to hide her blushes, I will not put any compulsion upon her to
  disclose them. Come, fair mistress," he added, taking the trembling hand of
  the veiled maiden, "the priest awaits us in the further chamber, where the
  ceremony is to take place, and where several of the noble and illustrious
  guests who have consented to grace our nuptials are already assembled. Some
  of the most illustrious personages in the land will be present&mdash;the
  Marquis of Buckingham, and perhaps Prince Charles himself. His Excellency the
  Spanish Ambassador has promised to come. Let us on, then. Yet, ere we proceed
  further, I have to request your acceptance of that silver coffer. The thirty
  thousand marks within it constitute your dowry."</p>

  <p>As he spoke Luke Hatton advanced, and, holding the coffer towards the
  veiled damsel, so that she could touch it, said&mdash;"Place your hand upon
  this silver box, and take possession of it, fair mistress. I am a witness
  that Sir Francis Mitchell has freely bestowed it, with its contents, upon
  you. It will remain in my custody till you require me to deliver it up to
  you."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-30"
     name="ch2-30">CHAPTER XXX.<br>
  How the Marriage was interrupted.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">After the presentation of the silver casket, as before
  described, the whole of the bridal party, with the exception of Aveline, who
  contrived to remain behind, passed on into the adjoining chamber, where the
  priest was understood to be in waiting to perform the marriage ceremony.</p>

  <p>Apprehensive of the consequences of the discovery which must inevitably be
  soon made, Aveline would have flown back to her own room, but was deterred,
  from the strange noises and confusion she heard within it. Uncertain how to
  act, she at last resolved upon attempting an escape from the house, and was
  hurrying forward, in the hope of gaining the corridor unperceived, but the
  sound of voices outside again drove her back; and, in this new dilemma, she
  had nothing left but to take refuge behind the tapestry covering the walls,
  which being fortunately loose and hanging upon the ground, effectually
  concealed her.</p>

  <p>Scarcely was she screened from observation in this manner, when the door
  was thrown open, and a crowd of young gallants&mdash;evidently, from their
  bearing and the richness of their attire, of high rank&mdash;entered the
  apartment. Without exposing herself, Aveline was enabled, through the folds
  of the tapestry, to command a view of what was going forward. The youthful
  nobles&mdash;for such they were&mdash;who had just come in, were laughing
  loudly; and their jests were chiefly at the expense of the old usurer, whose
  marriage they had been invited to attend.</p>

  <p>After looking round for a moment, as if in search of some one to direct
  them whither to go, the foremost of them clapped his hands, whereupon the
  thick curtains which, in lieu of a door, guarded the entrance to the other
  room, were drawn aside, and disclosed a group of persons collected together
  within that chamber. In the midst of them were the bride and
  bridegroom&mdash;the former still enveloped in her veil&mdash;together with
  the priest and his assistant. At this sight, the band of youthful nobles set
  up a shout of laughter, and rushed tumultuously forward, while the curtains,
  dropping to their place, closed upon the scene.</p>

  <p>Presently the outer door again opened, and this time to admit three
  persons, all of whom were magnificently dressed, and apparently of yet higher
  rank than those who had preceded them. As they were masked, their features
  could not be discerned; but they were all distinguished by rare personal
  grace. One of them, indeed, was remarkable for symmetry of figure, and his
  finely-proportioned limbs were arrayed in habiliments of the most splendid
  material, adorned with pearls and precious stones, and richly embroidered.
  Yet he did not seem to hold the chief place among them: that, by common
  consent, seemed accorded to a young man clad in black velvet, who, by the
  majesty of his deportment and the gravity of his manner, appeared to exercise
  a certain sway over his companions, and to be treated by them, when he spoke,
  with marked respect. The third individual was habited in a Spanish-cloak of
  murrey-velvet, lined with cloth of silver, branched with murrey-flowers, and
  wore a chain of gold, richly set with precious stones, round his neck, from
  which depended the order of the Golden Fleece.</p>

  <p>There was something in the presence of these three important personages
  that gave Aveline a feeling of security, such as she had not experienced
  since her forcible detention by the two extortioners, and she almost felt
  inclined to throw herself at the feet of the one who appeared to be the
  principal of them, and solicit his protection. But before she could execute
  her half-formed design, the party had approached the entrance of the nuptial
  chamber; and the curtain being raised for their admittance, excluded them,
  the next moment, from her view.</p>

  <p>All now appearing quiet, she again ventured from her hiding-place, and
  speeded towards the door communicating with the gallery. But her departure
  was unexpectedly interrupted by the sudden entrance of another masked
  personage, tall in stature, and habited entirely in black; and in him she
  could not fail to recognise the messenger employed by Sir Giles Mompesson to
  bring her, in the first instance, to his habitation. Circumstances had
  subsequently occurred to induce her to change her opinion respecting this
  mysterious individual. Nevertheless, his appearance at this juncture would
  have caused her to utter a cry of terror, if she had not been reassured by
  the timely appearance of one upon whom she had reliance, and who raised his
  finger to his lips in token of silence. This was Luke Hatton, who, at the
  very moment that Lanyere appeared, issued from the chamber where the marriage
  ceremony was being performed.</p>

  <p>"Be not alarmed, fair maiden," said Lanyere, in a low voice, "you are in
  no danger; and all your troubles, I trust, are well-nigh ended. I thought you
  were in the marriage-chamber. Give me your hand. You must assist at the mock
  ceremonial taking place within there. I have no time for explanations; and
  indeed they are needless, since all will be speedily made clear to you.
  Divest yourself, I pray you, of this muffler. It is part of my plan that your
  features should now be revealed. You will understand why, anon."</p>

  <p>With this, he led her quickly towards the entrance of the inner chamber;
  and, pushing aside the curtain, advanced a few steps beyond it, still holding
  her by the hand, and followed by Luke Hatton.</p>

  <p>The apartment, which was of considerable size and splendidly furnished,
  was full of wedding-guests, grouped around that portion of it which was
  railed off for the accommodation of those more immediately connected with the
  ceremonial, amongst whom, as a matter of course, was Sir Giles Mompesson.</p>

  <p>Somewhat apart from the others were the three important persons who had
  arrived last; and the most exalted among them was seated on a raised chair,
  contemplating the scene, while his companions stood near him. They had now
  taken off their masks; and, even in that agitating moment Aveline recognised
  in the trio the Marquis of Buckingham, the Conde de Gondomar, and Prince
  Charles. All the rest of the company remained standing; and some of the young
  nobles formed a small semicircle behind the royal chair.</p>

  <p>Lanyere's entrance with his fair companion could not have been better
  timed. They arrived at the particular juncture when Sir Francis, having
  presented the wedding-ring to the priest was in the act of receiving it back
  from him, in order that it might be placed upon the finger of the bride; and
  the noise made by the promoter, who still wore his vizard, drew all eyes upon
  him, and upon the damsel by whom he was accompanied.</p>

  <p>A smile of intelligence passed between Prince Charles and Buckingham; and
  some remark was made by the latter, to which the Prince replied by a gesture,
  seeming to intimate that the interruption was not altogether unexpected by
  him. De Gondomar's looks also betrayed that he was likewise in the
  secret.</p>

  <p>Others of the company laughed as if in anticipation of a jest; but the
  majority looked surprised&mdash;but none so much so as Sir Giles Mompesson.
  As his eye fell upon the dark and ominous figure of Lanyere, and shifted from
  him to Aveline, he appeared transported with rage; and dashing the ring from
  the hand of the astonished bridegroom (who, having his back toward the
  newcomers, was unaware of what was going forward), exclaimed&mdash;"Proceed
  no further! We have been deceived! Look there!"</p>

  <p>"Where? where?" cried Sir Francis. "What is the matter, Sir Giles? You
  quite terrify me with your fierce looks. Help me to pick up the ring, and let
  the ceremony go on."</p>

  <p>"It is well for you that it is <i>not</i> completed," replied Sir Giles,
  almost black in the face with choler. "You know not whom you are about to
  wed. But we will soon see. Off with your veil, minion! Off with it, I
  say!"</p>

  <p>"Sir Giles, I will not permit this liberty," cried the old usurer. "You
  shall not touch her. Whom should it be but my own dear, delectable
  Aveline?"</p>

  <p>"Look round, I say, and credit your own eyes, since you doubt my
  assertions!" roared Sir Giles.</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand furies!" ejaculated Sir Francis, as he complied with the
  injunction. "Why, there she is, in good truth, when I thought she was by my
  side. Whom, then, have I been about to take to my bosom?"</p>

  <p>"It matters not," replied Sir Giles. "She you desired to wed is yonder,
  and must take the other's place. That is&mdash;but I forget," he added,
  suddenly checking himself, and lowering his tone, "naught can be done, except
  according to rule, in this presence. Your vanity must needs be gratified by
  bringing together all this courtly company to witness your marriage. And now
  they will only mock you."</p>

  <p>"S'death! you are right, Sir Giles," rejoined the old usurer. "I am become
  a mere laughing-stock to my guests. But at least I will see my false bride's
  features. You hear what I say, Madam," he added to Gillian&mdash;"let me
  behold your face without more ado."</p>

  <p>As he uttered the command, the damsel threw off her veil, and stood
  blushing, half-smiling and half-abashed, before the assemblage. Her natural
  charms, heightened by her attire, and by the peculiar situation in which she
  was placed, elicited general admiration.</p>

  <p>"As I live, 'tis the pretty tirewoman from Tottenham, engaged by Luke
  Hatton to attend on Aveline," cried Sir Francis; "but, 'fore Heaven, I have
  gained by the exchange. I like her better than the other, and will go through
  with the ceremony. Proceed, Sir Priest."</p>

  <p>At this declaration there was a shout of laughter from the assemblage; but
  the merriment was increased, when Do Gondomar, stepping up to the bride,
  said, "I forbid the marriage. She belongs to me."</p>

  <p>"But my claim is paramount to that of your Excellency," cried the old
  usurer.</p>

  <p>"I cannot admit it," rejoined the other. "Let the damsel decide for
  herself."</p>

  <p>"Then I will accept neither," said Gillian. "Dick Taverner is already
  master of my heart, and no one but he shall have my hand. I have been brought
  here to play a part, on the clear understanding that nothing serious was to
  come of it."</p>

  <p>"And nothing serious shall come of it, fair maiden," said Prince Charles.
  "I promise that on my princely faith."</p>

  <p>"Then, indeed, I am easy," replied Gillian, inclining herself
  reverentially towards the royal speaker.</p>

  <p>At this juncture, Sir Giles Mompesson, who had been hitherto restrained by
  the presence of the royal guest from any violent measures, was advancing with
  menacing looks towards Lanyere, when the attention of Charles being directed
  to his movements by Buckingham, the Prince instantly arose, and in a tone of
  authority not to be disputed, said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Not a step further, Sir Giles. I will take care that all needful
  explanations be given."</p>

  <p>"But your Highness cannot be aware that this is a heinous offender and
  traitor," rejoined Sir Giles, pointing to Lanyere. "I was about to take means
  to prevent his escape."</p>

  <p>"He has no intention of escaping," rejoined Charles; "and I forbid any one
  to leave this apartment without my permission."</p>

  <p>"Will your Highness suffer me to relieve this fair creature from the
  embarrassing position in which she is placed," said De Gondomar. "The youth
  she has mentioned, and to whom she declares her affections are given, was
  confined in the Fleet Prison for an attack on me; but, on my representation
  of the matter to the King, your father, his Majesty's gracious consent was
  immediately accorded for his liberation."</p>

  <p>"I am aware of it, Count," replied Prince Charles.</p>

  <p>"But your Highness may not be aware that the poor fellow is without,"
  pursued the Ambassador. "Will it please you to allow him to be brought
  in?"</p>

  <p>The Prince assented, on which De Gondomar signed to Luke Hatton, who
  seemed waiting for the order, and, disappearing for a moment, returned with
  the apprentice.</p>

  <p>Though evidently prepared for the scene that awaited him, and not
  overburthened with modesty, Dick Taverner could not help exhibiting
  considerable confusion; but the sight of his mistress somewhat restored him,
  and he pressed towards her. Sir Francis, however, stepped between them,
  exclaiming&mdash;"Get hence, base varlet&mdash;she is my wife."</p>

  <p>"No such thing!" cried Gillian&mdash;"the ceremony has only been half
  performed. I am <i>not</i> married. I am yours&mdash;and yours only, dear,
  sweet Dickon."</p>

  <p>"You never shall be his&mdash;you are mine&mdash;" exclaimed the old
  usurer&mdash;"I implore his Highness the Prince to let the marriage go
  forward."</p>

  <p>"Nay, I shall not allow any compulsion to be placed on the damsel's
  inclinations," replied Charles, unable to repress a smile. "She must choose
  for herself."</p>

  <p>"In that case, your Highness, my choice is soon made," replied Gillian,
  taking her lover's hand.</p>

  <p>"And honest Dickon need not be under any alarm at such part of the
  marriage as has already taken place," observed De Gondomar. "It has been a
  mock ceremonial throughout. This is no priest, but one of my Lord of
  Buckingham's grooms employed for the occasion."</p>

  <p>"Then I have been a dupe all this time!" cried Sir Francis furiously. "O,
  purblind dolt that I am!"</p>

  <p>But he met with no commiseration from the assemblage, who only laughed at
  his rage and absurd grimaces.</p>

  <p>"Kneel and thank his Highness for his goodness," said De Gondomar to the
  young couple; "and then, if he will give you leave to do so, depart at once.
  Stay not a moment longer than you can help it in this house, or in the
  neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>"Most assuredly I will not, your Excellency," returned Dick. "It is much
  too near the Fleet to be agreeable to me. I have to offer my heartfelt thanks
  to your Excellency for your kindly consideration of me, and I own that I have
  scarcely deserved it at your hands."</p>

  <p>"Render your thanks, as I have said, to his Highness, who is alone
  entitled to them, good fellow," said the Ambassador. "Take Gillian home to
  her grandsire&mdash;and wed her as soon as you can. She will need no dowry,"
  he added in a low tone&mdash;"for she is already provided with thirty
  thousand marks."</p>

  <p>"Honestly come by, I hope, your Excellency?" inquired Dick.</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay&mdash;thou suspicious blockhead. Do as I have bidden thee, and get
  hence. More remains to be done to which thou art a hindrance."</p>

  <p>On this, the young couple prostrated themselves before Prince Charles, who
  graciously gave his hand to Gillian to kiss, and then motioning them to rise,
  they were allowed to quit the room.</p>

  <p>Luke Hatton saw them safe out of the house, and very well it was he
  accompanied them, for they had many obstacles to encounter. Before quitting
  them, the apothecary delivered up the silver casket to Dick, bidding him take
  good care of it, as it contained his intended wife's dowry.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Sir Giles Mompesson, who had with difficulty controlled his
  impatience during the incidents previously described, advanced towards Prince
  Charles, and with a profound reverence, said&mdash;"Will it please your
  Highness to terminate this idle scene, which, though apparently amusing to
  the company assembled, is by no means so entertaining to Sir Francis and
  myself?"</p>

  <p>"You shall have your wish, Sir," rejoined Charles in a stern tone and with
  a freezing look, that seemed of ill augury to the extortioner&mdash;"It is my
  intention to terminate the scene. Stand forth, Clement Lanyere and let me
  hear what you have to declare in reference to this man."</p>

  <p>Hereupon, the promoter, consigning Aveline to the care of a gentleman who
  advanced towards her for the purpose, and respectfully took her hand, stepped
  forward, and, removing his mask, confronted his enemy.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-31"
     name="ch2-31">CHAPTER XXXI.<br>
  Accusations.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">By this time a very different complexion had been imparted
  to the scene. The interruption of the marriage ceremony, and the perplexities
  of the old usurer, tricked out of his intended bride, and bereft even of her
  substitute, had afforded abundant amusement to the company, who, so far from
  feeling pity for the sufferer, seemed vastly to enjoy his mortification and
  disappointment. But all laughter died away, and every tongue became suddenly
  mute, as Prince Charles, assuming the severe look and dignified deportment of
  a judge, commanded Clement Lanyere to stand forward, and prefer the charges
  he had to make against Sir Giles Mompesson.</p>

  <p>All eyes were fixed upon the extortioner and his accuser; and though
  etiquette prevented the company from advancing too near the royal seat, a
  dense semicircle was formed in front of it, in the midst of which stood the
  two principal actors in the drama about to take place, together with the
  discomfited Sir Francis Mitchell.</p>

  <p>Sir Giles Mompesson was not without great misgivings. He saw that his case
  was already prejudged by the Prince; and the glance of inquiry with which he
  had consulted his patron, the Marquis of Buckingham, and which was answered
  by a cold, menacing regard, convinced him that little support was to be
  expected in that quarter. Nevertheless, though he felt himself in
  considerable jeopardy, he allowed no look or gesture indicative of uneasiness
  to escape him; and the courage that had borne him through many a trial still
  remained unshaken. Not so Sir Francis Mitchell. He also perceived the
  perilous position in which he and his partner were placed, and his abject
  manner showed how thoroughly he was daunted. Look wherever he would, he found
  no sympathy: every one derided his distress.</p>

  <p>But far more than the two extortioners did their accuser command
  attention. As he cast off his mask and displayed his appalling features, a
  thrill of surprise and horror pervaded such of the assemblage as had never
  seen them before. But the feeling was speedily lost in wonder. Drawing
  himself up to his full height, so that his lofty figure towered above those
  with whom he was confronted, he seemed to dart lightning glances against
  them. Even Sir Giles could not bear his scathing looks, and would have
  shielded himself from them if he could. Though fearful to behold, Lanyere's
  countenance had a terrible purpose impressed upon it which none could
  mistake. The effect produced by his appearance upon the spectators was shared
  even by Prince Charles, and a few minutes elapsed before the silence was
  broken. At length, the Prince again spoke:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I sit here," he said, "as the representative of the Majesty of
  England&mdash;clothed with the authority of my royal father, and prepared to
  exercise it, as he would do were he present in person. But though this seat
  is erected into a tribunal before which accusations against wrong-doers can
  be brought, and sentence upon them pronounced; still, whatever charges are
  now made, and against whomsoever they may be preferred, those charges will
  have to be repeated to the Lords of the Council of the Star-Chamber, before
  whom the accused will be taken; and any judgment now given will have to be
  confirmed by that high and honourable Court. Of late, the course of justice
  has been too often baffled and turned aside by the craft and subtlety of
  certain powerful and audacious offenders. Hence it has been the wish of the
  King's Highness, in order that the laws may no longer be broken with
  impunity, that certain preliminary inquiries and investigations should be
  made on the spot itself, where it is alleged that the crimes and
  misdemeanours have been committed; and, according to the evidence afforded,
  such measures as may be deemed fitting taken against the wrong-doers. All
  present have witnessed this mock ceremonial, and have laughed at its
  conclusion, but mirth will be changed to indignation, when it is known that
  the intended marriage was the result of a vile conspiracy on the part of Sir
  Giles Mompesson and Sir Francis Mitchell, against a young, virtuous, and
  unprotected maiden, whose beauty had inflamed the breast of the elder, and it
  might have been expected from that circumstance, the wiser of the two. Into
  the details of their infamous scheme, it will not be necessary now to enter;
  and it may suffice to say, that the devoted attachment of the damsel to
  another was wholly disregarded, while the basest means were employed to
  induce her consent to a match so abhorrent to her feelings, as must have been
  that with Sir Francis. Failing in this, however, the two conspirators went
  yet further. They forcibly carried off the maiden from her own dwelling, and
  detained her against her will within this house, till by their arts they
  imagined they had gained their point&mdash;and that a love-potion would
  accomplish all for them, that their persuasions and fair promises were unable
  to effect. But the damsel was guarded from all ill by an unseen
  friend&mdash;and the weapons of the conspirators were turned against
  themselves. You have witnessed how they have been duped, and, as no mischief
  has resulted from this infamous endeavour, the mortification they have
  endured may be taken as part punishment of the offence. Stand forward, fair
  Mistress Aveline Calveley, and substantiate what I have just declared."</p>

  <p>Thus adjured, the maiden approached within a few paces of the Prince, and
  having made a lowly salutation, said,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"All that your Highness has advanced concerning me is correct."</p>

  <p>"Enough, fair mistress," rejoined Charles. "How say you, Sirs," he
  continued, in a stern tone, to the two extortioners. "Do you confess your
  guilt, and sue for pardon? If so, down on your knees before this injured
  damsel, and implore her forgiveness!"</p>

  <p>A prey to violent terror, the old usurer instantly adopted the
  supplicatory posture recommended by the Prince; but Sir Giles refused
  compliance.</p>

  <p>"Having committed no offence, I sue for no pardon," he said, with his
  wonted audacity. "I repel the charge with indignation; and, in my turn,
  accuse Clement Lanyere and Luke Hatton of a conspiracy against me. This
  damsel is but their tool, as I will show, if your Highness will deign to give
  ear to me."</p>

  <p>"It were mere waste of time to listen to idle fabrications," replied
  Charles. "The evidence against you is complete, and my opinion upon it is
  formed. But what saith the maiden herself? Is she willing that any grace be
  shown her persecutors?"</p>

  <p>"The redress I have already obtained at the hands of your Highness is
  amply sufficient," replied Aveline. "Great as has been the misery these two
  persons have occasioned me, and grievously as they have sought to injure me,
  I seek no further satisfaction; but would implore your Highness to pardon
  them. Their own thoughts will be punishment enough."</p>

  <p>"Amply sufficient&mdash;for nothing can be more bitter," cried the old
  usurer, while a scornful smile curled Sir Giles's lips.</p>

  <p>"Spoken as I expected you would speak, fair maiden," said Charles; "and,
  were there nothing else against them, I might listen to your kindly
  intercessions. But other and darker disclosures have to be made; and when you
  have heard all, even your compassionate breast may be steeled against them.
  Retire for a moment; but do not leave the room. Your presence may yet be
  needed."</p>

  <p>And bowing graciously to Aveline, she withdrew under the care of the
  gentleman who had brought her forward, but still remained a spectatress of
  the scene.</p>

  <p>"And now to proceed with the investigation," pursued Charles. "What have
  you to allege against the two persons before you?" he added, to Clement
  Lanyere.</p>

  <p>"Were I to relate all their enormities, most gracious Prince," replied the
  promoter, "the recital would be too painful for your hearing, and that of
  this noble assemblage. But I will, in a word, declare that there is no kind
  of outrage, oppression, and extortion of which they have not been guilty.
  Their insatiable greediness has been fed by constant plunder; and, alike
  cruel and rapacious, nothing but the ruin and absolute destruction of their
  victims would content them. Merciless as creditors, they have ground their
  unfortunate debtors to the dust. The tears of the widow they have robbed of
  her husband and her means of existence&mdash;the despair of the orphan, whose
  fair prospects they have blighted&mdash;have failed to move them. Utterly
  unscrupulous as to the means of obtaining possession of property, they have
  forged wills, deeds, and other documents. Their ingenuity has been taxed to
  devise new means of unjust gain; and, imposing upon the King's Majesty by
  false representations, they have succeeded in obtaining his letters patent
  for certain monopolies, which they have so shamefully abused, as to bring his
  sovereign authority into discredit."</p>

  <p>"Hold!" cried Sir Giles Mompesson. "To the first&mdash;vague and general
  accusations brought against me and my co-patentee, by this branded traitor,
  who, having been publicly punished for falsehood and libel, cannot be
  received as a witness, I have deigned no answer, conceiving such accusations
  cannot be for a moment entertained by you, most gracious Prince. But to this
  specific charge, I give a flat denial; and demand proof of it. I appeal to
  the most noble Marquis of Buckingham, through whose interest Sir Francis
  Mitchell and myself obtained those patents for the licences of inspection of
  inns and hostelries, as well as for the manufacture of gold and silver lace,
  whether he has ever heard aught to our disparagement in our conduct of
  them?"</p>

  <p>"Do not appeal to me, Sir," replied Buckingham, coldly.</p>

  <p>"Sir Giles has demanded proof of my charge, and I am prepared to produce
  it," said Lanyere. "As to the vagueness of my accusations, your Highness will
  judge of that when the full catalogue of the offences of these two
  extortioners, with the damnatory proofs of them, shall be laid before you.
  This memorial, signed by nearly the whole of the sufferers from their
  exactions, perpetrated by means of the monopolies, will satisfy your Highness
  of the truth of my statement&mdash;but I have also a witness to call."</p>

  <p>"A witness!&mdash;here!" muttered Sir Giles, uneasily. "This must be a
  deeply-concerted scheme."</p>

  <p>"Before you bring forward any one," said Charles, addressing Lanyere, "Sir
  Giles must be set right on one point in which he is in error. Your
  credibility is not to be disputed, and I accept your testimony against
  him."</p>

  <p>"Your Highness!" cried the extortioner.</p>

  <p>"Peace, Sir! you shall be heard anon," said Charles. "Produce your
  witness," he added to Lanyere.</p>

  <p>At a sign from the promoter, Luke Hatton, who was standing near the
  doorway, stepped behind the tapestry, and almost immediately reappearing with
  Madame Bonaventure, led her towards the Prince, before whom she prostrated
  herself.</p>

  <p>"Arise, Madame," said Charles, graciously. "Your features are not
  unfamiliar to me. Methinks you are the hostess of the French ordinary at the
  tavern of the Three Cranes, in the Vintry."</p>

  <p>"Tour Highness is in the right&mdash;I am Madame Bonaventure, at your
  Highness's service," replied the hostess, enchanted at this recognition on
  the part of the Prince. "My lord of Buckingham, I am well persuaded, will
  condescend to speak to the merits and respectability of my
  establishment."</p>

  <p>"In sooth will I, good hostess," replied the Marquis. "I can give your
  Bordeaux my heartiest commendation. 'Tis the best in London."</p>

  <p>"Nay, I can speak to it myself&mdash;and to the good order of the house
  too; having visited the tavern incognito," remarked the Prince, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible!" exclaimed Madame Bonaventure, rapturously. "Have I been
  so greatly honoured? Mon Dieu!&mdash;and not to be aware of it!"</p>

  <p>"I must remind you of the cause of your appearance here, Madame
  Bonaventure," said Lanyere.</p>

  <p>"You are required to depose before his Highness as to the exactions you
  suffered from Sir Giles and his partner."</p>

  <p>"His Highness shall hear all from me," rejoined the hostess. "I should
  have been reduced to beggary had I submitted to their extortionate usage. I
  bore it as long as I could, but when absolute ruin stared me in the face, I
  had recourse to a noble friend who helped me in my extremity and delivered me
  by a, stratagem."</p>

  <p>"It was a fraudulent scheme," cried Sir Giles;&mdash;"a fraud upon his
  Majesty, as well as upon those who enjoyed the privileges conferred by his
  letters patent."</p>

  <p>"That I can contradict, Sir," said Buckingham, "since I myself was present
  on the occasion, and stated in the hearing of the large company then
  assembled,&mdash;several of whom are now before us,&mdash;that his Majesty
  relinquished all share of the ruinous fine of three thousand marks imposed by
  you and your co-patentee upon this good woman."</p>

  <p>"And I trust you added, my Lord, that the King's Highness would never
  knowingly consent to have his exchequer enriched by such shameful means,"
  said Charles, with a look of indignation. "These monopolies were not granted
  by his Majesty for the wrongful profit of their holders; and, since they have
  been turned to such iniquitous use, I will take upon me to declare that they
  shall all be suppressed. Do you attempt to deny," he continued to Sir Giles,
  "that this outrageous fine was imposed?"</p>

  <p>"It were useless to deny it," replied the extortioner, with a malicious
  look at Buckingham; "but the noble Marquis has not always disapproved so
  strongly of my proceedings. Nay, I can show that he himself has been secretly
  a party to like transactions."</p>

  <p>"Ah, villain!" exclaimed Buckingham,&mdash;"do you venture to calumniate
  your protector? I shall leave you to the fate you so richly merit. Your foul
  and false assertions cannot affect me; but they are not likely to improve
  your case with his Highness, who, though aware of its impotency, will
  perceive the extent of your malice. If you dared, I doubt not you would
  likewise assert that his Majesty himself was cognisant of your frauds and
  oppressions, and approved them."</p>

  <p>"I do assert, and will maintain it&mdash;ay, and prove it, too&mdash;that
  the King's Highness was aware how these monopolies were managed, and derived
  a considerable revenue from them," said Sir Giles.</p>

  <p>"You hear him, Prince," remarked Buckingham, with a disdainful smile.</p>

  <p>"I would not have believed in such matchless effrontery had I not
  witnessed it," replied Charles. "You may retire, Madame," he added to the
  hostess, who, with a profound reverence, withdrew. "Have you aught further to
  declare, or any other witnesses to produce?" he continued to Lanyere.</p>

  <p>"I have both, your Highness," replied the promoter.</p>

  <p>"What more false accusations have you to bring against me?" demanded Sir
  Giles, folding his arms upon his breast, and fixing his keen gaze upon
  Lanyere.</p>

  <p>"His Highness shall hear," replied the promoter. "I have a multitude of
  cases which I could adduce in support of my charges&mdash;all of which will
  be mentioned in due season&mdash;but I shall now content myself with one, and
  from it the nature of the rest may be inferred. But let me premise that, in
  the greater part of these cases, and in all the more important of them, where
  grievous and irreparable wrong has been committed, the engine employed by
  these crafty and dangerous men has been the Star-Chamber."</p>

  <p>"The Star-Chamber!" exclaimed Charles, bending his brows.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness will now perceive the drift of this cunning knave's
  argument," said Sir Giles. "Through me and my partner, all whose actions will
  bear the strictest scrutiny, he would covertly attack that high and
  honourable Court, whose dignity we have ever been most zealous to maintain;
  and his motive for doing so is because he has incurred its censure. When I
  have heard his precise charges, I will reply to them&mdash;ay, one by
  one&mdash;if he will bring forward the multitude of cases he affirms he can
  produce against me. But meanwhile I can fearlessly declare my innocence of
  the wrong imputed to me. If I have been to blame in those monopolies, I am
  not the only one in fault, as time will show. Nay, there are greater culprits
  than I"&mdash;looking hard at Buckingham, who regarded him
  disdainfully&mdash;"but I deny that I have done more than I can fully
  justify. As regards other matters, and the way in which my wealth has been
  acquired, I have acted only with caution, prudence, and foresight. Is it my
  fault that there are so many persons who, from various causes, will have
  money, no matter what they pay for it? If they apply to me under such
  circumstances, and ruin ensues to them, am I to blame? I lend monies as a
  usurer&mdash;all men know it. 'Tis my vocation, and that of my partner; and
  my answer is his answer. We have done nothing beyond the law; and the law,
  which has hitherto supported us, will support us still. To affirm that we
  have employed the highest court of the kingdom as an instrument of oppression
  and extortion is an assertion too monstrous to obtain a moment's credit. The
  Star-Chamber is too jealous of its honour not to resent the imputation; and
  such a charge will not escape its censure."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, at whatever risk, I repeat the accusation," rejoined
  Lanyere; "and my words will not be forgotten by his Highness, and by all
  others who hear them. I assert that Sir Giles Mompesson has subtly and
  designedly perverted the practice of that high and honourable Court, causing
  it to aid his schemes of rapacity and injustice, and using it as a means of
  stifling the cries of his victims, and working out his purposes of vengeance.
  Hitherto, he has succeeded in masking his designs with so much skill that
  they have escaped detection; but when the mischief he has done under the mask
  of justice, and the wrongs and cruelties he has perpetrated in the name of
  the law shall be fully made known, no punishment will be deemed commensurate
  to his crimes. It is chiefly he and his partner who, by their evil doings,
  have brought the Star-Chamber into disrepute, and made it a terror to all
  just men, who have dreaded being caught within the toils woven around it by
  these infamous wretches; and the Court will do well to purge itself of such
  villanies, and make a terrible example of those who have so dishonoured
  it."</p>

  <p>"The Star-Chamber will never desert its faithful servants, and such we
  have been," said Sir Giles.</p>

  <p>"Say rather the serpents it has nourished in its bosom," rejoined Lanyere.
  "But to my case. Years ago, a gentleman possessed of noble estates in
  Norfolk, was unfortunate enough to have some dealings with these two usurers,
  who thus becoming acquainted with his circumstances, marked him for their
  prey. He borrowed a large sum of money from them. The loan was not obtained
  for himself, but for a younger brother"&mdash;here the voice of the promoter
  was choked with emotion, and a few moments elapsed before he could
  proceed&mdash;"I have said that the money was borrowed, not for himself, but
  for a younger brother, whose recklessness and extravagance had plunged him
  deeply in debt. Would that his too generous relative had left him to his
  fate, and allowed him to rot in a dungeon! But he rescued him from it, only
  to take his place in the end. From this sad epoch may all the unfortunate
  gentleman's calamities be dated. Certain title-deeds and other instruments
  had to be deposited with Sir Giles and his partner, as security for repayment
  of the sum borrowed. They were never returned. On the contrary, under one
  plea or another, all the deeds relating to the property were obtained from
  its unsuspecting owner; and then a mortgage deed covering the whole estates
  was forged by them."</p>

  <p>"'Tis false!" exclaimed Sir Giles.</p>

  <p>"Have I your Highness's gracious promise of pardon to all except the
  principals in these great offences?" pursued Lanyere.</p>

  <p>"As it may materially serve the ends of justice that such promise should
  be given, I do not hesitate to comply with your request," replied
  Charles.</p>

  <p>"In that case I shall be able to confound the villains with a witness whom
  they little expect to be produced against them," replied Lanyere. "Let Lupo
  Vulp be called," he added.</p>

  <p>The summons was responded to as before by Luke Hatton, and the next moment
  the ill-favoured scrivener emerged from behind the tapestry, and made his way
  through the assemblage, who recoiled with abhorrence from him, towards the
  Prince.</p>

  <p>"Who art thou?" demanded Charles.</p>

  <p>"I am named Lupo Vulp, your Highness, and have for many years been a
  money-scrivener in the employ of these two gentlemen," replied the individual
  addressed.</p>

  <p>"Thou knowest all their transactions?" said Charles.</p>

  <p>"No man better," answered Lupo; "unless it be Clement Lanyere."</p>

  <p>"You remember a certain deed of mortgage from Sir Ferdinando Mounchensey
  to your two employers?" said Lanyere.</p>

  <p>"I remember it perfectly," returned the scrivener, "as I should do, seeing
  I prepared it myself."</p>

  <p>During all this time Lupo Vulp had kept his eyes upon the ground, and had
  never dared to raise them towards Sir Giles, though he felt that the gaze of
  the latter was fixed upon him.</p>

  <p>"Was Sir Ferdinando's signature attached to that deed?" demanded
  Lanyere.</p>

  <p>"Look at me, Lupo, ere thou answerest," cried Sir Giles. "Look at me
  well&mdash;and take heed what thou say'st."</p>

  <p>"Be not influenced by him," interposed Charles. "Look only at me, and
  speak truly, as thou valuest thy safety. If thou hidest aught, or falsifiest
  aught, the heaviest punishment awaits thee!"</p>

  <p>"Hark ye, Lupo," said Sir Giles, in a low tone. "Be warned by me. Utter a
  word to my detriment, and as surely as thou art suborned to injure me, I will
  hang thee. I <i>can</i> do so, as thou knowest!"</p>

  <p>"Fear him not, Lupo," said Lanyere. "Thou hast his Highness's gracious
  promise of pardon."</p>

  <p>"If my life be but spared, most gracious Prince," said the scrivener,
  falling on his knees, and clasping his hands together in supplication, "I
  will reveal all I know touching the malpractices of these two persons."</p>

  <p>"Speak, then, without fear," said Charles.</p>

  <p>"I repeat my question," said Lanyere, "and demand an explicit answer to
  it. What was the nature of that deed?"</p>

  <p>"It was a forgery," replied the scrivener. "Sir Ferdinando Mounchensey had
  nothing whatever to do with it. His signature was imitated from other deeds
  in the possession of my employers, and his seal was likewise fabricated."</p>

  <p>"What say you to this, Sir?" said Charles, to Sir Giles.</p>

  <p>"I deny it, as I do all the rest," he replied. "'Tis a foul conspiracy
  against me, as will appear in the end."</p>

  <p>"This is only one amongst many such frauds committed by them, your
  Highness," said the scrivener. "Since I have your gracious promise of pardon,
  I will make a clean breast of it, and reveal all I know. Many and many a fair
  estate has been wrongfully wrested from its owner in this way&mdash;by forged
  deed or will. I will name all the parties to your Highness."</p>

  <p>"Hereafter, I will listen to thee," rejoined Charles, motioning him to
  rise; "but I shall now confine myself to the case immediately before me.
  Proceed, Sir," he added, to Lanyere.</p>

  <p>"I have come to the saddest and darkest part of all," said the promoter.
  "Your Highness has seen that a deed was forged to obtain possession of the
  Mounchensey estates&mdash;and the fraudulent design was only too successful.
  It was in vain Sir Ferdinando denied all knowledge of the instrument&mdash;in
  vain he refused payment of the large sum demanded&mdash;his estates were
  seized by the extortioners&mdash;and he was deprived of the power of
  redemption. He commenced a suit against them in the Star-Chamber, but here
  again he was baffled by the cunning and knavery of Sir Giles, and having
  unwittingly incurred the censure of the Court, he was cast into the Fleet
  Prison, where he perished miserably."</p>

  <p>"A lamentable history," exclaimed Charles. "It is grievous to think that
  justice cannot be done him."</p>

  <p>"Justice may he done his son," said Buckingham, "who has been oppressed in
  like manner with his father. Restitution may be made him of the estates of
  which he has been plundered."</p>

  <p>"It is well," said Sir Giles, glancing at Lanyere. "You will not enjoy
  them."</p>

  <p>"What means he?" inquired Charles.</p>

  <p>"The estates were assigned to this treacherous knave, your Highness," said
  Sir Giles, pointing to Lanyere, "for a certain consideration, which was never
  performed. But, while denying, as I do most energetically, that any underhand
  means whatever were used by us to obtain possession of those estates, and
  repeating my declaration that a most artful conspiracy has been formed
  against us, I assert, as will appear on investigation, that if I fail in
  sustaining my claim to the Mounchensey estates, they cannot go to Sir
  Jocelyn."</p>

  <p>"Wherefore not?" inquired Charles.</p>

  <p>"Because Sir Ferdinando left them to his brother Osmond. I have possession
  of his will."</p>

  <p>"It may be a forgery," said Charles.</p>

  <p>"Not so, your Highness," observed Lupo Vulp. "This statement is
  correct."</p>

  <p>"I have it with me now," cried Sir Giles, producing a document. "Will it
  please your Highness to look at it?" he added, handing it to the Prince. "You
  will see that the estates are wholly left to Osmond Mounchensey. If,
  therefore, your Highness should seek to deprive me of them, you must bestow
  them as they are herein bequeathed."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly, if this instrument be valid," said Charles, looking at
  Lanyere.</p>

  <p>"I do not dispute it, your Highness," said the promoter.</p>

  <p>"But there is no proof that Osmond Mounchensey is living, your Highness,"
  observed Lupo Vulp. "He has not been heard of for many years&mdash;not,
  indeed, since the time when his debts were paid by Sir Ferdinando. Though Sir
  Giles has used every exertion for the purpose, he has never been able to
  discover any traces of him&mdash;and it is reasonable, therefore, to suppose
  that he is no more."</p>

  <p>"That is false," cried Sir Giles. "It is true I have long sought for him
  in vain&mdash;but within these few days I have obtained some tidings of him,
  which, if followed up, will assuredly lead to his detection. Nay more,
  Lanyere himself must know that he is alive, since, from the intelligence I
  have received, he must have been recently in company with him."</p>

  <p>"Is this assertion correct?" said Charles, to the promoter.</p>

  <p>"It is, your Highness," replied Lanyere; "but I had good reasons for
  concealing the circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," cried Sir Giles; "because you had ascertained from the
  traitor Lupo that this will existed, and feared a claim might be advanced to
  the estates&mdash;but they will never be yours, or Sir Jocelyn's. If not
  mine, they are Osmond Mounchensey's."</p>

  <p>"He says right," remarked Charles.</p>

  <p>"Then learn to your confusion, villain, that Osmond Mounchensey stands
  before you!" cried the promoter, addressing Sir Giles. "Behold him in
  me!"</p>

  <p>"You Osmond Mounchensey!" exclaimed Sir Giles; eyeing him with an
  astonishment which was shared by Sir Francis and by the greater part of the
  spectators. To judge from their manner, however, Prince Charles, together
  with Buckingham and De Gondomar, did not seem unprepared for the
  announcement.</p>

  <p>"Ay," rejoined Osmond to Sir Giles. "Look on me if you can. Never should
  my name have been revealed to you, except at a moment when there should have
  been no chance of its repetition, on your part, but for my brother's will, of
  the existence of which I have only been lately aware, and which has obliged
  me to avow myself. But for this, I would have remained for ever in obscurity,
  and have perished as I have lived&mdash;the despised Clement Lanyere. The
  name of Mounchensey should not have been shamed in me. But if I am the
  reproach of that ancient and honourable house&mdash;untarnished by any other
  member of it&mdash;I am also its avenger, and will wipe out effectually the
  stains you have cast upon it. By your machinations, villain, was my brother
  destroyed&mdash;by your machinations has his son been imprisoned, and his
  life endangered&mdash;by your machinations I myself was censured by the
  terrible Star-Chamber, and its severest punishments inflicted upon me. You
  knew not whom you tortured; and had you been aware of my real name, even this
  wrong might not have contented you. But no matter. From the hour when the
  tormentor, by your order, did his work upon me, I devoted myself to
  vengeance&mdash;slow, sure vengeance. I resolved not to interfere with your
  career of villany till you were full-blown in crime; and though I have had
  some difficulty in holding back my hand, I have been patient. The hour at
  length has arrived, and I hold you firmly in my grasp. I have crushed in
  pieces the whole of the fabric you have been at such pains to rear. Your
  estates and all your possessions will be forfeited to the Crown; and, if you
  escape with life, you will bear the indelible marks of disgrace which you
  have inflicted upon me!"</p>

  <p>Overpowered by what he heard, Sir Giles threw himself at the feet of
  Charles.</p>

  <p>"Do not sue to me, Sir," replied the Prince, regarding him with stern
  displeasure. "Enough for you to know that I have been in this much-injured
  gentleman's secret. Let your nephew now be introduced, Sir," he added, to
  Osmond Mounchensey.</p>

  <p>"His nephew!" muttered Sir Giles, as he arose. "Nay, then, all is indeed
  lost!"</p>

  <p>"I have felt that for a long time," groaned Sir Francis.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2-32"
     name="ch2-32">CHAPTER XXXII.<br>
  Judgment.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">On the intimation of the Prince's wishes, the tapestry was
  again raised to admit Sir Jocelyn Mounchensey, who, stepping forward, made a
  profound reverence to the Prince.</p>

  <p>"I greet you well, Sir Jocelyn," said Charles, in the kindest and most
  gracious tone, as the young knight advanced towards him. "As your disgrace
  was public, so shall your restoration to the King's favour be likewise
  public. Your return to Court will be a satisfaction to his Majesty. Any
  imprudence of which you have been guilty will be entirely overlooked. All
  graver faults imputed to you have been explained&mdash;so that no
  unfavourable impressions against you remain upon my royal father's
  mind&mdash;or on mine. Let me assure you that you have now no more zealous
  friends than the Conde de Gondomar and the Marquis of Buckingham."</p>

  <p>"For any wrong I may have done Sir Jocelyn I am heartily sorry," said
  Buckingham, frankly. "And he may rely on my present oiler of friendship."</p>

  <p>"And on mine, too," subjoined De Gondomar. "The services I have rendered
  him must be set against any mischief I have subsequently done."</p>

  <p>"You make me more than amends," said Sir Jocelyn, bowing to them, "and I
  at once accept your proffered friendship."</p>

  <p>"You are in the midst of friends and foes, Sir Jocelyn," said Prince
  Charles, "and have before you a new-found relative; and not far distant from
  you one, whom&mdash;unless I am greatly mistaken&mdash;has the strongest hold
  upon your affections; but before you turn to her, or to any one, listen to
  the sentence, which in the King's name I shall pronounce upon those two
  offenders&mdash;a sentence which most assuredly will be ratified by his
  Majesty in person, and by the Lords of the Council of the Star-Chamber,
  before whom they will be brought. Hear me, then, ye wrong-doers. Ye shall be
  despoiled of your unjustly-acquired possessions, which will be escheated to
  the Crown. Where restitution is possible, it shall be made."</p>

  <p>"Restitution by the Crown!&mdash;a likely thing!" muttered Sir Giles.</p>

  <p>"Moreover, ye shall pay for your misdeeds in person," pursued Charles.
  "Degraded from the knighthood ye have dishonoured, and with all the
  ceremonies of debasement, when ye have become Giles Mompesson and Francis
  Mitchell, knaves, ye shall undergo precisely the same ignominious punishment,
  with all its dreadful details, which ye caused to be inflicted upon him you
  supposed to be Clement Lanyere. This being done to you, and no part of the
  torture being on any plea omitted, ye shall be brought back to the Fleet
  Prison, and be there incarcerated for the residue of your lives."</p>

  <p>Mompesson heard this sentence apparently unmoved, though his flashing eye
  betrayed, in some degree, his secret emotion. Not so his partner. Flinging
  himself on his knees before the Prince, he cried in piteous tones&mdash;"I
  confess my manifold offences, and own that my sentence is lenient in
  comparison with them. But I beseech your Highness to spare me the mutilation
  and branding. All else I will patiently endure."</p>

  <p>"He merits no compassion," said Buckingham, "and yet I would intercede for
  him."</p>

  <p>"And your intercession shall avail to the extent which he himself hath
  mentioned&mdash;but no further," rejoined Charles.</p>

  <p>"I solicit nothing&mdash;and I confess nothing," said Mompesson, in a tone
  of defiance. "If I am ever brought to trial I shall know how to defend
  myself. But I well know that will never be. I can make such revelations
  concerning those in high places&mdash;ay, in the highest places," he added,
  with a vindictive look at Buckingham, "that they will not dare to molest
  me."</p>

  <p>"The hound must be muzzled," said Buckingham, in a low tone, to the
  Prince.</p>

  <p>"He must," replied Charles. "Let the prisoners be removed. They are
  committed to the Fleet Prison."</p>

  <p>"Prisoners!" exclaimed Mompesson.</p>

  <p>"Ay, prisoners," repeated Osmond Mounchensey, "<i>my</i> prisoners. I have
  a Star-Chamber warrant for your arrest. Behold it. Under this warrant his
  Highness has committed you, and you will be taken hence to the Fleet, where
  you, Giles Mompesson, shall occupy the cell you destined for my nephew! Now,
  your sword."</p>

  <p>"Take it," rejoined Mompesson, plucking the rapier from its sheath, "take
  it in your heart. You, at least, shall not live to enjoy your triumph."</p>

  <p>But Osmond was too quick for him, and seizing his arm, ere he could deal
  the meditated blow, with almost superhuman force, he wrested the sword from
  him, and broke it beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>At the same time, other personages appeared on the scene. These were the
  Serjeant-at-arms and a party of halberdiers. Advancing slowly towards the
  prisoners, the officer received the warrant from Osmond Mounchensey, while
  the halberdiers closed round the two extortioners.</p>

  <p>"Before the prisoner, Mompesson, is removed," said Charles, "see that he
  delivers up to you his keys. Let an inventory be taken of all monies within
  the house, and let the royal seal be placed upon all boxes and caskets. All
  deeds and other documents must be carefully preserved to be examined
  hereafter. And let strict search be made&mdash;for I have heard there are
  many hidden depositories of treasure&mdash;especially within the prisoner's
  secret cabinet."</p>

  <p>"Take heed that the strictest examination be made," subjoined Buckingham,
  "in accordance with his Highness's behests&mdash;for the knave smiles, as if
  he thought his precautions were so well taken that the searchers would be
  baffled."</p>

  <p>"Fear nothing, my Lord Marquis," replied the Serjant-at-arms. "Now,
  prisoner," he added, to Mompesson&mdash;"your keys!"</p>

  <p>While the officer was thus employed, Luke Hatton stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"Those keys will be of little use," he said, to the Prince. "Others have
  been beforehand with your Highness."</p>

  <p>"How, Sir&mdash;what others?" demanded Charles, bending his brows.</p>

  <p>"The extortioner's lawless band of attendants&mdash;generally known as his
  myrmidons, your Highness," replied Hatton. "Instinctively discerning, as it
  would seem, that all was over with their master, they had determined to quit
  his service, and without giving him any notice of their intention. Not
  content with deserting him in the hour of danger, they have robbed him as
  well&mdash;robbed him of the bulk of his treasure. They have broken into his
  secret cabinet&mdash;and stripped it of all its valuables that could be of
  use to them, and have not left one of his hidden hoards unvisited."</p>

  <p>"Hell's curses upon them!" exclaimed Mompesson, with irrepressible rage.
  "May they all swing upon the gibbet!"</p>

  <p>"The chief among them&mdash;a rascally Alsatian, known as Captain
  Bludder&mdash;has been captured," pursued Luke Hatton. "And a large sum,
  together with a rich casket of jewels, has been found upon him; and it is to
  be hoped that the officers will succeed in finding the others. Will your
  Highness interrogate Bludder?"</p>

  <p>"Not now," replied Charles. "Let him be taken to the Fleet. But there were
  other matters of more importance than the treasures&mdash;the deeds and legal
  instruments. These, as being useless to the robbers, were probably left
  untouched."</p>

  <p>"They were so, your Highness," replied Luke Hatton.</p>

  <p>"Would they had burned them!" ejaculated Mompesson. "Would all had been
  destroyed!"</p>

  <p>And he gave utterance to such wild exclamations of rage, accompanied by
  such frenzied gestures, that the halberdiers seized him, and dragged him out
  of the room. The old usurer was removed at the same time.</p>

  <p>"And now," said Charles, rising from his chair, "one thing only remains to
  be done ere I depart, and it will he pleasanter to me than aught that has
  preceded it. I must again address myself to you, Sir Jocelyn Mounchensey, ay,
  and to you, also, fair Mistress Aveline. I pray you to come near me," he
  continued, with a gracious smile, to the damsel.</p>

  <p>And, as she blushingly complied,&mdash;for she half divined his
  purpose,&mdash;he said&mdash;"As I have already told you, Sir Jocelyn, your
  restoration to the King's favour is complete, and your re-appearance at Court
  would be a gratification to his Majesty, but, after the events which have
  occurred, a brief retirement will, I conceive, be most agreeable to you, and
  I would counsel a visit to the hall of your ancestors."</p>

  <p>"Nothing could be more in accordance with my own wishes, most gracious
  Prince, if my newly-found relative will accept me as his guest."</p>

  <p>"Not as his guest, my good nephew" said Osmond. "You are sole lord of
  Mounchensey. I have made over the mansion and all the estates to you. They
  are yours, as by right they should be."</p>

  <p>Sir Jocelyn's emotion was too great to allow him to express his gratitude
  in words.</p>

  <p>"A noble gift!" exclaimed Charles. "But you must not go there alone, Sir
  Jocelyn. You must take a bride with you. This fair lady has well approved her
  love for you&mdash;as you have the depth of your devotion to her. Take her
  from my hands. Take her to jour heart; and may years of fondest wedded
  happiness attend you both! When you re-appear at Court, you will be all the
  more welcome if Lady Mounchensey be with you."</p>

  <p>So saying, he placed Aveline's hand in that of her lover; and, with a look
  of ineffable delight, they knelt to express their gratitude.</p>

  <p>The Prince and the courtly train passed out&mdash;and, lastly, Sir Jocelyn
  and the object of his affections. Vainly did he seek for his relative and
  benefactor. Osmond Mounchensey had disappeared. But, just as the young Knight
  and his fair companion were quitting the house, Luke Hatton, followed by two
  porters, bearing a stout chest, approached them, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Sir Jocelyn, you have seen the last of your uncle. He has charged me to
  bid you an eternal adieu. You will never hear of him again, unless you hear
  of his death. May no thoughts of him mar your happiness&mdash;or that of her
  you love. This is what he bade me say to you. This chest contains the
  title-deeds of your estates&mdash;and amongst them is a deed of gift from him
  to you. They will be conveyed by these porters whithersoever you may direct
  them. And now, having discharged mine office, I must take my leave."</p>

  <p>"Stay, Sir," cried Sir Jocelyn; "I would fain send a message to my
  uncle."</p>

  <p>"I cannot convey it," replied Luke Hatton. "You must rest content with
  what I have told you. To you, and to all others, Osmond Mounchensey is as the
  dead."</p>

  <p>With this, he hastily retreated.</p>

  <p>Three days after this, the loving pair were wedded; and the
  ceremony&mdash;which was performed with strict privacy, in accordance with
  the wishes of the bride&mdash;being concluded, they set out upon their
  journey into Norfolk. Sir Jocelyn had noticed among the spectators of the
  marriage rites, a tall personage wrapped in a sable cloak, whom he suspected
  to be his uncle; but, as the individual was half hidden by a pillar of the
  ancient fabric, and as he lost sight of him before he could seek him out, he
  never could be quite sure of the fact.</p>

  <p>Sir Jocelyn's arrival at the hall of his ancestors was the occasion of
  great rejoicings; and, in spite of the temptations held out to him, many
  years elapsed ere he and Lady Mounchensey revisited the scene of their
  troubles in London.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-33"
     name="ch2-33">CHAPTER XXXIII.<br>
  Retribution.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">As will have been foreseen, the judgment pronounced by
  Prince Charles upon Mompesson and his partner, was confirmed by the King and
  the Lords of the Council, when the two offenders were brought be them in the
  Star-Chamber. They were both degraded from the honour of knighthood; and
  Mitchell, besides being so heavily fined that all his ill-gotten wealth was
  wrested from him, had to endure the in of riding through the streets&mdash;in
  a posture the reverse of the ordinary mode of equitation&mdash;name with his
  face towards the horse's tail, two quart pots tied round his neck, to show
  that he was punished I for his exactions upon ale-house keepers and
  hostel-keepers, and a placard upon his breast, detailing the nature of his
  offences. In this way,&mdash;hooted and pelted by the rabble, who pursued him
  as he was led along, and who would have inflicted serious injuries upon him,
  and perhaps despatched him outright, had it not been for the escort by whom
  he was protected,&mdash;he was taken in turn to all such taverns and houses
  of entertainment as had suffered most from his scandalous system of
  oppression.</p>

  <p>In the course of his progress, he was brought to the Three Cranes in the
  Vintry, before which an immense concourse was assembled to witness the
  spectacle. Though the exhibition made by the culprit, seated as he was on a
  great ragged beast purposely selected for the occasion, was sufficiently
  ludicrous and grotesque to excite the merriment of most of the beholders, who
  greeted his arrival with shouts of derisive laughter; still his woe-begone
  countenance, and miserable plight&mdash;for he was covered with mud from head
  to foot&mdash;moved the compassion of the good-natured Madame Bonaventure, as
  she gazed at him from one of the upper windows of her hostel, and the feeling
  was increased as the wretched old man threw a beseeching glance at her. She
  could stand the sight no longer, and rushed from the window.</p>

  <p>In the same room with her there were four persons, who had been partaking
  of a plentiful repast, as was proved by the numerous dishes and flasks of
  wine garnishing the table at which they had been seated, and they, too, as
  well as the hostess, on hearing the noise outside the tavern, had rushed to
  the windows to see what could cause so much disturbance. As they were all
  well acquainted with the old usurer and his mal-practices, the spectacle had
  a special interest to them as well as to the hostess, and they were variously
  affected by it.</p>

  <p>The party, we must state, consisted of Master Richard Taverner, as the
  quondam apprentice was now styled, and his pretty wife, Gillian, who now
  looked prettier than usual in her wedding attire&mdash;for the ceremony
  uniting them in indissoluble bonds had only just been performed; old
  Greenford, the grandsire of the bride; and Master John Wolfe, of the Bible
  and Crown in Paul's Churchyard, bookseller, erstwhile Dick's indulgent
  master, and now his partner, Master Taverner having very prudently invested
  the contents of the silver coffer in the purchase of a share in his employers
  business, with the laudable determination of bestirring himself zealously in
  it ever after; and, as another opportunity may not occur for mentioning the
  circumstance, we will add that he kept to his resolution, and ultimately rose
  to high offices in the city. Dick's appearance had already considerably
  improved. His apparel was spruce and neat, but not showy, and well became
  him; while his deportment, even under the blissful circumstances in which he
  was placed, had a sobriety and decorum about it really surprising, and which
  argued well for his future good conduct. He began as he meant to go on; and
  it was plain that John Wolfe's advice had produced a salutary effect upon
  him. Old Greenford looked the picture of happiness.</p>

  <p>With Master Richard's predilections for the Three Cranes we are well
  acquainted, and it will not, therefore, appear unnatural that he should
  choose this, his favourite tavern, for his wedding-dinner. Madame Bonaventure
  was delighted with the bride, and brought the blushes to her fair cheeks by
  the warmth of her praises of her beauty; while she could not sufficiently
  congratulate the bridegroom on his good luck in obtaining such a treasure.
  The best in the house was set before them&mdash;both viands and
  wine&mdash;and ample justice was done by all to the good cheer. Cyprien, as
  usual, brought in the dishes, and filled the flagons with the rare Bordeaux
  he had been directed by his mistress to introduce; but Madame Bonaventure
  personally superintended the repast, carving the meats, selecting the most
  delicate bits for Gillian's especial consumption, and seasoning them yet more
  agreeably with her lively sallies.</p>

  <p>The dinner had come to a close, and they were just drinking the health of
  the bonny and blushing bride, when the clamour on the quay proclaimed the old
  usurer's arrival. As he was the furthest person from her thoughts, and as she
  had not heard of the day appointed for his punishment, Madame Bonaventure was
  totally unprepared for the spectacle offered to her when she reached the
  window; and her retreat from it, as we have related, was almost
  immediate.</p>

  <p>To his shame be it spoken, Master Richard Taverner was greatly entertained
  by the doleful appear of his old enemy, and could not help exulting over his
  downfall and distress; but he was quickly checked by his bride, who shared in
  the hostess's gentler and more compassionate feelings. So much, indeed, was
  the gentle Gillian touched by the delinquent's supplicating looks, that she
  yielded to the impulse that prompted her to afford him some solace, and
  snatching up a flask of wine and a flagon from the table, she rushed out of
  the room, followed by her husband, who vainly endeavoured to stay her.</p>

  <p>In a moment Gillian was out upon the quay; and the mounted guard stationed
  round the prisoner, divining her purpose, kindly drew aside to let her pass.
  Filling the goblet, she handed it to the old man, who eagerly drained it, and
  breathed a blessing on her as he returned it. Some of the bystanders said the
  blessing would turn to a curse&mdash;but it was not so; and so well pleased
  was Dick with what his good wife had done, that he clasped her to his heart
  before all the crowd.</p>

  <p>This incident was so far of service to the prisoner, that it saved him
  from further indignity at the moment. The mob ceased to jeer him, or to hurl
  mud and missiles at him, and listened in silence to the public crier as he
  read aloud his sentence. This done, the poor wretch and his escort moved away
  to the Catherine Wheel, in the Steelyard, where a less kindly reception
  awaited him.</p>

  <p>In taking leave, as we must now do, of Master Richard Taverner and his
  pretty wife, it gives us pleasure to say that they were as happy in their
  wedded state as loving couples necessarily must be. We may add that they
  lived long, and were blessed with numerous issue&mdash;so noumerous indeed,
  that, as we have before intimated, Dick had to work hard all the rest of his
  days.</p>

  <p>In bidding adieu, also, to Madame Bonaventure, which we do with regret, we
  have merely to state that she did not reign much longer over the destinies of
  the Three Cranes, but resigned in favour of Cyprien, who, as Monsieur Latour,
  was long and favourably known as the jovial and liberal host of that renowned
  tavern. Various reasons were assigned for Madame Bonaventure's retirement;
  but the truth was, that having made money enough, she began to find the banks
  of the Thames too damp and foggy for her, especially during the winter
  months; so the next time the skipper entered the river, having previously
  made her arrangements, she embarked on board his vessel, and returned to the
  sunny shores of the Garonne.</p>

  <p>Mompesson's sentence, though far more severe and opprobrious than that of
  the elder extortioner, was thought too lenient, and most persons were of
  opinion that, considering the enormity of his offences, his life ought not to
  be spared. But they judged unadvisedly. Death by the axe, or even by the
  rope, would have been infinitely preferred by the criminal himself, to the
  lingering agonies he was destined to endure. Moreover, there was retributive
  justice in the sentence, that doomed him to undergo tortures similar to those
  he had so often inflicted on others.</p>

  <p>The pillory was erected at Charing Cross. A numerous escort was required
  to protect him from the fury of the mob, who would otherwise have torn him in
  pieces; but, though shielded in some degree from their active vengeance, he
  could not shut his ears to their yells and execrations. Infuriated thousands
  were collected in the open space around the pillory, eager to glut their eyes
  upon the savage spectacle; and the shout they set up on his appearance was so
  terrific, that even the prisoner, undaunted as he had hitherto shown himself,
  was shaken by it, and lost his firmness, though he recovered it in some
  degree as he mounted the huge wooden machine, conspicuous at a distance above
  the heads of the raging multitude. On the boards on which he had to stand,
  there was another person besides the tormentor,&mdash;and the sight of him
  evidently occasioned the criminal great disquietude. This person was attired
  in black, with a broad-leaved hat pulled down over his brows.</p>

  <p>"What doth this fellow here?" demanded Mompesson. "You do not need an
  assistant."</p>

  <p>"I know not that," replied the tormentor,&mdash;a big, brawny fellow,
  habited in a leathern jerkin, with his arms bared to the
  shoulder,&mdash;taking up his hammer and selecting a couple of sharp-pointed
  nails; "but in any case he has an order from the Council of the Star-Chamber
  to stand here. And now, prisoner," he continued roughly and
  authoritatively,&mdash;"place your head in this hole, and your hands
  here."</p>

  <p>Since resistance would have been vain, Mompesson did as he was bidden. A
  heavy beam descended over his neck and wrists, and fastened him down
  immovably; while, amid the exulting shouts of the spectators, his ears were
  nailed to the wood. During one entire hour the ponderous machine slowly
  revolved, so as to exhibit him to all the assemblage; and at the end of that
  time the yet more barbarous part of the sentence, for which the ferocious mob
  had been impatiently waiting, was carried out. The keen knife and the
  branding-iron were called into play, and in the bleeding and mutilated object
  before them, now stamped with indelible infamy, none could have recognised
  the once haughty and handsome Sir Giles Mompesson.</p>

  <p>A third person, we have said, stood upon the pillory. He took no part in
  aiding the tormentor in his task; but he watched all that was done with
  atrocious satisfaction. Not a groan&mdash;not the quivering of a muscle
  escaped him. He felt the edge of the knife to make sure it was sharp enough
  for the purpose, and saw that the iron was sufficiently heated to burn the
  characters of shame deeply in. When all was accomplished, he seized
  Mompesson's arm, and, in a voice that seemed scarcely human,
  cried,&mdash;"Now, I have paid thee back in part for the injuries thou hast
  done me. Thou wilt never mock me more!"</p>

  <p>"In part!" groaned Mompesson. "Is not thy vengeance fully satiated? What
  more wouldst thou have?"</p>

  <p>"What more?" echoed the other, with the laugh of a demon,&mdash;"for every
  day of anguish thou gavest my brother in his dungeon in the Fleet I would
  have a month&mdash;a year, I would not have thee perish too soon, and
  therefore thou shalt be better cared for than he was. But thou shalt never
  escape&mdash;never! and at the last I will be by thy side."</p>

  <p>It would almost seem as if that moment were come, for, as the words were
  uttered, Mompesson fainted from loss of blood and intensity of pain, and in
  this state he was placed upon a hurdle tied to a horse's heels, and conveyed
  back to the Fleet.</p>

  <p>As threatened, he was doomed to long and solitary imprisonment, and the
  only person, beside the jailer, admitted to his cell, was his unrelenting
  foe. A steel mirror was hung up in his dungeon, so that he might see to what
  extent his features had been disfigured.</p>

  <p>In this way three years rolled by&mdash;years of uninterrupted happiness
  to Sir Jocelyn and Lady Mounchensey, as well as to Master Richard Taverner
  and his dame; but of increasing gloom to the captive in his solitary cell in
  the Fleet. Of late, he had become so fierce and unmanageable that he had to
  be chained to the wall. He sprang at his jailer and tried to strangle him,
  and gnashed his teeth, and shook his fists in impotent rage at Osmond
  Mounchensey. But again his mood changed, and he would supplicate for mercy,
  crawling on the floor, and trying to kiss the feet of his enemy, who spurned
  him from him. Then he fell sick, and refused his food; and, as the sole means
  of preserving his life, he was removed to an airier chamber. But as it
  speedily appeared, this was only a device to enable him to escape from
  prison,&mdash;and it proved successful. He was thought to be so ill that the
  jailer, fancying him incapable of moving, became negligent, and when Osmond
  Mounchensey next appeared, the prisoner had flown. How he had effected his
  escape no one could at first explain; but it appeared, on inquiry, that he
  had been assisted by two of his old myrmidons, Captain Bludder and Staring
  Hugh, both of whom were prisoners at the time in the Fleet.</p>

  <p>Osmond's rage knew no bounds. He vowed never to rest till he had traced
  out the fugitive, and brought him back.</p>

  <p>But he experienced more difficulty in the quest than he anticipated. No
  one was better acquainted with the obscure quarters and hiding-places of
  London than he; but in none of these retreats could he discover the object of
  his search. The potentates of Whitefriars and the Mint would not have dared
  to harbour such an offender as Mompesson, and would have given him up at once
  if he had sought refuge in their territories. But Osmond satisfied himself,
  by a perquisition of every house in those sanctuaries, that he was not there.
  Nor had any one been seen like him. The asylum for "masterless men," near
  Smart's Quay, and all the other dens for thieves and criminals hiding from
  justice, in and about the metropolis, were searched, but with the like ill
  result. Hitherto, Mompesson had contrived entirely to baffle the vigilance of
  his foe.</p>

  <p>At last, Osmond applied to Luke Hatton, thinking it possible his cunning
  might suggest some plan for the capture of the fugitive. After listening with
  the greatest attention to all related to him, the apothecary pondered for
  awhile, and then said&mdash;"It is plain he has trusted no one with his
  retreat, but I think I can find him. Come to me on the third night from this,
  and you shall hear further. Meantime, you need not relax your own search,
  though, if it be as I suspect, failure is sure to attend you."</p>

  <p>Obliged to be satisfied with this promise, Osmond departed. On the third
  night, at a late hour, he returned. He did not, however, find Luke Hatton.
  The apothecary, it appeared, had been absent from home during the last three
  days, and the old woman who attended upon him was full of uneasiness on his
  account. Her master, she said, had left a letter on his table, and on
  investigation it proved to be for Osmond. In it the writer directed him, in
  the event of his non-return before the time appointed, to repair without
  delay, well armed, to the vaults beneath Mompesson's old habitation near the
  Fleet, and to make strict search for him throughout them. He also acquainted
  him with a secret entrance into the house, contrived in the walls beneath the
  lofty north-eastern turret. On reading this letter, Osmond at once understood
  his ally's plan, together with its danger, and felt that, as he had not
  returned, he had, in all probability, fallen a victim to his rashness.
  Telling the old woman whither he was going, and that inquiries might be made
  there for him on the morrow, if he did not re-appear with her master, he set
  out at once for the place indicated.</p>

  <p>We shall, however, precede him.</p>

  <p>Ever since Mompesson had been taken to the Fleet, his habitation had been
  deserted. The place was cursed. So much odium attached to it,&mdash;so many
  fearful tales were told of it,&mdash;that no one would dwell there. At the
  time of its owner's committal, it was stripped of all its contents, and
  nothing was left but bare walls and uncovered floors. Even these, from
  neglect and desertion, had become dilapidated, and a drearier and more
  desolate place could not be imagined. Strict search had been made by the
  officers of the Star-Chamber for concealed treasure, but little was found,
  the bulk having been carried off, as before related, by the myrmidons.
  Nevertheless, it was supposed there were other secret hoards, if a clue to
  them could only be found. Mompesson had been interrogated on the subject; but
  he only made answers calculated to excite the cupidity of his hearers without
  satisfying them, and they fancied he was deceiving them.</p>

  <p>On the night in question, to all outward appearance, the house was sombre
  and deserted as usual, and the city watch who passed it at midnight, and
  paused before its rusty gates and its nailed-up door, fancied all was secure.
  The moon was at the full, shining brightly on the sombre stone walls of the
  mansion,&mdash;on its windows, and on the lofty corner turret, whence
  Mompesson used so often to reconnoitre the captives in the opposite prison;
  and, as certain of the guard looked up at the turret, they laughed at its
  present emptiness. Yet they little dreamed who was there at the time,
  regarding them from the narrow loop-hole. After the pause of a few minutes
  they moved on, and the gleam of their halberts was presently seen, as they
  crossed Fleet Bridge, and marched towards Ludgate.</p>

  <p>About two hours afterwards the watch re-appeared, and, while again passing
  the house, the attention of their leader was attracted by an unusual
  appearance in the masonry near the north-east angle, above which the tall
  turret was situated. On closer examination, the irregularity in the walls was
  found to be produced by a small secret door, which was left partially open,
  as if it had been recently used. The suspicions of the party being aroused by
  this singular circumstance (none of them having been aware of the existence
  of such a door), they at once entered the house, resolved to make strict
  search throughout it. In the first instance, they scaled the turret, with
  which the secret outlet communicated by a narrow winding staircase; and then,
  proceeding to the interior of the habitation, pursued their investigations
  for some time without success. Indeed, they were just about to depart, when a
  sound resembling a deep groan seemed to arise from the cellars which they had
  not visited. Hearing this, they immediately rushed down, and made an
  extraordinary discovery.</p>

  <p>To explain this, however, we must go back to the time when they first
  passed the house. We then mentioned that there was a person in the turret
  watching their movements. As they disappeared in the direction of Ludgate,
  this individual quitted his post of observation, and, descending the spiral
  staircase, threaded a long passage in the darkness, like one familiar with
  the place, until he arrived at a particular chamber, which he entered; and,
  without pausing, proceeded to a little cabinet beyond it. The moonlight
  streaming through a grated window, showed that this cabinet had been
  completely dismantled; stones had been removed from the walls; and several of
  the boards composing the floor, had been torn up and never replaced. The
  intruder did not pass beyond the door, but, after gazing for a few minutes at
  the scene of ruin, uttered an ejaculation of rage, and retired.</p>

  <p>His steps might have been next heard descending the great stone staircase.
  He paused not a moment within the entrance-hall, but made his way along a
  side passage on the left, and down another flight of steps, till he reached a
  subterranean chamber. Here all would have been profound obscurity, had it not
  been for a lamp set on the ground, which imperfectly illumined the place.</p>

  <p>As the man took up the lamp and trimmed it, the light fell strongly upon
  his features, and revealed all their hideousness. No visage, except that of
  Osmond Mounchensey, could be more appalling than this person's, and the
  mutilation was in both cases the same. It is needless to say it was
  Mompesson. His habiliments were sordid; and his beard and hair, grizzled by
  suffering rather than age, were wild and disordered. But he was armed both
  with sword and dagger; and his limbs looked muscular and active as ever.</p>

  <p>Casting a glance towards the entrance of the vault as if to make quite
  sure he was not observed&mdash;though he entertained little anxiety on that
  score&mdash;Mompesson stepped towards a particular part of the wall, and
  touching a spring, a secret door (not to be detected within the masonry
  except on minute examination) flew open, and disclosed another and smaller
  vault.</p>

  <p>Here, it was at once evident, was concealed the treasure that had escaped
  the clutches of the myrmidons and the officers of the Star-Chamber. There was
  a large open chest at the further end, full of corpulent money-bags, any one
  of which would have gladdened the heart of a miser. On this chest Mompesson's
  gaze was so greedily fixed that he did not notice the body of a man lying
  directly in his path, and well-nigh stumbled over it. Uttering a bitter
  imprecation, he held down the lamp, and beheld the countenance of Luke
  Hatton, now rigid in death, but with the sardonic grin it had worn throughout
  life still impressed upon it. There was a deep gash in the breast of the dead
  man, and blood upon the floor.</p>

  <p>"Accursed spy and traitor," cried Mompesson, as he took hold of the body
  by the heels and dragged it to one corner&mdash;"thou wilt never betray me
  more. What brought thee here I know not, unless it were to meet the death
  thou hast merited at my hands. Would a like chance might bring Osmond
  Mounchensey here&mdash;and alone&mdash;I would desire nothing more."</p>

  <p>"Be thy wish gratified then!" cried a voice, which Mompesson could not
  mistake.</p>

  <p>Looking up, he beheld his enemy.</p>

  <p>In an instant his hand was upon his sword, and the blade gleamed in the
  lamp-light. Osmond had likewise plucked forth his rapier, and held a poignard
  in his left hand. For a few moments they gazed at each other with terrible
  looks, their breasts animated with an intensity of hatred which only mortal
  foes, met under such circumstances, can feel. So fiercely bloodthirsty were
  their looks that their disfigured features seemed to have lost all traces of
  humanity.</p>

  <p>"Yield thee, murtherous villain," cried Osmond at length. "I will drag
  thee to the hangman."</p>

  <p>"Call in thy fellows, and thou shalt see whether I will yield," rejoined
  Mompesson, with a laugh of defiance.</p>

  <p>"I have none at my back," rejoined Osmond; "I will force thee to follow me
  alone!"</p>

  <p>"Thou <i>art</i> alone then!" roared Mompesson; "that is all I
  desired!"</p>

  <p>And, without a word more, he commenced the attack. During the brief
  colloquy just detailed, he had noticed that his enemy was doubly armed, and
  before beginning the conflict he drew his own dagger, so that there was no
  greater advantage on one side than the other.</p>

  <p>Both were admirable swordsmen, and in strength they were nearly matched;
  but the combat was conducted with a ferocity that almost set skill at
  defiance.</p>

  <p>After the exchange of a few desperate passes, they closed; and in the
  terrific struggle that ensued the lamp was extinguished.</p>

  <p>The profound darkness prevented them from seeing the frightful wounds they
  inflicted on each other; but both knew they were severely hurt, though each
  hoped he was not so much injured as his adversary.</p>

  <p>Exhausted, at length, by loss of blood, and ready to drop, they released
  each other by mutual consent; and, after making a few more feeble and
  ineffectual thrusts, leaned upon their swords for support.</p>

  <p>"Wilt thou yield now, villain?" demanded Osmond, in a hoarse voice. "Or
  must I finish thee outright?"</p>

  <p>"Finish me!" echoed Mompesson, in tones equally hoarse. "Strike another
  blow against me if thou canst. But I well know thou art sped. When I have
  recovered breath, I will make short work with thee."</p>

  <p>"About it quickly, then," rejoined Osmond: "I am ready for thee. But thy
  boast was idle. Thou art bleeding to death. Twice has my poignard pierced thy
  breast."</p>

  <p>"Thou wilt never use thy poignard again. Thy left arm is disabled,"
  rejoined Mompesson&mdash;"besides, my sword passed through thee almost to the
  hilt."</p>

  <p>"It glanced from my doublet: I scarcely felt the scratch."</p>

  <p>"'Twas a scratch deep enough to let thy life-blood out. But since thou
  hast more to be spilt, have at thee again!"</p>

  <p>"Where art thou?" cried Osmond, staggering towards him.</p>

  <p>"Here!" rejoined Mompesson, avoiding the thrust made at him, and dealing
  one in return that stretched his adversary lifeless at his feet.</p>

  <p>In the exultation of the moment, he forgot his own desperate condition,
  and, with a fierce, triumphant laugh, set his foot upon the body of his
  prostrate foe.</p>

  <p>But a mortal faintness seized him. He essayed to quit the vault&mdash;but
  it was too late. His strength was utterly gone. With an irrepressible groan,
  he fell to the ground, close beside his enemy.</p>

  <p>There they lay, the dying and the dead, for more than an hour. At the end
  of that time, they were discovered by the watch.</p>

  <p>Mompesson yet breathed; and as the torch-light fell upon the scene of
  horror, he slightly raised his head, and pointing to his slaughtered
  adversary, with a ghastly smile, expired.</p>
