  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1">PARIS I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Towards midnight Charles Anderson finished some notes on a
  talk he had had with a newspaper editor at lunch&mdash;nothing very
  important, but he thought he ought to keep Bingay decently informed. The hour
  and the completion of the task seemed to call for a drink, so he went to the
  bathroom for some water and then to his suitcase for the silver flask that he
  always carried on these junkets and tried to keep replenished. He was not
  much of a whisky drinker (so he would say of himself when he ordered wine),
  but he liked a nightcap either in bed before turning out the light or during
  that last half-hour of dressing-gowned pottering when he would tidy up the
  affairs of the day both in his mind and on his desk. He was tidy by nature
  and years of experience had made him save, whenever possible, some small but
  relaxing job for a final one, even if it were only an entry in his diary or a
  jotting for the book he was one day going to write.</p>

  <p>Tonight, however, there was no doubt as to what the job should be. He had
  been thinking of it, off and on and with increasing satisfaction, all day; it
  had been a sort of protective armour at moments when he had needed it. And
  now, with the drink at his elbow and the sounds of the city pleasantly
  audible from beyond the closed and curtained windows, he took a sheet of
  hotel notepaper and wrote:</p>

  <p class="letter">My dear Gerald,</p>

  <p class="letter">As you may have seen from the very small print in the
  English papers, if you bother with them at all while you're on holiday, I'm
  with Sir Malcolm Bingay at the Conference here&mdash;a rather exacting job,
  one way and another, and I'll feel relieved when it's over, especially if we
  get any kind of agreement out of all the talk. Meanwhile there's a more
  cheerful event next Thursday which I expect is on your mind as well as mine.
  Do you remember (no, I daresay you were too young) that time at Parson's
  Corner when I visited you there and the fun we all had making plans for your
  seventeenth birthday? Anyhow, I'm enclosing a small gift in case you're still
  in Switzerland on the great day. I believe, though, you talked of returning
  to England about then, so it occurs to me, why don't you break the journey in
  Paris? We might see a few sights and have a civilised dinner for once, so let
  me know the date and time of your train if you can possibly manage it.</p>

  <p class="letter">Your affectionate father,</p>

  <p class="letter">Charles.</p>

  <p>That done, and the envelope addressed care of Thomas Cook's, Lucerne,
  Charles finished his drink in bed and went quickly to sleep. He was a good
  sleeper, not because he had nothing to worry about, but because as a rule he
  had worked hard enough to be tired and conscientiously enough to be
  untroubled by conscience; lately, though, he had begun to feel sometimes TOO
  tired. But there need not be much more of it, he consoled himself; he would
  soon be on pension, and with each recent year ambition had withdrawn less
  reluctantly from the probably unscalable cliffs and had begun to settle for
  the long comfortable valley just round the corner.</p>

  <p>After a couple of days Charles received a wire from Interlaken:</p>

  <p class="telegram"><tt>MANY THANKS PARIS OKAY SHALL ARRIVE GARE DE L'EST
  SEVEN P.M THURSDAY IF YOU CAN MAKE IT DINNER WILL BE FINE THANKS ALSO FOR
  SPLENDID CHECK AFFECTIONATELY GERRY</tt></p>

  <p>When Charles had digested this he happily made a note in his engagement
  book and then muttered in the presence of Sir Malcolm Bingay's secretary: 'I
  don't mind okay, but MAKE it... and c.h.e.c.k. cheque... really... hasn't he
  got over all that yet?'</p>

  <p>Charles was a handsome man for his age, which was fifty-two. His hair had
  turned austerely iron-grey, but without thinning, and since he was something
  of a gourmet his trim figure offered a special tribute to character and
  temperament. Most people liked him, including those who would have been
  astonished if he had ever achieved any sensational success; he never had, so
  in a sort of way they could like him all the more. Had he been born half a
  century earlier he would probably not have been nicknamed 'Stuffy' by his
  colleagues; perhaps also in those halcyon days he could hardly have escaped
  becoming an Ambassador or Minister in one of the South American or smaller
  European capitals. 'After you're fifty there'll be something wrong with you
  if you don't get a Legation,' he had been told on taking up his first post,
  but his informant had himself been a Minister who had modestly added, in echo
  of Lord Melbourne: 'There's no damn merit about it that I can see.' But
  perhaps, if not merit, which Charles had possessed, there had been other
  things, including luck and a Zeitgeist, that had counted against him; at any
  rate, he had not been given a Legation, and for the last year or so had been
  sticking around at the Foreign Office. This Paris Conference was really the
  most considerable event that had come his way since the war period, though it
  was far from being world-shattering, and he surmised that Bingay had taken
  him along chiefly because the Balkan angle might crop up. So far it hadn't,
  and Charles wished it would, as a wrestler hopes for a chance to display a
  hold in which he has long specialized. Charles thought it possible that if
  the Balkan angle did crop up he might even, in a minor professional way and
  entirely without headlines, distinguish himself.</p>

  <p>That he had been born during the last Victorian decade instead of the
  first was perhaps in some ways a pity, because he had just the right degree
  of correctness for the older-fashioned diplomat, apart from a very genuine
  integrity, knack with languages, suave manners, and a pretty if slightly
  erudite wit. He had also a taste for classical music, detective stories, and
  dry wines which aptly counterbalanced his distaste for jazz, modern
  non-detective fiction, and sweet wines. If you thought him a snob, as some
  people did, you had to admit that at Schönbrunn or Tsarskoye-Selo or in a
  first-class compartment on the old chocolate-and-white London and
  North-Western Scotch Express (en route for Balmoral) he would have looked the
  real thing in times when the standards of reality, or perhaps of things, were
  very different... Anyhow, his career had not been unworthy, and his small
  dinner parties in various parts of the world had even been notable&mdash;
  until the break in his life that occurred during the Second World War.</p>

  <p>It was this, when it came, that had persuaded him to send Gerald, then
  aged five, to spend the rest of the war years in America. During such a
  regrettable but prudent exile Charles had written to his son regularly every
  week, and once, being on a mission that had sent him across the Atlantic in
  the autumn of 1941, he had been able to spend a convenient weekend with the
  Fuesslis at Parson's Corner, Connecticut.</p>

  <p>The Fuesslis were connections of his wife's&mdash;genial people in the
  wholesale hardware business, comfortably off, and innocent enough to be proud
  of having an Englishman who was in Who's Who as their house guest. They made
  him as welcome as they had made Gerald, and Charles knew he owed them a debt
  he could never repay. True, the boy seemed to be acquiring a slight American
  accent, but perhaps this was unavoidable&mdash;he would unlearn it later when
  he came home, for of course the Germans would be defeated eventually; one
  took that for granted. For the time being it had been and still would be
  undeniably reassuring to think of him safe and sound and well fed, while his
  father breakfasted on Spam and put out incendiary bombs on Whitehall
  roofs.</p>

  <p>Another thing that troubled Charles slightly during his brief visit to
  Parson's Corner was that the Fuesslis seemed to have odd ideas of how to
  treat a youngster. On the night that Charles arrived at their house it was
  doubtless excusable that Gerald should be allowed to stay up past his usual
  bedtime, but it seemed strange to Charles to have to sit at the dinner table
  not only with his own youngster but with the Fuesslis' daughter Louise, aged
  three. He ascribed it to the kindness of his hosts and the natural good
  manners of both children that such an extraordinary situation passed without
  untoward incident.</p>

  <p>But an even odder thing happened on the day following. It was a Sunday,
  and the Fuesslis could think of nothing better to do than drive a hundred
  miles to nowhere in particular along roads crowded with other Americans doing
  the same thing. Charles and Gerald were placed together in the back seat of
  the Buick, and the boy, who certainly seemed happy enough, pointed out many
  local landmarks, such as Woodrow Wilson High, the new Sears Roebuck, and the
  place where a holdup man had recently been shot in a police chase. Towards
  evening Charles was beginning to feel hungry, the more so as lunch had been
  of the picnic variety, eaten in the car too hurriedly to be enjoyed. He was
  still thinking about a good dinner when the car turned into the parking area
  of what was apparently a large and popular roadside restaurant.</p>

  <p>'I hope you like sea-food,' said Mr. Fuessli, as they walked their way
  amongst innumerable cars towards an entrance festooned with life-belts.</p>

  <p>'Sea-food?... Er... fish, that is? Oh yes, I do, indeed.' (Which was true
  enough, though this 'sea-food' set Charles thinking that he also enjoyed
  'land-food', if such a term could be used to describe a really delicious
  entrecôte, or perhaps the poulet sauté américain, which was, he supposed, the
  nearest approach to a national dish.)</p>

  <p>'Then I can promise you something worth waiting for,' continued Mr.
  Fuessli, pushing into the lobby.</p>

  <p>It soon became clear to Charles that 'waiting for' had been no idle
  phrase; for the place was crowded, the restaurateur did not greet them, no
  table had been reserved, and there were twenty or thirty patrons standing in
  line for the next one available.</p>

  <p>'I guess you have to stand in line for EVERYTHING in England,' said Mrs.
  Fuessli.</p>

  <p>'I believe my housekeeper does it very often,' answered Charles,
  gently.</p>

  <p>Not by a word or gesture did he convey his real emotions, and the only
  additional comment he permitted himself was at the spectacle of so many
  children waiting&mdash;and by no means all of them good-mannered like Gerald
  and Louise. 'These youngsters,' said Charles tentatively. 'They
  &mdash;er&mdash;they don't... their parents, I mean... do they&mdash;er
  &mdash;take them in to dinner here?'</p>

  <p>'Sure,' answered Mr. Fuessli. 'What else can they do with them?'</p>

  <p>'They look a little tired&mdash;the children, I mean.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, it's just the drive. Kids love it, anyway. Besides, you can't leave
  'em at home without a sitter, and you can't always get a sitter, especially
  on Sundays.'</p>

  <p>And true enough, when at last their turn came for a table Charles observed
  that the dining-room was quite overpopulated with children&mdash;some, like
  Louise, young enough to occupy high chairs supplied by the restaurant.</p>

  <p>'So they ENCOURAGE them to come here?' Charles mused, still grappling with
  his private astonishment.</p>

  <p>'Oh, not by themselves&mdash;only with grown-ups,' Mr. Fuessli replied.
  'Gosh, no&mdash;think of what this place would be like if they let the kids
  come in alone!'</p>

  <p>Charles thought of it, and found the speculation indeed appalling. He
  noted meanwhile that there was even a special children's dinner at half-price
  &mdash;which Gerald and Louise both ate with relish. The sea-food,
  incidentally, proved to be excellent, and the Californian wine that Mr.
  Fuessli ordered was equal to some Charles had tasted from far more familiar
  bottles.</p>

  <p>Over coffee, which they drank in a hurry because the line in the lobby was
  still long, Charles was anxious to dispel any impression that he had not
  thoroughly enjoyed himself. 'You mustn't think I don't appreciate your taking
  Gerald with you like this. It's just that&mdash;well, I suppose one gets used
  to old-fashioned ideas in England&mdash;I mean, that children have their
  meals in the nursery and go to bed soon afterwards... and besides, of course,
  we don't have places like this, even in peacetime.'</p>

  <p>'Maybe you would have,' said Mr. Fuessli, 'if there was a demand for
  them.' (He had always found this principle valid in the hardware
  business.)</p>

  <p>'That's very possible,' Charles agreed. 'And perhaps the truth is that
  some of us in England are TOO old-fashioned... for instance, I was twenty-one
  before my own father ever took me out to dinner.'</p>

  <p>The Fuesslis looked incredulous.</p>

  <p>Charles smiled. 'Of course that was overdoing it. I'll initiate Gerald
  much earlier.'</p>

  <p>'INITIATE him?' Mrs. Fuessli echoed.</p>

  <p>'In a sort of way. After all, there's a good deal of ritual in it&mdash;
  how to explore a French menu, the wines that go best with various foods,
  clothes to wear on different occasions, what people to tip and how much
  &mdash;quite a lot to learn.'</p>

  <p>'Don't you think one can pick up things like that without exactly learning
  them?' asked Mr. Fuessli.</p>

  <p>'Better to learn them, then you don't pick them up wrong.' Charles did not
  intend to be either didactic or crushing, but he thought he might have
  sounded a little of both and it disconcerted him.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Fuessli twinkled. 'And when do you think Gerry will be ready to start
  learning?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I'd say when he's at Cambridge&mdash;maybe eighteen or nineteen.'
  Charles added, lest he should seem to be taking the whole thing far too
  seriously: 'I'm already looking forward to it&mdash;a grand excuse to give
  myself what Lord Curzon once called a beano.'</p>

  <p>They did not understand the allusion, so he had to explain that 'beano'
  was a sound if somewhat proletarian English word meaning 'a good time'
  (derived from 'beanfeast'), but that Lord Curzon, a man of unproletarian
  perspectives, had assumed from its appearance that the word was Italian, and
  had therefore pronounced it 'bay-ah-no'. Charles enjoyed dissecting the joke
  (for it had always had for him a flavour incommunicable perhaps to those who
  had not known Lord Curzon professionally); he hoped it might at least
  convince the Fuesslis that he had a sense of humour. But they merely smiled
  in a rather vague way, and after a pause Mrs. Fuessli returned to the subject
  of Gerald's 'initiation'.</p>

  <p>'And where will you go when you first take him to dinner?' she asked.
  'Have you planned that too?'</p>

  <p>'You mean the name of the restaurant? Let's see now... might be
  Michelet's. You know it? You know London? It's near the Covent Garden market.
  Festive but good.'</p>

  <p>'Was that where your father took you?'</p>

  <p>'Oh no, I don't think Michelet's was in existence then. We just dined at
  his club and had the ordinary club dinner&mdash;nothing special, except for
  the novelty it was to me.'</p>

  <p>'But you'd rather have Michelet's for Gerry?'</p>

  <p>'<i>I</i> would, yes&mdash;French cooking for me, any time&mdash;even the
  best London clubs aren't famous for their...' He realized that this was
  dangerous ground; the Fuesslis might think he was dissatisfied with their own
  table, which he certainly wasn't&mdash;after England in wartime it was
  wonderful. He broke off by adding: 'Please don't think this is an old family
  tradition or anything absurd like that. It's just that as soon as Gerald's
  old enough there are so many things I'm looking forward to.'</p>

  <p>He had to break off again because Mrs. Fuessli was giggling and he knew it
  was at himself. 'Oh, do make it SEVENTEEN&mdash;not eighteen or nineteen
  &mdash;when you take him to Michelet's,' she pleaded. She looked very impish
  and provocative in such a mood. 'Because he'll grow up fast in America
  &mdash;our boys of seventeen are almost men.'</p>

  <p>Charles thought that this might possibly be true if by men she meant (as
  she doubtless did) American men; and he reflected again how charming she was,
  and (with a rueful glance at Mr. Fuessli, who was bald and overweight) how
  secure must be the position of American womanhood.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Fuessli then turned to Gerald. 'Gerry dear, wouldn't you like to have
  your dad take you to dinner in a big London restaurant on your seventeenth
  birthday?'</p>

  <p>'Not really BIG&mdash;' Charles was murmuring, but Gerald, with his mouth
  full of chocolate ice-cream, was already expressing some kind of inarticulate
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>'You see he WOULD, Mr. Anderson... Gerry, make sure you remind him when
  the time comes... SEVENTEEN, Mr. Anderson&mdash;remember that.'</p>

  <p>Charles, basking in the thought that Mrs. Fuessli must like him at least
  enough to make fun of him, felt indulgent&mdash;a little puzzled by, but also
  warm to his hosts. 'All right. Seventeen it shall be. Gerald, you and I have
  a date.' He laughed, and hoped the Americanism did not come from him too
  solemnly.</p>

  <p>Hence, in part, the letter Charles wrote to Gerald in Switzerland eleven
  years later. Of course he had taken the boy out to dinner countless times
  already, and for that matter Michelet's had gone (victim of a V2 during the
  last year of the war); yet the memory of that conversation at Parson's Corner
  had impressed on Charles an obligation which he assumed all the more gladly
  because he could call to mind Mrs. Fuessli's pretty face.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Whatever else about him was in doubt, there could be none
about his
  genuine affection for his son. It was not only his deepest emotion, it was
  his most difficult, and he was a man who found many of his emotions
  difficult. Actually, the seventeenth-birthday dinner soon became far more
  than a pleasure to be looked forward to; it grew to be a symbol in his mind
  of something he hoped would eventually flourish&mdash;an adult, man-to-man
  friendship between father and son. During the decade that followed his visit
  to Parson's Corner Charles had seen Gerald rather infrequently, even after
  the boy's return from America, for then had come the school years, with
  holidays often spent at the home of school friends, since it was usually
  impossible to fit them in with Charles's periods of leave. But most of all,
  he was a shy man with children, and had no knack of dealing with them; he was
  afraid he bored them, and his unwillingness to do so made him tend to keep
  out of their way. All of which, in Gerald's case, was surely only temporary.
  Charles had pinned his faith on some change taking place quite suddenly some
  day&mdash;some liquefaction of his emotions, and of Gerald's, as miraculous
  as that of the blood of St. Januarius.</p>

  <p>And now, in Paris, as he endured long sultry hours at the Conference, his
  thoughts often wandered to Switzerland, where Gerald was enjoying a walking
  tour with some friends of his own age, accompanied by a young schoolmaster
  who presumably had the knack that Charles lacked. Charles envied that
  schoolmaster, though he would not have changed places with him for the
  world.</p>

  <p>Another man whom Charles would not have changed places with was his
  opposite number on the other side of the Conference table&mdash;a fellow
  named Palan. Palan's own chief was monolithic and taciturn; unlike Sir
  Malcolm Bingay he left most of the talking to his subordinate. Perhaps the
  monolith spoke neither French nor English&mdash;Charles could not decide. Nor
  could he decide whether he himself would like to measure himself in debate
  against this fellow Palan or not; at times he was glad that Sir Malcolm bore
  the brunt, but at other times he had a curious desire to justify himself in
  Palan's eyes&mdash;to prove that he, too, though only second-in-command, was
  just as capable of performing a virtuoso job. Or WAS he just as capable? He
  kept studying Palan and wondering. Palan had, indeed, begun to fascinate
  Charles from the opening day of the Conference. He was plump and swarthy,
  careless of manners, certainly not the kind of person that an old-style
  diplomat could ever have felt at home with across any kind of table. Nor did
  Charles, yet he envied the man's animal vitality and impassioned voice that
  could carry so easily across a room (Charles knew from experience that his
  own gentler and more pleasing tenor was far less pervasive); he hated Palan's
  deplorable French accent, yet marvelled at his complete lack of embarrassment
  in exhibiting it&mdash;a lack that almost amounted to a skill. Charles had
  also watched with mixed emotions Palan's habit of loosening his collar when
  his neck began to sweat, and the way he proudly observed the contents of his
  handkerchief whenever he noisily blew his nose. 'Vox et praeterea nihil,'
  muttered Charles to Sir Malcolm on one such occasion, hoping his superior
  would see the little joke. But Sir Malcolm was either not a Latinist or else
  in a bad humour; he did not even smile.</p>

  <p>The trouble was that so far Palan seemed to have scored rather heavily.
  Even in his bad French he had drawn laughs from the other delegates at the
  expense of Sir Malcolm, and Sir Malcolm had found it possible to keep his
  temper in public only by losing it a little in private. Charles had had to
  endure this too. There were times when he would have been relieved to learn,
  on rejoining the Conference for another session, that Palan had been run over
  by a taxi during the interval. And yet... in a way he could not exactly
  analyse he felt a quality in Palan that made him picture himself victorious,
  but also magnanimous, over such a foe... He imagined himself saying, at some
  reception after a draft agreement had been signed on all the terms that
  Palan's side had at first violently opposed: 'I trust, M'sieur Palan, there
  are no hard feelings between us. For myself, and speaking also on behalf of
  Sir Malcolm Bingay, who is unfortunately confined to his bed by a severe
  attack of arthritis&mdash;I can assure you, etc. etc...' It would sound good
  in his own perfect French.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately nothing of all this seemed likely, except perhaps Sir
  Malcolm's arthritis, which did indeed get worse as the Conference
  proceeded.</p>

  <p>Once, in the street outside the building in which the Conference was being
  held, a little girl of nine or ten presented Palan with a bunch of flowers.
  Palan picked up the child in his arms and kissed her. A few bystanders
  smiled. Charles, who had been a witness from a distance, turned away as shyly
  as if the incident had involved himself. Again he envied Palan.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">How refreshing, amidst these encounters and experiences, to
think of
  Gerald's arrival and the birthday dinner. As soon as he had received the
  answering wire Charles went to the Cheval Noir, a small restaurant near the
  Champs Elysées, which was a favourite of his&mdash;not one of those famous
  institutions like Prunier's or Voisin's, meccas for tourists, but the sort of
  place he would have been disappointed to hear spoken of by any Englishman or
  American, and that he himself was careful never to recommend. At the Cheval
  Noir he talked to Henri. Of course the dinner was not to be planned in
  detail&mdash;it was part of Charles's anticipated pleasure that he would
  discuss such important matters with Gerald and (using all the tact of which
  he was capable) let the boy seem to be making his own decisions. But there
  could be no harm in considering possibilities. Only a simple dinner
  &mdash;soup, fish, then flesh or fowl of the kind that Henri knew how to cook
  as well as any man in Europe. No cocktails beforehand, but perhaps a glass of
  Vino de Pasto&mdash;no champagne (unless Gerald seemed disappointed by its
  absence), but a Chablis and then one of those honest Burgundies&mdash;say a
  Chambertin... And crêpes Suzette to follow, as a sporting concession to a
  youthful palate&mdash;Charles himself was not fond of them (just dressed-up
  pancakes, after all), but they did offer a spectacle in the festive mood.
  Then brandy&mdash;just a plain good one &mdash;and finally, if Gerald wanted
  to take a small chance or to show off, a very mild and thin cigar, even if he
  put it down after a few whiffs... And during all this they would be talking,
  their minds released by the warmth and the wine and by the emerging
  phenomenon of their mutual discovery; they would talk till near
  midnight&mdash;father and son, aware of a new relationship... they would
  gossip, exchange adult confidences, perhaps even a few slightly risqué
  stories... And then last of all, if the intimacy had proceeded so far, and if
  Gerald felt that the evening was still young, they might take a taxi to the
  Place Pigalle for another kind of initiation. Charles believed that a trial
  crop of wild oats should be sown under experienced sponsorship&mdash;nothing
  extreme, of course&mdash;just a visit to one of those rather absurd places
  where it could do a young man no harm to get his first sight of a row of nude
  women cavorting so closely that one could see all their imperfections.</p>

  <p>How pleasant to think of these things, to plan them gently in his mind
  while Palan bellowed his abominable French amidst the gilt-framed mirrors and
  Buhl cabinets that seemed, by their contrasting elegance, to focus the whole
  eye of the past upon the world's deplorable present.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">On the day of Gerald's arrival events at the Conference had
been
  particularly trying. To begin with, Sir Malcolm's arthritis had forced him to
  quit at the lunch interval and leave affairs during the afternoon in
  Charles's hands, and this, which in normal circumstances would have been both
  a challenge and an opportunity, turned out much more like an ordeal. For
  Palan, under the silent surveillance of his own superior, had concentrated
  upon Charles with a certain grim joyousness that had been just amusing enough
  to keep the Conference room in the wrong kind of good humour; Charles had a
  feeling he was being baited, and that even a few of his colleagues were
  enjoying the performance. Not that Charles lacked weapons of his own. He was
  sound if somewhat precise in argument; he had an expert's knowledge of the
  matters being discussed; he was also patient, often witty, and unfailingly
  polite. He could not bring himself to show temper, even when he felt it
  rising within himself; whereas Palan, he suspected, often put on an act of
  temper when he felt none. Moreover, Charles had acquired a masterly technique
  of listening with apparent equanimity while he was being ridiculed. 'M'sieur
  Anderson is, of course, a man of much greater diplomatic experience than I,'
  Palan had mocked, 'but I would venture to match my knowledge of the world
  against his, for when you have probed behind all the statistics in blue books
  and white papers, when you have got down to the bedrock of reality, what is
  it that you find? Is it merely a diplomatic game, to be played by those who
  have been to the right school and college like M'sieur Anderson, or is it
  LIFE?' And all that sort of thing.</p>

  <p>Charles had replied: 'M'sieur Palan is in error if he supposes that I
  regard these proceedings as a game. Since I dislike games I am certainly
  under no temptation to adopt such an attitude.' (A few titters from his
  neighbours.) 'And as for M'sieur Palan's knowledge of the world, I have no
  means of computing it, but I should not readily assume it to be greater than
  mine, though doubtless it has been of a very different kind of world.' There
  had been a general laugh at that, but Charles had not been quite certain at
  whose expense.</p>

  <p>Throughout the afternoon they had sparred, and more and more it had seemed
  to Charles that Palan was regarding him as a personal adversary. By the time
  of the adjournment Charles could only pray that Sir Malcolm's arthritis would
  improve enough for him to take over the following morning. Charles felt that
  though he had done quite creditably as a substitute, it had worn some frayed
  edges on his nerves.</p>

  <p>His spirits rose, however, as he waited on the platform at the Gare de
  l'Est. It was good to have a growing-up son, and he thought happily of the
  corner table at the Cheval Noir which Henri was doubtless already preparing.
  The train came in, with the familiar place names attached to its coaches
  &mdash;Berne, Delle, Vesoul, Chaumont, Troyes... It had been Gerald's first
  European trip&mdash;what magic it must have contained, and now to culminate
  so fittingly!</p>

  <p>Charles was still thinking of that when his son spotted him first. 'Hello,
  dad... I didn't really expect you to meet me&mdash;I thought you'd be too
  busy.'</p>

  <p>'My dear boy...' They shook hands. 'However busy I am, I'd take time off
  for this, I assure you.'</p>

  <p>The noise of the station excused him from saying more. Gerald was
  instructing the porter who had carried his luggage&mdash;a small suitcase
  &mdash;from the train. Charles was tactful enough not to correct or amplify
  the boy's halting French, but he did, with his own French, summon a taxi and
  ask the driver to put the suitcase in the cab. Gerald then tipped the porter
  a hundred-franc note and Charles told the driver to take them to the
  Crillon.</p>

  <p>As the taxi left the station Charles said: 'How times have changed&mdash;
  I can remember when a hundred francs was really money! But the city hasn't
  lost its fascination. Did you see much of it on your way out?'</p>

  <p>'Not a thing. The train just shunted into some station in the middle of
  the night. I was half asleep.'</p>

  <p>'Ah yes, the Ceinture.' Charles could not repress an emotion of
  astonishment&mdash;that anyone who had never seen Paris before could allow
  himself to be taken in and out without even leaving the train for a quick
  look. 'You were here once when you were a baby&mdash;just passing through.
  But this can be called your first real visit.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I know I ought to get a thrill.' The boy was peering through the
  window. 'I must say everything looks a bit run down after Switzerland.'</p>

  <p>'Everything is. France, remember, has been through two world wars.'</p>

  <p>'And the Swiss have been sitting pretty, I know. But the mountains&mdash;
  the clean air&mdash;I think that's really more in my line than big
  cities.'</p>

  <p>'You went to the right country, then. You look very fit. And still growing
  &mdash;or is it my imagination?'</p>

  <p>Gerald was a little shy of his height, which was already six foot one. He
  laughed. 'Oh, I hope not, or I'll be a freak. I think I've stopped,
  though.'</p>

  <p>'I sometimes wish I had an inch or two more myself. Not that five feet
  nine is really short. But you can look over my head.'</p>

  <p>'It's useful in climbing,' Gerald admitted.</p>

  <p>'Did you do much of that?'</p>

  <p>'Just Pilatus and the Faulhorn and some of the easier ones.'</p>

  <p>Charles was suddenly aware of an emotion which, in a younger man and in
  connection with a woman, he would have diagnosed as jealousy. 'So you got
  along all right with that schoolmaster&mdash;I forget his name?'</p>

  <p>'Tubby Conklin? Oh, he isn't so bad when you get to know him. Not really
  stuffy&mdash;just a bit of a watchdog. I suppose he felt he had to be, with
  all of us on his hands.'</p>

  <p>STUFFY. Charles caught the word as if it had been a hit below the belt,
  but immediately decided that Gerald was unlikely to have heard of the
  nickname&mdash;and if he had, as he must sooner or later, what did it matter?
  Perhaps that was one of the confessions that would develop so naturally
  towards midnight at the Cheval Noir. He imagined an opening. 'D'you know what
  they call me at the Office, Gerald? STUFFY Anderson.' (Pause for merriment.)
  'I suppose having any sort of nickname's a good sign&mdash; after all, they
  called Disraeli Dizzy, but you can't imagine Gladstone ever being called
  Gladdy... Gladwyn Jebb, perhaps, but not Gladstone... I hope, though, I'm not
  TOO stuffy. Now that you're old enough to judge, you must tell me if ever you
  think I am.' Perhaps he would be able to talk like that before the evening
  was over.</p>

  <p>Gerald was still staring out of the taxi window. 'Where are we going,
  dad?'</p>

  <p>'The Crillon. My hotel. I thought you might like a bath before dinner. I
  have to change myself anyhow.'</p>

  <p>'Change? You mean&mdash;' Gerald looked round and seemed to be studying
  his father's attire.</p>

  <p>'Well, I had thought of a black tie in your honour.'</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid I didn't bring&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Oh, then it doesn't matter. I'll wear what I have on, and if your lounge
  suit needs pressing the hotel people can do it in a hurry.'</p>

  <p>'I'm terribly sorry, Dad, but I'll have to wear what I have on, too. All
  my clothes went through in a trunk to London&mdash;this bag's only got
  souvenirs and things in it&mdash;'</p>

  <p>What Gerald had on included an open-necked shirt, tweed jacket, and grey
  flannel trousers.</p>

  <p>Charles smiled. 'You could have something of mine, but since you've grown
  so tall I rather doubt... Well, the only real essential is a tie&mdash; which
  I CAN provide. I can also lend you pyjamas.'</p>

  <p>'Pyjamas?'</p>

  <p>'In case you forgot to pack them. And don't worry about a room&mdash;the
  Crillon can fix you up in my suite.'</p>

  <p>'But I&mdash;I'm&mdash;I wasn't planning to stay overnight. I'm booked
  through on the boat train from St. Lazare&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Tonight?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I'm terribly sorry if&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Charles was hurt, but did not want to hurt himself more by showing it.
  'You didn't say so, and I'm afraid I assumed&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I didn't think it mattered so long as there was time for dinner.'</p>

  <p>'Of course. Oh, of course. Though if you wished I daresay even as late as
  this I could have your train ticket changed&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Except that I&mdash;I'd&mdash;well, actually I'd planned to join up with
  some of the others on the boat-train&mdash;some of the people I'd been
  with&mdash;I sort of promised... And then I've got dates in London tomorrow
  &mdash;Mallinson, for one&mdash;he has to fix a filling that came loose, so
  you see...'</p>

  <p>'My dear boy, that's all right&mdash;don't let it bother you. I'm glad
  you're careful of your teeth&mdash;most important... Well, here we are
  &mdash;the Place de la Concorde&mdash;one of the great sights of the world,
  and the best time to see it is about now when the lights are just coming on.
  Rather splendid, don't you think?'</p>

  <p>Gerald seemed much more impressed by his father's suite when they reached
  it. 'The British taxpayer certainly has to shell out for this,' he commented,
  walking around.</p>

  <p>'Only because the British Government is anxious that its representatives
  abroad should not appear as impoverished as they usually are.'</p>

  <p>Gerald grinned. 'Are WE impoverished?'</p>

  <p>'We certainly should be if we had to live on my salary.'</p>

  <p>'Ah... so the old family fortune's standing up pretty well?'</p>

  <p>Charles was never quite sure when Gerald was having fun with him, or what
  kind of fun it was. He answered, half seriously: 'It isn't much of a fortune,
  after inflation and taxes. But you needn't worry.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I don't... You know, dad, if I were you I'd spend every penny during
  the next ten years or so, then you'd be sure of enjoying yourself. Or is that
  a crazy idea?'</p>

  <p>'Not at all. You'd be surprised how popular it seems to be&mdash;hence in
  part the present state of Europe. But don't get me on to politics or I shall
  say the kind of things that annoy Sir Malcolm.'</p>

  <p>'Your boss?'</p>

  <p>'Boss, chief, or head of department.'</p>

  <p>'Like rod, pole, or perch?'</p>

  <p>'Exactly.'</p>

  <p>'What kind of chap is he?'</p>

  <p>'Very able. I'd introduce you if he were staying here, but he prefers the
  Embassy. A fine diplomat and&mdash;so they say&mdash;an EXCEEDINGLY fine
  bridge player.'</p>

  <p>'I guess all that means you don't like him much.'</p>

  <p>'Oh now, come, come,' protested Charles with restrained glee. 'You mustn't
  guess anything of the sort. Sir Malcolm and I work very well in harness. But
  even a horse doesn't want to be in harness all the time.'</p>

  <p>Gerald laughed heartily, and Charles thought that the evening, after a
  somewhat inauspicious start, was proceeding well.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">An hour later they were at the corner table in the Cheval
Noir with Henri
  hovering about them like a benign and elderly angel. Charles introduced
  Gerald proudly. 'Henri, I want you to meet my son. Quite an occasion&mdash;
  his first evening in Paris as well as his seventeenth birthday.'</p>

  <p>Henri bowed, but Gerald offered his hand; Charles was pleased at this
  &mdash;it was intelligent of the boy to realize that Henri was not just an
  ordinary restaurant keeper. After the exchange of civilities Charles added:
  'Henri is one of mankind's truest benefactors&mdash;his hu tres Mornay puts
  him with Cellini and Michelangelo. Too bad they're out of season&mdash;
  oysters, I mean.'</p>

  <p>After Henri, beaming at the compliment, had gone off, Gerald said: 'Do you
  really think cooking's an art like painting, dad?'</p>

  <p>'A much HIGHER art than some modern painting. Anyhow, it's a polite thing
  to say to a cook who really is an artist.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose being a diplomat you get a lot of practice saying polite
  things.'</p>

  <p>'I wish I got more. I sometimes feel at a disadvantage because I'm not
  equally proficient in saying nasty things.' He was thinking of Palan.</p>

  <p>'Why's that?'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps because the world isn't getting any better.' Charles rallied
  himself from the dark reflection. 'Though I must admit I see it looking
  pretty good here and now.' Henri was serving the Vino de Pasto. 'I'm very
  happy to be with you tonight, Gerald. I drink an affectionate toast to your
  future.'</p>

  <p>Gerald grinned embarrassedly, then sipped from his glass. 'Thanks, dad. Is
  this sherry?'</p>

  <p>'Yes... Smoke a cigarette if you like&mdash;it's the only wine that isn't
  spoiled by smoking.' Charles, proffering his cigarette case, thought he had
  conveyed his hint rather tactfully. 'I hope you like it.'</p>

  <p>'It's&mdash;well, I daresay one could get used to it.'</p>

  <p>'Just about my own first reaction. That, I remember, was at a Foundation
  dinner at Cambridge. I mixed my drinks rather recklessly&mdash;with the
  inevitable result. My gyp told me afterwards I'd tried to festoon the chapel
  belfry with toilet paper.'</p>

  <p>Gerald laughed. 'It's hard to imagine you ever getting drunk.'</p>

  <p>'That's because you think of me as I am today.'</p>

  <p>'Or else because I really don't know you properly.'</p>

  <p>The remark, so seemingly cold, was actually warm to Charles; it hinted
  that Gerald too was aware of the barrier and that such awareness might be a
  first step towards their joint effort to remove it. He said agreeably: 'I've
  often thought that's one of the biggest drawbacks of a career like mine.
  Chopping and changing posts, with you in England half the time when you were
  a baby, then the war came and you went to America, and even after that there
  was school and we could only meet during the holidays if I happened to be in
  London. The wonder is we know each other at all. But now you're getting older
  and I'm not likely to be abroad so much, things ought to work out
  better.'</p>

  <p>Charles waited for a word of encouragement, then decided that the boy's
  friendly face was itself one. He continued: 'Besides, I'll be off duty for
  good in a few more years. I'd thought of buying a place in the country if I
  can find something that isn't too huge or too cute. How would you like
  that?'</p>

  <p>'You mean a place like Beeching, dad?'</p>

  <p>'Oh no, much humbler... but I'm sure you don't remember Beeching.'</p>

  <p>'I do&mdash;because I remember Grandfather there.'</p>

  <p>'Really?'</p>

  <p>'There was a big white fireplace and once a hot coal fell out on the rug
  and Grandfather squirted soda water over it. I think that's really the first
  thing I remember about anything.'</p>

  <p>'I don't recall the incident, but there was certainly a big white marble
  fireplace in the hall, so perhaps you're right... Much TOO big&mdash;the
  fireplaces and everything else&mdash;we used to consume fifty tons of coal a
  year and still the rooms were chilly in the winter. Think of trying to get
  fifty tons of coal nowadays to heat a private house... No, the place I might
  look for would be small and modern&mdash;just to settle down in after I've
  retired. Not too far out of London, but quiet.'</p>

  <p>'You might be lonely. You're so used to London.'</p>

  <p>'Don't forget there's the book I'll be writing.'</p>

  <p>'You're really going to do it?'</p>

  <p>Charles smiled; the book was almost a joke because it had been talked
  about for so long. Whenever Charles said anything witty at a dinner party,
  which was fairly often, people were always apt to exclaim: 'You know,
  Charles,' (or 'Stuffy' if the occasion were intimate or ribald enough) 'you
  really ought to write a book some day', to which Charles would answer either
  thoughtfully 'Yes, I suppose I might', or confidently 'That's exactly what I
  intend to do.' But nobody really believed he would, whatever he said; somehow
  he dined out too often and lived too elegantly to seem capable of such
  sustained effort. So one day the book would astonish everyone by actually
  appearing&mdash;published by Macmillan, he hoped, and at not more than
  twenty-five shillings, if the price of things didn't go up any more. But it
  would offer a further surprise by being the kind of book few would expect
  from him&mdash;a really serious and authoritative piece of work&mdash;in
  fact, that of a man WHO OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN MADE AN AMBASSADOR. Charles could
  even extract wry satisfaction from the thought that this lesson would be
  learned too late, for he was fairly certain now that it WOULD be too late. He
  was disappointed, but realized that the character he had built up for himself
  would not allow him to show it.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, it was his secret intention that the book should reveal rather
  startlingly that behind the façade he really did know his job, and it pleased
  him in rueful moods to invent comments he would most like his friends to
  make&mdash;not to him but amongst themselves. 'Really, you know, I've read
  worse. Well-documented&mdash;almost scholarly in spots. Didn't think Stuffy
  had it in him. The Observer gives it the big article&mdash;calls it "a
  footnote to history".' The phrase suited Charles's humility at the shrine of
  Clio, and also his own experience, derived from Gibbon, that footnotes were
  apt to be more interesting than the larger print. Not, of course, that there
  would be much of that sort of thing in it&mdash;just a few titbits here and
  there... mostly it would deal with the Balkan and Greco-Turkish problems,
  would record matters of which he had been both witness and student, such as
  that delineation of the Macedonian frontier that had made him (for what it
  was worth, and it appeared nowadays to be worth nothing) the greatest living
  authority on the ethnographic history of the Sanjak of Belar-Novo. (Which was
  the only unique distinction he ever claimed for himself, and often, like so
  much else that he said, it raised a laugh.)</p>

  <p>So he replied to Gerald, thinking of all this and trying not to seem
  portentous: 'I really ought to tackle the damn thing, Gerald. My career,
  though far from outstanding, hasn't been entirely uneventful... Rome&mdash;
  Bucharest&mdash;Athens&mdash;I happened to be there at interesting times. And
  other places. Some day I'll tell you about them.'</p>

  <p>'I'm looking forward to the book.'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, that would probably be easier for both of us. You could skip when
  you were bored.'</p>

  <p>Gerald gave his father an appraising glance which he turned into a smile.
  'You know, dad, you're a bit prickly, aren't you?'</p>

  <p>'Prickly?' Now came the perfect cue. 'I've been called STUFFY in my time,
  but PRICKLY... Well...'</p>

  <p>But Gerald passed over 'stuffy' without interest. 'I mean, you put up your
  defences even when nobody's attacking.'</p>

  <p>'Do I? Maybe a conditioned reflex after so many years in the Service. I'll
  try to unlearn it when I'm just a retired old has-been writing a few pages a
  day in that terrible handwriting of mine&mdash;or perhaps I ought to learn to
  type and spare the eyesight of some unfortunate secretary.'</p>

  <p>'How long do you think it will take you?'</p>

  <p>'Two or three years&mdash;maybe more. I won't mind.'</p>

  <p>'Sort of a labour of love?'</p>

  <p>'Well, certainly not of profit. As I said, my career hasn't been
  outstanding enough to send the public scurrying to the bookshops.'</p>

  <p>'Still feeling prickly? I don't know what's eating you, but I'd say you
  haven't done so badly. Whatever sort of life you've had, you're fifty-three
  and you don't look anything like it.'</p>

  <p>Charles beamed; from his own son, on his own son's seventeenth birthday,
  and at such a moment, there could have come no more timely reassurance.
  'Fifty-TWO,' he corrected. 'Not fifty-THREE. I was born at the turn of the
  century, on July 28th, 1900.'</p>

  <p>'That's a fine beginning. The Story of My Life, by Charles Anderson.
  Chapter One: "Early Years".'</p>

  <p>'Good heavens, no; not that sort of thing at all. It's my WORK I shall
  deal with&mdash;I'll begin when I took up my first post.'</p>

  <p>'Why? What's wrong about the early years? Didn't you have a good time
  then?'</p>

  <p>'Of course.' Charles seemed slightly embarrassed. 'Nothing to complain of.
  That's why there wouldn't be much to write about.'</p>

  <p>'NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF'</p>

  <p>Charles had just finished prep school in the summer of 1914; he started at
  Brookfield while those tremendous opening battles of the First World War were
  ending an age. The Somme, Jutland, and Passchendaele came to him later as
  headlines in the daily papers that reached Brookfield about mid-morning, at
  which time the school butler clamped them to the stands in the reading-room.
  Not till the lunch hour did the boys get a hasty glimpse over the shoulders
  of other boys, and usually after they had satisfied a much greater eagerness
  to discover who was on the list for the afternoon's compulsory games. There
  was neither stupidity nor callousness in this&mdash;merely the knack (so
  often necessary in life) of putting first things second. Many of them had
  brothers and some fathers in the war; all knew that if it lasted long enough
  they would be in it themselves. Charles had joined the school cadet corps,
  and with more effort than zeal was picking up the rudiments of being a
  soldier, drilling twice a week under a ferocious sergeant who taught him
  exactly where to lunge into an enemy's body with a bayonet. He did not think
  he would be very good at it, and was comforted to learn from Old Boys on
  leave from the front that most fighting was done with other weapons. In the
  evenings, when drills and games and lessons were over for the day, he relaxed
  in his School House study talking to friends and drinking coffee&mdash;
  sometimes, when he was on his own, reading poetry. He even wrote some, which
  was duly published in the Brookfeldian under the pseudonym 'Vincio'. It had
  no special merit.</p>

  <p>The school was then in charge of old 'Chips', who had been summoned from
  retirement to plug a hole in the wartime shortage of masters. Chips ran
  things with a benignity that made Brookfield more than tolerable to several
  boys who might otherwise have found it unpleasant. Charles was among them
  &mdash;by no means a misfit, but temperamentally not what many people would
  have called a typical public schoolboy. Since Chips doubted that such an
  animal existed Charles got along with him very well indeed, and it was Chips
  who made him a prefect despite warnings that boys who were bad at games were
  rarely good in authority. Charles, however, proved excellent&mdash;somewhat
  on the lenient side, but wise in his decisions and a steady handler of
  crisis. One of his duties was to keep order in the junior dormitories during
  the hour before lights-out, and he found this easiest to do by being friendly
  and chatty. The youngsters liked him and called him 'Andy', a nickname that
  spread throughout the school. On Sunday nights he would read aloud a chapter
  from some favourite blood-curdler; he read well and enjoyed reading, and
  once, during a tense moment in Dracula, a listener fainted&mdash;an event
  which gave Charles singular and lasting renown.</p>

  <p>Considering that he was bad at games (which he pretended to enjoy,
  nevertheless, but which he actually detested), Charles was quite popular at
  Brookfield, and fairly, though not enormously, happy there. He made a few
  close friends who stayed friends in later years, and besides Chips there was
  another master who influenced him&mdash;a young Frenchman named Brunon who
  visited the school once a week to give art lessons to a few eccentrics. Art
  at Brookfield was an alternative to chemistry; on reaching the fifth form one
  could choose, and as the laboratory promised better fun than the studio, it
  was favoured by most. But Charles liked M. Brunon and was encouraged by him
  to develop an aptitude for painting, so that he whiled away many a pleasant
  hour in the school grounds, producing small water-colour landscapes so
  quickly that he would often give them away to onlookers and thus conciliate
  those who might otherwise have scoffed at such a hobby. One such painting by
  Charles hangs in the head's study at Brookfield today; it shows the school
  roofs beyond the trees in winter when clouds are rolling up for a storm. It
  is not as mediocre as the poetry he wrote (indeed, for his age, it shows
  distinct promise), but its chief interest perhaps is that a schoolboy should
  have wanted to go out in such weather for such a purpose. You can almost see
  that the clouds on the horizon will bring snow, not rain.</p>

  <p>Like most male members of his family, Charles was intended for Cambridge
  when the time should come, and it was Chips again who suggested his entering
  for a history scholarship, despite an absence of encouragement from home.
  Charles did not win the scholarship, but came so near to it that he was
  awarded an exhibition entitling him to enter the University in the following
  September&mdash;that is, if the army did not claim him first, which it
  probably would.</p>

  <p>His last term at Brookfield was in the summer of 1918, when the war,
  despite a heartening turn of the tide, still looked desperately far from a
  finish. He was now of military age, but found that by joining the Cambridge
  University O.T.C. he could, for a short time at least, combine the profession
  of arms with actual residence at a college. It seemed a miraculous device for
  getting a little pleasure before being killed, for at that stage of the war
  second-lieutenants on the Western Front did not live long. To Charles the war
  was something he would face, like compulsory games, when he had to, but he
  had no romantic illusions, and the poetry he wrote, if it ever touched on the
  subject, was more in the spirit of Siegfried Sassoon than of Rupert
  Brooke.</p>

  <p>During that autumn of final battles that few could guess were final,
  Charles formed fours on the cobbled quadrangles and night-manoeuvred on the
  fenlands along the Ely road. He wore a uniform that looked like an officer's,
  and sometimes on dark days he was mistakenly saluted by non-commissioned men
  on leave from France. When this happened he felt he wanted to run after them
  and apologize, but of course that would have been absurd; so he either
  saluted back, which seemed presumptuous and was certainly incorrect, or else
  ignored them, which made him feel churlish. (The problem, with its absence of
  any completely satisfying solution, was a sample of many that plagued him in
  later affairs.) In the main, though, life was pleasant and not too military
  &mdash;the O.T.C. adjutant, for instance, was a history professor who could
  lecture on the machine gun as gently as on the Holy Roman Empire.</p>

  <p>Charles was given college rooms that dated from the early seventeenth
  century, and when he returned to them after a route-march old Debden, who was
  his gyp, always had a hip-bath and a can of warm water waiting in front of
  the sitting-room fire. (The college had not yet installed any other kind of
  baths.) After rinsing himself in this meagre but traditional fashion Charles
  would dress, drink a cup of tea, and sally forth into the twilit town. The
  buildings in the narrow streets had an air of stooping over him protectively
  as he walked; he liked to push open the side-door of Heffer's bookshop in
  Petty Cury and spend an hour or so reading what he could not afford to buy.
  Then back to college in time for dinner in Hall, where he would drink his
  pint of beer under the portraits of old collegians who had been in their time
  the kings and counsellors of England.</p>

  <p>Charles loved Cambridge with an ache because separation hovered so close
  and perhaps so tragically. Then all at once the war ended. Along with
  millions of other youths throughout the world he was reprieved&mdash;
  catapulted without warning into the idea of a future. After the initial
  thrill there was a curious feeling of anticlimax. He got drunk several times
  and took part in a riot with which the armed forces stationed in the town and
  district celebrated the end of the slaughter. The change was so abrupt that
  emptiness rather than happiness followed the withdrawal of other sensations,
  and as day after day passed by, each one so full of events abroad that even
  the palate of a historian must be jaded, Charles sought peace of his own by a
  process of wishful reasoning. England had won, and as a young Englishman he
  might well concede the timeliness of having been born in that birth-year of
  the century, so that he was old enough to have been ready, yet too young to
  have been called upon. He had been luckier than his best friend at
  Brookfield, killed in Mesopotamia, or than his brother Lindsay, stuck in a
  German prison camp awaiting repatriation. Perhaps these were reasons why he
  lacked the completely festive spirit, though he knew his own good fortune was
  to be alive. And also to be English. For with half Europe starving and
  another half in revolution, England, after the long ordeal, was still
  recognizably herself, and Cambridge was beginning to breathe again to an
  ancient rhythm of its own. The long Latin grace, which had been discontinued
  when there were so few undergraduates to read it, was resumed in Hall before
  dinner; professors brushed up their old lectures (Bury on Rome, Quiller-Couch
  on English Literature, Coulton on the Middle Ages), and for a victory banquet
  the gold plate of the Tudor founders was taken out of bank vaults and laid
  reverently along the high table. Meanwhile in some vague way the O.T.C.
  disbanded or dispersed or seemed merely to vanish, and there was nothing left
  for Charles to do with his khaki uniform except pay an exorbitant tailor's
  bill for it and have the overcoat dyed chocolate brown for civilian use. Then
  term ended and he went home to Beeching to spend that first Christmas of the
  new era that people would call post-war till the word became far too sadly
  confusing.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Beeching is gone, and there are hardly traces of it except
on old maps and
  in the memories of a later generation of combatants who will soon themselves
  be no longer young. For during the Second World War an airfield was laid out
  almost at its front door, and the house itself, for some time derelict, was
  patched up and made into an R.A.F. club. One night in 1943 a bomber taking
  off for Germany crashed into the roof and exploded; there was nothing much
  left when the fire had burned out. Because of censorship no mention of the
  disaster appeared in the papers. Charles, who was then at the Foreign Office,
  did not hear of it for several days, and then, of the house itself, he spoke
  whimsically rather than sadly, for the moment was not one for sentiment over
  bricks and mortar. 'It was a decent house, and a great many people must have
  had fun in it. They were having it, too, up to the end.' He recalled also
  that his father had always had a premonition that the place would some day be
  destroyed by fire. 'It bothered him whenever he thought about it. He had a
  sort of canvas chute made to let down from the top-floor windows and at least
  once during every school holiday when I was young we had a fire drill with
  everybody sliding down to the front lawn and getting sore bottoms.'</p>

  <p>There is a photograph in an old Gloucestershire guidebook that shows
  Beeching with a landau waiting in the drive outside, and this may well have
  been the vehicle that preceded Sir Havelock Anderson's first car, which he
  bought when Lindsay and Charles were children. In the photograph the house
  looks imposing, with its three floors grouped around and above the much
  enlarged portico&mdash;a merging of inherited elegance and Victorian solidity
  that somewhat spoilt the proportions but not at the expense of character. The
  house and surrounding glebe-lands had been with the Andersons since about
  1700. Before then the family had lived in Yorkshire and Scotland, and there
  was an Anderson who had fought under Sir Philip Sidney at Zutphen in
  1586.</p>

  <p>At the side of the house a small square breakfast-room overlooked the
  terraced gardens; it was in this room that Charles, whenever he recollected
  or dreamed about him, could most often see the father he had known as a small
  child&mdash;the tall, already silver-haired figure, not stout but plain big,
  staring out of the window with his back to the door through which Cobb
  bustled in and out with cutlery and crockery, and through which, about eight
  o'clock, Charles himself would cautiously enter&mdash;cautiously, not because
  he was in any fear, but from an unwillingness to face an ordeal of contact
  which he instinctively felt was mutual. Charles was seven years younger than
  Lindsay, so that his feeling for him was one of hero-worship rather than
  partnership; it had always seemed to him that his brother lived with his
  father in a world of grown-ups. The other meals of the day Charles took in
  the schoolroom with a governess, Miss Simmons, but breakfast was the
  immovable family feast, and for this reason marked inexorably the passage of
  early years&mdash;winter mornings when the lamps were lit and dawn paled on
  the frosted panes and Cobb would hold each page of The Times before the
  fresh-lit fire to dry out the dampness&mdash;smells of coffee and bacon and
  kedgeree along with those of warmed paper and the methylated spirit
  flickering under sideboard dishes; summer mornings when sunlight moved in
  slow slabs over the carpet and wasps buzzed in for the marmalade... chatter
  about plans for the day, in none of which he was ever included... the handful
  of mail which Cobb brought in with a wastepaper basket... Aunt Hetty's glance
  across the table as envelopes were slit one by one and their contents amiably
  destroyed or grimly noted or merely stuffed into one of the huge poacher's
  pockets that his father's tweed coats always had... his aunt's look of relief
  when a familiar crunch sounded on the gravel outside, this being the signal
  that Havelock had ordered the car and was going to be away for at least the
  morning.</p>

  <p>Charles's mother had died when he was born, and as soon as the boy was old
  enough to understand the situation he began to wonder if his father hated him
  for being alive at such a cost. There was also a story, which he heard later
  from Lindsay, that his parents had quarrelled a good deal and that for a time
  his mother had actually left Beeching and gone to live with relatives in
  London. Then she had returned, and Charles, it would seem, was the result of
  the reconciliation. If that were so, then perhaps his father had reason to
  love him as well as hate him. It was hard to figure out, or rather, it was
  easy to figure out either way, and Charles as a boy could never make up his
  mind.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">This was the same matter that came to an adult and rather
frightening
  issue during that first post-war Christmas at Beeching. When he reached there
  from Cambridge Charles found the house full of 'family'&mdash;aunts and
  uncles, with children of various ages&mdash;all assembled for what might well
  seem the occasion of a lifetime, the coming of peace on earth, though
  certainly not of good will toward all men. Aunt Hetty, who had kept house at
  Beeching since Charles was a baby, made everyone welcome, and Havelock,
  seeming to enjoy the noise and bustle of it all, strode in and out of the
  crowded rooms with something of the air of a field-marshal at ease among his
  staff. The general election took place about this time, giving Lloyd George's
  Coalition government a tremendous majority, and this momentarily cast a
  shadow, for Havelock had never forgiven Lloyd George his pre-war demagoguery.
  But a much worse blow fell on Christmas Eve. Charles happened to be crossing
  the hall when he noticed his father reading a telegram that had just arrived;
  though he could not see his face, there was a sudden slumping of the massive
  shoulders that made him hasten up in dismay. His father then turned, gave him
  a dazed stare, and handed him the telegram. It was from the War Office,
  regretting that Captain Lindsay Anderson had died of influenza in a German
  prison camp on December 10th. Only a few days later he would have begun the
  journey home. Something in the sheer wantonness of this&mdash;that a son
  should survive the battlefield and then succumb to a civilian illness in the
  defeated country weeks after the war had ended&mdash;drove Havelock to a
  frenzy in which he flung at Charles an entirely unfounded assertion that the
  Cambridge O.T.C. had been a funk-hole for shirkers and that if Charles hadn't
  been smart enough to get himself enrolled in it he too might have died.</p>

  <p>This was so unfair that Charles was stung to the retort: 'Do you wish I
  had?' But his father by that time was beyond argument and Charles, fighting
  hurt as well as grief, left him mouthing and muttering unintelligibly.
  Charles then took a long walk in the rain and did not return till after dusk,
  when he slipped into the house by the back stairs and went up to his room to
  change. Somehow or other he must face the ordeal of the family dinner, but he
  wondered how he would be able to meet his father after what had been said
  between them. During his walk over muddy farmlands he had even searched for a
  cross-grain of truth in the accusation&mdash;Was it possible that by joining
  the O.T.C. he HAD secured a few weeks' delay in the then inevitable destiny
  of being sent into battle, and that those few weeks, by the timing of
  history, had meant life for him instead of death? But even if this were so,
  it could not justify even remotely his father's attitude.</p>

  <p>While he was putting on dinner clothes the bedroom door opened and
  Havelock entered. He was still in the rough tweeds of everyday wear, but he
  looked already years older.</p>

  <p>'We aren't dressing tonight,' he said quite calmly. 'Didn't Cobb tell
  you?'</p>

  <p>'No, I've only just got back. I took a long walk.'</p>

  <p>'Well... I tried to read a little... everyone has to get over these things
  their own way. I don't really remember what it was I said to you&mdash;
  probably something foolish.'</p>

  <p>Charles answered: 'Oh, that's all right, father&mdash;it was nothing.' He
  was too deeply moved to say more. Havelock then left and Charles changed his
  clothes again. It struck him as odd that, because of his brother's death, he
  was actually taking OFF a black tie, though of course he put on another one
  of a different kind.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Charles looked forward to the end of the vacation. Not only
was the news
  about Lindsay a devastating grief, but its coming at a time of family
  gathering and sentimental association made it trebly hard to endure. And
  there was a new kind of unease between himself and his father, as if the
  sounding and exploration of a rift were all the time in progress even though
  both had agreed to bridge it. After the New Year the house rapidly emptied,
  leaving Charles alone with his father and aunt during the last week before
  term began.</p>

  <p>Sir Havelock Anderson was a remarkable man by any standards, and it was
  unfortunate (as somebody once said when this remark was made) that any
  standards had not been good enough in his chosen profession. In his thirties,
  a barrister beginning to be talked about, he would have been forecast for a
  brilliant career, with a likely outcome in Parliament or as one of the law
  officers of the Crown; in his middle forties he seemed at the point of
  achievement, having already taken silk and received a knighthood. He had many
  attributes of the successful advocate&mdash;good looks, a fine presence,
  quick wits, commanding eloquence, and an enormously persuasive manner. He
  could demolish or inveigle a witness with a technique that amounted to
  genius. The one thing he lacked was a certain responsibility of judgment at
  moments of intense pressure; as his career advanced and he gained in opinion
  of himself, he would sometimes overstep the limits of propriety, attacking
  the other side in ways that drew rebukes from judges, then turning on the
  latter with less than traditional respect. Since he seemed increasingly
  unable to handle a difficult case without this sort of thing, solicitors came
  to regard him as a doubtful asset; after one sensational court 'scene' he
  narrowly escaped disbarment. Though he apologized and all seemed forgiven, he
  had done himself harm which he knew had put him back to the bottom of the
  ladder, and it was perhaps again unfortunate that a private income enabled
  him to settle into embittered retirement rather than begin the climb afresh
  or seek a new career in some other field. Everything was unhappy and
  inglorious when, about this time, he inherited Beeching. For years thereafter
  he lacked interest in the property, his chief consolation being Lindsay, in
  whom he could well take pride. For the boy, who was very like him in looks,
  developed fast and promisingly&mdash;excellent at games as well as studies
  &mdash;destined, Havelock might have hoped, to become as remarkable as
  himself but without the flaw.</p>

  <p>When Lindsay went to school Havelock had to find things to do, even at
  Beeching, and gradually established himself as the kind of chartered
  eccentric that English society permits and tolerates&mdash;which really means
  that none of his neighbours, whether they liked him or not (and most of them
  didn't), thought it VERY odd that he should be a LITTLE odd. Though he was
  never now in the headlines, he often appeared in print&mdash;writing letters
  to The Times about his hobbies, which included bird-watching, collecting
  snuff-boxes, and visits to country churchyards, where he liked to rummage
  amongst old tombstones and discover neglected graves of minor celebrities of
  the past; he was something of an expert on lapidary inscriptions. Strong in
  physique and passionate by nature, he was also a magnet to women, but here
  again the flaw presently showed itself&mdash;a scandal involving the suicide
  of the daughter of one of his neighbours, a girl in her early twenties. This
  was when Havelock was in his fifties and a widower.</p>

  <p>One quality he had to which both friends and enemies gave the same name,
  but with differing inflections&mdash;CHARM. His friends had in mind the
  urbane host and the delightful talker, but his enemies said that this charm
  was something he could turn on and off at will, and always on when he wanted
  anything&mdash;an old courtroom trick put to non-professional use.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Before Charles left for the station to catch the London
train en route for
  Cambridge he had a talk with his father in which the charm, turned on or not,
  was as antique as the snuff-boxes. Havelock began by discussing the Anderson
  name and his own pride in it&mdash;one of those great families of commoners,
  he said, that in a sort of way constituted an English aristocracy of their
  own. In such company a mere knighthood was not so much a painting of the lily
  as a defacement. 'Who can wish to rub the eager shoulders of provincial
  mayors and successful shopkeepers? Of course if I'd stayed at the Bar I
  should have climbed much higher&mdash;but today, as things are, I'm probably
  stuck where I am, and you must reconcile yourself to having Sir Havelock
  Anderson for a father instead of plain Mister or Esquire.'</p>

  <p>All of which seemed to Charles either obtuse or a snobbery of extra-
  special vintage. He said: 'Oh, it doesn't make much difference at Cambridge.
  I don't think many of my friends even know about the title.'</p>

  <p>'You have my full authority to conceal it from them. Anyhow, your own
  affairs and what you intend to do in life are more important. Have you
  thought of a profession?'</p>

  <p>Charles hadn't, especially. So they ran through the possibilities, some of
  which were impossibilities, such as the armed services and medicine, for
  which Charles had neither desire nor aptitude. Havelock himself ruled out the
  law; he did not think Charles was suited, which was a politer way of saying
  he did not think he had the brains. Charles knew, though his father didn't
  mention it, that Lindsay was then on his mind; Lindsay was to have entered
  the law, for which a brilliant Cambridge career had already prepared him
  before he went into the army. It was as if Havelock did not want Charles's
  career to trespass, even had it been possible, on the hallowed
  might-have-been territory that Lindsay would always occupy in his mind.</p>

  <p>What about the Church? Charles shook his own head at that, and Havelock
  smiled in part concurrence. The City? Selling stocks wasn't much of a job,
  but undeniably there were youths of decent family who nowadays went into
  brokers' offices and made money there. Charles said innocently that he didn't
  think he would ever know what stocks to buy, which made Havelock smile again
  and remark that his own broker didn't seem to, either.</p>

  <p>Thus, having arrived at a fairly cordial impasse, father and son could
  only concede that the matter was in no way urgent and that the first step was
  for Charles to do well at Cambridge, taking an Honours degree. Charles said
  this would be expected of him, since he was an Exhibitioner. To which
  Havelock replied: 'Oh yes, of course. I really didn't congratulate you enough
  about that. But at the time, you see...'</p>

  <p>Charles knew what he meant; Lindsay had been alive at the time, and
  Charles's achievements and future hadn't then mattered. Now they did matter,
  but only in a pale shadow of the way Lindsay's had mattered.</p>

  <p>Havelock continued: 'Well, you've made a beginning. You must have studied
  quite hard. Somehow I never thought you did much in your spare time except
  paint little pictures. Or have you given that up?'</p>

  <p>'No, I still like to do it. A pleasant hobby that gets one into the open
  air.'</p>

  <p>'So long as you don't take it too seriously. No man should take his
  hobbies seriously till he has succeeded&mdash;or failed, for that matter
  &mdash;in his profession.' (He might well have been speaking of himself.)
  'And by the way, there's one profession we forgot. Diplomacy. Not bad if you
  have manners and like travel. Dressy fellows&mdash;useful, too, so they'd
  have us believe. They didn't prevent the last war and they won't prevent the
  next, but at least it's work that doesn't soil the hands.'</p>

  <p>Charles then responded to his father's irony with a remark that he
  recalled, long afterwards, with a certain irony of his own. 'Oh, I really
  don't think we need worry about another war in your lifetime or mine,
  Father.'</p>

  <p>'No? I wonder. There's France. There's Japan. There's Russia. There's
  America. Even Germany again if we're fools enough&mdash;and we shall be.'</p>

  <p>Evidently nothing less than the total destruction of the entire rest of
  the world would give Havelock any confidence in a lasting peace; and there
  were times in later life when Charles was almost driven to think his father
  might have had a point, though surely not an acceptable one.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Charles worked steadily at Cambridge. Except for a little
beer-drinking
  that sometimes ended up as a private spree among friends, he lived and
  studied quietly in rooms that overlooked the College Backs and the river; to
  his gyp he was 'a reading gentleman', and among the dons he earned the kind
  of modest reputation that tempted nobody to prophesy anything remarkable. In
  his father's letters the suggestion of a diplomatic career was renewed, and
  with this in mind Charles mentioned the matter to his tutors. It seemed to be
  looking rather high and far for a first-year undergraduate, but they steered
  his studies slightly in the required direction, emphasizing modern languages
  and political science. He found he had a knack for languages, and during that
  first year something happened that was specially fortunate&mdash; André
  Brunon, who had been the arts master at Brookfield, took a post at a school
  in Cambridge, so that Charles and he were able to continue their earlier
  friendship. Not only did Brunon reawaken and stimulate Charles's interest in
  painting, but by their agreement to talk always in French Charles was given
  an opportunity which he used to the full. He and Brunon would spend many an
  afternoon together in and around the town, finding old buildings or street
  scenes that offered material for sketches; sometimes they went further afield
  to Grantchester and Madingley and Ely, cycling with painting gear strapped to
  their machines. Charles had always thought he would stick to water-colours,
  but Brunon introduced him to the art of oil painting, and thus a new world
  was opened. The extra satisfaction of it all was that he need never regard
  time with Brunon as a self-indulgence, since they chattered all the while;
  and Charles knew he was acquiring not only conversational ease but the
  beginnings of an ability to THINK in French. 'And you have also an ear for
  accent,' Brunon told him. 'This is important in French as it is in English.
  Either you must speak French like an Englishman, which is bad but
  permissible, or you must speak it like the right kind of Frenchman. I myself
  am not the right kind of Frenchman, so it will be advisable for us soon,
  Charles, to stop talking French and revert to English.'</p>

  <p>Charles asked what Brunon had meant by saying he was not the right kind of
  Frenchman.</p>

  <p>'I am from the Midi. Any Parisian hearing me speak would know that.'</p>

  <p>'Does it matter?'</p>

  <p>'A little. Nothing to hinder you from passing examinations here, but
  still, the accent is not socially correct, and you will soon be copying it so
  well that you would cause raised eyebrows at the Quai d'Orsay. It would be
  like a French Ambassador arriving in London and paying his respects to your
  Foreign Minister in perfect grammatical English but with a set of Cockney
  vowel-sounds.'</p>

  <p>'Rather amusing to think of.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, but you would wonder where on earth he could have picked them up
  &mdash;and then in your mind there would just be the faintest beginnings of
  doubt about him. Whereas if he spoke with a slight Scottish burr or a slight
  Irish lilt, all you would think would be, how charming, he must have had a
  Scottish or an Irish governess as a child... There is no logic about these
  matters, but it IS rather odd that the native accent of your capital city is
  so out of favour... Personally, I LIKE Cockney, it has a real music of its
  own, but then I also like a made-up bow tie, which saves me trouble, though I
  was once told that no English gentleman would ever wear one.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, really? I didn't know that.'</p>

  <p>'Do you wear one yourself?'</p>

  <p>'No, I tie my own, but it certainly never occurred to me that...' Charles
  laughed and added: 'Oh, well, André, you listen for danger and give me the
  signal when we'd better start talking English again.'</p>

  <p>In the summer of 1920 Charles took Part One of the History Tripos, getting
  a Second in it. He had hoped for a First, but his tutor congratulated him so
  warmly that the inference might have been drawn that only brilliant people
  got Firsts. Charles, however, still hoped to do better in Part Two, which he
  would take a year later. It was a more specialized examination that included
  the submission of a thesis, and he had already thought of a subject&mdash;
  'The Influence of the Arabian Caliphate on the Seljuk Turks during the reign
  of Toghrul Beg'. Why he chose this he was never quite sure, apart from his
  general interest in the period. Perhaps a deciding factor was that, so far as
  he could discover, nobody had ever written a Tripos thesis about the Seljuk
  Turks before. To his tutor, who approved the idea, there also occurred the
  comforting thought that a researcher on such a subject would soon reach a
  point at which he knew more than the examiners.</p>

  <p>Those years at Cambridge immediately after the Armistice were unique,
  though doubtless if one had said so some don would have brought up conditions
  after the Napoleonic Wars or the Great Rebellion or the Dissolution of the
  Monasteries. There was always this flavour in the Cambridge spirit&mdash;a
  willingness to accept the new because it was not really new at all, or at
  least not as new as an outsider might think. Perhaps it was easier, in this
  spirit, to welcome the older generation of undergraduates who crowded the
  colleges in 1919&mdash;married men and fathers, strange men, maimed men, and
  mystery men whose normal lives would not have included Cambridge at all, but
  whom the war had used and spared and had finally enriched with this
  unlooked-for experience. Many were from the Dominions&mdash;rangy
  six-footers, to whom even the mildest collegiate discipline was irksome, and
  who were apt to find snobbery rather than enchantment in all tradition. And
  along with them, of course, was the usual crop of youngsters fresh from the
  schools, the handful of Harvard-exchanged Americans, and that winnowing of
  dark-skinned empire-built plutocracy which university regulations so
  tactfully referred to as 'natives of Asia or Africa not of European
  parentage'. The mixture was never quite as before, and sometimes did not mix,
  nor did the spell always work; but Cambridge, where the spell was everything
  unless Cambridge was nothing, could only do its best.</p>

  <p>(Those were the days when Kolchak marshalled cavalry against the masters
  of the Kremlin; those were also the days when, hardly more than a stone's
  throw from Charles's college, Rutherford was plotting the split of the atom.
  But nobody threw that stone.)</p>

  <p>Charles spent all his vacations (except part of one) at Beeching. The
  exception was a week in Normandy with Brunon during the August of 1920. They
  landed at Dieppe and hired an old Citroën; then they drove to Yvetot and
  Jumièges, loitering and painting wherever they saw what they wanted. The
  whole week was full of wonderful weather, warm and sunny but not cloudless,
  ideal for obtaining a variety of light and colour. Charles had never in his
  life been so happy, not only because he liked Brunon but because for the
  first time he was beginning to sense a relationship with paint which could be
  called control, though it was far from anything that could be called mastery.
  'It is just possible,' said Brunon, 'that you might be fairly good some day.
  Probably not VERY good, but at any rate better than I am. But of course I am
  not really good at all. After all, I just amuse myself.'</p>

  <p>Charles returned to Beeching bronzed from the sun, and with a new
  confidence in himself that expanded far outside the realms of art into the
  traffic of everyday life. Havelock was quick to recognize it and asked many
  questions about Brunon. 'He sounds a decent sort of fellow,' he remarked. 'To
  admit that he's not a good painter and that he has a bad French accent
  &mdash;a rather surprising modesty in one who has so much influence over
  you.'</p>

  <p>'It isn't exactly an influence,' Charles said. 'We just like each other
  and have similar interests.'</p>

  <p>'And no doubt similar opinions.'</p>

  <p>'On some things, yes. We exchange opinions a great deal because it helps
  my French.'</p>

  <p>'Naturally.' Havelock mused a moment. 'Which reminds me... Charnock will
  be here next week. I told him the portrait of your mother seems to be fading
  a little&mdash;he wants to see it and tell me what to do. Perhaps you'll be
  equally interested in HIS opinions.'</p>

  <p>'Why, of course. I'll enjoy meeting him.'</p>

  <p>Charnock had been one of the fashionable portraitists of an earlier day;
  he had painted Charles's mother soon after her marriage, and the full-length
  canvas hung over the hall mantelpiece at Beeching in deserved pride of place,
  for there was no other picture in the house of any value. It showed her
  standing on the terrace holding in leash the two Airedales who were ancestors
  of the animals they now had (there was an Airedale tradition at Beeching).
  Charles had often admired the portrait, not only with his eyes but with his
  fingers touching the brush-work. Charnock was old now, in his seventies, and
  nobody took much notice of what he still regularly sent to the Academy, but
  he was sometimes asked for his views of younger exhibitors, and these were
  often pungent enough to make good copy in the newspapers. His own style was
  somewhat after Millais and the pre-Raphaelites, paying much attention to
  dress. Nobody could, or would, paint a fold of velvet to look more like a
  fold of velvet.</p>

  <p>Charles had no intention whatever of showing Charnock his work, any more
  than an amateur pianist meeting Schnabel at dinner would ask him to sit by
  the piano afterwards to hear a Beethoven sonata. Besides which, Charles
  rarely painted at Beeching, feeling the place curiously out of bounds for
  doing so with any pleasure. Many of his canvases, including several he liked,
  were stored in his rooms at Cambridge; others were in a studio in St. John's
  Wood that Brunon rented during school vacations. Brunon had promised to find
  frames for some of the recent Normandy paintings and had kept them for this
  purpose. Not only therefore was Charles surprised when Charnock after dinner
  asked to see some of his work, but there wasn't much to show him. He went to
  his room, nevertheless, and found a few samples&mdash;water-colours of
  Cambridge scenes, a head of an old man dozing in a café at Lillebonne
  &mdash;sketched and then painted from part-memory; a still life improvised on
  a wet day in his college rooms; a landscape in oils of the fens near
  Waterbeach. He showed these to Charnock with embarrassment, partly because he
  hated to impose on a guest, but also because it was the first time his father
  could have seen most if not all of them.</p>

  <p>Charnock kept silence for a long interval when the display was over and
  while Charles thankfully stacked the pictures against the wall. Presently the
  old man cleared his throat and commented: 'Well, my boy, you certainly must
  have had a lot of fun.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' agreed Charles. 'I wouldn't have done them if I hadn't.'</p>

  <p>Havelock smiled a slow smile. 'I'm afraid the great painters had more
  serious motives... wouldn't you say so, Charnock?'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, but fun's all right too.' Charnock grinned. 'I never found it did
  any harm to a painting to enjoy painting it... But I suppose what you really
  want me to tell you, my boy, is whether you ought to take it up for a
  living.'</p>

  <p>Charles hadn't wanted this at all; he had no intention of trying to become
  a professional painter, and if this were the assumption he felt himself to be
  falsely a suppliant for Charnock's opinion. Evidently his father had caused
  the misunderstanding and there was no way now of clearing it up without being
  rude to a man whose work Charles admired and respected. So he just smiled
  back and said nothing.</p>

  <p>'And you want me to be frank?' Charnock continued.</p>

  <p>'Well, yes, of course, sir.'</p>

  <p>Charnock nodded and shrugged. He slowly lit the cigar that Havelock
  offered; it was as if Havelock were gently prompting him to exploit the
  fullest possible drama of the occasion. Then Charnock began, puffing between
  the words: 'In that case, my boy, the answer is fortunately simple. You have
  nothing but a talent. A nice talent, and one that may continue to give
  yourself and others pleasure, but beyond that...' He shrugged again.</p>

  <p>Havelock turned to Charles. 'I hope it isn't a big disappointment,
  Charles, but I think you'll agree it's far better to have it now than nourish
  an impossible hope.'</p>

  <p>'I never had such a hope, so there isn't any disappointment,' Charles
  answered.</p>

  <p>Which was true, and yet in a way not entirely true. For there was always
  the hope that one admitted to be preposterous&mdash;like wondering what one
  would do with the money if one's sweepstake ticket won the first prize.
  Charles, had he ever been asked, would have told anybody (and sincerely) that
  he doubted if he had more than talent; but he did not enjoy being assured of
  it by a man whose opinion he valued but hadn't sought, and in front of his
  father, who (he was now convinced) had planned the whole thing as some kind
  of personal humiliation. Later he began to wonder if it might be simply
  revenge for the week he had spent away from Beeching with Brunon.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">One day in the spring of 1921 Charles left Cambridge by an
early train to
  spend the day in London. His researches into the Seljuk Turks had reached a
  point where Cambridge libraries had nothing more to offer, but there were
  several sources at the British Museum that he thought might yield something.
  The morning was wet and he was glad to exchange the chill of London streets
  for the leathery warmth of the great Reading Room under the dome. After he
  had searched the catalogue and filled in slips he found a desk and read the
  paper while he waited; there was nothing much in the news&mdash;riots in
  Vienna, famine in Russia, Anglo-French squabbling about German reparations, a
  murder at Golders Green&mdash;just an average cross-section of daily mishap.
  It was really more satisfying to stare about and observe the familiar
  types&mdash;students planning success in examinations, as he was; droll
  characters probing crannies of knowledge for the strangest morsels;
  tired-looking gleaners who Charles imagined might be freelance journalists
  gathering material for the kind of article they would never sell. Once the
  Museum official who brought his books had leaned over to whisper: 'Know who
  used to sit at your desk, young man? KARL MARX... And you know where Lenin
  first met Trotsky?... In the street&mdash;in the middle of the night
  &mdash;just round the corner from here.'</p>

  <p>Charles had been interested, though Marx, Lenin and Trotsky were no
  particular heroes of his. But he was young enough to find a thrill in feeling
  so close to the kind of history that seemed alive in newspapers rather than
  dead in books.</p>

  <p>The books arrived, and Charles busily made notes till one o'clock, when he
  stacked his material where he could return to it later and strolled along the
  corridor to the Museum restaurant. It looked full, so he reclaimed his hat
  and coat and scampered down the long Grecian flight into the open air. He was
  in a mood for scampering. The rain had stopped and a watery sun was pushing
  aside the edges of cloud and trying to dry the streets. He felt happy.</p>

  <p>He could have painted those clouds. He had done a good morning's work, and
  he would do more during the afternoon and then catch the 7.15 back to
  Cambridge, eating dinner on the train. That would give him plenty of time to
  be in college before midnight; and the next day he could sort out his notes
  and fit them into the thesis where they best belonged. It seemed a shadowless
  programme as he entered the stream of hurrying Londoners outside the Museum.
  There was a Lyons teashop nearby, but this too was crowded and the only
  vacant chair he could see was at a table already in use. It was better than
  waiting, though, and as he only wanted a sandwich and a cup of coffee he
  threaded his way across the room. Suddenly he saw that the other occupant was
  a girl; or rather, the girl whom he saw to be the other occupant gave him a
  sudden emotion. There was no special reason for it; she was not prettier than
  average, and in her rather shabby mackintosh and with wisps of rain-wet hair
  a little disarranged over her forehead she must be aware, if she were giving
  it a thought, of not looking her best. Clearly she was not giving it a
  thought. She was reading a book and seemed engrossed; when Charles sat down
  she did not look up, and this gave him a chance to observe her more
  carefully. All the time the emotion he had had on first seeing her persisted,
  and meanwhile something else happened that he would not have noticed except
  at a moment of heightened intensity&mdash;the sun broke the edge of another
  cloud and a single ray pierced the interior of the teashop. He saw the scene
  then as he would always remember it&mdash;the slopped tables and muddied
  floor, the clothes-rack hung with coats and dripping umbrellas, the sign
  pasted on a mirror that read 'Baked Beans on Toast Now Reduced to Fivepence'.
  He also saw that the book she was reading was a novel by Compton Mackenzie
  called Guy and Pauline. She was rather pale, and though her eyes were on the
  book he guessed they were large; the small finger that turned the pages had a
  dark stain on the tip. He felt like a detective when he decided that this was
  not merely from ink but from typewriter-ribbon ink.</p>

  <p>He gave his order to the waitress and continued the diagnosis till the
  sandwich and cup of coffee arrived. Then he ate and drank slowly, and
  throughout all this time she had not once looked up. The book, he thought,
  must be surpassingly readable. But he was glad, in a way, because it enabled
  him to continue his detective role. She had had a cup of tea, he noted, and a
  bath bun. That was not much of a midday meal for an office girl&mdash;
  perhaps it was all she could afford. But then he imagined the same deduction
  being made about himself, from similar evidence on the table; and he wished
  it were she who would look up and be interested enough to make the mistake.
  She didn't. Presently, though, she glanced at the clock on the wall behind,
  put a marker at the page she had reached, grabbed her bill, and hurried to
  the cash desk.</p>

  <p>Charles stayed for a few minutes, then picked up his own bill and left.
  'Just like April,' said the cashier as she gave him change. He was puzzled
  for a moment till he saw that the sun had gone in and another shower was
  beginning. He had to walk through it back to the Museum.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">All afternoon, and during the train journey to Cambridge,
and on and off
  during the days of work that followed, Charles found himself thinking of the
  girl in the Lyons teashop. Indeed, he had never thought so persistently of
  any girl before. Amorous adventure had so far in his life been of a kind to
  make him think its pleasures exaggerated, or at least over-compensated for by
  regrets and confusions; and the girls he met fairly often were mostly the
  daughters of Beeching neighbours, horsy or hockey-playing. They thought him
  shy, which he was, and dull, which he was not; he had sometimes hoped that
  one of them might discover this. As for the Newnham and Girton girls who
  attended the university lectures, he hardly knew any of them except by sight,
  and the sight was rarely blood-tingling. Perhaps, he feared, he was
  impossibly hard to please, since he did not seem to care for either the
  bluestocking or the sportswoman type.</p>

  <p>One thing he did with a promptness that startled him; he bought Guy and
  Pauline at Heffer's and read it at a sitting. It was charmingly written, but
  he thought Guy was a bit of a prig, and an Oxford prig at that&mdash;which
  put him at odds with the entire idyll. His surviving interest, when he came
  to the last page, was with the girl in the teashop&mdash;why had she found
  the story so absorbing? Of course it was quite possible she hadn't. Maybe she
  merely preferred a novel&mdash;any novel&mdash;to reading a newspaper or
  chatting with the girls she worked with all day. And maybe she always read
  like that&mdash;with an air of having surrendered totally to a spell.</p>

  <p>The following week term ended for the Easter vacation and Charles decided
  to put in another hour or so at the Museum on his way home. He planned to
  catch an afternoon train from Paddington to Stow Magna, which was the station
  for Beeching; but while he was making his notes, with one eye on the clock,
  it occurred to him that he needn't hurry unless he wanted to, since there
  were later trains and it was of small consequence when he arrived. Relaxing,
  he then forgot the time till he began to feel hungry. Of course he had known
  all along he would revisit the Lyons teashop.</p>

  <p>He found a table near the one he had had before, but he could not see the
  girl anywhere, and while he watched the entrance the whole thing seemed to
  become both fantastic and of increasing importance. How absurd, he reflected;
  but WHAT was absurd? Was it not his own folly, if it mattered to him so much,
  in not speaking to her when he had had the chance? The thought made him
  decide not to repeat the absurdity if ever he were granted a second chance.
  An hour passed. The appetite he had felt at the Museum had deserted him; he
  could hardly finish his coffee and sandwich. He told himself he would leave
  at a quarter past two and that would be the end of it. Quarter past two came,
  and he still stayed. She walked in five minutes later.</p>

  <p>The shop was half empty by then, and of course she went to another table,
  but not far away. She had a book which she began to read as before. The
  waitress knew her and they exchanged a friendly greeting. Her smile was
  somehow what he had expected, except for a little gap between one upper tooth
  and the next one, at the left side; this was pure caprice, unimaginable
  beforehand in any mind's eye. When the waitress had gone he left his table
  and went over to hers with a deliberation he knew would be hard to explain
  when she looked up, as she must; and almost in panic he realized he had no
  explanation at all except the truth which could not be spoken. For the truth
  was simply that he loved her, if ever the word had, or had had, or would
  have, any complete meaning for him. She looked up. He blushed, pulled a
  chair, and said with stammering inspiration: 'I wondered if you were still
  reading Guy and Pauline... Why, yes, so you are.'</p>

  <p>She stared for a few seconds, then glanced round as if to verify, without
  displeasure, all the vacant tables. 'Are you Ethel's friend?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Ethel?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, then...' She looked apologetic, as if it were she and not he who had
  precipitated the encounter. 'You see, Ethel's friend lent it to her, and then
  she lent it to me&mdash;Ethel's MY friend&mdash;and I liked it so much she
  told him. He said he'd like to meet me and talk about it, so she said I was
  always here for lunch&mdash;well, nearly always. That's why I thought
  &mdash;but of course&mdash;if you're not...'</p>

  <p>He said: 'No, no. I just happened to be here the other day and noticed
  what you were reading. You didn't see me. I was interested because&mdash;
  well...' He struck out for a reason like a swimmer for the shore. 'Well, I'd
  read the book myself and was interested.'</p>

  <p>Her eyes widened and he had been right about them too&mdash;they were
  large. They were also a deep violet in colour.</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, it's a lovely story, isn't it? Even my dad liked it. He said it
  was so good about gardens.'</p>

  <p>Charles did not know what to say to this, but it was time to come to terms
  with her voice, which was not quite what he had expected. Or rather, perhaps,
  he had simply not used his brains about what to expect&mdash;for he had
  already deduced her as an office girl with not too good a job. If one didn't
  know English, he reflected whimsically, one would have found her voice as
  delightful as her eyes&mdash;soft and warm and altogether pleasing; but since
  one did know the language, one had to admit that her voice was also rather
  Cockney, and Charles wished it wasn't, a few seconds before he asked himself
  why it mattered. For he had been brought up with that crucial consciousness
  of accent which is so much in the air of English public schools that a boy
  with the wrong kind would feel outcast till, by conscious mimicry or slow
  absorption, he could conform to pattern. And the pattern, of course, was the
  clipped unregional utterance associated by name with Oxford rather than
  Cambridge, an utterance based on upper-class standardizations achieved over a
  period long enough to acquire tradition.</p>

  <p>She went on, smiling now with complete friendliness: 'I've nearly finished
  it. Don't tell me how it ends.'</p>

  <p>'It's a sad ending.'</p>

  <p>'I don't mind sad endings if they're real. I mean, I don't like a happy
  ending to be dragged in.'</p>

  <p>'Mackenzie wouldn't do that&mdash;he's too good a writer. But I don't
  think Guy and Pauline is his best book. You ought to read Carnival.'</p>

  <p>'Carnival? I'll remember that... Are YOU a writer?'</p>

  <p>'Oh no.' But then he recollected what he was in London for. 'Not of
  novels, but at present I'm working on a thesis.' It was clear she didn't know
  what a thesis was, and he didn't hold it against her. 'Something I have to do
  at Cambridge.'</p>

  <p>Her eyes widened again. 'Cambridge? You're at Cambridge College?'</p>

  <p>The question hadn't been put to him before in that form, and because he
  didn't want to make her seem ignorant or himself pedantic, he answered: 'I'm
  a student at the University, but I come to London sometimes to look up things
  at the British Museum... Now it's your turn. Tell me what you do.'</p>

  <p>There was no check on the conversation from then on. She said she was a
  typist at a firm of importers with offices in Kingsway. She had a boss named
  Mr. Graybar. She was eighteen. She lived with her parents at Linstead, and
  Linstead, she explained, was near Chilford. (Charles had heard of both, but
  could only place them vaguely as northern London suburbs.) Her father was a
  superintendent of local parks. (She spoke the word 'superintendent' with
  pride.) She had two sisters and a brother. Another brother had been killed in
  the war.</p>

  <p>That led him to tell her, with no reticence at all, about Lindsay. 'He was
  seven years older than I. He was going to have a wonderful career&mdash;
  everybody was sure of that&mdash;he'd already taken a brilliant degree. He
  was good at everything&mdash;games as well. He could ride beautifully
  &mdash;some of those big fellows that I was always scared of&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Where do you live?' she interrupted.</p>

  <p>'In the country. Cheltenham's the nearest town.'</p>

  <p>'What's your dad?' she then asked.</p>

  <p>The question closed and barred the door that Lindsay had opened wide, for
  the thought of his father made Charles suddenly cautious. To discuss his
  family and Beeching might set a distance between them, and he could not take
  such a risk at this early stage of their relationship (for he knew already
  there must be later stages). He said guardedly: 'You mean his job? He doesn't
  actually have one, except...' And then he floundered because the words seemed
  ill-chosen&mdash;would she think he was telling her that his father was out
  of work? He went on, trying to correct the wrong impression, if any, without
  conveying the right one: 'We have a bit of land and he looks after it most of
  the time.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I think it's wonderful he sent you to college. My dad let Bert stay
  on at the grammar school till he was sixteen.'</p>

  <p>So she HAD misunderstood? Charles couldn't be sure. Anyhow, it was as if
  she were pridefully seeking to match either her own father's financial
  sacrifices or his devotion to learning with anyone else's in the world, and
  this drew his hand across the table to hers in a warmth that made their first
  physical contact something to remember like all the other first things. He
  saw the colour spring to her cheeks, and she glanced at the clock while his
  hand was still on hers. 'Oh dear, I must run&mdash;Mr. Graybar will make such
  a fuss. It's our busy day with the Japanese mail going out.'</p>

  <p>'Japanese mail?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, we do a lot of business with Japan. AND China.'</p>

  <p>'Are your hours long?'</p>

  <p>'Nine till six.'</p>

  <p>'Hard work?'</p>

  <p>'Not so bad. It comes in rushes. That's why I'm so late today. I have to
  go, really. It's been awfully nice talking to you.'</p>

  <p>'You say you always come here to lunch?'</p>

  <p>'Well, sometimes I go to the A.B.C. in Holborn. But mostly here. It's
  nearer.' She picked up the bill.</p>

  <p>'No, no, let ME...'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I couldn't... no, really...'</p>

  <p>The bill was only a few pence, and he thought it too unimportant to argue
  about, the more so as he didn't know whether she had protested conventionally
  or because he had said his father had no job. So he said, testing the matter
  from another angle: 'All right, THIS time&mdash;but I must see you again.
  Will you have lunch with me next week&mdash;one day?'</p>

  <p>'I'll be here, yes. Every day.'</p>

  <p>He followed her to the cash desk, paying his own bill. He still stayed
  with her when they reached the street. A clock outside was either five
  minutes fast or else the one in the teashop had been slow. She noticed it
  with alarm. 'Oh, look, I'm terribly late.'</p>

  <p>So they scampered together, half running and half walking, along a zigzag
  of side streets to Kingsway, making plans meanwhile. When they reached the
  office doorway another clock, confirming the one in the teashop, seemed to
  give them a moment miraculously their own. He said: 'You won't be late
  &mdash;not now&mdash;and why don't I meet you HERE next week, instead of at
  the Lyons? We don't really have to go there at all, do we?'</p>

  <p>'All right.'</p>

  <p>'Here, then, next Wednesday, at one?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.' She gave him a bright breathless smile. 'And I'll try not to be
  late, Charlie, but if I am, you'll know it's Mr. Graybar.'</p>

  <p>She ran inside and he stood on the pavement, watching the swinging doors
  till they were still. She had called him Charlie, so promptly and easily, and
  no one else ever had&mdash;neither family nor friends. At Brookfield most
  boys used last names, except intimates, and those had called him 'Andy'
  &mdash;a nickname that had then been transplanted to his circle of Cambridge
  friends because one of them had also known him at Brookfield.</p>

  <p>She had told him her name was Lily&mdash;Lily Mansfield, but he had not
  used it yet, aloud.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">On the train from Paddington he could hardly find
perspective in a world
  so changed. He ate the Great Western dinner, his appetite now briskly
  restored, and staring through the window was almost glad there was a full
  week before he would see her again&mdash;a full week to taste the new
  dimension of events. Towards the latter part of the journey night fell, and
  then he got out his notes and found to his relief that he could concentrate
  magnificently. She cosily made room for the Seljuk Turks in his mind.</p>

  <p>At Stow Magna he took a taxi to Beeching. As the cab swung past the lodge
  gates into the half-mile of carriage drive he saw a tall figure pacing in
  circles on the front lawn at a rate that, with its lack of purpose, suggested
  frenzy rather than exercise. Charles knew it must be his father in one of his
  'moods', though what kind of mood was not yet apparent. Maybe deep
  depression, or maybe a high excursion on the crest of a mind-wave; 'plunging'
  and 'vaulting' were the adjectives which, for want of anything more
  scientific, Charles gave to the two extremes. The difference between them and
  the quickened intervals of their recurrence had already become as obvious as
  the fact that Havelock's eccentricities were increasing as he grew older and
  as the years denied him more than they offered. It was as if the slowing
  tempo of a powerful physicality had liberated him for forays while it barred
  the grand offensives of earlier days.</p>

  <p>Havelock stopped his pacing when he saw Charles arrive. The first words of
  greeting as they entered the house together revealed that the mood was
  'vaulting' this time, which was certainly, of the two, more cheerful to live
  with. But not always more tranquil. During what was left of the evening
  Charles discovered the nature of the latest foray. Havelock, it seemed, had
  just contributed to The Times a letter that was not about birds or
  tombstones, but ventured into new territory&mdash;political. Beginning with a
  reference to 'my son, who is at Cambridge', it had gone on to mention an
  honorary degree recently conferred there on a leading politician (named) and
  the list of this man's virtues, as enumerated in the usual Latin speech
  delivered on such occasions in the Senate House. Havelock's contention was
  that the Latin had not been well translated, and after quoting it he supplied
  his own 'better' version as follows: 'Sagacity, Willpower, Integrity,
  Nobility, Experience'. All of which could have been called a piece of
  harmless pedantry till Havelock had gleefully pointed out (to friends,
  neighbours, and fellow members of his London club) that the initials of the
  enumerated qualities spelt the word 'swine', and that The Times editor had
  thus been magnificently duped. Havelock now expounded this crème de la crème
  of the jest to Charles in the real or assumed expectation that he would
  derive equal enjoyment.</p>

  <p>Of course Charles thought the whole thing preposterous and a disturbing
  symptom of his father's heightened irresponsibility. He could not decide on
  the motive; whether Havelock by the completely unnecessary reference to 'my
  son' had sought deliberately to involve him in unpleasantness; or whether he
  had merely surrendered to some euphoria in which his mind (not for the first
  time) operated without judgment. Charles told him frankly that if the story
  got around it couldn't exactly help a budding diplomatic or any other kind of
  career. 'The fellow you called a swine may be the one I'll be having to ask
  for a job one of these days.'</p>

  <p>Suddenly deflated, Havelock then claimed that this had never occurred to
  him, and that in any case the risk of real harm was trivial. Perhaps it was,
  Charles admitted; only time would show. When later the whole incident seemed
  without result of any kind, Charles could only conclude that the letter had
  attracted absolutely no attention, and that people to whom his father had
  talked had merely disregarded him as a crank. Full relief came later still,
  when The Times proved its unawareness by printing Havelock's next letter,
  which was innocuously concerned with the migratory behaviour of the green
  sandpiper.</p>

  <p>But for the time, during that first week of the Easter vacation, it was
  only behind a curtain of exasperation that Charles could savour his own
  private happiness&mdash;the thought of the Wednesday ahead, the Wednesday he
  had chosen as just a random day for meeting Lily again, but which already he
  wished had been Monday or Tuesday.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">As soon as he saw her pushing through the swing-doors of
the Kingsway
  office he knew she had dressed up, and though she would have looked just as
  well to him in what she had worn at their first meeting, he was touched.
  Naturally, as a man, but still more as a man of his class, he had not thought
  to do anything similar. There were certain things one wore in the country and
  slightly different fashions at Oxford or Cambridge, and a third set of rules
  for London&mdash;none of them more difficult than the task of choosing a good
  tailor and paying his bills. Charles had indeed been in a state of high
  excitement as he dressed at Beeching that morning, but so far as clothes were
  concerned, he was just going up to town for the day, and anyone who saw him
  waiting on the platform at Stow Magna would have known exactly that.</p>

  <p>They shook hands and for a moment were both of them nervous and almost
  speechless till he raised his arm to halt a passing taxi. 'We'll decide where
  we'll go while we're going,' he said gaily. And then to the driver:
  'Trafalgar Square, to begin with.'</p>

  <p>But he found she had very few ideas about lunch. It seemed that on certain
  gala occasions she had been to the Strand Palace and the Regent Palace, which
  she had thought very splendid; but they were not his style, and since he
  could not afford Claridge's or the Ritz, he wondered if she would be
  disappointed with the kind of restaurant that suited both his tastes and his
  pocket pretty well. There was one he and Brunon had discovered, called Le
  Beau Soleil, in Soho&mdash;a small foreign place with no marble and gilt
  about it, just a few tables in a plain room, rather grubby menus, and a good
  cuisine for the price. So he said, taking her arm in the taxi: 'Let's go
  somewhere I once went to&mdash;nothing much, but at least it's quiet and we
  can talk.' It wasn't even quiet; what he meant was that there was no
  six-piece orchestra booming out popular tunes to drown conversation or to
  fill the gap of silence between people who had nothing to say.</p>

  <p>It troubled him to think that Le Beau Soleil might disappoint her; but
  soon he realized how willing she was, at all times beginning with that first
  one, to go where he took her and to be actively, not merely passively, happy
  about it. There was a sense, indeed, in which everything that ever happened
  to her was a gala occasion, needing no particular background to make her
  enjoy it to the full.</p>

  <p>They had the plat du jour and she refused wine but drank several cups of
  coffee. The room was downstairs from the street level, in a sort of
  semi-basement whose windows looked up beyond a railed area to the pavement.
  One saw the legs of people passing continuously, but no more of them than
  that without craning one's neck. Sometimes a pair of legs would stop&mdash;
  perhaps to rest, or during the lighting of a cigarette, or for no special
  reason at all&mdash;and then proceed again. Sometimes a pair of legs would
  stop close to another pair of legs&mdash;a meeting. It was amusing to guess,
  and then to lean sideways to verify. Once a man stooped and stared,
  presumably to see if the restaurant was full; it was the only outside face
  they saw, and behind the railings it looked like that of some strange
  crouching animal in a cage. 'But HE sees US through the bars,' she said.
  'Maybe to him it looks as if WE'RE in the cage.'</p>

  <p>'I've often had the same thought at the Zoo... You like the Zoo?'</p>

  <p>'I've never been,' she answered.</p>

  <p>That seemed to him quite amazing. 'You've never been to the Zoo?'</p>

  <p>'I've never been anywhere much&mdash;except round about where I live.'</p>

  <p>He found, by closer questioning, that this was true&mdash;she had visited
  hardly any of London's famous sights; all she really knew of the city was the
  daily route by bus or tube from the station to the office, plus a few jaunts
  to cinemas and theatres. She had never been to the British Museum, though it
  was only a short stroll from where she usually had lunch. But she had been to
  Madame Tussaud's, and Charles hadn't. 'Reg took me. He wanted to see the
  Chamber of Horrors.' She didn't explain who Reg was, and Charles didn't ask;
  but the mere existence of a Reg stirred in him a desire to be the first to
  take her to all the places that Reg had so far neglected.</p>

  <p>He got an impression that she had lived a very sheltered life at home
  &mdash;and of course there had been the war years during which sightseeing
  wasn't easy or always possible. She said she had reached the top class at
  Linstead High School for Girls, and had gone straight to an office job on
  leaving. 'We learned French at school,' she said proudly, 'but I don't
  remember much now.' This came out when the proprietor greeted them at their
  table and Charles addressed him in fluent French, resulting in the discovery
  that Le Beau Soleil was owned and managed by a Greek, and Charles did not
  know any modern Greek. He realized then from his dismay how much he had been
  wanting to show off in that particular fashion.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, over a third cup of coffee, she noticed the clock. 'Oh, my
  goodness&mdash;a quarter to three. I'll have to run. Mr. Graybar...'</p>

  <p>'May I say damn Mr. Graybar?'</p>

  <p>She giggled. 'I've said that many a time... It's all right, though&mdash;
  we're not so busy today and I'll work late tonight to make up for it... But
  whatever could we have been talking about all this time?'</p>

  <p>And that was a question hard to answer. For they had talked unceasingly,
  yet not about anything important. Just their own everyday affairs, which
  interested each other the more they were revealed, though Charles was still
  reluctant to be as frank as she was. It was strange; he did not mind
  impressing her with news of Cambridge, and the work he was doing, and his
  fluent French, but he did not want her to know much about Beeching. Yet
  perhaps he had been less reticent than he supposed, or else she had intuition
  about it, for in the taxi on the way back to Kingsway she said: 'Your family
  are rather well off, aren't they?'</p>

  <p>'Oh no, not really. You can be poor nowadays if you own land. My father
  often has trouble paying his bills.'</p>

  <p>'Do you own a lot of land?'</p>

  <p>'Just farmland. All of it wouldn't be worth as much as a few square feet
  round here.' That was an exaggeration, but he wanted to minimize certain
  differences between them. Other differences he didn't mind&mdash;some even
  amused him. Her na veté, for instance, and her lack of the
  pseudo-sophistication that most girls had&mdash;a lack which he knew had
  nothing to do with primness or being straitlaced. He noticed this when she
  declined a cigarette. 'You don't smoke or drink, Lily?'</p>

  <p>'Well, I've tried them both, but dad doesn't like me to, till I'm older.
  And it costs money.'</p>

  <p>'How much do you earn&mdash;if it isn't something I oughtn't to ask?'</p>

  <p>'Why not?... Two pounds fifteen a week.' Charles was shocked; he had no
  idea that wages in offices were so low. But she seemed to think she was well
  paid. 'I'll say that for Mr. Graybar, he's not mean if you can do your job.
  He gave me the extra five shillings last New Year without even being asked.
  Of course I live at home, that makes it easy. I give my mum thirty shillings
  &mdash;she won't take any more. She's awfully good to me.'</p>

  <p>He was beginning to realize already that Lily found most people 'awfully
  good' and therefore easy to excuse, forgive, appreciate, and love. And if
  love were too strong a word, surely any other would not have been strong
  enough for the emotion that radiated from her in all human directions. She
  loved her mother and father, her sisters and brother, the girls she worked
  with at the office; she even loved, in a sort of way, the redoubtable Mr.
  Graybar. And she had a bright cloudless mind that threaded the love into the
  pattern of all her behaviour. He could tell that from an incident when the
  cab waited in a traffic block at the corner of Aldwych. A queue was lined up
  for the gallery of a theatre and the usual buskers were doing their turns at
  the kerbside. One of them, singing in a cracked voice almost inaudible above
  street noises, turned to the cab and thrust his cap through the open window.
  The manner of the appeal was impertinent and the driver gestured him off, as
  Charles would have also had he not seen Lily fishing in her handbag.</p>

  <p>'No, no, let ME...' He managed to find a shilling in his pocket and
  dropped it in the man's cap.</p>

  <p>'You shouldn't have done that,' she said, when the cab moved away.</p>

  <p>'Why not? YOU were going to.'</p>

  <p>'But a SHILLING!' she protested. 'They don't expect that much. Goodness,
  nobody could afford to, if it had to be a shilling.'</p>

  <p>'So you always give to them?'</p>

  <p>'If I'm passing I sometimes do. Some of them are really good singers, and
  if they aren't you feel sorry for them... Only a few coppers, of course.'</p>

  <p>'I'll bet that fellow didn't need money as much as you do. I'll bet he
  makes more in a day than you earn in a week.'</p>

  <p>'But if people always thought like that they'd never give anything to
  anybody.' The cab was making the turn into Kingsway. 'Oh, Charlie, I've had
  such a wonderful time. I can't remember when I've talked so much. Next time
  I'll try not to.'</p>

  <p>He took her hand in an uprush of exultation that gave his voice a tremor.
  'Well, when shall it be&mdash;NEXT TIME? TONIGHT? What time do you leave the
  office?'</p>

  <p>'Oh no, I'll be working late, and besides, they'll expect me at home.'</p>

  <p>'You could telephone.'</p>

  <p>'We haven't got a telephone at home&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'How can you work late then, if they expect you&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Just an hour or so late doesn't matter&mdash;they're used to that. But if
  I went out for the evening&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'That's what we'll do, the next time. The whole evening. The next time I
  come to the Museum. That'll be soon.' (But how soon? Not before the term
  began again? Could he endure such a delay?) 'What about the week after next?
  Wednesday again? We'll have dinner.'</p>

  <p>They fixed a time and a place. There wasn't a whiff of coquetry in the way
  she agreed to what she was so willing and happy to do, and for that matter
  both 'the next time' and 'the evening' had been her words before his. It was
  also comforting, up to a point, to think that she probably loved him no less
  &mdash;and perhaps more already&mdash;than some of the other inhabitants of
  her world.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He did not overwork at the Museum that afternoon, and at
Beeching, during
  the ensuing fortnight, he began to assemble the thesis into final shape.
  There was much more to be done for the Tripos examination than just that, but
  he would have all the following term for the rest of it once the thesis was
  out of the way. He found it hard to work at Beeching, and several times after
  breakfast he walked the dogs or rode his bicycle a few miles to some hill
  with a view or a tree-shaded river bank where he could concentrate on a book
  till distractions came&mdash;rain or a chill wind or his own thoughts
  tempting him to dream.</p>

  <p>One morning he received a wire from Brunon suggesting a meeting somewhere
  immediately, since Brunon had accepted a post in France and would soon be
  leaving England. Charles had the idea to invite him to Beeching, and it was
  arranged that he should come to lunch and dinner and stay overnight. Brunon
  duly arrived and met Havelock, who turned on the charm and proved an entirely
  delightful host. There were such times as this when Charles felt, not so much
  that he loved his father, as that the emotion of loving a father would have
  been a satisfying one if he could ever have been given long enough to develop
  it.</p>

  <p>During the drive to the station the next morning Brunon hinted at another
  holiday in France during the coming summer. 'We might go to the Cevennes and
  see those towns built on the tops of hills. I think you would find things to
  paint there.'</p>

  <p>Charles answered vaguely, not because the idea did not attract but because
  his thoughts of Lily made the future hard to delimit. Brunon noticed this and
  continued: 'Well, let me know if you can manage it... Or perhaps you have
  lost a little of your interest in painting since our Normandy excursion?'</p>

  <p>'Not a bit. It's just that I'm working so hard and don't have as much
  time.'</p>

  <p>'But you have scarcely mentioned painting while I have been here?'</p>

  <p>'I don't often talk about it in front of my father. He isn't very
  interested.' Then Charles told Brunon about Charnock's visit and the opinion
  of Charles's work he had expressed.</p>

  <p>Brunon snorted. 'That old pompier! What could you have expected? Pretty
  ladies on chocolate-box lids&mdash;it is all he is good enough for.'</p>

  <p>'He did a portrait of my mother. I don't know if you noticed it&mdash;
  over the mantelpiece in the hall.'</p>

  <p>'I did, but I did not know it was your mother. A very beautiful woman
  &mdash;though not, in my opinion, a very notable painting. Just competent and
  commercial. And who am I, you may ask, to despise either quality? You are
  right: I am nobody, and my opinion, as I have often told you, is of no value
  whatever.'</p>

  <p>Charles smiled. 'I have a feeling it is, if only because you've never told
  me <i>I</i> have any genius.'</p>

  <p>'Genius is a foolish word. It is not a label to be pinned on like a medal.
  Most likely you haven't got it, whatever it is&mdash;that I will readily
  admit. Maybe I would not recognize it even if you had it. I can only say that
  one of your paintings&mdash;the one of the ruins at Jumièges on that day when
  the white clouds were so big&mdash;you remember?&mdash;I showed that to a
  friend in Paris.' He mentioned the name of a well-known dealer who had made a
  fortune by commissioning and marketing the work of the newer school of
  post-impressionists.</p>

  <p>Charles forced a mask of nonchalance over his excitement. 'And did he say
  I had any genius?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'Did he even offer you a price for the picture?'</p>

  <p>'No. But he said something he would not have said if he had been quite
  sure you had only talent. He said you should go on painting for ten years and
  then, if he was still alive, let him see something else.'</p>

  <p>Charles laughed and took Brunon's arm affectionately. 'Ten years, André...
  that's quite a time to wait, isn't it? Not that I'd mind a bit.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Wednesday came and he went to London and took Lily to
dinner at Le Beau
  Soleil. They talked till he had to leave to catch the last train that would
  get him back to Beeching that night (or rather, early the next morning); and
  this decided him that next time he would stay overnight at a hotel. He did so
  the following week, but then there was HER train home to consider; it left
  Liverpool Street at five minutes past midnight. 'Oh no, it isn't the last
  one, Charlie&mdash;trains go to Chilford every hour all night&mdash; that's
  the station after Linstead&mdash;but Dad doesn't like me to miss the twelve-
  five.' Of course he suggested seeing her home, which she wouldn't hear of at
  first&mdash;she said there was really no need, she was used to the journey
  alone and her parents' house was only a few minutes' walk from Linstead
  station. But it wasn't merely politeness, he explained; he really wanted that
  extra time with her, and since she also wanted it with him she soon relented.
  So it came about that at one o'clock on a spring morning, full of the scent
  of trees just breaking into bud, Charles saw Linstead for the first time.</p>

  <p>Linstead is one of those huge dormitory suburbs of London that have spread
  till they touch other suburbs on all sides, like adjacent blobs of ink on
  blotting paper. You never know when you have entered or left Linstead unless
  you notice the slightly different ornamentation on the lamp-posts or a faint
  change in the texture of the road surfaces. The town has a core of history at
  its centre&mdash;a few old cottages in the widened High Road and a parish
  church rebuilt on the site of an earlier one; but for the most part (say
  ninety-nine per cent) Linstead is recent without being modern. Streets of
  small two-storied houses were pushed into a then open countryside by the
  speculative builder during the first decade of the century, their names
  sufficiently dating them&mdash;Kitchener, Roberts, Mafeking, Ladysmith. Lily
  lived in Ladysmith Road&mdash;Number 214, which was exactly like Numbers 212
  and 216, to which it was physically joined, sharing the walls of both. For
  that matter it was exactly like every other house in Ladysmith Road,
  beginning on one side with Number 2 and going up to 278, and on the other
  side from 1 to 277.</p>

  <p>Charles had never explored a suburb of this kind, never before having
  known anybody who lived in one, but he knew something of what they were like
  because every railway out of London in every direction ran through miles of
  them. The backs of the joined houses passed before the train traveller's eye
  in long successions, with gardens reaching to within a few feet of the
  tracks. Nobody could visit London frequently without sometimes, in sheer
  idleness, observing these back gardens, for they showed all the evidence of
  individuality that the houses so totally withheld. A paradise of flowers
  could succeed a littered wasteland in a second of train time; and on fine
  days the occupants were all so differently busy&mdash;boys mending bicycles,
  men digging, women chattering to neighbours across fences or hanging up
  clothes. Even an animal population throve variously&mdash;cats and dogs,
  rabbits in hutches, birds in cages; and once Charles had seen a monkey in a
  red jacket strutting along a garden path with its proud owner.</p>

  <p>But at the front of the houses facing the street all was uniform and
  characterless. The gardens there were small, with no more than a privet hedge
  to shield the bay windows from stares of passers-by&mdash;though for added
  protection the windows themselves were veiled with thick lace curtains. In
  Ladysmith Road the bay windows stretched for half a mile without a break, and
  because the road was so respectable there was not so much as a damaged fence
  or a house turned into a shop to break the monotony. Charles, however, came
  upon it first at night, when the municipal lamps made a golden lane between
  structural perspectives that might have been Versailles for all he could see
  of them.</p>

  <p>What he noticed most, during that first walk home with Lily from Linstead
  station, was that she seemed so thoroughly satisfied with the place. She
  pointed to the new cinema just opened in the High Road; she showed him the
  Carnegie Library and the secondary school and the shopping area which for
  some things, she claimed, was almost as good as the West End and much
  cheaper. But what stirred her to real boasting were the trees. Every road in
  Linstead, she said (and in Linstead the streets were all called roads), had
  trees planted on each side at intervals of a few yards, so that as they grew
  they would make long leafy avenues the like of which were not (she assured
  him) to be seen in any other suburb. And who did he think was largely
  responsible for this? 'My dad... he's in the Parks Department&mdash;it was
  his idea and at first the Council wouldn't agree because of the cost, but
  after a while they tried it in a few of the roads and it looked so nice they
  did it in all of them. My dad chooses the trees for the different roads
  &mdash;for Ladysmith Road he chose laburnum. This is Ladysmith Road. It'll
  look lovely in a few weeks.'</p>

  <p>'I think it does now.' Which only meant that he was with her still,
  treasuring the last few moments before he must walk back to the station
  alone, but not knowing when exactly that last moment would come, since she
  hadn't told him the number of the house. It might be the next one, and too
  late. So there and then, a few laburnum trees away from Number 214, he
  stopped and pulled her into an embrace. He was shy and a little clumsy about
  it, but she yielded so utterly that he found confidence as well as ecstasy.
  'Lily... are you surprised? You know I love you?... Do you?'</p>

  <p>'Darling, yes. All along I have. But I didn't know if you... and now I'm
  so happy...'</p>

  <p>He knew she had answered the question he hadn't yet asked, and how like
  her not to waste time, to let her mind race with her heart. They stood
  together for a long moment, exchanging words that fell away into
  speechlessness. Suddenly a large ginger cat sprang from a nearby garden and
  squirmed against them. She laughed herself out of his arms and stooped to
  caress the animal. 'Midge, Midge... This is Mrs. Carroway's cat&mdash;she
  lives next door... Midge, it's time I was home, isn't it?... Oh, Charlie, I
  won't sleep tonight and the South African mail goes out tomorrow, we'll be
  terribly busy at the office... Charlie, darling, I'm so happy... good
  night... Midge, Midge, Midge...'</p>

  <p>She ran away, waving to him, the cat following her.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A week later Charles returned to Cambridge. On the way
across London he
  met Lily for lunch and it was agreed that he must work hard and without time
  off till the examination. She not only consented, she insisted on it.
  Whatever happened, he must not neglect his work, though if she could help him
  by typing his notes... wasn't there anything like that she could do?
  'Charlie, I know how important the examination is. That's why I don't mind
  not seeing you. We can write, of course, but send your letters to the office
  because the post comes at home after I leave in the morning.'</p>

  <p>Within a week he had written that he must see her sooner, he couldn't wait
  till the end of term, he would take a day off the following week and come to
  London&mdash;he would work all the better afterwards, he was certain. She
  wrote back a firm no, but after a second letter in which he said her refusal
  had made it hard for him to work at all, she gave in. Then, when they did
  meet, it was as if the last barrier had broken down and they could no longer
  think of their relationship as limitable either by times or places.</p>

  <p>So thereafter, and throughout the term, meetings were every other week in
  London&mdash;on Saturdays, as a rule, since she finished work at one and they
  could spend the afternoon and evening together. Sundays, of course, she was
  entirely free, but that wouldn't have served, because she was expected to be
  at home most of the day unless she said where she was going and with whom.
  Without ever discussing exactly why, they both felt they had better keep
  their relationship as private as possible; all Charles's instincts were
  against letting his father know about her, though it was less clear why Lily
  had told her own parents so little about him. 'Of course they know there IS
  somebody, Charlie&mdash;and they know you're at Cambridge College... But my
  dad&mdash;well, he's a bit old-fashioned about some things.'</p>

  <p>On those Saturdays they went to all kinds of places&mdash;parks, museums,
  art galleries, the Zoo, the river up to Richmond and as far down as Woolwich.
  Sometimes they would take a bus at random and travel 'all the way', wherever
  it might lead and even in pouring rain; and then in some corner of a café in
  an unknown suburb find shelter and privacy. The hours sped by, no matter
  where they went. Usually he saw her home before beginning his own return
  journey, for he had to be back in college by midnight, and this meant
  catching the last train from Liverpool Street and a wild rush through
  Cambridge streets&mdash;scampering and running if the train were punctual,
  taking a cab if not. He managed to get in before the gates closed on every
  occasion except one, when there was thick fog; but this enabled him to
  clamber over the ancient college wall unobserved, following a tradition that
  was itself quite ancient. He barked his shins and ruined a pair of trousers
  and felt very adventurous. Those were happy days.</p>

  <p>Once he took her to the Alhambra, where they saw a pale and polite
  resuscitation of the old-fashioned music-hall. But Little Tich was on the
  programme, and though far past his prime, was still incomparable. It was a
  twice-nightly show and they went again to the second 'house', staying just to
  see Little Tich. 'My mum and dad used to see him when they were young,' she
  said, enraptured. 'That was at the old Collins in Islington. They lived in
  Islington then. My dad was born there, and my granddad was born in a house
  that was pulled down to build St. Pancras Station. We're real Cockneys
  &mdash;on my dad's side. Mum comes from Norfolk. She was a cook in a big
  house and dad travelled for a firm that put water-pipes in greenhouses.
  That's how they met. He gave her a rose and she gave him a meat pie. They
  often laugh about it now. Funny, isn't it, to think of your parents just
  before they see each other for the first time, not knowing what's ahead
  &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'WE'RE ahead,' said Charles. 'That's why it's funny.' But he was thinking
  that he didn't know where or how his own parents had met, and to change the
  subject even in his mind he added: 'So they got married and came to London
  and lived happily ever after?'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes. They have tiffs sometimes, of course. Dad bringing in mud from
  the garden and things like that. Nothing serious. They both like a quiet
  life. Most years they go to the seaside for a week. Mum always liked Margate
  &mdash;that's where they had their honeymoon&mdash;but dad's a bit of a
  roamer.'</p>

  <p>'So they roam?'</p>

  <p>'They generally go to Margate. Or Broadstairs.'</p>

  <p>Another time, on one of those Saturday excursions, he took a sketch-book
  with him. In a few minutes, while she watched, he roughed out an impression
  of the Serpentine on a May afternoon&mdash;children paddling and couples on
  the grass and riders close by along the Row. It was not very good because he
  had been showing off a little, anxious also not to spend much of their
  limited time on something he could do just as well on his own. If only their
  meetings could be oftener and for longer&mdash;if only he could take a
  holiday with her as he had with Brunon, driving an old car from village to
  village with no need to worry about missing trains or getting home
  late...</p>

  <p>She was captivated by the sketch and begged it from him. 'It's nothing,'
  he said, which was almost the truth. 'I've always liked trying to put what I
  see on paper. I paint a little, too, when I have time.' He was deliberately
  casual about it. He wanted her to ask to see his paintings and was slightly
  disappointed when she didn't, though it would have been hard to arrange if
  she had. Then he realized that such reticence was part of her entire
  attitude; despite willing gossip about her own and her family's affairs, she
  was equally willing not to know the things he did not choose to disclose.
  Likewise she accepted all his suggestions for places to visit, neither in
  subservience nor indifference, but from a simple pleasure she took in doing
  whatever he wanted.</p>

  <p>She was small, physically, and all his own preferences were permanently
  set by it&mdash;her height was the right height, the crook of her arm in his
  had the cosy curve and pressure, beauty to him was in the angle of her upward
  glance as they walked along. And she was LOVING&mdash;in a curious way that
  warmed the blood yet cooled the fever of it. Many times he waited for her at
  street corners and on railway platforms and always, at the revelation that it
  was she and none of the hundreds of others that had passed or were passing,
  something in his mind clicked into certainty, like a key turning in a
  lock.</p>

  <p>One evening as he was taking her home they met the Superintendent of Parks
  enjoying his evening stroll along Ladysmith Road. Naturally she made the
  introductions, and Charles noticed that after the first instant of surprise
  she showed little nervousness or embarrassment, but was clearly moved by an
  affection for both of them that made the whole encounter cordial. Mr.
  Mansfield was plump and slow-moving; the pursuit of horticulture under a
  municipal employer seemed to have given him a special serenity compounded of
  having a job he both enjoyed and could not lose. His high-pitched squeaky
  voice and Cockney accent (much more noticeable than Lily's) were odd but not
  inharmonious with his solid frame and deliberate movements.</p>

  <p>'So you're the chap Lily's bin seein' so much of litely?' He pumped
  Charles's hand up and down. 'Pleased to meet you, Mr. Anderson, I'm shore.
  And 'ow d'you like our part of the world?'</p>

  <p>'I think it's very nice,' said Charles tactfully, 'especially the trees in
  all the streets.'</p>

  <p>'I'll warrant that's what she put you up to say.' He was pleased, though.
  'Not that you ain't right about the trees. Mike all the difference, don't
  they?... You know Linstead?'</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid not, sir.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Mansfield chuckled as he relit his pipe. 'You don't 'ave to call me
  'sir'. What d'you think I am&mdash;a school-teacher? Any'ow, 'ave Lily bring
  you round some Sunday for dinner. Can promise you a nice bit of roast beef if
  you fancy it.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you very much.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Mansfield passed on his way with a nod. When he was out of earshot
  Charles gripped Lily's arm with extra warmth. 'Well, aren't you glad? The
  best things sometimes happen by accident. Now he's met me he won't mind you
  being out late so often. Or at least I hope he won't. Nice old boy... Why...
  Lily... what's the matter?'</p>

  <p>'You REALLY like him, Charlie? You really DO?'</p>

  <p>'Of course. And remember what he said&mdash;you've got to ask me to dinner
  at your house.'</p>

  <p>'On a SUNDAY?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I can take a Sunday off instead of a Saturday. When shall we fix
  it?'</p>

  <p>'Any Sunday&mdash;if they know in time. You really want to come? You'll
  like my mum, too, that's certain, but I'm not so sure about Bert and
  Reg.'</p>

  <p>'Who's Reg?' At last he had been forced to ask.</p>

  <p>'He's Bert's pal. Reg Robinson. He always has dinner with us on
  Sundays.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">On Sundays in summer Ladysmith Road was rarely at its best.
The air was
  apt to be hot and impregnated with smells from a hundred households in which
  the ceremonial meal of the week was being prepared, and of this meal, though
  the ingredients were many and various and wholesome, the predominant smell
  was usually that of boiling cabbage. Ladysmith Road was far higher in the
  social scale than would have allowed noisy children to play in the gutter or
  dance to a hurdy-gurdy; indeed it was higher in the social scale than would
  have allowed street music on any day of the week; so instead, on Sundays,
  there was this vast and cabbagy calm, broken only by the murmur of someone's
  piano or the distant grind of trams along the High Road. At midday the pubs
  opened and the Sunday Schools closed, but the nearest pub and Sunday School
  were round several corners, so that their traffic was straggling and
  intermittent by the time it reached the laburnums. Nor was there on Sundays
  any of the movement which, like systole and diastole, drew the inhabitants to
  and from Linstead station and gave Ladysmith Road, between certain hours on
  weekdays, the appearance of being actually on the way to somewhere.</p>

  <p>Charles's visit to Number 214 was not an entire success, though he didn't
  think it was either his own fault entirely or that of the Mansfields. Their
  hospitality was friendly and their roast beef excellent. Charles had seen the
  outside of the house so often that its interior hardly surprised him; if at
  all, it did so by being cosier and more comfortable than he had expected. On
  the whole he blamed Reg Robinson for the fact that he failed to get over his
  initial shyness. He was always inclined to be shy with a group of strangers,
  at Beeching or Cambridge or anywhere else, but at Ladysmith Road it seemed to
  stay with him more obstinately because all the time he was afraid the
  Mansfields were thinking him stuck-up.</p>

  <p>Dinner was delayed (he could gather) by some minor mishap in the kitchen,
  so that they were not at the table till after three o'clock, by which time
  Reg had fully established himself as the life of the party. He banged the
  piano with slapdash facility, he sang (in tune but thunderously), he played
  gramophone records of comic songs he had brought with him, cueing the
  laughter in which he expected everyone to join. Charles, after deploring a
  first painful handshake, was ready to admit his good intentions, but soon
  found even this effort hard to sustain; while Reg, it seemed, saw in Charles
  the kind of dull fellow whom it was his social duty to wake up at all costs.
  To assist him he had the natural equipment of a loud voice and a set of
  verbal clichés and stale witticisms which he unloaded at every chance,
  evoking shrieks of laughter from Bert and from Lily's two sisters, Evelyn and
  Maud. Charles was troubled to notice that Lily also laughed, though perhaps
  only from politeness; it soon became clear, though, that Reg was much
  attracted by Lily and was on jocularly affectionate terms with her. 'Nice bit
  o' stuff, ain't she, Charlie?' he commented, nudging Charles in the ribs, and
  Charles could only mumble an affirmative.</p>

  <p>After dinner they sat in a small glassed-in annex to the dining-room while
  Mrs. Mansfield and the girls cleared the table. Beyond the windows was the
  garden, neat and pretty as might have been expected, with tall hollyhocks
  affording a token privacy from neighbours on either side. After an ample meal
  and in a comfortable chair Charles was ready to relax; he could have done so,
  and by now would almost certainly have lost his shyness, but for Reg. Reg was
  indefatigable, and his range of facetiousness limitless. It seemed he
  possessed a motorcycle and had driven to Cambridge on it with Bert. He gave a
  vivid description of the undergraduates with their caps and gowns; indeed he
  had a snapshot which he produced there and then for general inspection. 'You
  mean the boys have to wear them in the street?' Maud queried, and when Reg
  answered: 'Well, look, stupid, that's in the street, ain't it?'&mdash;Maud
  turned to Charles with an incredulous: 'Do YOU have to, Mr. Anderson?'</p>

  <p>'Don't call him Mr. Anderson, he's Charlie,' said Reg. 'Of course he does,
  don't you, Charlie? Looks like a dog's dinner in 'em, too, I'll bet... Wonder
  how I'd look if I wore 'em up the Mount?'</p>

  <p>This caused roars of merriment, during which Charles asked Lily, who was
  next to him, what the Mount was. 'It's where Reg works,' she whispered, but
  did not explain further.</p>

  <p>Maud did, whispering in his other ear. 'It's a cemetery. Reg works for an
  undertaker.'</p>

  <p>Charles smiled. At last he saw an opening and claimed his audience by the
  way he spoke up. 'I can understand, then, why Reg has such a sense of humour.
  What work exactly do you do, Reg?'</p>

  <p>'I'm in the office,' Reg answered, not quite comfortably.</p>

  <p>'You don't do any&mdash;er&mdash;spadework then?'</p>

  <p>'SPADEWORK?' Reg was at first genuinely puzzled, and puzzlement made him
  look sullen. After a pause he said truculently: 'I ain't a blasted
  gravedigger, if that's what you mean.'</p>

  <p>Charles was still smiling. 'No? I just thought that some of your jokes
  sounded a bit as if they'd been... disinterred.'</p>

  <p>At Cambridge or Beeching it would have raised a laugh, but not in
  Ladysmith Road. Evidently Reg's jokes were funny and Charles's weren't.
  Indeed a somewhat chilly silence supervened till Mrs. Mansfield broke it by a
  gentle rebuke to all: 'Really, I don't think we ought to laugh about things
  like that.' (But they HAD laughed, when Reg had first brought up the subject
  by mentioning the Mount!) Charles was bewildered even more than disconcerted,
  and from then on made no further attempts to challenge Reg in the field of
  humour. It was perhaps some consolation that Reg also seemed put out, and
  presently left to take a walk with Bert.</p>

  <p>Conversation was easier after that, and Charles gladly accepted an
  invitation from Mr. Mansfield to tour the garden. It could not have been more
  than a hundred feet long and twenty across, but it took Mr. Mansfield half an
  hour to name and explain the various plants and flowers. He hadn't spoken
  much at all inside the house, but the garden made him garrulous. Charles, who
  loved gardens, warmed to the man's obvious pride and quiet satisfaction.
  Presently Mr. Mansfield pulled out an old-fashioned watch and checked the
  time. 'Dunno 'ow you feel, Mr. Anderson,' he said hesitantly, 'but round
  about now I usually 'ave a little stroll. Just ourselves, mind you&mdash;I
  don't 'old with takin' ladies along, not on Sundays, anyway.'</p>

  <p>Charles was very willing to escape, and Lily looked equally pleased to see
  him on such good terms with her father. The two left the house and walked
  half a mile to the end of Ladysmith Road, then right along Mafeking Road to
  Roberts Road, then left as far as the Prince Rupert, a modern sham-timbered
  but decent-looking pub.</p>

  <p>'Dunno why they call it the Prince Rupert,' commented Mr. Mansfield, as
  they pushed through the doors. 'I never 'eard of no prince named Rupert.'</p>

  <p>Charles had, but he did not want to seem learned. 'Looks a nice place,'
  was all he said.</p>

  <p>'Not too bad&mdash;and quiet, mostly. It's what you might call the local
  round 'ere, for those that ain't teetotallers... What's yours, Mr.
  Anderson?'</p>

  <p>'Thanks, I'll have a bitter,' said Charles, beginning to feel more at home
  than for hours. 'But I wish you wouldn't call me Mr. Anderson.'</p>

  <p>'I know... the others kept callin' you Charlie... Ah, good evenin', Milly,
  two bitters for me and this gentleman... Some'ow, though, I thought they
  wasn't treatin' you quite respectful.'</p>

  <p>'RESPECTFUL?... Nonsense&mdash;why should they? I'm no older than any of
  them, except Lily.'</p>

  <p>'Well, yes, that's true, but after all you was a stranger, and that Reg
  &mdash;'e shouldn't rightly 'ave carried on the way 'e did... Mind you, 'e
  soon calmed down afterwards&mdash;you got your own back all right, only I
  think you 'urt 'is feelin's.'</p>

  <p>'I hope not. I certainly didn't intend to.'</p>

  <p>''E's a nice smart young feller,' Mr. Mansfield continued. 'Always ready
  with a joke&mdash;and&mdash;like you said, only you was bein' sarcastic
  &mdash;he ain't in a job where there's much fun, in a manner of
  speakin'.'</p>

  <p>'I'm really sorry if I did hurt his feelings,' Charles repeated.</p>

  <p>'Oh, 'e'll get over it. Lily'll tell 'im you didn't mean no 'arm.'</p>

  <p>The two bitters arrived, and Mr. Mansfield raised his glass to Charles.
  'Well, Charlie...' He paused to let the name achieve significance, then
  added: ''Ere's to us and our dear ones...'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Lily walked with him to Linstead station later, and on the
way they had
  their first slight tiff. It was about Reg, whose discomfiture after Charles's
  single crack at his expense seemed to have aroused her sympathy. Like her
  father, she thought Reg's feelings had been hurt, but Charles felt in no mood
  to apologize again as he had done once already at the pub. 'Look,' he said,
  'here's a fellow digs at me all afternoon and I take it&mdash;bad jokes
  included. Then I make one joke about him and he goes off in a huff.'</p>

  <p>'Not BAD jokes,' she objected. 'Reg has his faults, but he never says
  anything blue in front of ladies.'</p>

  <p>'BLUE?'</p>

  <p>'I mean the sort of jokes men tell to each other. Reg tells them to dad,
  but only when they're on their own.'</p>

  <p>'I see. I didn't know that's what "blue" meant. And you didn't know what I
  meant by "bad". I meant silly jokes, not blue necessarily, just jokes that
  aren't amusing.'</p>

  <p>'Almost as if we didn't speak the same language,' she said gaily. 'Anyhow,
  Charlie, they made everybody laugh.'</p>

  <p>Charles had to admit that they had, and that his own joke hadn't, and that
  any further development of that issue might bog down in a philosophical
  impasse. Was laughter a valid empirical test of humour? If there were no one
  to see it, could a joke ever be said to exist at all? It was a bit like the
  nominalist-versus-realist arguments of the medieval scholars. But all that he
  could hardly go into with Lily, and by this time the fact that they were at
  odds was beginning to trouble him, as also her suggestion (shrewd or na ve,
  he wasn't sure which) that they didn't speak the same language.</p>

  <p>'Oh, Lily,' he exclaimed, taking her arm (they were on the platform and
  the train was due and he couldn't endure the thought of separating from her
  on clouded terms)&mdash;'we're not going to quarrel about it, are we?'</p>

  <p>'Of course not.' And of course they were not. 'But I can't help being
  sorry you were bored.'</p>

  <p>'I wasn't bored at all.' He had to get back into the argument. 'It's just
  that a fellow of Reg's type always makes me shut up in company. I just can't
  compete with them.'</p>

  <p>'I know. He IS a bit noisy sometimes. Poor old Reg&mdash;he'd like to have
  had your advantages, going to Cambridge College to study. He's really clever,
  everybody says, but he had to leave school at fourteen. If only he'd been
  properly educated it would make all the difference.'</p>

  <p>'I don't believe it would,' Charles could not help replying. 'I've met
  fellows like Reg at Cambridge and I can't get along with them there either.
  You mustn't think education changes what people are like.'</p>

  <p>'Then what does it do?' she asked, again either na vely or shrewdly, and
  he had no time to speculate, for the train was coming in. He pressed her
  hand. 'Even if I knew an answer it would take me all night to give it to
  you.' He found a compartment and leaned out of the window to kiss her. 'Maybe
  you'd better come up to Cambridge and see for yourself... Yes, why not?
  That's a wonderful idea. Come the weekend after my examinations, then I'll be
  free and won't have anything on my mind. Leave on the Saturday and I'll get
  you a room at the Lion or somewhere&mdash;there's a good train back on Sunday
  evening... Will you, Lily?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know if dad would let me.'</p>

  <p>'But it's only fair&mdash;for you to come and see me once after all the
  times I've come to see you.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I know... Oh, I'd love to, Charlie, but I'll have to ask dad
  first.'</p>

  <p>'Fine. Ask him. I don't think he'll mind. He and I got along all
  right.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, you did, didn't you?' At last they had found something to agree and
  be glad about, and on this happier note could time their separation. 'I knew
  it when he took you to the Prince Rupert. He only does that with people he
  likes.' The train was beginning to move.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At Cambridge Charles was thereafter sustained a good deal
by thoughts of
  Lily's visit. Those were the days just before the examination that (with the
  Diplomatic in mind) might make or mar his career; and he had better not think
  it absurd, while he girded himself for last-minute cramming, that what he
  would be doing thirty years hence might depend on a few thousand facts so
  chancily selected and forcibly absorbed. The days entered a tunnel of
  eventlessness, but once the actual examination started the tunnel became
  dreamlike, streamlike, a silent aqueduct of time. Every evening, after the
  six-hour ordeal, an entire section of knowledge was banished from his mind as
  if it had no longer any business there, so that concentration on the
  remainder could become more intense. His tutor had warned him not to overdo
  the cramming, but Charles found he could not sleep even if he went to bed,
  and it was no harder to read than to lie awake. By the end of the third of
  the five crucial days he could roughly estimate how he was faring, and he did
  not think too well. Many questions he had been unable to answer confidently,
  and there had been few he would have chosen for a display of what he knew.
  One afternoon he half collapsed over the desk; the day was hot and the
  examination hall airless&mdash;all that, plus lack of sleep, probably
  accounted for it. An invigilator went out with him for a spell in the open,
  and Charles found it a strange effort to make conversation, knowing they must
  avoid mention of anything remotely connected with the questions. There was
  one about the Amphictyonic Council that Charles had been answering at the
  moment he slumped forward. He was afraid he had leaked his fountain pen all
  over the page, and he wondered if, in the circumstances, this would matter
  &mdash;whether, for instance, he should asterisk the smear with a note of
  apology&mdash;'Here I fainted owing to the heat'.</p>

  <p>'If there is any relief you wish for, please suggest it,' said the
  invigilator, after they had walked twice round a small quadrangle. Charles
  did not guess what he meant till he added: 'Though I am unfortunately
  compelled to accompany you, even to the humblest abode.' He was a lean
  elderly professor whom Charles had never seen before and whose name he did
  not know.</p>

  <p>'Oh no, thanks&mdash;I'm all right now. I think I can go back.'</p>

  <p>'I hope so, Anderson. When I mark your paper I shall try not to be unduly
  influenced by sympathy.'</p>

  <p>Charles smiled, wondering what made university dons grow up like that. Yet
  he was aware of genuine friendliness behind the man's tee-heeish manner.</p>

  <p>Back in the hall he found the ink smear already dry and the atmosphere
  sultrier than ever, but he managed to endure it without further mishap. He
  had lost half an hour, though, and didn't have time to finish all the
  questions.</p>

  <p>One evening, as by some gorgeous miracle of light and air, it was all over
  and he returned to his rooms after the last paper had been consigned to
  whatever fate might be in store for it and for him. He felt somewhat as he
  had done when the war ended&mdash;a sense of anticlimax following hard on the
  heels of relief. But the emptiness soon filled with thoughts of Lily's visit,
  which was by now a definite arrangement. Mr. Mansfield had given permission,
  and even Mr. Graybar had been persuaded to let her leave the office an hour
  earlier to catch a better train. In a recent note to Charles confirming all
  these matters both handwriting and spelling had betrayed her excitement.</p>

  <p>Saturday (almost to his unbelief) was the day following, and he spent half
  the night sleepless for thinking of it, but quite pleasantly awake for the
  same reason. In the morning, which was warm and fine, he rose early and
  bought armfuls of fresh-cut flowers at the stalls in the Market Square. Then
  he made plans with the college kitchen for special meals to be sent to his
  rooms. He had planned a small dinner party for that evening, inviting his two
  best friends&mdash;a man named Weigall whose rooms were on the same staircase
  across the landing, and another man from Sidney Sussex whom he had got to
  know at history lectures. Since the cost of this party would come on the
  college bill at the end of term he could indulge himself without any
  immediate financial problem, and with all the examinations over he felt he
  had earned the right to do so. His allowance from his father was not
  inadequate, but it had been stretched pretty far of late by all the
  travelling back and forth to London and the dinners and lunches and
  excursions there; he was beginning to look forward to his next birthday (his
  twenty-first) if only because he would then come into some money of his own.
  He had already borrowed a little from his Cambridge tailor (a wealthy and
  knowing tradesman) on the strength of this.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He felt very proud of her as they rode in an open taxi from
Cambridge
  station to the Lion Hotel. Other students had been meeting girls on the same
  train, and he could not avoid the comparison; Lily was not so well dressed as
  many, nor so strikingly pretty as a few, but she had poise and grace and some
  quality for him of sheer radiance. It was so personal that he was often
  relieved when he saw others&mdash;and not only men&mdash;aware of it; this
  seemed to prove he was no victim of love's illusion, though it also showed
  that the radiance was not for him alone. Anyhow, her own extreme of pleasure
  now cast a special halo round it, and he felt doubly exultant. 'You're really
  here&mdash;at last!' he kept saying in the cab, as if the distance to
  Linstead and London were reckonable in thousands of miles.</p>

  <p>'Charlie, I always wanted to come here to see you.'</p>

  <p>'Then why didn't you suggest it? Or why didn't I&mdash;sooner? It's so
  obvious&mdash;and yet wonderful.'</p>

  <p>'I thought perhaps you didn't want me mixed up with your work.'</p>

  <p>'You already are mixed up. I see you on every page of Stubbs and
  Maitland.'</p>

  <p>She laughed gaily. 'And I see you on every page of Mr. Graybar's
  dictation.'</p>

  <p>'Forget Mr. Graybar&mdash;for two whole days.' He squeezed her arm and
  thought that possibly in his own room, sometime during her stay, they would
  enjoy the privacy they had sought till then in streets that happened to be
  dark or train-compartments that happened to be empty between stations; he
  knew this Cambridge visit was bound to mark a stage in their
  relationship.</p>

  <p>He began to point out the colleges. 'That's the first one, Downing&mdash;
  I mean the first on the way from the station. The next is Emmanuel... They're
  all separate, and together they make up the University. So you see why you
  can't say Cambridge College&mdash;there isn't such a thing&mdash;if you talk
  of a college you have to use its own special name&mdash;like Downing or
  Emmanuel.' He had always wanted to explain that to her.</p>

  <p>'How many colleges are there?'</p>

  <p>'Over a dozen, I should think&mdash;yes, at least a dozen.'</p>

  <p>'Don't you know exactly?'</p>

  <p>'I don't believe I do, unless I counted them on my fingers... This is
  Christ's&mdash;John Milton's college. We'll look round some of them later...
  Here's Petty Cury&mdash;this narrow street, where your hotel is. I think
  you'll be comfortable.'</p>

  <p>He had engaged a room, even going so far as to inspect it before approval;
  it overlooked Petty Cury and might be noisy till late at night, but she
  wouldn't be using it till then. While she took her bag to it he waited in the
  glass-roofed lounge. Then she came down, spruced and tidied, and his heart
  melted to see her against this new background, but at the same time he felt
  tense, as if the full significance of her visit was only just dawning on him.
  He also hoped he could sleep better during the coming night; it was a need,
  like others he was beginning to be aware of, that went deeper than a desire.
  Suddenly he wondered what on earth had made him ask Tony Weigall and Bill
  Peters that evening&mdash;how much cosier just to have dinner on their own,
  with no strangers intruding when once Debden had cleared away and said
  goodnight.</p>

  <p>They crossed the centre of the town to his college, which he was anxious
  to show her first, as a sample, though it was not the oldest or one of those
  most visited by sightseers. She was much impressed by the salute the porter
  gave him as they passed into the First Court, and surprised by the narrow
  staircase they had to climb and the double doors he had to open to get to his
  top-floor rooms, and entranced by the rooms themselves&mdash;so much larger
  and grander than she had imagined. He then took her to the Chapel and the
  Library and the Hall, where he showed her the ancient tables and the Holbein
  and the piece of wood, shaped like a hand-mirror, that had printed on it the
  college grace which he had taken his turn to read aloud until, with no
  particular effort of memory, he had come to know the long Latin paragraph by
  heart. Then they strolled along the Backs and looked into King's Chapel till
  it was time to return to his rooms, when it was revealed to her (by the most
  plausible of circumstances) that seventeenth-century college rooms lacked
  some of the basic conveniences of the modern house. She was surprised again,
  but agreeably unshy about such things and therefore amused. Perhaps because
  of this he decided to conquer his own shyness about something very different,
  but in its own way just as intimate; he got out some of his paintings. He was
  always reluctant to do this&mdash;too often he had read in the eyes of people
  looking at other people's paintings neither enthusiasm nor distaste, but
  merely a desperate struggle to think of something to say that was clever or
  at least flattering. It was a test, therefore, that he shrank from putting
  his friends to, because he shrank from putting himself to it. But now with
  Lily, acting on impulse, he took the risk. He fixed the easel and placed the
  canvases on it one by one, saying nothing about any of them, while she sat
  curled in the window seat viewing them equally without word or gesture.</p>

  <p>When she had seen the lot and he had put them away again he poured himself
  a glass of sherry. She still didn't speak, and he began to approve of her
  silence in a miserable sort of way. At least she wasn't dealing out insincere
  and meaningless compliments. Presently she said: 'Charlie, I'm so glad you
  let me see the pictures. It's no good my trying to tell you what I think of
  them because I don't know. I liked some better than others. I liked the one
  of the windy day.'</p>

  <p>'Which one was that?'</p>

  <p>'The third, I think, or the fourth.'</p>

  <p>He knew the one she meant; it was a fenland scene, mainly clouds&mdash;a
  windy day, to be sure (the canvas had been blown down by one of the gusts),
  but there were no obvious clues like bending trees or drifting smoke. What he
  had tried to do, but did not think he had succeeded in doing, was to get the
  wind into his lighting of the sky, into the whole surface texture of the
  picture. And now she was telling him he had succeeded.</p>

  <p>Never had he felt such a moment of utter and blissful reassurance. He went
  over to her and put his arm round her in full view of anyone who might be
  passing across the court, and in a curious way he hoped he might be seen, as
  the finder of a new truth wants to proclaim it.</p>

  <p>'Lily, my little one&mdash;my darling...'</p>

  <p>'Did I say the wrong thing about the pictures? Oh, I'm sorry,
  Charlie.'</p>

  <p>'Nothing you say is ever the wrong thing. It's I who DO the wrong things.
  Tonight, for instance, we ought to have been alone.'</p>

  <p>'But you asked some friends of yours, didn't you?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I did, and I&mdash;but no, it's all right, you'll like them. They're
  good fellows.'</p>

  <p>'Of course I'll like them.'</p>

  <p>The college clock began to strike the hour, followed by other clocks all
  over the town. The miscellaneous near and distant chiming lasted for some
  time, many of the clocks being minutes fast or slow, and he told her it would
  all begin again, for the quarter, after about a ten-minute interval. 'They'll
  probably keep you awake all night.'</p>

  <p>'I won't mind. I'm so excited to be here. Charlie, d'you know this is the
  first time I've ever been away from home by myself?'</p>

  <p>'You're not by yourself.'</p>

  <p>'I mean at night... without a friend.'</p>

  <p>'What friend? I didn't know you had any other particular friend.'</p>

  <p>'Of course I have. I mean girls. There's Ethel at the office&mdash;we
  always go away on our holidays together. And there's Phyllis Baxter I used to
  go with at school. You haven't met them because every time you're free I'd
  much rather be with you.'</p>

  <p>'A good answer.'</p>

  <p>'Don't you believe me?'</p>

  <p>'I do. And it WAS a windy day in that picture. It was indeed.'</p>

  <p>In the mood he was in, torn between exultation and regret, between the
  wish that they were alone and the hope that his friends would like her, and
  over it all the tensions that had not been eased by sleep, he could hardly
  understand himself, much less expect her to understand him.</p>

  <p>'Charlie, what's the matter? You sound so sharp, as if you were nervous
  about something.'</p>

  <p>It was because he had heard Weigall and Peters coming up the stairs.</p>

  <p>Within a few minutes he was relieved at least on one count. Weigall had
  draped his long legs from the far end of the couch and Peters was at the
  nearer end, and in between, laughing and chatting as if she had known them
  for years, was Lily. It came out that Weigall's family were from Norfolk and
  that Lily, too, had relatives there; they talked about Norwich and
  Sandringham and other places they both knew. With Peters, who was a
  historian, Lily found less in common at first; but soon they discovered a
  shared interest in films, Peters being something of a highbrow while Lily was
  just an ordinary regular patron of whatever the Linstead cinema offered.
  Peters seemed to find her comments both amusing and delightful, and when
  Debden announced that soup was served Peters insisted on sitting next to Lily
  although Charles had planned to have Weigall there. But with only four
  persons at a small table it really didn't much matter how they sat. What did
  matter, as Charles began to notice it, was that Peters was bringing Lily to a
  kind of life Charles had never seen in her before. Charles even wondered
  whether he had ever been jealous before, for the glum and spiritually
  disabling sensation he felt was new in his experience.</p>

  <p>Lily was telling Peters about a dog they had had at Ladysmith Road when
  she was a child, and it appeared that Peters also liked dogs and that his
  family had had one of the same breed. 'There's nothing like a dog,' Peters
  assured her.</p>

  <p>'Except a cat,' said Lily. 'We have a lovely cat.'</p>

  <p>'But a cat isn't really like a dog,' said Peters.</p>

  <p>Weigall winked at Charles. 'Too intellectual for me&mdash;this
  conversation,' he commented.</p>

  <p>'We have two Airedales at Beeching,' said Charles, suddenly desperate to
  assert himself.</p>

  <p>Peters laughed. 'You see, Lily, we can't win! TWO Airedales! Think of
  that... and how many horses, cows, housemaids, butlers, grooms, and other
  domestic pets? I don't suppose Andy knows&mdash;he's never bothered to
  count.'</p>

  <p>'He didn't even know how many colleges there are in Cambridge,' said Lily,
  extending the joke. 'Did you, Charlie? And you never told me they called you
  Andy, either.'</p>

  <p>Charles was concerned lest she should gain an exaggerated impression of
  Beeching from Peters' nonsense, but he was also astonished&mdash;and perhaps
  dismayed&mdash;that Lily seemed to be impressed so little. It was the 'Andy'
  she had picked up. 'It's just a nickname I had at school,' he explained,
  adding rather foolishly: 'From Anderson.'</p>

  <p>'Really?' Weigall gave himself an ironic poise. 'I think we can accept
  that as a hypothesis.' He intoned in imitation of some professor. 'And as for
  how many colleges there are, does ANYBODY know?'</p>

  <p>This kind of thing was lost on Lily. 'Well,' she said, 'when I was at
  school we were told how many counties there are in England.'</p>

  <p>'What a depressing school it must have been!'</p>

  <p>'It was not! It was better-looking than some of these old colleges.'</p>

  <p>Weigall assumed his most languid air. 'BETTER-looking, Lily?'</p>

  <p>'Newer. More modern. I tell you, Linstead's an up-to-date place. You
  should see some of the parks we have. My dad's the superintendent of
  them.'</p>

  <p>Peters abruptly seized Lily's hand across the table. 'Lily... ignore these
  other two and listen to me. First, I congratulate you. To have a father who
  superintends parks is magnificent. My own father, God bless him, is a coal
  miner. Lived in the same cottage for thirty years&mdash;a cottage in a town
  where there are no parks and consequently no superintendent of parks. My
  father began work in the pits when he was eleven, and he still works in the
  pits. But by sheer grit and ability his son, whom you see here in a
  preliminary stage of intoxication... by sheer... whatever it was I just
  said... plus, of course, an army grant and a scholarship and sundry other
  assistances... has been admitted to this ancient seat of learning to study,
  ape, and acquire the manners and customs of his betters... while still
  retaining, Lily&mdash;and this is important&mdash;that innate sympathy with
  the working classes that makes him salute you, as he does now, in profound
  adoration!'</p>

  <p>Charles contrived a smile, but Lily was blushing through the beginnings of
  tears. 'Oh, go on with you,' she murmured, but she did not withdraw her hand.
  'I'm not crying because I believe a word you say&mdash;it's the way you make
  me feel... Charlie, does he often talk like that?'</p>

  <p>Charles would have had to admit that Bill Peters often did, after a few
  drinks; but there wasn't time to answer at all before Peters raised his glass
  and demanded a toast. 'To the Labour Party and the working classes,
  Lily!'</p>

  <p>'Oh, that's a lot of nonsense!' she retorted. 'My dad votes
  Conservative!'</p>

  <p>She wouldn't drink, but she turned to them all with a rosy smile, finally
  settling it on Charles. 'Darling, it's such fun being here... I didn't know
  clever people could be so silly.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The rest of the evening passed for Charles in a fog of
sensations, one of
  which was amazement at the new dimension of personality Lily was revealing.
  It pleased him up to the point where it began to hurt. He had feared that
  Weigall and Peters might not like her, or that she might be too nervous to
  talk to them, and though he was glad he was wrong he was not quite at ease
  enough to be happy.</p>

  <p>But he was beginning to be sleepy and that was something. The party could
  not last much longer, for by midnight according to university rules Lily
  would have to be out of college and Peters back at his lodgings across the
  town. When half-past eleven struck and Peters did not make a move, it was
  Lily who picked up the signal. 'Ought I to go, Charlie? You tell me
  when.'</p>

  <p>Peters said: 'Don't fidget, Andy&mdash;she doesn't have to leave till a
  few minutes to twelve.'</p>

  <p>'But I have to get back here before they shut the gates,' Charles
  said.</p>

  <p>'You don't have to go at all. I can drop her at the Lion&mdash;it's right
  on my way and I'm in rooms&mdash;my landlady never says a thing if I'm a few
  minutes late.'</p>

  <p>Charles felt himself challenged by some test of fair-mindedness, logic,
  magnanimity, reasonableness, and other qualities which he admired. He didn't
  exactly consent to the arrangement, but somehow he let it fix itself without
  further argument, and about five minutes to twelve Peters left with Lily. She
  was evidently thrilled that he was wearing a cap and gown and would thus
  escort her, and it was just Charles's bad luck not to have given her this
  pleasure himself, for academic costume in the streets was at all times
  permissible, though not compulsory till after dark.</p>

  <p>While the departing footsteps were echoing down the staircase and across
  the court to the gateway, Weigall lit another cigarette. He, being of the
  same college, could stay as long as he liked. 'Good company,' he
  commented.</p>

  <p>'You think so?'</p>

  <p>'For her age... must be very young. You know, Andy, when you first
  mentioned a girl coming up to see you, I thought she was a friend of the
  family or something.'</p>

  <p>'What do you mean?'</p>

  <p>'Well&mdash;er&mdash;isn't there some girl that your family hopes you'll
  marry some day? There generally is, with most families. Some dreadful
  creature quite often, with huge front teeth and lots of money. Thank God your
  little Lily isn't like that.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Charles, 'she isn't like that.'</p>

  <p>Weigall went on: 'She's charming, and she has a bright eager mind that's a
  joy to make contact with. I think I could ring most of my change on her
  counter&mdash;when she's a little older. What puzzles me is where you could
  possibly have picked her up?'</p>

  <p>'Why is it such a puzzle?'</p>

  <p>'Because... I suppose I somehow didn't think of you as a picker-up
  &mdash;not in that sense.'</p>

  <p>'What sense?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, come now, Andy, have a heart! Don't you want me to talk frankly? I've
  told you I like her, and that's the truth, but unless she's destined to be
  your future wife do I have to pretend you were introduced by the vicar of
  Beeching?'</p>

  <p>Charles said in a clipped staccato voice: 'I met her in a Lyons teashop in
  London. Her father, as she told you, works for the local council in a suburb.
  They live in a small house in one of those terribly long streets&mdash;not a
  slum&mdash;just dreary and respectable. She's got a Cockney accent, which you
  heard. Socially I suppose you'd call her lower middle class&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Good God,' Weigall interrupted, 'who cares about class nowadays except
  smart fellows like Bill Peters? He's a snob in reverse&mdash;one of these
  days he's going to make that miner's cottage business pay off like a bonanza.
  Whereas you and I, Andy, are stuck in between&mdash;we weren't born at
  Blenheim or Chatsworth on the one hand, and on the other hand we didn't
  starve in tenements or pick crusts out of gutters... We just come from
  country homes with bits of land and families that go back a few centuries
  without having collected any titles or riches on the way... Well, that's not
  quite true in your case, your father has a knighthood, but I gather he earned
  it, which is bad... I tell you, Andy, in the world I see coming our
  background&mdash;yours and mine&mdash;is going to be a pretty fair handicap.
  We'll be the excluded middle&mdash;if you'll pardon a logician's term. So
  prepare to defend yourself, not Lily. She's all right. She'll sleep well
  tonight&mdash;she hasn't our worries. You look worn out, by the way. Why
  don't you get to bed?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I think I will. Thanks, Tony.'</p>

  <p>'Thanks for what? I haven't given you any advice... Good night.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">But again Charles could not sleep and heard the quarters
maddeningly till
  nearly dawn. Then he got up and crossed the courts to the new bath-house
  (built as a post-war innovation in collegiate life); a hot bath made him feel
  better and fresher. He had promised to have breakfast with Lily at the Lion
  at half-past ten, but after eight, when the college began to come to life,
  time passed most slowly of all. Debden, who was doubtless curious about Lily,
  chattered with his usual amiable inquisitiveness as he tidied up the room,
  venturing to observe that it would be 'a lovely day for taking the young lady
  on the river'.</p>

  <p>Charles agreed. 'Yes, I might do that.' And so he might. He had not made
  definite plans, hoping that Lily might care to spend part of the day quietly
  in his rooms.</p>

  <p>She was a few minutes late coming down to meet him at the Lion, and while
  he waited in the lounge he wondered about Peters and her the previous night.
  Had they talked till much later, at the hotel, and was this why she was late?
  Peters had said his landlady would let him in after midnight without making a
  fuss... Was it possible, then, that... but no, it was not only impossible, it
  was absurd... and anyhow, here she was.</p>

  <p>'Charlie, I'm sorry. Been waiting long?'</p>

  <p>'No, I only just got here. Did you sleep well?'</p>

  <p>'Wonderfully. The clocks didn't bother me at all... Oh, what a lovely time
  I had last night.'</p>

  <p>'You did? I'm glad. I had an idea you'd like Weigall and Peters.'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, they're nice.'</p>

  <p>'Peters especially. Did he talk to you much on the way?'</p>

  <p>'All the time. He does talk all the time, doesn't he? But of course it was
  only a few minutes. It's really a small town to walk across.'</p>

  <p>'Compared with Linstead&mdash;and when you're in amusing company.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, you can't compare it with Linstead. And I'd much rather have been
  with you&mdash;only, as you said, it would have meant leaving earlier.'</p>

  <p>'I think it was Peters, actually, who made the arrangement.'</p>

  <p>'Was it?'</p>

  <p>'It doesn't matter.' He seized her arm clumsily. 'Lily, you must forgive
  me&mdash;I'm being foolish. One good night's sleep and I'll see everything
  straighten... Don't take me seriously now. Let's have breakfast.'</p>

  <p>During the meal he felt happier, relaxing in her company and in her
  obvious pleasure to be with him. But she was troubled about his earlier mood.
  'Charlie, what's wrong? Why can't you sleep?'</p>

  <p>'Overwork, I suppose, these last few weeks. Nothing to worry about.'</p>

  <p>'And taking all those days off to see me. You shouldn't have done
  that.'</p>

  <p>'On the contrary, they kept me going.' He laughed uncertainly. 'I probably
  can't live without you, Lily.'</p>

  <p>'Anybody ever say you had to?' she laughed back. It was one of the few
  times she had touched, even as lightly as that, on the notion of a
  future.</p>

  <p>'They'd better not.'</p>

  <p>She caught the grimmer note in his voice. 'Don't be cross about something
  that hasn't happened.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not cross about anything, really. Not when I'm with you.'</p>

  <p>'Maybe you'll sleep better tonight.'</p>

  <p>'After you've gone? I wonder.'</p>

  <p>'If those chimes keep people awake at nights I don't know why they have
  them.'</p>

  <p>'Probably because they've had them for years and years and years. In
  Cambridge that's a good reason.'</p>

  <p>'Never mind, you'll be on your holidays soon. It's country where you go
  home to, isn't it? That's one thing about the country&mdash;nice and
  quiet.'</p>

  <p>'Not always nice and sometimes TOO quiet. What will I do there now I
  haven't got an examination to work for?'</p>

  <p>'Aren't there some more examinations sometime?'</p>

  <p>'That's a cheerful idea.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I thought if you WANTED something to do... But if I were you I'd
  just take a rest. Bill told me you'd been working too hard.'</p>

  <p>'Bill Peters? He wouldn't know&mdash;he's in another college. Besides,
  nothing's hard work to him. I mean, he takes everything in his stride&mdash;
  examinations, sports, debates, even acting at the Footlights. Just like my
  brother Lindsay who died. One of those all-round fellows. Sure to have a
  career. A First for certain and probably a Blue and President of the Union
  &mdash;the whole bag of tricks. Nothing can stop him... and I like him
  enormously. I'm lucky to have him for a friend. He's very popular.'</p>

  <p>'Why are you talking so much about him?'</p>

  <p>'Aren't you interested? You seemed so last night&mdash;and he liked you
  too, that was obvious.'</p>

  <p>She shook her head, but in dismay more than denial. 'Oh, Charlie, it
  doesn't seem to work well, does it, either when you meet my friends or I meet
  yours?'</p>

  <p>'PLEASE...' He struggled with some inward fret that centred round the pit
  of his stomach. 'Please forgive me again. The same old foolishness. The truth
  is, I wish I could have more time alone with you. Other people somehow seem
  to get in the way.'</p>

  <p>'All right then, let's be alone.'</p>

  <p>'For the rest of the day? That isn't much.'</p>

  <p>'It's all we have. I wish it were more too.'</p>

  <p>Then he heard his longings framing themselves into words that desperately
  came close and yet fought shy of what they really meant. 'Lily, you're
  supposed to go back by the 9.12&mdash;what if you didn't? Suppose I borrow a
  car&mdash;I think I could&mdash;and we'll go off somewhere on our own
  &mdash;now&mdash;this morning... and have all the time we can together
  &mdash;at some quiet place in the country... And tomorrow I'll drive you
  right to the door of the office&mdash;not too late for Mr. Graybar, I
  promise... Could you? WOULD you?'</p>

  <p>She answered immediately and simply: 'Yes, if you want. But I must send
  dad a wire.'</p>

  <p>'Tell him you're staying here another night.'</p>

  <p>'I won't say "here", I'll just say "staying". Then it won't be a lie. I'd
  hate to tell my dad a lie.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It took him till mid-afternoon to fix all the details of
the sudden change
  of plan. He had to hire a car (not as easy on a Sunday as he had thought),
  and secure an overnight exeat from the college authorities (easy now that
  examinations were finished), and think of something plausible to tell Debden.
  The truth seemed most plausible of all&mdash;that he was just driving his
  guest back to London and would return the next day.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile she sent the wire to her father.</p>

  <p>They drove out of Cambridge southward over the Gog Magog hills towards
  those rolling Essex uplands that are never high but give every half-mile a
  changing contour. Presently they stopped at a small country town. It had a
  church with a crocketed spire that Charles would have sketched if he had been
  less tired, but they were satisfied to look around and then have tea in a
  nearby cottage. They didn't know where they would drive on to next; Charles
  hadn't even a map. It was the kind of wandering he had often dreamed of
  having again, after that week in Normandy with Brunon, and here it was, with
  her, a reality, yet still enclosed in a dream. As they explored the narrow
  streets the dream reached to the sky, as if actual sleep, like a great bird,
  was already wheeling and swooping over his head. The town was almost
  deserted, full of Sunday stillness till they reached a central square, where
  a Salvation Army band oompahed in the sun without any audience. There was an
  ancient timbered building which they crossed the square to inspect; it was a
  fifteenth-century cloth hall, still in use as a municipal office. They passed
  close to the band on the way back, and as they did so there came over the
  trombones and tambourines a sound so startling in an Essex town that they
  stared incredulously. A Salvation Army man approaching with a collection
  plate grinned at their astonishment and supplied the explanation. 'The circus
  just came in. Starts tomorrow for the Fair week.'</p>

  <p>'Fair week?' Charles echoed, fishing in his pocket.</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, we have a real big fair once a year&mdash;thank you, sir
  &mdash;people come from miles around. Just up the road.' He proudly jerked a
  thumb. 'Turn to the right over there by the bank. That's where you heard them
  lions.' He seemed to be generously recommending a better entertainment than
  his own.</p>

  <p>In a mood to see what was to be seen, they took the indicated direction
  and soon found why the centre of the town was so empty. A crowd that looked
  like the entire population was watching the unloading of a long line of
  circus vans into an open field. Everything was lively and noisy and smelly;
  the lions roared again in their cages, men yelled to each other as they
  hoisted the big tent, whips were cracked, ponies trotted, men in top hats and
  riding boots gave what was halfway a free show. In a field next to the circus
  there was to be the fair itself; here men in shirtsleeves were putting up
  stalls and coconut shies and unpacking hideous china that would doubtless be
  given away as prizes. Soon the street lamps gleamed over the scene of such
  unusual Sunday activity; naphtha flares were hung on the stalls, and a
  searchlight began to test itself against the sky. The noise and smells and
  brilliance increased as the job proceeded; but sometimes in the midst of a
  lull the Salvation Army band could be heard still playing cheerfully on and
  on.</p>

  <p>During one of those lulls he said: 'I think all this must be a bit like
  Nizhni-Novgorod.'</p>

  <p>'What?'</p>

  <p>'Somewhere you've never been and neither have I. It has a fair too&mdash;
  every year&mdash;or rather it did, before the Revolution. Perhaps still does.
  It's a place in Russia. I must have read about it somewhere.'</p>

  <p>'And it's like this?'</p>

  <p>'Might be. I don't really know why I think so. But a fair's a fair&mdash;
  everywhere.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, you're tired,' she agreed, as if that was what he had told her. 'You
  can't drive any more. Let's stay here.'</p>

  <p>'All right. If Nizhni-Novgorod has a decent pub.'</p>

  <p>The Swan was full, but recommended a cottage round the corner, the hotel
  being available for meals and garaging the car. A Mrs. Renshaw. 'Tell her the
  Swan sent you.' They told her the Swan had sent them, and the room she
  offered was under the thatched eaves, small and low-roofed and crammed with
  mahogany. The cottage was probably three hundred years old, but nobody had
  bothered much about that and all the walls had florid paper covering the
  uneven plaster. On the modern mantelpiece there were shells from some
  seashore and photographs of (presumably) Mrs. Renshaw's relatives. They were
  a glum collection and Charles was beguiled by their stares of disapproval.
  Lily was sympathetic, wondering from their faces if they had ever been
  happy.</p>

  <p>'Of course they were,' Charles said. 'It's just the way people used to
  pose for photographs. Now the man tells you to smile&mdash;in those days he
  must have said "Look serious". That was the fashion. Did Gladstone ever grin?
  Was Queen Victoria ever amused?... Well, yes, she was&mdash;a friend of my
  father's told him he was once at the Sutherland estate at Dunrobin when the
  Queen was being shown over, and in one of the rooms they looked into&mdash;
  by mistake, I suppose&mdash;they found a very fat policeman in bed with his
  clothes on... The Queen nearly collapsed with laughter.'</p>

  <p>'A friend of your father's knew the Queen?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, he didn't really know her&mdash;he was just there when it happened.
  Fat people in bed can be funny... thin people too.'</p>

  <p>'There's a lot of fun in just being a person&mdash;anywhere.'</p>

  <p>'So that's your view of life?'</p>

  <p>'Don't you like it?'</p>

  <p>'My little one... my darling... you know... you can't possibly know... how
  much it makes me love you.'</p>

  <p>'Love is fun too.'</p>

  <p>'Nizhni-Novgorod is fun.'</p>

  <p>'I'm glad we came here. Is that what you'll always call it?'</p>

  <p>'I don't think the people who live there call it that any more. I mean, in
  the real Nizhni-Novgorod. They've got some new name. I don't know what. I
  only know the old name because I read about the fair in a book. They used to
  have a fair there. A big fair there...'</p>

  <p>'Darling, you're so tired. I'm glad we came. Fancy, we both keep saying
  the same things again and again.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, fancy... I had an aunt who said "fancy" to everything. "Fancy" or
  "Just fancy" or "Fancy that". Fancy this. Just fancy us being here...'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Later he said: 'I've done rather badly in the examination.
I know I have,
  but I don't mind about it now&mdash;that's why I can tell you. I couldn't
  even finish one of the papers&mdash;I fainted or something in the middle
  &mdash;the heat it was&mdash;I can't think why they chose a hall that had
  such poor ventilation... Anyhow, I probably won't scrape through with more
  than a Third&mdash;which isn't good enough for what I was supposed to be
  aiming for&mdash;the Diplomatic... So there you are&mdash;cards all on the
  table.'</p>

  <p>'I oughtn't to have taken up so much of your time.'</p>

  <p>'Oh no. Never think that. I couldn't have worked much harder than I did,
  anyhow.'</p>

  <p>'You could have rested instead of making all those trips to London.'</p>

  <p>'No, I shouldn't have rested&mdash;I should have tried to put in extra
  work and then broken down completely. Maybe you saved my life... Lily, I'm
  not like Peters. I can't take things in my stride. I'm not first-rate in his
  way, or the way my brother Lindsay was. That's why it's just as well to have
  a real failure now, at the beginning&mdash;then I'm definitely out of the
  race that I know I can't win. I'm not disappointed. My father may be, but not
  me. Or else he'll be disgusted... or perhaps in a queer sort of way glad that
  I've come such a cropper.'</p>

  <p>'GLAD, Charlie? I don't understand that.'</p>

  <p>'Never mind...'</p>

  <p>'But how... how could he...?'</p>

  <p>'Darling, all I mean is that this thing isn't a tragedy. I was never
  terribly keen on the Diplomatic&mdash;from what I've gathered it can be
  pretty dull and stuffy, and they send you to a lot of places you can't
  possibly enjoy... It was just one way of getting started.'</p>

  <p>'Away from home?'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, of course. I wouldn't want to stay at Beeching.'</p>

  <p>'You don't really like it there, do you? You've never told me much about
  it.'</p>

  <p>'That's not the reason. I didn't tell you much at first because I thought
  you'd imagine me too far out of your world, and I didn't want to be... and
  then I went on not telling you because I just hadn't before. There's nothing
  special about Beeching. Might impress you till you tried it, then you'd
  discover it had bad drains and no damp course and wasn't really very
  comfortable to live in.'</p>

  <p>'But your home&mdash;that's more than the house&mdash;that's really what
  you want to get away from.'</p>

  <p>'How do you know?... Well, in a way, you might be right. There are reasons
  I couldn't go into&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Charlie, can I ask one more question?'</p>

  <p>'All right.'</p>

  <p>'What was your mother like?'</p>

  <p>'We have a big portrait of her and if she was like that she was wonderful.
  Of course I don't remember her.'</p>

  <p>'So you couldn't love her. And you don't love your father.'</p>

  <p>'Why do you say that?... Well, I'll admit I don't love people as you do.
  You love everybody. Which really means anybody... Oh no, that's an unfair
  thing to say. I'm sorry, Lily. All I mean is that it must make it hard for
  you to FALL in love when you...'</p>

  <p>'I did with you&mdash;the first time we met.'</p>

  <p>'No, the second. The first time you didn't even look at me. That was when
  <i>I</i> did&mdash;while you weren't looking. I think we ought to get married
  quickly&mdash;before you look at somebody else... Lily, I mean that.'</p>

  <p>'Do you?'</p>

  <p>'Yes... Oh God, yes. More than I've ever meant anything.'</p>

  <p>'Are you SURE it's what you want, Charlie?'</p>

  <p>'Don't you want it?'</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;if you do... and if dad consents. I can't without that, because
  of my age. You can't either, till you're twenty-one.'</p>

  <p>'I'll be that in a few weeks. We might live abroad. It's cheap in France
  these days, on account of the exchange. And another thing&mdash;I could do
  some painting there... Yes, even after a Third. You never guessed I was
  serious about it, did you? You thought it was just a hobby?'</p>

  <p>'I thought it was a serious hobby&mdash;like dad's gardening.'</p>

  <p>'Well, why not? Oh, Lily, we shall get along fine. The things I really
  want in life are simple if only I stick to them&mdash;and stick to wanting
  them... that's the trouble, I'm not one of those vital characters. I'm not
  power-driven, like Bill Peters... But a serious hobby I DO have&mdash;thank
  you for that description, I love you for it. So it's all settled&mdash; we'll
  live in France and I'll paint. How about it?'</p>

  <p>She said thoughtfully: 'Mr. Graybar does a lot of business with French
  exporters&mdash;I know their names and addresses&mdash;I've typed hundreds of
  letters to them&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He was thinking how delightfully irrelevant this was till she added: 'I'm
  sure I could find a job with one of them.' Shock and amazement were then
  added, so that he gasped out: 'Good God, you didn't suppose that was in my
  mind, did you?'</p>

  <p>'But you mightn't earn enough at first, Charlie. Not everybody buys
  paintings.'</p>

  <p>He didn't know then whether to laugh or cry&mdash;the intensely practical
  na veté of it reminded him of plunging into an ice-cold crystal stream in the
  sunshine. 'Look, darling... please understand... there's no question of you
  having to find a job, whether my paintings sell or not. As soon as I'm
  twenty-one I come into some money from my mother's estate &mdash;not much,
  but enough to live on in France... About three hundred a year...'</p>

  <p>'Three hundred pounds a year without working at all?'</p>

  <p>It occurred to him that he had never heard the central issue of modern
  economics stated so eloquently as by her own incredulity. It made him feel he
  had something to brazen out. 'Well, yes... so you see how it is&mdash;I can
  AFFORD my serious hobby&mdash;AND you.' He began to laugh. 'I'm laughing at
  myself for ever having worried about the future. Aren't YOU looking forward
  to it, Lily? There are beautiful places in France&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'And I could come home sometimes, couldn't I?'</p>

  <p>'Home?'</p>

  <p>'To Linstead. I'd like to see mum and dad now and again.'</p>

  <p>'Of course&mdash;as often as you want. France isn't the South Sea
  Islands.'</p>

  <p>'That would be fun too. Like that French painter who went there and lived
  with a native girl.'</p>

  <p>'WHAT?' He was amazed again. 'You mean Gauguin? I didn't know you knew
  anything about painters...'</p>

  <p>'I read a book about him once. I do read, Charlie&mdash;you ought to know
  that&mdash;I was reading when you first saw me. I'm not really so
  silly&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He found this utterly adorable. It was, he supposed, the effect of
  Cambridge&mdash;of seeing colleges and libraries, of meeting Weigall and
  Peters, who had also found her adorable. The whole idea of marrying her and
  going to France to paint gained on him so fast that he felt an intoxication
  in being alive; the darkness of the little room glowed into deep colours, the
  touch of her body next to him was an easing of every strain. She was so small
  and unshy and gay, and she had another quality, the word for which had been
  pale in his mind for years&mdash;ever since he had first heard it in church
  as a child; but now it sprang to warmth and meaning. LOVING-KINDNESS. She was
  loving-kind.</p>

  <p>They talked over all the details of the future till dawn showed at the
  sides of the window curtains. Now and then, in the distance, a lion
  roared.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A few hours later they began the journey to London, having
slept till it
  was too late for breakfast. As they approached the inner suburbs the sky
  darkened and rain began, so that the final miles of tramlined roads were slow
  and slippery. Charles had hoped to keep his word by delivering her at
  Kingsway in time for the normal office opening, but he was nearly an hour
  late. She said it didn't matter&mdash;and it would have been absurd, of
  course, if it had. When he stopped the car at the kerb, and before he could
  get out, she kissed him quickly and scampered through the rain to the swing-
  doors with an alacrity that seemed more absent-minded than apprehensive.</p>

  <p>He had a cup of tea at a café in Holborn, then drove back to Cambridge
  with the windshield-wipers marking slow time to his thoughts. It was two
  o'clock when he reached his rooms. He lay on the couch while Debden prepared
  a late lunch, but fell asleep and Debden did not wake him. He slept all
  afternoon and most of the evening and night. He had no more engagements; it
  was merely a matter of putting in days at the college till term was over and
  he could leave Cambridge for good. This was hard to realize&mdash;that it was
  his last term and his university career would soon be ended. He had no
  particular plans for a vacation and was in no present mood to think of any.
  Presumably he would go to Beeching, at any rate for a while, and he had
  arranged to meet Lily on his way there across London. That would be on the
  following Friday&mdash;five days hence.</p>

  <p>Afterwards when he looked back on that curious interval it seemed to him
  that most of the hours had been of sleep. For the first time in weeks the
  clock-chimes did not trouble him, and he would often doze on the couch and
  wake to find Debden offering some odd-looking meal on a tray. Debden was an
  understanding fellow and had seen many a reading gentleman overwork himself
  for an examination and then half collapse in this fashion. 'Sleep's the
  thing, sir. Can't do you any 'arm no matter 'ow much of it you get&mdash; and
  that's more than you can say of most things in life... There was a man I 'ad
  'ere once who didn't sleep a wink for weeks...' This, thought Charles, was an
  unlikely story, but he listened quite contentedly to many such excerpts from
  the lifelong saga.</p>

  <p>On Friday morning Charles went to early chapel. He was not a regular
  attender, but at the beginnings and ends of term he had made it a custom, and
  this morning, the last one of all, seemed an extra-special occasion. He
  remembered how emotional he had felt about Cambridge during his first term
  and that last year of the war, but of course the atmosphere then had been
  charged with the mystique of youth facing death. Three years later, amidst
  dubious peace and economic depression, the mood was far different, and
  Charles, at almost twenty-one, was different with it. He would have liked to
  let that final chapel service soak into him sentimentally, but he couldn't
  relax enough; the thought of meeting Lily for lunch in London made him look
  at his watch too often.</p>

  <p>Crossing the quadrangle afterwards he met Debden outside his staircase. He
  had tipped him well, and the man's mood was confidential and
  extra-curricular, as if Charles had already passed into the saga. 'Gentleman
  to see you, sir. Wouldn't give 'is name, but said 'e'd wait. He was the kind
  I knew it was all right, sir, to let 'im into your rooms.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He had never seen Havelock looking so well since the days
before Lindsay's
  death; that was a first impression. It was not merely that he was in one of
  the vaulting moods&mdash;there was a hint of something else that must have
  happened to generate such an air of authority. Charles fancied he was seeing
  his father as had many a judge and jury during those early years of triumph,
  and the spectacle was notable&mdash;even in some ways intimidating.</p>

  <p>'Well... this IS a surprise, father!'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I'm sure it is. How are you, Charles? I'm glad I've caught you
  before you took the train, because I have the car here. I thought we'd travel
  back together. Nice day for a drive across country. Farrow's with me.'</p>

  <p>Farrow was the chauffeur, which meant that the car would be the big
  Daimler, which Charles never liked as much as the small open car he drove
  himself. This detail cast its minor shadow; the larger and darker one was
  that his father's unexpected visit meant cancelling the arrangement to meet
  Lily in London. There was no alternative, though of course he could make a
  special trip to see her some other day, and soon. The disappointment hit him
  all the more acutely because their last meeting had left, as it was bound to,
  so many after-thoughts and after-emotions.</p>

  <p>He said, seeking to disguise how he felt: 'That would be nice... Have you
  had breakfast? Debden will get you some coffee... and in the meantime I must
  send a wire.'</p>

  <p>'A wire?'</p>

  <p>'Just to cancel an engagement. I'd planned to meet someone in London, but
  now that I can't manage it I must let them know.'</p>

  <p>'I see.' And then, when Charles had reached the door: 'Is it, by any
  chance, a girl?'</p>

  <p>Charles flushed and tried to laugh. 'Supposing it is&mdash;what then?'</p>

  <p>'If the girl's name is Lily Mansfield you needn't send it.'</p>

  <p>Charles recrossed the room, the warmth in his face draining to pallor as
  he approached his father. 'What makes you say that?'</p>

  <p>'She's not there&mdash;to receive it.'</p>

  <p>'Not where?'</p>

  <p>'Anywhere you would have sent it.' Havelock's eyes were shining. 'Now sit
  down. I've something to tell you... And no coffee. Close your outer door
  &mdash;sport your oak&mdash;do they still use that phrase?... We don't want
  to be interrupted.'</p>

  <p>Charles was now possessed by a single fear. 'Father, what's happened? For
  God's sake don't make a drama of it. Is she all right? Is she well? Has
  anything...?'</p>

  <p>'She's perfectly well&mdash;I didn't mean to alarm you. Now will you close
  that door?'</p>

  <p>After Charles had done so he heard a simple story of coincidence. Reg
  Robinson, it seemed, had been motorcycling on the previous Sunday evening and
  had found himself thirsty just outside the Swan in the little market town.
  From the saloon bar he could see into the dining-room where Lily and Charles
  were at one of the tables. Quelling an impulse to intrude, he had decided
  more shrewdly to watch and wait; presently he had seen them walk down the
  lane to a cottage. The possible significance of this grew on him slowly, but
  was soon (Havelock suggested) reinforced by personal jealousy and a strong
  surge of class-conscious virtue. He had made a few enquiries, taken down
  names and details, and then jumped on his motorcycle with the news. It was
  the following evening, however, before he passed it on. 'An interesting
  delay,' Havelock commented. 'Did he want time to think things over? Or was he
  enjoying a sense of power? He could have called before Mansfield went to work
  in the morning&mdash;but no, he waited till evening. Perhaps he was teased
  with the thought of talking to the girl beforehand&mdash;which he did. He
  telephoned her at her office during the day&mdash;just an innocent chat
  between friends, no disclosures on either side, yet both with a secret that
  must have been infinitely preoccupying. He asked her, perhaps, if she had had
  a pleasant weekend, and one may imagine her answer&mdash;casual enough, yet
  bringing a flush to her cheeks that no one observed...'</p>

  <p>Havelock was soaring into an empyrean of his own, so far unclouded by
  blame or moral censure. The voice, lyric in quality, flowed on effortlessly
  from sentence to sentence, developing a theme, building to some sort of
  climax. 'The temptations of youth, Charles, are not beyond comprehension to
  any man of mature age who remembers his own. I don't know what kind of youth
  you think I had myself, but I assure you it was far from flawless, far from
  the patterns of pulpit and schoolroom...'</p>

  <p>But by this time Charles was impatient; there was so much still that he
  did not know. He interrupted: 'Suppose we don't go into all that now, father.
  Just tell me a few more facts... do you mind?'</p>

  <p>'Of course not. Talk it over as much as you like. The whole matter's
  cleared up&mdash;there's no urgency. I'm telling you that in advance, because
  I don't want to scare you again. I'm sorry that at the outset you
  misunderstood me&mdash;it was my own fault for a somewhat clumsy opening
  &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Please, father&mdash;just the facts. Tell me&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You've had them all&mdash;all that are important. Your little escapade
  &mdash;as I said&mdash;was discovered and reported, and I'm bound to say it
  was sheer bad luck&mdash;this fellow cruising about on his motorcycle
  &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'But what do you mean by saying it's all cleared up?'</p>

  <p>Then a curious transformation came over Havelock's face. It changed almost
  in texture as well as expression&mdash;from smooth and bland to rough and
  tough. It occurred to Charles, still under the influence of his first
  impression, that this was the sort of thing that must have happened when his
  father had cross-examined witnesses&mdash;first the sweet mellifluous
  questions, the artless probings, the seeming sympathy, the words, words,
  words to soften and disarm; then, all at once, the rapier-thrust.</p>

  <p>'Just this,' Havelock snapped. 'You were in a damned mess and I've got you
  out of it. This girl and her parents could have ruined your life. They had
  you in their power. I'm not exaggerating. It would have been easier to handle
  them if they'd been blackmailers, or if the girl had been some cheap little
  tart. But they're decent people. Keep away from decent people when you're in
  the mood for mischief of this kind. That's sound advice from a lawyer. I've
  known cases like this before and seen men jailed for them. Luring a minor
  from home for an immoral purpose&mdash;Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885
  &mdash;ABDUCTION&mdash;how do you like the sound of it? But that's what I
  could convict you of, you fool, if I were prosecuting and you were in the
  dock!'</p>

  <p>Charles didn't like the sound of it at all. He was sheerly appalled and
  there wasn't a word he could reply. He felt he had heard a story about
  someone else whose behaviour couldn't be likened to any that had ever been
  his own.</p>

  <p>Then Havelock's face relaxed somewhat. Beguilement began again, the
  sentences became less staccato, even the words seemed drawn from a different
  vocabulary. 'As I said, the Mansfields are decent people. That, at the
  outset, was an obstacle. But in the end&mdash;and owing, largely, if you must
  know the truth, to a certain skill I have always had in presenting a point of
  view&mdash;they agreed to behave magnanimously. They will not prosecute. You
  have nothing to worry about. And&mdash;incidentally&mdash; the girl isn't
  pregnant.'</p>

  <p>All Charles could then say was a muttered 'Oh God'&mdash;which he was glad
  his father did not hear because it represented a personal emotion which he
  did not want to explain or even to analyse. He then went to the window and
  stared out; men were still loitering in the court on their way from chapel.
  What a wonderful last morning of one's college career! he thought bitterly.
  He swung round and broke the silence that his father had made intolerable by
  his merely watching presence. 'Where is she? Where is she now?'</p>

  <p>'They've sent her to stay with some relatives in the country.'</p>

  <p>'I MUST see her.'</p>

  <p>'I don't think you can.'</p>

  <p>'But... dammit... as you yourself said, she's not a cheap little tart. I'd
  have married her... I WANT to marry her. Don't you realize that?'</p>

  <p>'I'm sure you feel the Mansfields ought to jump at such a thing, but
  believe me, they don't. It speaks well for them, Charles. Many a respectable
  family would have regarded that as quite legitimate blackmail.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not concerned with what they regard. It's what I want&mdash;and what
  Lily wants.'</p>

  <p>'What a girl of seventeen wants isn't&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'SEVENTEEN?'</p>

  <p>'Oh? Didn't she tell you that?'</p>

  <p>Charles replied absently, as if the matter were already unimportant: 'She
  said eighteen.'</p>

  <p>'In court I should point out that we have only your word for that. But of
  course I believe you, and I've no doubt the girl herself would confirm the
  deception.'</p>

  <p>'Good God, it isn't much of a deception. It's nothing. A year.'</p>

  <p>Havelock laughed in a way which, Charles reflected, would give a fine
  impression beyond the double doors that the two of them were having a very
  jolly time together. 'You know why I find that funny, Charles? Because you
  said a year is nothing. A year is just about what I could have got you off
  with!'</p>

  <p>So it WAS funny, maybe. But hardly jolly. Charles felt ill, and of all
  things in the world the one he least desired was to travel in a car with his
  father across several counties and finally arrive at Beeching. Yet that,
  quite clearly, was all he could do. So he went to his bedroom and began
  packing the last few things in a suitcase.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">They didn't talk much during the journey, but Havelock
remained in
  excellent humour. Not only must there be pleasure in having saved a son from
  ruin, but fatherly intervention had awakened old techniques, had unsheathed
  rusty swords from mildewed scabbards. They stopped for lunch at Banbury, and
  Havelock then mentioned Charles's approaching twenty-first birthday. He could
  not have chosen a worse time for evoking any warm response, and this may have
  been why he chose it, for he brought up the matter of the big party for
  tenants that landowners traditionally gave when their sons came of age.
  Havelock had done this for Lindsay, but now it was clear he didn't want to do
  it for Charles. Charles didn't mind a bit (he would have found such
  festivities irksome at the best of times), but he could only marvel at his
  father's astuteness in breaking the news just then. He said: 'Really, father,
  it suits me not to have the thing. So far as I'm concerned everybody can
  forget the birthday.'</p>

  <p>'Oh dear no, not at all. I had thought of a jaunt to town, perhaps&mdash;
  just the two of us. We never have had that, have we? Dinner at my club and
  then perhaps a theatre.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, let's decide later.'</p>

  <p>'I thought I'd mention it, though, to stake out my claim before you plan
  anything else.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not planning. I can't make plans. I don't know what I'm going to do.
  Everything seems uncertain. How can it be otherwise just now?'</p>

  <p>'You mean that your future depends a great deal on the results of the
  Tripos Examination?'</p>

  <p>'God, no, I wasn't even thinking of that&mdash;but of course it's true.
  And I may as well tell you, I haven't done well. In fact I've done damn
  badly. Maybe I haven't even passed&mdash;and I don't care. I want some
  happiness in life. I don't see why it all has to be broken. I don't see
  &mdash;I can't&mdash;I&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He became speechless and incoherent, breaking down a little, and his
  father summoned an old and rather decrepit waiter who presided over the hotel
  dining-room. 'My son is ill,' he said. 'Would you kindly help me to take him
  to my car?'</p>

  <p>Charles soon pulled himself together at that. 'I don't need any help,' he
  said roughly. 'I'm all right. I can walk&mdash;there's nothing the matter
  with me.' But the old waiter had taken his arm by that time and Charles did
  not want to push him aside and perhaps off his feet, so before he properly
  knew what was happening he was taking part in a spectacle that moved slowly
  through the dining-room and across the hotel lobby and down the steps to the
  car, in front of the curious stares of a score or more onlookers. Probably
  they thought he was drunk. He reflected afterwards that his father must have
  staged it suddenly and for a mere whim before such an utterly random
  audience, since nobody in Banbury knew them and they were unlikely to stop
  there again.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Charles was ill at Beeching for several weeks, of no
ailment that the
  local doctor could diagnose, and with no particular symptoms except a high
  temperature. But it was easy for Doctor Somerville to ascribe the trouble to
  recent overstudy, and to recommend rest and a holiday as the only but a very
  certain cure. Havelock was sympathetic and talked of a European trip if
  Charles would enjoy it later in the summer. Or perhaps he would rather stay
  at Beeching and do nothing except paint whenever he had the mood. But to
  Charles the thought of painting was a signal for despair, and the first day
  he got up after being in bed he collected all his paraphernalia&mdash; easel,
  brushes, paints and finished canvases&mdash;and packed them in an old trunk
  in the loft over the stables.</p>

  <p>Only one positive decision had emerged from the confusion of notions and
  emotions that had sent his temperature to fever height, and that was to visit
  Ladysmith Road. He had sent several letters there, addressed to Lily, and had
  not been surprised when they were unanswered. He knew that a personal visit
  might be just as fruitless, the Mansfields might refuse to admit him or
  discuss anything, there might be an unpleasant scene, they might even call
  the police (though knowing their respectabilities he did not really think
  there was much risk of this); but whatever happened or did not happen, some
  points would be elucidated, or at least removed from the sphere of total
  doubt. One of these questions was how far, if at all, his father's story was
  untrue or exaggerated. He did not expect to find much discrepancy,
  nevertheless the visit to Ladysmith Road became somehow obligatory in his
  mind, a scène à faire that had to be acted out.</p>

  <p>One day he went up to London without telling his father, leaving merely a
  message with Cobb that he might be back late that evening or the next day. On
  arrival at Paddington he made a routine test by telephoning the Kingsway
  office; a girl's voice answered that Miss Mansfield was no longer working
  there. This again was no astonishment. He next called in person and asked to
  see somebody named Ethel. Ethel, it seemed, had gone to lunch at the Lyons
  teashop near the British Museum where he had first set eyes on Lily. He was
  told to ask the girl at the cashier's desk to point out Ethel to him, and all
  this procedure, which normally he would have found devious and embarrassing,
  he went through in sombre misery that was aware of nothing but itself. Ethel
  was hostile; she would tell him nothing (perhaps she did not know much), but
  it was clear she held him responsible for at least the interruption of a
  friendship. After a few moments Charles left her and wandered vaguely through
  the streets till he found himself in Lincoln's Inn Fields. He sat down on a
  bench and tried to think of a way to get the afternoon over. He did not think
  he could concentrate on a film, still less on a revisiting of any of the
  places he had been to with Lily (and these had included practically
  everything in the guide-book), so he took an early train to Linstead and
  spent the intervening hours in that suburb. He knew it was no use calling on
  Mr. Mansfield before seven, by which time he would have finished his evening
  meal. Oddly, perhaps, Charles had seen little of Linstead with Lily. Except
  for the walk from the station to Ladysmith Road, less than half a mile and by
  an unchanging route, they had never made it a background of adventure or
  experience; they had always been hurrying somewhere else or home again
  afterwards. Yet Charles knew that Lily liked the place, and had shown pride
  in it on that first occasion he had gone there with her; but, as was her
  nature, she had let the matter drop when she found in him no special
  response. So now he walked about Linstead streets as if by so doing he could
  commune with something that had shared with him Lily's affections. It did not
  work out very well. He still found Linstead dull and featureless, its long
  roads of bay-windowed houses infinitely depressing. And yet, he realized,
  there were streets of Regency houses in the better parts of London almost as
  long and as uniform, and those houses too had been put up by speculative
  builders at a time of boom and with no aim but profit. So where, then, lay
  the difference that made the one style so much less deplorable than the
  other? The answer, which was only the beginning of other questions, gave his
  mind a focus for a while; but soon he was in dim perspectives again,
  wondering if and how he could trace a thin line of happiness for himself on
  the blind face of the future. Towards evening he entered a restaurant in the
  High Road near the station. He wasn't hungry but he wanted a cup of coffee. A
  first-floor window offered a view of trains that arrived every few minutes
  from London; he saw the countless doors open before the trains came to a halt
  and the crowd spill out like burst liquid, then shape into a stream,
  thickening and congesting as it reached the station exit; but once beyond
  this bottleneck the mass suddenly unliquefied&mdash;human beings with
  separate aims dispersing in every direction. Charles watched till after six;
  then he picked up his bill and left. On the way out to the cash desk he
  passed a big mirror and saw himself like any other fellow walking across a
  restaurant with his hand in his pocket feeling for change; he wondered what
  he would think of himself as a stranger met thus for the first time. Medium
  height, brown hair and eyes, no distinguishing marks&mdash;the passport
  specifications came easily. Or would it be no marks of distinction? Just a
  tired look and a worried face. But not even that; he did not think the
  stranger in the mirror looked more than averagely bothered about anything. A
  man he passed in the street outside had an air of far greater harassment, and
  Charles watched him for a few seconds, saw him buy an evening paper and turn
  to the stop-press column that gave the racing results. Charles smiled to
  himself; the incident was calming. People, it would seem, were apt to be
  neither as happy nor as unhappy as they looked; and he was one of them. The
  anonymity of being anybody nudged his mind with the first touch of
  philosophic comfort he had been able to muster. The world's end was a long
  way off, further even than Ladysmith Road. But then, thinking this, there
  came to him an echo from a forgotten source&mdash;something he had read
  somewhere, he wished he could remember where&mdash;'It is not many miles to
  Mantua, no further than the end of this mad world'.</p>

  <p>He reached Number 214 about a quarter-past seven and rang the doorbell. He
  was not very nervous. The afternoon in Linstead, walking about and thinking
  things over, had been helpful. He saw the familiar lace curtains in the
  bay-window and noticed the centre one draped to enshroud a plant that was new
  there&mdash;an exotic fleshy-leaved thing, bigger than the much derided
  aspidistra. Probably Mr. Mansfield's latest pride. Somehow this evidence, if
  it were such, that Mr. Mansfield was still functioning in his beloved world
  of horticulture gave Charles another nudge of comfort. A nice job, being a
  park-keeper&mdash;and if one wanted to make a play on words rather than
  realities, what had generations of Andersons been if not park-keepers, since
  Beeching was called Beeching Park on old maps? The idea beguiled him&mdash;
  Havelock and Mr. Mansfield in a park together. But it was thus with so many
  words&mdash;LOVE, for instance, a perfect catch-all of meaning, since one
  could use it about anything from God to goulash; and yet so clinchingly
  compared with LIKE, because one never spoke of 'falling in liking' with
  anybody, and also because one often said one 'rather liked' somebody, whereas
  nobody ever 'rather loved'. For instance, he rather liked Mr. Mansfield...
  And so his thoughts rambled on till he heard footsteps approaching along the
  hall. He knew then he was in luck&mdash;not only because someone was at home,
  but the footsteps were surely those of the one he rather liked. The door
  opened. Yes, indeed. Mr. Mansfield was in gardening boots and an old jacket,
  and carried a large earthenware flowerpot which he had apparently been too
  absentminded to set down anywhere. Naturally he was more taken aback than
  Charles, though the latter had to scrap all his rehearsed conversational
  openings when Mr. Mansfield suddenly dropped the flowerpot. It shattered on
  the floor of the lobby. Charles had prefigured just about every possibility
  but this. He crossed the threshold without invitation and stooped to gather
  the fragments into a heap.</p>

  <p>'Butterfingers!' exclaimed Mr. Mansfield, gasping a word that Charles had
  never expected to be the first one spoken between them. 'But you give me a
  turn, Charlie, that's wot you did&mdash;you really give me a turn. You was
  the larst person I'd 'ave thought&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I'm terribly sorry,' Charles interrupted. 'Perhaps I should have let you
  know, but&mdash;here, let me tidy this up.'</p>

  <p>'No, it's all right.' Mr. Mansfield was fast recovering, and with recovery
  came a mounting resentment. 'Look 'ere now, I dunno wot you've come for
  &mdash;Lily ain't 'ere now, your dad must 'ave told you that. I really dunno
  wot you want, unless it's to mike trouble, and I tell you, I ain't goin' to
  'ave no trouble. See?'</p>

  <p>But having delivered that, his protest and his credo, he was clearly at a
  loss to continue. He let Charles open the door of the parlour and followed
  him meekly inside. Then with his own big hands, but carefully wiping the
  garden dirt off them before he touched the knob, he closed the door. He
  looked sheerly incongruous with his old clothes and gardening boots in this
  small spotless room packed with furniture and ornaments. But at least,
  Charles reflected, he seemed already to have exhausted his anger.</p>

  <p>Charles said, breathlessly improvising: 'Mr. Mansfield, I've not come here
  to make trouble at all. I don't want it any more than you do. My father, as
  you say, told me more or less what happened, but I felt I had to see you for
  confirmation before I could take all of it in...'</p>

  <p>'It ain't a bit of good,' Mr. Mansfield interposed. 'She ain't 'ere and
  you ain't goin' to see 'er. I give my word and I mean it.'</p>

  <p>'You mean you give me your word now or you gave it to my father?'</p>

  <p>'I give my word, that's all. I just give my word.' And then abruptly: 'I
  believe that front door's left open. Mind if I see?'</p>

  <p>And so it was, the front door left wide open, as people never left their
  front doors open in Ladysmith Road; amidst the excitement of their meeting
  and the smashed flowerpot neither of them had thought to close it. Mr.
  Mansfield went out to the lobby and did so, while Charles was aware of a
  quality he knew and loved in Lily, a gentleness, a humility, an almost
  foolish sweetness that would make Mr. Mansfield ask an unwelcome visitor if
  he might close the door of his own house.</p>

  <p>When Mr. Mansfield returned to the parlour Charles abandoned all his
  mentally rehearsed speeches to resume eagerly: 'Let me tell you this before
  we go any further. I love Lily and I want to marry her. And if I'd known
  there'd be all this upset I'd never have...' But then he stopped. What would
  he never have done? Did he mean merely that had he known Reg Robinson would
  be motorcycling anywhere near the Swan, he would have found another town and
  another hotel? This, even if true, was hardly worth saying; but was it the
  whole truth anyhow? Could there not be regrets that did not imply apology or
  confession&mdash;regrets for the grinding of memory into the sawdust of
  shabby outcome? But Charles could not hope to explain this question, still
  less expect an answer; and therefore he did not know how to finish his
  sentence. He broke off simply, without floundering, content with the silence
  that followed. Then, as if it had been the most natural enquiry of a friend,
  he said: 'She's all right, I suppose?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Mansfield replied in the same key and seemed relieved to do so. 'She's
  with the wife in the country. I give my word I wouldn't say where, but it's a
  nice place. She'll stay there awhile. She ain't come to no 'arm, in a manner
  of speakin'. Oh, she's all right&mdash;right as rain&mdash;she's at the 'ouse
  of the wife's sister and 'er 'usband. 'Er 'olidays was due, anyway. The
  others are on their 'olidays too.'</p>

  <p>'Leaving you all by yourself?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Mansfield nodded, a crease of humour rounding the edge of his
  nostrils. 'To tell the truth I ain't sorry. Gives me a chance to do a bit
  extra in the garden.'</p>

  <p>'I was admiring this plant as I came in. New, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'Ficus elastica. From Brazil. Fancy you noticin' it. Grows out of doors as
  a rule, but I brought it 'ome to see wot 'appened. Sometimes they like a
  change. Bin a good year for most things. I got a fine show of roses out in
  the back.' He paused as if meditating an invitation and then thinking better
  of it. 'I was just goin' out to water 'em when you come.'</p>

  <p>'I'm interrupting you, I'm afraid.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, they can wait. Matter of fact, if you don't mind, I'll take off these
  old boots. Dunno wot the wife would say if she saw me in 'ere with 'em on...
  Be back in a minute.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Mansfield then went out and Charles heard him climb the stairs to the
  floor above&mdash;the room above also, for after a few seconds the ceiling
  shook to heavy footfalls and some glass beads in the lampshade began to
  tinkle. Charles had nothing to do but look about him, remembering the only
  time he had been in the room before and Reg's terrific handshake received
  over there by the piano. Pictures and photographs crowded the walls, there
  was an old-fashioned overmantel above the fireplace, and a centre table
  covered what would otherwise have been the only completely visible square
  yard of carpet. Pride of place was given to a modern radio-gramophone of
  exactly the same model as the one at Beeching. Sir Havelock had not been keen
  enough on music to equip his house with anything de luxe; whereas the
  Mansfields must have made sacrifices to buy such a relatively expensive
  machine. So the two families could meet, as it were, on the social level of
  mass-produced entertainment. And for that matter, Charles reflected, if one
  were to go round with the eye of an artist there was just as much junk in the
  Beeching drawing-room.</p>

  <p>Presently footsteps descended the stairs and Mr. Mansfield re-entered. He
  had changed not only his boots but his clothes, and Charles thought he must
  also have brushed his hair and given himself a general spruce-up.</p>

  <p>'Well, I wasn't long, was I?... Dunno 'ow you feel, but it seems to me
  &mdash;if you ain't in a 'urry... always quiet there this time of an
  evenin'...'</p>

  <p>'Why, yes,' said Charles. 'A good idea.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">They talked mostly about gardening as they walked the short
distance to
  the Prince Rupert, and Charles did not press the conversation to any more
  serious issue. He could bide his time, and he judged that after a drink or so
  Mr. Mansfield might be more communicative. Charles had learned very little so
  far, except that Lily's father had given a promise to his; he felt he must
  know more about this, where and how it had happened; it was the atmosphere he
  wanted to explore almost more than the territory.</p>

  <p>Then, during that first moment at the bar of the Prince Rupert, something
  happened that told him so much of everything that all else was merely a
  filling-in of detail. Charles had been the first to say 'What's yours, Mr.
  Mansfield?' and Mr. Mansfield had replied: 'Bitter for me, Charlie.' There
  was nobody else in the bar, not even the barmaid; soon, however, a buxom
  woman who was evidently the landlady came up and greeted Mr. Mansfield as an
  old and favourite customer. 'Two bitters,' said Charles, but before she could
  serve them Mr. Mansfield cleared his throat to proclaim with great solemnity:
  'Mrs. Webber, I want you to meet Mr. Anderson.' Mrs. Webber smiled and
  Charles shook hands with her across the counter. She had the air of being a
  great lady. Mr. Mansfield continued: 'This Mr. Anderson's the son of Sir
  'Avelock Anderson who was with me 'ere the other evening&mdash;you remember
  Sir 'Avelock, Mrs. Webber?'</p>

  <p>'My goodness, I should say I do! We were so glad to meet Sir Havelock.'
  And then to Charles: 'What a wonderful man your father is! The stories he
  told! I really do believe he enjoyed himself here, don't you, Mr.
  Mansfield?'</p>

  <p>Charles could believe it also. Over their drinks Mr. Mansfield was not in
  the least unwilling to talk of an event that had evidently added so much to
  his local prestige. Havelock, it seemed, had in the first place received a
  letter from Mr. Mansfield. 'Mind you, it was Reg that wrote it&mdash;Reg said
  your dad ought to know. And then your dad came to see us as soon as 'e got
  the letter. We was 'avin' supper but 'e'd 'ad 'is so the wife made 'im a cup
  of tea and we all talked it over.'</p>

  <p>'ALL?'</p>

  <p>'Well, not Bert and Maud and Evelyn&mdash;they was away on their 'olidays,
  like I said. But Reg was there.'</p>

  <p>'And Lily?'</p>

  <p>'She come in during the middle of it. She'd just bin round the corner to
  get some needles.'</p>

  <p>'Some WHAT?'</p>

  <p>'Needles. For the gramophone. Reg brought over a lot of new records and we
  was all goin' to 'ear 'em after supper.' Mr. Mansfield took in Charles's
  glance and slowly interpreted it. 'Oh, we was all on good terms by then
  &mdash;we'd 'ad it out with 'er. No good 'angin' on to trouble, I always
  says, or it'll 'ang on to you... Besides, we couldn't blame it all on the
  girl. She didn't orter 'ave done what she did, but 'oos fault was it
  really?'</p>

  <p>Charles shook his head, not in either reluctance or inability to answer
  the question, but because his mind was boggling at the picture of his father
  sitting at the table in the living-room at Ladysmith Road, drinking a cup of
  tea and 'talking it over' with the Mansfields and Reg, then Lily entering the
  domestic circle with a supply of gramophone needles...</p>

  <p>Mr. Mansfield took advantage of the silence to catch Mrs. Webber's eye and
  signal for two more bitters. He continued: 'I'll tell you, Charlie&mdash; and
  once said we won't say no more&mdash;it was YOUR fault, because you wasn't a
  gentleman. I thought you was, and I was wrong. I didn't know 'OO you was,
  mind you, but I did think you was a gentleman. That time after we first met
  in the street I said to Lily when she got 'ome... Lily, I said, 'e's a
  gentleman. Because I did think you was.'</p>

  <p>Charles could only pick up a single point of this indictment. He said
  weakly: 'I don't quite know what you mean when you say you didn't know WHO I
  was... Lily introduced us.'</p>

  <p>'Wot I mean is, you never told Lily about your dad bein' a Sir. It was Reg
  found that out. You never told nobody.'</p>

  <p>Charles agreed that he hadn't. 'I didn't think of it&mdash;or maybe when I
  did I thought it would sound boastful. Anyhow, to get back to what happened,
  my father came to see you and had a talk with you all, and then... then
  what?'</p>

  <p>'That's all. We just talked and I brought 'im 'ere and 'im and me 'ad
  another talk, man to man. A real gentleman, your dad is, that I will
  say.'</p>

  <p>'What did Lily think of him?'</p>

  <p>'She liked 'im. Who could 'elp it? Of course 'e was upset, but then
  afterwards 'e got friendly same as if 'e'd known us all for years.'</p>

  <p>'He was upset?'</p>

  <p>'An' why shouldn't 'e be? 'E 'adn't bin told any more than we 'ad. 'E
  didn't even know you knew Lily. It was a shock to 'im, the way it would be to
  any father. 'E 'as 'is 'opes on you, Charlie. An' all the time 'e thought you
  was studyin' at college you was carryin' on with a gel 'e never knew about.
  Natchrally 'e was upset... Mind you, that was at first, at the 'ouse.
  Afterwards when 'im and me came 'ere we 'ad quite a lively time, like Mrs.
  Webber was sayin'.'</p>

  <p>'Tell me&mdash;tell me just this&mdash;did you ever, during the talk you
  had&mdash;threaten&mdash;or say anything to him&mdash;about bringing a charge
  against me?'</p>

  <p>'A CHARGE?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Mansfield's stare was so bewildered that Charles knew it was the
  completest possible answer in itself. But he felt driven to continue: 'A
  charge in a police court&mdash;a charge of...' But he somehow could not bring
  himself to speak the word 'abduction'.</p>

  <p>'Gawd, no, I never said nothin' about that,' Mr. Mansfield answered
  glumly, as if it were a mystery that must remain one or spoil his evening.
  Charles was devoutly glad that an interruption enabled them both to drop the
  matter at exactly that moment. For the door of the bar had opened and a voice
  was shouting: 'Wotcher, Freddy&mdash;and 'ow's Freddy?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Mansfield swung round, happily diverted. 'Well, if it ain't old
  'Arry!... 'Arry, this is Mr. Anderson&mdash;you remember Sir 'Avelock
  Anderson 'oo I came 'ere with the other night? This is Sir 'Avelock's son...
  Charlie... Mr. Byfield.'</p>

  <p>Harry Byfield, an excited little tub of a man with waxed moustaches,
  gripped Charles's hand and held it while he bestowed a beam of over-acted
  recognition. 'My goodness, and don't 'e look like 'is dad too! Same eyes,
  same nose... Charlie, what're you 'avin'?... Three bitters, Mrs. Webber, and
  'ow's Mrs. Webber?'</p>

  <p>Charles, who had never thought he looked much like his father at all,
  found this rather disconcerting. But it was a sample of what went on all the
  evening, with customer after customer. What an audience his father must have
  had, he reflected, and after so many bitters and in spite of his own personal
  troubles, he could not help feeling slightly amused.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The bar filled up as the evening progressed, and the very
crowding of it
  enabled Charles occasionally to get Mr. Mansfield alone. Then he put
  questions that seemed all the more urgent because he had either to shout them
  at normal speaking range or else whisper them loudly in Mr. Mansfield's ear.
  Whenever possible he did the latter. Nobody was listening or trying to, and
  there could not perhaps have been any place safer for the discussion of
  utterly private matters.</p>

  <p>'Tell me about Lily,' he kept saying more insistently as the drinks
  affected him. 'Tell me about her. You say she's all right&mdash;but is she
  happy?'</p>

  <p>'Well, now, you know Lily,' Mr. Mansfield temporized. 'She ain't wot you
  might call an un'appy gel by nature. She was upset, like we all was, but you
  don't 'ave to worry. She'll get over it.'</p>

  <p>Charles was more worried that she might than that she mightn't. And then
  through the undulating lens of alcohol, he saw Lily as incomparably fair and
  lovely, beckoning to him from some distant land where she would be happy
  anyway, with him if he joined her or without him if he didn't. Yes, he knew
  Lily. She liked people. She LOVED people. She loved EVERYBODY. She loved her
  father and mother and Bert and Evelyn and Maud. She loved Reg. She loved Mr.
  Graybar and Ethel and the busker outside the theatre who had stuck his cap
  through the window of their taxi. She loved Weigall and Peters. She even
  loved his father. It was easy for her to do all she could to please all these
  people because she loved them all. And for the same reason it had been easy
  for her to do anything she could to please him, Charles. Why, she even loved
  places too. She loved Linstead. She loved Cambridge. And she would doubtless
  love that nice place in the country whose whereabouts Mr. Mansfield would not
  disclose.</p>

  <p>'But surely we can write to each other,' Charles pleaded. 'If I send a
  letter won't you forward it?'</p>

  <p>'I give my word I wouldn't, Charlie.'</p>

  <p>'But what if she writes to me? Can't I answer? You can't stop her from
  writing.'</p>

  <p>'Well, now, Charlie, we was all 'opin' you'd understand.'</p>

  <p>'I'm damned if I do. I don't think you do either. Because&mdash;don't you
  realize?&mdash;I want to marry her. I asked her and she said she would if you
  consented. I'm twenty-one this month, so I don't need my father's consent
  after that.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Mansfield stroked his chin and was about to reply when someone pushed
  through the crowd and clapped him violently on the shoulder. There followed
  the inevitable greetings and introductions and respectful references to Sir
  'Avelock and another round of bitters; it was half an hour before Charles had
  a chance to repeat what he had said, though somewhat less coherently.</p>

  <p>So Mr. Mansfield stroked his chin again. 'Charlie, wot you say does you
  credit. Maybe you wasn't a gentleman that once, but you tike after your dad,
  like 'Arry Byfield said, and your dad's a gentleman if ever there was one.
  That's why I give 'im my word. It's right wot 'e said too. Lily's a nice gel,
  as nice a gel as a father could wish to 'ave, but she wouldn't be a 'elp to
  you, Charlie, not in your kind of life. Man to man, and speakin' as men of
  the world, your dad and I agreed about that. Not that I ain't just as proud
  of my own family, mind you&mdash;my great-granddad was in the Battle of
  Waterloo&mdash;we got a 'istory, too, the Mansfields 'ave. Only, as your dad
  said, with all your ejucation and the position you'll 'ave later on
  &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Oh, for God's sake,' Charles interrupted, 'will you let me tell you the
  plain truth? I'm not going to have the kind of future my father's planning
  for me. I've done so badly in my examinations I couldn't have it even if I
  wanted it.'</p>

  <p>'That's wot Lily said, and it upset 'er, thinkin' she was part
  responsible.'</p>

  <p>'Let me finish. There's no reason for anybody to be upset. When I'm
  twenty-one I shall have enough money and I'm going to live abroad and if Lily
  will marry me we can both be happy. Now then, will you consent?'</p>

  <p>'Charlie, it ain't a bit o' good you carryin' on about it. I give my word
  to your dad. You're too 'eadstrong, that's wot's the matter with you. But I
  tike back wot I said when I said you wasn't a gentleman...' Mr. Mansfield
  also was beginning to feel the effects of six or seven bitters. It was almost
  ten o'clock; the barman was already blinking lights and calling for the last
  reorders; Mrs. Webber and Milly were rolling up their sleeves for a final
  crescendo of service. 'Gawlummy, look at the time! Charlie, boy&mdash;one
  more, just to show there's no ill feelin'. And call me Fred... Easy now, mind
  them glarsses... Goo' night, 'Arry... Goo' night, Mr. Wilkinson... Two more,
  please, Mrs. Webber, when you've a minute... But wot I was sayin', Charlie,
  you're too 'eadstrong. She's only a gel yet, but like I said to the wife, a
  gel of sixteen can go around with an older feller, provided 'e's a gentleman,
  and that's wot I thought you was, Charlie.' Mr. Mansfield seemed to have some
  vague awareness that he had said that before and the memory troubled him in a
  wispy sort of way. His eyes were red and wet, but probably owing to the
  smoke.</p>

  <p>The bitters came. Charles raised his glass and saw past the brown liquid
  to something on the opposite wall that brought him to a jerk of attention
  &mdash;the picture of a pretty girl holding up a glass of beer just as he
  was, and the girl reminded him of Lily, and Lily reminded him of a word that
  Mr. Mansfield had just spoken about her.</p>

  <p>'Sixteen,' Charles muttered. 'You said SIXTEEN...'</p>

  <p>'Sixteen THEN&mdash;when you was first seein' 'er... Goo' night, Mr.
  Beale&mdash;remember me to Mrs. Beale... Goo' night, Scotty... Seventeen
  now&mdash;seventeen a week ago larst Sunday.'</p>

  <p>'She never told me.'</p>

  <p>'You never told 'er things neither. But I tike back wot I said, remember
  that.' Mr. Mansfield raised his own glass and for the first time that evening
  offered a toast. 'Well, Charlie... 'Ere's to us and our dear ones...'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Charles did not remember much of what happened during the
next few hours.
  He had an impression that they left the Prince Rupert together, but their
  conversation, if any, did not stay in his mind. Later he woke up in darkness
  with a terrific headache and an enormous confrontation of difficulties
  &mdash;physical difficulty in finding a light switch and, when he had found
  one and pressed it, mental difficulty in recognizing the scene and visual
  difficulty in facing any kind of illumination. At length he decided he had
  been asleep on the couch in the parlour at Ladysmith Road. He was fully
  dressed except for jacket and shoes, which were beside him.</p>

  <p>Feeling parched he fumbled his way to the kitchen sink. Along the lobby he
  could hear loud snores from upstairs. He drank several glasses of water and
  returned to the parlour to put on his shoes, but this was too much of an
  undertaking, so he leaned back on the couch. Doubtless more time passed,
  because when he looked again there was light beyond the Ficus elastica as
  well as dangling from the ceiling. He remembered then that Lily had said
  there were trains every hour throughout the night between Linstead and
  London. So it really didn't matter what time it was. This seemed an enormous
  boon as he laced his shoes and put on his coat. In the pocket he found a
  pencil and his Cambridge tailor's bill that had arrived at Beeching the
  previous morning; he hadn't opened it, but he did so now, merely to use the
  envelope. On the back of this he wrote: 'Dear Mr. Mansfield, Thanks, I'm all
  right. Best wishes, C.' He left the note on top of the radio-gramophone.</p>

  <p>As he went to the front door he could still hear snores from upstairs.
  They reminded him of something that sent him back to the parlour and the
  radio-gramophone. He crossed out 'Mr. Mansfield' and wrote 'Fred'.</p>

  <p>In the street the cool air, which he had hoped might be refreshing, merely
  invited a fuller onslaught of nausea. He had been drunk a few times before,
  but never like this. His last act in Ladysmith Road was to vomit,
  monumentally, into the gutter a few yards from the corner of the High Road.
  Then, with some relief, he was able to catch the 4.23 at Linstead station.
  From Liverpool Street, where he felt worse again after the train journey, he
  took a taxi to an all-night Turkish bath in a street near the Haymarket. But
  even after every ministration it could offer, including a long doze in the
  steam room, he still felt far from himself when he left it around noon. Or
  rather, he speculated, perhaps he did feel himself, and what he had felt
  before had never been himself at all. A rather grim change, as if he had
  grown out of something, but not yet into something else.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">During the next few days at Beeching Charles was able to
confirm that the
  change existed, though less grimly and no longer by any possibility the
  result of a hangover. For the first time he found himself meeting his father
  on territory where boundaries were recognized. He made no disclosures of his
  recent trip to Linstead and Havelock put no questions. Charles walked about
  the Beeching gardens feeling somehow adult and hard-bitten, and in a perverse
  kind of way relishing it. He wrote, for instance, to Brunon, who had a
  teaching job at Clermont-Ferrand; he asked what sort of place that was to
  live in. What he must wait for, of course, was his twenty-first birthday
  &mdash;the first step; but he gave his father no inkling of any special
  urgency. That would be revealed on the day he was of age for acts as well as
  words. Not that his planning was sensational&mdash;merely to step down
  finally from the educational ladder, without trying for any higher rung, and
  live abroad on his private income. It might not be heroic&mdash;private
  incomes rarely were&mdash;but he had no wish to be heroic. As for Lily in his
  scheme of things, he was, he knew, handicapped by her age; perhaps he would
  have to wait awhile&mdash;but surely not till she also was of age &mdash;that
  would be unthinkable. The whole matter was one he must explore, legally to
  begin with, then he would know where he stood. So far he had behaved like a
  youth; from now on he must do things with a man's determination and
  responsibility.</p>

  <p>Havelock was immensely genial during this period. After dinner father and
  son would usually sit in the library drinking port for an hour or so&mdash; a
  pose of eighteenth-century comeliness that well matched the house. But each
  was secretly measuring the other and aware of a trigonometry of distance
  between them. Often the conversation turned to Havelock's early triumphs in
  the law&mdash;he liked to recollect them and how he had outwitted this or
  that witness or an opposing counsel. Charles could picture his father wigged
  and gowned and pointing a playful finger over the courtroom&mdash;Prospero
  casting his spell till suddenly, the mask withdrawn, everything dissolved in
  Caliban fury. Charles had seen this happen in his dreams, but now, because he
  was no longer afraid, he did not banish it from his waking thoughts&mdash; he
  even welcomed it, with a slight burlesque of being impressed. He knew his
  father revelled in the high drama, but his own enjoyment was to snap the
  tensions by some light remark that Havelock could not relish, though it was
  never anything to which he could object. 'I'll bet you put on a show,' was
  the sort of thing Charles would comment, in half-derisive admiration. For
  Havelock was still putting on a show.</p>

  <p>The darkest moment came when he asked why Charles didn't paint any more
  &mdash;had he given it up after Charnock's verdict? Charles shrugged in
  answer, then said obscurely: 'You're the one to worry about verdicts, not
  me.' The truth was, he couldn't endure just then even the thought of
  painting, much less a discussion of it with his father. It belonged somehow
  to the part of him that was hurt, the part that could not be bitten hard
  enough to become hard-bitten.</p>

  <p>Sometimes comedy came unsought as when, for instance, Charles asked if
  there had ever been any reply to that letter Havelock had written to The
  Times about the honorary degree.</p>

  <p>Havelock seemed to have to ransack his memory for any recollection of the
  incident (he always found it easy to forget the foolish things he had done),
  but at length he replied: 'Oh yes, just one&mdash;but only from some crazy
  fellow.' Amiably he went to the bureau where he kept his papers and began a
  search. 'Some parson&mdash;if I can find it. Addressed to me personally, of
  course&mdash;he must have known it wouldn't do for The Times... Here it
  is.'</p>

  <p>Scribbled on embossed notepaper from a Yorkshire vicarage, it pointed out
  that the initial letters of 'Sagacity, Willpower, Integrity, Nobility,
  Experience' (which Havelock had offered as his own better translation of the
  Latin) could well supply a motto for the entire Coalition administration in
  its choice of appointees to government positions&mdash;a choice naturally
  dictated by such a leader as Lloyd George. The motto the parson suggested
  was: 'Scottish, Welsh, Irish, Never English.'</p>

  <p>'Now who would have thought of that?' Havelock mused. 'Of course the
  fellow must be off his head.'</p>

  <p>Charles began to laugh, and soon was laughing almost hysterically. The
  whole incident seemed to find its perfect end in a joke that was all the
  better because his father did not see it.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The twenty-first birthday fell on a Friday, so Charles and
his father went
  to London that morning, having planned a weekend that would include dinner at
  Havelock's club and an evening at the London Pavilion, where there was a good
  revue. They would stay a couple of nights at Claridge's and return on Sunday
  morning. On the Sunday evening a few local guests would come to dinner at
  Beeching.</p>

  <p>Havelock's club was among the more exclusive, and it was hard for a young
  man just of age not to feel that admittance to it, as his father's honoured
  guest, symbolized something not to be lightly disregarded in the world's
  scheme of things. The fact that Charles was about to disregard it, and not
  lightly at all, made him feel rather serious as he sat in the deep library
  chair before dinner and drank an almost sacramental sherry. The superbly
  proportioned room with its high ceiling and near-great portraits and vistas
  of wine-red carpet&mdash;all were alchemy to the soul; it was a very
  wonderful life, doubtless, for those who were rich and important and well
  content to be both. A far cry from Ladysmith Road, and nearly as far from
  living at Clermont-Ferrand on three hundred a year (for Brunon had already
  replied that this was possible if one were content with a modest ménage). It
  only remained now for Charles to make the announcement, and because he would
  rather spoil an evening's entertainment than a good dinner he had decided to
  bring the matter up while they were drinking coffee in the library
  afterwards. There would only be a short time then before having to leave for
  the theatre, but Charles did not see why the announcement should take
  long.</p>

  <p>The dinner was indeed good, though Havelock assured him it was just the
  ordinary club meal. 'But I'm glad I brought you here, Charles. I hope to put
  you up for membership one of these days, so it's appropriate we should choose
  it for our celebration. Incidentally, I believe this is the first time we've
  ever dined out together.' It was, not counting train dinners and times when
  they had both been guests of neighbours around Beeching. 'You may not realize
  it, Charles, but a father finds it hard to get to know his son, and therefore
  easy to postpone the effort. I hope we shall make that effort jointly&mdash;
  from now on.' He waited for some response, but Charles could not think of
  any. 'I'd like this to be the beginning of confidence between us. Don't think
  I shall be unsympathetic&mdash;even about Lily.'</p>

  <p>Charles flushed, resenting Havelock's use of the first name, as if there
  were in it some intolerable assertion of intimacy. Yet he could not help
  probing the matter by answering: 'Yes, you met her, didn't you?'</p>

  <p>'I did, and thought her charming&mdash;though of course utterly unsuited
  to you, apart from her age.'</p>

  <p>'You mean her Cockney accent&mdash;all that?'</p>

  <p>'Well, it would be no help, though she might manage to unlearn it&mdash;
  others have. Much more important is a lack in her of something you need,
  Charles&mdash;you especially. Even at her age one can tell she hasn't got
  it&mdash;a drive, a dynamism&mdash;a woman who will push you ahead, not just
  freewheel along in any mood you set for her.'</p>

  <p>Charles was surprised by his father's assessment of Lily; he had expected
  the class angle to count much more. He said: 'How about being happy? Doesn't
  that come into the scheme of what you think I need?'</p>

  <p>'No one should put happiness first, Charles. One doesn't die without it.
  From my own experience I can assure you of that.'</p>

  <p>'But wouldn't you have PREFERRED to be happy?'</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;if it could have come from achievement&mdash;from triumph. But
  not from mere BEING. Not just bliss. The Orientals believe in bliss
  &mdash;and look at them. Whereas, to take an opposite example, the Americans
  PURSUE happiness&mdash;it's the pursuit they stress, not the happiness
  itself. The phrase is even written into their Declaration of Independence
  &mdash;and look at THEM. They count.'</p>

  <p>'Because they've pursued happiness without finding it?'</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;rather than finding it and languishing with it.'</p>

  <p>'I don't much care for pursuing things. I suppose that's why I'm no good
  at games.'</p>

  <p>'But you haven't the blood in you to languish. Or if you have, I don't
  know where it comes from.'</p>

  <p>'From my mother, perhaps. I hope so.'</p>

  <p>'You mean you wish you were not my son?'</p>

  <p>'I don't think that follows... but haven't you wished it too&mdash;
  sometimes?'</p>

  <p>They faced each other, as near to the core of some central issue as they
  had ever been, and aware of it. At that moment, if the message in Havelock's
  eyes had persisted, Charles might have decided to leave Beeching and his
  father and never see either again. But it changed, and Havelock further eased
  the tension by a slow smile. 'I don't see any reason to bicker, Charles. I
  just wanted you to know I liked Lily.'</p>

  <p>'That's fine. I liked her too. In fact I still like her. And if I had the
  chance, now that I'm of age, I'd marry her. But you've seen to it that I
  haven't the chance.'</p>

  <p>'You can still have it if you want it enough.'</p>

  <p>'What do you mean?'</p>

  <p>'Didn't Mansfield tell you ANYTHING?'</p>

  <p>'He said nothing about...' Then Charles saw he had fallen into the oldest
  trap in the cross-examiner's repertoire. 'Oh, well,' he added, transferring
  some of his anger to himself, 'you evidently know it all, so what's the
  difference? Mansfield told me nothing except that he'd given you his word,
  he'd given you his word&mdash;he repeated that like a litany.'</p>

  <p>'Then he kept his word too. Quite a fellow.' Havelock paused. 'Share
  another bottle of claret?... No?... Just the ordinary claret they have here,
  but not bad, I think... Sure you won't?... Charles, let me be frank about all
  this. No father nowadays can put a final veto on a son's marriage&mdash;and
  that's as it should be. But when the girl's still so young&mdash;younger than
  you ever thought she was, younger than she told you she was... surely there's
  a case for delay&mdash;or at least no need for any special hurry? Mansfield
  and I agreed that if, at the end of a year, you and Lily both wished, you
  could begin meeting again... and later still&mdash;say in eighteen months or
  two years&mdash;and she'd only be nineteen then, remember&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'And in the meantime?'</p>

  <p>'No meetings&mdash;no letters, communications of any kind&mdash;for a
  year&mdash;on either side.'</p>

  <p>'And what did SHE say to that?'</p>

  <p>'Very little, as I remember. She didn't make a scene, though. Bless
  her.'</p>

  <p>'But she agreed to the separation?'</p>

  <p>'In all fairness, Charles, I must point out there was nothing else she
  could do. After all, a father does have some control over a
  seventeen-year-old&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Did she know it was only to be for a year?'</p>

  <p>'We didn't go into that with her. I didn't intend to with you, either, but
  I was tempted just now&mdash;I wanted to make your birthday a more cheerful
  one. Don't be distressed. If, after a year, as I said&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I know what YOU said&mdash;what I want to know is what SHE said. What
  were the words she used? How did she take it? I can't believe&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'As I told you before, she was perfectly charming&mdash;both to her father
  and me. Other girls might have been sulky or hysterical or hostile
  &mdash;instead of which&mdash;well, I couldn't help admiring her attitude.
  And perhaps in her heart she felt the reasonableness of ours.'</p>

  <p>'Damn the reasonableness.'</p>

  <p>'A year isn't much, Charles. You once said that yourself.'</p>

  <p>Charles remembered and it made him bitter. 'Yes, I suppose as a test of
  true love it's romantic as well as reasonable.'</p>

  <p>'I've weakened it, though, by letting you know it exists. I've given you
  that much advantage.'</p>

  <p>'Like throwing a dog a small bone.'</p>

  <p>'No... like revising&mdash;slightly&mdash;the handicap in a race.'</p>

  <p>'To make it more exciting for the spectator.'</p>

  <p>Havelock chuckled. 'Your brain works rather well when you're excited.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not excited&mdash;not in the way you are, anyhow. And whether it's a
  week or a month or a year, as far as I'm concerned, I promise nothing, I've
  agreed to nothing. Let's end the argument on that.'</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;gladly. I was equally glad to end my argument with Mansfield,
  in which&mdash;I think you tend to overlook this&mdash;I really succeeded in
  getting you out of serious trouble... Tell me, incidentally&mdash;this isn't
  arguing, I'm just curious&mdash;what would be your rating of Mansfield?'</p>

  <p>'Rating? I don't know that I rate people at all. I thought him decent and
  honest, simple and&mdash;and&mdash;in a sort of way&mdash;sweet. Like a good
  apple. I'd trust him. He'd keep his word&mdash;even if he ought never to have
  given it.'</p>

  <p>'So it puzzles you a little&mdash;why he did give it?'</p>

  <p>'Not when I think of you in action against him. You have a persuasive
  manner.'</p>

  <p>'And you think that was all? I'm really flattered, Charles.' Havelock
  poured himself more claret and again Charles saw, as in his dreams, the pose
  of one about to strike, even at the risk of unwisdom; grim glee infesting the
  eyes, a euphoria that ran riot in the bloodstream, so that the cheeks
  reddened and shone with what, in an athlete, would have suited the moment of
  passing the tape or vaulting the bar. 'Charles, my experience in the courts
  taught me many things. One of them is the meaning of the word "corruptible".
  It means "more corruptible than the person using the word". Take plain
  bribery, for instance. With some people&mdash;those we call honest&mdash; a
  bribe has first to be explained as something else&mdash;something reasonable
  and fair and legitimate. Then cupidity must be aroused&mdash;a universal
  attribute&mdash;after which the payment offered must be large enough to
  administer a slight shock, so that the honest payee will wonder if it IS a
  bribe, and&mdash;out of a mixture of doubt and guilt and gratitude
  &mdash;will wish to treat the payer with the utmost fidelity. It's a very
  interesting process.'</p>

  <p>He paused, aware that he was losing Charles's attention, then retrieved it
  by a fast grab. 'How do the Mansfields come into all this? I'll tell you.
  They're quite hard pressed financially&mdash;buying their house through a
  building society and a radio-gramophone on the instalment plan&mdash;all that
  sort of thing. He has steady employment, but poorly paid&mdash;only about
  five pounds a week, so the three girls and the boy have to help to support
  the family from their own small earnings. Clearly, then, Lily couldn't give
  up her job and live in the country for a year at their expense... so the fair
  thing to do was quite obvious. But&mdash;and this really IS the point at
  last&mdash;how much do you think it costs a girl to live with her relatives
  in the country for a year?'</p>

  <p>Havelock took out his wallet and pushed a folded paper across the table to
  Charles. It was a cancelled cheque made out to and endorsed by Frederick
  Mansfield for two thousand pounds.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Charles felt rather sick. 'All right... so you pulled it
off. You've been
  clever, I admit that. It's an odd thing to prove to me on the day I'm
  supposed to become a man&mdash;that life's full of wormholes and that you
  know how to find them... never mind, though, I'll admit that also. But now
  I've got a disillusionment for you. This career of mine you talk of&mdash;
  this career&mdash;this&mdash;this...'</p>

  <p>His eyes were riveted by something else on the table before him. It was a
  telegram, addressed to Charles at Beeching, from his college tutor.</p>

  <p class="telegram"><tt>HEARTIEST CONGRATULATIONS ON OBTAINING NOT ONLY FIRST
  IN TRIPOS BUT YOUR THESIS ALSO CONSIDERED SO GOOD STRONGLY RECOMMEND
  SUBMISSION FOR THE COURTENAY PRIZE...</tt></p>

  <p>'It came yesterday,' said Havelock. 'I took the liberty of holding it back
  for our celebration tonight... NOW will you have a little more claret? We
  shall be late for the theatre, but who cares?'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">PARIS II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Thirty-one years later Charles could sum up his early life
  as 'nothing to complain of without really wondering whether it had been or
  hadn't. He was much too pleased by his son's remark that he didn't look
  anything like his age; and for a second he glanced in a mirror on the wall of
  the Cheval Noir that showed him trim and distingué in his dark suit. 'Do you
  really think, Gerald,' he asked, fishing for another compliment, 'I could
  safely allow a photograph of the author to be used as a frontispiece for my
  book?' He laughed, of course, so that his son should know it was partly a
  joke.</p>

  <p>'You bet you could,' Gerald answered, loyally. 'You're really very
  handsome. You look a bit like Ronald Colman.'</p>

  <p>'And WHO is Ronald Colman?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, come now, dad, you must know that.'</p>

  <p>'I will admit I do, but I find that a great impression can be made
  nowadays by claiming never to have heard of somebody.'</p>

  <p>Gerald grinned. 'You're pretty smart too.'</p>

  <p>'Am I&mdash;away from dinner parties and agreeable company? Sometimes
  lately I've begun to doubt it.' At a remark like that Palan stepped into
  Charles's mind like an unwanted guest who finds the door left open, and
  because he would otherwise have had to quell an almost unconquerable
  preoccupation Charles began to talk about Palan to Gerald, though of course
  without mentioning the name. 'You know, Gerald, this job I have isn't the
  kind of thing it used to be. You may think me snobbish&mdash;it's so easy to
  be thought that nowadays&mdash;but when I first started in diplomacy one
  could always assume that whatever the sort of fellow one was up against
  there'd be at least some things in common&mdash;a professional training, for
  instance, and a minimum code of manners. Your opponent might trick you, he
  might be dishonest or corrupt&mdash;my father used to say that everyone was
  corrupt to some extent&mdash;but you could count on him not yelling across
  the room like an auctioneer or belching after a heavy lunch... But I mustn't
  bore you&mdash;here's Henri, wondering what we're going to eat. Anything
  special you fancy, my boy? This is an occasion, remember.'</p>

  <p>Henri presented the menu, which Gerald studied for a moment before
  replying: 'My French isn't equal to it&mdash;maybe you'd better do the
  choosing.'</p>

  <p>Charles smiled. He had been prepared for this. 'How about soup to begin
  with? May I suggest tortue claire?'</p>

  <p>'Fine, whatever it is.'</p>

  <p>'Just turtle soup. And then perhaps sole Véronique&mdash;that's sole
  cooked in wine and served with a very delicate cream sauce and fresh
  grapes&mdash;and after that I can recommend Henri's way with a small
  chicken&mdash;poulet en casserole à la maison&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Gerald put down the menu and tried to catch Henri's eye with a knowing
  wink, but of course Henri did not respond. 'I wonder if I could just have a
  good thick steak after the soup.'</p>

  <p>'Certainly, M'sieu'.'</p>

  <p>Charles continued to smile; he had been prepared for this too. All he said
  was: 'One thing you never have to specify here, Gerald&mdash;everything
  always IS good... I think then a tournedos garni for Gerald, Henri, with
  those little potatoes and champignons. I'll have the sole.'</p>

  <p>Henri bowed. After he had left them Gerald said, still looking amused:
  'What first made you so interested in food, dad?'</p>

  <p>'To that question, Gerald, I had better quote an answer made by a titled
  Englishwoman to the Duchess of Marlborough&mdash;who, as perhaps you know,
  was a titled American. The Duchess was informed that considering it is the
  only pleasure one can count on having three times a day every day of one's
  life, a well ordered meal is of prime importance... Ben trovato, possibly.'
  Henri had approached with the wine list. 'A Chablis, Henri... Try a small
  glass, Gerald, after the soup.'</p>

  <p>'Okay.'</p>

  <p>'It's a very simple wine.'</p>

  <p>'I thought one ordered wines by the year.'</p>

  <p>Charles smiled again; it was a matter he liked to have brought up. 'Your
  millionaire junk merchant ALWAYS does&mdash;he learns a few words and dates
  like Liebfraumilch Forty-Seven and thinks it makes him a connoisseur. I
  myself would GENERALLY know the best years for a Burgundy or a champagne or a
  claret, but with a Chablis I leave everything to Henri, who was born quite
  close to the town of Chablis... isn't that so, Henri?'</p>

  <p>'At Auxerre, M'sieu',' said Henri, beaming.</p>

  <p>'Oh yes?' Gerald suddenly spoke up. 'I think I know of it.' He was
  evidently at pains to demonstrate that he wasn't an ignoramus in every field
  of knowledge. 'Didn't Clovis capture Auxerre from the Romans in the fifth
  century?'</p>

  <p>'I haven't the slightest idea,' answered Charles with keen delight, 'and I
  don't suppose Henri has either. So you put us both in our place. I took my
  degree in history, and I've never regretted doing so, though I expect I've
  forgotten ninety per cent of all I ever learned. One does, you know. But the
  other ten per cent, if well cared for, can stand one in pretty good stead...
  Thank you, Henri. Oh yes&mdash;and a small salade gauloise.' Henri bowed and
  left them again. 'I'm glad you're interested in history, Gerald. Perhaps
  it'll win you a Cambridge scholarship next year.'</p>

  <p>'I think I shall take Economics.'</p>

  <p>'Well, that includes a lot of history&mdash;and vice versa. I remember
  when I was at Cambridge I used to go to Pigou and Keynes&mdash;that was at
  the end of the war which we now call the FIRST World War, though it was
  Colonel Repington back in 1919 who originated the phrase and was well
  trounced for it.'</p>

  <p>'Did you enjoy Cambridge?'</p>

  <p>'Very much indeed. Of course I'm fortunate to have it associated in my
  mind with pleasant things&mdash;such as a First in the Tripos and the
  Courtenay Prize. I didn't like games and I was too shy in those days to take
  part in Union debates, but I think I can say that Cambridge gave me, if
  nothing else, a sense of kinship with tradition&mdash;of being privileged, if
  the metaphor isn't too fanciful, to touch the pulse of five centuries with
  the tip of one's little finger. I remember what a thrill I got when I found
  that a previous occupant of my college rooms had introduced the turnip from
  Holland in the late seventeenth century&mdash;thus becoming a benefactor of
  English agriculture though certainly not of the English dinner-table...
  Strange, though, when one looks back on early life, how it's the little
  incidents that stay in the mind. I remember once, while I was researching at
  the British Museum, being told that the desk I was working at had been used
  by Karl Marx when he was writing Das Kapital... I mentioned that to Palan the
  other day, by way of making conversation&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Who's Palan?'</p>

  <p>Charles had spoken the name without thinking, though now he had done so he
  felt it did not matter. 'One of my opponents at the Conference. A disciple of
  Marx, of course.'</p>

  <p>'I think I've seen pictures of him in the papers. Rather a jolly-looking
  fellow.'</p>

  <p>'He would certainly never forget to smile when being photographed.'</p>

  <p>'What did he say when you told him about the desk at the British
  Museum?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing. He just stopped picking his nose.'</p>

  <p>Gerald laughed. 'You've certainly got your knife into him all right.'</p>

  <p>'On the contrary, he has his into me. Mine's quite incapable of piercing
  such a hide. And yet, in an odd sort of way, I don't absolutely DISlike the
  fellow. It's hard to say why not. I have every reason to&mdash;personal,
  professional, and political. The other evening I was reading Montesquieu and
  I came across...' Charles stopped; he saw that Gerald had glanced covertly
  beneath the rim of the table at his wristwatch. The fact that the movement
  had been so carefully shielded, that the boy was clearly anxious not to hurt
  a father's feelings, gave Charles a needle-like twinge in the centre of his
  stomach. Was it possible that he was BORING Gerald? He continued hastily:
  'But don't let me run on like this. Tell me more about your adventures in
  Switzerland.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I'd like to, before I&mdash;I mean, while there's still time. I
  mustn't forget my train.'</p>

  <p>'When did you say it was?'</p>

  <p>'Er... ten-thirty...'</p>

  <p>'And from the Gare St. Lazare, I think you said. Leave here by ten and
  you'll be all right... You were telling me earlier that you did some
  climbing.'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes&mdash;and golf and tennis too. At Mürren they were having
  tournaments at the hotel and I entered&mdash;just to get a game actually
  &mdash;never thought I had a chance&mdash;but I won the mixed doubles
  &mdash;my partner was awfully good. It's a silver cup&mdash;I've got it in my
  bag&mdash;like me to show you?'</p>

  <p>Even had Charles been interested in games he would not have cared to
  interrupt a dinner in such a way. He smiled tolerantly and answered: 'Oh,
  don't bother now&mdash;I'll see it when we're at home. But I'm very glad you
  were able to get the kind of holiday you enjoy. So many people&mdash;
  diplomats, for instance&mdash;have to enjoy the kind they get. When I think
  of all the time I've spent at horrible little resorts that happened to be the
  only places where the Legation staff could go to escape the heat, or
  dysentery, or some national holiday that was sure to be marked by
  anti-British demonstrations in the capital&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You can put all THAT into your book, anyway.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, certainly. And I shall. There was a place near Constanza, on the
  Black Sea...'</p>

  <p>At ten minutes to ten he called for the bill and excused himself
  ostensibly to make a telephone call. The only telephone at the Cheval Noir
  was in Henri's little office at the rear; but Charles did not actually use
  the instrument. Presently he returned to find Gerald ready to leave and a
  little fidgety.</p>

  <p>'Dad, it's been a wonderful dinner&mdash;I've had a grand time.'</p>

  <p>'My pleasure too, Gerald. I only wish we could have seen more of Paris
  together.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, so do I.'</p>

  <p>'Maybe we'll have some other chance.'</p>

  <p>'You bet we will... and dad, why don't you stay here and finish your
  coffee?&mdash;I hate to rush you out like this&mdash;no need for you to see
  me off at the train, we'll be meeting again in London so soon.'</p>

  <p>'Very thoughtful of you, Gerald. In that case I'll just put you into a
  cab.'</p>

  <p>Charles noted the relief on Gerald's face. It hurt him again, but less so
  because he was now making plans of his own. He took the boy to the kerb and
  summoned a taxi from the line of them in the middle of the street. Then he
  shook hands with his son and gave the driver instructions in very rapid
  French.</p>

  <p>'Bye, dad. Thanks again.'</p>

  <p>'Goodbye, my boy. Bon voyage.'</p>

  <p>Charles returned to his table and asked Henri to bring him another fine.
  He felt chastened and also a little unworthy. For the thing he had done
  instead of telephoning was to look up the timetable and confirm that there
  was no such thing as a ten-thirty boat train from St. Lazare. And what he had
  told the driver in rapid French was to return to the restaurant and tell him
  where he had taken the young man.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Half an hour later Charles was in the same taxi, having
ordered the driver
  rather testily: 'Just take me there&mdash;you don't need to describe the
  place.' Feeling as he did somewhat contaminated by the thought that he was
  about to spy on his own son, he certainly did not want to cement the
  treachery by any sort of gossip in advance. Naturally after such a rebuff the
  driver navigated the streets with added recklessness&mdash;the route led
  along the Boulevard des Capucines, then the Boulevard des Italiens, towards
  the Place de la République... And with every mile Charles wondered what he
  was going to do when he got to wherever it was, or if he could even do
  anything at all. For there were circumstances in which Paris was a wonderful
  city to be fatherless in... and at such a speculation Charles had nothing to
  aid him but certain recollections of his own.</p>

  <p>It would probably (he remembered) be one of those dingy buildings with a
  mansard roof and peeling stucco and an advertisement for Byrrh facing from
  across the street in huge letters... And to think of Gerald at seventeen...
  Why, in his own case he had been twenty-two when he... when he spent those
  six months with the Décharays to polish up his accent. Professor Décharay
  used to take him and the other students to the Louvre and the museums during
  the day, but sometimes in the evenings after dinner on the pretext of a
  lecture a few of them would go off on their own... He had often wondered if
  the good professor had guessed where they went, for he twirled his moustache
  rather waggishly when they greeted him the next morning at breakfast...</p>

  <p>And somehow now those adventures, though Charles shrank from the
  translation of them into the life and times of his son, nevertheless did not
  give him any equal distaste when they were recalled. Rather the contrary. Too
  bad one mustn't put that sort of thing into a book&mdash;not that he would
  dream of doing so, even if he could. He wasn't that sort of writer, though he
  must confess he could sometimes enjoy himself as that sort of reader.
  Fashions were changing, standards were crumbling, people talked at dinner-
  tables more freely, one might suppose (though one could hardly be sure), than
  eminent Victorians in bedrooms, chats on the radio and faces in television
  were taking the place of spellbinding oratory and the front line of the
  chorus... Perhaps he might devote a chapter in his book to the changing world
  he had seen&mdash;or no, there could be nothing new to say, he had better
  stick to what was important. The big thing in his career had undoubtedly been
  the Macedonian Boundary Commission; he must concentrate on that. It was his
  only title to fame, if any; the rest was just run of the mill...</p>

  <p>'RUN OF THE MILL'</p>

  <p>Charles and Brunon were among the New Year revellers welcoming 1922 at a
  Rhineland hotel. It was not a good time for painting, but Brunon had a short
  vacation from school and Charles, after Christmas at Beeching, had been glad
  to return to the Continent to meet his friend. During a succession of cold
  and sunny days they walked along the west bank of the Rhine, southward from
  Bonn. Brunon had visited this fabled territory before and knew of a small
  village called Assmannshausen, near Bingen, that would be pleasant to stay
  at, so they had arranged to have mail sent there poste restante.
  Assmannshausen was reached towards twilight after a flurry of snow from the
  hills, and Brunon went to the post office while Charles sat in a café reading
  German papers. There was not much news. More snow was forecast. Francs and
  marks had fallen further. The Washington Armaments Conference was still in
  progress. Charles felt drowsy in the warmth after the icy air outside. He
  also felt very fit and reasonably content. It had been a good idea, taking a
  walking tour in January. Eccentric but invigorating. Brunon came in with a
  batch of letters and sorted them out on the scrubbed table top. There was a
  sprinkling of fresh snow on his coat and his face was pink from the wind.
  None of Charles's letters looked important and he was putting them aside to
  read later when one slipped to the floor. As he picked it up he did not
  recognize the handwriting under Cobb's heavy crossing-out, but the postmark
  'Linstead' caught his eye.</p>

  <p>After a moment Brunon said: 'Not bad news, I hope?'</p>

  <p>'Not tragic, anyway... A girl I know got engaged to somebody else.'</p>

  <p>Charles was pretending to reread, but actually looking for a miracle to
  make it all untrue. There was no miracle, and presently Brunon asked: 'Is it
  going to bother you much?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know&mdash;quite&mdash;yet&mdash;but I don't think so.'</p>

  <p>It was true that at the first moment of shock he didn't know. He hadn't
  thought of Lily a great deal, consciously, during the trip. Nor during
  Christmas at Beeching, nor during previous weeks in Berlin, where he had been
  fraternising pleasantly with the German language and with the family of
  Professor Stapff. The separation, so hard to endure at first, had become
  something he was austerely used to, something he could almost fold to himself
  for perverse comfort; and the anticipation of seeing her again, which had
  been all there was to live on during summer and early autumn, had fallen into
  place along a quiet horizon of the future. But now, with her letter in his
  hand, the horizon darkened and a sense of loss brought such misery that he
  could hardly force himself to think, much less to talk rationally to Brunon
  about any other matter. A snowstorm began that evening, practically marooning
  them for several days at a small inn. There was nothing to do and because he
  was utterly wretched Charles told Brunon the opposite of what he felt in the
  hope that by having to suit his behaviour to it he might achieve some degree
  of self-discipline.</p>

  <p>'Matter of fact, André, it's probably just as well.' Even while he spoke
  the words he felt a betrayer, though what could he now betray?</p>

  <p>'Were you engaged?'</p>

  <p>'Not exactly. She was sixteen when we first met and that was less than a
  year ago. Absurdly young. Sweet though. A typist in an office.'</p>

  <p>'Anything wrong with being a typist in an office?'</p>

  <p>'Of course not. I didn't intend to suggest&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'But since you volunteer the information, is it not implied that the match
  would not be in all ways a suitable one?'</p>

  <p>'I daresay the snobbish view might be that&mdash;for what it's worth. But
  otherwise&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'And in your chosen profession it is worth a great deal. So you are
  perhaps fortunate to have been given such an easy escape.'</p>

  <p>'You think so?... Oh, hell, let's have a bottle of wine&mdash;I'll bet the
  local stuff's good here.'</p>

  <p>'It is excellent. But tell me, Charles&mdash;and then we will not speak of
  her again unless you wish&mdash;I suppose it is because I paint that I like
  to visualize... was she BEAUTIFUL?'</p>

  <p>'WAS she? You mean, IS she&mdash;she's not dead just because someone else
  has her... No, not specially beautiful, but... you want a description? Let me
  see... she has large violet eyes and a wide forehead and dark brown hair,
  complexion rather pale and a straight nose that seems somehow long because it
  isn't big... And there's a gap between one upper tooth and the next, on the
  left side&mdash;a tiny gap that looks better than if it weren't
  there&mdash;it shows when she smiles and she smiles a lot because she's
  generally happy... And she has small hands and feet&mdash;in fact, she's
  little altogether&mdash;incredibly little&mdash;practically no figure to
  speak of&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'But at sixteen, my friend...'</p>

  <p>Charles stamped angrily from his chair, then turned the anger against
  himself and the movement into a stretch and a yawn. He began to laugh in a
  ribald way. It seemed the final Judas touch, but having accomplished it he
  felt better able to compose, as he would have to, the necessary letter of
  congratulation... hoping she and Reg would be happy. He hadn't much doubt
  about it.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Decades later, when he began to think he would one day
write a book, 1922
  was the year at which he decided to start the story of his life, because it
  was the year in which his career opened with quite a spurt of success. After
  spending six months in Europe polishing his languages, he did very well in
  the Foreign Office examination, and when, about the same time, he won the
  Courtenay Prize for History it seemed possible that he was one of those young
  men for whom all ways are to be made smooth. His first chief, Sir Lionel
  Treves, at whose Legation in one of the smaller European capitals he
  presently became an Attaché, thought highly of him, and Lady Treves liked his
  looks and was considerably intrigued by his manner. Neither had known him
  before, so they were unaware of how much he had changed. They thought he was
  far too quiet, but such a fault promised well in a youth whose appearance and
  ability were both beyond reproach.</p>

  <p>Life at the Legation was tranquil, and the work so simple for a junior
  staff-member that, except for further language study, Charles was able to
  give his brain a long and satisfying rest. He had little responsibility, and
  was amused to discover that after all his abstruse cramming most of the tasks
  that fell to him (such as deciphering and copying despatches) were not beyond
  the resources of a reasonably intelligent sixth-former. He spent the mornings
  in the Chancery, often with long intervals of leisure during which he could
  read French and German novels; he got to know his colleagues, and the entire
  atmosphere, with its air of a cheerful enclave whose chance-chosen inmates
  might as well make the best of each other, reminded him a little of the
  Brookfield Sanatorium in which, as a boy with some slight ailment, he had
  found a haven from the rigours of the outside world. Sir Lionel was a
  comfortable chief and did not count the hours his staff put in provided the
  job was done. Charles naturally took the menial duties, if that adjective
  could be applied to any of them; again it was rather like being a new boy at
  school. He began to make friends, most of them among the resident English
  &mdash;it was surprising how few, or at any rate how slowly, relationships
  developed with the people of the city. After leaving cards at the other
  Legations he was asked out to dinners, and found many pleasant acquaintances
  among his opposite numbers. Most afternoons, though, he spent alone from
  choice, exploring the city or attending some lecture or concert. After that
  he would return to the Legation in case anything had been left for him to do;
  even if so it rarely made him late for dinner. Sometimes there was a rush of
  business when a bag came in, and once a royal visit threw everybody into a
  well-controlled commotion that lasted several weeks, but as a rule one could
  watch the European world through a delightful window on the edge of it
  &mdash;for the country had been neutral during the war and was consequently
  quite spotless and a little smug.</p>

  <p>Charles shared a flat with the Second Secretary, a man named Snowden, who
  was unmarried; the First Secretary had a Swedish wife who sang Schubert and
  Hugo Wolf songs exquisitely. There was also a very handsome Military Attaché
  who drifted in and out of the Chancery with gossip about parties he had been
  to the night before; so far as Charles could judge, his functions were almost
  entirely decorative, and most of all at requiem masses whenever it was
  obligatory for the corps diplomatique to attend them. At these affairs the
  Military Attaché looked as if he had stepped right out of the pages of
  Ouida.</p>

  <p>(Later in life, when some of Charles's moments were more arduous, and
  those who shared them with him pictured whimsically or ironically the kind of
  heaven they would choose for themselves, Charles would say: 'Ah, you should
  have been <i>en poste</i> at&mdash;during the twenties&mdash;those were the
  days!' But once, when he so expressed himself, a very old and
  distinguished-looking gentleman in a dressing-gown replied, as urbanely as
  was possible within the confines of an air-raid shelter: 'My boy, they were
  only the pale shadow of the life before you were born! Those were the real
  days&mdash;to be a youth of good family sixty years ago, when you could get
  into the Diplomatic without all this modern fuss about Firsts and degrees
  &mdash;when all you needed was a private income and a father or uncle or
  somebody in high places to take care of you. It was simply the best club that
  ever existed&mdash;founded by the Congress of Vienna, developed by the wealth
  and conveniences of the industrial revolution, and not yet affected by all
  the political and social changes that have finally upset the applecart; a
  club of charming people living a gay life in every capital from Lisbon to
  what was then St. Petersburg&mdash;a few thousand families supplying the
  personnel, so that wherever you went you met people who knew the people you
  knew&mdash;a truly international set in a world full of international
  settings and social counterparts in every country&mdash;Ascot and Chantilly,
  Sandhurst and St. Cyr, Osborne and Ischl, the Quai d'Orsay and the
  Wilhelmstrasse and the Ballplatz, all the Bristol Hotels and the Compagnie
  Internationale des Grands Express Européens... The very words are remembered
  music that even guns and bombs cannot shatter! Ah, what a lovely world if you
  were born into the golden ranks of the inheritors!' And then the old man
  ended startlingly: 'But I wasn't, and I hated its guts.' Charles never saw
  him again or found out his name.)</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Though in retrospect they acquired an austere and
compensating glamour,
  Charles's first professional years contained many misgivings and a great deal
  of boredom. Occasionally also he was visited by a lost look that Lady Treves
  noticed and took to be some mysterious kind of reserve. It usually lifted
  amongst a crowd, and once or twice at some dinner party a few drinks released
  him into a mood in which he was apt to talk wittily enough for her to comment
  afterwards to her husband: 'Charles was quite amusing, wasn't he? Madame
  Papadoulos was much taken with him&mdash;asked me where he was from... I
  didn't know a great deal, I'm afraid.'</p>

  <p>'He comes of a very decent family, my dear. Sir Havelock Anderson was a
  successful K.C. till he made a fool of himself&mdash;they say he still does.'
  Sir Lionel searched still further in the card index of his mind. 'The mother
  was a Calthorpe, one of the Irish Calthorpes&mdash;she's been dead a long
  time. I think there was another son killed in the war. Not too much money.
  Charles will inherit what there is... I met the father once&mdash; bit of a
  character&mdash;rather like a crazy old Viking. Young Anderson's a more
  normal type, thank goodness.'</p>

  <p>'He has an interesting face. Is he going to do well?'</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't be surprised. Fairly good school&mdash;and Cambridge. He did
  well there. Oh yes, he might have his own Legation some time. The other day I
  had to tell him that.'</p>

  <p>'You HAD to tell him?'</p>

  <p>'He suggested a brilliant idea for completely reorganizing the Register.
  So damned brilliant the Foreign Office would have had a fit. I told him that
  by the time he had his own Legation it would probably be adopted, but that
  for the present he'd better hide it as he would an affair with the mistress
  of one of the Russians... I think I managed not to hurt his feelings.'</p>

  <p>'I hope so. He's really one of the nicest men we've had.'</p>

  <p>'If only he'd write a bit larger&mdash;or else I'll have to get some new
  spectacles. I think he could put the Lord's Prayer on a threepenny-bit if he
  tried hard.'</p>

  <p>'Did you know he paints?'</p>

  <p>'Snowden mentioned it, but he's never offered to show me anything.'</p>

  <p>'I caught him at it once. He was doing the view of the square from the big
  window on a Sunday afternoon when he thought no one was about.'</p>

  <p>'Any good?'</p>

  <p>'I wondered. But I couldn't very well ask him, could I? Anyhow, I could
  see he wasn't bad.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">During his leaves Charles sometimes spent short holidays
with Brunon and
  for the rest of the time rented a service flat in London. He rarely visited
  Beeching for longer than a week at a stretch because, he told himself, the
  country bored him&mdash;which was easier if less truthful than to admit that
  he found his father's company a strain. It was not that they quarrelled or
  failed to get along; indeed their relationship seemed more cordial than it
  had formerly been. Yet there was still an unease about it... a feeling that
  made Charles, if ever he heard his father going downstairs after they had
  gone to bed for the night, tiptoe to the landing with a curiosity he could
  hardly define&mdash;because he would never have acted thus with Snowden or
  Brunon, though in the morning he would probably have asked them what they had
  been roaming about the house for. But with his father he never put such a
  question.</p>

  <p>Havelock, now approaching his seventies, had retained much of his fine
  physique and all his capacity for charming those he wanted to charm. Nor
  could it be said that he had become more eccentric, since he had already
  reached a limit beyond which the word would seem inadequate. What had
  happened was a sort of levelling off along a high plateau of singular
  behaviour, in which the singularities were often so trifling that the mean
  average distance from normal could easily be overlooked. Much of his life was
  outwardly like those of his neighbours, and his pastimes, though odd, were no
  more so than those of many another man of his age and income. The porter at
  his club could doubtless have capped any queer story about him with other
  queer stories about other club members. Letters to The Times continued
  without further complications, for there were still old tombstones to be
  discovered and written about. All this was acceptable. So were parties at
  Beeching at which he could be a delightful host. It was just that sometimes
  in his company one could feel, by a heightened awareness, that one was in the
  presence... of a presence. Once Charles came upon him in the library pasting
  a typed poem inside a copy of the Oxford Book of English Verse. Here again, a
  normal curiosity would have made Charles approach and look over his father's
  shoulder, but he felt unable to do this; later, however, he found the book
  and inspected it. To his astonishment there were many of these pasted
  inserts, and most were obscene parodies of well-known poems. A few were
  rather clever. Charles was no prude, and quite unshockable by words, but what
  he did find depressing was the thought of so many busy hours devoted to some
  of the loveliest things in literature with only such a purpose in mind. He
  never mentioned the matter.</p>

  <p>More discussable were Havelock's political views, which had become
  increasingly bitter and at odds with almost every charted orbit. He had hated
  the Coalition Government, but he hated the Labour Party just as much, and he
  despised the Liberals. If anything he was a Conservative, but of such an
  extreme variety that only a few men in Parliament ever said anything he
  approved, and these often belonged to other parties. He sometimes found
  things he agreed with in the unlikeliest quarters&mdash;a remark, for
  instance, by D. H. Lawrence&mdash;'Let there be a parliament of men and women
  for the careful and gradual unmaking of laws.'</p>

  <p>A book that impressed him a great deal was Spengler's Decline of the West,
  which was having an enormous vogue just then throughout Europe. Charles had
  been less impressed&mdash;partly, he admitted, because he had talked to so
  many professors who found innumerable technical errors in those parts of the
  book that concerned their own fields.</p>

  <p>'But of course they would,' Havelock retorted. 'Ever watched a
  schoolteacher marking an exercise? The giggles of glee when he spots a
  mistake?' Havelock took a silver paper-knife and scored deeply into the
  mahogany desk top as if crossing out a wrong answer. 'That's how professors
  read Spengler&mdash;missing the point because they're waiting for their own
  pounce.'</p>

  <p>Charles thought there was some truth in this, but he was also puzzled by
  his father's vehemence and physical violence. After a pause Havelock said: 'I
  suppose you're thinking I've spoilt that desk?'</p>

  <p>'Well, you haven't improved it, have you?'</p>

  <p>'It's not an antique. Came from a priest's house in Maynooth&mdash;my
  father-in-law bought it. Just a Victorian piece.'</p>

  <p>'But rather nice.'</p>

  <p>'So you really do care about these things&mdash;furniture, heirlooms,
  silver, all the stuff there is here?'</p>

  <p>'I didn't say I really cared FOR them, but I'd do my share of taking care
  OF them. There's a bit of difference, I think.'</p>

  <p>'Do you ever wonder what will happen to it all?'</p>

  <p>'Well... what do YOU think?'</p>

  <p>'One of these days it will burn.'</p>

  <p>'You mean catch fire? I hope not&mdash;but a great many country houses do.
  The wiring's bad&mdash;Cobb tried an electric toaster the other day and
  nearly set the kitchen alight.'</p>

  <p>A moment later Charles was sorry he had mentioned this matter, for it made
  Havelock remember that they hadn't had a fire-drill for over a year. So they
  had to have one&mdash;and immediately, since (as Havelock said) the essence
  of a fire-drill is that you don't plan for it in advance. They fixed the
  canvas chute, with the guide-ropes inside, that led down to the lawn from one
  of the top-floor windows. Havelock rang the big brass handbell whose only
  other function was to summon guests to the tea tent at garden parties. Since
  the servants slept in their own quarters away from the main house-block,
  there was little reason for them to take part in the demonstration, but it
  was geared into Havelock's enjoyment of the whole thing that they should,
  especially the housemaids, whose nervousness and disordered skirts made him
  feel quite blithe. Aunt Hetty and Cobb were excused on account of age, but
  Havelock himself, older than either, sometimes made the descent twice,
  emerging at the bottom like some excited thrill-seeker at an amusement park.
  Charles did not much care for the experience, for he usually slid down too
  fast and got scratched, but he realized that since his own bedroom was on the
  top floor there was some point in it. His chief doubt was whether, if a fire
  ever started in the middle of the night, anyone would wake up in time to
  unroll the thing out of the window.</p>

  <p>One June afternoon during his leave Charles had just made such a descent
  when a young woman came cycling up the drive. Without any introduction or
  preamble she exclaimed, amidst her own astonished laughter: 'What on earth
  are you doing? You came shooting out as if it was the Tunnel of Love or
  something... Have you hurt your arm?'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Charles, 'but I've torn my trousers, that's why I'm keeping my
  hand there... Is there&mdash;er&mdash;anything I can do for you?'</p>

  <p>'I'm your new neighbour&mdash;Jane Coppermill&mdash;we've just moved into
  Burton Bridgwater. I thought I'd pay a call.'</p>

  <p>'Delighted. I'm Charles Anderson. My father's in the house somewhere. This
  is a fire-drill we have once a year or so... Those top rooms&mdash;as you can
  see&mdash;a regular trap. I believe the insurance company recommended this
  contrivance.' He felt he had to offer some plausible reason for it all.
  'Excuse me and I'll go in and change, if you don't mind hanging around till I
  come back.'</p>

  <p>'Can't I go in and meet your father?'</p>

  <p>'Why, er&mdash;certainly, if you wish.'</p>

  <p>She leaned her bicycle against the portico and entered the house with him.
  As they crossed the hall she whispered: 'Tell me first, though&mdash;is it
  true he's a little mad?'</p>

  <p>Charles answered: 'Yes, we all are. The Mad Andersons. Didn't you know
  that? We're the talk of the county.' How else could one deal with such a
  question? He would rather have snubbed her, but he could not think of a snub
  in time, so the badinage would have to do, and if she caught behind it a
  reproof, so much the better. Meanwhile, without helping her to search for
  Havelock, he left her standing in the hall and went upstairs. When he came
  down she had apparently gone without seeing Havelock, but Havelock had seen
  her through the window and asked who she was. Charles explained.</p>

  <p>'Yes, I heard somebody had bought Burton Bridgwater,' he mused.
  'Coppermill&mdash;COPPERMILL. If it's the newspaper Coppermills, they're
  rich.'</p>

  <p>They were indeed, and Jane was their youngest child. Not so much of a
  child, though. She was thirty-one, unmarried, and completely unafraid&mdash;
  even of remaining a spinster. She went through life armoured by personality,
  so that she could be herself, whatever behaviour that involved, and more
  often than not she got away with it because it was all over, clearly well
  meant and forgivable, before anyone could stop her. She was not pretty, but
  she was healthy and vigorous and lively, and there were times when one
  examined her features separately and wondered why the total did not add up to
  real beauty, but the very fact of wondering made the discrepancy less. She
  had clear blue eyes and a downright look. She would talk to a butcher boy, if
  she met him in the course of her day's affairs, as abruptly and frankly as
  she would to the Third Secretary of a Legation (Charles had recently been so
  promoted). This was not because she felt herself to be consciously
  democratic, but simply because a natural inclination to follow her impulses
  had been reinforced by long experience that she could always afford the
  luxury.</p>

  <p>During this particular leave Charles did not see her again, but a few
  months later when he was back at work he was called to the Legation
  telephone; it was Jane Coppermill, just ashore from a cruise liner. She would
  be staying in the city for three days and wondered if they could meet.
  Charles was mildly pleased, for he suddenly thought of the Tunnel of Love and
  realized that his life in the neutral capital, though increasingly agreeable,
  was still somewhat lacking in fun. Unfortunately all three evenings were
  taken up with official engagements he could not get out of&mdash;one of them
  a rather big reception which all the corps diplomatique would attend. After
  he had explained this she said: 'Oh, tell your boss I'm here&mdash; he'll
  probably invite me.' Afterwards Charles thought it would have been more
  correct for her to announce her own arrival, if she knew the Treveses, but it
  was too late then to suggest it. When Treves came in later that afternoon
  Charles mentioned that Jane Coppermill had telephoned. Treves immediately
  remembered her. 'Anyone would who was at Berne in those days.'</p>

  <p>Charles looked his interest and Treves continued: 'She must have been in
  her late teens then&mdash;at some finishing school&mdash;just before the war.
  The Minister was away and I was in charge, which made it all the worse
  &mdash;for me.'</p>

  <p>'What happened?' Charles asked.</p>

  <p>'She fell into the bear-pit among the bears. It's a well-known show place
  at Berne. Goodness knows how it happened. She poked at the bears with an
  umbrella to hold them off till she was rescued, but the keeper broke a leg
  doing it and the Swiss said it was all her fault. There was an enquiry and
  letters in the Berne papers&mdash;then London got to hear of it&mdash;oh,
  quite a set-to. In the end I believe her father had to pay the man a very
  handsome amount... The Bernese, you know, really love those bears. I think if
  she'd poked one in the eye even in self-defence we should have had a real
  international incident... She's probably less of a hoyden now. Why don't you
  ask her to the reception if she's going to be here to-morrow?' Charles said
  he would be glad to.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When he met her he was startled by her appearance.
Naturally he had
  expected her to look very different in evening clothes from the only
  recollection he had of her&mdash;leaning on a bicycle in rough country
  tweeds; but he had not realized the strikingness of her. She was a woman one
  would look at twice and wonder who she was, whether or not one afterwards
  decided that it mattered. Moreover, her personality had an air of challenging
  without breaking the rather stiff protocol which marked the opening
  proceedings of a reception of this kind. Afterwards, of course, formalities
  could be relaxed, though it was still a wise precaution not to forget them
  altogether.</p>

  <p>Charles had already discovered that in the small world of a diplomatic
  corps there were always white sheep whom one personally liked and could treat
  as friends, and black sheep whom one didn't like or who represented countries
  suspect by one's own government; but to all, of course, one must behave with
  correctness. So much was elementary, but a problem could arise when someone
  personally liked fell into the black category. This had recently happened in
  Charles's world to a foreign Attaché named Davanrog, who had been very
  popular till his country did something unpopular, after which everyone was so
  sorry for Davanrog that he was in some danger of becoming more popular than
  ever. However, the cautionary word was slipped by Treves to his staff, with a
  resulting cancellation of several projected hunting and fishing trips. And
  Davanrog, who must have known there was nothing personal in it, probably did
  not take it too much to heart.</p>

  <p>He was a fine-looking fellow, and when Charles saw Jane Coppermill greet
  him at the reception like an old friend he wondered if his own instant
  feeling could have any personal jealousy in it; but he decided not&mdash;
  after all, Jane was nothing to him, just a country neighbour he had met once
  and hadn't bothered to meet again till she herself made the effort. They had
  met for this second time with cordiality, but no more&mdash;not as much, it
  would seem, as there was between her and Davanrog. Charles wished, though, he
  had had a chance to tell her that Davanrog, for purely political reasons, was
  somewhat out of favour with the British; noticing that Treves also had his
  eye on her, he hoped his chief would not feel he was to blame. It was not
  clear how he could be, but the niceties of diplomatic behaviour were apt to
  carry such vague and indefinable responsibilities. Anyhow, Charles was
  relieved when he saw her leave Davanrog and allow herself to be taken to
  supper by one of the Dutchmen, with whom she also seemed extremely cordial;
  but Charles was troubled again when, after a minimum of polite circulation
  amongst the throng, Davanrog made his excuses to the Treveses and left early.
  It was a perfectly proper thing to do, but it left glaringly obvious the fact
  that the man's only fun at the party had been with Jane.</p>

  <p>Later in the evening Charles danced with her. She was a good dancer; he
  was just average. He did not much like dancing anyway, but it was a social
  accomplishment he could not disdain as he did golf and tennis. 'So you know
  Davanrog?' he asked casually.</p>

  <p>'I met him once before&mdash;in Copenhagen.'</p>

  <p>With such a cue, and knowing so little about her, Charles was quick to
  comment: 'You travel about a good deal, don't you?'</p>

  <p>'I enjoy seeing new places.'</p>

  <p>'But do you go alone?'</p>

  <p>'Unless I can find the right companion. I like a lot of people but I don't
  like everybody a lot.'</p>

  <p>'That sounds reasonable. You don't have to.'</p>

  <p>'No. I'm more or less free to do as I choose. I know I'm lucky. Luckier
  than you. You probably have to do plenty of things you don't care about
  &mdash;dancing, for instance. Why don't we sit down somewhere?'</p>

  <p>'Well...' he exclaimed. He was amused and not ungrateful. They found a
  corner in a conservatory that overlooked the lights of the city. 'Getting
  settled in at Burton Bridgwater by now?' he said, unable to think of anything
  else.</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, the family is. I don't think I'm a very good settler anywhere.
  You know what I like to do most?'</p>

  <p>'Am I going to be horrified?'</p>

  <p>'Probably. I like to climb mountains.'</p>

  <p>'Well, that's just where you're wrong. I like it too.'</p>

  <p>'But I mean REAL climbing.'</p>

  <p>'Try me some day.'</p>

  <p>'Clogwyn Du'r-arrdu?'</p>

  <p>'I've done it.'</p>

  <p>'The North Wall of the Grandes Jorasses?'</p>

  <p>'No, and neither have you.'</p>

  <p>She laughed. 'You evidently know something. To tell you the truth, I'm
  good&mdash;quite good&mdash;but not as good as that. I've done most of the
  standard Alpine climbs, and I was with Melrose and Linmayer in Corsica last
  year. That's some sort of testimonial, maybe.'</p>

  <p>'I should think it is.'</p>

  <p>'What I'd like now is to go further afield&mdash;say the Caucasus.'</p>

  <p>'Not by yourself, surely?'</p>

  <p>'Oh no, it would have to be a real expedition. But I know Melrose and some
  of his friends would come if it could be arranged. Unfortunately you need all
  kinds of permits even to get near the place. I was talking to Davanrog about
  that.'</p>

  <p>'Could he help you?'</p>

  <p>'That's what I had in mind. But he wasn't very encouraging. I pressed him
  for a reason&mdash;I'm the sort of person who expects a reason for things
  &mdash;but all I could get out of him was some mumble about possible trouble
  in that direction during the summer. That old Turkish-Armenian business, I
  suppose.'</p>

  <p>'He mentioned that?'</p>

  <p>'What he actually said was "les querelles intérieures du pays
  Turco-Arménien".'</p>

  <p>'Well, well...' It was part of Charles's training that when he was told
  anything important he did not betray that it was. In this case he did not
  know whether it was important or not. But when the party was over and the
  hired waiters were clearing up in the banqueting hall he wandered into the
  office and found his chief there, whisky and soda in hand, going over some
  cables that had arrived. 'Nothing much,' he remarked, passing them to
  Charles. 'A good party, I thought.'</p>

  <p>Charles said he thought so too.</p>

  <p>'That Jane Coppermill of yours certainly has changed.'</p>

  <p>Charles didn't altogether approve the 'of yours'; after the bear-pit story
  he would have considered her just as much Sir Lionel's. (He had mentioned
  that incident to Jane and she had told him how it had happened &mdash;she had
  been trying to retrieve an umbrella which had slipped through the railings
  while she was watching the animals, and with which she afterwards defended
  herself. 'But it was nothing&mdash;they were a mangy lot. I only had to prod
  them to keep them off.')</p>

  <p>Charles said to Treves: 'Yes, and for the better, I should say.'</p>

  <p>'She seemed quite friendly with Davanrog.'</p>

  <p>'They met in Copenhagen once, she said.' Charles then told Treves what
  Jane had told him about Davanrog's discouragement of a climbing expedition in
  the Caucasus that summer.</p>

  <p>It was part of Sir Lionel's training that when he was told anything
  important he did not betray that it was. In this case he thought it was
  probably not important at all, but to be on the safe side he might send a
  memo to London about it.</p>

  <p>So he said, sipping his drink good-humouredly: 'What does she think she
  is, that young lady? International spy or something? Did you happen to notice
  a bundle of stolen treaties tucked away in her corsage?'</p>

  <p>What Charles had noticed in her corsage&mdash;while they were dancing, in
  fact&mdash;had been more tempting than stolen treaties. Thinking of this made
  him smile as he answered: 'She's reliable, I should say. I'll bet she's good
  to climb with.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Later still that evening, or rather early the next morning,
Treves
  conducted the usual bedroom post-mortem with his wife. They were a very
  devoted couple, behind the façade of being chef and chefesse.</p>

  <p>'That Coppermill girl heard an interesting thing from Davanrog.' He gave
  the details.</p>

  <p>Lady Treves said: 'I don't suppose she got it out of him
  deliberately.'</p>

  <p>'Oh no, she'd never have managed it if she'd tried. What WAS smart of her,
  though, was to pass it on to Anderson.'</p>

  <p>'I wonder if that was accidental too.'</p>

  <p>'Anderson said he thought she knew it was something we'd be interested to
  hear.'</p>

  <p>'Does Charles know her well?'</p>

  <p>'They're neighbours. Some place in Gloucestershire. She's one of the
  Coppermills that bought the Record when Derry sold out.'</p>

  <p>'Plenty of money?'</p>

  <p>'Far more than you and I will ever have, my dear.'</p>

  <p>'I rather liked her, what I saw of her, and if she's so smart and has
  money&mdash;might not be a bad thing for Charles&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I don't think there's anything like that in contemplation.'</p>

  <p>'Well, you never know. He's attractive, and she looks to me the sort of
  girl who gets what she wants.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Six months later Jane Coppermill got what she wanted. They
were married in
  Salzburg, where Charles had gone for the Festival and she for some climbing
  in the Dolomites. Since each had known that the other would be there at the
  same time, it was always a matter of argument afterwards whether they had
  planned it, consciously or subconsciously; the fact that Jane, who did not
  particularly care for music, went to several concerts with Charles was
  reckonable against the fact that Charles, who enjoyed climbing, allowed
  himself to be considerably seduced from Mozart to the mountains. After a few
  weeks of this sort of thing the decision was made. They did not tell anybody,
  but somehow the announcement got into the English papers (and here again
  there could have been an interesting argument&mdash;was it Jane's or
  Charles's minor importance that made them worth a three-line wire?). Charles
  then wrote to his father and received an elegant letter of congratulation and
  an invitation to bring Jane to stay at Beeching as soon as they returned to
  England. Charles, of course, was to be similarly welcomed at Burton
  Bridgwater by Jane's family, and as the houses were less than a mile apart it
  was easy to combine the two invitations. Havelock also seemed to like Jane
  personally, the more so when she took up from the outset a no-nonsense
  attitude towards him which cleared away many difficulties. 'I heard rumours
  you were mad and now I'm convinced you are,' she told him sportively before
  she had been a guest at Beeching a full day. It was because of something he
  had said&mdash;not too outrageous, for him. But Jane could match him in
  outrageousness, both of speech and action. 'You're just a wicked old man,'
  she told him at a party in front of a crowd. 'And it's not just weakness with
  you, it's strength, isn't it?' Havelock's eyes flashed back a response in
  which there was an amused awareness that Jane was a person to be reckoned
  with.</p>

  <p>Both Charles and Jane, however, were glad to leave England at the end of
  the extended leave, especially as Charles had been appointed Second Secretary
  in a city much nearer to the crossroads of world affairs than his previous
  post. It could be regarded as a speedy promotion, and though he wondered if
  Jane, through her various family connections, had pulled any strings to get
  it for him, he felt confident of being able to justify himself. He was very
  happy indeed as they crossed the Channel from Croydon to Le Bourget. It was
  for both of them a first trip by air.</p>

  <p>Jane soon showed her qualifications not only as a wife but as a Second
  Secretary's wife. She tackled the job with a respect for it that muted the
  strings of her personality without putting any of them out of tune. The
  Ambassador, Sir Richard Thornton ('Papa'), was a senior diplomat who (someone
  once said) possessed many merits developed to a marked degree of averageness;
  he had married late, and for the second time, and it was his wife who set the
  key and pace of the Embassy. Older than he was, sharp-tongued and
  domineering, of an aristocratic family and twice widowed by men who had won
  high distinction in the Foreign Service, she had an air of making comparisons
  that must always be unsatisfactory. Perhaps Sir Richard guessed this. He was
  completely under her thumb, and therefore astute enough to pretend not to
  like Jane as much as he did; while Jane, sizing up the situation, knew that
  sooner or later Lady Thornton would have to be tackled.</p>

  <p>The clash came over Jane's behaviour at a reception given by a foreign
  Embassy to a visiting royalty. The entire diplomatic corps was present and
  protocol reigned heavily. Somebody, however, must have spilled the bear-pit
  story, for when Jane was presented to His Majesty, he mentioned it, and the
  result was a rather long and jovial tête-à-tête later in the evening, which
  nobody failed to observe. Jane happened to have lived for a time in His
  Majesty's country and to have a smattering of the language, all of which
  helped. When the affair was over she thought she had done quite well to give
  royalty such a chance to unbend, but the next day Lady Thornton made a point
  of snubbing her for it in Charles's presence. 'I suppose,' she remarked, 'he
  was your first king and he went to your head?'</p>

  <p>Since Jane was not one to take rebukes of this sort easily, Charles jumped
  in with excuses for her before she could reply. But then Lady Thornton turned
  her guns on him, interrupting: 'When you've had more experience, Mr.
  Anderson, you'll perhaps be less ready to contradict me.'</p>

  <p>'He wasn't contradicting you,' Jane retorted, prompt now to defend
  Charles. 'He just can't think what I did wrong, and neither can I.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' Charles agreed. 'After all, it was the King who started it
  &mdash;I daresay he felt in the mood for a joke. Those fellows must get
  awfully bored with formalities&mdash;it seems rather hard if they can't ever
  be allowed to relax like anybody else.'</p>

  <p>'Nonsense,' Lady Thornton snapped back. 'It's no harder for them than it
  is for us. They EXPECT to be bored. They're usually on guard about their
  rank, and if you forget for a moment who they are&mdash;no matter how much
  they've seemed to encourage you&mdash;they're apt to see a slight. Of course
  there are exceptions, but when you've met as many kings as I have, Mr. and
  Mrs. Anderson, you'll know it's much safer to bore them than to try to amuse
  them.'</p>

  <p>'I never like doing things that are too safe,' Jane said, but she caught
  Charles's eye and could see that he too was somewhat disarmed as well as
  astonished by Lady Thornton's frankness.</p>

  <p>'Then you'll run grave risks of damaging your husband's career. And
  believe me, that warning is well-meant.'</p>

  <p>Afterwards Charles exchanged a glance with Jane and burst out laughing.
  'Well, well... we're still alive, that's something. But what a crushing old
  battleaxe!'</p>

  <p>Jane said, more seriously: 'I wonder if she's right&mdash;about kings. I
  don't suppose we shall meet as many as she has, anyhow.'</p>

  <p>'There aren't as many.'</p>

  <p>'Darling, that's far more crushing than anything SHE said.'</p>

  <p>The odd thing was that after this incident they both got along much better
  with Lady Thornton&mdash;indeed, it could almost be said that she showed
  signs of liking them. She was a remarkable woman and doubtless much could be
  learned from her example. The atmosphere at her parties was far too
  disciplined, but they were socially efficient and set a standard. She worked
  hard. She devoted herself to local charities. She bullied the American
  Minister (a poker-playing millionaire politician) into serving on committees
  for the care of refugee children and the restoration of ancient cathedrals.
  Duty was her watchword and attention to duty her prime requirement in others.
  In her opinion all diplomats under forty were ill-trained and bad-mannered,
  frivolous and deplorably slack. She considered Charles to be most of these
  things to an extent made worse by his pleasant disposition, and she conveyed
  her misgivings to Jane with the implied suggestion that Jane and she were
  sisters under the skin, steel-ribbed in contrast to the invertebrates all
  around them. Jane was amused. 'She really thinks that,' she told Charles.
  'And I'm afraid to disillusion her.'</p>

  <p>'I don't think you're afraid of anything and I don't think she could be
  disillusioned about anything,' Charles answered, baiting Jane affectionately.
  'And maybe you ARE a bit like her. She's not a bad sort.'</p>

  <p>'Poor Papa.'</p>

  <p>'How do we know?'</p>

  <p>'She puts him in his place all the time.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps that's just exactly where he likes to be.'</p>

  <p>One thing was certain: the rigidities of Embassy functions under Lady
  Thornton pointed up the fact that Jane's parties, which she gave often and
  unostentatiously and with a clever mingling of seniors and juniors, became
  noted among the diplomatic crowd for their sparkle and general enjoyability.
  Nor did they lack moments at which things were said and discussed of some
  importance. Afterwards Jane and Charles would hold their own intimate post-
  mortems.</p>

  <p>'I thought the new Bulgarian was sweet.'</p>

  <p>'Battleaxe won't approve of him. Especially that long cigarette-
  holder.'</p>

  <p>'It suits him, though. Did you talk to Madame Lesinsky?'</p>

  <p>'Not much. Did you?'</p>

  <p>'She said Delafours told her the outlook for the new German loan isn't
  promising... By the way, I must teach Hélo se to make ice cream properly or
  else get it sent in next time. Cintara poured his wine into his. Did you
  notice?'</p>

  <p>'Maybe an old Portuguese custom... I wonder where Rampagni's wife got
  those earrings?'</p>

  <p>'Either an heirloom or very bad taste... What did you think of Beatrice
  Kindersley?'</p>

  <p>'Perfectly delightful.'</p>

  <p>'She told von Ahndorf the reason her father plays poker so well is because
  he learned it at his mother's knee and other joints.'</p>

  <p>'I've heard that gag before, but it sounds good about Kindersley. I rather
  like the old boy. Must be a headache to his staff, but he's refreshingly out
  of place among all the career men. Wherever he goes there'll be some corner
  of a foreign field that's forever Texas.'</p>

  <p>'That's not a bad gag either.'</p>

  <p>'Grandison's was the best. He said Kindersley always made him think that
  perhaps a tired salesman in a china shop must sometimes just LONG for a
  bull.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Those were the gay years, the gayest perhaps for centuries,
perhaps also
  for centuries to come. The First World War had become something one did not
  bring up unless one had to; personal recollections of it were nearly always a
  bore or the mark of one. How ironical to recall, if one could, the recruiting
  poster that had pictured a father being asked by his son: 'What did you do in
  the Great War?' Charles hadn't a son, but if he had, he couldn't imagine the
  question, much less the answer. The only time the matter had point was if one
  became friendly with individual Germans... 'Were you on the Somme?' 'Why,
  yes, so was I'&mdash;and then leave it at that, with some sort of freemasonry
  established. But Charles's experience did not yield any such item. Once,
  however, he met a German who said he came from Ingolstadt, and Charles was
  able to reply: 'Indeed? My brother died there&mdash;in a prison camp just
  after the war ended. The flu epidemic.' Just the casual common denominator of
  a past that one hoped was on the way to oblivion.</p>

  <p>But it was this curious interval, during which the first war was not quite
  forgotten and the next one not yet feared, that made for a sudden short-lived
  fashion of remembrance. Remarque's Im Westen Nichts Neues swept the world; so
  did Sherriff's Journey's End. Charles and Jane made up a party to see this
  play when it came to their city, performed in the language of the country;
  and afterwards, at a restaurant, memories were unleashed by guests of half a
  dozen nationalities. For once, it seemed, and perhaps never again, Europeans
  could unite in a single emotion if not in a common cause; the only faint
  division line, indeed, was between the ex-warriors and the neutrals who had
  missed the ordeal. 'Would you fight again?' was asked, and the answers of the
  diplomats were both undiplomatic and unnecessary, for surely they would never
  have to face the problem. Even an enemy would whisk them safely home across
  frontiers with full honours.</p>

  <p>Charles said to Jane on the way back to their house: 'I wonder what all
  our Foreign Offices would say if they got a verbatim report of that
  conversation. Give us all the boot, maybe.'</p>

  <p>'And then there wouldn't be any younger generation to take over from
  people like Papa.'</p>

  <p>But Sir Richard also saw the play and discussed it later in an equally
  undiplomatic way, though privately in his office. 'Were you in the war,
  Anderson?'</p>

  <p>'No, sir, I was just too young.'</p>

  <p>'I'd say you were damned lucky then. My son was killed. Makes you wonder
  &mdash;almost&mdash;how human beings could be forced to endure such things...
  I mean if they'd all packed up suddenly and run home&mdash;both
  sides&mdash;who could have stopped them?' This was surely a na ve thought for
  an Ambassador to utter, and perhaps he realized it, for he continued hastily:
  'Funny the effect a play can have. You ever met this fellow Sherriff?'</p>

  <p>'No, sir.'</p>

  <p>'If I ever do I'll tell him how much I was impressed.'</p>

  <p>'I'm sure he'd be very glad if you wrote to him and said so.'</p>

  <p>'All right. Draft me a letter... I was in London during one of the
  Zeppelin raids. Happened to be at Liverpool Street Station&mdash;you know
  Liverpool Street Station?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'It's got a very high glass roof... I was in a train just about to leave
  when a bomb fell. Killed about twenty people in another train coming in
  across the platform. Hope I never see anything like that again&mdash;people
  on their way to business from the suburbs&mdash;lots of girls... I pulled
  some of them out of the mess&mdash;the glass did the worst... I'll never
  forget those office girls&mdash;cut to ribbons, some of them... Well, well,
  must work. Fetch me Herstlett, I want to look up something... Oh, and&mdash;
  er&mdash;don't bother about a letter to that writer fellow&mdash;might lead
  to a lot of useless correspondence...'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Charles was transferred again. Already he was beyond the
stage at which
  his work was mostly simple and routine; it began to present problems, and
  these he thought he tackled rather more than adequately. There were times
  when he was bored and fancied he would have been happier in some other job,
  but with later detachment he usually decided that he wouldn't&mdash;he didn't
  really envy the lawyers, politicians, and business men whom he frequently had
  to meet. The ones he did occasionally envy were shy engineers on their way to
  some project, or a few stray writers globetrotting for local colour and
  showing off their freedom at all the parties they could pick up en route.
  There were times also when Charles thought of the millions living around him
  whom he would never encounter unless they figured personally as servants or
  tradespeople or impersonally as statistics in books of reference
  &mdash;people who might, by some movement of force beyond the reach of
  protocol, become suddenly 'allies' or 'enemies'. Like all the great
  professions, diplomacy seemed to him a marvellous conspiracy that never did,
  in the long run, quite succeed in either achieving or defeating the ends of
  something bigger than itself.</p>

  <p>He was at a South American post in 1929 when Wall Street crashed and he
  received a lugubrious letter from Havelock bemoaning the way the London
  market had dropped in sympathy. Since Charles had American friends whose
  plight was almost desperate, he did not waste much concern on his father's
  financial position, but he was sorry to learn from Cobb that Aunt Hetty was
  ill. His father had not mentioned it. A few months later Aunt Hetty died, and
  Havelock did mention the matter then, listing it as another of the crosses he
  had to bear. But the next letter was reassuring&mdash;it enclosed a cutting
  from The Times, to which Havelock seemed to have contributed the blithest
  letter of his career. It narrated how, in the churchyard of Pumphrey Basset,
  Berks., he had discovered the resting-place of a forgotten female dwarf,
  judging from the inscription on the eighteenth-century tombstone, which read
  'Aged 42 Years, Height 35 inches, "Parva sed apta Domino".' Havelock made a
  good story of it, and Charles pictured him kneeling and feeling on the grassy
  grave, for (as he remembered from having taken part as a boy in several of
  these expeditions) the stone was apt to be so flaky and moss-covered that it
  chipped away if one tried to clean it, and in such cases the sensitive
  fingertip was often a safer reader than the eye.</p>

  <p>Charles was still in South America five years later when the sudden death
  of Jane's father summoned her to England. Charles would have asked for leave
  to accompany her, but he was First Secretary now and it was possible that his
  chief might also be taking a leave in the near future, so he said he had
  better stay. Jane agreed with him. What they both meant was that he mustn't
  miss the chance of being Chargé for a time. It was only a small Legation, but
  to have full authority and responsibility at his age, even temporarily, could
  be a stroke of luck in his career. So little ever happened to stir the placid
  relations between His Majesty's Government and that particular country that
  Jane and Charles tried to cheer themselves, the night before she sailed, by
  imagining some incident that would give him scope to show his
  capabilities.</p>

  <p>'If Argentina were to grab the Falkland Islands,' was Charles's
  choice.</p>

  <p>'An earthquake,' Jane countered. 'You plunge into the wreckage and save
  some red boxes.'</p>

  <p>They agreed that both these suggestions would involve unnecessary
  disaster. It was the Commercial Attaché who joined them then and, being
  admitted to the game, scored easily by his vision of an airman making a
  forced landing near the top of the Andes. 'First of all, no one can climb to
  rescue him but Charles. And then it turns out the fellow hasn't any passport
  or visa&mdash;a man without a country. But he carries a secret formula that
  will revolutionize the art of warfare&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'In that case,' interrupted Charles, 'I'd leave him there.'</p>

  <p>'Which would spoil my point&mdash;so I'll change the formula. It's for
  something beneficial to humanity&mdash;a cure for bubonic plague or pellagra
  or foot-and-mouth disease. Anyhow, because of this you promptly confer on him
  honorary British citizenship.'</p>

  <p>'Having just then decided to invent such a thing,' Charles
  interjected.</p>

  <p>'That's where I get to my point&mdash;you take a chance. The Nelson
  touch&mdash;so rare among Chargés d'Affaires.'</p>

  <p>This Attaché, Claud Severing, was a young man whom they had come to like
  and had taken with them on several climbing expeditions. Jane was glad she
  was leaving Charles with a real friend, and Charles, though he was sorry to
  see her go, felt that three months of bachelorhood might yield austere
  pleasures. It would be agreeable, anyhow, to spend so much time with
  Severing, with a few trips into the mountains if they could be arranged.</p>

  <p>Yet after Jane had gone Charles made a discovery that surprised him: he
  not only missed her but he missed something in himself that seemed to vanish
  when she left. Perhaps it was the way she managed things in the house, her
  decisions about parties and party-giving, her advice on small matters of
  etiquette or behaviour, even her actual help in his work, for she liked to
  spend time in the Chancery odd-jobbing in a way that would have been
  impossible in a larger and more systematized Legation. So now his extra work
  was quite often a symbol of her absence even when he was thinking of other
  things. When he most acutely missed her was late in the evening after a
  party, when they would have held their post-mortem on the guests and
  conversation. Because they were both popular, Charles received a rush of
  invitations well meant to appease his loneliness, but somehow accepting them
  only seemed to increase it; he missed the flash of Jane's eye across the
  dinner-table, signalling in secret what her partner was like; or the
  quizzical look which conveyed that she had overheard him say something witty
  at his end. Without her, indeed, he found it twice as hard to be only half as
  amusing, and since he had the reputation for being amusing he wondered if his
  hosts were thinking him bad company or merely realizing what a good wife for
  him Jane was. He thought so too, but he wished he need not prove it quite so
  negatively. Partly from this somewhat obscure motivation he began a small
  flirtation with Madame Salcinet, the wife of the French Minister. She was
  pert and youngish and apparently ready for the diversion, since the place
  bored her and her elderly husband was tetchy enough to regard his post as the
  Quai d'Orsay's equivalent of Devil's Island. 'Of course Edouard will retire
  after this,' she confided. 'There is really nothing for me to do but count
  the days&mdash;and even more depressingly, the nights.'</p>

  <p>'Where will you retire to?' Charles asked.</p>

  <p>'I shall live in Paris and he will live at Limoges. That is where he comes
  from. Nothing on earth would induce me to spend the rest of my life at
  Limoges.'</p>

  <p>'It's not a bad place,' Charles said. 'I have a French friend who paints
  &mdash;we once made Limoges a centre for a very pleasant holiday. We found
  many beautiful scenes.'</p>

  <p>'You paint also?'</p>

  <p>'Not as much as I used to. I don't get the time.'</p>

  <p>'You spend so much of your time climbing mountains.'</p>

  <p>'Well, that's true. I enjoy it.'</p>

  <p>'I think you enjoy it because your wife enjoys it. She does not enjoy
  painting so you do not paint. If she enjoyed snake-hunting I think you would
  hunt snakes.'</p>

  <p>Charles laughed. 'You're absolutely right. It's the recipe for a perfect
  marriage.'</p>

  <p>'You think your own marriage proves that?'</p>

  <p>Lightly and without much thought behind the merely verbal dialectic
  Charles countered: 'Does yours DISprove it?'</p>

  <p>Whereupon Madame Salcinet became suddenly indignant and with a touch of
  hysteria. 'You have no right to say such a thing to me! You take an
  unpardonable liberty! I shall certainly inform Sir Bancroft&mdash;it was a
  most insulting and improper remark to make to the wife of one of your
  Minister's colleagues!'</p>

  <p>Charles, astonished at her vehemence, apologized and said no more. It was
  during the interval at an afternoon concert, where they had met by accident.
  He believed the outburst had not attracted attention, since they had spoken
  in French, but he sat rather unhappily through the rest of the music; and
  walking back to the Legation afterwards he could not help thinking: Oh God,
  if only Jane were here... It was not that he had been dangerously indiscreet
  with Madame Salcinet, or that the remark she had taken exception to had been
  in worse taste than several of hers to him. Nor did he think that anything
  she said to Banky could do him much harm, and Banky would certainly take his
  word against hers if there were any disputed accusations. But the whole thing
  was just one of those incidents that Jane would have handled so capably
  &mdash;or rather, it was the kind that wouldn't have happened at all if she
  had been on the spot.</p>

  <p>The Germans were giving a small party the following week for chiefs and
  their wives only. As the time for it approached, Charles had slight qualms,
  not quite of apprehension but of a somewhat glum curiosity as to whether
  Madame Salcinet still planned her complaint. Nor was this curiosity ever
  resolved, for several days before the party it became known that she had been
  removed to a private institution. 'Completely off her rocker, so I heard,'
  Banky said. 'I must write a note of sympathy to Salcinet... Anderson, didn't
  you meet her at the Brahms the other day? Somebody said he saw you talking to
  her. What was she like then?'</p>

  <p>'Just charming as always,' Charles answered. 'And Toscanini was wonderful
  as always.' He was really becoming a diplomat.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Banky didn't take leave after all, so Charles was denied
his spell as
  Chargé. Then Jane returned, tanned and refreshed after the long sea trip. Her
  stay in England had been full of legal business and sad visits to relatives;
  she was glad to be back. Her father had left her some money &mdash;it was not
  yet clear how much, but of course the bulk went to her brothers. The family
  would probably get rid of Burton Bridgwater if they could find a buyer. It
  would be easier to sell than most such houses (Beeching, for instance), since
  it had been ruinously modernized and provided with more bathrooms than
  anybody could use. Perhaps some American would want it. Jane chattered on
  thus during the taxi ride from the docks to their house near the Legation;
  not till they were alone in its cool Spanish-style interior did she turn to
  him in a personal way. 'Well, Charles, have you been missing me?'</p>

  <p>'You bet I have. I don't suppose you've missed me, though.'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, I have.'</p>

  <p>'Not as much, anyhow.'</p>

  <p>'Much more, I'm sure.'</p>

  <p>'Impossible.'</p>

  <p>'This is a childish conversation... Come here, Andy.'</p>

  <p>She called him Andy at moments when they were closest, and presently at
  such a moment somebody opened the door and hastily backed out. They thought
  it must be Severing, but when Severing came later he denied this so stoutly
  that they were quite certain&mdash;and rather relieved&mdash;it had been only
  he. Of course it didn't really matter. They drank champagne and were very
  merry. After Severing left, Jane said that someone she had met in London had
  told her that Charles was highly thought of at the Foreign Office and could
  expect a transfer to Europe before long.</p>

  <p>She had also seen his father once or twice. He seemed to keep very well
  for his age. 'He's taken up kindness to animals.'</p>

  <p>'Good... not that he was ever UNkind to them, I must say.'</p>

  <p>'But he won't have traps that KILL mice any more&mdash;he has a kind that
  click down and imprison them in a sort of cage, and in the morning he goes
  round the kitchens collecting the cages. Then he sets the mice free in the
  middle of the lawn and they all run back to the kitchens.'</p>

  <p>'I wonder how the servants like that.'</p>

  <p>'The housemaids are in a state. They're scared enough even of DEAD mice in
  traps. But that's part of his fun... Now tell me what kind of fun you've been
  having...'</p>

  <p>'Nothing nearly so exciting... The Wohlmanns gave a big party when the
  German cruiser came in... Lallieni's ill and Borignano's in charge... That
  Mrs. Gervase came over from Rio&mdash;seems to have more money than ever...
  There's a nice American you must meet&mdash;some job with the railways... the
  kind we like... The De Volvas have had a baby... Carucas did well in the
  local elections&mdash;they talk of him as the coming man&mdash;I hope not,
  because he's a crook... Mary Deakins now takes ballet lessons from a real
  Russian, if you please... I think that's about all.'</p>

  <p>'What about the Greiffenburgs?'</p>

  <p>'They're still here.'</p>

  <p>'And the Salcinets?'</p>

  <p>'They went home. A rather sad thing... She went a bit out of her
  mind.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not too surprised. She always hated HIM. I meant to warn you to be
  careful about her, but I'm sure you were.'</p>

  <p>'Were you careful about everybody?'</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;except that man in London who told me how much they thought of
  you. He said you were bound to get a Legation eventually. Fifty per cent
  seniority, he reckoned it, thirty per cent luck and ten per cent merit. He
  was a cynical old devil.'</p>

  <p>'It only adds up to ninety. What's the rest?'</p>

  <p>'I hoped you'd ask that. ME. The diplomat's wife. That's why I flirted
  with him. He's in the Government and could be quite useful.' She mentioned
  his name.</p>

  <p>Charles snorted. 'Good God, THAT fellow?'</p>

  <p>'Darling, you can't be particular these days. And really, I think I
  handled him rather well.'</p>

  <p>'I'm sure you did&mdash;you're a good man-handler. Remember the line in
  the Henry the Eighth film&mdash;Charles Laughton saying "The things I have
  done for England"?'</p>

  <p>'All right, Andy, you can do them for England&mdash;I'll do them for you.
  I don't really know whether you love me or not, but I know you get along with
  me pretty well, both in and out of bed, and from what I've seen of other
  people's marriages, that's as good as love&mdash;and rarer too.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps it is love, if you have it long enough.'</p>

  <p>'And if you've never had any other kind... But "man-handler"&mdash;I
  rather like that. It's a compliment.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Charles was happy. People observed it and said,
indulgently: 'He's got his
  Jane back and now just look at him. And look at her too.' It made them both
  more popular than ever, so that when a few months later they let it be known
  there was going to be a baby everyone felt sentimental and wondered if it
  meant they had tried before without success or had recently for the first
  time been trying.</p>

  <p>Severing said to Charles: 'I suppose you'll go home.'</p>

  <p>'Jane will and I know she'd like me to go with her this time.'</p>

  <p>'I'm sure Banky will understand. Too bad this isn't Washington&mdash; then
  you could both stay. I mean, because of the dual citizenship. Nice thing for
  a kid to start off with...'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The Coppermills had moved out of Burton Bridgwater by the
time Jane and
  Charles arrived in England. Jane thought she would prefer the country to
  London, so they rented a house near High Wycombe and paid several short
  visits to Beeching. Havelock greeted them hospitably and seemed excited at
  the prospect of becoming a grandfather. At seventy-five he was still upright
  and active, able to walk miles without tiring, and no less vigorous in some
  of his opinions. Politically he was now so far to the right that one wondered
  where he would or could emerge, for he had lost favour with most local Tories
  when he expounded the unfashionable argument that Mussolini had as much right
  to conquer Ethiopia as England had had to defeat the Boers. He called the
  League of Nations a hypocrisy and Anthony Eden a pecksniffian Galahad.
  Normally this sort of extremism would not have mattered much in a country
  addicted to almost unlimited free speech; but the barometer of English
  opinion, as of European and world opinion, was rather rapidly moving to
  stormy. Only for this reason Charles was concerned. His father's political
  views, whatever they were, seemed far less important than the fact that
  friendships and the tolerance of neighbours were being put to strain.</p>

  <p>One June Friday about two months before the birth was expected Charles and
  Jane set out from High Wycombe intending to spend a weekend at Beeching.
  Charles was enjoying himself with a new car, and they stopped for lunch in
  Oxford and walked a little around the colleges. With every discount as a
  Cambridge man, he still thought Oxford had been ruined as well as enriched by
  its automobile industry; always sensitive to noise, he wondered how an
  undergraduate of Queen's or Magdalen could ever work if his rooms faced that
  once tranquil curve of the High, along which traffic now passed in roaring
  procession. Jane said the place had given her a headache, but by the time
  they were on their way again and approaching the Cotswolds it was clear she
  was suffering from much more than that. At Beeching she felt worse, and
  during the night suffered severe pain. By mid-morning Dr. Somerville had
  diagnosed possible appendicitis and ordered her immediate removal to a
  hospital. Charles accompanied her in the ambulance, realizing as he watched
  her (she was already under sedatives) how unimaginable would be any disaster
  that separated them. Presently he learned that an operation was necessary and
  that there was some risk of losing the baby. A recommended London surgeon
  named Blainey was telephoned; he said he could arrive that evening by
  train.</p>

  <p>As the day progressed Charles grew increasingly anxious and was almost
  glad he did not have to put on an act in front of Jane&mdash;though if even
  half-conscious she would doubtless have seen through it. Yet he felt she
  could not possibly know what store he had set on fatherhood. People thought
  they had planned it, and he did not mind anyone thinking so; actually it had
  been accidental, not even consciously desired, yet afterwards a source of
  such encompassing joy that they both wondered why they had ever considered
  their lives too roving and unsettled for such an event. Somehow the baby,
  even unborn, had already turned wherever they lived into a home.</p>

  <p>Charles met Blainey&mdash;MR. Blainey, since he was a very distinguished
  surgeon and not a physician&mdash;at Stow Magna station and drove him to the
  hospital. Charles was favourably impressed by a first look at him&mdash;
  fiftyish, red-haired, slight in build, curtly polite. They did not talk much
  on the way and hardly at all about Jane. Charles had the professional man's
  reluctance to intrude on another professional man's field; he had suffered
  too often from the na veté of dinner partners who had discussed international
  affairs. At the hospital he waited while Somerville took Blainey to see Jane.
  Blainey was reticent afterwards; he merely confirmed the doctor's tentative
  diagnosis and said he had arranged for surgery at seven in the morning.</p>

  <p>'Seven?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Everything ready by then. You think that's terribly early?'</p>

  <p>'Oh no&mdash;on the contrary. I mean&mdash;if it's so urgent&mdash; '</p>

  <p>What he really meant was that he was already beginning to fret about the
  overnight delay, but Blainey went on, smiling: 'Don't worry&mdash;we surgeons
  are used to it. We don't keep Civil Service hours, you know.'</p>

  <p>Charles was puzzled for a second; then he realized it was not only
  Blainey's idea of a joke but Blainey's idea of the time for a joke. Oh,
  well... so he smiled back. Even the implication that he could properly be
  described as a civil servant hadn't its normal power to irritate him. He then
  had the sudden idea that Blainey should come to Beeching for a meal and a bed
  &mdash;much quieter and more comfortable than the nearest good hotel, and
  only a mile or two further. He made the suggestion, which the surgeon
  accepted nonchalantly; then he telephoned Cobb to prepare a room. It was
  eight o'clock before they were on the road, exchanging few remarks during the
  journey. But when they reached the lodge and had to slow down past the opened
  gates, Blainey remarked, peering out: 'Quite a place for your son to
  inherit.'</p>

  <p>'My... my SON...' echoed Charles, gathering his wits. 'You mean...' In
  exultation over what might be Blainey's oblique way of conveying reassurance
  he nearly steered the car off the gravel. 'Sure it'll be a son?' he added,
  forcing a smile before he found it need not be forced.</p>

  <p>'Try again if it isn't. Plenty of time.'</p>

  <p>Charles warmed further to the remark, though he hadn't much of the
  ancestral feeling for Beeching that Blainey was taking for granted. But he
  needed comfort and Blainey had given it. 'Too bad it's dark,' Charles said,
  ready to meet the wrong but hopeful assumption halfway. 'There's quite a view
  of the house from here.'</p>

  <p>'Any special reason why it's called Beeching? Is there a river where boats
  used to beach?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, it isn't THAT beaching&mdash;it's b-double e-c-h. Beech trees, I
  suppose. My father once talked about changing its name to suit his profession
  &mdash;he said he'd call it Loopholes... He being a lawyer.' (I too can joke
  at a time like this, was in his mind.)</p>

  <p>'Ha, ha... so if I ever live in one of these places I ought to call it
  Gallstones, eh?'</p>

  <p>They both laughed more than the humour deserved, and Charles felt quite
  cheerful when, a few minutes later, he led the surgeon into the dining-room
  and introduced him to Havelock, who had apparently delayed his own evening
  meal to give the welcome its fullest possible scope. Charles was also a
  little touched by evidences that during his absence the old man had been busy
  &mdash;a bottle of rather special claret and the table set more elaborately
  than Cobb would have done it without particular orders. They all drank sherry
  standing by the mantelpiece, then sat down to the soup. Charles was glad to
  let his father steer the conversation, which he did fluently and with tact,
  avoiding strictly medical territory yet touching near enough to bridge the
  interesting gulf between medicine and the law. It was quite fascinating, an
  interplay of really first-class minds; yet suddenly, between one sentence and
  another, Charles ceased to be fascinated and could only itch for the meal to
  finish so that Blainey could get to bed for a full night's sleep. With shock
  he realized it was already midnight. From then on what was left of the meal
  seemed to progress so slowly that Charles thought there might have been some
  upset in the kitchen till he verified that every minute was crawling like an
  hour. Finally Cobb entered with coffee.</p>

  <p>Blainey shook his head when Havelock passed the decanter of brandy.</p>

  <p>'It's good stuff, Blainey&mdash;very gentle... I wish you'd try it.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, all right.' Havelock filled liqueur glasses and had Cobb take them
  round.</p>

  <p>'As I was saying,' Havelock went on, 'the medical aspects of poisoning
  cases are so technical that the accused is often in danger of being tried by
  expert witnesses rather than by the court. Take the Marsh test for arsenic,
  for instance. How can a juryman possibly give the benefit of a doubt when a
  fellow like Spilsbury comes along and says there isn't any doubt? And yet, as
  every toxicologist knows, there ARE doubts&mdash;small ones, maybe, but
  doubts all the same&mdash;margins for error and admitted incalculables in
  every chemical test known to science.'</p>

  <p>'That's true, but on the other hand what would happen if Spilsbury were to
  give these doubts the place they would certainly have if he were lecturing to
  scientists instead of offering an opinion to a group of laymen? You'd simply
  never get a conviction&mdash;the jury, unused to the philosophic assessment
  of probabilities, would just acquit one poisoner after another.'</p>

  <p>'They might acquit a few more of the innocent.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, come now, I can't believe that many innocent victims go to the
  gallows.'</p>

  <p>'Can't you? Let me tell you of a case I had once&mdash;before your time
  &mdash;an insurance agent in Manchester...'</p>

  <p>Five more minutes of that. Charles did not want to seem either fidgety or
  ungracious, but he could not help saying, when a suitable pause occurred: 'I
  expect Mr. Blainey would like to get to bed...'</p>

  <p>Havelock nodded. 'Of course, of course. Any time he likes... But what
  about a nightcap, then we'll all turn in?... Busy day tomorrow... Cobb, we
  won't adjourn anywhere tonight&mdash;just leave the decanters on the
  table.'</p>

  <p>Charles hoped the surgeon would refuse any more drinks, but he did not do
  so, and his signal, though prompt, was not in time to stay Havelock's
  generous hand. 'I must lend you a book, Blainey&mdash;take it up with you
  when you go... case histories somewhat on the lines of the one we were
  talking about... Charles, fetch Winfield's Problems of Medico-Legal Practice
  &mdash;it's on the top shelf in the window alcove in the library.'</p>

  <p>Charles did not move, but forced a smile. 'I really don't think Mr.
  Blainey will want to read much tonight.'</p>

  <p>Blainey smiled also. 'And I know the book quite well, so don't
  bother.'</p>

  <p>'Then you'll remember,' Havelock continued, 'how Winfield attacks the
  medical evidence in the Seddon trial. There's no doubt that if Seddon hadn't
  given such a callous impression in court he'd have had a good chance of
  acquittal.'</p>

  <p>'What you mean, then,' answered Blainey, 'is that his counsel should have
  given him better advice as to how to behave. Blame the lawyers too.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, certainly. But I've cross-examined too many doctors not to know that
  a skilled opposing counsel can usually twist them any way he wants. Why not,
  after all? It isn't a doctor's job to learn the art of being cross-examined
  &mdash;which in my opinion is a much rarer art than that of cross-examining.
  That, of course, is where Spilsbury excels&mdash;and where he's most
  dangerous. He's the cleverest cross-examinee in the business.'</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid we're arguing in circles. First you say a doctor can be
  twisted any way a counsel wants&mdash;then you attack Spilsbury because he
  can't be&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I said an AVERAGE doctor&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'But surely the fault lies again with the lawyers. If their aim is to
  establish truth and not merely to win a case, why do they try to twist a
  doctor at all&mdash;he's generally an honest man who has no axe to grind
  &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'&mdash;or, in the case of a surgeon, no knife to sharpen, eh?' Havelock's
  eyes lit with a vivid excitement. 'I suppose the professional difference is
  even more jealously regarded than that between barrister and solicitor?...
  Try that whisky&mdash;it's practically a liqueur&mdash;if you're a
  connoisseur I think you'll like it... But to come back to this question of
  cross-examining the expert witness...'</p>

  <p>Charles leaned forward across the table. He did not know whether he was
  pale or flushed, but he knew that something had happened to his face&mdash;
  it was moving in a way he could not control, like a small tic. 'Look,' he
  muttered, and found his voice so weak that he had to project it as before an
  audience: 'Look, Mr. Blainey ought to sleep. Let me take him upstairs.'</p>

  <p>Blainey made a slightly staying gesture with his hand. 'It's all right
  &mdash;I'm in no great hurry. I had a nap on the train... What were you
  saying, Sir Havelock?' He sipped the Scotch and soda.</p>

  <p>Havelock's face was wholly animated. 'You must forgive my concern with the
  subject&mdash;perhaps it stems from an experience I once had in Wales. In
  those days the circuit judges...'</p>

  <p>Another ten minutes. The story ended and before Blainey could comment
  Havelock began another. Charles could endure it no longer. Stumbling to his
  feet he made his way round the table and stood above his father. His hands
  shook, he swayed, he had to press his words through an impairment of breath
  and lip-movement that made him hardly coherent. 'For God's sake, CAN'T YOU
  SHUT UP? Let the man go to bed. Don't you know what he's got to do tomorrow
  morning?' Then he broke off to lean against the table, straining for control
  and mumbling 'I beg your pardon, I beg your pardon' to nobody in
  particular.</p>

  <p>'My son is distraught,' said Havelock urbanely. 'I'm sure you'll excuse
  him. But it IS perhaps time to retire... I'll show you up to your room,
  Blainey&mdash;take your drink with you... Goodnight, Charles. Perfectly
  understandable. Get a good night's sleep yourself.'</p>

  <p>Blainey also said 'Goodnight' as he left with Havelock. Charles heard them
  climbing the stairs, still arguing. He did not want to see his father again
  if he should come down later, so he crossed the hall to the garden door and
  went outside. The open air seemed to calm him. He walked to a place where he
  could watch the windows of Blainey's room. They remained lighted for nearly
  an hour. Charles waited all this time, patiently, but with determination;
  then he re-entered the house and went to his own room. He knew he had made a
  considerable fool of himself, but that was a small worry compared with the
  other one. He did not think he could sleep, but in case he did he set the
  alarm for five. He intended then to get up and see that Blainey had coffee
  and that Farrow was ready with the car. But none of this happened. He lay
  sleepless till nearly dawn, then slept so heavily that he failed to hear the
  alarm, and when he woke it was nine o'clock. Dressing hurriedly he drove to
  the hospital, but the operation was over by then.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Charles insisted on driving Blainey back to the station at
Stow Magna.
  When they had left the hospital grounds the surgeon said: 'You really
  shouldn't be doing this&mdash;you look very tired. Somerville gave you the
  news, I daresay. The operation was quite successful and there's no reason why
  either your wife or child should be any the worse for it... Now take it easy
  &mdash;I'm nervous of other people's driving.'</p>

  <p>'I'm sorry,' Charles said, out of a deep dream of happiness. 'And I must
  also apologize for last night.'</p>

  <p>'Last night? What do you mean?'</p>

  <p>'Losing my head&mdash;or my temper&mdash;or something... What a way for a
  diplomat to behave&mdash;God, how Jane would laugh! I don't think I'll ever
  tell her what happened.'</p>

  <p>'Are you sure you REMEMBER what happened?'</p>

  <p>'I know, I must have been distraught, as my father said. All those stories
  of his&mdash;they lasted so long... He talks very well and I suppose he
  enjoys himself so much that even at a time like that he could forget&mdash;
  or seem to forget&mdash;more easily than I could.'</p>

  <p>Blainey said quietly: 'May I ask a very personal question?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, of course.'</p>

  <p>'Are you protecting him, or are you really in ignorance?'</p>

  <p>'I don't quite know what you mean.'</p>

  <p>'You were distraught last night because you were afraid I should stay up
  too late and perhaps drink too much&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I assure you I never&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Why not be frank about it? You thought your father was to blame for
  keeping me there, talking and drinking&mdash;and of course he was. But you
  also thought&mdash;or at least the thought crossed your mind&mdash;didn't
  it?&mdash;that he was DELIBERATELY doing all that?'</p>

  <p>'I&mdash;I don't know that I ever&mdash;actually&mdash;or if I did it
  was&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'All right, have it the way you want. It's what <i>I</i> thought,
  anyhow.'</p>

  <p>'That he&mdash;was&mdash;doing it&mdash;DELIBERATELY?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I've seen people in his condition before. It's a sort of dementia.
  Didn't you notice his arguments? For all their fluency, there was no logic in
  them&mdash;they just went round and round&mdash;his mind racing like a
  slipping clutch. If the brain had a temperature his would have been at fever
  heat.'</p>

  <p>'But I still don't see&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Well, never mind. You're a diplomat, as you said&mdash;you're trained not
  to see what you don't want to see&mdash;or else to pretend not to see what
  you do see.'</p>

  <p>Charles said heavily, after a pause: 'Yes, it's that. I'm sorry I wasn't
  frank. I've known he was like it for a long time. Is there anything one can
  do?'</p>

  <p>'Not much, I should think, at his age. Though I'm no expert in that
  field... Well, here's the station.'</p>

  <p>They talked of other matters on the platform and just before the train
  left Charles thanked him again, but rather sadly. He had learned nothing new
  about Havelock, but to hear it in words, clinically and for the first time,
  was a blow. When he got back to the house his mingled emotions, which
  included intense relief and a resurgence of happiness, also included a deeper
  sympathy with his father than he could remember. He did not quite know why
  that was. He found Havelock at his desk in the library pasting another insert
  into the Oxford Book of English Verse.</p>

  <p>'Hullo, Charles. Splendid news about Jane, I hear. Great fellow Blainey
  &mdash;how wise you were to have him!' He swung round, book in hand. 'Listen
  to this&mdash;a parody on the well-known poem by Landor...</p>

  <p>I strove with none, not even with my wife, You never saw me drunk or heard
  me swear; I never could get near the fire of life, So if it sinks or not, why
  should I care?</p>

  <p>Not bad, eh? I amuse myself with this sort of thing when I feel in the
  mood. Of course some of them come out a bit naughtier than that... But
  &mdash;er&mdash;well, I didn't FEEL naughty this morning. I was too anxious
  about Jane.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Jane's baby, a boy, was born in a London nursing home, and
as Blainey had
  forecast, all went well. Charles was ecstatic, and about the same time (as if
  to cap his good fortune) he was offered a European post so situated that it
  was natural for him to serve on one of those intermittent Balkan boundary
  commissions that never settle anything more than a few years before a major
  war unsettles everything. Charles had made himself an expert on this
  particular locality, and it was easy for him to consider the work he did on
  the commission the most valuable he had yet performed, as well as a likely
  stepping-stone to further promotion.</p>

  <p>Jane had agreed that after he settled down to Legation work again she
  would join him with the baby, and this she did, for it was a pleasant city
  and healthy except at the height of summer.</p>

  <p>Those were the years when (as Blainey might have said) a diplomat's
  training not to see what he did not want to see came in handy, for they were
  the years between Ethiopia and Munich.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Charles and Jane were now experienced in the diplomatic
world. They could
  begin 'When we were at So-and-So'&mdash;to match anyone else's stories with
  one of their own, and they had known several First Secretaries who had since
  become Ministers, and many Second Secretaries who had since become First
  Secretaries, and thus down the ladder. They were learned in the personal
  mythology behind the names in the Foreign Office List, and since they knew
  exactly how to behave to everybody (including visiting monarchs, local
  Foreign Ministers, and distinguished travellers) they could take quite a load
  off a Minister's or an Ambassador's shoulders, especially if he were old or
  slack, and Charles's new chief, Sir Morley Considine, was inclined to be
  both. The doyen of the corps, he was a charming relic of the old school whose
  gallantries were famous and sometimes a little foolish. There was a yarn that
  he had once had a Third Secretary transferred because he did not spring
  quickly enough to open the door when the ladies left the table at a dinner
  party; a footman should have been there to do it, but his negligence was no
  excuse for a Secretary's lapse. Sir Morley was, however, comparatively
  lenient with another Secretary who left the keys of the Chancery on a park
  bench where, by a remarkable coincidence (as Sir Morley always said), they
  were found by a distant relative of Sigmund Freud (though Sir Morley never
  explained just in what the coincidence consisted).</p>

  <p>They named the boy Gerald, after a Gerald Anderson in the seventeenth
  century who had become governor of a West Indian island (perhaps the most
  officially illustrious of all the Anderson ancestors); and Gerald spent most
  of his first two years in this foreign capital where he was admired and
  petted by women of all nationalities and nursed by a Frenchwoman who many an
  afternoon pushed him in a pram along a mile of tree-shaded boulevard to a
  kiosk where an old Italian sold citronnade. The old Italian would also touch
  and admire him, the swarthy mustachioed face beaming down so much more
  notably than his mother's or his father's or his nurse's that quite possibly
  it made a faint smudge on the first blank page of the child's memory.</p>

  <p>After Munich even diplomats could see ahead; they knew at least that war
  would come, and might come suddenly. For this reason Charles, who had sent
  Jane and Gerald back to England during the September crisis, was not anxious
  that Gerald should return, though Jane flew back and forth several times,
  leaving the child with her sister in Cheshire. It was a cluttered family
  arrangement, but the year that succeeded Munich was a cluttered year. Towards
  the end of it (in July 1939) Charles took leave, and was in London when war
  broke out.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">PARIS III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Thirteen years later Charles sat in a Paris taxi on Gerald's
  seventeenth birthday, and he no more knew where the taxi was going than where
  the world was going, but he supposed to the devil in one form or another. He
  could only indulge a mild hope that, if the taxi took him to where Gerald
  was, the form of the devil would be found agreeable, even if deplorable. For
  Charles had long since discovered that he was not really a moral man, in the
  too strict sense of the word, and that most of his qualms were no more than
  shrinkings of taste or expediency.</p>

  <p>The taxi squealed to a halt so suddenly that he thought at first it must
  be to avoid some accident. But no; the driver was merely pointing to a
  destination. 'Rocher's!' he snapped. 'Voilà!'</p>

  <p>Charles, catapulted from reverie, bestowed the fare and a handsome tip (a
  certain lavishness in this case being justifiable) while he blinked at the
  vari-coloured neon lights with which Rocher's, whatever it was, announced
  itself both to the passer-by and to the approacher from a distance.
  Rocher's... Certainly no place that he could remember... 'Rocher's,' he
  muttered, sizing up the neighbourhood. There was nothing particularly wrong
  with the neighbourhood, or right either; it was just a part of Paris he did
  not think he recognized. 'You saw him go in THERE?'</p>

  <p>The driver was emphatic about it.</p>

  <p>'With his suitcase?'</p>

  <p>'I carried it in for him, M'sieur.'</p>

  <p>'H'm... very well.'</p>

  <p>As he drove off the driver shouted raffishly: 'Restaurant sanitaire!
  Cuisine américaine!'</p>

  <p>Charles walked towards the entrance of Rocher's as into the lens of an
  unwelcome searchlight. It was certainly new since his day&mdash;in fact,
  there had never to his knowledge been anything in Paris quite like it. With a
  dazzling frontage on two streets it offered no privacy to its patrons, and
  its air of intense hygiene was equally un-Parisian. Tiled walls, marble
  floors, white-uniformed waitresses, all added up to something that made
  Charles wince. Then he realized it was ice-cream that was the speciality.
  Cuisine américaine indeed. And it was for this that Gerald had been eager to
  leave the Cheval Noir.</p>

  <p>Charles was peeved. He had been fully prepared to discover the boy in some
  haunt of depravity, or even to rescue him if the need should arise&mdash;he
  could have faced that sort of thing with resolution, and afterwards with a
  sense of humour&mdash;indeed, during the taxi journey he had already composed
  sentences of tolerant rebuke, ending in a confession that he, Charles, had
  been shrewd enough to suspect something of the sort all along... But THIS
  place&mdash;what COULD he say? He pushed his way through the swing-doors. The
  interior was hot, noisy, spotless, dazzling&mdash;and all of these things he
  hated except the spotlessness, which he thought was an excellent quality
  deserving of more decent concealment. His eyes and ears cringed to the
  assault of a nightmarish juke-box that hurled the loudest kind of jazz over
  innumerable conversations which, because of it, had to be shouted at close
  range. Prices were placarded on the walls, and Charles, who liked most things
  in life to be either expensive or economical, formed the opinion that
  Rocher's was neither. Waitresses as antiseptic as hospital nurses scurried
  amongst the tables; bartenders as proficient as pharmacists mixed their
  highly coloured concoctions in front of mirrors with an air of performing
  some cleansing rite. The whole establishment was about as
  obtrusive&mdash;and, to Charles, as appetising&mdash;as a barium meal he had
  once had to take when he thought he was developing an ulcer.</p>

  <p>Then he saw that Gerald was sitting at a table next to a huge uncurtained
  plate-glass window that faced the side street. A girl was with him. This did
  not startle or shock Charles at all&mdash;indeed, it confirmed his guess and
  relieved a little of his hurt. Both of them, anyhow, were sipping through
  straws out of tall glasses, their heads bent together in an absorption at
  least physical. Charles drew back sharply, aware of his own dubious position,
  for it was one thing to spy on his son with the moral advantage all on his
  side, but quite another to have trailed him to this den of gaudy innocence.
  Unfortunately he had already come too close; Gerald looked up.</p>

  <p>'DAD!' he exclaimed, flushing deeply.</p>

  <p>Charles was glad to observe the flush. It reminded him that the boy had,
  after all, told several deliberate untruths. So he smiled, as across a
  conference table. 'Well, Gerald... quite a surprise! So THIS is what tempted
  you to miss the boat-train!'</p>

  <p>Gerald gathered his wits with a dexterity which, even at such a moment,
  Charles had to concede. 'Dad, I want you to meet Miss Raynor... She and I
  played tennis together in Switzerland&mdash;she's leaving for America
  tonight. That's why we had to meet in a bit of a hurry... You see how it
  was?'</p>

  <p>Charles saw how it was, for he was looking at the girl, and it was
  actually her beauty that peeved him afresh, for he thought: Good God, if he's
  only got so little time with her, and in Paris of all cities, why does he
  want to spend it in a place like this? For Charles knew of so many other
  places...</p>

  <p>The girl was offering her hand. 'I'm so glad to meet you, Mr. Anderson. Do
  sit down. Gerry's told me a lot about you.'</p>

  <p>Charles had an opening to reply that this was all the more remarkable
  since Gerald had told him nothing about her, but he forbore to make the point
  at this stage, though undoubtedly it must come later. He was enjoying her
  voice&mdash;it was well modulated and pleasing. Moreover, her blonde hair
  delightfully matched her tanned face. She looked rather older than Gerald, in
  fact he was sure she was&mdash;in her early twenties, perhaps. Had she been
  of any other nationality than American he would have been certain, from her
  clothes and air, that she was rich.</p>

  <p>'So you're the one who helped him win the cup?' he said, admiring her.</p>

  <p>'He told you then?' Her laugh was pleasant also.</p>

  <p>Charles went on smiling. One thing the best part of a lifetime had taught
  him was to use a smile as an all-purpose stopgap when he didn't know what to
  say, but wanted to look wise, or when he hadn't decided what attitude to
  take, but wanted to look as if he had an entire campaign of behaviour mapped
  out in his mind. And of course he was not unaware that he had a rather
  engaging smile. So he protracted it now, deliberately allowing the
  conversation to lapse till he knew that Gerald would interpret his silence as
  a sign of reproof. Then he said, looking at the table: 'What's that you're
  both eating?'</p>

  <p>'Raspberry frappé?' the girl answered. 'Will you have one?'</p>

  <p>'I don't think you'd care for it, dad,' Gerald interposed, asking
  forgiveness through his solicitude.</p>

  <p>Charles declined the hint. 'Oh, but I might&mdash;you never can tell.
  Maybe it's like you with the sherry at dinner&mdash;something I could get
  used to.' He turned to the girl confidentially. 'I don't know if Gerald
  mentioned it, but he dined with me earlier this evening. I'd have asked him
  to bring you along had I been given the slightest hint that he was going to
  meet you later.' The reproof was still being roguishly administered.</p>

  <p>'That's very kind of you, Mr. Anderson. Why don't you try the frappé?'</p>

  <p>Charles gave the order, specifying that he wanted as few trimmings as
  possible. He made some little joke about this that sent the waitress away
  laughing. That relieved him too; they really were Parisiennes, under their
  extremely clinical disguise.</p>

  <p>'I wish I spoke French as well as that,' Miss Raynor commented.</p>

  <p>'But you don't have to,' said Gerald. 'They all speak English&mdash;or at
  least they understand it. Mostly English and Americans come here.'</p>

  <p>Charles could well believe it. 'So you're off home tonight?' he said,
  turning to the girl.</p>

  <p>'Yes, our trains leave almost together&mdash;Gerry's and mine.'</p>

  <p>'A pity you couldn't stay longer.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, isn't it? Gerry told me why YOU'RE here. He's very proud.'</p>

  <p>'PROUD?' echoed Charles. He honestly could not, for the moment, think of
  anything in his being in Paris that should make Gerald proud.</p>

  <p>'He thinks it's wonderful,' the girl continued, 'that you should be
  representing England.'</p>

  <p>Charles was torn between acute pleasure that his son had been boasting
  about him, and equally acute embarrassment at the phrasing of it.
  'Representing England', forsooth&mdash;as if he were taking part in some
  international Olympiad! Then it occurred to him that Gerald perhaps did think
  of it like that, and that since the boy enjoyed games, the athletic image was
  from him the sincerest compliment. Could it be that? He hoped so, but it
  brought him back to his abiding handicap; that he did not really understand
  Gerald. He knew the boy was no fool; he was doing well at Brookfield. But
  what was Gerald beginning to learn about LIFE? Or rather, what sort of life
  was it that Gerald was beginning to learn about? By that Charles sadly meant:
  How much&mdash;or how little&mdash;have I and my son in common? It was hard
  to attempt an answer. For he, Charles, was what could be called a man of the
  world, but a man of a world that had already died or was dying; no boy of
  Gerald's generation could grow up to be a man of such a world... What other
  world, then, was Gerald's, and was it, or would it ever be&mdash;
  occasionally&mdash;as enchanting? Gerald certainly seemed to be having a good
  time in it, but that was not quite the same as feeling sure that times were
  good in it. There had been moments in Charles's life when he had had this
  feeling. He was still pondering on the problem when the tall glass with its
  pink contents was set before him. He discovered then how correct had been
  Gerald's forecast. He would be unable to manage more than a small portion of
  the stuff, though&mdash;to be frank&mdash;it was better than some of the
  desserts he had tasted at diplomatic receptions.</p>

  <p>But he had conquered his peevishness and was now no more than quietly at
  odds with life&mdash;a sensation so familiar that he had learned every
  technique of coming to terms with it. He said, in a friendly way: 'So you've
  been enjoying Switzerland, Miss Raynor?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, very much. It was my first visit since I was at school in
  Berne.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, Berne... a charming city.'</p>

  <p>'You know it?'</p>

  <p>'Very well. I was en poste there for a couple of years. Perhaps the
  world's luckiest capital, unless you vote for Stockholm.'</p>

  <p>'What about Washington?'</p>

  <p>'It didn't quite miss two world wars.'</p>

  <p>'But no air-raids&mdash;one doesn't see all the bombed ruins.'</p>

  <p>'Nor does one in Paris or Rome.'</p>

  <p>'But in London.'</p>

  <p>'London, I grant you.'</p>

  <p>'Were you in London during any of them?'</p>

  <p>'Raids?... Oh yes.'</p>

  <p>'Were they very bad? I suppose that's a na ve question&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'They were quite bad enough, though not nearly the kind of thing the
  German cities got towards the end of the war. Dresden, for instance.'</p>

  <p>She said musingly: 'How much easier it is to feel pity for cities than for
  countries.'</p>

  <p>He nodded. 'That's because cities seem like people&mdash;lovable and
  helpless and innocent. Whereas countries stand for governments&mdash;cold and
  strong and always a bit guilty. Of course the whole notion's false, but it
  suits the mythology of the times.'</p>

  <p>'That's a rather calm and detached way of looking at it.'</p>

  <p>He was suddenly aware that they were talking beyond the scope of mere
  acquaintance and that Gerald had relapsed into a rather prolonged silence.
  Charles had so often in his own youth been the victim of such a situation
  that he was specially anxious for it not to happen to Gerald, so he looked
  for a chance to bring him back into the conversation. Fortunately Miss Raynor
  gave it when she added: 'Were you as calm and detached during the raids?'</p>

  <p>He answered: 'CALM? My dear Miss Raynor, there's only one word for what I
  was. I was SCARED. So scared I packed Gerald off to some friends in
  Connecticut immediately.' He smiled and looked to Gerald for confirmation.
  'Didn't I?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, but you stayed in London, dad.'</p>

  <p>Charles caught a note in Gerald's voice that gave him an instant
  bewildering satisfaction. So the boy WAS proud of him, however absurdly? That
  was something. Something to build on. Something that would perhaps help to
  unsnarl the father-son relationship. It helped him now to answer cheerfully:
  'What else could I do? My job was there. Otherwise I'd have been off like a
  shot.' He half turned to the girl again. 'But actually it wasn't as bad as
  some Americans may have pictured it. I think perhaps we overdid the publicity
  on your side.' Yes, he liked her. She was charming and intelligent. 'You see,
  we wanted you to feel sorry for us because we hadn't time to be sorry for
  ourselves. We were so damned busy we didn't know what we'd been through till
  it was all over.'</p>

  <p>'TILL IT WAS ALL OVER'</p>

  <p>The autumn of 1939 brought the phony war and the song that so dismally
  suited it&mdash;the one about hanging out the washing on the Siegfried Line.
  As a visible symbol of the same period there was the portable boxed gas-mask,
  never used, emblem of false preparedness as well as a preposterous
  nuisance.</p>

  <p>Charles had sent Jane and Gerald to the country (Jane's sister's house on
  the outskirts of a small Cheshire town) as soon as war was declared. He
  joined her at weekends, but preferred to spend the other days in London,
  meeting people and trying to learn what was really happening. It was a time
  when being officially on leave meant little; one looked around for some
  emergency use for oneself. Charles found none. Many men of his age and of
  equal status were similarly preoccupied. No older than the century, he was
  clearly young enough for most kinds of service, and though he did not imagine
  he could be usefully employed against the Siegfried Line, he would go
  anywhere and do anything if anybody in authority suggested it. Of course
  nobody did. At the Foreign Office it was assumed there would be plans for him
  by the time his leave was finished, but the Office was in a polite chaos
  owing to the return of so many personnel from enemy territory. Charles spent
  long lunch-times at his club talking to other men equally stranded and
  restive.</p>

  <p>One day towards the end of his leave he was summoned by a Private
  Secretary named Gosford. It was a dark morning; a yellowish fog totally
  obscured the trees of St. James's Park and Gosford himself seemed
  electrically bright behind the desk as he swivelled round to shake Charles's
  hand. He had had a career of such sensational brilliance that though he was
  Charles's junior by several years, the pages of Who's Who supplied an
  accurate measure of comparison&mdash;almost half a column as against barely
  an inch. Yet, of course, in an Etonish All Souls' fashion, he was friendly
  enough, if that be considered friendly at all. Charles knew, respected, and
  only slightly disliked the type.</p>

  <p>'How are you, Anderson?... Sit down... Smoke?... God, what a day! Don't
  you wish you were basking on the Copacabana beach?'</p>

  <p>Charles's South American post had not been Rio, but he did not think it
  worth while to make the correction. He smiled, took the proffered cigarette,
  and murmured congratulation on Gosford's recent K.C.M.G. Gosford replied
  deprecatingly: 'Oh, well...' and then, to add tartness to the flavour: 'I
  suppose they just had to after Pelham-Frobisher got one.' Charles knew
  Pelham-Frobisher as an official in the Treasury, but that was all; he
  supposed the joke lay in some inter-office politics of which his absence had
  made him ignorant.</p>

  <p>Presently Gosford lit a cigarette himself and studied Charles through the
  smoke. 'You're living in London now, Anderson?'</p>

  <p>'At my club for the time being. My wife's in Cheshire with the boy.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, very sensible... You don't go to your family place then&mdash;let me
  see, isn't it Beeching?'</p>

  <p>Charles wondered how Gosford had known or why he had bothered to find out.
  'Yes, I go fairly often.'</p>

  <p>'Your father live there still?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>Gosford swivelled another twenty degrees till his face was cut into layers
  of light and shadow by the green-shaded desk lamp at eye-level. 'I'd like to
  ask you a few questions about Sir Havelock if you don't mind. Rather personal
  questions.'</p>

  <p>'Certainly. What's he been up to now?' This slipped out, as perhaps it
  should not have done from a trained diplomat, yet it was useful sometimes to
  give rein to the functions of an equally trained subconscious, and Charles,
  as soon as he had spoken the words, was not wholly regretful.</p>

  <p>Gosford picked up the cue as Charles had known he would. 'Oh? Does he
  often&mdash;er&mdash;misbehave?'</p>

  <p>'He can be rather naughty&mdash;at times.'</p>

  <p>They were both fencing with these words of innocence.</p>

  <p>'What ARE some of the things he's been up to?'</p>

  <p>Charles thought a moment. 'I think the last was a mousetrap that didn't
  kill the mice but kept them imprisoned so that he could release them
  afterwards... He had to drop it&mdash;the servant problem was quite hard
  enough at Beeching.'</p>

  <p>Gosford smiled faintly. 'Are you on good terms with him?'</p>

  <p>'Personally, yes. Of course I don't see eye to eye with all his opinions
  and enthusiasms.'</p>

  <p>'Has he visited Germany recently?'</p>

  <p>Charles was startled by the question, but also puzzled.</p>

  <p>'I don't know that he ever has. For the last ten years he hasn't been
  anywhere out of England; that I'm certain of.'</p>

  <p>'What does he do with his life&mdash;at Beeching&mdash;so far as you
  know?'</p>

  <p>'He has hobbies. Some of them a bit eccentric, but not all. Old
  tombstones. Latin inscriptions. Ornithology. Writes to The Times?</p>

  <p>'He likes letter writing?'</p>

  <p>'I'd say he must.'</p>

  <p>'Well, he's in real trouble about it now. He's been sending letters to
  Hitler and Goebbels.'</p>

  <p>After all the preliminaries the gist of the thing came out like that, in a
  simple sentence, for Gosford had a technique of his own. Charles countered it
  by underplaying his reaction. 'Oh dear,' he said, in the manner of an old
  lady who has dropped her knitting. Then he added, establishing a small line
  of resistance: 'I deplore his taste, but surely until September that was no
  crime?'</p>

  <p>'He's been trying to communicate since, through a known German spy in
  Bucharest.'</p>

  <p>Charles was shocked and silent.</p>

  <p>Gosford watched him for a moment, then continued: 'Of course our
  Intelligence has been intercepting it all&mdash;they're not QUITE such
  fools... Does all this surprise you&mdash;or doesn't it?'</p>

  <p>Charles answered carefully: 'Nothing about my father surprises me very
  much, but he's an old man, almost eighty, and I know him well enough to feel
  sure that any correspondence he's been having with Hitler and Goebbels is a
  waste of time... and I mean THEIR time.'</p>

  <p>Gosford opened a desk drawer and took out a file. 'Care to look at some of
  the letters?'</p>

  <p>Charles spent the next ten minutes reading them and pretending to be still
  reading when actually he was thinking. They were photostatic copies. Those
  from Havelock were in his undisguised handwriting and on Beeching note-paper.
  In brief&mdash;and considering the magnitude of the subject they WERE brief
  &mdash;they told the Germans what to do to clean up the world. They also
  assured their addressees of Havelock's personal admiration and that they
  could count on him as a supporter of any English movement similar to theirs.
  The English government was denounced as effete and the English people as ripe
  for dictatorship if a strong man should arise, and there was a definite hint
  that in default of any other suitable candidate Havelock would not consider
  himself too old for the job.</p>

  <p>The return letters were fewer and shorter. Neither Goebbels nor Hitler had
  sent any, but those of underlings were non-committally flattering and one of
  them mentioned a source that would supply the names of other Germanophile
  Englishmen with whom Havelock might care to make contact. It looked as if the
  Nazis had been only mildly impressed by Havelock as an Englishman of title
  and substance who might just conceivably be worth cultivating&mdash;a small
  possible cog in the machinery of the master plan.</p>

  <p>Charles handed back the letters with a close concealment of his concern.
  'I still say he's wasting their time.'</p>

  <p>Gosford put the letters back in the drawer. Then he contemplated the
  yellow windows that were getting yellower. Already the fog had percolated
  into the room so that one could hardly see the full-length portrait of some
  eighteenth-century statesman above the marble mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>'You know, Anderson, we English have missed the tremendous test of armed
  invasion for a couple of centuries or so, and this immunity has led us to
  indulge in the most comforting and therefore the most dangerous illusion
  &mdash;that we're fundamentally different from other people. I don't believe
  we are. I don't believe an Englishman can jump off a cliff without falling. I
  don't believe that a hostile army, if strong enough, couldn't land here, or
  that if it did, it would find no Englishman ready to co-operate... So you see
  how interesting these letters are&mdash;especially the one that mentions a
  source from which certain other names can be obtained.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I see that.'</p>

  <p>'Of course we know that source and we have those names.'</p>

  <p>'IMPORTANT names?'</p>

  <p>'I'm sure it would surprise you if I told you.'</p>

  <p>Charles did not ask for an elucidation, because he guessed that so donnish
  a speaker as Gosford would not be equivocal except deliberately. Gosford
  suddenly got up and paced across the room. 'You see where this leads us,
  Anderson? If the government has to start making arrests, it might be
  difficult not to include Sir Havelock.'</p>

  <p>'I see that too. Though perhaps on account of his age&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'A point certainly. Of course it's all outside my province except so far
  as it concerns your own immediate future. It would be a pity if you were in a
  position to be embarrassed by anything unpleasant that might occur.'</p>

  <p>Charles nodded, and out of the bitterness of his heart answered: 'Yes, it
  would be embarrassing to be at a reception in a neutral capital when the
  B.B.C. announces the arrest of one's father for high treason.'</p>

  <p>Gosford gestured slightly against this dramatization. 'Please understand
  I'm not forecasting any such thing. When does your leave expire?'</p>

  <p>'The twenty-fifth.'</p>

  <p>Gosford made a note on his desk pad. 'I ought to be able to tell you more
  before then. Don't do anything yet.'</p>

  <p>'What CAN I do? Seems to me I'm pretty helpless... Perhaps, though, I
  ought to tackle my father&mdash;find out at least if he realizes how serious
  it is. Any objection?'</p>

  <p>'<i>I</i> have none. And I don't see why...' Gosford stopped pacing and
  put an arm on Charles's shoulder. He became human and the humanity made him
  sixth-formish. 'Look, Anderson, this is the damnedest situation. Your
  father's probably being watched, and there's nowhere he can run to even if he
  tried, so what harm can it do to talk to him all you want? He may have done
  nothing at all but just write letters. On the other hand, these are
  incalculable times and there are circumstances that might arise... a
  parachute landing, for instance. What would he do in such a case? Do YOU
  know? Does anybody know? That's the sort of problem the authorities are up
  against.'</p>

  <p>Charles suddenly thought of the Tunnel of Love, with his father popping
  out of the canvas chute on to the lawn. The thought gave him ease to meet
  Gosford's greater cordiality with his own as he answered: 'You mean what
  would he do if German parachutists came down on his land at Beeching? Well,
  he might shoot them if he had a gun and they didn't shoot him first. Or he
  might ask them into the house and offer them brandies and soda. Or he might
  recite them a poem he'd just composed... That's the sort of problem I'M up
  against.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Charles found his father in quite a rollicking mood;
wartime excited him,
  and local hostility (for he had made no secret of his political views) did
  not make him unhappy. His whole life, since the age of forty, had been a
  training to accept the penalties of disfavour, and this was only the climax
  of it, all the more endurable because at such an age many things become
  easier, to compensate for many others that become harder.</p>

  <p>When Charles began, without much preamble: 'I'm afraid, father, you've got
  yourself in a considerable mess'&mdash;something flicked across his memory;
  it was Havelock, two decades before, making almost the same remark, though in
  sharper accents, on that last day of Charles's last term at Cambridge.
  <i>'You were in a damned mess and I got you out of it.'</i> Perhaps if
  Charles could have added the second half of the sentence he might also have
  copied the sharper accents; as it was he could give no such assurance and
  therefore spoke quietly. He just told Havelock what had happened, without
  elaboration or drama.</p>

  <p>Even after long experience there was never any certainty how his father
  would take things. This time Charles had been prepared for an outburst, some
  tremendous diatribe against England, the government, democracy, and all they
  stood for; but instead Havelock merely shrugged and poured himself more port.
  'All right then. They can jail me. I've jailed plenty in my time. One thing,
  though, I won't need counsel. I'll defend myself.' It was clear from his eyes
  that he was already composing a great speech from the dock. Charles was ready
  to deflate this mood. In fact for some time deflation had been his familiar
  weapon in dealing with his father's ebullitions; it had proved better than
  indignation or censure, and was specially suited to Charles's own
  temperament. He had long ago ceased to hope that his father could be reformed
  or would ever become much different; the problem, therefore, was to come to
  terms with an insolubility. Charles had often found himself in a similar
  position in regard to some professional issue, but if one accepted from the
  outset the philosophic idea that certain problems in life (as in mathematics)
  MIGHT be insoluble, it was easier to tackle them, to shirk them, to pretend
  they did not exist, or by starving them of attention to find one day that
  they had solved themselves. Charles, therefore, tried to regard his father as
  something like the Macedonian Problem to those who lived in Macedonia; and it
  was comforting then to reflect that many people living in Macedonia were
  doubtless completely unaware that there was such a thing.</p>

  <p>So he said now, pricking the bubble as he saw it expand: 'I wouldn't count
  on them letting you make any speech. If you've done nothing but write a few
  stupid letters they'll probably never even bring you to trial. You're just
  the small fish that gets into the net with the big fish, but they can't let
  you out till they've hauled in the catch.'</p>

  <p>Havelock didn't like that. 'I don't know that I'm such a small fish.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, come now, it's a bit late in life for you to make history&mdash; even
  as a traitor. Don't imagine you're a Colonel Lynch or a Roger Casement.'</p>

  <p>'That's not very civil, Charles.'</p>

  <p>'What do you expect from me&mdash;congratulations?'</p>

  <p>'Of course I know you don't agree with my views.'</p>

  <p>'I not only don't agree with them, but if I knew any real evidence that
  you were seriously mixed up with the Germans I'd hand you over to the
  authorities myself. But of course I know you're relatively harmless.'</p>

  <p>'Charles, that's not a nice thing to say.'</p>

  <p>'Well, aren't you?' And with a sort of impish derision Charles continued:
  'For instance, there's all this talk of Germans landing by parachute.
  Supposing one of them did, on your front lawn, what would you do? Not what
  would you say&mdash;or write&mdash;but what would you DO?'</p>

  <p>Havelock pondered a moment, then his eyes lit feverishly. 'You know what?
  I think I'd telephone the police and have them send old Daggett. That
  fellow's been so officious lately about blackout curtains it would teach him
  a lesson. I'll bet he'd run if he even SAW a German!'</p>

  <p>Charles was handicapped by his sense of humour at a moment like this,
  however serious he knew the matter to be; but he forced himself to clear up
  one detail that still puzzled. 'How was it,' he asked, 'that you had the name
  and address of a German spy in Roumania?'</p>

  <p>'Professor Fontanescu? I didn't know he was a German spy. I just asked him
  to forward a letter through the German Legation there. Mere courtesy, after
  all. He was the man you asked me to write to about the Red-necked Phalarope.
  Don't you remember?'</p>

  <p>Charles remembered. He had met the Professor once at a Bucharest
  reception, and learning he was an ornithologist had thought it might interest
  his father to be put in touch with a brother enthusiast. That was all.</p>

  <p>'You know, Charles,' Havelock continued reproachfully, 'if this fellow was
  a German spy, you really ought to have warned me. You were on the spot out
  there... Isn't it the sort of thing you diplomatic people should have been
  aware of?'</p>

  <p>It certainly was; but they hadn't.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Charles went to see Gosford the next day and reported the
conversation,
  adding lamely: 'You may find it hard to believe, especially about Professor
  Fontanescu and the Red-necked Phalarope, and I daresay there's not likely to
  be any corroboration except from my father himself&mdash;and even he might
  not be in a mood to give it.'</p>

  <p>Gosford was cool. 'This isn't much of a time for having moods.'</p>

  <p>'I know that very well.'</p>

  <p>'Or even for believing things that are hard to believe. Sir Havelock,
  after all, had a legal training&mdash;he must have known that to communicate
  with the enemy in wartime by ANY method would constitute an offence.'</p>

  <p>'I agree that he must have known.'</p>

  <p>'Yet what you tell me now seems&mdash;almost&mdash;as if you were trying
  to establish some degree of innocence?'</p>

  <p>Charles paused unhappily, then nodded. 'Yes, that's so. Some degree of
  innocence. It's curious you should have used the phrase. Some degree of
  wickedness, but also some degree of innocence. That's my father all
  over.'</p>

  <p>'I don't think it can really affect the situation much.'</p>

  <p>'Probably not. Which is why I've written a letter of resignation. Here it
  is... for use if and when.' Charles placed it on the desk. It was in an
  unsealed envelope and he paused in case Gosford wanted to read it. When there
  was no move to do so, Charles continued: 'That's about all, except one thing
  &mdash;the result of some thought during a rather sleepless night... It seems
  to me my father oughtn't to be at a place like Beeching nowadays. Not only
  because of parachutists. He's talked as well as written foolish things
  &mdash;there's quite a bit of local feeling against him. I think he'd be
  better off in or near London where he can be&mdash;not exactly under my
  surveillance, because I suppose I'll have some kind of work to do somewhere
  &mdash;but at least I can keep a more frequent eye on him than in the
  country... I don't know how far it can help matters, but it might... and
  perhaps, if I'm lucky, it will...'</p>

  <p>Charles spoke the last words with difficulty. He had been hoping the
  letter of resignation would be refused, but Gosford had already put it in his
  pocket without reading it. Now Gosford got up as if to signify that there was
  nothing else to be discussed, no promise he could ask for or give, nothing
  more to do but let events take their course. All he said was: 'I assure you,
  Anderson, there are times when I feel tempted to resign myself.'</p>

  <p>Charles did not think the remark either sincere or sensible, but a few
  days later when Gosford died suddenly of a heart attack, he remembered it. By
  that time the letter of resignation must have been passed to higher levels
  &mdash;unless, through deliberation or neglect, Gosford had kept it in his
  desk. In the latter event it would be there for his successor to handle. Yet
  his successor, when in due course he met and talked with Charles, did not
  mention it; so Charles didn't either. And in the meantime there came for him
  an official transfer to the Foreign Office.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Charles stayed in London, waiting for something he thought
might happen at
  any time. It was like picking steps across a snow slope under cliffs that at
  any moment could dislodge an avalanche. The simile pleased him with its
  memories of happier days and its assurance of belonging still to at least one
  kind of an élite. He found a flat in Kensington, not far from his own in
  Chelsea, and established his father there with Cobb to look after him. None
  of the other Beeching servants wanted to come to London and Charles did not
  blame them. But Cobb was devoted to the old man, and Havelock undoubtedly
  returned an emotion of some sort. Since he was apt to treat his friends with
  far less consideration than most of them would a butler, it could well be
  said that he treated Cobb like a friend.</p>

  <p>Charles told his father the reason for the move, and met with no
  objections. The fact that the government could think of him as a potential
  threat to national security seemed only to gratify Havelock's ego, and much
  as he disliked the attitude Charles was glad of it as an aid to making the
  transition easier.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Jane and Gerald stayed in Cheshire, where Charles joined them
  whenever he could, but this was not very often or regularly. There was
  pressure of business at the Office, and most evenings he worked late.</p>

  <p>Early in the new year, 1940, Havelock was approached by a man who wanted
  to buy Beeching. Charles took him for a business man of some kind, and
  assumed that the rather high price he offered was either folly or the measure
  of his anxiety to move his family out of the likely area of air-raids.
  Neither Havelock nor Charles would entertain the idea at first; then all at
  once it began to seem attractive. Beeching was run down; it needed extensive
  repairs that could not be made till the war was over; the upkeep was
  wasteful, war work and enlistments had taken most of the staff, and there
  were tax considerations that made a sale more advantageous than it might ever
  be again. So Havelock sold Beeching. A few months later Charles learned that
  government engineers were laying out a huge airfield that took in most of the
  land, with the house left standing but derelict just beyond the end of a
  runway; but he could never discover exactly how much profit had been made on
  the resale.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In the drawing-room of his sister-in-law's house Charles
would exchange
  news with Jane when he arrived there for a few days. The style of
  conversation was the same, but how different the items from those of earlier
  years. A First Secretary in a foreign capital in peacetime had been in some
  sort of swim; a minor Foreign Office official visiting his wife and child in
  an English country town during the phony war was in a backwater almost as
  stagnant as the war itself. Only family affection could compensate for the
  tedious train journey; but Charles was always thus compensated.</p>

  <p>'Gerald looks well, Jane&mdash;I swear he's an inch taller than when I saw
  him last.'</p>

  <p>'Probably. He's found a new playmate&mdash;the Grandison girl who lives at
  the stone house past the bridge.'</p>

  <p>'Grandison?'</p>

  <p>'They're a leading family here&mdash;own the local picture theatre amongst
  other things, so Gerald gets in free whenever he wants.'</p>

  <p>'Fine. I'm glad he's so happy... Grandison, did you say?'</p>

  <p>'I know&mdash;you're thinking of the Grandison who used to be our pet
  Attaché. I don't believe he's any relative.'</p>

  <p>'Wonder what happened to him. I'll look up the List when I get back... How
  are Birdie and Tom?' (Jane's sister and her husband.)</p>

  <p>'Tom thinks he'll be sent to India. Birdie's worrying about it.'</p>

  <p>'Not a bad place to miss the war in.'</p>

  <p>'We're missing it so far here.'</p>

  <p>'Till it starts.'</p>

  <p>'But for Gerald I'd rather live in London whatever happens.'</p>

  <p>'I get more comfort thinking of you here.'</p>

  <p>'How's Havelock?'</p>

  <p>'In great shape. He did an amusing thing the other day&mdash;he left the
  flat in the morning and took the first on the right and then the first on the
  left and so on till the middle of the afternoon. By that time he was
  somewhere round Muswell Hill&mdash;at least that's what he said. Then he came
  back by bus.'</p>

  <p>'Why is it so amusing?'</p>

  <p>'Because of the idea of anyone following him&mdash;if he still is being
  followed. They'd probably put some old chap on the job&mdash;after all,
  keeping an eye on a man of eighty wouldn't seem much&mdash;and then he does a
  seven-mile walk all across London to nowhere! Just struck me as a bit
  funny... But he probably isn't being followed.'</p>

  <p>'You think they won't do any more about the letters?'</p>

  <p>'They haven't done anything yet.'</p>

  <p>'Except upset your career.'</p>

  <p>'You mean the transfer to the F.O.?' (He hadn't told her about his letter
  of resignation&mdash;time enough to worry her if and when it had to be used.)
  'That might have happened anyway.'</p>

  <p>'I don't think it would in your case&mdash;at least not for long. You were
  so high up on the List and I'm sure they had something good for you.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps they still have.'</p>

  <p>'Not till this business about the letters blows over.'</p>

  <p>'Well, it will... let's hope.'</p>

  <p>'Providing he doesn't send any more.'</p>

  <p>'I think I can guarantee that. Cobb watches him&mdash;it's more feasible,
  in the small flat. I see him too for a short time most evenings.'</p>

  <p>'As if you hadn't enough to do nowadays.'</p>

  <p>'He's often quite good company.'</p>

  <p>'You're very tolerant, Charles.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I look at it this way&mdash;quite apart from his being my father
  &mdash;I sometimes think when he's at his best&mdash;not being too eccentric,
  that is&mdash;suppose we'd met him at some big party&mdash;as a stranger...
  we'd both come home afterwards and talk about him. We'd say, Who WAS that
  man?&mdash;not just his name, but WHO? He's a WHO... and you can't say that
  of everybody.'</p>

  <p>'Not even of everybody you like.'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'And you CAN say it&mdash;sometimes&mdash;of people you don't like.'</p>

  <p>Charles accepted the implication, then answered: 'I don't blame you, Jane.
  I daresay you feel that but for him we'd be having a much pleasanter time
  somewhere else.' An obscure desire to take her side in the argument made him
  continue: 'Yes... think of Viña del Mar in February&mdash;the Cavalhos giving
  a party at that Chinese restaurant overlooking the sea. Not that I was ever
  terribly keen on the Cavalhos... or on Chinese food either.'</p>

  <p>'Andy... tell me something, will you?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, of course.'</p>

  <p>'What happened at Beeching the night before I had the operation?'</p>

  <p>Charles's face acquired the sudden protective blandness which he was
  afraid she knew only too well.</p>

  <p>'What happened? Why, nothing... What do you mean?'</p>

  <p>'During dinner.'</p>

  <p>'Dinner. Let's see, I don't think we had dinner&mdash;it was more a sort
  of supper&mdash;very late. Blainey was there&mdash;I'd met him at the
  station...' He was stalling for time, of course. Since only three persons
  could have told her anything (Havelock, Blainey and Cobb) he did not think
  she could possibly know the whole story; but she clearly knew something, and
  he wanted to find out how much before he gave his own answer. It was a
  familiar situation in diplomacy, though Jane, being equally familiar with it,
  unfortunately knew all its tricks. He waited for her to speak while she too
  waited for him. Presently he said: 'If you tell me what's on your mind, I
  could better try to remember, perhaps...'</p>

  <p>'I just wondered what had happened.'</p>

  <p>'But why should you think anything had happened?'</p>

  <p>'When I saw Blainey weeks afterwards, just before Gerald was born, he
  asked me how I liked Havelock. I don't think he would have, in the way he
  did, unless he'd formed an odd impression himself, and as he'd only seen him
  that one time at dinner, I wondered what had happened.'</p>

  <p>Jane always told the truth, though she did not always tell all the truth,
  and Charles felt reasonably certain now that she knew nothing definite, but
  had merely been made shrewdly suspicious by a question that Blainey had put
  rather na vely. So he answered, with confidence: 'Oh, I wouldn't doubt that
  Blainey got an odd impression&mdash;did anyone meeting my father ever get
  anything else? All I remember is that we talked a lot&mdash;nervous tension
  &mdash;on my part, anyhow. Matter of fact Havelock would have kept Blainey up
  all night if I'd let him&mdash;got in one of his reminiscent moods about law
  cases&mdash;you know how he is at those times... I think the tension affected
  us all.' Charles had often found that to tell the truth, casually and
  unimportantly, is a very effective substitute for a lie, with the additional
  advantage that it never requires retraction afterwards. Having told the truth
  in this way, he put in a little further probing of his own. 'A pity surgeons
  are always so busy. I'd like to see Blainey again. Did he say what HE thought
  of Havelock?'</p>

  <p>'He said "You've got a rum fellow for a father-in-law".'</p>

  <p>'That all? I'd call it a mild diagnosis... And then what did YOU say?'</p>

  <p>'I said I knew I had.'</p>

  <p>Charles laughed. 'If this damned war ever gets over, let's ask Blainey to
  dinner... God, it would be something to live a civilized life again, wouldn't
  it? Not that it's too bad in London&mdash;putting on a tin hat once a week
  and having drinks in pubs. Our friends abroad should see me. I often wonder
  whether some of the German Secretaries and Attachés we used to meet are doing
  the same in Berlin... Talk about rum fellows&mdash;it's a rum world
  altogether...'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Six months later the word 'rum' was hardly one that an
Englishman would
  have chosen&mdash;with Scandinavia, the Low Countries and France already
  victims, German armies just across the Channel, and the first air-raids on
  London beginning. Charles did his duty ON as well as beneath the roofs of
  Whitehall, and of the many exciting moments that came to him a few were
  fairly unpleasant.</p>

  <p>Early one dark morning, as he was leaving his fire-watching post after the
  'all clear' sounded, he learned of an emergency summons for extra helpers in
  a certain street in Notting Hill where a large bomb had fallen. With others,
  he responded. When he got there he found that several five-storied houses had
  collapsed into rubble, under which were buried numerous victims, some of whom
  might still be alive. Rescue squads were already at work, boring and digging
  and passing out baskets of brick and plaster. Charles took a place in the
  line, and presently volunteered when a call was made for someone thin enough
  to crawl beneath a beam towards an elderly man who was pinned down under a
  mass of debris. Charles reflected as he did so that he wasn't really so thin;
  it was the other fellows who just happened to be stouter. He worked for
  perhaps an hour, scrabbling bricks out of the mess and passing them behind
  him. He was getting closer to the man, but still not close enough to do
  anything for him. Not having had experience of this sort of thing before, he
  kept thinking he was slower than anyone else would have been, and this
  spurred him to extra exertion. From sounds outside he judged that the raiders
  had returned and were dropping more heavy stuff in the neighbourhood. The man
  who was pinned down groaned quietly from time to time; presently the groaning
  stopped. By the time Charles finally reached him he was dead. There was no
  point then in continuing to work at that particular place, so Charles
  withdrew from the hole and went to help somewhere else. This went on till
  past dawn. He worked in a vacuum of sensation, not feeling any of the
  expectable emotions&mdash;neither fear of the still falling bombs, nor pity
  for the dead and injured, nor anger or indignation at anybody or anything in
  particular. His most conscious thought, almost amounting to a worry, was that
  he wouldn't be much good for some rather important work at his office later
  in the day.</p>

  <p>About eight o'clock the 'all clear' sounded again and Charles, with a
  local warden, left the scene of what was so genteelly called an 'incident'.
  The street was close to where Havelock lived, and Charles was not utterly
  astonished to find his father standing at the corner, fully dressed and
  looking quite spruce. They exchanged a greeting, but no more; Charles felt
  now his own exhaustion and wanted nothing so much as to get to his flat and
  have a bath. His companion, a sturdy rough-spoken friendly fellow, commented:
  'That old bloke your dad?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Charles. 'He lives just round the corner.'</p>

  <p>'Don't you want to take 'im 'ome, then&mdash;make sure 'e's all
  right?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, he's all right. I'll see him later.'</p>

  <p>'Bin a narsty one, though, tonight&mdash;some of the old folks need a bit
  of cheerin' up after it.'</p>

  <p>'My father doesn't. He enjoys it all.'</p>

  <p>'WHAT?'</p>

  <p>'It excites him. All the bombs falling and the fires and everything.'</p>

  <p>'Go on&mdash;I don't believe it!'</p>

  <p>'It's a fact. I wanted him to go away when the raids started, but he
  wouldn't. He likes it here.'</p>

  <p>'Wot's the matter with 'im then? Is he loony?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Charles.</p>

  <p>But he did not often lose his nerve enough to speak with such nerveless
  detachment.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was true, though, that Havelock was in London from
choice. After the
  opening nights of the heavy September raiding Charles had seen no reason why
  his father should stay, since he could just as well live with Cobb on the
  coast or in some inland town. The affair of the letters seemed to have blown
  over, at least for the time, and Charles had heard no more from anyone about
  his own letter of resignation. Even if Havelock were still on any secret list
  of suspects, he could be watched as easily in one place as another. But the
  old man himself declined to move. It was perhaps too much or at least too
  simple to say that he enjoyed the raids, but they certainly fascinated him;
  in some obscure way they offered a challenge and a reassurance of destiny, as
  if every bomb were aimed at him personally, so that every raid he survived
  represented a personal victory.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of the year there came a lull in air attacks, and Jane
  (using this as an excuse) joined Charles at the Chelsea flat, leaving Gerald
  in Cheshire. But when the lull ended Jane also refused to leave. Charles
  could not convince her that he worried about her safety even more than he
  took pleasure in her company. But DID he? He often asked himself the question
  afterwards, speculating how much had been in his power, even had he chosen to
  exercise it.</p>

  <p>Besides a desire to be with Charles, she soon had other reasons for
  staying where trouble was. She found a job with the local authority,
  arranging shelter for bombed-out families; in this she became an instant
  success and (to Charles's dismay) quite invaluable. Sometimes when they both
  returned to the flat, she from the Town Hall and he from his varied duties in
  Whitehall, it was long past midnight. Then if there was no raid they could
  have a meal of sorts and a few hours' sleep before morning took them to work
  again. It was hard, and amidst these compulsions, to remember that they were
  financially well off&mdash;hard, and also, as a rule, irrelevant. Money was
  still the lubricant, but it was not the driving power of this new kind of
  life; it conferred a few small privileges, but no large immunities. To
  Charles these months in London during the blitz reminded him more of his
  schooldays than of anything else&mdash;the physical austerities, the
  extraordinary way one enjoyed any small pleasure that came unexpectedly, the
  regular almost taken-for-granted ordeals (now the raids, at school compulsory
  games), and over it all a sense of time passing that must, if one were lucky,
  bring some eventual finality&mdash;the end of term, or the end of the war.
  Towards Christmas, so Havelock assured Charles, Hitler missed a terrific
  psychological opening wedge into the Londoner's heart. He should have
  announced, with all possible propaganda fanfare, that raids would be totally
  suspended during the festive season, that London could put on its lights,
  enjoy social engagements, and sleep the good sleep for a whole week. The
  British authorities, naturally, would then have warned that Hitler was not to
  be trusted and would have insisted (rightly) on continuing every precaution;
  after which Hitler should very simply have kept his word. The curious
  psychological effect of this would have been to make Londoners feel almost
  grateful for not being killed, and irritated with their own rulers for being
  over-zealous. At least that was the way Havelock worked it out; but since to
  make Hitler popular was neither Charles's desire nor within his power, the
  argument remained purely academic.</p>

  <p>Charles was an averagely good citizen, performing his duties by day and
  night no better or worse than tens of thousands of other Londoners&mdash;
  that is to say, without any special heroism, but with a good deal of
  conscientiousness. The time he crawled under the ruins of the house to try to
  free the trapped old man was the nearest he ever came to a personal exploit;
  there were other ticklish moments, some of them even more unpleasant, but
  none that put him so close to the centre of any stage. He did not want such a
  position, anyhow, and if chance had decreed it for him he knew his friends
  and colleagues would have responded with far more badinage than applause.</p>

  <p>Charles's happiest moments at this period of his life (and they had a
  piercing intensity while they lasted) were the rare ones when he and Jane
  found themselves at home with nothing much to do in some small pocket of the
  immediate future that seemed to have miraculously detached itself from the
  rest. The flat was near the river, and on raidless nights they would stroll
  along the Chelsea Embankment before going to bed, watching the tugs horn
  their way under the Albert Bridge and wishing they had a dog. But of course
  this was no time for having dogs in London. Or wives either, Charles
  sometimes thought during raids. The safe moments with Jane were precious
  because of the fears that at other times beset him. He had never felt so
  alone with her, dependent on her, worried about her&mdash;and, perhaps
  because of it all, so close to her.</p>

  <p>And there were other moments, weirdly and painfully happy, when he had
  checked after raids to find that all was well with Jane and he could then
  unclench the muscles of his stomach and join a group of tired men clustering
  round a mobile canteen to drink tea. It was the least palatable liquid he had
  ever tasted&mdash;sticky and oversweetened and pale with condensed milk; yet
  he found in it a flavour that again reminded him of schooldays&mdash;of
  horrible concoctions prepared and enjoyed in his study after a football game
  that he had particularly loathed.</p>

  <p>Jane, however, was much more than an averagely good citizen. In no time at
  all she seemed to have acquired a position of authority at the Town Hall,
  distributing chits for this and that, fixing homeless families in temporary
  quarters, smoothing out countless difficulties and bringing order out of
  chaos wherever she turned. All the qualities that had made her hoydenish as a
  girl and excellent as a diplomat's wife made her now superb. She knew how to
  talk to poor people without condescension and to officials without
  subservience. She knew exactly when to insist and when to cajole, when to
  rebuke and when to flatter. And she seemed to have no physical fear. This, to
  Charles, who had, was the most remarkable thing of all.</p>

  <p>Owing partly to an early fresh-air upbringing and partly also to much
  experience of savage injuries caused by broken glass, she developed what
  Charles jokingly called a 'window neurosis'. As soon as she entered a room
  she would rush up to closed windows and open them, thus lessening the danger
  of blast, but also (as Charles pointed out) destroying the effect of indoor
  heating on cold days. Charles, in his office overlooking the Horse Guards
  Parade, was one of those who found the government heat ration hopelessly
  inadequate unless he worked in his overcoat and trusted to draughts for
  ventilation. Once Jane visited him and went straight to the windows, opening
  them wide and exclaiming: 'Charles, you're stuffy in here.' A man named
  Etheridge, who happened to be with Charles at the time, gave the statement a
  prolonged joy-ride. 'Of course he's stuffy in here. Isn't he stuffy when he's
  with you too? Why, that's what we call him&mdash;STUFFY ANDERSON.'</p>

  <p>They hadn't, until then. But afterwards those who knew him well enough and
  liked him sometimes did. Others picked up the nickname without the story of
  its origin, and thinking of him as Stuffy found stuffiness in some of his
  behaviour. His minute handwriting helped, and perhaps also a certain
  fussiness over details that did not, just then, seem to everybody worth the
  attention he gave them. He could not have explained, and perhaps he did not
  know, that he clung to the importance of these trivia as to a symbol of what
  could not be blown to bits or buried under rubble. The verbal correctness of
  despatches, for instance. He abhorred jargon, the diplomatic as much as any,
  and would frown on any junior who talked or wrote of 'implementing a
  decision' or 'activating a policy', except of course when such idioms were
  consciously used to disguise or fog a meaning. For certain words his dislike
  amounted to prejudice&mdash;'rededicate' was one; 'underprivileged' was
  another. To the surprise of some in his department, he had no objection to
  'okay'. He was not a pedant. Now that the immediate threat of a German
  invasion seemed to be over, there were often arguments about the value and
  quality of Churchill's oratory&mdash;that speech, for example, about fighting
  on the beaches and in the fields and the streets and the hills. How far could
  it have weighed in the hairline balance that had so recently existed? It was
  often conceded that further fighting would have been hopeless if ever an
  enemy had seized the airfields, the railways and roads into London, and the
  Channel ports, nor was it certain that all this could have been prevented if
  enough German lives had been staked. Yet the romantic view, the heroic
  attitude, however false or illogical&mdash;what a weapon it had been, and
  especially in the almost total absence of other weapons! Charles, whose
  service to his country was at no time romantic, nor did he ever think it was,
  could share nevertheless the sense of glory that sometimes touched London's
  tired morning faces like an extra colour on a painter's palette that came
  from no known mixture of other colours. It would have been hard to make a
  memorandum about this, but it was clearly the stuff that dreams were made of,
  and English dreams at that. Charles was a great admirer of Churchill and of
  the fighting-on-the-beaches speech. But of the other famous one, about having
  nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat, he would only comment: 'It
  always WAS good&mdash;even when Garibaldi and Lord Byron and John Donne
  thought so.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Charles alternated with Jane, as a rule, in visiting Gerald
at weekends;
  it rarely happened that they could go together. But Gerald meanwhile was
  happy enough with Aunt Birdie and had made friends of his own age in the
  small Cheshire town. Charles told Jane he sometimes doubted whether the boy
  really enjoyed his visits or was just polite enough to give him a civil
  welcome.</p>

  <p>'Of course he likes to see you, Charles. But he's as shy of you as you are
  of him.'</p>

  <p>'I don't mind. My time will come later. What I'm really looking forward to
  is when he's about seventeen or eighteen and we can start being companions.
  Climbing, for instance&mdash;I'd like to take him up Scafell.'</p>

  <p>'I'll be getting on for sixty when Gerald's eighteen.'</p>

  <p>Charles's vision of Scafell had included only himself and Gerald, but he
  replied gallantly: 'Why all the mathematics? People have climbed the
  Matterhorn at sixty.'</p>

  <p>She shook her head. She was in one of the sombre moods that had come
  rather frequently of late&mdash;the strain of the raids, he surmised. He
  wished she would go back to Cheshire and rest for a few weeks.</p>

  <p>Abruptly she came over to his chair and sat on the arm. 'Charles, do you
  remember those little islands near Stockholm that we always said were so
  fascinating though we never found time to land on them?'</p>

  <p>'Yes?'</p>

  <p>'Well, that's the point. We never found time. And it would only have taken
  a day.'</p>

  <p>'That's so. But what made you think of them?'</p>

  <p>'I've been thinking of a lot of places lately. For relief, I suppose. You
  have to think of OTHER things when you're doing SOME things... Places where
  we've lived, or just visited, or passed in a train or boat, and memory put a
  red star in the corner like pictures in a gallery that get sold...'</p>

  <p>'That's a pretty comparison.'</p>

  <p>'... The Danube at Giurgiu, do you remember, and the old man who came on
  board festooned with green peppers and pomegranates? And St.-Rémy-de-Provence
  on the night they had the wine festival? And Kandersteg, where you said you'd
  like to paint, but I wanted to climb, so we climbed... I'm sorry about that
  now. I should have let you paint more.'</p>

  <p>'We couldn't climb and paint at the same time, and I always enjoyed
  climbing.'</p>

  <p>'Charles, if you ever marry again, pick a young girl who doesn't like
  climbing, because you're getting to the age when painting is so much better
  for your heart.'</p>

  <p>Charles laughed, yet was increasingly puzzled by her mood. He said
  lightly: 'My heart's all right, Jane, as you know better than anybody.'</p>

  <p>'That's pretty too. Reminds me of old times. Compliments and champagne
  under the chandeliers. Our lives have had so much of that, haven't they? You
  remember François Pichel? He once told me you could pay a compliment as well
  as any Frenchman.'</p>

  <p>'Which was a nice way of paying himself one.'</p>

  <p>'He also liked your paintings. Where are they all now?'</p>

  <p>'Goodness knows. Brunon had a lot, and where's he? Still at
  Clermont-Ferrand, I hope&mdash;it's pretty safe there... Some others were at
  Beeching and when the place was sold they got mixed up with the stuff that
  went to auction. I have a few here, probably ruined by dust and dampness...
  Why this sudden interest in them?'</p>

  <p>'Because... oh, Andy, paint some more some time, will you? Would there be
  anything to paint on one of those islands?'</p>

  <p>'Why, yes, I daresay, but&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Could we ever go there and see?'</p>

  <p>'After the war, of course... But Jane, what's the matter? You're not
  &mdash;specially&mdash;UPSET about anything, are you?'</p>

  <p>As soon as he had spoken it the question seemed absurd. There they were,
  huddled in a cold room after a makeshift meal, weary from a day of effort and
  nervous tension, waiting for the night which, if it followed a familiar
  pattern, would bring them more of the same.</p>

  <p>'I'm all right,' she answered. At that moment the sirens began, and from
  then on it was the plain truth; she WAS all right. And though Charles wasn't,
  altogether (his stomach never could get used to the sound), it was easier to
  brace himself for the performance of certain known duties than to prowl
  wistfully among the memories. 'No champagne under the chandeliers tonight,'
  he said grimly, reaching for his equipment. It was his turn for fire-watching
  and with a raid in prospect he must start at once.</p>

  <p>He often felt that he endured these occasions only by having to go out and
  do things instead of staying at home to wait for things to happen.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">One morning in March there was an 'incident' in a street
called Marlow
  Terrace, where bombs had fallen during the night. The usual after-raid work
  was in progress&mdash;digging into ruins to discover if anyone trapped were
  still alive, and an evacuation of families from nearby houses that had been
  declared unsafe. The sun shone like a red globe through the dust, the air was
  warm with a touch of spring, and a canteen served tea to anyone who wanted it
  &mdash;officials, rescue workers, and residents alike. All the routine of
  behaviour that had by now become so dreadfully normal was operating smoothly,
  and there was nothing in Marlow Terrace that made it different from scores of
  other London streets that morning. Suddenly a delayed-action bomb exploded
  from the front garden of a house where evacuation had just been ordered. It
  was an enormous explosion heard miles away. The walls of all the adjacent
  houses caved in and made a mountain of rubble from pavement to pavement. A
  roaring fire broke out almost immediately from escaping gas. The whole street
  had been so busy, just before, that survivors were unable to say exactly who
  had been there and who elsewhere; only a roll-call, undertaken later, gave a
  list which could be no more than tentative. A few persons were just not seen
  again, and nothing was ever found of them, or guessed about them unless
  someone came along to say that so-and-so was missing and might have been or
  must have been in Marlow Terrace about that time.</p>

  <p>Charles was caught up in an unexpected flurry of office work that day and
  towards late afternoon telephoned his flat that he would have to miss dinner
  and (since it was his night for fire-watching) would not be home till next
  morning. He left this message with the woman who came in to clean and tidy
  up; she said Jane had been out all day and had not telephoned. This was
  fairly unusual, but there were a dozen possible reasons; the whole fabric of
  wartime life was interwoven with such unusualness. Charles thought little of
  it, ate a sandwich at his desk, and worked throughout the evening. Towards
  eight o'clock he telephoned again, just to say hello, but there was no
  answer. This was on the way to being unusually unusual, since even if Jane
  had gone out again for the evening after receiving his message she would
  hardly do so without giving him a ring. He therefore telephoned again just
  before nine, which was his hour for beginning watch and ward; still no
  answer. It was an eight-hour spell, and after it of course he could go home,
  but generally he finished the night on the army cot that the government had
  austerely installed in his office. Etheridge was sharing duty with him. He
  did not tell Etheridge why or where he kept dialling fruitlessly every hour
  or so. Etheridge was sleepy and dozed part of the time on his own cot;
  Charles was ready to wake him in any emergency. But there was no raid that
  night. About four o'clock Charles decided that as soon as he was free he
  would go to his flat immediately. He was already disturbed enough to wonder
  at what time a call to the police would cease to seem panicky. After half an
  hour of wondering he didn't even care, and a few minutes later he felt he
  could wait no longer. He telephoned the police from the office. They put him
  on to some young woman whose job seemed to be nothing but dealing with that
  kind of problem, and after he had given all the details, he fancied he caught
  in her answering voice an implied rebuke for his premature anxiety. Actually
  this comforted him a good deal during the hour or so before the same voice
  spoke to him again.</p>

  <p>He was then alone in his office, preparing to leave. He could not at first
  accept what he heard, but soon it fell into a perspective of credibility,
  being no more unlikely than much else one heard about every day. He sat at
  the desk for a moment, his hand still on the telephone. Then Etheridge came
  in. Etheridge did not apparently notice anything wrong, or perhaps he was too
  tired to observe Charles closely. Presently Charles said: 'Etheridge, I've
  just had... what may be bad news... about my wife... It seems... they say...
  by the way, where's Marlow Terrace? Isn't it near Sloane Square?'</p>

  <p>Etheridge came over and gripped his arm. Charles then turned to him with a
  stricken face and a remark that sounded foolishly like the kind he might have
  made at a cocktail party: 'You met my wife once, I think?'</p>

  <p>Etheridge accompanied him to Marlow Terrace, but there was nothing to see
  or do and hardly any more to learn. The rather remarkable circumstance, even
  for those times, was that there was just the slightest possibility that Jane
  might still turn up from somewhere else if one could think of any plausible
  reason for her continued absence from home. Charles, as the hours passed,
  could think of fewer and fewer such reasons. That she had had business in
  Marlow Terrace on the previous morning was verifiable, and that she had
  actually gone there was verifiable, but many had been killed who might have
  been with or near her at the time, and a postman delivering letters further
  along the street had already said he had seen someone roughly answering her
  description, just about where it happened and before he was blown
  unconscious. He had noticed her particularly, he said, because she had been
  doing her job so briskly and cheerfully, handling a group of evacuees as if
  (in his own words) she were 'running a school treat or something'.</p>

  <p>The hair-line of doubt, the ten-thousand-to-one chance, preoccupied
  Charles for weeks and drove him near what he himself felt to be a dangerous
  edge of mental balance. Perhaps he was saved because he thus felt it, and
  could therefore exert the necessary controls. But there were times when
  control was uncertain. It was surprising how many people, seen at a distance
  or passingly for a few seconds, looked like Jane; and how plausible then
  became the theory that Jane might have walked away from all the commotion
  unnoticed and unhurt except for complete loss of memory. There were stories
  about things like that. One afternoon he was on top of a bus along the Strand
  when he saw Jane (his recognition was quite positive) standing outside a
  cinema. He started up like a madman, ran down the steps and dodged traffic at
  the risk of his life, but too late to intercept her before she entered. His
  excitement at the box office and subsequent explanations of why he was
  wandering up and down the aisles to peer along rows of dim faces, did not
  satisfy the ushers, who ordered him out and threatened to call the police if
  he didn't clear off. He went on explaining, so they called the police, who
  listened more tolerantly and advised him to go home. He did not go home, but
  waited three hours till the show was over, watching the main entrance from as
  close as he dared. But there was a side-street exit that he could not also
  watch.</p>

  <p>Again he saw Jane in the Burlington Arcade leading a Pomeranian. That was
  strange, because she had always preferred big dogs. He hurried up to her.
  'Jane... JANE!...' She smiled a professional smile and took his arm, but the
  little dog yapped and snapped at his heels. From the way she scolded the
  animal he knew she could not be Jane at all. He apologized. 'What's the
  matter with you?' the woman jibed. She called after him as he walked away:
  'Nuts, that's what you are!' Odd, he reflected, suddenly sane inside his
  normal self, how American slang was driving out English slang&mdash;though
  'nuts' was certainly a good word, as good as a good monosyllable can be.</p>

  <p>This sort of thing disturbed Charles so much that he thought he might do
  well to see a doctor or a psychiatrist, but he shrank from the ordeal of
  discussing his affairs with a stranger. Then he remembered somebody who was
  not a stranger. On impulse he called on Blainey in Welbeck Street, catching
  the surgeon just about to leave for his hospital. They talked for a short
  while. Blainey was sympathetic, but had to insist he was unqualified to give
  more than the most general advice. He could, however, recommend a colleague
  &mdash;Heming Wentworth, just across the street...</p>

  <p>Charles said: 'I suppose the real reason I came to you is because you were
  a witness that time of my father's somewhat&mdash;er&mdash;peculiar
  behaviour, and I thought&mdash;I wondered if&mdash;by any chance&mdash;
  things like that... father to son, you know... not necessarily the SAME kind
  of peculiarity, but... But you're probably reluctant to give an opinion?'</p>

  <p>'I couldn't as an expert, Anderson, but for what it's worth I'd say your
  father's trouble is entirely his own affair&mdash;nothing to do with yours,
  which sounds to me like a very understandable result of what you've recently
  been through... You need rest, probably that's all. And mental rest. Haven't
  they found any trace&mdash;some piece of jewellery or something you can
  identify and then feel sure about it?'</p>

  <p>'There was part of a wristwatch that might have been hers.'</p>

  <p>'What do you mean&mdash;MIGHT HAVE BEEN?'</p>

  <p>'It was the same type. But I went to the shop and made enquiries&mdash;
  they said it was manufactured in thousands before the war.'</p>

  <p>'So you still feel... but that IS the trouble, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'I know. It's foolish. Like going back to the front door to try the lock
  when you know it's closed.'</p>

  <p>'You don't really BELIEVE she's still alive?'</p>

  <p>'No, not at all. Well, hardly at all. Except when I see her&mdash;THINK I
  see her, that is. I'm a... temperamentally, I mean... I'm a bit of a sceptic.
  But perhaps a credulous one.'</p>

  <p>'A credulous sceptic, eh? What sort of animal is that?'</p>

  <p>'Well... if I saw a man walking on the water, I don't think I'd conclude
  he was the son of God, but I'd probably say: Look, there's a fellow seems to
  be able to walk on water... Because so many strange things happen today. One
  must cling to one's doubts, but it's just nonsense to disbelieve everything
  on principle... I won't take up more of your time, though. You're right about
  my needing rest&mdash;I'll try to get it. I wish I could join the army and
  get away somewhere. Sort of requiescat in khaki. But I'll be all right.
  You've given me the answer I wanted.'</p>

  <p>'How IS Sir Havelock these days?'</p>

  <p>'Fine, fine.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps HE'S the one who really ought to consult Heming Wentworth?'</p>

  <p>They exchanged a smile, as at a particularly subtle joke which they alone
  could share.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The talk with Blainey did much for Charles, but Gerald did
most of all.
  Charles took time off from the Office and went to Cheshire to see the boy,
  who knew nothing of what had happened and was supremely happy in his aunt's
  home. It was the spectacle of this happiness that helped Charles far more
  than Gerald ever afterwards knew. Charles kept putting off the job of telling
  him the truth as much for his own sake as Gerald's; and when this reluctance
  became revealed as part of a state of mind, Jane's sister thought of an
  ingenious alternative. Gerald was five&mdash;an age when the loss of his
  mother, if he learned about it, might overtax his emotional resources, though
  he had quite easily accustomed himself to seeing her only at long intervals.
  Aunt Birdie's idea was that if the boy were sent to some American relatives
  who had already pressingly invited him, the blow might be deferred till it
  was much less of a blow. Such a plan was all the simpler because there had
  been frequent talk of sending him to America and he had come to think of the
  trip as a desirable event even at the price of separation from his parents.
  It was leaving Aunt Birdie that bothered him most, for during his stay at her
  house he had developed a great attachment to her. Birdie, therefore, with a
  husband abroad and not much else to do, suggested that she should make the
  trip with him and stay till he had settled down and made new friends. Charles
  was in entire agreement. He went back to London to work on the practical
  details, and to such effect that within a month of the incident in Marlow
  Terrace Gerald and his aunt were aboard the Clipper.</p>

  <p>Charles saw them off and then, sick at heart but in better control of
  himself than for some time, faced the fact of his own future. Of course he
  would not need to see Heming Wentworth. There was really nothing the matter
  with him. Blainey had been right. Just rest&mdash;and he had had it. Now he
  had better get back to work. There were things to do, arrangements to make,
  matters he had neglected during his&mdash;whatever one called it&mdash; would
  BREAKDOWN be the proper word? And the first thing was to see Havelock again.
  He hadn't done so since the incident in Marlow Terrace. He hadn't felt it
  possible to do more than keep in touch with Cobb about him. But now he
  decided the nettle must be grasped, and in the same mood he would stop saying
  'the incident in Marlow Terrace', either to himself or to others, when what
  he really meant was 'Jane's death'.</p>

  <p>He had moved out of the flat in Chelsea and had managed to get a room at
  his club. After dining there alone one evening he made the journey to
  Kensington and rang the bell of his father's flat as casually as if there had
  been no interval since his former regular visits. Cobb admitted him,
  tactfully without surprise, but told him in the hallway that Havelock had not
  yet fully recovered from the shock of the whole thing; it had taken away the
  fun he got from air-raids, so that he was still rather moody and
  cantankerous. Charles found that this was so, except for the
  cantankerousness, which was rather in himself as he realized that the old man
  was now all he had left in the Eastern Hemisphere. Havelock did his best to
  be amiable, but the visit was a short one. 'I'll come back soon,' Charles
  promised, still casually. He had given no explanations and none had been
  asked for. In the hallway again, as Cobb helped him on with his coat, Charles
  remarked: 'Certainly keeps well physically, doesn't he?'</p>

  <p>Cobb agreed that he did. 'He's been writing a letter again, sir, but
  nothing to worry about.'</p>

  <p>'Oh?... Who is it this time&mdash;General Rommel or the Pope?'</p>

  <p>'President Roosevelt.'</p>

  <p>Charles gave a low whistle. 'You read it of course?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, and it seemed all right, so I let it go. I thought it would cheer
  him up&mdash;Sir Havelock, I mean. I don't suppose the President'll ever see
  it.'</p>

  <p>'But what's it about?'</p>

  <p>'A statue of Columbus in London. Sir Havelock thinks there ought to be
  one.'</p>

  <p>'Isn't there?'</p>

  <p>'Apparently not, sir.'</p>

  <p>'Why, no, I can't think of any. Not a bad idea, Cobb, but a little awkward
  just now, since Columbus was an Italian. Mustn't glorify the ancestors of our
  enemies, must we?... However, I don't think His Majesty's Government, in the
  circumstances, will consider the suggestion treasonous.'</p>

  <p>It eased Charles to find this sort of wry humour in most of his concerns,
  and he was beginning to be known for it. Some people said he was witty,
  others that he joked about matters that weren't funny; a few guessed that he
  was desperately unhappy and had found a way to come to terms with both the
  desperation and the unhappiness.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Charles did not ask for a longer leave, as some of his
friends urged; he
  said truthfully that he found his work a help, or at least a time-occupier,
  and even his night duties were useful in solving the problem of sleep. He was
  well liked and his friends rallied round with as much hospitality as
  conditions permitted them to offer; but he really did not mind being alone
  when he was also, as so often happened, exhausted.</p>

  <p>One day it fell to him, as a representative of the Foreign Office, to
  escort a Middle-Eastern potentate and his entourage to an airport whence a
  military plane would fly them carefully home. Charles had had something to do
  with his visit to what was usually on such occasions referred to as the
  war-torn island; it had been a visit staged with psychological shrewdness and
  not without a likely effect in terms of oil concessions. Accompanying the
  small party was a British Military Attaché who would travel back with the
  potentate and keep him happy during the trip. (For what better reason, after
  all, did one learn those obscure and difficult languages?) The Attaché's name
  was Venner, and he persisted in calling Charles 'Allenson'; Charles did not
  correct him. But he found the young fellow congenial company during the short
  time they had together at the airport. They were granted this respite because
  their illustrious charge had asked to be left alone for a period of prayer
  and meditation, and after harassed consultations with airport officials a
  small room not very suitable for the purpose had been discovered and
  commandeered. It was the room (so an official said) where incoming suspects
  were searched for smuggled drugs or diamonds.</p>

  <p>Charles, thinking of the last time he had seen anyone off at an airport
  (his own son and sister-in-law), paced up and down a plywood corridor with
  the Attaché; thought also of the potentate on his knees a few yards away,
  after the fashion of his ancestors for a thousand years; thought also of the
  great engines warming up nearby, ready to carry him to biblical lands in a
  matter of hours; thought also of the millions of Londoners waiting in their
  own homes for the probable nightly dose of death and destruction. Truly a
  moment to take refuge in some deep philosophy, if one had any.</p>

  <p>The pilot, fidgeting to be off before a raid could start, approached them
  with the question, hushed yet matter-of-fact: 'How long d'you think his nibs
  is going to be in there?'</p>

  <p>'Few minutes&mdash;five&mdash;ten, possibly,' answered the Attaché. 'Not
  more as a rule.'</p>

  <p>The pilot shrugged and went off.</p>

  <p>Charles then said: 'I suppose you know his nibs pretty well?'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes. I've been with him several years.'</p>

  <p>'What sort of a fellow is he?'</p>

  <p>'Not bad, as they go. Crafty. Suspicious of his family. Loves practical
  jokes. Generous when he's in the mood. Extravagant. Greedy. What impressed
  him most, I think, during his stay here was that in the midst of our own
  crisis we're building him two beautiful Rolls-Royces with satin-wood panels
  and solid gold ashtrays. He figures we wouldn't do that if we weren't going
  to win the war. But of course we wouldn't do that if we didn't need his oil
  to win the war. So I guess we're craftier in the long run... He's a hard
  bargainer, though.'</p>

  <p>'And of course fabulously rich.'</p>

  <p>'So rich he's worried stiff. He's secretly afraid that some day somebody
  will ruin the oil trade by finding a synthetic substitute&mdash;like they did
  to Chilean nitrates. We planted a rumour once that a scientist had invented
  something... just to explore a weak spot.'</p>

  <p>'And what happened?'</p>

  <p>'He got rid of half a dozen wives immediately&mdash;as an economy measure.
  Didn't miss them either, so far as I could see.'</p>

  <p>Charles said whimsically: 'I suppose you don't when you have so many...
  But I miss mine&mdash;she was killed a few weeks ago in a raid.'</p>

  <p>The Attaché was naturally startled and considerably embarrassed. 'Oh...
  er... I'm sorry to hear that, Allenson... That's really bad.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, it does rather hit one.' And then Charles continued, as he could
  only have done with someone who had missed his real name and whom he would
  probably never meet again: 'I was very fond of my wife. She was a damned good
  sort. She'd be better at this than I am&mdash;handling his nibs, I mean.
  "Man-handler" I called her once and she said it was a compliment. So it was,
  by God. I wonder why the F.O. never has women to do these jobs&mdash;
  everyone knows how useful a wife can be in an Embassy... Are you married, by
  any chance?'</p>

  <p>The Attaché said he was.</p>

  <p>'Well, hang on to her then. Don't let her run into danger.' Having offered
  this advice without undue emphasis Charles added: 'I'm talking a lot of
  nonsense, you must forgive me.'</p>

  <p>'Oh no, not at all...' A small commotion was shaping up towards the end of
  the corridor. 'I guess he's finished&mdash;now we can start, thank
  goodness... You'll be all right going back into town, Allenson?'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, of course... thank you.'</p>

  <p>After Charles had performed the ceremonies of the occasion and had heard
  the plane take off at some distant end of a darkened runway he walked to the
  government car whose chauffeur was waiting with the same kind of fidgetiness
  the pilot had had, and for the same reason. 'So far so good, sir,' he said,
  starting up. 'We live in 'opes.'</p>

  <p>In the car Charles felt, not for the first time in his life, that he had
  made something of a fool of himself. Or rather, of some other fellow named
  Allenson. He must remember to look up the List tomorrow to see if there was
  an Allenson anywhere. He hoped he did not exist.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Later in April he spent a weekend in Suffolk at the house
of an
  Under-Secretary who was ill and wanted him to help to draft a reply to Turkey
  about Moslem Irredentists in Cyprus. Charles took his car, which he now
  rarely drove, and enjoyed the journey through country previously unknown to
  him. On the way back on Sunday afternoon he chose to wander off the main
  roads in the general direction of London, not caring how he would eventually
  arrive there. The drastic curtailment of private motoring had given these
  East Anglian byways back to the nineteenth century, and with trees and hedges
  freshening to green along the twisting lanes, the drive was one of pure
  enchantment. As he reluctantly covered the miles the thought of London's dark
  streets and a possible air-raid that night added a tragic beauty to sights
  and sounds&mdash;of children in gay dresses romping through a churchyard, a
  gnarled old man leaning on the gate of a field, two soldiers on bicycles
  whistling as if there were not a war in the world.</p>

  <p>The sun was lowering by the time he stopped for tea at a café where he was
  the only customer. He did not hurry, and when he left the streets were
  already gray. He drove on a half-dozen miles or so, guideless except by a
  rough sense of convergement and increasing urbanization and by a curious
  awareness of London ahead like some great breathing animal, downed but not
  cowed, waiting for more blows and ready to take them. It would be a good
  night for a raid, though lately there had been a falling-off in the intensity
  and frequency of them. At one corner he had to stop for traffic long enough
  to read the name on a lamp-post. Chilford Road. The name stirred a memory;
  Chilford was the next station beyond Linstead on that railway whose trains
  ran every hour throughout the night. He felt the impulse of a whim; if the
  road he was on led through Linstead it would be interesting to have a glimpse
  of the place; if not, it didn't matter. But after a few minutes memory
  stirred again; he was passing Linstead station, and how easy, indeed
  inevitable, to take the turn beyond the secondary school and the Carnegie
  Library.</p>

  <p>It was a night of scudding cloud, but a full moon shone behind, half
  breaking through in patches of pallor. Wind scoured between the long rows of
  suburban houses till the pavements looked like bones picked clean. Charles
  could see gaps in the rows; he knew that the whole district had been heavily
  bombed. Presently he came to a corner he did not recognize because of an open
  space littered with rubble and flanked by shored-up sides of houses; but
  this, he knew, must be the corner of Ladysmith Road. He made the turn and
  drove slowly along... for the first time in twenty years.</p>

  <p>He was surprised how faint and gradual was the approach of memory about
  it. He could not recall, offhand, what the exact number of the house had been
  &mdash;in the teens of the two hundreds, he thought, but had it been 214 or
  215 or 216? 215 soon disengaged itself as on the wrong side of the road
  &mdash;no mistake about that. Then it came to him that as one had walked from
  the street to the front door, the bay window had been on the right-hand side;
  this threw out 216. So it must be 214. He slowed the car to walking pace and
  drew immediate partial confirmation from some twinge of inner memory
  &mdash;the laburnum trees, yes, the laburnum trees, they were budding, they
  had grown, they nearly touched; Ladysmith Road was at last the leafy avenue
  that had been dreamed of. But the house itself he would not have known from a
  hundred others. There was a brass plate on the gate, reading when he came
  close&mdash;'Miss Lydia Chancellor, L.R.A.M.&mdash;Pianoforte Lessons'. He
  wondered if Miss Chancellor were young or middle-aged or old&mdash; whether
  she had moved into 214 after the Mansfields, or had ever heard of them. He
  began to picture Miss Lydia Chancellor, L.R.A.M., and in no time at all she
  became a heroine, of whatever age&mdash;giving her sedate pianoforte lessons
  come raid or shine.</p>

  <p>And then, while he stopped his car at the kerb, he heard a sound that for
  all its plausibility in the context of his thoughts, nevertheless startled
  him like a touch of ice. It was the tinkle of a piano behind the darkened bay
  window. Miss Chancellor was at work. He heard the fumbling play of the pupil,
  then a colloquy of muffled voices, then the piano again&mdash;the same tune
  accurately, authoritatively. It was Brahms's Lullaby and Miss Chancellor
  played it as if she were marching soldiers round a barrack square. Not a note
  was out of step. Charles listened in fascination, but soon heard footsteps
  approaching, and with need of some excuse for having stopped, could think of
  nothing but to half-open the car door and pretend to be tying his shoelace.
  It was the local policeman on his beat. 'Quiet tonight,' said Charles.</p>

  <p>'Yes, sir, we're all right so far.' And then, as if the shoelace were not
  wholly convincing: 'Looking for somewhere, sir?'</p>

  <p>Charles had to find an answer and it came as familiarly as the feel of a
  switch in a room one thought one had forgotten. 'The Prince Rupert... isn't
  there a pub of that name near here?'</p>

  <p>Suspicion vanished; anyone looking for the Prince Rupert clearly had a
  right to stop his car wherever he liked to tie his shoelace or anything else.
  'First on the right, second on the left, sir.'</p>

  <p>'Thanks,' said Charles. He closed the door and drove off... And why not to
  the Prince Rupert, after all?</p>

  <p>Two minutes later he was pushing through the swing-doors into a vestibule
  that had been built to ensure obedience to the blackout regulations. The
  interior was pleasantly warm, hazy with smoke and shaded lights,
  companionably buzzing with talk, but not noisy. Charles went to the bar and
  asked for a bitter. It was rarely his drink, but the word had framed itself
  for speech before he could think of anything else.</p>

  <p>Except for the dimness and the improvised vestibule he did not think the
  Prince Rupert had changed since his last visit. It had then, he recollected,
  been recently modernized in a style which some architect had imagined to be
  'Old English'; there had been a rash of dark-stained planks laid on plaster,
  and beams that were not beams; but now, after such a decent interval, the
  sham had acquired a half-reality of its own. The bar counter, for instance,
  originally polished to look ancient, had lost its polish and taken on an
  attractive patina of plain usage.</p>

  <p>Memories now were assembling so fast that Charles took cautious inventory
  of them, as with an old trunk in an attic that may have things in it one
  doesn't expect and might not want to find. The framed picture of a pretty
  girl holding up a glass of beer reminded him of something... or perhaps
  nothing. Another picture, of a khaki-clad soldier posing with a large Union
  Jack, harked back to that period, so alien, so distant, of the phony war.
  Abruptly amidst these musings he felt a touch on his arm. It was an old man
  whom he did not recognize. 'Mr. Anderson... am I right, sir? You'll remember
  me... FRED MANSFIELD.'</p>

  <p>Charles stared, and a whole flock of memories broke through, so that his
  voice was hard to control as he shook the bony hand. 'Of course I remember...
  of course...'</p>

  <p>But he hadn't, at first, and if he had met the man in the street he knew
  he would have passed him by. He remembered the voice, though&mdash;the
  high-pitched gentle Cockney. And soon, of course, the features fitted in, so
  that he could judge Mr. Mansfield hadn't changed much either, except to look
  older and frailer, especially in the throes of his excusable excitement.</p>

  <p>'CHARLIE... well, of all the... and 'ere again&mdash;'ow many years is
  it?'</p>

  <p>Charles had to think, and in thinking remembered how, during those early
  years in European capitals, he had sometimes imagined meeting Fred Mansfield
  again&mdash;a meeting in which, out of his own deep hurt and humiliation, he
  would tell the fellow exactly what he thought of him. But now, it seemed,
  even the hurt and humiliation could be remembered only with an effort; and
  perhaps for this reason he didn't actually know what he thought of him, or of
  himself either, except that they had both been victims.</p>

  <p>So all he answered was: 'Yes, it was a long time ago... What are you
  drinking?'</p>

  <p>'No, Charlie&mdash;this is on me when I get me breath... Gorlummy, wot a
  surprise!... Mrs. Appleby, two bitters for me an' this gentleman. 'E's an old
  friend of mine... Mr. Anderson&mdash;Mrs. Appleby.' Charles shook hands with
  the landlady, and something else occurred to him. 'It was Mrs. Webber, wasn't
  it, Fred, the last time I was here?' It seemed quite easy and natural now to
  call him Fred.</p>

  <p>'That's right! Now fancy you rememberin' Mrs. Webber... Mrs. Appleby, Mr.
  Anderson remembers Mrs. Webber!' But Mrs. Appleby did not seem specially
  interested. 'Poor Mrs. Webber died of a stroke, and then there was the
  Johnsons, and then the Brackleys&mdash;nobody liked THEM&mdash;they let the
  'ouse down, they did... But now we're all 'appy again, ain't we, Mrs.
  Appleby?'</p>

  <p>'Maybe some of us are,' said Mrs. Appleby as she turned to other
  customers.</p>

  <p>'The fact is,' whispered Mr. Mansfield confidentially, 'she ain't 'ad it
  too easy litely. That larst raid shook 'er up. Two bombs just rahnd the
  corner, but only a few winders broke in 'ere. Ain't that luck?'</p>

  <p>Charles agreed that it was. 'You're looking very well, Fred&mdash;very
  well indeed.'</p>

  <p>'Can't complain. Not so bad for seventy-eight. Your dad still alive an'
  well, I 'ope?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He's eighty-one.'</p>

  <p>'Good for 'im. I remember Sir 'Avelock... I ses to 'im, when 'e left 'ere
  that time, Sir 'Avelock, I ses, it's bin a honner and a pleasure. Same 'ere,
  Mr. Mansfield, 'e ses, or words to that effect. I daresay 'e remembers me
  too.'</p>

  <p>'I'm certain he does.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Mansfield gripped Charles's arm in a still rising abandonment of
  delight. 'You know, Charlie, it's 'ard to believe, seein' you again like
  this. I can't say you don't look older, because you was only a boy in those
  days, but you certainly ain't changed your drinks, 'ave you? Bitter it was
  an' bitter it is, an' 'ere you are at the Prince Rupert like you was at
  'ome.' But he added, suddenly curious: 'You rahnd 'ere on business?'</p>

  <p>'No... just chance. I was driving back from Suffolk and found myself so
  close I thought I'd see what the old place looked like.' As soon as he said
  it he knew it rang false; it sounded like some sentimental Old Boy revisiting
  his alma mater. But to Mr. Mansfield the explanation seemed perfectly
  satisfactory.</p>

  <p>'You'll find some changes, Charlie. That is, if you was 'ere in the
  daytime and could see. Lots of bombs in the 'Igh Road.'</p>

  <p>'And at the corner of Ladysmith Road too.'</p>

  <p>'You saw that? Ah, that was a narsty one. Land mine, they said.'</p>

  <p>'No damage at Number 214, I noticed.'</p>

  <p>'So you came by an' 'ad a look? Well, well, to think of you rememberin'...
  I don't live there no more. When the wife died I moved in with Evelyn an' 'er
  'usband&mdash;in Roberts Road. Just the next turnin' from 'ere.
  Convenient.'</p>

  <p>'I'm sorry to hear about Mrs. Mansfield.'</p>

  <p>'Poor old soul, she missed a lot o' trouble, that's one thing. Bert 'ad to
  'ave an operation an' ain't bin the same since. Maud's married and got two
  boys&mdash;lives at Chatham&mdash;'er 'usband's in the Navy.'</p>

  <p>'And Lily?' said Charles, with sudden breathlessness.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mansfield beamed. 'Lily? Why, she done the best of any of 'em. She's
  married an' in Orsetrilia&mdash;got quite a family.' He laid his glass on the
  counter and began searching his pockets. 'Look... She sent me some snaps only
  a month or two back&mdash;taken outside the 'ouse&mdash;seaside place near
  Sydney.' He found a photograph and held it for Charles to inspect. 'See the
  'ouse&mdash;pretty, ain't it? Their own, too... Garden all rahnd &mdash;not
  like the 'ouses 'ere. And that's the car they 'ave... 'E's got a good job out
  there.'</p>

  <p>Charles was transfixed by an emotion he could only control by being
  facetious. 'Very nice&mdash;very nice indeed&mdash;and Mr. Robinson seems to
  have put on a little weight.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Mansfield looked puzzled. 'ROBINSON?' Then he swung a cordial hand to
  Charles's back. 'Gorlummy, that ain't Reg Robinson!... Is THAT wot you
  thought? The name's Murdoch&mdash;Tom Murdoch. Orsetrilian Scotsman, that's
  wot 'e calls 'imself... But fancy you thinkin' it was Reg... Dunno wot ever
  'appened to Reg. They was sort of engaged for a time, but it didn't larst.
  Ain't 'eard of 'im now for years.'</p>

  <p>'You were saying Lily had a family...'</p>

  <p>'You bet she 'as, an' I got a picture of them too if I can find it.' He
  found it. 'See... Count 'em... An' this is another one of Lily by 'erself.
  You can't see the 'ouse in this.' He handed them both to Charles.</p>

  <p>Charles looked at the one of Lily first. She too had put on weight, not
  enough to make her stout, but to give her a look of ripeness that of course
  he could not remember; and yet it was so much like her, so much a fulfilment,
  that he felt he recognized her as clearly as if he had known her like that in
  his own life. She was smiling and the little gap between the two teeth at the
  upper left-hand side was still there. She looked gay and cosy and richly
  alive, and his heart missed a beat in its rejoicing.</p>

  <p>The other photograph showed a row of attractive-looking children ranging
  in age from thirteen or fourteen to perhaps two.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mansfield was gloating over his shoulder. 'See? I said you'd 'ave to
  count 'em... SIX&mdash;an' another on the way since then. I wrote back to 'er
  when she wrote an' told me that&mdash;Lily, I wrote&mdash;just a joke, of
  course&mdash;even if it ain't your fault, you really are makin' a 'abit of
  it. But she likes kids and she 'as 'em so easy, I suppose she don't mind.'
  And with a wink Mr. Mansfield added: 'I tell you, Charlie boy, you was lucky
  that time.'</p>

  <p>'WAS I? I WONDER.' Charles hardly whispered the words and was glad they
  were not heard. He handed back the photographs, forcing himself to catch Mrs.
  Appleby's eye and order two more bitters. 'She looks fine. When did she meet
  this Mr. Murdoch?'</p>

  <p>'That's wot I never can remember&mdash;the year, I mean, but it was the
  Wembley Exhibition that done it. Tom was in the Orsetrilian Pavilion&mdash;
  that was 'is job, you understand. Lily and me went there one day, we was
  lookin' at a stuffed kangaroo and a man come up and ses to me&mdash;"You
  interested?" Well, I wasn't, not special, not in kangaroos, but it turned out
  'e was interested in Lily&mdash;that's why 'e come up to me and started the
  conversation. All a matter of chawnce, ain't it? Like you droppin' in 'ere
  tonight. They was married within three months.'</p>

  <p>'And happily too, I can see.'</p>

  <p>'Well, now, you know Lily&mdash;or at least you remember 'er. She always
  was wot you might call a 'appy girl.' Mr. Mansfield put the photographs
  carefully back in his pocket. 'I saw in the papers when you was married,
  Charlie.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I have a little boy of five who's now in America.' The thought of
  all the children in Ladysmith Road and Roberts Road made him feel apologetic
  about this. 'We had relatives over there and they wanted to take him.'</p>

  <p>'Natchrally,' said Mr. Mansfield, unaware of any need for apology. 'Just
  like Lily wants me to go to Orsetrilia and live with 'er and Tom, and I would
  too if I was a kid. Gorlummy, if I was a kid I wouldn't want to stay in
  England. But at my age it's different. You get yer roots in a plice, Charlie,
  that's the way it is.'</p>

  <p>The drinks arrived and Charles lifted his glass. His voice shook a little,
  but not noticeably to the old man. He said: 'Well, Fred, let ME say it this
  time... Here's to us and our dear ones...' That had come back to him too.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">They talked on till closing time; then Charles took Mr.
Mansfield back to
  his house in Roberts Road. They shook hands at the gate and Charles meant it
  when he said he hoped they would meet again. During the very short walk (not
  worth while to get in and out of the car), he had noticed that Mr. Mansfield
  was a little unsteady on his feet&mdash;hardly from the few drinks, but more
  likely a sign of age that had not been apparent in the Prince Rupert. Another
  and perhaps a sadder sign was that Charles had been introduced in the bar to
  no one except Mrs. Appleby, who had not been too cordial. It rather looked as
  if the old fellow had outlived his cronies and that younger patrons found him
  a bore. Charles's sympathy was acute because he himself had a morbid fear of
  being a bore, a fear that sometimes made him awkward and speechless, or else
  foolish and facetious, in the presence of people who were perfectly satisfied
  for him to be himself. But Fred Mansfield WAS himself at all times, and
  always had been; and if others found him a bore he would bore them more by
  not realizing it, or else (as he had with Mrs. Appleby) find some charitable
  reason for having been snubbed. And to Charles this seemed the saddest thing
  of all.</p>

  <p>He drove back to London and was in bed before midnight. There was no raid,
  but he could not sleep. He wished he were in a house or flat where he could
  go to the kitchen and make himself a cup of tea, but his club bedroom had no
  such facilities and after an hour or two of lying awake he got up and looked
  in desperation for some job to do. It was too late to dress and go out again
  and he had little to read except the pencilled notes he had made at the
  Under-Secretary's house; these, with their deep concern for Cypriotes and
  Turks, did not easily engage his attention in the mood he was in. Lacking any
  better idea to pass the time, he turned to the suitcases he had brought with
  him from the Chelsea flat; he hadn't unpacked, since his stay at the club
  could only be temporary, but he had stuffed them so hastily with personal
  things that he thought it might be worth while to sort out the contents.
  Several were full of papers grabbed from desks and bureau drawers&mdash;old
  letters and miscellaneous documents he hadn't looked at for years, but which,
  from the fact that he had ever preserved them at all, might be considered of
  some importance. But, of course, as always happens with such accumulations,
  many seemed at this later date quite valueless, so he began to tear them up.
  There was a certain pleasure in doing this, though to be on the safe side he
  would take the fragments to the office in the morning and burn them in the
  fireplace... notes on the Tacna-Arica boundary dispute, for instance,
  flimsies about forgotten visits of forgotten foreign officials, a copy of a
  preposterous letter from a duchess to Ramsay MacDonald complaining that she
  had been insulted by a customs inspector at Pontarlier (this, Charles
  remembered, had been handed round the Office for laughs). And there were also
  more personal oddments&mdash;ancient menu cards and concert programmes with
  names and addresses scribbled on them of people he had met and had wished to
  remember at least for a time; worthless paper money of countries that had
  devalued their currencies; cuttings from newspapers and magazines; reports of
  company meetings; a dossier of correspondence with the P.L.M. about a lost
  trunk; old lists of dinner guests in Jane's handwriting with places at table
  arranged according to protocol (what a job that had sometimes been!). And
  then&mdash;suddenly&mdash;a foolscap envelope full of snapshots and letters
  from Lily... Lily standing by the Serpentine bridge, eating a bun from a
  paper bag; Lily leaning out of a train window waving her hand; Lily against
  the background of the turnstile entrance to the Zoo; Lily in a mackintosh and
  sou'wester, facing the wind and rain on the slopes of Box Hill; Lily feeding
  the squirrels in Regent's Park; Lily in the doorway of a cottage that had a
  home-painted inscription 'Teas' with the 's' turned the wrong way... So many
  places, so many scenes, and in nearly all of them Lily was smiling&mdash;not
  with the fixed grin of a pose, but as if she had always had something to
  smile about&mdash;which perhaps she had. The letters, too, were
  light-hearted, though usually not much more than fixings or confirmations of
  appointments. She had hardly been a good letter writer, though nothing she
  ever wrote was stiff or self-conscious. She simply could not be bothered to
  write when she was to meet someone soon; which was why, doubtless, the
  longest of all her letters to Charles was the last&mdash;the one when she was
  not to meet him soon, or indeed again.</p>

  <p>When Charles unfolded this letter after an interval of a good many years,
  the memory it gave him was predominantly of the Rhineland village where he
  had first read it&mdash;a cold twilight with snow in the air and Brunon
  handing him a batch of mail picked up at the post office. He remembered his
  own distress with something of the sad contentment that time always brings;
  so that he even paused to light a cigarette, as if to savour the
  re-reading.</p>

  <p>Dearest Charlie,</p>

  <p>I don't know how to write this, but I must, and I hope you won't be hurt.
  Perhaps you won't be after all this time, it seems years and years to me. Reg
  and I are engaged. Oh Charlie, please don't be upset. It's for the best, like
  your dad and my dad both told me, and especially now you've done so well in
  all the examinations and are going to have such a wonderful future. I was so
  happy when I heard about that, really I was. You know it was the one thing
  that had been worrying me all along, that you'd spent too much time with me
  when you ought to have been studying. But now that's all right. I'll bet you
  were pleased when you heard the news. My dad told me about it and I wanted to
  write then to congratulate you, but he said no, he'd given his word. But he
  said I could write this. Oh Charlie, I can't say much more. I'll always
  remember you and hope you'll go on having great success, I'm sure you will. I
  can't say all I would like to in a letter, perhaps it wouldn't reach you if I
  did, so better not, eh? I know you never liked Reg, but he really is all
  right when you get to know him. Charlie, I did love that visit to Cambridge.
  Dear Charlie, this is all I can say.</p>

  <p>Yours affectionately</p>

  <p>Lily</p>

  <p>Charles put the letter back in the envelope, and of all the emotions
  revived and reviving in his heart the only one he could express in the words
  of thought was a rueful: Poor old Reg, so you didn't get her after all, did
  you?</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A week or so later Charles gave up the Chelsea flat for
good and, since he
  could not stay at his club indefinitely, found a house in Westminster, near
  the river and within walking distance of the Foreign Office. It was a larger
  establishment than he needed for himself alone, and after much speculation as
  to how such a plan would work, he invited his father and Cobb to share it
  with him. One of his reasons was that Cobb, though too old for much personal
  activity, would excellently supervise and supplement any other domestic staff
  that Charles might be lucky enough to get; he hoped at least for a woman to
  cook and clean. But the chief reason was Havelock who at last, in his
  eighties, was beginning to experience that slight diminution of the
  life-force which often visits men as early as their forties. Also, according
  to the doctor, he had had an almost imperceptible stroke; it made him cut
  down his daily walking from five or six miles to two or three. Even more
  importantly, it clouded his mind to a merely dull inertia at times when
  formerly he would have been zestfully foolish; it stilled the riot in his
  veins to a mere fracas. All of this Charles considered, without cynicism, to
  be a great improvement. Certainly a household arrangement that had many other
  advantages was thus made possible.</p>

  <p>There was an added consideration in the likelihood that Charles himself
  would be away a good deal in the foreseeable future. He had been told,
  informally, that a delegation to America was on the cards and that he would
  be a member of it.</p>

  <p>Charles went to America in the autumn of the year. Most of his time was
  spent in Washington, but he had the chance of a weekend at Parson's Corner,
  Connecticut, where Gerald was living with the Fuesslis. The leaves were
  turning and the country round Parson's Corner was very beautiful. Aunt Birdie
  had already returned to England and before doing so had told the boy about
  his mother; as everyone had hoped, he had taken it well. Almost too well,
  indeed, for Charles's equanimity; it made him realize that Jane, like
  himself, had had little chance to enjoy parenthood during the rootless years
  imposed by his career, and that losing her for ever had been easier for
  Gerald than separation from Aunt Birdie when the latter left Parson's Corner
  &mdash;for then, Mrs. Fuessli said, had occurred the real privation. But even
  that had only been temporary; Gerald had soon recovered. Throughout the
  weekend with the Fuesslis his son's innocent happiness made Charles both sad
  and glad. It also made him act, perversely, the role of the Galsworthian
  English gentleman that the Fuesslis expected him to be even while they
  laughed at him for it&mdash;as if this laughter was the only return he could
  give for their kindness and generosity. They would never guess it, he knew,
  but the social freedom of America was something he passionately envied
  &mdash;or rather, it was something he wished he could have been involved in
  from his own early youth; as it was, there were all the conditioned reflexes
  of his upbringing hard at work to point out the flaws&mdash;one of which was
  the mood in which the local paper reported his arrival under the headline
  'British Blueblood Visits Parson's Corner'. It took him ten minutes to
  explain to Mrs. Fuessli that he had no blue blood, that his family was rather
  boastful of not having any, that blue blood was all nonsense anyhow, and that
  his father's title was the equivalent of Woolworth rather than Tiffany. But
  it took him the same ten minutes to realize that she would always continue to
  think of him as an English aristocrat, that she thought of all aristocrats as
  idlers and fortune-hunters even though they might appear to be rich
  themselves or to have jobs, and that her warm affection for Gerald was
  invincibly joined with a relish in sending Fauntleroy to the local nursery
  school where he mixed with all the other children of the town and was
  (everyone fortunately could agree on this) having a rare good time.</p>

  <p>So Charles left Parson's Corner in deep gratitude and slight dismay,
  thinking alternately that Gerald's life in America would not matter much when
  the war was over and he could return to England, and the next moment hoping
  that it WOULD matter, very much indeed, and that the boy would get something
  out of it of lasting value. Of course there was nothing for him, Charles, to
  do but wait. That joke he had had with the Fuesslis about taking Gerald to
  dinner on his seventeenth birthday was really a symbol of a father as well as
  a son growing up.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Charles reached London a few days before Pearl Harbour. It
was another
  turning point of the war, and the second that year. He kept thinking of
  Parson's Corner and how the news must have reached the Fuesslis&mdash;how
  they would doubtless be trying to explain to Gerald what had happened. He
  wrote them a long letter immediately, a letter so warmly personal and
  intimate he hoped it would finally convince them that, blueblood or not, he
  was a human being. He didn't know (until years later, when he didn't mind)
  that they had proudly sent it to the local paper in which, printed verbatim
  and with editorial endorsement, it had convinced the whole neighbourhood that
  he was a great English statesman and patriot.</p>

  <p>Now that Hitler's chief embroilment was with Russia, air-raids on London
  had almost ceased, though no one could forecast the duration of the respite
  and it was clearly impossible to relax any precautions. There was, however,
  an immediate burgeoning of social life&mdash;a pale but defiant shadow of
  what it had been before the war, yet in many ways pleasanter than those last
  sepulchral dinner parties of 1939, the tables then loaded with food and the
  conversation heavy with foreboding. Now, at the close of 1941, the tables
  were lighter but the talk was at least that of people who had proved
  something, if only the nature of themselves. Even the disasters of 1942 did
  not bring back the mood of that dismal year after Munich.</p>

  <p>Charles still took his turn at fire-watching but the absence of raids gave
  him more time off, and he was frequently invited out. Jane had made him a
  good talker, often by knowing when and how to talk to him; but now, he must
  presume, it was for his own sake and for his own unaided efforts he was
  sought after&mdash;which surprised him at first. Perhaps, he reasoned, it was
  because his work placed him near the centre of events, and people hoped he
  would spill secrets (it amused him to pretend to be doing this while actually
  avoiding it with great care). Or else it was because he was alone and easy to
  fit in. The real reason was one so simple that he hardly considered
  it&mdash;people liked him. His manners were rather pre-war, they admitted,
  and the things he said were sometimes a bit too clever in an older-fashioned
  way, but he was a decent fellow, always ready to do you a favour, and really,
  some of the things he said were sound enough, if only they had been put less
  elegantly. He was also, people thought, quite tolerably happy after a tragedy
  that might well have broken him; but in this they were wrong. Charles was not
  tolerably happy; he was tolerably unhappy. That is to say, he was unhappy,
  but he had found or made it tolerable.</p>

  <p>When his name was in the New Year Honours List there was much professional
  raillery. 'Oh God, look who's down for a C.B.E... STUFFY ANDERSON!' But then,
  as an afterthought: 'Well, it was about time he got something.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Havelock had another stroke in the summer of 1944; this one
was more
  disabling, affecting his left side and preventing him from taking more than a
  stumbling walk around the neighbouring streets. Gradually his world
  contracted to the room in which he spent most of his time, and from which he
  could see Big Ben and the twin towers of the Abbey. His mind had achieved a
  level of tranquillity that had not much impaired the quality of the brain,
  and it was odd to speculate on the difference in his fortunes if this mental
  change could have been inflicted in early life, and without the physical.
  Charles formed the habit of visiting his father for an hour or so before
  going to bed, no matter how late he returned from work or a social
  engagement; the old man enjoyed it, being fairly sleepless and fairly sleepy
  at all hours of the day and night. He liked to hear Charles's comments on the
  events of the evening, and Charles would repeat any special titbits of
  conversation he could remember. Charles found that he often enjoyed these
  post-mortems himself&mdash;so one-sided compared with those that he and Jane
  had shared, yet an agreeable way to sort out one's own impressions aloud and
  over a final drink.</p>

  <p>The buzz-bombs and V2s arrived, several within noisy distance of the
  house, but Havelock, though they failed to excite him in the old way, did not
  dislike them nearly as much as Charles did, and was able to rationalize the
  situation in terms that Charles had to admit were very rational indeed. 'At
  eighty-four you haven't got a life to lose. You have only a fraction of a
  life&mdash;and nobody would bet on it being more than a very small and vulgar
  fraction. So why should I worry?'</p>

  <p>'Or I,' said Charles, 'if I could look at it your way. My own fraction's
  climbing down. Couldn't possibly be much more than a half&mdash;and not the
  better half.'</p>

  <p>'Why not?'</p>

  <p>Charles laughed and parried the question, but when he was alone it was one
  he put to himself. WHY NOT? He thought of his life up to date; it wasn't hard
  to imagine a future that might be luckier. On the other hand, with buzz-bombs
  putt-putting overhead, it sometimes wasn't easy to imagine a future at all.
  Perhaps only old people and youths were always ready to indulge such a
  luxury.</p>

  <p>Havelock grew weaker gradually, and with the weakness came
  passionlessness, so that he could talk over old days and old issues without
  rancour. He told Charles once, quite calmly, that he had always been doubtful
  whether he were really his father at all, because the dates of his wife's
  return to him after their separation and of Charles's birth permitted the
  suspicion. Charles was not as shocked, or even as concerned, as he might have
  expected to be, but he was interested&mdash;and mainly because the idea
  seemed to offer a possible clue to many hitherto puzzling facets of
  Havelock's behaviour. He found also that the idea brought him closer to his
  father in sympathy, as if the spiritual tie of a revealed neurosis could be
  stronger than that of the body. He was almost disappointed when, on
  mentioning the matter to Cobb, the latter discounted it. The dates, Cobb
  said, made it nearly (though not quite) impossible, and besides that, there
  had been no whisper at the time, as would certainly have happened if any
  other man had been involved in the separation.</p>

  <p>'Then why DID she leave him?' Charles asked.</p>

  <p>'She couldn't stand him,' Cobb answered.</p>

  <p>They were both unwilling to discuss the matter further, except that Cobb
  brought up the matter of the family likeness. 'It's not just looks, sir
  &mdash;as it was with Mr. Lindsay&mdash;it's something hard to explain, but
  it's there, and I notice it more as you grow older. Of course you're nothing
  like your father in tastes and disposition, and yet... well, I wouldn't have
  any doubts if I were you, sir.' Cobb added, perhaps as an implied compliment
  (or else the reverse, Charles could not be certain): 'He was very handsome at
  your age.'</p>

  <p>'He still is.'</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;and there's a look about him now&mdash;sometimes when he's
  dozing in a chair with the sun on his face&mdash;he looks&mdash;well, sir, he
  looks just like a SAINT.'</p>

  <p>Cobb smiled at the notion, and Charles also smiled. SIR Havelock, yes
  &mdash;but SAINT Havelock was a bit too much.</p>

  <p>When he next saw his father Charles gave him what he hoped was the good
  news, expecting him to take more comfort from it than Charles could himself,
  for he knew by now that if he had been supplied with irrefutable proof that
  Havelock was not his father, his chief feeling would have been curiosity
  about who had been. He often wondered why his relationship with the old man
  had entered a phase of such warm indifference, such affectionately cynical
  toleration. He supposed it was largely because it was too late for anything
  else, yet still in time to realize that if you forgive people enough you
  belong to them, and they to you, whether either person likes it or not... the
  squatter's rights of the heart.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">There came the days of the German collapse, when a
future&mdash; personal,
  national, and world-wide&mdash;seemed to emerge from the clouds of doubt that
  had hung heavily for a decade. Presently Japan surrendered also; the war was
  totally over. It was the second such occasion in Charles's life, as in that
  of millions of others, and completely different from the first. There were no
  wild scenes, no bonfires to scorch the lions in Trafalgar Square, no
  celebrations that became riots. To Charles the big personal event was
  Gerald's return&mdash;a boy of nine with a decided American accent and a
  tendency to find fault with the way things were done in England. Charles knew
  no easy cure for this, but could not regard it as too deplorable, remembering
  as he did that England (and for that matter America too) had been made great
  by people who had found fault with the way things were done in England. But
  he felt there was some need to lessen a child's disappointment with a country
  whose cars and trains and ice-cream sodas were so small, so he took Gerald
  for a seaside holiday and hoped it made him feel happier. He could not be
  sure; the boy was not one for showing his emotions. Charles also talked to
  the headmaster of the prep school where Gerald would begin his first term in
  September. The head told him there would be several other new boys who had
  spent recent years across the Atlantic. 'They'll probably be ragged a bit at
  first.' (But later he wrote to Charles that it hadn't happened like that at
  all. 'So far from being at any disadvantage, the boys who have lived in the
  Great Democracy seem to have made themselves a sort of aristocracy that the
  other boys look up to. Remarkable.' Charles agreed that it was, but he was
  also much relieved.)</p>

  <p>One other thing he had been slightly concerned about was how Gerald would
  get along with Havelock. Of course there would only be the school holidays to
  present any problem, and even these would not be spent entirely at the house;
  nevertheless there was just the doubt in his mind that always existed in any
  human affairs connected even remotely with his father. But again to Charles's
  relief, everything happened as he could have wished&mdash;indeed, more so,
  for Havelock captivated the boy to a degree that almost presented a problem
  of its own. Charles could take sardonic comfort from thinking how like
  Havelock it was to show that as a grandfather he could succeed where Charles
  as a father seemed to have failed. But at any rate, Charles had to admit it
  eased the transition from American to English life by giving Gerald a
  personal excitement.</p>

  <p>Though still clear in mind, Havelock was weakening physically, and there
  came a time when he could put words on paper with less trouble than he could
  speak. This meant that one of his favourite pastimes was still available, and
  Charles often found him busy with the anthologies, composing new parodies of
  chosen poems. Some of his efforts were obscene or scatological in an earlier
  manner, but an increasing number were respectable, and a few were rather
  charming. On a September evening soon after Gerald had gone to school Charles
  came home late from a meeting and found Havelock bent sleepily over some
  pencilled pages. One, to his surprise, was in Gerald's handwriting&mdash;it
  was a poem the boy had learned at school in America&mdash;Joyce Kilmer's
  'Trees'. Apparently he had told his grandfather about this and had obligingly
  copied it out for him, and now Havelock had been at work on it. Charles would
  not have disturbed him for conversation but the old man opened his eyes and
  pointed to his effort. 'Just imagine,' he muttered, slurring over the words
  with difficulty, 'they made him learn it by heart over there. It's not a bad
  poem, but it's not as good as all that... Now read what I've made of it.'</p>

  <p>Charles read:</p>

  <p>I think however well you know 'em Trees aren't as lovely as a poem; No
  majesty of palm or pine Can rival Shakespeare's mighty line, Or grandeur of
  the sylvan glade Equal the spell that Wordsworth laid; Nor even in the
  Yosemite Where tops of trees are out of sight Can you find fairer things or
  finer Than in the verse of Heinrich Heine: Trees have been here since earth
  began, But poems only came with man.</p>

  <p>'Very pretty,' Charles commented, and might have left it at that had he
  thought twice. But it had been so long his habit to deflate Havelock gently
  whenever the occasion offered that even now he could not forbear to add: 'I'm
  afraid trees haven't been here since earth began, but they came earlier than
  mankind, so perhaps your point holds. Another flaw is that the last word of
  your seventh line isn't pronounced "Yosemite" to rhyme with "sight", but
  "Yosemmity", with the accent on the "sem".'</p>

  <p>Havelock looked considerably put out. 'Oh? How do YOU know?'</p>

  <p>'I've been there.' (He and Jane, en route to South America, had once
  travelled from New York to San Francisco and visited Yosemite on the
  way.)</p>

  <p>'You have, eh? You've really been all over the place, haven't you?'
  Havelock went on, with a touch of irritation: 'So it's Yosemmity? Well, we'll
  just have to change lines seven and eight, that's all. But not now&mdash; I'm
  too tired... You might give it a thought yourself, Charles, if you have
  time&mdash;you're a clever fellow... I want to send it to Gerald with my
  Sunday letter.'</p>

  <p>Havelock was already half-dozing and Cobb waiting to put him to bed.
  Charles said goodnight and went to bed himself. An hour later, while he was
  reading a detective story, an alternative couplet occurred to him:</p>

  <p>Nor even in remote Yosemite Where trees uprise to an extremity...</p>

  <p>He didn't think much of this, but as there seemed no possible rhyme except
  'extremity' it might well be as good as could be got. On the kind of impulse
  to please his father which came most often when they were not together, he
  tiptoed into the adjacent room, found him already asleep, and also the
  pencilled poem on the table beside his bed. Charles inserted the change, then
  went back to his own bed. But now he was wide awake himself, and vagrantly,
  with the theme of trees still on his mind, he thought of the trees so far
  from Yosemite and so much smaller, the little trees in Linstead, all planted
  by hand, the trees in Ladysmith Road that Mr. Mansfield had chosen, loved,
  and watched as they grew, and Mr. Mansfield himself, who would doubtless,
  given a choice of poems as well as trees, have preferred Joyce Kilmer's idea
  to Havelock's... Oh, the laburnum trees... He could not sleep for thinking of
  them, and of faces under their yellow blooms, and of the days and nights of
  his youth...</p>

  <p>In the morning Havelock was weaker and stayed in bed, but he had already
  seen the new lines and approved them, 'That's fine, Charles, that really does
  the trick. Now I can send it off to Gerald... Thank you, Charles. Thank you
  very much.' His eyes began to moisten, but this happened frequently now, with
  or without an emotion. 'Thank you, Charles,' he said again. 'You're not only
  a clever fellow, you're a GOOD fellow.'</p>

  <p>It was not quite the last conversation they had, but it was the last of
  the parodies, and Havelock's letter to Gerald enclosing it was the last of
  his letters to anybody. He did not get up again, and after falling asleep as
  usual one November night he was found by Cobb in the morning, half smiling in
  death, with no signs of distress or of a final struggle. 'One of the things
  you rarely see,' the doctor commented.</p>

  <p>Charles visited Gerald at school to tell him what had happened, and the
  boy burst into tears with more display of feeling than Charles had yet
  observed in him&mdash;and much more (from what Aunt Birdie had said) than
  when he had learned about his mother. Perhaps it was because he was now older
  and the loss was more recent. Or perhaps, Charles had to admit, Gerald had
  been Havelock's last conquest&mdash;the last and by all odds the most
  innocent. Proudly the boy showed his father the poem and the letter&mdash;a
  really delightful letter, warm and lively and humorous. It also contained a
  postscript to which Gerald naturally paid attention&mdash;a promise to give
  the boy 'the gold watch that the Shah of Persia gave me'.</p>

  <p>Neither Charles nor Cobb had ever heard of such a thing, but when
  Havelock's safe deposit box was opened, there it was, gaudy but undoubtedly
  gold&mdash;'presented to Havelock Anderson&mdash;September 10th, 1910'.
  Charles was still curious, and after some research discovered that Havelock
  had successfully represented the Shah in a claim against a London insurance
  company for jewels stolen from a Biarritz hotel.</p>

  <p>Besides the watch the deposit box yielded other discoveries, including the
  most varied collection of worthless stock and share certificates Charles had
  ever seen. He had long known that his father dabbled in the market, but he
  had always assumed the existence of a solid preponderance of sound
  investments. Now it became apparent that Havelock had lacked financial
  judgment as he had lacked many other kinds; but what dreams he must have had,
  Charles reflected, riffling through the scrip of long-defunct enterprises
  concerned with everything from no-sag spring mattresses to unbreakable
  gramophone records! Even the cash obtained from the sale of Beeching had been
  thrown away in Japanese bonds on the gamble that Japan would stay out of the
  war. (And yet, Charles remembered, it was Havelock who had had the
  premonition that Beeching would one day burn to the ground, and earlier
  still, just after the First World War, it was Havelock who had scouted
  Charles's easy assumption of a lifetime of peace... Perhaps Blainey's verdict
  applied as well, or at least as charitably, as any: all his life Havelock had
  been a rum fellow.)</p>

  <p>After paying debts and taxes the estate was worth a few hundred pounds, no
  more. To Charles, who had enough of his own, this came as no personal blow or
  even disappointment, but it saddened him as a final symbol of his father's
  worldly failure. Of the spiritual failure that mattered so much more, he
  hated to think at all, because at times he wondered if this were an
  inheritance that had passed to him in part already. He was in a lost and
  lonely mood as he settled up Havelock's affairs. He had never been certain
  that his feeling for his father amounted to love, but he missed him far more
  than he would ever have thought possible.</p>

  <p>Household changes followed inevitably. Cobb, now over seventy, had a
  handsome bequest in Havelock's will if only there had been money to pay it.
  Charles arranged for him to retire on a comfortable pension, since a widowed
  sister in Scotland was ready to share a home with him. Charles then gave up
  the Westminster house and was looking for something smaller when he was
  suddenly offered another diplomatic post. It was still only a First
  Secretaryship and in one of the less important European capitals, but he knew
  how few such jobs were available, with a whole crop of new men coming up on
  the heels of the older ones. Seniority was no longer the overriding factor,
  and bright youngsters were sometimes drawn now from other fields and pushed
  high on the ladder without ever having had to climb it. Charles did not think
  this bad, but he did feel (modestly) that it made the profession of diplomacy
  less attractive for a man like himself, and if he had been young again
  perhaps he would have tried something else. But he was not young, and here
  was a perfectly good First Secretaryship to say yes or no to. He said yes,
  even though it meant an immediate departure from London and missing Christmas
  with Gerald in Cheshire, where Aunt Birdie had invited them.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The years passed. Charles did pretty well, he thought, and
heard privately
  that some of the sly ironies he inserted into his briefs and memoranda were
  passed round the highest circles for amusement if not edification. But he had
  better be careful. Wit was apt to be dangerous in English life; nine times
  out of ten the Gladstones prevailed against the Disraelis&mdash;and he was
  only a duodecimo Disraeli.</p>

  <p>During this period the façade grew over the structure of his life in a
  thin crust of mannerism. He was aware of it, ruefully but with resignation,
  while memory reminded him of the danger. That memory was of the elderly
  professor who had taken him out for a breath of fresh air when he had
  collapsed over the desk on that hot day of his Cambridge Tripos examinations.
  Why, he had speculated then, did university dons grow up like that&mdash;
  finicky, desiccated, tee-heeish? Now he knew, or could guess; and the
  understanding was a warning. He found a corrective in thinking (as he could
  now without too much distress) of Jane, imagining her comments on this and
  that, hearing her voice exclaim, if he went too far in the dangerous
  direction: 'Oh, now, Andy, come off it!' Or she had said, as they went to a
  dinner party: 'If the Langlons are there, don't tell that story about the
  Dragoman and the Archbishop&mdash;you told it at the Nungessers' last year
  and the Langlons were there then.' (And it was a very amusing but long story
  which he told very well indeed.) Such things, among so many others, had made
  her a treasure; and he felt this absence every time he put on or took off his
  dress shirt. For those had been the moments, not the most important or
  profound in their lives, but the ones at which Jane had been most of all Jane
  &mdash;before or after a party.</p>

  <p>He did not get transferred to a more important post, and this made the
  prospect of an eventual Legation so dim that he quenched his hopes about it.
  It was not so much that he was past the age, meaning his own age, as that the
  age, meaning the post-war age, had in some sense passed him. It was hard but
  interesting to reckon why this was so, and he had a number of theories.
  Perhaps it was because in some frozen corner of the hierarchic mind there
  still lingered a breath of prejudice against him on account of that old
  misbehaviour of Havelock's. Perhaps it was because he did not know the
  correct people who were new, or the new people who were correct. Perhaps it
  was because at some dinner party there had been no Jane to stop him from
  being just too amusing about something or somebody. Perhaps it was because he
  dined out too often and knew too many people altogether. Perhaps it was
  because of the nickname, or the handwriting&mdash;which for some reason had
  tended to become even smaller with the years. Perhaps it was because he had
  been to Brookfield instead of Eton, or (in this new era of topsyturviness)
  because he had been to Brookfield at all instead of starting out with
  proletarian virtue from a state elementary school. Or perhaps it was simply
  because the world was changing. He had begun his career in an age when it was
  still an asset to a diplomat to be suave and witty and impeccably dressed;
  and he had lived into an age when the striped trousers and morning coat had
  become a symbol to many of all that was blameworthy for human ills, and when,
  perhaps because of this, generals and politicians and journalists were apt to
  take over from professional diplomats at every crisis. But the IGNORANCE of
  some of the supplanters&mdash;politicians especially! How often Charles had
  had to explain to elected representatives in the privacy of the Foreign
  Office facts of history and geography that were more appropriate to the lower
  fourth! And he had once had contact with an M.P. of much volubility on
  foreign affairs who mixed up Colombia with the District of Columbia and
  British Columbia; and of this man, when he became also a director of a large
  industrial combine, a lady admirer exclaimed: 'Don't you think, Mr. Anderson,
  he's a splendid example of how far a man can get nowadays without any of the
  advantages of upbringing or education?' To which Charles was unable to resist
  the reply: 'Yes, indeed&mdash;except that you should perhaps have said
  "DISadvantages".' It was possibly incidents like this that did not help
  Charles to become an Ambassador.</p>

  <p>He sometimes recalled what his old friend Weigall had said at Cambridge:
  'You and I, Andy, are stuck in between&mdash;we weren't born at Chatsworth or
  Blenheim, nor did we starve in tenements or pick crusts out of gutters
  &mdash;we just come from country homes with bits of land and families that go
  back a couple of centuries or so...' But when he reached as far as that in
  diagnosing his own case, a sense of proportion as well as of humour came to
  the rescue. For what if he had found, at the time when the matter cropped up,
  that Havelock had NOT been his father? Would he have cared much? He knew he
  wouldn't. Then where was his pride of ancestry, apart from his pride in what
  he could claim as ancestry? As for the bit of land, it was now a disused
  airfield, and as for the country home, it had been bombed and burned, and a
  score of young Englishmen (so he had been told) had met death in those old
  rooms with cards and glasses and billiard cues in their hands. To believe
  that blood mattered, in any sense that did not include theirs, was surely to
  be bloodguilty.</p>

  <p>During one of his leaves in London his boss at the Foreign Office invited
  him to a small bachelor dinner at which the other guests were a Minister of
  the Crown, a famous historian, a millionaire motor manufacturer, and a
  soldier who had held a position in the Middle East that enabled him to refer
  to Pontius Pilate as 'one of my predecessors'. Conversation was at times
  brilliantine if not brilliant; it was also more pessimistic about the future
  than Charles found pleasant to hear&mdash;his own favourite pessimisms being
  of a much gayer kind. The Minister of the Crown complained of a lack of
  potential leaders among the younger men in government, the motor manufacturer
  said Coventry could not seriously compete in world markets with Detroit, the
  soldier said the Russians would reach the Atlantic in three weeks if they set
  their army moving, and the historian offered comfort in the reminder that
  both Greece and Rome were much more powerful in the inheritance they left to
  succeeding ages than ever in their own actual heyday. Charles said next to
  nothing. Over the port the Minister further remarked that one of the most
  popular of all errors was to confuse prophecy with advocacy, so that a wise
  man often refrained from saying publicly what he thought would happen lest he
  be widely supposed to wish it to happen. The historian agreed and said it
  would be interesting to collect a few prophecies from persons who could feel,
  as they made them, completely unhampered by such a consideration&mdash;if,
  for instance, a man could set down honestly on a single sheet of paper what
  he forecast for the next century, the paper to be signed, put away, and
  guaranteed hidden till the year 2050. The Minister replied that by a curious
  coincidence he would be laying the foundation stone of an atomic research
  plant the following week, and it had already been arranged to seal under the
  stone such miscellaneous articles as current copies of The Times, ration
  books, coins, theatre programmes, and bus tickets. If those present that
  evening cared to write a few lines as the historian had suggested (devoting
  not more than, say, ten minutes to the task), he personally would undertake
  to place them along with the other items... The idea was taken up with an
  alacrity that soon became an absorption; rarely could an after-dinner
  argument have been so effectively launched and stifled. The butler brought
  paper, pens, and ink, the time was noted, and the six men began to write. As
  the least distinguished of the group, Charles knew his inclusion was only by
  courtesy, but this seemed to free him for a special kind of inspiration. He
  began as follows:</p>

  <p>My name is Charles Anderson. I belong to a somewhat out-of-date profession
  called diplomacy. This is a relic of the days when even wars were polite, so
  I'm naturally polite myself and also a bit of a relic. I'm supposed to have
  certain 'immunities' under international law, which means that in a foreign
  country I can drive a car to the common danger without being prosecuted. If,
  however, that country gets into a war, then I must share the common danger,
  since a neutral flag painted on a roof can't be seen at night from four miles
  high. And if my own country gets into a war and loses, I might be hanged as a
  criminal if I were important enough&mdash;so thank goodness I'm not. The
  whole thing would have been so unforeseeable a century ago that I doubt
  whether my own guesses about the coming century can be much better. Anyhow,
  one of them (fathered by the wish, of course) is that England will survive
  &mdash;and not only as an inheritance like Greece and Rome. We're such a
  damned peculiar people, such a mixed bag of stout fellahs and decent idiots,
  with a smattering of high-minded hypocrites and brainy saints. We don't quite
  fit the theories&mdash;Spengler's or Toynbee's or Marx's or anybody's. So we
  can't be counted on by the theorists&mdash;or counted out either. Perhaps God
  isn't bored with us yet (Victor Hugo's phrase, not mine). Perhaps we shall
  solve the trick of all tricks for this millennium&mdash;how to step down
  without falling over backwards, and then how to build the new must-be on the
  foundations of the old has-been. I won't see it happen, but my son may.</p>

  <p>Another guess is that what I'm writing now won't stay under a stone till
  2050. (Funny how the other fellows here seem to be taking that for granted.)
  But there's another kind of stone my father once came across in the
  churchyard at Pumphrey Basset&mdash;an ancient gravestone of a female dwarf
  with the inscription on it&mdash;'Parva sed apta Domino'. Somehow I wouldn't
  mind betting that will outlast an atomic research plant, and perhaps in the
  long run mean more...</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In his minute script, and writing fast because he did not
take the
  occasion too seriously, Charles was having an easier time (he surmised) than
  the other five, on whom posterity and the ticking clock seemed to impose a
  gruelling test. When the ten minutes were up and he had almost filled both
  sides of the paper, he passed it over without rereading and reached for the
  port while the others were begging an extra minute to make corrections.</p>

  <p>Musing thus on the future had set him thinking about Gerald, whom he would
  send in due course to Brookfield and Cambridge if only because he could not,
  in England at the middle of the twentieth century, think of anything better
  to do with the boy. I just as he preferred a dinner to be 'black tie', not
  because he was a snob, but because it avoided the problem of what else.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was about this time that he took up painting again with
full knowledge
  not only that his work would never be of consequence, but that even his
  talent was less than it had been thirty years before. His pleasure, though,
  was nearly as great, and perhaps enhanced by the small amateur reputation he
  acquired among people who really did not know much about art at all. Once, on
  a wet Sunday in a Mediterranean city, he painted&mdash;from memory and in his
  bedroom at the Legation&mdash;a curiously attractive portrait of his father,
  as he remembered him during the old man's last years. Havelock was sitting by
  the window of the Westminster house, staring out over wet pavements and the
  tops of umbrellas, with Big Ben and the Abbey towers in the misty twilight.
  'I made it rain for him,' Charles later explained to friends who had known
  Havelock and admired the portrait, 'just as I'd put a Sicilian peasant in the
  sun. His life was like a day that starts well, but then the clouds come up
  and it begins to pour and all the things you'd rather do have to be
  cancelled, but by the time evening comes you'll have found something else to
  do and you won't even look to see if the sky has stars in it. But it may
  have.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Later that year (1950) Charles again half expected
promotion. He was
  beguiled by a rumour that proved false, and in the dispassionate mood that
  followed he began to think of retirement. But then he was offered the chance
  of another switch to the Foreign Office, which suited him because he liked to
  live in London; so he put off the retirement and found the prospect of it an
  increasing comfort and even a mental stimulus. He felt mildly ambitious to do
  something, within the nearer reach, that would bring back the feeling of
  innocent schoolboy credit; on this, perhaps, he could make his bow at the
  Prizegiving of life and receive a smattering of applause from those who did
  not expect to see him again.</p>

  <p>And yet the very mildness of the ambition made it hard to accomplish. The
  feeling of near-success, which is also near-failure, followed him to Paris,
  where, as member of the British delegation to a somewhat second-string
  international conference, he could believe that his career had reached a peak
  &mdash;perhaps not its highest, perhaps not even high, but still a peak of
  sorts, and very likely the last.</p>

  <p>These things were in his mind during dinner at the Cheval Noir on Gerald's
  seventeenth birthday; they were in his mind as he followed the boy in a taxi
  across the city; they were in his mind as he sat in Rocher's ice-cream
  dispensary, facing his son and the girl his son had gone there to meet. 'He
  thinks it's wonderful,' she had said, 'that you should be representing
  England at the Conference.' How could he live up to or down to such an image
  in his son's eyes? It was just another thing to please and plague him, and
  suddenly he saw the gulf between father and son far wider than he had
  imagined, part of some structural rift of humanity.</p>

  <p>It might have bothered him further had he not just then received a second
  shock of a far more peremptory kind. For outside, only a few inches beyond
  the plate-glass windows, and peering in upon their little group with riveted
  attention, was the face of a man whom Charles least of all wanted to think
  about, much less encounter in the flesh. And the apparition, having seen that
  he was seen, began immediately to wave the kind of greeting Charles could not
  possibly ignore.</p>

  <p>So Charles waved back and was only able to explain that the intruder was
  one of the Conference delegates by the time that Palan, plump and clumsy, yet
  curiously notable as always, came threading his way amongst the tables
  towards them. 'This WOULD happen,' Charles muttered to himself.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">PARIS IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was not only that Charles did not want to see Palan; he
  would have been embarrassed to be discovered at a place like Rocher's by
  anybody. At the Cheval Noir a surprise of such a kind would have been barely
  tolerable, little as he wished to spread the news of that restaurant to
  outsiders; and at any ordinary Parisian pavement café, however proletarian,
  he could have summoned enough aplomb to meet even Sir Malcolm Bingay's eye.
  But to be spotted in an ice-cream parlour sucking a pink concoction through a
  straw... it simply did not add up to anything he could take in stride; it was
  like those dreams he sometimes had in which he realized, at the moment of
  being presented to a chef de cabinet at a garden party, that he was
  completely nude from the waist down.</p>

  <p>Nor did he expect that Palan would miss the ludicrousness of the
  situation. Doubtless it would stand him in good stead at the Conference in
  the morning&mdash;would acidify his attitude, revitalize his sarcasms. He had
  already found so much in Charles to poke fun at; from now on there would be
  more. Charles braced himself for an effort of courtesy as the fellow waited;
  clearly there was no alternative but to introduce him. He did so. Palan then
  bowed and stooped to kiss Miss Raynor's hand in a way that would please her
  all the more (Charles reflected) if she were unaware that in correct European
  circles one did not kiss the hands of unmarried women. And it was like Palan,
  who must certainly know that himself, to take the impertinent liberty or else
  to have sized her up as a susceptible American who would feel such gallantry
  to be one of the perquisites of foreign travel. Meanwhile Palan's eyes were
  roving over the scene with a certain ironic detachment. 'It looks very good,
  what you all have got in the glasses. What do they call it?' To Charles's
  regret Miss Raynor smiled and told him. 'Just a Raspberry frappé.'</p>

  <p>'So?' answered Palan, regarding it judicially. 'But I think not for me.'
  His loud and bad French was already drawing attention from nearby tables. 'I
  shall have Banane Split.' He sat down and shouted the order to the nearest
  waitress. Then he pulled out a handkerchief and began mopping his forehead.
  'I must explain that this is just bonne chance. I am walking along and I see
  M'sieur Anderson through the window. He looks so happy, eating his ice cream.
  It is a sign of the times, is it not, that the French are acquiring so many
  of your American habits... It used to be English&mdash;the rosbif&mdash; the
  afternoon tea... but now it is all American&mdash;ice cream, soda fountain,
  jukebox. But you, M'sieur Anderson&mdash;somehow I did not think of you as an
  addict&mdash;yet why not, after all? It is doubtless a treat for you too.' He
  turned again to Miss Raynor. 'I am a great admirer of things American!'</p>

  <p>The girl looked as if much of this had escaped her, but she caught its
  complimentary flavour and responded with a second smile that gave Charles a
  twinge of jealousy. It was not that he thought himself less physically
  attractive than Palan&mdash;on the contrary; but he could not help feeling
  that Palan's style of success with women should somehow be picketed as unfair
  to gentlemen.</p>

  <p>'It's Gerald's seventeenth birthday,' he said in French, relieved to have
  found an opening for a personal alibi. 'We were just celebrating.'</p>

  <p>'But of course.' Palan now turned his attention to Gerald. 'Seventeen! Ah,
  a wonderful age! And how long are you to be in Paris, Gerald?'</p>

  <p>(He called him Gerald already&mdash;and as easily as that! To Charles this
  was something else to be jealous of, yet confusingly to be appreciated as
  well.) Charles answered: 'He's leaving for England tonight.' He added: 'And
  Miss Raynor has to leave for America&mdash;also tonight.' He felt as if he
  were quietly closing doors in Palan's face.</p>

  <p>Palan then transferred his attention to Charles. 'Leaving us two old
  fogies here in Paris,' he commented; and Charles did not like the phrase, for
  he was sure Palan was nearer sixty than fifty.</p>

  <p>'But SEVENTEEN!' Palan was continuing. 'Can you guess where <i>I</i>was at
  seventeen?... In a military hospital&mdash;already I was wounded in battle.
  That was the Balkan War.' (Charles did the mental arithmetic&mdash;1911
  &mdash;it would make him fifty-eight.) 'I was what they called a hothead in
  those days&mdash;at sixteen I ran away from home to enlist&mdash;I lied about
  my age. I have told many lies since, but never one as crazy as that.' He
  suddenly rolled up his sleeve. 'You see? I have it still.' Along the whole
  length of a hairy forearm there ran a scar like a highway between forests.
  'You think I was a great patriot, eh? But no, I ran away because I thought I
  would prefer war to being at home. But I found war was even worse. My father
  used to beat us when we were young. He was very rich and loved to beat
  people. One day at last I beat him&mdash;and that was why I had to run
  away... They killed him after the Revolution. So you have trains to catch
  tonight, both of you? If my father had caught his train he would not have
  been killed. But he was late at the station and the train had gone. There
  were no more trains. That time comes in all our lives some day&mdash;when
  there are no more trains. But I hated him. And now&mdash;just to make things
  equal&mdash;my son hates me.'</p>

  <p>'You have a son?' Charles said, with so little reason to be astonished
  that he wondered why he was even interested.</p>

  <p>'I have five&mdash;and seven daughters&mdash;but the son who hates me is
  the only one who has anything to do with me. Life is like that.'</p>

  <p>'Why does he hate you?'</p>

  <p>'Because he is a hothead too&mdash;though not the kind I was. He is a cold
  hothead. He is in charge of soil conservation in the province of Alma
  Valchinia, but already he is talked of as a coming man. And at twenty-four!
  What a career! Why, when I was that age I was wrecking trains with dynamite
  &mdash;I was ACTIVIST! You could not have made me spend my life examining
  dirt!'</p>

  <p>Charles wished that Palan would not shout; it was unseemly that such a
  conversation should be overheard, though he supposed that Palan cared as
  little for that as for his other eccentricities. Charles was glad when the
  Banana Split arrived. He noticed that Palan attacked it with a zest that was
  either childlike or wolfish&mdash;depending, Charles mused, on how far one
  had gone in finding excuses for the fellow.</p>

  <p>'You like it?' Miss Raynor said, watching Palan quite tranquilly. She
  spoke in English, though she had no reason to suppose he understood. Then,
  however, he answered in English with a definite American accent: 'Do YOU?
  <i>I</i> think they make them far better at Schrafft's.'</p>

  <p>Miss Raynor laughed incredulously. 'SCHRAFFT'S? That's where I often have
  lunch. There's one next to my office.'</p>

  <p>'You have an office, Anne?' (And even 'Anne' already!)</p>

  <p>'I work in one... So you know New York, Mr. Palan?'</p>

  <p>'For three years I lived there. Central Park West. I know the Stork Club
  and also the Automat. I have stayed at Ellis Island and also at the
  Waldorf-Astoria. I have eaten hot dogs and caviare.'</p>

  <p>'But not together? Or perhaps that's no worse than cheese and apple
  pie.'</p>

  <p>Palan laughed loudly and patted the girl's hand. But Charles was
  reddening. He could not enjoy the joke because he was thinking that after all
  those Conference sittings during which he had suffered Palan's bad French, it
  now turned out that the man could just as well have spared him such an ordeal
  &mdash;or at least have substituted the lesser one of his English! But it was
  not the memory of the French that bothered Charles most, but the possibility
  that on several occasions Palan might have caught a few words of English that
  Charles had whispered to Sir Malcolm&mdash;a few witty but tart asides,
  prompted by some specially irritating attitude of Palan's, but not wholly
  excusable, not really sanctioned by the codebook of good manners. The thought
  that Palan might have heard and understood made Charles feel slightly
  ashamed, and the conclusion that, even if so, Palan had clearly not minded a
  bit, made Charles feel also annoyed. Perhaps, after all, the fellow was as
  thick-skinned as those who opposed him needed to be.</p>

  <p>Palan was still continuing, in English: 'But I was telling you about my
  son. He is a model. He does not smoke or drink or have women. You cannot
  bribe him&mdash;or plead with him&mdash;you cannot even make him laugh. When
  <i>I</i> laugh he probably reports it to the secret police.'</p>

  <p>Charles moved uncomfortably. This was definitely not the sort of talk to
  be indulged in loudly by any diplomat of any nation in any language in a
  public place. He wondered if Palan were slightly drunk, or perhaps
  exceedingly drunk in some unique way of his own. This gave Charles a
  solicitude that was entirely professional&mdash;in the freemasonry of
  diplomacy, if it still existed to any degree at all, one could surely pass a
  hint of warning even to an adversary. Charles said, therefore, to change the
  subject: 'I agree that stuff isn't as good as it could be, though you
  certainly seem to be getting through it.'</p>

  <p>Palan refused or was unaware of the hint. 'My son is not like me,' he
  continued. 'He speaks carefully, he works carefully, he does everything
  carefully. And correctly. And quietly. He would not raise his voice in
  sending you to the firing squad. But it is worse when he lectures on
  soil-conservation. Then you are so bored you WISH to be sent to the firing
  squad.'</p>

  <p>Charles turned abruptly to Miss Raynor. 'I'm sorry about dinner. It's too
  bad you weren't with Gerald and me.'</p>

  <p>'Thanks, Mr. Anderson, but I knew it was a special occasion&mdash;I expect
  you had a good time on your own.'</p>

  <p>'Oh... so he DID mention it?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, he said you'd had this date for years&mdash;to take him to dinner
  when he was seventeen. I think that's charming.'</p>

  <p>'It really began as a joke,' said Charles, and he told of the incident
  with Mrs. Fuessli when Gerald was six.</p>

  <p>'FUESSLI, did you say?'</p>

  <p>Charles nodded and spelt it.</p>

  <p>'It's such an unusual name I wonder if they're the same people I know.
  They live in Connecticut&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;a small place. Parson's Corner.'</p>

  <p>'That's it&mdash;they MUST be the same&mdash;Mr. Fuessli has a hardware
  business&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'&mdash;and Mrs. Fuessli's very pretty.'</p>

  <p>'I'll tell her you said so.'</p>

  <p>'They're both well, I hope. Charming people. I haven't heard from them
  lately.'</p>

  <p>'They're fine and they'll be so thrilled to know I've met you here like
  this.'</p>

  <p>Palan suddenly banged his spoon on the table top like a child to whom
  enough attention has not been paid. 'So you two both know the same people in
  America! Is that not wonderful? You will tell me now that it is a small
  world. But it is not. It is a big world... But I can pretend it is small too.
  LOOK... do you see that man out there&mdash;standing against the lamp-post
  pretending to read a newspaper?' He pointed through the windows. 'That man
  also is thrilled to know that I am meeting you here.'</p>

  <p>This would never do; Charles was now convinced that Palan was drunk. He
  looked at his watch; thank goodness it was already past eleven. He said,
  calling for the bill: 'We really mustn't make you cut it too fine, Gerald
  &mdash;I'll leave you to take care of Miss Raynor... Palan, if you're going
  my way...'</p>

  <p>To his relief Palan seemed ready enough to leave, though only after
  ceremonious farewells. Charles shook hands with Gerald and the girl; while he
  was doing this Palan grabbed the bill and tipped the waitress extravagantly
  and ostentatiously. Charles frowned at this climax of bad manners, but
  somehow, remembering his own on those several occasions at the Conference, he
  found that with barely a gesture of protest he could take Palan's arm and
  marshal him into the street.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At the kerbside Palan said in French: 'That ice cream is
bad for the
  stomach. Let us go to my hotel and get some cognac.'</p>

  <p>'No, if you want a drink come to mine. And since you speak English why
  don't we stick to that language?'</p>

  <p>'All right, but you come to MY hotel. It cannot be your everything&mdash;
  YOUR language&mdash;YOUR son's birthday... how much more do you want? You
  come to MY hotel.'</p>

  <p>Whatever reason Palan had for demanding this was a reason why Charles
  should not consent to it, so he said merely: 'I think perhaps it's too late
  for a drink anyhow. We both have work tomorrow.' He hailed a taxi and gave
  the address of Palan's hotel; he would drop him there on the way to the
  Crillon. Palan made no further mention of the drink and from this Charles
  concluded that his earlier insistence on having it at his hotel had been
  merely a whim. But of course one could never be sure. To such a level had
  social intercourse between accredited diplomats reached by the middle of the
  twentieth century.</p>

  <p>Inside the taxi as they began the journey back to the more fashionable
  boulevards Palan remarked: 'A very fine boy, M'sieur Anderson. I congratulate
  you.'</p>

  <p>'Thanks.'</p>

  <p>'And the girl too. She is HIS girl?'</p>

  <p>'Oh no&mdash;just someone he met in Switzerland. They played tennis
  together.'</p>

  <p>'But he is in love.'</p>

  <p>'I doubt that. Probably just a holiday acquaintance&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'The perfect structure for a love affair. A few days only, with goodbye at
  the end! It is in countless dramas, in epic poetry, in grand opera&mdash;
  '</p>

  <p>'I daresay, and most of them Gerald wouldn't care for at all. He's rather
  realistic, and so's Miss Raynor, as far as I could judge.'</p>

  <p>'You like her?'</p>

  <p>'She seemed very nice.'</p>

  <p>'So that if your son really wanted to marry her&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'At SEVENTEEN?'</p>

  <p>'At seventeen, my friend, I was already a father... You find that hard to
  believe?'</p>

  <p>'By no means. You had also, so you say, fought in your first war. In
  England we try not to do things quite so early.'</p>

  <p>'And to balance that, you do many things late&mdash;perhaps too late.'</p>

  <p>'Possibly. And I'm glad to say that a great many things we don't do at
  all.' Charles shot that back as if to say: I too can bandy words, if you
  insist.</p>

  <p>Palan continued: 'I suppose you wish Gerald eventually to make un beau
  mariage dans le monde?'</p>

  <p>'I hope he'll make a happy marriage, that's all.'</p>

  <p>'You mean you would not object to an office girl as a daughter-in-
  law?'</p>

  <p>'Good heavens, no. What do you take me for&mdash;a snob?'</p>

  <p>'Of course&mdash;because it is one of the coefficients of power. Your
  country's power is now in decline, so you are trying hard to diminish the
  snobbery. It will make you a very attractive people provided you do not
  succeed too well. I would like to discuss this further with you some
  day.'</p>

  <p>'If we had more time. I don't recall how we got on to the subject, but
  &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'We were talking about Gerald and Miss Raynor.'</p>

  <p>'Since they'll soon be catching their trains in different directions,
  there really isn't much to talk about.'</p>

  <p>'If they DO catch those trains. My father did not catch his. He delayed
  too long, trying to persuade his mistress to leave the country with him
  &mdash;my mother, of course, had gone on ahead with the family jewels. She
  died at Monte Carlo twenty years later, whereas my father missed his train
  and&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I know&mdash;you told us. But I assure you Gerald won't miss his.'</p>

  <p>'How can you be sure?'</p>

  <p>'Well, for one reason, he has an appointment with his dentist in London
  tomorrow morning.'</p>

  <p>Palan seized Charles's hand and shook it amidst his loud guffaws. 'My
  friend, it is the most perfect of all reasons. Credo quia impossibile
  est.'</p>

  <p>'Or because he said so&mdash;that'll do for me.' (But would it, after the
  lie about the boat-train?) Charles added, with extra conviction to mask his
  growing uncertainty: 'They'll catch their trains, don't worry.'</p>

  <p>'And what will it prove?'</p>

  <p>'Does it have to prove anything?'</p>

  <p>Palan guffawed again. 'Anatole France put it well. "De toutes les
  aberrations sexuelles, la plus singulière, c'est la chasteté".'</p>

  <p>Charles was amused in spite of himself. 'You seem to have quite a range
  &mdash;Tertullian, Anatole France... what next, I wonder?'</p>

  <p>'An epigram of my own... tennis among the Alps, ice cream in Paris&mdash;
  bless their innocent little hearts... the Incorruptibles... whereas you and I
  &mdash;in our far different ways&mdash;we are the Incorrigibles.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not sure I know exactly what you mean.'</p>

  <p>'That is what makes it so funny&mdash;that in your own way you also should
  be so innocent. What has protected you? Are you a deeply religious man?'</p>

  <p>Charles found this question too baffling either to be answered or
  resented. He said: 'I wouldn't say so, but if I were, I wouldn't say so
  either.'</p>

  <p>'Then you are very rich?'</p>

  <p>That was easy. 'No... far from it. But I don't see what all this has to do
  &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Do you think the capitalist system will survive?'</p>

  <p>'WHAT?... Well, what a question!'</p>

  <p>'Yes, is it not? I should have thought you would have had your answer
  ready&mdash;as we would on our side. But perhaps you are not so
  confident.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps also we're not so interested. It's you people who've made it the
  only question to be asked. We believe it's only one&mdash;and not the most
  important&mdash;that has to be answered.'</p>

  <p>'That also I would like to discuss with you if there were time.'</p>

  <p>Thank goodness there isn't, Charles reflected, as the taxi came to a halt
  outside Palan's hotel. 'Here you are,' he said, helping Palan to the
  pavement. 'We shall meet again in a few hours and meanwhile I think we both
  need some sleep... Good night.'</p>

  <p>'Good night, my friend.' Palan pressed Charles's hand with a boozy but not
  effeminate tenderness. 'I have enjoyed talking with you. It is very funny
  today to be an English gentleman. It is almost as funny as to be an
  anarchist. Both are out of style... Au 'voir, M'sieur.'</p>

  <p>Charles waited to see him safely through the revolving doors, then
  continued his own journey to the Crillon. What a day, he summarized, as he
  mixed himself a drink in his room and made another jotting for the book he
  was going to write. 'It is very funny today to be an English gentleman
  &mdash;almost as funny as to be an anarchist.' Not bad, not bad. He also put
  down the quotation from Anatole France.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">But he lay awake thinking mainly about Gerald. It was a
different sort of
  concern from the one he had had earlier; milder but more persistent, just a
  small private regret&mdash;not that the boy should have preferred Miss
  Raynor's company to his (how natural that was), but that he should have
  chosen not to mention her during the dinner. And evidently, but for the way
  things had happened, Charles would still have been in ignorance of her
  existence. It showed how little a son could wish to confide in a father...
  but then Charles had to add to himself&mdash;'as if I didn't know that
  already'. Which brought him back to old thoughts, and the extent to which he
  had tried (and perhaps failed) to come closer to Gerald than Havelock had to
  him, and the extent to which his failure (if any) had been an inheritance as
  lasting as the gold watch that had belonged to the Shah. Well, he had tried
  at least, and whether he had so far failed or not, he knew he must go on
  trying. He decided that when he got back to England he would take Gerald on
  some holiday of their own&mdash;the Lake District or North Wales, perhaps;
  and to clinch the idea in his mind he made the amazing concession: 'Why, I'll
  even watch him play tennis, if that's what he'd like.' This, surely, was il
  gran rifiuto of some kind or other, and having made it, he fell asleep.</p>

  <p>When he walked through the hotel lobby the next morning he saw Miss Raynor
  sitting on a couch reading a newspaper. He was more than surprised; he
  remembered Palan's remark about not catching trains and was perturbed. Was it
  POSSIBLE...? He walked over, greeting her with a smile only.</p>

  <p>'You're staying here too?' she exclaimed, showing some surprise and
  perturbation of her own.</p>

  <p>'Why, yes... but shouldn't I have said it first?'</p>

  <p>'I know&mdash;or rather, I didn't know&mdash;I mean, I didn't know you
  were staying here. I just came here because I&mdash;I'd booked here weeks
  ago.'</p>

  <p>'Very sensible&mdash;they're often full up unless you do that.'</p>

  <p>He regarded her with kindly shrewdness, as if to say: Are you going to
  tell me or do I have to ask you? Evidently the latter, for after a pause he
  continued: 'I thought you were leaving for Cherbourg last night?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I&mdash;I intended to at first, but&mdash;but after I saw Gerald off
  on his train...'</p>

  <p>'So he left?' Even unaccented the question seemed clumsy; he added
  hastily: 'I daresay I got things muddled... Have you had breakfast?' And to
  forestall an answer: 'Perhaps another cup of coffee?'</p>

  <p>'But aren't you on your way&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'The Conference starts at eleven. I usually walk over for exercise&mdash;
  it's not far. But this morning I'll ride.'</p>

  <p>They found a corner table in the restaurant. She seemed preoccupied, and
  while he chattered fluently about Paris and Switzerland and as much about the
  Conference as she could read in the papers, he too was preoccupied. When the
  coffee arrived she said abruptly: 'I'll have to tell you the truth. I've been
  trying to invent something for the past few minutes but it just won't work
  &mdash;because I expect you'll tell Gerald you met me again here.'</p>

  <p>'I daresay I might have, but not unless you wish.'</p>

  <p>'He thinks I'm on my way to America.'</p>

  <p>'So did I.' Charles smiled encouragingly.</p>

  <p>'I'd like him to go on thinking so.'</p>

  <p>Charles waited for her to continue. Being of a professionally suspicious
  nature he was reflecting how easy it would be (though perhaps unnecessary) to
  telephone his London flat to find if Gerald had already arrived there.</p>

  <p>She went on: 'I don't know how I can explain it without seeming either
  &mdash;priggish or&mdash;or boastful&mdash;or something I hope I'm not.'</p>

  <p>'I don't think there's much fear of you seeming that.'</p>

  <p>'So I'd better just tell you the truth? Well... the fact is... Gerald has
  an idea he's in love with me.'</p>

  <p>He waited again, remembering that this too was what Palan had said.</p>

  <p>She went on: 'I don't suppose he told you.'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'Probably he was afraid you'd think it too silly.'</p>

  <p>Charles said gently: 'I hope he wasn't afraid of that. I never think any
  kind of love is silly. And I'm not sure what the difference is between being
  in love and having an idea you are&mdash;especially when you're young.'</p>

  <p>'But seventeen's perhaps TOO young&mdash;for thirty-three.'</p>

  <p>'Thirty-three?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Quite a problem if we were BOTH in love.' She flushed a little. 'And
  rather embarrassing to have to explain all this to his father.'</p>

  <p>'It needn't be embarrassing. It could all very easily have happened... But
  tell me how it did happen.'</p>

  <p>'We met a couple of weeks ago&mdash;at Mürren. Of course I liked him
  immediately&mdash;perhaps I encouraged him at first, without intending to. We
  talked and argued.'</p>

  <p>'What about?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, politics, religion, economics, the state of the world&mdash;life in
  general. He's at the age for argument, and I can always enjoy one.'</p>

  <p>'So can I&mdash;though&mdash;for him&mdash;perhaps I seem to have passed
  the age.' That sounded rather sad, so he went on gallantly: 'It's quite
  possible you know my son better than I do.'</p>

  <p>'Oh no, of course not.'</p>

  <p>'Tell me about him, anyway. What do you think of him?'</p>

  <p>'You really want my opinion?'</p>

  <p>'Very much.'</p>

  <p>'Well, to begin with, he's first-rate company&mdash;clever&mdash; serious
  and yet gay about it&mdash;full of enthusiasms and idealisms. He's less
  inhibited than most English boys, I should guess. And all-round in his
  interests&mdash;games as well as studies. Dances well, for instance. He asked
  me to a dance at the hotel.'</p>

  <p>'And to play tennis?'</p>

  <p>'No, I suggested that.'</p>

  <p>'He said you were good.'</p>

  <p>'I wasn't bad, considering I hadn't played for years. He's quite good. We
  won against some people who were very bad indeed.'</p>

  <p>Charles nodded. It was not unlike certain occasions that in his own
  professional career had ranked as successes. He was thinking of this when she
  added: 'That's really the whole story.'</p>

  <p>'Is it?' He smiled. 'Well... so much for l'affaire suisse.'</p>

  <p>'Don't joke about it.'</p>

  <p>'I'm sorry. You play tennis&mdash;I make jokes&mdash;each of us, it seems,
  has a way of dealing with a delicate situation.'</p>

  <p>She laughed then, for the first time. 'But you like making jokes&mdash;
  far more than I like playing tennis.'</p>

  <p>'I should hope so... But seriously, how did the scene change to
  Paris?'</p>

  <p>'Because I left Switzerland when my stay there was finished&mdash;I've
  been in Germany since&mdash;so he wanted to meet me here&mdash;just once
  &mdash;before I finally go home. I told him there wouldn't be time, as I was
  only just passing through, but he said it so happened he'd be in Paris anyway
  &mdash;because he was having dinner with you.'</p>

  <p>'Plausible.'</p>

  <p>'I still tried to put him off, but he said he was sure his dinner with you
  would end in time to give us an hour or so. He seemed to think you'd want to
  go to bed early during the Conference.'</p>

  <p>'He just thought of everything, eh?'</p>

  <p>'He put me in a spot where I couldn't refuse.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I don't really blame him.'</p>

  <p>'I hope you don't blame me either. If I hadn't kept up the pretence of
  leaving I think he'd have changed all his own plans and cancelled his
  appointments in London today. Of course I didn't want him to do that.'</p>

  <p>'So there really ARE appointments?'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes. One of them's this morning&mdash;with his dentist. He told me all
  about it. He's very punctilious about such things. Almost ascetic in some
  ways&mdash;doesn't drink or smoke&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'He did both&mdash;a little&mdash;at dinner with me last night.'</p>

  <p>'Then he loves you,' she said softly. 'The oddest things can prove love,
  can't they? And since you asked me, I must tell you what a delightful son you
  have... the uninhibited ascetic. All those early formative years in America
  and then an English school&mdash;really, you couldn't have devised anything
  more ingenious... I hated to lie to him, especially when I was seeing him off
  and he thought I was just going to another platform to catch MY train.'</p>

  <p>'You were lucky&mdash;and clever&mdash;to have managed it so well. When
  ARE you leaving?'</p>

  <p>'Next Tuesday. By air.'</p>

  <p>Charles looked at his watch. 'I&mdash;I can't put into words&mdash; quite
  all&mdash;that I feel... and how grateful I am to you for&mdash;for being so
  kind to him. I'm fond of that boy, though he probably doesn't realize
  it&mdash;why should he?&mdash;we've had so little chance to get to know each
  other.' He turned the slight tremor of his voice into the beginnings of a
  laugh. 'Just one more question&mdash;sheer curiosity &mdash;before I have to
  go... Why Rocher's?'</p>

  <p>'I know&mdash;of all places. But even that was sweet of him. He thought
  because I'm American it was what I'd enjoy most.'</p>

  <p>'Then you've given me the right cue&mdash;will you dine with me one
  evening at a place I know you will enjoy?'</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;if you won't be disappointed.'</p>

  <p>'Why should I be?'</p>

  <p>'Gerald told me you're a great authority on food and wine. I'm not. I just
  love good eating and talking.'</p>

  <p>'One of which I promise and the other you're bound to supply
  yourself.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, now, PLEASE... Is that the kind of thing diplomats have to say at
  conferences?'</p>

  <p>'If only it were... What about tonight?'</p>

  <p>'Fine... and by the way, why did YOU come to Rocher's?'</p>

  <p>'That's one of the embarrassing things <i>I</i> might have to confess
  &mdash;during dinner.'</p>

  <p>And so it was arranged. Before he finally left she said 'Good luck', and
  as he rode to the Conference he felt both in need of and fortified by it.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Sir Malcolm Bingay was still indisposed and Charles had to
carry the ball
  &mdash;to use an athletic metaphor which seemed to him singularly
  inappropriate. Most of the day he was embroiled with Palan, who gave no sign
  of any effects of the previous evening's dissipation&mdash;or indeed, of
  having had any social intercourse with his opponent at all. Charles was
  puzzled but not altogether surprised. His own strategy in such circumstances
  was to ease himself into a situation like a key into a lock, to see first if
  it fitted before one tried even the slightest turn. All morning he performed
  this fitment, matching Palan's performance by one of his own that was perhaps
  equally baffling; but in the afternoon he gave the first sharp twist by
  interjecting a phrase of English into his French and adding (in French): 'I
  will not translate for the benefit of M'sieur Palan, because I have a feeling
  I shall be understood.' Palan did not bat an eyelid.</p>

  <p>The whole day was a nerve-exhausting stalemate, a laborious exploration of
  deadlock.</p>

  <p>In the evening Charles took Anne Raynor to a small restaurant near Les
  Halles. He put on a black tie and was interested to note that her dress would
  have been suitable whether he had or not. He also noted that she knew more
  about food and wine than might have been expected from her disclaimer. All
  these matters, however, were secondary to the fact that he liked her and that
  their shared affection for Gerald seemed to bring them into a warm contact.
  During the day he had had to telephone his London flat on some business
  matter, and his housekeeper had mentioned that Gerald had arrived there in
  time for breakfast (not that Charles had really had doubts). He told Anne
  that Gerald must have had a tiresome day. 'I can't imagine anything worse
  than going to a dentist after an all-night train-and-boat journey&mdash;
  except perhaps the kind of day I've just had myself, arguing with that fellow
  who joined us last night at Rocher's. The odd thing is that personally I
  don't dislike him. He fascinates me slightly. He has a peculiar trick&mdash;
  I'm sure it's a trick&mdash;of making you feel he's always just about to see
  your point of view. Of course he never does. He can't let himself. He has his
  line to follow and daren't deviate by a hair's-breadth. Only you don't always
  know what the line is till you've wasted hours in futile debate. That's
  another trick they have&mdash;physical exhaustion as a weapon.'</p>

  <p>'Don't you also have to follow a line?'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes, but not so slavishly. We allow ourselves a little leeway. If I
  might make a parallel, Palan's side are the trams, but we're the
  trolley-buses... What was your impression of him, by the way?'</p>

  <p>'I'd say he's an interesting character... No, I don't dislike him
  either.'</p>

  <p>'He's a braggart and I'm sure half the things he says about his past are
  lies.'</p>

  <p>'But if the other half are true it would still be remarkable. Do you
  really think he was being watched as he said last night?'</p>

  <p>'By his own men, possibly. Nobody's ever trusted completely on their
  side.'</p>

  <p>'I wonder why he joined us then. Couldn't it get him into trouble?'</p>

  <p>'I thought of that too. He wanted me to go back to his hotel afterwards
  for a drink. I fancy he'd drunk a little too much himself. He was talking in
  a rather wild way. Of course I didn't go.'</p>

  <p>'In case he might be trying to trap you?'</p>

  <p>'Into what?... No, it's hard to give a reason, except one's general
  suspicion of those fellows. Their code's different, therefore you have to be
  on your guard all the time. A strange thing, diplomacy, nowadays&mdash;full
  of novelties.' He felt he had better turn the subject a little. 'Television,
  for instance, in your country. I understand Gladwyn Jebb made a great hit
  that way recently. How would Metternich or Castlereagh or Disraeli have taken
  to it, I wonder?'</p>

  <p>'I think Disraeli would have been fine if he'd remembered to be like
  George Arliss.'</p>

  <p>'Then Abraham Lincoln should really have sounded like Charles Laughton,
  but I'm quite sure he didn't.'</p>

  <p>She laughed. 'I don't think YOU need worry, television or not. You're
  rather like most Americans' idea of an English diplomat.'</p>

  <p>'That alarms me. Perhaps it also explains why I haven't climbed any higher
  in my profession... You know what they call me?' Some faintly masochistic
  urge propelled him to the disclosure. 'STUFFY ANDERSON.' There&mdash;he had
  said it. It was always a barrier that had to be crossed, and in any
  friendship whose progress pleased him he always wanted to mention it first,
  rather than have it later discovered.</p>

  <p>She said casually: 'Yes, I know. Gerald told me.'</p>

  <p>'What? HE knew? Now how would... oh, well, I suppose there are all sorts
  of ways.'</p>

  <p>'He said it showed how popular you were.'</p>

  <p>Charles was somewhat consoled. 'Nice of him to think so&mdash;or to
  pretend that he did. But I don't believe he's altogether right. Not that I'm
  unpopular&mdash;far from it. But many of my colleagues probably think the
  nickname suits, and I daresay it does&mdash;I'm a bit of a back number in
  some ways... For instance&mdash;my reason for coming to Rocher's last night
  &mdash;I said I might have to confess it to you.' He then explained about
  Gerald's fidgetiness during dinner and the excuse of the fictitious
  boat-train for an early departure. 'Of course it was just because he wanted
  to meet you&mdash;I don't really blame him at all. But I was curious, and
  also, well, being the old-fashioned person I am, I thought he might have
  plans that would land him in some less desirable company... So I followed
  him. What an ignoble suspicion to have had, and what an out-of-date thing to
  do! But you see, it's the old world that I remember&mdash;old in history as
  well as in geography.'</p>

  <p>'I've sometimes found the new world not so young.'</p>

  <p>'It would be a comfort to think so. And back numbers ARE&mdash;
  occasionally&mdash;more readable than the latest. As an editor, hasn't that
  ever worried you?'</p>

  <p>'Why are you talking to me like this?'</p>

  <p>'I really haven't the slightest idea&mdash;unless it's because I'm tired
  after bickering with Palan all day. To him I've got to appear always alert
  and combative&mdash;whereas with you I can relax and be myself.'</p>

  <p>'But you're not yourself when you're too modest.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I am&mdash;and also when I'm conceited. I'm both.'</p>

  <p>She turned to him with a slow serene scrutiny, then asked: 'What sort of
  life have you had?'</p>

  <p>'LIFE? My life?'</p>

  <p>'Has it been happy&mdash;or&mdash;or rather unhappy?'</p>

  <p>But this was going too far; he woke abruptly from the trance of
  self-revelation into which his tiredness and her comfort had made him slip.
  He answered, talking fast while he pulled himself into control: 'You
  Americans&mdash;it's the PURSUIT of happiness, isn't it, not the happiness
  itself, that's laid down as one of the aims of your republic? My father used
  to point that out... So to you it might seem that I haven't pursued happiness
  very successfully. You might even say, if you knew, that once or twice it's
  pursued me and I've run away from it. That, of course, is unforgivable, and I
  think had I been born in America I should at least have stood my ground...
  But as for calling my life&mdash;as a whole&mdash;UNhappy, I'd certainly say
  no to that. Oh, definitely no&mdash;at least nothing to complain of
  &mdash;mainly run of the mill... A little more wine? Good... Things kept
  happening&mdash;the usual mixed bag of events&mdash;and they still are. This
  evening, for instance&mdash;how delightful! Such a long time, Anne, since I
  enjoyed myself so&mdash;er&mdash;so UNSPEAKABLY. Meeting you last night was
  quite an event&mdash;for which, to be fair, I have to thank my son, haven't
  I, and the fact that he was so willing to deceive his father! Unscrupulous
  but&mdash;in the circumstances&mdash;very fortunate. And not silly. Oh no.
  Love can be many things, but that isn't one of them. People who say so have
  never known it&mdash;or else have forgotten it. I was a few years older than
  Gerald when I first had the experience, and the girl&mdash; she was actually
  younger than he is now. There were people then who said it was silly. I
  didn't think so, and I've never thought so since.'</p>

  <p>'What became of her?'</p>

  <p>'She married somebody else&mdash;and happily, I believe.'</p>

  <p>'You also married somebody else?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. And that was happy too&mdash;until&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I know.'</p>

  <p>'Gerald again the informer?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, if you put it that way.'</p>

  <p>'I hope, then, he also told you&mdash;though he could hardly have
  remembered&mdash;what a remarkable woman my wife was. She was great fun and
  she had courage and loyalty and she knew how to get her own way with people.
  She helped me tremendously in my work. She...' The waiter came and took his
  order for another bottle of wine. He had drunk very little. He went on
  smoothly, but as if it were not what he had been going to say: 'She usually
  stopped me from making a fool of myself... Now it's your turn... I mean, to
  talk.'</p>

  <p>'All right.' She smiled. 'What shall I talk about?'</p>

  <p>'Yourself. I know so little about you. For all I know you're...' He tried
  to think of a way to finish the sentence. '... you're engaged to a Texas oil
  millionaire.'</p>

  <p>'No... But how did you know I was an editor?'</p>

  <p>'I asked at the hotel desk. I found out all I could about you.'</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't like you to get a wrong impression. It's a children's magazine
  and I'm really a teacher...'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He got back to his room about one o'clock, which was much
later than usual
  during the period of the Conference. But he felt refreshed and did not plan
  to hurry the ritual of the last drink alone and the half-hour of pottering
  over his diary and letters. As always after an evening out in good company he
  missed Jane. 'Now there's the kind of girl you ought to have married,' she
  had said, in joking self-disparagement on a very few occasions; but the
  peculiar thing was that she had had a rare knack of saying it about the right
  &mdash;or at least not the utterly wrong&mdash;women. There had been Clara
  Delagny at Santiago, and the German baroness at the Gismondi party at
  Villefranche... it had been fun, evaluating them with Jane, who knew so much
  and could make such good guesses even about what she didn't know... So he
  mused now upon what Jane might have said about Anne Raynor, and was still
  musing a moment later when the telephone rang. It was exceptional to be
  called at such an hour and he hoped Bingay didn't want him for anything; he
  didn't feel like discussing business. But the thought that he might have to
  made him brace himself for the professional and official manner, so that when
  he heard and recognized the voice he was less taken aback than he might have
  been.</p>

  <p>'M'sieur Anderson, a thousand apologies for disturbing you... It is I,
  Palan...'</p>

  <p>'Yes?'</p>

  <p>'I would like, if I may, to see you for a few minutes.'</p>

  <p>'You mean&mdash;NOW?'</p>

  <p>'If you please.'</p>

  <p>'But I&mdash;I'm just about to go to bed.'</p>

  <p>'I am here, in the lobby downstairs.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I'll come down if it's really important, but&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'No, no, I will come up. It will be easier that way. What is the number of
  your room?'</p>

  <p>'It really IS important?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. May I come up now?'</p>

  <p>There was a note in Palan's voice that intrigued Charles at least as much
  as it warned him; it sounded like a child's eagerness until one pictured
  Palan standing at the open desk within earshot of the hotel clerks, as he
  would be, presumably; and Charles found such lack of concealment far more
  puzzling than any amount of deviousness. That, he reflected, was the
  besetting neurosis of his profession; when a man did anything
  straightforwardly one was always suspicious. An obscure distaste for the
  neurosis made Charles answer: 'All right. Come up. Three-three-four.'</p>

  <p>A measure of excitement gained on him during the short interval of
  waiting. It was, he knew, the result of his evening with Anne; it had
  infected him with a curious sense of new adventure, of desire to step boldly
  where normally he would have been circumspect. He warned himself, but even
  the warning only added to the inward excitement. Presently he heard footsteps
  along the corridor. Assorted wisps of memory from a hundred spy and detective
  novels came to him as he went to the door. Bingay would certainly think he
  was doing a foolish thing. Suppose Palan were not alone? One heard fantastic
  stories of what those people were capable of... Anyhow, he opened the door,
  and Palan WAS alone, looking no more fearsome than he always would at that
  hour, for he was one of those men whose beards grow fast and dark.</p>

  <p>'Merci, mon ami. J'espère que vous n'êtes pas fatigué.'</p>

  <p>'Not too much, but I shall need some sleep soon... Come in&mdash;and
  please speak in English.'</p>

  <p>'Si vous voulez.' Palan walked across the room and pulled the blinds
  slightly aside at one of the windows overlooking the Place de la Concorde.
  Charles did not like this. 'What are you looking for?' he asked rather
  sharply.</p>

  <p>'To verify what I already guessed. One cannot go anywhere without someone
  watching.'</p>

  <p>'You mean YOU cannot. <i>I</i> can, I hope.'</p>

  <p>'Not always. You were watched tonight.' Palan laughed. '<i>I</i>watched
  you, my friend. I saw you take the American girl to dinner at Rousellin's
  &mdash;the American girl who was supposed to have returned to America. You
  were there for four hours. Then you brought her back here, where she is
  staying also. Am I not right?'</p>

  <p>Charles was on the point of becoming angry. 'Look... you said you had
  something important to say. The way I spend my evenings is of no importance
  &mdash;except to me.'</p>

  <p>'She is a very charming girl.' Palan slumped into an easy chair and
  stretched his legs. 'Do you remember, M'sieur Anderson, last night you
  invited me here for a drink, but I permitted myself to take a
  rain-check.'</p>

  <p>'A WHAT?'</p>

  <p>'I beg your pardon&mdash;an American word, meaning that one expects on a
  later occasion the pleasure one has previously declined.'</p>

  <p>'All right, but I have only whisky.'</p>

  <p>'Excellent.'</p>

  <p>As he was pouring it Charles could not repress the instincts of the host.
  'I hope you don't mind Irish. The flavour is perhaps an acquired taste.'</p>

  <p>Palan took it, sniffed, swallowed, and nodded. 'It has my full approval.'
  He swallowed again. 'I must explain that I did not follow you tonight with
  any sinister intent. I merely wished to see you as soon as possible without
  interfering with any other engagement you had.'</p>

  <p>'That's all right. Anybody can follow me who wants to.'</p>

  <p>'You are, I am sure, quite proud of that. It is like your English boast
  that your policemen do not carry guns, and that your speakers in Hyde Park
  are allowed to say what they like. It is all so very true&mdash;up to a
  point. But where IS that point?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, indeed, since it's getting on for two o'clock and we resume our
  official discussions at eleven.'</p>

  <p>'M'sieur Anderson, you have come to the point yourself with great
  accuracy. I do not think that I shall be resuming any official discussions.'
  Palan pulled out a case and chose a cigar, offering one to Charles.</p>

  <p>'No, thanks... What do you mean?'</p>

  <p>Palan lit his cigar with deliberate slowness, but Charles was now
  tolerant, for he could detect emotion behind the movement and knew that
  everyone is entitled to some such technique of delay and self-control.</p>

  <p>Palan said: 'You who have made so many small jokes about me at the
  Conference&mdash;and of course I know you have&mdash;must now learn that the
  biggest joke of all is not ABOUT me, but ON me. Simply this&mdash;that I have
  been recalled to my country.'</p>

  <p>Charles was silent, asking the question merely by the way he placed an
  ashtray at Palan's elbow.</p>

  <p>Palan continued: 'They are not satisfied with the way I have conducted its
  affairs at the Conference. They think I have not been strong enough.'</p>

  <p>'WHAT?' In his utter surprise Charles was aware of a pleased puzzlement
  that anybody should think his own side had had even any degree of success,
  and an equally puzzled and sudden sympathy with Palan which, as he diagnosed
  it, he knew to be absurd. He exclaimed: 'But that hardly makes sense! It's MY
  country that should complain, not YOURS! Why, dammit, you've had your own way
  nine times out of ten in everything so far!'</p>

  <p>'But you do not realize, M'sieur Anderson, that nine times is not enough
  for my country. It must be ALL the times. Anything less than that is failure.
  Of course you cannot understand that. You cannot understand the methods of
  the cold young men who are rising to the top. So I will tell you what will
  happen now that I have been recalled. They will send you one of them to take
  my place and he will not give way even that tenth time. He will be like my
  son.'</p>

  <p>'Then the Conference will fail.'</p>

  <p>'It has already failed. Though it may continue for some time after my
  successor arrives.'</p>

  <p>'But how about your chief in all this? Surely he must back you up&mdash;
  you're under his direction&mdash;he can hardly let a subordinate be blamed
  &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You think he cannot? Remember, M'sieur Anderson, that as a nation of
  innovators we are capables de tout.'</p>

  <p>'But what's the evidence against you? If you'll accept a left-handed
  compliment, I think you've handled your side of things deplorably well.'</p>

  <p>'It is charming of you to say so. Such a testimonial at my trial might be
  of great help.'</p>

  <p>'You're not serious?'</p>

  <p>'Or perhaps no, there may be no trial. I shall be liquidated without
  any.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, come now&mdash;It can't be so&mdash;so&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'So SERIOUS, eh? You are now seeing the joke?'</p>

  <p>'I must admit I&mdash;I mean, it's hard for me to&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Because naturally you are not afraid of being liquidated yourself?'</p>

  <p>'ME? Good God, no.'</p>

  <p>'Your people do not do that sort of thing, as I am so well aware.'</p>

  <p>'Even if we did, I don't think Sir Malcolm and I would be in much danger.
  Responsibility for the failure of the Conference is so obviously not
  ours.'</p>

  <p>Palan considered this for a moment, then said half whimsically: 'M'sieur
  Anderson, will you forget you are a diplomat for a moment and answer
  truthfully a very simple question?'</p>

  <p>'I can't promise, but you can ask.'</p>

  <p>'All right... Just this: If, by pressing a button, you could set off an
  earthquake to destroy my country, what would you do?'</p>

  <p>Charles smiled grimly. 'I wouldn't want to destroy your country, but if by
  pressing a button I could destroy your government I'd not only press it, I'd
  lean on it for an hour to make quite sure.'</p>

  <p>'So when you forget you are a diplomat you become a schoolboy?'</p>

  <p>'It was a schoolboy's question.'</p>

  <p>'Would you have answered it differently when you were one? Our Revolution
  took place when you were at school&mdash;how did you feel about it then?'</p>

  <p>'So far as I can remember, everybody was most enthusiastic. We all hoped
  your country was going to become more like our own.'</p>

  <p>'And of course you could not set for us a higher standard.'</p>

  <p>'I daresay. We were very na ve. We still are. We're a na ve country.'</p>

  <p>'It is your rightful boast. Nothing else could have saved you in 1940...
  But I wonder if our personal positions had been reversed&mdash;yours and
  mine, at that early age&mdash;I wonder if I should have been more like you,
  or you more like me?'</p>

  <p>'I doubt the latter. I can't imagine myself dynamiting trains.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, but I can. Very easily... Surely you will not admit that there is
  anything an Englishman cannot bring himself to do in an emergency? Why, you
  have even beheaded your king&mdash;a somewhat more barbarous regicide, would
  you not say, than the one you condemned us for recently? In our country yours
  has always had many admirers, including those who&mdash;returning the
  compliment, as it were&mdash;hoped that yours was going to become more like
  ours. Or does the idea of that shock you?'</p>

  <p>'If you mean going Communist it doesn't shock me at all. I personally
  would be against it, but if it had to happen we might do a better job than
  your people have. Of course it wouldn't be the same job and we shouldn't give
  it the same name. Your own melancholy example would guide us a lot in what to
  avoid, but besides that we have certain advantages&mdash;our Civil Service,
  for instance&mdash;reasonably efficient and free from corruption. Then too
  our traditions, which we should keep as intact as possible&mdash;and our
  constitution that so happily has no existence in any written document. After
  all, a thousand years' experience of making changes IS rather a help in
  disguising them&mdash;next to the Papacy I daresay we know more of the tricks
  of successful survival than any other institution in history.'</p>

  <p>'And all THIS... from STUFFY ANDERSON!'</p>

  <p>After the initial shock Charles was neither so startled nor so affronted
  as he would have expected. He merely replied: 'I suppose you overheard that
  somewhere.'</p>

  <p>'A few of your younger colleagues&mdash;speaking of you entirely without
  malice.'</p>

  <p>'I'm quite sure of that. Anyhow, it doesn't matter.'</p>

  <p>'Of course not. It was just their way of liquidating you.'</p>

  <p>'WHAT?... Oh, nonsense&mdash;why, I've had that nickname for God knows how
  many years.'</p>

  <p>'Then God must also know how long ago you began to be liquidated, my
  friend. But as you say, it does not matter. Successful survival is what
  counts&mdash;more than victory.'</p>

  <p>'Successful survival, in this world, IS victory.'</p>

  <p>'You are doubtless right&mdash;and that is another reason why the real
  joke is on me... May I?' He put his hand to the whisky bottle, adding: 'You
  said it is an acquired taste. I have already acquired it.'</p>

  <p>Charles smiled, but watched with some dismay while Palan poured himself a
  very generous amount. Palan then raised his glass with ceremony. 'A toast...
  will you permit one?'</p>

  <p>'If you like.'</p>

  <p>'A toast, then, M'sieur Anderson, to your country&mdash;where they
  liquidate you alive and imperceptibly&mdash;so that you can remain so useful
  as well as ornamental for such a long time.'</p>

  <p>'Palan, that's all very amusing, I'm sure, but I'm still in the dark about
  the real purpose of your visit at this time of night.' Charles then realized
  he had dropped the prefix to Palan's name&mdash;with him a rather significant
  stage of intimacy. What he really wanted to convey, as a fellow professional,
  was that he was sorry for Palan's personal predicament; but as a diplomat he
  was much more skilled in expressing regrets he did not feel than those he
  sincerely did. He compromised, therefore, on a remark that could have any
  meaning Palan chose to give it. He said quietly: 'It's very late&mdash;but
  don't let that discourage you.'</p>

  <p>Palan stirred restlessly, as if probed by one or other of the possible
  meanings, then put his hands to his temples in a sudden access of emotion.
  'M'sieur Anderson, have you ever&mdash;in your life&mdash;been AFRAID
  &mdash;of anything?'</p>

  <p>'Why, of course.'</p>

  <p>'When? Of what?'</p>

  <p>'During the war&mdash;in some of the air-raids. And other times too.'</p>

  <p>'Did you ever&mdash;do you ever&mdash;have dreams in which you are
  afraid&mdash;and when you wake up you are afraid even to remember them?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know about that, but I sometimes dream I'm at some important
  function without the right clothes. Embarrassing enough.'</p>

  <p>'Without the right clothes? And that is all?'</p>

  <p>'Sometimes without ANY clothes. I think the psychiatrists would call it a
  recurrent anxiety dream. Most people have one kind or another&mdash;actors, I
  understand, dream of forgetting their lines&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'And what kind do you suppose is mine?' Charles noticed that Palan's
  breathing had become heavy, as if he were under increasing stress&mdash;or
  else, perhaps, the half tumbler of whisky was beginning to take effect. 'I
  will tell you, my friend. I will tell you of the dream I have had lately,
  time and time again.' Palan leaned forward with hands clenching and
  unclenching. 'I have dreamed that I am back in my own country&mdash;in the
  city of Gorki where I was born&mdash;Nizhni-Novgorod it was in those days
  &mdash;but I am there again and it is today in my dream&mdash;No, it is not a
  dream, it is already a nightmare&mdash;I am there, and yet I cannot remember
  how I made the journey or what possessed me to do it&mdash;and I keep saying
  to myself in my nightmare&mdash;Why did you do it? Are you MAD? Why are you
  here? There is no chance now that you will ever leave again &mdash;why did
  you come back? Why?&mdash;Why?&mdash;WHY?' Globes of perspiration swelled out
  on Palan's forehead as he repeated the word.</p>

  <p>'But then you wake up and find yourself in Paris.'</p>

  <p>'For the time. But there is not much more time.'</p>

  <p>'When are you supposed to leave?'</p>

  <p>'My replacement is due to arrive by air tomorrow. I am expected to return
  by a plane that leaves tomorrow also.'</p>

  <p>'Expected to?'</p>

  <p>'You said "supposed to". I said "expected to". What we both mean is
  "ordered to"... After tomorrow, if I am still in Paris, I shall have burned
  my boats. Perhaps I have already begun to do that. There were men in the
  street just now... and after all, it would not be surprising... I have been
  careless at times&mdash;I have the old kind of brain, the European kind, the
  brain that slips its leash and scampers off for adventure and the fun of
  things... I have perhaps laughed too much... and you may have noticed,
  M'sieur Anderson, that in your excellent company I am still able to laugh. So
  if they have followed me here there can be little doubt in their minds.'</p>

  <p>'But there are still some doubts in mine.'</p>

  <p>'I know. It has been rather sudden&mdash;I mean, my decision what to do. I
  did not reach it, finally, till I walked past Rocher's by chance last night.
  By chance. Utterly by chance. My body was wandering with my mind &mdash;not
  far, but suddenly too far ever to return. I was under a considerable strain,
  you understand, and to see you there so comfortable, so gemütlich, eating
  your ice cream like a good bourgeois&mdash;to see you there so&mdash;so en
  famille... for I took the lady to be attached to you and not to your son till
  you explained. But perhaps I was right after all. If so, I congratulate you.
  Only in America could anyone so charming be still unmarried. It is a great
  country and they are a great people. Just think&mdash;they call this city
  Paris, France, in order to avoid any possible confusion with Paris, Texas,
  and Paris, Illinois.'</p>

  <p>Charles smiled. 'I think your mind's still wandering. Let's get back to
  the point. Where were we?'</p>

  <p>'In the Paris streets. You cannot imagine what my emotions were. I had
  walked for hours&mdash;and miles.'</p>

  <p>Charles said quietly, as to himself: '"It is not many miles to Mantua, no
  further than the end of this mad world".'</p>

  <p>'Pardon?'</p>

  <p>'A quotation... nothing... MY mind was doing it then... Go on.'</p>

  <p>'There is no more to say. I am just waiting... for courage... to destroy
  by a single act the work and faith of a lifetime.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps the faith, at least, is already destroyed.'</p>

  <p>'Yes... dissolved in fear.'</p>

  <p>'And disappointment. I don't think, Palan, fear alone would have brought
  you.'</p>

  <p>'You are kind to say that. It is why I have come to you instead of Sir
  Malcolm&mdash;a whim, I admit&mdash;just as the condemned man in one of your
  English prisons is allowed to choose what he wants for his last
  breakfast&mdash;how truly civilized that is!... Forgive me&mdash;I am
  overwrought, near the breaking point, and at such a time I cannot help
  seeming to take these matters lightly.'</p>

  <p>'I understand. I'm a little bit like that myself.'</p>

  <p>'I have noticed it, and it makes you simpatico&mdash;whereas I do not find
  Sir Malcolm simpatico.'</p>

  <p>Charles could not repress a sharp twinge of pleasure, for he too had never
  found Sir Malcolm simpatico. He said: 'Sir Malcolm's indisposed, anyway, so
  perhaps&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps it is even en règle then, as well as a whim, that I should put
  myself in your hands?'</p>

  <p>'In MY hands?'</p>

  <p>Palan bowed slightly. 'If you do not object, M'sieur.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, not at all, not at all.' Charles muttered the formula with which an
  Englishman sloughs off anything that causes him too little concern&mdash;or
  too much. As he did so he returned Palan's glance levelly and with a good
  deal of shrewdness. The situation was clearly of a kind he had read about
  lately, in newspapers and books and also in official reports; it had not
  happened to him before, but it had to a few others, though perhaps never so
  disconcertingly as to that Scottish nobleman when Rudolf Hess suddenly
  dropped into his back garden... Charles said, as casually as he could to
  cover the flurry of his thoughts: 'Very well, Palan... but of course you know
  I can't promise anything officially&mdash;I'll have to talk to Sir Malcolm
  tomorrow, and he'll no doubt refer the matter to London... Though naturally
  if there's anything on your mind I'm at your service for as long as you wish
  &mdash;all night if necessary.'</p>

  <p>'So now at last you are willing to lose your sleep?'</p>

  <p>'In a good cause&mdash;always. Do you mind if I jot down a few things as
  you talk?'</p>

  <p>'You evidently take it for granted that I have much to say.'</p>

  <p>'I would assume so, yes. You'd hardly expect us to accept your bona fides
  without some more&mdash;or perhaps I should say&mdash;some LESS tangible
  evidence than yourself in person.'</p>

  <p>'Not only simpatico but a smart cookie.'</p>

  <p>'WHAT?'</p>

  <p>'American for clever chap. You should learn American&mdash;might be useful
  some day.' And then, as if a breaking point had actually been reached,
  Palan's mouth became shapeless and speechless for a moment, while his eyes
  could only stare strickenly. Charles said, with sudden compassion: 'I've no
  authority to say this, but if I were you I wouldn't worry about catching that
  plane tomorrow.'</p>

  <p>'Or about NOT catching it?'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps that's what I really meant. Because surely there comes a time
  when counting the cost and paying the price aren't things to think about any
  more. All that matters is value&mdash;the ultimate value of what one
  does.'</p>

  <p>'That has been your philosophy?'</p>

  <p>'I've tried to make it so.'</p>

  <p>Palan mopped his forehead and Charles waited, feeling he had said all he
  could to convey those of his emotions that were both expressible and
  permissible. After a long pause Palan said: 'I beg your pardon. I am in
  control now.' He moved his hand again to the bottle. 'May I&mdash;once
  more?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly.' But Charles took it and began to fix the drink this time
  &mdash;a much less potent one. While he was so engaged he said quietly: 'So
  you were born at Nizhni-Novgorod.'</p>

  <p>'You know the city?'</p>

  <p>'I've never been there. It used to have a big fair every year, didn't
  it?'</p>

  <p>'Oh yes. The Nizhni-Novgorod fair was famous all over the world. In those
  days. But not any more. Nothing is the same any more.'</p>

  <p>'No, I suppose not.' Charles handed him the glass. 'Don't gulp it now.
  It's whisky, you know&mdash;not ice cream.'</p>

  <p>Perhaps because this was the feeblest of all the jokes that had passed
  between them, they both laughed immoderately, seeking to relieve the tension
  that had gripped them and was also drawing them together. Then Palan said:
  'Before I begin to talk seriously... one more toast&mdash;to OURSELVES
  &mdash;to the stuffy shirt and to the old hothead... The one not so hot, as
  they say in America, and the other&mdash;perhaps&mdash;not always so
  stuffy...' He raised his glass. 'I take it that the nickname is from the
  phrase "stuffy shirt", is it not?'</p>

  <p>'You mean STUFFED,' Charles corrected. 'No, nothing to do with it at all
  &mdash;at least, not in origin. But never mind... let's get to work.' He
  raised his own glass and muttered 'Cheers' or something that remotely sounded
  like it, then drew a notebook and pencil from a drawer of the desk.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Late one night a week later Charles wrote from his room at
the
  Crillon:</p>

  <p>My dear Anne,</p>

  <p>I daresay you'll have seen from your Times and Herald-Tribune that
  l'affaire Palan has become public. It's pretty big news in the English and
  European papers, and my name has been given some prominence&mdash;more, in
  fact, than a minor diplomat could expect or desire. I must say it seems odd
  that after a lifetime of doing my job with fair success and no publicity at
  all I should suddenly achieve headline fame (or is it notoriety?) because an
  allegedly reformed character calls me simpatico and gives me the kind of
  eulogy generally reserved for obituaries. Of course the situation, as well as
  being politically gratifying, has caused some private amusement among our own
  people, but I shall hope to live it down if only Palan will stop giving
  interviews. However, the whole thing is probably no more than a nine days'
  wonder, though it will give me something extra to put in my book&mdash;
  which, by the way (and doubtless as a result), Macmillans have tentatively
  agreed to publish. So I really must begin work on the thing soon.</p>

  <p>The new man they sent over to take Palan's place is just what he forecast
  &mdash;glum, grim, youngish, bald, and pink-cheeked, like a rather
  nightmarish baby. We have had our first clash already. Somehow, though, I
  don't think our people will waste much more time here&mdash;everything since
  the Palan defection has been really anticlimax. I shan't be sorry to get back
  to London again, especially now you are back in America. In a rather
  complicated way (which I shall perhaps have the chance of explaining to you
  some time) you yourself are at least partly responsible for the outcome of
  the Palan thing, though of course neither of us could have been even remotely
  aware of any such chain of cause and effect&mdash;any more than (I will also
  explain this to you some time) the monkey that bit the King of Greece in 1920
  could ever have supposed he was changing the history of the world. On
  consideration the parallel does not seem too flattering, but I will let it
  stand since (after so much that Palan has said about me) my reputation as a
  farceur is well established...</p>

  <p>And now to more personal matters...</p>

  <p>Several months later Charles wrote from his flat in Knightsbridge:</p>

  <p>My dear Anne,</p>

  <p>Thanks for your congratulations. Of course it's just a routine thing they
  give you more or less automatically when you've been a certain amount of time
  in the Service. I'm rather surprised the American papers made any mention of
  it&mdash;it was only in small print even over here. No, it doesn't carry a
  handle, thank goodness. Like my father, who was Sir Havelock for forty years,
  I'm snobbish enough to feel that a knighthood would put one on a level with
  many people one wouldn't care about&mdash;though of course if I were ever
  offered it (which isn't, I think, any longer a good bet) I should probably
  rejoice in secret. Anyhow, the C.M.G. leaves me very happily plain mister
  &mdash;it's really nothing but a small enamel cross hanging on a red and blue
  ribbon just below the white tie when one wears tails&mdash;and nowadays, even
  in London, there are few such occasions...</p>

  <p>... Gerald has just gone back to school after a fine Christmas we had
  together in the Lake District, doing some of the easier climbs&mdash;easier
  for him, that is, with his six-foot reach. He's very well and happy and has
  got to know a girl of about his own age to whom I can only apply the
  adjective 'strapping' in revenge for the one which, he reported, she bestowed
  on me&mdash;'spry'. Now how do you like that? Am I spry? Gerald met her
  halfway up a mountain, or halfway down, whichever way you look at it, but the
  way he looks at it is that fate engineered the whole thing. Perhaps it did.
  She's a nice girl, anyhow...</p>

  <p>... and Palan continues to enjoy the favour that so often in this world
  seems to be granted to the one rather than to the ninety-and-nine. I
  understand he's already negotiating with Korda for the motion picture rights
  of his life story...</p>

  <p>... and I have the interesting news, which I hope will please you, that I
  shall soon be crossing the ocean for a short spell in Washington&mdash;
  nothing uniquely important except to me personally, since there'll be a
  chance to see you. I shall arrive in New York about the tenth of next
  month...</p>

  <p>...and now, before I send this off, may I add how much I...</p>

  <p class="first">When he had sealed and addressed the envelope Charles
pottered about for a
  while, looking for that last little thing he would do before going to bed. He
  took out his notes for the book, but could think of nothing to add to them;
  then he pulled aside the curtains and looked down on the cars and buses
  cruising under the lights of a second post-war London in his lifetime. He
  felt that so many things had happened before, even though far differently,
  and the thing to do was perhaps just to sit by the window for a few minutes
  and remember how.</p>
