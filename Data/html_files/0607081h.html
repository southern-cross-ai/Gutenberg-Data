  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE PREDICTION</h2>

  <p class="first">"YOU can't always tell what a thing is by how it looks,"
  said Bryce.</p>

  <p>I nodded. We had been talking over cases we had handled, that morning in
  our suite of offices on the seventh floor of the Urania Building, indulging
  in reminiscence&mdash;as much as anything.</p>

  <p>Jim was my partner in "Glace and Bryce-Private Investigators," and had
  been an inspector of police before our partnership was formed. He was a
  big-boned, heavy-set chap with a round head and a stubby brown mustache above
  the long, black cigar he was smoking. And he was a most dependable man.</p>

  <p>He had come into my private room some half-hour before from his own on the
  other side of our suite, with a morning paper doubled up in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Mornin', Gordon," he said, sitting down. "Well, here's another social
  luminary turned into a comet, started chasin' his tail an' gone clean out of
  his orbit."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" I accepted his statement, which, though phrased in sidereal terms,
  was not at all enlightening to my mind. I had not read the paper carefully
  that morning, and, as a matter, of fact, Jim generally scanned the news more
  carefully than I.</p>

  <p>"Yep!" He nodded, and shifted his cigar from one side of his mouth to the
  other. "Here's this Johnny, Imer Lamb, actin' a dammed sight more like a ram
  from all accounts&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Imer Lamb, the amateur tennis expert, golfer, swimmer, and general
  all-around, athlete&mdash;the society Johnny who took up aviation recently?
  What's he done&mdash;crashed his plane?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Jim grinned. "Not exactly his plane," he said. "But he's crashed all
  right. He's crashed his way into jail, accordin' to the paper. Beat up his
  valet over here in Monk's Hall, that bachelor apartment on Park
  Drive&mdash;almost killed him from all accounts&mdash;an' is taken to the
  hoosegow. Now what would a man want to beat up his valet for?"</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "I can think of any number of reasons from mere
  incompetency to meddling with his private stock." Actually, though, I felt my
  interest quicken to some extent.</p>

  <p>Imer Lamb was a young man of exceedingly good looks and exceedingly
  plenteous means, who, since his father's death some years before, had cut a
  pretty wide swath in the social and sporting world. He had just missed the
  amateur tennis championship the previous year, and was equally good at golf.
  He had raced his speed car in Florida, and had recently taken to the air in
  the latest type of rich man's plaything-aeroplane that Hispano built. "Hasn't
  he a brother in the brokerage business?" I added.</p>

  <p>"Sure," Jim agreed. "For that matter, he's in it himself. But he lets
  George do the work. He works at playing so far as I know anything about it.
  But the firm name's 'Lamb Lamb.' Hot name for a firm of brokers. Accordin' to
  Hoyle, it oughta be Wolf Wolf."</p>

  <p>"This assault on the valet occurred in Monk's Hall. That's where Dorien
  lived, remember?" I said, smiling at his words.</p>

  <p>The remark led to a revamping not only of the case in which the man I had
  named had been a principal actor, but to others, each illustrative of the
  bent of the criminal mind, the battle of wits between those who sought to
  detect his identity, lay him by the heels, such as Jim and I, and the
  criminal himself. And that led to Jim's remark anent the fallacy of accepting
  the appearance of some incident at face value.</p>

  <p>"Quite right. Then there was the Marya Townsend affair." Marya
  Townsend&mdash;her picture swam before my mental vision as I spoke,
  dark-haired as some Oriental beauty with a hint of the Orient in her
  long-lashed, long-lidded, dark eyes; rich man's daughter, orphan who had been
  involved in a murder mystery that had cost an old man, her guardian, his
  life.</p>

  <p>Bryce and I had been to some extent instrumental in straightening out the
  circumstantial tangle in which she was caught, thereby saving the budding
  romance of her life from being blasted at the start.</p>

  <p>Jim chuckled as I spoke. "Well, yes," he said. "I ain't denyin', son, that
  you're right. That case was a swell collection of cross clues from beginnin'
  to end. But what's th' notion of draggin' Marya in again? That's about the
  third time you've mentioned Mrs. Harding, nee Townsend, this mornin'."</p>

  <p>I laughed. As a matter of fact, he was right. I had referred to the wife
  of Bob Harding once or twice in the course of our conversation. So I looked
  him full in the eye. "To tell the truth, I've been thinking of her all
  morning, Jim," I said. "I don't know why I should be. As far as I know, I
  haven't thought of Marya for months. But she's crept into my consciousness
  this morning, and, womanlike, she refuses to be put out. Ever experience
  anything of the sort?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes." He nodded, and grinned. "I reckon most everybody's done that at
  times. Only quite frequently, the parties what insinuated themselves into my
  mind wasn't such pleasant visitors as the little lady under discussion. Maybe
  she's payin' you the compliment of thinkin' of you, an' you're sort of
  feelin' it, son."</p>

  <p>"A sort of unconscious telepathy?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Somethin' of that sort." He nodded again. "She's thinkin' about you, say,
  an' you feel it without bein' able to interpret her thought-waves into any
  definite meanin', not bein' a Semi Dual, yourself."</p>

  <p>Instinctively, I glanced at the little black box of a private telephone
  line on the wall of my room. It led up thirteen stories to the roof of the
  Urania, where the man, whose name he had uttered, lived.</p>

  <p>Semi Dual! He was our friend. It was on his advice that Bryce and I had
  formed our partnership. Semi Dual, modern metaphysician, student of the
  higher life forces, those subtler unseen, often unsensed forces that regulate
  the very balance of the universe.</p>

  <p>No charlatan, even though astrology, that older sister of astronomy, known
  to the ancients, in itself a manifestation of the interplay, of planetary
  electromagnetic energy by which the sweep of the universe is charted;
  telepathy, the thing Bryce had named, the conscious or unconscious perception
  of the interplay of thought-waves generated in human brains; psychometry, the
  subjective, one might almost say spiritual, recognition of the well-nigh
  imperceptible vibratory emanations of an object, and their translation into
  definite meaning&mdash;were things he recognized as refractions of universal
  force through different media; and used.</p>

  <p>For Semi Dual held all force to be one. The sweep of the seasons, the fury
  of elemental storms, the calm beauty of a June day, or the life we mortals
  possess, were to him but one and the same thing, manifested each in its
  proper time and place.</p>

  <p>Semi Dual then, priest of justice, since to him justice, too, was no more
  than the working out of the law of cause and effect, a practical
  demonstration of the old, old declaration, that as a man soweth, so also
  shall he reap, measure for measure.</p>

  <p>Such was our friend's creed. Under it, each man's action became no more
  than a seed from which good or evil, joy or sorrow, might be raised,
  according as to whether good or evil were embodied in the deed. The act was
  the seed, and the result the fruit. It was the only justice in which he
  believed.</p>

  <p>High up in the tower above Bryce and me, as we sat that morning, he had
  taken up his abode in the midst of a garden of little walks between beds of
  blooming shrubs and flowers, ringed in by the vine-clad walls of the parapet
  of the roof.</p>

  <p>There was even a little fountain and a sun-dial, beside the central path
  that led from the top of a bronze-and-marble stairway, mounting from the
  twentieth floor of the building to the tower, white and classic in its
  outlines, in which he dwelt.</p>

  <p>In winter, the garden was roofed with sheltering plates of green-yellow
  glass. And at the head of the stairs let into the central pathway, was an
  annunciator plate of inlaid metal and glass, bearing a cryptic motto. Being
  trod upon it rang a chime of bells in the tower to herald a visitor's
  approach.</p>

  <p>More than Bryce and I, Semi Dual, student of the occult&mdash;occult
  because not generally understood&mdash;forces of life, had been instrumental
  in freeing Marya Townsend from the circumstantial web in which she had been
  caught, in preserving her young life's happiness.</p>

  <p>Literally he stood in the position of a god in the machine to me and
  Bryce. Having advised us to enter the field of private investigation, he had
  never withheld his help in any matter wherein he felt that his intervention
  was justified. Despite any hasty assumption which might evolve in the average
  mind from his manner of living, and the nature of his research, he was as
  practical as any man in his application of his knowledge, and far more
  consistent than most.</p>

  <p>With his insight into life, its purposes, its impulses, and emotions, he
  could scarcely be anything else. Yet he held material things of little
  moment, and unless some problem in which we asked his aid involved what he
  termed "spiritual values"&mdash;the integrity of life or reputation, or the
  avenging of their loss&mdash;it failed to enlist his interest.</p>

  <p>Tall, splendidly proportioned, with brown hair and carefully barbered
  Vandyke beard, deep gray eyes, an aquiline nose, and a head almost leonine in
  its suggestion, strong as a lion in defense of the right, of innocence, and
  virtue, sensitive as a woman in his every deeper feeling; such was the sudden
  attention. As I have said, it was the lower end of the private wire to the
  quarters of Semi Dual. And it never rang unless there was some very definite
  reason, some very urgent need.</p>

  <p>At that moment it rang!</p>

  <p>I went toward it, and removed the receiver from the hook. "Yes. Glace
  speaking," I answered its demand.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Gordon," Semi Dual's voice returned along the wire. "If
  Mrs. Robert Harding, who was Miss Marya Townsend, should come to you with a
  request affecting me in any way whatsoever, bring her, together with any one
  who may accompany her, to me."</p>

  <p>"Very well," I said, and hung up. I was not very much surprised. Amazing
  as the thing might appear from any ordinary viewpoint to the uninitiated, I
  had, even as Jim, who still sat behind me waiting, had pointed out, known
  Semi Dual to give more than one similar demonstration of the uncanny ability
  he possessed before.</p>

  <p>I simply turned around and told him what Dual had directed me to do, and
  watched his jaws tighten on the cigar between their teeth.</p>

  <p>"An' that does prove it, son," he rumbled in a tone of conviction. "She
  was thinkin' of him as well as us, I reckon, an' he knew how to get her
  wave-length. That's all there is to it, of course. I guess it proves that
  Marya's, in need of help of some sort."</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"Semi said she'd have somebody with her?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"He intimated as much," I said.</p>

  <p>"Huh," he grunted, and lapsed silent.</p>

  <p>I said nothing more. There seemed nothing more to be said under the
  conditions. Apparently Jim was right; Bob Harding's wife had been forcibly
  turning her thoughts in our direction, unconsciously projecting them from
  herself to us. And they had reached us. Only Semi Dual had been able to not
  only feel but read them, while I had no more than sensed their tiny fingers
  beating against my brain.</p>

  <p>Jim and I sat there until, after possibly half an hour, Nellie Newel, our
  chief clerk, rapped on the door of my room and came in, bringing with her a
  card.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Robert Harding is outside, Mr. Glace, with another young woman. She
  wants to see you, if possible," she announced.</p>

  <p>I reached for the card and took it, and handed it to Bryce.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Nellie," I said. "Show Mrs. Harding and her companion in at
  once."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE CRIME WIZARD</h2>

  <p class="first">MISS NEWELL withdrew, closing the door behind her. Jim and I
  looked into one another's eyes. Semi Dual had demonstrated the subtle,
  qualities that made it hard indeed to take him unawares. Something more than
  a half-hour ago he had indicated the belief that Marya Harding would call
  upon us with a companion. She was here&mdash;would appear before us inside a
  minute.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Jim, laying his cigar on an ashtray upon my desk in
  expectation of her entrance, "that's that. Now, what the devil&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door swung open. Marya Harding came through it smiling, together with
  a somewhat younger woman who did not smile.</p>

  <p>My major attention centered on the second woman. Marya was beautiful, as
  always, in that dark, Oriental fashion of hers; but this second girl was like
  a beam of sunshine half dimmed by an intervening cloud.</p>

  <p>She was slender and blond, with hair the color of strained honey, eyes of
  an almost pansy purple, and lips a trifle set now as though by the stress of
  inner emotion, but which one fancied could be tender on occasion, beneath a
  straight patrician little nose. Oh, yes, there was breeding in that face, the
  lines and angles that spoke of past generations of careful selection in
  blood. And not only in her face but in her bearing, as Marya made the
  introductions, were those past generations displayed. One felt it, knew that
  Moira Mason was a beautiful creation it had taken a long time to produce, the
  fruit of a family tree that had been long in growth.</p>

  <p>And of course I knew who she was. Heaven knew her name was often enough in
  the papers, her picture on the society page. Moira Mason was the daughter of
  Adrian Mason, one of our city's most aggressive and influential
  financiers.</p>

  <p>Bryce nodded his head in recognition.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mason," I said, and took the slim hand she extended briefly into my
  own, and found its fingers cold.</p>

  <p>We gave our visitors chairs. Marya sank into hers, still smiling.
  Marriage, I thought, had improved her. She had never seemed more charming to
  me before. But still I knew, even as she settled herself gracefully in her
  seat, that our interest was not with her-that it lay in Moira Mason, the
  clouded sunbeam of a woman whom until that moment I had thought of, if at
  all, as a human butterfly.</p>

  <p>And Marya's first words after she was seated confirmed my evaluation of
  the situation. She came directly to the reason for their call, though in a
  fashion that showed a slight embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"I hope you gentlemen won't think I'm forming a habit of running to you
  every time I'm in need of help, but will just feel that whenever there is a
  need you are the men I think of first. Really, though, it's Moira who needs
  the sort of assistance you can render.</p>

  <p>"And I told her I was positive you would give it. I made her come,
  promised her to explain, and see if we could enlist your aid. I told her all
  you and your wonderful friend Mr. Semi Dual had done for Bob and me in the
  past. I-I-thought-felt sure-from what I know of him-that if you would
  intercede for us-he might be willing to help her, if anything can be done.
  You see, she was engaged to Mr. Imer Lamb, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Imer Lamb!" Jim exploded.</p>

  <p>I couldn't blame him either. Imer Lamb was in jail for an assault upon his
  valet, if one could believe the newspaper account Jim had quoted to me this
  morning. Here was a beautiful girl, his fiancée, her features shadowed by
  trouble, appealing to us through a mutual friend, in Imer Lamb's behalf. I
  glanced at her, and back to Marya Harding.</p>

  <p>She was looking straight at Jim.</p>

  <p>"You know, then, about his arrest," she was saying. "That's bad enough, of
  course. But there is more to it than the papers print. It's-that I hoped to
  take up with Mr. Dual, if we could induce you to sponsor our request.
  His-attack on his valet is really only the culmination of something that has
  been going on for some time. If we could see your friend-explain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I interrupted. "We understand fully, Mrs. Harding, and there will be no
  difficulty in what you ask. You know Semi Dual, and you know something of the
  way in which he works. Because of that I am going to tell you now that your
  request was granted before ever you made it in words. Before you reached here
  this morning Dual called us on the telephone and instructed us to bring you
  and Miss Mason to him as soon as you arrived."</p>

  <p>Her eyes widened.</p>

  <p>"He called you-told you that?" she exclaimed softly and glanced at Moira
  Mason, who had lifted herself to a tensely erect position on her chair.</p>

  <p>"Just that," I told her. "Of course he did not mention Miss Mason's name,
  but he spoke of your bringing a companion."</p>

  <p>"But," she began, "we spoke of coming here to no one. How-"</p>

  <p>"Did he know?" I interrupted again. "You thought about it, talked it over
  between yourselves; and he caught your thought, Mrs. Harding, and read your
  intent. It is telepathy-a sort of mental radio, if you like. He does that
  sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"It's wonderful, almost unbelievable," she said. "Do you hear, Moira? He's
  going to see us; and he'll help Imer. I feel sure he will."</p>

  <p>"It is-wonderful indeed," Moira Mason spoke for the first time since she
  had been seated.</p>

  <p>"Then, can we go to him now?" Marya Harding prompted.</p>

  <p>"Of course," I agreed, and rose.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later I escorted both women from the elevator grille on the
  twentieth floor to the bronze and marble stairway that led to Semi Dual's
  domain on the roof.</p>

  <p>We mounted. It was a July day, and Semi's garden, slumbered under the
  light of late morning like a dream picture more than a scene of the modern
  world. There were beds of shrubbery and flowers flanking the central path,
  the nodding, drowsy heads roses, red and white and yellow. Their perfume was
  a warm spice in our nostrils.</p>

  <p>And before us was the tower, a thing of dark etched shadows, and
  whiteness. There was the tiny fountain with a gray and white dove on the rim
  of its basin, and the little ancient sundial marking the hour of our
  approach.</p>

  <p>Moira Mason cried out softly as we reached the top.</p>

  <p>At the sound of her soft-toned exclamation, I glanced at the girl.
  Surprised admiration was in her face.</p>

  <p>I trod on the annunciator plate. The chimes in the tower rang mellow as
  the distant note of an old-time shepherd's pipe. Other doves rose up from its
  facade and fluttered into startled flight.</p>

  <p>Marya Harding spoke with a little catch in, her words. "But, Mr. Glace,
  this is marvelous&mdash;like a picture come to life."</p>

  <p>"It is the place Dual has made to insure himself quiet, while he studies
  life," I said, and led the way up the central path to the door of the tower,
  etched a dark oblong in its nearer side.</p>

  <p>It stood open before us, and, as we entered, Henri, Dual's one companion
  in the seclusion he customarily maintained, bowed before us, a tray in his
  hands.</p>

  <p>On it were three glasses of a sparkling beverage I recognized as a blend
  of pure fruit juices, wonderfully refreshing, which I had tasted more than
  once.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, mesdames and monsieur," Henri greeted our arrival. "The master
  requests that you drink, and refresh yourselves."</p>

  <p>We stood in the anteroom to Semi's quarters, an apartment done in varying
  shades of brown. I myself handed their glasses to the two women, and noted
  their glance run about the room.</p>

  <p>"This is like The Arabian Nights," Marya. Harding laughed in a somewhat
  nervous fashion, and sipped at her glass. I smiled at her. It was all an old
  story to me. But I could quite appreciate its effect on those who came upon
  it without warning. It had impressed me in somewhat the same fashion the
  first time, and since. I drained my glass, took hers and Moira Mason's from
  their hands, replaced them on Henri's tray.</p>

  <p>He deposited the latter on a little table.</p>

  <p>"And now the master awaits the ladies' pleasure," he said. "You know the
  way, M. Glace."</p>

  <p>I nodded. There was a door on the farther side that gave into a room
  beyond. I crossed to it and rapped.</p>

  <p>"Enter."</p>

  <p>I set the door open and ushered my companions through it.</p>

  <p>Dual sat at a huge desk, clad, as was his custom when at home, in a
  flowing robe of white, edged with purple on cuff and collar. Beyond him a
  window, its expanse occupying nearly the whole width of the room, threw his
  splendid head into silhouette. Beyond him also; at one end of the desk, a
  life-sized bronze figure of Venus, really an electrolier, held an apple of
  golden glass in a gracefully outstretched hand. There was a great clock in a
  corner, a wonderful Persian rug upon the floor.</p>

  <p>I closed the door behind me.</p>

  <p>Semi Dual rose. Bending from the hips, he bowed. Before straightening he
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, Marya, the fingers of whose soul I have felt seeking contact
  with mine this morning," he said. "And thou"&mdash;he turned his glance to;
  Moira Mason, his gray eyes searching her face&mdash;"whom I perceive to be
  troubled in spirit, so that I deem that thy sister woman brings thee to me in
  thy, rather than her own, behalf, thou art welcome also."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Miss Mason said in little more than a whisper. One could see
  her visibly affected by Semi Dual's costume and manner as well as his speech
  and his instant appraisal of the situation as affecting her.</p>

  <p>Marya, however, was in a measure prepared for something of the sort from
  her contact with him in the past. She presented Moira by name, and we all
  found seats.</p>

  <p>"And now tell me," Semi prompted, once more with a smile upon his
  lips.</p>

  <p>It was Marya who complied, at first. Briefly she told him what she had
  already told Bryce and me. Semi Dual watched her closely.</p>

  <p>"Moira came to me this morning after she knew of his arrest," she said. "I
  thought that if you would listen to her story you might be able to tell her
  how it would all come out."</p>

  <p>"At least I shall listen," Dual spoke after a momentary silence that
  followed her words. "It is written, 'Seek and ye shall find, knock and it
  shall be opened unto you, ask and ye shall receive.' Wherefore I shall
  listen, and if it lie within my power I shall give."</p>

  <p>His gray eyes turned again to Moira Mason. "Tell me, my child."</p>

  <p>"There is so little to tell," she said, almost like a puzzled child
  indeed. "I really don't understand. It's like a nightmare. Imer is so
  different from what he was. It's as though some evil power had changed him
  lately&mdash;since we have been engaged. I've known him a long time, and a-a
  dearer boy never lived.</p>

  <p>"But in the last month he hasn't been himself; he's been irritable,
  irascible. And I'd never known him to lose control of himself before. We
  quarreled a few days ago. You know he's been flying of late. He's been doing
  stunt flying. It's very dangerous. I asked him to be careful, and he flew
  into a rage, became actually violent. I tried to calm him, tried to put my
  arms about his neck, and he tore them away and threw me from him, and rushed
  out of the house. See&mdash;" She extended an arm on which were the
  discolored marks of fingers.</p>

  <p>"And before that he'd always been gentle, for all his strength. He's a
  strong man, Mr. Dual. I'm sure he wouldn't have willingly hurt me. Yet he
  did. And yet the very next day he came back as though nothing had
  happened.</p>

  <p>"He didn't mention it. It was as though he didn't know, or had forgotten.
  And now&mdash;last night&mdash;he attacked his valet, beating him, choking
  him, apparently meaning to kill him. They say he would have killed him if a
  neighbor had not heard the noise of their fight and rushed in and helped his
  man overpower Imer until they could call the police. It&mdash;it almost seems
  as though he were going&mdash;crazy."</p>

  <p>She broke off with a caught-in breath and quivering lips.</p>

  <p>Dual stirred, opened his eyes, sat up. While she had been speaking he had
  been lying back in his chair relaxed. One might have fancied from his
  posture, his closed eyes, the slow rise and fall of his chest, that he slept.
  But I, who knew him, knew also that he did not; that back of his lowered lids
  his alert mind was doubly awake, was focusing, centering all its analytical
  ability on her words, apprehending her every slightest statement, appraising
  it, marking it for a future reference perhaps.</p>

  <p>"You love him?" he said now.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes."</p>

  <p>Faint color stole into Moira Mason's cheeks.</p>

  <p>"And how well do you love him?" Semi Dual demanded.</p>

  <p>"Why, I, hardly know how to answer," she faltered. "How does one put a
  value on&mdash;love?"</p>

  <p>Semi Dual nodded. "How indeed?" he returned. "But let me put it this way.
  Do you love him more than yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes." She did not hesitate.</p>

  <p>"Then," Semi said, "answer me such questions as I shall ask. You have
  known him a long time. Do you know of any past worries, any unpleasant
  episodes in his life?"</p>

  <p>"No-o." She shook her head. "He's always seemed more a happy, care-free
  boy to me than anything else."</p>

  <p>"He has not been prone to dissipation?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not any real dissipation," she said.</p>

  <p>"Does he drink? Have you ever seen him intoxicated?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;never. He takes an occasional drink, but not enough to muddle
  him ever. He smokes a good deal. No, Mr. Dual, he is not a dipsomaniac."</p>

  <p>Dual turned to me with a question. "Do you know anything of the young man
  in question, Gordon?"</p>

  <p>I told, him briefly what Jim had told: me that morning concerning Lamb's
  connection with the brokerage firm operated by his brother.</p>

  <p>"But George isn't really his brother," Moira amended my information when I
  had ceased. "He is no relation really, except by adoption. He is really the
  son of a friend of Imer's father. When the man died and left George an
  orphan, after asking Imer's father to take care of his child, Mr. Lamb
  adopted him."</p>

  <p>Semi Dual turned to his desk, took a sheet of paper from a neatly piled
  stack upon it, and picked up a pencil.</p>

  <p>"And what is Imer's age?" he asked. "Give me as nearly as possible the
  day, month, and hour of his birth, as well as the place."</p>

  <p>"He was born right here," Moira told him. "And he'll be twenty-seven on
  the 29th of this coming September. I know that, but I do not know the hour.
  Is it important?"</p>

  <p>"If he was born here we can possibly gain the information from the vital
  statistics of the Board of Health," Semi said. "And now the same information
  concerning yourself if you please."</p>

  <p>She complied. I saw her delicately chiseled nostrils flare. "You're going
  to work, aren't you?" she cried as Semi wrote down the data she furnished.
  "Marya told me something about how you do it. You're going to tell me if
  anything can be done for Imer&mdash;how everything is going to turn out?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps." Dual finished jotting down the' information he had asked for.
  "Do you know at what time he attacked his valet last night?"</p>

  <p>"It was somewhere around midnight," Miss Mason replied. "At least George
  says so. I saw him this morning. He was trying to get Imer released on bail,
  but so far without success."</p>

  <p>"The police blotter will show the time of the arrest at least," Dual said.
  "You saw your friend, Mr. Imer Lamb, this morning?"</p>

  <p>For a moment the girl's lips quivered again before she answered. "Oh, yes,
  I went to the jail, but he didn't seem to want to talk. He told me to stay
  away in the future."</p>

  <p>"You say he did not wish to talk?" Semi questioned. "Just how did he
  appear, Miss Mason?"</p>

  <p>"He seemed depressed&mdash;morose," Moira explained. "He asked me to have
  George bring him a pipe and some tobacco, and I said I would. And I called
  George after I left Imer. That was when he told me he was trying to arrange
  for his release on bail."</p>

  <p>"The valet was seriously injured?" Semi queried.</p>

  <p>"No." She shook her head. "Fortunately not. Mr. Lamb said he wasn't going
  to make any trouble for Imer, and that he had asked to stay on at Imer's
  apartment until he can arrange to get him out. But if Imer is really going
  insane&mdash;" Once more her voice broke.</p>

  <p>"Peace," said Semi Dual, reverting from the more modern beating and
  diction which had held him during the last few minutes to that he had
  employed at first. "Peace, thou troubled child! What shall be, time and time
  only will tell. Yet I have listened to you, and now I shall seek to do
  whatsoever I can.</p>

  <p>"And there are certain steps to be taken before I may learn what I shall
  learn. Therefore abide in peace, and strengthen thy heart with this thought,
  that all things pass, even as clouds from off the sun. That which today is a
  riddle, tomorrow we shall understand.</p>

  <p>"Wherefore today I shall seek to read the riddle you have placed before
  me. And tomorrow I shall strive to place at least a portion of the truth
  within your hands. Take that thought with thee in leaving me to the task
  which is now become mine."</p>

  <p>The interview was ended. He rose. Marya, and Moira Mason, and I regained
  our feet. Semi bowed to the women, touched their hands.</p>

  <p>"Peace," he said again to Moira. "It is the greatest boon, my child. Hence
  we use the word in parting from a friend. Peace with thee till tomorrow."
  Again he bowed.</p>

  <p>Once we were back in the garden passing toward the stairway from it to the
  busy twentieth century world, she spoke, addressing me directly: "Your friend
  is a strange man Mr. Glace&mdash;a strange man."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE PRISONER</h2>

  <p class="first">I COULD fancy how Semi Dual in his garden, his robes of
  white and purple, must have impressed her. I knew because since I had known
  him, time and again he had impressed me, myself. A strange man indeed.</p>

  <p>And never before or since I think did his course impress me as more
  strange than in the days that followed him first meeting with Moira Mason,
  days wherein the real meaning; the real purpose back of his move was deeply
  hidden from Jim and me as the strange, and to us unimagined condition, they
  were deliberately planned to oppose.</p>

  <p>After they left I went into my private room at our offices. I was puzzled.
  Viewed from an ordinary viewpoint, there was little in the affair that had
  brought Marya Harding and her girl friend to the interview just closed. On
  its face it was no more than the mental distress of a woman over a change in
  the personality of the man to whom she was engaged.</p>

  <p>From her side of the matter that was enough. But if Imer Lamb, rich man's
  son, sportsman, dilettante, had developed a latent strain of insanity within
  the past few weeks, I couldn't see where even Semi Dual would be able, to
  help.</p>

  <p>However, I was not left long to myself, Jim came thrusting his way in
  along a little corridor that ran from his room to mine across the back of our
  suite.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he demanded sinking into a chair, his brown eyes searching my
  face.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Jim," I confessed, and told him what had occurred.</p>

  <p>"Meanin' Lamb's goin' cuckoo?" he said frowning. "Then what in time does
  Semi hope to accomplish beyond transferrin' him from jail to the psychopathic
  ward?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally, I don't know that either. I don't believe Dual does as yet," I
  said. "Presumably, however, he may have an idea that a study of Lamb's
  horoscope will show indications as to whether his present condition is
  temporary or not."</p>

  <p>"Well, yes." Jim nodded still frowning. "An', of course, he made the girl
  give him at least part of the dope he needed to set up one of those
  astrological charts of his. But if this valet isn't goin' to press charges
  against his Employer I wonder what the hitch is in arranging bail."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it just possible that your suggestion about transferring Lamb to
  the psychopathic ward may apply to that?" I offered an explanation. "Possibly
  they suspect that they actually have a psychopathic case."</p>

  <p>"Huh!" Jim grunted in comprehension and pursed his upper lip, bristling
  his stubby brown mustache. "Well, I hadn't thought of that till now, but if
  one of the city docs has seen him, it might work out like that. An', of
  course, if they did, they'd hold him&mdash;till they was sure whether it was
  safe to turn him out or not. I've half a mind to drift down an' have a chin
  with Johnson, an' see what he says."</p>

  <p>Inspector Johnson had been Jim's pal when he was still, "on the force."
  And Bryce had formed the habit of dropping in at the station for a chat at
  such times as we were not pressed by work. So now it occurred to me that by
  following his suggestion he might at least obtain the police side of the
  matter provided Johnson was inclined to talk.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead!" I assented. "You can't do any harm and you may be able to find
  out just what sort of a disturbance of the peace Lamb really pulled. From
  what Miss Mason told upstairs this morning, it wasn't lamblike in the
  least."</p>

  <p>Jim grinned. "All right. I'll mosey down there," he said, then paused as,
  for the second time, the private telephone buzzed. "I'll wait till you answer
  that first."</p>

  <p>I was on my feet already as he spoke. For the second time I unhooked the
  receiver and spoke into the transmitter.</p>

  <p>"Yes, this is Glace."</p>

  <p>And then I stood and listened while the man on the roof voiced his
  directions very much as a general might speak to a lieutenant in the field,
  briefly, concisely, without any circumlocution or explanation as to why they
  were issued, beyond the tacit assumption that each encompassed an action
  required.</p>

  <p>"Very well," I assented to them at the end of possibly a minute, replaced
  the receiver, and turned back to Bryce.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, we're both going over to the station," I said. "And
  after that we're going to see this valet of Lamb's, and if possible that
  foster brother of his besides."</p>

  <p>"He told you to do that?" As he spoke Bryce jerked his head toward the
  ceiling.</p>

  <p>"All of it," I told him, and reached for my hat.</p>

  <p>"Just what did he tell you?" Jim demanded.</p>

  <p>"He told me," I said, "to go to the jail, Monk's Hall, and to see George
  Lamb, and learn anything we could. Come along."</p>

  <p>We left the office, descended to the street, and arrived at the Central
  Station in due time. Bryce smoked most of the way in silence. As a matter of
  fact, neither of us was really very clear in his mind as to just what we were
  going to do.</p>

  <p>Finally Jim put some of that uncertainty into words. "My original notion
  was just to run over here and see Johnson. But now what? Are we supposed to
  try and see Lamb?"</p>

  <p>And I considered that point for a few steps before I answered: "I've an
  idea, Jim, that the best thing is to follow out your original plan. We'll
  find Johnson, and sort of let the conversation that follows shape our
  actions. As a matter of fact, from all ordinary standards we've no particular
  call to feel any particular interest in Lamb."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh." He nodded as we mounted the steps of the station. "Just sort of
  stall along and watch for the breaks, eh? All right, son."</p>

  <p>"Johnson about?" He spoke to the sergeant on the desk as we entered.</p>

  <p>"Sure. In the 'tecs room. Mornin', Jim. How are you, Mr. Glace?" Sergeant
  Harrington returned.</p>

  <p>He was a man grown gray in the service; we had both known him a long
  time.</p>

  <p>"Fine, Dan," I said, and followed Bryce toward the door of the detectives'
  room on the far side of the front office.</p>

  <p>Bryce threw it open without the ceremony of a rap, and we both went
  in.</p>

  <p>Inspector Johnson, large, heavily built, with a rather florid face, always
  the rough and ready type of officer; glanced up from the desk where he was
  sitting.</p>

  <p>"Hello!" he said. "What is it&mdash;a general alarm?"</p>

  <p>Bryce grinned, and helped himself to a chair. I followed suit.</p>

  <p>"Nope," Jim made answer, sitting down, "it is just one way of wasting
  time, I guess."</p>

  <p>Johnson eyed him. Usually they indulged in a similar sort of repartee when
  together.</p>

  <p>"Wastin' mine, or yours?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Both," Jim countered, "unless you've got somethin' on hand requirin'
  help."</p>

  <p>That was a dig, since more than once Johnson, in his official capacity,
  had appealed to both Glace Bryce, and even Semi Dual, for aid, and had
  received what he asked.</p>

  <p>And seemingly he sensed more than a mere retort back of my partner's
  response. His eyelids tensed a trifle, he dropped his air of persiflage, and
  became incisively direct.</p>

  <p>"What's up, Jim?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Imer Lamb," Bryce answered him in two words.</p>

  <p>"Huh! That bird?" Johnson stared.</p>

  <p>"Yep!" I nodded. "I understand you caged him last night on a probable
  charge of assault with intent to kill. Just how many sorts of hell did he
  raise?"</p>

  <p>"He raised enough, from all accounts, while it lasted," Johnson said
  slowly. "Tried to choke the life out of his man, a chap by the name of Joe
  Kingsley, an' bash in his dome with the butt of an automatic, before another
  Johnny over in Monk's Hall heard the rough-house an' broke in an' dragged him
  off."</p>

  <p>"Had a gun, eh?" Jim said, verbally noting the point as Johnson
  paused.</p>

  <p>"Yep&mdash;regular army pattern," the inspector assented.</p>

  <p>"Moonshine?" Bryce suggested; and I knew he was merely seeking to learn
  what Johnson thought.</p>

  <p>But his denial was instant. "Nope! From what we know, Lamb's not a
  hoochhound, even if he is a high roller."</p>

  <p>"Bad blood between him an' Kingsley? Jim suggested.</p>

  <p>"Hardly, I think. The fellow isn't even goin' to press a charge. What do
  you want to know for?" Johnson demanded.</p>

  <p>"Just givin' you credit for havin' given the arrest of a man in Lamb's
  position some consideration," Bryce told him, grinning. "But&mdash;I guess
  it's not important. If Kingsley don't appear against him, you'll have to
  spring him."</p>

  <p>Johnson took his time before he answered. One might have thought he was
  trying to decide how far to accept Jim's reply at its face.</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that," he said at length. "Listen! You two come clean
  as to why you want the low-down on this bozo, an' I'll spill you something.
  Now kick in."</p>

  <p>"Looks like we'd have to, don't it, Gordon?" Bryce glanced at me with
  another grin. "First, though, I'd like to know when Lamb was arrested. If I
  knew that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The call came into the Park Drive Station at twelve twenty-five this
  morning;"' Johnson interrupted. "Now, what's if all about?"</p>

  <p>We told him, and he listened with a growing expression of puzzlement on
  his face. Apparently Moira Alason's visit to Dual surprised him in no small
  degree, and at the same time coincided with certain phases of the matter
  within his knowledge as shown by his comment when our account was
  finished:</p>

  <p>"Well, that all matches up. That's why I said I wasn't sure whether Lamb
  would be sprung or not. From all we could gather from his valet, Kingsley,
  the attack was totally unprovoked. According to him, Lamb had been sort of
  sullen all evening, had spent the evening at home, and just sat around and
  smoked.</p>

  <p>"He went to bed about eleven, and somewhere after midnight Kingsley, who
  was just retiring, says he came into his room with the gun in his hand and
  hopped at him without a word, outside a funny sort of noise in his throat.
  That led us to havin' Dr. Simpson see him this morning early, an' Simpson's
  of the opinion that Lamb may be going off his nut. So he was engaged to old
  Adrian Mason's daughter, was he?"</p>

  <p>Jim nodded. He was puffing out his stubby mustache. "An' it was Simpson's
  opinion that blocked his brother in gettin' him out this mornin'," he said.
  "You're holdin' him for observation?"</p>

  <p>"We're goin' to hold him," Johnson agreed. "After last night Simpson says
  he thinks he's got hold of a case of homicidal mania, or something of the
  sort. An' of course if he's right, springing that sort of a gil is something
  he wouldn't stand for."</p>

  <p>"Naturally not," I agreed.</p>

  <p>Dr. Simpson was one of the leading members of the city medical service,
  and a man whose opinion could hardly fail to bear considerable weight. It was
  easy enough, therefore, to see why Lamb would in all probability continue in
  durance whether his valet saw fit to appear against him for the assault of
  the previous night, or not.</p>

  <p>"I suppose at that rate you'll transfer him to the county observation
  ward?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"That's the way it looks now," Johnson replied. "But what I can't get is
  why Dual should have come into the thing, or why he should have shot you two
  down here to gather an earful as he has."</p>

  <p>"Actually," I said, "I don't know that he really is in it as yet. As we
  told you, Miss Mason saw him this morning, and he told her he'd see what he
  learned by tomorrow. That's all we know ourselves. But of course if he should
  feel that Lamb is developing a homicidal mania it goes almost without saying
  he would be the last man in the world to suggest that he be turned loose.
  What Miss Mason seemed to want to know as much as anything else was how the
  affair was coming out."</p>

  <p>"Find out where she stood?" Johnson said. "Well, that's natural enough.
  And from what I know of Dual, he ought to be able to tell her, if any one
  could. I've known him to call the turn on more than one thing before
  this."</p>

  <p>"What's Lamb doing now?" Jim asked.</p>

  <p>"He isn't doing anything," Johnson declared. "Just sitting in his cell,
  Simpson says. Says he lets on he don't know what it's all about. Want to see
  our playboy? If you do, I can take you back?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. Let's see how he's takin' it now." Jim rose.</p>

  <p>Johnson and I followed him up. Things were working out about to my liking
  just then. So far we had learned the approximate time of Lamb's arrest, and
  the name of the valet we had yet to see at Monk's Hall, and the fact that
  Lamb had used the butt of an army model automatic on the latter's head. About
  all that was needed now to complete the success of our call on Johnson was to
  see the man himself.</p>

  <p>"Still," Jim spoke again as we waited outside the jail grating, "I
  wouldn't call him a playboy, Johnson, I guess. If the war had gone on a
  little longer, a few years ago, Imer Lamb would have come home an American
  ace. As it was, he did quite a bit of flying over there before the show
  closed. Got shot down back of the German lines durin' an offensive, was
  knocked out an' left for dead, an' found after our boys carried their
  objective an' was mopin' up. Maybe he's been a playboy the last few years,
  but along in 1918 he was sure doin' a he-man's stuff."</p>

  <p>"The devil he was!" Johnson's tone showed a quickened interest. "Well, see
  here. If that's right, maybe that's how come he had an army gat in his rooms
  last night. You're sure of that dope, are you, Bryce?"</p>

  <p>"Dead sure. It was in the papers at the time, if you'd happened to read
  it," Jim reaffirmed.</p>

  <p>"An' you always was a hog for readin'," Johnson nodded as a turnkey opened
  the gate.</p>

  <p>We went back, along a corridor of cells, to one within which a younger man
  sat, elbows on his knees, head in hands, upon the edge of the cot.</p>

  <p>As we paused outside the cell door he lifted his face. He was handsome. I
  admitted it after a first glance, handsome in a masculine way, with a perfect
  cast of features neither effeminate nor weak.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Lamb!" Johnson accosted him. "Just what was your idea in tryin' to
  bean that man of yours last night?"</p>

  <p>Lamb stared. For a long moment he held Johnson's glance. And then he
  frowned. "If I knew, I'd tell you I think, whoever you are. But I'm damned if
  I know a thing about it, old man," he said.</p>

  <p>"Utterly lost your memory about that pettin' party you staged at your
  place, have you?" Johnson sneered.</p>

  <p>And suddenly the beauty of Imer Lamb's face was marred. For just a moment
  a something hard, to define looked out of his eyes. They looked like those of
  an animal about to spring, but the expression passed.</p>

  <p>"That won't get you anything, old chap," he said. "If I don't remember, I
  don't, do I? After you've answered that you can answer another question, too,
  if you like. Has that brother of mine been back here since early this
  morning? Asked him to get me some tobacco, and I'm dyin' for a smoke."</p>

  <p>"I ain't seen him if he has," Johnson told him, abandoning any attempt
  toward getting him to talk of his attack on Kingsley. "Meet Mr. Glace and Mr.
  Bryce."</p>

  <p>"Glad to meet you, gentlemen, whoever you are." Imer Lamb smiled faintly.
  "Always pleasant to make a new acquaintance. What is this, a tour of Who's
  Zoo, or what?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly," said Jim, reaching into a pocket. "Here, if you've
  got a yen for tobacco, have a smoke." He passed him one of his deadly-looking
  cigars through the cell door grating.</p>

  <p>"Thanks." Lamb took it, and Jim struck a match, holding it so that the man
  in the cell might obtain a light.</p>

  <p>Lamb bit off the tip with an eager motion of strong white teeth, and held
  the end to the flame, drawing deeply upon the weed, and exhaling a mouthful
  of smoke. Once, twice, three times he repeated the performance, and then he
  grimaced in a fashion of distaste, withdrew the cigar from his lips, and eyed
  it in evident disfavor.</p>

  <p>"Too bad," he said.</p>

  <p>Johnson grinned. I felt my own lips twitch. Bryce had a strong taste in
  tobacco.</p>

  <p>"Too bad," Lamb repeated. "You'll pardon me, sir, since I assume your
  actions were kindly in intent, but that's a filthy bit of weed. Really, I
  couldn't smoke it. I've always said our police were paid too little by
  far."</p>

  <p>Johnson snorted. Jim went red to the eyes. "Smoke it or throw it away,
  whichever suits you, brother," he growled. "It's good enough for me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but I meant no offense, you know," Lamb protested. "Tastes differ,
  you see. That's' life. My brother George and I smoke a blend made out of
  carefully aged and ripened leaves. George discovered it some months ago, got
  a chance to get it. It's not on the market. Private stock and all that. We've
  used it ever since."</p>

  <p>"Go right on an' use it, son," Bryce told him. Plainly the episode had got
  a bit under his skin. He turned, and strolled up the corridor toward the end
  of the tier of cells. I glanced at Johnson and we followed, leaving Lamb
  looking after, gripping the grating of the cell door with a strong and
  well-formed hand.</p>

  <p>Back outside I asked Johnson for the use of a telephone. It occurred to me
  that there was one bit of information now in our possession which Dual might
  find of use. I called him, using the private number unlisted but in my
  possession. And then Bryce and I made our way again to the street.</p>

  <p>Jim pulled a cigar from his pocket, and lighted it on the station
  steps.</p>

  <p>"Let that filthy thing alone," I began, unable to resist the impulse.</p>

  <p>And he chuckled. "I wasn't sure when I came down here," he said as he fell
  into step beside me. "But I am now. Takin' all things into consideration,
  Imer Lamb's insane, all right."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; MONK'S HALL</h2>

  <p class="first">I SUGGESTED lunch, and we stopped at a cafe before setting
  out for Monk's Hall, the fashionable bachelor apartment house on fashionable
  Park Drive.</p>

  <p>It was a many-storied building with an ornate foyer, an office, a desk,
  and a uniformed elevator attendant in charge of a many-mirrored cage inside a
  grille of ornamental type.</p>

  <p>Inquiry at the desk elicited the information that Kingsley was in Lamb's
  rooms. We had a request for an interview telephoned up.</p>

  <p>"He wants to know who it is, sir?" the desk attendant said after a
  moment.</p>

  <p>Bryce flung himself into the breach. "Tell him we are friends of Miss
  Mason," he said.</p>

  <p>Kingsley asked that we be sent up.</p>

  <p>"Suite 410," the youth at the switchboard told us, and we made our way to
  the waiting elevator cage.</p>

  <p>Two minutes later we were rapping on the door of the indicated suite.</p>

  <p>It was opened by Kingsley himself. At least I had little doubt that the
  man who opened to us was Kingsley, since to all appearances at least he might
  well have been the victim of an assault. There was a bandage about his
  throat, and another around his head. He was a medium-sized individual with
  thin hair, a face wearing an expression of pain, and a pair of china blue
  eyes, separated by a slightly twisted nose which looked as though it might
  have been broken and badly set in the past.</p>

  <p>"Come bin, gentlemen," he invited, and I noted that as he closed the door
  behind us and followed us into a handsomely appointed living room off the
  tiny-entrance ball, he walked with a limp amounting to almost an actual
  halt&mdash;a dragging of one leg, some injury of the past it struck me,
  rather than any recent hurt.</p>

  <p>"Be seated, gentlemen." He gave us chairs. He was cockney English beyond a
  doubt. "Hif you're friends hof Miss Mason you're welcome. Hi presume Miss
  Mason his ha bit hupset hover wat 'appened lawst night. Rum go the marster,
  tryin' to do me in, w'at?"</p>

  <p>"So that's the way you feel about it, is it?" Bryce said as Kingsley took
  our hats. "Well, you're right about Miss Mason. She's upset all right. They
  tell me you're going to pass it over, Kingsley, not going to press the charge
  against Lamb."</p>

  <p>"Ho, but, sir, Hi couldn't do that."</p>

  <p>Kingsley's tone was one almost of shocked surprise. "The marster, bless
  'im, didn't know w'at he was doin', hof course. 'E's a toff, sir&mdash;a toff
  hif ever there was. Treated me swell 'e has for years. Saved my life 'e did
  in eighteen, time Hi got my leg. You may 'ave noticed hit, sirs. Guv me my
  blighty, ho yus.</p>

  <p>"But by then Hi didn't 'ave no 'ome to go to, hand Mr. Himer 'e says,
  'Well, Joe, hi'll take care hof you,' 'e says. Hand 'e's done hit, sirs. Hi'm
  not good for much. But hi howe 'im ha lot. Too much to make 'im hany trouble
  hover lawst night. Ho, yus, much too much. Miss Mason didn't arsk you to
  call, account hof that, did she, sirs?"</p>

  <p>"No, she didn't. Lamb's brother George had already told her you didn't
  mean to make trouble," I informed him. As a matter of fact, I was a good deal
  taken with Kingsley. Gratitude of his type is unusual enough to be
  noteworthy. And, of course, what he had told us about Lamb's having saved his
  life during the war was something of a surprise. Lamb seemed to have been a
  good deal of a man a few years ago, even as Bryce had told Johnson at the
  jail.</p>

  <p>Kingsley nodded slightly as I paused. "Hi didn't think she would," he
  declared. "Ha fine little lady&mdash;a bit of arl right, sir, hif Hi may so
  hexpress myself."</p>

  <p>The fellow was frankness itself.</p>

  <p>"See here, Kingsley," I said. "Let's get things straight. Really, we're no
  more friends of Miss Mason than we are of Lamb's. We merely told the desk
  that in order to insure our getting up. This&mdash;" I glanced at
  Jim&mdash;"is Mr. James Bryce, and I am Mr. Gordon Glace. Miss Mason came to
  us through a mutual friend this morning in Mr. Lamb's behalf. Our errand
  really is to learn from you as nearly as you can tell it exactly what
  happened last night as well as to discover whether or not you have noticed
  any change in Mr. Lamb the past few weeks."</p>

  <p>Kingsley's wits were decidedly quicker than his halting gait. "Gor blyme!"
  he exclaimed, turning his glance from me to Bryce. "Gor blyme, sirs; you're
  by way of bein' detectives then, I fawncy&mdash;somethin' of the sort."</p>

  <p>"Private detectives, Kingsley," I told him. "We're not of the police. But
  you see, the police doctor thinks Mr. Lamb may be not quite
  himself&mdash;mentally that is."</p>

  <p>"Balmy!" he interrupted. "You mean, sir, they think 'e's balmy? My word!
  Not but w'at 'is 'oppin' at me lawst night might seem a bit crazy, like for
  the time 'e was hoff 'is 'ead. Hi'm thinkin' hit was a nightmare myself,
  something hof the sort."</p>

  <p>"Just a minute, Kingsley," I interrupted his protests. "Didn't you tell
  the police that Lamb had been acting sullen all evening, mooning about and
  smoking a lot?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, sir," he answered slowly. "Hi did say that. The marster did
  happear to be a bit 'opped lawst night. But bless you, a guy gets that way
  sometimes. Hand the marster halways smokes ha goodish bit."</p>

  <p>Jim nodded. "An' I guess that's right," he agreed. "He was beefin' over
  wantin' his own brand of tobacco at the jail this mornin."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir." Kingsley smiled faintly. "'E Smokes a very special brand 'e
  does&mdash;both 'e hand Mr. George, 'is brother, sir. Now hand then I scrags
  a pipeful myself. But the marster don't mind. 'E's a toff like I said."</p>

  <p>"Forgetting that for a moment," I switched the subject, "and forgetting
  last night also, have you noticed any change in your master the last
  month?"</p>

  <p>Kingsley eyed me almost as though for a personal hurt. "There you go
  again, sir," he said. "Hand hif the bobbies think him balmy. Hi don't like to
  say a word. But 'e 'as changed a bit from w'at he was. Hothers besides me
  must 'ave noticed hit, sir, from the way you talk. 'E 'asn't been as
  cheerful, hif you know w'at I mean&mdash;like, as hif 'e 'ad somethink hon
  'is mind, hand a bit quick to get 'is wind up, a bit 'ard to please."</p>

  <p>"Did you know that he had quarreled with Miss Mason?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Quarreled with 'er?" he repeated in surprise. "No, sir. 'E halways spoke
  of 'er hin the most affectionate fashion. Fair gorn on 'er 'e was. You're
  sure there 'ad been words between them?"</p>

  <p>I nodded. "She told us so herself."</p>

  <p>Kingsley frowned, and then he brightened. "But she's for 'im. She must be
  for 'im, hif she come to you to 'elp 'im. Het couldn't 'ave been serious," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mason understands, that is, she fears that for some time Mr. Lamb
  has not been quite himself."</p>

  <p>"Gor bless me!" Kingsley seemed very much disturbed. That the man had been
  and was fond of his employer, the man who had saved his life, had taken him
  in and given him employment, when he was no more than a bit of human flotsam
  of war, one could no longer doubt. He worked for Lamb, but aside from any
  question of mere employment, one sensed that his service was sincerely a
  service of loyalty.</p>

  <p>"There hisn't hany reason for hit. Hunless&mdash;my word, sir, do you
  fawncy hit could 'ave come from the time a Fritz bashed him in the conk, that
  time 'e crashed his plane be'ind their lines?"</p>

  <p>"As to that, I don't know," I said with a glanced at Jim. "Almost anything
  can happen from that sort of thing, I believe, according to medical men.
  Suppose you tell us exactly what happened last night as well as you can
  remember."</p>

  <p>"Hi can remember hall right," he declared. "Right hafter twelve hit was.
  Hi was gettin' ready to turn hin. Hi 'ears a noise like my door bein'
  hopened, hand Hi turns around, hand hit was the marster, with a funny look
  hon 'is mush hand ha gun hin 'is 'and.</p>

  <p>"'Hello!' hi says, not realizin' Wat was hup, hand thinkin' maybe 'e
  wanted to speak with me. But 'e doesn't say a word. 'E comes hat me scowlin'
  somethin' fierce, hand makin' ha funny noise hin 'is throat. Like a growl hit
  was. Hand 'e grabs me, hand bashes me one hon the crumpet with the butt of
  the gun. Fair staggered Hi was with the blow hand surprise.</p>

  <p>"But Hi grabs 'is gun wrist, hand we fought hall hover the room. 'E's
  strong-a fine athlete han' swimmer as you may 'ave noticed&mdash;broad in the
  shoulders, with 'ips has lean has a 'ound's. But hi 'eld hon to 'im, callin'
  lim by name. Hi says. 'Mr. Himer, for heaven's sake w'at's the matter?' But
  'e doesn't 'eed me, hand Hi thinks my time 'as come till a Mr. Blackmore hin
  the hapartment next door 'ears the racket, hand comes hand busts the glass
  hin the front door, hand let's 'imself hin.</p>

  <p>"You may 'ave seen, sir, that there hare several little panes. 'E busts
  one, hand hunlocks the door hand runs hin, pulls Mr. Himer orf me, hand
  between us we tie 'im hup, hand call the police. They takes 'im away, hand I
  goes arfter a doctor, 'as my 'ead tied hup, hand comes back again.</p>

  <p>"Then this mornin' Mr. George comes to see me, hand says ham Hi goin' to
  make trouble for Mr. Himer, hand Hi tells 'im my word no&mdash;I can't do
  nuthink like that, me howin' Mr. Himer my life, hand honly bein' worried
  habout 'is seemingly goin' orf 'is mind.</p>

  <p>"So Mr. George says 'e's glad I feel like that hand for me to stick hit
  'ere till 'e sees 'ow heverythink his comin' hout. Hi tells 'im Hi will, hand
  'e goes orf, hand Hi laven't 'eard a bloomin' word from hany one till you
  come. Hi can't hunderstand hit, hi cawn't."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, Kingsley," I said, "Nobody quite understands it at
  this time. It's rather odd for him to suddenly change and attack you after
  you've been friends for years. But I believe that is one symptom of such
  things. You say Lamb paid no attention when you called him by name, and said
  nothing before he attacked you?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, 'e didn't," Kingsley returned.</p>

  <p>"Hit's my opinion that 'e didn't know me. The way hit himpressed me, 'e
  mought 'ave thought me hanother man. Hand hafter Mr. Blackmore hand me 'ad
  tied 'im hup hand was waitin' for the police, 'e simply sat starin' hand
  tryin' now hand then to pull 'imself loose. 'E wasn't 'imself, sir. Hi'll
  take my oath to that."</p>

  <p>"You've got the gun?" Bryce questioned as the valet paused, and sat
  regarding us with a troubled frown.</p>

  <p>"No, sir." He shook his head. "The police took hit with them w'en they
  took Mr. Himer. But hit was one Mr. Himer 'ad during the war. Ha sort of
  relic hit was."</p>

  <p>I looked at Jim, and he nodded and rose. There was nothing to be learned
  here in the opinion of us both. Nothing that save what was indicated to
  support the belief of Dr. Simpson that Imer Lamb was mentally unsound.
  Seemingly he had made a murderous and unprovoked attack on a man whose life
  he had saved, a man he had befriended for years.</p>

  <p>Outside of the assumption that there was some change in the man himself,
  the thing did not balance up. Of Kingsley's attitude toward Lamb there could
  be no doubt. One could see that in the inner, recesses of Kingsley's soul,
  Imer Lamb was pretty much his god.</p>

  <p>"W'at are they goin' to do with 'im, sirs?" he questioned as he brought
  our hats. "Are they goin' to turn 'im hout?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly, I'm afraid," I told him. "Not now at least. It's far more likely
  that they'll put him in the county hospital for observation, Kingsley, until
  they at least decide whether he will be safe to release or not."</p>

  <p>"The 'Orspital," he repeated. "Then Hi'll be packin' 'is bags. 'E'll need
  clean linen, 'e will, hand hevery think else. Most like Hi'll 'ear from Mr.
  George."</p>

  <p>"Probably," I agreed. "That's not a bad thought, about packing his bags.
  He'll need fresh clothing, of course."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir," he accepted my approval of his suggestion.
  "Hi'll hattend to hit at once. Good arfternoon, sirs." He opened the door for
  us to pass.</p>

  <p>We descended to the street. It was half past two o'clock.</p>

  <p>And now Bryce suggested, "I suppose the next thing we do is see George. I
  don't know what good it can do. But orders is orders, as the soldier boys
  remark. Still, if Imer Lamb ain't crazy he's givin' a darned fine imitation
  of a man who is. Seems too bad.</p>

  <p>"If that lad up there is telling the truth, and for one I don't doubt it,
  Lamb's been a real guy in the past. That checks up with what Miss Mason says,
  too&mdash;gentle an' strong was about the way she summed Imer up. Funny how a
  chap with about everything a man could want, from plenty of jack to a swell
  little dame ready to hop over the stick with him any time they was mutually
  ready, should have blown up. Funny thing, the human brain."</p>

  <p>I nodded. His words brought back to my mind the impression Moira Mason had
  made upon me that morning of a sunbeam dimmed by a cloud, and called up the
  cloud of trouble that had lurked in the limpid depths of her blue eyes, of
  the set tension of repression that had ridden upon her flower-like mouth.</p>

  <p>Moira Mason and Kingsley both were suffering. Both were troubled in their
  brains because of the wreck which had occurred in the brain of the man each
  in his or her own way loved. It was a strange thing, the brain&mdash;that
  laboratory in which were generated the impulses that drove us to sane or
  insane deeds.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Jim," I said. "And apparently Lamb's has gone wrong. As to what good
  we're doing I can't say. At least though we got Dual the hour of the man's
  arrest. With that to go on he can erect a preliminary, what he calls a horary
  figure of what took place, and govern his future actions from what he reads.
  We've known him to do that before, and I think that's what he intends doing
  in the present instance, and I suspect he is only doing it because Miss Mason
  asked for what information he could give."</p>

  <p>"Tough," said Jim. "Tough on the girl, and tough on Lamb himself. If
  anybody I was fond of was to get batty in the belfry I'd rather they was
  dead, I guess."</p>

  <p>"They'd be better dead," I declared. "Lamb's life can't hold much for him
  from now on, if he really is. Incarceration in some institution for the
  criminally insane is about what he has to expect."</p>

  <p>"Yep!" my partner agreed. "An' if that ain't just about a livin' death, I
  don't know what is."</p>

  <p>We walked to a corner and caught a trolley car bound for the business
  section; left it in the financial district, where banks, trust companies and
  brokerage firms crowded stone and brick and terra cotta shoulders, and looked
  for the Lamb address.</p>

  <p>Presently we found it. "Lamb Lamb" the firm name glinted back at us from
  heavy plate-glass windows, in letters of burnished gilt.</p>

  <p>"Here we are." Bryce laid his hand to the door, and we passed from the
  glare of the street into a semi shadowed interior of a tile and marble foyer,
  to proffer our request for an interview. In doing so we took a leaf from our
  experience at Monk's Hall, and declared ourselves friends of Miss Mason.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lamb is engaged at present," the girl at the information desk said.
  "Shall I send in your names?"</p>

  <p>"If you please," I decided. "We'll wait."</p>

  <p>We turned away to where a leather-upholstered divan ringed the base of a
  massive pillar, and sat down. The offices of Lamb Lamb were rather sumptuous,
  all marble, mahogany, and brass. At the end of the foyer in which we sat was
  a bank of private rooms. I fixed my eyes on that bearing the designation:
  "Mr. George Lamb."</p>

  <p>Presently that door opened, and a woman emerged&mdash;a woman handsomely
  groomed, a beautiful woman, in a darkly sophisticated way.</p>

  <p>"Good-by," she spoke over her shoulder in a well-modulated voice.</p>

  <p>Then she was coming toward us with a graceful step, a faint smile on her
  carmined lips. She was wholly self-possessed, thoroughly poised, if one might
  judge by her bearing. She passed us closely, and I saw Jim's glance follow
  her slender retreating back. Then his voice was in my ears:</p>

  <p>"Know who that was?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head, turning my eyes from the woman just vanishing into the
  street.</p>

  <p>"Nathalie Norton," he told me, mentioning a name I recognized as that of a
  girl who had won considerable popularity on the screen some seasons before,
  but of whom I had heard little of late. "You know George is interested in the
  Acme Film Distributing Corporation. Maybe Nathalie's makin' a play to get
  back in the pictures. Well, she wasn't so bad. I used to sort of like to see
  her stuff myself."</p>

  <p>I nodded. Jim had a rather heterogeneous collection of information
  concerning all sorts of people in his head. Right now, however, I was more
  interested in watching the girl at the information desk.</p>

  <p>As Bryce paused, she signed to us that we might seek Lamb in his room. I
  nodded again to indicate that I understood, and got up.</p>

  <p>"Come along, Jim," I said.</p>

  <p>He followed me back to the door of the room Nathalie Norton had just left.
  I rapped upon it.</p>

  <p>"Come in," called a somewhat irascible voice.</p>

  <p>I pushed the door open, and we went in.</p>

  <p>George Lamb sat at a desk. He was as different from his brother as day
  from night. Where Imer was darkly handsome, George was blond and heavy-set,
  with grayish blue eyes that swept Bryce and me in a fashion one instantly
  felt was antagonistic, even before he spoke:</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen? Mr. Glace and Mr. Bryce, isn't it? Friends of Miss
  Mason, I think you said? Hasn't that girl sense enough not to send you down
  here at such a time?"</p>

  <p>"If by 'at such a time' you refer to your foster brother's condition and
  his present incarceration, do you find it strange that the woman who has been
  engaged to him for some time should take an interest in the matter, Mr.
  Lamb?" I returned.</p>

  <p>For a moment he stared, and then he half rose from his chair, and again
  subsided within it.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "we won't argue about it. You're here now; so sit down,
  and be brief. Just what is it that you and Moira Mason want? Or, wait! Before
  you answer that, suppose you tell me who you two really are?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE BUSINESSMAN</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was an inauspicious opening to our interview. Two things
  were evident from the first. George Lamb was nervously on edge, and he
  appeared very apprehensive about the purpose of our visit. The first was not
  surprising, considering the fact that Imer was in jail with a strong
  probability of being adjudged mentally unbalanced.</p>

  <p>But the second was not so ready to explain, in view of the fact that in so
  far as he knew we came to him from the woman his foster brother had expected
  to make his wife, a girl to whom I had been very strongly attracted as one of
  a splendid personality.</p>

  <p>Because of that I sought to draw him out still further before I gave him
  any information affecting Jim's and my interest in Imer Lamb's affairs.</p>

  <p>"Whether we are friends of Miss Mason or not. Mr. Lamb," I rejoined, "I
  feel that I may assume that you do not entertain a similar feeling for the
  lady yourself."</p>

  <p>"I do not." He literally bit off the words. "Never have&mdash;never expect
  to."</p>

  <p>"Then you did not approve of your brother's engagement, of course?" I
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely not!" he declared, still with unmistakable emphasis.</p>

  <p>"May one ask why?" I questioned, further keeping my eyes on his face.</p>

  <p>It darkened. The man scowled.</p>

  <p>"It's none of your damned business, you know," he snarled. "Now, instead
  of sitting there asking questions, you answer a few or get out. Who are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Glace and Bryce," I told him. "I'm Glace. My companion is Mr. James
  Bryce, my partner. We are private investigators, Mr. Lamb. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Private investigators!" He nearly shouted. "Private investigators of
  what?"</p>

  <p>"Of anything that needs investigating, Mr. Lamb," I resumed. "But, as I
  remarked before, if you will let me finish my explanation, I hope we can get
  together rather than pulling at cross-purposes."</p>

  <p>"Get together? How do you mean, get together?" he demanded, staring at me
  across his desk. "D'ye mean that fool girl asked you to investigate my
  brother's&mdash;what happened at Monk's Hall last night?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly," I tried to continue my explanation. "As a matter of fact,
  our position in business has nothing at all to do with this. You
  misunderstand us, I'm afraid. Miss Mason came to see us this morning with
  Mrs. Robert Harding, who has known us for years. Naturally Mr. Imer Lamb's
  arrest had left her very much perturbed. I say naturally because it is
  natural, Mr. Lamb. You're a bit on-edge yourself."</p>

  <p>He breathed deeply. I saw his chest rise and fall. And then he visibly
  relaxed. He nodded.</p>

  <p>"You're right there, Mr. Glace, I am," he said in more quiet fashion. "But
  if you're not here as investigators of something that I can't see needs
  either investigation or any more publicity than can be avoided, why in hell
  are you here?"</p>

  <p>And right there I decided it was time to make things as clear as I could,
  to tell him the literal truth, no matter whether once I had done it the man
  would understand or not.</p>

  <p>Dual had placed no embargo on my talking, had given me no instructions
  save to visit the jail and Monk's Hall and Lamb. Having made my way into the
  presence of the latter, I did not believe that he would possibly be anything
  more than surprised at my narrative, but in what I had to tell I judged might
  lie a means of catching his at least temporary interest.</p>

  <p>"If you'd give me a chance to explain," I said, and smiled.</p>

  <p>"I've been trying to get you to do it," he rejoined shortly. "Go on."</p>

  <p>I complied. At last I had the chance. I recounted briefly Moira Mason's
  visit to us that morning, and her subsequent interview with Semi Dual, and
  his promise to tell her on the morrow what he thought. And at last Lamb heard
  me without interruption&mdash;though, as I proceeded, his expression altered,
  became that of one faintly amused, and at the end he laughed in a fashion
  little short of a sneer.</p>

  <p>"And that girl does that&mdash;comes to you and gets you to take her to
  this star-gazing fortune teller of yours? You want me to believe that? Rot,
  Glace, bunk! It's too large a wad to swallow, though I'm not denying it's the
  sort of hokum that might appeal to her.</p>

  <p>"She's a butterfly&mdash;just a butterfly. And the devil of it is that the
  last few years Imer's been butterflying himself. I've wanted him to settle
  down and apply himself to our business, but he's been satisfied to 'let
  George do it.' And that's no joke. To me at least it's been an unsatisfactory
  truth. Well, that's that.</p>

  <p>"For the rest of it, how does your story justify your forcing your way in
  on me? Does your principal imagine you may collect enough dope from the visit
  to enable him to stall along with her?"</p>

  <p>"He ain't stallin', brother," Bryce said gruffly, Lamb's decidedly
  offensive manner having apparently moved him to speech.</p>

  <p>"No?" The broker stared. "You aren't trying to sell me the idea that you
  think he's genuine, are you? Listen. I cut my wisdom teeth early, and I've
  got all four of 'em yet."</p>

  <p>"I ain't tryin' to sell you nuthin'," Jim told him, beginning to grow a
  bit red in the face. "I don't suppose any one could sell you so much as a
  thought that there may be things you never heard of in your life. That aside,
  I've heard of cases where a man's teeth affected not only his hearing, but
  his sight.</p>

  <p>"Personally, Glace and I have known Semi Dual for years, an' watched his
  work. I didn't believe it any more than you do at first, but I'm sold now,
  and I'm a fairly stubborn guy myself.</p>

  <p>"I used to be a bull before I went in with Glace. But since then Dual's
  helped us clear up more than one muddle, an' he's even helped the police. If
  you don't want to take my word, ask Johnson of the Central Office. He's come
  to us to ask for that sort of help just like that girl did this morning. An'
  he got what he come for too. Now try an' laugh that off."</p>

  <p>"Well, by Heaven!" Once more Lamb's expression altered, showed genuine
  surprise, and something else, a vague puzzlement perhaps. He frowned. In some
  degree at last he seemed impressed. Jim's rumbling defiance of his opinion
  couched in language he could not fail to understand seemed to have caught his
  attention, held it, and even raised a question he sought to answer and
  failed. He rasped out his half profane exclamation and paused, and then went
  on again. "So that's who you are. You used to be Inspector Bryce. I remember
  you now. You weren't a fool either, from all accounts, in those days.
  You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jim interrupted. "Don't let the idea that I'm one now run away with you,
  George. This thing boils down to this. Things happen, an' you an' me don't
  always know why. But this stuff Dual believes in and puts into practice shows
  why it did, I don't mean maybe."</p>

  <p>"Apparently not," Lamb said. He forced a smile, but I noted that his frown
  still lingered in his eyes. "However, I'm afraid that we've been wasting time
  in a discussion that is leading nowhere. Just what is it you want to know
  about my brother? I still can't see that it affects either you or your friend
  to any justifiable extent, but&mdash;put it into words."</p>

  <p>"Do you," I said, "know of anything bearing directly on the incidents of
  last night, any reason why your brother, Imer, should have chosen Kingsley
  his valet, any reason why he should have tried to assault any one?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally, I don't," he declared without hesitation. "If I'd even dreamed
  that Imer was on the verge of running amuck, I'd have taken steps to keep him
  under restraint."</p>

  <p>"You would have?" I questioned.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he returned with a sigh that smacked of exasperation. "I
  hope, Mr. Glace, you don't think I'm one to let a man with a homicidal mania
  run at large."</p>

  <p>"You know about Dr. Simpson's belief that it is homicidal mania, then?" I
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"Know about it?" he repeated. "Of course, I know about it. As soon as I
  knew about what happened last night I tried to get my brother out on bail;
  saw Kingsley, got his assurance that he wouldn't appear against him, and then
  bumped into Simpson's version of the matter; and failed, of course."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he shrugged his shoulders and laughed again without any sound of
  humor. "Oh, there's reason enough why I'm not quite myself this afternoon.
  Simpson insists on holding him for observation. Nice thought, my
  brother&mdash;kid I grew up with&mdash;stuck into some public institution
  with a lot of common bums and thugs."</p>

  <p>"I can understand that," I assented. "But under the conditions there is
  little you can do about it, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Glace." He pursed his full lips in an expression of
  consideration. "I don't know yet, for sure&mdash;that is. There, may be a way
  out. I've a little influence. I may be able to get Imer turned over to
  me&mdash;get the privilege of keeping him in a private institution if Simpson
  decides he's right inside the next few days. Right now that's about the best
  I can hope for, so far as I can see."</p>

  <p>"If your influence is strong enough to turn the trick?" Bryce said as Lamb
  once more paused.</p>

  <p>Lamb nodded. "Sure. But I think it is."</p>

  <p>"Then it would be your best bet, if a commission decides that Simpson's
  right," Jim agreed. "Would you get yourself appointed his guardian, or
  what?"</p>

  <p>"Guardian?" Lamb appeared to consider the suggestion. "Why, I hadn't
  thought of that. It could be done, I suppose. But I can't see any need.
  Technically Imer and I are partners, even if he does hardly ever come in down
  here. What I mean, though, as applying to your question, is that Imer's money
  is in the business jointly with my own.</p>

  <p>"I've looked after the business end of his share of the estate for years.
  So I don't see where the necessity of taking out guardianship papers would
  come in. I can't see why things should not continue as they are as long as
  his share of the income is sufficient to supply his needs."</p>

  <p>"Not as long as you're practically in charge of his affairs already," said
  Bryce.</p>

  <p>"Not only practically, but actually, Mr. Bryce." For the third time Lamb
  laughed. "Ever since he came out of the army Imer has done little but play
  about. That's the real reason I was opposed to his marrying Miss Mason. I've
  nothing against the girl herself; but I don't consider her the type of woman
  for his wife.</p>

  <p>"I would have liked to see him marry some girl who would have stimulated
  his ambition. Oh, he has ambition if it could be waked up. He made a good
  record in the war. But since then he's gone head over heels into sports,
  tennis, golf, motor racing, aviation here of late. He did a bit of that while
  he was in the service, as you may have heard.</p>

  <p>"But a woman can keep a man on the ground as well as lift him to the
  skies. And it's the ground sort of woman Imer ought to have&mdash;the sort of
  woman who would stimulate him to get in and dig, instead of being content to
  'let George do it,' as I said before, and live off the income of the money
  his father made."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he thinks that's only a fair break after all," Bryce observed.
  "Didn't old Lamb leave you half his estate?"</p>

  <p>"He did," Lamb replied. "And I'm not kicking, Mr. Bryce. What I've really
  been trying to put into words is that I've wanted Imer to do something more
  than dawdle his time away, for his own good. Life isn't all play, Mr. Bryce.
  I've felt he ought to do something worth while."</p>

  <p>"Still," Jim persisted, "practically, I can't see that it really matters
  so long as you do enough for both."</p>

  <p>Lamb turned his glance toward him briefly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know that it does," he said.</p>

  <p>The telephone beside him on the desk emitted a purr. He turned toward it,
  answered, listened, and spoke. "Tell 'em to wait. I'll be through in a few
  minutes."</p>

  <p>Replacing the receiver, he turned again to Bryce. "On the whole, I'm not
  sure but it's fortunate the way things have turned out. If Imer had done what
  I wanted, he'd have left me up in the air. There would have been things,
  details of business, with which I wouldn't have been in touch. This
  way&mdash;well&mdash;I've all the threads in my fingers. And I'm up to my
  neck in one or two big deals."</p>

  <p>"You're in the Acme Film, aren't you?" Jim said.</p>

  <p>There were times when he had an impudent nerve. Now, as it seemed to me,
  he might as well have asked Lamb the reason for Nathalie Norton's presence in
  his office when we arrived. My mind harked back to the woman, even as I
  awaited Lamb's reply.</p>

  <p>"Acme Film?" I thought he narrowed his lids, that just for an instant they
  hooded his eyes; and then for the fourth time he laughed. "Nathalie Norton
  make you think of that, Mr. Bryce?"</p>

  <p>Jim nodded. A half grin twitched at his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Thought she might be comin' back into pictures," he confessed. "The Acme
  used to distribute her stuff, didn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It did." Lamb leaned back in the chair in which he sat. For a moment he
  said nothing more, and then he resumed in what seemed a complacent voice:
  "But Nathalie isn't thinking of coming back at present. She just dropped in
  to see me. She's an intimate friend of mine."</p>

  <p>For a moment Bryce sat puffing out his stubby toothbrush mustache, and
  then he struck back verbally at Lamb's air of aplomb:</p>

  <p>"Why have you been urgin' marriage on your brother?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't been urging marriage on him," Lamb snapped. "I've merely told
  you the sort of woman I felt he ought to marry if he wanted a wife."</p>

  <p>I thought of what Jim had said that morning about a good woman being the
  finest product of her race, and the other sort being the worst influence in
  the world; but I said no word. Once more the picture of Nathalie Norton swam
  before my mental eyes. And then again I heard Bryce:</p>

  <p>"I guess we'll be on our way, an' let you go on with your work." He stood
  up, and I rose to my feet too.</p>

  <p>"That," said Lamb, as he reached for the telephone standard, "is a
  mutually happy thought. Good afternoon, Mr. Glace and Mr. Bryce."</p>

  <p>"Toodle-oo," said Jim and turned to the door.</p>

  <p>I followed him out.</p>

  <p>Outside he exploded into the righteous indignation of a real man. "The
  dirty scut! For two cents I'd go back and spread my fist over his map. I was
  a bull for years, an' I seen enough then; but George makes me sick. Take a
  long breath an' get some clean air into your lungs. Breathe deep, son,
  breathe deep. On the level, if I had my choice of bein' one of them two I'd
  choose to be Imer on his past record, even if they are going to put him in
  the foolish house."</p>

  <p>I nodded. I felt a good deal the same myself. George Lamb had impressed me
  unpleasantly from the first, and toward the last he had actually affected me
  with a sense akin to nausea.</p>

  <p>"Speaking of Imer, it occurs to me that being as prominent an amateur
  sportsman as he has been, there should be more than a little interest shown
  in his case. Let's buy a paper, and see what they say about it."</p>

  <p>Jim hailed a newsboy with a late afternoon edition, and bought one of the
  still damp sheets.</p>

  <p>Then standing there together on a corner we ran through it, seeking for
  any public mention of the man in whom we had come to feel an interest, and
  after a time we found it:</p>

  <p>IMER LAMB VICTIM OF HOMICIDAL MANIA, CITY PHYSICIAN SIMPSON SAYS</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; SEMI DUAL LISTENS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE story itself was no more than a rehash of the arrest of
  Lamb the night before, plus a very complete play-up of the man's record in
  the world of amateur sport. There followed the statement of the city
  alienist, and the information that Lamb had that afternoon been transferred
  to the County Hospital observation ward. We read it, and Bryce folded up the
  paper, thrusting it into a pocket of his coat.</p>

  <p>"And except for one thing that would settle the matter," he declared. "If
  Moira Mason hadn't come to us this morning, an' Dual hadn't taken an interest
  in this affair, why, Imer would be as good as tended to, I guess."</p>

  <p>I nodded. Save for the intervention of the woman&mdash;the clouded sunbeam
  girl, as I persisted in thinking of her&mdash;Imer Lamb's life in so far as
  his fellow man was concerned would be as good as closed, since even though
  his body went on living, the real man, now that reason had tottered on her
  throne in his fellow man's opinion, the Imer Lamb who had been&mdash;had
  died.</p>

  <p>"Let's go tell him about Kingsley and George," said Bryce.</p>

  <p>"All right," I agreed.</p>

  <p>We went back, entered the foyer of the Urania, and caught an express car
  to the top. Side by side we mounted the bronze and marble stairs. Beside the
  fountain in the shadow of the tower cast by the westering sun was seated a
  figure in purple and white; Semi Dual sat there in seeming meditation, which
  he broke as the annunciator chimes rang out.</p>

  <p>"My friends," he said, lifting his deep gray eyes as we approached and
  smiling slightly. "My friends, who have been as feet for me, while the soul
  of me has worked, so that ye have traveled while I have sat and thought. Tell
  me that which I perceive now has been not wholly to your liking."</p>

  <p>Bryce fumbled in a pocket, produced a cigar, and lowered himself to the
  seat beside the fountain basin in which tiny goldfish flitted to and fro like
  vagrant flecks of the sunlight that was gilding the rest of the roof.</p>

  <p>I followed suit.</p>

  <p>And then we told the man who had sent us forth what we had done, omitting
  no detail we could recall, however slight. He listened, sunk again, as it
  appeared from his posture and his utter quiet, into his mood of meditation
  between us on the carved stone bench.</p>

  <p>On and on our voices droned, reciting scraps of conversation, describing
  incidents.</p>

  <p>"They transferred Lamb to the County Hospital this afternoon," I
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Into invisible bondage," Dual made comment, half as it seemed to us and
  half to himself.</p>

  <p>"Eh? Invisible?" Bryce repeated.</p>

  <p>"The bonds of the soul are invisible, unseen. And he whose soul, whose
  self, is enchained in such fashion is lost indeed&mdash;unless some soul
  agency intervenes."</p>

  <p>"Some soul agency?" I revoiced the syllables that gave me that impression
  of widening circles spreading out&mdash;spreading out just beyond the reach
  of my pursuing mind.</p>

  <p>"The law of the universe, rather than any law of man, my friend. Love, a
  soul agency, intervention!" The picture of Moira Mason swam before my mental
  vision again; Imer Lamb would seem to have won her love at least. Had her
  coming, through us, to the man who sat now beside me been the beginning of
  the intervention he meant?</p>

  <p>If so, then since we had left him this morning he must have learned
  something by his own peculiar methods toward the formulating of that opinion
  he had promised the golden-haired, blue-eyed little fiancée of Imer Lamb.</p>

  <p>"Semi," I said, "you've learned something?"</p>

  <p>"Not much," he said. "Of course, I have erected a horary figure of the
  assault Lamb made on his valet, after you telephoned me the hour of the call
  for his arrest. From that I might learn something, since each incident in
  life is but the result of causes constantly at work; Imer Lamb's attack upon
  the man whom he has befriended, whose life he saved, was the effect of causes
  leading inevitably to it, no matter how causeless it appears.</p>

  <p>"Some shadowing of those causes I have discovered, crossed threads of
  meaning which, as I sat here before you came, I was seeking to
  coordinate."</p>

  <p>"But this here now horary I figure, as you call it, would at least have
  shown whether Lamb was off his head when he made his attack on Kingsley,"
  Bryce suggested. "Shown his condition at that time, I mean."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Semi Dual agreed. "At the time he attacked the man Imer Lamb
  was insane, in the sense in which modern man uses the term. He was insane;
  had been verging on insanity for some time. To that extent Dr. Simpson is
  right in the practice of his craft. More than that I would not care to say
  until I have gone more fully into my consideration of his case."</p>

  <p>"You mean you think he may recover, break these here invisible bonds you
  were speakin' of?" Bryce said.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," Dual answered slowly. "That must depend largely upon the
  causes which have led up to the present instance, I think."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" Jim began, and sat frowning.</p>

  <p>"You are thinking of the woman who came to me this morning," Semi Dual
  said as he paused. "To her I made a promise, and I shall redeem it in
  whatsoever manner I may. To that end, tonight I shall work, aided by what you
  have told me, and by what I shall read in yet other figures bearing on the
  question which troubles her soul, which I shall synthesize before the
  appointed hour. Bring her to me at that time."</p>

  <p>The strange man on the bench in his white and purple robes, who read in
  the very sweep of the stars the mandates of the law of cause and effect in
  which he believed, had confirmed the opinion of the physician already
  broadcasted through the city in printer's ink; Imer Lamb was insane. His body
  had become no more than a house of bondage, his brain no more than a dwelling
  place, through the familiar corridors of which his soul struggled&mdash;no
  longer a free thing, but a thing dragging an invisible ball and chain,
  enslaved to Heaven knew what forces.</p>

  <p>As I gained my feet and Bryce rose also, Dual spoke again a final parting
  assurance.</p>

  <p>"Yet justice shall be done, my friends, and the law shall take its
  course."</p>

  <p>We left him sitting there in his white and purple robes, and went down the
  path and the stairway, Bryce stalking beside me in silence, his cigar fast
  between his teeth.</p>

  <p>And all at once Bryce spoke: "Justice can't afford to give much heed to
  Mercy. It wouldn't be justice if she did. An' the first thing we knew,
  instead of wearin' a bandage over her eyes, she'd be shedding glycerin
  tears."</p>

  <p>It was like Bryce to say a thing like that. There was always about him a
  hard-headed facetiousness. None knew better than I that he had been stirred
  in no small measure by the half hour we had spent with the man we had just
  left, by the words that man had spoken, or that it was that very fact which
  dictated the turn of the comment he had just voiced. I thought a lot of
  Bryce, knew him as one knows a man with whom he has worked shoulder to
  shoulder for years.</p>

  <p>I smiled at him now as we stood waiting for an elevator that came humming
  up the shaft. Once more we were back in the modern, everyday world.</p>

  <p>"Just the same," exploded Jim, "I'd rather it was Dual than me had to tell
  that girl that Imer's off his nut."</p>

  <p>That was like Jim, too. He had a big, and at times almost romantic heart
  under his bluff exterior.</p>

  <p>Back in the office he referred to the matter again. "Imer's bughouse," he
  says, and then says that justice will be done an' the law will take its
  course. Now, what in times does he mean? If Imer's crazy, where is there any
  reason for pulling justice in, and what's the law got to do with the
  thing?</p>

  <p>"Just between you and me I wouldn't trust that foster brother of his any
  farther than I could sling a flivver by the crank."</p>

  <p>"You're right, Jim," I said.</p>

  <p>Jim nodded. "Go on, call up Miss Mason, an' tell her to come here in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>"Listen," I said, as I put out my hand for the telephone. "Is there any
  trouble with Acme Film?"</p>

  <p>"Huh!" Bryce nearly dropped his cigar from between his lips, then caught
  it and clamped it back between his teeth again. "I dunno, but it might bear
  looking into. George handles the whole business&mdash;says he has all the
  threads in his fingers. He said that when I asked him if he'd try to get
  himself appointed Imer's guardian. An' he's the sort of man will bear
  watchin', or I ought to be back in harness pounding pavements again."</p>

  <p>"I think so," I assented. To me it seemed that one of those widening
  ripples of meaning had at last been in a measure overtaken by my pursuing
  brain. Yet even so, its meaning was not plain. As yet it defied and baffled,
  was too vague for me to read. But it was there; I sensed it even though I
  could not define it. It was there.</p>

  <p>"Which&mdash;that I'm right or ought to be back in harness?" Bryce
  grinned.</p>

  <p>"Suit yourself," I told him, and took up the telephone standard to call
  Marya Harding and ask her to bring Moira Mason to us the next morning without
  fail.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Glace, has Mr. Dual learned something?" she cried the moment I had
  proffered Semi's request.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," I told her. "Not definitely, but I think so, Mrs.
  Harding."</p>

  <p>"What does he say?" she demanded. "Tell me what he says, at least."</p>

  <p>"He says justice shall be done, and the law shall take its course," I
  repeated Semi's assurance.</p>

  <p>"Justice and law," she repeated. "What does he mean by it, Mr. Glace?"</p>

  <p>I could almost feel her brain straining, even as mine was straining toward
  an understanding of the involved meaning. But I couldn't tell her.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Mrs. Harding, but he doesn't squander words," I said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; MORIA AND THE WIZARD</h2>

  <p class="first">I GOT to the office early the next morning. But even so, Jim
  was before me, a look of expectancy on his face, and his inevitable cigar
  clamped fast between his teeth.</p>

  <p>"I saw Johnson and told him what Semi said, an' it sent him up in the air
  without a parachute to get down on," he announced the moment we were
  together.</p>

  <p>"Well, Johnson's the law," I said.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Jim stared. Then he nodded. "Well, I see what you mean; in a way he
  is. Anyway, there's going to be a commission appointed to examine Imer today.
  With Simpson standin' pat, that's merely a formality, Johnson seems to think.
  That's why he can't seem to see into that law and justice thing of Dual's. I
  left him chewin' on it."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," I said, "since you couldn't help him yourself."</p>

  <p>Bryce grinned. And then he sobered. "Nice day," he remarked, walking to a
  window, and staring out at a cloudless sky.</p>

  <p>"Too nice a day to be committed to that 'invisible bondage,' as Semi calls
  it."</p>

  <p>He turned back to me again. "I'm interested in what lies back and behind
  what Semi's going to say to that girl this morning. When she comes I'm going
  up there with you, if you don't mind."</p>

  <p>I nodded. "Sure, Jim," I said. "Come along if you like."</p>

  <p>An hour passed before Moira Mason came.</p>

  <p>Then Marya Harding brought her as on the day before.</p>

  <p>"Marya told me what your strange friend said last evening," she said, as
  she gave me her hand. "I mean about justice and law. And I puzzled over it
  all night long. You still have no idea what he meant?"</p>

  <p>"No clear idea, Miss Mason," I returned. "But I'm sure he meant something
  that time will make plain."</p>

  <p>"You know that Imer is to go before a commission this morning?" she said
  with a little catch in her breath, and a quivering mouth.</p>

  <p>"Yes'm," Bryce assured her before I could answer. "But that's just
  routine. Wouldn't you like to go up now an' see what Dual says?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, yes. Let's go," she assented. "I want to hear it, to know the
  best&mdash;or the worst&mdash;at once."</p>

  <p>Jim and I took the two ladies up to the sun-bathed garden. Moira Mason
  fairly ran up the stairs from the twentieth floor to the roof.</p>

  <p>As before, Dual sat beside the fountain. Only now he had provided shade
  for his guests against the sun's increasing heat, an awning of heavy striped
  silk, supported on slender poles.</p>

  <p>Seen so in his robes of white and purple, with his splendid head and
  well-trimmed beard, he might have been some desert chieftain. And even like
  one, as we reached him, he put out both hands to Moira Mason, and she laid
  her hands in them, and looked up into his bending face.</p>

  <p>"My child," he said. "My child, through the night I have beheld thee ever
  shining through my work, and now I see thy face, thou lamp of life through
  whom perchance light may even yet illumine a darkened house."</p>

  <p>I caught at his words, and glanced at Marya Harding and at Bryce. Marya's
  lips were parted, and Jim's eye met mine in a quickening flash. Yesterday the
  strong man holding the hands of the girl we had brought to him, had likened
  the brain of a man to a house; now he was likening her to a lamp through
  which light might shine in it again.</p>

  <p>She seemed to sense his meaning dimly. Her lips parted. She breathed
  deeply. Under the soft summer fabric that veiled it, I saw the quick rise and
  fall of her soft breast.</p>

  <p>"You mean that&mdash;" she began. "That the brain of man may be a house of
  invisible bondage, unless some other soul shall strike off its chains?"</p>

  <p>We found seats, Marya Harding and Moira, on the carved stone bench, Bryce
  and I on the rim of the fountain where the goldfish played. Dual stood
  between us. We sat like students at the feet of a master.</p>

  <p>"Three of you who come to me this morning," spoke the sage, "know of my
  faith in the soundless voice of the stars. Therefore I have questioned them
  as to the why and wherefore of the thing which has come upon Imer Lamb. I
  have constructed astral charts dealing with the nativity of Imer Lamb
  himself, and of you, Miss Mason. And I have set up a figure dealing with the
  events of night before last. And now, as I pledged myself to do, I shall give
  you in part at least the message of the stars.</p>

  <p>"The Moon and Mercury in the nativity of Imer Lamb are in favorable aspect
  to the sign of the ascendant. This means little to you, but to me it says
  that Imer Lamb, though insane&mdash;though about to be adjudged
  insane&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Adjudged insane!" The words fell as a tense whisper from Moira Mason's
  lips.</p>

  <p>Dual extended his hand palm upward, toward her. "Peace," he said in his
  mellow tones. "Peace, my child. Are not the fingers of the soul Faith and
  Hope? Man judges his fellow man in his wisdom. Yet the wisdom of man too
  often is of the earth, earthy. Tune thy ear to the wisdom of other
  spheres."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but don't you see? If they adjudge him insane they
  will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They will lead him to a House of Invisible Bondage," said Semi Dual.</p>

  <p>"Marya!" Moira Mason cried out, and turned to the woman beside her, and
  hid her face against her, clinging to her, while a tremor of horror shook
  her.</p>

  <p>I glanced at Bryce. A House of Invisible Bondage! I saw understanding in
  his eyes. Dual had voiced the finding of the commission that would examine
  Imer Lamb; he would be committed to the hospital for the insane.</p>

  <p>Little Moira Mason's voice came again with a rasping sob.</p>

  <p>Then Semi's voice: "Peace, Moira. I but said thy loved one should be
  adjudged insane, yet had ye not cried out I should have said that the
  condition is not one depending upon any definite change in the structure of
  his mind, upon no weakness of his brain."</p>

  <p>"You mean he is not really insane!" Moira lifted herself from her posture
  against Marya Harding's body, and faced him with widening eyes.</p>

  <p>"Nay." He shook his head slowly. "Trouble not yourself with my fuller
  meaning. Here let faith come in. For in the chart of his life we find Saturn
  afflicting his Mercury and Moon. This would incline to insanity, even though
  normally dormant, because of the favorable aspect of the last two elements
  named.</p>

  <p>"Yet were something to fan it into life, this influence would excite
  insanity at night, and in the figure I have erected I find also Neptune in an
  evil configuration with the Lord of the Sixth House, also afflicting the
  ascendant and the conjoined Mercury and Moon. This could but aggravate
  Saturn's indication; and in these signs, in a measure at least, we find all
  that has happened, explained.</p>

  <p>"Also Uranus is elevated above and to a minor degree afflicts both the
  Moon and Mercury, showing a tendency to some derangement of the mind.</p>

  <p>"Mars is conjoined to Neptune. Consequently, by his aspect, Mars afflicts
  the same points as Neptune again. And here, at least, we have a material
  confirmation of the astral signs. Yesterday I asked you if Mr. Lamb drank.
  You replied that he smoked a great deal&mdash;and Neptune rules drugs which
  affect the nerves; and Mars rues tobacco, my child.</p>

  <p>"Neptune inclines toward nerve affections of a certain type. Mars urges to
  murder, assault, and war. Mr. Lamb's assault on his man Kingsley resulted
  from a mental unbalance, and was of a murderous nature. Kingsley himself said
  that his employer fought night before last even as he himself had seen him
  fight when he was a member of the American Expeditionary Force."</p>

  <p>Moira Mason nodded. "That was when he saved Joe Kingsley's life. He was
  brave. But if everything affects him&mdash;I thought you said&mdash;isn't
  there any hope at all?"</p>

  <p>"Hope. Aye, Hope," said Semi Dual. And suddenly he smiled. "Let Hope
  support you; for have I not said that I have studied not only the figures of
  his nativity, but of yours? And in his, Venus, Jupiter, and the Sun throw
  their beneficent rays toward his Mercury and Moon, wherein once more is a
  plain meaning, that in the hour of his greatest need aid shall be given to
  him in as much as one of these modifying planets is ruler of the eleventh
  house.</p>

  <p>"This is the House of Friends, out of which aid might best come in such a
  case. Jupiter is the orb of justice&mdash;and justice, thou troubled one, is
  a thing not easily swayed. And the Sun&mdash;happy he on whom it shines, from
  a favorable aspect."</p>

  <p>"But Venus; you haven't assigned her a definite place." How closely the
  girl on the stone bench had followed his words were shown by her mention of
  his omission.</p>

  <p>And once more Dual smiled. "Venus," he said. "Ah, yes, here enters Love.
  Venus, my child, in his life is thyself. For comparing your astral charts,
  thy Jupiter once more offsets the evil of his Saturn, while his Sun is on
  your ascendant, and shall thereby give him of thy strength.</p>

  <p>"Have I not called ye a Lamp? Have I not hinted that you should light his
  life? Have I not counseled to Faith and Hope, thou child of True Light?
  Strong though the forces be against him; yet Love is the strongest force in
  life, since Life itself is but the child of Love. Faith then, and Hope, and
  Love; herein is the triad completed. Herein the three points of the triangle
  meet."</p>

  <p>"Marya!" Once more Moira Mason cried out. "Marya! Do you hear what he
  says? I am his Lamp of Life, his Hope! Oh, heaven help us both!" Her arms
  lifted, she covered her face with her fingers, and her shoulders shook.</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Semi Dual. "See thy faith does not falter so that his friendly
  signs work."</p>

  <p>"His friendly signs?" She dropped her hands and looked him in the
  face.</p>

  <p>"Aye." For the third time Semi smiled upon her. "Thou Venus and I Jupiter,
  with my satellites Glace and Bryce. Have I not said that thy Jupiter overcame
  the evil of his Saturn, and was I not brought into the matter through thy
  intervention in coming to me in his behalf?</p>

  <p>"And perhaps the Sun, perhaps the Law, the law which so often lets in
  light upon the happenings in dark places should its power be invoked will
  work."</p>

  <p>Work. The word caught me up, with its implication of action to be taken in
  the future, steps to be made. To me it seemed that as never before Dual had
  taken a definite stand, assigned himself a definite place.</p>

  <p>I glanced at my partner. He sat leaning a trifle forward, the stump of a
  dead cigar he had forgotten and let die out, clamped in a corner of his
  mouth. His hand, next to me on the rim of the fountain basin, was clamped
  upon it until the knuckles showed white.</p>

  <p>"I was talking to his brother," said Moira, "on the telephone, last night.
  He said he hoped that they might let him take charge of Imer and put him in
  some private institution, instead of sending him to an asylum run by the
  State."</p>

  <p>"I think it quite probable that he will succeed in that endeavor," Semi
  declared.</p>

  <p>"But he will come out again, be released, recover his reason?"</p>

  <p>"Again in my estimation. It is to that end we shall work, thou, and I, and
  my friends, Glace and Bryce. And perchance, should the situation require it,
  should the need arise, justifying the action, perhaps others whom we shall
  call to our aid."</p>

  <p>For the first time since Semi had begun his exposition of the astral
  position of the matter, Moira Mason turned her eyes to where Jim and I
  sat.</p>

  <p>"You gentlemen will help him?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Small need of your askin' that," Bryce answered that appeal on the
  instant. "All he's got to do is give his orders an' we'll carry 'em out, Miss
  Mason."</p>

  <p>"And you, sir," she turned again to Semi, "I have money. Do what you
  can&mdash;everything. Spare no expense. As long as it lasts&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nay," he interrupted. "I am blessed with means in plenty. But for my
  friends, who shall aid me, for their time and what expense shall be incurred,
  I accept thy aid. For in this matter it is written that Venus shall prove a
  friend of great assistance. So then I shall call upon you at the proper time.
  Meanwhile, possess thyself in faith. That which is to be will be; yet through
  thy intervention the course of what shall be has been changed. Encourage thy
  heart with this thought; and be not dismayed."</p>

  <p>Moira Mason rose, and looked full into his face with its hint of
  unassailable strength. "In that faith you have given me, and the hope it
  inspires I shall wait for whatever happens," she said. "Mr. Bryce, will you
  lead me back to the everyday world?"</p>

  <p>As he lifted himself from his seat, she smiled a smile of hope.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; GETTING TOGETHER</h2>

  <p class="first">"KINGSLEY gave us the lowdown that far anyway," Jim said as
  we watched Marya Harding and Moira Mason drive away, after escorting them
  down to their car. "The little girl's a bit of all right."</p>

  <p>We went back to our office, and he began to rave. I think I might best
  describe it as that. He was as full of unshed words as the skin of an
  overstuffed sausage is of meat.</p>

  <p>"Jupiter, Venus, and the Sun, Uranus, Neptune and Mars," he broke out the
  minute we were inside my private room and had closed the door. "The Moon an'
  Mercury are afflicted by the latter, an' I'm sick myself. My great
  grandmother's cat! What a constellation of stars. Faith, Hope, an' Love.</p>

  <p>"If Semi's even half right about this thing, it looks like a free-for-all
  with no holds barred. Imer Lamb is crazy except for the fact that there's
  nothing the matter with his head&mdash;despite which he's billed through to a
  House of Invisible Bondage, an' it's our job to pry him out." He produced a
  cigar, bit off the end, and fumbled in a pocket without success. "Got a
  match?"</p>

  <p>I gave him one. "All you have said is true," I remarked. "Your exposition
  of the matter is quite complete, and it's lucid as mud."</p>

  <p>"Yes, ain't it?" Jim grinned as he lighted his cigar. "But the point is
  that it proves I was dead right."</p>

  <p>"How come?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Why about there bein' a lot more back an' behind this matter of Bo-Peep's
  Lamb than you can see on the face. The only trouble is we don't know what it
  is."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "that's the trouble. But then, both as a cop and later as
  a private detective, you may have found that frequently the case."</p>

  <p>He nodded, grinning again. "Oh, yes," he admitted. "You're a funny fellow,
  Gordon. You're as humorous as a crutch. An' there's somethin' else funny.
  That's how Semi works. Ordinarily, if a man's crazy, he's crazy. It takes a
  man like Semi Dual to calmly announce that he's that way because a few
  antagonistic stars have put his Moon an' his Mercury on the blink. Well,
  that's that. Mercury rules the mind, I understand, an' th' Moon is the pet
  sign of our friends the lunatics.</p>

  <p>"Only that ain't the point. What I mean is that if it wasn't for Semi,
  Imer would simply be slipped into some institution, an' the incident would be
  marked closed, as apparently it's not. An' Bo-Peep would be a widow without
  havin' been a wife, instead of drivin' off with the understandin' that as
  Venus she's got a chance to help get Imer sprung from the foolish house. Do
  you see what I'm drivin' at?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, old boy," I told him. "Semi says that justice is going to be
  done, which means that he sees even now a little bit deeper than he said,
  that he has at least some conception of what it's all about. And he told her
  just now that we were going to help him clear this matter; so that being the
  case it looks to me as though our part was simply to hold ourselves ready to
  carry out his orders&mdash;and meanwhile wait.</p>

  <p>"In the main," he assented as I paused. "But not quite. I'm goin' to find
  out what I can about the Acme Film Company. I got a friend that's pretty well
  on the inside in pictures, an' I'm goin' to call on him an' have a talk."</p>

  <p>"Still figuring on George?" I said as he stood up.</p>

  <p>"I don't like him." He frowned the least bit. "I don't cotton to him
  m'son. Lookin' at it that way you might say I was prejudiced; but he owes
  what he has to Imer's old man, ever since he was a kid, an' I've noticed that
  his sort of a cur don't hesitate to bite the hand that feeds it.</p>

  <p>"Gratitude is somethin' that dies darned quick when it happens to run
  against a man's self-conceit&mdash;an' George is conceited. He thinks he's
  the only skipper on the cheese. What I don't know is where he shows up in
  Semi's charts. But he must show somewhere. He's close to Imer. Dual said
  Saturn, Neptune, Uranus, Mars, was unfriendly to Lamb. I'm no astrologer, my
  boy, but I'd like to know which of them unfriendly four is George."</p>

  <p>"You think he is one of them?" I questioned. As yet I had found no time in
  which to indulge in speculation as to Semi's deeper meaning, and my
  understanding of the subject was vague. Just the same Jim's suggestion gave
  me pause.</p>

  <p>Roughly speaking I knew the characteristics assigned to the major planets,
  and I knew that the nature of Uranus was held to be explosive in type. Also I
  knew that both Uranus and Neptune revolved on their axes in a reverse
  direction from the earth. I had heard Dual state that Uranian and Neptunian
  natures were apt to defy earth&mdash;established conventions. A picture of
  Nathalie Norton and of George Lamb, as we had talked with him the day before,
  grew swiftly in my mind. I looked Jim in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'll lay you a bet he's Uranus," he declared, confirming my silent
  surmise.</p>

  <p>Jim left me to my speculations, starting on his self-determined
  investigation of Acme Film.</p>

  <p>It was twelve o'clock. I put on my hat, and went out for lunch.</p>

  <p>Bryce was in the office when I got back, and as usual he was smoking. But
  I could see no satisfaction in his face.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "did you find out much about Acme?"</p>

  <p>"I did. I reckon I found out all about it." He nodded. "I found out that
  George, and Imer, and a coupla movie picture magnates are Acme, an' its stock
  is quoted above par with none for sale, an' that they're distributing for
  what you might call the cream of the movie stars.</p>

  <p>"An' speaking of stars, I found out enough to convince me that when it
  comes to readin' astrological indications, I'm apparently not the man for the
  job. Accordin' to my information, Gibraltar's a crumblin' ruin alongside Acme
  Film."</p>

  <p>He seemed actually crestfallen about it, and I smiled. "Apparently then,
  Acme Film is a going concern," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"That's it. It's goin' good." Jim scowled. "I let on to this party I went
  to see that I was thinkin' of pickin' up a few shares, an' he admitted it was
  a good thing to think if it could be done, the only trouble with the notion
  being that he didn't believe it could, in view of the fact that the Lambs an'
  these picture foundrymen had it all nailed down. He called it the same thing
  you do, a goin' concern. Seemed to think the best thing a guy could ask was a
  chance to go along."</p>

  <p>"Then," I began, and paused as a heavy voice rumbled in the outer office;
  the door was pulled unceremoniously open, and Inspector Johnson stepped
  in.</p>

  <p>"Hello," he said, as he made for a chair and lowered himself upon it.
  "Busy?"</p>

  <p>"Not excessively," I confessed. "Jim, here, had an idea he thought a lot
  of till the thing blew up. But otherwise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Most of his ideas are that way," Johnson interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Bryce grunted.</p>

  <p>"Otherwise," Johnson gave him a grin. "Still, where ignorance is
  bliss&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dora, keep your slams," Jim cut him short. "As a wisecracker you're
  the sort would think a firecracker something to eat. So, before you try to
  lay any pavements out of that bit of concrete you carry around on your
  shoulders, suppose you put us hep to what sort of information you expected to
  get by comin' up here."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I come up with the notion of makin' a friendly
  visit," Johnson declared.</p>

  <p>"You did?" Bryce eyed him. "Well, you're makin' a darned poor start.
  However, I've known you long enough to be willin' to take your word for it,
  no matter how you act. Just what was your notion of bein' friendly?"</p>

  <p>"Why, this Imer Lamb," Johnson said. "Yesterday an' this mornin' you
  seemed to be takin' an interest in his case. He had his hearin' this mornin',
  an' they paroled him in the care of his brother. Thought you might like to
  hear th' result."</p>

  <p>"Paroled him, did they?" Jim received the information.</p>

  <p>I met his eyes; their lids were narrowed.</p>

  <p>Johnson nodded. "Yep. His brother showed up at the hearing, an' offered to
  take care of him at his own expense. Put up a bond an' agreed to see that
  Imer had medical treatment an' all the rest of it. Naturally the commission
  didn't care, as long as the case was taken care of, an' of course it's that
  much less expense to the State. So they let Lamb take him."</p>

  <p>"Where?" Bryce questioned.</p>

  <p>"Out here. To Doc Drake's, I understand," Johnson returned. "At least
  that's what I understood he meant to do at the hearing. You know Drake's got
  a place out here in the Hillcrest addition&mdash;big house he took three or
  four years ago an' fixed up for his sort of work. Lamb agreed to take Imer
  out there an' turn him over to Drake. Didn't know whether you'd heard it yet
  or not."</p>

  <p>"Nope." Jim shook his head. "We hadn't. But George said he had that sort
  of a move in his mind yesterday afternoon, like I told you this mornin'.
  Well, he seems to have put it across."</p>

  <p>"Put it across?" Johnson repeated.</p>

  <p>"Sure. Got Imer turned over to him instead of to the State," Bryce
  explained.</p>

  <p>"Oh," Johnson said. "Well, I guess that's natural enough. The Lambs have
  bundles of money. There's no reason why George shouldn't fix it that way, is
  there?"</p>

  <p>"None that I know of," said Bryce.</p>

  <p>"Anyway," Johnson went on, "that does for Imer. Everything's all
  shipshape, open and aboveboard. What I can't see is how that justice and law
  stuff you were pullin' as comin' from your friend Dual this mornin' matches
  up."</p>

  <p>So that was it. I looked at him and laughed. "Believe in reciprocity,
  don't you, Johnson?" I took a part in the conversation. "You come up here
  with the dope on Imer's being paroled to George an' literally railroaded into
  a private insane asylum; and I suppose Jim told you that Moira Mason had a
  date to meet Semi this morning when you two had your chat."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well," he said, "I ain't denyin' that in view of how things turned
  out at the hearin' I've been wonderin' just how he'd look at it. I've worked
  a few times with him, as you know, an' though I've never been able to make
  him or his stuff I'm ready enough to admit that it ain't like him to be left
  holdin' th' sack. I asked Simpson after the hearing if these homicidal mania
  cases ever recovered, an' he let on it was mighty seldom."</p>

  <p>Bryce cut in: "An' you was sort of hopin' that maybe for once you'd got
  Semi in a trap?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no." Johnson frowned. Though he had worked with Dual, had appealed to
  him through us for aid, Semi's work and his methods had always left him
  baffled, puzzled as he had said. One could hardly escape the feeling that he
  would not have been overwhelmed with sorrow had Dual actually made a slip.
  "It ain't that', Jim," he continued. "Not exactly. But what happened this
  mornin' seems sort of final."</p>

  <p>"Yes, don't it?" Bryce mumbled about his cigar. "Not withstandin' which,
  I've an idea that if you was to ask him you'd find Dual standin' pat. He told
  Moira Mason they was goin' to lead Imer to a House of Invisible Bondage,"
  said Jim. "An' I reckon that about describes this place of Drake's."</p>

  <p>"Just about," Johnson assented. "Big house on a hill, with a lot of trees
  around it, an' a lot of its windows barred. Aside from that, what else did he
  tell her?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he told her plenty," Jim declared. His disgruntled air had left him.
  He seemed to be enjoying himself. Johnson was exhibiting the symptoms he
  generally manifested when Dual and his work were discussed. "He told her that
  Imer's Saturn an' Neptune an' Uranus an' Mars was on the trail of his Mercury
  and Moon, but that sort of offsettin' that was th' fact that his Venus an'
  his Jupiter, with a couple of satellites of the latter was mighty friendly,
  as well as his Sun. That bein' the case, an' a sort of civil warfare havin'
  developed in Imer's affairs, horoscopically speakin', there's considerable
  work to be done, which is where Jupiter's satellites come in."</p>

  <p>"Talk sense," our visitor growled. "It's Lamb they had before the
  commission."</p>

  <p>"I am talkin' sense," Bryce rejoined. "It ain't my fault if you can't
  understand. But referrin' to your remarks concernin' ignorance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jim!" Suddenly Johnson stopped him with a word. His whole bearing
  altered, became that of a man demanding serious consideration both for
  himself and the topic under discussion. "See here, boys, maybe he did tell
  that girl what Jim says, or something like it. I know the way he talks. But
  what did he say that a man on the street could understand?"</p>

  <p>"Little enough," I told him. "He told her to possess herself in faith, and
  not to be dismayed. I judge that he referred to the findings of the
  commission as much as anything by the last."</p>

  <p>"An' he told her to hope," said Bryce.</p>

  <p>"Faith, hope," Johnson repeated, frowning. "What did he mean by it, boys?
  I know enough about him to know that when he talks in that sort of secretive
  way he always means somethin' more than he says."</p>

  <p>"Frankly, Johnson, we don't know what he meant beyond that there's
  something funny about this case, something more than appears as yet."</p>

  <p>"Crooked?" he challenged me in a word.</p>

  <p>"That's merely an assumption," I returned. "But Jim told you what he said
  about justice and law, and this morning he said that the aid of the law might
  be invoked."</p>

  <p>"But, good Lord!" Johnson breathed deeply. He seemed wholly mystified.
  "What's crooked about a man's going crazy?"</p>

  <p>"We don't know," Jim said. "An' Dual ain't told us yet."</p>

  <p>"But you think there is?" Johnson turned toward him.</p>

  <p>"Suit yourself. He's as good as told us to hold ourselves ready to get
  busy when he gives the word." Jim shrugged.</p>

  <p>"You?" Johnson stared.</p>

  <p>"Sure." Bryce nodded. "You see we're Jupiter's satellites, Moira Mason is
  Venus, an' maybe you're the Sun; anyway, I gathered that the Sun represented
  the law, from what he said."</p>

  <p>"Me?" Johnson stood up slowly. Once more he drew a deep breath. "Well,
  then, he does think there's something crooked about this business, an' he
  knows where to find me if there is. But it's funny." He wrinkled his heavy
  forehead in a frown of bafflement.</p>

  <p>"Yeah. It's as funny as a funeral&mdash;or it's apt to be, for somebody,
  before it's finished," Bryce agreed.</p>

  <p>"Faith an' hope, justice an' the law," Johnson rumbled, half, as it
  seemed, to himself. "Well, so long. I got to be gettin' back to the
  station."</p>

  <p>"So long," Jim returned as our caller moved toward the door.</p>

  <p>"Funny," he said. "This mornin' you said he was the law, an' then darned
  if he don't come up here this afternoon, after not havin' showed about the
  place for months."</p>

  <p>"And yet," I said, "haven't you noticed how when Semi takes hold of a
  matter things always seem to begin to check out?"</p>

  <p>Jim gave me a glance under narrowed lids.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I've noticed it, son," he said. "I ain't blind, or even as dumb
  as I talk."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE HOUSE OF INVISIBLE BONDAGE</h2>

  <p class="first">THAT then was the situation at the end of the day on which
  Imer Lamb was to become an inmate of that house of invisible
  bondage&mdash;Drake's Sanatorium, they called it.</p>

  <p>IMER LAMB PAROLED, IN CARE OF HIS BROTHER</p>

  <p>It was so the headlines announced the disposition of the case. The story
  that followed was but a rehash of those that had gone before it, once more
  stressing the appalling calamity that had befallen one of the leaders in the
  club and social life of the city, the world of amateur sport. It was a
  friendly, sympathetic story in the main. From it one gathered that among
  those who knew him best Imer Lamb had been indeed a favorite&mdash;genuine
  sportsman in the best sense of the word&mdash;that many others were grieved
  at his affliction besides Bo-Peep.</p>

  <p>I read the story, and laid it down. And suddenly on impulse I got up. It
  was between seven and eight. I told my wife I was going out, and left my
  house. All at once I had decided to go across the city to that house of
  invisible bondage, and see for myself what it was like, and meet the man who
  ran it, Drake.</p>

  <p>I didn't expect it to do any good. But I could not see where it could do
  any harm, and I felt an impelling desire to discover for myself, in so far as
  I could, the exact surroundings into which Imer Lamb, rich man, war hero, pet
  of society, and idol of amateur sportsmen, had been inducted by his brother
  George.</p>

  <p>I went down to the nearest trolley line and caught a car, and transferred
  to another that would take me into the Hillcrest section of the city. On the
  latter I asked the conductor to let me off as near to the Drake Sanatorium as
  he could.</p>

  <p>On alighting, I found myself on a corner, with directions to walk up the
  hill to my left. I essayed the climb. Presently the houses fell away to make
  room for what seemed extensive grounds, and I could see a house, its gables
  outlined against the night sky, its windows points of yellow light among
  trees.</p>

  <p>Before me was an arched gateway with a lettered sign above it. And before
  the gateway stood a cab. I turned in at the gate along a paved pathway. A
  figure of a man was before me. He trudged toward the house, sagging under the
  weight of what seemed a heavy bag; there was something familiar in his gait.
  I overtook him in a few reaching strides.</p>

  <p>"Kingsley?" I said in tentative fashion.</p>

  <p>He turned his head.</p>

  <p>"Yes sir," he said, as though not sure of my identity, and then, quickly
  removing a pipe from his mouth: "Ho, hit's Mr. Glace, sir. Good hevenink,
  sir."</p>

  <p>"Here," I offered, "let me help you with that bag."</p>

  <p>I put out my hand.</p>

  <p>"Ho, no, sir," he refused. "Thinks for Mr. Himer, sir. Hi'm takin' 'em to
  'im. My word, hain't it hawful, sir? Strike me, my 'eart bleeds for 'im, hit
  does. Th' hidiots&mdash;th' bloody, bleatin' h'idiots&mdash;thinkin' to make
  'im well bagain by shuttin' 'im hup hin ha private jail!"</p>

  <p>"Well, they couldn't very well let him run at large in his condition," I
  suggested as we went on toward the house, the bag he refused to let me carry
  swaying and bumping against his leg.</p>

  <p>"Hi know, sir, Hi know," he assented.</p>

  <p>"But Hi cawn't believe as 'ow 'e's really crazy. Hit hain't natural. But
  'e's 'ere, sir, hand Hi'm bringin' lim 'is bag. Hand 'ere we hare, sir."</p>

  <p>We went up some concrete steps to gain a porch. Kingsley knocked out his
  pipe, put it in his pocket, and punched the button of a bell. We waited.</p>

  <p>Presently the door was opened by a woman in the uniform of a nurse.</p>

  <p>"Kingsley, Mr. Lamb's man, ma'am," the valet announced himself. "Hi've
  brought 'is bag."</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;let me have it." The woman extended a hand.</p>

  <p>"Hi'll carry hit. Hit's heavy," Kingsley said. "Besides, hi'd like to see
  Mr. Himer."</p>

  <p>"You're the man he attacked, aren't you?" the nurse inquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes'm," Kingsley admitted. "But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then you'd better not see him. Give me the bag."</p>

  <p>Again she reached for it.</p>

  <p>And Kingsley surrendered it to her.</p>

  <p>"Hall right, missie&mdash;hall right. No argument. Good night, sir," he
  said, and turned to trudge down the steps.</p>

  <p>The woman turned her eyes to me.</p>

  <p>"Let me take it in for you. I suspect it is heavy, and I want to see Dr.
  Drake," I said.</p>

  <p>"What about?" She was little more cordial to me than she had been to
  Kingsley. Her face and her eyes both impressed me as hard.</p>

  <p>"Merely a casual call," I told her, and took the handle of the bag from
  her relaxing hold and carried it inside.</p>

  <p>"If you'll wait here," she said, and went quickly back along a central
  hallway to a door through which she disappeared.</p>

  <p>Then she was back, requesting me to follow to a room where a man sat in a
  swivel chair, and met my glance across a large, flat-topped mahogany desk. On
  the top were several glass jars containing what I took to be the powdered
  leaves of plants&mdash;and a pair of apothecary's scales. As I entered he was
  scooping the last of a pile of similar appearance from a paper before him
  into a wide-mouthed jar.</p>

  <p>He covered it with a porcelain top, and lifted his eyes. "Good evening,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Dr. Drake," I replied.</p>

  <p>The man was striking in appearance, dark, with an olive skin, a face
  lengthily oval, a high-bridged nose, a small tip-waxed mustache, and a small
  triangular goatee, both black. And the eyes that met mine were so dark a
  brown as to appear black under the light that poured from a shaded globe
  above the desk.</p>

  <p>He nodded and came around the desk. He was slender. There was a dapper
  something about him, a meticulous quality to his attire. "Yes."</p>

  <p>"I am Mr. Glace," I introduced myself.</p>

  <p>"Of Glace and Bryce?" He put out a slender, long-fingered hand that,
  despite the July night, was cool to my answering touch.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I assented with a sense of surprise at the readiness of his answer.
  "You've heard of me then?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes." He smiled slightly. "Be seated, Mr. Glace."</p>

  <p>"May one ask where?" I queried as I took a deeply-cushioned leather chair.
  The room seemed part den, part office, part workroom, I thought.</p>

  <p>"Oh, from several sources," he rejoined still smiling. "More recently from
  Mr. George Lamb. He tells me you called upon him yesterday afternoon."</p>

  <p>That was bringing things to a head with a vengeance. In a way I felt taken
  aback. Yet on the other hand it made far easier the introduction of the real
  motive back of my call, a thing I had been wondering just how I was going to
  introduce. I wondered just what George Lamb had told him, and I, tried to
  feel him out. "About his brother," I assented. "Poor Imer. He's going to be
  missed in the world of sport."</p>

  <p>"You're a friend of his, Mr. Glace?" he questioned, resuming his seat back
  of the desk.</p>

  <p>"Not personally," I said, deciding I'd get nowhere by masquerading with
  this man, who struck me as being decidedly alert. "But a very dear friend of
  his has interested me in his case. She&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Miss Mason you mean?" he interrupted. "Naturally what has happened has
  been a shock to her, of course. A charming girl, I understand. Did
  you-er-wish to discuss my latest patient with me, Mr. Glace?"</p>

  <p>I nodded. The interview was proving easier than I had hoped, since
  actually after I had started for Drake's place, I had wondered if I wasn't
  indulging in a wild-goose chase. "Frankly, I did," I said. "What do you think
  of his condition? Dr. Simpson seems to think it hopeless, I understand."</p>

  <p>"Pooh!" Drake surprised me by his answer. Once more he smiled, lifted his
  slender hands, and tapped their fingers one against the other. "What does
  Simpson know about it? Hopeless nothing. I expect to have the man back to a
  practical normal before long."</p>

  <p>"Really?" I actually stammered. I had expected anything save the man's
  assurance of Lamb's recovery, I think.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," he almost snapped. "Simpson is like so many of his kind. He
  considers the disease, and not the patient. One can't generalize in cases of
  this sort, Mr. Glace, any more than they can in any other disease type. One
  must study not only the disease, but the man. Lamb is healthy, strong as a
  lion. Physically he is in the pink of condition. He'll be back trying to
  break records again before long."</p>

  <p>It was amazing. Dual's words came back to my mind. Although in different
  language, he had said almost the same thing.</p>

  <p>"Does that surprise you, Mr. Glace?" I heard him question, became
  conscious that I had made no comment on the preceding remark, and hastened to
  make amends:</p>

  <p>"It certainly does surprise me, Dr. Drake, but not unpleasantly, I assure
  you. It's most encouraging. I wasn't looking for it, however, when I
  came."</p>

  <p>"Probably not," he agreed. "Smoke, Mr. Glace? I can offer you a cigar or a
  pipe."</p>

  <p>"The cigar, then, if you please," I accepted, and as he drew a box from a
  drawer of the desk, I took one of the thin brown rolls, and set it alight.
  "You've been engaged in your present line of practice long, have you, Dr.
  Drake?"</p>

  <p>"About four years," he returned, taking a pipe from a tray, and tamping it
  with tobacco from a jar on the desk. "I practiced in Los Angeles before
  that."</p>

  <p>The conversation having taken a personal turn I asked another question.
  There was a framed diploma on the wall of the room, but I could not read it
  from where I sat. "You're a graduate of what school?"</p>

  <p>"Waburn College. That's in Missouri." Suddenly he laughed. "And medically
  speaking, I'm from Missouri, Mr. Glace, in showing asses like Simpson what I
  mean by medical work. Take this Lamb case for instance. George Lamb came to
  me yesterday after his brother had been arrested, and Simpson had expressed
  himself. He told me what had happened, and I gave him my advice.</p>

  <p>"That, I think I may say without exactly flattering myself, was the main
  reason why he went before the commission appointed to dispose of his
  brother's case with the proposition to have him paroled. I explained to him
  the essential difference between my methods of handling such cases, and what
  we might expect anywhere else. There is too much routine in such matters.</p>

  <p>"That far, Simpson is right. Homicidal mania is regarded generally as
  largely hopeless. In the great majority of institutions it would be treated
  from that standpoint from the first.</p>

  <p>"Personally, however, I've discarded the word hopeless from my vocabulary.
  You'd he surprised how often it's the wrong word to use. Until recently, I
  admit, mental diseases have been rather hopeless because not well understood,
  But I'm going to tell you, Mr. Glace, that like any other disease that flesh
  is heir to, mental diseases in the majority of instances, can he cured.
  I&mdash;" Abruptly he broke off, leaned forward, cocking an ear as it
  appeared, his hands gripping the edge of the desk.</p>

  <p>And then I heard it, too, what I had not heard before, but what his ear
  had undoubtedly caught, a woman's scream, faint, far off as it appeared, but
  high-pitched, shrill, the cry of what seemed a tortured body, a tortured
  soul. Once it came, and again, somewhere in the farther reaches of the
  house.</p>

  <p>And hard upon it, while Drake still held his listening posture, before he
  had relaxed, came footfalls, hurrying footsteps in the hall outside the roam
  where we sat. The door was drawn open, and the woman who had admitted me
  appeared.</p>

  <p>"Doctor&mdash;Miss Ashton. She is becoming violent again," she said.</p>

  <p>"Very well." Drake nodded in understanding. His glance turned from the
  nurse to me. "You'll excuse me, Mr. Glace. Glad to have met you. Sorry to
  have to cut our conversation short, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course," I assented rising.</p>

  <p>"Then, good night. Mrs. Porsum will show you out."</p>

  <p>Drake hurried from the room, and left me with the woman.</p>

  <p>"This way, sir," she said.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," I said somewhat dryly. As a matter of fact, I knew my way
  out.</p>

  <p>She trailed me to the front door, however, and I let her close it behind
  me as I passed through it, and ran down the steps Kingsley had descended some
  half hour before with the wistful expression his failure to see his master
  had set upon his face.</p>

  <p>I ran down them, and made my way along the concrete path toward the
  street. My call had amazed me. It had netted me nothing except a personal
  contact with Drake, and the knowledge that he had practiced medicine in Los
  Angeles. But it had yielded me through that the positively, almost
  enthusiastically expressed opinion that Lamb would recover, whether Simpson
  thought he would or not, that before long he might depart from this House of
  Invisible Bondage.</p>

  <p>I paused as I reached the street; and shuddered as I stood there looking
  back.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; UNDERCOVER</h2>

  <p class="first">I WENT down to the corner and waited for my car. I was in
  very nearly the mental condition of Johnson when he left our office that
  afternoon. For the life of me, I couldn't see, as I caught my car and rode
  along still turning the problem in my brain, where Semi Dual's assertion that
  justice should he done, and the law take its course, came in. And I couldn't
  begin to see wherein Dual could make a move.</p>

  <p>But I went to see him the next morning. I felt that I should let him know
  of my call on Drake. And I found him having a late breakfast in his garden,
  milk, a few beaten cakes, the half of a melon, food he invited me to share.
  He was always simple in his diet.</p>

  <p>But I had breakfasted, and declined the invitation and found a seat. And
  then I told him what I had done the previous evening, what I had seen and
  heard.</p>

  <p>He listened, sipping at his milk, breaking bits off a cake with his
  fingers, taking a morsel of melon now and again.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Drake said that he felt assured of Lamb's practical recovery," he
  said when at length I paused. "You are certain that he used the word
  'practical,' my friend?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," I said. "His exact words were 'a practical normal,' but I
  attached no special importance to it at the time." I frowned. Dual had picked
  the word out of my narrative in a way that once more excited conjecture in my
  mind. And immediately he spoke again:</p>

  <p>"A human characteristic, Gordon, a human failing at times. Mankind is so
  often far-sighted that it misses the nearer thing. But at least you
  remembered the form to repeat it."</p>

  <p>"But, Semi, do you assume that he meant Lamb's recovery would he less than
  complete?" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He crumbled a bit of cake, moistened it with a sip of milk, and rolled it
  on his tongue. "One may only assume without knowing what a man has in his
  mind. At least we may assume that he meant a recovery to a degree to permit
  of the man's return to the everyday life of man," he returned at length.</p>

  <p>Bo-Peep&mdash;Moira Mason&mdash;that clouded sunbeam of a girl, I had led
  here to this garden myself&mdash;what would a recovery less than complete
  mean to her!</p>

  <p>"But I think that Venus will not he cheated," he said as so often in the
  past he had read my innermost mind. "That which a woman seeks in purity of
  heart and purpose, being within the law of life, is a hard thing for even the
  stars to deny to her who as the Hindu calls her is a Worker in the Workshop
  of the World." His glance shifted, ran past me toward the door of the tower.
  "But wait; here comes our friend Henri, with some message, I think."</p>

  <p>I turned my head. Henri was approaching. "Master, your friend Bryce rang
  the telephone but now, and I answered. He says that the young lady who was
  with you yesterday morning is in his office, and wishes to see you again,"
  he, announced.</p>

  <p>"Let the maiden come up," Dual directed. Again his eyes met mine. He
  smiled faintly. "Venus," he said.</p>

  <p>I nodded; rose. It was in my mind to withdraw. But Semi lifted a hand.
  "Sit again, my friend," he checked me. "Wait till we see what Venus
  brings."</p>

  <p>I resumed my seat. Neither of us spoke. We simply waited there beside the
  little table until the chimes rang softly, and the slender figure of Moira
  Mason came toward us along the path from the head of the stairs. And then we
  rose.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, Venus," Dual spoke in greeting. "For it comes to me that you
  come bringing aid."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Dual," she said, "I really hope so. I had to see you, speak to
  you about something that came to me last night." She was breathing quickly,
  her eyes were lighted and there was a tinge of heightened color in her
  cheeks. "You know where they took Imer yesterday, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Into the House of Invisible Bondage from which he shall come out." Semi
  inclined his head. "Yes, Venus, I know the place."</p>

  <p>She nodded. "I felt sure you would. But last evening I rang up Imer's
  rooms. I knew his brother had told me that his man was going to take some of
  his personal belongings out there, his toilet articles and clothes. So I
  called Joe and asked him how Imer seemed, and he told me they wouldn't let
  him see him.</p>

  <p>"It's"&mdash;her lips quivered&mdash;"it's as though they were keeping him
  prisoner. But you know who I am, Mr. Dual. I have money, and I want to use it
  for him. And I thought that perhaps if I were to employ a private nurse or
  attendant, it might help. But, of course, I felt that I must seek your
  opinion first."</p>

  <p>As she paused, Semi Dual's gray eyes lighted. There occurred in their
  depths a phenomenon I had seen before, as though in each had been struck into
  sudden life a tiny point of fire. It glowed there briefly. And then he
  smiled. "And did I not just say, and did I not say yesterday morning, that
  through Venus, aid should come in this matter?" he replied.</p>

  <p>"And you have done well in laying this plan before me, since to Jupiter is
  assigned the place of judge in the galaxy of the stars. Wherefore I say to
  you, that the thing is well thought of, in so long as you permit Jupiter to
  select the man in order that the one who assumes this role may be one in whom
  we may place an implicit trust."</p>

  <p>I glanced at him, and found once more in his eyes those tiny points of
  fire; they were like the germs of a purpose, ready to burst into concrete
  action. It came to me that already that action was taking shape, that this
  plan Bo-Peep had suggested was one Dual was adapting to his ends, that in it
  he was even now making a move.</p>

  <p>"You know of someone?" I Moira Mason cried. Suddenly she was radiant, a
  quiver with the carrying out of her suggestion, fired by the determination to
  put it into force.</p>

  <p>"There is a man in my mind," Semi told her. "Fret not concerning the man,
  my child. Thy part must be to gain the consent of those who at present
  control the body and mind of the man you love. Wherefore to the end we seek
  let me suggest that you take our mutual friend, Marya Harding, who is well
  know to the city's social life, and that, with her, you wait upon your
  lover's foster brother, George Lamb, and explain what you propose.</p>

  <p>"It is not beyond precedent even in a private institution that a private
  attendant be provided for a case. You, with Marya to aid you, will insist
  upon your wish. Say to him that you will provide the man, and remunerate him
  out of your own purse."</p>

  <p>"You think he may refuse?" Some of the light went our of Bo-Peep's
  face.</p>

  <p>"He will not refuse Venus, with a friend with her." Again Semi smiled.</p>

  <p>And suddenly I laughed. The thing was&mdash;well&mdash;Dualesque. It was
  the way in which he so often worked. It carried in it the elements of a
  subtle finesse. But that was not what excited my laughter.</p>

  <p>That was induced by my thought of George Lamb faced by the two women, even
  should he object to what they had come to propose. Of course that he would
  object was by no means certain. He might throw himself into cooperation with
  them if in so doing he thought he would assist that recovery of his brother,
  which last night Dr. Drake had so positively asserted was a thing practically
  assured.</p>

  <p>But if he did not, if for any reason he was unfavorable to the project, I
  could picture him battling against it and being beaten, harried into consent
  by Marya Harding and Bo-Peep. Dual had spoken truly when he said women were
  hard to refuse; he was a keen psychologist.</p>

  <p>"You're delicious." Moira Mason's red lips quirked. They were red this
  morning. The light came back to her eyes, flashed, steadied to a firm
  determination. "I'll go get Marya, and we'll drive down and see George, and
  as soon as it's all arranged I'll telephone Mr. Glace and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My man will be in readiness, with a full understanding of his part," said
  Semi Dual.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll go," Moira declared. "And, thank you&mdash;oh, so much. Right
  now I can't tell you what I feel. But some day Imer and I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thou and Imer," Dual repeated. "Go, Venus, in faith and steadfastness of
  purpose, and thou, Friend Glace."</p>

  <p>We went down the path to the stairs. The elevator cage came up, and we
  entered, and I bade her good morning at the seventh floor.</p>

  <p>Bryce came in the minute I was in my room. "Hello," he said. "Where you
  been? Bo-Peep was here awhile ago with somethin' on her mind, and I phoned
  up, an' Henri told me to let her come through. She's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She's on her way to see George with Marya Harding," I informed him, and
  went on and put him in touch with what had just occurred as well as what I
  had done myself, the night before.</p>

  <p>"And she's goin' down to interview George now?" he said when I was
  through. "Trapped kitten, I'd like to listen in on that interview. I'll bet
  they warp his shingle before they're through. Dual's right as rain. What
  could any guy in George's place hope to do but kick in when he was Pie-faced
  up by a coupla swell Janes?</p>

  <p>"Just the same, Imer's sweet Patootie seems to be one of his pet peeves,
  an' I bet their buttin' in there with this private attendant proposition is
  as welcome to him as bad news from home. Even at that he can't be sure what
  Semi's doin' to him. It's natural; but it's slick."</p>

  <p>"Just what do you think Semi's doing to him?" I asked as much to see what
  he'd say as anything else.</p>

  <p>"Huh? Look alive, the undertaker's comin'." He grinned in my face. "You
  know as well as I do that Dual's gettin' his own man into that place. That's
  why he insisted on pickin' Imer's he-nurse himself. Nurse, my eye! Lamb needs
  nursin' the same way a millionaire needs free soup. Semi sees the chance to
  annex an extra pair of eyes an' ears, an' he ain't passin' it up.</p>

  <p>"It's tough on George, but once those two women get into his office be
  can't do less than accept, without showing a lack of a proper brotherly
  interest in Imer, whether he likes it or not. It's a squeeze play, son,
  that's what it is." He chuckled.</p>

  <p>His bearing was one of elation, if not actual eagerness. My account of
  this latest development seemed to have filled him with an anticipation of
  other impending events. And I had to admit that his deductions seemed
  logically correct.</p>

  <p>"Granting all that," I said, "it would appear that, despite the flivver of
  your investigations of Acme Film, you are still unconvinced that George
  really feels what you call a brotherly interest."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he feels an interest all right," Jim protested. "I said 'proper'
  interest. Cain felt an interest in Abel when he hit him with a rock or
  whatever he is supposed to have used."</p>

  <p>"Still," I rejoined, "we must not forget that last night when I visited
  Drake the man showed an unexpected frankness in discussing Imer's case, or
  that, according to his story, George apparently took the step calculated to
  react to his brother's best advantage, on professional advice."</p>

  <p>Jim frowned as he weighed my words.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," he assented, pursing his mustache. "Naturally his bein' so
  dead sure that Imer was goin' to recover was surprisin', but who in Hades is
  Drake?"</p>

  <p>"He's seemingly an enthusiast in his particular line of practice," I
  returned. "He's a graduate of Waburn College, in Missouri."</p>

  <p>"From Missouri, eh? Well, so's a mule," said Bryce. "But that ain't the
  point. The question is whether Drake knows as much as he'd like folks to
  believe&mdash;as much as he says. Is he the real goods, or just a plausible
  grafter makin' his way out of the misfortunes of other folks?"</p>

  <p>"Your idea being that he persuaded George to let him handle his brother's
  case, intending to stall it along with fictitious hopes of a recovery as long
  as it paid," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what my idea is." Jim scowled. "All I know is that I'm dead
  sure there's something hidden somewhere in this business, an' that Semi knows
  it an' is fixin' to dig it out. There's a frame-up in it somewhere,
  m'son."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a frame-up?" I asked. Jim always thought best when he talked
  out loud.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, of course," he grunted. "If I did I wouldn't be sitting
  here, engagin' in a hemorrhage of words. But, well, did you ever see this
  here play, Blossom Time? There's a character in that who thinks everything he
  sees or hears is suspicious. An' I'm in a good deal the same frame of mind
  myself. What sent Imer off his head? Maybe his goin' balmy, as Kingsley calls
  it, ain't no more than incidental. There's a lot more than his sanity could
  be mixed up in this."</p>

  <p>"You mean money?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Money is a mighty potent word," he declared. "But I ain't sayin' it's the
  one to use. I'm talkin' plenty, but not sayin' much. I guess what I'm doin'
  really is just followin' the play of Jupiter and Venus. After all, I'm
  nuthin' but one of them satellites."</p>

  <p>"And the tail doesn't wag the dog," I observed.</p>

  <p>"Not customarily," said Bryce. "A ship an' pushcart are two of the few
  things I know of that steer from behind. Not that the dog needs wagging in
  the present instance. What I'm grouchin' about is this sittin' around waiting
  to be wagged. Even if I'm nuthin' but a satellite, I'd like a chance to
  satellite."</p>

  <p>I nodded. I could understand. His attitude was characteristic. He was
  happy when at work, but idle, waiting for the time to get into action, he was
  restless and chafed. I felt a good deal the same as he myself. "Well, at
  least, Dual made what it seems we both feel is apt to prove an important step
  this morning."</p>

  <p>"Yep." Bryce got up. "An' I reckon the thing for us to do, is to wait till
  he decides to use his satellite instead of his main planet." He took himself
  off, leaving a blue trail of smoke.</p>

  <p>I turned to my desk and tried to fix my attention on my mail, as yet
  unopened, and on routine work. That kept me fairly well occupied till nearly
  noon. But just before twelve my telephone rang, and I drew it to me and found
  myself listening to Moira Mason's voice:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Glace? Oh, Mr. Glace, will you please take the trouble of letting Mr.
  Dual know that it's all fixed? You know I told him I'd telephone you after
  we'd seen Mr. George Lamb. Mr. Lamb wasn't in favor of my plan at all at
  first, but Marya and I persuaded him before we left; and he promised to
  telephone Dr. Drake. You'll let Mr. Dual know?"</p>

  <p>"I will, and at once, Miss Mason," I replied.</p>

  <p>"You're awfully kind-"</p>

  <p>"Not at all."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. Good-by." I heard her hang up.</p>

  <p>I rose and turned to the other telephone on the wall, and waited until I
  heard Semi's voice.</p>

  <p>I told him what Bo-Peep had said, and waited again through what seemed a
  long minute before he made response.</p>

  <p>"Very well. Henri is out somewhere purchasing a nurse's outfit at present.
  I shall dispatch him as soon as he returns. In the meantime telephone George
  Lamb's office, and learn if he is in. If not, inquire if they know where he
  has gone&mdash;but give no name. If they know of his whereabouts, learn it.
  If he has gone to Drake's place, well and good. If they say they do not know,
  call the sanatorium and ask for him; but if he answers, do not converse with
  him. That is all. And please attend to it at once."</p>

  <p>I called Lamb's office. He was gone, and had left no word. I broke the
  connection, and asked for Drake's Sanatorium.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Drake?" I questioned, being answered by a masculine voice. And being
  assured of his identity, went on: "I'm trying to locate Mr. George Lamb. Is
  he there?"</p>

  <p>"Just a moment," Drake said. "Hold the wire." And then: "Someone for
  you."</p>

  <p>There was a pause and then: "Yes, yes, this is Lamb," came in different
  tones to my ear.</p>

  <p>But I did not answer. Instead I slipped the receiver onto the hook,
  knowing that central would tell him merely that whoever had called him had
  left the line.</p>

  <p>And then I went in search of Jim. My head was filled with a hundred
  conjectures. Henri, Semi's own man, was going into the House of Invisible
  Bondage as Imer Lamb's attendant. Dual could trust him absolutely. He would
  follow to the letter whatever instructions he should give. Filled with such
  thoughts I suddenly burst in on Bryce.</p>

  <p>"Jim," I demanded, "who do you suppose Dual is sending over to Drake's as
  Lamb's attendant? It's Henri. He told me so in a conversation over the phone
  just now."</p>

  <p>"That settles it!" said Jim. "If he's sending Henri over there he's
  convinced of just one thing, and that is that there's something crooked about
  Drake's place!" he roared. "At that rate I reckon we can look for things to
  start popping before long."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; INVISIBLE THREADS</h2>

  <p class="first">"I THINK so, too, Jim," I agreed, and sat down.
  "Furthermore&mdash;" I went on and told him about trying to locate George
  Lamb, and the result.</p>

  <p>He heard me, and an expression of grim satisfaction woke on his face. "He
  did not telephone," he said, scanning the words as though to give them added
  force. "He went over there instead. And Semi thought he might, and wanted to
  prove it. You've let him know he was right?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet. I came in here first. But I will now," I told him, and stood
  up.</p>

  <p>I went back to my own room and used the little phone on the wall.</p>

  <p>Dual accepted my report without comment, and I sat down and stared blankly
  out of a window for some time. Like Bryce, I had come where I expected
  important developments.</p>

  <p>But they didn't come. One day followed another after that till the sum of
  them reached a week. And nothing happened. Bryce speculated and fumed.
  Mentally I felt baffled, confused. Semi did not call upon us, and gave no
  sign of any further move.</p>

  <p>After the day on which Henri entered the house of invisible bondage as
  Imer Lamb's attendant apparently all activities ceased. It was as though the
  entire episode had never been.</p>

  <p>And then quite by accident I encountered Moira Mason on the street. She
  was coming out of a fashionable shop, and we met face to face. Naturally
  enough I asked for any news of Lamb.</p>

  <p>"He's better, much better, Mr. Glace. At least so Dr. Drake says.
  But&mdash;" The flash of her eyes that accompanied the words died out. "I
  haven't seen him. The doctor thinks I'd better not. In fact, he thinks I
  shouldn't even see him for a time after he is discharged, as he says he
  thinks he will be inside a few weeks. So I'm going away, I think."</p>

  <p>"You've told Dual about that?" I questioned quickly, more than a little
  surprised at her words, though of course I could see that perhaps Drake was
  right in seeking to remove any and all influences by which the nervous system
  of his patient might be disturbed.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," she said. "But I will, of course. I wouldn't think of doing
  anything right now without asking his advice. But I want to do whatever is
  best for Imer. Will you arrange an interview with Mr. Dual for me, Mr. Glace,
  and let me know?"</p>

  <p>I promised, bade her good-by, went on to the office, and called Dual and
  told him what she had said.</p>

  <p>"This evening or in the morning," he assented. "And say to her further to
  come to me in the future as she needs."</p>

  <p>I hung up, called the Mason home, and gave her the message, and hung up
  again with her soft-voiced thanks an echo in my ears. And despite it I
  frowned. In a way it was like putting up a set of bars. Dual's final words,
  giving her entree to him without my intervention, some way impressed me in
  that fashion. Even in that it seemed to me that Bryce and I were shut out. I
  sat nursing that thought for possibly five minutes before I turned again to
  the telephone on the wall.</p>

  <p>Moira had said she would visit Semi in the morning. I gave him her answer,
  and again went back to my desk. That single intermediary action had been my
  only participation in the matter in a week, and even so, I did not know the
  result until, some four days later, when Bryce, to whom I had mentioned the
  incident, came into my room one morning with the announcement:</p>

  <p>"Well, I see Venus has beat it to the Coast&mdash;San Francisco, San
  Diego, Los Angeles. I see it in the paper, though as a rule I don't read th'
  society notes."</p>

  <p>"So Semi let her go," I made comment, smiling, since, as it seemed to me,
  Bryce must have felt about the same way I did, if he had been following the
  doings of the social world.</p>

  <p>"At least he didn't stop her," he grumbled. "See here, son&mdash;let's go
  up there. This job of bein' a satellite is gettin' on my nerves. Of course I
  don't know much about astronomy&mdash;the orbit of Jupiter, for
  instance&mdash;but it's takin' a darned long time to get anywhere. If this is
  a taste of satelliting, believe me, m'son, I'd rather be a nurse."</p>

  <p>I smiled again. I knew as well as he did that he was thinking of Henri,
  the man Dual had thrust into the house of invisible bondage. And then I stood
  up. After all, Dual was our friend, and at least it could do no harm to see
  him.</p>

  <p>"All right, Jim," I assented. "Let's go."</p>

  <p>We made our way to the roof.</p>

  <p>Dual was in his garden, working among his roses with a pair of gloves and
  pruning-shears. He straightened from his task and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, my friends," he said. "You have shown patience. And patience is
  a virtue it is well to cultivate. Speaking of cultivation, you find me at a
  homely task. Yet a rose is like mankind, in a way. That which grows awry must
  be lopped off."</p>

  <p>"The evildoer," I said, thinking I sensed a cryptic quality in his closing
  words.</p>

  <p>"The evildoer-the crooked branch." He nodded slightly, drew off his
  gloves, and walked to the bench beside the little fountain. "Sit down, my
  friends. You come as seekers after knowledge. Yet knowledge, like the
  full-blown beauty of a rose, is a thing of growth. And growth is a building
  of cell on cell until the finished structure is complete."</p>

  <p>"Meanin' you don't know?" Bryce challenged directly, as was his
  fashion.</p>

  <p>"Nay." Dual smiled. "Or not in a completeness sufficient to enable me to
  say to the world of man this is this, and this is this&mdash;to furnish that
  concrete evidence of my knowledge which modern man demands."</p>

  <p>It was his way. With all his occult methods of arriving at an
  understanding of a problem, Dual was yet a practical man. Before this he had
  said to me: "Material proof for material men." And I understood.</p>

  <p>But as he paused Bryce put all his bafflement, all his rebellion against
  the blind progress of the matter thus far, into two words:</p>

  <p>"Henri&mdash;Bo-Peep?"</p>

  <p>"Henri?" Once more Semi smiled. "Henri, friend Bryce, is gathering straws,
  as a miser, piece by piece, gathers and hoards his gold."</p>

  <p>"Straws? What do you mean&mdash;straws?" Jim repeated.</p>

  <p>"Straws, yes," Dual returned. "For a straw bending before a wind may point
  the direction of a storm to follow, and a happening in the course of a human
  affair, though seemingly no more than a straw itself in importance, may
  portend the bursting of a storm of wrath."</p>

  <p>"Wrath?" Bryce pounced on the word like a hungry dog on a bone.</p>

  <p>"Wrath," Dual assented. "For he who sows the wind, my friends, shall reap
  the whirlwind when the time of the harvest is ready, and the measure of his
  ill deeds runneth over, and the fit grain is winnowed from the chaff."</p>

  <p>"Which I ain't denyin' is sound doctrine," Bryce agreed. "But referrin' to
  these straws Henri has been collectin', is there any of them that would tend
  to show when this here now storm is due to break?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet," Dual said. "But a man's acts may be turned against him, become
  as stumbling blocks to his feet. And how much more may we not look for a man
  to stumble who walks blindly, jostling his fellow, trampling upon his rights,
  along the path of life?"</p>

  <p>"Which bein' interpreted might mean that a guy of that sort was apt not
  only to stumble, but get shoved?" Jim chuckled.</p>

  <p>Dual's lips twitched. "Even so, since he it is who jostles his fellows,
  tramples over or upon them, is it not still his own act which
  invariably&mdash;finally&mdash;brings about his stumble?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, sure." Bryce nodded. "I get the point. An' referrin' again to Henri
  an' his gatherin' of straws, I'm hopin' it won't be long till he finds one
  heavy enough to bust some camel's back. So now that we've disposed of him,
  what do you know about Bo-Peep?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Mason?" said Semi Dual. "There was nothing for her to do here. Here,
  like ourselves, she could but wait until straw by straw the burden of evil
  deeds had reached a breaking point.</p>

  <p>"Hence, since there was naught for her to accomplish here at present, I
  added my advice to that of Dr. Drake's, that she absent herself, by a
  journey, and recommended our Western coast."</p>

  <p>"Until after Lamb's turned out of this joint?" Jim demanded.</p>

  <p>"Until such time as she is ready to return," Dual replied.</p>

  <p>Jim frowned.</p>

  <p>"An', say, now, that's funny," he said. "Of course, I don't know anything
  about Lamb, or medicine, either. Drake may think it's the best thing for him
  not to see her when he gets out. But if I was in Imer's fix, an' had been
  engaged to a girl, I'd think it a rather peculiar thing for her to take a
  trip just about the time I was likely to be turned loose. I reckon I'd be apt
  to, ask myself if she considered me as a bit too badly damaged to be eligible
  as a husband, or what."</p>

  <p>"As well you might," Dual returned in agreement.</p>

  <p>Suddenly his gray eyes turned from Jim to me, seeming to scan our faces in
  turn, to ask our understanding, that patience he had said was a virtue to
  cultivate by each and all.</p>

  <p>"My friends," he said. "It is true that a man may read a thing after his
  own fashion, may know a thing in his own soul. Yet wherein shall it profit
  him in the eyes of other men if he have not the proof in hand to convince
  them of its truth? Wherefore, until such time as such proof is given to him,
  must he abide himself in so far as he may in peace, and even in such abiding
  be must work. Yet in no sense must he be precipitate in thought, or deed, or
  speech.</p>

  <p>"Wherefore, my friends, what can I say to you, save to wait a little
  longer, as you have waited thus long, till the course of this further bit of
  man's folly, man's blindness, man's futile attempt to ignore the law, shall
  be run."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well&mdash;lookin' at it that way, why, of course," Bryce said all at
  once. He breathed deeply in the way of one who surrenders, and stood up. "I
  ain't denyin' I'm puzzled. But if there ain't nothin' to do but wait, we'll
  wait. Only I'm hopin' that when the right time shows on that clock of fate
  you're watchin', we'll get a chance to shine in a sort of reflected
  glory&mdash;which from what I know about it is the way a satellite ought to
  shine." At the last he grinned. "Come along, Gordon, let's go downstairs and
  resume this waiting game."</p>

  <p>Dual spoke again: "It is a wearing service at times. Yet I am doing a
  little more myself. As friend Bryce puts it, I am watching the Clock in the
  Skies."</p>

  <p>"Just the same," Jim declared once we were back in the office, "I can't
  seem to quite get hold of Drake's idea in wantn' to get Bo-Peep out of town.
  Even if I was crazy, which I ain't, or had been, an' had been in a foolish
  house, it still strikes me that I wouldn't take kindly to the fact of her
  bein' off on a pleasure journey, what time I got out. I'd sort of feel she
  ought to be stickin' around.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I'm old-fashioned&mdash;got old-fashioned ideas about female
  faithfulness. But I'd sort of want her present&mdash;sort of feel we ought to
  celebrate th' thing together. Of course, Drake may think it better for Imer.
  I don't say he don't. But still I can't see where seein' her, playin' around
  with her could be any worse for him than gettin' out an' findin' her gone. Do
  you know what I'd do if I was in his shoes?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly," I told him. "What?"</p>

  <p>"I'd wait till she got home, an' then I'd go see her an' tell her maybe
  we'd better call all bets off, that the way it looked to be, her beatin' it
  just before she knew I was goin' to be sprung was a sort of tacit hint that
  she agreed with me&mdash;that a girl was foolish to book up with a bird who
  had a weak spot in his dome. Dual himself admitted that wasn't exactly
  foolish. And&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And at the same time he told you that he had given her the same advice as
  Drake," I interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes." He frowned. "An' it's the last thing I'd have expected him to
  have said. He says I'm right in feelin' my way about it, an' then says he
  advised her to do the very thing that would make me feel like that. It ain't
  like him, even though he does have that darned habit of his of sayin' two
  things at once. Still it might be that.</p>

  <p>"Maybe he actually told us something we weren't bright enough to get. Oh,
  Pip! I reckon the only thing we can do is to take his advice ourselves and
  wait."</p>

  <p>I nodded. "At last you've reached a logical conclusion," I remarked. "The
  only thing a man can do is to do what he can, as long as he can't do much of
  anything else."</p>

  <p>"Here! Here! Don't you start usin' reverse English," he grinned. He got up
  and strolled out, leaving me to take up on our renewed waiting alone.</p>

  <p>But not for long as it turned out, since though neither Jim nor I knew it
  then, Dual's assertion that the Clock of the Skies was turning was to receive
  confirmation sooner than either of us expected after our conversation with
  him.</p>

  <p>The morning ran away. Bryce and I went out for lunch, and returned. It was
  mid afternoon. And suddenly Bryce came charging into my room along that
  little corridor that led from his private office to mine.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Grab your hat!" he half spoke, half shouted. "Johnson just
  telephoned. Hell's broke loose at Monk's Hall again. That valet of Lamb's has
  gone off his dip or somethin', an' mixed it with Doc Drake. Johnson's goin'
  over there, an' he says we better grab a taxi an' follow him on the
  jump!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE SCENE OF THE ATTACK</h2>

  <p class="first">I SPRANG up, reaching for my hat almost before I gained my
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Kingsley! Drake!" I gasped.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Come on!" Jim Bryce urged once more, getting into motion.</p>

  <p>I followed. We charged through the outer office, and out to the bank of
  elevator cages. Jim jabbed a button savagely. His cigar was clamped fast
  between his teeth. He was scowling as we waited for a down dropping cage.</p>

  <p>Soon we were down, hurrying to the street. There was a taxi stand half a
  block up. We hurried toward it, found a disengaged machine and threw
  ourselves into it, calling our directions to the driver, demanding haste.</p>

  <p>Then as the taxi shot away from the stand, I sank back on the
  cushions.</p>

  <p>"That's all Johnson told you?" I said.</p>

  <p>Jim nodded. "Yes. He didn't have time for more, I guess. Decent of him to
  think of callin' me at all."</p>

  <p>The taxi was fighting its way through the afternoon traffic. At last it
  emerged from the more congested streets. Its speed quickened and swept us off
  and out toward the destination our every nerve was straining to reach.</p>

  <p>"Funny," I said for lack of any better comment.</p>

  <p>"Yeah," Bryce agreed.</p>

  <p>The cab slued around a corner, ran for a block, drew into the curb, and
  stopped! We leaped out. The marble and terra cotta entrance of Monk's Hall
  was before us. We made our way inside.</p>

  <p>The attendant on the desk marked our coming with a watchful eye.</p>

  <p>"We're to meet Inspector Johnson here," I said quickly.</p>

  <p>He nodded. "Lamb's suite. The boy will show you." He nodded again, this
  time in the direction of the elevator grille.</p>

  <p>We went up. The door of Imer Lamb's suite stood open as we paused outside
  it. I marked the broad-shouldered bulk of Johnson through it, and went toward
  him.</p>

  <p>He turned at the sound of our steps.</p>

  <p>"Oh, hello, boys," he said. "Come in. Coupla friends of mine, doctor."</p>

  <p>"I have met Mr. Glace before," Drake acknowledged. He sat on a chair,
  holding a wadded-up handkerchief to his cheek. As he spoke he removed it, and
  disclosed the reddened lines of what seemed newly acquired scratches.</p>

  <p>So much I saw as I nodded to him, and noted Joe Kingsley stretched out on
  a couch on the other side of the room with two uniformed members of the
  police force seemingly on guard.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Drake's been tryin' to tell me," Johnson returned. "I just beat you by a
  scratch. Accordin' to him, he came up here to see Kingsley, an' the bird
  attacked him. Go on an' finish your story, doc."</p>

  <p>Drake smiled rather grimly. "Perhaps I'd better begin it again, for the
  benefit of Mr. Glace and his companion, who, I assume, may be Mr. Bryce," he
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"Sure," Johnson assented. "Wait till we sit down." He found himself a
  seat, and Jim and I followed suit. "All right. Go ahead, doc."</p>

  <p>"As I told you before," Drake began, "I came up here to see Kingsley, who
  is Mr. Imer Lamb, my present patient's man, and the one whom when he became
  mentally deranged, Mr. Lamb attacked. For reasons of a purely professional
  nature, I felt that it would not be well to have Kingsley continue on in the
  same capacity after Mr. Lamb was released. He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's goin' to be released?" Johnson interrupted in a tone of what I
  thought was surprise. Furthermore, I caught his eye, and fancied that it was
  turned toward me to mark the effect of Drake's announcement.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Drake declared. "Mr. Lamb's improvement since he has been in my
  hands has been consistently toward recovery, as I felt assured it would be at
  the time I took him in charge."</p>

  <p>"You mean he's gettin' well?" This time there could be no doubt that the
  announcement was totally unexpected on Johnson's part. Simpson had taken the
  opposite stand, and the inspector fairly snapped the question.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes." Once more Drake smiled. His glance swung to me briefly. "Mr.
  Glace will tell you that I predicted that the evening of the day after his
  brother, Mr. George Lamb, brought him to my house. His affliction was of a
  temporary rather than a permanent type. I expect to release him inside ten
  days&mdash;possibly sooner."</p>

  <p>"You think that safe?" Johnson frowned.</p>

  <p>"If I did not I would not do it&mdash;of course," said Drake. "Of course,
  such a thing as a relapse might occur. That brings me back to my story,
  inspector. I felt it best that Kingsley should not continue as his valet for
  that very reason. He had attacked him once, and well&mdash;you can see
  yourself&mdash;there would always be the influence of that, the thought." He
  spread his slim hands in a gesture.</p>

  <p>"So I decided to explain it to the fellow. I stopped, came up, and rang.
  He admitted me himself. I explained my errand to him, and sought to make
  plain the advisability of the step. But he took it badly, in a sullen sort of
  way might describe it best. He said little, just nodded now and then, and
  mumbled until right at the last when he asked a question; 'You're goin' to
  run me away, are you? You're goin' to run me away?' he said.</p>

  <p>"And when I assured him that I felt sure it would be best, he attacked me.
  It was so sudden that he took me off my guard. He threw himself on me, but I
  managed to tear loose and thrust him from me, and you know perhaps that he's
  more or less a cripple. As I thrust him back he stumbled and went down and
  struck his head, knocking himself unconscious against the legs of that table
  there&mdash;" He pointed to the bit of furniture in question, a heavy carved
  table on which were some books, and magazines, and an ornamental tobacco
  jar.</p>

  <p>"Was he injured?" I interjected.</p>

  <p>"Nope, I don't think so, though we'll have him looked over," Johnson
  answered, "He's breathin' all right, though he ain't come out of it yet. I
  telephoned for an ambulance before you showed up. Doc here says he'll be all
  right."</p>

  <p>"He is probably suffering from a slight brain concussion," Drake
  explained. "He struck rather hard. Possibly I used more than sufficient
  force. But a man attacked, gentlemen&mdash;one thinks of self-preservation
  first."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't apologize, doc," Johnson grinned. "I reckon we, any of us,
  would have done the same if somebody hopped us like that. As it is, he left a
  few signs of his good intentions on your face. Well fix him up. Th' question
  is whether you're goin' any further with it?"</p>

  <p>"Preferring a complaint you mean?" Again Drake smiled. "Oh, no. I'd prefer
  to consider the incident closed so far as my side of it is concerned. But the
  man must have what attention he needs, of course."</p>

  <p>"An' he'll get it," Johnson said.</p>

  <p>A telephone on a stand on the far side of the room began to buzz.</p>

  <p>"Answer that, will you, Jake."</p>

  <p>The latter complied. "The ambulance, inspector," he announced a moment
  later.</p>

  <p>Johnson nodded. "Thought so; tell 'em to bring a stretcher."</p>

  <p>The officer did as he was instructed, and hung up.</p>

  <p>Johnson rose. "Well, then, that's all there is to it, I guess," he said.
  "I'll have him carted over to the hospital, an' put to bed. How did he act
  when he let you in today, doc&mdash;any different from usual?"</p>

  <p>"Why, it's hard to say." Drake appeared to weigh his words. "I'm not
  acquainted with the fellow, you know. But as I told you, he appeared sullen,
  morose; and then, of course, at the last like a man violently enraged."</p>

  <p>Johnson nodded. "Still, you wouldn't say he acted as though he'd gone
  foolish, too, would you?"</p>

  <p>"Insane, do you mean?" Drake queried quickly. "Well, inspector, his attack
  partook something of the nature of an acute emotional insanity, of course.
  But I fancy that after he recovers from the bump on his head, you'll find
  he'll be perfectly sane within a short time."</p>

  <p>"Brainstorm induced by his thinkn' you was takin' his job away, eh?"
  Johnson suggested.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Drake agreed. "You know the man is a war victim, crippled by
  his wounds. Sometimes, inspector, a physical injury, a wracking experience,
  warps a man's entire nature, and brings about an unstable nerve balance. Our
  shell-shock cases are instances of that."</p>

  <p>"Sure," Johnson accepted. "Come in, boys," he called to the ambulance
  attendants who paused outside the door of the suite.</p>

  <p>They entered with their stretcher; Joe Kingsley was lifted upon it, and
  carried out. He moaned slightly as he was moved, and opened his lids for a
  single instant, only to drop them the next.</p>

  <p>"Coming out, now, inspector," Drake remarked.</p>

  <p>I crossed to stand beside him. "Lamb is nearly recovered then, Dr. Drake?"
  I asked.</p>

  <p>"Remarkably improved, Mr. Glace," he replied.</p>

  <p>"That night I called at your place you prophesied that he would return to
  a 'practical normal,'" I continued. "Does that mean that his recovery is
  likely to prove&mdash;shall we say&mdash;an unstable thing, Dr. Drake?"</p>

  <p>And again, as when speaking to Johnson, he spread his hands. "I'm not an
  infallible prophet, Mr. Glace," he returned. "Lamb is practically normal now.
  Yet it is presumable that should the same conditions as those which first
  produced his trouble pertain, they might induce the same thing. We can only
  hope that such conditions will not again occur. If they should not, I feel
  sure that Mr. Lamb will continue sane. But you can perhaps see the
  application in that of my determination to see that Kingsley did not stay on
  as his man, to act as a constant reminder."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," I said, "I see your point." It was plausible enough. To a
  physician the end result of his treatment is the main thing. An apparent
  cure, or even an improvement which does not endure is neither a credit nor a
  satisfaction to men of the medical profession.</p>

  <p>"As I see." Drake turned to Johnson. "That's all then, inspector? I may be
  getting on?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, sure," Johnson assented. The men with Kingsley had gone. "I'll have
  'em lock up these rooms till they get word what to do with them."</p>

  <p>"Tell them to call Mr. George Lamb, my patient's brother, you know," Drake
  offered. "Or I will do it, if you like."</p>

  <p>"Sure. Go ahead," Johnson agreed.</p>

  <p>"Then, good morning&mdash;good morning, Mr. Glace." Drake left the
  suite.</p>

  <p>Johnson eyed his retreating back. "Lamb out of his mind, an' then this
  bird Kingsley out of his. Funny," he voiced a half thought.</p>

  <p>"Their both goin' off their heads in this dump?" Jim caught up what seemed
  his thread of meaning.</p>

  <p>"Yes. That is, if Kingsley is off his head," Johnson said slowly. "I'm
  goin' to have Simpson look him over. It can't do any harm. An' I'm goin' down
  an' see if any of the folks around here have noticed anything about him to
  make 'em think he might be workin' a screw loose the last few days."</p>

  <p>"Good thought. Let's hop to it," Bryce urged. His lids were tense at the
  corners. There was a speculative expression on his face.</p>

  <p>We descended to the ground floor, and Johnson questioned the youth on the
  desk; and the elevator attendant, as two of the operating staff as likely as
  any others to have noticed anything out of the way in Kingsley's bearing
  during the past week.</p>

  <p>Both agreed that the valet had kept largely to himself, spending most of
  his time in Lamb's suite, that he had been very quiet in his bearing,
  speaking seldom to any one unless addressed.</p>

  <p>"Looked like he was takin' Lamb's blow-up pretty hard," the deskman said.
  "He sure was overboard about Lamb. But then, Lamb was pretty good to him, I
  guess. 'Bout all he's done for days has been mope about his rooms, except
  when he went out with a bag or something he was takin' over to this place of
  Drake's."</p>

  <p>"Broodin'," Johnson summed it up after we had walked out to where our taxi
  and a police car waited at the curb. "Broodin' over Lamb, an' waitin' for him
  to get out. Then Drake comes here with his plan for puttin' the skids under
  him, an' he blows up."</p>

  <p>"Maybe," Jim half-assented. There was still that look of consideration on
  his face.</p>

  <p>"Well, I got to be goin'," Johnson said. "I'll let you know what Simpson
  thinks after he's had a look at this baby."</p>

  <p>"Do," I accepted. "It was good of you to call us. Let us know, too, if
  Kingsley says anything himself after he wakes up."</p>

  <p>We watched him drive off, and entered our own cab. It got under motion,
  turned, and headed back for the Urania before Jim spoke. Then it was to ask a
  hypothetical question that he finally used his voice:</p>

  <p>"Drake goes up there to tell Kingsley he's goin' to be fired, an' Kingsley
  jumps him. That's the meat of the story. An' it may be all the meat at that.
  I'm not sayin' it's not. But here's this: if Drake wanted to wise Kingsley up
  to the fact that he thought it best for him to clear out after Lamb was well
  enough to be released, why couldn't he have done it almost any day when
  Kingsley went over there with things for Imer, instead of comin' down to
  Monk's Hall on a special trip."</p>

  <p>"Why, indeed," I asked myself. When Drake had told his story it had seemed
  consistent enough. And yet if there was a weak spot in its structure it
  appeared to me that Bryce had ferreted it out. It hinted at some unexpressed
  motive other than merely to tell a man that he soon would be out of a job,
  some other angle in the matter which might have been the real cause of
  Kingsley's attack. It hinted that Drake's story might be true as far as it
  went, which was only far enough to cover half the truth.</p>

  <p>"Correct, Jim," I made response. "Why did he need to slip the information
  to Kingsley behind closed doors? Telling Kingsley that he wouldn't be needed
  after Imer was discharged may have been part of it all right.</p>

  <p>"But the question is, was anything like that enough to make the man fly at
  his throat&mdash;unless Kingsley was verging toward a mental unbalance
  similar to Lamb's&mdash;and Drake's visit proved a sort of exploding point?
  That's possible perhaps. But it's theory pure and simple; that both Lamb and
  his man should suffer mental breakdowns in the same suite of rooms inside two
  or three weeks is a rather strange coincidence."</p>

  <p>"Meanin' you think Joe is really crazy?" he said frowning.</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily, of course," I replied. "We don't know yet. Drake
  suggests an emotional outburst great enough to rob the man of his sense of
  responsibility for the time being. He may be right. But I'm glad Johnson is
  going to have Simpson examine the man's condition, even if he does seem to
  have missed his bet in Lamb's case."</p>

  <p>Bryce nodded. "Yes, and I'm' glad you told Johnson to let us know anything
  Kingsley says when he snaps out of it. It may prove interesting," he
  said.</p>

  <p>The cab slowed, and stopped in front of the Urania. We got out, paid the
  driver, and turned into the foyer.</p>

  <p>"All the way up?" Bryce questioned.</p>

  <p>"Of course," I agreed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE WEAVER AND THE WEB</h2>

  <p class="first">WE went up. Dual was nowhere in the garden. But the chimes
  rang to announce our coming, and as we gained the door of the tower his voice
  reached us from the farther room:</p>

  <p>"Enter, my friends."</p>

  <p>We followed it to its source, and found him once more seated at his great
  desk, on which was a litter of paper sheets, covered with astrological
  figures and computations. As we came upon him, he lifted his eyes. They swept
  us briefly, marked, no doubt, the expressions of our faces that hinted at the
  story we were bringing, and spoke again:</p>

  <p>"So then, the waiting was not so long as it appeared at the time it was
  advised? Tell me."</p>

  <p>We sat down, and I complied, omitting no detail I could remember of the
  events at Monk's Hall.</p>

  <p>"Simpson will examine the man," he said when I paused.</p>

  <p>"Johnson said he would ask him to do so." I nodded.</p>

  <p>"Which is equivalent to his request being granted," Semi said, and sat
  lost for a moment or two it seemed to me in consideration. "I should like to
  meet this Dr. Simpson, I think," he said again after that. "Whereupon, you my
  friends, shall help me in bringing such a meeting about. You will gain the
  ear of Inspector Johnson, and you shall say to him this:</p>

  <p>"That in discussing this matter, there is one who says that Joseph
  Kingsley, valet to Imer Lamb, is not insane in any ordinary sense, that his
  condition is a temporary matter, a thing of days, no more than that, that
  with attention, and quiet he will very shortly become his normal self; that
  he will make it a point to contrive a discussion of Kingsley's condition with
  Dr. Simpson, and will make this statement to him, will so lead the
  conversation that Simpson may ask who it is that makes so positive a
  statement without personal contact with the patient himself.</p>

  <p>"Physicians, my friends, are sure of their own opinions, and like other
  men, they are curious. Shall Simpson question such a declaration as Inspector
  Johnson asserts has been made, should he question the calling of the man who
  made it, asking whether he be another physician or no, then shall Inspector
  Johnson say that he is a physician indeed, though not engaged in practice;
  that in the present instance he speaks more as a psychologist&mdash;that he
  is a friend&mdash;and interested in both the man Kingsley's recent actions,
  and in Imer Lamb's somewhat parallel case.</p>

  <p>"And he may tell him further whatsoever he deems best concerning myself.
  Should then Simpson express a wish to meet and identify an unknown critic,
  Johnson may perchance arrange an interview between us. Attend to this at
  once."</p>

  <p>He smiled. Back and behind that smile I saw that his gray eyes once more
  held each its tiny point of purposeful fire.</p>

  <p>I rose. "Hearing is obeying," I said in Oriental fashion.</p>

  <p>"Holy smoke!" Bryce erupted, once we were outside. "Curiosity killed a
  cat! Simpson will be curious, eh? Well, I reckon almost anybody would be
  curious if they were handed a line like that. Dual's after a meeting with
  Simpson, but he lets Simpson's curiosity bring it about&mdash;lets it look as
  though he didn't seek it himself. Well, he's a psychologist, all right. But
  what's he up to now? What does he want to get into touch with Simpson for?
  What's he got up his sleeve? He's usin' a hold-out in this game if he ever
  did in his life."</p>

  <p>"At least," I said, "he's using an indirect approach. Perhaps he feels he
  has to. Beyond that, Jim, I don't know, of course. But if Simpson is human
  he's going to ask who had the temerity to make a diagnosis in Kingsley's case
  without having seen his patient. And after that if Johnson has any tact at
  all he can bring the meeting about."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's clever enough," Jim chuckled. "But wait till we give Johnson his
  instructions. Simpson ain't the only bird who is going to be curious."</p>

  <p>Johnson verified the prediction after we had located him at the station,
  and proffered Dual's request. He stared. More than that, he scowled. "What's
  the notion?" he demanded. "What's he up to, boys?"</p>

  <p>"We don't know, as a matter of fact," I confessed.</p>

  <p>"You don't know," Johnson echoed. "Well, I wouldn't wonder if that was the
  truth. That's the way he works. But I don't make it. I don't get this
  business at all. Where's there any grounds for action in this matter? Lamb's
  going to be turned loose in pretty good shape from what Drake says. Kingsley
  will get off with a few days in hospital, unless Simpson thinks he's worse
  than it appears Dual does."</p>

  <p>"Has he seen him yet?" I interrupted.</p>

  <p>"No." He shook his head. "But he will, and when I tell him what you've
  just spilled, he'll go straight up. I know him. He's a touchy lad when it
  comes to anything of that sort. He's going to go to the mat with me about one
  minute after I tell him somebody's been takin' that much interest in a case
  he has anything to do with.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm goin' to do it," he grinned, "an' it won't be any trouble for me
  to lead him up to meetin' the guy who handed out the opinion, I guess. Yep,
  I'm goin' to do it if for no reason on earth but to see what's back of all
  this. Dual's got a reason.</p>

  <p>"I've worked with him enough to know that there's somethin' more'n I can
  see if he pulls a stunt of this sort. Psychologist, eh? Well, he sure called
  the turn on Simpson. You can tell him I'm goin' to the front for him the
  minute I get the chance."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all we was askin'," Bryce told him, and stood up. "I've a
  notion he knew you would. You bein' the Sun&mdash;otherwise the Law in this
  affair&mdash;you've gotta functuate, when the time for your functionating
  arrives. This apparently bein' one of the occasions&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, dry up," Johnson cut him short. "When you talk you sound like a load
  of junk. I'm doin' this because he asks me to."</p>

  <p>"An' because you want to know what it's all about, as you just admitted,"
  Bryce chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, go chase your shadow," Johnson said. But he winked as he caught my
  eye, none the less.</p>

  <p>"Nope," Jim shook his head. He knew Johnson was puzzled by this latest
  move on the part of Semi Dual, but with his interest fully aroused. "I'm just
  goin' back an' wait. You know what Semi is doin' in this thing, old top?" He
  imitated Johnson's voice. "'No,' he said, 'please tell me.' And I answered:
  'Why, Semi's just sayin' to the opposition: 'Take your time; the watch is
  yours.'</p>

  <p>"Or, in other words, he's sittin' pretty an' watchin' the little' stars
  chase themselves. He's like a guy in a blind with a gun, waitin' for th' game
  to walk into range before he shoots.' An' when I said that, he gave me a
  glance of admiration, an' he says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll give you just about two minutes to get out of here, an' go tell Dual
  I'm on the job," Johnson rumbled.</p>

  <p>"That'll be ninety seconds longer than I need. Come along, son." Jim
  turned toward the door.</p>

  <p>Outside he chuckled again. "What'd I tell you? That bird will bring them
  two together now if he has to use force."</p>

  <p>He was in high good humor, and I nodded. "Oh, yes," I agreed. "And after
  that&mdash;well, I suppose Dual might say that the Clock of the Skies had
  marked another hour in this business, Jim. At least, this much is certain. He
  wants to meet Simpson, because he has an idea that there is some way in which
  Simpson may prove of use."</p>

  <p>"I guess even a child could dope that out," he returned, "The question
  that's botherin' me is what way he thinks he can be used."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "you yourself likened his actions to those of a hunter in
  a blind waiting for his game to come into range, and sometimes I understand
  such hunters use beaters to drive their game up in front of the guns."</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Jim paused in his stride. "By golly, son, that's an idea," he
  declared, "but I can't see how it works. I&mdash;excuse me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>We were standing in front of one of the larger shops as it happened, and
  in the midst of the late shopping crowd. As he uttered the last words in a
  half-exclamatory tone, Bryce drew back to avoid the slender, modishly-gowned
  figure of a woman who was making her way toward a town car drawn up beside
  the curb.</p>

  <p>And in the next moment he spoke again: "Miss Norton!"</p>

  <p>"Well?" With her hand on the door of the car, the woman paused, and turned
  halfway as Jim strolled toward her. Her eyes met his without any sign of
  recognition. Her eyelids flickered, her reddened lips set. Her whole bearing
  was what one might have expected it to be in a woman accosted by a total
  stranger on the street.</p>

  <p>And Bryce appeared to understand, because he smiled as he again addressed
  her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't get upstage because I'm speakin' to you without an
  introduction, Nathalie, please. I'm just a private plainclothes dick, and I
  used to be on the force. So it won't get you a thing to make a holler. How's
  George?"</p>

  <p>"George?" she repeated, frowning in a way that knit her delicately plucked
  brows.</p>

  <p>"Sure. George Lamb," Bryce countered. "How'd he take Kingsley's blowin' up
  this afternoon an' tryin' to spoil Doc Drake's beauty."</p>

  <p>"Joe!" Nathalie Norton exclaimed, and caught herself up, biting her lips.
  "See here, what do you mean by stopping me and asking me such
  questions&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Name's Bryce," Jim interrupted. "As to why, I just wanted to see if
  George had told you. Probably will, though, the next time he sees
  you&mdash;tonight or tomorrow. You see, Joe, as you call him, went off his
  dip, a good deal like Imer did."</p>

  <p>"Was&mdash;was Dr. Drake hurt?" Suddenly I saw the girl's hand tighten on
  the handle of the door till the knuckles stretched tight the skin of her
  glove. Under her rouge her face paled a bit.</p>

  <p>"Hurt?" Jim's lids narrowed, though he grinned. "Oh, no. Joe's a cripple.
  All he did was to get home with a few wicked fingernail scratches. Then Drake
  knocked him for a row of soup tureens, an' Joe dented the leg of a table with
  his head. I saw Drake after it was over, an' he went off on his own power,
  all right. I thought George might have slipped you the news."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Abruptly she fought back to her shaken control. "Why are you doing
  this, really, Mr. Bryce? Why should George Lamb have told me anything about
  it? Why do you stop me on the street to ask if he has? By what
  right&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, be yourself, Nathalie." Jim shrugged, and smiled as he looked her in
  the eyes.</p>

  <p>For a moment their glances held, and then Nathalie Norton wrenched open
  the door of her car, and flashed inside. It drew out into the stream of
  traffic, leaving him standing there on the curb.</p>

  <p>"And now what in Heaven's name made you pull that sort of play?" I
  demanded as he turned back.</p>

  <p>"You did, I reckon, m'son," he informed me.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" I said. I didn't comprehend.</p>

  <p>"Sure." He nodded. "What you said about hunters usin' beaters to flush
  their game. She's George's girl, an' she'll tell him about it, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"You know as well as I do, that women like her have expensive tastes.
  Notice how she was dressed, the make of car she drives?" "George makes a lot
  of money, an' he handles Imer's end of the estate. I don't know nuthin', but
  girls like that cost a lot to court; an' George as good as told us Imer knew
  nothin' about the business that day we was down there. George seems to do
  about as he likes. That way the question might be is Imer as well off as he
  thinks&mdash;or thought he was?"</p>

  <p>"Still harping on that string, are you?" I asked.</p>

  <p>And again he nodded. "I'm apt to try harpin' on anything that's got a
  string right at present," he declared.</p>

  <p>"Your idea, then, is that George may have been looting Imer's end of the
  estate?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Well, such things have happened," he scowled. "But my main idea in
  speakin' to Nathalie was that she's close enough to George to tell him, an'
  the more burrs you put under a saddle the more apt a mule is to jump."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I understand that," I assented. "But did you notice the way she acted
  when you mentioned Drake?"</p>

  <p>"Did I?" he rejoined. "I'll say I did. And that's another thing. Why
  should she? Why should the idea that Drake might have got hurt make her turn
  white? I don't know the answer, son, but there is an answer. Which reminds me
  that we've got one for Dual before we can call it a day an' knock off work.
  An' I reckon I've got a confession to make. Let's get along and get it over
  with."</p>

  <p>We turned back into the sidewalk traffic, made our way to the Urania, and
  for the second time that afternoon we ascended to the roof.</p>

  <p>Dual sat as before in the inner room of the tower, still busy with his
  charts.</p>

  <p>We told him the result of our errand; and then Jim described our meeting
  with Miss Morton.</p>

  <p>"This but matches a missing piece of the picture." Semi said at the last.
  "Your impulsive action should do no harm, I think."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm glad it matches." Jim glanced at the symbol-marked sheets of
  paper on the desk. "You've been watchin' that clock you was speakin' about
  this morning?"</p>

  <p>"The Clock of the Skies," Dual returned. "Ah, yes. In a sense I have been
  watching it, friend Bryce, and in another sense I have been weaving a
  web."</p>

  <p>"Web?" Bryce repeated. "What sort of a web?"</p>

  <p>"A web of invisible threads&mdash;selfishness, cupidity, lust, duplicity,
  false pretenses, treachery, callousness, greed&mdash;things that snare the
  feet of man and hold him prisoner to his baser elements, things by which the
  feet of the one who is guilty of them may be snared, when the entangling maze
  of their destroying manifestation shall be thrown about him, and he finds
  himself enmeshed like even to a helpless fly which has blundered blindly into
  a spider's web."</p>

  <p>My mind reached out for his meaning. Days before he had spoken of soul
  elements, naming faith, hope, love. He had spoken, too, of a harvest of wrath
  to be garnered once it had been raised from the seed of men's deeds. He had
  spoken of law and justice, and of a time when what was to be, would be. And
  now he was speaking of a web&mdash;he had said he was weaving it.</p>

  <p>"Semi, you mean that this web is your estimate of this whole affair, the
  elements that have led to it, that point toward its termination, that it is
  such threads as you have named that in the end are going to grip and hold the
  ones who have used them toward the accomplishment of whatever they were
  striving to accomplish fast?"</p>

  <p>"Unless I have woven my web all wrong," he said, and smiled back into my
  questioning eyes. "You are right; that to which I referred as a web is, as
  you put it, my estimate of this matter, its activating elements, its
  foreshadowed termination.</p>

  <p>"Consideration for the rights of others, truthfulness, decency, fair
  dealing, integrity, human kindness&mdash;those things endure, exalt the soul
  of man rather than drag it down. The spider tints its web with iridescence,
  makes of it a tinsel thing to lure its victim. And who would knowingly accept
  tinsel for gold?</p>

  <p>"The true Path of Attainment is not crooked. It does not deviate, or
  twist, or turn. It is a straight and narrow path cut through a morass of
  error. Unhappy is he who steps aside&mdash;in the end. And there are so many,
  so many, who struggle futilely in the mire, caught, tangled in the web of
  their own self-blinded desires."</p>

  <p>It wasn't a pleasant picture he painted in words. I thought of the girl
  Bryce had spoken to this afternoon. She was beautiful in her way, attractive,
  young. But she was caught in a web of tinsel. It glittered&mdash;that web
  that held her, but it was dragging her down.</p>

  <p>Here again I thought was another type of invisible bondage&mdash;wherein
  one was caught and held by a web of invisible threads, a self-made web, woven
  out of the things one had done one's self.</p>

  <p>And Dual in his own peculiar, uncanny fashion, was using those very things
  to confound whoever it was he thought amenable to justice, whoever it was
  against whom he had said the law should take its course in this affair of
  Imer Lamb. Here high up in his tower, he sat and spun his web of invisible
  threads to trap them; or rather he was letting them spin the threads, and
  then gathering them into his strange, capable hands.</p>

  <p>Not as a spider was he spinning. Rather he was Jupiter, the arbiter, the
  judge as he had named himself in the beginning, watching, waiting, marking
  the puppet play of those he watched.</p>

  <p>I stood up. "Well," I said, "Johnson will doubtless let us know when he
  has managed to contrive a meeting with Simpson. When he does, we'll get word
  to you at once."</p>

  <p>"Do so," Semi accepted. "The meeting will be contrived past any doubt.
  When one works with human elements of a known value, one may safely predicate
  results."</p>

  <p>"And that's psychology," Bryce grinned as he rose.</p>

  <p>"A practical application of psychology, friend Bryce," Dual assented. "The
  psychologist, like the chemist who blends two known reagents, may feel fairly
  well assured of how they will react."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; ACTION AT LAST</h2>

  <p class="first">They ran the story of Joe Kingsley's assault on Drake on the
  local page the morning after it had occurred:</p>

  <p>IS MONK'S HALL HAUNTED?</p>

  <p>But outside the suggestion of the caption, they gave it little space,
  beyond what was essential to a narration of the salient facts. Joseph
  Kingsley, valet of Imer Lamb, who some weeks before had been the victim of an
  assault at the hands of his master, had yesterday in a measure duplicated the
  attack on the person of Dr. Drake, head of Drake's Sanatorium, where Lamb was
  now a patient. The attack had occurred in Lamb's suite in the fashionable
  apartment house.</p>

  <p>I read the story, and laid it aside. It gave me the information that
  Simpson had not gone into the matter of Kingsley's mental condition as yet.
  The caption impressed me as being in very bad taste. From what I knew of such
  things, I felt assured that whoever wrote it would have a chance to sweat.
  Monk's Hall would hardly fail to register a protest through its management
  against a thing so apt to attract unfavorable attention, I thought.</p>

  <p>I went to the office, and took up routine work. I had neglected it the day
  before, and it held my attention to the exclusion of pretty much everything
  else, for a couple of hours.</p>

  <p>Then Johnson showed up. "Kingsley woke up this mornin'," he announced.
  "An' outside a sore head he seems pretty much all right."</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute; Jim would rather get this first hand," I requested, and
  punched a buzzer to summon Bryce.</p>

  <p>Johnson waited until Jim appeared, and then resumed.</p>

  <p>"As I told you, Kingsley seems about himself this mornin', except that he
  acts a little dazed, an' swears he don't remember a thing, after Drake told
  him he was goin' to be fired out of a soft job."</p>

  <p>"He remembers that far though, does he?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes." Johnson nodded. "His story and Drake's match pretty much. He
  says the doc came in, and asked him for some tobacco Lamb left there when he
  was carted off to the sanatorium&mdash;an' he gave it to him. Then he says
  Drake told him he wouldn't be needed any longer after Lamb was turned loose.
  After that, though he claims to have lost his memory till he woke up in the
  hospital, an' wanted to know what it was all about. That's Simpson's
  story."</p>

  <p>"You've seen Simpson then?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Seen him! Oh, yes, I've seen him." He grinned. "Him an' me had quite a
  talk. That's what brought me up here this mornin'. I told you he'd want to
  know who in time was buttin' in, an' he did. So I told him what you said
  about Dual's bein' a psychologist, an' knowin' what he was talkin' about.</p>

  <p>"That got his interest, an' I took th' opportunity to elaborate&mdash;told
  him I knew him pretty well an' had worked with him on more than one funny
  case. That cooled him off a bit. An 'now he wants to meet him himself. I put
  it over. Simpson is goin' to give Kingsley the up an' down again this
  afternoon, an' I've got his invitation for Dual to meet him at the station
  and go on to the county hospital at two o'clock."</p>

  <p>"And that's that," said Bryce. "You told him what Semi said about
  Kingsley's not bein' crazy, of course."</p>

  <p>"Of course." Once more Johnson nodded. "That was what blew him up at
  first, an' just about doubled his interest after we had had our talk. You
  better slip Dual the word. I'll be over there an' make the introduction."</p>

  <p>I told him I would see that Semi was informed, and he left. Then I used
  the telephone on the wall, and Dual answered. I told him what Johnson had
  said.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he accepted. "At two o'clock. You will accompany me to the
  station if you can make it convenient, Gordon. Come to me just before
  two."</p>

  <p>I assented, and a little after half past one I made my way to the
  roof.</p>

  <p>Dual awaited me in the garden, but no longer in his white and purple
  robes. Today he had laid them aside for the habiliments of a man of the
  modern world, striped trousers, an English cutaway coat, a silk hat, which to
  my first glance seemed to add to the commanding quality of his figure, itself
  above the average height. Varnished shoes and a slender cane completed his
  costume. All in all his appearance was one to attract the attention of any
  one we met.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, my friend," he said. "It is time that we set out. One should be
  punctual at an appointment." He fell into step beside me, moving toward the
  head of the stairs.</p>

  <p>We went down them, waited for a cage, dropped down to the street, and
  entered a taxi at the stand where Bryce and I had obtained ours the day
  before. We were at the police station within five minutes.</p>

  <p>There Dual and Dr. Simpson met. Johnson engineered the meeting as he had
  said he would. Simpson, as it seemed to me, was the antithesis of
  Dual&mdash;with a rough and ready manner in both speech and dress that but
  accentuated Semi's elegance.</p>

  <p>"Hear you're interested in my cases, Mr. Dual, or should I say, doctor?"
  he said as Dual and he shook hands, and I saw his eyes quickly sweep Semi
  from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"Whichever you prefer, Dr. Simpson," Dual returned. "I am, as it chances,
  either or both. But the title matters little save as a means of address,
  since, after all, our mutual interest is, I think, in the man himself. As to
  your cases, I have ventured to express an opinion in both. My interest,
  however, is humanitarian as well as scientific."</p>

  <p>"Humanitarian?" Simpson repeated. Both Semi's bearing and his manner of
  speaking were impressing him, I thought. "I'm afraid I don't just get you,
  doctor."</p>

  <p>"Humanitarian," said Semi Dual, "in as much as anything which affects the
  welfare or happiness of the individual should excite our interest."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, yes; that, of course," Dr. Simpson assented. He looked at his
  watch. "Well, shall we be going? I want to see this chap and get back."</p>

  <p>"At your pleasure." Semi slightly inclined his silk-hatted head.</p>

  <p>"Then, I've a car outside," Simpson suggested.</p>

  <p>The two men passed out of the detectives' room, where their meeting had
  occurred, and left Johnson and me together. We were not invited to accompany
  them on their visit to Joseph Kingsley. We were simply left. And there was no
  reason really why we should have been asked to go along, but in bringing me
  to the station, and in leaving me there with Johnson after he had arranged
  the meeting, I fancied I saw but another touch of Semi's infinite tact.</p>

  <p>As they disappeared, Johnson threw himself into a chair at his desk, and
  laughed shortly. He drew out a handkerchief, and wiped his face. "And there
  you are," he declared. "He comes down here dressed for an afternoon
  reception, an' as cool as ice, an' I'm sweatin' like a horse. Honestly,
  Glace, I can't ever make him. And I sure can't make him in this.</p>

  <p>"The way he's actin' you'd think he was expectin' to raise merry hell with
  somebody one of these days. An', for the life of me, I can't see why he
  should. Drake says Lamb is pretty near well, an' from all I know, his goin'
  nutty was what started all this fuss. If he gets well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He'll get well," I assured him.</p>

  <p>"Dual tell you?" he countered.</p>

  <p>And I nodded. "Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, then what's all the fuss about?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Johnson," I confessed. "But you know he said justice was
  going to be done, and last night he told Bryce and me that he was weaving a
  web. By that I feel he meant he was gathering evidence."</p>

  <p>"Evidence against whom?" He frowned. "Damn it all, who is it he's after,
  Glace?"</p>

  <p>"If I really knew, I think I'd tell you, Johnson," I rejoined. "But I
  don't. Still, it's my notion that he wanted to meet Simpson, because he
  thinks he can dig up something he's after better than any one else."</p>

  <p>"In his official capacity, you mean?" he queried.</p>

  <p>"Official, or professional, or both," I told him. "I don't know. It's a
  guess."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" he grunted. "But you may be right. You know him better than I do,
  and I know he's a mighty closemouthed party until he's willing to speak.
  Well, I've done my part in bringin' 'em together, an' if he convinces Simpson
  there's anything he ought to do, he'll do it. He's a straight shooter all
  right."</p>

  <p>I left him and made my way back to the office on foot. And as I walked,
  once more I reviewed the entire affair, which, so far at least as Semi Dual,
  and Bryce, and I were concerned, had begun with the coming of Moira Mason to
  our office&mdash;which had led Imer Lamb into the House of Invisible Bondage,
  that house on a hill which, despite its high outlook, was but a refuge of
  sorts for men and women of clouded minds; and ever since had run out a
  practically invisible course.</p>

  <p>The little phone box buzzed again that evening, close to five. Its
  whirring meant that Semi Dual was back from his visit with Simpson, and was
  calling for me. I rose and answered.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Glace speaking."</p>

  <p>"Listen, Gordon, my friend," his voice came back. "Tonight at nine
  o'clock, you and Bryce will go to the lounge of the Glen Arms Hotel. There
  you will meet Mrs. Marya Harding, and escort her to the roof. You will remain
  there at a table, enjoying the evening's entertainment, until the lady
  expresses a desire to leave. You will then drive with her in her machine to
  the rear of the block in which the Drake Sanatorium is located, stopping
  opposite a small tradesmen's door in the wall that surrounds the sanatorium
  grounds in the rear. This gate is customarily locked at night. But a key has
  been provided for the use of the one who will need it.</p>

  <p>"At this gate you will wait until one comes through it, and enters your
  car. As soon as that one is inside, you will accompany Mrs. Harding to her
  home on Park Drive. Do you comprehend me fully?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," I assured him, startled, filled with vague speculations by
  this call upon myself and Bryce. "But, Semi&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not now." He halted the question 'that was rising to my lips. "Attend to
  this without fail. On it hangs a human life. Afterward all will be explained,
  or will explain itself."</p>

  <p>"We'll attend to it, of course," I promised, and hung up.</p>

  <p>A human life, the life of someone in the House of Invisible Bondage, of
  that someone who would come through the little tradesmen's gate in the rear
  wall. Was it Imer Lamb? My every nerve was tense as I went in search of
  Bryce, and found him with his usual black cigar between his teeth.</p>

  <p>I told him, and he took the weed from his mouth and stared. "By Heaven!"
  he said, and stood up. We stood there facing one another through several
  heartbeats. "They're goin' to try to bump him off?" he went on then in a tone
  of utter bewilderment. "But that ain't possible, Glace. Drake said he was
  goin' to be released. Told you, an' me, an' Johnson. They wouldn't
  dare&mdash;after that."</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It doesn't seem plausible," I agreed. "But if it isn't
  Imer, who else?"</p>

  <p>"Say," he began with a sagging law, and then he pulled it up, "what sort
  of a dump, is that place of Drake's?" And abruptly his lids slitted, and he
  spoke again a single word. "Henri!"</p>

  <p>Henri, Semi's own man who, he had said, was gathering straws. If there
  were too many straws for him to gather, and they knew he had done it, his
  life might be in danger, I thought.</p>

  <p>Jim put his cigar back again between his lips. "But this here get-away
  seems to be pretty well planned. We're to meet Marya at the Glen Arms, and go
  to the roof show. The question is do I go as I am, or wear soup and
  fish?"</p>

  <p>"I think we go as we are," I decided. "I'll meet you at the Glen Arms
  about eight forty-five."</p>

  <p>"All right. I'll be there before you," he said...</p>

  <p>And he was, seated on a divan in the lounge, with a watchful eye that
  lighted as I approached.</p>

  <p>It lighted again as Marya Harding came toward us a minute or two before
  nine, and we rose to meet her, and escort her to the roof, where were tables,
  lights, music, and a summer roof-garden show. And well might any man's eyes
  light at sight of her, I thought. She was in a summer evening costume that
  accentuated her darkly Oriental beauty, with a light embroidered scarf of
  some filmy tissue about her shoulders and throat.</p>

  <p>"Ah, here you are, my friends," she said, as she reached us, and extended
  a hand to each. Her eyes were sparkling, and there was a smile on her red
  lips. "Bob's out of town, and so, when our other friend asked me to lend him
  my car and myself this evening, he had to furnish me an escort, and lent me
  you gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"After all, as you may recall, he characterized us as his satellites, in
  the beginning of this muddle. And, it seems, there are really three of us
  this evening," I responded. "You know, the Persians refer to a beautiful
  woman as a full moon."</p>

  <p>"That's very nice." She nodded, her smile once more flashing out. "Shall
  we go up?"</p>

  <p>The Glen Arms was the best hotel our city boasted, and in the summer was a
  popular, evening resort. The result was that even so early we found the roof
  garden thronged. But Marya Harding was well known. A captain bowed before
  her, and led us to a little table already reserved, well off to one side.</p>

  <p>"I telephoned for this in time to be sure we'd get about what we wanted,"
  she said as we sat down. "When our friend asked me to take a hand on behalf
  of this girl&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Girl?" Jim echoed sharply, and as quickly shut himself off. His
  expression was one of blank amazement.</p>

  <p>Marya eyed him. His lips twitched in what seemed to me a faint amusement.
  "Why, yes. Didn't you know? Didn't you really know?" she said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE RESCUE</h2>

  <p class="first">"NOPE." Jim fumbled for a cigar and set it alight. About us
  at other tables men were smoking. "It's a girl then, is it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Marya narrowed her lids. "He didn't tell you?"</p>

  <p>"Merely the salient details of what we were to do&mdash;nothing specific,"
  I informed her.</p>

  <p>And suddenly she laughed. "It's his way, isn't it?" she observed. "But
  with me he was more specific, as you put it, Mr. Glace. It's rather dreadful.
  I used to know her as a matter of fact.</p>

  <p>"She was one of the younger set, a dear girl; I remember when she went to
  pieces. It was after her mother died. She&mdash;her mother, I mean&mdash;was
  an invalid for years. And Gladys&mdash;this girl&mdash;took care of her
  pretty much at the last.</p>

  <p>"Of course, there were nurses, but there's such a lot nurses can't do, and
  those things Gladys did. She broke down completely after her mother's
  death&mdash;too much nerve strain, they said at the time. That was over a
  year ago, and she's been in this place ever since."</p>

  <p>Jim stared straight into her face. "Because?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you here. And I told you it was dreadful, and it is. It's
  like a horrid story. One hates to think such things could happen, even he
  planned. It's like a nightmare."</p>

  <p>"S-D told you?" Jim asked.</p>

  <p>"Part of it. What I told you about her before I knew myself. But he told
  me why he asked what he did. Please don't look so serious. We're supposed to
  be a pleasure party by any one who sees us."</p>

  <p>"You heard from Miss Mason?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered, once more smiling. "She was in Los Angeles the last
  time she wrote, but expects to be back in ten days or two weeks."</p>

  <p>Here was additional news. This glowing woman seemed to actually know more
  about certain phases of the matter than either Jim or I. I laughed. "At least
  we knew she was on the West Coast," I said.</p>

  <p>"And why?" she challenged.</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>Her brown eyes danced. "I think Bo-Peep was right. Our dear friend is
  delicious," she declared, and began beating time with a hand to the music.
  "Mr. Glace, do you dance?"</p>

  <p>I rose, and followed her to the floor, where numerous couples revolved;
  and we spun off through and among its revolving life. "I'm
  thrilled&mdash;positively thrilled by this night's adventure," she confessed.
  "I feel like a character out of some awfully exciting book."</p>

  <p>"You know that a human life depends on its success?" I whispered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, then&mdash;you do know something?" she whispered back. "Yes, I know.
  But we're going to succeed, Mr. Glace. Henri, his own man, has arranged
  everything, of course."</p>

  <p>The music ceased. I led her back to the table where Jim sat and smoked.
  Our refreshments were served. Time ran away in music, dance, and talk.
  Finally Marya balanced at a tiny watch on her wrist. "I think we had better
  be going," she suggested.</p>

  <p>It was half past eleven o'clock.</p>

  <p>We rose and left our table, and made our way down to the street. Marya's
  car&mdash;a closed machine&mdash;was waiting in a parking place. We entered,
  Marya taking her place in the driver's seat.</p>

  <p>After a bit we began to climb up a street illuminated only by corner arcs.
  And at the crest of that street we turned, and ran a block, and turned again,
  and dropped silently down the slope, the motor cut down to a whisper,
  literally coasting to a final standstill beside the curb, midway between the
  intersecting streets.</p>

  <p>Beyond us was a wall with an arched doorway, now closed. Above the wall
  were the shadowy tops of trees against a night sky. There was no moon.</p>

  <p>Marya shut off the lights. In the following starlight her face showed
  white. Beyond those trees was the House of Invisible Bondage, made quite
  invisible by them, and the night.</p>

  <p>We waited. No one spoke. There was a little breeze; it rustled ghostlike
  in the leaves beyond the wall. I heard the woman beside me catch her breath,
  and felt I knew what she was thinking. Would she succeed in
  escaping?&mdash;the girl for whom we waited.</p>

  <p>Would Henri's plans&mdash;Dual's plans&mdash;carry? Suddenly the tension
  that held me relaxed. I breathed more-freely. Dual's plans! When had I known
  them to fail? I stiffened again suddenly. Again Marya Harding caught her
  breath. Behind us I heard Jim move, and the sigh of the car door opening.</p>

  <p>There had been a click of metal, faint, short, sharp like the click of the
  wards of a lock. And now the little door in the wall was swinging open, and a
  darkly muffled figure was slipping through. It passed the door and paused,
  and appeared to stoop. Again came the metallic clicking. And then the slim
  dark shape was coming toward us, a flitting shadow in the midnight dusk of
  the street.</p>

  <p>It reached us. The car sagged slightly as its weight was lifted to the
  step; then the door closed softly. Marya released her brakes; with the slope
  of the street to aid us, we rolled soundlessly forward, one, two, three
  blocks. Then, as the grade lessened, she let in the clutch. She had left her
  gears engaged, and instantly the engine purred. She turned, and swung off and
  away in the direction of Park Drive. I heard her whispering&mdash;whispering
  to herself: "Thank Heaven!"</p>

  <p>The thing was accomplished; a vast elation filled me. Out of the House of
  Invisible Bondage we had brought a human soul! Behind me I could hear Bryce
  speaking softly, and a softly replying voice. The purr of the engine
  heightened. We fled through the streets at the limit of legal speed. And
  suddenly Marya Harding laughed. "Yoiks! Gone away! Are you all right,
  Gladys?" she called.</p>

  <p>"Marya&mdash;it's Marya Harding"' a girl's voice exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my child." Once more Marya laughed with a note of nervous tension in
  the sound of it, as she drove. The car slued around a corner. We were on Park
  Drive itself. And then we were turning from it into a driveway that led back
  to a garage. We slid into it. The sound of the motor died. "And here we are,"
  she said. "All out."</p>

  <p>We got out. Jim and I closed the doors. We followed a cement walk to a
  side door, and entered the house. The girl walked with Marya; they were
  whispering together. Then, as the door closed, the lights struck upon us.
  Marya slipped the dark coat from her companion, and turned her toward us.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Glace and Mr. Bryce, let me present Miss Gladys Ashton," she
  said.</p>

  <p>Ashton! The name struck a memory in my brain of the night I had visited
  Drake in the House of Invisible Bondage, of the nurse, and the woman, who had
  come to the door of his study. "Doctor&mdash;Miss Ashton. She is growing
  violent again," she had said. Ashton&mdash;Gladys Ashton.</p>

  <p>She was a slim blonde, with wide, dark-circled eyes in a drawn, yet now
  hope-lighted face. She was the girl whose scream I had heard that night, that
  scream at the recollection of which I had shuddered as I had looked back at
  the house that held her, that house on the hill, with its windows barred. And
  now she stood here with a half uncertain smile struggling into being on her
  lips.</p>

  <p>"I am happy to meet Miss Ashton," I faltered.</p>

  <p>Bryce ducked his head.</p>

  <p>Marya Harding laughed again. "Our friends were good enough to act as my
  escort tonight at the behest of the man who helped Henri arrange everything,"
  she explained.</p>

  <p>"The man whom Henri calls the 'Master?'" Gladys Ashton questioned. "You
  know, it seems odd, but so much that is strange has happened to me that
  nothing seems really odd any longer, he read my horoscope after Henri had
  asked me the date of my birth.</p>

  <p>"And after that he sent me a little saw by Henri; and I sawed the bars,
  and used soap and the iron filings to hide the traces of my work. And Henri
  gave me a key to that door in the wall, and told me to use it tonight. Oh,
  Marya, is it really true; am I really free?"</p>

  <p>Marya slipped an arm about her. "'Not only free, but safe," she said.</p>

  <p>"But you must sit down," she went on. "Come, you shall talk a bit if you
  wish; and then you must go to bed, and get a good resting sleep."</p>

  <p>She led the way into a room I had been in more than once before, a room
  where I had seen her, herself fighting against what seemed the damning
  circumstances of an unkind fate. We sat down, Marya attending to seating
  Gladys Ashton herself.</p>

  <p>"And now&mdash;if you want to tell us&mdash;just a little of all that's
  happened, we'd like to hear I'm sure," she suggested. "Don't if you'd rather
  not."</p>

  <p>"I-I guess I'd like to," Gladys Ashton said slowly. "It all started after
  mother died. I broke down. Nerves, the doctors said. And there was so much to
  be done. You know she left a large estate. That's what started it. Did you
  know that Mr. John Parkins was mother's brother, Marya, dear?"</p>

  <p>"No." Marya shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Parkins of the Parkins-Mahlbera Trust Company?" Bryce asked.</p>

  <p>Gladys Ashton nodded. "Yes. He came to me and offered to tend to
  everything&mdash;mother left everything to me, you see. But he was very nice,
  and I was so very tired and I didn't know anything about such matters myself.
  So I gave him a-a paper to enable him to handle the property, and
  money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A power of attorney?" I suggested; and glanced at Bryce. He was frowning
  slightly.</p>

  <p>"I think that's what they called it," Miss Ashton replied. "Anyway I
  signed it, and then he said I ought to go somewhere for a rest and he brought
  Dr. Drake to see me; and they took me to his place. And I haven't left it
  since, till tonight.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't. They kept me, wouldn't let me leave. I've been a prisoner.
  They gave me something&mdash;I don't know what&mdash;something with a
  hypodermic needle that drove me almost mad, made me say things, and think
  strange thoughts.</p>

  <p>"That wasn't all the time, but only when I grew nearly frantic at the
  position in which I found myself; I did that sometimes, when I grew almost
  mad with thinking how I had been tricked, and how powerless I was to help
  myself.</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't let me see any one&mdash;gave it out to all my friends that
  I wasn't myself. Oh, they were clever; they wouldn't let any one see me
  unless I was drugged. And sometimes, when there were visitors, they would
  give me the drug, and I'd rave; I couldn't help myself.
  I-I&mdash;oh&mdash;Marya." She broke off, fighting for control.</p>

  <p>A House of Bondage&mdash;a nightmare! It had been both, an invisible
  bondage, and a long, long nightmare from which she had now escaped.</p>

  <p>"But see here," Bryce broke the silence that followed her
  emotion&mdash;engendered pause. "Were you ever examined as to your bein'
  sane, or insane&mdash;I mean by a board of doctors, or anything of the
  sort?"</p>

  <p>"Why, no, sir," Gladys Ashton told him knitting her brows in what seemed
  an effort of thought. "At least, I can't remember."</p>

  <p>Jim glanced at me. "All right. Go on," he said.</p>

  <p>"That's about all, I think." The girl resumed her story. "It just went on
  like' that, Sometimes for days, if I kept quiet, they let me alone. Then when
  it seemed to me I couldn't stand it any longer, they'd give me that drug,
  whatever it was. And sometimes after that they would keep me under it for
  days. It always affected me the same way inside a few minutes after they had
  injected it."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" I didn't speak the words, but I uttered them in my thought.
  The night I had been there she had screamed, and grown violent. The woman
  Drake had called Mrs. Porsum had come and called him when Gladys Ashton had
  screamed. The thing was horrible, and excited a sense of revolt as I listened
  to her further words.</p>

  <p>"So after a bit I just began to keep as quiet as I could so they wouldn't
  give me the drug. And then, Mr. Imer Lamb was brought there, and a man came
  with him to be his nurse. You know who it was, Marya, of course. His name was
  Henri, but he was the first one whom I had found a chance to talk to since I
  had been in that dreadful house, to explain to.</p>

  <p>"And he listened, and I thought he believed. And he did; and he did
  everything else. He told the man he calls the Master&mdash;the man who reads
  people's fate in the stars. And then I began to hope. He brought me the
  little saw, and gave me the key he had, had made for me from a wax impression
  he had managed to make of the lock on that door, the key I used tonight.</p>

  <p>"I used the saw at night and hid it in the daytime. And you know the rest.
  And now I'm here with you; and you say I'm safe. And I'm not crazy; I'm not
  crazy!" At the end her voice shot suddenly up in a passion of
  protestation.</p>

  <p>"Of course you're not," Marya declared, crossing quickly to her and laying
  a hand on her shoulder. "You're just tired, just all unstrung&mdash;worn out.
  And I'm going to put you to bed."</p>

  <p>"I'm not sleepy, though, Marya dear." Gladys Ashton forced a smile to her
  lips. "I'm too happy&mdash;too happy. It's so wonderful to be back in the
  world again, out of that house."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," Bryce spoke again with his sometimes almost brutal
  directness, "'that all the time you've been there, this precious uncle of
  yours has been playin' ducks and drakes with your estate?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;oh, I don't know." Miss Ashton turned her eyes toward him. "But
  I'm afraid you're right. He was mother's brother. I suppose be thought he had
  some right to what she had left.</p>

  <p>"I've thought about it, of course. I don't know what he's done, but I've
  wondered. He must have paid Dr. Drake to keep me there as he did&mdash;and he
  would have had a reason for that. And he was always a speculator. I know it
  worried mother. He used to come to her for help at times when she was still
  alive."</p>

  <p>"An' durin' the last year, then, he's probably been helpin' himself," Jim
  rumbled, with a disgusted note in his voice. "Well, Miss Ashton, I'm sure
  glad to have had even my little finger in assistin' at this get-away of
  yours, and if there is any way I can help you further&mdash;say, for
  instance, in cleanin' up on this affectionate uncle of yours, why&mdash;you
  can count on James Bryce."</p>

  <p>"You're very kind." The girl's eyes were wide and dark. "I don't know
  right now how to thank you."</p>

  <p>"You don't need to," Jim told her sincerely. "I guess I'd get thanks
  enough in just the job itself. Such things make me sick." And he really
  looked it, as he sat there scowling, his brows drawn together, his stubby
  brown mustache pursed out over his lip.</p>

  <p>Here, then, I thought was another surface stirring in the course of the
  whole affair, a quivering of the surface that once more hinted of some
  greater disturbance, some deeper, darker, more sinister element, moving
  unseen in the depths, another incident in what I had come to call the
  invisible course of the matter, not in its way unlike the triangular dorsal
  fin of a shark, cutting the sun-lighted wave to mark the course of the
  destroying monster underneath.</p>

  <p>"Come, dear." Marya Harding was speaking; she drew the girl to her
  feet.</p>

  <p>Bryce and I rose. The episode was ended in so far as I could see. The girl
  was free, and as Marya had assured her, safe, I fancied. Her escape had been
  well-nigh soundless. They would hardly think of looking for her here in this
  fashionable house. Here she could lie hid, and recuperate, until she was
  ready, in a time&mdash;probably, as I thought now, of Dual's
  selection&mdash;to step forth, to confront, confound, and condemn those by
  whom she had been so greatly wronged. Gripping as it was in itself, it was no
  more than an episode, indeed.</p>

  <p>"Then, we'll say good night&mdash;or good morning," I suggested. "How do
  we go out?"</p>

  <p>She went quickly toward the front door. Jim and I trailed behind her. But
  just inside the door I paused.</p>

  <p>"She'll need medical attention, won't she?" I questioned. "And, under the
  circumstances, will it, or won't it, be difficult?"</p>

  <p>"Under the circumstances it will not." Marya's dark eyes shot a twinkling
  glance into my face. "I have a harmless sleeping powder for her tonight, and
  in the morning Dr. Simpson will see her and take charge."</p>

  <p>She drew the door open. We passed outside, and went down the walk to the
  street before either of us spoke. And then, as usual, it was Bryce who broke
  forth once more in a heavy rumble of half-comprehension,
  half-bewilderment:</p>

  <p>"Simpson. Well, I am damned. So that's why Semi wanted to meet him. It
  beats me. On the level it beats me, Glace."</p>

  <p>I nodded. Dual had said everything would be explained, or explain itself,
  and seemingly once more his promise was verified.</p>

  <p>"It beats both of us, Jim, and I think it's calculated to beat this whole
  infernal proposition," I agreed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; BREAKING UP THE HOUSE</h2>

  <p class="first">YET, even so, the course of the thing was to be marked by
  other surface stirrings, other incidents, and other episodes.</p>

  <p>Two days after the night when Gladys Ashton was released from the House of
  Invisible Bondage, John Parkins, president of the Parkins-Mahlberg Trust
  Company, took a gun from the drawer of a deck in his ovate office, and shot
  himself.</p>

  <p>Once more the headlines flared. The thing was suicide beyond any doubt.
  The man had left the usual letters. But, to Bryce and me, his act was more
  than it appeared to the man in the street. Practically a bankrupt, he had
  ended a losing struggle. But over and above that, his death was a
  confirmation of Gladys Ashton's story to both of us.</p>

  <p>As Jim summed it up. "If that girl's dippy, I'm a babbling idiot. She
  never was adjudged insane, I guess. Parkins just paid Drake to hold her while
  he looted her estate. Your affectionate uncle, John Parkins, deceased. Say,
  if Johnson knew the insides of this he'd have the pip."</p>

  <p>But Johnson didn't know, or the police. Parkins' financial breakdown
  seemed motive enough for his act. I found myself marveling more and more at
  this further illustration of how little the world really knew of what went
  on, back and behind the scenes.</p>

  <p>And the next day Jim came in again with a paper, and a heavy finger
  marking a personal advertisement. "Read that," he said:</p>

  <p>Information is desired leading to a meeting with Miss Gladys Ashton, sole
  heir and executrix under the will of John Parkins, of the Parkins-Mahlberg
  Trust Company, deceased. Good and Dunn, Attorneys, Stroller Building.</p>

  <p>I read it, and looked into my partner's eyes. They were narrowed. "Peachy.
  Sort of cute, ain't it?" he said. "Gladys hopped hit, as Kingsley might
  remark. By the way, that bird seems to be about himself, Johnson says. But
  comin' back to our pork chops, Gladys has melted into thin air, an' they
  darsent raise a fuss, especially now that old John has gracefully shuffled
  off. So they advertise, an' bait the hook. Just the same, I wonder how much
  Drake had to do with Parkins' death."</p>

  <p>"Blackmail?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Beaucoup pennies probably," he replied. "Why not? After John had got 'm
  to hold the girl, why, naturally, they had him in a trap. He couldn't let her
  go, and he couldn't refuse to cough up. It's peachy, as I said."</p>

  <p>"It's damnable," I growled. "But, about this advertisement. What can they
  expect to gain by getting hold of her now?"</p>

  <p>"Gain?" Jim grinned. "Why, buy her off, get her to sell 'em immunity for
  some of her own pennies back on a bet. That little lady can raise Billy Hades
  with Drake if she likes when she comes out of Marya's house, where she's
  layin' doggo right now. That is, she can if she likes."</p>

  <p>He was right, too. But I wondered, none the less. Beyond discovering
  through Johnson, again, that Kingsley was to be kept at the county hospital
  for a time, and Dual's message, sending us to meet Marya, we had heard
  nothing from Semi since. Yet, here was something I felt he ought to know.</p>

  <p>"You may be right," I rejoined. "But suppose we go up, and show this thing
  to Dual, and see what he says."</p>

  <p>What Semi actually said, however, had more to do with Parkins' death than
  the personal advertisement.</p>

  <p>He read the latter, and tossed the paper aside. "Have I not said that
  selfishness, treachery, false dealing, and the like were unstable foundations
  on which to rear a life's superstructure?" he observed. "And is it not proved
  in this suicide of a man who was guilty of their employment in his treatment
  of his sister's child? Have the soul sands on which he sought to build to his
  own advantage not opened and dragged him down at the last? Only those things
  endure which are builded on righteousness."</p>

  <p>"But this ad?" Bryce prompted. "Do you think it genuine, or a trap?"</p>

  <p>Semi Dual eyed him. "Let be, let be," he replied at length. "Let time
  answer it. Is the maid not safe? Is she not recovering health, and
  strength?"</p>

  <p>"Under Simpson?" Jim suggested.</p>

  <p>"Under Simpson's care." Semi's gray eyes twinkled, I thought.</p>

  <p>"And this place of Drake's?" Bryce turned his question to another
  point.</p>

  <p>"A House of Invisible Bondage, as I have called it. Another house builded
  upon the sand," said Semi Dual. "It, too, shall fall as a house of
  cards."</p>

  <p>Jim nodded. "Well, that's good. Justice seems to have been done in the
  case of Parkins, at all events."</p>

  <p>"And the law will take its course against any man who runs counter to it,"
  Dual returned.</p>

  <p>"Bo-Peep's comin' home, Marya Harding says," Jim continued. "You know
  it?"</p>

  <p>Semi inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"But Imer hasn't been turned loose."</p>

  <p>"Nay, but he will be before long, I think."</p>

  <p>Once more Jim&mdash;grinned. "Is there anything you'd like to say this
  mornin' before we leave?" he inquired with good-natured impudence.</p>

  <p>And Semi Dual's lips twitched slightly. "What is to be will be, my
  friend."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," said Jim, and stood up. "The clock, eh&mdash;this here, now,
  astrological alarm clock again. Did you and Simpson decide that Kingsley was
  a nut, or just a brainstorm case, or what?"</p>

  <p>"We concurred in Dr. Drake's estimation of the matter that the man
  Kingsley would very shortly be himself again," Semi returned.</p>

  <p>Jim gave it up, but he chuckled once we had left the tower. "Just the
  same, he knows what's what," he declared. "He's dead sure of it by this time,
  son. He never talks quite like that unless he does. He's got that web of his
  all woven, an' he's dead certain it's strong enough to hold."</p>

  <p>I nodded. "I think so, Jim," I assented.</p>

  <p>"He knows. He knows," Jim repeated, and puffed furiously at his cigar. "By
  golly, son, it's rich. I bet that there House of Invisible Bondage is more
  like a beehive these last few days. Gladys beats it, and Parkins pulls a
  suicide.</p>

  <p>"Drake must be just about matchin' pennies to see where he gets off. An'
  whisper this to the pines, my boy&mdash;he ain't goin' to get off, whether he
  knows it or not. Not if that net of Semi's holds. As a straw gatherer my
  hat's off to Henri. That baby certainly is good."</p>

  <p>"Gladys' bustin' out should prove a pretty heavy straw, too. An' you can
  see how Semi's goin' to use her; just keep her under cover till he's ready;
  then bingo! She won't be just a straw; she'll be more like a whole
  stack."</p>

  <p>"Possibly that's what Parkins thought," I suggested.</p>

  <p>We were still talking it over as we entered the office, and found Johnson
  seated in my private room with his hat on top of my desk.</p>

  <p>"Hello," he greeted. "Say, there's an ad in the paper about a niece of
  Parkins, this mornin'. Seen it, have you, Bryce?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. He's seen it. I see you know he's a newspaper addict," I
  returned before Jim had more than nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was up to see Good an' Dunn about it," Johnson resumed. "There's
  something funny the way Parkins seems to have took his high dive. Their ad's
  straight. Parkins left a will naming her heir an' executrix, if alive."</p>

  <p>"If alive?" I repeated. "Didn't he know whether she was or not?"</p>

  <p>"That's the question," Johnson declared. "He ought to,
  because&mdash;here's the funny stuff&mdash;he kept her the last year over
  here in Doc Drake's place. Not crazy, you understand, just troubled with her
  nerves. Seems he'd mentioned it to Good before, asked him to look after the
  girl in case anything ever happened to him, and then he makes this will an'
  mails it to him, the day he killed himself.</p>

  <p>"So Good calls up this joint of Drake's, an' finds out the girl had
  disappeared, run off two nights before the suicide; an' Drake swears he don't
  know where she is. So Good runs the ad."</p>

  <p>"Yeah?" Jim walked over and stood looking out of a window. I fancied he
  didn't care to look Johnson in the face. It was plain enough he knew nothing
  beyond the facts he had mentioned, and Jim manifestly felt he might read our
  greater knowledge in his expression.</p>

  <p>"Yeah. Furthermore," Johnson ran on, "along with the will was a letter of
  instructions to Good and Dunn, and another letter addressed to this Gladys
  Ashton&mdash;that was the girl's name&mdash;to be delivered only to her, or
  in the event of her failing to appear within a year, to be destroyed
  unopened."</p>

  <p>"Which means that Parkins knew she had disappeared before he shot
  himself," I said.</p>

  <p>"Seemingly," Johnson assented quickly. "That's the point."</p>

  <p>"If you'll look it up," I told him, "you'll find that Gladys Ashton's
  mother left a large fortune when she died, and left it not in part to her
  brother, but wholly to her child. Gladys broke down after her mother's death,
  and Parkins seems to have taken care of her since."</p>

  <p>"Taken care of her is right." Jim spoke without turning around.</p>

  <p>"Well, by the Lord!" Johnson exclaimed. "Parkins, was a plunger, I know,
  but holy smoke! Good and Dunn asked the office to try an' help find this
  girl, last night. That's how I got into it. What do you know about
  it&mdash;anything else?"</p>

  <p>"A lot more than you do," Jim spun around. "An' what we don't, we can
  guess. Let it alone. Stall these lawyers off. If you don't, you're apt to tip
  over the beans. Johnson&mdash;" he came across and stared full into his old
  pal's eyes, "&mdash;what would you say if I was to tell you that girl is
  right here in this city?"</p>

  <p>"I'd say you knew where she was!" Johnson narrowed his lids.</p>

  <p>And Bryce nodded. He knew his man, knew he was deserving of trust, a man
  who had devoted the best of his life to the interests of law, and order, and
  justice. "Yes, an' you'd be right," he averred. "And what would you say if I
  was to tell you further that Doc Simpson is takin' care of her right now,
  tryin' to undo Drake's work?"</p>

  <p>"I'd say Semi Dual," Johnson told him. I saw comprehension flash in his
  eyes. "So that's it, eh? Let's see; that bird said justice was goin' to be
  done, an' the law take its course. He's gunnin' for Drake."</p>

  <p>"He's gunnin' for anybody that needs gunnin' for," Jim returned with
  emphasis. "An' he's goin' to get 'em, Johnson. He put Simpson on this girl's
  case. He's watchin' 'em, Johnson, watchin' 'em like a hawk, beatin' 'em to
  it, copperin' their every bet, their every move. Hold up your tryin' to find
  this girl until he's ready to use her. Don't go to mussin' into it now."</p>

  <p>He stood facing the inspector; the two men looked deep into one another's
  eyes. And then Johnson nodded slowly in the way of one who reaches a
  decision. "All right, Jimmie," he yielded. "Keep your shirt on. I'll lay off.
  But ask him to let me find her when he's ready."</p>

  <p>"You're on, if it's possible, Johnnie." Jim stuck out his hand.</p>

  <p>And Johnson shook hands with him.</p>

  <p>"All right then, Jim, that's tended to," he said. "I'll be gettin' along.
  Drake was just sort of keepin' her for Parkins at that rate."</p>

  <p>Bryce nodded. "Yes, the dirty crook."</p>

  <p>"Considerin' which he ought to be about as nervous as a fish," our visitor
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"Yeah." Suddenly Bryce grinned. "And whether he is or not, from now on,
  he's apt to get about as far as a hen on a settin' of addled eggs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which ain't far," Johnson decided. "Well&mdash;so long. Slip me the
  office any time you're needin' help."</p>

  <p>"The greatest help you can give us right now is to do nothin'," Bryce told
  him.</p>

  <p>He mumbled farewell, and stalked out.</p>

  <p>But despite his prognostication that Drake might be somewhat disturbed by
  the course of recent events, another two days passed without any happening of
  apparent interest to us.</p>

  <p>Then, however, Imer Lamb was released. As was to be expected, the daily
  press bulletined the fact. Not only that, but two other inmates of the House
  of Bondage were taken with Lamb before a commission, and adjudged sane as a
  preliminary to their release. As Jim expressed it, Drake appeared to have
  organized a "graduating class."</p>

  <p>"Four in the last few days. One lost, an' three turned out. Well, anyway,
  he's goin' to save somethin' on board bills," he observed.</p>

  <p>Lamb, however, having in his return to liberty verified Semi Dual's
  prediction that such a return would occur, proceeded to plunge himself into
  the limelight of public interest at once.</p>

  <p>The night after his release he entertained a party on the Glen Arms roof.
  The thing was duly noted in the next morning papers. The subsequent
  afternoon, he motored to the aviation field, and took up his plane for an
  exhibition of flying such as had not been seen in local aviation circles for
  many years.</p>

  <p>If there was a bit of trick work, a breathtaking stunt of aerial evolution
  which he did not perform, to judge from the next day's story, his omission of
  it from his program was a matter of oversight merely, and not intent. His
  plane had seemingly never been on a level keel for more than a few minutes at
  a stretch. It dived and climbed, turned, and twisted, and looped. It seemed
  to have literally writhed in the air in a series of gymnastics through which
  it was difficult to imagine that its glistening fabric could have lived.</p>

  <p>"The Mad Aviator", some unthinking reporter called him in an enthusiasm
  born of his amazing antics, perhaps. One didn't like to think it was more
  than unthinkingness. The mad aviator&mdash;and Imer Lamb but just released,
  from an institution designed for the treatment of mental conditions. Not but
  what he did in the air would have seemed to justify the title, but because
  the name stuck. And because Lamb kept it up.</p>

  <p>He continued to act in a fashion calculated to deserve his name. His
  flying became a sensation, a dread, an ordeal at the flying field. Out there
  no one doubted but sooner or later he would crash his plane; the thing was
  inevitable in the opinion of all the field attendants. Indirectly I heard
  that they had deliberately formed a pool, based on their expectations of the
  event.</p>

  <p>It drew an audience. More and more those seeking a morbid thrill drove out
  to park their cars, and watch that solo aerial circus which could some day
  have but one horribly certain end; for Imer Lamb now did only solo flying.
  Where formerly he had frequently taken up a mechanic with him, he now
  consistently left the man behind. There was a sinister import in the action
  that hinted at only one thing.</p>

  <p>"Tryin' to kill himself," Bryce growled his comment. "Tryin' to break his
  neck an' make it look like an accident. Anybody can see it. Maybe he ain't
  crazy, but his flyin' is pure insane."</p>

  <p>I nodded. I had long before reached the same conclusion in my own
  mind.</p>

  <p>It was not a pleasant thought, hinting as it did of what the man's own
  thoughts must be. But it was the only plausible explanation of his actions
  one could entertain. I thought of Bo-Peep, the little Venus Semi had urged
  away.</p>

  <p>In a way I think I prayed for her return. If she came back&mdash;if she
  wept to him or called him to her&mdash;she might be able to stop this mad
  courting of death on which he had engaged. I even found myself wondering if
  her absence could be one of the causes back of the thing.</p>

  <p>Yet if so, if it were in any sense a major cause, it seemed odd to me that
  Dual should have let her Western visit drag so long. It was not like him. His
  study of their conjoined charts must have shown him the danger. And such a
  danger he would not, I felt sure, have ignored.</p>

  <p>Yet, meanwhile, Imer laughed ribaldry into the faces of those who sought
  to stay him, and became a veritable demon of the air, who balked not at
  anything. Careless of all consequences, he yet seemed possessed of a charmed
  life that defied all mischance in any spectacular evolution he undertook, and
  brought him back again and again to the ground with a half-contemptuous smile
  for the strained eyes of those who had watched him.</p>

  <p>Then one day Jim entered my room for the third time with an afternoon
  paper, and plunked himself into a chair.</p>

  <p>"Well," he remarked, "I'm gettin' to be a regular society news hound, an'
  I see Bo-Peep's got home. Now maybe she'll take a hand in this game, and snap
  a leading string on her Lamb."</p>

  <p>But the next morning, Dual called us to the roof, and we answered the
  summons, and found Moira Mason, herself, strained of face, as one is strained
  in the grip of some numbing emotion, seated with him in the inner tower
  room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; THE CONFERENCE IN THE TOWER</h2>

  <p class="first">MOIRA MASON was white. All color seemed drained from her.
  Shadows lay under her blue eyes. Her appearance shocked me. One felt that the
  faith and hope she had said so confidently should support her had deserted
  her instead.</p>

  <p>The last time I had seen her Bo-Peep had been so much more her normal
  self, even if a bit disturbed, a bit uncertain. Lamb and his mad course since
  his release had rendered her haggard with fright.</p>

  <p>Bryce though was more natural, less formal than myself in his
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Bo-Peep&mdash;what the devil's happened now?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Wait," Semi Dual spoke, before she could possibly answer. "Much has
  happened&mdash;and most of it of import to us who would undo a wrong, and
  make straight a crooked path. That you may hear of it I have called here this
  morning in order that, having heard it, you may once more render aid. Some
  little Miss Mason has told me. Yet she shall tell it again, and perchance at
  greater length. Be seated."</p>

  <p>Jim and I found chairs.</p>

  <p>"And now, Moira," Semi prompted. "Speak to us those things within thy
  heart, and speak as one speaks to friends."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know. I hadn't heard a whisper of it till I got home," Bo-Peep
  began. "Imer's dreadful flying I mean. I didn't even know he had been
  released until after I had reached my home, and called his brother on the
  phone. Then he told me, and said he must see me at once. It surprised me
  greatly. He'd never been very friendly.</p>

  <p>"But he was so urgent that I said he might come. And then I called Imer's
  apartments, and a strange man answered and said he was Imer's valet, but that
  he wasn't there at present, but out at the flying field. I was surprised when
  he said he was Imer's man, because he'd had Joe Kingsley for years, and I
  didn't know about Joe either until after I saw George.</p>

  <p>"I left word for Imer to call my number, and then George came and told me
  about Imer's flying. I'd never seen him quite as he was. He was frightened. I
  could see he was frightened, and he asked me, told me I must make Imer stop,
  because if he kept on he was practically certain to be killed. I asked him
  what made him do such a thing, and he hesitated a minute and then said he
  didn't know.</p>

  <p>"But some way I knew that he lied. Then he went on and told me about Joe
  after I had asked him why Imer had a new man. And after I'd promised to do
  what I could with Imer he left; and I waited until I couldn't stand it, and
  then took my car and drove out to the field. Imer had just come down. I
  stopped as near to his hangar as I could, and when he came out and walked
  toward his own motor I called his name.</p>

  <p>"He was laughing, and even after he saw me he kept right on laughing. But
  he came over. 'Hello, Moira,' he said. 'Wasn't expecting you back.' He was
  very casual about it, almost as though I hadn't been out of town.</p>

  <p>"'Imer,' I said, and looked straight in his eyes. 'Imer, what is the
  meaning of this?'</p>

  <p>"And he set his lips, and looked very strange&mdash;almost as though I had
  some way hurt him. 'Rather hard to answer that here, dear girl,' he said.
  'But I'll see you this evening, if I may, and explain.'</p>

  <p>"I asked him if I couldn't drive him back, and he set his jaws again,
  almost as though he were gritting his teeth, and refused. And I drove home
  alone. I was dreadfully worried. You see, I couldn't understand, not
  then.</p>

  <p>"But he came to me that evening just as he had promised, and then I did
  understand what they'd done to him in that dreadful place&mdash;how they'd
  ruined his life and mine. He was hurt by finding I'd gone away before he got
  out too.</p>

  <p>"And I couldn't tell him, before I'd seen you, Mr. Dual. But I did tell
  him there was a reason&mdash;a very good reason&mdash;which, when I could
  tell him, he would understand. And when I said that he laughed again, and
  said it didn't matter.</p>

  <p>"'Why, Imer&mdash;why?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"And then he told me. You see he doesn't think he is still quite sane. He
  doesn't think he is insane at present, but that dreadful man, Dr. Drake, told
  him, before he was turned loose, that while he was all right now, and in his
  estimation would remain so; still the history of cases which had once
  exhibited symptoms of a homicidal nature was that they might at any time
  recur."</p>

  <p>"The infernal hound!" Jim's ejaculation cut into the sound of her
  voice.</p>

  <p>In a flash I saw what Drake, for some purpose of his own, had
  done&mdash;how he had turned Imer Lamb out of his institution with a
  suggestion of a recurrence of his recent affliction to ride him haggle the
  rest of his life.</p>

  <p>It was an infernal, a fiendish thing. It was diabolical. My mind balked at
  a term foul enough to describe the thing. And it had been cold-blooded,
  deliberate I thought of Drake's first assurance to me that Lamb would soon
  return to a practical normal, and I began to understand. It had been part of
  a thought-out scheme.</p>

  <p>I saw Moira Mason's eyes turn to Jim to Semi, to me, and back to Dual
  again. "You see what he had done," she resumed. "He had set him free, but
  with that terrible thought in his brain. I cried out that I didn't believe
  it. But it made no impression on him. He said that the mere chance that it
  was true spelled the end of all things between us&mdash;that he would never
  marry, never consider marriage as long as he felt that he carried an unsound
  spot in his brain. And when he said that I-I&mdash;" for the first time a
  faint tinge of color crept into her white cheeks..."I threw myself into his
  arms, told him I was sure it was all false that&mdash;that I was willing to
  prove my faith by marrying him at once."</p>

  <p>"But it wasn't any use. He held me, he was very gentle; but he was so
  dreadfully, terribly strong. He was strong enough to refuse me. He stood firm
  in his determination&mdash;he held me, talked to me, and then at the
  end&mdash;he kissed me. It wasn't just good night&mdash;it was good-by."</p>

  <p>"And he's flying again this afternoon. He told me he would before he
  kissed me good-by and went. And I can't stand it&mdash;I can't stand it!"</p>

  <p>She clenched her hands. "I can't let him. It means just one thing. He
  won't come back; he doesn't mean to come back if he flies this afternoon. I
  don't know. If I'd never gone away&mdash;perhaps. But
  now&mdash;now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Peace, child." Dual's mellow voice struck bell-like into the gasping
  phrases of her emotion. "Had you not gone, could you then have rendered your
  fullest help to him?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes turned toward him. They were wide, dark. I watched her, this girl
  who was fighting so hard for her mate. And, too, I saw now the measure of
  that man; Imer Lamb had become a figure to excite my admiration as one who
  did what he thought right, refused to pander to self no matter what it might
  mean to him. It had been a final farewell his lips had conveyed to Moira's
  lips. This afternoon he would no longer leave his fate to chance. He would
  seek, and find it in a quick and whirling plunge.</p>

  <p>Her pale lips moved. "No, of course not," they whispered. "If I had not
  gone, done what you told me, I could not have brought back proof of those
  things you felt must be proved. But&mdash;to come back with it, feeling I was
  bringing help to him, and then to have what is happening this afternoon
  happen&mdash;to find they had wrecked all the future while I was gone."</p>

  <p>"Wrecked?" Dual's tone expressed a question that seemed to catch her up,
  to excite other thoughts in her brain.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I've tried to be strong," she cried. "I've tried to have faith, hope,
  to go on. I've done everything I could, everything you said, as nearly as I
  could. I've brought back proof of everything you said I must."</p>

  <p>"Everything?" Dual questioned again</p>

  <p>"I think so," she returned. "I found why Drake left Los Angeles, where he
  practiced. I found out that Nathalie Norton is not Nathalie Norton really,
  but his sister."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Jim rose half out of his chair.</p>

  <p>Nathalie Norton, George Lamb's intimate friend, was Nathalie Drake, the
  sister of the man who had been so greatly involved in the affairs of Imer
  Lamb.</p>

  <p>"Yes." I heard Moira speaking. "She was in pictures, as you know, for a
  time till Drake had to leave California. Then she came here with him, and met
  George Lamb.</p>

  <p>"I think George is scared, dreadful frightened, since he sees that this
  affair is going to result in Imer's death. He was frightened yesterday
  afternoon. But he lied; I knew he lied when he said he didn't know. There was
  a guilty knowledge in his eyes. I&mdash;oh&mdash;why can't men learn that
  women feel such things? He knows&mdash;I sure of it."</p>

  <p>"He knows," said Semi Dual. "Listen Venus, did I not say in the beginning
  that you should greatly aid&mdash;and have you not done so since that time?
  Yet listen further, and possess thyself in peace. Let not the clouds of doubt
  and lack of understanding affright you as a child is affrighted in the night
  by an ugly dream.</p>

  <p>"He knows&mdash;and Uranus is a sign of explosive nature. Uranus is
  sometime named in astrology as the policeman of the Sun. Uranus in the
  present instance is drawing ever closer to that overlord of his, to the time
  when Neptune and Mars shall feel the flaming fury of the Sun himself and
  thereby be destroyed.</p>

  <p>"Child, think you that I have sat idle while you have worked? Did I not
  say to you that Jupiter was the judge? Nay, I worked and watched, and marked
  every move in this sorry matter. Even in the matter of thy lover's flying I
  have not intervened. For a man dies at the time when his death is written,
  and my study of the life chart of Imer Lamb has shown me that his death is
  not to come upon him for years&mdash;many years."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;oh&mdash;do you mean that?" Bo-Peep cried out, while again
  I saw the explanation of Semi's seemingly paradoxical actions at which I had
  marveled and now marveled once again.</p>

  <p>He answered her softly: "Know you who the man was who answered you
  yesterday afternoon from the rooms of Imer Lamb?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Henri," said Semi Dual. "My own man&mdash;the man I sent into this
  unclean house of Hugo Drake's to watch over thy beloved and at the same time
  to learn many things."</p>

  <p>"Henri&mdash;your own man?" Moira asked.</p>

  <p>"Henri," Dual repeated, "who won thy lover's liking and confidence, who
  went with him by my orders to watch over him still, after his own man, the
  British ex-soldier, Joseph Kingsley, fell an unintended victim to the working
  out of others' plans. Peace, child. While you have worked under my direction,
  and seen my assumptions proved in a concrete fashion thus far, I have
  watched. Thy lover will not fly this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Will not?" she questioned, and lifted a hand to her throat, where the
  words were half strangled.</p>

  <p>"Nay. Have I not called my friends, those whom I named my satellites, to
  me? Are they not present to take my commands? That which is to be will be,
  Moira&mdash;but not before its time. Hence, listen again and attend to my
  words, as to how this thing shall be done."</p>

  <p>For a moment he paused, and his glance swept from her to me, to Bryce,
  before he resumed.</p>

  <p>"Henri, my friend and companion, has watched and reported everything. Ye,
  my friends, shall now intervene. You will go to the rooms of Imer Lamb this
  afternoon at half after one.</p>

  <p>"But you shall not go before, since before you go Henri shall have been
  withdrawn with no word of explanation to the man to whom he has rendered
  attendance. This shall perhaps impress that man as strange. But you shall go
  to him, and say that you know that his man has gone. And you shall say to him
  that he was but the trusted agent of one who has watched the progress of this
  whole matter from the first because the woman who loves him, the woman he
  loves, requested him to do so.</p>

  <p>"And you shall invite him into the presence of this unknown friend of
  them, both the friend of his mate to be, the friend of his vanished man. You
  shall ask him to come with you. He has seen you. He may even vaguely remember
  the time&mdash;after his arrest and incarceration at the jail&mdash;when you
  called upon him. Remind him of it, if the need arise.</p>

  <p>"And say further that shall he accompany you here to my quarters he will
  get an explanation of this matter which shall make all plain and convince him
  that there is not, never has been, any real or material derangement of his
  reason, since all that has happened is but the working out of a corrupt
  scheme.</p>

  <p>"Drowning men grasp at straws, my friends. I do not think Imer Lamb will
  refuse you after you have spoken to him thus and he has a glimpse of the
  future and all it may hold for him."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;" Moira Mason was sobbing.</p>

  <p>But, to me, there was a hint of relaxing tension in the sound.</p>

  <p>"And thou, Venus," Dual addressed her as I glanced at Bryce and saw
  comprehension and eager understanding in his eyes, "who have aided greatly,
  you shall aid yet more in one thing. Return from me here to thy own home and
  make use of the telephone.</p>

  <p>"Upon it call the office of George Lamb, or seek him elsewhere until
  found. Say to him then that last night you failed to redeem the promise made
  to him as regards his brother; that he refused you, broke your engagement,
  bade you farewell, and announced his intention of flying this afternoon. Make
  plain to him that his decision appeared unalterable to you at that time."</p>

  <p>"And then?" Moira questioned, her expression mystified and startled.</p>

  <p>"Nay," said Semi Dual. "Have you yet found me lacking of a reason for
  those things I directed in anything?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," she answered quickly. "Forgive me. I've been so terribly
  frightened. But I might have known. I think maybe I did know in my
  soul&mdash;even if I couldn't see any way out in my brain. At least I brought
  all my trouble to you again. And I'll go now."</p>

  <p>"Aye, go," Dual assented, rising. "I have much to which I must attend. But
  the time is short until that time when everything, even to the smallest
  detail of this matter, shall be plain. Go, then, Moira&mdash;Venus&mdash;and
  ye, too, my friends."</p>

  <p>The three of us left the tower and passed down through the garden toward
  the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Oh," she half spoke, half sobbed, "I feel so sorry, so ashamed. I've
  disappointed him so. I've been so weak at the end."</p>

  <p>"An' don't you doubt for a minute but he understands it, Bo-Peep," Jim
  told her. "Semi Dual don't only read minds and stars; he reads the hearts of
  his fellowmen. My great aunt, Miss Mason, what you've gone through is enough
  to break any girl's nerve! You've been amazing, immense.</p>

  <p>"An' don't you see what he's doing to George by having you call him and
  tell him you failed last night? Didn't he say Uranus is explosive&mdash;an'
  ain't George Uranus, just as you are Venus an' Gordon an' me are
  satellites?</p>

  <p>"An' explosive things have a habit of blowin' up. Oh, Pip! It's a dead
  open an' shut proposition&mdash;dead open an' shut. When you slip that to
  Lamb, an' he feels sure Imer's goin' out to commit suicide this afternoon,
  he's goin' to simply blow up with a loud noise.</p>

  <p>"I'd sure like to hear it, but I won't. I'll be over with Gordon,
  persuadin' that boy of yours that his brain ain't as moth-eaten as Doc Drake
  said it was."</p>

  <p>"You really think so?" Moira Mason questioned. Renewed hope and a reborn
  faith were in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do I?" Jim grinned. "Well, I'd bet a million on it; an' since I ain't got
  it, I'd be a total ruin if I lost."</p>

  <p>And suddenly, unexpectedly, Moira Mason laughed&mdash;though her laughter
  still held the sound of unshed tears.</p>

  <p>On the seventh floor we left her and walked toward the office. "George is
  Uranus&mdash;an' Nathalie Norton is Drake's sister," Jim growled. "Can you
  beat it, son, can you beat it? No answer. You can't. But I suspected George
  was Uranus all along, remember. An' he is. Uranus, the policeman of the Sun.
  Do you get it? Moira is goin' to blow him up when she gets him, an' he's
  goin' to spill. At that rate Uranus is just about goin' to arrest himself.
  Dual sure is the serpent's hips. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He threw open the door of the outer office and paused.</p>

  <p>Norman Haddon sat there, cool, immaculate in dress, smiling as our glances
  met. Norman Haddon, Federal secret agent, a man we had known, worked with
  more than once in past years, dark, debonair, more like a society dilettante
  in speech and bearing than a man of keenly analytical mind and inflexible
  nerve.</p>

  <p>"Haddon&mdash;what the deuce are you doing here?" I exclaimed, as Jim
  emitted a sort of inarticulate grunt of both recognition and surprise.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"

  <p class="first">"WAITIN' for you chaps, old top," Norman Haddon returned as
  he rose and took my hand. "Just waitin' to say 'bon jour' or 'buenos dias,'
  as you prefer, I'm a bird of passage, you know. Flit here, flit there, never
  long in one place. In town for a day or two. Thought I'd look you up. Old
  friends, you know, and all that sort of rot. Also Dual, wonderful chap.
  Expect to see him too before I flit somewhere else."</p>

  <p>"Well, suppose you flit into my private room over here first," I
  suggested, smiling in spite of myself at his affected speech, which was as
  much of a mask as anything else, as I had long ago found out.</p>

  <p>"Righto!" he accepted, and accompanied Jim and me inside the room, the
  door of which I closed. I turned as Haddon sat down. "Now talk English. Is
  this just a friendly call, or isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, but&mdash;" His eyes twinkled. "On the level, Glace, you're a
  suspicious chap. Can't even a J. D. man make a call on a friend or two
  without standing a third degree from a private 'tec?"</p>

  <p>"He can," I said, grinning. "And the friend will be decidedly glad to see
  him. Where've you been since our last meeting down on the Mexican
  border?"</p>

  <p>"Here and there," he explained without apparently any considerable
  interest. "Los Angeles last. And that reminds me, I met an acquaintance of
  yours in the Angel City. A Miss Moira Mason, charming little lady."</p>

  <p>"Bo-Peep?" At last Bryce found his voice in a rasping fashion.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Haddon eyed him. "Well, really, I can't say, old dear. Are you one
  of her sheep? As I recall, the lady lost them, and there was no mention of
  goats. I raise the point merely because my idea of a sheep hardly fits the
  picture. But a goat now&mdash;that bit of cabbage in your mouth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jim grinned, and removed his cigar from between his teeth. "Some time ago
  a lamb took exceptions to my particular brand of tobacco," he growled.</p>

  <p>"And the lamb?" Haddon suggested.</p>

  <p>"Was adjudged insane," Jim told him.</p>

  <p>"Moira's, not Mary's, Lamb, eh?" Suddenly knowledge leaped at both of us
  in Haddon's words.</p>

  <p>Haddon knew; then his call was not a casual visit.</p>

  <p>"By th' Lord!" Jim fairly howled. "Haddon, kick in! Come through! She was
  down there&mdash;met you? Did Dual have you meet her?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he did suggest it." Haddon smiled.</p>

  <p>"And what did you find out? What did you two do?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, we looked up an address." Haddon shrugged. "That is, I did after she
  had furnished the address."</p>

  <p>"And you found?" Bryce was leaning forward.</p>

  <p>"Enough." Again Haddon shrugged. And then he sobered, his provocative
  manner dropped from him, sloughed off. "Enough, Bryce," he said. "Quite
  enough to make a lot of trouble for the man who lived there. He doesn't live
  there now. But&mdash;that's all for the present. I wired Dual I was coming,
  and I have an appointment with him for eleven."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch. "We'll have to go into it later. As a matter of
  fact, though, there is quite a tale behind Moira's Lamb, as I suspect. You
  probably know that as well as I do. She told me you we interested in the
  case. See you some more." He stood up.</p>

  <p>"Haddon!" Bryce fairly mouthed after the Government agent had taken
  himself off. "Moira met him&mdash;" he made a pin down there by Semi's
  direction&mdash;"now what the devil!"</p>

  <p>"Jim," I said. All at once I saw it or thought I did. "Jim, do you
  remember what Dual just told us to tell Imer this afternoon&mdash;that there
  is not, never has been, any actual trouble with his reason. Material trouble,
  he said. That means any actual trouble with his brain. See here, has it ever
  occurred to you that Imer Lamb may have been driven insane by drugs?"</p>

  <p>"Drugs?" he parroted, but I saw the stirrings of comprehension in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, something has made him temporarily insane&mdash;something has
  gradually upset his mental balance, something that having once produced the
  effect could be gradually withdrawn?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" he scowled. "I know Haddon's done a lot of work in the
  narcotic division of the department, but&mdash;how was it worked?"</p>

  <p>"Use your head," I told him. "Imer Lamb had one excessive
  habit&mdash;smoking."</p>

  <p>"Gordon!" He sprang up. And now I saw he understood. "That's it. They
  mixed it with his tobacco. He smoked special brand, he and George both;
  Kingsley said so."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and Kingsley said he scragged, as he expressed it, a pipeful now and
  then, if you'll remember," I returned, "And when Lamb was taken to jail he
  must have left some of it in his rooms. We know he did because according to
  Kingsley again, Drake went there to get it the day Kingsley attacked him,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, an' Kingsley had been smoking it after Imer left," Jim broke in.
  "That's it, son' He smoked it right along while he was alone, an' it got in
  its work on him. You know Dual said his blow-off was an unexpected thing in
  the working out of others' plans.</p>

  <p>"It works out. It's riveted. That's why Drake went after the stuff; that's
  why he was so damned sure Imer would recover. They took him over there, an'
  took him off the stuff, whatever it was, an' they didn't want that old supply
  he'd left to be in his dump when he went back there again!"</p>

  <p>"You've got it, Jim," I agreed. At last the thing was plain. As he said,
  it was right. It matched up. Here, then, in our deductions, once more Dual's
  assertion that Imer Lamb was mentally sound was verified. We could go to him
  this afternoon and deliver that message to his troubled soul in absolute
  confidence, a confidence that could scarcely fail to carry conviction to his
  only too willing mind.</p>

  <p>We took a taxi. It put us down at Monk's Hall, at half past one o'clock.
  Ignoring the desk, we took the elevator to Lamb's floor, and went directly to
  his suite and rang.</p>

  <p>Imer Lamb opened the door himself. I noted the fact with satisfaction.
  Henri was gone then; everything was working out.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Lamb. May we come in?" I said.</p>

  <p>He regarded us with a slightly questioning frown. "Would you employ force
  if I refused?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Why, no," I said. "But we might use argument. Have you forgotten us, Mr.
  Lamb&mdash;Mr. Glace, and my partner, Mr. Bryce?"</p>

  <p>"Glace and Bryce." His frown deepened in an effort at association.
  "Frankly, Mr. Glace, I seem to have seen you somewhere, but I've no clear
  recollection. You'll pardon it, I trust. Come in."</p>

  <p>We entered the suite, and he gave us chairs. "You saw us at the jail after
  they took you there, and I gave you a cigar, and you said it was a filthy bit
  of tobacco," Bryce remarked with his at times bludgeon-like directness as we
  sat down.</p>

  <p>"I did?" Lamb said quickly. "Okay but&mdash;you see, at that time I was
  scarcely myself, as I hope you understand. I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"That was said merely to recall the incident, Mr. Lamb," I told him,
  watching his face. It was haggard, worn, its eyes hot and feverish as they
  turned to me from Jim. "Our errand here this afternoon is to bear you an
  invitation from a friend. You see, we are acquainted with your man Henri, who
  has been your personal companion and attendant for some time, but who left
  you this morning."</p>

  <p>"Henri?" His expression showed a sudden quickened interest. "You know
  that, do you? Well, if you do, possibly you can tell me where he's gone. As
  you say, he left me today, and without a word of warning. He was here this
  morning when I went out for a time, and gone when I returned. I found it a
  bit odd. He'd been an ideal fellow, and I'd come to depend on him. Had
  intelligence; used his brain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All of that, Mr. Lamb," I interrupted. "But what would you say if I were
  to tell you, as I am here to tell you, that he was merely lent to you as an
  attendant first at Dr. Drake's institution, and later here by this other
  friend of yours from whom we come?"</p>

  <p>"A friend?" he said. "Really, Mr. Glace, I'm afraid I don't understand.
  You say he lent him to me?"</p>

  <p>"Following a suggestion made by Miss Moira Mason, the young lady to whom
  at the time of your present trouble you were engaged. She&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just a moment," he checked me sharply. "I'm not discussing personal
  matters, you'll please understand, Mr. Glace."</p>

  <p>"After she had gone to this friend whose companion Henri was," I ignored
  his interruption, "first coming to us with Mrs. Marya Harding&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait. I know Mrs. Harding, certainly," he again interposed. "You say
  Moira&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Came to us with her in order that she might meet this other friend, who
  lent Henri to her as your attendant, and ask his aid."</p>

  <p>"What are you trying to tell me?" he demanded as I paused.</p>

  <p>"I'm trying to tell you that through all your trouble you have had an
  unknown friend, Mr. Lamb," I replied.</p>

  <p>"An unknown friend?" Again he knit his brows.</p>

  <p>"Who says there ain't anything wrong with your head, an' never was, an'
  never will be so far as he knows." Bryce suddenly threw his amazing statement
  at him.</p>

  <p>For a long time Imer Lamb said nothing. And then he drew a deep and
  slightly audible breath. His lips set, the spandrels of his nostrils flared.
  His eyes turned from me to Jim. They seemed to probe, plumb, search.</p>

  <p>"Who says, in other words, that I am sane?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely." Bryce nodded.</p>

  <p>And again there was silence, while Imer Lamb wrestled with that positive
  declaration, seemed to strive to match it up with all that had been, all that
  had occurred&mdash;all that to him was now a past knowledge which, were Jim's
  words true, became something less than fact.</p>

  <p>"Then, just what was the matter with me?" he finally asked, his lip
  curling a trifle in a way to indicate unbelief.</p>

  <p>And, because it seemed best to me to do so, I left it to Bryce to answer:
  "You was doped."</p>

  <p>"I was what?" Lamb's expression altered again.</p>

  <p>"Drugged," Jim told him. "At least that's what&mdash;we suspect&mdash;just
  as we suspect they had it in that tobacco you smoked so much before you went
  off your nut."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" Lamb brought the words out in a hoarse gasp. Consternation,
  and a dawning comprehension were in his face. He seemed dazed. Belief, at
  least what I thought might be a wish to believe, struggled with unbelief
  within him in so far as I could judge. He left his chair and walked the
  length of the room, pausing beside the table whereon was the tobacco jar I
  had seen the day I came there with Jim, after Kingsley had attacked Drake,
  the jar that had seemed so innocent a thing then, and yet might well have
  held the very agency of its owner's undoing if what seemed so probable now
  were right.</p>

  <p>For a time, difficult to measure mentally, he stood looking down upon it.
  One could imagine him seeking to give it full value, questioning, arguing
  with himself, seeking to determine all it had meant, all it might mean yet to
  him in view of what he had heard. Presently he turned and came back.</p>

  <p>"But I got my tobacco from my brother. He smoked the same brand after he
  discovered it. It was a blend he got from a friend. I always obtained it from
  him."</p>

  <p>"Well?" Bryce dragged his comment across his tongue.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the two men met.</p>

  <p>They met, and held through an interval of silence.</p>

  <p>Then: "There is a rather unpleasant implication in that, don't you think,
  Mr. Bryce," Imer Lamb said. "Hadn't you 'better explain?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, Mr. Lamb," I again took part before Jim had
  seemingly decided upon an answer, "we would hardly be here&mdash;hardly
  venture even indirectly to suggest such a possibility, as I see you
  recognize, unless in our estimation it were fully possible of being supported
  by proof."</p>

  <p>"That my brother George was a party, to&mdash;to what was done?" he
  queried, once more frowning as though he found the thought hard to
  accept.</p>

  <p>"We have every reason at least to think so," I reaffirmed. "As I told you,
  practically every step in this whole affair has been watched by the man from
  whom we come. In that watching we have had some little part. We are not
  making any accusation blindly."</p>

  <p>"But for Heaven's sake, Mr. Glace," he exclaimed, "you're asking me to
  believe that I've been the victim of a cowardly bit of work&mdash;that I've
  been tricked, deceived in every way, duped. And if you're right&mdash;" He
  paused and once more drew a deep and slightly unsteady breath. An expression
  of swift appreciation altered the entire cast of his features. "If you're
  right, I'm as sound as I ever was!</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Bryce asserted. "That's the point, the thing we've been tryin'
  to hammer into you, Lamb. It's the kernel in the nut."</p>

  <p>Lamb set his teeth. The muscles tensed in his cheeks till they showed as
  tightly knotted bundles. "But&mdash;this&mdash;drug?" he questioned,
  thickly.</p>

  <p>"Something which could be given to you gradually, and, once it had
  produced its intended effect, as gradually removed," I said.</p>

  <p>He stared into my face. His own was white, set, with those little corded
  muscle still bulging in his cheeks. "By God, I believe you mean it!" he
  suddenly rasped.</p>

  <p>"Of course we mean it!" Something akin to exasperation sounded in Jim's
  voice. "An' we're askin' you to give us a chance to prove it. What's the
  matter? Don't you fancy the notion, or what?"</p>

  <p>"Fancy it?" Suddenly Imer Lamb swayed, sank into a chair, and covered his
  face with his hands. I saw their fingers quiver. "Fancy it! Lord, if you knew
  what it means&mdash;what it means to me! It's nothing short of a pardon to a
  condemned man, the difference between life and death. It means life if it's
  true. Life&mdash;life&mdash;" His voice sank to a whisper and trailed off. He
  sat staring straight before him. It was as though he gazed into a future his
  final words had conjured up.</p>

  <p>"That you let us prove it true, Mr. Lamb, is all we ask," I broke the
  ensuing silence. "We bring you the invitation from a man who stands ready to
  explain everything that has happened. He asks you to accept, and Miss Mason
  asks it. Last night you refused her, but can you refuse her again
  today&mdash;this request of hers that you go with us and grasp the
  opportunity to be convinced?"</p>

  <p>"You know that, do you, that I refused her?" he asked as I paused.</p>

  <p>I nodded. "She told us this morning, Mr. Lamb. And she's worked for
  you&mdash;your interests all through this matter&mdash;worked.
  Now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm going with you." He stood up. At last I read belief in his eyes.
  "I want to be convinced&mdash;want to, do you understand me? But this thing
  is a shock. It staggered me, shook me up. I wasn't expecting it. But
  now&mdash;" He broke off.</p>

  <p>There was a sound of a heavy hand hammering against the door of the
  suite.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me a moment," Lamb said, and went to open the door.</p>

  <p>"Imer!" Bryce and I heard the sound of a heavy, excited masculine voice.
  "You're here! Thank the Lord! See here. I've got to see you, got to see you
  alone! I've just come from Moira."</p>

  <p>I glanced at Jim. I recognized the speaker despite his shaken tones, and I
  found recognition in my partner's face.</p>

  <p>Then Imer Lamb was speaking. "Well, just a minute, George. What the deuce
  is the matter with you?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you I've got to see you, got to see you now," his foster brother
  replied. "I was afraid I might miss you."</p>

  <p>"Just a minute," Imer stayed him. "Come in here." He closed the door and
  led George Lamb into the room where we sat. "I have visitors,
  George&mdash;Messrs. Glace and Bryce. Gentlemen, my brother, George
  Lamb."</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;yes. Glace and Bryce?" George Lamb was disheveled. He was
  perspiring freely; his collar was a wilted thing about his heavy neck; his
  face was actually livid as he turned his eyes upon us. "Er&mdash;glad to meet
  you gentlemen&mdash;again."</p>

  <p>"Again?" Quickly Imer Lamb appeared to seize on the word. "Oh, so you've
  met them before then, have you, George?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;yes," the brother said thickly. "Yes, Imer, I've met them. But
  see here&mdash;I've got something to tell you."</p>

  <p>"Suppose I know it already?" As he spoke I saw a full conviction form on
  Imer Lamb's face. It looked from between his narrowed lids as they marked his
  brother's perturbation. It sounded in his voice as he repeated: "Suppose I
  know it already, George?"</p>

  <p>And that quiet, almost accusing question left George Lamb puzzled; I could
  see that too. A half-frown formed on his sweating brow. "Know it already," he
  stammered, and then, as understanding came upon him. "You mean these two here
  told you, Glace and Bryce? You mean they were wise, came here to wise you
  up?"</p>

  <p>Imer Lamb nodded his head. He smiled, but there was not the slightest hint
  of humor in his act. Rather I thought it was the acceptance of a fact, the
  surrender of the last shred of unbelief, a sad thing that marked the final
  relinquishment of a faltering hope.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, George, they did come to see me about it," he said.
  "They came to ask me to go with them to a man who has been an unknown friend,
  while one I should have had every right to trust seems to have lent himself
  as partner to a rotten scheme against me."</p>

  <p>"Semi Dual, you mean Semi Dual!" George Lamb fairly shouted. "You mean
  their sidekick with the funny name sent 'em to you?" Guilt set its mark upon
  him as he stood there. It was in his entire bearing; it was in his voice.</p>

  <p>I glanced at Bryce. There was no question now but that George Lamb, true
  to his Uranian nature, had blown up. He stood there self-convicted by his
  guilty knowledge mirrored in his own words. And Moira Mason, Bo-Peep, had
  sent him. He had said so. She had followed Dual's directions, and this was
  the result.</p>

  <p>I felt Imer Lamb's glance upon me, met it, and nodded slightly. It shifted
  back to his brother. And then he spoke: "I didn't know his name before. They
  didn't tell me. But I am going to hear what he has to say about it. I had
  agreed to go before you got here. Hadn't you better come along?"</p>

  <p>The thing was more than a question; it was a command, a challenge. Imer
  Lamb, the man who had been an American "ace," who had within the last few
  days won himself the title of the "Mad Aviator" by his aerial antics, had
  regained control of himself. And George Lamb seemed to feel it.</p>

  <p>"Imer&mdash;" he said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"I think you had better go with us, George," his foster brother cut him
  off. "Very well, gentlemen. Suppose we start. Really it seems scarcely
  necessary now, so far as I am concerned; but common courtesy could scarcely
  dictate less."</p>

  <p>"Imer&mdash;I've hardly time," George Lamb began as Bryce and I rose.
  "I've quite a bit to attend to this afternoon. You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, if I was you I wouldn't bother telling Nathalia, George." Jim's
  suggestion cut off his words. "If you did she might tell that precious
  brother of hers that you'd spilled the beans, just like she probably told you
  what I said to her the other day on the street."</p>

  <p>"Brother?" Imer Lamb stiffened.</p>

  <p>"Nathalia Norton is Dr. Drake's sister," I advised.</p>

  <p>"George?" he swung back to the broker. Comprehension, sorrow, and
  something like loathing were in his face.</p>

  <p>George Lamb hung his head. His bearing became that of a chided culprit. He
  made no effort to meet his brother's eyes.</p>

  <p>Imer's jaw set again in decision. "Well, George, now more than ever I
  think you had best go with us. Come, gentlemen," he said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THE SHOWDOWN</h2>

  <p class="first">WE left the suite, and descended to where our taxi waited.
  The four of us entered the machine. I told the driver to take us back to the
  Urania. We were off.</p>

  <p>George Lamb sat slumped down in his seat; there was a certain spineless
  quality, about his heavy-set figure that spoke of an inward collapse. His
  former forceful, blustering demeanor had vanished. He did not speak.</p>

  <p>Nor did Imer Lamb speak either as we ran back to the heart of the city.
  Now and then I saw his glance turn to George, the man whom as a boy his
  father had taken, adopted, treated in every way as his own child, the man who
  had requited such treatment in the way it now appeared he had.</p>

  <p>Bryce lighted a cigar and smoked. I leaned back and waited. This was the
  end, I thought, of the strange, well-nigh invisible course the whole affair
  had run until now at the last, when things were to be explained, the picture
  was to be built up, by Semi Dual, the one who throughout it all had marked
  its veiled progress from first to last by the steady onward sweep on the face
  of the Clock of the Skies.</p>

  <p>The cab fought through the traffic, edged into the curb before the Urania,
  and stopped. We got out, paid our driver, went into the lofty foyer, and
  entered a cage.</p>

  <p>On the twentieth floor I led my companions out, and along the tiled
  corridor to the bronze-and-marble stairs.</p>

  <p>At their foot, Imer Lamb paused. I saw a quick comprehension in his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Up here?" he questioned.</p>

  <p>And when I nodded, went on. "This friend of yours is up here? I say,
  Glace, when I've been flying over, you know, I've seen something that looked
  like a garden on the roof."</p>

  <p>"It is," I told him, realizing how well he might have marked it from his
  plane, little dreaming even so what it was. We climbed the stairs, and came
  out at the top. The chimes rang out in the tower. Imer Lamb smiled with a
  fleeting appreciation of the beauty of that unexpected spot in the heart of
  the milling city, of the roses, the fountain where gray and white doves were
  preening themselves on the basin. I heard George Lamb draw a rasping
  breath.</p>

  <p>Then we were at the tower, and Henri was bowing slightly as he spoke in
  greeting: "Welcome, friends of the master. He awaits your coming. You are the
  last."</p>

  <p>"Henri!" Imer Lamb exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"M. Lamb," Henri returned. "One follows orders, monsieur. I trust monsieur
  understands."</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite." Imer nodded. We crossed the anteroom, passed the door of the
  room beyond, and paused.</p>

  <p>I myself, I may as well confess it, was surprised. Dual sat by his desk as
  was his custom, clad in his white and purple robes. But the room was
  otherwise occupied. Marya Harding, Moira Mason and Haddon, debonair and
  smiling, I saw; and Johnson, heavy-set, stolidly waiting, and Gladys Ashton,
  come forth now as it seemed from her period of recuperation in Marya's house,
  and Simpson, who nodded as his eyes met mine, and Joe Kingsley, who, as we
  appeared and as he saw his friend and former employer, half started from his
  seat, and sank back again with his eyes never shifting from his face.</p>

  <p>It was quite a jury before which, as I saw now, Semi Dual was to present
  the evidence in this matter which had in greater or less degree involved each
  in its course.</p>

  <p>He rose. "Welcome, Mr. Imer Lamb," he said "whom though I have never met
  before in the flesh I have come to know in a different fashion through those
  methods which it is given me to use. Welcome, since now it is come time for
  us to meet, and review the records of those things which have been, but which
  now are happily past."</p>

  <p>Imer Lamb bowed. "'I thank you, sir," he made answer. "And you will pardon
  me if I do not fully understand as yet. But I have brought my brother with
  me. It appeared to me that it was best." He glanced at George.</p>

  <p>"A needless precaution, but one which can alter nothing in the further
  course of this matter," Semi Dual replied.</p>

  <p>"So?" The word was a question. And as he spoke, I saw Imer Lamb's eyes run
  to Moira Mason, who sat on a heavily-cushioned couch. There was a place
  beside her, and he went toward it as the rest of us found seats.</p>

  <p>Dual picked up his auditors with his glance, "We are complete." He began
  speaking again in his bell-like voice, that in that moment some way reminded
  me of the intonations of a priest&mdash;a priest of justice, I thought, a
  priest of right, of high principle, integrity, truth&mdash;as he stood there
  in his vestments.</p>

  <p>"We are complete," he repeated, "save only Saturn, Neptune and Mars;
  Neptune who brought this matter to an issue, and Mars who carried out those
  things which Neptune designed. Yet are Neptune and Mars foredoomed to be
  smitten with the fiery sword of the Sun now that their scheming has led them
  within the path of its destroying arc.</p>

  <p>"And I to that end have assembled you here that you may understand how
  selfishness, treachery, double-dealing, disregard of the rights of others,
  greed, avarice, lust may bring the undoing of those who employ them,
  about.</p>

  <p>"In the beginning, my friends, I am one who reads the stars. Men's lives
  are a complex of influences of an electro-magnetic nature even as man's life
  is an electromagnetic thing, as science dominates the invisible, ceaselessly
  active electromagnetic quality of which all matter is composed.</p>

  <p>"Viewed so, my friends, each planet is but a center of electromagnetic
  force, of a quality polarized to itself, a quality which each radiates, the
  one to the other endlessly, And those radiations from one planet to another
  endlessly affect each of the material force forms which it supports.</p>

  <p>"Hence man's life is affected by the combined radiations active at the
  moment of his birth, and the further course of his life is, as we may say,
  polarized. Wherefore if one knows the hour of a man's birth and the position
  of the planets, the stars at that hour, then may one predicate upon that
  basis the events of that man's life. Am I clear?" He glanced at Imer
  Lamb.</p>

  <p>He inclined his head as he sat beside Bo-Peep. There was a tiny frown of
  concentration on his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Then to the practical demonstration." Semi Dual smiled. "In the
  beginning, Mr. Lamb, I set up a figure of the happening at Monk's Hall on the
  night when your affliction came upon you in full force, the influences of the
  actions of others against you, and the course of your life came as it were to
  a head. For no man lives to himself alone, my friends. The lives of this one
  and that one overlap, interlock. The life of another meeting yours may wholly
  alter it. So it is written, and experience proves it truth.</p>

  <p>"Also I erected astrological figures for the natal dates of you, Mr. Lamb,
  and of the woman beside you now, Miss Moira Mason, who brought the entire
  matter to my notice first. And I found your Mercury and your Moon afflicted
  by Saturn, by Neptune, by Mars, and by Uranus. And remember that each planet
  holds a quality of its own, a quality designed to produce certain effects.
  Saturn in this case would incline to nervous and mental conditions, epilepsy
  by day, insanity by night, perhaps."</p>

  <p>Moira Mason gasped. The sound whispered through the room.</p>

  <p>"You attacked your valet, Joseph Kingsley, at night, Mr. Lamb," Dual
  continued. "So much for that. Neptune rules drugs which strongly affect the
  nerves. Mars rules tobacco among drugs. It was this connection which made me
  first suspicious of the method employed against you when I learned that you
  smoked overmuch. Neptune and Mars&mdash;both evilly posited to your Mercury
  and Moon might well indicate that your tobacco was blended with a
  reason-destroying adulterant."</p>

  <p>Again a sound ran through the room, and turned all eyes on George Lamb
  where he sat, sheer horror and consternation on his face. It was not an
  articulate thing. It was more a groan, raucous, all-confessing, hoarse.</p>

  <p>"Wait," Dual spoke into the tensely ensuing silence that marked that
  self-betraying audition. "Wait, Uranus. Thou, too, wast evilly posited to thy
  brother's Mercury and Moon, and before this meeting is finished each planet I
  have named shall be identified as an individual present, or one who if not
  present still played his or her part.</p>

  <p>"From what I have said then, the case of Imer Lamb were hopeless, save
  that Venus, Jupiter, and the Sun throw their friendly rays toward his Mercury
  and Moon to give him aid. In this was his salvation which led me to predicate
  his full return to a normal mental balance in time, a time which has now
  arrived. And so to redeem a promise. I, Jupiter, have watched this matter
  from the beginning.</p>

  <p>"Jupiter is the arbiter, the judge; Jupiter is justice, who shall see
  justice done. Jupiter marks, watches, waits. And in this matter, Miss Moira
  Mason is Venus. Let Venus speak."</p>

  <p>All eyes turned on Bo-Peep as Semi paused.</p>

  <p>"I was terribly troubled when Mr. Lamb was arrested," she began her
  narrative. "And I went to Marya Harding, and she knew Mr. Dual and brought me
  to him, and he agreed to do all he could.</p>

  <p>"Then when Mr. Lamb was paroled to his brother I came and asked him if I
  couldn't get a special attendant for him, and he sent his own companion to be
  with him in that House of Invisible Bondage as he called Dr. Drake's
  place.</p>

  <p>"Henri went by his orders, and he watched, and one day Henri found an
  address in a waste paper basket in Dr. Drake's study, as Mr. Dual told me
  afterward. Then Dr. Drake told me I ought to go away; that it would be better
  for Imer if I were not here when he was released."</p>

  <p>"Moira!" Imer Lamb whispered harshly.</p>

  <p>She turned her eyes to him briefly, and smiled. "I told Mr. Dual about
  that, and he told me to go to Los Angeles. And he told me to try and learn
  what I could about Dr. Drake who had practiced there before he came here, and
  about Miss Nathalie Norton who had been a motion picture actress some years
  ago.</p>

  <p>"And he gave me this address Henri had found in the wastepaper basket, and
  told me that a man would call on me after I got to Los Angeles, and I should
  give it to him. So I went, although I hated to, because I felt it would seem
  very strange to Imer if I was, gone when he got out.</p>

  <p>"But Mr. Dual told me that by doing what he asked I could help Imer most.
  And maybe I did, because I found out that Dr. Drake had left Los Angeles
  because he had got into trouble there, and that Miss Norton is really his
  sister, Nathalie Drake, and Mr. Haddon, who is here today, hunted up the
  address of this man Henri found.</p>

  <p>"It was the address of a Mexican; he placed him under arrest after it was
  found he was raising and selling a certain drug. You see, the address Henri
  found was on the wrapper of a package of drugs Dr. Drake received from Los
  Angeles. And then I came back."</p>

  <p>"And from the first," Dual's voice came again before any one could speak
  in comment, "it was written that Venus should greatly aid. And what is to be
  will be, my friends. Herein as applying to Venus it stands verified.</p>

  <p>"Yet if one studies the conjoined charts of Imer Lamb and Venus one sees
  that the end is not yet, but that in the future as in that which is now past
  she shall aid him, should he keep her with him, and make her the influence in
  his life for which in every way she is fit."</p>

  <p>"Moira!" Imer Lamb whispered once more.</p>

  <p>She turned to him, reached out, and covered his hand with hers.</p>

  <p>He drew it into his.</p>

  <p>"And now, Henri," Semi prompted. "You have played a part, indicated
  already, yet not wholly."</p>

  <p>"The straw-gatherer," Bryce mumbled to me as Henri rose and advanced.</p>

  <p>"The master sent me as Miss Mason has said," he declared. "And I went.
  Certainment. I went, an' I watched. I was all eyes, all ears. I heard things;
  I saw thing.</p>

  <p>"My suspicion was intense. I found the address as it is said I found it.
  Antonio Moreno&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Saturn," Dual broke in to announce. "Saturn, a raiser and marketer of the
  drug, a drug many Mexicans mix with tobacco and smoke, a reason-destroying,
  murder-inducing drug which even robs the murderer of a recollection of the
  act after he has recovered from its influence. And did not Saturn afflict the
  Mercury and Moon of Mr. Lamb through the effects of the drug he raised?
  Proceed, my friend."</p>

  <p>"I found it as already stated," Henri resumed. "But I did something else.
  Mon Dieu, yes. As a spy I was a success. I found that the woman Nathalie
  Norton came often to the house. I found another woman&mdash;this young woman
  who sits here, Miss Gladys Ashton. I found she was being detained as a
  prisoner.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. She told me of her uncle who was paying to have her kept there.
  I learned her date of birth. I carried it to the master, and in the stars he
  read the truth that she was being held there without need, and being given
  drugs. Also I discovered that Dr. Drake mixed something with tobacco, and
  gave it to those in his house who smoked, and I managed to gather a little of
  that tobacco into my possession, and bring it to the master.</p>

  <p>"Also I went to see Imer Lamb's valet who was at his rooms. That was easy;
  I was now M. Lamb's attendant. I called at his rooms, and we had a talk. In
  the course of it I discovered I had no tobacco, and this valet of his kindly
  supplied me out of a quantity his master had left. But I smoked not all of
  it&mdash;oh, no. It, too, I brought to the master. And in both instances it
  contained the drug.</p>

  <p>"But that was not all. I listened as I have said, and I discovered what
  was in the life chart of Miss Ashton also, a danger to her life. It was a
  plot to destroy her I overheard, between&mdash;this Norton woman and Dr.
  Drake. Her uncle was financially ruined, what you call broke. No longer could
  he pay, and she knew too much of what went on in that house. So then I helped
  her escape. That is all of importance. Cest fins."</p>

  <p>It was all matching up, all working out. Step by step everything was
  coming now to the surface as each star, each planet, actually present, they
  or their satellites, those who had aided them in all that had been, step by
  step described his or her part.</p>

  <p>It was a bit weird, a bit odd, to sit there, and hear each speak as though
  a star itself had for the moment been endowed with a human voice, to see the
  picture growing so complete that one even saw how it had not mattered that
  Drake took away the evidence of the tobacco Kingsley had not smoked before
  Imer Lamb was released.</p>

  <p>"And now," said Semi Dual as Henri retired, "I shall ask Miss Gladys
  Ashton to take up the story which can but prove how the thread of one human
  life is interwoven with yet other lives. No man lives to himself alone.</p>

  <p>"And had not Imer Lamb entered the House of Invisible Bondage those things
  Henri has described as affecting her might well not have been
  discovered&mdash;and if not, she had died.</p>

  <p>"Yet today she is with us to furnish a further demonstration of how in
  selfishness, in blind self-seeking, are contained the fatal causes by which a
  man may be destroyed."</p>

  <p>He ceased, and Gladys Ashton fumbled in a little bead bag on her lap. From
  it she drew a letter, and held it in her hand as she told her story,
  sketching those facts I have already narrated until the time Bryce and I had
  left her at Marya Harding's house.</p>

  <p>"I've been there ever since," she said, "until today, when Inspector
  Johnson came and said Mr. Dual had sent him, and that I was to go with him to
  my uncle's attorneys in the Stroller Building. Marya and I went with him, and
  they gave me a letter, and I brought it with me. I'll read it, if you
  like."</p>

  <p>"Read it, Gladys," Semi prompted.</p>

  <p>And she nodded, drew several sheets of closely written paper from the
  envelope she held, and began:</p>

  <p>MY DEAR NIECE:</p>

  <p>I am a condemned man. My fellow men would condemn me if they knew, and I
  condemn myself. I am a cheat&mdash;a thief, and worse. I can write it down,
  because when you read it I shall be beyond any human law. I shall kill myself
  tonight.</p>

  <p>Gladys, at the time your mother died I was in desperate financial straits.
  And you were a child in experience in such matters as I knew, and in a state
  unfitting you for any cool judgment as a result of your mother's death. I
  came to you, and you know the rest.</p>

  <p>I met Dr. Drake&mdash;quite accidentally at that time&mdash;and mentioned
  your nervous condition, and he suggested that he see you. At that time, I
  swear, I had not thought of what I afterward did. But I did get you to give
  me a power of attorney, meaning to use what I needed of your money, and
  replace it later, the false hope of the gambler always.</p>

  <p>You will recall that your mother transferred her property to you before
  her death to avoid the necessity of probate proceedings. No one was concerned
  about it save you, and I, who needed money so badly, and the State, to whom
  an inheritance tax was due.</p>

  <p>I paid the inheritance tax out of your property, of course, and what few
  bills that were incurred as a result of your mother's illness and death. This
  done, I had a free hand, with you out of the way.</p>

  <p>It was Drake who suggested how easy it would be to keep you in his place.
  I don't know, but I think he had an inkling that things were going badly with
  me. Be that as it may, I agreed to his unholy scheme to keep you a prisoner,
  and use your money in my constantly failing efforts to recoup each succeeding
  loss.</p>

  <p>For I lost, Gladys, I lost, lost&mdash;always I lost. I am a broken man. I
  made a prisoner of you, Gladys, and then I made a prisoner of myself to
  Drake. He bled me white. His demands grew and grew, and I had to meet them; I
  dared not refuse&mdash;until I could no longer meet them.</p>

  <p>Then he&mdash;he is a fiend&mdash;he hinted that sometimes those in his
  institution grew sick, and died; and then he called me, and told me you had
  escaped. And I do not know&mdash;I may be a murderer, Gladys; this may never
  meet your eyes. I may have killed you, been the cause of your death at
  least.</p>

  <p>And so I am taking the one way out. There is a little something left, I
  think&mdash;not much, but maybe enough to keep you from want, if you still
  are alive. Heaven grant it that you are alive, and that it will prove enough.
  It is the last prayer of one who has wronged and betrayed every human trust
  he should have kept inviolate, before he goes to meet his God.</p>

  <p>Your uncle.</p>

  <p>JOHN PARKINS</p>

  <p>"That's all," Gladys Ashton said as she folded it up. "It's&mdash;very
  sad."</p>

  <p>"Good told me today that as far as he could tell the money end of that
  prayer was apt to be answered, though he couldn't say how far," Johnson said,
  speaking for the first time.</p>

  <p>Moira Mason wiped her eyes.</p>

  <p>It was another bit in the story. It was an odd posthumous sort of revenge
  John Parkins had taken on the man who had persuaded him into his clutches,
  and then blackmailed him to the last. I let my eyes run about the room. There
  was understanding, and a sort of grim anticipation on each face I met. And
  there was a sort of growing horror on the face of George Lamb where he
  sat.</p>

  <p>"And now, Mr. Haddon," Semi prompted.</p>

  <p>Haddon nodded. "That helps to check up this end of it," he replied. "As
  for my end, there isn't much. Mr. Dual located me, and wired me to look up
  Miss Mason in Los Angeles. I did so. She gave me an address. It was that of a
  Mexican who had a little truck farm, a market garden. But along with the
  other stuff he was raising was a patch of this marihuana&mdash;"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; AS THE STARS FORETOLD</h2>

  <p class="first">"MARIHUANA!" Bryce erupted gruffly.</p>

  <p>"Marihuana, yes, Mr. Bryce," Semi said, "a drug which produces a homicidal
  mania in those who indulge in its continued use, the drug which was found in
  the tobacco my friend and trusted companion Henri obtained both from the
  rooms of Mr. Imer Lamb, and from Dr. Hugo Drake's house. Pardon the
  interruption, Mr. Haddon."</p>

  <p>"I think the fact is sufficient, and is appreciated by every one present.
  Antonio Moreno was arrested, and incidentally a letter to him from Dr. Hugo
  Drake was intercepted. That letter was answered to the effect that no further
  supply of the drug could be forwarded at the present, and Antonio signed it
  to that effect at my request." Once more Haddon smiled.</p>

  <p>"An' after he got that letter Drake turned loose a couple of other
  patients besides Lamb!" Jim exclaimed in sudden comprehension of what might
  have lain back of the fact he announced, a sudden shortage in the supply of
  the subtle drug Drake was using, the drug that rendered and kept men
  insane.</p>

  <p>"And perchance he deemed it best to do so, once Miss Ashton had escaped
  beyond his control, and he knew not her whereabouts," Semi said. "As to him,
  and, his institution of illegal and dishonest practice Dr. Simpson has still
  more information to give."</p>

  <p>Simpson nodded. He cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"Both illegal and dishonest," he declared. "Dr. Dual, after we had met,
  asked me what I knew about Drake, and I told him little except that he was
  unpopular with the regular profession. But even so, I never suspected the
  truth of what was going on right under our eyes until following my first
  conversation with Dr. Dual. I determined to investigate.</p>

  <p>"Then it wasn't long until I had uncovered Drake, and was ready to proceed
  against him any time our friend here gave the word. Putting it briefly, Drake
  isn't any more a doctor than one of these fakers that used to stand around
  the corners with a banjo player under a gasoline torch, while they peddled
  patent lotions and pills.</p>

  <p>"The school he claims to have graduated from is a school all right, but he
  never graduated, let alone attended it. His diploma is a forged document. Dr.
  Hugo Drake, as he calls himself, is a diploma-mill graduate. It was easy
  enough for me to find out from the registrar of Waburn College.</p>

  <p>"His name does not appear on his lists of either graduates or
  matriculates, but you know what a tear-up there was about this diploma-mill
  business, and I ran out that part of it. Some of the people arrested in
  connection with that business kept records of their own, and Drake's name is
  on one of those. Well, that fixes his standing as a 'doctor,' and, of course,
  makes illegal any professional work he attempts in this State."</p>

  <p>"Wherein once more a man's double-dealing has, like an uncertain tool,
  turned in his hand against him," Semi said as Simpson ceased.</p>

  <p>I glanced at Jim, and saw he understood. Not merely to care for Gladys
  Ashton had Semi contrived his meeting with Simpson, but to inspire him to
  investigate Drake's professional standing, which as both an accredited member
  of the profession, and a man in touch with the police of the city he very
  easily could. He met my glance, and nodded in what I took for
  comprehension.</p>

  <p>Dual's voice went on: "Thus, my friends, the picture grows; thus is its
  every light and shadow brought out. It is not a pleasant picture, this; yet
  thus was it painted by those responsible for it in their own acts. Joseph
  Kingsley, have you perhaps something to add to it?"</p>

  <p>Joe Kingsley rose, and came a step or two forward with his halting walk.
  To me it seemed that he did so in order that as he spoke be might still keep
  his eyes on Imer Lamb's face.</p>

  <p>"Hi 'aven't much to sye," he began in his cockney fashion. "But Hi ain't
  goin' to pass the chance to sye a word. Hit's a rum go&mdash;ha rum go.
  Though Hi didn't know 'arf 'ow rum hit was till Doc Simpson 'ere told me
  arfter Hi was in th' county 'orspital, w'ere Hi've been since.</p>

  <p>"But 'es a w'ite man, Doc Simpson, an' Mr. Dual 'ere, 'e's a prince.
  Arfter that Hi seen hit, hof course. Arfter Mr. Himer was took away Hi did
  smoke that baccy, never dreaming there was hanythink wrong with the stuff.
  Gor blyme, there waren't nuthin' to do but smoke. Hi smoked hand looked
  arfter 'is things, hand took 'em hover 'ere to Drake's, as 'e needed 'em fill
  the day w'en Drake come hand arsked me for what was left of the baccy hand
  said Hi was fired, 'cause hit wouldn't be good for Mr. Himer to 'ave me
  around arfter 'e was turned hout."</p>

  <p>"He told you that did he, Joe?" Imer Lamb asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yus, sir." Kingsley nodded. "Them was halmost 'is very words."</p>

  <p>"And they told me you'd left me, Joe, after I was out and asked about you,
  told me you'd left because you, were afraid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Afraid, sir&mdash;me, w'o did me bit in the war, w'o never turned tail
  yet&mdash;afraid? Why, Gorblast their bloody, rotten 'earts for bleatin'
  liars!"</p>

  <p>"Here, here," Imer stayed him. "They did lie, Joe, but it's all right now.
  You're coming back, old fellow; you're coming back, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Hi am&mdash;" The two men looked upon one another. "You're jolly well
  right hi ham, sir, hand thankin' you for th' chance." And suddenly with a
  touch of the dramatic I had not expected, he drew himself up, soldierwise at
  attention, and snapped through a hand salute.</p>

  <p>And Imer Lamb returned it before Kingsley hobbled back to his seat. Some
  way it brought a sudden tightness, a sudden ache into my throat.</p>

  <p>And then again Dual was speaking again: "And now, thou Uranus. Thus have
  the friendly planets, the friendly satellites of those planets, those who
  aided them in their troubles or their endeavors, spoken save only my two
  friends, Glace and Bryce. Yet have they worked under my personal direction
  and their words could but duplicate those we have already heard.</p>

  <p>"But thou," he addressed George, "thou are of those who have threatened in
  the life chart of the man I have considered, yea even from the first. And
  thou art here among us since now, as I think the evil influence of thy
  position in this matter has run out, even as perchance the evil of thy first
  intent has within the past few days drained from thy heart. You have sat
  among us, and heard what has been said. Say thou then whether truly or
  falsely have those who have spoken borne witness. Speak, Uranus, speak."</p>

  <p>George Lamb stirred. The attention of every one in the room was focused
  upon him in a flash. He lifted his head, His face was a sickly pallor, the
  whites of his eyes showed reddened between their lids. "There isn't much I
  can say. Most of it's been said already. I'm guilty," he began with a visible
  effort at last, "though Heaven knows this thing went a lot farther than I
  meant it should when I went into it.</p>

  <p>"Some of what's been said I knew, and some of it I did not. All I meant to
  do really was to keep Imer from marrying. That's the truth. You know his
  money as well as mine is in our business, and if he died without an heir,
  why, I'd inherit it, or if I dropped off first it would be his.
  So&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So that was it, was it?" Imer interrupted. "Well, you would have got it
  this afternoon if this conference hadn't come up. Hard luck,
  George&mdash;hard luck!"</p>

  <p>"Don't!" Suddenly George Lamb whimpered. "I didn't want it, that way. I
  didn't want it. I don't want it, damn it!"</p>

  <p>His voice cracked, broke. "I didn't, I tell you. I've proved it. I went to
  Moira last night, and told her she'd got to stop you, and today again I went
  to her after she telephoned me she'd failed, and told her to marry you, do
  anything to keep you from goin, up this afternoon in any more of those fool
  flying stunts of yours.</p>

  <p>"I told her&mdash;begged her to marry you; I all but went down on my
  knees. And she sent me to you, and I came. That's how I come to be here. I
  came to tell you, stop you&mdash;confess." He broke off, and sat panting like
  one who had run a long distance.</p>

  <p>"And how," came the voice of Semi Dual, "did you come also to think of the
  plan you put into operation first?"</p>

  <p>Lamb turned his bloodshot eyes to him. "I didn't," he declared.
  "I&mdash;just told Na&mdash;a friend of mine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hugo Drake's sister, your intimate friend." Semi forced the issue upon
  him.</p>

  <p>He nodded. "Yes. I told Nathalie about Imer's engagement, and said I
  wished there was some way to keep him from marrying Moira or anybody else.
  And she&mdash;she suggested that she talk things over with her brother. You
  know the rest.</p>

  <p>"He told me it could be done without permanent damage to Imer, that he
  would furnish me the tobacco already mixed with the drug. I told Imer about
  the new blend I had discovered, and I smoked it too; I really did, only mine
  wasn't mixed with the stuff like his.</p>

  <p>"I got him to try it, and he liked it, and then the rest happened and
  everything seemed working out all right, though Glace and Bryce here did come
  to see me, and afterwards Bryce stopped Nathalie on the street, and it
  worried me a bit.</p>

  <p>"Drake didn't like Imer having a special attendant either. But Mrs.
  Harding and Moira insisted, and there didn't seem to be any reasonable way
  for us to refuse, and we didn't think any one could really suspect.</p>

  <p>"You see, Drake had got onto the stuff when he was in California, and we
  fancied it safe. Our plan was to get Imer off it while Drake had him, and
  then to turn him loose after telling him he was all right unless his trouble
  should recur. We figured that would keep him from marrying.</p>

  <p>"I knew him&mdash;I knew he wouldn't take a chance on marriage, on having
  children with&mdash;a thing like that hanging over his head. But when he
  started trying to commit suicide in that plane of his I blew up. I hadn't
  counted on that. I ain't a Cain&mdash;and I wasn't trying to kill him; I
  didn't want him to be killed. I didn't&mdash;as the Lord is my witness!"</p>

  <p>"Nay," said Semi Dual, "I do not think so, nor have I thought so.
  Wherefore I have not included you in those against whom the law shall take
  its course&mdash;save only the higher law which says that by a man's actions
  shall he be judged, under which, as it chances, a man ofttimes judges himself
  to the end that he continueth in the path he has followed, or deciding it
  unworthy, decides further to alter his course. But Saturn, Neptune and
  Mars&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Through the course of the whole proceeding from the time he had greeted
  Imer Lamb he had been seated. Now he rose as a judge might rise in passing
  sentence.</p>

  <p>"Saturn already in durance, and Neptune, poisoner of men's minds, ruler of
  poisonous drugs. Neptune, Nathalie Norton, Nathalie Drake, the adventuress.
  Neptune secretive, scheming, crafty, who in this affair stands as the guilty
  one&mdash;the primal cause, who devised this plan to dethrone a man's reason
  if no more than for a time, that she might profit by it perchance, who
  conceived this unholy plan by which a man was turned against his benefactor's
  child, debauching others and herself debauched.</p>

  <p>"Neptune and Mars who aided and abetted her in her treacherous scheming;
  against them the Sun, which is the law in this affair, shall strike with a
  flaming sword; the law of man as well as the law of God shall take its
  course. Mr. Johnson&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Johnson stiffened as his name rang out. It was as though he came to
  attention at a commanding voice.</p>

  <p>"And you, Mr. Haddon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Haddon nodded. His lips twitched in a faintly comprehending smile.</p>

  <p>"You are the law in this matter. Go; do your duty. Lay hands upon this
  guilty Mars and Neptune, brother and sister in iniquity as in the flesh, go
  seize them and haul them before the bar of justice, that the law may have its
  will of them, because of their unlawful acts. Go now, at once. They are
  waiting for you; they shall not escape, inasmuch as since the day when
  Antonio Morena, Saturn, was apprehended without their knowing they have been
  watched."</p>

  <p>Watched? Now I understood the smile that still lingered on Haddon's lips.
  That had been a part of his participation. He had provided against Drake or
  his sister succeeding in any endeavor to escape. They had been watched by
  unseen eyes, their every move marked. It was so the Federal service
  worked.</p>

  <p>Johnson was on his feet. Haddon got up. They were men assigned to an
  errand; one felt it would be carried out. They were men, but it seemed they
  were more than that. They were the Sun, the Law, the visible, tangible
  symbols of an eternal, never to be escaped force, a power as eternal as the
  stars themselves by which the mandates of the law were carried out.</p>

  <p>"All right then, we'll get 'em," Johnson's voice came gruffly in a pledge
  of a mission to be fulfilled. "Good afternoon, folks."</p>

  <p>Followed by Haddon, unruffled, still slightly smiling, he stalked out.</p>

  <p>A sigh ran through the room, a relaxing of tension, a release of
  half-bated breathing. It was as though now at the end of the past hour, we
  who still sat there were slipping back into the normal grooves, the normal
  channels of everyday life.</p>

  <p>For this was the climax. We had met, we had spoken together, and the
  verdict had been reached. The Sun, toward the carrying out of that verdict,
  had gone forth to strike.</p>

  <p>Soon that House of Invisible Bondage in which the slaves of an invisible
  bondage had been held chained by unlawful means, doubly enslaved by a crafty,
  conscienceless schemer, would be as though it had never been. Its unholy
  secret, its invisible menace, was at last unveiled.</p>

  <p>Imer Lamb sat here beside woman he loved, the woman of his choice, his
  mate. He had been freed from that invisible bondage which others had forced
  upon him by means of an illicit drug. This then was the end.</p>

  <p>And once more Semi's voice: "Wherefore, Venus, here is the ending, and the
  beginning. For as the present runs imperceptibly into the past, so does the
  future melt ever imperceptibly into the present, and what the future shall be
  depends wholly upon what we make of it in the present. Man is exalted or
  destroyed by his own just or unjust acts."</p>

  <p>And as though his words were a signal for dismissal, those he had gathered
  together looked not at him, but at one another, stirred, shifted, and
  rose.</p>

  <p>"Joe," I heard Imer Lamb speaking, "go on over to the rooms and stick
  around. I'll be back sometime, and we'll have a jolly good talk." He tossed a
  bunch of keys to Kingsley, who caught them and went out with a smile upon his
  face.</p>

  <p>Henri went with him.</p>

  <p>Simpson glanced at his watch, shook hands with Dual and left.</p>

  <p>Then Marya was speaking to Semi. I caught her words: "You're just the
  same&mdash;just the same as you were; you never change. You're as immutable,
  as sure, as right as your own stars."</p>

  <p>"Because I read them, Marya, friend," I heard him answer.</p>

  <p>And then. "Well, Bo-Peep, you got your Lamb back, but&mdash;after
  listenin' to what's been said, I dunno&mdash;looks more like he'd been a
  goat." Jim's voice boom out as he crossed to where Moira and Imer stood.</p>

  <p>Imer Lamb frowned slightly, uncomprehendingly, and Moira laughed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Bryce calls me Bo-Peep, because she lost her sheep, you know,
  Imer. And I rather like the fancy."</p>

  <p>And then she turned to Jim. "Just so, I've got him again, Mr. Bryce, I
  don't care what he is. And now I've got him I'm going to keep him." Her
  fingers curled themselves in a possessive way on Imer's arm.</p>

  <p>I heard a lagging footfall behind me, half turned, and looked into the
  bloodshot eyes of his foster brother.</p>

  <p>"Imer?" he said thickly.</p>

  <p>Imer turned his head, but did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Imer," George Lamb repeated. "I-I just want to tell you I'm glad. I've
  lived in hell the last few weeks. I got into it, boy&mdash;and I couldn't get
  out. I had to go through. They had me where they wanted me, Imer. I think
  maybe they meant to keep me where they wanted me, if this hadn't turned out
  as it did&mdash;just like they kept Parkins where they wanted him till he
  killed himself. So I'm glad, boy, glad, and I'd like to be best man."</p>

  <p>"George!" Imer's voice was grating, harsh, yet even so, a bit
  unsteady.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Imer, let him," Moira pleaded, with a sound half sob, half laughter,
  in the words.</p>

  <p>We stood in a well of silence. Without our realizing it, the voices of
  those around us had ceased. Then into it Semi's words dropped plummet
  like:</p>

  <p>"Let her guide you, her by whose efforts you are saved. Let her guide you
  now, and in the future. She will not lead you astray, so that you let her
  hold you in the bonds of love. For love is truly the activating, motivating
  force of the universe itself. Only those who deny it are destroyed."</p>

  <p>"It won't be difficult. It won't be difficult." Imer Lamb looked down deep
  into the lifted blue eyes of the girl who raised them to his. And then he
  laughed out, shrugged like a man who casts a clogging weight from his
  shoulders, and turned again to his brother.</p>

  <p>"All right, George," he said.</p>

  <p>EPILOGUE</p>

  <p>Once more the headlines flared the following morning.</p>

  <p>DR. HUGO DRAKE, NATHALIE NORTON ARRESTED</p>

  <p>And the minute I got to the office Jim came in with the paper, of
  course.</p>

  <p>"Well, they got them, I see," I said.</p>

  <p>"Got 'em. Of course they got 'em. Them two was slated for gettin'," he
  declared.</p>

  <p>I nodded. It is hard indeed for the guilty to escape when the Law, the
  Sun, turns the light of his vengeance upon them, and strikes with a flaming
  sword.</p>
