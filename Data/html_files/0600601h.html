    <p>
      Someone had asked Mary Viner as a child why she so disliked
      going to school, and had received the pregnant reply: "'Cos
      one does the same thing every day"; and at the age of
      three-and-twenty Mary was still resenting repetition. Only
      more so, because life had become more busily full of it, a
      circus of dreary tidyings and cleanlinesses, of washings up
      and washings down, of moments that smelt of yellow soap,
      and tea leaves and paraffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, it could not be helped. And the turning of the
      domestic wheel demanded the obedient hands of the dutiful
      daughter. Mary's alarum clock set the welkin ringing at
      half-past six. It was winter, January and cold. She had
      cause to know how cold it could be in that cardboard box of
      a bedroom with its walls of tile and plywood sheeting. The
      very clock seemed to make a bouncing sound like a pea
      rattling in a box. The room remained quite dark, and the
      day's duties offered her no compensations for the loss of
      her warm bed, so she lingered there, guiltily snug, the
      clothes pulled up to her chin, her pretty, slim legs tucked
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank heaven she had not to struggle with half a yard of
      black hair. A bobbed head had its advantages when your
      hands got colder and colder. The house was very still, but
      across the landing there travelled a faint sound of harsh,
      asthmatic breathing. Captain Hesketh Viner was still
      asleep, but soon she would hear the little twittering voice
      of her mother, like the voice of a rather futile and busy
      bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      O, this house--this "Green Shutters," where everything was
      heard, from the stirring of the kitchen fire to the brisk
      functioning of a toothbrush! And her father's cough! She
      flung out of bed suddenly with a rush of fastidious despair
      that fought with an inarticulate compassion. What a life
      for the three of them, cooped up in this jim-crack cottage
      in a little world of other jim-crack cottages! No wonder
      that Carslake, solid Georgian Carslake, referred to the
      Sandihurst Estate as "Cinder Town."
    </p>
    <p>
      She lit her candle and scuffled into her clothes, intent
      upon making that morning dash downstairs to light the fires
      in the kitchen and living-room. Yes, damn Colonel Sykes for
      exploiting this patch of clay and sand in Sussex, and for
      persuading the new poor to put up cottages and bungalows.
      Cinder Town! She slithered down the steep and narrow stairs
      and into the kitchen, jarring a slim ankle against the
      coal-scuttle that was standing where it should not have
      stood. And that, too, was her fault! Resenting this, she
      jabbed at the thing with her foot, and by way of retort it
      tipped a rattling stream of coal upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting her candle on the kitchen table, and bending down
      to recover the lumps of coal, she signalized her submission
      to the tyranny of trifles by a sudden rush of tears. There
      was anger in her tears, and self-pity, and the rebellion of
      her youth against life's aimless and inevitable
      repetitions. But how foolish! And like a child she brushed
      the blurring wetness away with her fingers, forgetting the
      coal dust upon them. She put a match to the kitchen fire,
      wondering whether it was going to prove sulky, and while it
      was deciding that it would burn she collected the cans for
      the morning's hot water. And how she yearned for gas! To be
      able to slip down and turn a tap, and perhaps slip back to
      bed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hands of the grandfather clock stood at twenty past
      seven when Mary crossed the little hall between the kitchen
      and the living-room. There was that second fire to be laid
      and lit; the kitchen fire she had laid the night before,
      and if there was one thing she loathed it was cleaning out
      a grate on a cold winter morning. A beastly job, remaining
      eternally beastly! Picking out pieces of slag and cinder
      and dropping them into the housemaid's box! She pulled on
      her gloves, and kneeling, was about to start on the grate
      when she heard the spring-bell attached to the front door
      burr loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It startled her. No one was to be expected at this hour but
      that very red-nosed boy with the milk, and he always came
      to the back door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to investigate, drawing back the plain black bolts
      and turning the key of the cheap lock. She opened the door
      and saw a man there. A milk-can kept him company on the
      doorstep. He made no remark. He looked at one of her gloved
      and empty hands as though he had expected to see a jug in
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the milk."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared and he seemed to stare still harder, for she had
      black smudges all over her face. And then she realized
      somehow that this was Furze, of Doomsday Farm, and that he
      was in a hurry, and that something must have happened to
      the red-nosed boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll get a jug."
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning, she was aware of him in the dim light as
      something big and brown and silent, with a pair of very
      dark eyes set deeply under the brim of his hat. His face
      had ruggedness. It was clean-shaven, but she could see that
      he had not shaved this morning. His lips were very firm.
      The breadth of the face seemed to match the breadth of the
      man, the loose-limbed, easy breadth of the worker. When he
      took the jug from her she noticed the fineness of his
      hands, delicate even in their roughened strength. He bent
      down to fill the jug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened to the boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Laid up."
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was deliberate and deep, and his eyes seemed to
      match his voice. He was looking at her again, a pretty,
      dark thing in an old cherry-coloured jumper and black
      skirt. Those smudges of coal dust on her face might have
      amused him had he been the sort of man who was easily
      amused, but his glances went deeper. A pretty girl--and a
      gentlewoman--cleaning a grate on a January morning! Why
      shouldn't she? He handed her the jug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will that do for the day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were on his big brown hands. Standing there under
      the flimsy rustic porch, he seemed to fill the whole of the
      sky with a significance that puzzled her. He did not belong
      to Cinder Town; he was part of that other world that had
      preceded and would outlast a little collection of bungalows
      and rustic porches.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it will do. I expect you are busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up the milk-can, half lifted his hat, and with
      another of those deep and curiously silent glances, he
      swung away down the cinder path. He closed the white gate
      behind him and turned to the right towards the Jamieson's
      cottage--Oak Lodge. Mary hated the Jamiesons, and
      especially the Jamieson children.
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed the door, carried the milk-jug into the kitchen,
      and completed the resuscitation of the sitting-room fire.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      2
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mary placed the can of hot water on the mat outside her
      people's door. She knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A quarter to eight."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father began to cough, and she could picture his poor
      bald, birdlike head growing pink on its thin neck. These
      spasms of coughing seemed to shake the flimsy little house,
      and with it the whole futile world of her daily endeavour.
      Her mother's voice, twittering like a robin's, caused her
      to pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary, dear, your father will have his breakfast in bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      A tray to be laid as well as a table! Well, what of it? If
      drudgery were your lot, complete submergence did not
      matter. She carried her own can of hot water into her
      bedroom, and pulling up the blind, discovered to herself in
      place of a dead white surface a panel picture of surprising
      beauty. It was strange and unexpected, and it hurt her, and
      she wondered why it hurt. She stood and looked at a red
      winter sun and a smoking mass of blue grey clouds, and dark
      hills, and woods spiring up. She could see the great knoll
      of beeches purpling the sky above "Doomsday," the
      mysterious and black stateliness of the "Six Firs," and
      beyond them the aery tops of a larch plantation. It was
      very beautiful and sad and strange, with colour tossed
      about, and that red sun edging the clouds with gold. It
      hurt her. It made her yearn for all sorts of unimaginable
      things, escape, romance, dreamy happenings, a world other
      than her own. Her sensitive youthfulness stretched out its
      quivering hands to beauty, and felt the choke of it in its
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked into her mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heavens!"
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder the man with the milk had stared. She was all
      smudged under the eyes with coal dust. She saw herself as a
      flustered little drab, a seven o'clock in the morning
      slattern too hurried to be clean. She went red in the face
      of her own reflection. Beauty--and that smudged skin! A
      kind of rage seized her. She splashed the hot water into
      her basin, and soaped and gloved and towelled herself
      before rushing downstairs with a red nose and eyes, and a
      sense of being driven to do a dozen things at once. More
      coal had to be put on the fires, the frying pan greased,
      the kettle filled, the cloths laid on tray and table; cups
      and saucers, spoons, plates, mustard, bread, butter,
      marmalade to be collected. And while she hurried about, and
      was aware of the clatter of her harried handling of all
      these articles, she remembered that an hour hence she would
      be washing up the greater number of them and putting them
      back in their places.
    </p>
    <p>
      O,--that washing up, that eternal getting out and putting
      away! Repetition, endless repetition! The woman's part! And
      she seemed to feel in the core of her consciousness the
      passionate impulse to escape from it. Yes, from that
      tyranny of trifles that seemed to her to be the whole end
      and tragedy of a woman's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard a door open. Her mother was coming downstairs,
      that little brown chaffinch of a mother with her
      "pink-pink" voice and her little beak of a nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father will have a lightly boiled egg--this morning.
      And some--toast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--some toast."
    </p>
    <p>
      So there would be toast and a lightly boiled egg as well as
      the bacon! And while she bustled about, her mother sat on a
      stool in front of the living-room fire, rubbing her red
      knuckled and thin little hands. Mrs. Viner was subject to
      chilblains. She had a stagnant circulation and a habit of
      inertia which did not fit her birdlike appearance, and yet
      it was a cheerful, twittering inertia. She perched there
      just like a young old bird waiting for the breakfast worm,
      intent upon rubbing her cold hands, while her daughter did
      all the work, and wondered why she did it. Their tacit
      acceptance of the situation was the most depressing part of
      the whole business; her parents took everything for
      granted; they were so patient and sweet and unseeing. They
      exercised their claims upon her with such complete
      confidence that sometimes she wished that she had been born
      with her sister Clare's temper and her determination to get
      out of the devoted niceness of it all. While she--with that
      fatal softness--and a sensitive desire to please--and an
      uncomfortable habit of self criticism--!
    </p>
    <p>
      She thrust the prongs of the toasting-fork--another thing
      to clean by the way--into a slice of bread, and crouched in
      front of the kitchen fire. She was a slim thing, with long
      legs and a willowy neck, large dark eyes set wide apart, a
      wavy and poignant mouth, and one of those noses with a
      delicate breadth at the nostrils which somehow give an
      expression of pathos to a woman's face. She could flush
      quickly and look scared. In repose she was inclined to
      droop her shoulders and sit with her arms wrapped about her
      knees, as though life was a cold and dreary business and
      her brown eyes saw nothing but woe. But, as a matter of
      fact, she was a strong young wench, supple and healthy,
      with plenty of red blood, only there was nothing to set it
      moving as a young thing's blood should move. Her starved,
      beggar-maid look was due to the fact that two old people
      were contentedly sucking her vitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The toast grew brown and she thought of Clare; flaxen
      haired, restless, mercurial Clare. Yes, Clare had been
      selfishly wise. She had insisted on self, and none too
      gently either. Hence a husband, and a house at Weyfleet in
      Surrey, and tennis and bridge-parties and dances, and
      shoppings and matinées in town, and two servants, and early
      tea brought to you in bed. Clare appeared to have ascended
      into a suburban heaven. Her letters were full of
      happenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The toast fell off the fork into the ash tray under the
      grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--damn!" said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recovered it, and with a sigh of momentary moral
      slackness she replaced it on the fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary,--dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, mother--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there any honey? Your father--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no honey. I'll order some. I shall have to bike
      up to Carslake presently."
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, breakfast was served both upstairs and downstairs,
      though Mary could never bring herself to look with any
      pleasure at Captain Hesketh Viner in bed. He wore a grey
      flannel nightshirt, and his poor old chin would be all
      silver stubble. There were times when she felt deplorably
      sorry for her father, even when his coughing kept her
      awake. Her mother was very talkative at breakfast; she
      rattled things and was very busy with her knife and fork.
      She had a high colour, and pretty grey crinkly hair, and
      brown eyes that were much smaller than Mary's, eyes that
      never seemed to see anything larger than pin-heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      And who was that at the door this morning? Had not she
      heard a man's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--Mr. Furze with the milk."
    </p>
    <p>
      And what had happened to the milk boy?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Laid up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Influenza--I suppose," said Mrs. Charlotte, tapping away
      cheerfully, "and what is Mr. Furze like? I thought his
      voice sounded almost gentlemanly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary heard her father's stick rapping on the floor of the
      room above.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect I have forgotten something."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she went up to see what it was.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold Furze of "Doomsday" had paused for a moment where
      the Melhurst and Rotherbridge roads join each other at an
      acute angle and become the road to Carslake, for though his
      day's work began before dawn and went on after dusk he was
      one of those men who can spare his soul five minutes. A
      hundred yards farther up the Carslake road his farm lane
      emerged north of the bank where the Six Firs grew, and on
      reaching the lane he left his empty milk-can by the hedge,
      and climbed up beside the trunk of one of the six old
      trees. Far above his head their outjutting green tops
      swayed very gently against the cold blue sky. Rabbits had
      been nibbling the short grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze stood there, seeming to look at nothing in
      particular, as much a part of the country as the trees. The
      rising sun lay behind him. It sent forth a yellow finger
      and laid it upon that splodge of chequered colour, those
      abominable little dwellings that dotted the Sandihurst
      Estate. There were thirteen of them, strung on each side of
      the cinder track that Colonel Sykes had had made between
      his red and white bungalow and the road to Melhurst. They
      looked just like a collection of big red, white, yellow,
      green and brown fungi, excrescences, each squatting on its
      quarter acre or so of land, and surrounded by lesser
      excrescences that were tool-sheds, chicken-houses, and here
      and there a little tin-roofed garage. Furze knew every one
      of the thirteen dwellings, though he had not walked up the
      cinder road more than six times in his life. He supplied
      the colony with milk and eggs and cordwood and an
      occasional load of manure. His bills went in once a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a collection," he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were of all shapes and all sizes, and they agreed in
      nothing but in their flimsy newness. Colonel Sykes' red
      brick and rough cast bungalow headed the formation like a
      field officer mounted and leading his company up the hill.
      Oak Lodge, a mock oak and plaster cottage in the Tudor
      style, contained the Jamiesons, who manufactured jam up at
      Carslake. Next to it stood "Green Shutters," the home of
      the Viners, half brick and half tile and pink as a boiled
      prawn. Following south came the "Oast," a pathetic
      improvisation contrived out of a circular steel shelter
      with an old railway-coach attached to it, the whole painted
      a bright green, and inhabited by one-eyed ex-lieutenant
      Harold Coode. In his hurry to recoup himself after his
      speculation in land, Colonel Sykes had sold the plots
      without troubling himself about building restrictions. Next
      to the "Oast" the Perrivales had built themselves "Two
      Stories" in yellow brick. "The Pill Box," a cement block
      structure, looking like a white box with four red chimney
      pots placed on it, belonged to Mr. John Brownlow--a retired
      schoolmaster. The Engledews lived in the "Lodge," by the
      Melhurst road. On the west side of the cinder canal the
      buildings were even more amateurish and ephemeral. Lieut.
      Peabody had placed two Nissen huts side by side, painted
      them red, joined the fronts with a white veranda, and
      christened the creation "Old Bill." The Vachetts--literary
      people and very desultory at that, inhabited a red and
      white bungalow, "Riposo." The Clutterbucks had had to be
      content with a big corrugated iron hut that resembled a
      football pavilion or a mission hall. Commander Troton owned
      "The Bungalow," brown stained weather board and pink
      pantiles. Lieut. Colonel Twist had put up a chalet and
      called it what it was. The Mullins' had shown a sense of
      humour in calling their cement box "Pandora," for it was
      full of children and prams, and rag dolls and trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze's very deep blue eyes seemed to question the
      significance of this colony. He considered it as a native
      might speculate upon some sudden growth of alien haste,
      and, as he scrambled down into the lane and picked up his
      milk can, his thoughts remained with Cinder Town. He saw in
      it one of those improvisations flung up by the confused
      flux of the post-war period. The new poor! The relics of a
      superfluous generation dumped down among Sussex clay.
      Impoverished gentlefolk drawn together in a little world of
      makeshifts, and keeping up appearances--of a sort. Rootless
      people, withering, waiting to die. It was rather pathetic.
      What on earth did they do with themselves in those little
      transitory houses on their quarter-acre plots, without a
      decent tree on the estate, and the very road a squdge of
      clay and clinker? Keep a few chickens, and grow starved
      vegetables, and train nasturtiums up flimsy trellises? One
      or two of them had hired land and were chicken farming.
      Chicken farming! Lieut. Peabody had planted fruit trees on
      a south-west slope full in the blue eye of the Sussex wind!
      And that girl with the smudgy face, and the soft coal-dust
      eyes who had taken in the milk? Deputizing as a maid of all
      work? Well, anyway, she worked, did a woman's work, though
      it might be because she could not help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing on up the farm lane between high hedges of thorn
      and ash and maple, with the Ten Acre on his right, and the
      Ridge Field on his left, Arnold Furze returned to a world
      that seemed solid and real. He paused--as he often
      did--just above the pond--to see the greyish brick chimney
      stack of the farmhouse showing above and through the bare
      poles of the larch plantation. From this point above the
      pond where the lane began to dip and the hedges were lower,
      he could command the greater part of his farm. Immediately
      below him stretched the pond and the two old ilexes at the
      end of the larch plantation, and beyond them lay the yard,
      and the stone farm buildings their grey walls and rust
      coloured roofs patched with yellow lichen. Rushy Pool and
      Rushy Wood were hidden by the larches and the house, but
      above the swelling brownness of the Sea Field, the beeches
      of Beech Ho seemed to carry the sky on their branches.
      Eastwards, along the slope of the valley the greenness of
      the Furze Field met the deeper green of a wood of Scotch
      Firs. Southwards at the heel of the Gore, and lying in the
      deep trough of the valley, the oaks of Gore Wood stood
      embattled at the end of the Long Meadow. The old cedar
      beyond the orchard raised three dark plumes above the roof
      of the house, and further still the spruces at the
      south-east corner of the Doom Paddock would flash like
      spires in the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Furze it was very beautiful with all its changing
      contours, its high woods, and the swelling steepness of its
      grass and arable. Never did it look the same, but was
      eternally changeful above the green deeps of its valley
      where the brook ran down to Rushy Pool. Difficult--yes--but
      he never grudged it its difficulties; for a beauty that is
      loved is born with in all its moods and mischiefs. For five
      years now he had been able to call "Doomsday" his. He had
      fought it, loved it, wrestled with it, and there had been
      times when it had threatened to tear the guts out of him.
      But that was life. Better than finnicking about in an
      office, and putting paper over your shirt cuffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on and down to the path above the yard. A
      middle-aged man with very blue eyes and a moustache the
      colour of honey was forking manure out of the cowhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sssir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll cart that wood up from the Gore. I'll be with you in
      ten minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The blue-eyed labourer thrust his fork into a pile of
      smoking dung, and went with long trailing steps towards the
      stable, turning to glance over his shoulder at Furze who
      was disappearing behind the yew hedge screening a part of
      the garden. But there was no garden there now, only coarse
      grass and a few old unpruned roses. Arnold Furze had no
      time for life's embroideries.

      A part of Doomsday Farmhouse had been built by a Sussex
      ironmaster in Elizabeth's day, and to this man of iron it
      owed the stone walls of its lower story, its stone
      mullions, and its brick chimneys. The second story warmed
      itself with lichened bricks and tiles. The spread of its
      red-brown roof with its hips and valleys had an ample
      tranquillity. The parlour, jutting out queerily towards
      Mrs. Damans' sunk garden, had a roof of Horsham stone, but
      Mrs. Damaris had been dead a hundred and seventy years or
      more, and her sunk garden had become a sunny place where
      hens clucked in coops and yellow chicks toddled about over
      the grass. Many of the windows still held their lead
      lights, but in the living-room and the parlour they had
      been replaced by wooden casements. As to its setting,
      nothing could have been more charmingly casual and tangled
      and unstudied. On the east the branches of the old pear and
      apple trees of an orchard almost brushed its walls and held
      blossom or fruit at the very windows. Behind it lay the
      vegetable garden backed by the larch plantation, and full
      of lilacs and ancient rambling currant and gooseberry
      bushes, and groves of raspberry canes, and winter greens,
      and odd clumps of flowers. The tiled roof of the well-house
      was a smother of wild clematis and hop. South lay Mrs.
      Damaris' little sunk garden, its stone walls all mossy, and
      the four yews--left unclipped for many years--rising like
      dark green obelisks. Beyond the orchard the big cedar
      looked almost blue when the fruit blossom was out. West of
      it, the cow-houses, stable, barn, granary, and waggon sheds
      were grouped about the byres and rick-yard. The sweet,
      homely smell of the byres would drift in on the west wind.
      Everything was old, the oak of the fences, the posts of the
      waggon sheds, the big black doors of the barn, even the
      byre rails and the palings of the pig-sties. Silvered and
      green oak, grey stone, the mottled darkness of old brick
      and tile. The gates leading into the lane and the Doom
      Paddock were new, for Arnold Furze had made and hung them
      on new oak posts. The gates he had found there had been
      tied up with wire and lengths of rope, and patched with odd
      pieces of deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the window of the parlour you looked over Mrs.
      Damaris' little sunk garden and the Doom Paddock to an
      immense thorn hedge that hid the Long Meadow, and the brook
      beyond it. Rushy Pool glimmered down yonder towards the
      rising sun. The high ground on the other side of the brook
      rose like a green, tree-covered cliff in which were cleft
      blue vistas of woods and shining hills, and white clouds
      low down on the horizon by the sea. The sea was fifteen
      miles away, but when Arnold Furze was hoeing turnips up in
      the Sea Field he could lean upon his hoe and see the grey
      hills flicker between him and the old memories of France
      and the war. The birds in these Sussex woods had heard the
      rumble of the guns in those days, guns at Ypres, guns on
      the bloody, white-hilled, red-poppied Somme. Furze had been
      with the guns, the captain of a 4.5 Howitzer battery. It
      seemed very long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year as a learner on a farm in Hampshire, and five years
      at Doomsday! Five notable, terrible and glorious years,
      full of sweat and hate and love and weariness, and a back
      that had refused to break, and a stomach that would digest
      anything. Lonely? O, yes, in a way, but when a man has
      beasts and sheep and pigs, and two horses, and a dog, and a
      cat, and a number of odd hens and ducks to look after, his
      hands are full of life. And there were the birds, and the
      crops, and the trees, and the yellow gorse, and the wild
      flowers, all live things. No, a man had no time to be
      lonely, with Will Blossom and Will Blossom's boy and
      himself to work a hundred and twenty acres, though twenty
      acres of it were woodland. And difficult land at that.
      Heavy--some of it, and steep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years!
    </p>
    <p>
      He came up the stone steps to the door, with a great red
      winter sun setting behind him over the roof of the waggon
      shed. His boots were all yellow clay, and there were spots
      of it upon his face. He shaved himself twice a week. Bobbo
      the sheepdog flummoxed in at his heels, and making for the
      log fire on the great open hearth under the hood of the
      chimney, lay down to share it with Furze's black cat. The
      floor of the living-room was of red tiles, which made it
      safe for Arnold Furze to keep a wood fire burning and to
      pile upon it three or four times a day billets of oak and
      the butts of old posts and the roots of trees. In the
      winter this fire never went out, for in the morning two or
      three handfuls of kindling thrown upon the hot heap of wood
      ash would break into a blaze. He kept his logs and billets
      in the living-room, a great pile of them stacked in a
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here--too--an iron kettle was usually simmering on the
      hook. Tea-making was a simple process. The breakfast tea
      leaves were shaken out of the teapot upon the fire, more
      tea was added from a canister on the shelf, the kettle
      seized with an old leather hedging-glove, and the teapot
      filled. Milk, a loaf, butter on a white plate, and a pot of
      jam waited in the cupboard beside the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze had his tea by the fire. He sat on an oak stool of
      his own making, like some Sussex peasant of the iron days
      before man had realized cushions and comfort. He too was of
      iron, one of those lean big tireless men with his strength
      burning like a steady flame. You saw it in his eyes; it
      waxed and waned; it might die down like a flame at the end
      of the day, but with the dawn of the next day it was as
      bright as ever. He needed it, but he needed it a little
      less than he had done, for he had his feet well set in the
      soil, and could draw his breath and look about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before filling his pipe he poured out a saucer of milk for
      Tibby the black cat. The dog, a devoted and lovable beast,
      cuddled up beside him like a shaggy second self, his muzzle
      resting on Furze's knee, while his master sat and smoked,
      and allowed himself one of those short interludes that were
      like the five minutes' halt on a long march. The fire flung
      the shadows of him and his animals about the bare, old room
      with its brown distempered walls and beamed ceiling. He had
      a way of holding the stem of his pipe in his left fist as
      though he could not touch a thing without gripping it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire was good, like all primitive phenomena to a man
      who is strong, and Furze's life at Doomsday was very
      primitive, and not unlike a colonist's, a concentration
      upon the essential soil and its products, an ignoring of
      individual comfort. He had come to Doomsday with a
      claw-hammer, a spanner, and a saw, his flea-bag and camp
      equipment, and a hundred pounds in cash, all the capital
      that was left him after the purchase of the farm. War
      gratuity, savings, the thousand pounds an aunt had left
      him, Doomsday, derelict and lonely, had swallowed them all.
      A Ford taxi, chartered from Carslake station, had lurched
      up the lane, and deposited Furze and all his worldly gear
      on the stone steps of the old, silent house. He had slept
      on his camp bed, washed in a bucket, used a box as a table,
      and another box as a seat, camping out in one room of the
      rambling and empty house.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day the struggle had begun. And what a struggle
      it had been, that of a lone, strong, devoted man who had
      that strange passion for the soil, and who combined with
      his strength, intelligence and a love of beauty. There had
      been hardly a sound gate on the farm; the hedges had been
      broken and old and straggling into the fields like young
      coppices. The Furze Hill field had been a waste of gorse;
      the Wilderness a tangle of brambles, bracken, thorns,
      broom, ragwort and golden rod, and it was a wilderness
      still. The coppice wood had not been cut for seven years in
      either Gore or Rushy Woods; elms had been sending up
      suckers far out in the Ten Acre; weeds had rioted, charlock
      and couch and thistles. Dead trees had lain rotting; a
      beech, blown down in Beech Ho, had never been touched. The
      stable roof had leaked. The gutters had been plugged, so
      that water had dribbled down the walls. The byre fences had
      sagged this way and that; the roof of one of the pigsties
      had fallen in. Nettles had stood five feet high round the
      back of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a first six months he had had of it, working and
      living like a savage, but a savage with a sensitive modern
      soul! An occasional stroller along the field path that
      crossed Bean Acres and Maids Croft and ran along the edge
      of Furze Hill to Beech Ho had seen him as a brown figure in
      old army shirt and breeches, swinging axe or mall, or
      lopping at an overgrown hedge, or cutting over the tangled
      orchard, or ploughing with his one horse and second-hand
      wheel plough. Wandering lovers had discovered him scything
      or hoeing in the dusk; only the birds had seen him in the
      dawn, with dew upon his boots and a freshness in those
      deep-set blue eyes. The lovers had marvelled. They had
      talked about him at Carslake in the shops and the pubs.
      "Mad Furze"--"Fool Furze"--"Mean Furze." Mean because he
      had had to set his teeth and calculate before buying
      anything. He had never missed a sale, and had brought away
      old harness to be pieced and patched, old tools, a machine
      or two, just as little as he could do with. All his
      shopping had been done up at Carslake on Saturday nights,
      and the tinned food, the jam and the tea and the sugar, and
      his week's tobacco, and an occasional piece of butcher's
      meat, had been carried home in an old canvas kit-bag. For a
      year all the ready money that had come to him had been
      provided by the milk of two rather indifferent cows and the
      sale of a couple of litters of pigs. He had eaten the eggs
      laid by his dozen hens, and helped himself to live by the
      few vegetables he had had time to grow. So grim had been
      the struggle that he had had to sell some of his timber,
      fifty oaks in Gore Wood, and it had hurt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at the fire and stroked Bobbo's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      My God--how tired he had been sometimes, ragingly tired. He
      could remember hating the place for one whole winter month
      with a furious and evil hatred. It had had its claws in his
      soul's belly, twisting his guts. Beaten--no--by God! He had
      trampled on in his muddy boots, without time to cook or
      wash, sleeping like a log in the flea-bag on his camp bed.
      Lonely? Well, he supposed that he had not had time to feel
      lonely. Holidays? Perhaps seven days off in three years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half playfully Furze blew smoke at the dog--and stretched
      himself on his box in front of the fire. He had made his
      roots; they were not as stout as he intended them to be,
      but they were there. Twenty good shorthorns, thirty sheep,
      two horses--fine dapple greys--six black pigs, fifty or so
      fowls, and a dozen ducks. And manure stacking up, and Rushy
      Bottom, the Long Meadow, Doom Paddock, and the Gore growing
      good grass with clover in it, and his winter wheat showing
      well in the Ridge Field, and a hundred-ton crop of mangels
      clamped, enough for all his stock. He had had a bumper hay
      crop. He had a man and a boy now to help. This spring he
      would be able to buy a new mower, and a new horse
      cultivator, and in the autumn perhaps a corn crusher, a
      decent tumbril.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knocked out his pipe on the toe of his boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, Bobbo. Work."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lit a lantern, and as he went down the steps and along
      the path with the shadows swinging from the light, he heard
      the chug-chug of a chaff cutter. A good sound that. He
      sniffed the sweet smell of the byres, and looked up at the
      stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later he was in the big cowshed, helping Will with
      the sliced roots and the hay. The place steamed; it was
      full of the sweet breath of the beasts and the sound of
      their breathing and feeding. Rows of gentle heads and
      liquid eyes showed in the long, dimly lit building, and the
      warm, milky, bestrawed life of it sent a whimper of
      pleasure and of pride through Furze's blood. He was fond of
      his beasts, and as he passed down the building, his hand
      caressed the placid creatures--"Well, Mary--well, Doll--old
      lady." The dog kept close to his heels, and the cows,
      accustomed to Bobbo being there at feeding time, were not
      troubled by his nearness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will Blossom, with a dusting of chaff on his honey-coloured
      moustache, went through the cow house, holding his lantern
      shoulder high.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That thur wood be ready loaded f'tomorrer, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right, Will. Good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night, ssir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Blossom went out with his lantern, but Arnold Furze
      remained for a while in the cow house, watching the cows
      feeding, and feeling the warm contentment of the big brown
      creatures.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, having looked into the stable at the two
      "greys" and locked up for the night, Furze put out the
      lantern and wandered up the lane. There were times now when
      he could stand and draw breath, and let the tenseness of
      his self relax, and raise his head and look about him at
      the waiting beauty of this world of his. For years the
      singing of birds had been no more than a little chant going
      on while he laboured, heard dimly but without attention.
      The soil had held him grappled, and every sense had been
      absorbed into the struggle, but now he had eyes and ears
      and nostrils, and a consciousness that could pause and
      enjoy. Often he would walk the lane at night or wander
      about the Doom Paddock like a captain whose ship sailed
      steadily under the stars. To-night it was very still, and
      yet he knew that the air was moving, for he felt it on his
      left cheek, and last year's oak leaves on some saplings in
      the hedge made a dry twittering. He paused to listen to the
      whisper. Presently, he went on as far as the Six Firs on
      the mound. They too seemed to send a murmur from the
      towering darkness, a sound as of breathing; and climbing
      the mound Furze laid his head against one of the trunks.
      Yes, he could hear the faint, slumberous breathing of the
      tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down yonder he saw lights, little yellow points, the lights
      of Cinder Town, and he stood watching them for a while as
      though he were the master of a sailing ship out at sea.
      These six tall trees towering like masts seemed set so high
      above those puny little residences. He felt sorry for them.
      Poor little places, no more than bathing huts set up along
      the edge of the great sea of man's effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, well, he had no quarrel with Cinder Town. It had been
      of some use to him, and had opened a little market at his
      very door at a time when he had felt like murdering every
      butcher and corn-factor and milkman in the neighbourhood.
      Poor little places! Feeding them upon the rich milk of his
      shorthorns was rather like giving milk in a bottle to
      motherless lambs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog had followed him and had been at his heels all the
      while, but with so devoted and self-effacing a silence that
      he had been no more than a shadow. They returned together
      to the house where the light of the fire wavered through
      the casements. Bobbo slipped in at his master's heels, and
      as Furze closed and bolted the door upon the darkness he
      had a feeling that something had slipped in after him as
      silent as the dog. An emotion; a subtle and shadowy
      impression, the wraith of a mood or a manner of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto the big room had satisfied his wants, for it was
      parlour, bedroom, and workshop all in one; he still slept
      in his camp bed, and used a dining-table that he had made
      out of deal boards with four fencing posts for legs. A
      second table over by the orchard window displayed a
      collection of harness, leather, a pair of boots that were
      waiting to be soled, a boot-last, tools, a harnessmaker's
      awl and thread, odd boxes of nails and screws. There was
      only one chair in the room, an old basket thing covered
      with faded green cretonne. At his meals Furze sat on the
      home-made oak stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hung his hat on a peg and crossed the room, slowly and
      thoughtfully, and pushed the arm-chair forward with his
      foot. He sat down in it by the fire, took off his muddy
      boots, and reached for the plaid slippers by the cupboard
      door. His thoughtful look deepened; he stared at the fire,
      but once or twice he threw a quick and considering glance
      over a shoulder at his barrack of a room. He found himself
      wondering what Will Blossom's wife thought of it when she
      came up once a week to clean and wash and cook him a joint.
      It was like a room in a backwoodsman's hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he ought to be able to afford something better before
      long, but not before he had bought every machine and tool
      that the beloved and exacting soil demanded. He had got
      along very well all these years. The furniture, and the
      pretty-pretties could wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, a desire for something else had slipped into the room
      with him, and he was aware of a vague unrest. Almost it
      reminded him of those longings during the war when a man
      sat in the mud under a tin sheet, and thought of Piccadilly
      Circus, and the Savoy, and girls in pretty frocks, and
      tables laid for dinner, and a room with a carpet and white
      sheets, and a bath. Yes, he had had to cut out the
      æsthetics, but even if he were to fill the place with
      club-chairs, and Turkey carpets and old oak and china--what
      then?
    </p>
    <p>
      He left that question unanswered, perhaps because he was
      subconsciously aware of the voice that was asking it, a
      voice that he had met with deaf ears. Why explore your own
      subconscious, or drag it up to the level of the painfully
      conscious? Better to turn your back and avoid it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, after a supper of bread and cheese and ale, he
      lit a pipe, and opened the door leading into Mrs. Damaris'
      parlour. Empty, panelled in white, and with its old black
      Georgian firegrate, it always suggested to Furze the memory
      of a woman. It had a faint perfume, a faded daintiness,
      something that was not male. Sitting in the deep window
      seat you looked down into Mrs. Damaris' sunk garden, and
      could imagine a peacock spreading its tail upon the stone
      wall. It was in this room that Furze kept the one
      extravagance that he had allowed himself, a baby-grand
      piano in a rosewood case, bought at a sale in Carslake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the door open so that the firelight played into
      Mrs. Damaris' dim white parlour, he sat down on another
      stool of his own making, uncovered the keyboard and played
      Schubert. He played well, with a firm touch and a richness
      of feeling, and in that empty house the music sounded
      ghostly.

    </p>
    <p>
      There was in Mary Viner a gentleness that consented, and a
      young idealism that rebelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the matter of the week's washing Cinder Town divided
      itself into the washers and the washed. "Simla"--as
      befitted the head of the estate--sent its soiled linen to a
      washerwoman, and the Vachetts and the Perrivales and the
      Twists conformed to this convention. At the other end of
      the scale and the colony, poor, fat, fair and frowsy Mrs.
      Mullins, helped by a strong girl, decorated on each Monday
      the back lawn of "Pandora" with innumerable garments,
      nighties and towels and stockings and blouses and little
      etceteras, and her husband's blue and white striped pyjamas
      bellying in the wind. The display annoyed Lieut.-Colonel
      Twist very considerably. He was a pernickety, iron grey,
      yellowish man, with scornful nostrils and pale blue eyes.
      Matters between the "Chalet" and "Pandora" were not quite
      neighbourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for "Green Shutters," it made a virtue of necessity, and
      hung its bunting above the patch of grass behind the
      cottage and close to the Jamieson's fence, where it
      fluttered against blue March skies, or drooped idly against
      the green of June. To Mary Viner, Monday was always a day
      of pain. If to hate doing your own washing and hanging out
      to dry was snobbery, then she confessed herself a snob,
      though next door ex-Lieut. Harold Coode kept her in
      countenance by hanging out his shirts. True, he appeared to
      have only two of them, the one with a patch, and the one
      that had no patch. They alternated on the six feet of
      clothes line behind the "Oast," hanging there with a pair
      of grey socks and a vest, keeping the flag flying. That was
      the sort of man Coode was, eager and bright and thin, a
      noble fellow, but not quite a man, and he was a trouble to
      Mary. He tended towards worship over the four-foot fence,
      and she was sorry for him, an uncomfortable emotion, for
      Coode, like many noble fellows, had no tact. He appeared
      when he should not have appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side were the Jamieson children, two
      tow-haired savages with lapis lazuli eyes, and faces that
      looked as though they had been dipped in their father's
      strawberry jam. Irreverent children, they poked their tow
      heads above the fence, and giggled and were rude, and
      sometimes a clod of clay left a mark in the middle of one
      of Mary's sheets or towels.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was tired and touchy on Mondays, and apt to be quick of
      colour. The whole business humiliated her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You little wretches."
    </p>
    <p>
      Chortles from the dear little children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary had complained to Mrs. Jamieson who sent her washing
      out, and who had stared at her with her round, milkmaid's
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, Miss Viner. They are such young Turks. But it
      is tempting, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary had flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, no doubt. But I don't see the humour."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the culminating Jamieson joy screamed when the clothes
      line broke, which it did on occasions, and the whole string
      of bunting collapsed upon the grass. The little red faces
      exulted. And the line broke upon this particular morning
      early in March, with a cold and blustering wind blowing.
      One of Captain Hesketh's shirts and a couple of
      handkerchiefs had made direct for the cinder path and
      drabbled themselves there, when she heard a voice behind
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You--are--busy. Do come and look at my new car."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the grass behind her stood pale-haired Winnifred Twist,
      an only child and precious as Ming china. She had a soft,
      drawling voice and an air of very intelligent languor. The
      Twists might live in Cinder Town, but they made it obvious
      that they were not obliged to live there. Winnifred's
      father emphasized his potential mobility and freedom by
      always talking of "Selling the damned place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary, with the two ends of the broken line in her hands,
      and aware of the other girl's leather coat and fur
      gauntlets felt a sudden rage which she was careful to
      subdue. It was human of Winnifred to show off, but it was
      not kind of her to show off to Mary, with that washing
      draggled on the grass and the heads of the Jamieson
      children visible above the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's come. I heard you were having one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do come and look. She's just outside. I have been up to
      Carslake and back. And I nearly ran into a cart. Made the
      horse shy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was voiceless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man with the cart cut up quite rough about it. That
      Furze man who sells us milk. He's a bit of a boor. I shall
      advise the mater to change her milkman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary, sleeves rolled above the elbows, reknotted the rope,
      and felt herself being overpowered by her friend's
      chattering enthusiasm. She supposed that she would have to
      go and see the precious child's new toy, and put a good
      face upon it, and appear brightly and nicely envious. After
      all, why should she grudge Winnifred Twist a car? It was
      rather petty and beastly of her. But always the good things
      seemed to come to the wrong people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going out to inspect the car she found half Cinder Town
      gathered about it. Colonel Twist was there, and the
      Vachetts who always looked so sorrowful, and Mr. Stephen
      Perrivale, and Phyllis his red-headed daughter, and
      Commander Troton booming cheerfully, and the Brownlows, and
      poor Coode, who fixed his one pathetic eye on Mary and
      watched her as she stood between the Twist father and the
      Twist daughter. Why did not someone give Mary a car? Why
      could not he give her a car? That sorry old bicycle of hers
      with the rusty handle-bars and the rattling mudguards
      always made him feel a little thick in she throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a beauty!" said Miss Viner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. They all smiled, save the Vachetts in whom
      sorrow had turned sour. The car smirked and glistened, and
      sleeked itself in its new blue coat. It was only a little
      car, but in Cinder Town a car was a notable possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      "New balloon tyres--I see," said Coode--and was smothered
      by the Troton fog-horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very pretty, very pretty. Call her the Blue Bird--I
      suppose? Twist, you will be paying fines. That's the
      penalty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was looking at the Perrivale girl whose pale face was
      all screwed up under her beautiful flaming hair. Yes, to
      Phyllis the thing was unspeakable, bitter, mocking. Poor
      little Phyllis, so quick, and hot hearted, and hot headed,
      and generous and passionate even in her envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the cinder road came a cart loaded with cord wood, and
      with a grey horse between the shafts, and a man, whose eyes
      were still angry, walking beside it. The group had to stand
      to one side while the cart went on to deliver its wood at
      "Simla." Furze gave one glance at the blue car, and spoke
      to nobody. His eyes lifted as he passed, and dwelt for a
      moment on the face and figure of Mary Viner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had her sleeves rolled up and her hands were red.
    </p>
    <p>
      His deep eyes seemed to go up into the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cinderella."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had christened her.

      There were times when Mary Viner reasoned with herself,
      composing little homilies that laid a gentle and
      restraining hand upon her restlessness. She confronted the
      age-old problem of the begetter and the begotten, trying to
      feel dutiful and not succeeding, and coming to rest upon a
      feeling of pity. Yet, she knew in her marrow and heart that
      age and youth should not live together, though youth may
      not know what it wants and age wants so little, but that
      little a tyranny of trifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt her exasperations to be atrocious, but there they
      were, like muscle pain or toothache or a chafed
      heel--realities, disharmonies, and though she strove for
      their repression she was but weaving them into the texture
      of herself, threads that would break or get ravelled when
      some human crisis should come upon her. Such repressions
      are not good for the soul. For her parents were nice old
      people, sweetly selfish in feeling themselves unselfish. It
      is probable that they thought Mary fortunate in having a
      home, and in not having to cheapen herself in the world's
      market. And healthy, homely work, cooking and washing and
      cleaning. Besides, you had to live somewhere, and pensions
      did not carry you far at post-war prices, and the
      Sandihurst Estate had gentlefolk upon it, and you could get
      "bridge" most nights a week, and Colonel Sykes and
      Commander Troton and the Twists were putting down a hard
      tennis court. Age forgets so easily its own youth and its
      youth's blind gropings and hungers. It sits resigned by the
      fireside, and yet can be full of a senile restlessness of
      its own, of little chatterings and exactions, and odd
      irritating tricks and mannerisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      O, those evenings, those long winter evenings when "Green
      Shutters" seemed buried under a mountain of finality!
      Nothing happened, nothing could happen, save perhaps the
      occasional and tentative intrusion of poor Coode who sat
      nobly on the edge of a chair, and called Captain Hesketh
      "sir," and listened politely to an old soldier's
      meanderings. A nice fellow! And his one eye was so dull and
      adoring! Those evenings, with her mother reading and
      stopping her reading to chatter directly Mary opened a
      book! And her father and his acrostics! How she loathed
      those acrostics and the ingenious people who strung the
      jingles together. And the poor old man's perpetual clearing
      of his throat, an explosive sound rather like a sheep's
      cough; and the trick her mother had of tapping with one
      foot on the iron fender! Silence, an immense, eventless
      silence, and those fidgetings and rustlings and poor little
      fussinesses!
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been nights when she had put on a hat and rushed
      out wildly into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going, Mary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, where--and why? They always wanted to know the reason
      for everything. As if one could give reasons, at the age of
      six-and-twenty, when life felt like a dead volcano, and
      your heart was ready to break for something and nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going, Mary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She would blurt out some excuse. She had forgotten to shut
      up their six hens, or Winnifred had a dress to show her, or
      the Brownlows had asked her in. She would rush out and walk
      wildly up the wet and empty road to Carslake or down the
      wet and empty road to Melhurst. Sometimes her heart
      cried--"It would be better if we were dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, on those nights she thought much upon the foresight
      of her sister Clare. She glimpsed Clare as a palely glowing
      and fortunate creature away yonder within reach of that
      London shimmer. Lights, happenings! In the damp, dark deeps
      of a Sussex night she would turn her face in the direction
      of the distant city, yearning for it and for all the things
      that to her young loneliness it seemed to offer. Theatres,
      dances, shops, a sense of appetites felt and satisfied,
      trains, buses, tea-shops, the crowds, the stir, the
      full-throated life of it all. She envied Clare. Clare had
      escaped, as most women long to escape and dare not confess
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes she would wander a little way up the "Doomsday"
      lane, not because she was conscious of the man who lived
      there, but because she had no business in the lane and it
      gave her a faint thrill of childish adventure. Once or
      twice she had scrambled up the mound and stood among the
      Six Firs, looking out into the rolling darkness, with
      Cinder Town pricked out in yellow points below her. She
      would lean against one of the trees, and hear its sighing.
      Her heart seemed to sigh like the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      On other rare days she would escape for an hour or two on
      her old bicycle, going out to meet life that never came, so
      full of her own unsatisfied youth that she was blind to the
      life about her. She loved beauty, but in her passion to
      escape she passed beauty by, youthfully hurrying, hastening
      somewhere and nowhere. She seemed to know Melhurst and
      Rotherbridge by heart, and all the lilies in the moat of
      Cadnam Castle, and the ruins of Carslake Abbey and the
      Roman walls of Hoyle. To ride up to Carslake was no
      adventure, for she did the household shopping there, buying
      meat and groceries, and her father's cough mixture, and her
      mother's wool, and an occasional Weldon's Journal with a
      brown paper pattern of a jumper or a nightdress pinned up
      inside it. True, you could buy hats at Sturtevant's, but
      what hats!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on one of these excursions to Melhurst early in
      March that her old hack of a bicycle broke its chain
      halfway up the long hill that ended in the white gates of
      Melhurst Park. She accepted the rupture as fate, and went
      on, wheeling her machine, and into Melhurst Park, for the
      public road ran through it. The park rolled like a great
      green sea, with woods of beech and fir sailing upon it, a
      north wind blowing white clouds across an intense blue sky,
      and dead leaves scudding like foam. She saw the downs in
      the distance. In the valley below deer were feeding, and
      the cedars and sequoias and spruces of Melhurst House
      looked black as thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      A four-mile walk! Well, quite an event. And she would be
      alone for the best part of two hours, and there are days
      when loneliness can be precious. She walked at her leisure,
      and coming to a group of old beech trees standing beside
      the park road, she leaned her bicycle against one of the
      white posts and sat down on the high grass verge. The March
      wind had dried the grass; it was still wintry and brown,
      and thousands of last year's beech leaves were scurrying
      about and making little fluttering rushes hither and
      thither. The air was full of the sound of their rustlings
      and of the blowing of the wind through the beech boughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A blue wagon drawn by two grey horses, and coming from
      Melhurst way, appeared upon the road. It topped a rise, and
      was lost to view in a hollow, though Mary heard the rumble
      of the wheels. A man's figure rose into view, and then the
      heads of the two horses, and both the man and the horses
      were familiar. It was the "Doomsday" wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could have walked on, but there was no conscious
      impulse bidding her go or stay, and yet she had a feeling
      that the man on the wagon had been watching her, and that
      she was sitting there like a deer covered by a sighted gun.
      The wagon rolled towards her, and she looked straight ahead
      towards the downs. It was right upon her now, and still she
      had that feeling of being observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze stopped his horses. Her quick upward glance caught
      him in the act of rising from his seat on the rail. He had
      a hand to his old grey-green soft hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any trouble, Miss Viner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the bicycle leaning against the white post,
      and she was aware of a quick flushing of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The chain is broken--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He came down at once, deliberately seizing the opportunity
      with his strong hands and yet doing it so naturally that
      that flush of hers need not have happened. He asked no
      permission, but picked up the machine and lifted it on to
      the wagon and standing on a fore-wheel hub, settled it on
      the load of cake he had picked up at Melhurst station. Then
      he stood down and looked at her. The turned-down brim of
      his hat seemed to make the deep stare of his quiet eyes
      more serious. She had a new and sudden impression of him as
      a man who had some meaning for her, a man with a tanned and
      silent face, and a mouth that was both hard and kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you ride?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was going to walk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as you please. I can fix you up a seat."
    </p>
    <p>
      His curiously dark blue eyes remained fixed upon her face
      all this time, not boldly or gallantly, but with a
      deliberate and grave interest. She had the instant
      knowledge of the fact that as a woman she pleased him. She
      may have gone on to the intuitive glimpsing of him as a man
      who was not easily pleased. Her thoughts flew back to the
      morning when he had brought the milk, and she had shown him
      a smudged face. Again, her colour changed quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very good of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I will ride."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not visualized his helping her up, and she felt
      more lifted than helped. His hands were very strong, but
      they touched her gently, giving her a sudden and very vivid
      impression of contact. She felt it as an act of homage, and
      her eyes sought to veil themselves. She was just a little
      confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where shall I sit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was up in the wagon, gathering two or three empty sacks
      and a horse cover. There was a space between the stacked
      cake and the front of the wagon, and he made a seat for her
      on the cake, folding the sacks very deliberately and
      placing the cloth upon them as though the careful doing of
      it mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That ought to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, with something of a quick, scared
      self-consciousness in her smile, and sat down. She was
      aware of a pleasant perfume, the smell of the cake. And he,
      smiling down at her momentarily with a something in his
      eyes that went straight down into the depths of her,
      climbed over the edge and gained the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was going to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--please," she felt like saying, and was silent, her
      hands clasped in her lap. But if he meant to walk, well--it
      meant--She drew a deep breath. For his walking was like his
      touching of her, an act that was both sensitive and big and
      manly, not the act of a little, vain, agile creature, and
      yet so natural. She had a glimpse of him standing there
      brown and still beside the blue wagon and the grey horses,
      part of the landscape, and right with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, her blue ship sailed through Melhurst Park, with the
      white clouds going over, and the landscape half sunlight
      and half shadow, and she sat and wondered, because he
      walked beside the head of the near horse as though the
      wagon held nothing but its load of cake. In a way she was
      glad of his silence and his back. She could consider him at
      her leisure, or as much as she could see of him, the broad
      back, the tanned neck, the old felt hat with the brim
      turned down, the long, striding legs, and the arms swinging
      easily. His very clothes seemed to have the soft,
      weather-worn half tints of the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      He owned Doomsday Farm. He was supposed to be a little
      unusual. She had seen the house in the distance from the
      field path by Beech Ho, and had thought it romantic, and a
      little mysterious, but lonely. Him, too, in a sense she had
      only seen at a distance and almost as though he shared
      Doomsday's mystery and loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-way up the long hill out of Cherry Bottom he stopped
      his horses, placed the little wooden roller under a back
      wheel, and let them rest. He pushed his hat back, looked
      across the hills and smiled. Next moment he was speaking to
      her, standing square to the wagon, and looking up steadily
      into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mind the smell of the cake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she did not mind it; she thought it rather fragrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Country smells are," he said; "at least to me. They hang
      about like memories. The meal tub and the hay loft, and the
      reek of a weed fire. All good. You don't get out much--I
      suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not much."
    </p>
    <p>
      His quiet blue eyes confused her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Women don't. Not with house work. Same with me. I'm stuck
      there on the soil."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a feeling that he approved of woman as a domestic
      creature, and his man's view of it was as of something
      natural and inevitable. Vaguely she was aware of resenting
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But yours is more interesting. A man's always is."
    </p>
    <p>
      His blue eyes seemed to receive this statement with
      peculiar seriousness, and to consider it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather be a farm labourer than a servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much the same--surely, though one is out in the air more.
      A man's job is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should it be a man's job?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It happens so. Always has been, hasn't it? Except in the
      case of the idle young persons who play golf and tennis all
      day and every day, and they don't count."
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt herself flushing. It seemed to her rather
      ridiculous to be sitting there in his wagon and getting
      into an argument with him. What had they to argue about?
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think women ought to work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His blue eyes suggested that he had never thought of it in
      any other way than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, don't they? Ninety-nine out of a hundred. It's life.
      Of course, if you get the notion--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had silenced her, and he seemed suddenly aware of the
      fact, and grew silent himself, and then he restarted his
      horse, and resumed his place by the head of the horse. They
      sailed slowly athwart the landscape till they came to the
      place where the Melhurst and the Rotherbridge roads joined,
      and here he pulled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood up, and refused his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can manage, thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had to leave him the handling of her bicycle. She
      noticed that he glanced at her with something between
      perplexity and half-amused concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you so much," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all. Glad to have been of use."
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his old felt hat, and with a grave and smile-less
      nod she turned away towards Cinder Town.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o'clock on a moonlit March night a young woman
      went out with a jug in quest of milk. For Ransford, the
      Carslake doctor, expected all day, had not arrived at
      "Green Shutters" till seven o'clock, and had shown himself
      a little testy, as an overworked man will. Two old people
      in bed and coughing in chorus and both with temperatures,
      and why hadn't Mary sent for him before? As though doctor's
      bills were to be incurred with frivolous recklessness!
      Ransford had warmed his hands and ordered milk, meat
      essence, junket. He had promised to send down some medicine
      by a boy on a bicycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence Mary's quest for milk, for in the larder she had
      found just enough to cover a lump of sugar in the bottom of
      a breakfast cup. She knew that she had only to knock at the
      green door of the "Oast" in order to command immediate
      devotion, but she did not knock at poor Coode's door. She
      tried the Perrivales, to be met by Phyllis' red head--and a
      "So sorry, but I don't think we have got a drop. Dad had
      the last in his coffee." She hesitated outside the
      Brownlows, and then went on down the cinder track and out
      into the road. She would find milk at "Doomsday," and she
      faced the full moon and saw it hanging like a round shield
      behind the trunk of one of the Six Firs. There was not a
      cloud in the sky. She looked up at the zenith, though the
      stars were dim because of the moonlight, and the Milky
      Way--invisible--trailed symbolically above her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the lane began to descend she heard the dry rustling
      of last year's oak leaves shivered over by a little wayward
      breeze; the gleam of the pond appeared, and upon it the
      very black shadows of the two ilexes. The moonlight
      splintered itself upon the larches. She went softly, to
      pause by the pond, persuaded to loiter there a moment by
      her own self-consciousness and the night's mystery. She
      fancied that she could see a light shining beyond the
      trunks of the larches, and she watched it for a moment as
      she went on past the pond. She opened the gate, hesitated
      and was guided by the light. A little below her lay the
      farm buildings, very black, and with their roofs glimmering
      a little, and as she followed the path along the edge of
      the larch plantation she felt like a woman playing the part
      of a timid child. But how absurd! To thrill a little over
      the fetching of a jug of milk from a farmhouse on a
      moonlight night in March!
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached the yew hedge and was puzzled. Where was the
      door? In the wall facing her or over there where the house
      sent out a dark projection? Straight ahead she saw a window
      all a-flicker with the light of a fire, and it seemed to
      her that a weedy path went that way. She tried it, and saw
      the three stone steps and the leaded hood over the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was on the very point of knocking when a sound
      surprised her, three deep rich chords played upon a piano.
      Her hand was restrained. Those prelude sounds were followed
      by one of Chopin's ballades, played as a strong man might
      be expected to play it, with a largeness of touch and a
      good deal of feeling. She was astonished. But
      why--astonishment. A man might be a farmer and yet love
      music. Her first thought had been that Furze was the owner
      of a pianola, but a moment's listening told her that the
      music was made by human hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood and heard it out, the white jug held against her
      body and between her two breasts. Her knock, when it came,
      was rather tentative and timid. It was answered by the
      barking of a dog. Then she heard footsteps, and the door
      was opened.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He did not recognize her at once, for she was in the
      shadow, and the light from the fire was wayward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the white jug held to her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke quickly, as though a little out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so sorry to trouble you at this hour. My people are
      ill. The doctor ordered milk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Viner--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood back a little, and was silent for a moment, as
      though he was in doubt about something, or was embarrassed
      by her coming, and she noticed his hesitation. She did not
      expect hesitation in him; deliberation--perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry. Nothing very serious--I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bronchitis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather hard luck on you. The jug--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him the jug, wondering whether he was going to
      leave her standing on the doorstep, and if so--why? She
      could see Bobbo's fluffy head pressed against one of
      Furze's legs; even the dog seemed to deliberate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you come in a moment? By the fire--while I go to the
      dairy. I'm afraid I'm rather a backwoodsman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that he had asked her in she hung back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, no--I mustn't bother you; I'll wait here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please come in. I won't keep you a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was that in his voice which said "You shall come in,"
      and she obeyed it, and to mask the surrender she spoke to
      the dog, caressing the fluffy head, and drawing it against
      her knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a dear! Your farm dog--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not show him her face, but while she bent over
      Bobbo she was all eyes and ears, and trembling with a quick
      and darting curiosity. She saw him move to the right, and
      put his hand behind him, and close a door that appeared to
      open into another room. Now, why did he do that? She
      supposed that the piano was in that other room.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly she felt herself stiffen. She was assailed by
      a consciousness of herself as an intruder, trespassing upon
      something that he wished to hide. But what could he wish to
      hide? A piano and a room which seemed to have had no light
      in it? She stiffened more awkwardly as her thoughts
      extended.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you sit down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had pushed the one chair forward and she seated herself
      as though she were made of china, while he--with a queer
      look at her, went out by another door, carrying her jug.
      She heard the scraping of a match. And sitting very still,
      she turned a head on a rigid neck, and scanned this room of
      his and its poverty and disorder, its improvised tables,
      its pile of logs in a corner, its camp bed. Surely, he did
      not live in this room? No, that could not be. The
      work-bench with its litter of tools and leather and odd
      pieces of harness convinced her that he used this room to
      work in. And in her innocence she supposed that the dog
      slept upon the camp bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard Furze returning, and directly he reappeared she
      stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hands for the jug, smiling uneasily, her
      eyes downcast and hidden by their smoking lashes. She was
      in a kind of panic mood, and when she got herself to the
      door she realized that he was behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night, Mr. Furze."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm coming out," he said; "take care of the steps. Wait
      while I light a lantern."
    </p>
    <p>
      She spilt some of the milk on the doorstep while she was
      quaking there, wanting to run, but holding herself back
      from such foolishness. He was lighting his lantern bending
      over it as it stood on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll light you down the lane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, please," she said; "don't bother; there is a moon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to come out, anyway," was his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came and held the lantern shoulder high so that she
      could see the steps, and when she was down them he moved
      quickly in front of her to light her along the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just follow."
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed, and when they reached the gate he held it
      open for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please," she said, "I can manage now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the gate deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I shall be up most of the night. It so happens, if you
      call it wasting my time--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked on--and he was beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Up most of the night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--lambs."
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was still asking herself why he had closed the door
      of that other room just as though he had something or
      someone to hide. And yet--if he was to be up half the
      night--? And--anyway--did it matter? She saw the Six Firs
      towering overhead, and feeling that her silence had been
      rather churlish she turned her face to him as they reached
      the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not come any farther. Good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night. I hope your people will soon be better. We
      shall both be looking after helpless creatures--you and I."
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice held her there for a moment, very still, and
      looking up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I heard you playing--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, my poor old piano--yes. Schubert. Good for these winter
      evenings. And then I heard your knock."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was holding the white jug to her breast, and to him her
      eyes appeared dark and immense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must go to your lambs, Mr. Furze. Good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood and watched her go down the road.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold Furze struck back along the lane, and turned into
      the Gore Field by the gate opposite the pond. He had blown
      out his lantern, for in truth it had not been needed after
      its lighting of Mary Viner down the steps and along the
      path, with the moon's silver lamp rising in the sky. Furze
      loitered here, one arm along the bar of the gate, the old
      thorn trees in the hedge making a shaggy blackness, and the
      Gore sloping away from his feet like a mirror that has been
      breathed upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sheep were pastured here, for he preferred to run them
      on the grass to folding them on a root crop, and at the end
      of the field and under the shelter of the Gore Wood were
      the pens and shelters of hurdles and faggots where the
      lambing ewes and their lambs were kept snug for the first
      few days. But for the moment Furze was not thinking of his
      ewes. He was thinking of Mary Viner and her big brown eyes
      with their smoking lashes, and her quick changes of colour,
      and her air of breathlessness. A creature so easily scared
      and silenced--so he thought. And sensitive, and not too
      happy. Yet, she puzzled him, and he, supposed that he did
      not know much about women. He had been too busy doing
      things. But her moods and their expressions seemed to blow
      this way and that like brown leaves on a March day; she
      appeared to be moved by vague currents that would not have
      been perceived by his stronger nature. She was yea and nay
      all in one breath, giving him the impression of a
      palpitating, warm-blooded bird. Her refusing to enter his
      house--for instance, and then her coming in, and the queer
      blight that had swept suddenly over her face after he had
      closed the door of Mrs. Damans' parlour. Certainly, he had
      hesitated about asking her in, for never till that moment
      had he realized the almost sordid poverty of his house. It
      had come upon him in a flash when he had seen her there
      with the white jug pressed to her bosom, and her brown eyes
      all glimmering. It had come as a shock. He had put out a
      hand and closed that other door because he had felt that
      house's nakedness and was suddenly ashamed of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had she thought of his room with its rough tables and
      its litter and its deplorable old chair? It must have
      seemed to her a squalid hole. And what if the seeming
      squalor of it had attached itself to her impression of him?
      He was conscious of a gust of mortification.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not understand--perhaps--how he had had to labour
      incessantly and furiously in the service of the soil, and
      that he had had neither the time nor the patience nor the
      money to be fastidious? He had just succeeded in keeping
      clean. But that room, and Mary sitting on the edge of the
      chair as though she was not sure of it, and her air of
      rigid decorum, and her half-frightened eyes, and her hurry
      to be gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn!" he said, and flung away from the gate and down the
      field. "I can't afford sentiment--at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of the night, under the waning moon and the
      shepherding stars, he was kept busy. Crouching in one of
      the shelters, with his lamp hung from a forked stake, he
      had to succour one of the ewes. It was life and death in
      the sheep pen, with the moon paling and the stars going
      over, and a little whispering wind coming with the dawn,
      and Furze, like the eternal shepherd, losing life and
      saving it. In the greyness of the dawn the poor ewe lay
      dead, and Furze, tired and grave eyed, went up the slope of
      the Gore with a new-born lamb wrapped up in his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing through the gate he met Will Blossom coming to his
      day's work, and the two men looked at the little,
      long-legged creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry to have lost that ewe, Will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will die, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The blue eyed man spoke as though dying was a natural
      cussedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll give he the bottle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze smiled, and stroked the lamb's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring me up an armful of hay, Will. The little fellow can
      lodge in my room."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Bobbo sat and watched a little bleating thing lying on a
      sack on his master's bed, while Furze routed out an old
      hamper, and filled it with hay, and put the orphan to bed
      beside the fire. Bobbo was a very wise dog; he knew all
      about sheep and their stupidities, and the mischievous
      vagaries of young cattle. The lamb was as safe with him as
      it would have been with its own mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze looked from the lamb to the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentle, Bobbo. We've got to be gentle, old chap, to all
      such things."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog's amber eyes stared up at him devotedly. The night
      was over, but the day's work waited, and Furze went into
      the kitchen to wash.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There were other ministrations at "Green Shutters" where
      two old people lay propped up in bed, with all the
      sitting-room cushions brought into use because the number
      of the Viner pillows were limited. They coughed separately
      and they coughed in chorus, poor old Hesketh very red in
      the face, and Mrs. Charlotte all fluffed up like a sick
      bird. They were very much worried about each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I shall keep you awake, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall do that myself, my love. You are the one to be
      pitied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not sleep--anyway--Hesketh. I should be sitting up
      with you. It must have been that wretched 'bridge' party.
      The Vachetts had terrible colds."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mary was cumbered with much serving. She had a fire to
      light in the old people's bedroom, and Dr. Ransford had
      given her instructions to keep it up, and they were to have
      their medicine during the night, and some warm milk if they
      fancied it. She was in no mood for bed or the prospect it
      offered her of emerging from the warmth of it every two
      hours to put coals on the fire or to pour out medicine. An
      arm-chair in front of the sitting-room fire seemed to her a
      more practical and comfortable proposition, for she had a
      book to read, if she chose to read it. Moreover, bed might
      have proved too persuasive, and her duties have sunk
      submerged beneath a healthy young woman's need of sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary belonged to a generation that values comfort, and
      though she had had no chance of experiencing the complete
      flavour of it, her sensitive nostrils could quiver over the
      imagined perfume. Her parents' ideas upon comfort were
      utterly different from her own, and to express her ideal of
      it she arranged the two arm-chairs in front of the fire,
      and curling up in one of them, disposed of her legs and
      feet in the other. She had brought her pillow down from her
      bedroom, and collected her novel, and two or three copies
      of the weekly illustrated magazines lent her by Winnifred
      Twist. A box of chocolates would have completed the
      illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For it was an illusion. She had just snuggled down and
      opened the <i>Bystander</i> when she heard the rapping of
      her father's stick on the floor of the room above. She was
      wanted. She had to get out of her two chairs and go
      upstairs where a night-light was burning, throwing the
      shadows of two heads upon the wall. The room had a flat,
      warm, stuffy smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary, dear, your father feels so sick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get me--a basin," said her father, with the anxious and
      earthy face of a man urgently in need of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was just in time. She steadied the basin for him, and
      when the paroxysm was over and he crouched there panting,
      she supported his poor old head against her bosom. How
      deplorably thin the back of his neck looked. She too was
      feeling overwhelmed by a sense of nausea, and the stuffy
      heat of the room. But how beastly of her! Though
      somehow--she could not help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother was twittering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better empty the basin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course she would have to empty the basin when her father
      felt secure without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you manage now, daddy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Viner's head was back on the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear, thank you. But I think I will have it on a
      chair."
    </p>
    <p>
      She carried the basin away, emptied it, washed it, and
      returning, placed it on a chair beside the bed. Was there
      anything else she could do for them? No, not for the
      moment. They were grateful to her, nicely appreciative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry to give you all this trouble, child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--that's all right, daddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      She patted his old hand with its blue veins and shiny and
      mottled skin, and closed the door gently, and descended the
      stairs with a dreary sense of having done her duty. Pity?
      O, yes--she felt all three of them were to be pitied, but
      then--the other two had lived their lives, and she saw no
      possible chance of living hers. The dutiful and loving
      daughter! Why could not she be that, and not the grudging,
      restless, squeamish creature that she was, yearning for
      things to happen--so long as they happened to her? Were
      there any dutiful daughters, ministering angels who found
      complete and wholehearted satisfaction in surrendering to
      others? She wondered. She could not help wondering, because
      her own flesh rebelled so fiercely. She hated poverty and
      housework, and coal fires, and the smell of dishcloths, and
      the greasy water in which you had washed up, and the reek
      of boiled cabbage, and the eternal dusting, and the washing
      of soiled clothes. Always, her sensitive gorge was rising,
      and her fastidious and eager spirit shrinking from the
      things she had to touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an egotist I am," she thought and pulled the two
      arm-chairs apart, and sat down in one of them, shoulders
      rounded, her arms wrapped round her knees. Her little
      illusion of a transient basking before the fire had gone.
      She felt like a cat with a wet fur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irritably she picked up one of the illustrated papers and
      turned over its pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      How tantalizing! She found herself regarding pictures of
      the fortunate world parading and playing tennis where the
      sun shone and the sea was blue. Ah, that blue sea! She
      could imagine it, and the orange trees in fruit and flower,
      and the mimosa and the olives and the palms. A world of
      flowers and of sunlight, and of colour, and of spacious,
      golden hours. Things must happen down there. Sister Clare
      had passed a gorgeous three weeks at Monte Carlo. She had
      written letters, and sent them vivid picture-postcards in
      which sea and sky were two splashes of blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw the magazine aside, and sank back into the chair.
      Her mouth looked thin, and she bit restlessly at her lower
      lip. She was Cinderella, the new Cinderella, peevish and
      pale, with brown eyes that asked questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, she fell asleep. She had not meant to fall
      asleep; it just happened. And she slept the rest of the
      night there, to be wakened by a sound which she took to be
      the clamour of her alarum clock. In bed? Not a bit of it. A
      greyness was stealing in, and the fire was out, and she
      heard the grandfather clock striking the half hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      She jumped up. It was the back door bell that she had
      heard, and she found the red-nosed boy there, a young
      Blossom, with the milk can.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're late," she said crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Know I be. Muster Furze was up all night lambin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that got to do with it?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy stared at this ignorant and unreasonable creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'E were late with the milkin', o' course."
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt snubbed. So--he--had been up all night. And she
      wondered whether he felt as cross as she did.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      A little flickering yellowness in the tree tops, and the
      daffodils blown flat in Furze's orchard, such seemed the
      beginnings of the spring that year. Skipping lambs and
      bleating ewes, and the sallow blossom flashing a pale gold
      and the celandines out in the moist places. A night's gale
      had stripped tiles off the roof, and unroofed two of the
      lambing pens. On the soil it is the expected that happens,
      and a man of the soil must expect trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, looked at largely, life was very good, even when you
      had the stress of the year before you, and the weeds were
      ready to grow. Soon, the wryneck would be calling, and the
      cuckoo ringing the valley with its double note. Moreover,
      Arnold had bought a carpet, two basket chairs, a sofa, a
      small painted wood table, a fender, and a length of
      cretonne to be cobbled into curtains before the fire at
      night, with the lamb, the cat and the dog making a queer
      group upon the two sacks that served as a hearth rug.
      Furze's lips were very compressed over the making of those
      curtains, and he was inclined to breathe heavily. Bobbo
      would sit on his stumpy tail and watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the devil's this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His barley sugar eyes had observed many phenomena, but this
      stuff spread over Furze's knees--what was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Camouflage, old dog," said his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were times when he talked aloud to Bobbo, finding him
      a sympathetic animal, and not like Tibby the cat who was
      the blackest of egoists.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever missed an opportunity, old chap? Let an obvious
      rabbit get away--when it ought to have had no chance with
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bobbo had. He blinked his eyes at the lamb who was becoming
      a bit of a nuisance, and altogether too sure of himself,
      trotting and butting about the place as though the earth
      belonged to him. Bobbo was a disciplinarian so far as sheep
      were concerned; it was time the lamb went to school; he was
      getting through his period of long-legged and silly charm,
      and would soon be a stupid beast. Bobbo had no opinion of
      the brain of a sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze poked away carefully with his needle. The carpet was
      down in Mrs. Damaris' parlour, and the furniture arranged,
      and on the white walls he had tacked up three or four
      coloured pictures collected from some old magazines.
      Obviously, furnishing was some business, and he had tried
      the chairs, the sofa and the table in every sort of
      position, with the table somewhere in the centre of each
      scheme, and then had given it up, and left them all backed
      against the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman would do it in two minutes," he supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stitching steadily, he reflected as he often reflected on
      that lost opportunity. Why had he not gone to ask after the
      health of Captain and Mrs. Viner? How simple life might be,
      and how difficult one's silly moods and sensitiveness made
      it! He had let three days pass before he had taken young
      Blossom's place with the milk-can, and had had the door
      opened to him by a very unromantic wench from Carslake. Her
      manners had been as slatternly as her appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Viner not well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's abed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not as I knows of. Do I pay yer now, or do you send us a
      bill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I send in a bill. Will you give my compliments to Miss
      Viner, and say that I am sorry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl had gasped in his face, clutched the milk jug and
      closed the door upon him and his compliments. Compliments
      indeed! It might be a democratic age, but did the man who
      delivered the milk send up his condolences to a lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze stitched away at his curtains. A south-west wind was
      breathing about the house, and upon one window there was
      the patter of the rain, and upon the other the tapping of
      an apple bough in the orchard. He had left that bough
      uncut, like the brushing of its fingers against the
      lattice, for when a man lives alone sounds have a friendly
      significance. Warm rain and a southwest wind, lushing up
      the young grass in his meadows, and breathing gently upon
      the pear and the plum blossom! The sound of the wind in the
      chimney seemed to make a stirring in the heart of the old
      house, and he sat and listened as though those empty upper
      rooms were coming to life and filling with a presence. He
      could imagine feet going softly to and fro, a creaking of
      the old boards, hands busy with white linen. Yes, a woman's
      presence, breathing within the house as the south-west wind
      breathed outside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his woman's work aside, rose, and stood up with a
      questioning and inward stare, moved by some impulse that
      seemed to have come to him out of the wind.
      Whence--whither? Was man but a creature of the soil, and of
      the sky? Did all his yearnings and strivings grow out of
      the earth, and put out their inevitable leaves for the wind
      to play with? And leaves died. The trees cast them off, and
      the wind played with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became aware of Bobbo sitting up and solemnly watching
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moods, old chap, moods."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he took a candlestick from the shelf, and lit the
      candle with a brand from the fire, and opened the door of
      Mrs. Damaris' parlour. His head drooped a little. He had
      kept a dimly apprehended ideal shut up with his music in
      that little room, a room in which the perfume and the
      memory of some woman seemed to linger with a delicate, soft
      sadness. It was a woman's room, the one feminine room in
      that great empty old house. It needed a woman. Yes, good
      God, how it needed one! That furniture! Quite hopeless! Why
      on earth had he bought it? Because of a silly, shy male
      pride, and after a moment of mortification?
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not my job," he thought; "it should be hers."
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door deliberately and firmly, but his hand
      remained on the handle. He had gone down into sudden deep
      thought, and the candle, tilted askew, dripped grease upon
      the floor. He did not notice it. "Hers." And who was she?
      Was she the woman? Were hers the hands that were to
      complete the rough-hewn product of his labour, to give the
      soft and delicate touches to the home, to bring a sense of
      tenderness and beauty into it? Flowers, and soft fabrics,
      and pretty human things, human because of their
      association, and the soft breathing of her about the house,
      and the spell of her presence?
    </p>
    <p>
      Something very deep stirred in him. Five years of
      loneliness, and all that he had lacked! He began to yearn
      for it now with a fierceness that was part of his man's
      nature. He was not a man to love easily or soon. Oak, deep
      rich soil, tough fibre, a devotion that could be tragic. He
      stirred like a man in his sleep, and all the while the dog
      watched him. He became aware of the guttering candle and
      the grease on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear heart,--it is time. The spring is here."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. His deep blue eyes had light in them. He went
      and opened the door leading to the old staircase, and
      climbing it, passed slowly from room to room. He stood in
      the centre of each of them, looking gravely and intently
      round. Yes--this should be the woman's room, the one
      looking south over the roof of Mrs. Damaris' parlour and
      her garden. He must do something with that garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came down again to the fire, to find the dog standing
      absolutely still beside his chair, waiting and watching for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dreams, old chap."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog's cool nose nudged his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreams? But why should it be a dream?
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Colonel Sykes had finished his tea, and was standing at the
      window of the "Simla" dining-room, lighting a cigarette,
      and looking uncommonly complacent over it. He was tallish
      and slim, with a birdlike head and a high colour and very
      English blue eyes. He wore an eyeglass. His hair, growing
      thin, was of a dubious and yellowish brown, and most
      carefully spread like thin butter on a brown loaf. He
      looked youngish for eight and fifty, because of his
      slimness and his colour, but when that colour was examined
      more closely it lost much of its youthfulness, being a
      stippling of minute and twisted blood vessels. His
      appearance must have caused Colonel Sykes to pay much
      attention to detail. He shaved twice a day, so that he
      should never be caught with an incipient crop of grey
      stubble upon his chin. He was mostly seen in golfing
      clothes, grey, very baggy as to the knickers, with a blue
      and yellow "pull-over" under the coat, the stockings a soft
      fawn. He was alert, loquacious, and emphatic, and at
      emphatic moments he would drop his eye-glass out of his
      eye. His friendly loquacity was such that at times he would
      talk to his own reflection in a mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Sykes was a bachelor. Behind him his
      cook-housekeeper was clearing away the tea things from the
      oak table. An immensely tall woman, and incredibly ugly,
      with a broad flat colourless face, a black moustache, and
      grey hairs on her chin, she had been with Colonel Sykes for
      seven years. Her name was Death, Mrs. Jane Death. "Cheerful
      name" as the colonel put it--"and safe." Having lived the
      life, he appreciated safety. No chance of any romantic
      foibles being attached to Jane Death. "Might as well
      consider a little riskiness with Cleopatra's needle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Sykes completed the lighting of his cigarette and
      threw the match into a brass ash-tray on his writing table.
      The woman was still clearing the table, and he glanced a
      little testily over his left shoulder. What a time she was
      about it!
    </p>
    <p>
      The door closed upon the straight immensity of this black
      figure and china jiggering on a metal tea-tray. The colonel
      faced about and dropped his eye-glass. The thought had been
      recurring of late that Mrs. Death was becoming a little too
      authoritative. "Knows too much about me, damn it!" Which
      she did. Also, there was another reason for Toby Sykes'
      reaction against the funereal finality of the woman's name.
      Death? Not a bit of it. He was feeling young, sentimentally
      and benignly young, a well-tailored Orpheus capable of
      leading life back out of the shades, a bachelor Orpheus
      whose young old fingers were fidgeting to twang the strings
      of a romantic and domestic lyre! The inspiration piqued his
      mature youthfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the mantelpiece hung a mirror of the Regency period,
      and Colonel Sykes wandered firewards to look at himself in
      the mirror, carefully and with a certain complacent
      primness. He passed a hand over the back of his head, and
      gathering his eye-glass, adjusted it into his left eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capital, capital! Splendid, splendid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Notable words during the war, for the junior members of his
      mess had caught their colonel on one occasion in this very
      same pose, and addressing his own reflection. Irreverently
      they had christened him the "Parrot." Those words served
      him in every sort of crisis, or when he was feeling young,
      or had accepted a cigar, or wished to be sporting at golf,
      or to praise some noble sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid! Capital!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to the window, and from it he could look down
      the cinder Via Sacra he had created, and command the
      various homesteads, and by shifting his position a little
      he was able to obtain a view of a portion of the Viners'
      back garden. The Jamiesons had planted a golden privet
      hedge against a portion of the boundary fence and over the
      top of this hedge Colonel Sykes beheld a deck chair and a
      young woman sitting in it. It was an April day and warm,
      but the young woman was all wrapped up, April herself
      convalescing after March.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel's eyes grew sentimental.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor child--poor little Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-six was she! And he felt less than forty, and was
      quite sure that he could pass for forty-five. Splendid,
      splendid! Capital, capital! A pretty, affectionate,
      dark-eyed creature was Mary Viner, a young woman who stayed
      at home and did her job, God bless her, without much jam on
      her bread. The poor old Viners were very dull people,
      anecdotal sit-by-the-fire folk, and the woman Death would
      have made a much more suitable nurse for them than a pretty
      girl who ought to have been eating chocolates out of a box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Sykes stroked his chin and considered the girl in
      the deck chair. Poor little Mary! Life was rather hard for
      her, nothing but the filling of hot water bottles for a
      couple of amiable old bores; and there she was sunning
      herself after a nasty bout of 'flu. She needed a month at
      the seaside or in Switzerland, away from Harold Coode's
      patched shirt and his devotion, and the voices and the
      strawberry jam faces of the Jamieson children. Blatant
      people those Jamiesons. Sorry he had sold the land to them.
      And Coode was the sort of fellow who took off his hat when
      he met a funeral. Quite right--of course--and proper, but
      Coode would do it with too much nobility, or as though it
      was the one and only funeral he had ever met.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Sykes collected copies of <i>Punch,</i> and the
      <i>Graphic,</i> and the <i>Bystander.</i> Not that he
      needed an excuse to wander into the "Green Shutters"
      garden, and stand with an air of tender distinction beside
      Mary's chair. How was she to-day? Better? Capital, capital;
      splendid--splendid! For he was beginning to feel himself a
      veritable Lochinvar destined to snatch her up and carry her
      off to a world of sentimental happening. He was sure that
      she would make a sweet wife. He would buy a new car, teach
      her to play golf, and rid himself of the Death woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pausing with his bundle of magazines he looked with
      sentimental blue eyes in the direction of the gentle lady.
      Someone was coming up the cinder road, a man in a grey
      green suit, and wearing new brown boots that glistened.
      That fellow Furze--"Captain Furze!" To Colonel Sykes there
      was no incongruity in the reverting of a temporary captain
      to the status of a milkman, but when he saw Furze stop at
      the "Green Shutters" gate he felt challenged. What did the
      chap want there? Had he called for his money? The Viners
      were never anything but hard up. And the fellow could not
      be allowed to dun the household when Mary was lying there
      convalescing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously--no! Colonel Toby had begun to think of her as
      his Mary. He settled his eye-glass, tucked the magazines
      under one arm, and went out for kindly intervention should
      intervention be necessary. He rather hoped that it would.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the "Green Shutters" gate he saw no one on the
      doorstep. Had the fellow pushed his way in? Colonel Sykes
      deliberated, and then cut neatly round the house to the
      patch of grass at the back of it, to find Furze standing
      beside Mary Viner's chair. H'm, damned cheek! Surely--?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very much the great gentleman. He arrived
      convincingly on the other side of Mary's chair, eye-glass
      glimmering, magazines at the present, his heels together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, how are we to-day? Better? Capital, capital! Brought
      you a few things to look at."
    </p>
    <p>
      Very properly, when he had paid his homage to the lady, he
      attended to the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afternoon, Furze."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze smiled and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good afternoon, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next few moments were a little awkward, for Furze
      remained on the other side of the chair with an air of
      having as much right to be there as had Colonel Sykes,
      yes--and more right. He was twenty-five years younger; he
      had come in the spring of the year to this April woman; he
      made the Colonel look like a withered old chanticleer.
      Moreover, he had ease, and the repose of a strong thing
      rooted on that grass patch, a little shy and reserved, but
      capable of smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Toby did not feel like smiling. He dropped his
      eye-glass, picked up one of the magazines, and discovering
      a particular picture, displayed it before Mary's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See that. Sir Carnaby Jackson. Knew him in India. Used to
      play polo together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the photo of Sir Carnaby, and Colonel Sykes
      looked at her. What was the matter? Frightened? Yes, she
      looked frightened, distressed. Surely, that fellow had not
      come to present a bill for milk and eggs? He glanced under
      his yellow-grey eyebrows at Furze who was staring intently
      and with a puzzled gentleness at Mary's feet. Tucked up in
      the rug they had fidgeted themselves free, and one shoe was
      half off. The colonel was shocked. He saw Furze bend down
      as if he was doing the most natural thing in the world, he
      slipped the shoe back on to Mary Viner's foot, and
      readjusted the rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn the fellow!" thought Colonel Sykes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replaced his eye-glass, and discovered blushes, a
      glowing quivering face, and eyes that were veiled. No
      wonder! Infernal cheek of the chap! He felt excessively hot
      and annoyed. Capital, capital, splendid, splendid! No, not
      exactly. And Furze had his hands in his pockets, and was
      looking down at the rug-covered feet, and was smiling as in
      a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Sykes cleared his throat. Something needed
      saying--and the remark that arrived had to be directed to
      old Hesketh who appeared with a trowel and a trug basket
      containing--well--of all things--the scrapings of the
      chicken house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha--Viner, active again--I see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hesketh was one of God's most simple creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little something for my sweet peas, Sykes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capital--capital!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the surprise was yet to come. The big fellow appeared
      to wake out of his dream. He was smiling at old Hesketh and
      taking the trug from him, and though they had only
      approached each other over milk bills, they went off
      together like a couple of dogs who understood each other
      from the first mingling of their doggy sense of smell.
      Furze was saying something to the old man. They walked on
      past the six blackcurrant bushes and the two scraggy
      pyramid apple trees to where old Hesketh cherished his
      sweet peas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Sykes' eye-glass fell out of his eye, and he bent
      devotedly and just a little deprecatingly over the April
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear little lady--I do hope--ahem--that that fellow has
      not been--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She went the colour of June.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brown eyes were all blurred. Colonel Sykes smoothed the
      air with a suave hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You really must excuse me, little lady. I am concerned.
      The fellow has been worrying you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was almost voiceless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worrying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, with some wretched milk bill--or other."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face seemed to sink into an extraordinary and blank
      silence. She was groping for something--her handkerchief.
      She found it and pressed it over her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      2
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Sykes never discovered the truth of the matter, for
      when his April Lady had smothered what he took to be a
      spasm of coughing, she erected a barrier between herself
      and that too intimate and sentimental eye-glass. She spread
      one of the papers he had brought her, and made desultory
      remarks upon the illustrations, while he had to stand at
      the back of her chair in order to see what she was talking
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha," he said to himself, "sensitive--proud, of course.
      Does not wish to talk about it. Such sweet, silent pride is
      adorable."
    </p>
    <p>
      When all the pictures had been looked at twice <i>Punch</i>
      was put away, and then the brown eyes of Mary Viner
      rediscovered her lover. Colonel Toby's eye-glass glimmered
      towards the same quarter, the strip of ground beyond the
      currant bushes and the apple trees. Dash it, if the fellow
      had not got his coat off, and possessed himself of a spade,
      and was hard at it opening a trench for the planting of
      Captain Viner's sweet peas. And there was old Hesketh with
      his trugful--of--ahem--tipping it into the bottom of the
      trench that Furze was digging!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capital, capital! So--Mr. Furze comes in and does odd jobs
      for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not appear to catch the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A useful fellow. Might employ him myself--now and again.
      By the way--what does he charge by the hour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brown eyes remained utterly innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. Why not ask him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had had his "devoir" given him by his dear lady, and
      since his sense of direction was limited and his only
      movements were one of advance or retreat, he marched across
      to where Furze was digging and old Hesketh was scattering
      the colour that was to be. Mary could do nothing else but
      watch. She saw Arnold Furze pause in his digging, and stand
      with his two hands on his spade. Colonel Sykes was
      speaking, and Furze was looking into the colonel's face.
      The man with the spade had dignity, and realizing his
      dignity she was both afraid and glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Sykes returned to her. He did not see the faces of
      the two Jamieson children projecting above the fence, each
      with a penny screwed into an eye, but Mary saw them, and
      all her sympathy was with the colonel. The Jamieson
      children always produced in her an angry and self-conscious
      seriousness. She lost her sense of humour--and she had not
      too much of it--when those two strawberry-jam faces
      appeared above the fence. Little beasts! Her elderly
      Orpheus discovered her a readier listener to his
      sentimental music.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man's too busy. I asked him. Wonder if I put my foot
      in it, Mary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She dared to remind him that Furze was a farmer, and that
      when a man had a hundred and twenty acres and cattle to
      look after--Besides, in spite of a surface smile, she had
      her grievance against the great man. She could not decide
      how much or how little guile lay behind that eye-glass.
      Having lived with her father's simplicity for twenty years
      and marvelled at it, she was on the watch for a like
      simplicity in other old soldiers. For to her Colonel Sykes
      was old, though he did not appear to know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very properly he asked after her mother, while she tried
      not to see those detestable children, each with one blue
      eye and one copper one. They were beginning to giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother is rather weak--still."
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Sykes had "Capital, capital"--on the tip of his
      tongue but managed to withdraw the words before they had
      escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She must be careful. These spring days--treacherous--you
      know. Sure--now--that you don't feel chilly, dear lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She assured him that she felt quite warm, and was suddenly
      and horribly afraid that he was about to do something
      foolish. She felt it in the air, a quivering of his sandy
      eyelashes over eyes that were suffused and tender. O,
      bother the men; he was going to be as troublesome as poor
      Coode! And then the Jamieson children extracted her from
      this delicate situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giggles, and the sound of a mouth making a smacking sound
      on the back of a fat red hand! Colonel Sykes, looking round
      sharply, saw the two faces and the pennies. He glared. The
      two heads disappeared, and there were sounds of joy behind
      the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lingered a moment, very stiff and proper, keeping that
      brave circle of crystal glued into his red face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn those infernal children! That's what comes of selling
      land to such people."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary lay relaxed, eyes half closed, watching Furze and her
      father.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Under her rug lay a bunch of primroses. He had brought them
      wrapped up and hidden in a clean handkerchief. "We have
      lots of these. I thought you might like a few." He had
      stood holding them with an air of grave shyness until she
      had put out a hand and taken them, and thanked him, not
      looking at his face but at the flowers. She had heard his
      voice going on. "They came out of Gore Wood. Masses of them
      there since I had some oaks felled and the underwood cut
      over. Same with other flowers. Bluebells later, like a bit
      of blue sky fallen down on the ground. And then--foxgloves.
      I hope you are better?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A bunch of primroses, that was Colonel Sykes' imaginary
      bill, concealed from the conquering eye-glass, lying snugly
      somewhere near her bosom. She lay and watched the two over
      yonder, the strong man with the spade, and poor old Hesketh
      with his egg-shaped head looking too heavy for his thin
      neck, and his long legs flopping about as though neither
      quite knew what the other was doing. She heard Furze
      speaking to her father, and his voice had a gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt warmed, and yet curiously alert and afraid. He
      disturbed her. He appeared to her as deliberate as the
      seasons, a vernal equinox of a man, part of the inevitable
      purpose of the soil. And he was no fool. Cinder Town was
      full of fools, nice and otherwise, and there were times
      when she grasped the implication of their foolish
      ineffectualness. That was why Cinder Town was. His chousing
      of Colonel Toby had impressed her. So wisely done, and yet
      so naturally! To go off with her father and get a spade and
      to start digging! She had known at once that his spade
      would outlast and out-talk Colonel Sykes' tongue. Doomsday!
      No, assuredly he was not to be hustled out of his
      opportunity, having made it and seized it, or--perhaps
      planted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that presently he would come back to her and stand
      beside her chair. She was both afraid and excited. His eyes
      looked at you as though you were a piece of land that he
      wanted and meant to have, not arrogantly, but with profound
      conviction. She neither accepted her liking of him nor
      repelled it. He was just there, to be looked at and
      wondered about, something new and strange, an open doorway
      in her dull life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work was over. He had put on his coat. He came towards
      her with her father, still carrying the spade. He stood
      beside her with a kind of glowing silence, looking at her
      figure, for an impulse that was feminine had made her slip
      the rug back so that the bunch of primroses showed. She did
      not mean all that he thought she meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so glad you are better."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at old Hesketh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was good of you, sir, to let me--Yes, I must be getting
      back now. Work is never done on a farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hat, and the glow of him seemed to envelop
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have saved my back," said her father. "Mary, Mr. Furze
      ought to have had tea with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      She found her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--another day--perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>

      For Arnold Furze, life, that spring, renewed all its
      strangeness and its mystery. It began with the singing of
      birds in the greyness of the dawn, a chant such as it
      seemed to him he had never heard before, the whole earth
      waking suddenly into exultation. Pipings in the orchard and
      in the hedgerows. But there were other volumes of song, a
      massed chorus that came from Gore Wood, and another and
      fainter thrilling that trembled across the meadows from
      Rushy. A blackbird in the "Doomsday" orchard led off the
      chant each morning, and a thrush ended it, piping
      "Awake--awake" to the blossom that slumbered. Furze never
      drew a curtain, for daylight found him stirring, and in the
      long light evenings he was about till dusk sent him to bed.
      The rising sun looked in at the orchard window, and lit up
      the rosy lips of the apple blossom, and turned the young
      green of the pear leaves to gold. Masses of white cloud
      floated brilliantly above the dim blue woods. And on rainy
      mornings even the rain sang a song to him. Murmuring upon
      the great, spreading roof of the cow-house, it joined its
      soft moist music to the purr of the milk into the milking
      pail.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half-past five was his usual hour for rising, but
      this spring he rose at five, adding those extra minutes to
      the day's labour of mystery. Those still and secret hours
      of the dawn, with the yellow sunlight stealing through, and
      dew everywhere, and the stillness and the solitude, how he
      loved them. Each dawn came with a sense of adventure. He
      would put a match to some kindling and hang the kettle over
      it, and go out and up the lane as far as Six Firs, Bobbo at
      his heels--and as grey as the dew-covered grass. He would
      climb the mound, and stand for a moment looking towards the
      little red and white and green and brown houses. Cinderella
      Town! They were asleep down there. They had nothing to get
      them out of bed, no clamorous crops, and no cows with
      swelling udders, and all the essential urgency of the soil.
      But she--she would be up earlier than most of them,
      mysteriously busy about mysteriously simple things,
      lighting fires and sweeping rooms. The distant
      contemplation of her labours fascinated him, for they were
      coming to have a personal meaning for him, a glamour, a
      tenderness. The man in him reached out to the imagined
      woman in her. He saw her at "Doomsday," moving about the
      house, more happily busy perhaps than she could be down
      yonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wandering back with his face to the dawn he would see his
      old house as a symbol, raising its chimneys above the young
      green of the larches. The flames of the wood fire would be
      licking the black kettle. That early cup of tea and slice
      of bread and butter had the flavour of a sacrament. Then
      followed his half-hour of service. Chicken coops had been
      banished from Mrs. Damaris' garden; he had scythed the
      grass, and collected some flagstones and made a path, and
      now he was at work digging a border under the grey wall and
      two beds--one on either side of the path. He had begged,
      bought, or scrounged plants, sweet-williams, Canterbury
      bells, white pinks, snapdragons. He was sowing annuals,
      larkspur, correopsis, candytuft, marigold, flax, Virginia
      stock, mignonette, nasturtiums. My Lady's garden should be
      dressed and perfumed after all these years. Flowers for
      Cinderella.
    </p>
    <p>
      For she had taken his primroses.
    </p>
    <p>
      His large simplicity moved to the new measure. Never had he
      felt so strong or so tireless, and yet he seemed to have
      more time to think and to feel. The days had lost all sense
      of effort. Driving the milk cans to Melhurst station, or
      harrowing his wheat, or rolling the meadows, or milking, or
      hoeing his bean field, he felt life moving easily, like a
      young man well mounted setting out upon an adventure. His
      love for the old place increased. He would wander out in
      the dusk, with the birds singing their vespers, and the
      woods growing a greyish blue, and a faint mist spreading
      over the Long Meadow. Perhaps he would wander in among the
      oaks of Gore Wood, where the young oak foliage was the
      colour of gold above the pale faces of the last primroses.
      Wild hyacinths were beginning to make a blueness there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should he not ask her to come and see them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he wanted her to see it all, to be able to spread it
      before her in its beauty as he saw it, the fading gorse and
      the yellow broom of the Wilderness, and the young bracken
      like shepherds' crooks, and the golden spikes of the
      beeches bursting with an incredible greenness, and his
      orchard in bloom, and those emerald larches, and Rushy Pool
      with a few kingcups still left, and his meadows, and his
      sleek violet-eyed cattle. Surely she would love it all as
      he did, and feel the beauty and the goodness and the
      cleanness of this English land. Devoutly dreaming, he
      believed that she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary Viner, Mary Viner."
    </p>
    <p>
      The thrush who perched on the old cedar sang her name. He
      saw the face in the milk, her lips in the budding apple
      blossom, her eyes in the brown water.
    </p>
    <p>
      But chiefly now he loved to loiter in Mrs. Damaris' garden
      under the window of the white parlour, for it was here that
      his man's thoughts took shape. He would stand with his back
      against the stone wall, and watch the light die out of the
      sky, and the stars prick the increasing blackness. Here was
      grass for her feet, and flowers for her hands. Next spring
      it should be a mass of hyacinths and tulips. Music in
      colour--a Schubert's song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, perhaps, he would go in and feel a little chilled by
      the empty and barren house. No fit place for her yet, but
      if her heart was as his he felt that he could pull the
      welkin down to hang it on the walls for her. Hangings of
      blue and of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile he would light the lamp, and sit down at the
      rough table with the account book and a pencil and some odd
      pieces of paper, and make calculations and scribble little
      sums. His figures were like himself, large and simple and
      steadfast. He would run his hand over his wavy brown head.
      Supposing he did without the corn-crusher and the new wagon
      and harness in the autumn? The reaper he must have. The
      farm was showing a profit; he had money at the bank; he
      felt sure that his strong hands could drag more money ont
      of the soil. Yes, supposing he furnished a bedroom, the
      parlour, the sitting-room and the kitchen, not flimsily,
      no, but with gear fit for her? By God--of course it could
      be done. The soil had been swallowing everything; it was
      fat and lusty; let the house have its turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold was a man of method--even as a lover, and part of
      his success as a farmer was due to his methodical
      intelligence. He kept accurate accounts, a diary, and a day
      book in which he entered up the work for the week in front
      of him, and the keeping of these books was an act of
      heroism, as any man who has to strive with the soil will
      tell you. To feel dog-tired and sleepy, and yet to make
      yourself sit down and scribble! That is where will-force
      comes in, and Furze had been taught that half the farming
      of England is laborious and haphazard, without that last
      flip of intelligence which knows where the muck goes, or
      how the money comes, and has it down on paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did his scribbling last thing at night, after half an
      hour at his piano, sitting in socks, breeches and shirt,
      his feet tucked back under his chair, both arms spread on
      the table. He hated this scribbling but he made himself do
      it, and many had been the times when he had blessed himself
      for doing it. It was a check on himself, and a check on
      Will Blossom, for however good a man's body is--his brain
      may be a sheep's, and such was Will's.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now Furze would pause and dream a little. He might win
      a partner. And perhaps she would sit at a table and write
      for him while he dictated the day's doings. A wife was
      interested--surely?
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are tired, Arnold. Sit and smoke and talk, and I'll
      write."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he would love her for that, and perhaps she would love
      doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The routine of his life began to be altered in a dozen
      significant ways. His camp-bed had ascended into one of the
      bedrooms; the kitchen became a kitchen, and the living-room
      something of what it should be. Logs ceased to be piled in
      a corner; the work-bench was transferred to an out-house.
      The home-made table had its legs planed and stained, and
      its top covered with a blue and white cloth. Sarah Blossom
      gave the house two days a week instead of one, and
      she--being a woman--had eyes in her head and a tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Muster Furze be sweet on someone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, because a man does not become suddenly fussy about his
      house, and rise to table cloths and electroplated spoons
      and forks without an adequate reason. And that garden, and
      those flowers! Mrs. Blossom was a little, thin, rat-trap of
      a woman with a bluish tip to her long nose, and straight,
      mouse-coloured hair dragged back very tight off her
      forehead. She was a careful woman, close, with shiny and
      clutching red hands. Furze had always noticed her hands. He
      disliked the idea of them touching his food.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blossom talked. In such little, mean lives as hers
      talking becomes a vice, a vocal drunkenness or
      incontinence. She got her excitement out of talking. Yes,
      Furze was wearing two shirts a week instead of one; changed
      his working shirt after milking-time. And three soft
      collars a week instead of one and a half. And he had a new
      pair of brown shoes, and he shaved himself every day. And
      he had planed those table legs and stained them! Hee, hee,
      hee!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blossom had an irreverent mind. Those table legs
      seemed to her a great jest. She would go off into thin
      laugher that was rather like a sheep's bleating, and press
      her red hands to her breastless bosom, and screw her head
      on one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't know who 'tis--but there's a gel--somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was always cross-questioning Will.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ain't you seen a gel--any time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Will hadn't. Domestic life had tended to make him more and
      more like a blue-eyed bull, surly and sluggish, and
      breaking out occasionally into exasperated bellowings. He
      was a good fellow, but in the bull-ring of marriage his
      wife's tongue maddened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guess it be one of the gels at Cinder Town."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so eager to get her nasty little blue-tipped nose
      into the mystery of Arnold Furze's transfiguration that she
      would go wandering down the lane of an evening, ostensibly
      to gather rabbit food. The Blossom cottage stood on the
      road to Rotherbridge. When met and spoken to butter would
      not melt in her mouth, but remained there to turn rancid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Evening, Mrs. Blossom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening to you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had caught him in the lane, wearing a clean collar, and
      with something bulging in his pocket, and going towards the
      main road. She had an apron full of green herbage. She
      idled after him far enough to see that he went down to the
      Sandihurst Estate. There were happenings in the air. Will
      had had orders to have the blue wagon and the greys ready
      early to-morrow morning. There was to be a sale at
      Melhurst. Mrs. Blossom had seen the auctioneer's placard
      posted on the back of Mr. Burnham's cow-shed.

    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Viner was mowing the lawn. She herself called it a
      grass plot, but to her mother and her father it was the
      lawn, twenty feet square between the road and the fence and
      the house. An ash path divided it on Harold Coode's side
      from the herbaceous border; towards the Jamiesons it was
      flanked by a privet hedge that did not exclude the red and
      intrusive faces of the Jamieson children. The lawn held a
      circular bed in its centre where Captain Viner tried to
      grow violas, and the slugs saw to it that his success was
      relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Viner mowing-machine was like most things in Cinder
      Town, a make-shift, cheaply American, and second hand at
      that. It gnawed the grass instead of cutting it. It had
      clenched its teeth upon many rusty nails and small stones,
      and its soul had grown churlish and embittered. It clanked
      and rattled and squeaked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary went to and fro with the cross-piece of the handle
      pressing close to her young bosom. She remained strictly
      attentive to the business in hand, for poor Coode was
      hovering like a celestial scout-master eager for a day's
      good deed. She knew that if she relented ever so little he
      would come and hang devotedly over the fence. "I say--do
      you think--you--ought--to do that? After 'flu? Why not let
      me do it for you?" Also, she had seen Colonel Toby
      strolling in his garden, smoking a cigar, and that little
      circle of crystal had flashed frequently in her direction.
      "Fine young woman. Cutting grass! No false pride. Capital,
      capital!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze came to the gate a moment after the knives of the
      machine had jammed, and she was trying to extract a rusty
      wire-nail from the mower's teeth. Hot, flushed, and a
      little peeved, she looked up and saw him. He was half
      inside the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His glance had a deep and lingering steadfastness. It
      disturbed and fluttered her, so that her colour came more
      quickly. Her brown eyes were elusive. Yes, she was in
      trouble. This beastly old machine--!
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled and bent over the mower.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Builders scatter their nails--like the bread in the Bible.
      On grass--though."
    </p>
    <p>
      His strong brown fingers freed the blades. He tossed the
      bent nail into the flower bed, and without a "Shall I?" or
      an "If you please," began to finish the job for her. And
      she stood and watched him, feeling vividly conscious of him
      and of herself, and of all the windows and the gardens, and
      of poor Coode melting away nobly, and of Colonel Sykes'
      eye-glass fixed upon them like the eye-piece of a
      telescope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wants sharpening," he said suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She agreed that most probably it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And oiling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I use the oiler belonging to my bicycle, and I've lost
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bad luck for the machine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, smiling, and she had an impression of white
      teeth and very deep blue eyes in a very brown face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I use a scythe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't that--rather difficult?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not when you have the hang of it and know how to have the
      blade. Makes a nicer noise, too. Purrs."
    </p>
    <p>
      A few stridings to and fro and the mowing was finished. He
      picked up the machine. "Where do you keep it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--in the tool-shed."
    </p>
    <p>
      She led the way to the tool-shed, a brown box no bigger
      than a small chicken-house. It also contained her bicycle,
      and a barrow with a wobbly wheel, and a few odd tools. She
      felt apologetic about the tool-shed, as she felt apologetic
      about nearly everything connected with her existence in
      Cinder Town. How trivial it all seemed, and she resented
      its triviality, for she conceived herself cheapened by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you are better?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had put the mower away and had shut the door, and she
      was wondering whether she should ask him into the house.
      She was ashamed of the house. Also there was the question
      of supper, and even the sunset and the soft green splendour
      of this spring evening were effaced by her vision of a
      small leg of mutton carved to the bone and a few cold
      potatoes waiting in the larder. Her father was one of those
      dear and hopeless souls who can never learn to understand a
      woman's sensitiveness, her hatred of being caught with no
      cake for tea. "Mary,--Mr. Furze will stay to supper." And
      how could she produce that scraggy end of mutton?
      Supper--too! Real people dined.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said that she was quite well now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--much better, thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was taking something out of the side pocket of his coat,
      six brown eggs in a paper bag. He handed them to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thought your mother might like these."
    </p>
    <p>
      The nay of her mood gave place to the yea. She was touched.
      Six brown eggs in a paper bag! She had to ask him into the
      house after that, and to show the eggs to Mrs. Viner who
      was a child in these matters. "See what Mr. Furze has
      brought you." Old Hesketh, who was a sahib, however simple
      he might be, tried to make Furze take his arm-chair. "Sit
      down, my dear fellow"; but Furze would not hear of it. He
      sat on a hard chair in front of the fire, between the two
      old people, with Mary on a footstool and quite close to
      him, so close that his dream seemed to be coming down to
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked, or rather Hesketh and his guest talked, while
      Mrs. Charlotte knitted and threw at Furze quick bird-like
      glances. She was considering the man who brought them
      flowers and eggs, and who wanted to marry her daughter. A
      farmer, but a farmer who could claim to have that notable
      word "gentleman" added to him. Yes, Mr. Arnold
      Furze--gentleman farmer. Mrs. Viner asked of fate to be
      allowed her gentleman. Captain Furze was not "service," of
      course, not a pukka captain, but in these topsy-turvy days
      did it matter? The little old lady's bright-eyed, bird-like
      mind reflected a more clearly cut image of life than did
      her daughter's, for she had lived her life, and Mary had
      not. Even a twittering old lady must be allowed her
      philosophy, and a wise, thrush-like glance at the
      responsible man. To Mrs. Viner it was most important that a
      husband should be kind; strong, too, and capable of using a
      protective shoulder; also just a little exacting at times.
      So she knitted and watched and listened, her head on one
      side like an attentive bird's. She did not want to lose
      Mary, but if Mary had to be lost, well--"Doomsday" was very
      near; moreover, Mrs. Charlotte liked Arnold Furze. He was
      kind; he could sit still and talk quietly and naturally to
      two old people; she watched his eyes when he looked at her
      daughter. Yes,--that was the way a man should look at a
      woman, with human wonder at so human and wonderful a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most women--an innocent snob--she could be impressed
      by frankness--and by the easy carriage of the man who
      possesses what has been called inward dignity. Furze talked
      a little about the farm and his work. He was so unashamed
      of it that Mrs. Viner felt that there was nothing to be
      ashamed of. He could laugh--too--at some of his struggles
      and his make-shifts. Not one of your fussy, irritable
      little men, who must walk on his toes and crow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to see the bluebells in Gore Wood."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes seemed to catch the firelight as he spoke of the
      wild flowers and looked down at Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You too, sir, if you are fond of flowers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cinderella, one hand along the cheek turned to the fire,
      seemed to muse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should love to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any time you like. Go where you please, you know. The
      Wilderness too is a picture, all yellow broom and young
      bracken. It lies above Rushy Pool and Wood."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for half a minute after offering her free
      trespass upon his farm, and then suddenly he rose, bent to
      Mrs. Charlotte, and laid a big and restraining hand on old
      Hesketh's shoulder. "Please don't get up, sir." Captain
      Viner produced the inevitable invitation to supper, and
      there was a moment of feminine suspense quickly relieved by
      Furze's refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary went with him to the door, and since the dusk had
      fallen and she was grateful to him for going, she went a
      little farther. He paused at the gate and held it open as
      though he hoped that she would go with him as far as the
      main road. He looked at the sky, and at a moon coming up
      over Beech Ho.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that when I say a thing I mean it, Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time that he had called her Mary, and he
      uttered the name as though it was both beautiful and
      sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you do. You mean--about the farm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, go when you please, and take what you please.
      Fruit--flowers--anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved out into the road, and she felt herself drawn out
      into the dusk. The spell of his tenderness was upon her,
      the gentle lure of his strength. And there may have been
      some curiosity behind her vague emotion, and a little
      thrill of conscious power.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a moment. Her drifting out with him into
      the dusk was so blessed a happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to Melhurst to-morrow. There is a big sale on
      there. I am taking the wagon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That sounds as though you were going to spend a great deal
      of money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as little as I can for as much as I can get."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Animals?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She fancied that he laughed slightly and soundlessly, if
      laughter can be soundless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--furniture and things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--furniture."
    </p>
    <p>
      Very significant--that, and she knew it. The nay in her
      felt that it was time to turn back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You love old things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old things for an old house. I shall be away most of the
      day. Wish me luck, will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," she said, pausing by the Engledews' gate, and
      looking at the moon; "I wish you all sorts of bargains."
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted there--she going back to that dull little
      house, and he to the great spaces of his fields and
      woodlands. He felt that he could throw his hat as high as
      the tops of the Six Firs, but she had been caught by a
      sudden panic of seriousness. She was looking beyond him,
      and through the quivering air of her emotion at the
      ultimate choice and its finalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doomsday! A farm!

    <p>
      That she should happen to see the wagon pass down the
      Melhurst road next morning was a mere matter of
      coincidence. Furze was standing up in the wagon like a
      charioteer, and she saw the blue wagon and the grey horses
      and his brown figure melt into the young green of May. A
      mere coincidence, yes, but it would seem that the
      subconscious part of her had been at work during the night,
      and that an idea was materializing. The bluebells in Gore
      Wood! And to begin with, the idea and its inspiration were
      as delicate and as virginal as the very scent of the wild
      hyacinths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold had given her the right of free trespass upon his
      farm, and her choosing to exercise this right while he was
      away at Melhurst concealed a mood rather than a motive. She
      hurried through the morning's work, brought out her old
      bicycle as though she were bound for Carslake, but when the
      sentinel firs had passed her into the Doomsday lane she
      dismounted and loitered. She was neither very sure of
      herself nor of her purpose. The passion to escape, to have
      a good time, to attain self-expression were like the surge
      of the sap. And so she loitered, asking herself questions,
      treading with unsure feet on the edge of her lover's world.
      What, as a woman, did she mean by self-expression? Escape,
      whither and how, and to what end? Not to be rooted in
      routine and interminable repetition? She saw the Doomsday
      woods rising about her, green with a golden and changeful
      greenness, and cleft with blue distances. The larches made
      her pause, throwing their reflections in the still water of
      the pond where the water-crowfoot was showing white. A
      wood-pigeon crooned. There was a great silence everywhere,
      save for the sounds made by living things, the underchant
      of a spring day. Beautiful? Yes, she had to allow it its
      beauty, and her blood stirred a little, and her brown eyes
      became elvish. She turned down towards the farm buildings
      where a sunny sloth seemed to prevail, and no live thing
      moved save the hens and sparrows and two or three young
      porkers scampering over the straw of a byre. Will and his
      boy were up the fields. She was bound ostensibly for Gore
      Wood, but the way to it was unknown to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning her bicycle against the gate she looked at the
      house--his house. She had entered it but once, on that
      night when she had come for milk, and a place looks so
      different in the daylight. The house, as a thing of beauty,
      laid its appeal upon her. Its grey walls and mellowed
      brick, its lattices and great spreading roof and massive
      chimneys touched the romance in her, and displayed the old
      velvet of its texture to her sleek, comfort-loving soul.
      And the smother of green about it, and the secrecy, and its
      little silent lattices with the glimmer of their glass
      lozenges, and the falling meadows, and the old cedar, and
      the great thorn hedges turning white! She felt that she
      would like to touch it, know it more intimately. And why
      not? He had given her leave to go everywhere, and the
      garden and the orchard were part of the everywhere. Not
      into the house itself--of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Eve in her was tempted, and no Eve is without the
      knowledge of some secret apple, even though it be hidden in
      the foliage of a charming and wilful vagueness. She fell to
      the beckoning path beside the yew hedge. There were steps
      that went up and steps that went down. She eschewed the
      ascent, and descending, found herself in Mrs. Damaris'
      garden. She did not know that she was observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this was his garden! She wandered across the scythed
      grass, and along the stone path, looking about her a little
      furtively. She was conscious of the windows of the house,
      and yet when she turned about to meet their scrutiny she
      realized that they were sightless eyes. No curtains, no
      blinds! Also, it seemed to her that the garden had a
      newness in its oldness. The work was recent, the very
      plants fetched in hurriedly to a love feast. She stood
      against the stone wall, and looked across the Doom Paddock
      to the great thorn hedge. Two large black pigs were feeding
      in the paddock, their black bellies brushed by the
      buttercups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observed--yes, and by Mrs. Sarah Blossom who had come in to
      scrub out the bedrooms, and who, by standing well back in
      one of the upper rooms, could see my lady without being
      seen. So, it was Miss Mary Viner--Will had been told that
      morning that Captain, Mrs. and Miss Viner had wander-rights
      over the farm, and Will had told Mrs. Will. Captain and
      Mrs. Viner--indeed! What did Captain and Mrs. Viner
      signify? It was the girl he wanted down among the
      bluebells, yes, or on a summer evening in a quiet corner
      when the bracken was growing high. Miss Mary Viner!
    </p>
    <p>
      And here she was. Mrs. Sarah took a good look at her from
      the back of that upper window, and considered the situation
      and its possibilities as they concerned herself. The future
      Mrs. Furze deserved the soft side of her tongue. Mrs. Sarah
      wiped her hands on her apron, and descended the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary heard the sound of a lattice being opened, and she
      faced about to see a woman shaking a duster from the window
      of Mrs. Damaris' parlour. The woman smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary felt caught, though she had every right to be in
      Arnold Furze's garden. She was quick in remembering her
      excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--good morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      She approached the window, putting a pleasant face upon the
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you tell me the way to Gore Wood?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I can, Miss Viner. The flowers--they be
      lovely--in the spring of the year."
    </p>
    <p>
      She conveyed to Mary the impression of a friendly but very
      respectful creature ripe for a gossip, but very respectful
      gossiping, of course. Miss Viner was Miss Viner. O, yes,
      Mrs. Sarah knew how the honey was spread or should be
      spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine old house, Miss, be'nt it? Yes--I come up Tuesdays
      and Fridays. Mr. Furze--he be mighty fond of it--All beams
      it be. And there be a bedroom all walled with wood. I can't
      call to mind the right word for it, exactly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Panelling," said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that be the word, Miss Viner. All oak--it be--and
      black as black."
    </p>
    <p>
      She flicked the duster, folded it up, and looked
      obsequiously sly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got to be going down to the cottage to get my man's
      dinner ready, Miss. Mr. Furze, he be away at Melhurst. I be
      leaving the key in the door. Maybe--you'd like to look over
      the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze's broad gesture had not opened the house to her, nor
      should one accept the authority of a Sarah Blossom, so Mary
      thanked her and denied herself the time to make use of an
      unlocked door. She said again that she was going down to
      Gore Wood, and had been looking for someone to show her the
      way. Mrs. Sarah came out of the house, wearing an old cap
      of her husband's, and looking if anything more sly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll show you, Miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the lane where Mary had left her bicycle
      against the gate. Mrs. Blossom assured her that the bicycle
      would be quite safe there. The way to Gore Wood lay through
      the field gate opposite the pond, and down across the Gore
      Field where the short-horns were pastured. Mrs. Sarah left
      Mary at the gate and went on up the lane. She was sure that
      Miss Viner would make use of the key when she was left
      alone with the temptation.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It would appear that Mrs. Sarah knew her Mary better than
      Mary knew herself. The temptress had raised the edge of the
      curtain, and there was more behind Mary's fall than a
      natural and irresponsible curiosity. She was a twentieth
      century Eve. When romance offered itself, she fingered the
      magic garment, turned up the lining, and tried to estimate
      its wearing qualities. Such caution may be held to be
      either wise or foolish, balancing on a knife edge, or
      trying to teach nature to turn a wheel in a cage. People
      who wade cautiously into life like a timid girl paddling on
      a rather bleak foreshore are apt to be too conscious of the
      existence of crabs and pebbles. Nature prefers the plunger.
      Or you may more quickly learn to swim by being pushed into
      the deeps.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left her bicycle against the gate and returned down the
      path. The eyes of the house looked at her, and she
      translated into their stare the varied thoughts and
      feelings of the moment. They reproached her; they were
      hostile; they hid things that she had a right to know; they
      challenged; they were both shy and sad. Surely a woman is
      justified in exploring that corner of life into which a man
      is devotedly seeking to inveigle her? Woman's eyes see what
      a man's might miss, or they see them differently. The house
      is the woman's workshop. Why should she not inspect it
      before agreeing to work there?
    </p>
    <p>
      The key was in the door. She went in and closed the door
      behind her, finding herself in the living-room, alone with
      Tibby the black cat somnolent and couchant on a windowsill.
      The cat did not turn a whisker. Mary was all eyes. Yes, the
      room looked different, more lived in or less lived in, she
      did not quite know which, but she thought it had a bare and
      draughty feeling. Three doors opening into it! She tried
      the one that Furze had closed when she had come for the
      milk, and she remembered her own flash of uncomfortable
      suspicion. Some other girl or woman! She stood in the
      middle of the little white room with its old Georgian grate
      and its deep window-seat. The sun poured in. She sat down
      in the window-seat and looked about her at the furniture
      Furze had collected, a prim sofa, two rather
      uncomfortable-looking chairs, a green and blue carpet that
      was already beginning to fade. And that painted wooden
      table! Poor man! She was conscious of a feeling of dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the whole house like this? Driven from Mrs. Damaris'
      parlour by a curiosity that was self-conscious and a little
      ashamed, she found the stairs and went up to explore the
      rambling bedrooms. Their emptiness astonished her. Not a
      chair, not a bedstead, nothing but one or two old packing
      cases! Opening yet another door she discovered herself on
      the threshold of Furze's room, and though she shrank back
      almost instantly, she had lingered long enough to realize
      its makeshifts. A camp bed, a dressing table contrived out
      of two sugar boxes, a cheap, painted chest of drawers,
      clothes hanging on pegs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary closed the door. She felt that she had been spying
      upon his secret poverty. She was swept by a little gust of
      shame and pity. Poor man--what a house! But her pity could
      not save her from a feeling of gradual and intense
      depression. The great, rambling, empty barrack of a place
      chilled her even though the sun was shining. It would be a
      tyrannical, heart-breaking house to care for. And her
      feelings of depression deepened when she explored the
      kitchen and its belongings. It had a brick floor, an old
      stone sink with no water laid on, and a vast and rusty
      range whose bars seemed to snarl at her like unfriendly
      teeth. What a horror of a place, with one single dark
      looking cupboard, and a larder that smelt of mice! Even the
      "Green Shutters" kitchen was a paradise compared to this
      hole with its peeling walls and damp and chilly floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't," her heart cried, "oh--I couldn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt overwhelmed by the thought of the sordid struggle
      in which a woman would find herself involved. Water to be
      carried in, water to be heated, that ill-tempered savage
      old range to be fought or humoured, lamps to be cleaned and
      trimmed, floors washed down, while the peeling plaster fell
      into your frying pan. Not a decent cupboard; a plate rack
      that looked as though it had absorbed the grease of
      centuries; a sink that made her think of a drain.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went back to Mrs. Damaris' parlour and stood by the
      window where the sun poured in. She looked at the garden
      and the greenness of the hills. Yes, they were dressed and
      pleasant now, but she pictured them in the deeps of winter,
      with the windows streaming--and the horizon blotted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buried alive!
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to her to be incomparably worse than Cinder Town,
      and she felt a choking and a pity. Poor man! But was he to
      be pitied? Were not men different? That black hole of a
      kitchen, with the coal shed away across a weedy yard, and
      the well outside the back door, and the long gloomy dairy
      where she had seen his long white milking coat, hanging
      like a poor, pale thing that had committed suicide! He
      could live here and appear contented. And perhaps he would
      expect a woman to enter upon an interminable struggle with
      the cruel crudeness of the house, and think nothing of it?
      He held that a woman should work, and find her feminine
      salvation among the scrubbing brushes and the pots and
      pans.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fled out of the house, feeling guilty and pitiful; and
      to justify her coming and those twenty minutes of
      exploration and of disillusionment Mary Viner went down to
      Gore Wood. She could see the wild hyacinths as thin sheets
      of blue under the young foliage of the oaks, and she sat
      down on the stump of a felled tree and tried to co-ordinate
      her prejudices and her emotions. So, he could expect a
      woman to bring herself there, a modern girl? Of course,
      dozens of women must have lived their lives at Doomsday,
      and scrubbed those floors, and drawn water on icy mornings
      from the well, and blundered about in that great cavern of
      a kitchen by candlelight, but they had been other women,
      country women, common and strong, born and bred to it. But
      she, with her fastidious hands, and her sensitiveness, and
      her passion for movement? She who loathed poverty and its
      limitations? It was not fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She cried out that it was not fair because there was a part
      of her that wanted to open its arms and leap. She wanted
      Arnold Furze the man, but not Arnold Furze the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so strong. He could rough it. But she began to be
      afraid of his very strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He would not understand," she thought. "The man on the
      land, the woman in the house. Yes, yes--I know. A human
      partnership. And yet--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She picked a few bluebells, not because she wanted them,
      but to show that she had been there, for she might meet
      Mrs. Sarah in the lane. She disliked that woman, her cap,
      her nose, her sly and sidelong ways. O,--what a morning!
      And she thought of him and the wagon and the sale at
      Melhurst, and her heart hurt her. Why did he happen to be
      what he was, and why was she her fastidious self?
    </p>
    <p>
      By the Six Firs she pushed her bicycle against the hedge,
      and climbing the mound, sat down at the foot of one of the
      trees. She saw Cinder Town very new and flimsy, and behind
      her lay the old house like a thing rooted in the soil. Yes,
      that was permanence, the life of the husbandman, getting up
      at dawn and going to bed at dusk, looking at the same
      fields and trees, doing the same things year in and year
      out. No holidays, no movement, no sunlight on southern
      seas, one's excitements a new litter of pigs or a record
      mangel crop.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she felt that she simply could not stand it.

    <p>
      At Great Park Farm, Melhurst, country carts, cars, Fords,
      and a light lorry or two were parked in the paddock, while
      their owners went in search of bargains; and Furze, who had
      kept his greys under the shade of a big chestnut tree and
      in the charge of a friendly carter, wandered about
      catalogue in hand. Great Park spread itself in the arms of
      a pleasant and untidy old garden full of monkshood and
      lilac and guelder rose, and since the weather was fair much
      of the gear to be sold had been laid out in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze, pencil in hand, marked the lots upon the catalogue
      for which he wished to bid. Harnett the auctioneer had
      gathered in extraneous material, and it was a composite
      sale, and Great Park sheltered for the day much furniture
      that was strange to it. In the farm-house parlour, with its
      wallpaper of red roses and blue garlands, Furze found a
      massive old oak table with chamfered rails and square legs,
      black-brown with age, put together by some village
      carpenter a hundred and fifty years ago. On the table was
      laid out a pink lustre tea-service, six cups and saucers,
      teapot, sugar bowl and milk jug, and Furze, the lover, saw
      Mary's hands fluttering over the old china. He marked down
      the table, Lot 33, also the pink lustre tea-service, Lot
      67. Wandering about the house with a crowd of farmers'
      wives and Melhurst women, and bargain hunters and snatchers
      up of the antique and the curious, he found many pieces fit
      for "Doomsday." His pencil left marks against an oak
      bureau, a mahogany chest of drawers, three old Windsor
      chairs, a bedstead, an oak chest, a long mirror in a faded
      gilt frame, a length of green cord stair carpet, a kitchen
      table, a deal cupboard, a set of knives, a willow pattern
      dinner service, a Chesterfield sofa that would need
      recovering. He jotted down against each item the amount
      that he could afford to bid for it. Particularly did he
      covet the old oak table and the pink lustre tea-service.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dealer, old Symonds of Carslake, spoke to him in the
      kitchen. He knew Furze as an implacable bargain-hunter, a
      buyer of useful rubbish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything doing to-day, Mr. Furze?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Symonds was a decent old boy, and Arnold confided to
      him his passion for the pink lustre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you fellows will be after it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Symonds screwed up his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not enough of it to be worth a scrimmage. Dare say I could
      get it for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go to three pounds. My day's extravagance, Mr. Symonds."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harnett held the sale in the garden, standing on a kitchen
      table under the shade of a lime tree, with a smaller table
      to serve as a rostrum. He was a bald-headed, cynical man,
      with a set smile, and a tired, flat voice. His gagging was
      conventional and perfunctory. "Thirteen shillings I am bid.
      Thirteen shillings! Unlucky number, ladies and gents. Make
      it fourteen. Thank you, Mr. Brown. Fourteen shillings I am
      bid, good kitchen table. Fifteen shillings, Mr. Furze.
      Fifteen shillings--"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hot day, and the bidding was languid, and the
      crowd one such as Mr. Harnett was apt to describe as a "Lot
      of gaping stock-fish." Arnold was lucky. Mr. Symonds bought
      in the tea-service for one pound, fifteen shillings. Furze
      lost the oak bureau, but he won the table, the mahogany
      chest of drawers, the Windsor chairs, the bedstead, the oak
      chest, the long mirror, the stair carpet, the kitchen table
      and half a dozen other bargains.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the help of a gentleman from Melhurst who was there to
      earn some casual silver as a porter Furze loaded his
      possessions on to the wagon, covered them with a rick
      cloth, and started for "Doomsday." His lunch had been a
      slice of bread and a piece of cheese, and some cold tea out
      of a bottle, but it was one of those days for him when a
      man does not feel physical hunger. He was happy. He walked
      beside his two "greys" with a mind full of possessive
      symbolism. The rose lustre tea-service, carefully packed in
      a box, was the cynosure of the day's happenings. Already he
      was making plans for the disposal of the furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that from the bank above the road Mary Viner
      saw the blue wagon pass as she had seen it set off in the
      morning. But much had happened. The wagon was full, but her
      heart felt empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze saw her and pulled up for a moment, and his face was
      happy. Her conscience smote her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have done rather well."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled down at the lover in him, because she loved the
      lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must come and have tea, you and your people, when I am
      straight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We should love to."
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hat and went on, leaving her to wonder why the
      lover should not suffice, and why he should be lost in the
      husband. For that is what happened; she had read it and
      been told it. Marriage was a wholly different affair. "My
      dear, flirt with the bank-clerk if you like--but marry the
      banker." Clare's philosophy. Marriage should be
      comfortable; it needed cushions. Lovers might be content
      with a haycock or a bank of heather, and an ephemeral
      moonlight madness; marriage was a house to be lived in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to her "Green Shutters" and her old people,
      and the making of a gooseberry tart. Gooseberries were
      early that year.

      Will Blossom worked until seven o'clock that evening on his
      master's beer and great good humour, helping to unload the
      wagon and carry the furniture into the house. The bedstead,
      the chest of drawers, and a little old mahogany wash-hand
      stand had to be persuaded up the narrow stairs. The rest of
      the purchases were left in the living-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blossom heard about it when her man came home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell 'ee 'e 'as bought a bedstead."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sarah laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looks like business, hee, hee, hee, though most gal's
      first bed be a grass bank or a dry ditch bottom."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her man growled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Muster Furze be'unt that sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ben't he! She was round there to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who be she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That there Mary Viner. She looks ready for it, she do.
      Come to pick bluebells! Hee, hee, hee."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her man, irresponsibly stubborn, clumped through into the
      scullery to wash. He, too, had been caught at the haymaking
      season, and for his sins was the mate of the lady who
      annexed and wore his old caps. To Will Blossom marriage was
      symbolized by a tongue, and a jeering voice that never had
      anything good to say of anyone when the particular person
      was not there to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Furze was busy, happily busy, a pipe in his
      mouth, and all the windows open wide. And so were the
      windows of his soul. Having cleared the living-room by
      carrying the kitchen table and the cupboard and other
      necessities into the kitchen, and added to them his own
      home-made gear, he arranged the new life about the old oak
      table. The oak chest looked well under the east window. The
      three Windsor chairs he tried in various positions. The
      lounge sofa, the long mirror, a little old pie-crust table
      and two rugs went into Mrs. Damaris' parlour. Certainly,
      the sofa needed some attention, some flowery piece of
      cretonne draped over it temporarily, and a man who could
      mend harness ought to be able to tackle such a job.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last of all he unpacked the pink lustre and laid it out on
      the oak table, while Bobbo, puzzled by so many movements
      and mutations, sat with his head on one side and watched
      this new game. The evening light slanted through the west
      window, and the metallic and rosy glow of the old china
      seemed to float upon the dark sheen of the oak. Furze stood
      back with his hands in his pockets, and felt that the room
      was good.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      At "Doomsday" Arnold Furze had been preparing for a
      tea-party. Mrs. Sarah, chartered for an extra morning, had
      scrubbed the tiled floor of the living-room, and the brick
      floor of the kitchen, and poked her nose into all sorts of
      matters that did not concern her. Furze had locked up the
      pink lustre tea-service in a cupboard, and that locked
      cupboard had tantalized the lady through the whole of the
      morning. Now--what--had he got in there? The sugar and the
      tea no doubt, and his tobacco tin? Mrs. Sarah could not
      abide a suspicious temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the labour of love was the man's. With oil and beeswax
      and two old socks he polished the oak table and the chest,
      and having brought a length of flowery cretonne at Carslake
      he ingeniously fashioned a sort of apron for the lounge
      sofa. It was stitched at the back and tucked in round the
      cushioning, much to the interest of the dog who attempted
      to lie on it, but was removed gently yet with a firmness
      that he understood. Furze brought in flowers. An old red
      bread-pan he filled with foxgloves and stood it in a
      corner, and on the oak table were crimson stocks in a blue
      bowl. A cream-pan on the oak chest held a mass of red and
      white may, and the scent of it was a sweet and heavy
      fragrance in the room. Mrs. Damaris' parlour had a sheaf of
      yellow flags from Rushy Pool. As for the sunk garden, the
      Canterbury bells and the sweet williams and the stocks were
      in early blossom; the grass had been scythed and the beds
      weeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ritual of tea gave Furze some thoughtful moments. He
      decided to have the lustre service set out on the piecrust
      table, and the bread and butter and the cakes on the
      painted table. And he would make the tea himself, or with
      Mary to help him. Young Blossom was sent up to Carslake for
      cakes, and getting seven for sixpence purloined and ate the
      seventh and most sugary one on the way back. Then there was
      the thin bread and butter. Furze cut it himself after his
      dinner, with great care and concentrated solemnity, finding
      the loaf rather too new and the knife too blunt for the
      carving of slices of ideal thinness. The beastly things
      would buttonhole! Still--there it was, twelve slices well
      buttered, and laid like weather-boarding on one of the
      willow pattern dishes. He put it away in the dairy to keep
      moist.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mary Viner could have seen him! The big, deliberate,
      devoted thing with his large but sensitive hands arranging
      the flowers, and cutting that bread and butter! It is
      possible that his labours with loaf and knife and butter,
      breath held, eyes very serious, might have conquered her.
      It would have won him most women, the women who have
      touched the little, trivial, pathetic things of life. But
      Mary wished to have her bread and butter cut for her, and
      brought in by a spruce young woman with a bobbed head and a
      white-laced apron. She did not see it quite in that way.
      Her desire for happenings had outgrown her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past three Furze came in from hoeing weeds, and
      washed and put on his best suit. Afterwards, he strolled
      about the house, observant, excited, half in a dream,
      listening, giving some chair or piece of furniture a touch.
      He fetched the bread and butter from the dairy, saw that
      the kettle was on the boil, and kept looking at his watch.
      It was a hot day, abnormally hot for May. Should he wait in
      the house, or go up at the lane to meet them? He hesitated
      for a moment, on the path by the yew hedge, fancying that
      he could smell his bean field in bloom though it lay two
      hundred yards away beyond the Doom Paddock. Still, the
      wind--such as it was--came from the southeast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to wait in the house. That confounded cat might
      try to get its head into the milk-jug.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Viner sometimes wondered how her mother and father had
      managed to be born, for always they were late for any party
      or occasion. Like many people with nothing to do they did
      not appear to have sufficient leisure even for the
      accomplishment of nothing, nor had they any sense of time.
      Their unpunctuality was one of the afflictions of her
      youth. Mrs. Charlotte could not write a letter without a
      final flourish of "In haste." Old Hesketh had a habit of
      taking a bath just when his daughter was ready to serve up
      dinner, or he would have to be summoned from some pottering
      job in the garden by the tinkling of a handbell. Furze had
      asked them for half-past four, and at four-twenty Mary
      could hear them twittering away upstairs like a couple of
      sparrows busy building a nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      She called up the stairs:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is nearly half-past four."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the room opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall not be five minutes, dear. Your father found two
      buttons off his summer waistcoat."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was reclosed and Mary knew that nothing would
      hurry them. Yet--presently--they would come downstairs in a
      fluster, and looking very hot, having odd gloves or no
      gloves, or a broken shoe-lace. Or the hat-brush had been
      mislaid. Such agitation!
    </p>
    <p>
      She would sigh, but not resignedly. And to-day it was she
      who felt fussed and agitated, and was yea and nay in the
      same breath. The weather was abominably hot; she had had a
      good deal of cooking to do, and she had dressed in a hurry,
      putting on a new biscuit-coloured frock and a brown hat;
      and at the last moment a stocking had "laddered." Yes, she
      felt cross and agitated, and her heart seemed to be in a
      hurry, while her head was attempting to construct some
      compromise. What were they talking about upstairs? Absurd,
      futile, garrulous old people!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, her heart smote her. Poor old things, they were so
      very old, while she felt all the drive and impatience of
      her youth pushing against their little dawdling
      ineptitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the conversation upstairs concerned her, and was less
      selfish than her thoughts. Old Hesketh had accomplished a
      very indifferent knotting of his tie, and Mrs. Charlotte
      was retying it for him. In some ways he was still a great
      lanky, irresponsible, and rather lovable boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if it does happen, Nellie will come. She always said
      she would. And it would be a home for her. Do stand
      still--Hesketh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, my dear. These things have to be faced. One can't
      stand in the way--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's better. Of course--a farmer's life--not quite what
      one might wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good life. A very decent fellow; character; and kind--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And quite near. Besides, he does own the farm. Mary has
      been so restless lately. I was almost afraid that she might
      do something foolish--like marrying Colonel Sykes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Hesketh bristled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sykes! You don't mean to tell me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Preposterous! Why, the man is only ten years younger than
      I am. My dear, it is five-and-twenty minutes to five."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, dear, we shall be late. Where is my sunshade? I'm
      sure I put it out. Look in the cupboard."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary had to find the sunshade for her mother, and then the
      three of them set out as though they had had just five
      flustering minutes in which to dress and were chasing the
      wheels of a social whirl. Mrs. Charlotte tripped along very
      fast with her sunshade bobbing up and down, and Hesketh had
      the air of a man late for his own wedding. Like timid old
      birds they were flustered so easily. Youth drifted in the
      rear, impatient and absorbed, thinking its own thoughts,
      aloof and troubled. Brown eyes, staring vaguely at green
      hedgerows, saw nothing but an inward tangle of thorns. Her
      silence passed unnoticed like the flight of some brown bird
      from tree to tree. She was full of questions that would not
      let themselves be answered, of warning impulses and
      impatient wisdoms. What a pity it was that life could not
      have been arranged differently, that is to say--as she
      would have chosen to arrange it. If she could have put
      Arnold into a fat chair in a fat London office where men
      seemed to make money just by sitting still? As Clare's
      husband made it. And here was all this sentimental pother,
      with her heart wanting something, and her head refusing to
      let her want it, and the hedges white with may blossom, and
      her stocking "laddered," and a man over yonder threatening
      her like a deep sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hesketh, isn't it green?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She found her mother poised in the middle of the lane,
      surprised by a childish delight, while her father stood and
      smiled as some old men can smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A green valley, a wonderful green valley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And those larches. And the two American oaks, and that
      white weed on the pond. Every shade of green."
    </p>
    <p>
      The daughter felt irritated. Somehow it seemed to her
      absurd that her mother should have eyes for the greenness,
      and a childish delight in its beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be nearly five o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shepherded them on, though they showed an inclination
      to dawdle at the gate because Mrs. Charlotte had seen a
      swallow, and because two young pigs were thrusting friendly
      noses under the bottom of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tig-tig," said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absurd old lady! With Furze visible at the corner of the
      yew hedge, a man who had been kept waiting for half an
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother, there is Mr. Furze."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at Furze a little anxiously, and then denied him
      her eyes for quite three minutes, while he, with an air of
      unclouded pleasure, shook her mother's hand and then her
      father's, and said how hot it was, and how glad he was to
      see them. But the house was cool; it was not built
      yesterday; and would they like to look at the garden? No;
      he was sure that Mary's mother wanted her tea. He took her
      sunshade from her and closed it, and gave her his arm up
      the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not expect too much of a mere bachelor, Mrs.
      Viner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary's mother fell into a sudden delight with the first
      room, and her delight was quite genuine. "What a lovely
      room, so restful. The old tiles and the oak. And what is it
      that is smelling so sweet?" He told her--"May blossom." He
      looked very happy and a little shy, and his eyes kept
      touching Mary with quick, deep, tentative glances. What did
      she think of it? She stood there by the door, her brown
      eyes fixed upon nothing in particular, while her mother
      went on twittering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your flowers, Mr. Furze! Who arranged them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what a lovely old table. Look at it, Hesketh."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Viner passed a lean brown hand over the oak
      surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      "English oak; nothing so good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bobbo had sidled in to have his head patted by all save the
      queer young woman who looked as though she had lost herself
      somewhere outside the house. Furze was opening the door of
      Mrs. Damaris' parlour. "We will have tea in here. Yes, it
      was an ironmaster's house, and I suppose Rushy was a
      hammer-pond." His deep eyes were a little anxious, and
      Bobbo knew the look, and connected it with straying cattle
      or a sick sheep--but where was the sick sheep on this
      particular occasion? Furze stood aside and they passed in,
      and he looked at Mary as she passed him, as though asking
      for something.

    <p>
      Mrs. Viner sat down on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweet," she said, "perfectly sweet. And the garden! Why,
      you ought to have a peacock on that wall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps we shall," he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary's mother was pulling off her gloves, and looking at
      the pink lustre. Her bright eyes glimmered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--you have got pink lustre! I've always wanted pink
      lustre. Mary, dear, isn't it sweet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, very," said the daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Hesketh was held by the window and the view, that
      complete and wonderful greenness, with distant hills
      floating a bluish grey between the spring woods. He was
      lost to the party for the moment. Furze was explaining that
      he had the tea to make, and that the kettle was boiling in
      the kitchen, and his eyes hoped for a consenting
      playfulness in Mary's. Would she not want to help him, and
      to see the kitchen? She had seen it, but he did not know
      that. She sat down in one of the basket chairs, with a
      troubled forehead and self-conscious eyes, and then got up
      quickly and joined her father at the window. Furze went out
      alone to make the tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bobbo sidled out after him. He watched his master fill the
      pink lustre tea-pot, and they returned together to Mrs.
      Damaris' parlour. Mary had joined her mother on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who will pour out for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--Mary will," said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes besought her. She rose from the sofa, but without
      looking at him, and took one of the chairs by the
      tea-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We none of us take sugar. Do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was waiting to pass the cups, and thinking how well that
      biscuit-coloured frock and the little brown hat suited her.
      Her hands were moving over those pink cups, and they gave
      him a sense of tremulous agitation. But she was here, in
      his house, touching his possessions, the things that he had
      striven and waited for. She had picked up the milk jug; its
      handle had been riveted, and with the weight of the milk in
      it the riveting gave way. There was a crash as the jug
      struck the edge of the table and broke; milk ran across the
      table and fell in a little stream upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes trembled up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--I'm so sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. He wanted to tell her that she could break
      everything in the house. Her scared brown eyes and
      plaintive mouth made his love hold its breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--that's all right. Not your fault. I ought to have
      tried that handle. Besides--there is plenty more milk."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gathered the broken pieces, and suddenly
      inspired--called the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, Bobbo, tongue--old chap, nice new milk."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog came and lapped at the white pool, and Furze
      laughed, and so drew a little awkward laughter from the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forestalling the cat!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what pity! That sweet jug!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things with weak handles deserve to be broken, Mrs. Viner.
      I'll get some more milk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a cloth. We must wipe the table and the carpet."
    </p>
    <p>
      The providing of more milk in a plain white jug was an easy
      matter, but the finding of a respectable glass-cloth was
      more of a problem. These domestic etceteras were not to be
      picked up so easily at "Doomsday." Mrs. Sarah washed and
      dealt with such cloths as existed. And where the devil were
      the clean ones? He was away quite a long time, rummaging,
      and wondering whether he could use a clean handkerchief.
      Then he remembered the box of cloths in the dairy, for he
      was far more meticulous about the cleanliness of the dairy
      than of the kitchen, and he called himself a fool, and went
      and fetched a cloth. Mary took it from him. She looked very
      near to tears. She mopped up the spilt milk on the table,
      and would have gone down on her knees to complete Bobbo's
      operations upon the carpet, but Furze would not have it. He
      thought her remorse adorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no,--I'll do that, while you pour out. I hope the tea
      isn't stewed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't be too strong for me, my dear fellow," said
      Captain Hesketh kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, a little hot water," said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hot water!" Another problem. What the dickens was he to
      use for hot water? Had he another jug? But why not put a
      bold face upon it and bring in the kettle? He did so,
      throwing the milk-soaked cloth into the stone sink.
    </p>
    <p>
      So--at last--tea was served, and they ate his laboriously
      shaved bread and butter, and three of the cakes, and
      conversed brightly so that the death among the china should
      be forgotten. But Mary looked as though tragedy had
      overtaken her, with a dewy sadness of the brown eyes, and a
      poignant droop of the mouth. And Furze loved her for
      looking like that.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards they went out into Mrs. Damaris' garden, and
      where one of the old yews threw a band of shadow Furze
      placed two of his Windsor chairs. He would have carried out
      a third for Mary, but she--in a moment of wilful
      self-effacement--told him not to bother. She would sit on
      the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But in your new frock, my dear!" said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked peeved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--a cushion then, if Mr. Furze has an old one."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had broken his milk-jug, and now she was asking for
      cushions, and a cushion was a thing that he did not
      possess. But happily he remembered that the padded seat of
      one of the basket-chairs was removable, and he went in and
      fetched it for her and placed it on the grass. Captain
      Hesketh was lighting a pipe. Mrs. Charlotte, sitting under
      her sunshade, and feeling the moody silences of her
      daughter, made chirpings like a cheerful sparrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked about the farm, Mrs. Charlotte asking
      questions, and Furze answering them. Did he get up very
      early in the morning? Yes, at about five o'clock, for when
      you had twenty or thirty cows to milk, and the milk to be
      put on the train or delivered at various houses, you had to
      be early. And she assured him that his milk was excellent.
      And was it true that the cows had to be washed before
      milking? He assured her that it was true if you did your
      job properly. Your milk cans and dairy had to be cared for
      like an operating theatre and its fittings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is where a woman can help. There are times when a
      farmer's hour should contain seventy minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was leaning against the stone wall, filling his pipe,
      and trying to assure himself that Mary's silence was not
      the silence of boredom. He wished that it was the daughter
      who was asking these questions, instead of sitting there
      with her hands clasped over her knees, and her eyes looking
      at the horizon. Or was it that the breaking of that
      precious milk-jug had upset her? She seemed lost in a mood
      of aloofness; she had uttered no impulsive word of interest
      or of pleasure; and yet she was very much awake,
      distressfully self-conscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't shoot, sir, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Captain Hesketh did not shoot. He had never been able
      to afford "huntin' and shootin'," not even in India.
      Besides, he had to confess that he was not very fond of
      killing things, live things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the difference between the old boy and the young
      one, my dear fellow. At fourteen you will crawl round a
      field to get a pot at a sitting rabbit, and go all hot with
      joy when you bowl over your first running one. But--of
      course--a farmer has to shoot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do as little as possible. One has to keep the rabbits
      down, and it is kinder than snaring. Wood-pigeon too. But I
      don't like it, not a fine bird like a wood-pigeon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No pheasants--of course?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--other people's--occasionally. Self-defence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hesketh had something to say on indigo planting,
      and the rice fields and the difference between Eastern and
      Western smells, and Furze listened, and then spoke of
      English scents, hops and mustard, and hay, and a bean field
      in bloom. Yes, he knew of nothing more exquisite than the
      smell of the black and white flowers of the common bean. He
      confessed that it had the same effect on him as the
      cuckoo's note in the green of the year; it sent a thrill
      through him, and filled him with a sense of strange
      yearning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a field in flower. Why not stroll down there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hesketh and his wife exchanged glances. Some
      telepathic message seemed to pass. Old Viner looked at his
      watch; his wife explained that she was a poor walker in hot
      weather, and that the day was very hot. Besides, they ought
      to be getting home. But there was no reason why Mary should
      not go down to the bean field while two old people toddled
      back to Cinder Town. It was Mrs. Charlotte who suggested
      it. Young people were young people, and Mrs. Viner was
      vaguely annoyed with her daughter. Mary had made no effort,
      no effort at all, and could a man have been kinder?
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze, deep-eyed, watched the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew what the inner voice of him was crying. "O, my
      beloved, my beloved!" And something stirred in her, an
      inarticulate, physical agitation. Her heart hurried. Her
      brown eyes were like shimmering windows hiding all that was
      within from those who stood without. She pulled at a piece
      of grass, and with a kind of sweet sullenness, looked up
      slantwise and as high as the man's collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Viner stood up. He was a little flushed, the old
      child full of young and vicarious emotion.

    </p>
    <p>
      Bean Acres lay between Rushy Bottom and Maids Croft,
      surrounded by old thorn hedges that were like lines of
      foam, and when the two were half way across the Doom
      Paddock the scent of the bean flower met them. Furze,
      walking beside and slightly behind her, kept watch upon her
      face, that sulkily sweet profile overshadowed by her dark
      hair. She had gone forth with him without a word, as though
      under some compulsion, looking at everything and nothing
      with a silent and self-conscious vagueness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came to the gate, and Bean Acres lay spread before
      them, six acres of grey green foliage glistening in the
      sunlight, six acres of fragrant black and white flowers. A
      wayward wind, coming and going, stirred the bean tops, and
      seemed to blow the heavy and exquisite perfume into their
      faces. Furze breathed it in deeply. It was the very scent
      of her and her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven might smell like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands were resting on the rail of the gate, and on
      either side of the gate the shaggy old thorn hedges added
      their scent to the fragrance of the field. It was
      overwhelming. Her brown eyes had a blurred sheen. The
      flicker of the sunlight and the grey green leaves seemed to
      intensify her mental and emotional inter-confusion. She
      stood there rigid, like a wild thing conscious of its
      peril, yet unable to take to flight. He was so very near,
      and they were so utterly alone. She had felt his voice like
      a strong hand gently touching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mustn't--I mustn't," she kept saying to herself; "it
      would be so hopeless, so wrong. I ought not to have come
      out here."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was leaning beside her over the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clean land, Mary. It nearly killed me--getting it clean.
      I'm glad it didn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to shake. The smell of that field seemed to be
      intoxicating her. And all this greenness, and the whisper
      of growing things, the insidious sweet stealth, the call of
      the sap to her blood!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you must have worked. I can understand that--because
      I work--and because I am lazy--really--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was talking as though to keep fate off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to lie down in that field and do
      nothing--for ever and ever. So you see--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stole a panic look at him, and found him regarding her
      with such quiet and slightly smiling adoration that she
      lost herself and seemed to clutch at any floating words
      that came.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm--I'm so sorry about that jug."
    </p>
    <p>
      So--that was what had been worrying her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bought it for you to break."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sweetness of her terror she was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can take the service piece by piece and break it--if
      you wish. You could take me--the man--and break me--my
      darling--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She uttered a cry. It had happened. She was trying to hide
      her face, and his arms were round her. He was saying things
      to her, sacred and infinitely tender things, and though his
      arms held her they were very gentle. "O, my beloved." Her
      confusion was like a beating of wings. His man's tenderness
      seemed to overwhelm her like the smell of that flowery
      field; she put her hands on his shoulders, and laid her
      cheek against the roughness of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--my dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed her eyes. His arms seemed to grow more strong.
      She felt his warm breath, and then--kisses on her eyes and
      mouth. She was returning his kisses. Her mouth was
      plaintive and passionate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's wrong, it's madness," cried a voice in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her surrender was like a falling into a sweet and deep
      sleep. She felt herself lifted up and carried in his arms
      to a bank under the shade of the old thorns.

      In the dusk he went with her along the lane as far as the
      Six Firs. And here she withdrew herself, separating her
      young body from him as though some mystical web threatened
      to join them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't come any farther, Arnold."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood looking down at her dark comeliness made more
      swarthy and southern by the dusk. The smooth, white
      sleekness of her was flushed like an autumn leaf. Her eyes
      were both coy and wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you wish, my darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      She fled from him suddenly with one quick backward glance,
      a sidelong gleam of the brown eyes, leaving him standing
      there in the green twilight, serene as one of the tall
      trees, his head in the world of wonder. It had happened.
      And his thoughts had the scent of the bean flower and the
      perfume of a girl's hair. Wonderful! Yes, how wonderful it
      all was. Mary Viner, his Mary Viner, quick of breath and
      quick of colour, his Beloved of the poignant mouth. Thank
      God for it. His love was a love that stood with head
      uncovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered back down to the lane to the house, and there
      he heard poor Bobbo whining, Bobbo who had been shut up
      away from the blessedness of that May evening. He let the
      dog out, and bent down and held the beast's head between
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bobbo, she loves me. Wonderful, isn't it? Why should she?
      But she does."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dusk he went all over the house with the dog at his
      heels. He was full of a sacred and tender exultation.
      "Doomsday" had a new meaning; it was her house; she would
      sleep in that bed; her feet would go to and fro across the
      old, undulating floors. She would look out of this window
      and that at the woods and fields. He could see himself
      coming in from his labour and calling her. "Mary--Mary."
      And there would be the sound of her footsteps like the
      beating of wings, and she would come to him quickly with
      those coyly glancing eyes and a hurrying of her blood and
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more loneliness, no more long evenings alone by the
      winter fire. She would be with him.

    </p>
    <p>
      Mary returned to "Green Shutters" with a white lie on her
      red and burning lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm late. We went all over the farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      How far the lie carried she did not know, but she felt that
      she had come breathlessly out of a struggle, that she had
      been overpowered. O, the smell of that bean field, and the
      May blossom, and the green shadows under the hedge, and the
      tall grasses with the sunlight flickering through them! And
      to be held like that, sweetly and tenderly, crushed and
      conquered! The strength of him, the gentle, compelling
      strength of him!
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat on the edge of her bed and shivered. For behind the
      glowing gold of the evening she saw that old house like a
      cavern ready to swallow her and her insurgent restlessness,
      and though she had lost her heart, she had not given her
      head. He was so strong, so devoutly serious, and she knew
      that she was afraid of his strength. His love, man's love,
      was calling her to come and be his sweet slave, and
      so--perhaps--she could have been, but not on a lonely farm
      and in that house. It was extraordinary how she feared that
      house, as a child fears some darkly mysterious corner. No,
      she must keep her head and not let herself be overpowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze wanted to see her people that very night, and she had
      put him off. "No, not to-night, Arnold."
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he had spoken of marriage she had looked playfully
      confused and self-conscious. "What a hurry you are in! I
      like to dawdle over my cake!" But he was not the sort of
      man to be put off for long, and the more she put him off
      the more devotedly would he urge marriage upon her. She lay
      prone and clasped her pillow. He had breathed the fatal
      fire into her, and she was burning, for she was a dark girl
      and warm blooded. She wanted him just as he wanted her, yet
      differently. And yet--was their wanting of each other
      different? Would he sacrifice his farm if she asked him to
      do it? He was asking her to sacrifice herself, but then--of
      course, it did not appear to him like that, for he did not
      understand or even suspect her point of view. And could she
      tell him? It would be honest to say--"Arnold, I can't live
      such a life; I'm not made for it. It would mean unhappiness
      for us both." She felt that it would not convince him, that
      his dominant tenderness would try to get her into his arms
      and overwhelm her with sweet reassurings. "What is my girl
      afraid of? It will be all right. It--must--be all right.
      What is it that frightens you?" And if she were honest she
      would have to tell him that she loathed housework, and
      poverty, and loneliness--and that she wanted--Well--what
      exactly did she want? Movement, variety, comfort, a good
      time, her little triumphs and adventures? She would have to
      say--"I am not up to my job, the woman's job, if you mean
      by that--a life of cooking and mending and dishwashing. I
      can't help it. I am made that way. Lots of women are."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she supposed that he would despise her, because he
      loved work, and was rooted in the soil, and did not seem to
      need the modern excitements, but with a quite amazing
      contentedness followed the plough. Where was his war
      restlessness? How had he been able to bear burial alive in
      this Sussex valley? He was utterly different from herself,
      and she saw disaster in an attempt to mate with such a
      difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      What should she do?
    </p>
    <p>
      She wanted him--the lover, and the arms of the lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell him she could not leave her people--at least--not yet?
      Yes, that was an idea. Meanwhile she would be fondled and
      kissed--and the woman's yearn in her assuaged. Yes, to a
      point. But how far?
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat up and shook her hair out of her eyes. Embraces,
      clingings, kisses! Should she risk them, and dissemble, and
      hope for some compromise? If she could persuade him to give
      up "Doomsday" and take some nice farm nearer London, and on
      the edge of the world's happenings? She felt sure that such
      places existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she left the problem waiting, and slept in snatches, and
      woke with a feeling of being embraced; and snuggled into
      the sensuous warmth of the feeling. At breakfast, realizing
      that there was wisdom in regularizing the affair, she let
      it be known that Arnold Furze had asked her to marry him.
      Consented? Well, not exactly. She wanted to know more of
      him, and also she did not see her way yet to leaving "Green
      Shutters" to the mercy of casual servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but we have thought of that," said her mother
      archly--and much excited; "it was always agreed that your
      Cousin Nellie would come to us. It will be a home for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was rather unexpected. Mary had not properly
      reconnoitred all her defences.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't wish it talked about yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear, the things that are not talked about are
      just the very things that are talked about."
    </p>
    <p>
      She countered that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arnold is coming this evening to see you both. But I wish
      it to be understood that I want more time."
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed a most difficult day, and in the evening, at the
      end of the day's work, Arnold Furze came down from
      "Doomsday." She met him at the door, and in the little
      passage he bent and kissed her hand like an old-world
      lover. She left him along with her father and went out into
      the garden, and at the end of five minutes they joined her
      there. The discussion had been a very brief one. They
      appeared to have come to a very rapid understanding,
      possibly because of Furze's archaic attitude towards her
      parents. Had parents to be consulted in these modern days,
      and when a girl was six and twenty?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid that I can give your daughter only a working
      home, sir. But it is a good life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow, Mary knows what work is."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did, but not as her father understood it, nor as Furze
      understood it, and when they were left alone together in
      the garden she had to warn the lover in him. For she knew
      that Harold Coode was sticking a row of peas on the other
      side of the fence, and that Mr. Jamieson was smoking an
      after-dinner pipe in the little red and white hammock-tent
      on the back lawn. That was the worst of these cramped,
      cheek by jowl lives; you had to be so careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever seen the sunset from Six Firs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she had not. But as she had certain things to say to
      him she accepted the sunset, and the public parade past the
      windows of Cinder Town. No, she would not need a hat. At
      the gate she was aware of his pausing, and looking at poor
      Coode's iron hut, that most lamentable of improvisations,
      but there was no scorn on his face, for he had no scorn in
      his nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather pathetic--that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She allowed herself a moment's moodiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't we all rather pathetic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not mean--you. But a one-eyed life like that--Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is not 'Doomsday'--oak."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot help loving that place. English clay and oak--if
      you like. You will learn to love it, too. A little world of
      one's own--English, where you can say what you please--just
      as loudly--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face silenced him. She had seen the Twist's blue car
      turn into the cinder road, with Winnifred at the wheel and
      late home from a tennis party. And she was walking with
      Winnie's "milkman." O, what a monstrous snob she was! And
      cowardly. She felt a sudden scorn of herself, and was able
      to give her friend a radiant look, and a smile that
      introduced Captain Arnold Furze of "Doomsday." She was
      kinder to him after that, because she felt in wistful need
      of his kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't hurry me--will you, Arnold?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting at the foot of one of the trees, and he was
      standing and leaning against the trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean--it is such a serious business, getting married."
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood a part of her better than she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The five minutes before zero hour, dear one. Serious for a
      woman; her 'going over the top.' But we shall go over
      together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have my people to think of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Above them the red-throated firs pressed the sunlight in
      their green arms, and he--standing there with an air of
      supreme contentment and a tenderness that was tranquil as
      the sunset, spoke deep and simple words. She was touched by
      them, so touched that she felt like clasping his knees and
      pouring out all her doubts and distresses. How big and
      strong he was; but somehow she could not surrender to his
      strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm at your service, my beloved. When one is very
      happy--one does not want to hurry. Besides, there is more
      to do yet before you come to me. I have had so much to do
      on the land that I have had neither time nor the money to
      do justice to the house. It shall be the house now--because
      it will be my beloved's house."
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt a choking in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a good man, Arnold."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      So, finding it sweet to be loved as this man loved her, she
      temporized. It was not fair to him, and she knew it, but at
      the back of her mind was the hope that something might
      happen, such as her being able to move him by imperceptible
      degrees towards a life that would be less lonely. As yet
      she had no philosophy of life, and neither knew what was
      worth getting, nor how to get it. She was ignorant of those
      dear and durable loyalties, or a calmness of mind that is
      independent of the crowd. To hundreds of sensitive women
      that old Sussex homestead would have put forth many
      appeals. They would have understood its sureness, its
      permanence, its happy and green isolation, secure from the
      yelling voices of little common children and the cheap and
      gaping crowd. It had beauty, and permanence, but much of
      modernity asks for neither. Almost it would seem that the
      new spirit asks for permanence, and regards marriage or any
      such human relationship as a citizen of God's Own Country
      regards his motor-car, good for a year. That, in a way was
      Mary's feeling, and it was a very natural feeling, though
      she was unconscious of the rather pathetic vulgarity of her
      so-called ideals. She was both attracted and repelled by
      sex. She was experiencing all the curiosity of youth in the
      presence of a new and old sensation. To be kissed and held
      close, and to be looked at as though the lower part of her
      was human, and all above her breasts divine! It made her
      feel smooth as silk, and warm in her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well--well! She sighed, and kissed back, and temporized,
      and supposed that men might be persuaded out of the deeps
      of their devotion to uproot themselves and take root
      elsewhere. Surely, land was land, and a farm a farm. She
      even went so far as to write to Clare, in strict confidence
      of course, to ask her whether people did not farm near
      Weyfleet. Yes, twenty or thirty miles from town, where you
      had shops, and a tennis club and dances, and cheap
      Wednesday tickets to town, and where those expeditions--so
      dear to women--were possible. Clare wrote back to say
      that--of course--people farmed in Surrey. Weyfleet was
      "country," not a suburb. Mary must most certainly not bury
      herself in Sussex. The servant problem would be too awful;
      it was sufficiently awful at Weyfleet. Leslie, Clare's
      husband, knew one of the local estate agents very well--and
      should they make tactful inquiries?
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter put Mary in a panic. She wrote in a hurry to say
      that she had nothing definite in mind, for she did not wish
      to feel the close grip of finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      And servants!
    </p>
    <p>
      For suddenly she had come to realize that they would not be
      able to afford a servant, at least--not yet. That
      woman--Mrs. Sarah or something--with the blue nose and the
      cap, would come in three times a week and help. He expected
      her--his wife--to work in the house as he worked on the
      farm. Certainly he had put it to her gently, and as though
      he was just a little sensitive about it, but he did not
      appear to think that there was anything inhuman in her
      working like a servant. "You and I together, Mary." A
      labour of love--what? Cooking her beloved's puddings, and
      making his bed, and sweeping his carpets--when there were
      carpets. O, very natural--of course, but she was not asking
      how to give him the part of domestic drudge. She had had
      enough of that. She was not so strong as he was, and she
      was different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ye gods, how different! The difference between them, glozed
      over and concealed beneath a shimmering mist of
      amorousness, began to frighten her more and more. Even when
      his kisses were on her mouth she would shudder a little at
      the finality of these embraces. Yes, she began to know now
      what they meant, and that the ultimate end of them would be
      children. Children in that great house, and without a
      servant!
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he mad? Or didn't he realize? Or was it just the blind
      way things happened? She began to feel like a fly in a web,
      with the strands trembling under the rush of fate--the
      spider.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked to her about the farm and the farm's economy, and
      she realized with a new fear that he could bore her.
      Perhaps--too--she was a little jealous of his beloved farm.
      But it did not interest her to be shown his "milk book,"
      with the records of the milk each cow gave, nor could she
      thrill over the yearlings and porkers, or the weight of a
      crop or the prospects of the hay fields. He talked of
      cutting and selling more timbers in order to furnish the
      house completely, and he took her down to Gore Wood, and
      she sat on a stump while he measured some of the oaks and
      worked out a rough estimate of the cubic capacity of the
      trunks. She said--"Yes, yes-is that so"--when he explained
      the system of measurement to her, and how you had to allow
      a twelfth for the bark. He seemed to take it for granted
      that she would be interested in all that interested him.
      But why should she be? She was interested only when he was
      interested in her, and came and sat on the tree stump
      beside her and kissed her. His kisses made her feel that as
      a woman she mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, she was coming to understand all that life on a
      farm implied, and how desperately hard Furze worked. Dawn
      till dusk--with no holidays, and very rarely a half-day
      off. With cows to be milked and beasts to be fed a man
      cannot indulge--like the industrialists--in temperamental
      peevishnesses. Grind, grind, grind, as a part of the growth
      and the greenness! And he seemed to love it so well that he
      was eager for her to share it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The issue grew yet more final when he took her over the
      house, and with an air of tender seriousness asked her to
      suggest any improvements and alterations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your department, you know, and a woman has ideas. Anything
      to save labour."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood beside him in the centre of the dark kitchen. His
      arm was round her. She felt both stubborn and
      compassionate, and her warning thoughts and emotions
      rendered her voiceless. But something had to be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a very nice kitchen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything that you think ought to be altered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That range must be very extravagant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose it is. We might scrap it, and put in a small
      one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the sink. It ought to be glazed, and stand higher, and
      have draining boards."
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered whether he would be offended, but she found
      him intelligently interested. He made her stand at the sink
      and go through the shadow process of washing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--that's obvious. With a higher sink you don't have to
      stoop. And that plate rack looks obsolete."
    </p>
    <p>
      With the handle of a broom he measured the height of an
      ideal sink as it would suit her, and nicked a mark on the
      handle with his knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most important--all this--Mary. I know what it means to
      have to work with bad tools. Anything else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one most obvious defect, and the worst of them
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No water laid on, Arnold; not even a pump. Every drop has
      to be carried in."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked very serious over this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove,--yes,--what an ass! I have managed somehow, but I
      always meant to have it altered. It will have to be
      altered. I'll have a pump fitted in the well, and the water
      piped to a tank in the roof, and piped down here. Of
      course, what I mean to do some time is to have a water-ram
      fitted in the brook, and so get an automatic supply, but it
      would mean at least two hundred yards of piping."
    </p>
    <p>
      His enthusiasm troubled her. Here she was inspiring him to
      all sorts of schemes that were to improve the internal
      economy of the house for the benefit of the woman, and she
      had no intention of becoming the woman in charge. No, not
      even if he had hot and cold water laid on in every room,
      and an electric plant put in, and electric radiators, and
      every swindling gadget advertised in the household papers.
      With all the so-called labour-saving devices the woman
      would still remain a slave. And she had a temperament.
      Domestic work should be left to stolid women without
      temperaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had got hold of a notebook and a pencil, and was making
      notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go up to Crofts at Carslake and get them to give me
      an estimate for these things. Now, what about coal?
      Supposing we had that corner bricked in and covered, and a
      shoot made in the wall, so that we could tip the stuff in,
      and it would be ready to hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      She agreed that it would save labour, and watched his busy
      pencil and his intent face, and tried to find the courage
      to throw herself upon his mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't live here, Arnold; I can't. It is too lonely and
      too big and too overwhelming. Can't we live somewhere
      else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But her realization of his fixity stifled her. He loved the
      place; it was his bread and butter and hers; and if no
      regular servant could be afforded here, well, there would
      be no servant elsewhere. And all this happy scheming was
      part of his love. She continued to be a coward, and to
      temporize.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--those trees will have to go this winter," he said
      quite cheerfully. "Hot water in the house is better than
      oak in a wood. Yes, we will have a good range and a
      hot-water boiler put in while we are about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his arm round her and kissed her, and swept her up
      the stairs to look at the bedrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you would like this one, my darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door of the room overlooking the south
      garden, and in it he had installed the bed, and the
      mahogany chest of drawers, and the little wash-hand stand
      and the long mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More needed. It gets all the sun. And what about curtains?
      If we bought the stuff, do you think you could make them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid a hand along a pensive cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--I think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we shall have to go shopping. What about a day in
      London,--when I am through with the hay? I dare say we
      could pick up a few good second-hand pieces."
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to withdraw him from too much tragic spending.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--you need not furnish the whole house, Arnold. The
      parlour and the living-room, and one bedroom. It would not
      be necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to think this very sweet and sensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear God," he said; "thank heaven for a woman who knows
      her own mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her, and she felt like weeping.
    </p>

      They were cutting the grass in the Long Meadow. The whir
      and clatter of the reaper had begun very early, and from
      the iron seat Furze guided the "greys." The swathes had
      fallen with the dew upon them, and a potent sun was turning
      them from green to grey, and already the fragrant smell of
      the dried grasses was floating on the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cutting had begun yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "T'dew be off t'grass, ssir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Will had been scything the dead corners under the hedges.
      The back of his neck was the colour of a hedging-glove, and
      all wrinkles. There were no women in the field, and no
      casuals from Carslake lazily shaking twists of grass on
      sleepy pitchforks. Furze had learnt better than that.
      Colonel Porter at Carslake Great Farm had a new
      swathe-turner, and had allowed Furze to hire it, and now
      that the dew was off the grass and the sun strong, the
      swathe-turner was put to work. The field grew more
      fragrant. Furze, with his shirt open at the throat, rode to
      and fro, the sunlight cutting a sharp shadow from the brim
      of his hat. His eyes had a dreaminess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, life was good! The crop was a heavy one, and he was
      getting it under ideal conditions. And up at the farm
      Messrs. Crofts--ironmongers and sanitary engineers--were
      fitting a new and efficient little range in the kitchen,
      and installing a force-pump in the well, and a tank in one
      of the attics. A super-sink with teak draining-boards lay
      outside the back door. Mary, the housewife, was to be
      lovingly humoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze ate his lunch beside Will under the thorn hedge, Mrs.
      Sarah had brought down her man's dinner, and looked evilly
      at the swathe-turner. Nasty machine doing honest people out
      of a nice day's work--plus beer! And would she be wanted in
      the evening?
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said her man, "you won't be,"--and was grateful to
      the swathe-turner.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had eaten his bread and cheese and drunk two
      glasses of beer, Furze lit a pipe and strolled up to the
      house to see how Crofts' men were progressing. They had
      bricked in the new range, and were proposing to tackle the
      sink when they had finished their midday pipes. Furze found
      the three of them sitting on his kitchen table. And in
      spite of it he smiled at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't get that up by to-night--I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe we shall," said an old fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      They belonged to no trade union. Nor did Furze, for the
      soil, and beasts, and growing things are above trade boards
      and time-tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back to Will and his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had a good drink, Will?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have that, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are in luck to-day. We shall get three turnings before
      we use the slide rake. It's mellowing fast."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the heat of the day passed, and the horizontal sun shot
      arrows of gold over the tops of the hedgerows and into the
      western windows of the woods. The dew would be coming down
      on the shorn grass. Will had gone home, and Furze was
      idling in the lane, waiting for his beloved. She tarried;
      she had made excuses to herself, little flimsy excuses; she
      considered the good opinion of Cinder Town; she went down
      to Perrivales and tried to persuade Phyllis to join her,
      but no Phyllis was available. So, she went alone, a little
      fearfully, with a guilty eagerness and a prudish
      circumspection that quarrelled with each other. She found
      her lover by the Six Firs with a face that had the glow of
      the hayfield upon it. He seemed to smell of hay and of his
      labour and of the clean linen he had put on before coming
      out to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things to show you," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His possessive arm encircled her, and they went down
      between the green hedgerows to the farm, and her fear of
      his sureness contended with the warm lure of the June
      evening. A tired languor descended upon her. To walk two
      ways at once in the world of the emotions is exhausting,
      and as she felt the firm muscles of his arm she herself
      grew less firm. He smelt warm and sweet to her like some
      clean, well-groomed animal. He looked at her silently and
      with a smile of deep meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things to show."
    </p>
    <p>
      The labours of Messrs. Crofts' men in the kitchen had left
      behind them a smell of mortar and brick, dust and stale
      tobacco, but the new grate had a polished and genial face,
      and the glazed sink was waiting for her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's that for height, Mary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had to try it, drooping pale hands over the edge of it
      while he stood and looked and loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't have to stoop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was glad when he spoke of going down to the Long
      Meadow. They shut Bobbo into the living-room to remain the
      dog in charge, and went down through the farmyard into the
      Doom Paddock. At the gate by the wagon-shed he took her
      full in his arms and kissed her, and she felt the thrill of
      her breasts. "My darling." A bat circled overhead, very
      black and noiseless. The shaggy old hedges were webbed with
      gold. A cart track led to the lower field gate, and they
      walked between the tracks of the wheels, their bodies flank
      to flank. She looked up and she looked down, but he looked
      only at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happy, sweetheart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, but would not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So am I. Not a little. Isn't it good to think that we own
      all this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she nodded, and under the big chestnut by the lower
      gate he held her and kissed her with more abandonment. She
      half closed her eyes, feeling herself floating in a soft
      green twilight under the dome of the tree. Cows had been
      sheltering here during the heat of the day. They went on
      through the gate into the Long Meadow, and her knees felt
      weak under her, and she let herself hang more heavily in
      the hollow of his arm. She smelt the hay, and something
      yearned in her and was afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tired, Mary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll find a seat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Their feet brushed across the fragrant swathes, and over
      the pale stubble. The dusk seemed to come suddenly, and so
      still was it in that solitary green valley that the Rushy
      stream could be heard though it slid through the green like
      brown silk. The swathes were turning from grey to black,
      though the trees on the opposite slope remained green
      towards the glow in the north-west. They went towards Gore
      Wood and the oaks, and here--in the narrow angle between
      the wood and the stream--Will had been scything. He had
      raked the scythe swathes into a cock under the overhang of
      an oak tree. The grass was fragrant and dry, for the oak
      leaves above caught the dew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best crop I have had, Mary. Someone has brought me
      luck."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on the hay-cock, and held her hands. She felt
      the draw of them as she stood, and was both thrilled and
      dismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My darling--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She melted, went limp of a sudden. He had her on his knees
      and in his arms. He was kissing her mouth and eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My little wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid her gently on the hay, and lay beside her and a
      little above her, looking down into her face. The hay was
      soft, and smelt sweet. The sun seemed to linger in it, and
      her languor was like the dusk, sinking into secret and
      shadowy completeness. He was bending over her, looking into
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary--"
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, on that soft June bed, pressed into the
      tumbled fragrance of it, she forgot to feel afraid.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When she left him at the Six Firs, Mary fled down the
      Melhurst road in a panic. She felt sure that her hair was
      full of hay, though she had shaken it, and--dissembling her
      terror--had made her lover comb it with his fingers. Yes,
      how she had dissembled! And her dissembling had saved her,
      so she thought, when she had realized that she was ready to
      go over the edge of things with him if he so willed it.
      Yes, they had both been very near the edge of things. But
      suddenly she had struggled up, and had begun to laugh a
      little hysterically, and to tease him and throw the dry
      grass in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--Arnold--what a couple of children--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had recovered herself and her breath; and her heart had
      begun to beat fast for a different reason. Heavens, how
      near she had been to disaster, the disaster of giving
      herself to him irretrievably! She had been seized with
      terror. "Oh, I must go home now. They will be wondering."
      And all the way to the Melhurst road she had trembled at
      the dark places and the shadowy retreats under the hedges,
      and at the possible descent upon her of a second crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when he had kissed her good-night, she ran down the
      road on the slim legs of a scared and flying virgin.
      Heavens, what an escape! From herself as well as from him.
      The sex storm had both frightened her and given her a sort
      of decisive courage that culminated in her running away.
      She felt that she must run and never stop, or that old
      horror of a house would swallow her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having begun her running she kept it up. The physical act
      spilled over into mental movement. She sidled along the
      Cinder Town fences like any little wench returning after a
      breathless adventure, and nearly collided with poor Coode
      who was leaning over his front gate and hanging his
      melancholy on the pegs of the stars. She let out a startled
      "O!" and scuttled past, though she knew that he had
      recognized her, and had watched her go out, and had watched
      for her return. Silly fool! She banged the gate of "Green
      Shutters," but it was her only act of positive defiance,
      and Coode was a poor provocation. Yet her thoughts were
      taking shape as she slipped in at the back door and up the
      stairs to her room. On all sorts of occasions a woman
      consults her mirror. No broken glass, thank God! She went,
      downstairs with apparent calmness, and found the old people
      sitting up and making a state affair of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very late, Mary," said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I? I had no watch. And these long evenings--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Viner looked self-consciously at the toe of a slipper.
      Yes, these summer evenings, with the hay lying out, and the
      stars blinking, and your little girl grown big enough for
      the arms of a man! Life had all sorts of sadnesses.
      But--then--the man was a good fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary had possessed herself of the daily paper and, curled
      herself up in a chair behind it. She read about the French
      in Morocco, and those unclean people the Communists getting
      something of what they deserved in Bulgaria; and a girl of
      ten clubbed to death in a wood by a young boy. Nice,
      progressive, wholesome world it was. But for all the
      interest it had for her the printed sheet might have been
      upside down. It was a screen, and behind it her panic
      thoughts were changing their garments, and putting on a
      sudden and definite costume, the disguise for escape. It
      was not that she had lost her head. She felt it more firmly
      on her shoulders, though it might be full of an
      over-excited wilfulness, and a hurry to be elsewhere. The
      plan came to her quite suddenly while she was glancing at
      the advertisement columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her people were going to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night, Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood the implied suggestion that she too should
      go to bed. Well, she would go to bed when she pleased, and
      get up when she pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night. I am going to read a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      But she rose and gave her father a little, impulsive kiss,
      and he patted her shoulder, having felt the vague
      compunction of that kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't forget the lamp, dear," said her mother, who was
      full of superfluous promptings.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had gone she showed no hesitation. The whole plan
      had crystallized out and deposited itself upon the thread
      of panic running through her mood. Yet the reaction was
      vital. She chose, though she chose with a furious and
      trembling haste, and a curious mingling of callousness and
      compassion. She put the paper away, and sat down at the
      writing-table in the window, and wrote her letter. It
      covered three sheets. It was a little hysterical; it
      accused herself and Furze and everybody; it spluttered
      explanations; it justified her running away by insisting on
      her not being able to help it. She said that she was
      writing to Arnold Furze, but that she did not wish him to
      know where she was or what had become of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all was quiet, she lit a candle, put out the lamp, and
      took the letter upstairs with her. From under her bed she
      routed out an old green suit-case, and set about filling
      it--largely by a process of exclusion. She would wear her
      new frock, and pack the second-best one. For the rest she
      had nothing very new, and her fugitive body would be able
      to carry most of the newness. She was quite deliberate, and
      rather pleasantly self-conscious. She was enjoying a little
      piece of sensationalism. The prospect of a possible return
      did not trouble her, for in certain emotional crisis a
      coming back may be the last thing a woman thinks of.
    </p>
    <p>
      She undressed, set her alarum clock for five, and got into
      bed. Of course she did not expect to sleep, but sleep she
      did, to be roused by the clock on the chair beside her bed.
      The morning's adventure rushed into her brain with instant
      clearness, and possessed it. The great necessity remained,
      flight from her own enslaving emotions. She felt very clear
      headed, and not a little excited. She had a pound note,
      three shillings, and fivepence in pennies. She dressed. She
      completed her packing. She did not forget her umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was left outside the door of her people's
      bedroom. No one saw her flight from Cinder Town, or met her
      walking to Carslake station. She took a field path in spite
      of the stiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train she caught was the 6.15, and at an hour when
      Cinder Town was eating its breakfast she was carrying her
      suit-case across Hungerford Bridge to Waterloo. By
      half-past ten she was at Weyfleet.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold Furze was up at half-past four. He came down in his
      shirt and breeches to light the stove for an early cup of
      tea, and he saw the sunrise through the kitchen window, a
      great yellow circle hanging between the gnarled black
      trunks of two old apple trees. Another fine day. He stood
      and looked at the new sink over which Mary's hands had
      drooped, and the lover in him had a seriousness that did
      not remember to smile over the fact that a glazed sink
      could be a vessel of romance. Soon, water would gush into
      it from new brass taps, hot water and cold water. There was
      the new grate too to be christened. She should come and try
      it; there should be a Viner party, and a baking of cakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went to the garden door and opened it, everything
      was wet with dew. White mist lay in the valley, and he
      could smell the hay, and the smell of it was tangled up in
      the darkness of a girl's hair. But that mist meant fine
      weather, and a blazing surf, and the swathes crisped by it
      and ready for getting in. It would be a busy day, but in
      the cool of the evening his beloved would steal down to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had shaved himself, and drunk his tea, and before
      beginning the day's work, Furze walked down to the Long
      Meadow. Blackbirds, thrushes, and starlings feeding there
      were disturbed by him. A thin, vapoury mist hung over the
      oaks of Gore Wood, and the swathes were sleeping under grey
      coverlets of dew. He turned one with his foot, and saw that
      it was dry below, and that after a day's sunning the crop
      should be ready for carting. Bobbo, following at his heels,
      saw his master go to the end of the meadow where a hay-cock
      stood under the overhanging boughs of an oak. Someone had
      reclined there. Furze picked up a handful of the dry grass
      and held it to his nostrils, uttering a man's inward
      prayer. "Wife, little wife, that is to be, sacred housewife
      and mother of children, may this good hay harvest be an
      omen." And then he took a hay rake that Will had left
      against the rails of Gore Wood fence, and combed down the
      hay-cock so that the couch marks upon it were effaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun ascended in his strength, and the smell of the hay
      rose like incense. The swathe turner went to and fro, while
      Will used a fork on the grass in the dead lands. The day
      grew very hot, and the shadow of Furze's hat cut a sharper
      line across the brown of his face. His eyes looked very
      blue that morning. Eleven came, and the "greys" were put
      under the shade of the chestnut, and Furze, Will, and the
      boy sat in the shade of a hedge, ruddy and shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall get it in to-night, Will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall that, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the boy who spotted Captain Viner coming down across
      the Doom Paddock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Someone be wantin' you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze scrambled up and went through the gate to meet Mary's
      father. Life glowed so strong in him that it was not
      apparent to him at once that old Viner was the wooden
      soldier, stiff and correct, and buttoned up in a tight
      distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, sir. Come down to see our hay crop?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Viner looked through the gateway at the hay field, and
      pulled his moustache. It began to dawn upon Mary's lover
      that her father was upset about something, and as much
      upset for Furze's sake as for his own. A most awkward
      predicament.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I have a few words--my dear fellow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing wrong I hope, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Viner glanced at the hedge, faced about, and walked
      some twenty paces back towards the house before he spoke to
      the man beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fact is, Furze, my daughter has run away. Early this
      morning. Left a letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze's eyes looked as blank as the blue sky, and old Viner
      saw that there was no cloud in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run away!--But--why--? She was down here last evening--and
      we were making plans."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Viner looked very upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A great blow to us, my dear fellow. Youth's awkward--very
      awkward. We all seem to have been to blame--if anybody is
      to blame--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand, sir," said the lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hesketh fumbled for something in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better read that, my dear fellow. Don't be shocked, don't
      be shocked. Young things and young soldiers are prone to
      panic. Know that--don't you? But I must say--I'm--I'm upset
      about it--very. As if you and I had wanted to make her
      unhappy."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Furze was reading the letter, his eyes growing strange
      under the shadow of his hat. He read it through to the end,
      folded it deliberately, and handed it back to the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My fault," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at the hedge as though he were trying to see
      through something, and his whole face seemed to grow lean
      and dusky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--I don't understand. Loneliness--yes. And a woman's
      work may be dull. All work is dull--unless you have got the
      spirit in you. I thought--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away to master something in himself, and old
      Viner's moustache twitched. He stood very still, helplessly
      still, paraded before life's unexpectedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, my dear fellow, more sorry than I can say. If
      you can feel--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze's voice was very deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor little girl--Fright,--I know,--like the feeling
      before zero hour. She ought to have told me. Love makes one
      rather blind."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at old Viner, and felt a big man's pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was good of you to come, sir. All my fault. Look
      here,--I'll take it quietly. The thing is not to frighten
      her any further. Let her sit quietly on a branch and get
      her breath back. It's--it's just temporary."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt for his pipe, but finding that he had left it and
      his pouch in his jacket pocket, he went for his jacket
      where it was lying under the hedge, with Bobbo guarding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, old chap."
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was gentle. He put on his jacket, and filling his
      pipe, rejoined old Hesketh who had been recovering his
      parade face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry, sir. We'll just keep quiet. She'll get her
      courage back. I'm not a selfish beast, though I must have
      seemed so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a good chap, Arnold. I--I'd like her to marry
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze held a steady match to the bowl of his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is she, sir?"
    </p>

      Old Viner looked very humble.

      Three days later Furze had his letter. It came to him
      without an address, and with a London postmark on the
      envelope. It was the first time that he had seen her
      handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the letter into Mrs. Damaris' parlour, and sat in
      the window-seat and read it. The fine weather had gone, and
      the rain was coming down upon a green world, and upon the
      rank growth of sheep's parsley and pink campion and grasses
      under the hedges. A south-west wind ruffled the trees, and
      blew a heavy scattering of drops from them.

    <blockquote>
      "Try not to think hardly of me, Arnold. I ought to have
      told you before. I'm not fit for the life on a farm. It
      would have been wrong of me to marry you.<br>
      <br>
      I suppose I have had too much of that kind of work. I
      loathe it. I'm pleasure-loving, really, and a town bird. I
      like places where things happen.<br>
      <br>
      You will say that I am being frivolous and selfish. I
      cannot help it. I am going to get a job of some kind--but
      not in a house. I expect my cousin will come to 'Green
      Shutters.' She is forty-three, and her hobby is
      cooking.<br>
      <br>
      Try and forgive me--and don't worry. I'm quite all right
      and feeling so much happier now that I have been honest.
      And please don't try and find me. It will only hurt--you
      and me."
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    <p>
      But that letter hurt him more than she could have guessed.
      She had let him go so far and plan so much, and then had
      snatched the fruit away, and broken the picture he had
      painted of her. Cinderella! Yes, Cinderella married a
      Prince and not a farmer. And he had idealized the woman in
      the house, the sacred presence, the beloved hands. Either
      her love was different from his, or his estimate of woman
      was masculine and fallacious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat and watched the wet dusk gather. He felt very lonely
      and sad. He thought of the home he was preparing for her,
      the lustre tea-service, the simple and secret joy of his
      contrivings, her pale hands hanging over the edge of the
      new sink. Romance--even there, and it clung. O, yes, it
      could not be final. He would have to fell those oaks in the
      winter, and she could not let him fell trees and not come
      to him. This was but a panic mood. She loved him. Why, down
      there in the hay--almost she had been his wife. Perhaps he
      had been too passionate, but this panic would pass, and she
      would come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting there in the dusk, a man who had learnt to be
      patient with things, and who typified the immense constancy
      of the born tiller of the soil, he felt that he had to be
      patient with her. She would learn--she would find things
      out. Yes, it would be like humouring a shy and tender crop.

    <p>
      Clare Biddulph--<i>née</i> Viner--was waiting for her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a woman who never acted upon impulse she had had no
      difficulty in understanding the impulse that had swept her
      sister out of the arms of a man and brought her breathless
      to Weyfleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven years ago Clare Biddulph had escaped the same
      hazardous romance, and come forth from it cool and fresh,
      like a washed primrose, to hang upon a green and shady bank
      where the hot sun of a too primitive maleness could not
      wither her. Seated now at her writing-table in the bay
      window of the "Caradoc" drawing-room, she looked out upon
      the drive and the garden, a stretch of grass with formal
      rose-beds grouped about a bird's bath, and backed by a belt
      of flowering shrubs clustering around the trunks of five
      tall Scotch firs. The garden was small, and yet it
      contrived to convey an impression of sunlit space and of
      dignity, like Clare herself who had demanded dignity and a
      pleasant smoothness, and had attained to them by the wise
      stimulation of an easygoing husband. A Viner, she had
      reacted against the cheap scuffle of modern life. Like the
      rest of the moderns her god was "A Good Time," but it was a
      god with a difference, for she had a nice taste, and a
      loathing of cheapness, and nostrils that could express
      scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had had a day of it with Mary, an emotional
      day,--though her emotions were as well under control as her
      tongue or her tennis racquet. She sympathized because she
      understood, but depth of feeling was not her <i>métier</i>.
      She had sided with the woman and the sister against the man
      and the parents. Mary was lying down with a headache. Clare
      never had a headache or a heartache. That golden head above
      the white throat and the black dress displayed a pale and
      capable fineness. She suggested white light clad in a
      midnight gown. The room was hers, black, mouse-grey and
      gold. Her very writing-table had a studied vividness. Made
      of rosewood it held a cerise-coloured blotter with a
      jade-green tassel, two quill pens--one blue and one
      black--standing erect in a gold inkstand, a scarlet lacquer
      box, an ivory paper-knife with a black handle. She wore her
      hair shingled, and carried her head like an eager and
      questioning boy. Her face had the quality of a face that
      baffles, and yet shows an easy mask to men. Her eyes were
      greenish grey, her lips a little thin but of good colour.
      She smiled easily, but there was much behind the smile that
      listened and watched. She was ambitious. Almost she had a
      man's delight in accomplishing things, and in her energy
      she was more male than her husband. She set herself
      objectives and attained them. "Caradoc" had been an
      objective, this white house with its multitude of gables
      and little tricky bits of brown roof, and unnecessary
      windows in unexpected places. It had a Gothic iron lantern
      over its loggia-porch. "Caradoc" had spelt accomplishment,
      and already it was behind her, and as wrong as that Gothic
      lantern. She had turned herself towards something simpler,
      more spacious, more Georgian. One can change one's house
      more easily than one can change one's mate, and it is
      possible to grow out of both. Clare had grown beyond Leslie
      Biddulph but not away from him. He had many virtues. He was
      an ass, but a good ass. He did not know that he was an ass,
      nor was his assishness too obvious. Moreover, he hailed the
      angel of the Lord in her wherever she raised the shining
      sword. He would fit quite well into her Georgian house. For
      Clare had realized early that to be conventionally
      successful a man must not be too clever. If he can bray
      heartily and loudly to other asses, and stand upon
      platforms, and get up and tell fat after-dinner stories,
      and utter platitudes with emphasis,--so much the better. He
      is a good citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what of Mary the refugee, the possessor of a few odd
      shillings in silver, an old suit-case, and a deplorable
      wardrobe? "Let me stay here two or three weeks, and I'll
      get something to do." Something to do! Good lord! Still,
      the impulse towards freedom was admirable. The simplest
      solution of the problem would be to get her married to some
      convenient man; though the competition in Weyfleet was
      furious, being a simple question of supply and demand. Six
      marriageable young women to every marriageable male, and
      the war generation straining against the shelf towards
      which the building generation was thrusting it! And why
      marriage? Yet, marriage was not so hopeless a career as
      many of the moderns would have us believe. Clare agreed
      that you should consider the alternatives. Granted that
      your aim was to live and to attain to as much comfortable
      and cultivated self expression as was possible, marriage,
      with money and no children or not too many children, had
      much to recommend it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at her wrist-watch. If Leslie had caught the
      4.40, he should appear in the drive at any moment, his
      bowler hat well back on his round and baldish head, and his
      very blue eyes sighting dinner. She would have no trouble
      with Leslie. He was an adjectival man, fresh and florid,
      and so pleasantly pleased with himself that he was an easy
      man about the house. If you allowed him to show off, and
      listened to his throaty tenor voice, and did not interfere
      with his sense of personal picturesqueness he was what is
      called "a dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare Biddulph knew her Leslie through and through. She was
      aware of the fact that he just escaped being a philandering
      ass, but that there was a little kink of self-consciousness
      in him that stiffened his sentimentality. Hence he was able
      to call himself a feminist, and to run after some woman or
      other like a simple and harmless dog who came to heel when
      his real mistress called him. They were attached to each
      other, as attached as most moderns can be. She allowed him
      his tendresse. A man with a round head and a little fair
      moustache and such very shallow blue eyes, and who wore his
      hat well back, and had a tenor voice and loved using it,
      and was a Plus 1 at golf and wore the most flocculent
      tweeds, and took the daily press seriously, and was
      particular about his ties, could not be anything but
      sentimental. His sentimentality would accept Mary and her
      panic mood. The thing would be to prevent him accepting
      Mary and her romance too thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The telephone rang, and Clare Biddulph went to answer it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that Mrs. Biddulph?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--this is Mr. Biddulph's office. Mr. Biddulph told me to
      ring you up, madam. A client has turned up unexpectedly.
      Mr. Biddulph is very sorry, but he could not catch the
      early train."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you find out what train--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The 5.15, madam. He asked me to say--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't you ring me up before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry, madam,--I could not get through. You know
      what--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Mr. Biddulph left the office?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Half an hour ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      She hung up the receiver, glanced at her watch, and
      returned to the writing-table and the window. Leslie was to
      have caught the early train, and after tea and a change
      they were to have driven up to the Hills Club to play a
      practice single. The 5.15 arrived at 5.50. Should she take
      the car out and meet him at the station?
    </p>
    <p>
      Meditating upon Mary's revolt and its possibilities, she
      stroked her firm chin with the feather of the blue quill,
      and chose to remain at home. She decided that it would be
      better not to treat the affair too seriously. Her man could
      be histrionic. He liked to appear as the wonderworking
      male. He was quite capable of launching an indefinite
      invitation to Mary: "My dear girl, make this your home for
      as long as you like--" Men can be so generously vague. It
      had taken her three years to curb Leslie's impulsive asking
      of unexpected people to unprepared dinners. "Pot luck, old
      chap." He was rather regal in his hospitalities. As the
      angel of the Lord she had appeared in the path of the
      prophet and had confounded him by having cold boiled mutton
      and steamed potatoes placed before a very special but
      unexpected guest. His face! "My dear old girl--surely--you
      could have rummaged up something--" But he had sprung no
      more surprises upon the larder.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nibbled the end of the quill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A month--at the outside. We can arrange something."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Leslie Biddulph stood up and gave his seat to a girl
      wearing a red hat. She had come in with the crowd at
      Piccadilly Circus, a little, dark, sallow thing who looked
      tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please take my seat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--thanks so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a very kind creature and a very vain one, and his
      wife's clever hand had taken hold of his kindness and used
      it for the controlling of his vanity. He stood quite close
      to the girl in the red hat, his right knee almost touching
      hers, looking down at her, and noticing her well-worn
      attaché case and shabby gloves. She was a pretty thing, and
      inhaling the perfume of her pallor and her poverty,
      Biddulph felt protective. Little dark women with pansy
      faces provoked him, especially those like this one who kept
      her duskiness hidden under the brim of her hat, fully
      conscious of the sentimental male poised there hanging to a
      strap. At Waterloo she made ready to rise, and Biddulph
      stood back and kept the enthusiastic thrusters off her
      toes. He expected her to give him a glance; he felt that he
      deserved it; but she went out with veiled eyes, and he
      followed, walking close behind her and admiring her legs,
      pretty, slim, feverish legs. He entered the same lift and
      managed to place himself so that he had a view of her
      profile. These dusky, pansy faces! How pleasant to possess
      a garden full of them, and to walk out in the cool of the
      evening, a male god with a sentimental if polygamous
      watering-can, while all the pansy faces were raised
      gratefully to the dispenser of male dew. From the lift
      Biddulph followed the red hat up the steps and along the
      passage-way. He had to walk fast, for she was one of the
      feverish crowd, rushing homewards like a lot of blown
      leaves, dodging, making little gusty dashes and
      circumlocutions. She was out of breath for the
      suburbs,--"To half an hour's bumble-puppy tennis," as he
      put it to himself, "or a cheap novel in a little back
      garden, or a cheap boy." Being bald-headed at thirty-three
      he liked to philosophize about women. He supposed that the
      little thing in the red hat disliked work as nearly all
      moderns disliked it, and his feeling about it was that all
      pretty women should be lying about in punts or hammocks or
      on sofas, pleasantly dependent upon munificent males. As
      for that little tired, dark-eyed thing, she ought to be
      comforted with caresses. Meanwhile he lost her and her hat.
      She had scurried through the gates to catch some suburban
      train, and Biddulph, feeling tenderly regretful, went on to
      a first-class corner seat in the 5.15 for Weyfleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was filling a pipe when a man named Sark joined him.
      "Pale hands I loved" was running in Biddulph's head, and
      Sark was neither pale nor particularly lovable. He was
      fifty-five years old, and fat, and seemed to be in a
      perpetual perspiration. His red face looked as though it
      had been broadened and flattened by long pressure against
      the warm bosom of prosperity. He wore spats. Sark did
      business with Messrs. Thomson and Biddulph. He was a warm
      man, and in some senses a hot one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddulph nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Evening, Sark."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not like Sark, though they travelled together, and
      played golf together, and argued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dashed hot to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddulph opened his evening paper, and Sark eased his
      trousers over his fat knees, and after staring rather
      brutally at a girl who was passing the window, seemed to
      sit and possess the vision of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fixed up for Sunday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm playing tennis. Wife wants some practice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's hot stuff these days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She plays a nice game," said the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two more men entered the carriage, and lit pipes and opened
      papers, and sat at their ease while the hurrying thirds
      pressed forward strainingly, looking for places. Sark
      watched the hustle of the lesser people and enjoyed it. He
      never failed to enjoy it, the sense of superiority that it
      gave him, for--after all--when you are five-and-fifty and
      own two motor-cars and a house with "grounds," it is
      pleasant to sit in a secure and well-padded corner and
      watch the cheap folk getting the knocks. Sark was honest
      about it. He thought of the crowd of underlings as silly
      sheep. He liked to sit in a first-class carriage or in his
      big car and see the sheep being thoroughly uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddulph read his paper. He was not feeling conversational,
      or interested in Sark's views on the coal-miners and their
      spokesmen. Who was interested in miners provided that your
      coal was forthcoming at a reasonable price? Red hats were
      much more piquing, and people who smelt dainty. At Weyfleet
      he dashed to catch one of the station buses. It dropped him
      at the end of Oaks Road, a pleasant and shaded highway, the
      newness of its houses softened by the presence of old
      trees. Here were Scotch firs, oaks, limes and acacias. And
      hanging over the oak fences lilac and laburnum, and red
      thorn, and syringa, and purple buddleia, and pyrus
      floribunda. Oaks Road had a quiet aloofness. Little common
      children were not known in it. Clare--in her wisdom had
      said--"Never live where there are cottages." The democratic
      illusion dies in a garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddulph passed through the oak gates of "Caradoc." He
      talked a good deal in the train about his roses. "Must have
      loam--you know," and he pronounced it "loom." "Caradoc"
      made him feel good, just as a nice white dress shirt did.
      Not so bad for the junior partner in the firm of Thomson
      and Biddulph, solicitors!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his wife saw him, and a something that was motherly
      came into her eyes. A woman may surrender many illusions,
      but the feeling of motherliness to the whimpering pup in
      man may last her her lifetime. She saw Leslie so very
      clearly, hat well back, round face buxom and self-pleased,
      black coat just so, his striped trousers perfectly creased.
      He called her darling a dozen times a day, when he had lost
      his socks or his cigarette case was empty. His blue eyes
      saw the surface of things and women. She was quite sure
      that some day she would get him into the House of Commons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leslie."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was playing with the blue quill, and her voice fastened
      upon him as he reached the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo,--darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awfully sorry. A blighter up from Manchester. Simply had
      to see him--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, of course. I got the message."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll rush in and change, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Clare, balancing the blue quill like a miniature spear,
      looked upwards. The pink room was nearly overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No hurry. Come in here."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had to tell him to close the door; he had a way of
      leaving doors and drawers open, though he spoke of himself
      as a methodical chap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary is here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was tapping a cigarette on a silver box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--a little trouble. The romantic moment arrived, and
      she ran away from it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leslie looked solemn and a little shocked. He took romance
      very seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love affair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well,--yes,--and a general reaction against Sussex clay.
      We have got to be kind to her, Leslie, for two or three
      weeks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on the back of the sofa. It was obvious that he
      wanted to know exactly what sort of kindness he had to
      display. Besides--his wife's sister was one of the dusky,
      poignant women.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman's first love affair always seems serious--to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, darling. But I don't quite see--unless the man
      is a blackguard--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is such a thing as being too much in love--with the
      wrong person."
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddulph's voice grew throaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, that's it,--a married man, one of those polygamous
      fellows--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No,--he's not married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not! But do I understand--she cares?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a sort of way. She'll get over it. We must help her to
      get over it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course,--darling,--rather."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, when she had told him just as much as she thought
      it good for him to know, and had tinted the picture to her
      fancy, she chose to remember the John Bull in him, also
      that he was a legal light, and rather punctilious about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a man of the world,--Leslie,--don't you agree?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he agreed. He mounted his chivalrous horse. That
      farmer fellow deserved to be kicked. Selfish, tyrannical,
      obsolete fool! To expect a sensitive modern girl,--and a
      gentlewoman--mark you--to bury herself in an old barn of a
      place, and scrub and cook and mend and make butter!
      Preposterous! Did the fellow think that a wife was nothing
      but a servant? No,--by Jove! Sort of case that made you
      feel hot--because you knew just where it would end. The
      Divorce Court. O, yes, as a lawyer, he knew a little. And
      the old people too--they appeared to have encouraged the
      affair; having made a slave of poor Mary, they had been for
      pushing her into married slavery. Not that he was saying
      anything against "Darling's parents." Old people were old
      people. Let them send for their Cousin Nellie. Meanwhile
      poor little Mary should be comforted. And she wanted to
      work--did she? Splendid! O, yes, he was quite sure that he
      could find her a job, not too onerous a job. Yes, but it
      was their business to give her a good time for a month or
      so; she needed a holiday, rest. And supposing that fellow
      Furze should try to follow her up and make trouble? Leslie
      the lawyer--the man of the world--would deal with him; he
      would enjoy it; he would open the fellow's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a dear," said his wife. "I like a man to be a
      rock, but a kind rock."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Mary was persuaded down to eat a little dinner. She was
      made to drink two glasses of port, poured out in person by
      Darling's husband. He was consciously tactful, and you
      could see him exercising it, riding it with dignity.
      Nothing was said about the Sussex romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary must have a good time. They would put her up as a
      temporary member at the Hills Club. Did she play much
      tennis? A rabbit! But he was sure that she was such a nice
      brown rabbit. Clare, who was a regular pro these days,
      would give her some coaching. And, of course, they must go
      to Wimbledon. And Henley. He might manage a day off for
      Henley; he would arrange for a punt.
    </p>
    <p>
      His kindness reduced a young woman, who was still in a very
      emotional state,--to tears. It was a signal triumph; he was
      quite moved by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a dear Leslie is," said one sister to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he's a kind old thing. I'll come and tuck you
      up,--baby."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does Leslie know--everything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not--quite--everything. But he approves. That man was
      expecting the impossible from you."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mary had spent a week at Weyfleet three years ago, but that
      was before the Biddulphs had climbed as high as "Caradoc."
      They had lived in rather a stuffy little red villa near the
      river. A lucky speculation in real estate, and an alliance
      with an enterprising building contractor had given the firm
      of Thomson and Biddulph considerable pickings. "Caradoc"
      was half-way up. The Biddulphs had left the Valley, but
      they had not quite reached the Hills, though they played
      tennis, and golfed and danced there. Clare had her eyes on
      the heights, and she meant her man to scale them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to live upon the Hills it was necessary to possess
      a considerable income. That and that alone was necessary
      for the near dweller upon Olympus. A crude criterion, but
      capable of much refinement, and Clare Biddulph was not
      crude. That mysterious community living in spacious
      seclusion among the pinewoods, and much beauty of bracken
      and tall trees and gardens, did not cohere in the matter of
      self-consciousness. Much of it was very self-conscious, but
      not quite self-sure. It was a mixed community; you met
      Midas and you met his Master, and it was the Master who
      mattered. That Clare knew. You had to back your money bluff
      with something better if you desired to be the real thing.
      There were other values. To play games rather superlatively
      well was one of the most important. Smartness counted, that
      ultra-refinement of smartness, expensive simplicity. You
      must dance well, and play a good game of bridge, and be
      able to look other women calmly in the eyes, and "my dear"
      them with complete composure. If you had one or two little
      cultured hobbies, and did not advertise them too flagrantly
      a little mysterious radiance was added. It was allowed that
      you might know something about mezzotints or lacquer, or
      dabble nicely in Theosophy, or be an amateur connoisseur of
      the dramatic or collect first editions. The Hills had their
      select few, some really charming and notable people, and
      Clare had her eyes upon these.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not one of those who pressed blindly upwards
      clutching a purse. She was not prejudiced. She had
      never--like many of the Valley women,--spoken sneeringly of
      the Hills--because they would not be able to arrive there.
      "Just a lot of Jews, my dear, and Central Europeans." Clare
      knew better. What that mysterious community signified was a
      problem in psychology. Certainly--it did not itself know.
      Self-analysis is not for the many, nor is self-realization.
      But Clare had vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare had understanding, and so had Mary Viner. She was
      less clever than her elder sister, but she too knew
      instinctively all that the Hills offered to a woman. It was
      a porcelain bath, a new art garden, a jewel case, a perfect
      motor-car, a ball-room, a sumptuous little corner full of
      cushions. Life was very easy, or seemed so. A little
      pleasant boredom sent you off to Switzerland or Spain or
      the Riviera or Dinard. You were less than twenty miles from
      New Bond Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay in bed and felt both miserable and happy. She had
      run away from her poor lover, and her running away had made
      her angry with him. Clare and her husband had reinforced
      this anger, insisting that she had been shamefully proposed
      to, and threatened with exploitation. A common drudge in a
      farmer's house! So she too insisted upon her anger, because
      she was not quite sure of it, but she meant to be sure of
      it. She would take Clare's advice and quickly forget those
      kisses, his possessive but devoted strength, that fragrant
      and tumbled hay-cock. He would find someone else with a
      broader and easier lap. She was too slimly built for that
      sort of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Clare had put it--"My dear, woman's most blessed escape
      is from the first man she falls in love with. Leslie was my
      third."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mary let herself be spoilt and persuaded. No, she could
      not go back to Cinder Town, not permanently, and Cousin
      Nellie could carry on. Of course, when she got a job she
      would help the old people, send them presents, go down for
      week-ends. But she wished the break to be final, a hiatus
      that could not be bridged with useless sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel that the life would have killed me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare was more of a realist and less emotionally emphatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would have bored you to skin and bone, my dear, which
      is worse than being killed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary wrote her letters. Furze had read two of them, and her
      people read a third. Meanwhile Cousin Nellie had arrived,
      the devoted and predestinated stop-gap, and built for it,
      being rotund and busy and cheerful, with a passion for
      doing things for other people. She had little to say about
      Mary, and that little was kind and to the point. "I felt
      like that myself--once. These young things! Now--I wonder
      where on earth she put the fish-kettle? There--must--be a
      fish-kettle--somewhere." She was more sorry for Furze than
      for anyone else, for Furze came to "Green Shutters" and
      looked many things and said little. "Well, she has missed a
      man anyway, if she has missed him. Still--we are not all
      made the same." Cousin Nellie was a philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, at Weyfleet, there was a secret part of Mary Viner
      that was a little sad and ashamed. She was not being
      selfish; O--no; she was only seeking self-expression. None
      the less there were times when that old Sussex house
      haunted her, seeming to project its softened gloom into the
      bright and pagan life about her. It reproached her. That
      new kitchen range, and the sink, and the hot water, and the
      rose-coloured china! "Traitress," it called her; "you will
      let him sacrifice his trees."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, but better the trees than herself. Diligently she set
      herself to repress awkward memories. Darling's husband,
      generous fellow, had given Clare a cheque for her sister,
      and Clare knew of a clever little woman in the place who
      made you delightful frocks for half the price you had to
      pay in town. Mary hid herself in a thicket of
      pretty-pretties.

    </p>
    <p>
      Clare Biddulph had been given tickets for Ranelagh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She parked her two-seater car on the grass under the elms
      beside the drive, and smiled at a large-eyed child of a
      sister who stood there between fear and wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a lot of cars!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The world streamed cars, cars of all sizes and colours, and
      of every degree of luxuriousness. A haze of dust hung in
      the sunlight between the trees, and while one sister spoke
      to a one-armed man in charge of the cars, the other stood
      in the shadow, a little shrinkingly, like a woodland spirit
      brought suddenly to the edge of a glade in the forest of
      the Roi Soleil. Here was a Fete Gallante, and brown eyes
      gazing at the beginnings of a world that possessed those
      things that the heart of her desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's awfully smart."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare had given her sister one of her last year's frocks, a
      black marocain dress, and a little cerise-coloured straw
      hat. "O, my dear, how generous of you!" had been Mary's
      cry, though as Cinderella she had not probed too carefully
      for motives. Clare herself was wearing painted chiffon, a
      beautiful, fluttering gauzy thing, with the texture of a
      butterfly's wings, a blurr of soft blues and greens and
      greys and purples. Her eyes were serene and cool under an
      amber-coloured straw. Could anything be more satisfying and
      fascinating than dress? To be smart and to look smart with
      the perfection of easy simplicity. Mary fluttered a little
      and was shy. Really, Clare was wonderful, and Clare had the
      pleasant sense of being felt to be wonderful, and generous,
      and wise, a complete woman of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the club-house. We'll have tea--presently--on the
      lawn."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was casual. She dawdled. A well-dressed woman
      should never hurry, or be caught in a moment of
      breathlessness, physical or spiritual. The thing was to
      trail coolly in the sunlight, or under the shadows of the
      trees, while other women gave you those little significant
      glances which you noticed and yet did not appear to notice.
      A perfectly dressed sang-froid could approach very near to
      the holy of holies. Moreover, it was of much more
      importance to impress women--the real critics with eyes
      that could pull you to pieces. "Shaftesbury Avenue, or
      Leicester Square, or St. Paul's Churchyard, my dear!" No,
      that must not be whispered. The men were far less
      important. They just thought a woman looked nice. Not one
      man in a hundred could discern details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was crude. She looked about her too much, like a young
      person at a fête. She was a little scared, and inclined to
      exclaim and ask questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They have a golf-course!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And tennis-courts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are all those coloured things over there--where the
      horses are?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Those liquid brown of her eyes suggested a melting
      short-sightedness. Almost she was pointing a finger across
      the polo ground. Her colour came and went quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Turbans," said her sister, "Indians, grooms, syces. An
      Indian team is playing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They look like great red flowers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare's voice was casual.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The thing is to get a seat in the shade. Which side shall
      it be? Polo--or the pony show--and the four-in-hands and
      the ladies' hacks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to see everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare smiled. Would this eager breathlessness appeal to
      some man? The male was supposed to be more vulnerable when
      innocence, the Arcadian nymph, shot her virginal and
      haphazard arrows. Men were so obvious and yet so
      unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Casually she appropriated a chair under one of the chestnut
      trees close to the white kiosk where the orchestra sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going to be a big crowd."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary took another chair like a child seizing a cake. Yes,
      it was a crowd, such a crowd as she had never seen. The
      dresses! These painted chiffons, and muslin and laces,
      floating, softly brilliant, beautiful with a beauty that
      made her afraid. She was happy,--and she wanted to weep.
      She adored beauty. She thrilled to a beautiful frock, a
      hat, the pattern of a sunshade. She felt like a thirsty
      child in a garden full of fruit. It was wonderful and
      exquisite and frightening and tantalizing. All these
      colours! And the men in the red jerseys with the red bands
      round their straw hats! And the other men in top hats, grey
      and black, and bowler hats, and soft hats. The orchestra
      was playing a fox-trot. She dreamed and gazed, and drummed
      with her fingers on the back of a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everybody must be very rich."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are as rich as you look, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while Mary was voiceless. She palpitated like a bird.
      She gazed at people, other women, and now and again a man
      glanced at her. What a world--what an exquisite world! She
      thrilled between the polo and the horse and pony show. She
      kept jumping up and going from one side to the other,
      flying like an eager shuttle through the web of sunlight
      and shadow. Clare, cool and serene, moved very little, and
      when she did move it was to be looked at.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mary's first game of polo and she watched it like an
      excited child. The verve and the virility of it set the
      feminine part of her stirring. These brown, lean men on the
      little galloping ponies! How they rode! Surely, someone
      would be hurt! And when they came galloping to the boards
      after the white ball she felt that she was in the face of a
      cavalry charge and flinched a little, but with the delight
      of the woman in the hot and the helter-skelter courage of
      the men. She thought only for a moment of that other brown
      man cutting hay in Sussex, and she put the thought aside
      with a quick qualm of pity. He seemed poor and obscure
      beside these galloping cavaliers, a fustian figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do they keep riding off the field?"--"Aren't they
      clever with their mallets." "Why are the ones in blue and
      white knocking it the other way now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare had to muffle up these crudities. Mary had yet to
      learn her lesson, to keep her mouth shut unless she was
      sure of bringing out the right word when she opened it.
      Mallets--indeed! Her sisterliness sat poised between
      amusement and the urgent need of hinting. But when someone
      stood up and opened a sunshade, and Mary was for climbing
      on her chair, Clare gave a tweak to the black frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      It restored Mary to self-consciousness; it brought her
      childishness tumbling like a winged bird. From that moment
      she was the woman, painfully so, but in a way that was good
      for her own soul. Caution came to her, and the eye that
      looks slily round; her face became expressionless, and a
      little moody; she remembered the other women; she became
      aware of a frock. Everybody--or nearly everybody--was
      wearing colours, and she blushed suddenly for her
      blackness. But what an ungrateful blush! She looked
      anxiously around for other figures in black, and was a
      little consoled when three smart French girls passed by in
      the colours of night. She scrutinized them interestedly,
      their frocks, their hats, the white creaminess of their
      skins. She realized that she was too rustic and too ruddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare's voice drawled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about tea? I hate rushes. We may as well make sure of
      a table in the shade."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went, and on the way Mary surprised her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks--for pulling me off that chair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm not narky. I needed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      They strolled across the lawn and possessed themselves of a
      table under the shade of an acacia. A red-coated waiter
      brought them tea. The crowd grew thick about them as other
      people sought the shade, and Clare became aware of a change
      in her sister. Mary was controlling her glances and her
      movements, cloaking too provincial a curiosity, powdering
      out the flush of her self-consciousness. Clare's soul gave
      a little, approving nod. Mary was quick; she had the
      understanding that could keep quiet, and muffle the too
      obvious ticking of her cheap clockwork. Good girl! The
      woman who can smooth out her face and hold her tongue can
      conjure up possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enjoying it--Baby? That frock suits you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is lovely here."
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke as though she had tasted some new and exquisite
      fruit, and its luscious mellowness was all to her liking.
      Only a week ago she had been gnawing a crab-apple sort of
      life in Cinder Town. Good heavens, had Arnold really made
      love to her by offering her a kitchen range and a new sink?
      She smiled at her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like this. So complete and well done, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty fair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not my world, of course--but I shall hope to get glimpses
      of it--even though I may be working in an office."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--things happen," said her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drive home was a silent one. Clare had the sun in her
      eyes, and she did not like talking when she was driving a
      car. "Too many fools on the road, you know." She drove very
      well, better than Leslie did, but then she did most things
      well. Mary lay back and was full of the afternoon's
      significance. She had no doubt at all but that this was the
      sort of world to which she wished to belong, for even if
      you did not quite belong to it you could share much that it
      enjoyed. She allowed herself to dream. The dream might be
      absurd, but then all dreams are supposed to be absurd, and
      even a pretty girl with three half-pence in her pocket and
      wearing her sister's cast-off clothes can venture beyond
      realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a narrow road beyond Esher they had to pass a wagon
      loaded with hay and the smell of it was a sudden shock to
      her. What a complex structure was the human heart! You had
      cupboards in it, and rooms, which you had to shut up. That
      Sussex hay-field, and the moon and the dew, and a man's
      arms, and his kisses, and the weight of his love upon her
      bosom! She struggled to free herself from the memories, as
      she had freed herself from his passion, urging herself
      towards resentment, because she was able to tell herself
      that Furze would have dragged her down to a cheap struggle
      with poverty. She did not want to be poor, and if she had
      to be poor she would prefer to be poor by herself.
      Moreover, he was just a common farmer, with no mystery
      about him, powerless to give her the things she desired. He
      would have looked clumsy on one of those polo ponies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her warmer self reacted. Poor Arnold! How beastly of her to
      feel ashamed of him. She humiliated herself for a little
      while, and tried to escape from her heart's accusations by
      assuring herself that she had been kind in being cruel.
      Yes,--even to her parents. They would be far happier with
      Cousin Nellie. And yet she was one of those creatures who
      like to be propped by someone else's opinion, and to be
      reassured by sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't think me too horribly selfish, Clare?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister did not take her eyes off the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For wanting to be yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I expect they are saying terrible things about
      me--down there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let them. Better to have terrible things said--than to be
      terribly bored. Words break no bones. The thing is--in
      these days--to keep your eyes on the road."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have such pluck. You always had. Do you remember
      fighting that horrid boy on Hastings beach--because he
      threw sand at me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do. How old was I then? Ten. Don't be too soft-hearted,
      Baby. We have added a duty to all those other duties to
      one's parents and neighbours and the Deity--duty to
      oneself. And it comes first, my dear. Charity begins at
      home."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked kindly at Mary as she turned the car into the
      Oaks Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we listened to all that the previous generation said of
      us! But we don't. That's youth."

    </p>
    <p>
      Bobbo the dog had been run over by a lorry on the Melhurst
      road. It had been a hopeless case from the first, in spite
      of the veterinary surgeon from Carslake, and Furze's gentle
      and devoted hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better shoot the poor beast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't do it, man."
    </p>
    <p>
      The vet. looked pityingly at both dog and man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. Like shooting your best friend. But if--you
      like--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chloroform--or something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A shot is quicker--and as kind. If you'll send your man
      in--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze went into Mrs. Damans' parlour and shut the door, and
      sat down on the sofa. With his elbows on his knees, and his
      hands over his ears, he waited, hearing what he did not
      wish to hear, the low voices and the movements of the two
      men, and a whimper from the dog. He set his teeth, while
      his heart was the heart of a little wailing boy. He heard
      them go out; they were carrying the dog between them on an
      old rug, and presently from somewhere he heard the dull
      report of the gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up, quivering, conscious of a sudden and deep
      anger, a voiceless rage against fate. His dog! Such a
      kind-eyed, trustful, wise creature. Just an inert and
      bloody mass--now. He hoped that Kelly had not shot him in
      the head. But did it matter--if Bobbo's suffering was over?
      And yet his anger spread. It enlarged itself like the red
      glare of a fire seen through a fog, and until it included
      in its glow half the field of his consciousness. Love had
      let him down a second time. Meanwhile, Will Blossom had got
      poor Bobbo into a sack so that Furze should not see the
      dog's dead body, for Will as a man had a man's
      understanding of certain things. Kelly the vet. had mounted
      his horse and ridden off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kelly be gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've put he in a sack by t' gate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, Will. You are a good chap."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Furze went out and buried his dog, digging a grave in
      the grass under Mrs. Damaris' window. And when Bobbo was
      laid in his brown hole, the anger went out of his master,
      and pity entered in, compassion for all dumb, and
      unfortunate and gentle things. It spread to the woman who
      had given him kisses and then run away from him. Poor
      little Mary. Timid, quick-breathing, brown-eyed thing.
      Marriage had frightened her, and all that marriage implied.
      The strangeness of it. And children. Yes, perhaps some
      women dreaded that ordeal, the sickness, and the pangs, and
      the vague terrors. He had not thought of that before.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face cleared, and his eyes grew gentle. He went to call
      the cows in from the field at milking time, and as he sat
      with his head pressed against a warm flank, and watched the
      white milk purring into the pail, his compassion deepened.
      These cows of his were gentle beasts, and life should be
      gentle, and full of the wholesomeness of good milk. Things
      seemed so simple when you had understanding, the
      understanding that a deep love gives; it was the greeds and
      the prides and the restlessnesses that turned life sour.
      Why were people restless? Because they were not happy with
      simple things, and wanted elaboration, and ceased to want
      it when they had got it, and started wanting something
      else. Hard work kept a man straight, the work that entailed
      the care of live plants and creatures, and taught him
      sympathy for them, and convinced him of man's elemental
      duties. Having a good time! Man was not on the earth to
      have a good time. "By the sweat of thy brow--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Great men those old Hebrews. When man--and woman with
      him--ceased to labour they cease to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cool of the evening he went down to Cinder Town,
      taking a basket of eggs with him. At "Green Shutters" he
      found old Hesketh pottering in his garden, tying bast round
      his sweet-pea sticks. Poor Coode, with a curly and
      melancholy pipe pendant from his mouth, was hanging over
      the fence. He slipped away when he saw Furze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brought you a few eggs, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, my dear fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Hesketh looked tired. Youth had departed, the young
      bird had flown, and though he had recognized the
      inevitableness of it more readily than his wife had done,
      something had gone out of life. He was at the end of the
      last lap. He looked gentler; the lovable awkwardness of his
      long legs and body suggested a new feebleness. The old
      people had taken it very well; they had naturalized the
      adventure. O, yes, Mary had gone to her sister's to take a
      post in London. Very natural and proper; young women had to
      work these days; his pension would be reduced to a minute
      allowance to his wife when he died. He had very little to
      leave. Mary had looked ahead. Young women had to think of
      the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze did not tell old Viner about Bobbo. He was the sort
      of man who kept his troubles to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how was Mary? Had they heard again?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Mary was with her sister. Her brother-in-law was
      looking out for a post for her. A secretaryship, something
      of that sort. After all, you could not blame the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I blame myself," said Furze gravely; "I frightened her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Hesketh unravelled a length of bast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--I should not say that, my dear fellow. We have to
      live and learn--you know. Let her try another sort of
      work--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To my mind--work is the only thing that matters,
      especially when there is someone else--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, just so. Women find that out--I expect. You'll come in
      and have some supper with us. Miss Farren has made a
      gooseberry tart. And there is the cream you sent us this
      morning. Very good of you, my dear fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze stayed to supper, for in that little house the scent
      of a girl's hair seemed to linger.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was three o'clock on the Saturday afternoon, and a day
      of heat and of pleasant languor, and Mary, standing in
      front of the long mirror in the white wardrobe, saw herself
      as June. White muslin with a patterning of blurred rose
      upon it, a present from Uncle Leslie. He had claimed an
      avuncular interest in her, and now he was out there in his
      flannels, sitting in the car, and squeezing the bulb of the
      horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say--you two--it's three o'clock. I fixed up with the
      Ryders for three."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary went to the window and looked down at him lounging in
      the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So sorry, Uncle Leslie. I'm ready now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, you are--are you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The upward glance of his appreciative blue eyes assured her
      that she was a pretty thing, and that she looked charming
      in that white-brimmed straw with its black ribbon and gold
      medallion. Leslie had views upon hats. He disapproved of
      the "cloche," and said that a woman's eye and forehead
      should be shaded. "Bit of mystery--you know. Who wants to
      look at a Spartan wench in a hard thing like a helmet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They were going to the Hills Club for tennis, Mary in the
      dickey, Clare beside her husband, and the car ascended
      towards those fortunate regions. To one of the three it was
      a sun-chariot. She had come fresh from a scented bath into
      her muslins, and she felt exquisitely cool, and the smell
      of the bath-salts lingered. Blessed symbolism, a perfumed
      bath! And she could smell the pines, and had glimpses of
      big houses and gardens, and spreading lawns and roses, and
      herbaceous borders threading strands of colour. The car
      turned in at the white gate and glided along the avenue to
      the clubhouse. On the left stretched the courts, and they
      seemed to Mary to be innumerable with the high stop netting
      on green standards, and their yellow posts, and upon them
      happy figures, men in flannels, young girls--short skirted
      and short sleeved and white armed in the sunlight. High
      woods of beech and pine threw a protecting greenness about
      the place, and all those sleek lawns ended in soft shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddulph drove to the broad space in front of the clubhouse
      and turned the car there. He need not have driven so far,
      but the pomp and the joy of life prompted him to it. The
      high terrace in front of the neo-Georgian house was crowded
      with people, girls and women in Dryad chairs, or sitting
      upon red cushions laid on the coping of the terrace wall.
      Scores of eyes looked down at them. And Biddulph turned the
      car at his leisure, smiling at friends, knowing that he had
      two pretty women to show off, his women, and that he
      himself was a good-looking chap and a successful one, and
      no rabbit at games.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare understood the man&oelig;uvre, and approved. That was
      why she and her man ran so well together in double harness,
      for they liked high-stepping and showed each other off, but
      Mary had less right to be confident. Her eyelids drooped
      under the gaze of all those other eyes; she felt perched
      up--and too prominent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going to park?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Under one of the trees, Darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned the car to the left of the club-house where a
      grove of trees threw a pleasant shade, and a little lake
      lay cool and placid. There were other cars here, and
      Biddulph had to insinuate the two-seater into the shade. He
      struck a patch of sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have to back a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind him rose a warning hoot, and Mary's voice quickly
      anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A car behind us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddulph put in the hand-brake and looked round, smiled,
      raised a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, Fream. Didn't know you were there. I'll crawl up a
      bit farther."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary had exchanged glances with the solitary man in the
      other car. She thought that it was the biggest car that she
      had ever seen, a blue monster, the colour of a blackbird's
      egg, and all a-glitter. Its immense balloon tyres looked as
      big as bolsters. The man in it had a very pale face, and
      wore rimless pince-nez. He sat there with a stiff passivity
      and in complete silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddulph was helping her out of the dickey, and keeping her
      muslin frock away from the grease-caps on the back springs.
      He smiled over it--and enjoyed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare had drifted back to the blue car and was talking to
      the man in it, and her eyes looked round at Mary. "We have
      my sister with us. She's a nice child, but rather shy.
      Mary--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the blue car raised his grey hat.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Fream--my sister--Miss Viner."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the car did not smile, but he gave her a sort of
      stiff movement of the body, nor did Mary then know that he
      was incapable of smiling. His age was an uncertain
      quantity; he might have been an old thirty or a young
      fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was looking into a large, firm and expressionless face.
      It was very flat and white, and the pale blue eyes seemed
      to flatten themselves behind his glasses. He was
      clean-shaven, his hair very black and lustreless, and
      growing too far down the nape of his neck. When he got out
      of the car she realized his height. It seemed to exaggerate
      the narrowness of his shoulders. He held himself stiff as a
      poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he had a certain presence, an imposing stiffness, a
      negative dignity that owed its quality to the fact that it
      was perfectly expressionless. Everything about him
      suggested wealth; he was admirably tailored; and yet he
      lacked something. And he seemed to know that he lacked it,
      and wore steel corsets to hide the secret from the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delighted," was all he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddulph bobbed beside him like a white yacht in the
      neighbourhood of a lighthouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are supposed to be playing Tom Ryder and his wife at
      three."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Fream looked supremely uninterested, but his length
      attached itself to the Biddulph party. He walked as though
      he were on stilts. He was not in flannels, but wore a grey
      tweed suit, black socks and shoes, a soft white collar and
      a black knitted tie. He looked at neither of the women, and
      yet his expressionless rigidity was not exactly
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare suggested that he should come and watch their match
      with the Ryders. There would be just a trace of healthy
      venom in the game. The Ryders fancied themselves in a mixed
      double, and Clare had made up her mind to beat them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fream expressed no opinion, nor did he show any desire to
      watch the game or to avoid watching it. He was never heard
      to express a definite opinion on any subject, or to betray
      an inclination or a liking or a prejudice. He stood on his
      long legs, with that perfectly expressionless and pallid
      face of his looking down on the lesser people with the
      impartiality of a full moon. He would listen and not utter
      a word. He cast a chill over the cheery soul like Biddulph
      who was a Sun in Taurus. His enemies--and he had not a few
      and mostly envious males, called him the "Whited
      Sepulchre." But he went along with the Biddulph party to
      No. 3 Court where the Ryders were waiting, and stood with a
      pallid silence in the midst of the clatter, his arms
      pressed to his sides, his right hand grasping his left
      wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, when the Biddulphs and the Ryders went on to No. 3
      Court, Mary was left beside Mr. Fream to share his
      uncomfortable silence, for his silence did make her feel
      uncomfortable. She wondered why? Or was it wholly due to
      her own shyness? They were standing, and she stole a look
      at him. "I should like to sit down," she thought, and her
      thought seemed to penetrate, for he went off and fetched
      her a chair. He came back, holding it very stiffly, almost
      as though he was competing in an egg-and-spoon race.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you sit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat. She had coloured up and thanked him, and had
      caught a vague something in his eyes that she had not been
      able to interpret. He stood beside and slightly behind her,
      and the silence continued. They watched the game as it was
      played by four people who had some right to consider
      themselves to be experts. Mrs. Ryder was a lean little
      woman with a yellow face who popped her tongue out whenever
      she hit a hard drive. Her husband was an irritable and busy
      player, all red where his wife was yellow. The Biddulphs
      were much more pleasant to look at: Clare gracefully
      intent, and clean in all her movements: Leslie smiling like
      the perfect sportsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence continued. Mary had a feeling that unless she
      broke it she would lose her self-respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you play this game?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His reply arrived after a moment of deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not often. Do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, very badly. I am not very good at games--not like my
      sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      After that--he went and fetched another chair, and placed
      it within a yard of hers, and for fully a minute neither of
      them uttered a word. Mary caught her sister glancing at
      them as she came up to the net before Leslie's service, and
      the glance had a quality of interest and of slight
      surprise. The silence continued, and she continued to be
      piqued by it. Either he was completely bored or wholly
      indifferent. Or was it that he did not consider it to be
      good form to talk when four people were playing a grim and
      friendly game? He sat perfectly still, following the ball
      with his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good style--your sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      He fixed the remark at her suddenly, but without looking at
      her, and when he had fired that one shot he withdrew to
      reload.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clare does things so well."
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded very slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four--two to them, and thirty love. Want them to win,
      don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His aside was almost intimate, though it appeared to cause
      him trouble with his collar. He tugged at it as though he
      found it too tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was smiling, and he was the receiver of the smile. For
      quite a minute he sat beside her with the air of a man who
      had made a discovery and was pondering it and turning it
      over in his mind. Once or twice he looked intently at her
      profile. She was watching the game, and the softness of
      that smile seemed to linger. He brought out a cigarette
      case. It contained three different kinds of cigarette, and
      he chose a cork-tipped Virginia. His face expressed effort,
      an inarticulate striving against a queer form of
      self-paralysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Been here before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again an abrupt question, but she had begun to feel that
      the abruptness was not intentional. She was provoked to
      curiosity. He did not seem to her to be an ordinary sort of
      man, and she had begun to wonder about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--not here. It is a lovely place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Staying long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three or four weeks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come from the country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The question annoyed her slightly. Why should he assume her
      to be a rustic?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unfortunately--yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he sat in silence as though he were doing figures in
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't like the country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not being buried."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The joy of life. That's it."
    </p>
    <p>
      His way of uttering those last words made her jump like a
      fish at a strange and compelling fly. What a strange twist
      in his voice, a mocking flick, something of a sneer! Yes,
      and more than that--a twinge of pain. Was he mocking at her
      little confession, her eagerness to enjoy things?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why shouldn't one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her colour had quickened, and her mouth and eyes were
      poignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? Of course--why not?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost he had a startled look. He dropped the half-smoked
      cigarette and placed his heel upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite natural--what! Suppose people feel like that.
      Hallo,--they have won the first set."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then his voicelessness seemed to grow more profound. He
      sat without a movement through the whole of the second set,
      a veritable William the Silent, the strong and silent
      man--if a girl chose to think of him in that sort of way.
      Strong and silent and laconic, with more understanding
      behind those glasses than the world knew of? She felt that
      she was getting her picture of him, and the picture was a
      little mysterious. She wanted to hear about him, what he
      was and what he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Biddulphs won the second set, but just before victory
      declared itself Fream rose on his long legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell them I'm going to get a table for tea. You and your
      sister and Biddulph. Not those--others. My tea--you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went striding away towards the club-house with that
      queer, constrained, mechanical walk of his.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "O, Clare; Mr. Fream wants us to have tea with him. He has
      gone to get a table."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare gave her younger sister a look that was surprised and
      intent and calculating.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wants us to have tea with him. O, very well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare had a funny look. She went across to her husband who
      had left his sweater, scarf and jacket on a green seat on
      the other side of the court. The Ryders, a little heated,
      and on the edge of a squabble, were disappearing towards
      the club-house. The husband had been criticizing the wife's
      lobs--"You don't get down to 'em properly; you play 'em
      with too stiff an arm. Biddulph was killing 'em." There
      were lengthy arguments between the Ryders whenever they
      lost a match.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fream has asked Mary to ask us to tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled suggestively at her husband. She saw his blue
      eyes grow more round in his hot and shiny face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove! Not really--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has gone off to get a table."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove!" said Biddulph again, and pulled his sweater over
      his head, and emerged looking more ruffled and astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bit dramatic--what! I say--old thing--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a funny devil--you know. I suppose it's--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife's serenity waited upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--I don't know--funny--awful boiled shirt. Must have
      brains--though! Pots of money; made it himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he is rather--interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Interesting! Good lord! Well--I suppose women look at
      things differently. You don't mean to say that you think he
      has developed a sudden pash?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her glance said: "Don't be so crude, my child," but she
      smiled, chin up, head slightly on one side. A wise woman
      allows for man to rediscover the things that she has
      discovered for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hardly. See what you think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "See!" said her husband. "Why--you never see anything on
      Fream's face. It's as flat as a wall. Personally I don't
      believe there is anything to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder," said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had tea on the terrace. Mr. Percival Fream had secured
      a table for four in a shady corner under one of the
      red-brick arches, a much-coveted corner. The steward had
      pocketed a ten-shilling note and prepared a polite lie for
      the other people who should have had the table. Fream's
      eyes had a bright and glassy look, and his long body seemed
      slightly less rigid. Would Mrs. Biddulph pour out for them?
      Good. He drew back Mary's chair for her, and finding
      himself both seated and voiceless, he began pushing dishes
      jerkily at his guests. There was only one sort of jam, and
      the lack of any other sort of jam stimulated him into
      breaking silence. He called up their waitress. "This yellow
      stuff. Do you never have anything else?"--"Sorry, sir, we
      have nothing but apricot." Fream apologized for the "club,"
      and his apology was wafted towards Mary. He said that the
      next time they had tea with him he would bring his own jam,
      real jam, and in six different varieties. It was a joke, or
      the Biddulphs accepted it as a joke. His guests laughed.
      Laughter eased things a little. It was Leslie who said:
      "Like you--I prefer my stuff red, old chap." His wife
      suppressed an inclination to raise her eyebrows. Her
      husband had called Mr. Fream "old chap." After all, the
      world was very human, like her Leslie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Cinderella had nothing to complain of. Posed on
      this spacious terrace, and wearing a smart frock, she
      looked at the world of the Hills, and found it good. Here
      was the atmosphere that she dreamed of, green lawns and
      pleasant woods, a stage for people who led pleasant lives.
      She appreciated the quiet sumptuousness of the scene--yes,
      she revelled in it. The butter was spread on fairy bread.
      She looked at all those cars parked along the avenue, at
      the well-dressed women and the girls in their simple tennis
      frocks, at the men who looked as though they had parts to
      play in the great adventure. There was money here and taste
      and ease and no soiling of hands, and no paltry
      contrivings. Moreover, to the two men at her table she was
      obviously a pretty thing, though she suspected that a man
      of Fream's largeness asked for more than prettiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the point where Fream was offering them cigarettes
      Biddulph lapsed like the unseeing male that he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll have a knock up, Mary; make up a four."
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not want to play, and Clare understood her
      sister's disinclination, but closing the lid on Leslie was
      at times like suppressing an amiable jack-in-the-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's so hot, and I'm afraid I'm lazy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, nonsense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I would much rather watch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can't allow it, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare blew a little cloud of smoke at her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are too energetic. Like Mary--I am going to sit out
      and watch. Get up a man's four."
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion germinated. If you cannot persuade a pretty
      girl to play with you, you can show off your own play
      before her in a virile game with three other men who are
      just nicely your inferiors. Biddulph was what is called "a
      pretty player." He was watched by Mary--but with less
      interest than he deserved, for when the imperceptible
      fruits of a potential conquest are lying in a woman's lap
      she must be allowed to consider their bloom and their
      ripeness. Fream was sitting beside her. Clare had drifted
      away, ostensibly to fix up a four for the afternoon on
      Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never was much good at games."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary understood that he wanted to talk, and perhaps to talk
      about himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor am I."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glancing at him she had an impression of strained
      solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keener on my job, you know. Always was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well,--I suppose a man ought to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More results. Though--mind you--I like my own sort of
      play--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. It need not be hitting a ball--need it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was watching the game for the moment, and he looked at
      her intently as a man might look at a financial page in his
      morning paper, or at a rare print, or a horse, or at the
      shadows under a beech tree. His glance seemed to grope. It
      was both shrewd and perplexed and troubled. It suggested
      that he was out of his element, as much so as a coalheaver
      posed in front of the Mona Lisa. He mistrusted himself in
      this particular situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad you feel like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She coloured very slightly, and he went on, jerking out the
      words with a kind of spasmodic abruptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most women--these days--think a man--silly ass--unless he
      can hit a ball or something. Hit it well--you know. Got to
      be able to follow up your service--and volley. Think more
      about that than their business. Prefer something more
      solid--personally."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you are right," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there this advance towards a possible intimacy halted
      for the day, and Mary returned to "Caradoc" in the Biddulph
      car and was somewhat silent during the Biddulph dinner.
      Later, alone for twenty minutes with her sister in a corner
      of the drawing-room, she regarded the sunset with eyes that
      asked questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does Mr. Fream do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare had expected some such question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Financial expert--runs companies--and all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Finance was Einstein to Mary save in its personal
      significances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He seems very keen on his work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he is pretty good at it. I suppose he is the richest
      thing in Weyfleet. Married before. Divorced his wife. They
      did not get on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary's eyes were sympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather sad.--Men are such lonely creatures."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And difficult--sometimes," said her sister, with a feeling
      that she had a duty to Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--I suppose so."
    </p>
    <p>
      But her tone was cheerful; she was looking at a richly
      coloured sky. To a woman the "difficulty" of a man who is
      inclined to admire her may not seem so very insuperable.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      3
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "Hill House" was the only old building in the Hills, and
      Percival Fream lived in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Built somewhere about the end of the eighteenth century,
      its grey façade looked across a terrace towards a piece of
      parkland that still held the barbarians at a distance. The
      house had long windows, a balustraded parapet, and an Ionic
      portico jutting out with unconvincing shallowness over its
      big central doorway. There were those who compared the
      rather expressionless flatness of the house to its owner's
      face, but like Fream it had a grey "presence," a
      constrained dignity. In old Weyfleet it had been spoken of
      always as the "House," just as its owner was referred to as
      Mr. Fream, or perhaps as Mr. Percival Fream. No one ever
      "Percied" him. An irreverent person had referred to him on
      a pantomimic occasion as "Pallid, pontifical Percy," but
      affectionate diminutives were not thrown in his face. He
      was Mr. Fream of Hill House. "Sir Percival--some day--my
      dear," was a prophecy thrown out by Clare Biddulph, and a
      hint that somebody might yet be Lady Fream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fream drove his car up the drive and brought it to rest
      outside the portico. A chauffeur was waiting. He opened the
      door, and his master got out. The man took Fream's place at
      the wheel, closed the door gently, and turned the car on
      the gravel. Nothing was said. A like muteness met Fream in
      the hall. Jessup, his man, standing there like a lay figure
      which uttered no sound unless a string was pulled, took
      Fream's hat and gloves and sank away into the prevailing
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This silence was the most noticeable of the house's
      qualities. It seemed to fall like a curtain when Fream had
      passed between the pillars of the portico, a voiceless
      silence, suggesting--not peace, but rather--an unhappy
      dumbness. As a rule Fream did not notice the silence, for
      it was a part of himself, but on this June evening he
      seemed to question the inarticulate muteness of the house.
      He paused in the hall, looking about him somewhat
      aimlessly, as though he had mislaid his self and had
      suddenly remembered its existence. A little tremor passed
      over his face. He took off his glasses and polished them
      with the corner of a blue silk handkerchief. He looked a
      lonely figure in the great dark space of the hall. It was
      panelled in oak, and the portico darkened its two long
      windows, turning the brown of the walls and of the parquet
      floor to a subdued blackness. It was full of furniture,
      beautiful pieces, armoirs, Jacobean cupboards, cabinets on
      legs, clocks, tables. They were possessions. They had been
      bought at high prices by a man who had tried to understand
      them, and had not been able to get nearer to them than the
      appreciation of what they had cost him. Furniture can be
      misunderstood as well as misplaced. These pieces of oak
      seemed to share in the house's silence. They stood there
      mute and dark and shadowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fream replaced his glasses. It had occurred to him before
      that the hall needed more light, and on this evening there
      was a part of him that resented the darkness. "That damned
      portico!" It had an imposing appearance, and in Fream's
      world imposing appearances were of supreme importance. But
      what if appearances kept out too much light?
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened a door and entered the library. Yes, this was a
      cheerful room, and he stood by one of the western windows
      with the Turkey carpet spreading its blues and reds behind
      him. He stroked his right eyebrow with the tip of his right
      forefinger, a trick of his when he had a problem to solve
      or a decision to consider. Yes, he could have the lead roof
      of the portico replaced with glass. The alteration would
      lessen much of the darkness. Light was good, and so were
      other lightnesses. By George, what a pretty neck Biddulph's
      sister-in-law had, that little triangle of soft white skin
      above the collar of her dress, with the curves of neck and
      shoulders bounding it! And above it the soft black wreath
      of her bobbed hair. Yet, how absurd that those inches of
      white skin should be so disturbing! And yet that was but a
      part of her that had disturbed him. His interests had lived
      celibate for years, and now of a sudden he had found
      himself conscious of the provocations of this pretty
      creature. It was as though his thoughts had fallen to the
      rush of male feelings after years of concentration upon
      other figures. Yes--a figure, curves, swelling softnesses,
      arms, the glint of light in brown eyes, the arch of an
      eyebrow, the shadow of a hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered that he had felt very bored when driving down
      to the Hills Club. His financial world was very dull for
      the moment. He sat on a window-sill, with his back to the
      open window, and lit a cigarette. This room was full of
      possessions, packed with them like a spoilt child's
      nursery, books, thousands of books which he had never read
      and would never read. A wireless cabinet--a sumptuous
      affair--stood in one corner, and a three-hundred-guinea
      pianola occupied the space between the windows. A
      gramophone stood open with a record on the wheel, and he
      crossed the room and pressed the lever, and stood listening
      to a sentimental waltz. He had tried that record after
      lunch, and had thought it a poor thing, but now the effect
      was different.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took rather a long time dressing for dinner. Jessup had
      laid out the clothes in the little blue and white
      dressing-room. His master was always buying clothes; there
      were two dozen or so coats hanging on the hangers in the
      patent wardrobe; three different trouser presses saw to it
      that the creases were as they should be. Jessup calculated
      that Mr. Fream's shirts must be legion. Boxes were always
      arriving from Melody's in New Bond Street, boxes full of
      silk pyjamas, ties, socks, collars, shirts, and Jessup had
      his pickings. Three differently coloured dressing-gowns
      hung on the pegs fastened to the white door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Fream put on a ready-made black tie, for the fact was
      that he could not complete a hand-made bow with any
      niceness, and he would not confess to the failing to
      Jessup. A ready-made tie saved time. That was his
      justification. He tucked a white silk handkerchief up his
      sleeve and went down to dinner. The walls of the staircase
      were lined with prints that would have kept a collector
      dawdling on the stairs for twenty minutes. Fream knew the
      names of them, and on the back of each print was scribbled
      the price that he had paid for it--but he had had them
      framed in polished oak. And very rarely did he look at
      them, save with a vague and empty glance that included them
      among his possessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down at one end of the Georgian mahogany table. It
      was some four yards long, and the polished surface of it
      stretched away from him like one of those formal
      water-tanks that the garden artists impose upon their
      patrons. A little gathering of silver and Sheffield plate
      and glass kept Fream company at the extreme end of the
      table. A silver rose-bowl full of red and white roses
      occupied the centre. Jessup stood behind his master's
      chair, between it and the Sheraton sideboard. The walls of
      the room were panelled, and painted white, with the
      mouldings powder blue. A Romney, two Kuyps, a Reynolds, and
      two flower-pieces by Baptiste hung on them. The carpet was
      Chinese; the chairs Sheraton. A china cabinet full of
      Chelsea and Worcester ware stood between the two long
      windows. Through the windows Fream could see the evening
      sunlight upon the old trees in the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessup, mute and efficient, dealt with plates and dishes
      and decanters. It struck him that his master had a better
      appetite than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roses smell nice, Jessup."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very nice, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      That roses should emit a perfume was not a surprising
      phenomenon, but that Mr. Fream should make a remark upon
      their perfume caused Jessup to experience mild surprise.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      In the library Fream unlocked his cigar cabinet and chose a
      cigar. He lit it, walked to the window, and stood looking
      at the formal garden and the park. A dancing
      faun,--joyously exultant upon a pedestal,--faced the
      setting sun. The foliage of the trees had a tinge of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much or how little he saw had no part in his decision,
      for to some men all that is possessed is nothing, and that
      which is not possessed but desired is the one thing that
      appears desirable. He sat down at his big desk, took a
      sheet of paper from a drawer, and remained motionless for a
      while with the hand that held the pen resting on the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he wrote:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      DEAR MRS. BIDDULPH,--If you are not booked for anything
      will you and your husband and Miss Viner dine with me
      to-morrow night at eight? I expect you will be playing
      tennis late, so tell your husband not to change. No
      formalities. Or he can bring his things in the car and
      change here if he wishes to.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align:right;">
      Sincerely yours,            <br>
      <br>
      PERCIVAL FREAM.
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He considered the letter before placing it in an envelope
      and ringing the bell attached to his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, Jessup, get Barter to take this letter down to Mrs.
      Biddulph's at 'Caradoc' in Oaks Road, and to wait for an
      answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way--dinner may be for four to-morrow. It must be
      the best that Mrs. Cox can do. Tell her so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter went by Fream's chauffeur, and in half an hour
      he was back with the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delighted--"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Three tiers of stone steps led up to the portico of Hill
      House, and as Mary climbed them her knees felt smooth under
      the skirt of her black frock. Delicious sense of
      smoothness! She stood at gaze a moment, forgetful of the
      other two, looking back and down over the park with its old
      trees spaced upon the evening grass. The slanting sunlight
      touched everything and smoothed it, and even the shadows
      looked sleek and gracious, like soft eyes--meditative and
      gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fream met them in the hall, appearing in a doorway like an
      automaton that had been set in motion by the sound of their
      voices. Jessup stood to take wraps and coats. There was a
      moment's chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good of you to come--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we wanted to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I took you at your word, Fream--about changing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right."
    </p>
    <p>
      The brown gloom of the hall was flecked with gold. Its cool
      loftiness seemed to offer a spacious entry to Mary Viner's
      dreams. She stood looking about her, absorbing the quick
      impressions of coolness and largeness and of silence, with
      the sunlit park lying behind her, and all the discreet
      mystery of the house yet to be discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fream was speaking to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you will like my house."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up quickly into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's lovely, so cool and restful."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was given a little, abrupt nod, and a fleeting gleam of
      his glasses. His self-consciousness, exaggerated by the
      occasion, stood up stiffly, while the man in him tried to
      unbend. Yet, from that very moment she knew that she was
      the live flame, and the others mere accompanying shadows,
      and that the very silence of the house and its owner was
      spread out at her feet like a Raleigh's cloak. She was
      conscious of a tremor of excitement. She felt enlarged,
      smoothed out, raised to a new dignity. Her self-confidence
      caught the rebound of her quickened vitality. She felt at
      ease, able to talk securely, and to fit herself into this
      comfortable corner. Without realizing it she had become
      more vivid to herself and to others; a sudden bloom came to
      her; her femininity exhaled a richer perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddulph was talking. He always made a cheerful, social
      noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say--your oak--Fream. Priceless--what! My wife will be
      wanting to burgle the place--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That cupboard--I must stroke it."
    </p>
    <p>
      They drifted pleasantly into the drawing-room. The others
      might chatter, but Mary floated, and the man of silence
      moved long legged beside her. He seemed to hover like an
      awkward bird, but to her he was supremely interesting,
      surrounded by the aura of his material significance. She
      liked his stiffness and his silence; she thought that there
      was something Spanish and pale and intense about him; he
      was her reaction, the stately couch, the black velvet
      curtain--after that hay-cock and the smell of fustian. Her
      inclination was ready to acclaim the grandee, the man of
      exciting reservations and of power. She was a woman, and
      for a woman he could smooth things out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessup was there with a tray of cocktails, some
      amber-coloured stuff in little tapering glasses. She took
      her glass and her drink; the stuff went blandly down the
      velvet of her throat; she sat on a brocaded sofa.
      Impressions came to her quickly, of the long white room
      with its cerise-coloured carpet, and its air of lightness
      and of space, and of the gilded but sunny extravagance of
      its old French furniture. She had an impression of
      richness, of Clare poised on an amber-seated fauteuil, of
      Leslie radiantly absorbing cocktail, of Fream standing
      stiffly with a glass in a wooden hand and looking down at
      her with round, glazed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was conscious of a triumphant tingling of her senses.
      His glance dropped slightly. It investigated, and was
      captured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say--Fream, this is a jolly good drink. Would it be rude
      to ask--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Fream came out of a set stare, and from a consideration of
      his preference for curves in contrast to the prevailing
      modern flatness. He could see no charm in an angular chunk
      of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't know--I'm sure. Jessup makes them. He's rather good
      at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dinner is served, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her impressions continued. The Hill House dining-room
      conquered her with its air of distinction. Her soul felt as
      smooth as the polished table. What silver and glass! And
      the food! Exquisite sensations! And he did not give them
      champagne; champagne was so obvious. She put her lips to a
      very beautiful and soft red wine, and wondered what the
      sauce with the fish was made of. They were using only a
      third of the table. She sat on Fream's left, with the
      Biddulphs opposite her, and Leslie's face shone like a
      cherub's. "Scrumptious" it said--"scrumptious. And why
      not?" And she agreed with Leslie's face, and admired her
      sister's deliberate and calm feeding. You could not get
      Clare to betray the greedy child that lives in every
      healthy person. Fream said very little. His queer,
      expressionless, but polite stare came to her very often,
      and lingered, and managed to suggest a live smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roast duck and new peas! She purred. The wine warmed her.
      Through the window she could see the dancing faun exulting
      on his pedestal. It seemed to her that Fream grew more
      Spanish and mysterious and pale and restrainedly intense.
      She rather liked his pallor; it had ceased to be chalk and
      had become marble, Parian marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddulph made social noises. He told a funny tale or two.
      They laughed. Mary laughed. She had the impression of the
      pale man inhaling her laughter and drinking it in. O, yes,
      she enjoyed things; it was very obvious that her senses
      could draw quick breaths and flush and struggle and quiver.
      She would know how to spend money, and to enjoy it; he felt
      her youth like a tremor down his straight, stiff spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fream's little party was proving a success. Two bottles of
      exquisite red wine between the four of them, port,--and
      then liqueurs. A great mellowness descended; they were
      pleased with each other. Delightful people--all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fream and Biddulph, lingering for five minutes over coffee
      and cigars, felt warm and brotherly. Even Fream's pallor
      had decreased; the ice had thawed; in handing Biddulph the
      cigar box he had laid a large white hand on Leslie's
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charming girl your sister-in-law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather. And as good as she is charming, old chap."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women heard laughter as the men came across the
      hall to the drawing-room, and the laughter was Leslie's.
      Really--Fream had quite a nice, dry wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--I say--you two, don't be shocked--but Fream--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by Fream asking permission for their
      cigars to be kept alight, and though his first and proper
      glance was given to Clare, it was the second glance that
      mattered. He stood looking down at Mary on the brocaded
      sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure you don't mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddulph, momentarily interrupted, gushed forth again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be shocked. I'm going to see it. Fream has been
      telling me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare's eyes were on her husband. He had dined just a
      little too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What,--old thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fream has a new bath, a super-bath--I say, let's all go--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Fream, very erect, and properly presiding over the dignity
      of the occasion, kept a hand--so to speak--on the handle of
      Leslie's humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An idea of my own.--All marble--you know. Of course--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare laughed. The best way to deal with a delicate problem
      may be to laugh at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? I'd love to see it--"
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the four of them, on that first social and historic
      occasion, went upstairs to be shown Mr. Percival Fream's
      new bathroom. He had taken a room, and had it marbled, and
      the bath, a marble cistern, lay sunk in the raised floor.
      Every sort of device had been installed for providing every
      sort of spray and douche. The curtains were of old rose,
      and the shades over the lamps of the same colour. Fream
      switched on the lights, and the whiteness of the room
      became tinted like the petal of a wild rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfect," said Biddulph's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the poshest thing I've ever seen, old chap. Like a
      picture by one of those Classic fellows, Alma Tadema or
      Leighton. You only want--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Fream's sudden hand switched off the lights, dimming
      the unconventional friendliness of the adventure. Clare's
      voice trailed itself across a silence that needed linking
      up. She slipped an arm under Mary's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, quite charming."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was annoyed with Leslie. A bathroom might be a thing of
      beauty, but why blunder in and suggest the nude, especially
      feminine nudity? The broad staircase was descended with
      gravity, Fream bringing up the rear. He was examining the
      ash on his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose we try the library. Excuse me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His stiffness retrieved the dignity of a situation that had
      been shaken by the cheery Sun in Taurus. Would they care
      for any music? He could switch on the wireless, or start
      the gramophone, or give them the latest thing on the
      pianola? Had Miss Viner ever tried a pianola? No?
      Well,--why not now? It was supremely easy. He would show
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Mary and her grandee sat solemnly on the cushioned
      bench that was like an organist's seat, and produced music
      together, and Clare watched over her husband, and pointed
      the toe of an admonishing shoe at him.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The first stars, looking in through the kitchen window at
      "Doomsday," hung as silver points in the criss-cross of the
      casements, and fraternised with the flame of a shaded
      candle. A small fire reddened the bars of the new range. In
      the centre of the brick floor a big galvanised bath stood
      in a circle of wetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze had stepped out of it. He was towelling himself,
      standing very erect with hollowed loins, his skin showing
      very white save where the work of the day exposed it to the
      sun. His forearms, neck, head, and the V of the chest where
      his shirt would lie unbuttoned were brown as scorched
      grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pair of pyjamas lay on one kitchen chair; his clothes on
      another. He had had a hard day, though all days were hard,
      and as he flicked the towel over the back of a chair and
      reached for his sleeping-suit his face came nearer to the
      light of the candle. It was the face of a man who was tired
      both in spirit and body, and to whom sleep would mean a
      little period of forgetfulness, a short truce between
      himself and nature. He had slipped on the jacket, and had
      the trousers in his hand when some sound breaking in on him
      out of the night's silence caused him to pause. He knew
      every sound that could come to him from the little world
      lying about his house, more especially such rare sounds as
      the night gave, the wind in the chimney, a branch tapping a
      window, a horse pulling grass close to a hedge or wall, the
      squeakings and screams and twitterings of the creatures of
      the night. A farmer has to be familiar with such sounds; he
      must be able to detect a note of pain in a beast's lowings,
      or restlessness in the stable. And Furze listened. The
      silence was profound, but his countryman's ear detected
      something that was disturbing. He had heard a sound of
      crackling as of the brittle sticks of an old faggot being
      broken, and now there was another sound, very faint but
      familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped out of the jacket, and put on breeches, shirt
      and shoes. Bobbo would have given tongue long ago; the new
      dog--Jim--was young and not much use as yet. "No peace for
      the wicked--and for farmers," was his thought, but he went
      patiently out into the darkness by the back door leading
      into the vegetable garden. He stood very still,--listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy breathing--and the sounds of big beasts feeding! Yes,
      there was no doubt about it, and a little flame of anger
      was lit in his brain. A thistle-spud was leaning against
      the wall. His hand touched and grasped it. He went softly
      past the well-house, and in the tangle of the garden's
      gloom he could make out the vague bulk of two or three
      cows. They must have broken through two hedges and got in
      among his young winter greens.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Doll," he thought; "what's come to the beast? The
      quietest of the lot."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went forward, conscious of a fierce restraint. He wanted
      to be angry; his tired brain and body rebelled against this
      last wanton labour, but a man has to keep his temper with
      the beasts of the field. He called softly to the
      cows--"Come then--coop-coop.--Doll, come then you
      mischievous girls." But the beasts were guilty and scared;
      they blundered away from him, trampling, and breathing
      heavily. He shut his mouth hard. He knew that he would have
      a devil of a job getting them out of the garden, and that
      if he lost his temper the game would be more serious. He
      searched for and found the gap in the broken hedge. The
      beasts must have come through from the "Gore," breaking the
      hedge on that side of the lane. There was a gate at the
      corner near the pond. He went and opened it. He fetched and
      lit a lantern. He began the game of shepherding the animals
      out from among the garden crops and bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an exasperating amusement. He persuaded two of them
      out into the lane, but the last of the three led him a
      devil's dance. He got her cornered at last. He worked her
      down the hedge to the open gate, and there she frisked and
      tried to cut away. He lost his temper, dashed to cut her
      off, and struck her with the spud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn you."
    </p>
    <p>
      After that he had to chase a mad creature and two tricksy
      followers up the lane. He was afraid that they would get
      out into the Melhurst road, but he managed to slip past
      them and to turn them back. Luckily for him one of the
      three broke back through the gap in the hedge into the
      "Gore," but he had to go and hunt out a hurdle and a beetle
      and set the hurdle up in the broken hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sweating. He stripped again in the kitchen, rubbed
      himself down, put on his pyjamas, and taking the candle,
      went up to his room. He felt angry and discouraged. He was
      sorry that he had struck Doll, for roughness with beasts
      was against nature and his traditions, and yet there was a
      part of him that was not sorry. A man must let out
      sometimes when he is over-tired or pushed beyond the limits
      of his patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      But things had gone so wrong lately, ever since love had
      failed him, and Bobbo had died. There was no reason for
      this wrongness; it seemed to be just the cussedness of
      circumstances, and yet he was used to the eternal
      cussedness of the things that man strives to control. To
      men who live on and by the soil it is the most familiar of
      experiences, and as old as Job. Cursing God did not help
      one. Nothing helped but patience and knowledge, and the
      doggedness of footsteps treading the same purposeful road.
      Character? O,--yes, plenty of character was needed on a
      farm, and he blew out the light and lay down in his bed.
      But there was no relaxation of his body. He felt all strung
      up and restless, and now that his muscles had ceased to
      contract, his thoughts took on a troublesome activity. All
      the worries and the disharmonies of the day, and of many
      previous days, came and stood about his bed. Confound them!
      He felt most damnable wide-awake. Why was it? He had had
      wagonloads of worries in the past five years, but always he
      had felt himself the driver of the cart, and able to tip it
      when he pleased. Nothing had ever kept him from
      sleeping,--but now he was not sleeping so well. There were
      thorns in the bed, lonelinesses, yearnings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passion denied,--tenderness balked? O, no doubt, for he
      would lie and think of her, and try to be patient. After
      fluttering her wings she would come back. His dear bedmate
      and fellow-worker, breathing quietly beside him after
      moments of fulfilled desire. The quiet breathing of a mate,
      the soft touch of her limbs, the comforting warmth of her!
      All this would give him courage and constancy; in touching
      her body he would be like Antaeus touching the earth.
      Patience,--loyalty! But why was it he cared so profoundly,
      as he had never cared before? What was there about her--?
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay and looked at the stars, and her vision paled a
      little. He had not seen her for a month, and there were
      times when her face would grow unaccountably dim,--as
      though she were ceasing to exist, had never existed. That
      dear face! And there were times when she was so vivid to
      him that he would clench his hands and shut his eyes as
      though to hold and confine the vision of her. Her hair was
      just of that blackness. And that wavy, poignant mouth, with
      its wreathing upper lip, and her quick colour, and the way
      her eyes filled with a broken light of splintered brown and
      gold! O,--beloved!
    </p>
    <p>
      But other things vexed him that night. Damn it,--why didn't
      it rain? He wanted rain. His roots needed it,--his grass.
      He had been hoeing the Sea Field all day to make a mulch
      for his mangels. And Will had a poisoned hand. And that
      damned new dog of his had killed two chickens. And he was
      worried about Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Betty's case was the most worrying thing he had. One
      quarter of her udder had become hard. There had been thick
      curds. He had tried massage.

    <p>
      Mamitis was a serious affair, especially the infective
      form. He would have Kelly the vet. over.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, meanwhile, he wanted to go to sleep, and couldn't. The
      breaking of those three cows into the garden had left him
      on an edge of painful wakefulness.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Furze was up at half-past four. He made himself some tea,
      cleared away the bath from the kitchen and went out to see
      what damage had been done in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dawn lay like a grey sheet upon the earth, with a
      pearling of dew, and a silvering of the grass and the
      hedgerows. Not a leaf stirred. The freshness of the dawn
      had the tang of a first kiss, some of its shyness, its
      chilly tremors. The earth smelt sweet. There would be a fog
      at sea, and heat to follow, and as he stood in the
      greyness, wishing that he could change the dew to rain, he
      heard the dolorous complaining of a ship's siren far away
      like the crying of some great beast in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the beauty and the secret stealth of that morning
      seemed to slip a soft hand into his. Was it true that men
      who lived by the soil had no eyes for beauty, and skins so
      tanned and furrowed that they were insensitive to the
      breath of it? He felt soothed, more ready to take the day's
      work calmly, for there is a calmness of the land, the
      steady rhythm of the inevitable. He found that no great
      damage had been done in the garden, less than, in the
      darkness, he had feared, and he brought up another hurdle
      from the yard and closed the gap. He felt that he had his
      peace to make with his beasts, for the peace of the morning
      was upon him. In the "Gore" some of the cows were nosing
      the dew-wet grass, but Doll--the arch offender of the
      previous night, was lying under an old thorn. Furze went up
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well,--Doll, old lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw a mark on one of her red-brown flanks where the edge
      of the thistle-spud had cut the hide. He was sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought not to have done that, Doll."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cow looked at him with liquid eyes. She lay quite
      still, and allowed him to rub her poll, for Furze and his
      beasts trusted each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well,--that's that, old girl. Animals forgive. Or is it
      that they don't remember?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards he went up to the Sea Field and stood there
      looking down at the haze in the valley and at the misty
      woods, and the haste died out of his soul. Why fret? Worry
      kills no weeds nor brings moisture to plants' root-hairs.
      His young mangels were standing up sturdily, their leaves
      all grey with dew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sweat of a man's brow is his dew," he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and looked towards Cinder Town, and his faith in
      the future seemed to return. His love felt tranquillized.
      Surely she would return? Had he not sealed their love with
      his kisses, kisses that she had given back to him with
      ardour. That panic mood of hers would pass. He could
      picture himself being very gentle with her--"There,--there,
      my beloved. I'm strong enough for both of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the house and the work, O--well--he could get help
      for her. They could go into one of the sea-coast towns once
      a week. What was wrong with the rhythm of a country life?
      Nothing that he could see, provided that you had the
      unspoilt ear for it. Was not work inevitable? Did everyone
      want to play these days, and to keep their coats on, and
      their collars dry? He must have faith in her. She would
      come to understand that a woman has work to do, and that no
      shirking of it will bring her ultimate satisfaction. In
      fact he was a little blinded by his own natural sweat; he
      could not understand a healthy girl either disliking work
      or shirking it. After all--Mary was not a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out at sea the ship's siren wailed, but Furze was looking
      into the dewy eyes of the morning. He saw in them and in
      his fields and in his coming labours the eyes and the face
      and the tremblings of his beloved.

    <p>
      Exit June!
    </p>
    <p>
      Though June had died in a blaze of heat more than three
      weeks ago, and if the rain was still denied to the thirsty
      soil, news was more drenching and plentiful. Old Hesketh,
      most upright of men, had to shelter under his umbrella.
      Mary had written to say that she was engaged to be married
      to a Mr. Percival Fream of Hill House, Weyfleet, and that
      the marriage was fixed for the end of September. Mr. Fream
      wished to see her parents. He proposed to drive her down in
      the car for the week-end; he could put up at "The George"
      at Carslake, and no doubt someone in Cinder Town would lend
      the bride-to-be a bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Hesketh was shocked. He had the military mind, and when
      men were ordered to form fours they did it and remained in
      that formation until another order was given them. But
      women--! He sat over the breakfast table, and discussed
      Mary's letter with his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing about Arnold, my dear, not a word."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Charlotte understood the reactionary impulses of human
      nature much better than did her man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all--there was nothing settled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing settled!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked so upset about it that his wife had to go round
      the table and kiss him. He was such an old Newcome. White
      was white and black was black, and a love affair was a love
      affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, doesn't she say that she is very happy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the letter from him, and skimmed it over a second
      time, holding it in both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She says--'Percival is so kind and generous.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hesketh filled a pipe with perturbed fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The other man was that. So far as he was able. Sounds very
      much like shirking, my dear. I wonder if she has written to
      'Doomsday.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Charlotte smiled gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should she? She had told Arnold quite frankly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just six weeks or so ago. He did not regard it as final."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this is, Hesketh."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband fumbled with his matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll feel it. He ought to be told. I shall go and see
      him. He is a good fellow. This other chap, his name--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Percival--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Percival! H'm--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Percival Fream of Hill House. He appears to be very
      well off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Hesketh struck a match with a sound that was like a
      "Damn him."
    </p>
    <p>
      An unpleasant prospect, but old Viner was a Victorian,
      still believing that a back should be stiffened against
      unpleasant duties. He had an old soldier's sense of
      rectitude; Gordon had been one of his heroes; there had
      been an occasion when he had got up and walked out of a
      theatre with a tall hat held severely against his chest. He
      advanced upon a duty as he would have advanced upon a
      hostile battery, very stiff in the back, convinced that to
      shirk a crisis was the unforgivable sin. He put on his old
      Panama hat, and took his ash stick from the umbrella stand,
      and marched off down the cinder road, leaving two women
      behind him. Cousin Nelly had to be told, and she had
      something to say on the matter. She--too--was sorry for
      Furze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus--her father set out at the very moment when Mary was
      curled up on a sofa at "Caradoc," with Leslie Biddulph's
      copy of <i>The Times</i> to keep her company. "London
      Fashions." A very excellent article it was. It thrilled
      her. "Coral, lavender, fawn, and ashes of roses tissues and
      chiffon make light cloaks. Many wraps are bordered with
      summer fur, the favourite being fox dyed beige or pink, or
      with chiffon.--Neck openings are lower than they
      were.--Some of the simple dance frocks of bright flower
      coloured chiffons have a wide flat applique girdle of roses
      or petals.--There are a few black dresses relieved in
      various ways--black chiffon and flesh chiffon, black net
      and steel lace--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hesketh found nobody about the house. It was to be
      supposed that Furze was up the fields, but carrying his
      sense of duty with them into the farmyard the captain found
      Blossom's boy holding a saddle-horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Furze at home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In t'cow-lodge."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Viner paused in the doorway of the cow-house. The smell
      of the byres rose in the summer heat, and flies were ready
      to make you a living halo. After the glare of the yard the
      interior of the cow-house had a pleasant gloom, with the
      clean straw the colour of amber below the blue of the roof
      shadows. Little shafts of sunlight speared in between the
      sun-shrunken weather-boarding, and painted blurs of light
      upon the walls, and upon the mangers and the straw. There
      were only two cows in the house, roped to the rings. Furze
      and Will Blossom were standing by the cows, while a third
      man, Kelly the vet. examined the udders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mamitis--all right. Afraid so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze was in the shadow, and it seemed to old Viner that
      there was a streak of gloom across his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder how she got infected?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kelly glanced up over a shoulder at Will's bandaged hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does he do any of the milking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. But wait a bit--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did it for you--last Sunday week, ssir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you did, Will. But your hand wasn't bad then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, ssir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyway," said the vet. straightening his back, "here it
      is. Infective form too--I'm afraid. Just these two cows?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you can manage it--keep 'em away from the others. Milk
      'em last. Be careful about disinfecting your hands
      afterwards. Treat their milk with a disinfectant, and get
      rid of it where it won't spread infection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right. What can I do for the udders?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--inject chinosol twice a day, night and morning. And
      keep an eye on the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      The three men turned. Their feet and legs were in a pool of
      sunlight, their bodies in the shadow. They saw Captain
      Hesketh standing there, prodding the straw with his stick.
      He looked at Furze, and in the shadowiness of the cow-house
      Furze's eyes seemed sunk in the brown of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning. Trouble--I'm afraid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, trouble," said the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was there for him in the cool gloom of the cow-house,
      nor was he conscious of that other trouble in old Viner's
      eyes. Sufficient unto the moment was the evil thereof. His
      face had a dark thoughtfulness. He came out into the
      sunlight, and looked back at the straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be free in a minute, sir.--Had we better clean all
      this, Mr. Kelly, and burn it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Might be as well. Anywhere where I can wash my hands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take you in."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled round at Captain Viner, but the smile was a tired
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go in, sir, won't you? Or have a look at the garden. It's
      rather burnt up--I'm afraid. I haven't much time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Viner, pottering off on those long legs of his into
      Mrs. Damaris' sunk garden, felt himself going into action
      at an unpropitious moment. He was sorry for Furze, more
      sorry than he had expected to be. The lad's cows were sick.
      Yes, life was like that; troubles came to you tied up in a
      bunch. But there was a wrongness about the situation.
      Assuredly so. If Mary had cared--Yes, a warm-hearted girl
      ought to care--And marrying this other fellow, a
      Percival--! Old Viner, discovering a young thistle spearing
      up in one of the beds, attacked it with the point of his
      stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry to keep you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze had come down into the garden where the plantains
      were the only green things in the dried-up grass. The
      flowers of June were over, spread for a lover's occasion,
      and now gone to seed. Old Viner, feeling that if you had to
      fire bad news at a man it was best done quickly, left the
      uprooted thistle to wilt on the caked soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have had a letter from my daughter, my dear fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary is coming back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. She writes to say that she is going to be married. I
      thought you ought to be told. I'm sorry about it."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      2
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hesketh returned to "Green Shutters" looking hot
      and unhappy. Questioned by his wife as to how Furze had
      taken the news, he had air of a man with nothing to
      communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what did Arnold say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing at all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He asked who the man was. Took the shot standing, my dear.
      I'm sorry about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So am I," said his wife; "poor Arnold. But Mary is not
      made for that life. I think it is better as it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Viner betrayed a sudden and unusual peevishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--no doubt. But there are different ways of doing
      things, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze had said nothing,--for there was nothing to be said
      by a man who had spent five silent years in recovering a
      derelict farm. Old Viner had gone off rather hurriedly. He
      had pressed Furze's brown hand with his thin fingers. "I'm
      sorry, my dear fellow. Hasn't happened as I wished it. Hope
      it won't make any difference between us--personally." And
      feeling a curious numbness within him Furze had taken a hoe
      and gone up to the Sea Field where the mangels stood out in
      green tufts against the baked and cloddy soil. He wanted to
      be alone, completely and utterly alone, to face the sudden
      realization of a new loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hoed a row, working mechanically, a solitary figure
      under a cloudless sky, but the work irked him. The soil
      seemed to have lost its virtue; it was dusty and caked and
      lifeless; and presently he paused, and leaning on his hoe,
      looked out over the landscape. The woods were a heavy
      green. He could see a strip of hazy grey sea in the
      distance. The parched fields seemed to crackle in the
      sunlight, and the yellowing meadows looked sore and
      starved. Five years of sweat--and then--this!
    </p>
    <p>
      But what of it? Was he going to whimper because a girl had
      gone elsewhere for her kisses, and because his kisses were
      like those fields, poor and distressed? O, damn sentiment,
      and damn the balked years in him. What was it--after all?
      He had seen a boar refused by the sow turn and lash at the
      pig-bound palings. Was he to behave like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      The hands clasped on the top of the hoe's handle supported
      his jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wounded, he did not turn to melancholy. "Doomsday" had
      wrung his strength, but he had laboured and endured. It was
      his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that poor, sensuous, pretty creature, running away from
      life and the sweat of it, hoping to wrap her body up in
      soft tissues! Well,--well! Never to smell of sweat; to be
      perfumed and cool and nicely draped. Some fellow with
      money, some city merchant--?
    </p>
    <p>
      But he cared. The smart in him was savage, and he went on
      with his hoeing, jabbing at the caked soil, feeling the sun
      hot on his neck and back. The pain was fierce, and his
      labour was like the pain. Damn these clods! Why didn't it
      rain?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was sweat in his eyes, or was it something else? He
      paused savagely, and looked up at the cool shade under the
      great green cliffs of Beech Ho. Shade,--ease, no sweating
      in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      But--by God--that was the bitterness of it. She had not
      only humiliated him; she had humiliated his job. She had
      taken his life's work and thrown it back at him like some
      green, pulpy, rank-smelling cabbage. She had put her pretty
      feet upon the few little flowers he had tried to grow for
      her. She had let him spend that money. And next winter
      those oaks in Gore Wood would have to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary," he thought, "you might have left me my pride."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percival Fream brought his royal blue monster of a car
      to rest outside the gate of "Green Shutters." Beside him in
      a little cherry-coloured hat and a biscuit-coloured coat
      Mary smiled, for smiles were necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here we are. The white gate."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sorry to have to feel ashamed of Cinder Town, both
      sorry and glad, for provided that her grandee was not too
      much ashamed of it, her own realization of its meanness did
      not matter. She was a little in awe of Fream, and such a
      long way from understanding him that she had to set her own
      moods to the rhythm of his silences. She believed it to be
      the silence of strength; it was mysterious, and quite as
      exciting in its way as the windows of a luxury shop with
      the shutters up on a Sunday. On the way down she had tried
      to prepare him for Cinder Town. She had talked about the
      meanness of the War Office. Pensions were so ungraciously
      inadequate, and after all those Indian frontier campaigns
      in which Captain Viner had taken part! She had said--"I am
      very proud of my Daddy," and Fream, diverting a momentary
      glance from the road along which they had been travelling
      at some forty miles an hour, had given her a faint, and
      glassy smile. "Of course you are." To him she was also a
      luxury shop with the blinds down. He was not a little
      nervous about raising them, or perhaps as to his ability to
      raise them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I'll turn her,--before we get out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you? O,--there's Daddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      She waved a hand. She had had glimpses of people in gardens
      and at windows, of Colonel Sykes' monocle grimly attentive,
      and of the melancholy Coode gently disappearing. Her father
      did not respond to the wave of her hand. He stood there
      rather stiffly in the middle of the weedy little path, an
      affectionately rigid figure with eyes of attention. So this
      was the man who was to marry his daughter, and this was his
      car! It was a very big car, and its brightness made old
      Viner feel moved to blink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fream was a bad driver, and the cinder track was very
      narrow. The big car jerked backwards and forwards as he
      tried to work her round, and at the third reverse he hit
      the Vachett's fence with his luggage-grid. Two or three
      palings cracked, and Mary, with hands clasped together,
      emitted a faint "O!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Fream said nothing. He ground his way into bottom gear,
      lugged at the steering-wheel, let his clutch in with a
      bump, and stopped his engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's such a wretched narrow place," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fream said nothing. He looked stiff and white. She
      commented to herself upon his silence, and thought it
      admirable, the silence of self-restraint. But she did wish
      that he had made "Ph&oelig;bus" show his paces a little
      more gracefully. She had christened the blue car
      "Ph&oelig;bus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have to pay for that fence. Much damage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to look, and became aware of the embittered
      Vachett staring carefully at the broken palings. He bent
      forward, and pushing at the fence, made sure that a post
      had not been broken. Mean, meticulous creature!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing much."
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped out before the process of turning the car was
      complete, and went and kissed her father. He patted the
      middle of her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well,--my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you forgiven me, Daddy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come back to him as the child, full of an
      intriguing and irresponsible self-importance, snuggling up
      as women do, and putting a man's courage out of
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hesketh kissed her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So long as you are happy, my dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was reproached and she knew it, but success can bear
      reproaches. Fream was standing in the gateway, and she
      brought the two men together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How d'you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to meet you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands, and seemed to be looking about for
      something else to say to each other, and Mary had to exert
      herself and carry the conversation for both of them. She
      showed less confidence when she met her mother and Cousin
      Nellie, and they were all crowded in that poky little room.
      Fream's head seemed to be within a foot of the ceiling. "O,
      mind the lamp, Val." The old life rushed back at her, and
      got itself tangled up with the new one. She thought of poor
      Arnold sitting there by the window. O, bother one's past
      and its implications! Her eyes showed a sudden wetness, and
      tears blurred the harsh outlines of life. Fream stood
      stiffly aware of her tears; he liked them,--but he did not
      know what to do with them, for when a man has kept his
      emotions in cold storage they may refuse to thaw, or come
      out as so much pulp, tasteless--even to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your room is all ready,--Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was from Cousin Nellie, that most kind and efficient
      soul, who could not help producing the right key at a
      crisis even though her prejudices were arrayed against the
      pretty egoist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--thank you, Nellie. But I am turning you out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a room at the Twists."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And my suit-case."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Nellie who fetched it for her and carried it
      upstairs while Fream and the two old people sat and looked
      at each other through loopholes, and said quite meaningless
      things. Mary closed the door of her little room. What a
      tank it was, hot and stuffy, and yet full of the old
      perfume of vivid emotions. She went to the window, and the
      beeches of "Doomsday" assailed like a huge and distant
      cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--Arnold--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was conscious of terror, a nameless fear. She drew the
      blind half-down, and sat on the bed, staring at her
      suit-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did he know?
    </p>
    <p>
      Supposing he came--? O, she could not see him, she could
      not possibly see him. One of her panic moods arrived. She
      went to the head of the stairs and called.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Daddy--daddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard and came up with eyes that still seemed to be
      avoiding her wet face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Daddy,--he won't come here--will he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Viner shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well,--I told him, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was voiceless, and he turned and went down the stairs
      and she into her room to close the door and sit on the bed
      with her face between her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was afraid. She had divined a possible fear, but not
      the strength of the fear, and it paralysed her. She felt
      that she dared not leave "Green Shutters" or its garden
      until Fream's car should carry her away late on the
      afternoon of Sunday. He had to be in town early on the
      Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; she did not want to see any of these people, the Twists
      or the Perrivales or poor Coode. She wanted to forget them
      all. And she had felt so triumphant! But she found that her
      Winged Victory was a little unsteady on its feet.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The only incident of note that happened up at Carslake was
      that "Ph&oelig;bus" proved too big to be housed in any of
      the "George" stables. A man had to be sent for from a local
      garage to take the monster away and dispose of him for the
      night. Obviously, the "George Inn" should have felt
      humbled, but that was not so, and the Sussex
      odd-man-about-the-yard was coarsely ironical.
    </p>
    <p>
      That short week-end puzzled Fream considerably. Very
      properly he tried to talk "Mary" to old Viner, and was
      surprised to meet in Mary's father an obtuseness, a seeming
      lack of interest. Mary was to be a rich man's wife, secure
      and comfortable, but the old campaigner's eyes remained
      dull. Fream got on better with Mrs. Charlotte, perhaps
      because she did nearly all the talking while he sat there
      like a pale and beglassed Buddha. But Mary was the most
      baffling of the humans, and yet she gave him something that
      was almost a thrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      She chose to sit all that day in the garden at the back of
      "Green Shutters." He was made to stretch his long, stiff,
      awkward body in the only deck-chair, while she occupied an
      old basket-thing dragged out of the house. The "George"
      breakfast had not agreed with him very well; nor had the
      "George" bed. He felt that he had earned exercise, a little
      Arcadian seclusion, a field path and a pretty creature near
      his arm. His! Another possession, and yet not quite
      possessed as yet. He was not a little afraid of his powers
      of possession. He was so rusty, so awkward. At the office
      he always dictated his letters. Had he forgotten how to
      scribble like a boy?
    </p>
    <p>
      "We ought to see something of the country--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was uneasily facetious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look for mushrooms or blackberries--or something."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a mysterious headache, the malaise that is
      completely puzzling to the bachelor-minded man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd much rather sit here with you, Val."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her calling him "Val" brought a smirk to his solemn soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's so restful."
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared to be trying to say something, but the right
      echo would not come. The surface of him had become so flat
      that it could not return an echo.

      For lunch they had blackcurrant pudding, a dream of a
      pudding made by Cousin Nellie. And there was cream with it,
      "Doomsday" cream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary would not touch the cream, poor Arnold's cream. But
      Fream disposed of a good helping, and thought the pudding
      excellent. As a pudding it was not unlike his sensuous
      appreciation of Mary, dark fruit richly juiced, purple hair
      and a soft and creamy body. She would have the flavour of
      fruit, with just a twinge of tartness under the cream and
      the sugar. He accepted a second helping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary had a frightened look. Absurd--to be afraid of a
      cream-jug, though she did not even know that Furze had two
      cows sick, and was having to spend extra money on feed
      because the grass was parched, and that he was worried
      about his "roots." How should she know of such things, or
      even imagine them? But the cream was there, and Fream's
      cream cheese of a face looming possessively on the other
      side of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in a fever to get away. She stroked the head of the
      silver mascot on "Ph&oelig;bus'" radiator where the big
      blue car stood waiting. She climbed in after the family
      kisses, flushed and breathing quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--I'm glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat a little more closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This place makes me sad, Val."
    </p>
    <p>
      He found a smile, and a thin elbow that transmitted a nudge
      of tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it needn't. Take my word for it."

    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, she was to see her lover, for Fream chose to drive
      back through Carslake and strike the London road, and as
      they passed the mouth of the lane where the six pines stood
      upon the green mound, some impulse made Mary look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was standing there, leaning against one of the trees.
      Their eyes met, and into hers a little flicker of fear
      leapt instantly. But Furze's eyes seemed to her quite
      expressionless, two dark circles in a tanned face just
      glooming at her from under the pines.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shivered and drew away into her corner. It was as
      though "Doomsday" itself had looked at her with a fatal and
      tragic meaning.

    <p>
      In August, while Furze was fighting the drought, Mary was
      preparing her trousseau.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage had been postponed until early in October, for
      her grandee had some financial affair in the process of
      flotation, and already she had discovered that when he was
      pursuing the golden hind it was unwise to come between him
      and the pursuit. The discovery did not worry her. She was
      in no hurry. This was no haycock affair, tumultuous and
      poignant. Her great man extended to her a Spanish courtesy,
      and an air of high financial endeavour. She accepted his
      kisses; they could not be called disturbing kisses, and she
      could not quite make up her mind as to their nature. He
      kissed her as though he were taking a tentative nibble at
      strange fruit, not feeling sure of its ripeness or of his
      own capacity to digest it. She added an imagined shyness to
      her conception of his silent strength, and it did not
      displease her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best-dressed woman in Weyfleet; that's the idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      He became articulate for the moment, standing very stiff
      and straight, and holding a new cheque book as a
      self-conscious man holds an overful tea-cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Opened an account for you at the local bank. Need not
      bother your people."
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed him. "Val, you are a dear. But you ought not to
      do this--before we are married." He looked pleased. Where
      was the difference? She was the prettiest thing on the
      Hills, and she was going to be the smartest. Yes, and her
      inclinations were in time with his. Five hundred pounds at
      the bank, and a cheque book, and all sorts of delicious
      possibilities hanging on the point of a pen. How generous
      he was! He had given her the most gorgeous ring, and pearls
      that must have cost him a thousand pounds. She was in
      heaven, but she had the sense to lean upon her sister, for
      she knew that Clare had the magic touch in her finger-tips,
      and that a rose and an orchid are very different flowers.
      There were expeditions to town. Two very serious women gave
      all their attention to that most fascinating of arts. Clare
      selected her sister's wardrobe, and Mary, accepting
      domination, was like an excited child out upon Christmas
      shopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't he generous?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare allowed Fream his generosity, but she was searching
      for the promptings behind it. It did not satisfy her to
      explain it too easily, or to see it in mere amorous
      excitement. Clare knitted her mental brows over the
      phenomenon. She was inclined to reduce Fream's generosity
      to a form of self-expression, perhaps his one and only
      method of self-expression. He was articulate--as a cheque
      book. Hence--she was cautious. She gave her sister little
      shrewd nudges, subtle and persuasive touches, pregnant
      hints.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every man has his particular vanity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure Val is not at all vain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every man. I am not being cynical. Cultivate it. It's your
      business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that sounds so--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit of it. If marriage is worth while, the man is
      worth while. If he wants you to be smart, obviously--be
      smart. Your man is ambitious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--I suppose he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Power--you know. Power--and its expression. You may have
      to express yourself--with things, if you can't write books
      or paint pictures. Fream paints pictures."
    </p>
    <p>
      The brown eyes of Mary questioned her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does he? I didn't know--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His environment, Hill House, motor-cars, bathrooms,
      wine,--you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked thoughtful, too thoughtful, and Clare had to
      penetrate the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite so--bald--as that. He has paid you a very nice
      compliment. He has asked you to help him paint the picture.
      And not a bad game--for a woman to dabble in, with frocks
      for your paints, and flowers, and the way you sit at the
      head of his table, and wear your furs, and walk through the
      lounge of the 'Grand' at Monte Carlo. It's up to you, my
      dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked a little plaintive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely--it means more than that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Don't be a goose. He is very much in love with
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pink room at "Caradoc" was full of the "flowers" that
      Clare had selected; an evening cloak of black chiffon
      velvet with silver fox collar and lined with rose and
      silver brocade; three evening dresses of rose chiffon,
      black georgette, and rose and silver brocade; three day
      dresses, a black satin coat and dress lined rose with
      collar and cuffs of skunk, a flowered ninon of rose, blue,
      gold and black, a black crêpe de chine. There were tennis
      frocks of cream crêpe de chine, and two country coats and
      skirts, and two coat frocks. Also hats, jumpers, lingerie,
      shoes of brocade and of satin and suède. And silk stockings
      of black and grey and flesh colour. So, Fream's future wife
      found herself expressed in clothes, just as he wished one
      of his possessions to express itself. A child among the
      strawberries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grass of Hill House park was as brown as a berry, but
      it had no cattle to feed, and only once to Mary did it
      suggest "Doomsday" and the farm. Her consciousness flicked
      a thought at "poor Arnold," and quickly drew back. Bad
      weather for cows and the milk pail. But how little she
      understood, and how little she knew of the sweat and the
      labour, of the fierce patience, and the tired eyes and the
      set jaw. She had had her little scuffle with poverty, and
      had fled from it. She had shrunk from the soiling of her
      hands with the world's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Arnold!
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not quite forget those eyes of his, and the way
      they had looked at her. But surely she had done the honest
      thing? She had run away from him with no ulterior knowledge
      of grandees and cheque books--and rose-coloured bathrooms.
      All that had arrived later. Could she be blamed for it?
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not go again to Cinder Town; she did not want to
      go; she was afraid of going. She was to be married from
      "Caradoc." She sent her mother a twenty-five pound cheque,
      explaining the gift by saying that Val had insisted on
      advancing her a portion of her dress allowance. "He is so
      generous." It was her father who returned the cheque. "My
      dear, you must not send us money." She was a little hurt
      and distressed, but reminded herself that her father was
      touchy and eccentric about money.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had various letters from her mother, and in one of them
      Mrs. Charlotte mentioned Furze--"It is still terribly dry
      here. I'm afraid poor Mr. Furze is having a hard time with
      his cows. No grass. And he has had three cows sick. The
      poor man looks quite worn out."
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt a little stab of self-reproach. Poor Arnold!
      But--then--why be a farmer? It was a horrid, worrying,
      lonely life, and she could not understand any man choosing
      it or loving it. She had not yet realized man's nature,
      Furze's nature, the inevitable combat, the effort, the
      strivings, the passion for swimming against the tide. She
      wanted to drift, and he--the fighting man--had tried to
      snatch at her and make her swim with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Arnold! Why didn't he sell the place and try to do
      something easier?
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not know that there are men who do not ask for the
      easy things.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were things easy for Furze. He went about looking lean
      and self-absorbed, with his blue eyes sunk deep into his
      tanned face. His temper was short; he was thinner, and not
      only in body but in soul, he had no smiles to spare for
      anybody; and when he spoke to Will or Will's boy or to his
      beasts his voice had a rougher note. He was concerned for
      his farm, and for his pride in it, and deep down in his
      consciousness was a raw-red place, the sore of an inward
      humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things had gone wrong with him before; he had had wet
      seasons instead of dry ones; but he had pulled through with
      an indefatigable patience that had somehow contrived to
      find a smile. But this fight found him smileless. He
      cursed, and endured. He watched his meadows turn brown, and
      his stunted root crops starving in the baked fields, and
      the brook dwindling away, and Rushy Pool becoming a sheet
      of cracked mud. It looked like a piece of crocodile skin
      stretched tight across the mouth of a huge round dish. He
      had two more cows sick with mamitis; the milk yield was
      falling off; he was having to buy feed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nicely balanced internal economy of the farm had been
      disturbed. The hay crop had been a good one, but the fields
      from which the crop had been taken had never greened up and
      given him the expected pasture a month after the taking of
      the hay crop. Also, if you had planned to grow three and a
      half tons of roots for the winter keep of each cow, with
      hay and straw and bean meal, and your whole root crop
      looked like averaging three tons to the acre instead of
      twenty-five, you either had to sell some of your beasts or
      buy in food. Then, there were the sheep and the pigs. He
      had put down some acres of cabbage for spring feed for his
      small flock during the lambing season, but a cruciferous
      crop asks for moisture. Moreover, caterpillars had riddled
      the leaves, and the whole crop smelt of decay. It was just
      a bad season, with the balance of chances against you,
      whatever you might do or say or think. It meant the loss of
      good money and time; it was bad for your stock and your
      temper; it might demand an inroad upon your capital, if you
      had any capital, but other farmers were in like case, and
      the bad ones more so. It called for the philosophy of the
      stiff back, and an obstinacy that plods and endures.
    </p>
    <p>
      This critical season in the life of the farm coincided with
      one of those grave changes in a man's outlook, and the
      drought and the heat and the little disasters reinforced
      the change in Furze's temper. A man who lives much alone is
      in danger of developing what may be described as a moral
      gruffness. As an old Devon farmer had put it one day to
      Furze at Carslake market--"We farmers are a discontented
      lot. Grumble. Of course we grumble. We are always in
      trouble with some cussed thing or other." The soil can
      martyr a man, or twist him into a gnarled, awkward,
      stubborn creature, a misanthrope, a complainer, a fanatic.
      Unfortunate sequences of impersonal phenomena may develop
      in him a personal cussedness. You may accuse a French
      peasant of avarice. Furze was not avaricious, but in his
      darkening and difficult moods he did grudge the money spent
      upon the house to prepare it for that dream wife of his. He
      needed money now, and he needed it badly. Gore Wood would
      have to bear the brunt of the attack; it would stand
      thinned in the spring like an English square at Waterloo.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grudged the selling of those trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was having to pump water for his beasts. And how the
      poor creatures seemed to swill it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had ceased to sweat. His skin felt dry and hot, and he
      was conscious of an inward dryness, an inevitable and
      parched discontent. He got up tired, and slogged through
      the day with savage surliness. His attitude to men and
      things--and women--had changed, yet he did not realize the
      change. It was just that he was worried and overworked and
      unhappy. Other people noticed it, Will, and Will's
      boy--who--caught pilfering a few lean apples in the
      orchard--was given a strapping. "Either you or I'll do it,
      Will."--Will, staring blue-eyed had passed the privilege to
      the master. And Mrs. Sarah had squealed about it for
      hours--and threatened a summons and told all her
      neighbours. "Cut him about cruel--he did, just for a few
      green apples. What I says is--'Boys will be boys.' And I
      says to him I says--'My boy be'nt a beast to be
      lathered,--and don't you forget it, Mister Furze.' Yes,--I
      gave him the edge of my tongue--I did. 'Don't you touch my
      boy again,' I says, 'or I'll have the law of you.'"
      Though--of course--she had said nothing of the kind, being
      slimy and artful and a thief, and Will had to listen to her
      scolding until his patience had given out. "Shut yer mouth,
      y'squealing fool. The boy be mine as much as yours. I gave
      Furze leave to belt him."
    </p>
    <p>
      These lesser disharmonies revolved about the central
      disharmony, for a man and a boar have things in common.
      Hard work can keep a man's thoughts from women, and till
      the coming of Mary Viner Furze had lived as he had lived
      during the war, with mind and body so fully occupied that
      the sex in him had slept. Going to bed healthily tired and
      satisfied with the day's work he had been content to sleep.
      It is the townsman--the sitter upon stools--whose thoughts
      are always round the corner chasing petticoats. But with
      the coming of Mary Viner the essential male in Furze had
      been stirred to wakefulness. He had desired her cleanly and
      wholesomely, from the very deeps of him, with a devoted
      fineness, and a strength that could be very tender. He had
      been the big, romantic creature seeking a mate. His love
      had had finality, like his love of his farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had humiliated both his loves. He had tried to put the
      thought of her away, but all through those weeks of heat
      and dryness and effort an open wound ran blood. The very
      bitterness of the drought and his many disappointments
      seemed to keep it open. He brooded. He would wander about
      at night, restless and overtired, thinking of her and of
      the things that she had denied him. She had let him go so
      far, pressed the fruit to his very mouth before snatching
      it away. And he was thirsty. The mere sensuous thrilling of
      body against body, the clasping of hands--yes, he asked for
      more than these. He wanted sympathy. How she could have
      helped him through this difficult time! Had he been able to
      come back to the house and feel her presence and its
      meaning; had he been able to talk to her about things, and
      to feel too that he was fighting them for her! He craved
      that spiritual and emotional contact that transcends the
      mere physical relationship. He was very lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
      His loneliness turned fierce in him. There was that
      stifling night when the farmyard pump had refused suction,
      needing a new leather, and he had had to carry all the
      water for the beasts from the house. He had worked like a
      man in a dull and smouldering rage. He had come in to see
      that pink lustre tea-service neatly arranged on the table
      in Mrs. Damaris' parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered that he had paid one pound fifteen shillings
      for that tea service.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden anger had possessed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken the pink lustre piece by piece and thrown it
      through the open window to smash against the garden wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      And next morning, feeling a fool in the cool hush of the
      dawn, he had been compelled to go out and pick up the
      pieces and bury them in one of the flower-beds. There were
      no flowers in the beds now. They were dead.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      During all these weeks Furze never touched that old toy of
      his--the piano, for music could say things to him that he
      did not wish to hear; also he was tired and his need was
      the sound of a human voice. He asked for two sympathetic
      ears to listen, and a voice to give back a few words of
      understanding and encouragement. He was as starved as his
      fields. He wanted to talk and he had no one to whom he
      could talk, for he went very rarely now to "Green
      Shutters," and in the other farms men had troubles of their
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      That loneliness should breed restlessness was inevitable.
      He came up against the mirror in Mrs. Damaris' parlour and
      saw himself with a three days' beard on his face, no
      collar, an old shirt torn at one shoulder and a pair of
      braces that lacked one of the leather button loops. He was
      shocked at his own slovenliness. It was the slovenliness of
      a man who had become the slave of the soil. And suddenly he
      rebelled. Why grow like a dull beast?
    </p>
    <p>
      Will was passing across the Doom Paddock, and Furze hailed
      him from the window through which he had thrown the pink
      lustre tea-service.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sssir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might do the milking and the watering. I'm going up to
      Carslake."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went upstairs and shaved himself and put on a clean
      shirt and collar and a brown tweed suit. He even hunted out
      a coloured tie and a pair of light blue and grey socks. He
      dressed his restlessness and his self esteem, and slipped a
      pound note and some odd silver into his pockets. He was
      going up to Carslake, but without any definite idea upon
      the possibilities of Carslake, and its dozen or so shops
      and its little stuffy cinema, and its "George Inn." Anyway
      he would be among his fellow-humans for an hour or two,
      clean and decently clothed, and able to look a woman in the
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hot evening, and in Carslake High Street a thirst
      asserted itself. He was looking into a tobacconist's, with
      no other solace for his restlessness than the adventure of
      trying a new tobacco, and reflected in the window he saw
      the red façade of the "George Inn" with its white
      window-sashes and green curtains and window-boxes. The
      "George" was a good old inn well managed. It was kept by
      the Lavenders, a father and a bevy of pleasant daughters,
      Rosemary, and Ivy and Violet. Pretty creatures--too. And
      old Lavender had one of those cheerful English faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not go in and dine at the 'George'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      My God, how sick he was of salt bacon and corned beef, and
      plum jam, and flat lettuces, and boiled eggs and tea, and
      soapy potatoes! And his slovenly, helter-skelter meals,
      with that chipped white enamel tea-pot, and tarnished spoon
      stuck in a jam-pot, and no cloth on the table, and the
      plates suggesting cold water and smeary haste! His gorge
      rose. He smelt the flesh pots of the "George," roast
      butcher's meat and good cheese and a glass of ale, and a
      cup of coffee afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the road and went up the three well-whitened
      steps into the "George." A broad man, coatless, with a
      straw hat tilted well back like a halo about a pleasant
      pink face, was standing by the lounge door reading an
      evening paper. It was old Lavender himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, sir! Haven't seen you for months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't seen myself for months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah,--you have been having a rough time. Paper says the
      weather looks like changing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to God it would," said Furze. "Can I have some
      dinner here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure-ly! Always glad to see you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The coffee-room was upstairs on the first floor, and as
      Furze went up the stairs which were narrow and rather dark
      a young woman who was coming down in a hurry with an empty
      tray nearly ran into him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. She had very white teeth, and very black
      prettily-bobbed hair, and eyes that looked dark and large
      in a white and broadish face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze smiled back at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My fault. Can I have some dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew aside to let her pass, and she went by as though
      she was quite conscious of the man in him, and so made the
      man in him conscious of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the white tables and the silver, and the flowers in
      the vases, blue and white asters and crimson gladioli, and
      the old red houses of the High Street out of one window,
      and out of the other the green oaks and tawny grass of
      Carslake park. The girl was back in the room. He had not
      seen her at the "George" before; she was not one of the
      Lavenders. Her apron had a lace edge, and looked very
      clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where shall I sit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where would you like to sit, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a pleasant voice that was almost Irish in its
      leisureliness. It was like a lazy hand drawing its fingers
      across velvet. She smiled,--but without boldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By that window?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were only three or four people in the room, motorists
      spending the night, a hot-faced young man with a girl, a
      bald curate, a hard-bitten woman in tweeds. Furze sat down
      at his table, and as his fingers touched the starched white
      napkin he felt a little thrill of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have a pint of draught ale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      She brought him the menu card. She was a big, strong girl
      with a splendid throat and neck, but she moved lightly, and
      somehow she made him think of a pleasant, softly breathing,
      large-eyed heifer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thick soup, sir. And roast beef or cold veal and ham pie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands were large and white, with long soft fingers.
      They were very clean. He noticed that the palms were pink,
      and that she was wearing a gold signet ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--roast beef. And plum tart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And cream, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--please."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a most efficient waitress, quiet in her movements,
      and with a dark dignity of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite so hot to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      She studied him as she held a vegetable dish. He was one of
      the brownest men she had ever seen, a comely man, a
      gentleman farmer--obviously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't been here for a long time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      His suggestion was that he had not seen her before, and she
      caught it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Motoring, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I farm. 'Doomsday'; down the Melhurst road."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know much about the country, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not been here long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two months."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was about as far as they got during the dinner, but
      Furze's eyes were following her half shyly about the room,
      and though she met his eyes but once she was very well
      aware of them. He was a fine, big man, big without being
      too tall. She liked his eyes and his hands, and the way his
      hair grew, and the deep brown of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I have some coffee?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the lounge, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please."
    </p>
    <p>
      She brought him his coffee. There was no one else in the
      lounge. She poured out the coffee for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milk, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And sugar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One lump."
    </p>
    <p>
      She put it in and seemed about to go, but paused for an
      imperceptible moment. He was about to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I come here again--may I have the same table?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My--my name is Furze. And may I have the bill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She brought him the bill, and took his tip in one of her
      big soft hands, and gave him one intent glance, half
      smiling, half wise. "Thank you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not find out her name that night, for he was a man
      of reservations and she no trollop.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      A week before her marriage Mary fell into one of her panic
      moods. Everything that could be bought had been bought; she
      was ready to the last tin of nail polish; she was sleek,
      plump and perfumed. Nothing was left for her to do but to
      sit down and wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      She realized that she was marrying a stranger. The wheels
      of her triumphal car wobbled and quivered, and her pretty
      self came down in agitation at Clare's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel so responsible."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her panic was obvious, and her sister's cool and world-wise
      hands had to comfort her. Mary had made no new discovery;
      you married a stranger when you married a man, but in
      Mary's case the adventure was nicely padded against shocks
      and alarums.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your man is kind, my dear. He is not a cub in a hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was ready to agree that her grandee was kind, but she
      found it difficult to describe his kindness. It was rather
      like a wet sheet or an ice-pack. He was so completely the
      correct lover of mature years; he would bend stiffly from
      the hips and kiss her hand; he seemed better at kissing
      hands than kissing lips. In fact there were times when she
      had the feeling that he was afraid of her, though what he
      could fear in her was beyond her comprehension. Yet his
      kisses were tentative and self-conscious, as though he were
      thinking about the quality of his kissing even when he was
      in the midst of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a little bewildered. His breath never came more
      quickly when he was near her. She still thought of him as
      strong and silent, and Spanish, and she had held her breath
      and waited for the fire beneath to reveal itself. She had
      been mesmerized by a mystery, by a little god of her own
      making, but her deity continued to be grandly inarticulate
      and benignantly silent. It was a shy and obscure god.
    </p>
    <p>
      That she had fallen in love with his possessions, his
      atmosphere, she would not allow. No--no. Val was dear. He
      might be a little difficult to understand, but surely all
      strong, deep men were not easily fathomed? And she had
      begun to feel so dependent on him; she was the eternal
      vine, and he was the post to which it was her fate to
      cling. A post! Just that. But a post that could not put out
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to have no arms, but two rigid appendages in
      sleeves. Always she was conscious of his sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, Val,--I do want to make you happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sought to cling, and he was as stiff as a post, a kind
      post, a martyr's stake. For the piece of wood that was
      Fream yearned to become the young tree, and hoped that the
      miracle might happen, and was afraid that it would not
      happen. And the very fear inhibited the transformation, and
      he continued to be the post.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--you will--my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to tell her that it was her happiness that
      mattered, patting the middle of her back with a hand that
      was like a stuffed kid glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope I can give you everything you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But could he? And what exactly did she want? And how much
      of it? O, the pomp of the body, that fine flamboyant pride!
      How little did she know that he was in a greater panic than
      she was, a shameful panic. She could not see him sitting in
      his padded swivel chair in the oak-panelled private room in
      his London offices, his long legs tucked up stiffly, his
      face as blank as a sheet of unruled foolscap. What an
      adventure, what a gamble for a man who had become little
      more than a calculating machine or a prospectus, or a
      company report! And yet she was a thing that he wanted to
      possess, a live trophy, a beautiful breathing statue, for
      all the statues that he had collected were lifeless things.
      Stone Venuses, marble nymphs. He craved the live
      possession, and he sat in his chair and was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      How was she to know?
    </p>
    <p>
      But Fream talked about his honeymoon. He found
      self-expression when dealing with values. "Ph&oelig;bus"
      would take them down to Dover. He had reserved a cabin on
      the boat, and a sleeper for two, and a suite at the
      "Cosmopolis" at Monte Carlo. Certainly he could overwhelm
      her with values, food, clothes, luxurious living. If she
      wished to shine before other women she could shine. There
      was not a liqueur, not a dress, not a precious stone that
      need be denied to her. He talked a great deal about Monte
      Carlo,--a great deal for him; he clung to that beautiful,
      bastard town as though it were a wise old procuress who
      could save him. Yes, of course Mary must have her flutter
      at the tables. Later--if it pleased her grace, this
      Cinderella of the Suburbs, they would go on to Rome and
      Naples and Sorento, and back by Florence. If Venice piqued
      her--well--they would go to Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mary would say--"Yes, Val, how lovely, how perfectly
      lovely!" and would wonder why he was so impersonal and so
      courteous, for your nymph, pretty creature though she may
      be, may have the warm blood of a little country wench. Her
      wound was not quite healed; she still smelt the smell of
      new-mown hay. Her heart cried out to this other man--"O,
      love me, Val, love me hard. Make me forget." She wanted
      arms, not two paralysed appendages in sleeves. She wanted
      to surrender to the little god of her own contriving, to
      feel his grand silence opening and enveloping her in a
      wonderful mastery. Having cheated one man she seemed in a
      fever to surrender to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the great day came, and with it her parents, old
      Hesketh in a very much ironed and pathetic top-hat and a
      frock coat that had lived on and off in camphor for the
      last thirty years. Mrs. Charlotte wore black satin. Mary
      wept a little, but felt better when she looked into her
      mirror and saw herself dressed. Blackcurrants and whipped
      cream! Downstairs that kind soul Leslie had opened a bottle
      of champagne. He insisted on her drinking two glasses of
      it, while Clare pulled on her gloves and looked pale and
      very wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fream--too--went to the church on champagne. He remembered
      that other occasion when he had gone much more gaily to
      church to marry a woman. That had been in June, and the
      month was October, wet and windy, and already the leaves
      were falling. He felt in a deuce of a funk, this poor
      desiccated lover, a piece of parchment, Mary's marriage
      settlement tied up with pink tape.

    </p>
    <p>
      The crossing proved a rough one. Mary was very sick, and
      lay in her cabin, and did not care how sick she was, or
      whether her husband witnessed it or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He desired to be kind, but unfortunately he was nearly as
      sick as she was, and was loving his basin, and hating the
      sea and his own soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bad beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, Val, I daren't move."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked like chalk tinted with yellow ochre, and about a
      hundred years old, but Calais harbour had soothed his
      qualms. He had to take charge. He should have taken it and
      kept it, and all might have been well had he been the man
      he wanted to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very kind to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No hurry, dear. Straight in to our wagon-lit. Take my
      arm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, Val--you haven't got a clean handkerchief, have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He hadn't. He had thought of everything but that.
    </p>
    <p>
      They survived the dog-fight at the French customs
      examination, and made for the train with a sweating and
      jabbering porter all hung about them with hand baggage.
      Their compartment was found in the wagon-lits. Fream wanted
      her to come to the buffet and have some hot soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nausea was still upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't, Val. I'd rather lie down. You go."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he would not go without her. He tucked her up in a rug
      and sat down and watched her, though she was praying to be
      left alone for half an hour. She felt squalid. She was
      sufficiently recovered to be able to remember her
      appearance, and she yearned for a wash and a chance to
      remember those little niceties that mean so much to a
      woman. He had not the sense to leave her alone, to go to
      the buffet, or stand in the corridor. He sat and stared,
      and every five minutes asked her with great kindness how
      she was feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And would she like some brandy?
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Val, thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face to the cushions, while over the wide
      French country--plough-lands and stubble--a grey sheet of
      rain drifted.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      This was in October. In August, casting back six weeks,
      there was other rain, English rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Press weather report had promised a continuance of the
      drought; a ridge of high pressure was extending northwards
      from the Azores; the wind would be from the north-west--the
      weather fair and warm. So much for the experts. In the
      afternoon of the same day the wind veered to the west and
      became strong and gusty; masses of white cloud began to
      sail the sky--and mixed with these great galleons were
      little smudges of smoking vapour. When Furze saw these
      smudges an excitement stirred in him. He could feel the
      coming rain; it was there; if only the cloud canopy would
      form and break.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was out of bed at five o'clock next morning, and
      standing at the window. There had been no rain in the
      night, but the sky was overcast, completely grey and
      clouded, and the wind had dropped. The stillness was
      supreme, an expectant stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will rain, it--must rain," he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet he doubted. He had seen other skies clear after an
      hour's miserable and useless drizzle, a little tantalizing
      moisture that mocked the thirsty land. Yes, this was no
      heat haze, but a cistern of clouds ready to burst.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the morning the sky remained a dense grey
      sheet, but no rain fell. It was a sky of suspense, and
      Furze idled about, waiting for the merciful rain, and
      unable to work. He heard the beasts lowing; that was a good
      sign; the swallows were flying low; Tibby the cat sat on
      the doorstep and washed behind her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will was pumping water into the yard troughs. The yard well
      was holding out, but the water had fallen fifteen feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must rain, Will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe it will, ssir, maybe it won't. Any or'nary year I'd
      say it was going to drown us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze was very restless. He wandered about the farm all the
      morning, gloomily hopeful. Well, if it did not rain he
      would go up and dine at the "George" and see Rosa Hurley.
      He knew her name very well by now. At noon not a drop had
      fallen out of that looming, slatey sky, and he went in to
      his dinner, and ate some bread and cheese, but could touch
      no meat, a wretched end of cold mutton with a few cold
      boiled potatoes to garnish it. He left the food and plates
      lying there, and went out again, and wandered. He kept
      pulling out an old silver watch. Two o'clock--three
      o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in the Maid's Croft where the footpath swung a brown
      loop across the scorched grass when the first raindrops
      fell. He stood quite still, holding his breath. They came
      singly, big drops; one struck his hat, others pattered on
      the scorched grass. And then, suddenly, as though some
      great hand had torn a rent in the canopy overhead, the rain
      came down in a grey sheet. The dry grass seemed to crackle
      and steam, and the cracks in the caked soil bubbled. Furze
      took off his hat and let the rain run over his face; he
      exulted; he drew deep breaths; he felt the wetness soaking
      his shoulders and running down his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone was coming up the path from Bean Acres, a figure
      blurred by the rain. The upper part of it was yellow, the
      lower part black. It was a girl, and Furze watched her,
      this rain maiden, this virgin of the breaking clouds. What
      the devil--?
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he laughed for she came laughing towards him, her
      yellow jumper drenched, and a fringe of pearls hanging to
      the brim of her hat. Her black hair was soaked, her face a
      happy pleasant wetness, and the whole of her looking dewy
      and fresh, beneficent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What on earth are you doing here, Rose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Getting wet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you. Aren't you glad, Mr. Furze?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My afternoon off. Thought I would have a ramble. My best
      hat and jumper have brought down the rain for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with laughter and more than laughter in their eyes they
      stood and looked at each other, and to Furze she was the
      rain goddess, a strong, comely, dark-eyed creature with
      white teeth and wet hair. He saw a raindrop on her round
      white chin. She seemed part of the rain, cool and fresh and
      wholesome, a laughing, good-humoured, warm-hearted thing.
      The blood stirred in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll have to come in and shelter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm wet through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall have to dry you. You have brought me good luck,
      Rose, the first good luck for months."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dark eyes held his for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There was no fire burning in the house, but Furze brought
      an armful of dry wood in the living-room, and found Rose
      standing in her stockinged feet, looking at dirty plates
      and the ragged end of mutton on the table. "Poor man," she
      had thought; "no wonder he comes up to us sometimes." Her
      wet feet had left marks upon the red tiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze threw the wood on the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll get some logs. Soon have a blaze. You must be
      soaked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right through."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled over it. No word about spoilt clothes and a
      pulped hat. Her stockinged feet pleased him--why, he did
      not know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll get those sticks alight while you fetch the logs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you. You'll find paper and matches in that cupboard."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was bending over the fire when he returned, her wet
      jumper clinging to her body. Yes, she was a fine, strong
      girl, no flat-chested young city wench. He felt too that
      she was good, if goodness meant warm-heartedness and
      pleasant common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid."
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon had a blaze, and the shimmer of it was in her
      eyes and upon her wet black hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Feel cold, Rose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, girl--you must get those wet things off. I can
      rig you up with something or other while we dry all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat on her heels and considered something.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. You go in here and lock the door,--and I'll collect
      something--and leave it outside."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled up at him, and he opened the door of Mrs.
      Damaris' parlour, and left her, and going upstairs began to
      search about for clothes. A tweed coat and an old white
      sweater. Yes, but what the devil--? No,--not breeches. All
      he could think of was a couple of green linen curtains and
      a leather belt, and he carried the whole collection down
      and knocked at the parlour door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rose--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a bit of a puzzle,--the skirt,--I mean. See what you
      can make of all this. I am going to get tea ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      From the kitchen he heard the door open and close. There
      was a silence, and then her voice called him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Furze--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you any safety-pins?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Safety-pins! I don't know. I'll have a look."
    </p>
    <p>
      He found one safety-pin, and two gold pins that he used
      with his soft collars.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I can find. On the floor."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the tea-tray filled when he heard the parlour door
      open, and when he entered the living-room she was hanging
      her clothes on the backs of two chairs in front of the
      fire. She looked at him with a laughing coyness. She had
      made quite a nice job of the skirt, looping the two
      curtains over the belt, and pinning them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forgot--stockings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her bare feet; they were pretty feet, and few
      feet are pretty uncovered, and they were very white.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They look better as they are," he said, "much better than
      in a pair of my socks. But you'll find those tiles cold; I
      can rig you up with some slippers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--I'm all right," she said, and looked at the tea-tray.
      Had he not anybody to do things for him, no woman about the
      place?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry--I've no cake. If I'd known."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can do without cake--bought cake. The only cake worth
      eating is home made."
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to consider that a very pregnant saying, and
      stood looking for a moment at her feet, only to discover
      when he looked at her face that there seemed to be more
      colour there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about the kettle?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rose, you are a woman of sense."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went for the kettle, while she cleared away the debris
      of his dinner, and spread the clean cloth he had brought
      in, and looked both serious and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who washes up for you, Mr. Furze?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--I have a woman in twice a week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the other times?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mess along somehow. Farming's not all--violets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that," she said arranging the cups and plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father has a small farm. Shall I cut some bread and
      butter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do," he said, and fell into a sudden stare, and came out
      of it with a smile of discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you like your tea, Rose? Strong or weak?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strong--I'm afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I."
    </p>
    <p>
      The moist rush of the rain continued. The orchard trees
      were dripping. The gutters and water-spouts murmured and
      gurgled. Furze's face was all smoothed out, and his eyes
      had softened, and sometimes he would look at the rain and
      sometimes at the face of the girl. A farmer's daughter was
      she! He had been thinking of her a good deal during the
      last two or three weeks, but now that she was sitting there
      with her white feet tucked under her chair, and her clothes
      drying by the fire, and pouring out his tea for him, he
      felt her in the same way yet differently. He felt her more
      deeply, more intimately, not as the incidental woman to be
      kissed and held for an hour or two, but more like the good
      rich soil, a comely field.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a hard life, Rose. Was it too hard for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him wisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were three of us, Mr. Furze, and three big girls are
      not wanted on a forty-acre farm. Oh,--I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His seriousness had a touch of fierceness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many pennies go to the pound. How much milk goes to a
      pound of butter. How many hours it takes to clear a dozen
      blackcurrant bushes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not afraid of him. Her frank and handsome face had
      a half-smiling serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soft words won't bring rain. No lying long in bed. Up
      early. Scrubbing brushes and milk cans. That's one thing
      about the soil, it does make you honest. You have to face
      hard facts."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes became gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good girl. I thought all women wanted silk stockings these
      days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why shouldn't they? If they work for them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah,--there you are. You have got it. Eve has not quite
      sneaked back into Paradise."
    </p>
    <p>
      They laughed and there was a mutual desire in their
      laughter. But he was a man of the soil, and the dreamer in
      him had had his lesson; there are facts to be faced when a
      man of the soil is for kissing a woman. Has she a pair of
      hands as well as a soft mouth, and hands that are willing?
    </p>
    <p>
      He filled a pipe, deliberately, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milking to do. If my fellow has not been drowned--he has
      fetched the cows in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do your own milking, Mr. Furze?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mostly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can milk," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up, and with a match to the bowl of his pipe, stood
      half turned to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll leave you to look after your clothes, Rose. And look
      over the house--if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll wash up. This old place is lovely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not like a raw new place. Been lived in--and loved a
      little."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a quick, deep glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my dear; you're wise."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the door and paused there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine--you know. But I am still having a devil of a fight
      to make ends meet--and this summer will hit me rather
      hard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For richer or poorer, Mr. Furze. That's a farm."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When he came back she had been all over the house with a
      sleek look on her pleasant face. Her dark eyes had a
      consenting softness. She had seen things that had stirred
      the woman in her. "He's a man and a good one." She had
      warmed to the way he had treated her. No innuendoes, no
      advantages taken. He was a good man who could be gentle and
      clean with a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze found her dressed, her black hair all crisped after
      its soaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure those things are dry, Rose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked him straight in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dry enough, Mr. Furze."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had cleared the table, and it seemed to him that the
      room had been tidied up. The clothes and stuff that he had
      lent her lay folded on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Been over the house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked out of the window. It was still raining hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't such a thing as an umbrella, dear. But I can rig
      you up. And I'll see you as far as--Carslake."
    </p>
    <p>
      An old trench coat that he still used in bad weather hung
      from a peg on the kitchen door. He took it down, and helped
      her on with it, and buttoned her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about your hat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can carry it--under the coat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clever girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what about you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sack,--my dear--if you'll allow it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes lit up. "I'd allow you anything--my man," they
      said, and he stood and met the light in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But under the dripping hood of the porch the same impulse
      took them both. They held each other close and kissed, and
      went up the wet lane hand in hand.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Percival Fream arrived at the "Cosmopolis"
      Hotel in Monte Carlo about half-past three in the
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was very tired. Moreover, it was raining and the
      southern sea draped under a grey veil looked strange and
      unwelcoming. A gilded lift took them up to the second
      floor, and a polite bureau clerk in black threw open the
      door of their suite, and waited attentively upon the
      Englishman's face of ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like it,--dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She said that it was lovely, and felt suddenly and absurdly
      homesick in the midst of all this pink velvet and white
      enamel and gilding. The bureau-clerk had departed after
      assuring Fream that the luggage should be sent up at once
      and Mary stood at a window looking at the sea and the
      harbour of Monaco, while her man remained in the middle of
      the room austerely and awkwardly holding his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry it's raining--my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      She could have wept--for she was so tired, and with a
      strange tiredness that she did not understand. And here was
      Monte Carlo, and he was apologizing to her for the rain.
      Also, as a woman she knew that much was expected of her,
      thrills, sighs, ecstasies, all the mysteries of the
      unveiling, and somehow she felt as flat as that grey sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think I could lie down, Val?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      They explored the suite. It consisted of a sitting-room, a
      bedroom with two beds, a dressing-room and a bathroom, all
      in white and rose and gold. She wanted to be left alone,
      and he came and stood beside her in the bedroom and put a
      flat and expressionless hand between her shoulder blades.
      He was trying to say something. She wished he would go
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tired--my dear--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Val."
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt his hand thumping her gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Luggage coming up. Lie down. I'll ring for some
      tea. Lie down till dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--Val."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Feel better--after dinner. A little wine--you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he was very kind, but how was it that she found his
      kindness so very dreary, rather like a wet handkerchief on
      your forehead when you had a headache? And life had
      promised to be so triumphant! O, she was tired; both of
      them were tired. Tea arrived in a metal teapot, with toast
      and rolls and butter, and a plate of cakes, chocolate
      eclairs, and creamy things and sugary things. The tea
      seemed to be very tasteless, and Fream sat and drank it
      solemnly as though he had just buried himself. Afterwards
      she lay down on one of the beds, and two politely detached
      porters bustled the luggage in and unstrapped it. Fream was
      smoking a cigar in the sitting-room; she could smell the
      cigar smoke, and presently she heard him go out. She got up
      and bolted the door, and lay down again, and tried to
      sleep, but found herself staring at the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      About seven o'clock Mary heard him return. She jumped up
      and unbolted the door. She had duties to perform, and she
      felt lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, Val--I ought to dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said he with a queer, stiff smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall I wear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His face expressed inward effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something pink--rosy--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She put on her rose and silver brocade, and heard him busy
      in his dressing-room, but even the sounds he made were
      restrained and careful and correct. She had a curious wish
      to hear him whistle, or drop something, and say "Confound
      it." She realized, while she was considering herself in her
      mirror, that she had never seen him in action, walking
      fast, or playing a game, or laughing, or talking as though
      he could not help it. She had never seen him let himself
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong and silent were becoming a little too enigmatic,
      and she felt lonely, and a little conscious of another
      occasion when a man had loved her to the point of
      roughness. And yet it had been with a gentle roughness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She brooded for three minutes, and looked at the two beds.
      Yes, it took two to make a marriage, and also an impulsive
      sense of nearness. But--if always--there was a gap,
      something unexpressed and unfulfilled?
    </p>
    <p>
      They dined notably, for Fream had rung for a waiter and had
      had the menu brought up to his suite by the maître d'hotel,
      and so they dined à la carte, with a very polite maître
      d'hotel presiding over the little pomps and ceremonies of
      the meal. Dishes were brought and presented; the
      champagne--Roederer 1914--arrived in a pail of ice. An
      orchestra played. Fream should have had every cause to be
      proud of his wife. She was beautifully gowned; she showed a
      languor that might have enveloped the most admirable and
      experienced of worldlings; she was quite the prettiest
      creature in a crowded room. And yet that little pagan
      love-feast was without a soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were frightened of each other, of that other shadowy,
      watchful self.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little more champagne, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, really--Val, thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will do you good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly it made her a little more talkative, but her
      vivacity was pantomimic.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning she heard Fream moving, but she lay very
      still, pretending to be asleep, until the door of his
      dressing-room closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was conscious of a feeling of humiliation, and of
      pitiful bewilderment. She sat on the edge of the bed, with
      a vacant face, pondering upon a shameful pity that seemed
      to well up out of the deeps. Such pity! She could see that
      the sun was shining, and she went and opened the shutters,
      and saw the sea as blue as lapis lazuli, and felt the stir
      of that southern coast. Three old men, bent and black, with
      guitar, violin, and mandoline, struck up some Italian
      love-song in the garden below. They looked up at her
      window. One, the oldest and most bent of the three, began
      to sing in a harsh and metallic voice, and at the end of
      each stanza he broke into an absurd little shuffling dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a serenade! Old age cackling and posturing down there
      in the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      During the days that followed she fell to a level of
      languid resignation. Never had she felt so tired, inwardly
      tired. Her bubble mystery had burst.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could not be helped. She suspected him of being the
      victim of a humiliation far more final than was hers. He
      had gone about with the face of a man sick unto death; he
      had avoided her eyes; yet never had he been so talkative.
    </p>
    <p>
      And such talking, disjointed, spasmodic, and yet
      continuous, like blood spurting perpetually from a wound.
      He looked bleached. Sometimes he broke into a stammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt desolated, submerged beneath his misery, yet
      without fully understanding it and its final significance.
      She was immensely repelled; and also helplessly
      compassionate. Never had she experienced such loneliness,
      and crying out in the silence for comfort she was kind to
      him because she felt that they were lost in the same
      wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not know that her kindness humiliated him to the
      deeps. They wandered about together like strangers, she a
      little bewildered and appealing, he with a sick, bleached
      face, and a mouth that emitted sounds like the mouth of a
      ventriloquist's dummy. He had discovered his own death,
      that he was not a live man, but just that which he had
      suspected himself to be, a manipulator of figures.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      They went everywhere and did everything. An equal
      feverishness seemed to possess them both. Yet, all the
      while, she was seeing him vividly as she had never seen him
      before, as one seems to see the still and naked soul of a
      man lying in his coffin. She noticed that when he talked
      his conversation dealt solely with material things, objects
      and their value. He was all surface, façade, a human
      diagram, a piece of arithmetic. He did not seem capable of
      expressing any sentiment, or of seeing beauty, or of
      appreciating the innumerable movements of the great
      shadow-show. Æsthetically he was colour blind,--and in his
      feelings--such as they were--fatally dumb. He had lost the
      language of normal manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It shocked her. So did his renewed lavishness. He poured
      out money, and there was something in her that began to be
      pitifully offended by this lavishness. Could he not express
      himself in any other way? He sent her into shops and made
      her buy things, dresses, hats, jewellery, articles de luxe,
      useless things, extravagant superfluities. Once or twice
      she tried to protest--"Val,--I don't want it," and almost
      he seemed angry--"Suppose I can give you what I want," but
      the real anger was against himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She touched pathos. She was astonished to find that she was
      not enjoying the strawberry-bed as she had expected to
      enjoy it, and that her poor, pretty, fruit-stained fingers
      hesitated over the fruit. Too much of it! Having worn all
      her dresses and her pretty pretties and shown them off
      before the other women at the "Cosmopolis," before French
      women and Italians and Central Europeans, and South
      Americans, yellow women and brown women, she began to
      repeat the programme and found it less exciting. Fream
      never remarked upon her dresses. He had the air of looking
      at fruit which it was beyond his power to digest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hired a car, a most luxurious car. They drove to Sospel
      and Grasse and Vence, and up to Gourdon, and over the
      frontier to San Remo. They lunched at the most expensive
      hotels, and in a little while she thought the food very
      ordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went almost nightly to the casino, and it was here
      that she began to suspect and to know the real Fream. At
      first he just stood and watched the game, and indulged in
      an occasional and desultory stake; two days later he
      slipped into the chair left by a departing player. He spoke
      to her over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Care to watch me--I am going to have a little flutter."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood there an hour. The air of the place made her head
      ache. She thought that she had never seen such a collection
      of unwholesome faces, faces that were dead to everything
      save the one obsession, drugged faces. Fream was winning.
      She realized suddenly that he had forgotten her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped away and out into the clean air, and walked a
      while above the harbour before turning into the
      "Cosmopolis." She went to bed. Fream came in about
      mid-night. He looked both apologetic and self-pleased.
      Almost he suggested a slight swagger, a touch of arrogance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry to be late. When did you go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--I just slipped away, Val. You were winning,--so I
      thought--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His flat face had a sleek pallor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won--Ten thousand francs or so. That's my job, you know.
      Got a flair for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never seen him so animated; he seemed to have
      recovered some of his self-respect. If blood did not
      circulate--money did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather piques me--you know, doing the bank down with the
      chances loaded against you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Imperceptibly he drifted more and more to the casino, and
      she let him go, and almost encouraged him to go. It gave
      her solitude, and she was astonished to find how she craved
      for solitude, as though being eternally with one voiceless
      man was like being eternally with a meaningless crowd. She
      would find him in the sitting-room after breakfast,
      scribbling figures and smoking a very strong cigar. She
      noticed that his correspondence increased, that bulky
      envelopes came out to him registered, and that he received
      telegrams. She had a very vivid impression of him sitting
      stiffly at the table, with his flat white face, the brown
      cigar projecting from it, and one large white hand jotting
      down figures. The extreme tension of their mutual
      discomfort seemed to relax a little. She made one or two
      acquaintances in the hotel, went for drives alone or picked
      up a protégé. She even advanced to the self-confidence of
      giving a luncheon party to three or four people, and Fream
      attended it, and looked as though he were doing figures in
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went regularly to the casino. Occasionally she went with
      him. He won more often than he lost. His knack of annexing
      money rather frightened her; it was uncanny, just a little
      inhuman,--like himself.

    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of October they reached Rome, and put up at the
      "Excelsior." They had agreed to come on to Rome because
      both of them had begun to suffer from concealed
      restlessness, and had agreed brightly and like the very
      best of friends that Rome attracted them. Most certainly it
      attracted Mary. She wanted to see it and to be able to talk
      about it, St. Peter's, the Vatican, the Forum, the Spanish
      Steps, Keats' grave, Tivoli, for she had a passion to see
      things, to efface her rustic insularity. The wife of Mr.
      Percival Fream needed to be a woman of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in Rome that she began to discover her husband's
      profound ignorance. That he should have but little French
      and no Italian was of no moment, and quite English, and
      "quanto costa" carried him as far as the contents of his
      pocket-book, but that he should be under the impression
      that St. Peter's had been built by a Roman emperor was
      something of a shock to her. For, standing in the piazza,
      he had looked with his flat eyes at the mass of stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These Roman chaps could build."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so astonished that she was tempted to believe that
      Imperial Rome must have produced St. Peter's. Also, she had
      been ready to suppose that he would be interested in
      pictures, since he possessed two or three "old masters,"
      but he was quite unable to distinguish a Raphael from a
      Michelangelo. She did know, having read it in the guide
      book, that the window of Keats' room had overlooked the
      Spanish Steps, and pausing to discover it she was
      questioned by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you looking for, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He "my deared" her solemnly like a Victorian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keats' window."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No shops here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keats the poet, Val."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was made to feel that he had never heard of Keats, and
      when she took him to the Protestant Cemetery to see Keats'
      grave and the resting-place of Shelley's heart, he wandered
      with her among the cypresses and looked bored. "No use for
      these poet chaps." He did not say so, but she divined it as
      his opinion. But he had heard of Romulus and Remus and the
      wolf, and of Garibaldi as a sort of filibustering fellow in
      a red shirt. They went to see the Coliseum by moonlight,
      and he stood beside her with an air of meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think of the ghosts, Val."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ghosts!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He lacked both fancifulness and a sense of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonder how much money their box-office took on a full
      night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      After that she despaired of his æsthetics. She noticed that
      he much preferred wandering along the Via Nazionale, and
      that he wanted to find the "Bourse." And always he would
      pause outside a bank, and look it up and down as though
      estimating its solidity. He allowed that these Italian
      fellows could build, but he thought that the new Regent
      Street knocked them endways. He was absurdly interested in
      the rate of exchange, and played a little daily game of his
      own with the lira, and wanted her to be interested in it,
      and if he happened to be five lire on the right side he
      appeared quite pleased. They hired a car and drove to
      Tivoli and Frascati, and he asked her--quite
      solemnly--whether she had ever had a meal at "Frascati's."
      But at the end of ten days she estimated his boredom to be
      as profound as was his ignorance. She went alone up to S.
      Pietro in Montorio, and to the terrace of the Pincio, and
      looked over Rome and wondered and felt sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Mary and her husband had in the course of three or four
      short weeks agreed--tacitly--to shut the door upon the
      physical phenomena of marriage. Emotionally it had been a
      fiasco, a humiliating incident in the lives of both. It was
      not discussed. They locked it up like a room in which some
      tragic event had happened. After all--there was all the
      rest of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The band was playing in the gardens, and she stood and
      looked towards St. Peter's. Yes, there was all the rest of
      the house, many things to enjoy, rooms which had not yet
      been opened or lived in. Her man might exist for money, but
      he was not mean about money. He was allowing her a thousand
      a year for dress and casual personal expenses; and she was
      to have a little car of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It need not be so bad," she thought, and was shocked at
      her own acceptance of life's relativity. How quickly had
      she come down from her peak to the levels of compromise and
      compensations! Well,--well! She had not arrived at that
      degree of emotional persuasion when a woman begins to ask
      questions, and to wonder whether judgments are formulated
      and put into action. Her grandee had fallen out of his
      frame; he was a queer, inarticulate, kind, ignorant,
      money-hunting man. No, not quite a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt herself flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, no,--I don't want to think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She put a bright face upon her misery, and returning to the
      "Excelsior" found him in the lounge reading a financial
      paper. He looked pleased about something. He told her that
      he had just bought a couple of statues, marble--you know.
      They would look rather well on the terrace of Hill House.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little, chilly sensation ran through her. She sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't you like to go home, Val?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His glasses glimmered at her over the top of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as you please, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think--I--Won't it be the wrong time of year for Naples
      and Sorrento?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His face had for her the same colour as the paper he had
      been reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent idea,--personally. Matter of fact--I'm rather
      badly wanted in town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's go home," she repeated, but the word "home" had for
      her a sound of unimaginable dreariness.

      Clare Biddulph had her first sight of Mary the day after
      their return to Hill House.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came down to "Caradoc" in "Ph&oelig;bus," wearing a
      musquash coat that Fream had bought her in Paris. She
      looked older, and quite extraordinarily self-contained. She
      drawled slightly when she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare, unemotional creature that she was, yet felt a
      numbness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well,--here you are. Had a good time? But of course you
      have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly lovely."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary did not look at Clare, but out of the window, and her
      composure was like a white veil. And she was daring Clare
      to lift it, defying her to lift it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A perfectly lovely time. Val had to come back on business.
      We had two days in Paris. He bought me these furs."

      In September "Doomsday" washed its face in the dew and knew
      a second greenness. With the last fortnight of August as
      wet as you please, the resting soil,--refreshed and
      eager,--seemed to rush into a second growth. Furze had
      never seen anything quite like it. The Long Meadow that a
      month ago had been a stretch of cracked brownness had
      lushed up into a young hay crop. The country shook off the
      dust and the heat, and was glad. Old garden flowers took
      heart of grace and set out to bloom a second time. The
      blackberries, little hard red points, swelled into a
      lustrous blackness. September dews were heavy, and the
      sunlight like a yellow wine, and in the dawns Furze saw a
      world of gold and of silver, with Rushy mist-hung, and the
      oaks of Gore Wood catching the early sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A second spring,--a second summer," he thought, but the
      man in him watched and considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up at Carslake, girls, twittering under the old red roof of
      the "George" before blowing out their candles, spoke of the
      eternal adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rose has a man--a lover."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze of "Doomsday," a gentleman lover! She was teased and
      she was envied, and she went about her work with the air of
      a girl who was wise and who had seen reason to be happy.
      She was not a great talker. She had a dignity of her own,
      and did not know it, but she did know that fools abound,
      the men who ask for a whisky or a bottle of beer as though
      they were asking for other things. "Hallo, Rose dear."
      Someone's arm round your waist on the stairs, the most
      unexpected of arms! No, she was a girl who had seen a
      little of life and had remained clean, because she knew
      that when her heart did let itself go the affair would be
      serious, and she wanted a man who would be serious. She was
      a big, gracious, lovable creature. She seemed to grow more
      silent and more grave when the man came to her in the
      person of Arnold Furze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Rosie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening, Mr. So-and-so."
    </p>
    <p>
      She put such bright "gentlemen" in their places, and did it
      quite gently and with good temper, as though they were
      exuberant small boys who had forgotten their manners. They
      said to themselves that Rose Hurley had a handsome and
      swollen head just because a farmer fellow was supposed to
      be a little sweet on her. Vulgar minds and vulgar language.
      The vulgarians were not maggots in the heart of the rose.
      Women have a knack of surprising men, and will always
      surprise them, for it is good for a man that he should
      sometimes fall on his knees and look upwards. The Mother of
      God and of Man is immortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze came up from Bean Acres where he had left the wheel
      plough under a hedge. The two grey horses came with him,
      following like a couple of dogs, sensible beasts who waited
      for the man and master to open and shut gates. Meanwhile
      the man in Furze was opening and shutting gates. He was
      considering more things than the needs of his body, and the
      slipshod activities of Mrs. Sarah. Woman, what was she? A
      broken reed or a distaff, a honey-pot or a cradle?
    </p>
    <p>
      He stabled the horses, unharnessed, watered, and fed them.
      It was not yet tea time, and four o'clock on that
      particular afternoon when a young woman put off her black
      dress and her laced apron, and became--Yes, just what did
      she become? He paused in the stable doorway, and became
      aware of an unusual sound, a sound as of castigation. And
      before him at that moment appeared Will, a Will who hid a
      smile, and looked as solemn as an owl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that noise, Will?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't say, ssir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your wife's not at work to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She be not, ssir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze went up to the house and into it. He saw a woman's
      hat on the sofa. Also, the table had been laid for tea, and
      there was a cake on a dish, a real, live homemade plum
      cake. He caught a glimpse through the open doorway of the
      floor of Mrs. Damaris' parlour, and he realized that it was
      carpetless, and that the boards had been scrubbed. What the
      devil--!
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked into the parlour, but there was no spider there.
      The furniture stood ranged neatly round the walls, and the
      window was wide open, and through it he had a vision of a
      young woman, bare headed and with her sleeves rolled up,
      folding up a carpet on the grass. A hazel rod lay near at
      hand. The sound as of castigation was explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood and watched her for a moment. She picked up the
      folded carpet as though it was no heavier than a
      tablecloth, shook her black hair back, saw him, and stood
      at gaze. Her smile came slowly. She had not expected him
      back so soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you call this a holiday, Rose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He climbed out of the window and jumped, and would have
      taken the carpet from her, but she stood back, and somehow
      gave him to understand that it was not to be touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are back too soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted the floor dry and this carpet down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost she was austere with him, and he wondered why. Was
      it that she had not meant him to find her at work? But why
      should she mind? It was unexpected and gracious of her to
      give him the labour of her hands when she might have been
      on Hastings beach in a muslin frock on the look-out for
      "pick ups."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't say my prayers in public," said she. "You can help
      me down with this carpet. That woman of yours is a slut."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was obedient and thoughtful, but she seemed intent upon
      her job, not looking at him, as though like a man he had
      arrived very much at the wrong moment, and had put her in
      the wrong. She began to rearrange the furniture; he helped
      her, and she accepted his help, but without acknowledging
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last chair was in its place his right arm slipped
      round her and found her rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it--my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something has hurt you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her, but her arms hung stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--has it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Tell."
    </p>
    <p>
      But she would not tell him. She slipped away from his arm
      and into the living-room, and said that the kettle should
      be boiling, and that as she was a bold-faced jig she might
      as well make his tea. And at that he grew deliberate and
      gently determined, and got her beside him again, and spoke
      with his mouth close to her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can tell me, Rose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No,--I can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood talking, and all that he could think of was that
      she had not wished him to know that she was working in his
      house. And why? Did it look too much like a studied effect,
      Arabella's dimple that deceived poor Jude?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I know," he said, "and thank you, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you do know--well--you are not like most men. What
      about that kettle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rose, no secrets between man and wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not that--yet," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may be. I want you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were as dark as night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much? No, I'm not a nasty, sly little bit of a girl.
      If I thought--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you thought--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd never see you again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you will. Because I know--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--you think you know!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do know."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      At tea he talked like a farmer, but a farmer who was also
      her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things are turning out better than I thought. There will
      be more keep for the sheep on the ten acre than looked
      possible three weeks ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad," she said, and he knew that she was glad. He
      went on to talk of the farm, intimately, as to one who was
      wise and concerned and who understood and sympathized. The
      attack of mammitis among the cows had died away, and there
      was only one cow with any induration of the udder. The
      roots were a thin crop, and he would have to buy winter
      feed, but things would not be quite as bad as he had
      feared. He thought of selling half a dozen cows, and buying
      in again next year, and what did she think about it? He had
      done fairly well with his big black pigs and sheep. Yes,
      plenty of stock enriched your land, and saved you from
      having to spend too much money on artificials.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--a man can do much more when he has the money.
      Money and time,--that's what the ordinary man lacks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a fair show," said she; "the farmer does not get a
      fair show. He is sacrificed for the cheap people in the
      towns. They may find it out some day."
    </p>
    <p>
      She wanted to know about his chickens and ducks. Did he do
      much with them? No, he had not the time. She nodded. Of
      course he hadn't,--but a woman might have the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There would be plenty of work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So there would."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way--where did the cake come from, Rose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had it made at home by one of my sisters. The real
      thing; not your cake-powder stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said he, "so much of modern life is just
      cake-powder."
    </p>
    <p>
      Will had been left to begin the milking, and when Furze
      went out to the cow-house she cleared away the tea things
      and washed up. When the milking was done they were going
      over the farm together, and having finished her work she
      went down to the cow-house. There were still two cows to be
      milked, and she made Furze give her his white milking-coat,
      and she took the stool and the pail, and showed him that
      her hands had not lost their cunning. With her dark head
      pressed against a brown flank she emptied the udder, while
      Furze smoked a pipe and looked on. She carried two of the
      pails to the dairy, and in the cool gloom of the
      brick-floored, white-washed room, her skin looked as white
      as the milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a separator?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a very good one. I bought it second-hand. I want a new
      one. I began with cream-pans."
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing looked nicer my old grandmother used to say--than
      a row of cream-pans in a clean dairy,--but machinery saves
      time. I suppose you have thought of buying a tractor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Can't afford it at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something to work for. O, lots of things to work for. That
      makes life good."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cool of the September evening they wandered over the
      farm together. She was rather silent, but her eyes saw
      things, including the rabbits feeding under the edge of
      Gore Wood. They were standing under the old thorn edge of
      the "Gore," and Furze's eyes were on the oaks yellow-domed
      in the evening sunlight. Many of them would have to fall
      that winter, and he was sorry not only for the loss of the
      trees, but because it meant more men about the place, and
      wheel tracks across the Gore, and the lane cut to pieces by
      the wheels of the heavy timber-tugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told Rose that some of the oaks were marked for the
      sawmill. She looked grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pity to sell timber."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's necessity, my dear. I had a lot of things done to the
      house,--and the money is needed."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood mute and thoughtful for some moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much are you counting on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--I suppose a clear hundred or so would set things
      straight."
    </p>
    <p>
      She said very little as they went down to Gore Wood, and
      came back by way of the Long Meadow and the Doom paddock as
      the dusk and the dew came down together. Her face had a
      comely, dreaming tranquillity; her big and gentle eyes were
      very wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a sweet farm," she said as they turned into the
      orchard where the trees were growing very black, and the
      roof and chimneys of the house made an equal blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's my life, my dear. Come and share it--for better or
      for worse, for richer or for poorer."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave herself to the hollow of his arm.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Locked away in a drawer in her bedroom at the "George Inn"
      Rose Hurley kept a little fibre case in which she stored
      her letters, a few pieces of jewellery, her money, and a
      gold watch. Rose was eight and twenty, and she had been
      working for five years, and coming of the country stock she
      had saved money. Yes, quite a pretty sum thanks to her tips
      which had not been lessened by a pleasant voice, dark eyes,
      and clean hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case she kept her Post Office book, and her Savings
      Certificates. She knew to a penny what she had, but that
      night she sat on the edge of her bed, and by candlelight
      considered her fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seventy-five pounds in Savings Certificates. Forty-three
      pounds, seven shillings and ninepence in the Post Office.
      In all £118 7s. 9d. Not so bad for a working girl! And she
      sat there in her nightdress and looked happy. She had
      something to take to "Doomsday" besides herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No need to fell timber."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her next surprise for him, dearly conceived, and
      carried out on her next visit to the farm. She appeared to
      him in a pink and white muslin frock, with white shoes and
      stockings, and a shady hat. Little hats were said to be
      going out, but the littled heads would remain. She sat on
      Arnold's sofa, and smiled at him. A brocade vanity-bag lay
      in her lap. And he thought that he had never seen anything
      more comely and cool and pleasant, with that dark
      gentleness of hers, and the broad and clear wisdom of her
      face. She had come between him and his Cinderella love. He
      had come to love her too, a little differently, with less
      passion perhaps, but with a more confident tenderness. She
      would be so good to live and to sleep with, a strong yet
      restful creature who had some knowledge of what life could
      and could not be.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open your hands and shut your eyes, Jack."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had chosen to call him Jack. Arnold was all very well,
      but Jack came more plainly and gently off the tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's this? More cake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shut your eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He humoured her. He felt something unexpected placed in his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open."
    </p>
    <p>
      A blue-grey envelope and a red-brown-covered book surprised
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My savings, Jack. Take them--for both of us. No need to
      sell those oak trees."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was more touched than she knew, though she could tell by
      his eyes that her surprise had not miscarried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rose,--my dear,--you mustn't--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not? For richer or poorer, dear man. It's not very
      much, not quite a hundred and twenty pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dear thing. Well, it's your farm--anyway--if anything
      should happen to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She held him fast.

      If to be happy is to be comfortable Mrs. Mary Fream had
      nothing to complain of, for Hill House in winter was even
      more comfortable than Hill House in summer. Yet the winter
      began with one week of extreme discomfort, an indescribable
      week when her grandee mounted his horse and made one last
      charge upon stubborn nature. It proved to be a forlorn hope
      and a failure, and between them arose a conspiracy of
      silence, a bargain arranged and sealed without a word being
      uttered. Tacitly he offered her certain advantages, and she
      accepted them. It was a silent compact. She was to be the
      most decorative and live of his possessions, and though
      they occupied rooms with a door that communicated, who was
      to know that her grandee was not man enough to command that
      door.

    <p>
      Self-pity may suggest a more universal pity, and the
      realization of the human fact that we all of us suffer, and
      Fream was very kind to his wife, but inarticulately kind.
      The relationship became rather like that between a
      self-conscious and awkward father and a spoiled child.
      After that last and disastrous excursion into romance he
      seemed to age very rapidly. He tried to redress himself in
      the habits of the last ten years, and he was at least ten
      years older. It was a very humiliating experience, and
      depressing, because he discovered that the destruction of a
      man's male self-confidence may show its effects elsewhere;
      in his work. He had gone back to his work as though to hide
      himself in it, to find a solace and a new self-respect, but
      his work was not quite the same; nor was he. Undoubtedly he
      had a flair for figures, and the curiously cold and
      long-sighted eyes of a money-maker. He had combined a
      careful shrewdness with intuition. Always, he had taken
      great care to reconnoitre the field of action; but the
      final movement had been guided by that intuitive something
      within himself. He had had audacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months after his marriage an enterprising gentleman
      sold him a pup. In vulgar parlance that was what
      happened,--but there may be more in such a happening than
      the mere loss of money. The picking of a pocket is less
      unpleasant than the feeling that you have been fooled, or
      that you were not so sharp as you imagined you were. It was
      the first financial mistake that Percival Fream had made
      for a very long time. It shocked him, and possibly it
      frightened him a little, just as one of those unpleasant
      sensations about the heart frighten a man and make him
      wonder whether his body is all that it should be. The loss
      of two or three thousand pounds was nothing; the first
      sagging of a man's confidence may be everything, and it may
      be that the crumbling of Fream's self-confidence began
      during those days after his marriage. It was a very slow
      affair, like the natural erosion of a cliff, or the
      hardening of a man's arteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fatal Cinderella! How was she to know that Furze had
      thought of her in the end as a woman who brought a man bad
      luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want your cushion, my dear, and that's fatal. Cushions
      should be for the people who have finished with life."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had her cushion, and a very large and comfortable
      cushion it was. She did not say to herself now--"Val is a
      dear"; she said: "Val is so kind." But what a white death
      of a kindness! Her whole day was a cushion. At eight
      o'clock she was brought early tea with two frail slices of
      bread and butter; at half-past eight she put on a
      dressing-gown, and went to the rose marble bathroom, and
      came out of it pink and glowing. She was down in time to
      assist her grandee through his toast and marmalade, and to
      pour out his second cup of coffee. A fire blazed; chafing
      dishes kept things hot; there were two picture-papers, and
      all the weekly magazines on their respective weekly
      birthdays. Her Val went off at 9.30; Ph&oelig;bus carried
      him away to catch the 9.43. With meticulous kindness he
      would kiss the middle of her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enjoy your day, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did enjoy it. Her nursery was still full of toys. One
      Saturday morning early in December a little cerise and
      black coupe had arrived outside the portico, her toy car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, Val, how lovely!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had climbed into it and settled herself in the deeply
      cushioned seat, and tried the pedals and the gear-lever,
      and examined the many gadgets. It was a beautiful little
      car, as exquisitely finished as an enamel trinket box. You
      pressed a button on the dash-board, and a little cabinet
      opened, and offered you face-powder and a mirror, and
      orange sticks, and nail-cream, and a choice of scents.
      Another minute cupboard held a little brocade-covered
      blotter, postcards, note-paper, a fountain-pen and pencils,
      a notebook bound in blue vellum. You had your clock,
      calendar, a letter-box. She had insisted on her husband
      getting into the car with her, and she had driven carefully
      up and down the drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall call her 'Cherry,'--Val."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she had kissed him on one flat white cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a dear to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she could enjoy her day. It was pleasant to drive down
      to Weyfleet in "Cherry" and to know that no other woman in
      the place had quite so exquisite a car. She liked shopping.
      It was pleasant to go into the grocer's and the butcher's,
      and to know by the quick politeness of the tradespeople
      that she was Mrs. Fream of Hill House. Buying things still
      thrilled her, especially the little luxuries that are only
      for the few,--the best grapes, the best peaches, perfumes
      that other women could not afford, flowers, sweets. She had
      joined the Weyfleet Golf Club and was taking lessons from
      the local professional. Two or three times a week she went
      up to town, and "Cherry" was parked in St. James's Square,
      while my lady took a dancing lesson and shopped and had tea
      at the "Ermine Club." Weyfleet played much "bridge," but
      Mary found herself such a brown bunny at the game and lost
      so much fur to the old soldiers that she had to ask Clare
      to coach her. Clare lost very little to anyone. Then there
      were the weekly dances at the Hills Club. You could be as
      smart as your husband pleased, and thanks to Clare's taste
      Mary was very smart. Val did not dance, but the buoyant
      Leslie was an expert,--and there were other experts, young
      stockbrokers and business men. Mrs. Fream became a partner
      to be desired. Other women began to say carefully unkind
      things about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did it matter? She did not hear what was said. She
      held her cake in both hands. Her husband came to the
      dances, and sat or stood with a perfectly expressionless
      face, and paid for champagne, and retreated at times to the
      card-room. The youth of the young men jostled him. He would
      stand stiffly in corners, and try to smile at Mary's
      partners, and appear the complaisant fellow. He could not
      express himself even to himself. Anyway, no other woman was
      more exquisitely gowned than his woman. He liked to collect
      a supper party and order them most expensive champagne. He
      wished there were other ways in which his money could be
      made to express itself. Yes, to dominate the world, and
      dazzle a poor little Cinderella who was more of a Delilah
      than she knew. Her inarticulate Samson had not much hair to
      lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner one evening he made a suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We ought to give a dance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Val,--I'd love it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A real swagger dance. Show these people something. What!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, or at the club."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--here. More scope--you know. Something original. What
      about New Year's Eve?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid. Couldn't we make it a bal masque?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We all wear masks, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were wearing them already, and did not know it.

    <p>
      Meanwhile, Clare Biddulph kept three cool fingers on the
      pulse of her sister's marriage. That the marriage was not
      an emotional success seemed to her fairly obvious. Mary was
      a warm-hearted creature, and not a little impulsive, but
      too warm a heart may prove disastrous. Moreover it is not
      wise to deliver homilies to a young woman who happens to be
      very much in love with herself, and very full of her house
      and her wardrobe and her jewellery and her car. Mary had a
      very pretty swollen head; she was Mrs. Fream of Hill House;
      her smartness was growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare touched the relationship coolly. There were certain
      things that she wished to say to Mary, but she doubted the
      ripeness of the soil. Platitudes are truths that are always
      being rediscovered, but there are certain platitudes with
      which a married woman of experience is familiar, but which
      cannot be breathed over to dear friends. A woman may write
      of such things in her diary, but she will keep that diary
      under lock and key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare wanted to say to Mary--"When you are very young--my
      dear--you may suffer from that zymotic disease called
      idealism. You think that butterflies' wings matter, and
      kisses, and moonlight, and Tennyson--and all that; but the
      one thing that matters is money. Materialism, my dear,
      intelligent materialism. For unless you happen to be one of
      those curious creatures called artists there is no beauty
      for you without money. It is the lining of your nest, the
      fire in your life's house, the nice perfume in your
      wardrobe. Without money life is a sweaty business; it does
      not smell nice; it loses its figure; its breasts flop and
      its tummy protrudes; its feet are flat; it is apt to run to
      red noses and to little twists of hair stuck on like a blob
      at the back of your head. Its ankles thicken. It travels
      third class, and is always in a crowd; and it carries pulpy
      vegetables home in a basket, and drinks too much tea, and
      sits in the sixpenny seats at the picture-house. A frowsy
      baggage, my dear, good and hard-working--and all
      that--but--ye gods--how ugly. Without money--no space--no
      pleasant aloofness--neither room nor leisure to be
      yourself. Don't be a sentimentalist. Cherish your money--my
      dear--and the man who makes it."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her husband--however--who suggested sisterly
      intervention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She ought to be told not to dance quite so much--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With young Pagan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, Pagan and other chaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare knew that it was young Dick Pagan who had sinned
      against Leslie's kindly code. Pagan was a good-looking but
      wooden-faced young man with a rather insolent blue eye, a
      very erect head and neatly squared shoulders. His
      unpopularity with most of the older men was quite
      extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pup--you know,--but with the cheek of the devil. A young
      cad too. Been talking in the train."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sanders told me. O,--well never mind what he said. Perhaps
      you can guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare could guess. She knew the Pagan type. It was good at
      games; it was full of fleshly assurance, and quite ruthless
      in taking what it wanted. Clare divided the adventurous
      males into two classes; she called them the silk-merchants
      and the butchers. Leslie was a silk-merchant, a kindly,
      good-natured trader who would never push a bargain to its
      inevitable conclusion. The butchers were different, though
      your complete and consistent butcher was not often met
      with, the young man who cut the throat of a woman's desire,
      dabbled his hands in the blood of it, and left the carcase
      lying derelict.
    </p>
    <p>
      She agreed with Leslie. Mary ought to be warned against
      young butchers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could imagine the chap in a blue coat, cutting up
      joints with a cleaver. Even his face--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hard and brown--and rather red. No playee--with the
      butcherly boyee--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She set about it delicately. Her lamb was a very holy lamb,
      and it carried a little flag. You had to remember the flag
      and the inscription upon it--"I am Mrs. Percival Fream of
      Hill House." Yes, Mary was taking herself very seriously,
      and this very seriousness could be starched against all
      young Pagans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare knew that it is not wise to tell another woman to
      snub a particular man. The result may be obtained more
      nicely by snubbing him yourself in her presence. She may
      ask you the question: "Why did you snub the poor boy like
      that?" Then the wise woman can get in her bodkin thrust,
      and these thrusts may save souls. "O,--that--young
      cat's-meat merchant!" You drawled the words with casual
      serenity. "No, my dear, that sort of young man bores me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps you wrapped it up a little more delicately in
      silver paper. The important thing was that you should show
      no animus, but only show up the butcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, it happened just as Clare had intended it should happen
      at one of the Hills Club dances a week or so before
      Christmas. And after it had happened, young Pagan, with a
      nasty look in his blue eyes, and his wooden face in the air
      like the face of a ship's figure-head, supposed to Mary
      when she danced with him that Mrs. Biddulph did not like
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Told me off, didn't she."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked sympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps your steps don't match."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She doesn't like me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite truculent about it, and then grew rather sulky
      and silent, and came up half an hour later with the obvious
      purpose of extracting the lamb from under Mrs. Clare's
      protecting petticoats. Yes, and be damned to her!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lamb proved shy. There had been an adjournment to
      the ladies' room and a powdering of noses. "Why did you
      snub Mr. Pagan?" Clare had aimed at a quick impression. She
      had smiled at herself in the glass. "Me no dancee with
      butcher-boyee."--"My dear!"--"Well it bores me. Pups are
      boring enough--but bad pups!--No--thankee." An impression
      swiftly conveyed from woman to woman, and registered for
      future use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence Mrs. Fream had a dignified headache, and young Pagan
      went off, damning Mrs. Clare for a jealous cat. Of course
      Pompous Percival's wife was fair game. She had married the
      chap for his money. If he--Pagan--did not get her into his
      meat-tray some other butcher-boy would.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary's headache was productive. It flowed in the card-room
      where her husband was losing money at "bridge," and
      wondering at the abominable hands he held.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Val--I have such a headache--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, would you like to go home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have the car sent round."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fream went out on her husband's arm.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Hill House dance was to be a very swagger affair. Black
      silk masks were to be worn, but Mrs. Fream would supply the
      masks. There would be boxes of them in the cloak-room, and
      you took a mask just as you took a programme. It was
      suggested that each lady and gentleman should choose a
      letter, Mr. A,--or Miss Z.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But of course," said Clare; "half the men will want to be
      Mr. X. Still, let it go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick Danvers' Jazz Band was coming down from town. Bunter's
      were to do the supper. The billiard-room and the hall were
      to be cleared for dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fream was full of ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight a huge bowl of rum-punch would be placed in the
      middle of the dancing-floor, and Mary, dressed as the new
      year, would with a ladle of silver fill the guests'
      glasses. He suggested that the old year should be
      represented by a couple of stout lads functioning as the
      fore-legs and hind-legs of an ass, and that the ass should
      draw a coster's barrow full of presents for the ladies.
      "Real turnips and carrots and cabbages, you know, with
      presents inside them." Mary thought it a lovely idea. And
      who would distribute the presents? Fream smirked. He would.
      Twenty years ago he had fancied himself as a coster; he had
      the clothes, he had gone to fancy dress dances in them.
      Pearly buttons--you know. But he had another idea which he
      kept to himself. Among other things he had collected coins;
      he had a couple of dozen English sovereigns of various
      dates; these should be sown on his coat in place of the
      pearly buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was full of her dance. She and Val would show Weyfleet
      just what Hill House could do. She invited about a hundred
      people, and when Clare pointed out that the letters of the
      alphabet would not go round, Mary said that some of her
      guests could wear numbers, those who came late.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As though they had escaped from the cloak-room!"
    </p>
    <p>
      During the supper dance there was to be a joyous rag, with
      toy balloons and serpentines and flowers and confetti. Then
      the champagne would flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to wear, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary told him that she had a special frock coming down from
      "Isabeaus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid I've been a bit extravagant, Val."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make the other chaps' wives look shabby," said he, "that's
      the spice and the pepper."

      Mary sent Christmas presents to "Green Shutters," a box of
      cigars for her father, a fur wrap for Mrs. Charlotte, and a
      pink jumper for Cousin Nellie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother's Christmas letter contained a piece of news
      that affected her unpleasantly. Almost it destroyed her
      appetite for her New Year's festa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Furze has married a girl who was a waitress at 'The
      George' at Carslake. We all think it rather a pity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just that! And Mary was angry and contemptuous and peeved.
      Poor Arnold! A common waitress, a girl with red hands, who
      would giggle and say "Oo-er!" How very sordid of him!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet--perhaps--she herself was a little to blame. No
      doubt he had married his waitress out of pique.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt sorry and she felt insulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, she could still smell that hay-cock in spite of
      Rimmell and Coty.

    <p>
      On that New Year's Eve, from the warm firelit hollow of the
      Hill House library Mary saw the sun set over the park. It
      vanished as a redness in a mass of amethyst cloud,
      outlining for a space the figure of the dancing faun, and
      giving a golden bloom to the grass. A bluish gloom flowed
      in, and the figure of the faun grew dim. She sat in front
      of the fire and felt regal. Even the sunset had coloured
      the day for her, and added to the distinction of the
      scenery. A pleasant activity made itself felt in the house.
      Val was coming down by the five o'clock train. In an hour
      or so she would go up to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that is how she would have described her mood of the
      moment; she felt regal. Success shone upon her forehead.
      She saw herself the centre of a gay crowd, exquisitely
      gowned, receiving homage, conscious of envy. She alone
      among all the women would wear no mask, for a hostess could
      not be masked when she ascended her little social throne
      and looked brightly round. In the mirror of her own
      self-consciousness she was essentially Mrs. Percival Fream
      of Hill House. The night and the occasion were hers; she
      was a little dazzled by herself, in love with herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, she rang for Jessup. It was very pleasant to
      exercise authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--Jessup,--I want to see Bunter's man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw him. He came and stood deferentially before her,
      big and flabby and fair. She questioned him closely. She
      hoped that he understood that there was to be no sparing of
      the champagne. He assured her that the arrangements were
      perfect; there would be no hitch,--there could be no hitch.
      His bland deference made her feel still more regal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Jessup came to say that Mr. Danvers had
      arrived with his band, and that he wished to see the lady
      of the house. Certainly; she wished to see Mr. Danvers.
      Fream had returned, and had gone up to dress so that he
      should be ready to inspect all the arrangements. He and
      Mary were dining in the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Danvers was introduced, a little, dark, alert man,
      rather too well dressed, and with too much silk
      handkerchief protruding from his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand you are using both the billiard-room and the
      hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not address her as madam, and she took to herself
      some of Clare's manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. We are having fifty couples. You will place
      your band where the music can be heard in both rooms."
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed very stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About the programme--you are to cut out a waltz in each
      half. I expect there will be a number of extras."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There usually are."
    </p>
    <p>
      She allowed him to see a cool profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way--there are five--performers--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Musicians, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many saxophones?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two saxophones, a piano, a violin, a cello."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cut out one of the saxophones. Can he play anything else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A violin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him play a violin. The saxophone is overdone."
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt still more regal when she had disposed of Mr.
      Richard Danvers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o'clock she went up to dress, assisted by Pollock
      her maid. She looked a pretty creature, but it was her
      ambition to be more than pretty. She sat in front of the
      glass while Pollock, who was a trained coiffeuse, attended
      to her hair. She looked at herself in the mirror and
      thought of poor Furze. She rather wished that Arnold could
      see her to-night before going back to his waitress. He
      would be able to appreciate differences. She would like to
      picture him looking in at a window and watching her dancing
      or playing the charming hostess. Poor Arnold! But how very
      sordid of him! To give his broken heart into a pair of red
      hands. Did his waitress giggle and say "Oo-er" when he
      kissed her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Impossible people, rustics!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pollock was asking her what scent she would use.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, Jasmin de Corse--I think, Pollock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Even the fastidious Clare allowed that the Fream dance was
      very well done. The Freams and the Biddulphs were allies,
      and the shine of the one was the shine of the other.
      Leslie, that Sun in Taurus, was joyous and emphatic.
      "Top-hole show. Good floor, good band, rattling good
      supper, plenty of first-class fizz. And atmosphere, old
      thing, atmosphere."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was right. The Hill House dance had an atmosphere. It
      glowed pleasantly from the first fox-trot, and when it
      reached the supper-dance it radiated a gentle brilliancy
      that suffused itself into the champagne. People warmed to
      each other. "Really, what a charming crowd! And a charming
      house, and a charming hostess. And--by Jove--some frock on
      her." Fream's donkey and coster's cart set the world
      rolling; the donkey frisked; Fream distributed carrots and
      cabbages and turnips from which were extracted pretty
      powder-boxes, and bottles of choice scent, and jade and
      amber pendants. Even Fream's gold buttons were forgiven
      him. He wore his sovereigns, and his wife felt more and
      more regal. The dutiful ass provided a climax. When Mary
      had served rum-punch to everybody, and they had made a
      circle about her and sung Auld Lang Syne, the ass made an
      effort to kneel before her, but becoming unbalanced in its
      interior, rolled over and lay as though expiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men cheered. Masks had been taken on long ago, but
      there continued to be about ten Mr. X's who insisted on
      remaining vizored. The ass was assisted to its feet. Its
      hinder portion contained a certain lad who should not have
      been at the party, but who had been smuggled in the place
      of a disappointing husband. Fream, calling for two
      volunteers in the cloak-room, had in his egregious
      innocence had this young spark fastened upon him. It was
      Mr. Richard Pagan who went into the hind-quarters of the
      ass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, he provided a climax of his own, a purely personal
      climax. Still masked, despite champagne and his adventures
      in donkeydom, he danced twice with his hostess. The lad had
      had his hair dyed black. Even Clare did not detect him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Done you, Mrs. Biddulph!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Irresponsible butcher-boy!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, Mrs. Fream,--this show of yours is it. And you
      don't know me from Adam."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not. No Pagan had been invited; no such young
      barbarian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, let's sit out this one. Sure you must be tired.
      Don't look it--of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't sit out with a Mr. X."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, yes, you can; come along."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was feeling a little less consciously regal, and wholly
      triumphant. She allowed him to take her to a corner of the
      conservatory that was dimly lit by red Japanese lanterns.
      He found a sofa for two behind palms and a young mimosa.
      And there, with a sort of insolent and appreciative
      deliberation, he put a sudden arm round her--and kissed her
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was surprised at her fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cad--! Who are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He took off his mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's me. Don't cut up so rough--and pretend--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood up, trembling, outraged, she the great young Lady
      of Hill House, his hostess, Mrs. Percival Fream, perhaps
      Lady Fream, caught and mouthed on a sofa by a blackguard
      boy! And her neck too!
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will leave the house. At once please--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her breath came quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up, sulky and savage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humbug. Everybody knows--my dear. If a woman marries a
      cheque-book in trousers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave the house," she said; "how dare you say such
      things."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The night's triumph was tarnished. She went to bed at some
      impossible hour in the morning, very tired, yet not too
      tired to be conscious of a horrible feeling of insecurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a man should have dared to treat her like that in her
      own house and on such a night, and to blurt out the exact
      truth! Young beast that he was, and yet so brutally right,
      and more honest in the face of his lust than she was in the
      face of her pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how absurd to be made to feel so insecure by such an
      incident! And why? And ought she to tell her husband, or
      Clare? No, insults were best kept hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got to sleep after an hour of agitation, and of
      weariness, and she did not wake till Pollock brought her
      her morning tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A happy new year, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was half awake and a little bewildered. The new year?
      O, yes. And of course it was going to be happy. Her dance
      had been a delightful success, but why had that blackguard
      boy kissed her?

    <p>
      It was a September night, and a moon was shining, and
      Arnold Furze went out into the orchard, though why he went
      there he did not know. Perhaps he went because the shadows
      drew him, and the obscure solitudes under the old trees,
      and perhaps because he would be so very much alone there
      with his own terrible loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was seven days since her death, seven days of a numb
      sort of bewilderment and of an inexpressible anguish, of
      things dimly realized in the midst of the day's inevitable
      work. Beasts have to be looked to and cows milked even when
      a woman is lying dead. He had gone dully through the
      familiar routine, and yet finding in it a poignant
      strangeness, an almost meaningless futility. And only a
      week ago she had helped him to milk those cows.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper on this September night the full realization
      of all that her death meant to him seemed to break like
      that rain cloud on the day when she had come to him wet and
      laughing through Bean Acres. And what a death, so wanton
      and so preventible! A half-intoxicated road-hog week-ending
      along the Hastings road on a Saturday evening, and Rose,
      cycling back from Carslake and caught where the Melhurst
      and Rotherbridge roads met. She had died the same night,
      died in her man's arms, after two years or so of happy
      comradeship. And Furze! Furze had looked at her lying dead,
      and then--with a perfectly white face--had hunted out his
      old service-revolver and loaded it. He had gone out of the
      house and half-way up the road to Carslake with the
      intention of shooting the drunken swine who had killed his
      wife. The fellow, who had put up at "The George", and was
      drinking hard, had assured everybody that the smash had
      been no fault of his. But half-way up the road Furze had
      faltered and turned back. It was as though his dead wife
      had called him. "Don't touch the poor sot, Jack; life is
      not worth it." He had sat down in a dry ditch and had
      played with the pistol. No--not, that! No cowardliness of
      that sort. She had never shown any cowardice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now--he was alone. He found himself leaning against an old
      apple tree whose trunk forked about four feet from the
      ground, and in this fork his body came to rest. He hung
      there, staring at the moon through the foliage. He faced
      his loneliness as he faced the moon. It came to him in
      splintered patches like the light through the foliage,
      little--broken spasms of consciousness, separate yet part
      of the same aliveness. The presence of her had passed. When
      he went back to the house there would be no one to whom he
      could cry "Girl." And if he called there would be no
      answer. One of his shirts that she had been mending still
      lay neatly folded on the sofa, and he had left it there.
      And gone were all these other intimate breathings, the
      warmth and the softness and the sweet smell of her, and the
      way she would draw his head down on to her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damn it,--he could not sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he did sleep he woke up like a little, lonely boy
      crying for his mother. O, and more than that. Like a man
      whose body had been torn open. The heart of him had gone,
      or had turned to water.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt desolate, bitter, rather helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those two years they had gone through so much together.
      She had saved his pride in his job, his good temper, those
      trees in Gore Wood. He had re-christened it "Rose Wood,"
      and Rose Wood it would remain. Moreover she had saved his
      money, those precious pounds wrung from the soil, and had
      cheered him and worked with him through a bad year. Brave,
      gracious, practical Rose. He felt now that she had
      gone--that he could not sow his winter corn. Let the seed
      stay in the bin. And it hurt him to milk the cows whose
      udders had been emptied by her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what a tragedy,--his tragedy!
    </p>
    <p>
      The year had been a good one; they had bought a new bedroom
      carpet, a new seed drill and other machinery; the
      living-room and Mrs. Damaris' parlour had been papered and
      painted. And they had decided to have a child. Their child
      had been conceived two months ago. The sot in the car had
      killed that also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze felt bitter, though bitterness salves no wound, and
      he knew it. But he wanted to feel bitter,
      because--somehow--he wanted to get back at fate, at the
      thing--whatever it was--behind the phenomenon of
      consciousness--that had struck at him. He wanted to strike
      back, to throw his bomb back at circumstance or God or the
      Devil, just as in the war he had thrown his shells at the
      Germans. Childish--perhaps, but at times there is a relief
      in childishness. Without it a man may go mad or become
      religious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cinderella a pale dream, Bobbo dead, Rose dead! What had he
      left but the farm, "Doomsday"? By God, "Doomsday" was a
      good name for it. Why not make it his doom, a battlefield
      upon which to fight the god of all cussedness and
      interference? Man's eternal fight. To succeed, to get goods
      and money, to be able to toss a bad halfpenny in Nature's
      face, and cock his head and mock at her. "Ha--you She-dog,
      back to your kennel. I'm master; the man is master."
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him that it was necessary for a tiller of the
      soil to be hard. He knew that he was going to be very
      lonely. While Rose was with him he had never felt hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--my dear," he thought, and hung in the fork of the
      apple tree like a man on a cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ's cross. And Christ had forgiven. Yes, but Golgotha
      had been something of a stage. Old Peter--now! Ready to
      strike with a sword. And circumstance had sent a lying,
      swinish sot in the chariot of progress to drive over his
      love and his happiness. Ha, in the old British days he
      would have driven a spear through the charioteer's belly.
      But these were not the old British days, but days of
      sensibility and formal snivellings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze felt weary. Grief may be a gentle weariness, but
      bitterness exhausts like a scorching sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised himself from the fork of the tree. He would go to
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that bed,--her bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slept on the sofa, with the shirt, that she had mended,
      under his head.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The work on a farm goes on. Beasts have to be fed and
      watered, cows milked, the fields ploughed, roots pulled and
      clamped. The orchard was full of apples, and Rose had had
      her eyes upon those apples. She had meant to gather most of
      them herself and to store the best keepers in one of the
      attics so that they should fetch a better price towards
      Christmas. So Furze got up before dawn, and added apple
      gathering to the sorrowful heaviness of the day, for Rose
      would have picked those apples, and he would pick them for
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dusk--at the end of a long day--he would hear apples
      falling in the orchard, with an occasional soft thud upon
      the grass. It was like a blow struck upon his heart. He
      would go on gathering fruit until he could not see. What
      did it matter? He could not sleep as he had slept beside
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ragwort was all gold; the bracken stood shoulder high,
      and in the hedges the brambles were studded with black
      fruit. O, these September days, and the early days of
      October, still and golden, with mist in the mornings and
      the grass and hedgerows all grey with dew. Beautiful sweet
      moisture,--and in his heart was a sound of wailing. And
      Will's wife came up to the house wearing that same old cap,
      with her sly eyes and her red-tipped nose. Her activities
      mocked him. He felt that he could not touch the food that
      her nasty little shiny red hands had fingered; nor could he
      bear her to touch what Rose had touched. He sent her away.
      He would go back to the old days of three years ago, and
      rub along like a backwoodsman, eating any sort of food,
      sleeping between blankets, shaving twice a week. What did
      it matter? The sweetness had gone out of his life. He was
      nothing but a fighter, sweaty and hot and grim, with his
      hand on Nature's throat while her claws tore at his belly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were happenings that made him laugh strange laughter.
      To him one day when he was up an apple tree came a precise
      and snuffy little old man in a grey suit. The little man
      stood under the apple trees, and looked up at Furze with
      eyes as blue and as cold as a seagull's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze listened to him, an apple in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road-hog had been censured at the inquest. Yes,
      certainly. The police should have taken up the case.
      Manslaughter--obviously. But had not Mr. Furze considered
      the question of a civil action.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so?" asked the man in the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I presume, sir,--that your wife--the wife of a working
      farmer--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--she was of use to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so. You have been deprived--most cruelly deprived of
      the services of your wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True. She helped with the milking, and made butter, and
      did the housework."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Obviously a case for damages, most ample compensation. A
      certainty, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--that I am to get damages from a drunken cad--for
      the death of my wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man tilted his head and looked prim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sentiment apart, a most gross case. The fellow is a man of
      some substance. In fact--we might not have to take the
      matter into court. A little pressure--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the tree was silent. His silence lasted a
      quarter of a minute. Then the apple in his hand smashed
      itself on the ground at the little man's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes in the evening Furze would open his piano and try
      to play it, but there were some of Rose's songs on the top
      of the piano, and he would end by sitting hunched up and
      silent on the chair. Music,--sweet sounds,--her voice! A
      night came--when in a moment of savage pain--he brought a
      fist down upon the keys, and things broke. Music and rhythm
      indeed, and a voice that sang in his dreams! He went out
      into Mrs. Damaris' garden and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      People talked about him. Mrs. Sarah started the gossip,
      because he had turned her out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't go nigh the place,--no, not if he were to go
      down on his knees to me. It's my belief he's gone queer in
      his head."
    </p>
    <p>
      Other people noticed the change in him, though Will spoke
      up for his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Powerful fond of her he was. And she were a good wife. No
      terrifyin' tongue. Maybe a man may be allowed to grieve--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He shut his wife up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ain't no sense. Mrs. Furze was a woman as a man would
      miss. You shut that b--y mouth o' yourn."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tradesmen at Carslake would see Furze come into their shops
      on Saturday evenings, carrying an old haversack, and
      looking as though he had lost something and would thank no
      one for trying to find it for him. He had lost his
      smartness. It was obvious that he did not bother because he
      did not care. What the use of a new clean collar when there
      was no one to see it, at least no one who mattered?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and again old Hesketh Viner came to the farm. He was
      growing very feeble, and Furze was gentle to old Viner.
      They had not much to say to each other, but would sit in a
      couple of chairs before the fire--if there was a fire--and
      smoke and drop occasional remarks to each other. Their
      silences were pregnant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life's a funny business, my dear fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze's face suggested that it was a very grim one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems a damned silly business at times, sir. One
      wonders why it was in the war one was afraid of dying."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and again he gathered little fragments of news of
      Cinderella. She came once or twice a year to Cinder Town,
      drove her car down, but stopped only two or three days. It
      appeared that Mrs. Fream was a very busy young woman,
      though what she was busy about Arnold could not imagine.
      No, she had no children, but a house full of servants.
      Wealthy--yes--very. Old Hesketh supposed that Mary had many
      social duties; both his daughters appeared to have many
      social duties. Leslie Biddulph, one of his sons-in-law, was
      nursing a suburban constituency, and Clare was assisting
      with the bottle. Yes, he and Mrs. Charlotte had been to
      stay with the Freams, but had not enjoyed the visit. Old
      Viner did not say so, but Furze gathered that the Fream
      household had not suited Mary's father. It had been
      altogether too busy and big for him; too full of
      meaningless activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it seemed that Mary had everything that should make her
      happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze thought of her sometimes, especially if he happened
      to be near Rose Wood. And he would think of her just a
      little scornfully, and bow his head in memory of the other
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough Furze was more in Mary's thoughts than she
      was in his. She had a curious grudge against him, a
      little--sore--tender spot under her new smart serenity. She
      had heard that poor Arnold had lost his waitress. What an
      unlucky fellow he was! Or should she consider it fortunate?
      And there had been no children.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would allow herself to wonder what the man of the
      hay-cock was making of life. Did he still love the farm,
      and that deplorably picturesque old house?
    </p>
    <p>
      For it had a picturesqueness, something that haunted her,
      something that was a little frightening. It sat there among
      its woods and fields, and watched and waited, like a
      blind-eyed old woman who could cast a spell.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Then the winter came, and Furze seemed to grow thinner and
      more hard. He went about his work with a deliberate and
      silent sombreness, like a beast coming out and going in,
      shaggy looking, austere, stodging through the mud and the
      muck of the byres, with rain upon his face, and the north
      wind in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the darkness shut him in, and the beasts had been
      milked and fed, and there was nothing more for him to do,
      he sat and thought many thoughts before the fire. Too much
      loneliness may mean too much thinking. Also,--his working
      bench had come back into the living-room, and he would
      patch boots and mend harness, and sharpen tools, and do
      some desultory carpentering. Or he would go out into the
      wood lodge and hang up a lantern and saw wood, laying log
      after log upon the sawing-stool, his head bent, his moving
      arm opening and shutting a patch of light upon the lodge
      wall. Sometimes a restlessness would possess him, and he
      would wander along the wet dark roads,--but there were
      motors here, rushing past in the darkness, splashing up
      mud, with the blinding arrogance of their great eyes. Once,
      when one of these cars drove him nearly into a ditch, he
      picked up a stone from a heap of road metal and threw it.
      He could not hear a car without feeling a dull anger
      glowing in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day was much like every other day, save that one was
      more wet than another, or more windy, or there seemed more
      mud about. It was a wet winter, with one short spell of
      frost before Christmas, and the sun invisible for days on
      end. A grey sky, pressing low, seemed to rest on the tops
      of the beeches of Beech Ho. The farm tracks were rutty
      quagmires; the brook overflowed the Long Meadow, and in the
      marshes below Rotherbridge the floods were out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze's heavy boots were caked with clay. He dried them in
      front of the fire at night, and cleaned and greased them
      once a week. Days passed without his getting out of his
      working clothes into one of the suits that his wife used to
      fold and put away in the camphored chest of drawers. He
      went about the farm in the wet weather with a sack over his
      shoulders. The house seemed likely to become the house of a
      sloven, or rather--the home of a man who had cared too much
      and who now could not bother to care at all, save that Mrs.
      Damaris's parlour was left to the dust, and that the big
      bedroom above it was never used by him. He kept it locked.
      It remained just as she had left it, with the same sheets
      on the bed, and her clothes hanging in the cupboard, and
      her shoes ranged under the dressing-table. A lace cap hung
      on the mirror; her ebony hairbrushes and comb lay on the
      table, and hanging from a hook on the door--and half hidden
      by a rose-coloured dressing-jacket--was the yellow jumper
      she had worn that day when she had come to him through the
      rain. Pathetic patch of colour, a little faded now, and
      frayed at the cuffs, for she had used it at her work, but
      vivid as ever as a piece of emotional colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze entered this room once a week,--on a Sunday, and
      using an old silk handkerchief, brushed the dust from her
      shoes, and from the brushes and mirror, and looked at her
      clothes, and laid a hand gently upon her pillow. There was
      no doubt about his being in danger of becoming an eccentric
      sort of person, a man of one idea, and of one set mood that
      was like the winter sky, and of the same quality of sombre
      greyness. He had nothing in his life but work, and he asked
      for nothing else but work. Occasionally he attended
      Carslake market, or drove a wagon to the station. He smoked
      many pipes, but drank no liquor. The labour of the farm
      sufficed him, the daily round, the stodging through the
      mud, the carting out of muck and the carting in of fuel,
      contact with his beasts. He did not raise his eyes above
      the level of his work, for there seemed nothing else to
      which he could raise them. He asked to come in tired at
      night and to be able to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes when he was shaving he would look at himself a
      little curiously in the mirror. Was this the man who had
      hoped so much, and who had been so happy? Yes, and without
      realizing the full and pleasant flavour of his happiness.
      He had a few grey hairs over his temples; he looked shaggy;
      the barber up at Carslake saw him perhaps once in two
      months. And there were times when his face seemed to be the
      face of another man, of a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      How old was he? How long was life going on? But why ask
      such a question? His life was the farm, and farms went on
      for ever and ever, and like Time with a scythe, man bent to
      the toil till his teeth fell from him, and his back became
      bowed and rigid. Years hence he might be an old man,
      mumping through the mud, and pushing a hoe in the same
      field, and looking at trees and grass that had not changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life, the life of the soil went on, and man was carried
      with it like a piece of clay on a wheel.

      The garden was full of moths, and the uses of moths are
      various. They provide men with nice similes; they lay eggs
      in his clothes, and breed caterpillars for his fruit trees,
      and they flutter at night in at his windows, or dance in
      the glare of his headlights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fream had ordained a moth-party. It happened on a warm
      night in September. Electricians had run wires about the
      Hill House garden, and little lights glowed among the
      bushes and the trees, and outlined the paths, so that the
      lawns were dark spaces where the human moths fluttered up
      and down. The dancing faun had a silver star on his
      forehead. The fountain playing above the lily pool had
      lights ingeniously arranged about it, so that it threw
      drops of liquid silver and gold. Between the dances people
      wandered out, the men strangely dim and part of the
      darkness, the women like ghosts, moths, or moving flowers,
      just as it pleased your fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said someone to a friend--"These shows must cost Fream a
      pretty penny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His wife--you know. Charming extravagance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And poor Percival pays."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, he likes it. It is that sort of man's only
      hobby."
    </p>
    <p>
      Chairs placed à deux gave rise to many conversations but
      the darkness was elusive and might be treacherous. Clare
      Biddulph had a venerable young person in tow, one of those
      men of affairs who could be of great use to Leslie, and she
      intended to use him, and the venerable person--having a
      quick understanding and a nice sense of humour--knew that
      he was to be used. When a pretty woman dances with you
      twice, and you are sixty-five! Well--why not? Politics was
      a great game; he had manipulated people, and had suffered
      manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say that I can get Newbury to speak for your
      husband--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really delightful of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, not at all. I shall see Newbury to-morrow. By the
      way,--there is a certain little phenomenon that piques me.
      Wonder if you have noticed it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare's alert and graceful head showed against a hanging
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Physical or otherwise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Up there, in a line with that cypress. If we go straight
      on we shall pass close to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Below the terrace wall ran a broad herbaceous border and a
      grass path, and as the two approached the end of the path
      the Venerable extended a shadowy hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Up there." She saw a little red dot in the darkness,
      slightly to one side of the black spire of a cypress, and
      glowing in the centre of a something that was more
      substantial than the September sky. They surveyed it, and
      turned and walked a little way in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What children! But what did you make of it, dear lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The red end of a cigar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. With the ash knocked off it. Isn't there some
      sort of pepper-pot or garden house--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A brick belvedere with a window. One each end of the
      terrace, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      The venerable person looked at the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man--all alone--smoking a cigar--and leaning out of the
      window of a brick pepper-pot. I have taken this walk with
      three different partners, and each time I have seen that
      red dot up there. Once--not quite so bright; half an inch
      of ash on the cigar. Now--why should one be curious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mischievously curious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. In one's old age--my dear lady--one grows more
      cunning, and also more mischievous. A phase of second
      childhood,--what!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It means that you will always be young."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very charming of you. But--curiosity--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Asks to be satisfied--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I hear the band."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My next partner can remain unsatisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that fair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is--my husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--well--! So we go up to the terrace?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And along it to the belvedere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All--to discover--who a man is--all alone--smoking
      cigars--for quite two hours. It may be a chauffeur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do chauffeurs smoke cigars? Even in these days--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything is possible to progress."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went, ascending a flight of steps and moving over the
      velvet pile of a grass path, they came to the little brick
      pepper-pot, and paused, with the scent of a cigar drifting
      to them. The doorway of the belvedere was opposite the
      narrow window, and something obscured the grey panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose," said the venerable person with a voice that
      addressed both Mrs. Biddulph and the September night,
      "there must be a fine view from there. The park--and the
      Surrey hills in the distance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, the view is really quite good--on a clear day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice idea--that--framing a view in a window. So that one
      does not see too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life--consists--of not seeing too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we say--seeing what you want to see. That
      gazebo,--and the stars over the park trees. It intrigues
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a mischievous movement towards the doorway of the
      belvedere, and a man came out. The height and the
      narrowness of him were distinctive. A little red dot glowed
      in the lower third of the dim flatness of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, sir," said the venerable person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The darkness hid a little pucker of speculation on Clare's
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's you, Val!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there in silence, half turned towards the
      venerable person.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lots of stars to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The celestial electricians. It is my host--I think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so," said Fream in a voice that was curiously dead.

      The lady of Hill House danced, but she took care to see
      that all her guests had partners. She was an admirable
      hostess, beautifully gowned, moving with an air of languid
      serenity, pleasantly sure of herself. She had grown more
      like her sister, and it is possible that she had found in
      Clare social features that were of value and worthy of
      imitation. But she was dusky and a little mysterious where
      Clare was all pale gold and calmly vivid. Even when she
      employed sarcasm--and she had learnt to employ it--it
      suggested a red damask rose exuding a cold drop of dew from
      its petals. Her air of languor gave her time to set herself
      in a proper aspect to meet all happenings, yet a part of
      her languor was physical as well as mental. She had grown a
      little bored with life, but would not allow it, and to
      prove the fallaciousness of the feeling she created new
      extravagances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet competition in Weyfleet had ceased, the kind of
      competition that the Freams provoked. Easily they were
      supreme in the matter of motor-cars and parties, and in all
      the pleasant pomps of the dinner-table, and the ballroom.
      Mary wore more dresses than any other woman in the place,
      and wore them more convincingly. All her details were
      worthy of consideration. When she went to Ranelagh, or
      Epsom, or Goodwood, other women gave her those quick,
      instant glances, and any enmity that was in them fell back
      baffled. Even at Ascot she was a noticeable woman. She had
      done her duty to her grandee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally she had inspired tenderness. A succession of men
      had made love to her, but had found Mrs. Fream
      disappointingly careful. Almost she behaved like a prude.
      She had put the woman in herself to sleep, and was at great
      pains to make sure that the obstreperous infant should not
      wake up and squeal for the moon. A comfortable cushion on
      the earth was worth many moons. She cherished her security,
      and wore it as a girdle of chastity. Her grandee--poor
      fellow--had nothing to complain of. She looked the male
      world in the face, and did not blink an eyelid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare praised her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has nous. She is not going to be fooled off her
      perch."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leslie--the sentimentalist--wondered what Fream got out of
      it. A rose without a perfume--what!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silly. She transmutes his money into Coty. He pours in the
      crude stuff and she is like Grasse. Is there any other
      place that smells like Grasse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leslie, with a stare at the butter dish, remarked that
      Fream was not making quite so much money these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Touched one or two slippery things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He can afford it. The pile is there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddulph glanced at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn them, they are always messing these trains about. O,
      the pile--yes. May be made of cannon-balls. All right if
      you don't start picking balls out of the bottom of the
      pile. Financial stability is rather like that. Ta-ta, old
      thing; I must scoot."
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Mrs. Fream wore rose and silver brocade; she
      carried a fan--a white plumy thing--and used it, which was
      remembered against her as a piece of affectation. The days
      of fans were dead. Your emancipated woman has no need of
      fans and their tricksies. But Mrs. Fream made play with her
      fan, and did it very prettily, and the languor of its
      movements made one young man angry and another adoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at her--! You'd think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit of it. With such a woman you don't think,--you
      feel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try it,--my dear chap. She looks like a rose--and isn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      The adoring one was an artist. He was overjoyed with the
      way she had posed herself in the hall, with an old oak
      armoire for a background, and that clouding fan moving with
      a white languor against the rose and silver of her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to paint her--just there," he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited until he could go and tell her so, and she
      smiled, and looked at him with a dark and virginal
      tranquillity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice ran slowly like honey. She was the finished
      product, and many worker bees had made her what she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm serious," said he. "You would go into the Academy like
      a conqueress. Of course it is a conventional show."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love conventional shows. They soothe me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well,--may I paint you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brown eyes seemed to be searching for somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should love it. I will ask my husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn your husband," was the painter man's inward response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percival Fream and his affairs were talked of in the
      train. It was said by those who claimed the superior
      knowledge of secret authority that Fream and Gaiter had
      joined forces. Everybody in the city knew Samuel Gaiter
      with his face like the face of a sandy-coloured cat, and
      his smile and his reputation, and his daily lunch at a
      particular hotel with a fair young woman on Mondays and
      Wednesdays, and a dark one on Tuesdays and Thursdays. With
      these two financial luminaries combining to form a double
      star new exploitations were to be expected. Gaiter was one
      of the little gods of oil, though he would exploit anything
      from a new typewriter to asphalt, and flutter country
      parsonages and credulous maiden ladies. But his reputation
      was very sound, as far as it went. He served on hospital
      boards, and financed a convalescent home for children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fream financed a wife. Mary was as ignorant of his affairs
      as he was of anything outside the money market; she drew
      cheques and she could do that very nicely. Val's ignorance
      had ceased to astonish her, as had his various ineptitudes.
      They were part of the man; they threw the positive part of
      him into high relief; there was not a single game that he
      could play without looking awkward. His dancing was
      impossible. Imagine a lamp post fox-trotting! So long as he
      remained still, and did nothing and said nothing he had a
      rigid impressiveness. He drove a car very badly; he had a
      library full of books and never looked inside them; his
      garden had exquisite features and he thought that standard
      roses just grew like that. Sometimes he would wander round
      his rock garden and look at the alpines and read the
      labels, but he found many of the names quite
      unpronounceable. He knew an oak and elm when he saw them,
      but he called poplars willows--and willows poplars. His
      head-gardener had the most extraordinary contempt for him.
      There were men who allowed themselves to play golf with
      Fream because they were very sure of winning a five-pound
      note.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his big office they called him the Sphinx. He was very
      punctual. The lift carried him up to the first floor at
      much the same hour each morning; he walked along the
      spacious corridor with its mosaic floor and its marble
      veneered walls, and entered his private room and found his
      secretary waiting. Tyson was a bright lad, very polite to
      Fream in his presence, but wholly irreverent behind his
      back. He called Fream "sir," and was careful to take his
      hat and coat, and to behave like a lackey, but like a
      lackey's his loyalty ceased on the other side of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fream may have suspected this. He was a more intelligent
      creature when he breathed in that big and solidly furnished
      room, and sat in his padded chair; and for the last three
      months he had been opening his own letters. Tyson was a
      little annoyed about it. "The boss is getting fussy." At
      all events there were many letters the interior of which
      remained unknown to Harold Tyson. Also he was allowed to be
      less vicariously conversational over the telephone, and
      Fream wrote some of his own letters without dictating them
      to his secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always inarticulate and monosyllable he grew more so. He
      smoked incessantly; his room reeked of stale cigar-smoke.
      Also, there were days when he showed a funny temper. Tyson
      was both peeved and anxious. You may dislike a man, and
      miswish his financial schemes, and at the same time have no
      desire to lose a comfortable billet. Fream's irritability
      worried his secretary. It was not a reassuring symptom.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening he appeared at dinner, all black and white,
      and meticulously starched. Even his manner appeared to be
      more stiffly starched. He and Mary had reduced the carrying
      of long silences to a fine art, and his silences grew
      longer. He could talk interestedly of nothing but money,
      and the things that his money provided, and even a woman
      cannot talk for ever of her purchases. She noticed that he
      spent more of the evening alone in the library; he smoked
      there, and she supposed that he read his papers, while she
      sat in the drawing-room with a novel and the illustrated
      magazines. She was a woman who never had a needle in her
      hand, and why should she when she had Pollock to do
      everything. She yawned a good deal, and went to bed at ten,
      unless she had a bridge party or was going out to one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one night she surprised herself in surprising him. She
      had come in late after an evening with the Biddulphs, and
      thinking that Fream had gone to bed she turned into the
      library to get a book. The lights were off, but the fire
      was burning. She saw him sitting all hunched up before the
      fire with his hands over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden, vague compunction stirred in her. Also she was
      surprised that he had not heard her open the door. Perhaps
      he was asleep?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Val, is anything the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a sort of jerk and dropped his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not ill--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to straighten himself from the waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No,--just doing a bit of thinking. Enjoyed yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood beside him for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Val, you would tell me if you were ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, my dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had the feeling that he was waiting for her to go, and
      that she had interrupted some complex piece of cerebration
      connected with the mysteries of finance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clare has had a letter from 'Green Shutters.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father is not very well. Bronchitis or something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry. Perhaps you will want to go down there. Take
      'Ph&oelig;bus' and the man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might. Thank you, Val. Goodnight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a last glimpse of him sitting stiffly there before
      the fire.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      How was she to guess that she had put the shears to the
      head of her poor Samson?
    </p>
    <p>
      Or--rather---it was he who had put the shears into the
      hands of her youth. He was blind, though this blindness had
      come slowly like a creeping paralysis, and gradually he had
      been made to realize that he could not see things as he had
      been accustomed to see them. Simply because a little artery
      had burst, and the oozing blood had forced its way among
      the fibres of his self-confidence and was destroying it,
      the confidence that had enabled him to take risks
      successfully. He had lost his intuitive touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      That--to him--had been the beginning of it, moods of
      vacillation, an inability to make up his mind, a desire to
      play for safety. Yet vanity urges a man on. He had made
      himself take risks, rush into speculative industrial
      schemes, and had found himself floundering. He had been
      frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fear is humiliating. He had reacted against it. Moreover,
      the making of money was his life, his one method of
      self-expression, and for him to allow that the craft and
      the cunning had gone from him was to accept dumbness. He
      had a dread of being completely despised by his wife, and
      the trophies won in the stadium of finance had--it seemed
      to him--saved him from complete contempt. He was fond of
      Mary, and was unable to express his fondness; he could not
      let himself go, because of his fatal incapacity and its
      shame. He was stiff and self-conscious with her. But to
      surrender his place in the money market? That would mean
      that the last shred of his vanity had fallen from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His passion to acquire and to possess was as strong as ever
      though the vision that had guided it was failing. It had
      made him generous to his wife, and yet curiously grudging
      as to the larger issue. He had made no settlement in her
      favour, and did not wish to make one, for by retaining
      everything in his own name he retained a feeling of
      control. The ship was his, and she sailed in it
      luxuriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each quarter he drew a cheque and paid it into her private
      account. He gave her presents, but he was careful not to
      give her financial independence. There was no need for it.
      He wished to remain the emperor, the god on Olympus
      showering gold, though he had not the power to appear
      before his Leda as a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      His association with the venerable yet sandy-headed Gaiter
      was his campaign of Athens against Syracuse, but like the
      Athenians he did not foresee the fatal quarries. Or to put
      it in Elizabethan language, he was fitting out his Armada,
      and packing into it the last of his self-confidence. It was
      to be the greatest of his expeditions. Afraid of taking
      risks? Not he. He had set sail to conquer or to reconquer
      his faith in himself, a sombre grandee, an admiral of Spain
      driving his galleons into the grey northern seas.

      Old Hesketh Viner lay dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Charles II he had been an unconscionable time about
      it, and had said as much to the little old comrade who sat
      beside his bed and kept alight the very small fire in the
      very small grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry to give you all this trouble, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trouble--Hesketh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Charlotte loved him as she had never loved him before,
      the poor grey stubble on his poor old chin, his hands with
      their blue and swollen veins, his grey and untidy head, his
      panting mouth. She was not an emotional woman. She sat
      there in that little stuffy and overheated room, while the
      waters of death mounted slowly to her comrade's chin, and
      his breathing grew more tragic and ineffectual. The end was
      inevitable and she knew it, and she knew that so far as she
      was concerned it was the end of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamp was turned low and she sat in the shadow-land like
      a little old child on the edge of unknown darknesses. How
      strangely things happened! What did life mean? Children;
      years of quiet dullness and of self-denial; that long, thin
      figure propped against the pillows? She had moments of
      bewilderment. It was the figure on the bed that mattered.
      Children might hurt you, desert you, fail you at critical
      moments,--but that was life, and this was death.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward and laid a hand on one of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They promised to be back to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      His hurried and shallow breathing ceased for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you like me to send a telegram?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His fingers closed on hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't bother. Won't spoil pleasure.--Just you and
      I--Carrie--you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they sat, holding hands, she content that it should be
      so, and that no one should matter to him as she did. She
      felt an exultation that overflowed all bitterness and
      sorrow; he was going and very soon she would follow after
      him; he had been very kind to her--always.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fingers were moving. He had her wedding-ring between
      his thumb and first finger; it was worn very thin now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Same ring. What a long time--Remember--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, nearly fifty years, Hesketh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All in white--You looked lovely, my dear. See it all
      again. Remember--the white satin slipper old John tied to
      the handle of the carriage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great days," he said, and sighed. "Been very happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere in the house below them a bell burred softly. She
      drew her hand from his with a slow and caressing movement,
      and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be--I'll go."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the head of the stairs and called.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nellie,--is that--the children?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice answered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No,--dear; Mr. Furze."
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to the room and to her chair, and placed her
      hand again in his, and felt mortified and proud and jealous
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Furze came to inquire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good fellow. Pity--Mary--hadn't the heart, my
      dear.--Still--still--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Youth goes its way," said she. "One doesn't
      understand--what one was--till one grows old,--Hesketh."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a deeper breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No consequence--You--here--Always
      strangers--everybody--but one or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      Below, under the porch, Furze and Cousin Nellie were
      talking. He had brought up a can of the evening's milk.
      "Thought he might need it." The night was frosty, and there
      was rime on the grass, and behind and above Furze's head
      the sky was full of stars. To the little woman looking up
      at him he seemed surrounded by stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It won't be long now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are here--I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Went back for two nights,--a dance. Just time to crowd
      it in, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke without bitterness, as though she neither accused
      nor explained, but stated facts; or as though she were
      playing "patience" and taking cards from the pack of life
      and laying them upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A dance--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wanted them to go. Things seemed different with him
      yesterday. You know how wood ashes glow and grow grey.--The
      wind up the chimney. He began to grow very grey when they
      had gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did not think they would go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Children--!" said he, and she saw his big shoulders make a
      movement of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they come back to-morrow--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--yes--to-morrow! With some people it is always
      to-morrow. And to-morrow can only be what you have made
      to-day.--Good night, Miss Nellie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night."

      When the Freams' car pulled up outside "Green Shutters" the
      curtains were drawn, for Captain Viner had been dead some
      hours. The two women in the saloon, wrapped up in furs, and
      each with a foot-warmer under her feet, waited for the
      chauffeur to open the door. The man's ears were blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare looked steadily at the curtained windows, but Mary,
      having glanced at them once, did not look again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must have happened--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--my dear--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the doctor man was so positive."
    </p>
    <p>
      Their mother was waiting for them in the sitting-room. She
      sat in front of the fire, wearing the black dress that she
      wore on Sundays; she did not rise. Her face was both
      triumphant and austere; the little figure had a dignity;
      she received these two women who were her daughters and
      made them feel that they had never known what their mother
      knew, and that in some way she greatly despised them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare said nothing, but sat down and unfastened her fur
      coat. It was Mary who faltered, and who would have kissed
      Mrs. Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--mother--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not kiss her, for Mrs. Viner remained sitting
      very straight, with her hands in her lap, and her eyes very
      bright in her birdlike face. She suggested immense
      serenity, and little old lady enthroned, very wise, very
      sad, and yet very happy. These unwise virgins were at her
      feet; she was without envy or anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father died very peacefully in the night. I was with
      him. It was as it should be."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better take off your coats."
    </p>
    <p>
      They took them off like a couple of children.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps--you would like to go upstairs. He looks so very
      peaceful. I will ask Cousin Nellie to send your car and the
      luggage up to the 'George' at Carslake. They will have
      rooms there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare and Mary went up to look at Captain Viner lying dead
      in his bed, while their mother remained by the fire. Old
      Viner had a faint smile on his thin face. His chin was all
      grey stubble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare stood at the foot of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose they will shave him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary gave a queer cry, and was on her knees, with her face
      against the sheet that covered her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--don't--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, it looked rather selfish of us.--I'm sorry.--But
      that fool of a doctor--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was selfish.--Beastly selfish.--Let's be honest."

      Furze had a load of logs to deliver at "Simla." Oak, and
      ash, and chestnut, he sawed them at night during the long
      winter evenings; it gave him something to do; it helped him
      to sleep; it earned him a little money. If Rose had been
      alive he would not have been sawing wood at ten o'clock
      after a day's work, but he seemed to have no heart in him
      to grow tired. It went on beating with the same dogged,
      deliberate, sombre rhythm; it had nothing to quicken it, or
      to bid it pause. He was made of iron. His head and face
      were the colour of old plough chains. He felt stronger than
      he had ever been, fatally and tragically strong with the
      dull strength of a man who is lonely, and who hopes for
      nothing. His day was like the day of a slow and plodding
      beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had one of the grey horses between the shafts. Even
      before starting the wheels of the cart had been caked with
      dry and yellow mud, and in the farm lane they gathered more
      mud, for the ground was rotten after sudden thaw. Furze's
      boots were all mud, wet below, dry and hard above. He
      walked beside the grey horse, lacking a collar, wearing an
      old army jerkin over his coat, his worn breeches spotted
      with clay and grease, his leggings much the same colour as
      his boots. He walked heavily, but with a suggestion of
      power. When he came to the turning into the main road he
      checked the grey horse to let a car go by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car slowed up two hundred yards down the road, and
      swung to the right up the black ramp of the cinder track.
      It was waiting outside "Green Shutters" when Furze came
      along with his cart. He knew to whom the car belonged, and
      why it was there. It had brought Mrs. Fream down to
      Carslake. She had been over half the country in search of
      white flowers, those posthumous tributes to her father for
      which her husband paid. She had gone into "Green Shutters"
      with an armful of lilies and narcissi and white carnations
      and had laid them on the table by the window, and the smell
      of them had filled the over-heated little room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Charlotte was mending a pair of black gloves. She saw
      Mrs. Fream sit down at the table, and begin to sort out the
      flowers on a spread newspaper. Mary's whim was to arrange
      them herself. Captain Viner was to be buried in Carslake
      cemetery on the afternoon of to-morrow. Clare Biddulph had
      returned to Weyfleet by train, but she was coming down with
      Leslie for the funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Charlotte noticed that Mary had paused in her
      arranging of the flowers. She was looking out of the
      window, holding five white carnations in her left hand, and
      a single flower in her right. Furze and his wood-cart were
      passing on their way to Colonel Sykes; she saw the familiar
      figure walking at the horse's head; she thought that it
      looked shabbier and shaggier, but much the same as she
      remembered it. She went on with the arranging of her
      flowers, but the man and his cart had come between her and
      her work, and her glances kept wandering in the direction
      of Colonel Sykes' fence. Furze had opened the gate, and was
      preparing to back the cart into the entry and to shoot the
      logs into the drive. Colonel Sykes objected to the tearing
      up of his gravel, and a handy man with a wheelbarrow would
      clear the pile of logs into the shed at the back of the
      bungalow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary put down her spray of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I stay to tea, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no need to keep Randall waiting. I will send him
      back; he can bring the car down later."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and at the back of the impulse that moved her lay
      a whole shadow-world of impending self-consciousness. She
      said to herself that it was quite unnecessary to keep the
      chauffeur waiting out there in the cold. The rawness of the
      day made it allowable for her to put on her musquash coat
      even to go as far as the gate and give Randall his orders.
      The coincidence was not fortuitous. Her self-love was in
      control, though had she been challenged with it she would
      have denied it hotly. She was Mrs. Fream of Hill House,
      very much a young woman of the world in a two hundred
      guinea coat. Your great lady has every right to appear
      magnanimous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big car moved off just as Furze was righting his cart.
      He drew clear of the gate, went to shut it, and returning
      to his horse's head, saw Mary standing at that other gate.
      Her difference was as apparent to him as a coat of new
      paint on a wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to pass her. It was not that he minded the passing
      of her, but there was a part of him that resented her being
      there. He had a flair for the significance of that nice
      posture of hers. Loneliness and suffering may dull a man,
      but they may also make him amazingly sensitive and quick to
      sense an atmosphere. He felt fierce. He divined the
      self-love waiting at that other gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all calculated situations are relative and apt to be
      altered by the incalculable human factor. She did speak to
      him, but her voice was not the voice she had expected to
      hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Furze--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped his horse, and came across to her. He did not
      take off his hat. His eyes looked very steady and dark
      under the brim of it. They watched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been so good to my father--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had nothing to say. He looked at her and was silent.
      Then his eyes went to the upper window where the curtains
      were drawn. He took off his hat deliberately, and just as
      deliberately replaced it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she? She was trembling. All that nice and expensive
      worldliness, the perfect sheath of her material smartness
      was no better than an apron of beads. She felt the
      quivering of them about her loins. Mrs. Fream of Hill
      House, with her Weyfleet voice and her experienced languor
      and her furs and her shingled head! She was most poignantly
      conscious of him the man, the very elemental rudeness of
      him, that tanned throat, the mouth that had grown harder,
      the fierce strangeness of the eyes, the two new furrows
      between his eyebrows. He looked rougher. He had not shaved;
      his older leather jerkin lacked a button; his breeches were
      stained, his boots filthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry," was all that he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back to his horse and cart as though she did not
      matter to him, because it was quite impossible for him to
      matter to her. The peasant and the fine lady! He had given
      her a glance of sombre insolence. The muddy wheels
      revolved. His figure looked stubborn and large beside the
      grey horse. They disappeared down the cinder track.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How he hates me!" she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went in and took off her fur coat, and stood in the
      little hall for a moment, with her dark eyes in a stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood that his hatred could not hurt her. He might
      hate her as much as he pleased, for hatred is homage, but
      to be despised by him would be different. It would be
      impertinent and stupid of him to despise her, Mrs. Fream of
      Hill House, a very complete young woman of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rejoined her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw Mr. Furze for a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice had recovered its drawling leisureliness. Mrs.
      Charlotte said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thanked him for his kindness to father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father and he--had something in common."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary picked up a white carnation and held it to her
      nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looks--rather--as though he had gone to seed. I don't like
      to see a man such a sloven--I suppose that marriage of
      his--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a very happy marriage," said her mother, "I suppose
      that is why he doesn't care."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The provocation of Mrs. Fream's delicate voluptuousness
      went with Furze down the muddy lane. Its effect astonished
      him. It had folded itself in the sumptuous suggestiveness
      of that fur coat of hers. The barbarian, the man in a bear
      skin, that was Arnold Furze, the tall, Teuton or the Gaul
      lounging long-limbed in a decadent, southern town, and
      seeing some dusky and scented Voluptas with reddened lips
      and sleepy and insolent eyes carried by in a litter by four
      slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sleek, shingled, befurred city madam with her soft
      white face and casual eyes! This complete and pretty
      trifler! This delicate, scented thing all wrapped up in
      lace and silk!
    </p>
    <p>
      By God--!
    </p>
    <p>
      The impetus in him was barbaric. It was to pick her up and
      carry her off,--voluptuous spoil, Greek plunder. Yes, and
      to throw her down in the mud of the lane. To tear that fur
      coat from her. To gather her up, shocked and screaming and
      scared, and carry her where he pleased up the "Doomsday"
      stairs, and to throw her on a bed and have his will of her.
      Yes, just that! And then to let her go, subdued, possessed,
      with frightened yet voluptuous eyes, pulling her clothes
      over her bosom, shamed yet secretly satisfied, this
      dark-flowered parasite--
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of the grey horse stopping, and of the cart
      wheels squelching in the mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the farm gate at the end of the lane while
      the heart of him had been full of other things.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      But Furze was seen next day at Captain Viner's funeral. He
      had shaved; he had put on a black tie and a dark blue suit.
      A raw wind was blowing, but having no overcoat that was fit
      for such a function he went without one. He was accustomed
      to the wind, and hardly noticed it, though Fream and
      Biddulph, coming warm from a big lunch at the "George" and
      wearing heavy coats, looked pinched and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reg'lar death traps--these cemeteries."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you'd think they meant to keep their corpses in cold
      storage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such flippances crop up at funerals, human nature being
      what it is and wishing not to appear too serious. Carslake
      cemetery was on the slope of Windmill Hill, facing
      north-east, a bleak spot where the trees huddled themselves
      with their backs to the wind. The soil was clay. You saw a
      sample of it beside the grave, a pile of sticky, yellow
      cubes lying as it had left the spade. Everybody looked
      morose and cold and unhappy, and the only happy face was
      that of Mrs. Charlotte. She stood there looking like a
      little bright-eyed bird, a patch of bright colour on each
      cheek, for she had nothing to regret. Mary wept a little
      and carried a handkerchief, and Furze, who kept very much
      in the background, would not let himself look at her. But
      he looked at her husband, and wondered what marriage meant
      to him and what he got out of it. Of course the occasion
      was not a festive one, and it was a beast of a day, and
      everything was grey, but Furze thought that Fream looked a
      very miserable man, cold through and through. Yes,--and
      frightened. But of what? Of the suggestiveness of that slit
      in the clay into which old Viner had to be lowered, and
      beside which Mrs. Charlotte stood proud and undaunted?
    </p>
    <p>
      When the ceremony was over Furze put on his hat and moved
      away. He had a last glimpse of Mrs. Charlotte standing
      looking down into the grave with a bright-eyed and
      bird-like tenderness. Mrs. Fream was dabbing her eyes with
      a handkerchief. Poor old Viner! These posthumous
      manifestations of regret! And sighs of relief, and little
      hot drinks at the "George," and then--"Home--my dear,--and
      dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze passed out under the two yews at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't suppose the little old lady will last long without
      him," he thought; "I don't suppose she wants to."

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "Val,--do you think we can help my mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come to the library after dinner, and had found her
      husband writing letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing a chair to the fire she sat and spread her hands to
      the blaze, and the light ran up her bare arms into her
      bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father had his pension. They are only allowing mother
      seventy-five pounds a year. She has the house, and a little
      money from investments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--about twenty pounds--I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would a hundred a year do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, yes,--I think so. It is very good of you, Val."
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not turn to thank him, or even look at him, and
      sitting there with his elbows on the desk he observed her
      unseeing back and her imperturbable white shoulders. A lamp
      with a red shade stood on the desk, and the rest of the
      room was shadowing, lined with those dim books that were
      never read. It had become a very silent room; its very toys
      had grown mute; the pianola had not been touched for weeks,
      and 2LO might call and no one cared to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to be of use."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face seemed to have grown flatter and more colourless.
      He took off his glasses, and pressed a finger and thumb
      over closed eyelids, and then looked at her again with
      short-sighted wistfulness. He smiled faintly, and the smile
      gave to his face an expression of futile vacancy, like a
      white wall cracking. He picked up his glasses, and tapped
      gently with them on the blotting-pad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to be of use," he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her white shoulders warmed themselves unmoved. They did not
      feel the breath of a dumb appeal. He sat there behind her
      in silence, and she took his silence for granted. She took
      everything for granted--now, and he did not blame her, for
      he had come to know himself as a money-machine, a sort of
      patient automaton that sat in chairs and signed its name.
      There were times now when he felt rather ghastly about it,
      and she might have seen that ghastliness on his face. But
      she did not see it. He was the same long white inarticulate
      post of a man, like a sign-post on a familiar road along
      which she passed every day. She simply was not conscious of
      him as a live man, as a frightened man, or a lonely one
      about whom a fog of worry was thickening. He might sit
      there muffled in his own fog, self-paralysed, dumbly
      bitter, vaguely unaware of an immense irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Money's useful," he said, with a grin that was both futile
      and sardonic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Val, very."
    </p>
    <p>
      He replaced his glasses. She was staring at the fire. What
      did she see in the fire? Did it never occur to her that
      some day there might be no fuel for the fire? No, why
      should it occur to her? He had wrapped her up in
      cotton-wool. He was a mere machine, as unfamiliar to her as
      a text-book on Political Economy by Ricardo or Mill or
      Jevons. She did not appear to suspect that a machine might
      get out of order or break down. She expected him to go on
      in the same relentlessly efficient way, day in, day out,
      like a perfect automobile. She rode in it, wrapped in her
      furs, serenely careless, going to her dances and her
      parties and her theatres and her shoppings. She would be
      surprised at a mere puncture, or at half a minute's
      mechanical trouble. "Dear me, Val, what is the matter?"
      Yes, just a flicker of languid and dark-eyed surprise, and
      perhaps a touch of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should he tell her? What would be the use? She would be
      shocked, terribly frightened; and it might not be necessary
      to frighten her. She had evolved such a nice air of social
      self-sufficiency; she was so sleek and casual.
    </p>
    <p>
      He resumed his letter writing, and presently she rose, and
      patted back a yawn and went towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks so much, Val."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to be of use."
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the door, went out, and closed it softly after
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished his letter and sat staring. How damnably
      worrying things were, and then she just came and asked him
      for money! Worries, problems, the Tanooga Railway, the
      Universal Insurance Co.; hypothetical oil in Mexico, the
      sandy cat-like face of Mr. Samuel Gaiter, other faces
      vaguely hostile and suspicious, that last general meeting
      of "Crust and Co." when he had stood up as chairman and
      tried to make a speech and had made a stuttering fool of
      himself. Strange how his luck had been out since his
      marriage! But was it luck? Had he not felt that the Midas
      touch had left him? A cutthroat game! He had cut other
      men's throats, and he had never thought about their wives.
      It was possible that someone would cut his throat, and
      Mary's hands were not the hands to hold a basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little Mary! She had been his last and most expensive
      purchase, a live doll, a mannequin. Well,--well--! She
      would be in the soup with him if the soup it was to be.
      Swimming about like a couple of flies!
    </p>
    <p>
      A year ago he could have settled a considerable sum on his
      wife, but he had been prejudiced against surrendering the
      one key that life had left him. Now, it was too late. He
      was too tied up, all in--as the saying goes. And that
      phrase of Gaiter's. "My dear chap, either we are great men
      or scoundrels. We are going to be great men." Gaiter had
      the coolness of a cat. Was it that he had lost his nerve,
      left it behind him in that Monte Carlo hotel?
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the matter of the supplementing of Mrs. Charlotte's
      income Fream was not called upon to be of use. Cheerfully,
      and with a certain air of triumph she developed pneumonia a
      month after her husband's death, and sat propped up in bed
      with a flushed face and eyes that seemed to see over the
      edge of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be with my dear love in a week, Nellie."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Nellie was shocked, for her cousin spoke the voice
      of conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll wire to Weyfleet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, the girls! They are always so very busy. We will wait a
      day or two. Poor Hesketh's trouble and then mine. We will
      wait a day or two, Nellie."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Nellie waylaid the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She says she is going to die."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She wants to die. She's quite excited about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then--she will die. Yes, you had better wire, unless--of
      course--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Nellie wired, and the telegram went to Mary, for in
      Cousin Nellie's estimation Mary had chances of salvation if
      someone would take the trouble to hang her on a cross.
      Clare was beyond hope of redemption. No one would ever get
      Clare suspended upon so crude a piece of timber.

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Said Mrs. Charlotte, propped up and panting, but with eyes
      of triumphant eagerness--"I want to see Mr. Furze."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Nellie was troubled, for she had been expecting the
      Fream car, and it was six o'clock and no car had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear.--You must not tire yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke soothingly, but Mrs. Charlotte was not needing a
      linctus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No consequence. I want to see Mr. Furze."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want me to send for him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Charlotte nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the good Coode was called to his door and sent to
      "Doomsday." He came back with Furze under the February
      stars, and stood at his gate and felt that life was a sad
      business, while Furze went up to Mrs. Charlotte's room.
      Furze wondered what she could have to say to him, but when
      he heard what she had to say, his face grew soft and
      sombre. He looked at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have nothing to regret, Mrs. Viner. O, yes, I
      promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      The engine of a car made itself heard as he rose and took
      leave of her, and at the top of the stairs he paused. A
      door had opened; a current of cold air and voices came up
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Expecting you, Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came by train; that's why I am so late. I'm staying.
      Here's my purse; will you see to the taxi? I'm going up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Furze is with your mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Furze--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She asked for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The only light came from the lamp in the hall, and it left
      the upper half of the flight of stairs in darkness. Furze
      was part of that darkness. And she was looking up; she had
      taken the first three steps before she had heard that he
      was with her mother, and she had paused as though dismayed.
      He saw her white face close to the wall as she leaned
      against it--hesitating. He spoke; he had to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just left your mother. Please come up."
    </p>
    <p>
      For some seconds she remained quite motionless, and then
      she came up and past him with a little rush, and a
      suggestion of breathlessness. He caught a sidelong gleam of
      her eyes. She smelt of some perfume. He was aware of her as
      a soft, dusky sweet-scented thing with a pale face, passing
      him quickly like a swift bird eluding a hand. She went into
      her mother's room and closed the door, and Furze descended
      the stairs.

      Cousin Nellie was paying the taxi driver who had brought
      Mary from Carslake station. Furze met her at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad she has come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O--yes--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped some coins back into Mary's purse, and looked
      vaguely past Furze at a lighted window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The new and the old, the new and the old. Good night, Mr.
      Arnold," and snapping the catch of the purse she went back
      to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coode was leaning over his gate like a man in pain; he let
      Furze go by and then spoke after him in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze turned back a step. Here was another man who had been
      a lover, and who could still hang over a gate and imagine
      the presence of her as a soft breathing and a perfume in
      the cold bosom of a raw February night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Viner is going to die," said Furze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coode's head jerked upwards, but he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left Coode hanging on the gate like a dead crow in a
      gamekeeper's larder, and went back to his farm, but he did
      not enter the house. A great restlessness was upon him. He
      stood by the pond and looked at the cold spread of the dark
      water, and it put words into his head. "Stoop down, stoop
      down to the water, Melisande."--And then he heard a little
      bleating sound coming to him out of the night, the voice of
      one of his ewes big with lamb, and penned under the shelter
      of Rose's Wood. A strange pity stirred in him. How pitiful
      life was and how strange! He climbed over the gate and went
      slowly down across the "Gore," and the moisture from the
      fodder crop of winter green soaked his boots. A poor
      beast--big with child--crying in the night! Was it an
      allegory, a prophetic cry? A woman without a child, a woman
      who had shirked the bearing of children, and yet whose
      sleek, soft, sweet-smelling body provoked the embrace that
      begets children! He felt a fierce and fanatical urge in
      him. A clinging, dark-eyed parasite! She should be made to
      cling for other reasons, and to feel a babe biting at her
      breast. Pain, travail, labour, such was life; and life
      would overtake her and bring her down in order that she
      might rise again and grapple with life. Men brought to
      women pain and childbirth and all that was inevitable and
      deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned upon one of the hurdles of the pen, and from a
      dark shelter came that whimpering, plaintive cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Patience," he said, "that ram does God's work, old lady.
      And the lamb shall nose your belly."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The people who would escape--! She--! Drawing a nice skin
      of furs about her, and daintily shirking.--'Life's so
      coarse. Be careful. I will not be soiled.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah,--my lady! Perhaps life will catch you. It will take
      its revenge. I wonder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the stars and thought of Rose; and his heart
      felt big again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, beloved, you had courage. You were big and strong and
      comely and good. You gave, and in the giving won what you
      desired. Something for nothing? No, not on the land. These
      people who are shy of life should learn from the soil. By
      the sweat of the brow and the bloody sweat of the soul."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Charlotte lay beside her man in Carslake cemetery, and
      Cousin Nellie had gone back to her old lady, and "Green
      Shutters" was empty, and Furze was in the thick of the
      lambing season. March days. And Mary wore black, and looked
      very well in it, rather like a dark pansy. "Poor Mrs.
      Fream, her father and mother dead within five weeks of each
      other." Poor Mrs. Fream indeed! No one spoke of Clare as
      "Poor Mrs. Biddulph." People grow old and pass, and
      elections come and go, and skirts are lengthened a little,
      and you wear your hat a little less like an inverted
      flower-pot perched on a dahlia stake to catch earwigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But something had happened to Mary. She was two selves in
      one body, and looking more like she used to look, poignant
      and vaguely plaintive, all swimming dark eyes and clotted
      cream. A chiffon overskirt--the superficial smartness--and
      the more solid and emotional underskirt beneath! Yes,
      suddenly she had rediscovered her emotions, and emotions
      are problematical possessions when you are mated to a
      signpost that points you nowhere, not even towards
      maternity. Mary was having a little religious revival of
      her own, and was going down on her silk-hosed knees, and
      feeling reproached by all manner of reflections. She had
      become full of sentimental contritions and
      self-confessions. She had not been a good daughter; she had
      made men suffer.--Poor dear things! For the last year she
      had been feeling very empty, and this emotional mood was
      quite pleasantly filling. It made her feel a serious
      person, and rather mysterious and romantic, a sort of
      little Diana of the Crossways--you know. A wistful look in
      your mirror, and an air of tristful languor in public, and
      a sense of being deeper than you thought you were, if you
      ever thought about it at all. A woman may grow
      chocolate-sick, and take to drinking vinegar for the sake
      of her figure. Diet, emotional and otherwise, has a
      distinct reaction upon the inward attitude toward the
      ordinary phenomena of life. Yet, did she confess to herself
      that behind the pale shades of her dead parents loomed that
      brown-throated, shaggy sloven of a farmer? "Doomsday"!
    </p>
    <p>
      One day in March, it was a Sunday and she had been to
      Weyfleet church in the morning, she broke a sentimental
      whim under the eyes of her grandee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Val,--I want to speak to you about 'Green Shutters.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      That his pallor had a tinge of green in it these days had
      not been observed by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her a little anxiously, with inward
      self-depreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know--the house was left to Clare and me. Of course
      Leslie suggested that it should be sold. I don't want it to
      be sold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not ask for her reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wondered if you could buy me--Clare's share. I should
      like to own the house--feel it mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took off his pince-nez and polished them, and then
      replaced them with both hands--elbows raised--a pose that
      always made him look a little fatuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Might be managed. Your property--you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Val. Sentimental reasons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would let it,--I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked vague and poignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might.--But only to--certain people. Associations are
      queer. I might like to go down there--now and again--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He examined his finger-nails with an air of solemn
      intentness. How was she to divine what was passing in his
      mind? Yes, he would buy her Clare's share of the house. In
      case of shipwreck she would have a little rock upon which
      she could find a foothold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll see Biddulph about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked pleased, touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Val, you are good to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      For the sum of six hundred pounds Clare parted with her
      half-share of "Green Shutters" and the furniture therein
      and when Mr. Biddulph had obtained probate and produced his
      statement of accounts, Mary found herself the mistress of
      "Green Shutters" and its furniture, and of £230 0s. 0d.
      invested in 5 per cent. War Loan--1929-47. The title deed
      was sent to her husband and he handed it over to her one
      morning at breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are,--woman of property."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do I do with it, Val?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deposit it with your lawyers or at your bank,--the bank
      for choice--By the way I have to go down to Gaiter's place
      in the country for the week-end; business--you know; not a
      house party."
    </p>
    <p>
      So her opportunity came to her, and with it the inspiration
      of an April morning. She felt adventurous, and the blue of
      the sky was without a cloud. Should she take Pollock with
      her? No, she would go alone, with a luncheon basket, and a
      suitcase and a box of flowers in the dickey of her
      cherry-coloured car. Yes, it was quite an adventure, a
      sentimental pilgrimage, a setting to music of the little
      laments that her conscience had been uttering.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mary came to the old country by way of Melhurst village,
      and she drove through Melhurst Park. Her cherry-coloured
      car overtook the memory of the blue wagon and the two grey
      horses moving slowly over the green billows of the park.
      The same trees were there, the same deer, the same brown
      beech leaves of another year flickering hither and thither
      as the wind stirred them. She pulled up and got out, and
      sat on the grass verge, with the hood-cover between her and
      the damp turf, and in renewing a memory she opened an
      inward door. How that man hated her! And did he also
      despise her? And if so--why should she mind? What did it
      matter to Mrs. Fream of Hill House, the admirably appointed
      Mrs. Fream who was showing a nice sentiment in the matter
      of "Green Shutters." She had presented to herself the house
      of her parents as a public memorial to her conscience. She
      was about to visit it, and spend an hour or two in it with
      a dutiful duster, and an appreciation of her own
      sensibilities. She would drive up to Carslake cemetery and
      place flowers on the graves.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a woman of the world. For the space of nearly three
      years she had been insisting upon herself as a woman of the
      world, and she believed in herself as Mrs. Fream of Hill
      House. She had developed tact. She had distinguished
      herself as a hostess. She knew exactly how things should be
      done, how servants should be treated, the right voice in
      which to give orders to a chauffeur, how to cast a pleasant
      atmosphere over a tea-table on the terrace of the Hills
      Club. Her personal appointments were exquisite. She came
      soft and rosy from her bath each morning. Pollock dressed
      her hair and her person, and manicured her finger-nails.
      She was very complete, and was convinced of her own
      completeness. If she gave way to sensibility--well--a woman
      of the world might be allowed to know how to feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She re-entered her car, pressed the toe of a black glacé
      shoe on the button of the self-starter, and working neatly
      through her gears, took the undulations of the park road at
      a swinging speed. She drove well, as a woman of the world
      might be expected to drive, but half-way up the long hill
      before the junction with the Carslake road "Cherry's"
      engine developed a sudden and rather fearsome "knock." Mary
      slowed up, and glanced at the oil dial on the dashboard. It
      was registering what she had been taught to regard as the
      proper pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most unfortunate of complications, and yet in sympathy with
      that suitcase packed in the dickey. "Have it put in,
      Pollock. I might have to stay the night at the 'George.'"
      Gently she brought the complaining "Cherry" into the
      Carslake road, and fifty yards before she reached the
      cinder track she sighted an A.A. scout on his bicycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pulled up and waved to the man, and he dismounted, and
      saluting her, stood beside the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is something wrong with my engine. I am going to the
      Sandihurst Estate. I wonder if you could have a man sent
      down from one of the Carslake garages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The engine is knocking badly. The car may have to go up to
      Carslake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect so,--madam--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--and the house is 'Green Shutters.' But the Andrews
      people know me,--Mrs. Fream."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      He saluted, mounted, and rode off, and she coaxed "Cherry"
      up the cinder track, and pulled up in front of "Green
      Shutters." Someone--a girl--waved to her, but she did not
      wave back. She had come to see things, not people; she did
      not feel friendly to all the Vachetts and the Twists and
      the Perrivales. The horrible Jamiesons had left, but poor
      Coode still starved among his hens.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got out of the car and went quickly up the path. It was
      sprouting grass and weeds, and the curtains drawn across
      the windows made the little house look more deserted. She
      was conscious of a feeling of breathlessness. She had a
      duplicate key with her, and she unlocked the door, and
      hastily closing it after her, relocked it. What a queer
      feeling of guilt, of hiding from something! She stood there
      in the passage, with her hands hanging limply, her eyes
      fixed on the stairs. Everything was just the same. Her
      father's old sun-browned panama hat on a peg! But the
      silence, a suggestion of dampness, deadness, pathos? She
      was conscious of a thickness in her throat. Poor little
      flimsy house, hers, full of memories, voices, restlessness,
      disharmonies, kindnesses. It reproached her, and she had
      not expected to be reproached. But why?
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely she ought to know! And suddenly the purpose of her
      pilgrimage ceased to be whimsical, and became real. This
      was the first real thing that she had done for the best
      part of three years. Vaguely she was aware of herself as
      bringing succour to something that was more than mere tile
      and brick and timber. She was touching the hands of her old
      self, that distressed, rebellious, bewildered self, crying
      for escape and freedom. She had escaped. She was back here
      as a woman of the world, a woman of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went into the sitting-room and sat down. What a queer
      feeling! No one in the house, and the furniture just the
      same, and the identical darn in the identical hearth-rug,
      and her mother's chair, and one of her father's pipes on
      the mantelpiece! O,--heavens! And dust, weeks of dust,
      though she had arranged for a woman to come in. They had
      passed away--those old people--a little less than two
      months ago; years seemed to have passed,--and hours. What
      strange stirrings in her! Tears! How very sentimental! She
      stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice in her was saying--"No, I'll not go to the
      'George.' I'll stay here--and picnic. I wonder if there is
      any coal."
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed through the familiar kitchen, and in the little
      brick coal-hole off the scullery she found both coal and
      wood. She took off her hat, and then heard someone
      knocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bother.--One of the--people."
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was a mechanic from the Carslake garage. He and a
      mate had come down in a car.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him and found her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--I think you had better take my car up to Carslake. I
      think there is something very wrong with the engine. I
      shall want it to-morrow--if possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow's Sunday, Miss," said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      She agreed that to-morrow was Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do the best you can. And would you mind carrying in my
      suit-case and the luncheon basket--and a box. They are in
      the dickey."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were carried in; "Cherry" was taken away; she relocked
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mary found an old apron hanging behind the kitchen door,
      and she put it on over her black dress and got to work. She
      laid a fire in the kitchen range, and having persuaded it
      to burn after a second supply of wood and paper, she
      brought down blankets and sheets from the linen cupboard on
      the landing, and hung them to air on the backs of chairs.
      She was very busy, and all the while she was conscious of a
      queer secret feeling; she left the curtains drawn; she
      wanted to be undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      People came and knocked. She let them knock. One of the
      visitors was poor Coode; she was sure of it, divining his
      identity by the self-effacing and deprecating little
      rat-tat that he gave. She could imagine him saying very
      earnestly--"Can I be of any use,--Mrs. Fream?" About four
      o'clock she heard a voice calling--"Mrs. Fream, Mrs.
      Fream!" It was the voice of Phyllis Perrivale, and she left
      it unanswered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt full of mystery, a creature of fanciful
      elfishness. She changed her mind as to the flowers that
      were to have been laid upon the grave, and she chose
      instead to place them in vases about the house as flowers
      of memory. She dusted the rooms, resuming her recollections
      of those days when she had cooked and cleaned and washed,
      and had loathed it all, but on this April day she was Mrs.
      Fream playing a little mysterious and sacramental game and
      playing it rather like a child. She unpacked her luncheon
      basket. She had given very complete orders as to its
      contents, and very complete it was, a tea basket as well as
      a luncheon basket. She had chicken and bread and pastries,
      and some galantine, and butter, and a little cream cheese,
      and tea and sugar, and a bottle of milk, and two
      half-bottles of white wine, and some fancy cakes. She
      arranged her provisions in the larder, and made herself
      tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards she lit a cigarette and dreamed a little. She
      was feeling life as she had not felt it for a very long
      while; it had a freshness, a sensitiveness, a newness. Yes,
      undoubtedly she had been very bored, and stagnant as to her
      emotions. She took old Hesketh's pipe down from the
      mantelpiece and held it in her soft hands, and looked
      poignant, and almost like a woman discovering the mystery
      of herself. The quickness and the fluidity of her emotions
      surprised her; she felt touched to tears by the most
      commonplace objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again someone knocked, and she left the knock unanswered.
      Why did people bother her when she was like a child deep in
      a mysterious game? Curiosity,--kindness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course anyone could see the chimney smoking. A certain
      person did see it, and from a considerable distance, Arnold
      Furze walking at the head of a horse that was pulling a
      roller to and fro across the Ridge Fields. He stopped the
      horse and stood at gaze for quite half a minute, watching
      the trail of smoke from that particular chimney. To him it
      had become a dead house, but obviously it was alive again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let--I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he went on rolling his field, with the westering sun
      striking under the brim of his hat and giving to his eyes a
      hollow intentness. His face had hardened a good deal; it
      had a sombreness, a suggestion of lean fanaticism in the
      stern lines of the jaw and mouth. He rolled his field, and
      the iron crushed the clods as he went to and fro, horse and
      man lonely and inevitable against the sky-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      At "Green Shutters" a woman had drawn a curtain gently to
      one side, and she saw April, an evening of plaintive
      blueness, and hills ready to darken against a sky of pale
      gold. There lay the garden, old Hesketh's garden neglected
      and strange, with last year's pea-sticks still in the
      ground, the grass shaggy and yellow, the soil puddled by
      the winter's rains. It seemed to cry to her for help, but
      what could she do to help it? Her hands were soft and
      unwilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must arrange for a man to see to it," she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But April drew her, the sky, and the blue green glooms, and
      the singing of a bird. She desired to wander, but not to be
      seen, and putting on her hat and locking the door after her
      she walked down the garden to the fence on the top of the
      bank above the road. She was able to make an unconventional
      escape, after peering over the top of the fence to make
      sure that the road was empty. The same loose pale was there
      in the fence, and she had the same slimness, and could slip
      through. She swooped diagonally down the grass bank and
      found herself in the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a mile to Carslake cemetery, and she reached it by a
      side-road that skirted the old abbey wall. Windmill Hill
      rose like a great bald forehead above the landscape, and
      its wind-blown trees were like ragged tufts of hair. She
      did not stay long in the cemetery, for the sun was setting,
      and the place chilled her, for though she was near to
      reality she did not yet react to it as such. Sentiment had
      thrown a spangled cloak over reality; she was at play; her
      emotions amused themselves; her feet were too near the
      yellow clay in Carslake cemetery, and she preferred to
      sentimentalize over the sunset. For escape was still her
      privilege. She could play her game, knowing that a little
      pleasure-car would carry her back to Hill House and its
      marble bathroom, and Pollock, and dances, and lawns and
      shops.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had brought two white roses with her, and she left them
      with her dead. That was her attitude towards reality. Her
      sentiments were feeling sleekly satisfied, and if her dead
      were dead--what more was there for her to do than to leave
      flowers with them? She eschewed the clay, the essential
      grimness of things that flowers hide, muck and worms, and
      bacteria, and toil. She still played on the surface of
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered Carslake, and Carslake was busy with its
      Saturday evening shopping. Turning into Andrews' garage,
      she found "Cherry" very much in deshabille, and an oily man
      and a boy busy removing gudgeon pins. A bearing had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monday at the earliest, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you promise to have her ready by twelve o'clock on
      Monday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Andrews thought that he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will have her driven down to 'Green Shutters.' And
      let me have the bill at Weyfleet.--Hill House, Weyfleet."
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered that she had only three cigarettes left in
      her case, and she bought a box of fifty at the
      tobacconist's opposite the "George" Inn. She was walking
      out of the shop when Furze appeared in the doorway, a
      haversack slung over one shoulder, and his eyes expecting
      no figure such as hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was startled, but she did not show it. In fact to Furze
      she appeared very much mistress of herself. She gave him a
      slight smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am down here--for a few hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought that he looked very tired. He--too--was part of
      her sentimental evening, a man moving on the surface of
      life. She waited outside the shop; she wanted him to know
      where she had been and what she had been doing. She owed
      that to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came out she was there in her black dress and hat,
      an anomalous figure, and yet with eyes that were smooth and
      casual.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been to the graves. Yes,--I am staying for the
      week-end."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at the "George."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, at 'Green Shutters.' It belongs to me now. I
      feel--responsible for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her, and the quality of his gaze was beyond
      her. She had no understanding of his intensity, of the real
      man who stood in the footwalk and stared at her. She kept
      her poise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had trouble with my car. I had to leave it at Andrews.
      Oh,--I must not forget to buy a few candles. No lights down
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you walking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she known what lay behind that casual question she
      might have avoided her old lover.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      But avoidance was not part of the play. She was like a
      spoilt child in a menagerie coquetting with a lion that was
      safely caged. All her animals were caged, and you could
      throw buns to them, and say--"Pretty, pretty," and remark
      to your nurse that the lion looked cross. It did not occur
      to her that she might be an offence and provocation to some
      wild beast behind the bars, and that man may be a very
      dangerous wild beast, more especially so when he has been
      teased and thwarted by fate, and has in him the makings of
      a fanatic. And man is a reasoning animal, a creature with
      ideals that may have stern eyes, and a fantastic frown on
      its forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took the Melhurst road together under the frayed gold
      of the afterglow. He was rather silent, not looking at her,
      but listening to all she said as though he were weighing
      every word of it and estimating its sincerity. He moved
      with long strides, shoulders slightly bowed, while she went
      boyishly with her shingled head, and her slim legs swinging
      under her short black skirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A counterfeit," he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      His silences disturbed her a little, though his reserve
      might be considered natural, a closed door. The opening of
      doors may prove an interesting amusement, but she was not
      conscious of amusing herself. All this could be considered
      to be a part of her sentimental adventure. She felt sorry
      for poor Arnold, a surly dog, sombre and shaggy. She was
      quite ready to allow her sympathy to stroke his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      His silence made her chatter. She had explained her
      sentimental journey, but had won no response from him, no
      murmur of approval. It was as though he did not take her
      seriously and that in spite of his own seriousness. She
      passed through frivolous moments, without desiring them,
      just as one may feel driven to giggles at a funeral, and
      then she caught herself up. She felt herself lacking in
      dignity, and in the twilight she seemed to become aware of
      a deepening dignity in him. Yes, a strangeness, a something
      that was impressive and a little frightening, as though the
      lion had escaped from his cage and was walking beside her,
      live and real and ominous.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt afraid. She offered him little fragments of
      appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One talks great nonsense--sometimes--just when one is
      feeling most serious. I miss--them--you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gravely--but with an air of caution--he supposed that she
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father--was a man--whom I greatly respected. He had
      such--simplicity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An old soldier. They were dears. One regrets some things."
    </p>
    <p>
      His impression of her was that she regretted nothing, and
      that she had forgotten how to feel things acutely. But had
      she ever felt things acutely?
    </p>
    <p>
      "One regrets one's mistakes," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--especially when one's mistakes--hurt--other people."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dusk she gave him a quick side glance, and he seemed
      unaware of it. How sombre and sad he looked! She supposed
      that it must have been difficult for him to understand her
      wild flight after those hayfield embraces. And then her
      marriage three months afterwards! But--he--too had married
      quickly. They had been opportunists--both of them, and
      neither could pretend to a romantic faithfulness. She began
      to blunder rather badly from the moment she assumed him to
      be an opportunist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you are as fond of the farm--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As fond--as it will let me be."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a little sentimental tilt of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Gore Wood,--full of primroses? I should like to take
      some primroses up to the graves--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked black.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Primroses.--O--yes--but not in Gore Wood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh? Yes,--I remember.--And those trees! O, Mr, Arnold--I
      was so sorry about those trees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No need. The wood is called Rose Wood--these days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pretty name."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a look of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After my wife. She managed to save those trees for me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah,--your wife--"
    </p>
    <p>
      And she thought--"The waitress," and he seemed to know that
      the word lay unspoken under tongue. They had reached the
      opening of the lane under Six Firs, and he paused and she
      with him. He had something that had to be said, but he did
      not hurry, and his silence was like a hook holding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some women help a man. My wife helped me. I was very happy
      with her. She was worth all the love a man could give,--I
      don't care much for anything--now that she's gone.--If you
      want to pick primroses--you can. You know the way. Good
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      He swung round, paused for a moment to look up at the tall
      firs, and then went off up the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would she dare!" he wondered; "to run about over our
      farm,--and into Rose's Wood? Would she dare?"

      That Arnold Furze should pretend to be inconsolable for the
      loss of his "waitress" roused in Mary a vague
      dissatisfaction. She took the feeling back with her to
      "Green Shutters," and tried to light one of her candles--in
      the porch, with the door open and a draught blowing in.
      Three successive flames hesitated and died in the darkness.
      She closed the door, and tried again, and the match and the
      candle came to terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      What coarse creatures men were! She carried her candle into
      the kitchen, and before she could find a candlestick the
      hot grease was running down her fingers. She let out a
      little--"O!" and put the candle down abruptly on the
      kitchen table where it consented to stand while she found
      the candlestick. But she gave up the quest for the moment,
      and stood with one hand placed against a cheek and chin,
      her eyes mirroring the candle flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      What manner of woman had she been, this common girl whom
      Furze had married? Had she been good to look at, and
      pleasant to kiss? Mary supposed that the woman must have
      had some power to move him. He had spoken movingly, but
      here her self-love edged in and whispered of pique, and she
      was ready to nod her head consentingly. The candle flame,
      swaying gently to and fro, repeated its movement in the
      blackness of her pupils. Had the woman been dark or fair,
      big or little, silent or merry? And so he had renamed Gore
      Wood after her, or said that he had. Moreover, the love
      between these two had been complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought stung her, and she turned peevishly to find the
      candlestick, and when she had found it--and steadied the
      candle in the socket with two wedged match-ends, she fell
      into more musings. She moved to and fro collecting things
      on a tray for her supper, but the subjective part of her
      held the stage. A waitress, perhaps a florid and rather
      fleshly young woman in a white apron, with black hair all
      fluffed out under a cheeky cap! Such women appealed!
    </p>
    <p>
      She mishandled a cup and saucer, and the cup slipped and
      broke on the floor. "Damn!" But where was her sentiment?
      She left the broken cup lying and took another from a hook
      on the dresser. The content of her inward consciousness was
      as narrow as the flame of the candle, far too narrow to
      include the nobler poignancies of life, its tendernesses
      and surrenders and great little heroisms, the courage of a
      woman who faces and conquers a seeming monotony. Monotony
      is the evil genius of the pale and feebly beating heart.
      She had given herself to material things, and to a cowardly
      and sensuous softness, and materialism straightened her
      emotions. She had no vision. She thought of Furze's wife as
      a woman with a body but not with a soul. Her envying of the
      dead woman was physical; she was jealous of what a dead
      woman had felt and made Furze feel. She could not raise her
      mood to other imaginings, or divine the richness of Rose's
      love, its brave and simple directness, its practical
      tendernesses, its motherliness, its strength. Poor little
      suburban madam! She had the great inspiration in her, and
      was blind to it as yet. She stood there looking at a
      flickering candle, feeling distraught and peeved and
      resentful, and also vaguely defiant. Mrs. Fream of Hill
      House--
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Furze had finished his milking and his tea. He was standing
      by the west window of the living-room, filling a pipe, and
      the window commanded the end of the lane and the field gate
      of the "Gore."
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her come down the lane, lift the catch of the gate,
      open it, pass into the field, and close the gate after her.
      She had a deliberate air. She did not glance in the
      direction of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she had dared! He was holding a lighted match, and the
      flame burnt its way towards thumb and finger. He dropped
      the match-end on the tiles, and took another, struck it,
      and holding the flame to the bowl of his pipe, sucked
      steadily. Two little hollows showed in his cheeks, and his
      forehead was ominous.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up his hat and went to the door, but his impulse
      was stayed there by some other emotion, and he stood
      holding the handle and biting hard on the pipe-stem. She
      had dared, and her very daring to do this thing was an
      affront to him and to the woman who was dead. That was how
      it touched him, and in touching him roused him to anger.
      Yes, and to more than anger. Vain, meddlesome, ineffectual
      little fool! Or was he to think of her more seriously as
      the city madam deliberately trespassing, wilfully
      provocative, and not caring how she provoked? To pick
      primroses? Indeed! Among those oak trees that would have
      fallen before her whimsies but for Rose! Monied insolence,
      with her casual air, and her mannerisms, and her nice
      clothes, and her little useless hands, and those eyes that
      could appear so soft and innocent!
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment there was an anger in him that transformed
      itself into a considered purpose. The impulse carried as
      far as the gate at the end of the yew hedge, but there he
      shook it off. He trembled with sudden pity, but the urge
      was still so fierce in him that it had to be countered. His
      eyes had a bleakness. He turned back and into the orchard,
      and went through it and up across the Sea field to Beech Ho
      wood, and so in deeply among the trees until the horizon
      showed as an occasional strip of blueness between the
      crowded trunks. He sat down between two old roots, with his
      back to a tree, and there he remained for two whole hours,
      holding himself chained while something tore at his vitals.
      Two thrushes were singing in the tree-tops, and save for
      their singing a vast silence reigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went back to the farm he saw something yellow
      attached to the gate at the end of the yew hedge. Going to
      look he found a little bunch of primroses tucked between
      two of the slats, and resting on the bar. She had fastened
      the stalks of the flowers with a twisted rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at the knot of yellow. What was the meaning of
      it? Another of her meddlesome little tricksies? Sentiment?
      Yes, her sentiment could hang on a gate, but it would grow
      no crops. Or was it saucy magnanimity, a superior gesture,
      a token of malapert forgiveness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Good God, what had she to forgive?
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the bunch of flowers and threw it into the pond.

      If Fream was dumb those days, his wife was blind. There
      were many little changes in him that should have been
      noticed by her and were not seen, for neither her eyes nor
      her thoughts were turned towards him, and her poor white
      guide-post stood as before with an arm pointing stiffly
      towards prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pathetic part of it was that he tried to attract her
      attention. He might have gone about banging doors, and
      displaying all the symptoms of a worried and irritable man
      in need of his wife's sympathy, but his appeal was more
      negative. He took to his bed for three days, and his
      Weyfleet doctor was sent for. Her grandee's indisposition
      quite failed to attract Mary's attention. Her thoughts were
      elsewhere, and her activities fluttering around the
      preparations for a hospital fête that was to be held in the
      Hill House grounds in June. She was the chairwoman of the
      Amusements Sub-committee, a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the use
      of Hill House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even financiers develop "livers" and migraine, and if Mary
      had a serious cloud in her sky it lay far south of
      Weyfleet. Their doctor told her that her husband had been
      overworking himself, which seemed to her absurd. Surely a
      man with so much money need not spend himself beyond the
      limits of his strength?
    </p>
    <p>
      She said as much to her grandee. She wandered into his room
      between a tennis party and a dinner, and sat on a chair by
      the window, and was casually kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Harper says you have been doing too much, Val. Surely
      it isn't necessary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay and looked at her rather like a sick dog. His eyes
      had a curious glassiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, not at all. Don't worry, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously she was not worrying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you use your car more, drive up to your
      office--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--I might do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had always been not a little shy of her, and now his
      shyness had become complete. He lay there and watched her,
      and thought what a very charming thing she looked with her
      soft white skin and her duskiness. He wanted to tell her
      the truth and yet he could not do it. He was dumb with an
      almost ridiculous dumbness, or like a man roped to his bed.
      Yet he had only to blurt out a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you have a week's fishing, Val?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a perfunctory suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Might do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take the car."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had closed his eyes, but she did not notice his closed
      eyes. Which dress should she wear? The primrose-coloured
      chiffon? That colour! Like the pale afterglow on that April
      evening, and the flowers in Gore Wood!
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, with eyes still closed,--"I suppose you are very
      busy, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--I am. The fête--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't manage a week?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I couldn't, Val. We are having committee
      meetings three times a week--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay very still, and stiff as a corpse. He understood now
      in a vague way why he could not tell her. He was like a man
      paralysed with fear, and unable to speak, but had she moved
      a finger, uttered one quick kind word, something in him
      would have been loosened, and he would have been able to
      tell her. He knew that he ought to tell her, but some
      emotion seemed necessary and there was no show of emotion
      between them. He felt like a dead man, and calmly she had
      covered his face with a sheet, and made ready to go to her
      dinner party.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a fool!" he thought, "what a strange--voiceless fool!
      She is just as amazingly blind as I am amazingly dumb. It's
      because I don't matter--"
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment he ceased to make any effort to tell her.
      It is possible that he ceased to have the wish to tell her.
      If he went over the cliff, well, she would be left on the
      ragged edge of it, horribly shocked no doubt--and
      frightened, and a little bewildered. But emotionally and
      physically she would be unharmed, though stripped of her
      luxuries. She would not be anywhere near starvation. She
      would be a whole woman, young, comely, desirable,
      childless, with a little house, a hundred or two a year,
      and her personal possessions. She would have more than when
      he married her.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, he got up out of his bed next day, and sent off three
      or four telegrams, and had some luggage packed and the
      chauffeur given his orders. Mary saw him off, standing on
      the steps of the portico, with the garden and the green
      park spreading securely at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enjoy yourself, Val."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was carried off like a wax-work figure in a
      stage-property coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Fream had no tongue, and his wife no eyes, their
      world could supply both deficiencies. The irresponsibly
      wise and the wisely irresponsible gossiped in the train and
      in the gardens. What was Fream doing, associating himself
      with Gaiter? There were funny rumours, circulating about
      the name and the reputation of Samuel Gaiter, and Fream was
      becoming involved in these rumours. Were these two lions or
      jackals, or was one of them a lion and the other a jackal?
      Yes, someone knew a clerk in the office of Fream's
      brokers,--and the clerk had hinted--Had he! Then the fellow
      was a disloyal skunk with too much silly vanity, an
      underling who chattered, the very worst sort of underling.
      A cheap little beast who wanted to show off. But the Freams
      seemed to have plenty of ready cash. He had sent a cheque
      for £500 to the local hospital. Bluff? O, perhaps!
      Financial rouge when your face was chalky. But certainly
      there was something queer about the fellow. He looked ill,
      more of a corpse than ever. You rarely saw him on the train
      now; went up in his car. Leslie spoke seriously to Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the position up there? Fream has always been such a
      close chap."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--Mary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose he has settled something on her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leslie said--"Damn! We ought to have made sure of that. But
      the fellow seemed so safe." He took a bigger whisky than
      usual, and looked at the toes of his wife's shoes. He
      confessed that he felt rather responsible. There were nasty
      rumours going about, but to Biddulph Mr. Gaiter was a fact
      more offensive than any rumour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't think why Fream went in with him. No need for it. If
      you can cut your own ice you don't get another chap to help
      you.--And Fream was cutting plenty of ice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's different," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Different! How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't explain it. Something--since their marriage. Not a
      complete success--in some ways--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, not so bad, old thing. He has given Mary a jolly fair
      show. But this difference--? Besides,--what difference
      could a marriage make to a chap's money-sense?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not explain it to him, though she had divined a
      difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing a man's self-confidence--goes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should it? You mean the marriage,--that he was
      disappointed--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Might be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--come, old thing, Marykin as Delilah! That's a bit far
      fetched. She has done everything a man like Fream could
      want her to do. Charming little figure-head up at Hill
      House, regular de luxe wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mary has done very well," said her sister. "And she
      is not worrying. She ought to be wise."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leslie opened his mouth to say that a man did not
      necessarily tell his wife everything, but thought better of
      it, and Clare knew it as well as he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might see Fream. But I don't cotton to the idea. Like
      asking a chap if his cheque is all right. Better if you
      sounded Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Present her with a few rumours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well,--I leave it to you. Personally I can't imagine
      old Percival figuring in a city sensation. Of
      course--Gaiter may be all right, but he smells of fox."
    </p>
    <p>
      And being a sanguine soul he left the matter there.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      With her sick grandee away fishing in Hampshire, Mary set
      out on her second pilgrimage into Sussex, with a hamper
      packed, and carrying an assurance from the foreman at the
      "Weyfleet Garage" that "Cherry" was in perfect condition.
      So was my lady. She felt sleek with an unconfessed
      curiosity. Her slim legs quivered. This would not be
      primrose time, but bluebell time. He had taken those
      primroses from the gate, for she had gone down the lane
      after dark to find the flowers had gone, and how was she to
      know that her bunch of primroses had played Ophelia in the
      "Doomsday" pond. Bluebell time in Gore Wood! She refused to
      think of it as Rose Wood. Not that she thought of working
      havoc among the bluebells like those beastly people who
      swarm up to Newlands Corner on Sundays, and tear up the
      flowers and leave their garbage upon the landscape.
      Bluebells amid the young green would be sufficient. They
      offered you their perfume. In Gore Wood greedy hands did
      not commit murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet "Doomsday" was no more than a great cloud floating over
      the Sussex hills. She did not pretend to give it her
      conscious attention; she was to stay a few hours at "Green
      Shutters," her country cottage in Sussex, and assure
      herself that the charwoman was doing her duty, and that old
      Hesketh's garden had been put in order. Nice sentiment. She
      proposed to have the garden kept just as her father had
      kept it, with the sweet peas in the same place, and the
      dahlias screening the winter greens.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so very modern, still so very young. Life was a
      game, a round of play; you worked hard at your little
      amusements in order to escape boredom, and you did not
      escape it. Like a flying nymph Mary had eluded the pursuit
      of the faun, but ennui was hard upon her heels, and
      gaining. She did not realize that her little paradise was
      full of other bored people.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, with this incipient plumpness of the soul she brought
      her sentimental playfulness to "Green Shutters," and
      feeling more sociably conventional--or more careful--than
      on her previous pilgrimage, she floated in upon the
      Perrivales and the Twists and invited them to tea with her.
      The charwoman, previously warned, had attended to light
      fires and prepare a bed, and wash up china. "Cherry" was
      taken up to Andrews' garage. Milk was delivered from
      "Doomsday" by young Blossom. It was yellow with cream. In
      the presence of her visitors she maintained an air of
      bright melancholy. She showed them the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my idea to keep it just as it was."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Perrivale, a good and simple soul, thought Mary
      greatly improved, "Quite a dear woman, so much kinder--you
      know." Old Perrivale, who had the face of an old and
      cynical tom-cat, preferred to see in Mrs. Fream's sleekness
      the effect of a changed environment. "More milk and more
      cream on it. Learnt to lap it." He smiled tolerantly over
      his wife's enthusiasms, and loved her for them, knowing
      that but for her he would have been a completely acid
      creature. But what was this sleek little city cat doing in
      Sussex? Hunting field mice? Straying cats may get their
      heads into rabbit snares.

    </p>
    <p>
      A thunderstorm on an afternoon in May! Surely it was as
      unusual as it was unexpected?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had dared Gore Wood a second time, and was sitting on
      the ash-grey stump of a felled oak in the midst of a pool
      of blueness. Wild violets looked at her from the dead oak
      leaves, scentless flowers, but the bluebells gave all the
      scent that was needed. A still, close air, and the perfume
      of the bells suffusing it. The leaf buds of the oaks were
      bronzing, and the hazels showed a yellowish green, and as
      the sky grew murky all these colours grew more vivid.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at the sky. There were great breaks of blue
      and piled-up cumulus cloud in the east, but the blue-black
      gloom was behind her. She was not aware of its menace, or
      of the suddenness with which the ragged grey fringe
      overhead would spread and thicken. The storm came with a
      bewildering abruptness; the sun had been shining into the
      wood a moment ago, and she was stooping to pick a few
      violets when the first peal of thunder rumbled. She looked
      up, and a few heavy raindrops pattered on the dry leaves;
      the flash had been very close, on the hill behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, with a protesting look at the sky. She was
      afraid of thunderstorms, always had been as a child; they
      roused an unreasoning panic in her. But trees were
      dangerous; she had neither umbrella nor raincoat, and her
      rose-coloured jumper and crêpe skirt would keep out no
      rain, so she picked herself up and climbed over the locked
      gate into the Gore field. If the storm broke badly before
      she reached the lane she could shelter in one of the farm
      buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did break. The black canopy seemed to rend itself just
      above her head. A wind came soughing through the oaks
      behind her. She looked up and round,--and ran. Rain pursued
      her flying feet as she climbed the long slope towards the
      farm. She was frightened before the storm had finished with
      her, for half-way up the field a flash seemed to strike
      into the hedge skirting the lane. The glare made her close
      her eyes for a moment, and into that brief darkness the
      thunder crashed as though the sky was falling about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that she ran like a wild thing, mouth open, eyes dark
      and brittle. She reached the field gate, panting, just as
      another flash came, and with the crackle of it a sheet of
      rain dropped as from a rent cistern of lead. She was over
      the gate like a frightened cat clawing her way over a fence
      with a dog at her tail. Farm--buildings, no! She ran
      straight for the house through a rattle of rain, pushed
      through the gate, and made for the hood of the porch. Her
      panic was in no by-your-leave mood either. She put a hand
      to the latch and burst in, dripping, huge-eyed, her mouth a
      pale crevice sucking air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the doorway of the living-room she saw a man
      bending over a wood fire, and in the act of lifting a
      kettle from the hook of the chain. He turned and looked at
      her. His face seemed to catch some of the darkness of the
      sky.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly the quality of her fear changed. She knew that
      she was afraid of him, and of the house, but the fear was
      different, and human. It was less urgent than her fear of
      the storm. It contained curiosity, a tremor of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so sorry--But may I shelter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her intently. How was she to know that she
      came dressed in another memory, with her wet hair and face,
      and the moist rush of the rain for a leitmotiv. So, Rose
      had come to him; but how different had been her coming. A
      pang of pain went through him. How he had missed his wife's
      succouring hands! And this useless creature, fluttering in
      out of the storm, and looking scared and wild-eyed and
      plaintive!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so. Better shut the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shut it, and seemed to straighten herself, and to shrug
      herself into her dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So sudden.--I was looking at your bluebells.--It will soon
      be over--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His back was half turned; he replaced the kettle on the
      hook, and watched the fire for a moment, while her eyes
      were throwing quick glances about the room. It was as she
      had first remembered it, with its working bench and its
      litter and its rude maleness. His wife had not changed his
      habits, or was it that he had gone back to them? And why
      did he not ask her to sit down?
    </p>
    <p>
      He straightened. He did not look at her, but out of the
      west window. And his face puzzled her with its sternness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an order, and she obeyed it, moving delicately to
      the old sofa under the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please--don't let me interfere--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a quick hard stare which seemed to say--"My
      lady,--you won't. If you have come here to play with me--be
      careful. You played with me before--I have not forgotten."
      He had moved across the room, and was leaning against the
      table, and when he had given her that wise, hard glance, he
      raised his eyes to the west window, and watched the rain
      coming down. His silence was like the silence of a sky
      before thunder, but Mary had lived with a silent man. She
      thought that Furze was shy of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid you will have to wait till it is over."
    </p>
    <p>
      She flinched to a flash that seemed very near the house,
      but though he was aware of her flinching his face showed
      her no sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have always been such a coward--in a storm."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again that hard wise stare of his. "In other situations--as
      well as storms," it said. "You should be afraid now--and of
      other things besides the lightning." He was thinking too
      that she had audacity, and that her tremblings and
      flinchings were part of the play. Provocative--? He seemed
      to gather himself up; he went deliberately to the door of
      Mrs. Damaris' parlour and opened it. He disappeared from
      her view. She wondered what he was going to do in there;
      she remembered the breaking of the pink lustre milk-jug;
      perhaps there was a window to be shut. And then she heard
      three chords struck heavily upon the piano. He had dragged
      up a chair, and had opened the lid of the keyboard. He sat
      down and played Schumann, while pipes and gutters gurgled,
      and the sky trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extraordinary man! The piano had not been tuned for a year;
      its wires were rusty, and so were his fingers, but there
      was a fierceness in his playing. She sat there, not knowing
      what to make of it. Was she to regard it as a serenade or
      as a part of the storm? But she was most strangely affected
      by it, as though some primal wildness in her responded to
      both curiosity and fear. It seemed to her to be both a
      serenade and a storm, and that she had escaped from the
      passion of the elements to the strings of a more mysterious
      struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once she rose, either to go into the other room or out of
      the house. A double storm! She hesitated and resumed her
      seat, and Schumann went on. So did the storm. She was very
      wet, and beginning to feel the chill of it, and presently
      she slipped across to the fire and knelt down and opened
      her arms to it. A moist vapouriness rose from her figure.
      And suddenly a great beam of sunlight slanted into the room
      and its light centred upon her. She glowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schumann had ceased. Furze was standing in the doorway,
      looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is clearing," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose from her knees. Her eyes went to his and then
      wavered aside towards the window. What did he want? What
      was his inward attitude towards her? He seemed to be
      waiting, menacing and silent, as though he held her fate in
      his hands, but was offering her a last chance to escape
      from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better go--while it is fine."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled faintly. He was watching her,--and
      wondering--Didn't she understand? Was this mere tricksy
      wilfulness--? Did she not realize that it was dangerous to
      play with a man such as he was, a man who felt that there
      would be a primitive rightness in the overwhelming of her?
      She had better go while she had the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's over."
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed the room and slipped past him, and as she went
      by him her downward--dark eyes both hid and betrayed her
      Eve's knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Arnold.--I'm sorry--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her go down the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twice," he said to himself. "Three would be a fatal
      number. The chance is in your knees--my dear. Think well."
    </p>
    <p>

      Her Eve's knowledge remained with her, and she carried it
      back with her to Hill House, and suffered it to have its
      way with her and to ferment like sweet wine. Her curiosity
      had remained unsatisfied. She had her own emotional picture
      of the man who had been her lover, yet not so wholly her
      lover as he might have been, or could be--No, not that, not
      utterly that! She divined a closed door, and behind it a
      resolute hostility. But what sort of hostility? She did not
      think that he hated her; she had never thought so even when
      she was exclaiming over his hatred, and counting it as
      homage. He was refusing to be her friend, just a
      sentimental friend--of course, for though she went nicely
      shod upon the adventure she wore the shoes of convention.
      That she was loitering irresponsibly outside a closed door
      and daring herself to open it she would have strenuously
      denied. She was Mrs. Fream of Hill House, a conspicuous and
      responsible young woman; she had a husband and a hospital
      fête on her hands; she was neither bold-faced nor sly. But
      like many excellent women she thought that she might allow
      herself to be sentimental, and to throw the flower of her
      sentiment at an old lover, and avert her head nicely, and
      perhaps allow him to touch her hand. "Poor Arnold; I'm so
      sorry." And she was to be sorrier than she knew,
      disastrously sorry, and to be smothered in reality instead
      of in a little syrupy mess of make-believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her grandee came back from his fishing, and she gave him
      but little attention. "Much better, my dear, thanks"--and
      she accepted the statement without scrutiny. Life was
      proving somewhat pleasant. She presided over the Amusements
      Sub-commitee, and agreed with the decision of the full
      committee that the fête should be held on June 18, when the
      grass in the park might be expected to have become hay. O,
      yes, that could be arranged. Hill House had no need of hay;
      the grass could be cut and carted away any time in June.
      Some small man might be glad of it. But--hay? If there was
      a hay harvest in Surrey, there would be a hay harvest in
      Sussex! Suggestive thought! She allowed it to penetrate
      her, to possess her, to perfume her magnanimity; it became
      a germinating sentiment, a sensitive provocation. Poor
      Arnold had been her father's friend. He should be hers.
      Forgive and forget. But do not forget completely. Let there
      be a swift, secret backward glance; a little secure and
      romantic remembering. Charming Mrs. Fream! She wished to
      appear charming to her farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, leave it to impulse, let the very adventure itself
      seem a matter of impulse.

      She made the announcement during dinner, and he looked
      across at her and yet not at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before the fête. One can't leave things to other
      people,--and I want to see the garden--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went off into a stare, and when he came out of it he had
      the look of a man whose doctor had given him grievous news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Might go fishing again," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, do, Val. It did you so much good."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very silent for the rest of the meal, more silent
      than usual, but she was accustomed to these mute meals, and
      his distant gloom cast no shadow over her.

      June was hot and dry, following upon a wet winter and a
      showery spring, and in the Long Meadow and in Rushy Bottom
      and the Gore, Furze had never seen a heavier crop of all
      these spearing grasses, the Ryes, Fescues, Poas, Sweet
      Vernals, Foxtails, with white clover to give bottom and
      richness. They were a wonderful sight these hay fields,
      especially when the evening sun shone among the grasses,
      and the silver of their ripeness became gold and the wild
      sorrel was turned to flame. Or when a wind blew and the
      whole field seemed to flow. Each evening, after the heat of
      the day, Furze would wander down into these fields and look
      at the ripening flower-spikes. Never had he seen a year so
      proud of its growth; the foxgloves in Gore Wood stood seven
      feet high. And the good weather looked like holding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll cut to-morrow, Will."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Saturday, Mary left her baggage at "Green Shutters,"
      and drove "Cherry" to the Carslake garage, and walking back
      in the June heat, heard a reaper at work. It droned liked
      some great insect, and pausing at the end of the "Doomsday"
      lanes she climbed the mound of the Six Firs and looked down
      into the valley. She could see the Long Meadow with the
      grey swathes running like broad ribbons across the pallor
      of the shorn grass, and in the centre a square of hay still
      standing, and the reaper working round it. The two grey
      horses drew the machine, and Furze guided it. His shirt was
      a speck of whiteness. Down by Gore Wood, Will was scything
      the dead corner just as he had scythed it three years ago.
      Everything was the same, the men, the beasts, the fields,
      the drone of the reaper, the June heat, the smell of the
      firs. The eternal and beautiful sameness of the soil, seed
      sowing and harvest, sunlight and shadow!
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt the spell of it, a drowsy languor, the magic of an
      old memory, and perhaps she realized that there is
      repetition in memories and emotions. Nothing is new, but
      upon the soil everything is renewed, and returns with a
      happy freshness. Brocades and velvets grow old and dim, but
      the turf puts on a new gloss each year, and with the soil
      the soul of man renews itself. It touches the earth and is
      reborn. Toil and sweat pass, and by the fruits of the earth
      the soul of man is comforted. In cities it is otherwise.
      Men chatter, and are never still, reaping a fruitless
      restlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned from that landscape with a curious and deep
      drawing of the breath. A sigh! Her adventure felt the June
      heat and the droning rattle of the reaper. She went
      languidly down to Cinder Town, and made tea, and carried a
      deck chair into the garden to find a little patch of shade
      under one of the apple trees. She sat and dreamed herself
      into a drifting, languid purpose; she was June, a memory, a
      scent of fragrant grasses. She let herself drift. Hay
      harvest, the fruits of the soil, pollen and seed vessels, a
      sinking sun, woods all green and gold, the gradual and
      subtle sloth of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did she call the adventure fate, or guess whither it
      tended? Perhaps she did not think of it at all, but stole
      down and away with the lengthening sun shafts, and smelt
      the honeysuckle in a hedge, and saw the flush of a wild
      rose. A bat fluttered back from hedge to hedge, coming and
      going over the old thorns. She passed through a gate, and
      through a second gate. The smell of the hay smote her. Yes,
      everything was the same with a disastrous and sweet
      sameness. The pale swathes had been drawn together. Even
      the hay-cock was there close under the secret gloom of the
      oak trees. The hills were on fire. In the valley the
      twilight and the dew were falling.

    <p>
      He stood looking down at her, and his face was strange. She
      saw the tan of his throat and chest where the unbuttoned
      shirt lay open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She twisted a strand of hay, and her eyes fell before his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm trespassing; I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twice," he said; "twice was dangerous. Three times is too
      much. Life isn't a game."
    </p>
    <p>
      He came nearer and stood over her as she sat in the hay,
      with the dusk gathering and her face growing white in it.
      She looked at her knees. She had a sudden sense of her
      danger, and neither knew whether to be glad or afraid, and
      yet even when the wave was breaking over her she could not
      realize the crisis. Serious? O,--a little--But then--of
      course--she would speak softly to him, and remain secure,
      throned upon a memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't forgiven me."
    </p>
    <p>
      His silence seemed to gather like the dusk. It hung over
      her like suspense, or a question that had to be answered.
      She tried to put reproach into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--you didn't understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered her with fierce curtness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understood. You hadn't the courage to be serious. You
      wanted to play at life. To me--it wasn't a game. Life is
      serious on a farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to cower a little, to crouch like a bird. And he
      kept so still--but it was the stillness of the hunter ready
      to seize and to hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was afraid, Arnold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God--" he said, and seemed to shake, and she saw his
      right hand gripping his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't you afraid--now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No." Her eyes betrayed the lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cheated me, my dear. I let it pass; I got over it. And
      you--? What gave you the cheek to come here--and try to
      play--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arnold!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's true. You--skirker--. But not this time. Do you
      understand me--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed all eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--no.--I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll play the game through--to the end."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, fluttering like a bird, but the flutter did not
      carry her far, nor had she expected to escape. Had she
      hoped to escape? She struggled. "O, Arnold--.I can't--I'm
      married--" He held her and was silent, but his silence was
      like his arms, implacable; he was a man fanatical,
      inflamed, conscious of working a primitive justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've known what love is--. But you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her up, held her hard against him, and carried
      her to the hay-cock,--and there--in a little while she was
      clinging to him and giving him kisses.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was the words that he spoke to her afterwards, when they
      were climbing the dark slope of the Gore field, that were
      scattered like the thorns of a penance under her feet. She
      had tried to hold to his arm as though they had come
      through some shipwreck together, but he had put her aside
      and walked apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, my dear, and I'm not sorry. Now, everything is
      finished between us. You have paid for the heartache you
      gave me."
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly the slope of the hill seemed to her very black
      and steep. She faltered; she drooped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Arnold--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her breathing pleaded, and her eyes were as big as the
      night. She felt broken, unable to bear alone the secret of
      the thing that had happened to her, or to suffer so
      exultantly under the shadow of his triumphant aloofness.
      "Cruel," she cried--"O, cruel"--and saw the rim of the moon
      lifting itself above a hedge, and the hillside growing
      grey. She put an arm over her face, and sobbed a little,
      but her emotion was dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that he began to speak to her in a deliberate
      and relentless voice. He seemed to be speaking to himself
      as well as to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a hard man--my dear--now. I didn't use to be
      hard,--but then--life--the way it has treated me.--They
      tell you that life--and all that it makes you
      suffer--should not make you hard. I don't know--. In these
      days doesn't everybody hold a knife at life's throat and
      growl--'Pay up,--or I'll slit you'? O, yes--. Look at the
      way the country is being held up and bled.--Hard--yes; you
      have to be hard. And now--you and I--! Well, what of it--?
      You dared the hardness in me. We are quits."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was as white as the moon's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--man--" she said, "are you as hard to your beasts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the field gate, and she leaned upon it,
      covering her face with her arms. There was silence. He
      stood staring at the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to sob, and he looked at her curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No use--that. Besides--what is there to weep about? We
      shall never see each other again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sobbing ceased, and gave place to a little wailing cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--Arnold! Is it fair--? It wasn't that that shamed
      me,--but the reason for it--your reason--. I could have
      forgiven--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was nothing to forgive.--I've made you touch
      reality--my dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, cruel," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hung there, her face between her hands, her eyes on the
      moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that why men--stab women--? Those horrible cases--one
      reads of. To teach them reality? Oh,--I know I have been a
      coward--. But need you have made me--this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent, standing in the shadow of the hedge. She was
      shivering; he could feel the quivering of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I live on the soil. The soil gives nothing for nothing. No
      escape--from that.--You should not have come back here,
      Mary. The soil took its toll--."
    </p>
    <p>
      But his voice was gentle. His "Mary" was almost like his
      "Mary" of the old days, and yet his gentler tone filled her
      with an indescribable anguish. It was as though his
      kindness would hurt her more than his hardness. It would
      utter accusations, accusations that she could not meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--I think I'll go home--now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched her lightly on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, go home. That other life is yours, my dear. Perhaps
      I'm not so hard--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the gate for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I come along the lane--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again--a little stifled cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--I'm afraid--. I'm such a coward. What have you done to
      me--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing.--And everything. Somehow--we shall have to
      forgive each other--this. Your coming was wrong, mad. My
      retort to it--well--savage. I ought to
      have--thought--perhaps.--But who thinks--always.--Life
      isn't thinking--. It is being born--and being made to
      feel--and being dead. Come,--my dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He led her down the lane, under the shadow of the hedge,
      and there was silence between them, a silence that had
      moments of resignation and pity and consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the Six Firs she put up her face to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kiss me--just once--Arnold--as you might have kissed
      me--if I had been brave--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," he said,--and kissed her very gently on the
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when she had gone from him--alone--into the night--he
      felt that his hardness had gone with her. Something in him
      felt humbled and rather hopeless.

    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was close to the gate of "Green Shutters" before she
      saw the car. She stood still. The bulk and the blackness of
      the thing were familiar, and the moonlight touched the
      silver mascot on the radiator of "Ph&oelig;bus Apollo." His
      car!
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook at the knees, for already life had shaken her
      sufficiently, and she shrank from the thought of meeting
      him as she had not shrunk before. Something had happened to
      her; she had been held in the arms of reality, she was a
      different woman. But that black chariot and its
      implications had to be faced. She pulled herself together;
      she felt hot from head to heel; she was a bird beating
      itself against conjectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw a dim figure at the wheel, and the peak of a
      chauffeur's cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that you, Sandys?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man moved uneasily, and spoke in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam.--Mrs. Biddulph--and Mr. Biddulph--. In the
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt a rush of relief. O, only Clare and Leslie
      springing a surprise upon her! But why had they come in
      "Ph&oelig;bus," and at this hour? Her anxiety returned, and
      in another guise. She opened the gate, and found a figure
      waiting for her by the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary--"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been out rambling--. Why?--Is anything--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aware of a hand; it took her by the arm. She went
      into the house with her sister, and the house had nothing
      to light it but the light of the moon. Through an open
      doorway she had a glimpse of a man standing by the window
      with his hands in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We could not find anything to light." With her burden of
      suspense growing heavier she said that there were candles
      in the kitchen. But why--?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell her, darling," said the man by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      She clung suddenly to Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it,--what--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something has happened to Val.--You must come back at
      once. Get your things--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked no more questions. She showed no emotion, but
      went into the kitchen and lit a candle, and reappeared with
      a strangely still white face. Her muteness surprised them,
      the consenting and silent fatalism that seemed to possess
      her. Did she suspect? Had she known more than they had
      imagined? Had she been prepared--? The candle flame was
      mirrored in the large and dusky eyes; it did not tremble;
      she looked at them strangely, as though she were half
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going back--at once--"
    </p>
    <p>
      A nod from Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll get my things.--I'll not be a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard her ascend the stairs, and they stood by the
      window and looked at each other in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She can't know.--Too calm. An emotional creature--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare was biting a lip. It was a bad business, a deplorable
      business, and the worst might yet be to come. That is to
      say the worst as it would appear to Clare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She may--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow, she will have to be told. I'll sit in front with
      the chauffeur.--He won't hear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's my affair, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better from you, old thing.--But she must come to our
      place--to-night. Can't take her up there--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, she had better come to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard Mary upon the stairs. She appeared with a
      suit-case and the candle, and Biddulph hurried to take the
      suit-case from her. He appeared more disturbed than either
      of the women. His voice was kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Mary, Got a warm coat? I'll lock up. Key's in
      the door, isn't it? You go along with Clare. Right; I'll
      take the candle."
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her go out calmly, buttoning up her motoring
      coat. She had not troubled to put on a hat, and her
      shingled head looked boyish and sleek and most strangely
      secure on its slim neck. So must many a beauty have looked,
      unconscious of the axe, blind to the mischances and the
      incredible ficklenesses of men and things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By George, she can't know," he thought; "but--then--women
      are queer."
    </p>
    <p>
      The car was swinging into the main road when Mary asked her
      question. She did not look at Clare, but seemed to watch
      the beams of the car's headlights sweeping the hedge. Black
      changed to green and green to black.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened to Val?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand touched her knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An accident."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke as though she knew. She ignored the hand on her
      knee, and sat stiffly in her corner, watching the road
      sliding under the bonnet of the swift car. The silver
      Ph&oelig;bus glistened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did it happen--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An accident, at least--we hope so. A pistol,--cleaning it,
      or playing with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some time this afternoon. They sent down to us. We thought
      it best to come for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was all. Mary asked no more questions; she seemed
      to withdraw into a corner of silence, a silence that was
      defensive and incomprehensible, and Clare left her
      undisturbed. She remembered that as a child Mary had always
      been for secret corners when there had been storms or
      chastisements. Besides, the affair was too deplorable. You
      might exercise your tact for ever and do no good. You might
      smuggle away some unpleasant details. Fream had shot
      himself deliberately. They had found him in the library
      huddled up in a chair, the pistol still in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mary! She sat there, wrapped up in silence, looking
      round-eyed at reality. Such happenings in a few short
      hours; first, a wound, and pain that was half ecstasy, and
      then--clapped upon it suddenly--this ice! Something in her
      still throbbed beneath the cold pressure of the news. She
      was bewildered. She had felt so much and so poignantly that
      she had ceased to feel. She sat and stared at a road that
      seemed to be drawn out of a slit of darkness, and to wind
      itself into the body of the speeding car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reality!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet her feeling of bewilderment increased. She let herself
      sink into a sick-bed of silence; she seemed unable to make
      an effort, and so to rise to meet reality. She lay and
      stared with wide eyes at a meaningless white surface. It
      was past midnight, and she was in bed at "Caradoc," the
      occupant of that familiar pink room from which she had
      emerged three years ago to become Mrs. Percival Fream. And
      Val was dead! The signpost had fallen. She seemed unable to
      realize it.

    </p>
    <p>
      The days that followed were days of mute bewilderment. It
      was like a fog muffling her world, with all the familiar
      outlines growing dim. Things seemed to happen in the midst
      of a befogged silence; they concerned her and yet they
      seemed to be happening outside herself; life moved in a
      mist; faces were misty; voices came to her very small and
      strange. She could not feel. There would be brief
      troublings of the fog; she would feel a cold wind, some new
      strange chilliness, and the fog would return. She went
      about softly and sedately, with frightened eyes, wearing
      her black with an air of wistful consent. Sometimes she
      would wonder a little at her own deadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had shock upon shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the inquest. She had come away from it still more
      chilled and bewildered. She had answered questions; her
      voice and her answers had been negative. The room and the
      faces had seemed all grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Val had shot himself. It had been suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little whimper of pity had come to her, but it had died
      like the cry of a new-born child that has not the strength
      to live. Something stifled it. The fog continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a funeral, a strange, dry-eyed ceremony, a
      creeping into carriages and a creeping out of them, black
      clothes, and still grey faces, a voice. The whole world
      seemed very still. She glided about in it on soft,
      shuffling feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then--those other happenings, Leslie's solemn face, his
      kind and laboured hints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hill House was hers no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor the furniture, nor "Ph&oelig;bus," nor Pollock, nor the
      flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some strange, dim, official person was in control. There
      had been public clamour. The very newspapers were smuggled
      away from her. Clare had a face of still austerity;
      Leslie's shone like a kind sun through the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wave was engulfing her world. It was disappearing.
      Round-eyed, mute, she watched it and wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last her silence broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leslie,--I want you to tell me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What it all means."
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her as gently as he could, sitting beside her in
      the "Caradoc" garden under a lime tree that was full of the
      music of bees. There had been a crash,--O--yes--a very
      disastrous crash. A man named Gaiter,--thorough scoundrel.
      Poor Val had been dropped over a financial precipice. Yes,
      he--Leslie--was quite convinced that her husband had been a
      victim. But the results--rather calamitous. People making a
      fuss, liquidator in charge, Gaiter being looked for by the
      Continental police, everything sealed up. Poor Val's will?
      Well, so much waste paper. Hill House and everything in it,
      and the money at the bank, and the cars--and the very wine
      in the cellar ear-marked for the creditors.
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't I anything, Leslie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, yes, my dear. Your clothes--and jewellery, and all
      that, personal possessions. And 'Green Shutters' is all
      right, and any money your people left you, and the cash in
      your private account."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is something," he said, "something."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mouth quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Val," she said, "O--poor Val. How he must have--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The fog broke. She floated out into reality, into an April
      of sudden tears. She was out of her self in a world of pity
      and reproach, of shadows and sunlight and young greenness,
      of yearnings and of plaintive memories. O, poor Val, poor
      voiceless--ineffectual Val! Poor, blind, playful selfish
      self! Poor Arnold! Poor world!

    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards a short season of serenity came to her, and she
      sat and looked calmly at the wreckage, and wondered at it
      and at herself. She was surprised at her own calmness. She
      discovered in herself a new and questioning attitude
      towards the immediate past, and since past, present, and
      future are all part of the same skein, this questioning
      mood of hers had the significance of life. Had she been
      happy? What was happiness? What were the things she had
      lost? Did she regret the loss of them?
    </p>
    <p>
      That was one of her discoveries. She did not regret the
      wreckage, but the manner of the wrecking, her share in it,
      her participation, the human memory tangled up in it. Poor
      grandee! He had left her a letter, a pathetic letter, about
      the only articulate utterance she had had from him. A dead
      man's message, piteous, apologetic, gentle. "My nerve went.
      I could not handle things--or see them. A sort of
      blindness. Try and forgive me the mess--"
    </p>
    <p>
      So, two men had touched her bosom with the hot iron of
      reality. Women are generous. She forgave them both, but did
      not forgive herself, and as in the pangs of childbirth
      there came to her a new day and a new consciousness. The
      humility of the eternal mother. Women forgive men many
      things, the passion to possess, the hardness of the
      striver, the arrogance, their work obsessions, the taking
      of their toil for granted. But had she not taken things for
      granted? She knew now that she had. She had moments when
      she spurned and rent and destroyed. Something was loose in
      her, a creature that had torn off mere sensibility, and
      become more finely alive. She understood passion, its
      cruelties and ravagings, its ultimate sanctity, if any
      sacred thing is to come out of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had had--as it were--a double annunciation. She had
      given birth both to death and to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor little Mrs. Fream."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were those who thought that she could be safely
      pitied, and most of them would have prophesied that she
      would be an adept at self-pity. She wasn't. Faced with
      defeat she found that there was more of her father in her
      than she knew. In the words of the kind and platitudinous
      Leslie--"Women are queer." But her queerness was
      sacramental. She might have become a sentimental whimperer,
      or a wide-eyed widow brushing like a cat against the legs
      of fortune, or a mere complaining young busybody. She
      stayed at "Caradoc" for three weeks, and then went quietly
      into rooms in Weyfleet village. She was a bird of passage,
      resting on a bough or the rigging of a ship, and she knew
      it. Whither? The instinct at the back of her mind, the
      poise before the impulse of the second flight? Perhaps she
      was aware of its tendency, more aware than she would allow.
      She had a sense of direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It pointed towards compassion. Not to self-pity, for
      self-pity flutters in a circle. It began as perception.
      Life had hurt her; she had cried out. Life hurt other
      people,--and their cries--! Yes, the perception grew
      towards feeling, echoing, understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who was it that had said to her that life was serious,--and
      not a game?

    <p>
      Hesketh Viner had been very fond of a row of Michaelmas
      daisies that screened one side of the vegetable garden.
      Tall sheaves of green, and bursting into a shower of rose
      and white and purple stars, a September gale had been among
      them, breaking the perfunctory bands that Mary's casual man
      had drawn tight about them like apron strings. Waving every
      way, or draggling their colours in the soil, they had
      called for succour, and they had not called in vain. Poor
      Coode, that leaner upon fences, had come in with a handful
      of bass and a bundle of bean rods, and had set to work upon
      the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was discovered there, a strand of bass in his mouth, and
      his arms about the waist of one of the tall clumps. She
      stood and watched him for a moment. She had wandered down
      through the garden before entering the house. It had been
      raining, and a black mackintosh hung over one arm; her
      shoes were muddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's neighbourly," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was startled. He pulled the bass out of his mouth, and
      went red, and looked at her with one dead blue eye and one
      very live one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one did. Why should they? My things are coming down in
      the carrier's van."
    </p>
    <p>
      His one eye grew bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things--! Then--you are staying--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--staying--for good."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked around her at the garden, while Coode fingered a
      piece of bass, and did nothing with it, and devotedly gazed
      at her. It seemed to him that she was different, but
      then--of course--she would be different after such a
      tragedy and so stark a reverse of fortune. She was wearing
      black, and let her hair grow. Her eyes looked to him very
      large and soft, her face very firm and white, but it was
      the way she stood and spoke and gazed at things that made
      him aware of her difference. She was very self-composed,
      more sure of herself, more silent, more deliberate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Weeds," she said, "plenty of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That chap of yours," he began, and realized that he was
      telling tales.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her smile, and her very smile seemed different.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who likes work--really? Does anybody?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Depends on whom you work for, yourself--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved aside, and looked beyond the garden, and becoming
      more conscious of the direction of her gaze, turned
      quickly, and renewed her talk with him. He--too--had
      resumed his work upon the flowers. Too much gazing was not
      good for one forlorn eye, and though she was so near he had
      a feeling that she was farther from him than she had ever
      been.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shan't need a man now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do things for myself. Besides--economy--"
    </p>
    <p>
      So she was poor again. How wrong, and yet how right!
      Poverty set a halo about her, though no one knew better
      than poor Coode that it is shameful to be poor, for the
      creed of St. Francis is as dead as the saint. If you are
      poor you can save your pride by pretending to have no
      appetite. He drew a length of bass about the green sheaf,
      and contemplated in her what appeared to him to be an
      adorable dignity, a high courage. To stoop to weeds!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of her turning towards the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder--if you would help me--when my luggage comes?
      There is rather a lot of it,--and one or two packing
      cases."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He glowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything I can do,--delighted--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you so much--Oh,--and could you spare me a little
      milk? I did some shopping in the village ou my way
      down,--but milk--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plenty. I'll get it now--You'll want tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of asking her to let him make tea for her,--but
      he was subdued by the new dignity of hers. Somehow he
      divined the veil about her, a veil that was not to be
      touched or lifted. He was one of those sensitive creatures,
      with a long, round-browed head, and an occiput that bulged
      out over a thin neck, a self-effacing creature full of
      "Don't mention it--" and "Please excuse my glove." He went
      off and fetched her his own milk; he could drink his tea
      without it. She had entered the house. He placed the jug on
      the doorstep under the porch, knocked apologetically and
      returned to his asters. But they were her asters. He stood
      fingering a piece of bass, while his mind played with
      invisible knots. Was it quite tactful of him to remain in
      her garden? Ought he not to efface himself, respect the
      veil? He tied up one more sheaf, and then nobly slunk away,
      and closed his gate with nice emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary had entered the house. Her bag stood on the table; her
      mackintosh hung across the back of a chair. She sat down.
      She gazed about her with wide and deliberate eyes. She was
      at home. The room was very small, the furniture shabby and
      ugly, the pictures still more ugly. Well and good. She
      looked steadily at everything, the darned hearth-rug, the
      period mahogany table, the horrible little old chiffonier
      behind the door, the chairs with their worn white and green
      cretonne covers, the three-legged black coal-pot, the steel
      fire-irons that were always rusting. Here was reality as
      nine women out of ten know it, a cheap ugliness,
      makeshifts, shams.
    </p>
    <p>
      But was it so? She stood up, and her gaze went inward.
      Objects were objects, kettles, tables, saucepans, forks,
      sheets, pastry-boards. They were made by and for hands.
      Human hands. There was humanity behind them. Certainly a
      woman's work is drudgery, if she has the soul of a drudge.
      But if she looks on it as something else, service,
      self-discipline, part of the essential scheme of
      things,--what then? Work has a soothing quality of its own.
      It is food and drink. It may contain love.
    </p>
    <p>
      She carried her bag upstairs into her little old room, and
      her eyelids flickered for a moment. There was the bed to be
      made, but first--the sheets and blankets would have to be
      aired. A fire, that most essential of human tasks, the
      kindling of a fire. No home--in the country--without
      someone's hands in contact with blackness, unless you wear
      gloves. She would wear gloves. She went down with something
      of the solemnity of a young priestess, and filled the
      scuttle and brought in wood, and laid a fire in the range
      and lit it. It burned. She sat on her heels and watched it
      burn, and remembered how she had hated repetition. But life
      was repetition,--with a difference. You could make the
      difference yourself; you could transcend your environment,
      or make your environment accept your atmosphere. Smile at a
      mirror, and it smiles back at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was in no smiling mood. Deliberately she had come
      to do battle with things that had routed her; she attacked.
      When she filled the kettle she found that it had developed
      a leak. Without a frown, but with an air of supreme
      calmness, she exchanged the kettle for a saucepan. Her odd
      woman about the house had equalled the perfunctoriness of
      the odd man in the garden. All the china would need dusting
      before it could be used; the grate was rusty; the scullery
      pail was missing, and she found it in the garden. A greasy
      dish-clout hung over the edge of the sink; there was no
      soap; an empty sardine-tin, match-ends, and tea-leaves
      still remained in an old chipped bowl on the
      draining-board.
    </p>
    <p>
      She set to work, without haste, and with a face that had a
      look of austerity. This was no picnic, but a probation; it
      was for to-day, to-morrow, and all days. She had a house,
      some clothes, and about one hundred and twenty pounds a
      year. She neither could nor would afford a servant.
      Monotony--yes. But monotony had driven her forth upon
      adventure; she had played, and the play itself had begun to
      be monotonous. Perhaps she had realized that monotony is
      your self's self; run from it, and it will follow and leap
      upon your shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, there would be someone to observe her seriousness,
      or--at least--she hoped that he would observe it. Whether a
      completely disinterested purpose can be discovered is a
      problem for the theorists; she had her eyes on "Doomsday,"
      but they had become serious eyes. There was no escape for
      her from the thought that she had helped to mishandle the
      lives of two men. In the old days romantic regrets might
      have persuaded her into a convent, but remembering a live
      man's arms she set herself to wash pots and pans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her baggage arrived by the carrier, and Coode came in and
      helped with it and effaced himself when he had done all
      that she had asked him to do. A van from Carslake delivered
      groceries; another van brought her bread. After three hours
      of unpacking, and cleaning, and putting her home in order,
      she prepared a meal that was both tea and supper. She had
      ordered a tin of salmon, and she cut herself rather badly
      when using the tin opener. Blood flowed. She went and held
      her hand under the tap, and having bound it up with a clean
      handkerchief, she completed the opening of the tin. Tea in
      the kitchen would have saved her trouble, but with
      solemnity she carried her tray into the living-room and
      spread a white cloth. Three spots of blood had soaked
      through the handkerchief, and they showed red as she took
      up the bread knife and cut the loaf.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Furze, wandering through the wet green tops of a field of
      mangels, saw from the Ridge her flag afloat. He had a gun
      over his shoulder, and as he paused to look at the little
      slanting pennon of smoke the wind made a hollow murmuring
      in the barrels of the gun. A wet sun splashed pale light
      upon the glossy leaves of the mangels. The Six Firs stood
      up straight and blue, and the smoke from the distant
      chimney was of the same blueness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another picnic," he thought with the cynicism of a wilful
      man, and ploughing on through the mangels, he fired at a
      bolting rabbit close to the hedge and saw its white scut
      roll over. The sound of the gun disturbed the heavy
      melancholy of the valley, and all that wet September
      greenness. The rabbit still twitched. Its pug was bloody,
      but Furze did not notice that blood. With the blade of a
      knife he slit one hind leg, slipped the other leg through
      the sinews, and slung the rabbit over his gun. The brown
      body dangled behind his back, and dripped blood upon his
      old coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was supper time. The dusk would fall swiftly, and it
      would be dark in an hour, and when darkness came Furze went
      to bed. Candles and oil cost money, and what had a lone man
      to sit up for? Books? But books cost money, even the hiring
      of them, and music had gone out of his life. He lived for
      the farm, and since the farm's purpose was the exchanging
      of produce for money, he thought a great deal about money.
      He was hard. He liked to think of himself as hard; he
      willed himself to be hard. His heart-wood was oak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hung the rabbit up in the dairy and pushed a crock with
      his foot to catch the drip of the blood. His gun he had
      hung up over the mantelpiece. Supper was a perfunctory
      meal; he ate to work. The kettle was singing on the hook,
      and he made tea. The larder offered him a hunk of mutton
      and some cold boiled potatoes, bread and cheese. He used no
      cloth. Plates and dishes were put down anyhow. He used the
      same knife for meat and bread and cheese. He would kick off
      his muddy boots, and leaving them lying anyhow, make moist
      patterns on the red tiles with his socked feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      That all the graciousness had gone out of his life was an
      accepted fact, and he acknowledged it tacitly, if he
      troubled to acknowledge it at all. He was not conscious of
      a pose, of a wilful and obstinate cult of his own savagery.
      If he brutalized himself he did it with a stubborn set of
      the shoulders. He would not let himself think or feel above
      the level of his byres, or beyond the limits of a root
      crop. He may have told himself that he did not want to
      feel; he had felt too much; it was an uncomfortable
      business. A farmer should be of the soil, or like a boot
      kicking a clod, or like hands that caught and threw a
      sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He supped; he lit a pipe; he added the dirty plates to a
      pile in the sink where they would await his pleasure and
      five minutes' dabbing with a dish cloth. He pushed his feet
      into a pair of old leather slippers that were down at the
      heels. Twilight was at hand; the house door stood open; he
      went and lounged against one of the door-posts, collarless,
      unshaven, smelling of the soil. His farm lay about him,
      with dusky trees and sharp-edged buildings, and fields
      growing dim under a September sky. He absorbed the feel of
      it, its greasy, fertile productivity, its beasts and roots
      and stacked grain, its muck heaps and fat pastures.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, she was back at Cinder Town! He had pitied Cinder Town,
      but now he despised it, as a man in the force of his years
      may despise the potterers, and the little dilettante
      people, poor devils like Coode. His hardness had a touch of
      arrogance. And how long would she stay in Cinder Town?
      Three days, three weeks, three months? A widow, and
      assuredly a widow with some money? Her tragedy had touched
      him not at all, for he had heard nothing of it but the bare
      details, and he did not suppose that a financier's widow
      came naked out of such a scramble. Obviously, she had
      brought no good luck to the second man; Cinderella had had
      to weep over the grave of her prince. But had she wept?
      Certainly, he had seen her weep, and those dusky and
      babyish eyes all dewy with deceiving tears. Some women weep
      easily. His wife had not been that sort of woman, but in
      these days he would not let himself think too much of his
      dead wife. A hard man should not look back over his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the memory of that June night, perhaps he was a
      little ashamed of it, and being ashamed of it, had tried to
      forget it. Mary had attempted no more adventures, even
      though she had been more free for them, but--then--when you
      are free--the adventure may lose its tang. He had added a
      dry cynicism to his hardness; his glances, when he looked
      at anything but beasts and crops, were apt to be ironical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She'll want milk,--I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      He allowed her the need--and with irony. Will's boy would
      deliver her her milk at half-past seven in the morning.
      Probably she would be in bed at that hour; she would have a
      servant, and the servant would take in the milk. He
      mocked--as men will--when they are too sure of themselves.
      Someone would always take in her milk for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew dark. He closed and locked the door, and taking a
      cheap red tin candlestick from the mantelpiece, he lit the
      candle. The saucer of the candlestick was half full of
      spent matches, and grease, and gutted candle-ends, but what
      did that matter if the farm was paying? And it was paying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze went upstairs to bed, put the candlestick on one
      chair, and threw his clothes anyhow on another. The bed
      creaked, but once in it he lay very still, and was asleep
      in twenty minutes.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Furze was coming up out of the yard when he met Will's
      boy--now a lanky lout--returning with the milk can.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call at 'Green Shutters'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry had called there; he had been told to call there. The
      lady who had been Miss Viner had herself taken the milk
      from him. He told Furze so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's got no girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze walked on, not deigning to ask Harry how he had
      assured himself of the absence of a girl, though Harry was
      now at an age when girls were assuming prominence. Harry
      called after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bout eggs? Says as she wants half a dozen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take them to-morrow with the milk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Says as she wants they to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. Take them in the dinner hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Furze met the lout coming back from Cinder Town.
      Something had amused Mr. Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I took they eggs. Beating a carpet she was."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze asked him what there was to grin about. Carpets and
      other things needed a stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hung t' carpet on the clothes line, and t' clothes line
      broke. Broke twice while I was watchin' of her. She got a
      sore hand, and couldn't tie a knot proper. Knot slipped
      each time. 'Why don't 'ee lay it on t' grass, missus?' says
      I."
    </p>
    <p>
      He grinned, and Furze's eyes were frosty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did she say to that, you fool?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nout. And t' line broke again as I got to t' gate. Fair
      made me split."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect it did," said his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was surprised, not at the Sussex peasant's idea of
      humour, but of this vision of Mary at work, her battling
      with the cussedness of inanimate things, knocking the dust
      out of a carpet. Surely, it was not a job for her delicate
      and fanciful hands? His thoughts might have touched a more
      sneering irreverence, but having met irreverence in the
      person of a wet-mouthed lout, he scowled at it, mis-liking
      the loutish caricature of himself. Useless and frivolous
      she might be, yet she was not for a lout's laughter. But
      why this carpet beating? Did it suggest playfulness, or
      necessity? Lastly, what business was it of his?
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent to his work. The stubble of the Sea Field was to be
      ploughed, and he took the horses up to the field. The
      wheel-plough lay on the land's end by the gate. The plough
      wheels needed setting, and the draught adjusting to a dead
      centre for marking out the headland. The knife coulter had
      to be fixed at an angle and a little above and behind the
      marking of the headlands, tilting the plough over to the
      left so that the land wheel ran on the ground. Then came
      the crown furrow, and the second furrow after a shifting of
      the draught. All this while his eyes were on the sticks,
      but with the lines of his land map laid out the work became
      more automatic. Travelling westwards he could look along
      the near horse's flank, and see Cinder Town lying beyond
      and to the right of the Six Firs. The little houses had the
      appearance of cardboard models, each set down in its patch
      of garden. Almost you could imagine a Sussex south-wester
      lifting them up and whirling them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he paused to rest and, leaving horses and plough
      upon the headland, went to the gate and leaned upon it, the
      toe of his right boot tucked between the rails. He could
      see "Simla," and Oak Lodge, and "Green Shutters," and
      Coode's steel hut with a tail tacked to it. One or two tiny
      figures showed. A man was wheeling manure up the path of
      Colonel Sykes' garden. A white sheet and something red
      floated behind Oak Lodge. Someone was working in the long
      green and brown strip behind "Green Shutters," between a
      row of peas and a hedge of runner beans. It was a woman's
      figure. It pushed a fork into the ground, and then bent
      down as though picking stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze read those movements. She was digging potatoes,
      throwing the haulms aside, and collecting the tubers into
      little groups. Even at a distance he knew the nice shape of
      her, her slimness, and again he was conscious of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Digging potatoes!
    </p>
    <p>
      And she was at it quite a long time, for whenever he
      glanced from his ploughing towards that little strip on the
      hillside below him he saw her figure bending to the fork
      and then stooping to collect the tubers. She was lifting
      the whole main crop, ten longish rows. The brown earth
      increased steadily but very slowly at the expense of the
      yellow and withering haulm.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts paused over her. What was the meaning of this
      labour?
    </p>

      October came, a beautiful month, tranquil and still, with
      wide, clear eyes and a robe that grew each day more tawny.
      The fruits of the earth had been gathered in, and the
      winter lay hidden in the soil. In the early hours frost was
      very near, and the breath of the cows steamed at milking
      time, and the dew on the grass had the look of rime. Leaves
      began to flutter down and to lie yellow upon the orchard
      grass, where the windfallen apples rotted or were mere
      shells picked hollow by the blackbirds. Furze had no time
      to gather windfalls, nor was it worth his while to pay for
      the picking. He gathered what he could, or put two of
      Will's small daughters to the trees, with a few pence and a
      basket or two of fruit to satisfy children and mother. Most
      of his apples went to Cinder Town and some of them to
      "Green Shutters," where old Hesketh's young trees did no
      more than fill a good sized tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two weeks of September had passed, and ten days of October,
      and between "Doomsday" and "Green Shutters" silence held.
      Then days ran side by side, each day much like every other
      day, separate, with an aloofness that might seem final. To
      Furze it had every appearance of finality. He did not
      bother. He assumed that it made no difference to him her
      being there, nor could the manner of her being there soften
      his hardness. It did not alter his manner of living; he
      slogged about in dirty boots; he shaved when he pleased,
      wore no collar, piled unwashed crockery into the sink, let
      cobwebs and dust accumulate. Good muck and money were the
      things that mattered. He lived now on the assurance that he
      would allow nothing else to matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, signals were flying between them. When Mary lit a fire
      under the copper, and dabbled her hands in a tub, and hung
      out her sheets and towels and linen to dry, they were there
      for him to see. White flags, yet not flags of surrender.
      Furze might hoist no signal in reply, or keep a storm-cone
      flying, yet there was an inner eye in him that saw, though
      he might pretend to an obstinate blindness. Always there is
      duality, the yea and the nay, the positive and negative,
      the little dark slit of a man's wilful consciousness, and
      the broad spaces of nature. That a man should look at the
      world between two slats of a fence may seem a monstrous
      foolishness, though he may not wish to see more than he
      wishes to see, and be a little proud of his narrowness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breaking of a silence required courage. It demanded an
      attack. Mary was more afraid of it than she knew, and yet
      like Godiva she stripped herself of her fear, and went out
      to shame man's hardness. Had he not taunted her with
      shirking the realities? She chose the broad daylight, and
      the full moon. She did not dress for the part. In her
      working clothes, an oldish skirt and a black and white
      jumper, hatless, without looking into her mirror, she left
      Cinder Town and ascended to the farm. You may strip
      yourself of fear, and yet be mightily afraid. At the end of
      the lane by the field gate of the Gore she faltered and
      fell into a trembling. What was she doing? Riding naked
      through Coventry? With any Peeping Tom to gloat over her
      nakedness! And how would the lord of the soil take it, as
      the challenge of a cheap wench, as an invitation? Her
      eyelids flickered,--as a woman's eyelids will when she
      knows herself gazed at too boldly,--but she went on. She
      held to a courage that was greater than his hardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked up the path, terrified and heroic. The door was
      ajar; she knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo--!" said a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pushed open the door and went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was eating his dinner, and such a dinner. He was
      coatless, collarless, wearing an unbuttoned waistcoat over
      a grey shirt. His muddy boots were thrust under the table.
      He sat and stared at her, with half a cold potato on a
      poised fork. She noticed details with a woman's swiftness:
      the loaf on the bare table, the crumbs, a slab of cold
      boiled bacon, a pot of jam with a spoon stuck in it, a cup
      of tea, sugar in a saucer. A sordid meal being eaten
      sordidly! His coat had been flung on the sofa. She saw mud
      and pieces of straw on the tiled floor. And yet--most
      strangely--she was not repelled by what she saw; it stirred
      in her a quick compassion; instead of squalor, or the
      incipient brutishness of the careless male, she touched
      pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was to save her. But would it save him?
    </p>
    <p>
      She made the first move. He seemed to sit there rather like
      a surprised animal in a pen, sullen, resenting a strange
      presence, puzzled by it. She looked at him steadily, made
      herself look. She stood by the sofa and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word as yet. Then, he was up, as though pricked by a
      something in her presence. He removed the coat from the
      sofa and placed it on a chair. She sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained standing midway between the sofa and the table.
      He looked at her under considering eyebrows. He did not
      appear embarrassed. Then, he sat down again at the table,
      but he sat square to it, with his feet drawn up, no longer
      sprawling in conscious solitude. His face was hard,
      ironical, attentive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You used to do my father a favour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze cut himself more bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You let him have two loads of manure for the garden. I
      shall want it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He met her glance, full eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, cow. Some of my soil is rather sandy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Deliberately he spread jam on the bread, using the jam
      spoon, and she wanted to say to him--"O, don't do
      that,--you--a public school man,--you--who could play
      Chopin--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two loads. All right. Want it soon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The end of the month will do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two loads of cow-dung dropped outside the "Green Shutters"
      gate! Reality of realities! He might have left the matter
      there, but he did not leave it as a mere pile of crude
      muck. Hard he might be, but his hardness had a certain
      polish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is going to shift it for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do things myself--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't do that," he said bluntly; "I'll send Will
      along. He'll barrow it and stack it for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you. But that will be extra. What shall I owe you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was curt to the point of roughness. He had begun to be
      embarrassed; he finished his meal in a hurry, and stood up
      and looked at the fire. He tossed a couple of logs on to
      the pile of charred wood and ash and crushed one of them
      down with a muddy boot. What was the game? He suspected
      symbolism behind this appearance of reality. Two loads of
      cow-manure! Monstrous realism! Why hadn't they burst out
      laughing? But she was serious,--different. She sat on his
      sofa without a flicker of an eyelid, strangely and
      mysteriously still, with her dark eyes terrified but
      steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things have rather changed for you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood with one hand on the high mantelshelf, and still
      prodded at the log with a boot heel. She made no answer,
      and glancing round at her he found her eyes fixed on the
      table. She gave a little flinching smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It means so much work--" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One's sense of--what shall we call i<strike>t</strike>?
      Trying to keep a few flowers in the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      He too glanced at the table, and his face darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bit of a piggery, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he added with a touch of truculence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like it like that. What does it matter? When muck makes
      money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      If she shuddered she concealed the tremor. She stood up. He
      had succeeded in shocking her, but she was not to be driven
      from her tower of compassion. Let him but try to pull her
      down, and she would struggle a step higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't believe that--really."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pausing in the doorway, half in the sunlight and half in
      the shadow, she looked back at him with a slow smile. She
      spoke very gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you believed it I should know that the fault was
      mine--as well as yours. You used to think me a coward--I am
      a coward--I'm frightened to death of you and this old
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained by the fireplace, staring down at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then--why come? It's not a playful house, my dear, but a
      dirty one, a grim one--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My fault--again."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked round at her sharply over a stubborn shoulder.
      His eyes were searching and suspicious. He did not put the
      inevitable question into words, but his eyes and his
      grudging severity put it as plainly as could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--you wonder--It's understandable, Arnold--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She touched a dark knot in the oak door-post as though
      testing his hardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life can be hard. Maybe it is meant to be hard for nine
      people out of ten. I had three years of softness. Now, I
      have 'Green Shutters,' and about a hundred and twenty
      pounds a year. Just that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a movement of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not minded to bend, and he missed the look she gave
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall I owe you for those two loads?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten shillings a load."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I shall be in your debt for Will's time. I'll pay
      it--perhaps--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She managed to laugh, and laughing--left him, but he stood
      up straight and watched her go down the brick path to the
      gate at the end of the yew hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humbug," he said to himself, but his oak had a "shake" in
      it.

    <p>
      When she had gone, Furze took a tin of tobacco from the
      black mantelshelf and filled a pipe. His fingers were
      deliberate and sullen. He kept glancing at the table and
      about the room with a suggestion of caution, as though he
      was afraid to look at it, and was not so proud of its
      ugliness as he wished to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he had to allow that the place was a piggery. And then
      something savage glowed in him. Damn her, what did she mean
      by coming to spy and to criticize, and to bring her
      delicacy and her little nice squeamishness into his house?
      Cow manure--indeed! Two loads of it! He struck a match, and
      threw back his head as though to laugh,--but no sound came.
      Primroses, bluebells, hay,--and now--cow manure! Women were
      ingenious cattle! What was she after? Sex, him, a home? But
      she had a home. Yet what was the ulterior motive? Was she
      pretending to be sorry? There was no need for her to be
      sorry for him. If she had any quarrel with his hardness and
      with the way he lived, let her remember that she had
      shirked reality three years ago. Cowardice. And she was
      afraid of him and his house, was she! Then--why the
      devil--?
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt evil and he looked it. For months he had been
      giving way gradually to the brutishness that is in every
      man, turning his thoughts to "muck and money" where a
      weaker man might have turned to sottishness. That he was
      growing miserly, a sloven, and rough in voice and mood he
      knew very well, and he had gloated over it half defiantly,
      but when his boorishness was challenged he was ready to fly
      into a rage. Aptly he might have described it as a slip of
      a girl laying a stick about a bull's nose. Like an angry
      man he exaggerated things, even emphasized his own
      prejudices, and made a mock of anything that could be
      described as moral moonlight. Like the farmer asked to
      admire a grove of foxgloves, he could give a quizzical and
      sneering look at both the æsthetician and the flowers.
      "Them things! What we can't make money out of don't matter.
      Can't say as I have much of an eye for flowers." He
      remembered, too, that she had described her efforts towards
      delicacy as an attempt to keep a few flowers in the house.
      That was the woman's idea, was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman's idea! Flowers! And at that very moment a memory
      caught his gloomy scoffings by the throat and choked them.
      "Be silent. Beautiful things are done by human hands. How
      dare you scoff,--you man. Was not love yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood as though sullenly listening to a reproachful
      voice, and unwilling to admit a twinge of shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm hard. That's all dead and done with."
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved uneasily about the room. He opened the door of
      Mrs. Damaris' parlour, and stood vaguely aware of
      innumerable memories, human murmurings. His head drooped
      like a tired and sullen beast's. And suddenly he saw
      himself in the old long mirror opposite the fireplace. He
      stared. Something very like surprise, a shocked surprise
      showed in his eyes. He saw an untidy, slouching,
      gloomy-looking man, standing round-shouldered, biting a
      pipe stem, hands thrust into trousers pockets. The image of
      himself looked at his self inimically. The face was cruel.
      It gloomed at him, hard mouthed and dirty chinned above an
      unbuttoned waistcoat and slovenly grey shirt. It was a face
      that suggested ill-temper, sordid thoughts, unlovely
      tendencies. It had no brightness, no quick light in the
      eyes, no human tremblings about the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good God, was his mouth like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of feeling shocked. He took his pipe from his
      mouth and, approaching the mirror, looked at himself more
      closely and with curiosity. He had little lines on his
      face, puckers between the eyebrows, and the eyes stared
      fiercely. His hair needed cutting; it was all rats'-tails,
      and straggling over his cheek bones, giving him a shaggy
      and ominous look. Primitive man! He ceased to be surprised
      at her fear of him, and he began to be a little afraid of
      himself as he considered the reflection in the mirror, and
      wondered why he had not seen himself becoming what he had
      become.
    </p>
    <p>
      He surrendered a point. He went upstairs and shaved, and
      felt the better for it, and stood fingering his chin and
      looking in the shaving-glass. Yes, those eyes and that
      mouth were hard. Could the hardness be helped? But in the
      future he would be clean, hard but clean. If he did not owe
      that to the live woman, he owed it to the dead one.

    </p>
    <p>
      Mary had paused by the field gate of the Gore. She leaned
      against the gate, remembering that June night, and the full
      moon, and her tears. Below her the oaks of Gore Wood showed
      domes of greenness flecked with gold. The old thorn hedges
      on either side of the gate were full of yellow corn and red
      berries. A yaffle flew laughing overhead and went winging
      towards the oak trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bird's laughing note was like a passing salutation. He
      went from wood to wood, through sunlight and shadow, gay in
      his green coat, uttering that humorous and exultant cry. O,
      laughter! Had Furze forgotten how to laugh? Could he but
      look at his own gloomy face, and realize the humorous
      futility of his gloom,--and then burst out laughing! O,
      blessed laughter! She wanted to laugh at her own fear, for
      she was afraid, all trembling between repugnance and pity.
      She clung to her pity, for somehow she knew that if she did
      not cling to it with passion, and refuse to let it go, fear
      would overcome her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt responsible for everything, for that almost filthy
      room, his hard slovenliness, that look of mockery and
      suspicion in his eyes. If "Doomsday" had frightened her in
      the old days, it was far more terrible to her now, and yet
      terror can attract. She was in the thick of the wood of
      reality, fighting her way to the light, and calling to him
      to come with her. "Oh, Arnold, my man." She knew now what
      love was, laughter and tears and terror, and a pity that
      clung with wild hands and would not be thrust off. She had
      to face love now, a gloomy love growing brutish in that
      beautiful but grim old house, and though she trembled so
      that the gate shook, she saw her life before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      These woods and fields, those rambling rooms and crooked
      stairs, and great dark dairy! The apple trees brushing at
      the windows, the wind in the chimneys on the long winter
      nights! Lamps to be filled and trimmed! Muddy boots. A wet
      lane leading to a village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martyrdom?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she cried out against self-pity. This was life, the
      life of Adam; and Eve had to share it. She clung to the
      gate with both hands, and her face had a white radiance.
      She had not given; she had to learn to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      For in a flash she saw him as a man starving in the midst
      of plenty with the fruits of the earth at his feet, and
      beauty before his eyes. The soul of him was going blind,
      and like a blind man he did not see the stains, the
      blemishes, the tragic squalor of his surroundings. He had
      forgotten how to smile and to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stretched out her hands to the oaks of Gore Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, dead woman, give me courage."
    </p>

    <p>
      She cooked, she scrubbed, she cleaned, and washed and
      polished, and made her bed, and worked her garden, and for
      the first month she went to her room so weary that she felt
      too tired to do her hair. But she made herself sit down at
      the dressing-table, and satisfy her self's pride and her
      mirror. She was soft and out of practice. She was full of
      aches; her hands were blistered and survived them; she
      knocked her knuckles and managed to laugh. She laughed at
      her softness. She made wilful fun of the exquisite Mrs.
      Percival Fream, that soft and perfumed creature in her rosy
      marble bath. The Mrs. Freams of the world had their uses;
      they flowered, they developed the beauty and the charm of
      an elegant leisure, but a social mannequin was not much use
      to a working partner. She had set herself to be a working
      woman, to clasp repetition to her bosom, and to transmute
      it into service.
    </p>
    <p>
      As her young muscles grew firm she found herself less tired
      at night. She slept serenely. She saw very little of her
      neighbours, for she was seeing so much of her new self. She
      was able to quiz the future Mary. She supposed that some
      day she might see herself as a round-backed, slack-bosomed
      creature with a rather scraggy neck, and hair growing thin,
      and a complexion that had lost its bloom. A working woman,
      rather worn and anxious and grey, and perennially tired?
      Was that the inevitable prospect? If so, was it any uglier
      than the prospect of becoming a young old girl, mutton
      dressed as lamb, clutching at every artifice, living in
      fear of the day when men would cease to look? Did men never
      look at a woman in any other way? Was there not the
      comrade's look? "Dear heart,--a wrinkle or two! My wrinkles
      as well as yours. Scars of honour, beloved pledges." A man
      might glance at the baby faces, but he would look at the
      sacred face of his mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      She endured, and in enduring found a strange tranquillity
      and a patient strength. She did not think too much. Having
      taken to-morrow in her hand and scanned it mercilessly, she
      put it away in the drawer of to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week after the tragi-comedy of her quest of two loads
      of cow-manure Mary saw and heard nothing of Furze. She had
      planted her seed and she waited. She was becoming a little
      wise as to life and its growth; she had done with
      childishness and the digging up of her seed to see if it
      was showing plumule and radicle. She had come away from
      "Doomsday" knowing that he had not liked her visit, or its
      suddenness, or its laying bare of his so-called hardness,
      and she knew that there was significance in his
      displeasure. Having let pity loose, she had become far more
      sensitive--and therefore more foreseeing. Either he would
      quarrel with the brute in himself or he would not. She
      would help him to quarrel with it, and stand by him
      terrified and trembling, but devoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her garden a few roots of hardy chrysanthemums occupied
      an odd corner by the tool-shed, and she kept an old china
      vase of the flowers upon her table. She had changed the
      withered flowers for fresh ones on the very afternoon that
      a grey horse drawing a blue cart appeared outside her gate.
      A garden fork, standing erect on the top of the load,
      suggested a mystic symbol.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come himself instead of sending Will. She saw him
      through the window, backing the cart towards the fence. The
      load was shot out, and the cart righted, and the grey horse
      tethered to the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope Will is not laid up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Can I borrow your barrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His face had a more alert look, and a sleek and polished
      chin. She noticed instantly that he had lost that sullen
      expression. Hard he might be, but with a lean and Roman
      hardness; the shaggy ape-man had had his hair cut and had
      put on a collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is in the tool-shed. I'll get it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right,--I will. Is there a piece of spare ground where
      I can pile the stuff?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you come and look."
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were returning down the path, Furze trundling the
      barrow, she asked him how long he would be. Or was he going
      back for the second load? No; he would bring the second
      load to-morrow. He was carting the stuff early while the
      weather remained dry, for you might expect it to break
      about the third week in October.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have tea ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not look at her,--but reached for the fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you.--But after a job like this--you know--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is part of the day's work. Tea is my share. You can
      wash in the kitchen."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll put out a pair of poor old father's slippers. The
      horse will be all right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face and his voice told her nothing. She had an
      impression of him as a man who neither avoided nor welcomed
      the occasion; but whatever his inward attitude might be she
      knew that she had gained ground. She left him to the work
      and went in to get tea ready and to place that pair of
      slippers for him at the back door. She felt curiously
      unexcited, but rather tense and strung up and on the alert,
      just as she had felt in the early days of Weyfleet before
      one of her social occasions. She put out her prettiest
      cups, and was glad of the fresh flowers. Since her return
      to Cinder Town she had rearranged the little sitting-room;
      some of the old Victorian furniture had been sold or
      exchanged; she had put up new taffeta curtains of powder
      blue, and spread a few pleasantly coloured old rugs over
      the carpet. The table was a Sussex gate-leg. The sheaf of
      bronze and rose and white chrysanthemums looked well on it
      in their massive grey jar.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a can of hot water ready and a clean towel, and
      when she heard him at the back door, she put the can in the
      hand-basin in the sink, with the towel on top of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is some water for you, Arnold."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unlacing his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm making the tea now. You will find me in the
      sitting-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she seen the way he looked at the clean towel and the
      can of water she would have been able to smile. He took off
      his coat, hung the towel very carefully on a hook, and
      proceeded to wash. His finger-nails did not please him, and
      when the yellow soap and the towel had done their best in
      the absence of a nail-brush he found a match end, sharpened
      it with a kitchen knife and used the improvised orange
      stick. He was taking longer than she had expected; the
      splashings had ceased, and the tea was getting stewed. She
      went softly to the door and, being able to see along the
      passage and into the kitchen, she discovered him solemnly
      busy upon his finger-nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took her secret triumph back with her to the tea-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ready,--Arnold?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      He arrived, looking very serious and just a little
      self-conscious. She saw him glance at the flowers, and the
      tea-cups, the thin white bread and butter and the cake. She
      used no cloth on the polished surface of the old oak table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit there--won't you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat. She divined his awareness of the room, its feminine
      atmosphere, its simple and delicate flavour. He kept
      looking at the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope the tea won't be too strong for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like it strong."
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the meal she was reminded of a big, shy,
      grave-eyed boy. He looked at her cautiously. He talked
      rather formally about old Hesketh and the garden, and ate
      two slices of plum cake. Obviously he liked the cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jolly good cake this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad you like it. It's my third attempt. The first had to
      go into the dustbin; the second--was better.--I ate it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She challenged him to smile. He did smile, though it came
      very slowly. He appeared to meditate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You used to make cakes in the old days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was out of practice. A cook has to have hands. Another
      cup?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have had two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not three? Such little cups."
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather pretty cups."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't they. I picked them up in the antique shop at
      Carslake. A bargain. Won't you light your pipe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved a little uneasily, and seemed to question the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, not here,--thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father used to."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he would not light a pipe, and his obduracy pleased
      her. Also he was replenished, physically and spiritually,
      and he seemed to desire to carry his impressions away with
      him. There was work at "Doomsday." O, yes, she knew that
      very well. She too had work to do. She was taking a few of
      the chrysanthemums up to the grave, but she did not tell
      him so. As he went out of the room she was aware of him
      giving a quick glance at the flowers and the blue window
      curtains and the reddening sky. He was putting on his heavy
      boots when she carried the tea tray into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The other load to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt for his pouch and pipe, and stood there, filling
      the pipe. He looked deliberate,--thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is going to dig that stuff in for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,--I shall."
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck a match, lit his pipe, and put the spent match
      back in the match box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a job for a woman. I'll lend you Will for half a
      day,--later on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll pay you for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But two teas will not be a fair exchange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught her smile, and was a long time making up his mind
      about answering it. Smiling came hard to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is plenty of cake left," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      His deep eyes stared at her for a moment. He took his pipe
      out of his mouth and raised his old hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone she folded up the towel he had used, and
      with a queer tremor of light in her eyes, put it carefully
      aside in a drawer, for it was her first captured flag, a
      trophy.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He came with the second load on the following afternoon,
      and the interplay repeated itself, but with a difference.
      He was less shy, but more grave, and he talked, and his
      talk was of the life on the soil. She felt that there was a
      purpose behind his words; he was warning her; three years
      ago she had humiliated his pride in his job, and now he
      talked to justify his pride in it, though there was no need
      for him to justify it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that in these days the world seemed shy of the
      soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--after all--we carry the whole crowd on our shoulders.
      When the revelation comes--if it does come--the last word
      will be with us. We shall stand over our crops with our
      guns, and even the Reds will have to cringe to us as they
      had to cringe to the peasants in Russia."
    </p>
    <p>
      She cut him more cake; he needed more sweet things in his
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--the peasant is back of everything," she agreed, "the
      man with the hoe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or the tractor and the cultivator. But the mere machine
      man won't do on a farm, Mary. A farm is alive, and live
      things are exacting. That's why the life's so hard. Weeds
      to fight, and sick beasts to care for, and lambs being
      born. There is something in me that loves and fights,
      perhaps a bit too fiercely. I have no use for your city
      crowds and your cinema people. The soil's king--though he
      may be in exile just now, but he'll come back when the
      English city rotter has loafed the country into
      bankruptcy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, he smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say,--this cake's good."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little cake is good--for beasts and men, Arnold. Not too
      much--you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered a while, with his head down, and then looked at
      her keenly for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was wrong three years ago. I'm a bit of a fanatic about
      the farm. I realize now--that it wasn't fair to
      ask--a--cultured woman to come and live that life. It
      wasn't reasonable. Work--day in--day out, and not much
      money; a good deal of loneliness, and few of the things
      people want these days."
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do they want them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because we are supposed to be better educated, more
      civilized--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More restless.--Not facing your realities, Arnold. No
      coats off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I think. A gloomy, old-fashioned Hodge, my
      dear. But Hodge does think. He is not quite an antediluvian
      fool, and he is getting less so. Pushing a hoe in a
      fourteen-acre field isn't thrilling. Driving a tractor in a
      hundred-acre one--may be about as monotonous and lonely.
      But someone has to do it. The monkey-man will find that
      out--some day. It may be a bit of a grim jest--I'm
      thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered him very gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why--grim? I have seen the pathos of things. I have been
      ignorant; I have been hurt. Your poor little
      monkey-men--aren't they pathetic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll think them pathetic when they begin to look it," he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was as far as she could move him. He stood up suddenly
      as though he had delivered his message, and filled his
      pipe, though he did not light it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's a hard life. It's not for everybody. But to
      me--it's a good life, Mary.--It might make one a bit of a
      brute--unless--Well,--I'll send Will up some
      afternoon.--Anything I can do--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed him to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I?" she wanted to say, but left it unsaid on that
      particular day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused by the corner of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose you wouldn't care--to have a look round--ever--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When may I come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He frowned at his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next week? Say Wednesday. Bring a friend--if you want to.
      The bracken is rather fine. If it won't bore you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at his obstinate eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It doesn't bore you--because you love it," she said. "If
      one loves something very much--one need not be bored."
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      While leading the grey horse home, Furze's consciousness
      was held by those last words of hers. They were true, but
      only relatively true, for the modern mind has arrived at
      the blessed half-way house of relativity. The absolute is
      out of fashion. Furze, having run the blue cart into the
      wagon-shed, and stabled the grey horse, washed his hands at
      the pump, and went to the cow-house to help Will finish the
      milking. With his head pressing against a warm flank, he
      let his thoughts travel back and forth, until they returned
      to share his cautious incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, such a future seemed impossible. Mary might stand the
      life for six months, but sooner or later she would weary of
      it and its drudgery. Her heart was not in it. Mere
      sentiment is poor cloth for a farmer's breeches. Moreover,
      had not his thinking got ahead of his caring? Did he care?
      Or was it that he was afraid to care, and, like the hard
      and cautious husbandman,--considered a woman's points as he
      considered a cow's? It was necessary. Only a fool would try
      to make a lady's hack pull a plough.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of the two selves in him, the farmer-self might plant
      his feet in the gateway of life and square his shoulders,
      while the lover-self went wandering in quest of the heart
      of healing. Did the soil grow nothing but turnips? Furze
      found himself lost that evening in a sudden world of
      beauty, not beauty as a boy sees it, but as a grown man
      sees it when he has known ugliness and pain. He wandered
      among the beeches of Beech Ho, dripping with yellow light
      and autumn splendours, and still clasping leafy mystery. He
      looked at his fields and his house lying under the edge of
      the sunset, and suddenly the hardness fell from him like a
      buckram coat. He was conscious of humility, wonder. Muck
      and money! Had this soil of his nothing finer to offer him?
      Surely, he had been going blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming down the hillside he had a strange feeling as of
      walking naked, his body stripped of its clothes, and his
      skin tingling to the rays of a strong sun. The sensation
      was physical,--but imaged from within. You cast off your
      sorry garments, and let something blaze into you, a gentle
      radiance that warmed and made alive, and eased your
      thoughts and your feelings. That was it,--you felt;
      something thawed in you; the stiffness went out of the
      joints of your soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mood? No, it was more than a mood, for a mood is a mere
      pool of rain-water that soaks away and evaporates, and this
      feeling flowed. He knew--as a man knows at such a moment in
      his life--that the supreme wisdom lies with you in the flux
      of an inspired impulse. He let it carry him along. He found
      himself in Mrs. Damaris' parlour, touching the notes of the
      piano. It needed tuning, even as he did. It needed hands to
      play upon it with human tenderness, drawing from it all
      those subtle modulations, the movements of pathos or of
      gaiety, or the touch that provoked tears. He had suffered
      its wires--and his--to rust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, he wandered out again into the dusk and along
      the lane, and a little way down the Melhurst road. It was
      very still; dew was falling; the trees and hedges wrapped
      themselves in dimness. He was close to Will's cottage, and
      did not know it, for he was not very conscious of the outer
      world. But passing the big elder tree in Will's hedge, he
      heard the sudden voice of a scolding, screaming woman. It
      tore a cheap and vulgar rage to tatters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze turned back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Will!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But that little, scolding scrag of a common woman had her
      uses. The evil in her served Furze. Almost he had heard a
      voice that might have been the comrade voice of his "muck
      and money" self. He was conscious of disgust, of a deep
      revulsion of feeling, of a reaching out towards humility.
      He was discovering for himself a truth that is as old as
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman should be gentle; she should have a soft voice and
      kind eyes. It was this gentleness that a man asked for,
      finding in it the honey for the cup of his maleness; and
      Furze, deep under the shadows of the Six Firs, saw the
      light of a woman's gentleness burning like a lamp in his
      man's darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he thought--"How years pass and the pain of them before
      we see things clearly! Is the gentle woman out of fashion,
      or do we find the gentleness when we set out to seek it?
      The sweetness that saves us from growing sour in our fields
      and our workshops! O, gentle hands and gentle voice, and
      eyes that suffer our tired grumblings, and our comings in
      out of the rain and the mud. Gentleness wins a woman
      everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was made to smile. He went slowly down the lane to his
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--what do I know of woman--the modern girl? But is not
      woman always the same when you kneel down and put your head
      in her lap? The war of the sexes! There is no war when a
      woman is gentle, and man not wholly a beast. A man comes
      back to his woman's knees."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      A man wakes when he wishes to wake, and Furze woke very
      early. Also there are different ways of beginning the day,
      with haste, and a pulling on of any old clothes--mental and
      otherwise, or calmly and consideringly and with the
      freshness of the dawn in your nostrils. Furze stood at his
      open window, and the dawn looked at him like the gentle
      brown eyes of a dog. "What of the day, my Master?" Verily
      the day was good. The haste had gone from his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning his arms on the sill with his shoulders touching
      the oak mullions, he saw the valley full of white mist, and
      the woods on the hillside more grey than green. A couple of
      cows were pulling at the wet grass on the other side of the
      wall of the sunk garden. A robin twittered. An old pear
      tree stood up, a pyre of soft flame against the grey blue
      distance. Rushy Pool looked like a sheet of quicksilver.
      Nothing could have been more gentle than this daybreak, or
      the stealthy way in which the sun pushed feelers of light
      along the valley and touched the sleeping heads of the oaks
      in Gore Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Furze that the gentleness of the dawn was like
      the gentleness a woman might bring into a man's life, a
      serenity, the tempering of man's essential fierceness. With
      him lay the heat of the day, the sweat of accomplishment,
      but dawn and evening were the woman's. She was the grey of
      the dawn, and the cool greenness of twilight. She gave what
      man lacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what would he give?
    </p>
    <p>
      He gathered that for the moment he had no right to give her
      anything but silence. The right of choice was hers. He
      could but wait in silence, though suffering her to see that
      the silence had eyes of understanding. But there were
      things that could be done, and he would set about doing
      them. Her presence should penetrate and possess the
      inwardness and the outwardness of life. He could show her
      that the brute in him was clean and chastened.
    </p>
    <p>
      A burnt offering! And sudden laughter came to him as he lit
      the fire for that queerest of sacrifices. His old clothes,
      sodden with sweat, and the slime of evil humours!
    </p>
    <p>
      He collected them; breeches, socks, shirts, a filthy old
      coat, several frayed collars. He stuffed them on the fire
      blazing under the big chimney, using the poker as a fork.
      The black cat, couched on a dirty mat, looked at him
      dubiously, and then--misliking the smell of his burnt
      offering, arose, and with a look of yellow-eyed disdain,
      leaped up and out through the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good for you, old lady. May all black moods go out of the
      window after you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up the mat upon which Tibby had been sleeping and
      added it to the conflagration.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the beginning and a very practical beginning. He
      set the doors and windows open wide, piled most of the
      furniture on or about the table, and after moving his
      working bench into the yard, turned bucket and broom loose
      upon the tiled floor. He sluiced and swept it like a stable
      floor, pushing the spent water out through the porch door
      and down the steps along the path. Later in the day there
      came to him a realization of the old house's dignity, or
      rather--a rediscovery of it, even as he was remembering his
      own dignity. Coming up across the paddock, he paused to
      look at the great and general spread of "Doomsday's" roof,
      with the autumnal orchard on one side of it, and the spires
      of the larches for a background, and he realized the
      indescribable dim beauty of the old place. He tried to
      analyse this beauty, and failed. It was like the elusive
      beauty of a face. All that he could say was that some man
      had builded well, and that some other man had planted
      trees, and that the sun and the rain had played upon the
      bricks and the tiles and the stonework. On this autumn
      morning, too, the house had a gentleness, a veiled
      beneficence. It looked at him with a wise kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he thought--"It is possible to sin against the spirit
      of a house. Houses have seen and heard. They can enter into
      us as we enter into them."
    </p>
    <p>
      He re-entered it with a renewed sense of dignity. He stood
      bare-headed, thoughtful and reverent, conscious of an
      inward cleansing, moved by a stir of memories. Surely, a
      house could be sacred? The old Romans were right with the
      cult of their household gods. The roof-tree, the home, the
      hearth, solid things, realities in a world of restless and
      vain imaginings, something to come back to and to shelter
      in. For a house can be full of sweet scents, homely
      perfumes, savours of herbs and fruit, and the smell of
      flowers and of fermenting juices, and the fragrance of the
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered over it, up the stairs and about the rooms, as
      he had wandered in the old days. He felt humbled, happy,
      conscious of the human essence of things of love and pity,
      of an invisible presence, of ghosts sad and gentle. He knew
      now that he had sinned against that against which it is
      fatal to sin, his self, other selves, beauty, the eternal
      mystery of life, those strange yearnings towards something
      divined but unseen.

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He met her in the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her appreciation of the change in him was instant and
      vivid. An inward ease had come to him; it showed in his
      face and movements, and could be detected in his voice. He
      spoke more slowly, as though the words flowed from a deep
      spring, and were not jerked half resentfully to the
      surface. His eyes met hers with a shy but steady kindness,
      and if there was love in them, it was attentive and silent
      but sure. He looked larger, as though the twists and
      contracted ruggednesses of him had been all smoothed out.
      Serious he might be, but with a seriousness that could
      break into a little, tolerant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is good down yonder."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gazing through a gap in the hedge at the oaks of
      Gore Wood, and she stood and gazed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do some oaks turn gold and others bronze, and others
      stay quite green?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't tell you.--Like us--they have differences--I
      suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had placed herself beside him as though she belonged
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Differences are good. Don't you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Contrasts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--surely. The discovery came to me the other day. It was
      about time that I discovered it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming to the gate of the Gore it was her turn to pause,
      and to stand at gaze, with her elbows on the rail, and her
      two hands folded over her throat. She had wept upon this
      gate. She had passed through it into her first great
      emotional experience, and had felt as a woman feels when
      reality touches her. Insight comes with a flash. While
      leaning upon the field gate she had had her first glimpse
      of the essential sadness of life, and now on this October
      day she faced the inevitable repetitions, the tasks that
      man and his civilization have laid upon woman. She was
      sorry for herself, but sorry with a kind of gladness. She
      had touched compassion, and knew that one must pity to be
      pitied. She thought that what a woman asks for is to be
      wanted, and she knew that if he wanted her she would go to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it make you sad to see the leaves fall?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned with her on the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. They have to fall."
    </p>
    <p>
      She considered his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, perhaps that's it. When you realize that certain
      things have to be--No escape."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking at her intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sad words, Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--not so sad as I used to think."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a quick glance, rallying herself in answering
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't have a meal without washing a plate. That's so
      obvious. One tries to escape the obvious, but in the
      end--you surrender. But then--so much may depend--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the how and the why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so. But can you understand, Arnold, that a
      woman's gorge may rise at a bowl of greasy water? In order
      to be just decently clean one has to do such a number of
      things. And refinements? Flowers, prettinesses, daintiness,
      they grow out of the sweat of a woman's soul. We have
      always to be brushing, washing, mending, dusting. These are
      the woman's realities, the man's woman.--Aren't there any
      things you hate doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lots."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, messing about.--Well, never mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I know. You hate doing the things that women do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," he said, and was gently and guiltily silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She trembled a little within herself. Inevitable drudgery,
      and yet with it the inevitable pride! She was groping
      towards self-fulfilment, even in the conscious struggle of
      her youth with the problem of pots and pans. It seemed that
      you had to go down on your knees and wash life's feet as a
      king used to wash the feet of a beggar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Arnold," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His shoulders moved, but the movement died away, and he
      remained apart from her, rigid as the bars of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit of it. I chose this life.--It is a hard life. It
      may be a devil of a business trying to keep yourself
      clean--as well as to make a living. There has to be effort
      of some sort; even a parasite sucks. The farmer carries the
      curse of Adam,--if it is a curse--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Eve too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One has to live--Funny it should be such a desperately
      poor business--growing other people's food. Seems to me,
      Mary, that a man has the best of it, I'm sorry--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, a man gets out in the air and uses his muscles. He is
      slogging, and building and contriving. The woman has to
      stick indoors so much. I don't wonder that women rebel. I
      don't blame them."
    </p>
    <p>
      She touched his sleeve with the point of a finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But imagine an admirable machine in the house, Arnold,
      doing all the dull jobs perfectly. Would you like it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled deeply to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. How could a man? And even I? Even in my little box of
      a place? When you have got everything nice and orderly, and
      you can sit down in a comfy chair, and toast your
      toes.--Watching a machine wouldn't give you that feeling of
      satisfied tiredness--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not."
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to her that he purposely broke away from the too
      intimate challenge. He glanced at his wrist-watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I left the kettle on. We had better be moving."

      The change in "Doomsday" was as apparent as the change in
      its master. The frowsiness had gone from it. One glance at
      the tiled floor of the living-room made Mary remember the
      qualms it had raised in her with its grease-spots and the
      debris of food and match-ends and shreds of tobacco
      scattered about. All this was changed. The brass
      candlesticks, the canisters, the tobacco tins and pipes on
      the shelf above the fireplace showed the new order. The
      workbench had gone. The room was almost meticulously neat,
      and she--who knew how much self-discipline so nice an
      orderliness implied, was instantly touched by it. The
      room's neatness was masculine, ascetic, rigid; woman's
      neatness is different; it suggests sentiment, colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Furze had forgotten to wind the clock. One of these
      cheap, old-fashioned clocks, with a painted glass door, it
      stood on the high mantelshelf, showing a view of a very
      white windmill on a very green hill. To forget to wind a
      clock is human.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not boiling yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stirred the fire, and standing back for the kettle to
      begin its humming, he noticed the silent clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One seems bound to forget something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The housewife's motto--'Do it now.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the glass face and felt for the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all ready in there. Won't you go in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She left him winding the clock, and its busy tick-tock was
      added to the purring of the kettle. She stood in the middle
      of Mrs. Damaris' parlour. Her fear of the house had passed.
      She was aware of impressions following upon each other like
      the turning of the leaves of a book. The sun was shining
      in. It sleeked the room, and her body with it. She pressed
      her hands to breasts that were still firm and virginal, and
      her sense of the warmth and the colour of life was
      quickened. Compassion opens the eyes of the soul. You saw
      just that which you were capable of seeing, dust and
      monotony and greyness, or motes in the sunlight, the
      beauty, the red flower of loving service.
    </p>
    <p>
      O--this swift awareness! She wanted to lay her hands upon
      this house, to go up and down the stairs, to feel its
      emptiness filling with her presence. It wanted her, just as
      he did. But he was not going to tell her that he wanted
      her. She divined the restraint behind his silence. How
      pleasantly silent the place was. Nothing but the ticking of
      that clock. Vaguely she may have appreciated the fact that
      in later years she might come to love this silence, this
      aloofness from the vulgar screaming laughter and the ugly
      voices of common people and the nastiness of their
      children. Precious aloofness, growing more and more rare in
      these machine-made days. The house could possess dignity,
      distance. In it you could think your own thoughts, and
      think them as you pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furze came in with the teapot. She had noticed that the
      tea-service was different, a cheap and rather flowery
      thing; but she did not ask him what had become of the pink
      lustre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you pour out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      She seated herself on the sofa with her back to the window.
      He stood for a moment, glancing round to see if he had
      forgotten anything, and then sat down in a straight-backed
      chair on the other side of the table. She observed a lace
      d'oyley under the bought cake. Also, he had contrived to
      provide her with thin bread and butter, cut and buttered by
      himself. It was a sort of oblation, a practical confession
      of faith, and she was yet more touched by these little
      attempts at delicacy. Also she flushed with the heat of a
      remembered shame. In the old days he had offered her the
      same simple things and she had spurned them. How it must
      have hurt him! Yes,--she understood--now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared both shy and a little formal. He was
      entertaining both a friend and a stranger, and she realized
      how natural it was that he should be shy of her. He did not
      know what to expect, and so erected the assumption that he
      expected nothing. Each had much to forgive, but his shyness
      did not seem to assume that everything was forgiven.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked about Bobbo. O,--Bobbo was dead. So many people
      were dead. He too--he told her with a queer and serious
      smile--had come to remember that he was mortal. It made a
      difference--somehow; either you grew more restless--or
      kinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it has made me kinder," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She divined a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You,--but you are too young--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly thirty, Arnold--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A child.--Let me cut you some cake. I'm afraid it is not
      like your cake--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you. A child--dear man--is not much good at making
      good cakes--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Childhood is too much taken up with eating its cake,
      guzzling. O,--how pompous!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I suppose it's true."
    </p>
    <p>
      She met his eyes. He was looking at her as though he was
      discovering all sorts of puzzling changes in her. She was
      more solid, more sure; her brown eyes were just as liquid,
      but they had a quality that the Mary of the Viner days had
      lacked. She looked more firmly fleshed. She had things to
      say that made you pause and wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going to show me the farm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he would show her the farm. He still had Will with him
      and Will's boy. Will was one of those good, dog-like souls;
      the boy would never be the man his father was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who helps in the house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been waiting for that question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one,--just at present.--But I'm getting an old body to
      come in three days a week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is absolutely essential,--Arnold. A man has to be
      cooked for. Otherwise--makeshifts--cold potatoes--and
      indigestion."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a grave, shy, upward smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--that's so.--One can bless God--you know--even for an
      old body who can make you Irish stew."
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had come to "Doomsday" to be convinced, that little
      human confession of his would have conquered her.

    <p>
      But as the yellow leaves fell, and November brought grey
      skies and mud and misty meadows, Mary had to explore the
      inwardness of Furze's obstinate silence. That he wanted her
      was obvious; she could not be a woman and be near him
      without knowing it, though he put on the appearance of
      being the most practical of friends. Considered emotionally
      this aloofness betrayed a conscious inhibition, a fear of
      wanting her, a dread of the depth of the waters of his
      necessity. On the land the life goes on, demanding
      permanence. The moods of the weather are the only moods
      that can be acknowledged, and to fickle weather a man may
      fear to add the moods of a fickle woman. She felt this fear
      of his, and in recognizing its reasonableness, was driven
      to climb higher than her workaday self. She had to face
      finality. This man was rooted in the soil, and to be his
      mate she would have to take root beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought that she could do it. Her whole impulse now was
      towards the doing of it. Three months ago she would have
      used the word renunciation, but now she thought of the
      future as fulfilment. He had given her proofs of his new
      understanding. He had prepared and planted his little
      garden; it was there, as much there as he could make it,
      but he would not ask her to walk in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her problem was to convince him that she could be a mate,
      as well as a mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cinder Town itself impelled her along its cindery track.
      Romance? O,--perhaps! But one's neighbours are rarely
      romantic; they live too near. A man visited her, though it
      might be less than twice a week, and sat most respectably
      before the fire, and smoked a pipe, and talked of
      impersonal things. She too went to the farm. She supposed
      it was known, and it was. People still raise their eyebrows
      at such adventures. Even the Sage of Simla could speak of
      "Tightening up your social straps, don't you know. All this
      post-war laxity,--what!" She was both aware of Cinder Town
      and unaware of it. This congeries of failures did not
      matter. Her youth was insurgent. She was not going to be a
      failure. She was not going to think of herself as a colony
      of dying trees, people who had no roots, mere members
      lopped from the growing world and left to rot. Her man had
      a job, a job that mattered; she saw it now; he was one of
      the quiet workers hacking away at reality. He was part of a
      problem, one of the eternal problems. Man does not live by
      bread alone. No modern cry--that--in the self-crushing
      cities. In the years that were to come the man who gave
      bread and meat might be greater than King Coal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Divining the deadness of Cinder Town she was able to smile.
      She could smile at poor Coode's uncomfortable avoidings of
      her. He tried to turn a blind eye and failed. Simla looked
      at her rather severely with a glassy one. The Twists showed
      a certain nice chilliness; the Perrivales ceased to ask her
      to tea. It seemed to her very ridiculous. It did not hurt
      her in the least. It reinforced the emotional conviction
      that she belonged to "Doomsday" and not to Cinder Town. She
      was growing towards realities, the realities of the soil
      and the mine and the workshop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter was a wet one, and having dug her garden, and
      cut the grass for the last time during a spell of
      comparative dryness, and tidied up all the odd corners, and
      sorted out pea and bean sticks, she was left with nothing
      but her housework. She had learnt to organize the work; she
      found that she had quite half the day on her hands, and
      when "Doomsday" needed hands it seemed absurd that they
      should not be used there. The house was crying out for
      them. Furze's decrepit old "body" was too stiff to go down
      on her knees. "Doomsday," that strong old house, needed a
      strong young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary would sit and stare at the fire. The solitude of these
      long winter evenings seemed so irrational, when at the end
      of a muddy lane a man was equally lonely. Yes,--that muddy
      lane, Sussex mud,--reality! She dared it on occasions,
      flouting Cinder Town, wading with deliberate patience
      towards the inevitable! Mud and tears? The mud was
      unescapable, but the tears had not been wept, though the
      weeping of them might be necessary. She would weep--if
      tears would help him and her. She supposed--or rather
      felt--that no great thing can happen without emotion, or
      without the shadow of a possible tragedy clinging to it.
      Her tragedy might discover itself in Furze's refusal to
      believe in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were chances and prejudices to be dared. She felt at
      times that she and Furze were like two people on the edge
      of a cliff, she ready to throw herself over, he capable of
      pulling her back. "Don't be a fool, my dear; you will only
      break on the rocks." She had to convince him that she would
      not break, but here again she discovered a dilemma. Should
      she take the leap alone, and leave him up above, watching.
      She would have to cry to him--"See, I'm alive. I am not
      broken.--Believe in me,--follow." And supposing he refused
      to leap after her? Then, indeed, she would be broken and
      ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, on such a cliff, courage carried the lamp. Sitting
      solitary before her fire she saw pictures in it. She saw a
      woman's hand reaching out to pluck out the live coal. It
      might burn her; it was the old ordeal eternally dared, and
      sacredly suffered. Love and love's great compassion make
      such ordeals possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when three months had gone, she arose and stood
      prepared. His silence remained, and it was for her to
      challenge it. If he would have her ride naked through
      Coventry, then she would dare that ride. There is no shame
      in generous daring.
    </p>
    <p>
      She chose a day when his old "body" would not be there. She
      took what she needed with her, passing on the cinder road
      poor Coode trundling two chicken coops on a barrow. His one
      eye glanced woefully at her basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going shopping?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, obviously she was not going shopping. Her basket was
      full, for him and all the world to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good works," she said, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused to look dolefully after her. In fact, he left the
      barrow outside his gate and, slouching down the garden,
      played the devoted Peeping Tom. Through the leafless hedge
      he saw her go up the road and turn by the Six Firs into the
      "Doomsday" lane. "Doomsday!" Then--why the devil didn't the
      fellow marry her? Letting her compromise herself! It wasn't
      nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two muddy cart-ruts half full of yellow water brought her
      to the farmyard and the pond. No one was to be seen, but
      she heard the sound of the root-cutter in the barn where
      Will was feeding mangels into the machine while Furze
      turned the handle. Food for the sheep and the beasts! While
      other hands should be preparing food for the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one saw her enter the house. She went straight to the
      kitchen, taking her basket with her, to find that there was
      no fire in the range.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of his 'cold' days," she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tray full of breakfast crockery waiting to be washed lay
      on the dresser. She took off her hat and coat, put on an
      apron, and hunting up wood and paper and coal, lit the
      kitchen fire. Her housewife thoughts kept pace with her
      hands. "A good oil cooking-stove would save time and
      money." With the fire alight she explored the larder. On
      its whitewashed shelves she found a knuckle-end of cold
      mutton, a vegetable dish containing yesterday's boiled
      potatoes and cabbage, half a Dutch cheese, a few tomatoes,
      half an apple pie with a crust like putty. Poor man! His
      "old body's" hands had the English touch. Cabbages and
      boiled potatoes, and apples with the cores left in. She
      possessed herself of the cold mutton; she had brought some
      onions and potatoes with her, also a pot of jam, a tin of
      baking powder and some flour and raisins. But first she
      dealt with the dirty crockery and knives and forks, before
      sleeking herself over her cooking. She found that the oven
      promised well; she hunted out a pastry board and roller,
      cake and pie tins, a flour dredger, knives, spoons. She
      carried in the glass-faced clock and set it on the table.
      Then she got to work, sleeves rolled up, a woman happily
      full of kitchen affairs. She was a good cook when she
      chose, and she very much chose on this December morning.
      She had a cake and pastry baking in the oven; she contrived
      a savoury mess of mutton, onion, and crisply chipped
      potatoes. With her eyes on the clock she knew that he dined
      at half-past twelve, and that he would come in some minutes
      before the half-hour, to get what joy he could out of that
      very joyless larder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her excitement grew. She was flushed and bright eyed, and
      neither knew it nor cared. By a quarter-past twelve she had
      the table laid and had put off her apron and resumed her
      hat and coat. A jam tart and cheese biscuits were laid out,
      and a dish of savoury stew ready to be whisked out at the
      last moment when he should appear at the gate at the end of
      the path. That would give her time to place her dish upon
      the table, and escape by the back door, and through the
      vegetable garden and the larch plantation into the lane.
      She knelt upon the sofa and watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hands of the clock, replaced upon the mantelshelf,
      stood at five and twenty minutes past twelve. She kept her
      eyes on the end of the yew hedge where the brick path met
      the grey green of the oak gate. She saw Will and his boy
      pass and go up the lane. Furze would be coming, and so
      intent was she on watching for his coming that she did not
      think of other chances. She forgot the back door as means
      of entry as well as of escape, or that a man may develop a
      respect for his own floors. She was all eyes and no ears,
      kneeling there in a muse of staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Furze had come round by way of the orchard, and had
      pulled off his muddy boots at the back door. He entered
      through the kitchen on his socked feet, and stood in the
      doorway with her kneeling figure before him at the window.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      She was caught, but for the moment she did not know it. Her
      intent and watching poise, as she knelt upon the sofa with
      her hands resting on the back of it and two rather muddy
      little shoes turning their soles towards him, had in it
      something of mystery, of dear and eager childishness. He
      had the countryman's deliberate way of looking at things
      and of gathering their meaning. He saw the carefully laid
      table, the white sheen and the smoothness of it, the food
      that she had cooked. Obviously she was watching for
      somebody,--for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was startled. She had turned quickly as though the
      impression of his unseen presence had penetrated to her
      consciousness, and in her confusion and her quick
      smothering of it she was to him like light and shadow. She
      came down from the sofa. She began to button up her coat;
      she turned up the fur collar; she made herself appear
      deliberate, practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will find a dish of stew keeping warm in the oven--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But her coolness did not carry her very far. Her fur collar
      was up about her flushed cheeks. She made a little gliding
      movement towards the door, only to find him somehow between
      her and escape. He was immensely serious; his eyes looked
      at her all the while as though holding her and her
      adventure nailed upon a cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long have you been here, Mary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to hide behind an air of playfulness,--"O, long
      enough to make you a cake," but with his eyes still upon
      her she knew that concealment was useless. She and all the
      inwardness of her were naked. She looked up at him a little
      pathetically, but her pathos had courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mayn't I do things--? I want to. I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood very still; he was looking at the table, and his
      face seemed to her to be both bright and dark. And
      then--suddenly--he was near her; an arm held her close; she
      trembled; he was still looking at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," he said,--"you shouldn't--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her little brown hat was against his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why--? O,--my dear man--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt the tightened muscles of his arm, and hung on the
      edge of her crisis. For a moment he said nothing, and she
      waited, conscious of him as a human cloud charged with
      unknown forces. The clock ticked. He could feel her heart
      beating under his arm,--and suddenly his arm relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No,--my dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He put her gently away, and his gentleness desolated her.
      She stood alone, looking ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said.--"You are sorry for me. I'm not quite so
      selfish as I was."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the fire and stood for a moment with his back
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not going to let you be sorry for me. I'm all right
      now. The devil is cast out."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned squarely; he could smile. And for the moment she
      was mute, all eyes, repulsed yet not reproachful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you had your dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What you have cooked you shall share. I'll say grace to
      you for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed her a chair. He slipped his feet into a pair of
      slippers, and went and fetched more plates and cutlery and
      silver, and brought in the dish of stew. He stood by his
      own chair, with his hands on the back of it, head bowed.
      "For what I have received--I am thankful." He smiled
      suddenly yet slowly at her. "The savour of your offering I
      will take," said his eyes, "but not your sacrifice."
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't; you will be too hot in that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had to rise while he took her coat from her, and laid
      it gently on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you serve?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to hang--disconsolate and tragic over her own
      hands. She filled his plate and passed it to him, and made
      her eyes meet his, for the great issue had to be met.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't believe in me, Arnold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe in a woman being sorry for a man, my
      dear," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not,--I'm not. I'm sorry for myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      He let that pass, and there was silence between them for a
      while.--"You are hungry, Arnold; I'll not chatter."--He
      raised a slow and thoughtful head.--"Thanks, my dear." But
      they were talking to each other over the tense chords of
      silence, each consciousness pressing upon the other,
      contending dearly with a passionate awareness of the
      other's presence. She felt that she was being judged, that
      she was riding naked, and yet that he judged her with eyes
      of reverence and kindness. He had a right to judge. But was
      he judging? Was he not the man of the soil, saying that
      such and such a field could not carry the crop she wished
      to grow upon it? He considered the realities. But what did
      he think of her cooking? That was a reality. She ate but
      little herself; she kept her eyes on his bent head; he was
      eating very slowly. She felt that he was eating her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it all right, Arnold?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can cook, Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened to the full the appeal of her wide brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for once--but for always. You won't allow me that. I
      know. It is understandable. And yet you have changed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How,--my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since the autumn. You know;--the house and you. I allow it
      to you; it has touched and humbled me. And yet--you won't
      allow--that I have changed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do allow it, Mary, That's why--I don't snatch. It
      wouldn't be fair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at your shoes, my dear, all Sussex clay. Five or six
      months of that in a year; a muddy lane; lamps lit at
      half-past four. You are too fine and sensitive; you are
      trying to be generous to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not. I want to be real--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His smile puzzled her; it was so deliberate and kind and
      sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reality! The soil! Yet what things grow out of the soil--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love does,--and the hard oak,--Arnold--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oak. Hard oak is kind. My dear,--I won't ask you--. No, it
      is no good. How much oak would there be left in me if I had
      to watch you eating your heart out here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She pushed her plate away, and hid her face in her crossed
      arms laid upon the oak of the table. He looked at her.
      There was a quiver about his lips, and his eyes yearned. He
      half rose--and sat down again. She was quite silent; there
      might be tears in that concealment; or it might be the
      bowing down of a woman in labour and in prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up and touched her shoulder very gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary, it is not your life, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her face from her arms. It was not the face that
      he had expected to see. It had a bright pallor. She stood
      up, strong and straight, as though conscious of a burden
      and her power to bear it. There were no tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must think--" she said,--"I must think."
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed by him without looking, and took up her coat.
      She put it on, and the dark fur was a soft wreath under the
      firm pallor of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would make you believe in me? Would anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There must be--must be something. I must go away and
      think."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the door, he following her with eyes and heart
      and head. She paused at the door, opened it, and stood
      looking along the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You make it hard for me, Arnold,--and yet--yet so easy--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have touched her, but she put out a quick hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, dear, no, not in that way--and not yet. You don't know
      me--quite,--not as I know myself."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was about three o'clock on a December afternoon, and
      Christmas Eve, when she locked the front door of "Green
      Shutters," and picked up her suitcase. A steady drizzle had
      been falling, and though it had ceased, a grey and smoky
      gloom enveloped the landscape. She went down the muddy
      path, opened and closed the gate with an air of deliberate
      calmness, for Cinder Town was very much about her, looking
      like a collection of modern "English homes" as exhibited at
      Olympia. She knew that she was observed by Cinder Town; she
      had prepared herself to expect to meet people, and she did.
      Poor Coode stood nobly off the path for her as though he
      were letting a funeral pass. His one eye observed her
      suitcase.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me,--but are you carrying that to the station?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him. There was no guile in his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,--no, not so far."
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not help noticing that he looked shocked. She was
      sorry, and she was still feeling sorry when she met Colonel
      Sykes full of lunch and coming from Carslake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, going away for Christmas? Capital,--splendid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. A happy Christmas to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same to you, madam, the same to you. Your sister's--I
      suppose. Capital!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was considering her and her affairs like an inquisitive
      old woman, and she showed him a face of austere serenity.
      Should she blurt out the truth, just for the sake of
      hoisting her flag? No, surely it was not worth it. So few
      people deserve the truth. Moreover--in a day or two--they
      would be able to enjoy her nakedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A happy Christmas to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      With those ironical, old and homely words upon her tongue
      she passed on, aware of the interrogations behind the eye
      of glass. She turned into the main road and went up it
      until she came to the Six Firs and the "Doomsday" lane. She
      looked up at the dark tops of the trees, drew a deep
      breath, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lane was muddier than ever, pocketed by the hoofs of
      beasts, and seamed with wagon tracks, but by keeping close
      to one dripping hedge it was possible to walk upon a strip
      of grass. She picked her way past the mud-holes and over
      the ruts. Furze's tumbril had been carting coal, and at one
      rotten place two large chunks of coal that had been jerked
      from the tumbril lay waiting to be recovered from the
      sludge. By the pond the surface was so rotten that faggots
      had been thrown down, and as she passed over them yellow
      water oozed up between the sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint haze seemed to hang over the byres, and she had a
      glimpse of Furze stodging across yellow straw with a big
      zinc food-pan upon his shoulder. He did not see her. She
      pushed open the oak gate, and went up to the house. For a
      moment she paused outside the door, her dark eyes looking
      back along the lane as though she were suffering herself to
      absorb its muddy significance. Vacillation had left her.
      She had no need of courage, for her purpose and its
      inspired impulse made all that she did and dared seem
      humanly inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went in and closed the door. She put her suitcase on
      the sofa, and took off her hat and coat. The fire needed
      mending, and she mended it, not as a guest,--but as the
      hearth-tender. Then she carried her suitcase up the stairs
      and into the room overlooking Mrs. Damaris's sunk garden,
      the room where the other woman had slept, Rose, the wife.
      It had not been used since Rose's death, but it was clean
      and fresh, and in the bottom drawer of the chest she found
      two new blankets. She took them out and laid them on the
      white bedspread covering the mattress. She would need
      sheets, bolster, pillow slips; she could find those later.
      Meanwhile, she opened her suitcase and unpacked it,
      arranged her brushes and mirror and comb and manicure set
      upon the dressing-table, put out her shoes, and opened the
      various drawers. Some of them held woman's gear. She left
      most of these relics untouched, and clearing herself one
      long drawer, put away her linen and woollens, her
      nightdresses, her handkerchief sachet and stockings. The
      spare dress that she had brought with her she hung upon the
      door. One plain white nightdress was laid upon the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her wrist-watch told her that it was a quarter to four.
      Descending the narrow stairs she hung the kettle on the
      chain over the living-room fire, and going into the
      kitchen, collected the tea things on a tray. She carried
      the tray in and set the table. She hung up her hat and
      coat, using the pegs fastened to the parlour door. The
      kettle was singing. She cut two rounds of bread from the
      loaf, put the butter to warm, and kneeling down, made
      toast, using a knife as a toasting-fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was kneeling there when Furze came in, and she remained
      there quite still, as though she had lived in the house for
      years and had become part of it and its life. He paused to
      look at her. He hung up his hat. He had left his muddy
      boots outside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      His slippers were by the fire. She held them out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ready,--Arnold?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her curiously as he took the slippers. There
      seemed to him something final about her,--a suggestion of
      fixity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Toast--buttered toast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll make the tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose with her plate of brown bread, and the butter
      dish, and placing both upon the table, began to spread the
      butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The kettle is boiling."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to take it off the hook, but paused to look at her.
      She seemed intent upon spreading the yellow butter on the
      brown toast. She had spoken very quietly, and she moved as
      quietly as she spoke. He caught an impression of soft,
      tragic, still finality. She might have been there for
      years, doing these familiar simple things as though she had
      a right to do them, and would surrender that right to no
      one. The room seemed very still; the clock ticked; the
      knife made a crisp sound on the toast as she spread the
      butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted the kettle from the hook, and then stood holding
      it as though he had forgotten its existence. He had noticed
      that she had changed her shoes; she was wearing black and
      silver house-shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the tea in the pot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was filling the brown pot when she uncovered her crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have put my things in Rose's room. Do you mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His hands remained steady. She was cutting the toast into
      squares.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your things--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--I can take one of the other rooms--if you would
      rather. I have unpacked,--but I can move."
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed the teapot on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What things--exactly--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why--my things,--what I want for the moment. I came down
      with a suitcase. The rest can be packed--and brought
      down--later."
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her glances, and pretended to be busy with the
      things upon the table. He stood there, completely
      still,--holding the kettle, and she wondered how long he
      would remain there holding it. She had the courage to look
      at his face,--but did not look.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aware of him hanging the kettle on the hook. It
      seemed to her that he loitered for an unconscionable time
      before the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary,--what's this--mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down and began to pour out the tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am to be your housekeeper. Come and have tea, or the
      toast will get cold. If you want to discuss anything,
      Arnold,--we can talk it over afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood and stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Housekeeper!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come.--Yes,--they know up there at Cinder Town. I told the
      Vachetts this morning."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was the most silent meal that she had ever sat through.
      His face, perplexed and distressed, was like a mirror into
      which for some reason she dared not look. She wanted to run
      to him and take his head in her arms and cry "O--my
      dear--don't look so tragic. Laugh,--speak to me." Once only
      did he break the silence, holding his cup and staring into
      it as though searching for an inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't stay here, Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat up straight and calm in her chair, hiding her
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I must. You think I can't stand this life,--that I'm
      restless and fickle. A woman wants to be wanted, and when
      she is wanted she wants to get to work. You will try me for
      six months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As my housekeeper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed his chair back, and went to stand by the fire and
      fill a pipe, and she turned her chair so that she was
      facing him and the fire. His face was all cloud, and the
      gloom of him made her more gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,--Arnold. Let's be honest,--let's be real. You want
      me, and I--you. But you don't believe in me yet, and you
      can't have me till you believe in me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent down and held a spill to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--good God--my dear,--don't you see--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I see. I'm wide-eyed, dear man. I'm not playing
      a trick on you. Like Godiva I'm ready to ride through
      Coventry."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a jerk of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the world--the nice--merciful world--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course.--I accept that. And if I fail, my dear,
      well--I'll go as I came. When you have failed--in the great
      thing--nothing matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned against the mantelshelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, it is too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I shan't fail. Nor will my being here cost you more. I
      am arranging to let 'Green Shutters' furnished. That--with
      my little income--should give two hundred a year."
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a movement of protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't--my dear. It is not that. But don't you see that I
      can't accept--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He would not look, and she sat very straight and still and
      silent until he had to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you want me, Arnold,--you will let me try."
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him that her face was transfigured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you don't want me--well--nothing matters."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He had to go out again to feed and milk, putting on his
      muddy boots at the door, and taking a lantern with him, for
      the night had come down like a mass of wet crêpe. She went
      out with him to the door and saw him go out. "It is
      Christmas Eve, Arnold." So it was; he had forgotten. She
      stood and watched his figure grow dim beside the swinging
      lantern, the rays of which played upon the smoking drizzle.
      She glanced upwards, and realized that no stars would shine
      on this Christmas Eve, and that they could not be expected
      to shine, and that her one star was her man's lantern. It
      had disappeared behind the yew hedge, but she could trace
      its passing by a faint and moving aureole like the glow
      about the Grail.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were lamps to be lit, and she lit them, and cleared
      away the tea things, and washed up. She was in the midst of
      her crisis. It would not do for her to sit still and drift,
      for she did not know what manner of man would come back to
      her out of the darkness. Her bed was waiting to be made,
      and she lit a candle, and spent a quarter of an hour
      hunting for sheets, finding them at last in an oak press in
      Furze's bedroom. She spread them over the backs of two
      chairs in front of the fire, and while they were airing she
      explored the larder and considered the problem of his
      supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later she was upstairs, making up her bed when she
      heard a door bang. He had come in with the milk, and she
      went to the head of the stairs and called to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What time would you like supper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She got no reply other than a distant clanking of cans in
      the dairy, and presently she heard him go out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to smile. No doubt it was a somewhat disturbing
      experience for a man to find himself the sudden possessor
      of a young housekeeper, and to be shut up with her in a
      lonely farmhouse on Christmas Eve. Or was he accepting her
      at her own valuation, and preparing to allow her those six
      probationary months? Well, it was she who had issued the
      ultimatum.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made up her bed; she would lie in it; that was the most
      final thing she could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      By eight o'clock she had supper ready, and had found some
      mending to do, and was sitting by the fire, steadily
      stitching, and awaiting her fate. She looked much calmer
      than she felt, and she was trying to feel that she belonged
      to and that nothing could move her from that fireside. She
      was willing herself into the house. She kept repeating the
      words--"I am staying,--I am staying." She did not know that
      he had come softly to the window, and looked in on her, and
      gone away with a sombre and perplexed face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hands of the clock stood at half-past eight. She put
      her work aside, seemed to reflect for a moment, and then
      went and opened the porch door. The night was a black
      drizzle. She could hear a sound coming from one of the
      buildings, the sound of wood being sawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went down the path and called to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arnold,--supper's ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sawing ceased for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supper's ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have yours. I shall be late."
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to wait. She felt that she could touch no
      food, for the food that she craved was the proof of his
      need of her. The clock struck nine, nine loud, rackety,
      clanging strokes. She picked up her work, and sat with the
      lamplight shining on her hair. She tried to catch the sound
      of the saw, but not being able to hear it, she rose and
      opened the window. Then she could hear it. It went on and
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o'clock he was still sawing wood, and she was
      sitting with her hands lying relaxed and idle in her lap.
      Suddenly her face had taken on a look of extreme weariness.
      She sat there for quite a long while before the final
      inspiration stirred in her. She rose, put her work away,
      lit a candle and went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in bed when she heard him moving in the room below.
      She lay very stiff and straight, listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she heard him come up the stairs. He passed the
      door of her room, and went along the narrow landing to his.
      He paused there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night, Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      His door closed. She pressed her hands to her breasts. Had
      she lost or won?
    </p>
    <p>

      In that dead season of the year a month passed with an
      eternal drift of rain against the windows, and without ten
      hours of sunlight to be remembered. The pond overflowed,
      and oozing over the farm road turned the lower third of the
      lane into a yellow squelch. Furze put down more faggots.
      The wheels of wagon and tumbril were caked with mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the house Mary cooked and cleaned and washed and mended,
      and lit fires and trimmed lamps, and scoured milk cans and
      pails. For a week she did not go farther than the bed in
      the vegetable garden where the winter greens grew; she
      needed them for cooking, and that is why she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      At meals they sat decorously opposite each other, uneasily
      self-possessed, while between them stood that bowl of red
      and mystic fruit towards which neither would stretch out a
      hand. She had asked for her six months, and he was giving
      her her six months. It was her probation, and astonished at
      herself and at him she clasped her burden. She held it hard
      against her heart, secretly exulting, watchful, calm. She
      would not fail. She had him in the dark and tender toils of
      her surrender, and each day she drew them closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first Saturday when Mary went up to Carslake to shop
      she knew at once what all the world was saying. It was
      unnecessary for that little pug of a man behind the
      grocer's counter to ask her that particular question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To 'Green Shutters,' Miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, 'Doomsday' Farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out of Carslake with a patch of colour on each
      cheek, and her eyes both bright and cloudy. She exulted.
      What more could she surrender? She had begun to understand
      Furze's awkward and passionate silences, his glances that
      touched her dearly and then seemed to turn inwards with
      impatient self-reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had he been so fed or cared for even in Rose's day.
      She brought a daintiness into the house, a perfume, an
      indescribable something that seemed to cling to the very
      furniture. Her practicality was not all puddings. Hardly a
      day passed without his noticing something fresh, some nice
      detail, a little feminine gesture. The house had changed;
      it seemed warmer, more intimate, better clothed, more full
      of colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrying her Godiva ride to the very alley's end, she
      bribed Will to take the tumbril up to Cinder Town, and to
      carry and load for her some of her possessions. Furze's
      tumbril! It was there for all Cinder Town to see, and so
      was Godiva herself, coming and going and carrying things.
      Poor Coode saw her; so did Colonel Sykes. It added cream to
      the scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Furze heard of it he looked troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God--she has pluck!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was it wantonness, nor the clinching of a bargain, nor
      the application of more birdlime for the sentimental
      trapping of her triumph. He knew that, but without quite
      knowing how he knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each night at bedtime they went through the same parade.
      She would rise, put her work away with an air of glowing
      placidity, while he would watch her half furtively,
      devotedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be going now, Arnold. Good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night. I think I'll read a bit longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      She would go upstairs to bed, and he would sit and listen
      to her moving in the room above. All life seemed to move
      with her; she was the breath and the murmur of it. And on
      more than one night he rose and began to walk about the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough" was his cry,--"I was a beast to let her prove it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the oak in him still held.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Why he woke so early on that February morning Furze could
      not say. No sound had startled him. Gloom still curtained
      the windows; he was conscious of both a nearness and a
      loneliness, something that called.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lit a candle and dressed. He went out on his socked feet
      into the passage, feeling that other presence in the house
      like a sacred flame burning. Woman but not wife! And the
      careless breath of the world, the gigglings, the
      irreverences.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he felt profoundly shocked, shocked with
      himself, but not with her. He went softly along the
      passage, and stood outside her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary--beloved--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried the handle; the door was not locked. He went
      softly in, shading the candle with one hand; she was
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it seemed to him that she had been weeping while she
      slept. Her hair made a dark wreath; her lashes threw
      shadows; her mouth looked plaintive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God," he thought,--"what is man--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He withdrew his hand from screening the candle. And
      suddenly she woke. Her eyes looked up at him; a smile
      seemed to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arnold,--what is it--? Am I late?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the candle on the chair beside the bed, and knelt
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, my dear, you are greater than I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took his head in her arms, and turning softly, blew out
      the candle.
    </p>
    <p>
