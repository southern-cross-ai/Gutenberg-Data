  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1">I.&mdash;FOR THE QUEEN</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Gunter's Magazine</i>, Aug 1907</h3>

  <p class="first">"YOU are&mdash;Milord Cravon?"</p>

  <p>I admitted the fact meekly, but with a lamentable absence of dignity,
  being, indeed, too utterly amazed for coherency. Whereupon my visitor raised
  her veil, flashed a brilliant smile upon me and sat down.</p>

  <p>"I was sure of it," she remarked, speaking with great fluency, but with a
  strong foreign accent. "Milord's likeness to his brother is remarkable. I am
  very fortunate to discover you so early. It is but half an hour since I
  reached London."</p>

  <p>That she had discovered me was obvious, but how or why was more than I
  could imagine. She was a complete stranger to me, she had entered my rooms
  unannounced, and the little French clock upon my mantelpiece had just struck
  midnight. However, she had mentioned my brother! I spoke of him at once.</p>

  <p>"You know Reggie, then?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"I have met Mr. Reginald Lessingham once or twice," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"At Marianburg?"</p>

  <p>"At Marianburg&mdash;and elsewhere!"</p>

  <p>"You have come from there?" I asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded, and loosened her travelling cloak.</p>

  <p>"I left Marianburg," she said, "exactly forty hours ago. It is rapid
  travelling, is it not? I am very tired and very hungry. If your servants have
  not all gone to bed, may I have some supper, please, and a glass of wine?
  Anything will do!"</p>

  <p>I secretly pinched myself and then rang the bell. I had not fallen to
  sleep over my pipe and final whisky and Apollinaris. This remarkable and
  mysterious invasion of my solitude was an undoubted fact. By the time Groves
  appeared my visitor had removed her hat and was contemplating the arrangement
  of her hair in the mirror. Groves, who was a model servant, gave a momentary
  start of surprise and then looked steadily into vacancy. He received my
  confused orders in eloquent but respectful silence.</p>

  <p>"Some supper, Groves&mdash;for one. Anything cold, and some wine!"</p>

  <p>He disappeared. My companion succeeded in the replacement of a refractory
  curl, and with a parting glance at the mirror resumed her seat. I rose to my
  feet and began to collect my scattered wits.</p>

  <p>"Do I understand," I began, "that you bring me a message from my
  brother?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I have met your brother," she said, "but I have never yet spoken with
  him. He certainly does not know me or who I am."</p>

  <p>I opened my lips to ask her bluntly what had brought her to my rooms at
  such an hour, but the words remained unspoken. Now that her hat was removed I
  was suddenly conscious that she was an exceedingly pretty woman. She lounged
  in my most comfortable chair perfectly at her ease, a charming smile upon her
  lips, her dark eyes meeting mine frankly and lit with a distinct gleam of
  humour. She was becomingly dressed, and although the dust of travel was upon
  her shoes and clothes, the details and finish of her <i>toilette</i> were
  sufficiently piquant to indicate her nationality. She was distinctly a very
  attractive woman. I felt my annoyance at her unexpected appearance decrease
  as my curiosity concerning her grew.</p>

  <p>"Did I understand," I began, after a few moments' silence," that you had
  come from Marianburg to see me?"</p>

  <p>She laughed outright, and showed a set of perfectly white teeth. It was a
  dazzling smile, and the teeth were magnificent.</p>

  <p>"Not altogether, Milord Cravon. I have come on a matter of very great
  importance, though, and you are concerned in it."</p>

  <p>I signified my interest and my desire to hear more. She seemed in no
  hurry, however, to complete her explanation.</p>

  <p>"I am so hungry!" she remarked, with pathetic irrelevance.</p>

  <p>I moved to the bell, but at that moment Groves re-entered, bearing a small
  table. He silently but deftly arranged some cold things upon the sideboard
  and produced wine and a corkscrew. "You need not wait, Groves," I said,
  avoiding his eyes. "Bring in some coffee when I ring." He left the room and I
  proceeded to the sideboard.</p>

  <p>"What may I give you?" I asked. "There is some collared stuff, cold
  salmon, and galantine."</p>

  <p>"I will see," she answered, rising and coming to my side, "which looks the
  nicest!"</p>

  <p>She made a selection, and was kind enough to express her approval of the
  result.</p>

  <p>"Champagne or claret?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Champagne, if you please&mdash;one glass! Thank you. Now sit down and go
  on smoking, and I will talk to you."</p>

  <p>I obeyed her. She was obviously a young woman who was used to having her
  own way, and it seemed to be the easiest thing to do.</p>

  <p>"In the first place," she remarked, with something which sounded like a
  sigh, "who am I? It is what you want to know, eh? I would very much rather
  not tell you, Milord Cravon; for when you know, perhaps you will be sorry
  that you have been kind to me! Hélas!"</p>

  <p>I moved in my chair uncomfortably, and murmured an insane desire that she
  would not needlessly distress herself by unnecessary revelations. She brushed
  my words aside. She was forced to declare herself.</p>

  <p>"I am," she said, "a spy!"</p>

  <p>"A what?" I cried.</p>

  <p>"A spy! You understand&mdash;a creature of the police. It is you English,
  is it not, who detest so much the detective, who do not recognize the art of
  espionage?"</p>

  <p>"By no means," I answered. "On the contrary, undertaken for the right
  motives and by the right class of man or woman, it is a magnificent
  profession, or, rather, I should call it a science!"</p>

  <p>"You are right," she cried fervently, "Milord Cravon! You are charming!
  You are the most intelligent Englishman I have ever met!"</p>

  <p>I bowed and waved my hand.</p>

  <p>"It is a profession," I continued, "which as yet is "only in its infancy.
  It demands ingenuity, invention and originality. To succeed in it one must be
  an artist. The lights and shadows of human nature must become a close and
  constant study."</p>

  <p>"Milord Cravon," she cried, lifting a glass of champagne in her hand, "you
  are adorable!"</p>

  <p>"The prejudices you spoke of," I continued, "are natural! As yet it is a
  profession which has been adopted only by persons of inferior calibre! It
  should be lifted to a place amongst the fine arts. I drink, Mademoiselle, to
  your calling with all respect and much enthusiasm!"</p>

  <p>She leaned over and clinked the edge of her glass against my tumbler. Her
  eyes were very bright and her smile was bewitching. She was, I decided, the
  prettiest woman I had ever seen in my life!</p>

  <p>"Milord Cravon," she murmured softly, "you are the most delightful man in
  the world!"</p>

  <p>"And now," I remarked, "suppose you tell me in what I am to have the
  honour of serving you."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You have not heard, "she asked, "from your brother Reginald?"</p>

  <p>"Not for more than a week," I answered. "Is anything wrong with him?"</p>

  <p>She glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"In a few minutes," she said, "he will be here!" I looked up,
  startled.</p>

  <p>"What, here in England!" I exclaimed; " Reggie?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes. He is in trouble!"</p>

  <p>"In trouble! Of what sort?"</p>

  <p>"He will tell you himself. It will be better so."</p>

  <p>I rose to my feet, worried and anxious.</p>

  <p>"You say that Reggie is in trouble, is coming here!" I said. "You are in
  the service of the police of Marianburg. Does that mean that you have
  followed him?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No. The police of Marianburg are on his side. I am here as an ally, I am
  here to help him. You too, Milord Cravon, must help, for it is great trouble
  into which Mr. Reginald has fallen!"</p>

  <p>A smothered groan from behind her startled us both. The cigarette which I
  had just lit dropped from my fingers and lay smoking upon the floor. A minute
  before I could have sworn that we were alone in the room, but at some time or
  other during our conversation the man who stood before us must have made his
  noiseless entrance. No wonder that we were taken by surprise! Only two of the
  electric lights were burning, and the room was full of shadows. Standing
  amongst them, with his fiercely bright eyes fixed upon us, was a young man
  whose features, in those first few moments of half-alarmed surprise, were
  only vaguely familiar to me. His face was the face of a boy, smooth and
  beardless, but its intense pallor and the black lines underneath his
  bloodshot eyes had transfigured him. His evening clothes were all awry, his
  white tie had slipped up behind his ear, the flower in his coat was crushed
  into a shapeless pulp, his shirt was crumpled and his clothes were splashed
  with mud. He stood a grim, dramatic figure, only a few yards away from our
  touch, glaring at us like a wild animal face to face with its captors.</p>

  <p>The clock on the mantelpiece ticked for thirty seconds or more, and still
  my lips were sealed. For years people had told that my brother, Reggie
  Lessingham, was one of the smartest and most debonair young men in Europe.
  Was it any wonder that recognition dawned but slowly upon me?</p>

  <p>My companion was naturally the first to recover herself. Indeed, after her
  little exclamation of dismay at his sudden appearance, she seemed to treat
  Reggie's presence as a matter of course. But for my part it was a terrible
  shock to me.</p>

  <p>"Reggie!" I cried. "What&mdash;what in the name of all that's horrible is
  the matter, boy? Are you ill?"</p>

  <p>He tottered rather than walked towards us, and stood still, with shaking
  hands resting upon the little table where my mysterious guest had been
  supping. He looked first at her and then at me, but when he opened his mouth
  to speak no words came&mdash;only a harsh, dry rattle from the back of his
  throat. He was like a man whom torture had driven to the furthermost bounds
  of insanity.</p>

  <p>I caught up a tumbler, and filling it with champagne, forced some between
  his lips. He drank it with a little gasp. I helped him into a chair, and drew
  it up to the fire. He was still shaking all over, but his appearance was more
  natural.</p>

  <p>"Come! You look a different man now," I said quietly. "What's wrong? Tell
  me all about it. I thought that you were in Marianburg. Are you home on
  leave?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer. He looked from the girl to me, and then into the fire.
  It seemed as though he had lost the power of speech. I gripped him by the
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Have you been drinking, Reggie?" I cried. "Come, pull yourself together.
  Remember, I have heard nothing as yet."</p>

  <p>Still there was no answer. The burning light faded out from his bloodshot
  eyes. He sank back wearily in his chair&mdash;he was utterly exhausted by
  excitement and intense nervous strain. My visitor came softly over to my
  side.</p>

  <p>"Make him tell you," she whispered. "There is no time to be lost. He can
  tell you what has happened better than I can."</p>

  <p>I rested my hand upon his shoulder and spoke firmly.</p>

  <p>"Reggie, old chap, "I said, "make a clean breast of it. Let me know the
  worst. Is anything wrong at headquarters&mdash;a row with the chief, eh? I
  shall stand by you; you can rely upon that. Come! out with it!"</p>

  <p>Reggie looked up at us with white face and trembling lips. He was in a
  terrible state.</p>

  <p>"Close the door, Maurice," he faltered.</p>

  <p>I obeyed him. He followed me with his eyes, and then looked searchingly
  round the room. I began to fear that the boy's brain had given way.</p>

  <p>"You are Marie Lichenstein?" he said suddenly, addressing my guest.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I know all about it. You can speak before me."</p>

  <p>"You were at Cologne?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am more used to rapid travelling than you," she remarked. "I came from
  Ostend, and saved two hours."</p>

  <p>"You have heard nothing from Marianburg?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I was to come here and wait for instructions."</p>

  <p>Reggie was silent for a moment. When he spoke again, it was to me he
  turned.</p>

  <p>"Maurice," he faltered, "something hideous has happened to me. You will
  help me! For God's sake don't say no!"</p>

  <p>"Of course I will help you," I answered readily; "only I must know what it
  is all about. Tell me the whole story."</p>

  <p>He shivered.</p>

  <p>"The whole story! No, I can't do that now."</p>

  <p>"Something has happened at headquarters?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have been robbed! There was a burglary at the Embassy, and I was
  robbed of some papers."</p>

  <p>A light began to break in upon me. After all, nothing so terribly tragic
  had happened. Reggie had probably been indiscreet. A few words to the Foreign
  Secretary would set matters right.</p>

  <p>"State papers, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head with a groan.</p>

  <p>"Worse! Much worse!"</p>

  <p>The light faded away. I was more puzzled than ever.</p>

  <p>"Worse than State papers?" I repeated vaguely.</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>He looked at the door again and all round the room. His voice sank to a
  whisper. He took hold of my hand, and drew me down so that my head nearly
  touched his. I could feel his finger-nails burning in my flesh.</p>

  <p>"Swear, Maurice&mdash;ay, and you too, Marie Lichenstein&mdash;upon your
  honour, upon your sacred honour, that what I am going to tell you shall never
  pass your lips&mdash;that you will lock it deep down in your memories!
  Swear!"</p>

  <p>"I swear, Reggie!"</p>

  <p>Marie Lichenstein inclined her head.</p>

  <p>"To me," she said, "these things are holy. It is my profession. Besides, I
  already know what you are going to say."</p>

  <p>His voice sank to a husky whisper! His eyes were afire!</p>

  <p>"They were the letters of a woman&mdash;whom I loved&mdash;who loved
  me!"</p>

  <p>"A woman!" I exclaimed. "Letters! Why, Reggie!"</p>

  <p>The relief in my tone seemed to irritate him. He held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"You do not understand. Those letters were mine. They have been stolen
  from me. It is a plot of her enemies. They were written by a woman who loved
  me. They were written impetuously, without prudence, signed with her name. I
  told her &mdash;that they were destroyed! I lied, for I kept some of them. I
  could not bear to part with all. They were precious to me. If I do not get
  them back at once, I shall shoot myself. I have sworn it! But God help her!
  God help her!"</p>

  <p>"Have you any clue, any idea where they are?" I asked. "You have come to
  England. Do you think that they have been brought here?"</p>

  <p>"She has enemies," he muttered, "enemies everywhere, and powerful. My
  servant must have been in their pay. He has absconded, and he has come to
  England. He had only a few hours' start, but I cannot find him!"</p>

  <p>"What, Shalders?" I asked. "Surely you cannot suspect him!"</p>

  <p>"Suspect!" Reggie beat upon the floor with his heel. "It is no matter for
  suspicions. It is he who robbed the safe. He is in England somewhere. I must
  find him! We should have caught him on the boat."</p>

  <p>"Are they very bad, these letters?" I asked, "or were they only
  indiscreet?"</p>

  <p>"They are absolutely fatal," he gasped. "But it is not that they are so
  bad; it is&mdash;who she is!"</p>

  <p>We were all silent. Reggie's face was ashen. The girl was watching him
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"If I am to be of any use to you, Reggie," I said, "I must know her name,
  I must know all the circumstances."</p>

  <p>He half rose from his chair, clutching at the arms. His voice was
  hysterical.</p>

  <p>"It is a little packet!" he cried with a sob. "There are only four letters
  and a ring, but with them goes&mdash;the honour of a queen!"</p>

  <p>At first I had but one thought&mdash;Reggie was mad! But when I looked
  from his white, anguish stricken face to my other visitor, I saw that she, at
  least, did not think so. Apparently she was not surprised. Reggie's bitter
  cry had only told her what she already knew. Then, whilst I stood there
  wondering, a sudden memory rose up before me. I thought of a long visit of my
  brother's years ago to the capital where he was now attache, and of certain
  half-jesting allusions to the beauty of a certain princess, which Reggie had
  taken very ill indeed. There had been a paragraph in a so-called Society
  paper, scandalous but vague; somebody had shown it to him, and Reggie's
  language had been awful to listen to. These things came back to me in those
  few tragical moments, and dimly suggested others. For years we in England had
  seen very little of Reggie. His leave was mostly spent at the capital to
  which he had taken special care to be appointed at his entry into diplomatic
  life. With contemporary history I was sufficiently well acquainted to know
  that the princess had become a queen. Conviction came to me with a sudden,
  lightning like rush. He had spoken the truth! I felt the perspiration stand
  out in beads upon my forehead as I recognized his terrible dilemma.</p>

  <p>"Reggie," I said, "I want the whole story, please. If I am to be of any
  use to you, I must hear it all. Out with it!"</p>

  <p>He hesitated, with his eyes fixed upon the girl. She shrugged her
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You do not mistrust me, Monsieur Lessingham?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I do not mistrust you," he said, "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped him with a little gesture.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well!" she exclaimed, "I do not wish that you should have any further
  anxiety. Look, if you will, upon my credentials."</p>

  <p>She drew a folded sheet of paper from her bosom and laid it upon the
  table. The words were so few and written so boldly that I too could see
  them?</p>

  <p class="letter">"Trust Marie Lichenstein.&mdash;Fedora."</p>

  <p>With a sudden movement Reggie lifted the piece of paper to his lips. Then
  he laid it reverently down.</p>

  <p>"You recognize the handwriting?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is enough," he answered. "You shall hear in a few words all that there
  is to tell. It is the story of a simple robbery. A packet of letters and a
  ring have been stolen in a most wonderful way from my room in the Embassy.
  They were kept"</p>

  <p>I held up my hand.</p>

  <p>"Reggie, forgive me, but I must know! Were they written before her
  marriage or after?"</p>

  <p>"All&mdash;save one&mdash;before. I have had letters since&mdash;a
  few&mdash;on my promise that I would destroy them as they came. I kept that
  promise faithfully &mdash;until last week. Then I was horribly tempted! I
  could not see her for several days. A letter came! Oh, I was foolish, but the
  letter meant so much to me!" he groaned. "I kept it for an hour or two,
  meaning to destroy it at night. It was stolen with the others!"</p>

  <p>"That letter "I began, looking searchingly at Reggie.</p>

  <p>"It was&mdash;at least&mdash;imprudent!" he moaned. "To those who do not
  know her, as I know her, it will seem worse!"</p>

  <p>I turned towards the girl. Had she anything to say? For my part, the
  matter seemed already hopeless. I could see no ray of light anywhere.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell us, please," she said, "all about the actual robbery?"</p>

  <p>"You have had particulars," he said. "You know all that there is to be
  known."</p>

  <p>"It is true," she admitted; " nevertheless, your brother does not, and I
  myself would like to hear the story from your own lips."</p>

  <p>He rested his head wearily upon his hand; he had taken a chair now, and
  began with his eyes fixed upon the fire.</p>

  <p>"I kept the packet in a safe let into the wall of my room, and fastened
  with a combination cipher and Bramah key, exactly the same as the chief has
  for the treaty safe. The letter I speak about I received by hand on Sunday
  morning. I had it with me all day. At eight o'clock I went out to dine. I
  left the letter with the other packet in my safe. The key never leaves my
  person. I have a hollow gold band around my arm, and the key fits into it.
  When I returned at night everything was as usual. I opened the safe, meaning
  to read the letter over and then destroy it. It was gone and with it the
  packet and a ring. I rang my bell. There was no answer. I rushed along the
  passage of the Embassy shouting for Shalders. He was my servant. No one knew
  anything about him. I behaved, I am afraid, like a maniac. I should have been
  cool, but I was not. I could not contain myself. At last I heard news. He had
  been seen to leave the house about an hour after me, carrying a bag. I traced
  him to the station; he had taken a ticket to London. I followed him."</p>

  <p>"The key?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He touched his arm.</p>

  <p>"It is here still. It has not left my possession for a second."</p>

  <p>"How do you suppose, then, that the safe was opened?"</p>

  <p>Reggie groaned.</p>

  <p>"God alone knows! All I can say is, that it was done with a key, and the
  only other one made has never been out of the chief's possession, or, at any
  rate, out of the secretary's room. Sir Henry assured me of that himself. How
  the cipher could have been adjusted, and the safe opened Oh, Maurice!" he
  cried wearily, "it makes my brain whirl to think of it!"</p>

  <p>He dropped his head wearily into his hands and leaned upon the table. At
  that moment there was a knock at the door. Groves came softly into the little
  circle of light with a telegram upon his salver. He brought it to me. It was
  addressed to "Miss Lichenstein, c/o the Earl of Cravon."</p>

  <p>"I thought that it might be for the young lady," Groves murmured.</p>

  <p>I handed it to her. She studied it for a few moments in silence. Then she
  took her gloves from the table.</p>

  <p>"Will you allow your servant to call for me a hansom cab?" she asked. "I
  must go."</p>

  <p>"Is there any news?" Reggie asked, suddenly looking up with white
  face.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not yet. These are my instructions; I must obey them at once. Monsieur
  Reginald, do not despair! I shall do my best. Milord Cravon, <i>au
  revoir</i>! It has been a very leetle visit, but&mdash;oh! so pleasant!"</p>

  <p>Her dark eyes flashed sweetly at me, and she took her leave with a
  bewitching smile and backward glance over her shoulder. I heard Groves
  whistle for a hansom, and she drove rapidly away. Then I went back to Reggie.
  He was leaning forward across the table, and was breathing heavily. I bent
  over him quietly. He had fallen asleep. In the morning I was even more
  shocked to see the alteration in my brother. His clothes hung loosely about
  him, as though he were just recovering from a long illness; his cheeks were
  haggard, and his eyes deep-set and unnaturally bright. He held a telegram in
  his hand when I entered the room.</p>

  <p>"Any news?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"None," he answered mournfully. "My message simply says, 'Situation
  unchanged.'"</p>

  <p>I rang the bell for breakfast. Until he had eaten something I would not
  let him speak. Afterwards I pushed two easy chairs to the fire, and passed
  him a pipe and some tobacco.</p>

  <p>"I am going to ask you some questions, Reggie," I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Go on," he answered feverishly.</p>

  <p>"How long has Shalders been with you?"</p>

  <p>"For six years. Ever since I had a man."</p>

  <p>"Has he been a good servant?"</p>

  <p>"I would have trusted him," Reggie said, "with my life."</p>

  <p>"Where are your rooms in the Embassy?"</p>

  <p>"On the third floor."</p>

  <p>"Anybody else near you?"</p>

  <p>"Sir Henry's private secretaries&mdash;Dick Colquhoun and a fellow named
  Harris."</p>

  <p>Dick was an old school fellow. I passed him by without a thought.</p>

  <p>"Harris, "I repeated thoughtfully. "Is he by any chance a connection of
  the Foreign Secretary's?"</p>

  <p>Reggie nodded.</p>

  <p>"Nephew."</p>

  <p>"Are you on friendly terms with him?"</p>

  <p>"Not particularly. He is not a sociable fellow. He was away on a week's
  leave, shooting somewhere."</p>

  <p>"When was he expected back?" I asked. "The day I left."</p>

  <p>"There was no one else who had rooms upon the third floor?"</p>

  <p>"No one."</p>

  <p>"Had you any difficulty in hearing about Shalders at the Marianburg
  railway station?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"He did not seem to take any particular pains about concealing his
  identity?"</p>

  <p>"None at all. I traced him as far as Paris easily. He took a sleeping
  berth in his own name."</p>

  <p>"He travelled first-class, then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And at Paris?"</p>

  <p>"I lost him. I was only one train behind, and I believe that I reached
  London first."</p>

  <p>"You think that he stayed over in Paris?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"He took his ticket for London?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You have had no recent unpleasantness with Shalders? Your behaviour has
  been such that he would presumably consider you a good master?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it."</p>

  <p>"Then what possible motive, Reggie, could he have had in stealing those
  letters?"</p>

  <p>"You might as well ask me," Reggie cried in despair," how he could
  possibly have opened the safe. All I know is that he has bolted and the
  letters are gone."</p>

  <p>"Can you think of any one," I asked, "to whom those letters would have
  been specially valuable?"</p>

  <p>"No one&mdash;except an enemy."</p>

  <p>"And has she an enemy that you or she knows of?"</p>

  <p>"Not one."</p>

  <p>"Then we must conclude that they have been stolen for blackmail."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so."</p>

  <p>"And this is utterly unlike anything you would ever have expected from
  Shalders?"</p>

  <p>"Utterly."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen her since, Reggie?"</p>

  <p>He covered his face with his hands.</p>

  <p>"For one moment&mdash;one horrible moment!"</p>

  <p>"You have warned her?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Is she taking any steps?"</p>

  <p>"She has interest with the secret police. They are following Shalders.
  Marie Lichenstein is their agent."</p>

  <p>"Can you communicate with her, or some one absolutely trustworthy in
  Marianburg?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have had two or three telegrams already."</p>

  <p>"Any news?"</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>"Sit down and write out a telegram."</p>

  <p>He obeyed without a word. I placed pen and ink and forms before him.</p>

  <p>"Say, 'Is Harris at Embassy?'"</p>

  <p>"Harris, "he repeated. "What has he to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind, Reggie. You send the telegram. An affair like this is mostly
  guess-work. There is no harm in asking the question, anyhow."</p>

  <p>Reggie thought for a moment, turned it into cipher and wrote it slowly
  out.</p>

  <p>"Now go and despatch that yourself," I said. "The walk will do you
  good."</p>

  <p>He rose wearily.</p>

  <p>"I don't see any object in sending this, "he said. "It is ridiculous to
  think of Harris in connection with the affair. He wasn't even there. Shalders
  took the letters! There is no doubt about that. What we want to do," he
  concluded, with a feverish little burst, "is to find Shalders."</p>

  <p>"Send it any way," I answered. "Promise that you will send it."</p>

  <p>He nodded listlessly.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I'll send it," he said. "I've told you that it's no good, that's
  all."</p>

  <p>"Do you know if Shalders has any friends in London?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"He told me once that he had a brother, a hall-porter at the Geranium
  Club."</p>

  <p>"Why not go on there and see if he has heard anything of him? You might
  find out his other relations, and they could be all watched."</p>

  <p>"There is more sense in that," he muttered. "At least, it will be
  something to do!"</p>

  <p>He left the room. I spent the morning reading a file of <i>The Times</i>
  for the last six months. Gradually I became more and more interested. I began
  to see the glimmerings of a clue. I was interrupted only a few minutes before
  luncheon-time by Groves announcing a visitor.</p>

  <p>I looked up from my papers.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" I asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman, my lord," Groves announced. "He declines to give his name,
  but he has a large box and a note which he says that he must give into your
  own hands."</p>

  <p>"Show him in," I directed.</p>

  <p>A man was ushered in, tall and by no means ill-looking, with a thin black
  moustache, steel-grey eyes and somewhat foreign appearance. He was carefully,
  in fact, irreproachably, dressed, with a single exception&mdash;he wore a
  brilliantly red tie, which seemed a little out of place with the rest of his
  toilet.</p>

  <p>He bowed and regarded me keenly.</p>

  <p>"The Earl of Cravon, I believe?"</p>

  <p>I admitted the fact. He produced a note and handed it to me without
  further speech. It was addressed to me in a delicate, feminine handwriting,
  and a faint, familiar perfume assailed me directly I touched the seal. It was
  undated and the notepaper was quite plain.</p>

  <p class="letter">My dear Friend,&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">Necessity, or rather your brother's necessity, compels me
  to ask what will seem strange to you. Yet do as I send you word, and later I
  will explain. The bearer of this has a box. Let it be placed in an empty
  bedroom of your house, unknown, if it be possible, to any save your own
  confidential servant. Further, send me by him a latch-key of your house, and
  do not you yourself retire for the night until you see or hear from me. You
  will think that I am asking you strange things. No matter. All that I can I
  will explain to you very soon; and for the rest&mdash; well, it is for your
  brother, you know. Is it not?</p>

  <p class="letter">Do not hesitate to do exactly what I ask. Very much depends
  upon it. As yet I cannot send you any news, but very soon our effort will be
  made, and you will know with what success.</p>

  <p class="letter">Farewell, Milord Cravon. It is for a very short time.</p>

  <p class="letter">Marie.</p>

  <p>I looked from the note to the messenger.</p>

  <p>"Where is&mdash;Miss Lichenstein?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He spread out his hands.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you, sir," he said. "It is better for you not to know. Will
  you give me the key? The box of which she has made mention is in your
  hall."</p>

  <p>I went out and looked at it. It was an ordinary lady's dress-basket.
  Groves was examining it from a little distance, with his hands behind his
  back and a curious expression upon his face.</p>

  <p>"Have this box taken into the guest-chamber upon the first floor, Groves,"
  I directed. He bowed and hurried away. I returned to the library.</p>

  <p>"Here is the key," I said to the man who awaited me, taking my own
  latch-key from my watch-chain</p>

  <p>"I will do what Miss Lichenstein has asked."</p>

  <p>He accepted it with a bow.</p>

  <p>"You will not regret it," he answered quietly. "By this time to-morrow I
  trust that we may report ourselves successful."</p>

  <p>"You are from Marianburg?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He took up his hat.</p>

  <p>"I see no reason for concealing the fact, Lord Cravon, that I am of the
  Marianburg secret police. This affair has been placed wholly in my hands. You
  will forgive me now if I hurry away."</p>

  <p>I watched him step from the pavement into a small, handsome brougham and
  drive rapidly away. Then I hastened to change my own clothes and order a
  carriage.</p>

  <p>I drove first to the house of Sir Charles Wimpole, a somewhat intimate
  friend of mine, who had a seat in the House of Commons and held a minor post
  in the Foreign Office. I found Wimpole Lodge, however, in the hands of the
  whitewashers and decorators. Sir Charles, I was told, was staying for a week
  or so at the Hotel Maurice. A few minutes later I drove into the splendid
  courtyard of the hotel and made inquiries at the bureau.</p>

  <p>Sir Charles, I was told, had gone out only a few minutes before, but he
  was expected back in a quarter of an hour. I lit a cigarette and subsided
  into one of the luxurious lounges in the hall. I wanted particularly some
  information which Sir Charles would be able to give me, so I decided to
  wait.</p>

  <p>I had been there scarcely a minute when the rustling of a dress across the
  marble floor induced me to raise my eyes from the paper which I had picked
  up. To my amazement, it was Marie Lichenstein. She was charmingly dressed in
  a Parisian <i>toilette</i> of red and black, and a poodle, shaved in the
  latest fashion and wearing a jewelled collar, trotted behind her. I rose to
  my feet, hat in hand, and stepped forward. To my blank astonishment, she met
  my eyes with a stony stare of non-recognition. I muttered her name&mdash;she
  turned coldly away.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur has mistaken me," she said. "I have not the honour of his
  acquaintance."</p>

  <p>She retreated to the further end of the hall and sat down in an easy
  chair, with the dog by her side. I resumed my seat, and looked sharply round
  to see if any one had witnessed my discomfiture. I fancied that the
  head-porter, who had suddenly averted his head, was indulging in a faint
  smile; I was sure that a man, whom I had not previously noticed, and who was
  sitting in a dark corner by the cigar stall, was laughing softly to himself.
  I looked at him more closely. Something about the man's mouth seemed
  familiar. I leaned forward and saw him distinctly. It was the messenger whom
  Marie Lichenstein had sent to me scarcely an hour ago.</p>

  <p>I threw my cigarette away and walked down to the cigar stall. I made some
  trifling purchases, glancing every now and then at the man, who was barely a
  couple of yards away. He neither avoided my notice nor courted it, but there
  was not the faintest gleam of recognition in his face. I purposely tendered a
  banknote to the girl in charge of the cigar stall. She left to get change,
  and I spoke softly to the man.</p>

  <p>"We meet again very soon," I remarked.</p>

  <p>He looked up at me with a bland but unintelligent smile.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur is, I think, mistaken," he said. "I have not the pleasure of his
  acquaintance."</p>

  <p>I muttered something which was scarcely polite, and returned to my seat. I
  felt that I was being drawn into some sort of a conspiracy. The man and the
  woman sat at opposite corners of the hall, and not even a glance passed
  between them. They did not know one another&mdash;they did not know me. Both
  had assumed with perfect naturalness the listless attitude of people passing
  away an hour of boredom. All the same I began to realize that they were
  waiting for some one. Every time the swing-doors were opened by the
  hall-porter, who stood like a machine at his post, the man looked up. There
  was no anxiety or nervousness in that slight, sidelong glance. It was to all
  appearance nothing more than the ordinary curiosity of the casual
  hotel-lounger. Only I, who was watching very closely indeed, could see every
  now and then faint signs of impatience underneath his insouciance.</p>

  <p>I lit a fresh cigarette and waited. They were watching for some one! Was
  that some one the man who had planned and carried out this strange
  robbery?</p>

  <p>I too began to scrutinize the little stream of people who were passing in
  and out. So far as I could see, they were the usual cosmopolitan throng who
  patronize such hotels as the Maurice. The majority were Americans, plainly
  dressed and carrying satchels with an occasional Baedeker. Every now and then
  a Frenchwoman, like a brilliant butterfly, came flitting in, and the gay
  chatter of voices, introductions and leave-takings filled the air. It was
  just when the hall seemed fullest that the door swung back and a man entered
  with a rug upon his arm, followed by one of the outside porters carrying a
  portmanteau. I glanced over at the face of the watcher by the cigar stall,
  and felt a sudden thrill of excitement. A look had flashed across from the
  man to the woman, and I intercepted it. I knew at once what it meant&mdash;
  this was the man!</p>

  <p>The new-comer passed within a few feet of me, and I was able to observe
  him closely. He appeared to be from thirty to thirty-five years old, he was
  of medium height, sallow and thin. He was dressed in a blue serge suit of
  foreign cut, and he wore a black bowler-hat, which would have been the better
  for a good brushing. As he passed from the door to the hotel office, he
  looked quickly and furtively around at the loungers in the hall, and seemed
  relieved to recognize no familiar face.</p>

  <p>He disappeared into the bureau, and almost immediately afterwards Marie
  Lichenstein rose from her corner and came quietly down the hall until she
  reached the space between the bureau and the lifts. She paused here and
  exchanged a few words with one of the hotel pages. As she dismissed the boy,
  the new-comer issued from the hotel office, and raising her eyes, they fell,
  as if by accident, upon him.</p>

  <p>I know what I should have felt if a woman as beautiful as Marie
  Lichenstein had looked at me in like manner. She must have been a consummate
  actress. At first her glance denoted nothing but curiosity, in a second or
  two it had softened into interest, then she passed on with a faint, but
  bewitching, smile at the corners of her lips. The newcomer hesitated
  awkwardly for a moment. Then he handed his rug to the porter who was carrying
  his bag.</p>

  <p>"You can take them into my room," I heard him say. "I shall be there in a
  few minutes."</p>

  <p>The servant withdrew; the new-comer glanced after Marie Lichenstein. She
  had swung down the hall with slow graceful movements, and was looking idly
  into the restaurant. The man followed her as far as the cigar stall, where he
  made some trifling purchase. As he stood there the woman passed slowly back
  again. He turned and looked at her more boldly. This time her eyes fell
  quickly before his, but that wonderful smile quivered once more upon her
  lips. She walked on towards the lift and entered&mdash;the man followed her.
  It seemed to me that as they swung up out of sight I saw him bend down
  towards her!</p>

  <p>When they had gone I drew a little breath and glanced down towards my
  fellow-watcher. He was lighting a cigarette and smiling softly to himself. In
  a few moments he rose and, drawing on his gloves, passed out of the hotel. I
  heard the whistle which summoned a private carriage and the sound of wheels
  driving away. It had all happened so quickly that it was hard to realize
  anything. Only I looked at the two empty seats, and I think I understood that
  the curtain had rung up upon the first act of the little drama of which I had
  unwittingly become the sole audience.</p>

  <p>In a moment or two I rose and entered the office. I had intended to take a
  room, in order to see for myself under what name this latest comer to the
  hotel had registered. But as it happened this was not necessary. The office
  was crowded, and the visitors' book lay open before me. The last name was
  written boldly enough&mdash;the ink, indeed, was not yet dry. I read it over
  slowly to myself. It was quite unfamiliar:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">Maxime De Carteret,<br>
  Buda Pesth.<br>
  No. 357.</p>

  <p>I turned away and came face to face with Wimpole. He greeted me with some
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here, Cravon?" he asked. "I thought you hated these
  huge hotels."</p>

  <p>"I came to see you," I answered. "Are you busy, or can you spare me half
  an hour?"</p>

  <p>"I'm off to the House presently," he said. "We'll have a cigarette first,
  if you like; and then, if you've nothing better to do, you might give me a
  lift down. I saw your carriage outside." We sat down on one of the
  lounges.</p>

  <p>"I have come to beg for some political information, Wimpole," I said.</p>

  <p>He looked at me with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm very much flattered," he said. "Are you going to speak on the
  Zanzibar question, then?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"No. I'm not going to speak at all&mdash;at least, I do not want the
  information for political purposes. Nor has it anything to do with
  Zanzibar."</p>

  <p>"China?"</p>

  <p>"Much nearer home."</p>

  <p>"Europe?"</p>

  <p>I was silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"You remember Reggie&mdash;my younger brother?"</p>

  <p>"Quite well," he answered. "He came to Eton the year I left, and he
  followed me to Magdalen. Nice boy, but I haven't seen him for years."</p>

  <p>"He has been at Marianburg," I continued, "and I am sorry to say that he
  has got into a scrape there. It's a very mysterious and complicated business,
  but I'd give a good deal to help him out of it."</p>

  <p>"At Marianburg!" Wimpole whistled softly to himself and began to look more
  interested.</p>

  <p>"I daresay you know," he said,"that matters politically are looking very
  queer there just now?"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing," I answered, "except what I have gathered from <i>The
  Times</i>. It seems to me that there is something in the background there,
  and I have a sort of theory that Reggie has got drawn into it."</p>

  <p>Wimpole looked around him.</p>

  <p>"Marianburg," he said, "is giving us just now a great deal of trouble.
  This is scarcely the place to talk of it, but if you will drive me down to
  the House we can talk as we go."</p>

  <p>We both rose. At that moment the lift doors opposite to us were opened,
  and Marie Lichenstein stepped out, dressed for walking and followed by the
  man in the blue serge suit. She passed me with unseeing eyes and perfect
  unconsciousness, chatting all the while gaily to her companion. Wimpole
  looked after her admiringly.</p>

  <p>"What a handsome woman, Cravon!"</p>

  <p>I smiled. We all four stood on the steps together, and a porter, who had
  recognized me, called for my carriage. I saw Marie's companion turn round as
  though he were shot. Wimpole looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"The fellow with her seemed to recognize your name," he remarked.</p>

  <p>I nodded, but took care not to advance towards him. The hansom arrived
  first, and I heard their destination</p>

  <p>"Charbonell's, Bond Street."</p>

  <p>They drove off. I stepped into my brougham, which followed up. On the
  other side of the court-yard a man was strolling up and down. It was the
  messenger whom Marie had sent to me&mdash;the man with the red tie.</p>

  <p>*****</p>

  <p>There followed for me an evening of inaction during which I thought a good
  deal and smoked too much. Reggie had not returned, nor was there any message
  from him. About eight o'clock a telegram arrived from Marianburg, but,
  although I opened it without hesitation and with considerable interest, it
  was in cipher and unintelligible to me. After that the hours passed away very
  slowly. At twelve o'clock I fell asleep; at one I awoke with a sudden start
  and a chill consciousness that I was not alone. I sat up in my chair. At
  first I thought that I must still be dreaming. The woman who stood before me
  with uplifted and warning finger was dressed in the fashion of another age.
  Her hair and cheeks were powdered, diamonds flashed from her shoe buckles,
  her corsage, from the velvet which bound her hair. Her dress of green satin
  was strangely cut and looped up on one side to display a gorgeous petticoat.
  She held a fan in her left hand, and her fingers were ablaze with rings.</p>

  <p>"Milord Cravon!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>I knew her then, as indeed I might have done from the first, for her eyes
  and mouth were eloquent enough and her face was not one to be easily
  disguised.</p>

  <p>"Marie Lichenstein!" I cried. "Why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted me.</p>

  <p>"I have been to your Covent Garden Ball," she said. "Give me some wine
  quickly."</p>

  <p>I had some at hand and poured her out a glass. The hand which took it from
  me was shaking like an aspen leaf. I looked at her more closely, and I saw
  that she was a sorry masquerader. There was a pallor upon her cheeks more
  real than the delicate blanching of the powder, and a fear in her eyes which
  was like the fear of death. Behind her, across a chair, had fallen a black
  opera cloak and a domino. She stood there in her brilliant dress a strange,
  wan picture.</p>

  <p>I gave her more wine. She drank it eagerly and sank down in my easy chair.
  I took her hand and held it in mine. It was as cold as ice.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," she murmured, "that I am losing my nerve. Yet I never
  thought that it would end like this."</p>

  <p>"Something&mdash;has happened?"</p>

  <p>"A great deal has happened," she declared, "much that I would were undone.
  Milord Cravon, we have failed!"</p>

  <p>My heart sank. Yet from the moment when I had recognized her I had felt
  sure of it. She was like a woman wholly unnerved by a great shock, and with
  it all I knew that she was not a woman to be lightly brought into such a
  state.</p>

  <p>"He was&mdash;not the man then?"</p>

  <p>"Of that I am not sure," she answered; "but it is very certain that he has
  not the letters. If he is the man who stole them, and of that Meyer is
  certain, then he has already made his bargain and parted with them. We were
  too late. We have run a great risk for no purpose"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry&mdash;for your sake as well as Reggie's," I murmured.</p>

  <p>"My friend," she said, looking at me with eyes which seemed suddenly very
  dim and soft, "by this time to-morrow you will not be sorry for me any
  longer! At the sound of my name you will shudder, at the thought of me you
  will shrink as one shrinks from a poisonous thing! But after all&mdash;what
  matters?" she added, with a hysterical little laugh. "I have but one thing to
  think of now, and that is to get away. Milord Cravon, have you servants whom
  you can trust?"</p>

  <p>"Implicitly," I assured her.</p>

  <p>"I need a carriage," she said.</p>

  <p>"My night cab is ready," I answered. "I have only to touch a bell. The
  horse is already harnessed"</p>

  <p>"And my box?"</p>

  <p>I motioned her to follow me, and showed her the room where it had been
  placed.</p>

  <p>"The cab&mdash;in five minutes," she said, as I turned to go; "I shall not
  be longer."</p>

  <p>She kept her word literally. I was prepared for some sort of
  transformation, but scarcely for anything so complete. She glided into my
  study before the five minutes were up, a slim, sad figure in the sorrowful
  garb of a sister of mercy. From the rough, black gown which fell upon her
  ill-shaped shoes to the gold chain about her neck, the metamorphosis was
  absolute and complete. I gasped for breath as I looked at her.</p>

  <p>"I have left you but one thing to do, Milord Cravon," she said. "The opera
  cloak and domino there&mdash;will you put them in the box which I have left
  upstairs? Keep that box in a safe place until you have an opportunity of
  destroying it, and every trace of Marie Lichenstein has vanished."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;where are you going?" I cried.</p>

  <p>"To a convent at Highgate. I have letters from a sister at Brussels. When
  your door closes behind me, I am as safe as though. I were a thousand miles
  away. Everything has been perfectly arranged, and I am expected to-night. Is
  the carriage here?"</p>

  <p>"It is waiting," I answered. "Do you mean, then, that we shall not meet
  again?"</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"It is a small world," she said softly.</p>

  <p>"And Highgate," I suggested, "is a small suburb."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not there," she said decidedly. "Whatever you do, do not come there, or
  make any inquiries. You promise?"</p>

  <p>"Faithfully."</p>

  <p>She sighed once more. I found myself holding her hand. Her dark eyes
  looked sorrowfully into mine.</p>

  <p>"After all," she said, "it is true what I have told you. By this time
  to-morrow you will loathe me. If my hand lay within yours&mdash;as
  now&mdash;you would cast it away."</p>

  <p>"I can assure you," I said earnestly, and raising it a little towards my
  lips, "that I should do nothing of the sort. I should do precisely what I am
  going to do now."</p>

  <p>The little white fingers were as cold as ice. She drew them gently away
  and I walked with her to the door. With my hand upon the latch I paused.
  There was something I wanted to say to her, but she gave me no opportunity.
  With a sudden impulsive movement, she threw the door open herself, ran down
  the steps and vanished into the carriage. She did not look round nor say a
  word of farewell, but as she crossed the pavement I heard something which
  sounded like a sob break from her lips.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was on my plate when I came down to breakfast. I saw it
  there when I entered the room, neatly cut and folded, by the side of a little
  pile of letters. How I hated the sight of it, hated the thought of touching,
  of opening it! <i>The Morning Post</i> is not a paper given over to
  sensationalism. I knew that whatever had occurred would be temperately and
  truthfully chronicled; yet none the less I shrank with positive dread from
  opening those innocent pages. Nor were my apprehensions ill founded. When at
  last I summoned up courage to take the paper into my hands, my worst fears
  were instantly confirmed. At the head of a column, in thick black type, it
  stared me in the face:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="headline">TERRIBLE MURDER AT THE HOTEL MAURICE!</p>

  <p>For a moment I was incapable of reading. I was dizzy and everything swam
  before my eyes. Then I pulled myself together. I gripped the paper with both
  hands and read with fierce eagerness every line.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Early this morning the body of a gentleman, a visitor
  at the Hotel Maurice, was discovered in his room under circumstances which
  leave little room for doubt as to the manner of his death. We are at present
  without full particulars of the tragedy, but such information as we have
  makes it perfectly clear that a brutal murder has been committed. The
  deceased was found stabbed to the heart with a long, thin dagger of foreign
  make. He had only arrived at the hotel during the afternoon, and had
  registered under the name of Maxime De Carteret.<br></p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Later. Further particulars are to hand with reference
  to the murder early this morning at the Hotel Maurice. The deceased was seen
  talking during the afternoon to a lady visitor at the hotel, who had herself
  only just arrived, and who had registered under the name of Lichenstein. The
  two were apparently on the most cordial terms and dined together in the
  restaurant, and subsequently left the hotel together for the Covent Garden
  Ball. They returned quite early, and went up in the lift to their respective
  rooms, which were in the same wing and on the same floor of the hotel. They
  were accompanied by a third person, who had also arrived during the day, and
  registered under the name of Jules Van Drooden, of Brussels. The three were
  last seen together talking on the landing outside their rooms, but about half
  an hour later the lady, still in her fancy dress, rang for the lift and
  descended to the ground floor. She asked the hall-porter to call her
  carriage, remarking that the gentleman with whom she had been to the ball had
  been taken ill, and she had been compelled to return with him, but as she had
  friends there, she was going back for an hour or two. She drove off, and up
  to the hour of going to press had not returned to the hotel. We understand
  also that Mr. Van Drooden, who, together with the lady, was last seen with
  the murdered man, has disappeared.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"On inquiry early this morning our representative
  learned that, although the clothes and belongings of the deceased had
  apparently been searched through, his money, jewellery and papers were
  untouched. On reference to the latter, it has been ascertained that his real
  name is Shalders, and that he was a valet in the service of the Hon. Reginald
  Lessingham, who is attached to the Embassy at Marianburg."<br></p>

  <p>The paper slipped from my fingers. It was as bad as&mdash;even worse than
  I had feared. It was a horrible and unpardonable deed; not only that, but it
  was an ineffective one. If he had ever had the letters, he must have parted
  with them. Whatever his motive for the robbery might have been, he had met
  with a terrible retribution.</p>

  <p>The door opened and Reggie walked in, followed by a servant with the
  breakfast. In the clearer daylight I was shocked to see how great a change
  the anxiety of the last few days had wrought in him. His eyes were set in
  deep hollows, his cheeks were thin and haggard. However it all might end, he
  would carry the marks of agony with him to the grave.</p>

  <p>"Reggie," I said, "there is something here which I want you to read."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand. I gave him the paper.</p>

  <p>"Read it carefully," I said, "and tell me what you think of it."</p>

  <p>He devoured it with a sort of fierce joy, mingled with amazement. His eyes
  glittered with an unnatural light. I saw that I must keep him going as much
  as possible. Action of some sort was absolutely necessary for him. He was on
  the verge of madness.</p>

  <p>"Very good! very good!" he exclaimed. "It is the man who robbed me whom
  they have killed. Very good! It is magnificent! Dead, is he? I am glad!"</p>

  <p>"You must remember, Reggie," I said, "that this may be a very just
  retribution, but it scarcely looks as though it were going to help you. Let
  me tell you this. I have seen Marie Lichenstein since. He had not the
  letters. It seems as though he had parted with them."</p>

  <p>"Vengeance is something," Reggie muttered; but he was white once more to
  the lips and his voice faltered.</p>

  <p>"There were two telegrams for you," I remarked with a sudden thought.
  "Have you had them?"</p>

  <p>"No! Give them to me!" he cried.</p>

  <p>I fetched them myself from the library. He tore them open. As he read his
  expression changed into one of blank bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"Listen to this!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"'Your servant, Shalders, discovered yesterday in the attic at Embassy,
  gagged and chloroformed. Was attacked in your room on Sunday evening. Cannot
  identify assailant. Very weak and exhausted, but will probably recover.'"</p>

  <p>Reggie looked piteously at me, holding one hand to his forehead.</p>

  <p>"What in God's name does it mean?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Open the other telegram," I answered.</p>

  <p>He held it out.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing in it," he declared. "It is only about Harris. He has
  been back, but applied for extension of leave, and left again. Damn
  Harris!"</p>

  <p>"There have been wishes," I murmured softly, "whose accomplishment has
  been more distant."</p>

  <p>I declined to discuss the matter further until after breakfast, although,
  so far as my brother was concerned, the meal was little better than a farce.
  He made a pretence of eating, but all the time his eyes were following me. It
  was pitiful to watch him.</p>

  <p>"Reggie," I said at last, filling my pipe, "in the first place, are you
  completely satisfied that your telegrams from Marianburg are to be relied
  upon?"</p>

  <p>"They are unimpeachable," he answered. "I would answer for their
  truthfulness with my life."</p>

  <p>"In that case," I said, "this means work for you, Reggie. If Shalders is
  really in Marianburg, we must find out who it was who robbed you and has paid
  the penalty."</p>

  <p>He sprang up at once.</p>

  <p>"I am ready!" he cried. "What shall I do?"</p>

  <p>"Go to the Hotel Maurice," I said, "give your card and ask to be allowed
  to identify your servant. If it is Shalders&mdash;well, some one from
  Marianburg must be sending you false information. If it is not Shalders, say
  nothing at all. Be very careful that you show no surprise."</p>

  <p>Reggie went out, and I heard Groves whistle a hansom up for him. I lit a
  pipe and studied carefully for some time certain numbers of <i>The Times</i>
  which I had sorted out from the pile. Just as I began to see a glimmering of
  light, Groves drew back the curtains which divided my rooms and announced a
  visitor.</p>

  <p>"It is a lady to see you, my lord," he announced. "She says that her
  business is urgent and important."</p>

  <p>"Her name?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"She says that you would not know it, but that she must see you at once.
  She inquired first of all if Mr. Reginald were here."</p>

  <p>"You can show her in, Groves," I directed.</p>

  <p>A woman swept into the room almost as I was speaking, waving my servant
  away with an imperious gesture. She was plainly dressed in black and closely
  veiled. I could only see that she was young, and that she carried herself
  with the ease and grace of a beautiful woman. I rose to my feet.</p>

  <p>"You are Lord Cravon?" she said quietly. "Will you send your servant away?
  I wish for a few minutes' conversation with you."</p>

  <p>I looked at Groves and he withdrew at once.</p>

  <p>She waited until the door was closed, and then she raised her veil.</p>

  <p>"You do not know me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>I shook my head. She was certainly a very beautiful woman, and of a rare
  type. Her hair was red gold and her eyes and eyebrows dark. Her features were
  delicately cut, and of patrician type; she carried herself in such a manner
  that my rooms seemed the smaller for her presence. Suddenly a very brilliant
  smile parted her lips, and at the same time I realized that her face was
  perfectly familiar to me! Where had I seen it?</p>

  <p>"You are not like your brother," she said.</p>

  <p>A vague uneasiness crept over me.</p>

  <p>"You came&mdash;to see him?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. Her face hardened a little.</p>

  <p>"I do not wish to see your brother ever again in my life," she said. "He
  has broken a promise to me."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you are not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"That will do," she said. "I come from Marianburg."</p>

  <p>I bowed low, but I was overwhelmed with embarrassment and dismay.</p>

  <p>"Your welcome is scarcely flattering," she remarked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Madam," I answered, "I fear that your presence is a token that the worst
  has happened."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," she answered me, "nothing has happened at all. It was
  the waiting for news which wearied me so. I had arranged for an
  <i>incognito</i> visit to Paris, and I came over here by the night boat. Tell
  me, what news have you?"</p>

  <p>I showed her the telegrams, and I told her of Marie Lichenstein and the
  murder at the Hotel Maurice. She listened without emotion or interruption of
  any sort. When I had finished, she was silent for several minutes.</p>

  <p>"If your brother's servant was not the thief," she said at length, "I
  shall be inclined to believe that this is a political plot."</p>

  <p>"Your majesty," I answered, "should be the best judge of that. It is hard
  to believe that there are people who would do you a wanton injury."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I have enemies enough, no doubt," she remarked lightly. "The pity of
  it is that a woman in my position is never conscious of them."</p>

  <p>"Is there any reason," I asked respectfully, "why you should have
  political enemies?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>She seemed indisposed to say more. I glanced towards the pile of papers at
  my side.</p>

  <p>"I have been trying," I said, "to understand the politics of your
  country."</p>

  <p>She glanced at them with contempt.</p>

  <p>"Tear them up," she said; "they will not help you."</p>

  <p>"They have given me an idea," I ventured to say.</p>

  <p>"When," she asked, with apparent irrelevance, "shall you know who this
  unfortunate man at the Hotel Maurice was?"</p>

  <p>"In less than half an hour," I replied. "Reginald has gone there now."</p>

  <p>"I shall wait to know," she said; "but I do not want to see your brother,
  or to have him know that I am in England."</p>

  <p>"It would certainly be wiser," I agreed.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It is not," she said, "a question of wisdom. Your brother is a foolish
  boy, and he has disobeyed me. I shall not forgive him."</p>

  <p>"He is terribly distressed," I ventured to say.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Do not think," I continued, "that I wish to defend him; but his motive
  for keeping those letters was, at least, excusable."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders, and looked at me with a smile; but there was
  no tenderness in her face.</p>

  <p>"Such sentiment!" she exclaimed mockingly. "Yet, perhaps, if I cared for
  him still, it might mean something to me. But that is all over. He has grown
  too dismal, he does not amuse me. And, my friend," she continued, leaning her
  head upon her shapely fingers, "Marianburg is very dull. It is very
  respectable, but it is exceedingly dull."</p>

  <p>"I have always understood," I murmured, "that your majesty's court was a
  brilliant one."</p>

  <p>She yawned.</p>

  <p>"If I return to Marianburg," she said, "you shall come and judge for
  yourself. I will introduce you to the most beautiful women in my country. To
  look at they are adorable, but for wit, for conversation&mdash;well, you will
  find them nothing but statues. My court reminds me of a wonderful automatic
  model I once saw. You drop a penny somewhere, behind, and little waxen
  figures come out and promenade, exchange stiff curtsies and wooden speeches,
  and bow one by one before their king and queen, whose hands go up and down
  with the regularity of clockwork. There are times," she continued, speaking
  in a lower key, "when I have prayed for something of this sort to happen. If
  it were not for the scandal&mdash;well, I should fear nothing."</p>

  <p>"It is the scandal, madame," I said, "which we must prevent. My brother
  would break his heart if you should suffer through his weakness and
  indiscretion."</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows and smiled at me.</p>

  <p>"And you?"</p>

  <p>"Madam," I answered, "I would ask for no greater happiness than to serve
  you."</p>

  <p>I could not keep the admiration from my face and tone, for she was very
  beautiful and very gracious. She looked away with the smile still lingering
  upon her lips.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she said, "what news I am most anxious to hear? If those
  letters are in the hands of enemies, if they are to be given to my husband?
  well, I shall be a free woman."</p>

  <p>"Your freedom," I said, "would be bought at a great price."</p>

  <p>She looked at me earnestly.</p>

  <p>"My friend," she said, "there is but one life; and if you believe that to
  be a queen is to be a happy woman, let me tell you that you are very
  ignorant. Let me tell you this&mdash;royalty is the nearest approach to
  slavery which this century permits. I have felt, oh, many and many a time,
  that for one hour of real life I would give the rest of my days!"</p>

  <p>"Your majesty," I said respectfully, "the price is too great."</p>

  <p>She bowed her head.</p>

  <p>"What is&mdash;is," she murmured. "I shall be none the worse woman if
  Europe has this story thrown to her scandal-mongers. Really," she continued,
  with a soft laugh, "it would be amusing. There have been princesses before
  who have&mdash;well, become independent, but a queen&mdash;never! Imagine the
  sensation! The music-halls would bid record prices for me, and great managers
  would discover that I was a genius, and they would beg me to go on the stage.
  I"</p>

  <p>"Your majesty "I protested.</p>

  <p>She threw me a swift, sweet glance.</p>

  <p>"My friend," she said, "forgive me. You are right. Believe me, if I ever
  did gain my freedom, my feet would never tread any stage, nor should I ever
  occupy the throne of the demi-monde. Would you like me to tell you what I
  should do?"</p>

  <p>"Very much," I answered truthfully.</p>

  <p>"I should desire," she said softly, "to disguise myself in some way, so
  that no one who had known me as I am to-day would recognize me in my new
  life. I would be perfectly free, and I would have a studio in Paris, so that
  I might paint when I was in the humour for it; a yacht always ready, so that
  I might sail when I chose; a cottage in Devonshire, that I might enjoy Nature
  when I was in the mood; and friends who cared enough for me to come when I
  summoned them, and leave when I desired it. Ah! when I dream of this, half
  the dread of the present vanishes."</p>

  <p>I rose suddenly to my feet. I had heard a hansom stop at the door.</p>

  <p>"It is my brother, madam," I exclaimed. "If you still desire not to meet
  him, will you come this way?"</p>

  <p>She followed me across the hall and into my drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"My presence, I trust, does not inconvenience you, Lord Cravon?" she said.
  "You are, I believe, a bachelor?"</p>

  <p>"Your majesty's presence would be an honour in any case," I answered, "and
  a pleasure. I have the happiness to be unmarried."</p>

  <p>She smiled, and sank into an easy chair.</p>

  <p>"You will bring me the news?" she said.</p>

  <p>"In a very few moments," I answered. "Your majesty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She checked me.</p>

  <p>"I am Valerie Nevenstein for to-day, if you please," she begged. "If
  to-morrow I become a queen again, you will call me what you will." I
  bowed.</p>

  <p>"I am not a courtier," I admitted, "and, with your gracious permission,
  Mademoiselle Nevenstein will come more easily to me."</p>

  <p>"Valerie Nevenstein," she reminded me.</p>

  <p>"It is a long name," I said thoughtfully. She looked up at me and laughed.
  At that moment I realized that she was really only a girl.</p>

  <p>"If you should find it too long," she said softly, "you may choose which
  half you will."</p>

  <p>Reggie's voice was in the hall. I was forced to go.</p>

  <p>"There is no name in the world I like so well as &mdash;Valerie," I said,
  with my hand upon the door.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said, smilingly dismissing me; "you have chosen."</p>

  <p>I found Reggie, as I had expected, in a state of great excitement. He was
  walking up and down the room when I entered, muttering to himself. He stopped
  short at once, trembling all over.</p>

  <p>"I believe you knew!" he cried. "You knew who it was!"</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was Harris, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Reggie sank back into a chair.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was Harris," he declared with a little shudder. "They sent me to
  Charing Cross Hospital &mdash;he had been moved there."</p>

  <p>"You did not tell them who he was?"</p>

  <p>"No. I simply said that it was not Shalders. Do you suppose that it was
  Harris whom I followed to England&mdash;Harris who stole the letters?"</p>

  <p>"I never had the least doubt about it," I answered. "The shooting party
  was a myth. He came back with or without an accomplice, opened the safe with
  the Embassy keys, or with a false one, which he could easily have had made.
  He gagged and chloroformed Shalders, and when he was helpless got him somehow
  up into the attic. Then he started for England, giving the name of Shalders
  to put you off the scent. He was followed, of course, by agents of the secret
  police of Marianburg, and the end of that you know. The all-important
  question to us is, What had he done with the letters? Now I am beginning to
  be afraid that he either disposed of them or sent them somewhere through the
  post from Paris."</p>

  <p>"But for what purpose?" Reggie exclaimed. "Granted that he was blackguard
  enough to steal them, what was his object? What use could they have been to
  him?"</p>

  <p>"As to that," I answered, "I have a theory which I am going to test before
  I explain it to you. It will take me the rest of the day. How can you occupy
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I shall write&mdash;to her," he said.</p>

  <p>I laid my hand upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"If I were you, Reggie," I said, "I would employ my time more profitably.
  If you write to her, I do not think that she will read it."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he cried fiercely.</p>

  <p>"It is no use being angry," I said. "You will have to face facts. I have
  had direct communication with her since I have seen you. She will never
  forgive you!"</p>

  <p>He dropped into a chair and covered his face with his hands. He asked no
  questions. He was, I think, already convinced of her unchanging anger. I laid
  my hand upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Come," I said, a little impatiently, perhaps&mdash; almost roughly,
  "come. You did not seriously intend to drivel away your life, the
  <i>cavalière servante</i> even of a queen. You have offended, and she will
  not forgive you. In the end you will be glad of it, but for the sake of the
  past, you owe her something. Don't give way like a girl. See this matter
  through first. There is just a chance left."</p>

  <p>He sat up, pale and red-eyed, and listened to what I had to say.</p>

  <p>"I want you," I said, "to describe the packet to me as carefully as you
  can."</p>

  <p>"It is about eight inches square," he said, "quite thin, and it is tied up
  with white ribbon. The packet itself is of Japanese white silk, stained a
  good deal with crushed violets. The loose letter was just folded up and
  slipped underneath the ribbon. There is a ring inside, up in the left hand
  corner."</p>

  <p>I nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"I shall remember that," I said. "Now, Reggie, I shall be away, perhaps,
  for the rest of the day. I want you to go to the club, and wait there for me.
  I might want you at any moment, and I want to be sure of finding you."</p>

  <p>"Cannot I stay here?" he asked. "I don't want to see a lot of fellows I
  know."</p>

  <p>"No," I answered firmly. "I want you to be at the club, and to show
  yourself. I want you out of the house, Reggie, in ten minutes."</p>

  <p>"You will send for me," he begged, "as soon as you can?"</p>

  <p>"As soon as I can&mdash;I promise that," I answered. "It may be some time.
  The longer I am, the greater the chance of success. Remember that, and it
  will help to pass the time."</p>

  <p>Reggie left the house in a few minutes. Then I went back into the
  drawing-room. My visitor was still there, but she was lying upon the couch,
  and did not look up at my entrance. I walked softly up to her. Her eyes were
  closed, her head was thrown back upon the cushions&mdash;she was asleep. I
  walked softly away towards the door, but before I reached it some instinct
  prompted me to return. I stood looking over her for several minutes. After
  all, was my brother's infatuation so wonderful a thing? Even here, asleep,
  and in her travelling clothes, she was a beautiful woman. I could very well
  believe that, as the central and all-important figure of a brilliant court,
  she would be almost irresistible.</p>

  <p>She woke, and found me looking steadfastly at her. Without any trace of
  embarrassment she sat up and smiled at me.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "is there news yet?"</p>

  <p>"Of a kind," I answered, "there is news. The man who was murdered at the
  Hotel Maurice was Leonard Harris."</p>

  <p>"What, Sir Henry's secretary?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And the packet?"</p>

  <p>"There were no signs of it."</p>

  <p>"The young man, Harris," she said to herself softly. "Well, after all, it
  is the insects who are venomous."</p>

  <p>"He had cause, perhaps?" I ventured.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I was rude to him once," she interrupted. "He was a boorish young
  man, and he presumed. But if it was he who stole the packet, I do not see why
  it was not in his possession."</p>

  <p>I sat down by her side. She had moved her skirts in a manner which
  indicated her desire that I should do so.</p>

  <p>"Your majesty," I said, "I fear the natural presumption is that he had
  parted with them."</p>

  <p>"In which case," she remarked, with a look which rebuked my inadvertence,
  "they are in the hands of my enemies."</p>

  <p>"I have," I said hesitatingly, "a vague theory as to what may have become
  of them. It sounds so far-fetched, and it is in itself so improbable, that I
  would rather say nothing to you about it for the present. But, with your
  permission, I will spend the morning testing it."</p>

  <p>"You will leave me again so soon?"</p>

  <p>She certainly had wonderful eyes. I found it safer to look downwards at
  the carpet.</p>

  <p>"In your service," I murmured, "and with the utmost regret."</p>

  <p>"You will be&mdash;as quick as possible?"</p>

  <p>"You may be sure of it," I answered.</p>

  <p>"And am I to remain here until your return?"</p>

  <p>"If you will. I shall give you into the charge of my own servant, and will
  see that you are undisturbed."</p>

  <p>I rose from the sofa. She gave me both her hands.</p>

  <p>"My friend," she said earnestly, "you are very good to me! Whether I
  remain a queen or become a woman, I shall not forget it!"</p>

  <p>In less than half an hour I was riding slowly down the Row, exchanging the
  barest greetings with the people whom I knew and carefully avoiding every one
  likely to detain me. There were a great many on horseback and a crowd of
  promenaders, but for a long time my search was a fruitless one. I had almost
  arrived at the conclusion that I must try some other means when, at the
  corner, I came face to face with two girls riding slowly and followed by a
  groom. The elder one, dark and moderately handsome, but without any special
  distinction, bowed to me graciously, and, to her evident surprise, I reined
  in my horse beside her.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Miss Ogden," I exclaimed, "I was beginning to think that
  you had given up your morning rides. You were not here yesterday, were
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that," she laughed.
  "There are so many people, and you seem to know them all!"</p>

  <p>"They are a great nuisance sometimes," I remarked. "Don't you think that
  it is a great mistake to have too many friends?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "Perhaps. My sister and I are not troubled in that
  way, are we, Carrie?"</p>

  <p>The younger girl agreed, a little dolefully. I leaned over in my
  saddle.</p>

  <p>"Won't you introduce me to your sister?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Miss Ogden did so at once.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday," she remarked, "you were riding with the Countess of Appleton.
  I think that if I were a man and riding with the Countess of Appleton, I
  should not see any one else. She is very beautiful, is she not?"</p>

  <p>"She is my cousin, so I am scarcely a fair judge," I remarked, turning my
  horse. "May I come with you a little way?"</p>

  <p>She was surprised, but frankly acquiescent. I had the advantage of
  belonging to a set of which they were not members, and my offer, therefore,
  especially as my acquaintance with Miss Ogden was of the slightest, was
  obviously welcome. I had danced with her a few nights ago to oblige a worried
  hostess, and had found her a pleasant, sensible girl.</p>

  <p>She did not hesitate, as we rode slowly down under the trees, to admit
  their somewhat doubtful social position.</p>

  <p>"It is quite interesting for us to be with some one who knows everybody,"
  she remarked. "You see, this is only our second season, and until this year
  we never had a house in town. I suppose that is one reason why we know so few
  people outside the political set. Politicians may be useful creatures, but
  they are not amusing."</p>

  <p>I laughed softly. Sir James Ogden was a politician who had worked his way
  up from the ranks. He had been a provincial manufacturer, mayor of his city
  three times, and knighted for a liberal entertainment of royalty. He had gone
  into Parliament, and, with the aid of a fluent tongue and a large business
  capacity, had worked his way into office. His methods were not altogether to
  the liking of his party, and he was yet to a certain extent unproven. But, on
  the whole, his success had been remarkable.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he had married early in life, and his social prospects were
  hampered by a good-natured but uneducated wife. As usual, it was the
  daughters who suffered. London was a fascinating but unknown world to them,
  and there was no one to be their sponsor.</p>

  <p>I rode slowly down between the two girls, receiving a good many surprised
  salutations, and doing my best to make myself agreeable&mdash;a task which,
  under the circumstances, was not difficult. They fully expected, as I could
  see, that I should leave them in a minute or two; but I did nothing of the
  sort. I answered my cousin's imperious little movement of her whip with a
  bland smile and an indifferent wave of my hat, thereby offending her
  grievously, and remained with them until the people began to thin off. Then,
  as we were walking our horses and talking under the trees, a stout, red-faced
  old lady rose up from a chair and waved to us. Miss Ogden's cheek flushed,
  but she reined in her horse at once.</p>

  <p>"It is my mother," she remarked. "I quite forgot that she was looking out
  for us. I am afraid that we must go to her."</p>

  <p>"By all means," I answered cheerfully. "By the bye, I have not the
  pleasure of knowing Lady Ogden. Won't you present me?"</p>

  <p>"With pleasure," she answered readily. "Come, Carrie."</p>

  <p>We rode up to the railings, and I was formally introduced. Lady Ogden was
  flustered but good natured. As it happened, nothing could have been more
  fortunate for me than this meeting. Lady Ogden was nothing if not hospitable,
  and before we had exchanged half a dozen words I was asked to luncheon. The
  two girls exchanged glances of resigned dismay, which speedily changed to
  surprise when I at once accepted the invitation. In a few minutes we rode off
  together again with Lady Ogden's carriage close behind.</p>

  <p>I am free to confess that my behaviour that morning was the behaviour of a
  snob. Regarded from a certain point of view, it was inexcusable; yet, under
  similar circumstances, I know that I should do precisely the same again. I
  traded upon my position with the object of ingratiating myself with Lady
  Ogden and her daughters. I promised them cards for certain forthcoming events
  (a promise, by the bye, which was faithfully kept), and I was able to give
  them a good many useful hints and information with regard to their new
  position, its possibilities and obligations. I am quite sure that my luncheon
  at their house that day was regarded, both by Lady Ogden and her daughters,
  as the most important event which had happened to them since their arrival in
  London; and if to a certain extent I allowed them to be deceived as to my
  motives, I have at least made a very full atonement. The present social
  position of Lady Ogden and her family is largely owing to my efforts; and if
  Miss Louise looks a little reproachfully at me in the Park, when for several
  mornings I fail to speak to her, she is at least frankly grateful for the
  services which I have rendered them. Further, Lady Ogden can always rely upon
  me for one of her dinners; and nothing would induce me to be absent from any
  social function at her house to which I am bidden. I have been to a certain
  extent their good angel, and there are now very few houses in London which
  are not open to Lady Ogden and her daughters. Still, I fancy that none of
  them&mdash;except Sir James, who will keep his own counsel&mdash;have ever
  quite understood that morning. And beyond the fact that I have striven so
  hard to atone for my abuse of their first act of hospitality, there was my
  motive&mdash;strong enough surely to make a man unscrupulous. There was
  always before me the remembrance of my brother's white face, and the image of
  the woman who waited for my final effort. A queen to-day, tomorrow, if I
  failed, an outcast. No! I behaved like a cad, but I am only thankful for the
  inspiration which suggested this forlorn hope.</p>

  <p>Luncheon was prolonged to its utmost limits. I talked to interest Lady
  Ogden and her daughters, and I succeeded. Sir James listened with a somewhat
  forced air of attention, but on the whole I could see that my presence also
  gratified him. He professed to be too busy, to have no tastes for society;
  but it was easy to see that as an ambitious man he was annoyed and irritated
  to find himself so small a figure here, and his social pretensions ignored,
  after his provincial triumphs. Evidently he had been told to make himself
  specially agreeable to me; he did his best, but, during luncheon at least, he
  had but little opportunity. The girls were really bright and naturally
  well-bred. They talked by no means badly, and we found plenty to say.</p>

  <p>After luncheon, which was protracted as long as possible, Sir James
  proposed a cigar and cup of coffee in his room. I took my leave of the
  ladies, and followed him into the library.</p>

  <p>"I have just one hour which I can call my own," he remarked, wheeling out
  a chair for me. "As a rule it is the only idle one of my day. I am old
  fashioned enough to enjoy my luncheon more than my dinner."</p>

  <p>A servant brought liqueurs and coffee, and Sir James produced some cigars
  and cigarettes. I helped myself, and, whilst I sipped my coffee, looked
  around the room curiously. On the table was a black dispatch-box. Sir James,
  with a word of apology to me, took a bunch of keys from his pocket, and
  opened it. The match with which I was lighting my cigarette went out in my
  fingers, and my heart gave a quick beat. I was right then! A strong odour of
  crushed violets floated out into the room.</p>

  <p>Sir James looked steadily into the box for several moments, with a faint
  smile on his lips. Then he carefully pushed it a little further back upon the
  table, and, lighting a cigar, stretched himself out in an easy chair opposite
  to mine. He began to talk at once on different subjects. Without being in any
  sense of the word a politician, I had made several speeches in the House of
  Lords upon subjects interesting to me, one of which had provoked considerable
  discussion. Sir James and I, being of the same party, our conversation
  naturally drifted into political channels. A chance remark from Sir James
  very soon gave the opening I desired. As carefully as possible I led the
  conversation up to the subject of our relations with a certain foreign
  power.</p>

  <p>"If I were a genuine politician," I remarked&mdash; "that is to say, if I
  possessed the requisite ability to become one&mdash;I should be interested
  more than anything in foreign affairs. Diplomacy has always been a very
  fascinating study to me, although, of course, I have had no experience, and
  am ignorant even of its rudimentary principles. By the way, I was interested
  in what I heard last week&mdash;you can guess where&mdash;about a treaty with
  the power in question. There are some peculiar complications, are there
  not?"</p>

  <p>"There have been some very peculiar complications and some unusual
  difficulties," Sir James remarked, smoking his cigar with evident relish, and
  gazing, with the ghost of a smile still upon his lips, into the depths of the
  open dispatch-box by his side.</p>

  <p>"Well, it is a pity," I remarked. "The advantages of the treaty to us are
  very obvious just now. Is it permitted to ask
  you&mdash;unofficially&mdash;whether the difficulties are insuperable?"</p>

  <p>Sir James removed the cigar from his mouth. He leaned a little forward; I
  could see that he was about to become confidential.</p>

  <p>"The whole history of our negotitations will never become known," he said.
  "The fact is, a certain royal personage, whom I need not name to you, was
  very much opposed indeed to the signing of the treaty. All along we have had
  to contend with a strong antagonism from&mdash;after all, I do not see why I
  should conceal it from you &mdash; from the queen."</p>

  <p>"The queen," I repeated; "I did not know that her majesty was a
  politician! One hears of her chiefly as an European beauty, and a giver of
  magnificent entertainments."</p>

  <p>"I can assure you that her majesty is underrated," Sir James replied
  grimly. "She has had her finger on the weak spot in the treaty from the
  first. If the matter rested with her, it would have been torn in two long
  ago. Her influence, as you may be aware, is great, and while it remains so
  our relations are liable at any moment be become strained. It is one of those
  things which we have always had to contend with, of which the public know
  nothing at all, and for which, of course, they make no allowance."</p>

  <p>"The public are hard taskmasters," I remarked; "I often wonder that they
  are so zealously and faithfully served. By the bye, Sir James, I noticed that
  you used the past tense. Is there any chance, do you think, of getting the
  treaty signed in the face of such opposition?"</p>

  <p>There was a distinctly triumphant smile upon Sir James' thin, hard lips,
  as he glanced into the depths of the dispatch-box. It was standing at his
  elbow, and he had been carelessly playing with the lid. The perfume of
  violets, faint and sweet, seemed to be filling the room.</p>

  <p>"The treaty will be signed within a few days now," he said quietly. "I do
  not think that we shall ever again have any trouble in that quarter. Of
  course, you will understand that I do not wish this to go any further at
  present; but, speaking to you in confidence, I may say that means have come
  into our hands which will put a summary end now and for ever to the
  opposition I spoke of. I cannot say more, even to you, at present; but the
  whole affair will be public property before long."</p>

  <p>I leaned back in my chair, and nerved myself for what was to come. I had
  learned all that I needed to know. This was the climax.</p>

  <p>"I trust not," I said slowly.</p>

  <p>Sir James let fall the lid of his dispatch-box with a bang, and looked up
  at me in amazement.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he said; "I think that I do not quite
  understand."</p>

  <p>"I repeat that I trust not," I said. "The means to which you
  allude"&mdash;I looked hard into the dispatch-box&mdash;" are means of which
  no use must be made."</p>

  <p>Sir James drew a bunch of keys from his pocket, and calmly double-locked
  the dispatch-box. Then he rose to his feet, and turned a frowning face upon
  me.</p>

  <p>"I am completely at a loss to understand you, Lord Cravon," he said
  coldly. "Be so good as to explain yourself."</p>

  <p>"I am here to do so," 1 answered firmly. "I am here for no other purpose.
  The means to which you allude are these. You have obtained possession of
  compromising letters, written by a certain personage to my brother, Reginald
  Lessingham."</p>

  <p>"To&mdash;your brother?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You have probably overlooked the fact, Sir James, that my family
  name is Lessingham; and it is my brother, Reginald Lessingham, who is the
  senior attache at Marianburg."</p>

  <p>"The fact," Sir James remarked, "was unknown to me. I may add that it is
  also a matter of indifference. If the young gentleman has been imprudent, as
  he certainly appears to have been, he must accept the consequences."</p>

  <p>"He is perfectly willing to do so," I answered. "At present that is not
  the point. Those letters to which you have referred, made public, would be
  the ruin of any woman, even a queen. You propose to make them public, and to
  ruin her! It is very simple. You are a patriot and a politician, and you
  would rise one step higher in the estimation of your party upon the wreck of
  a woman's honour."</p>

  <p>There was a bright light in Sir James' grey eyes, a flush upon his cheeks.
  The lines upon his face had contracted and hardened. He remained cool, but he
  was desperately angry.</p>

  <p>"Continue, sir."</p>

  <p>"Diplomacy might sanction your use of these letters in such a case, Sir
  James," I proceeded, "if they had come into your hands by other means."</p>

  <p>"You seem to be remarkably well informed, Lord Cravon. Can you tell me
  then exactly how I did receive them?"</p>

  <p>"I believe so," I replied. "They were either sent you from Paris, or
  brought to you by a young man, named Harris, a distant connexion of your own,
  and one of the Embassy secretaries at Marianburg. Now I know you be an honest
  as well as a shrewd politician, Sir James, and I am perfectly sure that you
  have been misled as to how these letters came into young Harris'
  possession."</p>

  <p>"He found&mdash;never mind, I will hear what you have to say first, Lord
  Cravon."</p>

  <p>"You are wise, Sir James. He probably assured you that he found them. He
  did not. His zeal in your service led him further than that. He, or an
  accomplice, chloroformed and gagged my brother's servant, and abstracted
  these letters from his private safe, opened with the Embassy keys. In other
  words, he committed a gross and criminal burglary. It is in your interests
  that I bring this information, Sir James. I think you will admit that such
  methods are a little in front of the times; that they are, to say the least
  of it, not defensible."</p>

  <p>Sir James resumed his seat. His hard, worn face was puckered up with
  thought. He was silent for several moments. I could see that I was correct in
  my supposition. What I had just revealed was news to him. Harris' story had
  been a different one!</p>

  <p>"My nephew's conduct," he said, looking up at last, "was indiscreet and
  exceedingly ill-advised. If necessary, he must answer for it. I cannot shield
  him, nor should I attempt to do so. At the same time the violence that was
  offered was within the walls of our own Embassy. That is the crux of the
  matter. I admit that the means were deplorable, but the end which has been
  gained is great. I am sorry for your brother, Lord Cravon, on whose behalf I
  suppose you are here; but in the face of the great national gain, the welfare
  of individuals must go to the wall. I shall hold to my course."</p>

  <p>"Think well, Sir James," I said. "I have many powerful friends, and,
  however much I may blame my brother for his folly, I am with him in this to
  the end. I shall not let the matter drop. The story will get about. Our
  methods will be decried throughout the whole civilized world. You must admit
  that the letters were stolen. With this knowledge, shall you dare to use
  them?"</p>

  <p>"I am ignorant of the fact that they were stolen," Sir James answered
  coolly. "I have no cognizance of it. It is not necessary. The letters are
  here. As an officer of the State, I owe no one any explanation as to how they
  reached me. I have not investigated, or discovered any theft. Such work
  belongs to the Secret Service Department. I hold the letters for my purpose,
  and you will pardon my adding that I have no more to say to you, Lord
  Cravon."</p>

  <p>He laid his hand upon the bell, but I checked him.</p>

  <p>"Then prepare yourself for a further shock, Sir James," I said. "Last
  night your nephew paid the penalty for his over-zealousness. He was murdered
  by an agent of the Secret Police of Marianburg at the Hotel Maurice."</p>

  <p>Sir James had sunk back into his chair, pale to the lips. It was I now who
  was standing. I took a newspaper from the library table and showed it to
  him.</p>

  <p>"There is a full account of the affair, Sir James," I said. "I am very
  sorry to shock you, but you left me no alternative."</p>

  <p>He took the paper from my hand with trembling fingers. Suddenly a little
  exclamation broke from his lips.</p>

  <p>"The name is Shalders," he exclaimed. "My nephew's name is Harris. This
  has nothing to do with him."</p>

  <p>"It has everything to do with him," I answered gravely. "Shalders is the
  name of my brother's valet, who was chloroformed and maltreated at the
  Embassy. Your nephew took his name, and even dressed to resemble him, when he
  left Marianburg. When I read that paragraph, I knew at once who the
  unfortunate man was. My brother went to the Charing Cross Hospital this
  morning and identified him. There is no room for any doubt in the
  matter."</p>

  <p>"It was?"</p>

  <p>"It was your nephew, Leonard Harris, Sir James. He took the name of
  Shalders when he left for England, and he intended to keep his visit here a
  profound secret from every one in Marianburg. He had laid his plans well. He
  had a fortnight's leave of absence from his chief, and he was supposed to be
  in the country on a shooting expedition. Unfortunately for him, he was
  matched against a Secret Service which is perhaps the finest in the world. He
  had, after all, scarcely a chance. He was doomed from the moment he left
  Marianburg!"</p>

  <p>Sir James rose to his feet. He had regained his composure, but he was
  evidently shaken. I made a final effort.</p>

  <p>"You have those letters," I said. "Good! Now ask yourself what they have
  cost you! First of all a burglary with violence; then a life&mdash;the life
  of your own nephew. If they had been secretly stolen, and the thief was
  unknown, I admit that you might have used them safely. As it is, I warn you
  that to use them is to terminate, once and for ever, your career as a
  politician. We do not live in the days of Richelieu, or Mazarin. Such methods
  as have been used in this matter will never be tolerated in this country, or
  by international opinion."</p>

  <p>"It is impossible to connect me in any way with my nephew's blundering,"
  he answered. "I was not the instigator, or the abettor. All I know is, that
  these letters were placed in my hands, and it is my duty to use them for the
  benefit of my country. Of their history I am completely ignorant. I shall
  certainly not give them up."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Sir James," I declared, "your refusal leaves me but one
  alternative. I have an audience with the premier at four o'clock. It is now
  within a few minutes of that hour. I shall go to him, tell him all I know,
  and get him to wire orders that the seals which I have already had placed on
  your nephew's belongings are not disturbed until a special envoy has been
  through his correspondence. You may not have been his instigator! That is to
  be proved. In any case, Sir James, your resignation will be demanded within
  the next twenty-four hours."</p>

  <p>Sir James walked to the window, and came back again. Slowly he drew from
  his pocket a bunch of keys, and unlocked the dispatch-box. With the little
  packet in his hand he lingered even now, as though loth to part with it. Then
  with a slight bow he handed it to me across the table, and the perfume of
  crushed violets had never seemed to me so sweet before.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right, Lord Cravon," he said drily. "My position is
  untenable. Present those letters to your brother, with my most profound
  apologies for the manner in which they came into my hands. You can understand
  the reluctance with which I part with them; but I would like to assure you of
  this, I simply advised my poor nephew from time to time that any means of
  weakening the Queen's influence would be grateful to me, and would tend to
  his own advancement. Such means as he adopted were utterly unsanctioned by
  me. The limit of my instigation I have told you. In justice to myself, I
  desire to make it clear. Permit me to ring for your carriage."</p>

  <p>Our leave-takings were not cordial. Sir James remained standing upon his
  hearth-rug in grim silence, with the empty dispatch-box before him. I drove
  swiftly homewards, and hastened into the library. Reggie was sitting there
  waiting for me, and, when I held out the box to him, he gave a great cry, and
  tore it open with passionate haste.</p>

  <p>"They are all there?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Every one," he sobbed. "Every one! Thank God."</p>

  <p>I left him watching a smouldering mass of ashes, fearful lest even a
  single line which could ever be deciphered should remain. Then I went to her.
  She rose to meet me, and her face, too, was drawn with emotion.</p>

  <p>"Your majesty," I said, bowing low. "You have but half an hour to catch
  the boat train."</p>

  <p>She drew a long breath. There was a look in her face which I have never
  forgotten, but which I have never understood. Only it seemed to me rather the
  look of the woman who bows her head once more to step back into the stone
  cell of a nunnery, after a little wandering in the rose gardens of life.</p>

  <p>"You have succeeded?" she asked in a low tone.</p>

  <p>"Your majesty," I answered, "has no longer any cause for uneasiness. The
  letters by this time are ashes."</p>

  <p>She took my hands in hers, and held them tightly.</p>

  <p>"My Lord Cravon," she said sweetly," may every woman in distress find a
  cavalier so generous and so wise as yourself!"</p>

  <p>I felt a burning spot upon my hands, the delicate perfume of a woman's
  hair brushed against my cheek, the rustling of a silken gown swept the floor.
  I heard the door close, and I knew that she was gone.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A week later Reggie tossed me an evening paper. I glanced at
  the paragraph to which he pointed.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"The Opera House at Marianburg was on Monday night one
  of the most magnificent spectacles of the season. The royal box was occupied
  by the king and queen and a brilliant suite. Her majesty, who wore black
  velvet and diamonds, has never appeared more beautiful, and was certainly the
  most distinguished-looking woman in the house. Amongst others who were
  present we noticed, etc., etc."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," Reggie said, "if she knows how much she owes you?"</p>

  <p>I lit a cigarette, and looked thoughtfully through the wreath of blue
  smoke.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if she does," I answered thoughtfully.</p>

     name="story2">II.&mdash;THE AMBASSADOR'S DILEMMA</a></h2>

  <h4>ILLUSTRATED BY J. FINNEMORE</h4>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Sep 1900</h3>

  <p class="first">THE AMBASSADOR looked at me and I looked at the Ambassador.
  It was not by any means the first pause in an exceedingly awkward
  conversation.</p>

  <p>"You see," he remarked, suavely, "you also are concerned in this affair. I
  am glad to observe that you contrive to retain your cheerfulness, but I am
  bound to point out the fact that&mdash;diplomatically, at any rate&mdash;you
  are in a parlous state."</p>

  <p>I assumed as lugubrious an expression as possible and ventured to contest
  his point of view.</p>

  <p>"I don't exactly see&mdash;" I began, but he stopped me.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not. I will explain. If I am&mdash;what shall we
  say?&mdash;removed, my First Secretary will certainly go with me. He is
  supposed to be equally to blame when anything goes wrong; he shares the
  reward when a small triumph is gained. Now, you are my First Secretary,
  Hamblin, and we are in no end of a mess; in your own interests I should
  recommend you to bestir yourself."</p>

  <p>I drew a little breath. If I had not been in a way attached to my chief, I
  should certainly have used it for a different purpose. As Sir George had
  remarked, we were certainly in no end of a mess, but it was he himself and
  alone who had landed us there.</p>

  <p>"If you could suggest any way, sir, in which I could be of the slightest
  use," I remarked deprecatingly, "nothing would give me more pleasure.
  Unfortunately, we seem to be sitting down before a great wall; it's too high
  to climb, and there's no way round."</p>

  <p>"A very charming simile," Sir George said dryly. "Nevertheless, if you
  don't get over, yourself, or help me to, you won't marry my daughter."</p>

  <p>I came to the conclusion promptly that Sir George was an unreasonable and
  disagreeable old man; but I kept my conviction to myself.</p>

  <p>"I hope you will reconsider that, sir," I said most respectfully. "I am
  very fond of Clara, and I think she cares a little for me."</p>

  <p>"Work for her, then," was the prompt answer. "Here's your chance. Get us
  out of this wretched muddle, and you shall have her&mdash;as soon as she
  likes!"</p>

  <p>I pondered. I was very fond of Clara. I began to wish that the situation
  were not so hopeless. Sir George took up his penholder and marked time with
  it.</p>

  <p>"The affair," he said, "lies in a nutshell; it is as simple as A B C."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's simple enough," I assented&mdash;"painfully simple!"</p>

  <p>"England," the Ambassador continued, ignoring my interruption, "is at war
  with the Transvaal Republic. Last week there appeared in an issue of a
  foreign newspaper what purports to be an interview between the monarch of
  this country and the European representative of the Transvaal Republic. The
  interview&mdash;or, let us say, purported interview&mdash;you have read
  yourself. It is sufficient to remark that, if it was authentic, it was
  tantamount to a declaration of war against England. Now, you know what an
  artful old beggar Highbury is! He sends me across by Queen's messenger two
  sealed dispatches for the Emperor, addressed to him privately. One is marked
  'A,' the other 'B.' Now, if the interview had been genuine, I was to have
  dealt the first blow by presenting `B,' which is tantamount to an ultimatum
  couched in most formal and war-like language. If, on the other hand, its
  authenticity is denied, I present 'A,' which is a friendly little note
  assuring his Majesty that no notice was taken in England of what was
  obviously a ridiculous canard. You know, of course, what has happened."</p>

  <p>"The Emperor has denied the whole story contemptuously from beginning to
  end," I remarked. "The Transvaal representative was never accorded an
  interview."</p>

  <p>Sir George flourished the penholder with new vigour.</p>

  <p>"Precisely. I accordingly left at the Palace the letter marked 'A,' and,
  returning here, proceeded to open and destroy letter 'B.' I read it first,
  and to my horror found that its contents were as per specification of letter
  'A,' and that consequently the lettering must have been wrong, and the
  ultimatum left at the Palace."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see where we are to blame, you know," I interposed.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," my chief remarked dryly. "You see, you are very young. But
  there is an axiom in diplomacy which you will do well to lay to heart. If
  anything goes wrong at your charge, no matter who is to blame, you are
  responsible. Those letters have been changed by spies, most likely, and I
  think I know who is at the bottom of it. It was probably done while they were
  in the possession of the Queen's messenger&mdash;he admits that he took no
  extra precautions. That is of no consequence. It is upon us that the blame
  will fall. There awaits for the Emperor a letter which will either plunge us
  into a ruinous, unnecessary, and unpopular war, or else will mean Highbury's
  resignation, our retirement to a Colony, and a most awful climb-down."</p>

  <p>"The Emperor," I remarked, "is still at
  Meritzburg&mdash;manoeuvering?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He returns to-morrow. To-morrow night that letter will be handed to
  him."</p>

  <p>"You're sure it hasn't been sent on to him?"</p>

  <p>"Certain. I happen to know that his commands were most absolute. Nothing
  was to be forwarded. Von Butz has the letter, and knows its contents."</p>

  <p>"Sure of that?" I ventured.</p>

  <p>Sir George tossed an evening paper over to me.</p>

  <p>"You see what the beast is doing," he said. "Strange rumour at the
  barracks, all-night work at the arsenals, mysterious notices to railway
  companies. It all means one thing&mdash;mobilisation."</p>

  <p>"Von Butz has read the letter by fair means or foul. The Emperor will
  receive it in person to-morrow night. The letter await shim at Von Butz's
  house," I remarked thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Marvellous!" Sir George remarked with sarcasm. "You have the insight of a
  Mazarin.</p>

  <p>"One must put up with sarcasm from one's prospective father-in-law,
  especially when he is in as tight a place as Sir George undoubtedly was. I
  had sufficient magnanimity to ignore it.</p>

  <p>"Have you made any effort to regain possession of the letter?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>Sir George shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I might as well try to fly," he said, "as attempt to regain possession of
  it by fair means. Von Butz is our enemy and the enemy of our country. All the
  ill-feeling and friction of the last few years has been his making and his
  alone. This letter is the summit of his desire. In the light of the Emperor's
  frank and downright statement, it is nothing more nor less than a brutal
  insult. I cannot imagine any apologies which could possibly be offered
  sufficient to atone for it. It will mean war for England and the Colonies for
  us."</p>

  <p>"If the Emperor reads it," I remarked softly.</p>

  <p>"If the Emperor reads it," Sir George repeated, looking over at me.</p>

  <p>I buried my face in my hands and tried to think. There came a knock at the
  door and a telegraphic dispatch. Sir George fetched out the code-book with
  shaking fingers. He groaned as he read it out.</p><br>

  <p>"We haven't much time, have we?" I remarked. "Let us make the most of
  it."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>I took up my pen and the code-book, and wrote a telegram.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">TO HIGHBURY, DOWNING ST., LONDON.<br>
  DISCREDIT ALL RUMOURS. MOBILISATION RIDICULOUS. ALL QUITE HERE. DULY
  DELIVERED LETTER 'A.' PROBABLY STOCK EXCHANGE RIG. WILL REQUEST AUDIENCE
  TO-MORROW.</p><br>

  <p>"We'll start boldly, at any rate," I said, rising. "Send this, and I will
  be back in an hour."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" Sir George asked.</p>

  <p>"To call on Fräulein von Butz," I answered.</p>

  <p align="center">* * *</p>

  <p>Youth is dauntless and excitement is sweet. So I walked through the broad,
  sunlit streets of Badenberg with a smiling face, a cigarette of delicate
  flavour between my lips, and tried to persuade myself that it was not a
  forlorn hope upon which I had embarked. In my pocket was letter 'A,' which
  should have been marked `B,' in my right hand a fragrant bunch of Neapolitan
  violets, whose faint, sweet perfume had stolen out to me from a florist's
  shop in the Avenue. As I passed up the broad steps of the mansion where Von
  Butz lived, the Fates did me a good turn. The door before me opened and
  Fräulein von Butz came out, dressed for driving.</p>

  <p>I bowed low and held out the flowers.</p>

  <p>"A farewell gift, Fräulein," I said sadly. "You will deign to accept them,
  I hope!"</p>

  <p>She held out her hands, and her bright smile of welcome changed to a look
  of interrogation.</p>

  <p>"I will accept them," she said, "with very much pleasure, and I thank you
  indeed for thinking of me. But why a farewell gift, Mr. Hamblin? Are you
  going away on leave again?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>"It is no matter of leave, dear Fräulein," I said. "I am quitting the
  Service. I should have left to-day, but I wanted to say good-bye to you."</p>

  <p>She turned back into the hall.</p>

  <p>"Come inside," she said. "I do not understand."</p>

  <p>I heard her instruct the hall-porter to send back the carriage. She led me
  into her own tiny sitting-room, as neat and dainty as herself, and motioned
  me to an easy-chair. She sat down close to me and loosened the furs from her
  neck.</p>

  <p>"You are giving up the Service," she said, "you are leaving Badenberg! Is
  it not very sudden, Mr. Hamblin?"</p>

  <p>"It has come upon me," I said gloomily, "like a thunderclap."</p>

  <p>"You shall tell me," she insisted, raising her bright eyes to mine, "all
  about it. Have you come into the title, is your heath bad, or are you
  promoted?"</p>

  <p>I was silent for a moment. It was silence which told. Then I shook my
  head.</p>

  <p>"Fräulein," I said, "when I have gone you will hear from others what I
  would rather tell you myself. I have longed for this opportunity, yet now it
  has come&mdash;it is not easy!"</p>

  <p>Her piquant little face was full of sympathy. By accident my hand fell
  upon the arm of her chair and touched her fingers. She drew them
  away&mdash;slowly.</p>

  <p>"Fräulein," I said, "there is one profession in the world in which a
  single mistake is fatal. That profession unfortunately is, or was,
  mine&mdash;and that mistake&mdash;I have made."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she cried.</p>

  <p>It was enough. My humiliation now required no pretence. It came naturally
  to me. I felt that I was a cad.</p>

  <p>"Won't you tell me a little more?" she begged. "I am so very sorry for
  you&mdash;and sorry that you are going away."</p>

  <p>Her hand once more fell upon the arm of her chair. Never were fingers more
  soft and velvety to the touch.</p>

  <p>"Fräulein," I said, "if I may tell you, I will. I should like you to know
  the truth. It is this. Two letters were entrusted to me, one of which was to
  be delivered to the Emperor, the other destroyed. I delivered&mdash;to your
  father, as it happens&mdash;the wrong one."</p>

  <p>She was perplexed.</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" she asked.</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"The action," I said, "is a small one&mdash;but the result is
  terrible."</p>

  <p>"Terrible?"</p>

  <p>"It is too weak a word," I assented. "Do you know what war means,
  Fräulein?"</p>

  <p>She shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Do not speak of it!" she begged.</p>

  <p>"You will hear it spoken of before long, Fräulein," I said; "and, alas! I
  shall be the unhappy cause. War between your country and mine! It is
  fearful!"</p>

  </div>

  <p>I am afraid my fingers tightened upon hers. I am sure that the pressure
  was returned.</p>

  <p>"The letter you spoke of," she asked&mdash;"has the Emperor received it
  yet?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet," I answered; "your father has it. The Emperor returns to-morrow
  night."</p>

  <p>She leaned forward, suddenly pale.</p>

  <p>"He returns to-night!" she exclaimed. "Only an hour ago my father had a
  telegram from him."</p>

  <p>"To-night or to-morrow night," I muttered&mdash;"what matters? The letter
  has gone from my hands beyond recovery; he opens it, reads, and war is as
  certain as to-morrow's sun. Oh, it is enough to make a man mad to think of
  it! War between the two nations who have brought the science of killing to
  perfection! It will be the greatest massacre the world has ever known, and
  the everlasting shame of it will be upon my head."</p>

  <p>"Don't," she cried&mdash;"please don't!"</p>

  <p>I drew myself up.</p>

  <p>"At least, Fräulein," I said gently and with real tenderness, "I have no
  right to come here and make you miserable. Only I could not go away without
  seeing you and asking you to sometimes remember&mdash;a most unfortunate
  man!"</p>

  <p>I stretched out my hand for my hat. She stopped me.</p>

  <p>"No, no," she cried; "sit still! Let me think."</p>

  <p>I watched the colour come and go from her cheeks. She pushed back the
  pretty fringe from her forehead. Ah, Gertrud von Butz, you wrote the memory
  of your dainty little self into my heart for ever in those few minutes!</p>

  <p>She turned toward me.</p>

  <p>"What if the letter were destroyed?" she asked slowly.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible," I answered, with thumping heart.</p>

  <p>"But if it were?"</p>

  <p>"There would be no war," I said. "There would be no disgrace for me; I
  should remain in Badenberg. But it is impossible!"</p>

  <p>"Should you know it if you saw it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>She rose up.</p>

  <p>"Come with me," she said. "Do not speak. If we meet my father it will be a
  convent for me. You must do what seems best to you."</p>

  <p>She was as pale as a sheet, but she walked firmly and without hesitation.
  As we crossed the hall where several servants were standing she turned to
  me.</p>

  <p>"Your own conservatories," she said, "are so much more beautiful. But
  there, you shall judge."</p>

  <p>We turned off down a long passage. At the end was a conservatory, but she
  paused and listened at the last door on the right. It was empty. She turned
  the handle. We passed inside. She took a bunch of keys from her pocket and
  unlocked a cabinet which stood in the centre of the room. A pile of letters
  were there. My head swam with joy.</p>

  <p>"Quick," she whispered. "Ah! We are lost. It is my father."</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"
     name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><img src="1203441h-images/FTQ02-3.png"
        style="margin-right:20%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>I dashed at the letters, seized a handful, but dropped them again as the
  lid of the cabinet fell upon my wrist. She whirled me across the room, behind
  a curtain into a long annexe to the conservatory. I could have cried with the
  disappointment. But for her sake I would have rushed out and torn the letter
  to pieces before Von Butz's eyes. Gertrud came close to me. I passed my arm
  round her waist; she was trembling violently.</p>

  <p>Voices approached, and footsteps. The door of the room opened. Through the
  crack in the curtain I saw Von Butz enter, and my heart stood still. For
  behind him came a tall, familiar figure in a brilliant uniform partially
  covered by a long military cloak.</p>

  <p>"And now, Von Butz, the letter at once," he exclaimed brusquely.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty shall have it," was the quiet answer, as Von Butz produced
  his keys. "When you have read it, you will say that I have done well in
  starting the great engine which your Majesty has constructed with such
  marvellous and wonderful forethought."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's pause. Then I saw the letter pass into the Emperor's
  hands.</p>

  <p>"You yourself, Von Butz," I heard him say, "are well acquainted with the
  contents?"</p>

  <p>"My secret agents," Von Butz answered, "ever keen in the service of the
  Fatherland, borrowed it from the Queen's messenger and brought me a copy. We
  have saved hours which are worth millions."</p>

  <p>The Emperor broke the seal. He stood up and a fierce light burned in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Von Butz," he said, "you will be my witness that these things which are
  to come are of God's ordination, not mine. With the finest army in the world,
  trained and brought to perfection under my own care and governance, I, the
  certain master of this great continent from the firing of the first guns of
  battle, have ever refrained from violence or provocation. With the warlike
  spirit of my forefathers in my veins, I have yet held out to all nations the
  olive branch instead of the iron grip. History must acknowledge this. Though
  I am all-conquering and almighty, I have yet been slow to strike. You will
  remember this, Von Butz."</p>

        style="margin-left:20%; float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration"><br>

  <p>"Always, your Majesty."</p>

  <p>The Emperor tore open the letter and bent over it with serene forehead and
  expectant eyes. He read, frowned, re-read, and flung it passionately upon the
  table. He turned upon Von Butz with a fury which was paralysing.</p>

  <p>"Dolt! Fool!" he cried. "You have been tricked! You have made me a
  laughing-stock! You have betrayed the nation!"</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty," Von Butz faltered, "the copy I sent you was a faithful
  one. My agent copied it himself in the express."</p>

  <p>"Listen, then," cried the Emperor.</p>

  <p>He read out letter 'A.'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>I walked home, my nerves tingling with excitement, relieved, but very
  puzzled. Sir George called me into the study immediately I arrived.</p>

  <p>"Hamblin," he said, in an airy manner, "I'm afraid you have been
  disturbing yourself about a mare's nest!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed!" I found breath to say.</p>

  <p>Sir George, nodded and tapped an open letter with his finger.</p>

  <p>"It seems," he continued, "that Bucknell, the messenger, is rather a smart
  fellow. He found out that his dispatches had been tampered with, so wired
  Highbury for instructions. Immediately he received them he destroyed letter
  'B' and duplicated 'A.' The duplication was to catch the thief, if possible,
  and I should imagine that it did."</p>

  <p>"I should think so, too," I answered, smiling.</p>

  <p>"One word more," Sir George said, coughing and assuming his most dignified
  deportment. "With regard to Clara, I have talked to her seriously, and found
  her, as I expected, amenable to reason. You are both too young to think of
  marriage, and an engagement does not seem to us desirable. In short, we have
  other views for Clara."</p>

  <p>I drew a long breath&mdash;not of despair, but of resignation. That night,
  at the Russian Embassy, I sat out four dances with Gertrud von Butz.</p>

  <h2><a id="story3"
     name="story3">III.&mdash;THE MAN WHOM NOBODY LIKED</a></h2>

  <h4>ILLUSTRATED BY R. PANNETT</h4>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Dec 1903</h3>

  <p class="first">HE CAME into their midst unexpectedly, apparently
  unconscious of the sudden silence which seemed designed to act as a barrier
  between him and them. He only smiled&mdash;a little malevolently, it is true,
  but still with some sense of humour. He dragged a chair across the lawn and
  seated himself in a cool place within a yard or so of his hostess.</p>

  <p>"How very enterprising of you, Mr. Lyndham!" she murmured, lifting her
  parasol a little on one side, and inwardly rebelling against her husband's
  express instructions to be always civil to this man. "Have you walked all the
  way from Broom Hill in this sun?"</p>

  <p>He assented, but without speech. His gesture was of the slightest. Really
  his manners were worse than brusque. Mrs. Poynton languidly ordered some
  fresh tea and turned her shoulder upon the newcomer. He had come without
  invitation upon an afternoon of some importance&mdash;he should entertain
  himself. There were limits to her tolerance, obedient wife though she
  was.</p>

  <p>So the conversation ebbed and flowed around him. Everyone followed their
  hostess's lead and made no attempt to draw him into it. Yet never was a
  casual visitor so little upset by the subtle but unmistakable rudeness of
  being ignored. He drank his tea absently, and notwithstanding his isolation,
  he made no movement to depart.</p>

  <p>"My dear Eleanor," Lady Martyn whispered to her hostess, "what an
  extraordinary man! Is he a specimen of your country neighbours? I thought the
  people were quite decent round here."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Poynton gently elevated her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Heaven only knows who or what he is!" she murmured. "We none of us like
  him except my husband, and you know how anything unusual attracts him."</p>

  <p>"But where does he come from? Is he a neighbour?"</p>

  <p>"His name is Lyndham, and he has taken a cottage a few miles away. No one
  seems to have an idea who or what he is, and he is most uncommunicative. He
  seems to spend most of his time walking in the grounds here and staring up at
  the house."</p>

  <p>"A gentleman&mdash;but how uncouth!" Lady Martyn declared under her
  breath.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Poynton looked sideways at him through the lace which drooped from
  her parasol. There was disparagement, but a certain amount of curiosity in
  her stealthy gaze. Mr. Lyndham wore old clothes, his beard was ill-trimmed,
  his necktie a subterfuge. But, after all, perhaps Lady Martyn was right.
  There was a certain air of breeding about the man, and his voice had the
  unmistakable quality which attracts. She lowered her parasol again.</p>

  <p>"Why he comes here," she said softly&mdash;"especially whilst my husband
  is away&mdash;I cannot imagine. No one is civil to him, and he very seldom
  speaks to anybody. He asked Arthur for permission to walk in the grounds, and
  since then he seems to haunt the place. I met him one evening striding along
  the avenue and muttering to himself. I must have passed within a yard of him,
  and he took not the slightest notice. I was almost frightened to death."</p>

  <p>"Your husband was always so good-natured," Lady Martyn yawned. "By the by,
  how about the lease?"</p>

  <p>"Arthur has gone up to see the solicitors," Mrs. Poynton answered. "They
  do not seem to be able to get any reply from Sir Gervase. I don't think they
  even know where he is, and they have no power of attorney."</p>

  <p>Lady Martyn looked across the terraced lawn to the long, ivy-covered front
  of the house.</p>

  <p>"I hope you do not lose it," she said.</p>

  <p>"There isn't another place like it in the county. Isn't it almost time she
  came?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Poynton leaned forward in her chair.</p>

  <p>"I believe," she said, "that I can hear the carriage."</p>

  <p>From where they sat, the lower of three terraced lawns, cool with the
  quivering shade of dark cedar trees, one could see the long approach to the
  Abbey, a mile of straight white road leading through a parklike expanse of
  meadowland, yellow always at this time of the year with buttercups and clumps
  of marigolds. Mrs. Poynton rose to her feet, and there was as much excitement
  in her manner as a well-bred woman would permit herself to entertain.</p>

  <p>"The Princess is coming," she announced.</p>

  <p>Only her unwelcome visitor sat still. Everyone else stood up to catch a
  glimpse of the victoria, now plainly visible. Mrs. Poynton glanced at this
  man, whom nobody liked, almost with aversion. He represented the one alien
  note in the little party of immaculately flannelled men, and women in all the
  glory of muslin gowns and flower-garlanded hats. He ought to have the good
  sense to go before the arrival of the Princess. He must understand that his
  appearance and strange humours were in ill accord With a gathering such as
  this. But Mr. Lyndham did not move. His arms were folded, his eyes were fixed
  on vacancy. He seemed to have passed into a world of his own
  creation&mdash;obviously a very rude thing to do. Apparently he was not even
  contemplating an early departure.</p>

  <p><a id="pic5"

        style="margin-left:20%; float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>He had manners enough to rise, however, when the Princess, seeing them all
  gathered under the cedar tree, stopped the carriage and came smiling across
  the lawn to them. A trifle grave-eyed, perhaps, and a little wary, she still
  justified easily the extravagant praises of a too personal Press. In her
  white lace dress and parasol, without a vestige of color, her pallor seemed
  to speak of a fatigue not wholly physical. Yet it was impossible to deny her
  beauty.</p>

  <p>In the midst of a little buzz of introductions, she found herself suddenly
  face to face with Lyndham, whom Mrs. Poynton had no idea at all of
  mentioning. In those few seconds of breathless silence which intervened
  before she held out her hand, there flashed backwards and forwards between
  the two, nameless things. She, if possible, was a little paler, and her
  admirable self-possession faltered. He, too, seemed to be struggling for
  self-control.</p>

  <p>"I may be permitted to recall myself to your memory, Princess," he said,
  looking at her steadily. "My name is Lyndham&mdash;Richard Lyndham. May I
  hope that I am not quite forgotten?"</p>

  <p>She held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"One does not forget one's oldest friends," she said softly. "I am very
  glad to see you again, Mr. Lyndham."</p>

  <p>Her hostess led her away. The Princess of Berlitz was a personage, even if
  her husband's estates had lain far away in a corner of Austria; and the suite
  of rooms into which Mrs. Poynton herself conducted her had once been occupied
  by royalty. Tea and fruit were ready on a tiny table in the sitting-room.
  Beyond in the bedroom a couple of maids were already busy unpacking. Mrs.
  Poynton looked around, and the stream of idle words which had been passing
  between the two stopped.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she said, "if there is anything else I can do for you?"</p>

  <p>The Princess hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "there is something else. I should be glad if I could
  speak for a few minutes with Mr. Lyndham up here."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Poynton was taken aback. She stared blankly at her guest.</p>

  <p>"With Mr. Lyndham?" she repeated vaguely.</p>

  <p>The Princess bowed.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Poynton recovered herself, though she was still steeped in
  amazement.</p>

  <p>"By all means," she said slowly. "I will send him up to you."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Poynton returned to the garden. Mr. Lyndham was still there, sitting
  a little apart from the others. She went up to him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lyndham," she said, and unconsciously her voice took a new tone in
  addressing him, "the Princess desires to speak to you in her room. If you
  will come this way, I will show you where she is."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lyndham rose slowly to his feet. He did not appear surprised, but he
  showed no signs of eagerness.</p>

  <p>"I will follow you," he said.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The door was safely closed. They were face to face. The Princess was in
  unfamiliar guise. Her eyes were full of tears, her voice, as she stood there
  with outstretched hand, shook.</p>

  <p>"Gervase!" she exclaimed, "at last I have found you, then! You cannot
  escape me now. Come!"</p>

  <p>He took her hand and raised it to his lips. He was almost unrecognizable.
  All the hardness seemed to have passed from his strong, weather-tanned face.
  His eyes and voice were as soft as a child's.</p>

  <p>"Dear Gabrielle!" he murmured. "You believe still? You have not lost your
  faith?"</p>

  <p>"Never! Never for one moment!"</p>

  <p>"Thank God! Even though it be you against the world."</p>

  <p>They were silent for several moments. There was so much between them which
  seemed better expressed unspoken.</p>

  <p>"You keep still&mdash;your borrowed name?"</p>

  <p>"I have no other," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Yet you are back in England&mdash;here, of all places in the world."</p>

  <p>"And in this room," he added, with a dash of his old cynicism. "Nothing is
  stranger than that!"</p>

  <p>She stared away and looked around. Her dark eyes were full of shadows of
  some reawakened fear.</p>

  <p>"It is true!" she declared. "The whole place is altered and modernised out
  of recognition. I did not realize where I was."</p>

  <p>He moved to the window.</p>

  <p>"It was from here," he said, "that the shot was fired; and there were a
  dozen people ready to testify that no one save myself passed out from this
  room."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"Gervase!" she exclaimed suddenly, "you are here with an object!"</p>

  <p>"And you?"</p>

  <p>"Also with an object. Tell me, you received a letter?"</p>

  <p>"I did! It brought me from Alaska."</p>

  <p>"And me," she declared, "from Austria. Look!"</p>

  <p>He glanced at it.</p>

  <p>"The same as mine," he declared. "Heaven knows, it seems improbable
  enough! But dying men sometimes tell the truth."</p>

  <p>He was busy already at the wall. With his knife he gashed recklessly at
  the new and expensive Lincrusta Walton. For several minutes he pushed and
  strained and knocked. At last with a little cry he succeeded. A hidden door
  swung back a few inches. With a poker for a lever he forced it open. The
  Princess looked over his shoulder eagerly. It was a mere closet of an
  apartment, dark and empty, save for a single shelf.</p>

  <p>"After all," he said despondently, "there is nothing here to help us."</p>

  <p>"But do you not see," she exclaimed, "one part of the mystery vanishes
  from this moment? This is where the man hid who fired the shot!"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was an idiot not to have thought of the place before," he said, "but I
  was told that it had been blocked up whilst I was at school. You are right.
  One part of the mystery vanishes. But the other remains."</p>

  <p>She pointed to something upon the floor.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" she asked. "A book?"</p>

  <p>He stooped to pick it up&mdash;a dingy, faded volume, with the word
  "Diary" stamped upon it on the outer cover, the sort of thing which was the
  weakness of the last generation of schoolgirls. It was thick with dust and
  yellow with age. He opened it carelessly at the last page and bent forward to
  catch the light. Then he gave a little cry.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Gervase?"</p>

  <p>"Heaven only knows!" he muttered, and the hand which clutched the book
  shook as though an ague had seized him. "Read, Gabrielle! I cannot!"</p>

  <p>She snatched it from him. Followed by him, she carried it out into the
  light.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The man whom nobody liked, the man who was Mrs. Poynton's bête noire,
  remained alone with the Princess in her sitting-room for nearly an hour.
  Meanwhile Mrs. Poynton and her guests talked. The more tolerant assumed an
  old friendship; others smiled. The Princess was of ancient family, but in the
  days before her fortunate marriage she had been poor. It was rumored that she
  had been a governess. Who could tell what entanglements she might not have
  formed at that time? The Prince, who had been dead for little more than a
  year, had left her a wealthy woman. Her place in Society seemed assured. It
  was supposed that she was ambitious. She was indeed a splendid victim for the
  intelligent blackmailer. Mrs. Poynton grew weary of explaining how little she
  knew of Mr. Lyndham. He had come from nobody knew where. Arthur had taken a
  fancy to him, it was true, but she herself had mistrusted him from the first.
  Then there was a sudden hush. The Princess and Mr. Lyndham were coining down
  the steps and across the lawn.</p>

  <p>"Dear Mrs. Poynton," the Princess murmured, as she joined them, "my rooms
  are perfect. But one of them, I think, has a history. Is it true that Sir
  Knowles Philton was shot from the window of my sitting-room?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Poynton was a little perturbed.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that it is true," she admitted. "It is many years ago,
  however, and I thought that everyone would have forgotten. I hope you are not
  afraid of ghosts."</p>

  <p>The Princess smiled brilliantly.</p>

  <p>"Already," she confessed, "I have seen one."</p>

  <p>There was a little murmur of amusement. Then everyone suddenly realized
  that she was in earnest. She had something to say to them.</p>

  <p>"I want you to tell me something about that murder, Mrs. Poynton," the
  Princess said. "Sir Knowles was shot as he walked upon the terrace, was he
  not, by some unseen person? Was the mystery ever cleared up?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Poynton shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Never positively," she answered. "Never in the courts, that is to say. Of
  course, all the evidence pointed to Gervase Philton, Knowles brother; and
  although they never arrested him, he had to leave the country."</p>

  <p>"Was there any quarrel between them, then?" the Princess asked.</p>

  <p>"No open quarrel," Mrs. Poynton answered, "but it came out afterwards that
  there had been a great deal of ill-feeling for some time. Very fortunately
  for Gervase, no word of this transpired at the inquest."</p>

  <p>"Dear me," the Princess murmured. "And the cause of the ill-
  feeling&mdash;was that ever known?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Poynton shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"The one eternal cause. She was a governess to Lady Money's
  children&mdash;Lady Money was their sister, you know, and she was living here
  while her husband completed his term in India. They say that both brothers
  were in love with her, and Gervase was supposed to be horribly jealous."</p>

  <p>There flashed between the Princess and Mr. Lyndham an illuminative glance
  which was a source of wonder to Mrs. Poynton.</p>

  <p>"Anyhow," Mrs. Poynton continued, "one night Sir Knowles was shot as he
  walked upon the terrace, and the shot was fired from his brother's window.
  Some workmen were taking down a picture on the landing just outside, and they
  saw no one but Gervase himself come out of or enter his room. So, you see, as
  far as the negative evidence went, it was fairly conclusive. Gervase remained
  in England for several months; then he went abroad, and no one has ever heard
  of him since. We took the place a few months afterwards, and for my own part
  I can't help saying that I hope Sir Gervase never comes back. We could not
  possibly find another place to suit us so well."</p>

  <p>The Princess smiled. Mr. Lyndham, wonderful to relate, followed suit.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that there is a disappointment in store for you, Mrs.
  Poynton," the Princess said. "Sir Gervase is back in England now. He is
  sitting by my side."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lyndham!" Mrs. Poynton screamed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lyndham bowed.</p>

  <p>"I must apologize for being here under false pretenses," he said, "but I
  had a very particular reason for desiring to pay a visit to this
  neighbourhood, and you can understand that I did not care to venture here
  under my own name. Eight years in the Colonies and a beard will do wonders
  for a man."</p>

  <p>"Yet the Princess recognized you," Mrs. Poynton said.</p>

  <p>"It is true," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"I, too," the Princess remarked, "have an explanation to make. You have
  heard that I was a governess for two years before I marred the Prince of
  Berlitz; but you perhaps did not know that I was a governess at this house,
  that it was on my account even that poor Sir Gervase here was accused of
  shooting his brother, who never spoke more than a civil word to me in his
  life."</p>

  <p>A sudden silence fell upon the little group. After all, the evidence had
  been very strong. Yet they neither of them looked in the least like guilty
  people.</p>

  <p>"Sir Gervase would rather, perhaps, that I told you what has
  happened&mdash;what we have discovered," the Princess said. "It is very
  simple, and the mystery which has baffled everyone so long does not exist any
  longer. Adjoining my sitting-room, from which the shot was fired, is a small
  secret closet, which apparently has not been opened for years. Some months
  ago we both of us received anonymous letters, dated from a hospital in Paris,
  advising us to explore this place. Hence Sir Gervase, hence my broken
  vow&mdash;for I had sworn never to set foot in England again. The closet
  appealed to us, as a likely hiding-place for the person who had fired the
  shot, but we have been fortunate to discover far more important things."</p>

  <p>"You found something there?" one of the guests exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"This," the Princess declared, holding up a little volume. "It is a sort
  of diary, and it is very eloquent. Is it your pleasure that I read aloud the
  last two extracts only?"</p>

  <p>"This is very extraordinary," Mrs. Poynton murmured. "Yes, please do read
  anything which will elucidate the matter."</p>

  <p>The Princess opened the book.</p>

  <p>"This," she said, "appears to be the diary of one Jules Letrange, valet of
  the late Sir Knowles Philton. The first few pages are merely a highly
  sentimental and romantic account of his affection for Mademoiselle de
  Caliste, which under the circumstances you will not expect me to read. He
  admits that he has not dared to betray himself in any way, he pleads guilty
  all the time to a most becoming doubt as to whether his suit would be in any
  way acceptable. He works his way through all the stages of frenzy, however,
  to madness, and he is evidently very near that state when this entry was
  written. You will observe that it was on the day of the murder.</p>

  <p>"September 11th&mdash;I cannot bear it any longer! If she is not for me,
  she is for no one. She favors Monsieur Gervase&mdash;a union impossible for
  her. Me she passes always by. I do not count with her. I am as the dust on
  which she treads. If she only knew that I have sworn it, perhaps she would
  not go out then to meet her lover, so blithe, so gay. If she is not for me,
  she is not for any other man...If I see her with Monsieur Gervase again, it
  is the end...</p>

  <p>"Heaven help me! I tremble all the time! I am afraid! I have shot the
  wrong man. I have shot Sir Knowles, my master. I heard him cry out! If only I
  could get away from here! I hid till it was dark&mdash;no one suspects. It is
  all finished. Tomorrow I may go. I leave this book. They speak of Monsieur
  Gervase. I will hide myself, and send word of this book if they arrest him.
  I..."</p>

  <p>The Princess closed the little volume.</p>

  <p>"The anonymous letters we both received were in the same handwriting. On
  my way through Paris I inquired at the hospital. The man is dead. He left no
  other confession. He left only this to tell his story."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Poynton shut down her parasol with a snap.</p>

  <p>"Really, it has been a most exciting afternoon. Only I am very much afraid
  now that I shall not get my lease renewed."</p>

  <p>Sir Gervase and the Princess exchanged smiles. "That depends," he said,
  "upon the Princess."</p>

     name="story4">IV.&mdash;THE MAN WHO SAVED THE PRESIDENT'S LIFE</a></h2>

  <h4>ILLUSTRATED BY OSCAR WILSON</h4>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, May 1903</h3>

  <h4>I</h4>

  <p>IT WAS the second day out, and people were beginning to settle down into
  their steamer clothes and manners. The girl had already established a little
  court, as was usual with her wherever she went. The man had not yet
  appeared.</p>

  <p>He came just as the deck-steward appeared with the afternoon tea. He was
  tall and pale, with dark, deep-set eyes and a sensitive mouth,
  notwithstanding its straight, firm lines. His features were hard and cleanly
  cut, his clothes hung loosely about him, as though his gauntness were merely
  the temporary result of some recent illness. He stepped out from the gangway
  with some hesitation; but once there, he swept the deck with a keen,
  masterful glance. A lurch of the steamer threw him against the side of a
  chair. He calmly seated himself in it and commenced to look bored.</p>

  <p>The chair was next to the girl's, but he did not appear to notice the
  fact. Several of the young men who were in attendance upon her had coveted
  the chair, but in vain. The girl, however, made no remark at this act of calm
  appropriation. It was left for his servant, who appeared a few minutes later
  with rugs and a small library of books, to point out to him that he was a
  trespasser.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir," he said, "but I don't think that this is your
  chair."</p>

  <p>The man looked annoyed.</p>

  <p>"It will do," he said shortly, "unless," he added, turning to the girl,
  "it belongs to one of your friends."</p>

  <p>The girl smiled upon him pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"It is my aunt's chair," she said; "but I think that you may safely occupy
  it for the present, at any rate. She will not be on deck this afternoon."</p>

  <p>The young man raised his cap, but he seemed curiously bereft of words. His
  thanks were barely articulate, and if it were possible for him to have become
  paler, he certainly did so. His long, white hands clutched nervously at the
  rug which covered his knees. Every now and then he cautiously studied the
  girl's profile. Under his breath he groaned to himself.</p>

  <p>"This is the beginning! What a fool I am! What a fool I have been!"</p>

  <p>There was a change also in the girl. Her high spirits seemed to have
  deserted her. Her laughter was forced, the sallies of her cavaliers failed to
  amuse her. She, too, was apparently conscious of the sudden approach of
  tragedy. One by one her attendants deserted her. Soon she was alone with the
  man.</p>

  <p>They did not begin to talk at once. They both seemed interested in the
  tumbled gray waste of waters through which the steamer was plowing her way.
  But presently her rug slipped, and she felt it replaced with firm, skillful
  hands. She thanked him&mdash;almost shyly for her&mdash;and they began to
  talk.</p>

  <p>Their conversation took its tedious but necessary course through the
  desert of the commonplace, but long before the dinner bell rang the
  probationary period was past. He had learned that she was the Miss Ursula
  Bateman whom New York society papers loved to allude to as the prototype of
  the modern American young woman of fashion. She was tired of Newport and
  Lennox, and, although she did not tell him so, she was also tired of being
  ceaselessly importuned to marry one or another of a goodly number of eager
  young men. She was an orphan and her own mistress. In a moment of inspiration
  she had planned this flight, a Continental tour amongst the unvisited places
  of Europe with an elderly aunt of purely negative tendencies. She was very
  enthusiastic over her escape.</p>

  <p>"You can't imagine how it feels," she told him, as they leaned over the
  rail together to watch a shoal of porpoises, "to be really free from it all
  for a month or two, at any rate. We're too much in earnest over our pleasure.
  We make a business of it, as we do of everything else."</p>

  <p>He looked at her with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to see," he said gravely, "that you have emerged from the
  holocaust without any ineffaceable signs of the struggle."</p>

  <p>She laughed good-humoredly.</p>

  <p>"Oh! I know what you're thinking," she exclaimed; "but it isn't in the
  face alone one carries the marks of deterioration."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," he answered thoughtfully. "Yet the face is a wonderful
  index."</p>

  <p>She turned and surveyed him coolly.</p>

  <p>"You would trust your own impressions of a face, then? It would be
  sufficient for you?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," he answered. "Corroborating evidence would, of course, be
  reassuring."</p>

  <p>"But suppose the evidences&mdash;all appearances were against your
  impressions, which should you rely upon?" she persisted.</p>

  <p>"I dare say I should find it hard to make up my mind," he admitted.</p>

  <p>She nodded and brushed back the hair from her forehead.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly how I feel," she said, turning and walking back to her
  chair.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>At dinner-time she was in unusual spirits. She increased at every moment
  the circle of her admirers. She sat at the captain's table, and everyone
  seemed to catch a little of the reflected glory of her bright sayings and
  infectious laughter. But someone asked her a question, about half way through
  the meal, which for a moment checked her flow of spirits.</p>

  <p>"Who was the man who turned us all out this afternoon, Miss Bateman? We
  can't put up with that sort of thing all the way over, you know. No one man
  has a right to two whole interrupted hours alone with you&mdash;not even the
  President of the United States!"</p>

  <p>"His name is Geoffrey Paish," she answered. "I really don't know much more
  about him than that."</p>

  <p>The name awakened plenty of interest.</p>

  <p>"Why, he's the fellow," someone eagerly exclaimed, "who's come in for the
  whole of the Paish estate. The old man was a banker in New York, you
  know&mdash;his uncle, I think it was. Mighty queer family, too."</p>

  <p>"The old man died worth seven millions," the boy who sat on her left hand
  remarked enviously. "Nice little pile for him to step into."</p>

  <p>"Did anyone ever hear of this Geoffrey Paish at college or anywhere?"
  asked Andrew Bliss, the man who sat opposite her.</p>

  <p>No one had. A man from little higher up the table leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"There were some very queer stories going about New York concerning this
  young man only last week," he remarked.</p>

  <p>The girl caught him up sharply.</p>

  <p>"There are queer stories about everyone," she said, "if people care to
  listen to them. Let us talk about something else."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>She was a little later than the others when she came up on deck after
  dinner. As usual, she wore no hat or wrap of any sort. The wind blew her fair
  hair about her face, and she was obliged to gather up and hold the skirts of
  her black dinner-gown. Several young men came hurrying toward her, but she
  waved them away. She crossed the deck to where the man was sitting. He had
  just finished a frugal dinner which had been brought out to him by his
  servant.</p>

  <p>"Will you come for a little walk?" she said. "I should like to go out to
  the bows."</p>

  <p>He rose at once and led the way. The journey to the fore-part of the ship
  was a little devious, and once, after a moment's hesitation, he offered her
  his hand.</p>

  <p>She took it frankly, and a sudden rush of colour came into his cheeks. The
  willing touch of her fingers possessed a certain significance for him.</p>

  <p>They leaned over the white railings, and the fresh breeze blew strong and
  salt in their faces. She stood quite close to him.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to come here," she said, "because we are safe against
  interruption. There is something which I have to say to you."</p>

  <p>He moistened his dry lips. His interjection was scarcely audible.</p>

  <p>"I was telling you only this afternoon," she said, "how monotonous my life
  had been. I seem to have been moving along the plane all the time. But once,
  for a few minutes, things were different. I had what I suppose people would
  call an adventure. It was while I was staying in Virginia with an
  aunt&mdash;not this one. I do not think that I will tell you the name of the
  place."</p>

  <p>"Don't!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"It was a large, old-fashioned house, very low, and my room was on the
  first floor, only a few feet from the ground. One night we had a dance there.
  I fell asleep in my chair afterwards, leaving my jewels scattered about the
  dressing-room. When I woke up, there was a man in the room calmly filling his
  pockets with them."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," he interrupted, "but I hope you are noticing the
  phosphorus."</p>

  <p>"We will talk about the phosphorus afterwards," she continued equably. "I
  suppose the slight noise I made disturbed him, and he wheeled suddenly round.
  He was a tall man and he wore a mask."</p>

  <p>"A mask! Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Which afterwards slipped," she continued. "Just at that moment all I
  could think of was that I was looking into the muzzle of a revolver.</p>

  <p><a id="pic8"
     name="pic8"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1203441h-images/FTQ04-1.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Of course you were not frightened?" he remarked, with a queer little
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," she answered him.</p>

  <p>"I looked upon the revolver as a sort of harmless but necessary toy. At
  that moment I had no fear. But afterward&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shivered.</p>

  <p>"Let me fetch you a cloak," he begged. "The breeze is too strong
  here."</p>

  <p>"I am not cold," she answered calmly. "It was a memory. But to go on with
  my story. Naturally I asked the man what he was doing in my room, and as
  naturally he pointed to what were left of my jewels. For a burglar he was a
  terrible bungler. The hand which held his revolver shook so that I could have
  knocked it out of his hand."</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "I've got to have some of these. It's life or death
  to me. I'm very sorry."</p>

  <p>"I told him that he was welcome to all of them, that I was quite tired of
  them, and dying to get some new ones. I warned him of the bloodhounds, and
  told him of the nearest way to the State Road. And all the time he stood
  looking at me in a queer sort of way. I was absolutely certain that the man
  would never harm me. Perhaps I took advantage of my conviction. I began to
  laugh at him for his clumsiness. The man got mad. The first part of the whole
  thing ended very much as I had imagined it would. He threw down the jewels
  and made for the window. He was clumsy with the fastening, and I got up and
  helped him. It was then that his mask slipped. It was then also, for the
  first time, that the burglar misbehaved himself."</p>

  <p>Again that queer little smile. The man looked up from the tumbling mass of
  cloven waters into the face of his companion.</p>

  <p>"What did he do?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I shall not tell you," she answered severely. "Only, I think that I would
  rather have lost my jewels."</p>

  <p>"You are not sure about it?" he demanded eagerly.</p>

  <p>"It is not a matter which concerns you, is it?" she asked innocently.</p>

  <p>He did not reply, and when she spoke again, her tone was graver.</p>

  <p>"The comedy ended there, the tragedy began a few seconds later. The man
  was met upon the lawn by a confederate. There was a quarrel between them,
  presumably because the burglar declared that he had no jewels to share. I
  heard the second man declare that he would give his companion up to the
  police and earn the reward offered for his apprehension. I shouted to them
  softly to go away. They did not hear. Then I think that the second man
  decided to break into my room himself. I am surprised that he did not think
  of it before. It was absurdly easy. They quarreled. I could see that the
  first man was determined to stop him. Then there was the shooting. I saw it
  all. I could not move. I was terrified to death. They carried the second man
  into the house. I saw him clutch at the air and fall. It was horrible. The
  other man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"He escaped. It was wonderful, but he escaped."</p>

  <p>The man by her side touched his forehead lightly. There were great drops
  of moisture there, though the wind was still blowing about them.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he said.</p>

  <p>"The mask slipped," she murmured. "I have never forgotten his face for a
  single second."</p>

  <p>They stood side by side, and the young men on the promenade-deck grumbled.
  The strains of shuffling feet came to them from the steerage. Then the man
  began to laugh softly, but very bitterly, as he tore open his coat.</p>

  <p>"You think that he did not rob you&mdash;at all," he said. "You were
  wrong! See!"</p>

  <p>It was a cracked and bent little ring of very thin gold, holding a single
  moonstone. He drew it from an inner pocket and held it out to her.</p>

  <p>"You took that?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"That&mdash;and a memory," he said, looking into her face, "were the sole
  proceeds of my little attempt."</p>

  <p>Her cheeks flushed a fiery red.</p>

  <p>"How dare you remind me of that!" she exclaimed. "And I have always wanted
  to tell you&mdash;you took me by surprise, or I should have called out. Of
  course I should have called out."</p>

  <p>He bowed.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I believe it. I took you by storm. All my life, I
  think&mdash;bah! What folly is this! I am quite ready, Miss Bateman."</p>

  <p>"Ready?"</p>

  <p>"You will tell the captain, of course, I shall not make any resistance. I
  always fancied that this would come some day, although I never thought that
  you would be concerned in it. I shall not deny anything. I had broken out of
  prison with the man Willard, and I shot him."</p>

  <p>"Did you think that I was going to give you up?" she asked, looking at him
  with wide-open eyes.</p>

  <p>"Of course. Why not? It is your duty," he answered.</p>

  <p>"My duty?" she repeated.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he answered. "It will be quite simple. I shall deny
  nothing."</p>

  <p>She was silent for a moment, leaning over the rails with her head resting
  upon her hands.</p>

  <p>"Please to go away," she said to him. "I want to be quite alone&mdash;to
  think!"</p>

  <p>He left her without a word.</p>

  <h4>II.</h4>

  <p>"Sure?"</p>

  <p>"Dead sure. We've got him, Jake. It's a thousand dollars sure."</p>

  <p>The girl turned her head cautiously. She saw the red tips of two cigars.
  She herself was out of sight behind a ventilator.</p>

  <p>"Pity we had to take the trip," the first voice remarked. "We could have
  nabbed him in New York."</p>

  <p>"I guess we're all right, anyway," was the answer. "An ocean trip won't do
  either of us any harm, and I wasn't taking any risks."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's pause. The girl felt herself shaking from head to
  foot.</p>

  <p>"What bothers me is how he has managed to escape detection all this time,"
  one of the men remarked.</p>

  <p>"Guess everybody thought he was a pauper," the other answered. "Nobody
  thought of looking for him amongst the millionaires."</p>

  <p>"Sure! Old man Paish left him all his pile. I forgot that."</p>

  <p>"Guess he'll try and square this thing. He's been clever enough at keeping
  out of the way. He won't fancy being dropped on just as he's off."</p>

  <p>"Won't do," was the terse answer. "Besides, it won't pay us. This is a big
  thing!"</p>

  <p>The men moved on, the girl lingered there. Her eyes were fixed upon
  vacancy. This was to be the end of it, then. A prison cell, perhaps worse. A
  sudden shriek of the foghorn broke in upon her thoughts. They had steamed
  right into the midst of a dense bank of white sea mist. Under cover of the
  gray floating shadows she stole away to her state-room and locked the
  door.</p>

  <p>Almost before the decks were dry the next morning she was out, and,
  curiously enough, she found him the only other early riser. A fresh, strong
  wind was blowing salt and vigorous, and the white spray was leaping high into
  the dazzling sunshine. She held on to the rail, and he came at once to her
  side.</p>

  <p>"You see, I am not yet in irons," he said, with an attempt at gaiety which
  went ill with his beringed eyes and white cheeks. "What have I to thank for
  this respite?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him in the face, and the breath seemed to die away in his
  body.</p>

  <p>"I think," she said quietly, "that you know very
  well&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The wonder of it kept him speechless, motionless. There was something in
  her face which he had never seen in any other woman's. He felt like a man
  mocked by a mirage of impossible joys. It was surely a miracle, this. He
  could not find any words, but for a moment their hands were clasped
  together.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to speak to you," she said hurriedly. "There are one or two
  things which I must ask you."</p>

  <p>"You shall ask me whatever you will, and I will answer you truly," he
  assured her.</p>

  <p>"Are you really Geoffrey Paish?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You are very rich, then?"</p>

  <p>"Very."</p>

  <p>"Why did you break into my room?"</p>

  <p>"I had just escaped from prison. I needed money to get away."</p>

  <p>"And you were in prison for&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"For nothing I ever did. Please believe that. It is my only excuse for
  many things."</p>

  <p>"I want to believe it," she answered simply. "I certainly shall, if you
  tell me so. Tell me what your plans are now?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"My fortune," he said, "was a tardy recompense for the act of injustice
  which sent me to prison. I know that I risked a great deal in coming forward
  to claim it, but I had had enough of poverty. I was never known in my younger
  days by the name of Paish, and I have had a fever lately, which has altered
  me. I decided to risk it. I thought that if I could once reach Europe safely,
  I could find a dozen hiding-places."</p>

  <p>Her eyes filled with tears.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," she said, "that you will not reach Europe safely."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you will give me up?" he asked quietly. "It is your
  duty."</p>

  <p>"You know very well that I shall not," she answered. "But there are others
  here on board, following you."</p>

  <p>She told him of the conversation which she had overheard. He listened
  intently.</p>

  <p>"I know the two men," he remarked. "I have seen them watching me."</p>

  <p>"You must try and make terms with them," she suggested, eagerly. "Those
  sort of men are to be bribed, are they not?"</p>

  <p>"Generally," he answered; "and yet, after all, I am not sure that it is
  worth while. I shall be hunted from corner to corner of the earth all my
  life. I shall bring disrepute and scandal upon my friends. Nothing worth
  having in life will be possible for me. I think that I will not struggle any
  more against fate."</p>

  <p>"You must not talk like that," she answered. "You are a young man, and you
  should have a long life before you."</p>

  <p>He laughed bitterly.</p>

  <p>"The life behind has been too long!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>She dropped her voice.</p>

  <p>"For my sake," she whispered.</p>

  <p>Again he looked at her in amazement. He was still weak from his fever, for
  his hands were trembling.</p>

  <p>"You cannot mean&mdash;that you really care?" he said, in a low tone.</p>

  <p>She smiled encouragement upon him. The breakfast-gong had sounded, and
  they were no longer alone.</p>

  <p>"Should I be here if I did not?" she whispered.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>She played shuffleboard badly that morning, for only a few yards away
  Geoffrey Paish and two men were sitting together and talking earnestly. Their
  chairs were pulled almost to the rail; their heads were close together. It
  was not possible for her to hear a word of their conversation, yet she found
  her attention continually diverted toward them. At last the two men departed.
  Geoffrey Paish was left alone. He sat with unseeing eyes fixed upon the sky
  line. She came softly to him.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"The men are honest," he answered. "They are not to be bribed. I have
  offered them half my fortune."</p>

  <p>She reeled for a moment and then sat down in one of the empty chairs.</p>

  <p>"What are we to do?" she murmured. "Oh! what can we do?"</p>

  <p>"For you," he answered, "there is only one thing. You must forget. Our
  acquaintance must end here. We may renew it, perhaps&mdash;in the
  police-court."</p>

  <p>She looked at him reproachfully. He was instantly ashamed of himself.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," he whispered; "but indeed I scarcely know what I am saying.
  Either I am a little mad, or those two men were. They talked like
  lunatics."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He laughed shortly.</p>

  <p>"Well, they seemed to think that the notoriety I should gain would be a
  sort of recompense for any minor inconveniences such as imprisonment, for
  instance, which I might have to undergo. They talked of the whole affair as a
  capital joke, and they seemed amazed that I should have attempted to keep my
  secret at all."</p>

  <p>She shuddered a little.</p>

  <p>"That is the American of it," she exclaimed bitterly.</p>

  <p>He looked cautiously around. Her chair was behind a boat. He took her
  fingers into his.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to adopt your philosophy," he whispered. "Let us make the most
  of these few days."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Of course, all sorts of stories went around. The one most favoured by
  their fellow-passengers, and which she herself had certainly encouraged, was
  that they were old friends who had parted years ago under some
  misunderstanding. No one else ventured to claim even a share of her time. The
  colour came back to his cheeks; his step upon the deck became positively
  buoyant. No one would have guessed anything of the shadow which lurked behind
  their apparent gaiety. Now and then they came across the two detectives,
  whose greeting was always perfectly respectful. He laughed once with a
  momentary bitterness as he returned their bow.</p>

  <p>"What a devil's comedy!" he murmured.</p>

  <p>Her fingers touched his, and the bitterness fled away.</p>

  <p>"You are a witch," he declared.</p>

  <p>At Queenstown she found Hoyle, the senior of the two men, in the saloon
  writing cablegrams, with a messenger at his side. He had covered them with
  his hand at her approach.</p>

  <p>"You are determined to send those, Mr. Hoyle?" she said.</p>

  <p>"I have no alternative, Miss Bateman," he answered.</p>

  <p>"I, too, am rich," she said hesitatingly, "and I am engaged to Mr.
  Paish."</p>

  <p>"Delighted to hear it," Hoyle answered heartily. "You mustn't let him get
  downhearted. Most of the men in the world would enjoy a little affair like
  this." (he tapped the cablegrams). "I guess it won't do him any harm in the
  long run. You'll excuse me now, Miss Bateman."</p>

  <p>He was busy with another cable. She made her way on deck again. Only once
  during the rest of the way to Liverpool did she address the detective
  again.</p>

  <p>"I want you to tell me," she said, stopping suddenly in front of his
  chair, "is&mdash;will&mdash;have you sent word to Liverpool?"</p>

  <p>"Well," he answered slowly, "I guess so. I hated to do it, Miss Bateman,
  with you both so set against it; but there wasn't any use in bottling it up.
  I shouldn't be surprised if something didn't happen to Mr. Paish in
  Liverpool."</p>

  <p>"At the docks?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"At the docks," he answered.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Early the next morning came their farewell. She drew him behind one of the
  boats and pressed her lips passionately to his. She dared not trust herself
  to words. Then he went overboard into the gray mists and was lost to sight in
  a moment.</p>

  <p><a id="pic10"

  <p>Twelve hours later he was shown into a sitting-room at the small private
  hotel which they had selected as their rendezvous. He was properly dressed,
  but he had the appearance of a man grown suddenly younger. His smile, as she
  rushed into his arms, was a trifle apologetic.</p>

  <p>"You have seen the papers?" she cried.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I must have been the densest of idiots!" he exclaimed. "I couldn't see
  what Hoyle was driving at all the time; and I suppose my head was full of the
  other thing."</p>

  <p>"And all the time," she cried, half laughing, half sobbing, "you were a
  hero, and I didn't know it. You were the man who saved the President's life
  at Metrofuzo, and for whose discovery he offered a thousand dollars
  reward."</p>

  <p>"It came my way," he said. "You can imagine that I was a bit reckless just
  then, and odds didn't scare me much."</p>

  <p>She wiped the tears from her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You have made yourself the laughingstock of the country, sir," she
  declared. "Fancy jumping overboard, even though it was in the river, to
  escape being lionised and interviewed! Why, it will be worse than ever now,
  when they do find you out."</p>

  <p>He sighed.</p>

  <p>"They mustn't find me," he said. "You forget, Ursula, the other affair
  remains."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Pooh!" she exclaimed. "I guess the President will have to settle that for
  you. It isn't as though the man had died, you know."</p>

  <p>He turned toward her suddenly.</p>

  <p>"What? Say that again."</p>

  <p>His voice sounded strange and harsh. He was suddenly pale again.</p>

  <p>"I thought you knew," she murmured. "We took care of the man, and he got
  well. They took him back to prison."</p>

  <p>He sat down heavily.</p>

  <p>"And I," he said, "I carried with me all the way to Cuba, all through the
  fighting, and through many sleepless nights, that dead man's face! Great
  Heavens! Not dead! I never saw a newspaper. I never doubted but that he was
  dead. Not dead!"</p>

  <p>He was trembling. She came and sank down by his side.</p>

  <p>"If you hadn't met me," she murmured, "you would have never known."</p>

  <p>He took her into his arms.</p>

  <p>"Ursula," he said, "I am a free man. I can prove myself innocent of the
  thing they sent me to prison for. It was Paish's son who stole the bonds. He
  found it out, and that is why he left me his money. His son died in Cuba. I
  have his confession."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you glad," she murmured, "that the mask slipped?"</p>

  <p>He slipped a battered little ring on to her finger.</p>

  <p>"After all," he remarked, "I wasn't such a clumsy burglar."</p><br>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5">V.&mdash;IN AN OXFORDSHIRE LANE</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of magazine publication found</h3>

  <p class="first">IT IS a very common saying that every man has his hobby.
  Certainly, I have mine. There is nothing which pleases me so well as suddenly
  to transfer the cares and responsibilities of business on to the broad and
  steady shoulders of my junior partner, to don a rough walking-suit, and,
  strapping a knapsack upon my back, to disappear for a while from the dingy
  offices in Lincoln's Inn and from the civilized world generally, leaving no
  address behind me, and, indeed, very undecided myself, at starting, into
  which part of the country to make my leisurely way.</p>

  <p>It is seldom that I wander far, however; for, strange though it may seem,
  the quiet nooks and corners of England are far more to my taste than the
  overrun Continental haunts of millionaire stockbrokers and Chicago pig-
  stickers. Two months, at least out of every twelve for twenty-five years have
  I spent in gaining my knowledge of them, and there are still enough left to
  keep me in my native land; so many indeed, that, unless I live to a
  phenomenal age, I shall not live long enough to visit them all: and until
  then I shall not seek to enlarge my mind or recruit my health by foreign
  travel. Why should I? I am a man of simple taste, and I enjoy my evening meal
  at a wayside inn or farmhouse far more than I should the many-coursed dinner
  of a fashionable hotel. Not only that, but I am even insane enough to find as
  much beauty, if not equal magnificence, in a Devonshire lane or a
  Westmoreland farm as in the snow-capped mountains of the Alps or the silvery
  lakes of Italy. It is no doubt owing to the simplicity of my tastes and
  disposition that I feel so much more in touch with our own humbler scenery;
  but certain it is, and I am never ashamed to own it, that the pure air, the
  quiet, the familiarity with the phases of the landscape, and the being in
  perfect accord with my surroundings have a more soothing and pleasing effect
  upon me than any association with the more magnificent and luxuriously
  developed sights of other lands. I do not wish to scale the lofty peaks of
  the Himalayas or the Rocky Mountains, nor do I greatly desire to gaze upon
  the pristine beauties of New Zealand or the glories of the tropics. Their
  grandeur would, no doubt, arouse my wonder and impel my admiration; but they
  would have no such pleasing effect upon me as a day's ramble through a
  picturesque corner of England. I should feel awe at their majesty; but awe is
  not pleasure or peace, and these I find in the contemplation of humbler and
  more accessible beauties. In another respect, too, I am somewhat singular. I
  prefer to travel alone. "How dull you must be!" every one whom I meet
  remarks. Not a bit of it. In my solitary rambles I am never dull. It is in
  London, surrounded by all my friends, dining at my club amidst a host of
  acquaintances, elbowing my way to the stalls on the first night of a new
  play&mdash; it is then that I am often dull. Society makes me dull; my own
  society never. This sounds egotistical, but it is true. I am neither poet,
  student, nor dreamer, but I can extract such pleasure from the contemplation
  of and communion with nature as another's society would mar. I tried a
  companion once. He was the most silent man I had ever met, and the dullest
  and most sedate amongst my acquaintance; but he was a complete failure. As
  soon as we were well in the country his dullness vanished, as if by magic,
  and he became facetiously and extravagantly gay. He cracked jokes with the
  farmers, made fun of the simple country people, and in his leviathan
  frivolity I actually once caught him making love to a milk-maid. He talked
  unceasingly of all things under the sun. Legal gossip he retailed by the
  hour, and gave me his own views at considerable length on all the prominent
  cases, civil and criminal, then pending. On Skiddaw, at four o'clock in the
  morning, while we watched the sun slowly emerge from its gorgeous bank of
  clouds and scatter its glory all over the eastern skies, he persisted in
  explaining to me the flaw in the counsel's defence re Smith v. Banks; and
  when late one night I slipped out from our cottage resting-place to gaze upon
  Coniston Lake, glittering all over with the silvery sparkle of the full moon,
  and encircled by the dim, spectral-like hills, amongst which the "old man"
  towered in sullen majesty, I found him at my elbow explaining the true reason
  of the rejection of the Ambleside Railway Bill. As time went on he grew
  worse, and speedily developed into the most irrepressible chatterbox I ever
  had the misfortune to meet. I stood it for a week, and then arranged for a
  telegram requiring my immediate return to town. Since that time I have never
  sought for a companion.</p>

  <p>October and November are not generally favourite months for a walking
  tour, but they are mine. I do not care for a glaring sun, for a sky uniform
  and monotonous in its blueness, for dusty roads, a fierce light, and
  oppressive air. Give me a fine November afternoon, when the air is soft, yet
  crisp; the turf soft and yielding, not dry and dusty; the sky grey, and not
  blue. No longer does the sun oppress and burn in its monotonous heat, and its
  warm rays are now grateful and welcome, and the universal greenness of hedges
  and trees have given way to a magnificent combination of tints and
  shadings&mdash;orange, lemon, blood-red, and purple&mdash;which the painter
  loves to attempt to reproduce, and well he may. On such an afternoon ten
  years ago, my knapsack on my back and grasping a stout holly stick, I trudged
  along an Oxfordshire lane, and watched the sun&mdash;a glowing ball of red
  fire&mdash;sink slowly behind the Gloucestershire hills. An autumn sunset on
  a clear day is a sight to arrest any one's footsteps, nor was I loth when I
  reached a convenient spot to pause for a while, for I had already exceeded my
  usual daily distance. With a sigh of relief I unslung my knapsack, and,
  lighting my pipe&mdash;the inseparable companion of my travels&mdash;I leaned
  over a gate and gazed across the landscape of dark-soiled, freshly-ploughed
  fields, bounded by moss-incrusted grey stone walls, of rich-hued meadow land,
  of wooded knolls, and of snug-looking red-tiled farmhouses, becoming more
  patchworky and obscure as the distance increased, and bounded right away to
  the west by that long dark line of hills, behind which the glowing disc of
  the sun was slowly disappearing. It sank down and vanished out of sight; but
  the afterglow, the deep orange sky, and the rarefied air, which showed me as
  clearly as though they had been in the next field, instead of many miles
  away, the shape, and, indeed, the very boughs, of the trees on the summit of
  the hills, kept me gazing for a while in unlessened admiration.</p>

  <p>I am a middle-aged-man, a lawyer, whose life has been spent in the
  compilation and consideration of facts, and whose life has had in it nothing
  of the romantic or fanciful. No one amongst my city acquaintances would dream
  of calling me sentimental or impressionable; nor, indeed, am I. And yet
  whenever in my solitary rambles I witness this, one of Nature's grandest
  efforts, I feel almost drawn out of myself and my humdrum life. Forgetful of
  my fatigue and absorbed by the scene, I lingered at the gate until the deep
  orange hue faded into a dull grey, and the shades of an autumnal evening
  rapidly descending blotted out the view; and then, made conscious of the
  growing lateness of the hour by the increased stirring of the chilly evening
  breeze, I turned away, shook the stiffness from my knees, and, buckling on my
  knapsack, started off to conclude my day's journey, feeling at peace with all
  mankind, and, to tell the truth, desperately hungry.</p>

  <p>I had scarcely proceeded a hundred yards before I overtook two other
  pedestrians, one of whom, as I was passing, accosted me.</p>

  <p>"Can I trouble you for a light, sir?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>I slackened my pace, and, while I felt in my pockets for the required
  article, glanced with some interest at the inquirer. The question was an
  ordinary one enough, but the voice, full deep and yet with just a suspicion
  of affectation, was decidedly out of the common, and so it seemed to me,
  after a brief examination, was the man who had proffered this simple request.
  He was short, but stout and thickset, holding himself well together&mdash;so
  well, indeed, that, notwithstanding his tired and travel stained appearance,
  there was still perceptible a slight jauntiness and tendency to swagger in
  his gait and bearing. His eyes, small, but keen and bright, were twinkling
  with a perpetual merriment, and the ever-twitching corners of his mouth
  betrayed a decided weakness of the risible muscles. He was dressed somewhat
  oddly, in a brown check suit, which appeared to have seen better days, and
  round his neck&mdash;collar he had none&mdash;was twisted a red silk
  kerchief, carefully tied. His hat, likewise brown, and rather battered, was a
  trifle on one side, and increased the rakishness of his general appearance;
  but I noticed with surprise that his hands (one was extended for the desired
  light, the other was pressing down the tobacco into the spacious bowl of a
  well-coloured meerschaum) were small and shapely. His companion, a tall dark
  young man, stood aloof, with a frown on his well-arched eyebrows, idly
  kicking the pebbles out of his way and glancing round more than once with an
  impatient yet weary gesture, as if fretting at the slight delay. I could see
  very little of him, but he stood with his back to me, and I was more
  interested in the man who had addressed me. The latter accepted my matchbox
  with a little bow of thanks, struck a light, and then, after puffing away at
  his pipe for a moment or two with an air of great satisfaction, returned me
  the box.</p>

  <p>"I am exceedingly obliged to you, sir," he said, in the same not
  unpleasant voice; "I have been longing for a smoke, but unfortunately had no
  light, and never a soul have we passed on this road for three miles. A
  somewhat lonely part of the country, sir, think you not? How far might it be
  to Chipping Norton?"</p>

  <p>The merry black eyes were twinkling and the corners of his mouth
  twitching, as if in the joint fact of there existing at all such a place as
  Chipping Norton and his being bound for it lay the most capital joke in the
  world. The sort of man this to force you, <i>nolens volens</i>, into a good
  temper, whatever lack of comfort there might be in the surroundings.</p>

  <p>I pointed to the twinkling lights which lay down in the valley before us.
  "There it lies&mdash;two miles by yonder milestone. Our ways are the same,
  then," I added, moving forward.</p>

  <p>"I am exceedingly obliged, sir. Do you hear that, Phil?" he went on,
  addressing his companion cheerfully; "two more miles and our little
  tr-er-tour is ended, and I for one shall not be sorry."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," returned the young man shortly; and, moving a little way into the
  road to give us more room, he marched on in gloomy silence.</p>

  <p>The man at my side was evidently more inclined for conversation.</p>

  <p>"A glorious day it has been for walking, sir," he commenced, addressing
  me, and rattling on without waiting for my assent; "just the day for a good
  tramp. I'm not at all sure that walking is my favourite exercise, though," he
  added confidentially. "My friend there and I have done close upon thirty five
  miles to-day. Looks pretty well knocked up, don't he? I'm not tired, not a
  bit. I'm never tired, but all the same I'm beginning to feel as though I'd
  had about enough exercise for one day, you know. We've had the pull of you in
  one way," he remarked, tapping my knapsack. "I never could stand those
  things. Our baggage went on by train this morning to Chipping Norton. How far
  have you come today, sir? if I might make so bold as to ask; and are you
  going any farther?"</p>

  <p>I had come from Oxford, I told him, and I purposed spending the night at
  Chipping Norton. I had been here once before, I added, in response to a
  further question.</p>

  <p>"Ah, h'm! Happen to know the theatre?" Theatre! No, I had never heard of
  the Chipping Norton theatre. Was he sure that there was one? I inquired
  dubiously.</p>

  <p>Certainly he was.</p>

  <p>"It's very likely a barn, though," he added briskly. "Not that it's the
  worse for that, if it isn't a draughty one, eh? Now I daresay you're
  wondering who the deuce we are, aren't you?" he asked abruptly, intercepting
  a curious glance of mine at his silent companion.</p>

  <p>I hesitated, and was framing an ambiguous reply, for which he did not
  wait, however.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you. We're missionaries."</p>

  <p>"Missionaries! I should scarcely have thought it," I told him, with
  perhaps a little incredulity in my tone, and a good deal in my mind.</p>

  <p>"Ha! ha! ha!" and the little man broke out into peals of the merriest
  laughter I ever heard. "Missionaries of art, sir, that's what we are. The
  rivals of the Kyrle Society in the elevation of the masses, the pupils and
  disciples of a master artistically divine, the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In plain words, sir, we are strolling players," broke in the young man
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>His companion did not seem in the least annoyed at this sudden
  interruption.</p>

  <p>"My dear Phil," he exclaimed deprecatingly, "why will you describe our
  noble profession in such brutally coarse terms? I was about to explain to
  this gentleman that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That we act damnably in any little hole of a town where the people are
  fools enough to spend their spare coppers in coming to see us," broke in the
  younger man again.</p>

  <p>His companion, not in the least annoyed, turned to me with a shrug of his
  shoulders and a confidential smile, as though he would have said, "Don't mind
  the poor fellow; he's mad."</p>

  <p>"He's rather tired," he explained apologetically. "You see, we've had a
  longish tramp; all his own fault, too&mdash;he would walk. The ladies of our
  company we shall meet here; they have preceded us by train: also, as I before
  observed, our baggage."</p>

  <p>The younger man's lip curled, but he made no further observation. Just
  then we came to the first lamp-post, and I caught a glimpse of his face. Once
  he must have been very handsome, I decided; but what a wreck he was now, poor
  fellow! One could understand the bitterness of his tone, for suffering and
  want were indelibly impressed upon his careworn countenance. His features
  were pinched and hardened, and a dull light shone in his eyes. I had a pretty
  shrewd suspicion as to the reason for this "walking tour," and it turned out
  to be correct. We had entered the main street of the little town, and had
  come to a halt outside the inn.</p>

  <p>"You are not going to put up here, then?" I remarked, rather disappointed;
  for while my elder friend hesitated, his companion, with a brief good night,
  walked on a pace or two, and glanced round impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Well-er, no. The fact is," he continued, beaming all over, as if he were
  about to recite some most excellent joke, "our chancellor of the exchequer
  intimated this morning that, after the tickets for the ladies had been taken
  and several other expenses defrayed, there remained the not inexhaustible sum
  of eighteen-pence in the treasury. Ninepence of that we had, and in a fit of
  unpardonable extravagance we spent it on the way. The remainder we left in
  the chancellor's possession, in case the ladies needed any refreshments. So
  you see that until after tomorrow's performance," he concluded, with keenly
  twinkling eyes, as though he thoroughly relished the situation, "we are just
  a trifle short."</p>

  <p>I intimated as delicately as possible, and with considerable earnestness,
  that I should be delighted to entertain my new friends if they would dine
  with me, and without hesitation the elder one accepted.</p>

  <p>"Don't apologize for the shortness of the invitation, sir, I beg of you,"
  he burst out cheerily. "Come along, Phil my boy; I'm simply ravenous, and our
  fellow-traveller here, like a good Samaritan, invites us to dine with him. I
  don't mind accepting your hospitality, sir; not a bit of it! I'm not proud.
  Your turn to-day, mine to-morrow. I've done as much for others many a time,
  and no one can say that Dick Andrews isn't as free to give as to take when
  he's able. Come, Phil!" But the younger man hung back, muttering something
  about not feeling hungry.</p>

  <p>"Pray come," I begged him earnestly. "I mean to get a quid pro quo from
  you, after all. If I find our friend here in a good temper after dinner, I
  shall try and get a pass out of him for your performance this evening. Come,
  I'll take no refusal." And between us he had to yield.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Ah! what a comfortable inn that was! and, doubtless, is now,
  if it is not spoilt by the inroads of bagmen and commercials. There were none
  came to Chipping Norton then, and we had the parlour&mdash; they were
  ignorant of the term coffee-room&mdash;to ourselves. Dinner, after all, we
  had none, for there was only an hour before my guests had to meet the "ladies
  of the company," and proceed to the scene of their performance; so we ordered
  tea, and a better tea we could not have had. There were dark brown new-laid
  eggs, broiled ham, clotted cream, clear marmalade, rich butter, and
  fine-flavoured tea. Could epicure desire a more satisfactory meal? Apparently
  my guests thought not. For the first time during our brief acquaintance, the
  elder one's tongue ceased to wag, and his companion, notwithstanding his plea
  of non-hunger, was clearly famished. After the first few minutes, however,
  the former managed to combine the two processes of talking and eating, and
  once started he chattered away incessantly. He was the manager, it seemed, of
  the little company, and his companion "first walking gentleman," whatever
  that means.</p>

  <p>Tragedy he much preferred to comedy (how is it, I wonder, that a short,
  jolly-looking man always prefers tragedy?), but they were playing a
  miscellaneous lot of pieces, he told me. There was a drama, the name of which
  I have forgotten, down on the programme for that evening, to be followed by a
  farce. I had been lately at Stratford-on-Avon, and the very mention of the
  place set me off on a new tack. Shakespeare, he informed me, was the greatest
  poet that ever lived, but as a dramatist he was nowhere.</p>

  <p>"I've tried 'em all," he assured me vigorously, "from As You Like It to
  Hamlet, and every time it's been a dead failure. Why, I've played Hamlet to
  pretty well empty benches more than once." I fancied that I could detect the
  ghost of a smile in the younger man's face, and I myself with difficulty
  refrained from joining in it. Mr. Andrews, however, was absolutely
  unconscious.</p>

  <p>"The stage, sir," he continued&mdash;"thanks, I'll take a little more of
  that ham. Delicious, isn't it? &mdash;the stage, sir, as I was saying,
  requires an entire remodelling. There are those at the very top of the
  profession who haven't the least right there, and there are others nearer the
  bottom&mdash;I include myself in that category," he added modestly&mdash;
  "who want a leg up. Not that I despise the career of the nomad actor, mind;
  far from it. He has a mission in the world, sir, if any one has. He has a
  mission, most decidedly."</p>

  <p>It occurred to me that the present mission of this particular "nomad
  actor" appeared to be to consume as much ham and as many eggs as he could in
  a given space of time. I could not help thinking, as I watched him, of
  certain animals whose digestive organs are such that they can at one time lay
  in stock for a week. What a mercy for the peace of mind of our landlady that
  the same idea did not occur to her!</p>

  <p>"These amateurs do us no end of harm in some of the towns," he continued,
  pausing only to pour himself out another cup of tea. "You see, people will go
  to see their friends make fools of themselves, and enjoy that quite as much,
  or even more, than seeing us professionals act; and you should just see our
  audiences sometimes, eh, Phil? Not that I care a fig where I act or before
  whom. I'd just as soon act in this barn here this evening as at Drury Lane or
  the Lyceum, if only the audience like it and applaud. That's the thing that
  satisfies me&mdash; appreciation. If I can see every one in front looking
  pleased and interested, I'm happy. I'm not ambitious; never was. As long as
  I've got plenty to eat and drink and money enough to buy me an ounce of
  honey-dew, I'm all right. Now, my young friend here&mdash;just pass the
  butter, will you, Phil? &mdash; he's never satisfied. To look at him any one
  would imagine that he was sick of his profession, wouldn't they?"</p>

  <p>"As if I wasn't!" he remarked. He spoke in a low tone, full of bitterness.
  "I'm sick and tired of it. I detest it, and it detests me."</p>

  <p>He pushed his plate away from him, and strolled to the window with a weary
  gesture. My <i>vis-à-vis</i> followed his movement with a pitying glance in
  his eyes, but he suffered none of it to creep into his tone.</p>

  <p>"Never quarrel with your bread and cheese, young man," he remarked
  sententiously. "If you do it may quarrel with you some day. Take things as
  they come, if you can't alter them. That's the only philosophy worth
  remembering."</p>

  <p>The young man turned abruptly away from the window and walked to the
  door.</p>

  <p>"I'm going down to the station now, sir," he said, turning towards me.
  "Permit me to thank you heartily for your hospitality. If you really care to
  see our miserable performance, Mr. Andrews will only be too delighted to give
  you a ticket. Good evening, sir;" and he hurried off&mdash;not before I had
  pressed a cigar upon him, however.</p>

  <p>"Poor fellow!" remarked my remaining guest, making himself comfortable in
  the easy chair; "misfortune seems almost to have turned his head. Miserable
  performance, indeed!"</p>

  <p>I was interested in the young man. His haggard, miserable face and
  bearing, which, for all its misery, had yet something refined and
  distinguished in it, had touched me, and I felt curious to hear something of
  his history.</p>

  <p>"He has been unfortunate, then?" I ventured.</p>

  <p>"He has. If you care to hear his story&mdash;it is a very short
  one&mdash;stroll down to the station with me, and I will tell it you as we
  go."</p>

  <p>I assented willingly, and, lighting our pipes, we sallied out, crossed the
  spacious market-place, and made our way along the queer little street towards
  the station.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you all about him in a very few words," began my companion
  briskly. "I hate sad stories, so I shan't linger over it, I can assure you.
  Five years ago I was very much in the same way as I am now, only perhaps a
  little better off. I had a very fair company then, and I was travelling down
  the West of England, playing at nearly all the decent sized towns. Sometimes
  we did well, sometimes badly; sometimes we had our pocket full of money, at
  others we had scarcely enough to carry us on. Ah, I've had some queer ups and
  downs in my life, I can tell you, and some curious adventures; but I mustn't
  stop to tell you about them now. I had a young lady in my company&mdash;a
  Miss Knowles&mdash; a thoroughly respectable and remarkably pretty young lady
  she was, and no mistake; far too good for my work. I picked her up quite by
  accident. Her father died quite suddenly&mdash;he was an actor&mdash; and as
  I happened to be in the town, she came to me and begged for a temporary
  engagement. She was almost penniless, it seemed.</p>

  <p>"Where was this?" I asked. "Not in London?"</p>

  <p>"Lord! no. It was at a little town in Berkshire, which I don't suppose you
  ever heard of&mdash;Faringdon. Well, as I was saying, she came to me for an
  engagement, and I was only too glad to get her, for she was a cut or two
  above the ordinary actresses, and she only asked a trifling salary. She had
  been with me about three months, and we were playing down at a little town in
  Gloucestershire, when in strolls a young gentleman, and falls straightaway in
  love with her. He found means to obtain an introduction, and I must say that
  from first to last he behaved like a gentleman throughout. I don't suppose he
  found it very difficult&mdash;a gay, handsome young fellow he was, with all
  the appearance of unlimited wealth&mdash;to win a lonely girl's heart.
  Anyhow, he succeeded, and hung about with us all that week and the next, and
  came down again, after a brief absence, the week afterwards. He looked very
  grave this last time, and came straight to me, whom he seemed somehow to
  regard as the girl's guardian. He had broken the news of his engagement to
  his father&mdash;a very stern, hard old gentleman he must be, I should
  think&mdash;and he had absolutely refused even to listen to anything so
  preposterous as his son's marriage with an obscure actress. He had no mother,
  and was an only child, and I suppose he relied a little too much on his
  father's leniency. Anyhow, he married Margaret Knowles&mdash;I gave her
  away&mdash;and then took her home to beg for forgiveness. In less than a week
  they came back again to me. The old shoot&mdash;meaning the father&mdash;had
  refused to see them, had turned them both out of the house, and had told his
  son never to come near him again. Even then they were so ridiculously fond of
  one another that they could think of nothing else, and seemed quite
  indifferent as to the future. At last their money was all gone, and that
  brought them to their senses. We had a long talk, and it was arranged that I
  should have Margaret back again for a week or two while he tried to get some
  employment; and, accordingly, sanguine and full of hope, he started off for
  London. I don't know how it was exactly, but, partly because he had never
  been brought up to any business and partly owing to his father's influence,
  he could get nothing, and all his friends seemed to have turned against him.
  After about a month's absence he came down again to where we were playing in
  Wiltshire, altogether broken down and dispirited and well-nigh desperate. As
  a last resource, I advised him to try the stage. There seemed nothing else
  for him to do, so he accepted a minor engagement with me. That was more than
  four years ago, and here he has been ever since. That's his history."</p>

  <p>"And a very sad one it is," I remarked. "You didn't tell me his name?"</p>

  <p>"Farradale&mdash;Philip Farradale. His father, Sir Edward Farradale, is a
  great man in the city, I believe."</p>

  <p>I stopped in the middle of the path, and repeated the name in surprise.
  During the last few months I had often been brought into contact with the
  wealthy railway director and ex-banker, and, indeed, numbered him now amongst
  my clients. A stern, reticent old man he was&mdash;one of the old school, and
  not at all the sort of father a son would care to trifle with. Little hope, I
  feared, for the young actor!</p>

  <p>"Has he ever appealed to him again?"</p>

  <p>"Twice. First when the child was born, and again when his wife&mdash;poor
  Margaret&mdash;lay desperately ill, and we could not afford the money to have
  her properly nursed. In each case the letter was returned torn through the
  middle."</p>

  <p>"Beast!" I muttered. We were at the station by this time, and, as the
  train was slowly steaming in along the single line, my companion, with a
  hastily muttered apology, left me. I lingered on the platform, standing back
  in the shadow of the bridge, and watched Philip Farradale pause in his
  restless perambulations, and glance eagerly in at the carriage doors as the
  train glided into the station. Suddenly his whole expression changed, and
  with a glad smile of welcome he halted outside one of the compartments. A
  tiny little child stretched out its arms with an infantile cry of welcome,
  and was tenderly lifted to the ground. Then he turned round eagerly and gave
  his hand to a tall, pale girl, who welcomed him with a wonderfully sweet
  smile for such a wan, thin face. For a moment or two they stood talking; then
  he lifted the child up into his arms, took a small bag from his wife, and
  they moved slowly away, he apparently making anxious though fond inquiries,
  and she endeavouring to satisfy him Almost at my side little Mr. Andrews was
  talking cheerfully to a motley group, whom I conjectured to be the rest of
  the company, but I did not pause to scrutinize them. Philip Farradale's
  gaunt, unhappy face haunted me. What a sad little romance to stumble across
  in an Oxfordshire lane!</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Imagine a long narrow barn, with whitewashed walls and bare
  floor, dimly lit with rude oil lamps, save the rear part, which their
  flickering, uncertain light failed to illuminate, and which was consequently
  in semi-darkness. A couple of faded red screens and a curtain which bore the
  marks of much ill-usage had been called into requisition to conceal the whole
  of the top part of the room; but the shabbiness of each was artfully toned
  down by the little row of flaring footlights, which cast a sort of artificial
  halo upon their age and dinginess. Immediately in front of these footlights
  were several long rows of rude wooden benches; behind these were several
  other benches, still ruder in construction and without any backs to them, and
  in the rear part were no seats at all. To this temple of the arts I groped my
  way along a dark footpath (it stood about fifty yards back from the road),
  and, having discovered the door and paid my shilling, I was ushered into one
  of the front benches. I was then, if you please, one of the patrons of the
  Chipping Norton Theatre. The time fixed for the performance was close at
  hand, and I was surprised on glancing around to find that the little building
  was almost full. At the back was a hustling crowd of men and boys,
  interspersed with a few women, whose eager faces, owing to the dim light, I
  could only indistinctly catch. As if aware of their obscurity, and desiring
  by some means to testify as to their presence, perhaps emboldened too by
  their knowledge that they could not be distinguished from each other in
  front, they were creating, if not exactly a hubbub, at any rate, some degree
  of noise. Every moment or two some mirthful sally or rude joke from their
  midst would produce a hearty roar of genuine laughter; and there was also a
  continual cracking of nuts and stamping of feet, which, varied by an
  occasional whistle, was evidence of their impatience at the non-rising of the
  curtain. The seats at the back were all full, and as far as there the
  uncertain light allowed me to distinguish faces. There was a fair sprinkling
  of the youthful agricultural labourer, with his red face shining with soap
  and expectation, great coarse hands, tough clothes, and short pipe&mdash;for
  smoking was not forbidden. Then there were the village girls, with large,
  good-humoured faces and ill-fitting clothes, chattering and giggling amongst
  themselves, and exchanging open badinage with the male part of the audience,
  who appeared to be mostly ranged behind. A little nearer the front sat those
  whom I judged to be the tradesmen of the town, in their black coats and best
  ties, and bearing all of them on their exteriors the evident signs of having
  "got themselves up" for such unheard-of dissipation as a night's
  "play-acting." Nor were their wives and daughters far behind them in the
  splendour of their apparel, for bonnets and gowns which had an unmistakable
  "Sunday" appearance had been brought out and donned for this rare and
  never-to-be-forgotten treat. In the front seat close to me masherdom was
  represented by three youths&mdash;I am prepared to pledge my word that they
  were farmers' sons&mdash;in light suits and very stick-up collars, who
  carried elaborate walking-sticks and kid-gloves, and gazed round at the
  expectant audience with a semi compassionate gaze, as if they themselves were
  regular <i>habitués</i> of the theatre, and pitied exceedingly those who
  looked upon this sort of thing as a treat.</p>

  <p>At last the wished-for moment arrived: there was a hush, and from behind
  the red screen a vilely strung piano gave forth the opening chords of the
  overture to "Masaniello." There is an end to all things, and, to my intense
  relief, that overture came to an end at last. Then there was some more
  rumbling of feet and whistling, until amidst a sudden breathless silence a
  little bell rang out and the curtain rolled slowly up (all on one side). The
  scene displayed was understood to be the grounds of an English mansion, and a
  subdued buzz of admiration and wonder testified to the picturesque effect
  produced by a couple of side wings daubed all over with green paint to
  represent the perspective of some gardens, a real iron seat, a green canvas
  turf, an Italian vase (which later on in the performance collapsed, and was
  found to be made of cardboard), a few shrubs in pots, and a baby's
  tennis-racket leaning ostentatiously against the seat. I wonder how it was
  that I (who am somewhat a critical playgoer) took such keen interest in the
  development of that worn-out plot, and followed its threads so eagerly; how
  it was that I felt such a sympathy for my gloomy young friend, when as the
  squire's only son, he was ejected from his rightful position by the
  machinations of the inevitable villain (a gentleman, by the way, whom I
  remember to have seen at the station laden with many brown paper parcels, and
  carrying an enormous umbrella); and how it was that I conceived such hatred
  for this said villain, who continually rolled his "r's" and frowned until his
  heavy eyebrows (false) met, and gnawed the ends of his black moustache (also
  false) until he really looked quite diabolical, and caused a small child, who
  sat near the front, to howl bitterly on meeting the evil one's eye. I don't
  know how it was, but there wasn't a credulous, open-mouthed rustic there more
  absorbed in the progress of the piece than I, and no one more savagely hissed
  the evil soliloquies of the villain, or more loudly clapped the noble
  speeches of the heroic but misrepresented son, or showed more frantic delight
  when the young lady administered a snub to the designing villain who sought
  her hand, but whom she very properly refused to have anything to do with,
  than I did. The first act terminated in the ejection of the righteous son
  from the parental roof, whilst the villain, who, by the bye, was his cousin,
  stood looking on with folded arms and fixed, satirical smile, quite unmoved
  by the home-truths and threats which the ejected one showered upon him, to
  the delight of the audience and the approval of the young lady, who, by some
  strange chance, had wandered upon the scene, and who subsequently went into
  hysterics after the most approved fashion. Then came the interval, which, by
  the bye, was a somewhat prolonged one. The three representatives of masherdom
  sported cigarettes and strolled down the front, arm-in-arm, whilst the
  humbler portion of the audience amused themselves by cracking nuts and simple
  jokes until both were exhausted, and then they betrayed their interest in the
  piece, and their anxiety for the curtain again to rise, by a steady rumbling
  of hob-nailed boots, varied and sometimes accompanied by shrill whistles: a
  piece of rowdyism which seemed very much to disgust the three young gentlemen
  in the front row, who had finished their promenade, and were now occupying
  themselves by staring at two demure-looking young ladies on my left, who
  appeared to be very indignant at the scrutiny to which they were subjected.
  My private opinion is, however, that the indignation was just a trifle
  affected, and that really they were not a little flattered at having gained
  the notice of three such magnificent creatures. That opinion was considerably
  strengthened too by such fragments of their conversation as unavoidably
  reached my ears, and by the continual giggling, which did not appear to
  indicate a very disturbed state of mind.</p>

  <p>"For shame, Aggie! I wonder at your looking at them. Rude things they are,
  especially that Harry Franks!" exclaimed the elder, tossing her head, and
  immediately afterwards casting a demure glance behind her sister's back at
  the youth nearest to me, whom I immediately concluded to be the said Harry
  Franks. Just as I was getting interested, however, in this by-play, its
  further development was interfered with by the ascent of the curtain.</p>

  <p>I shall not easily forget that second act. Many years have come and gone
  since I sat in that rude barn and watched the performance of that little
  company of strolling players, but still that scene is vivid and fresh in my
  memory. The young hero of the piece is joined by his beloved, and marries
  her. They travel to London, and he, blithe and sanguine, commences the search
  undertaken every day by so many eager and hopeful hearts for "something to
  do." Failure seems to wait on failure. Editors will not accept his
  contributions, no one wants a secretary, no one wants a clerk, no one wants a
  porter, and, at last, no one will spare a copper to save his young wife and
  child from starvation. I could call to mind half a dozen plays now running
  which have included in their plot such a scene and such a development, but I
  am quite sure that the part has never been played as it was played that night
  in the barn at Chipping Norton. For the first time, in her stage get-up of
  faded dress and thin shawl, I could see how haggard and emaciated young Mrs.
  Farradale really was, how puny and delicate looking her child, and how gaunt
  and misery stricken was his appearance. They played the part of starving man
  and woman, this young husband and wife, and as I listened to the bitter
  pathos in her tones and watched the dull despair in his face, a horrible
  suspicion stole in upon me that they were themselves almost in this terrible
  strait. Real tears glistened in his eyes as he felt his wife's frail form,
  and a hear trending sob escaped him as he passed his hand over her scanty
  garments. The wild anger in his voice when he spoke of his unforgiving father
  was real, and, as if by some electric spell, his quivering tones touched and
  held spellbound the village audience. They thought it fine acting, and
  wondered at his art; I shuddered and turned away, for from the first I had
  perceived that he was but an indifferent actor. It was the stern reality of
  the whole thing that caused his voice to quaver and his eyes to grow dim, and
  reality of suffering that brought that woe-begone look into his young wife's
  pallid face. The situation had brought them recollection and realization of
  their own hapless state, and they had no need to act. I am not ashamed to
  confess that I could not sit it out. I left the place, hurrying away into the
  cold night air, and scarcely had the door closed upon me when a deafening
  burst of applause announced the termination of the scene. I had stumbled
  across a veritable drama in this quiet little country town, and I had been
  brought face to face with a misery which one reads often in books, but seldom
  meets. Could Sir Edward Farradale really be aware of his son's desperate
  plight? I wondered, as I walked up and down the little pathway which led from
  the barn to the road. A severe and unforgiving old man I could readily
  imagine him to be, but surely not so unforgiving as to let his only son and
  his daughter-in-law slowly starve to death on the miserable pittance of
  strolling players. I am anything but a busybody, and like nothing less, as a
  rule, than interfering with other people's business (although I am a lawyer),
  but it did not take me long to decide that immediately on my return to town I
  would risk the loss of a wealthy client, and myself inform Sir Edward
  Farradale of the desperate straits in which his son was.</p>

  <p>The performance was over, and the audience came trooping out, laughing and
  talking, exchanging salutations and passing comments upon the performance
  which they had witnessed. Little did they guess how real was the drama which
  had been played out before their eyes! The two young ladies who had sat on my
  left hand came out with the rest, laughing and evidently in high good-humour,
  and close behind them their three admirers, arm-in-arm, also in very good
  spirits. At* the gate I believe they all joined company, and down the dark
  road I heard their merry, chattering voices as they sallied homewards. I
  waited until the outpouring crowd grew thinner and thinner, until all but
  myself had cleared away, and then I re-entered the barn. The old woman who
  had sold me my ticket, and who was about to extinguish the lights, paused and
  looked questioningly at me; but before she could frame a protest, I had
  pushed on one side the screen and stood behind the scenes. All the little
  company were talking together in a cluster save the two in whom I was
  interested, and they were a little apart from the rest by themselves. He,
  Philip Farradale, was wrapping an old shawl carefully around his wife's
  throat with all the attentive tenderness of the most <i>preux chevalier</i>
  of an opera-house cloak-room; and as he put the finishing touches to it and
  stepped back to note the effect, she shot up at him a glance of gratitude,
  and for a moment her wasted face was illumined by a wonderfully sweet smile,
  which showed me in what way and in what fashion she had once been beautiful.
  The little child who had figured in the play was asleep. Small wonder, for it
  was eleven o'clock, and such an infant should have been in bed hours ago. Mr.
  Andrews was the first to perceive me, and he at once left the group and
  hurried to my side.</p>

  <p>"Aha! sir; come to offer your congratulations, eh? Glad to see you! Not
  such a bad house, was it?" he remarked, rubbing his hands and beaming up at
  me jocosely.</p>

  <p>"The place seemed quite full," I answered. "I should not have intruded
  here, Mr. Andrews, but I want you to breakfast with me to-morrow morning, and
  Mr. Farradale, if he will be so good."</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted, sir," was the emphatic reply; but Philip Farradale
  shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I shall take no refusal," I insisted eagerly. "Won't you introduce me to
  Mrs. Farradale? Perhaps she will favour me too."</p>

  <p>He mentioned my name with no very good grace, and Mrs. Farradale returned
  my bow in a perfectly lady-like and self-possessed manner. There was nothing
  in the least loud or stagey about her. Notwithstanding her dingy dress and
  faded shawl, she bore herself like a lady; and my heart ached for the trio as
  she turned with a mute, questioning glance to her husband, her hand still
  resting on the child's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You must come, now, Mr. Farradale," I urged, laying my hand on his arm.
  "I want particularly to have a chat with you; and bring your wife and the
  youngster. I insist," and in the end he promised.</p>

  <p>I left them then, and made my way from the barn into the road. I had
  scarcely passed through the gate before Mr. Andrews caught me up.</p>

  <p>"I see you take an interest in young Farradale and his wife," he said, as
  we walked down the lane together. "I wish we could do something for them. I
  declare my heart aches sometimes&mdash;it does indeed," he went on
  seriously&mdash;" to see them going down, down, down. I do everything I can;
  but that isn't much. Every penny we earn I divide in a fair proportion
  amongst the company, and yet I know that the little they draw can only just
  keep them going."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't care to lose them from the company, I suppose, even if
  something better could be found for young Farradale?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"By Jove! wouldn't I, though!" declared the little manager emphatically.
  "Margaret Knowles was a very fair actress once, but she takes no manner of
  interest or pleasure in it now. How could she, poor thing? She walks through
  her parts like a stick; and as for him, he never could act a little bit. I
  wouldn't have mentioned it for the world," he went on, dropping his voice and
  drawing a little closer to me, "but I should be far better off without them.
  They are neither of them the least bit suited for the life we have to lead. I
  keep them simply because if I sent them away they must either go to the
  workhouse or starve. There, that's in confidence, sir, of course; and now,
  good-night. I shall be with you soon after nine to-morrow morning.
  Good-night"&mdash;and with a parting wave of the hand he left me and trotted
  off to his lodgings at the other end of the town.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The slight, yet kindly, curiosity which I had felt as to the
  antecedents and history of this young actor and his girl-wife had very
  rapidly developed into a warm interest, and I spent most of the night in
  revolving various schemes for their benefit. By breakfast-time in the morning
  I had come to a decision as to the first step to be taken. First of all I had
  to interview my landlady&mdash;a dear old lady she was, in a widow's cap and
  a black silk dress, which rustled like brown paper. I have seen her many
  times since; but never save attired in that black silk gown which emitted
  from its folds a faint perfume of dried lavender, and in her neat widow's
  cap. A motherly, kind-hearted old lady she is, and she entered at once into
  my scheme with interest and approval. I enaged the room in which I had slept
  (can't you guess that in it the four-poster was as large as a tent, the
  sheets spotless and the furniture old-fashioned?) for a week, and also paid
  her a sum for which, if my scheme prospered, she was to board Mr. and Mrs.
  Farradale and the child for the same period. She was not on any account to
  reveal this arrangement to them, but on their leaving was simply to say that
  Mr. Andrews had settled the bill.</p>

  <p>At a few minutes after nine o'clock who should arrive but that benevolent
  little gentleman, in his shabby brown check suit, of which he was no whit
  ashamed, and beaming all over his face, as if coming out to breakfast was the
  very richest of jokes.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Armitage; good morning, sir!" he exclaimed vigorously,
  as he caught sight of me engaged in my confabulation with the landlady. "I'm
  in good time, you see; the very essence of politeness, you know, to be in
  good time when you are invited out to breakfast; but I'm as hungry as a
  hunter, I do assure you."</p>

  <p>I beckoned him to join us, and explained my scheme, of which he approved
  heartily. Then the landlady bustled away to superintend the getting ready of
  the breakfast, and I further explained my intentions to Mr. Andrews.</p>

  <p>"I don't know yet what I shall be able to do for our young friend and his
  wife," I said; "but at any rate, until I decide upon something definite, I
  want you to pay them treble their present salary, and I will hand you the
  difference each week. You can let them think&mdash;think anything you like,
  as long as you don't tell them the truth. And, Mr. Andrews, you will
  particularly oblige me by not finishing that little speech," I went on
  hurriedly. "You would do exactly the same if you were in my position; I'm
  sure you would. I am a bachelor, and well off; I may even call myself rich. I
  shall never miss the little it will cost me to assist these young
  people."</p>

  <p>Mr. Andrews shook my hand heartily, and though every muscle in his face
  seemed struggling to force a smile, I fancied there was a slight glistening
  in the keen, kindly little eyes.</p>

  <p>"You're a good Samaritan, Mr. Armitage, that's what you are; and I thank
  Providence that we fell in with you. If ever a young couple needed a friend,
  they do, and I can't be thankful enough that they've found one in you. I
  declare it's made a miserable man of me sometimes, although I've always done
  what I could. Sh! Here they are!" he broke off suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Farradale, my boy, how dare you come so late? It's ten minutes past nine,
  and I'm just about famished. Mrs. Farradale, good morning. Allow me to help
  you with your shawl. There, that'll do. And now come and pour out the coffee
  for us, do. I'm a starving man. Halloa! here's the youngster. Blessed if I
  hadn't forgotten him! Now, Phil, my boy, here's a seat for you next your
  mother; " and he hoisted the youngster who had stared shyly at me, but had
  welcomed vociferously his older friend, into a high chair, and then, taking a
  seat himself, rubbed his hands together and beamed round upon us
  generally.</p>

  <p>The breakfast party was a great success, thanks chiefly to the genial
  manager's kindly tact. What little awkwardness there might have been was
  dispelled at the outset by his voluble conversation, which he kept up with
  brief intervals during the whole of the meal. The little boy Philip seemed
  rather inclined to be shy at first; but he soon forgot his shyness in his
  appetite, and, seated between his mother and myself, became with Mr. Andrews
  the principal contributor to the conversation. A capital breakfast we had,
  and it was good to see how they all enjoyed it.</p>

  <p>"Why can't we always have breakfasts like this, Mamma?" inquired Philip
  the younger, somewhat plaintively, towards the end of the meal, as he
  meditatively disposed of a spoonful of marmalade. "Such a nice room, too!" he
  added approvingly.</p>

  <p>We all laughed, a little uneasily, and I seized the opportunity to
  introduce plot number one.</p>

  <p>"That reminds me of a little matter which I had meant to mention to you,"
  I said, addressing Mr. Farradale. "I took this room and a bedroom for a week,
  meaning to have a little quiet fishing down here, but an important business
  appointment which I had quite overlooked calls me back to town for a day or
  two. Of course, I must pay for the rooms; but why shouldn't they be occupied?
  Why shouldn't you and Mrs. Farradale," I continued, "pack up your traps and
  come and stop here for the week? You would find the charges ridiculously low,
  and, of course, there would be nothing for the rooms. Come, now, I think that
  it would be a very good arrangement."</p>

  <p>Philip gave a whoop of delight, and his mother flushed with pleasure. Mr.
  Farradale, however, looked doubtful.</p>

  <p>"It is very good of you to propose it, I'm sure," he said hesitatingly;
  "but I fear that the charges which you consider ridiculously low would still
  be beyond our means."</p>

  <p>"We can soon ascertain that; " and I touched the bell and inquired for the
  landlady. As I had arranged, the terms quoted were ridiculous, and Mrs.
  Farradale looked delighted.</p>

  <p>"How charming to be able to stop here, instead of those hateful pokey
  lodgings!" she exclaimed; and a real tinge of colour came into her thin pale
  cheeks, improving her appearance wonderfully.</p>

  <p>"Phil, won't it be nice?</p>

  <p>He looked at her fondly, and smiled acquiescence.</p>

  <p>"We really are most indebted to Mr. Armitage," he said heartily. "The
  arrangement will be a very pleasant one for us."</p>

  <p>"It's a jolly good idea," declared Mr. Andrews, with a beaming face; "and,
  hang it all! if we have many more nights like last night the exchequer'll get
  more elastic, too! You seem to have brought us good luck, Mr. Armitage. I
  drink your health, sir, in coffee, and trust that it will be continued."</p>

  <p>That morning, after a very cordial leave-taking with my friends, I
  returned to town, with the firm intention of calling at once on Sir Edward
  Farradale, and saying a few plain words to him. Much to my disappointment,
  however, I learnt that he was out of town&mdash;on the Continent, in
  fact&mdash;and was not expected to return until the New Year. I could do
  nothing for the present, therefore, save continue to remit the amount agreed
  upon to Mr. Andrews each week, and I was glad to hear from him that it was
  sufficient to enable them to live in, at any rate, tolerable comfort.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Coincidences do happen sometimes. Here is an instance.
  Amongst my letters on the morning before Christmas Eve was one from Sir
  Edward Farradale, the young actor's father. It was short, but to me intensely
  interesting.</p>

  <p class="letter">Dysart House Kensington<br>
  December 24th.</p>

  <p class="letter">Dear Sirs,&mdash;<br>
  Will your Mr. Armitage be so good as to call upon me this evening at the
  above address? The matter is important. Yours truly,<br>
  Edward Farradale.</p>

  <p class="letter">To Messrs. Armitage &amp; Hales, Lincoln's Inn."</p>

  <p>Punctually at nine o'clock that evening I stood on the steps of Sir Edward
  Farradale's town mansion, and on application was at once admitted. At various
  times the duties of my profession, and in one or two instances social duties,
  have caused me to visit the houses of merchants and noblemen famous for their
  wealth and prodigality; but in none had I seen such almost profligate luxury
  and magnificence of appointments as the entrance-hall and interior of Dysart
  House disclosed. Such things do not as a rule impress me, but I had heard
  much of the state in which the railway king lived, and I saw now that such
  reports were by no means exaggerated. The hall was more like that of some of
  the most princely of the West End Clubs than the entrance to the
  dwelling-house of a childless widower, thronged as it was with mirrors,
  lounges, and rare exotics, amongst which several footmen in handsome liveries
  were lounging noiselessly about on a thick velvet carpet. The dining-room
  door was open, and, though the table appeared to have been laid for one only,
  the damask cloth, the gold plate and epergne, the chastely cut glasses, and
  the profusion of hothouse flowers and fruits, all these things, together with
  the splendour by which I was surrounded, filled me with an intense and
  growing dislike to the man who could let his son&mdash;almost his only
  relative&mdash;starve to death on the miserable pittance of a strolling
  player, while he himself was revelling in such insensate, and to my quiet
  taste almost barbaric, luxury. In a small room leading off the library,
  carefully dressed in evening clothes, with <i>The Times</i> in his hand, and
  a cup of black coffee by his side, I found the railway millionaire. On a
  table before him was a huge pile of letters, which his secretary, a man
  almost as old as himself, was busily sorting. As the servant ushered me into
  the room, he looked up from his paper and nodded in a not unfriendly manner
  whilst he motioned me to a seat.</p>

  <p>"Wright, you can leave us for half an hour," he said, turning to the man
  who was writing beside him. "You have plenty to go on with at present;" and
  the obedient secretary gathered up his papers and vanished.</p>

  <p>Sir Edward Farradale seemed in no hurry to broach the business on which he
  had sent for me, for, after pushing the cigar-box across the table (I knew
  better than to refuse one of his cigars), he leaned back in his chair, and,
  closing his eyes, seemed deep in thought. I watched him with a new interest,
  studying his face as I had never studied it before, and wondering whether my
  appeal&mdash;for I had decided to make one&mdash;would have any chance of
  success. I felt dispirited and very little sanguine as I recognized in his
  hard-set countenance the signs of a disposition obstinate and unbending in
  the extreme. The bushy grey eyebrows and low forehead, the thin, firm lips,
  well-cut, decided chin, and keen, steel-coloured eyes, all denoted such
  characteristics; and while they accounted to me for much of this man's
  extraordinary success, they filled me with apprehensions and misgivings lest
  my mission should prove a failure.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he opened his eyes and spoke in his usual abrupt manner.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Armitage," he said, "I am going to die."</p>

  <p>The words were a shock to me, and for a moment I hesitated, wondering
  whether he was serious. "You think that I don't look very ill, perhaps," he
  continued. "Nevertheless, Sir Andrew Clark has told me only this morning in
  this room that I cannot live a year. This being so I have sent for you to
  make my will."</p>

  <p>His coolness was wonderful. For a man who had lived for the world, and had
  been essentially a worldly man, it was astounding.</p>

  <p>"I have always understood that Mr. Kendrick was your family solicitor," I
  faltered.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Kendrick has no longer the management of any of my affairs. He has
  offended me by persistently harping upon a forbidden subject. I have been
  pleased with the way your firm has managed several little affairs for me, so
  I sent for you. There is no time like the present," he went on, taking a thin
  note-book from his inner pocket. "You will find some papers on the
  table."</p>

  <p>I drew some foolscap towards me and filled in the preliminaries. Then he
  began.</p>

  <p>"First of all, there are the executors," he said, in a quick,
  business-like tone. "Well, I appoint you and Mr. Edward Roberts. To each I
  leave a thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>I bowed and wrote in silence.</p>

  <p>"I also wish to leave to Henry Thomson Wright, my secretary, five hundred
  pounds; to Alice Pratt, my housekeeper, Midland Railway Stock to produce two
  hundred a year; and the same to Robert Ball, my butler."</p>

  <p>I wrote, and, having written, looked up for further instructions.</p>

  <p>"I leave the whole of my shares in the Great Western Railway," he
  continued, "amounting at present to £57,900 10s , to be divided between St.
  Thomas's and Guy's Hospitals; and to my cousin, Mabel Padmore, the sum of
  £50,000, the estate and manor of Portland Towers, in Yorkshire, Dysart House,
  Kensington, with the whole of my furniture, jewellery, horses and carriages,
  plate, etc. The rest of my Midland Railway Stock and other investments, which
  I calculate to amount to a little under £290,000, I leave to my esteemed
  friend, Sir Charles Tomkins. You will find in this book and in documents
  which I will instruct Mr. Kendrick to hand over to you a complete list of all
  my investments, personal property, and estates."</p>

  <p>I laid down my pen and prepared for the struggle.</p>

  <p>"Am I to understand then, Sir Edward Farradale, that there is no one else
  whom you wish to benefit under your will?"</p>

  <p>He looked at me keenly from underneath his bushy grey eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I have left you a thousand pounds," he said curtly.</p>

  <p>"Money which I should never touch," I answered firmly, "for I should not
  even dream of accepting the executorship of such a will as this. You have a
  son, Sir Edward."</p>

  <p>He turned pale with a sudden fury, and his steel blue eyes flashed with an
  angry light.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Armitage, you are trespassing upon forbidden ground," he said, in a
  low intense tone. "I had a son, it is true, but I have cast him off, and
  never wish to hear his name again. I shall not leave him a shilling. You will
  oblige me by pressing that gong, and we will have two of the servants in to
  witness the will."</p>

  <p>"One moment," I exclaimed, stretching out my hand to secure the gong. "It
  may interest you, Sir Edward Farradale, to know where and in what condition
  your son at present is. Only a few weeks back I lent him a helping hand to
  save him from starvation. Yes, starvation," I repeated impressively. "For
  while you are living here like a millionaire, your only son is earning a
  miserable pittance with a strolling company of players; tramping from town to
  town in the desperate attempt to earn enough to support his wife, your
  daughter, and his little son, your grandchild. He did wrong to disobey you,
  no doubt, Sir Edward, but his wife is not what you think her. She is a lady,
  and a daughter to be proud of; and your grandson is a fine little fellow. You
  need be ashamed of neither. Surely, if you cannot forgive your son, as any
  other man would do, you will leave enough to keep him from starving. Let me
  add a codicil;" and I took up the pen again. Sir Edward Farradale had
  listened without emotion&mdash;without, indeed, any signs of
  interest&mdash;to what I had been saying. When I had finished he turned and
  struck the gong without any remark.</p>

  <p>"Tell Burditt I want him immediately, and then remain yourself," were his
  orders to the man.</p>

  <p>I made one last appeal, full of anger, but with a sinking heart.</p>

  <p>"Sir Edward, I cannot think that you fully understand what you are about
  to do. Do you realize that by signing this will you will incur the
  everlasting disgrace of leaving your only son and grandchild dependent upon
  charity; if, indeed, they do not starve to death before charity intervenes?
  You cannot mean to sign this&mdash;this most disgraceful document. Let me add
  a codicil. Leave them but enough to keep them respectably out of these many
  thousands of yours, and I will say no more. We are not sentimental men, Sir
  Edward, but I may remind you that no time could be more suitable for a
  reconciliation with your son than now. To-morrow is Christmas Day, and "I was
  interrupted by the opening of the door and the entrance of the butler and
  footman.</p>

  <p>"Robert and Heggs, come here," said Sir Edward, in his clear, cold tones.
  "I require you to witness my signature to this document&mdash;my will;" and
  he dipped the pen in the ink.</p>

  <p>I leaned over the table, and, for once in my life in a towering passion,
  tore into fragments the will which I had prepared.</p>

  <p>"Never in my presence!" I exclaimed, scattering the fragments all over the
  floor. "I would not have my name associated with such an infamous document,
  Sir Edward Farradale, for the whole of your fortune! I wish you good
  evening;" and I caught up my hat and made for the door.</p>

  <p>"Robert, show Mr. Armitage out," said Sir Edward, without the least sign
  of anger, "and then put on your coat at once. I shall have a note ready for
  you in a moment. Good evening, Mr. Armitage; I'm sorry to have troubled
  you."</p>

  <p>I walked home full of burning indignation against Sir Edward Farradale.
  From what I had previously seen and heard of him, I had been prepared to find
  him a man of firm will and difficult to move; but that he could be so
  absolutely and heartlessly adamant I had never contemplated. It had seemed to
  me that his sense of justice would, at any rate, have led him to make some
  provision for his son, even if he refused to forgive him. But of that now
  there appeared to be no probability.</p>

  <p>I slept badly that night, and cut my <i>Times</i> in the morning with less
  animation than usual. The first paragraph which caught my eye, however, gave
  me a violent shock.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"Sudden Death of a City Millionaire.&mdash;We regret to
  announce that Sir Edward Farradale, well known in all financial circles as a
  large holder of railway and other stock, and chairman of several companies,
  died suddenly of heart disease early this morning at his town mansion, Dysart
  House, Kensington. Deceased was," etc.</p>

  <p>I flung the paper into a corner, and, leaving my breakfast untasted,
  hurried out into the street and hailed a hansom. In a quarter of an hour I
  was at Dysart House, and was at once admitted. I asked for Robert, and
  questioned him breathlessly about the note which his master had told him to
  deliver.</p>

  <p>"The moment you left sir," said Robert, "Sir Edward wrote a note to Mr.
  Parsons, the lawyer, and told me to take it to his house. I took a cab there,
  but Mr. Parsons had a dinner-party, and sent out word to me that he would
  call at Dysart House at nine o'clock this morning. Sir Edward seemed rather
  annoyed when I gave him this message, but said it would do then, he supposed.
  As I was leaving the room he called me back, and told me that we need none of
  us sit up, as he had some writing to do; so we all went to bed. But about two
  o' clock I came down to make sure about the lights, and he was sitting in his
  chair bolt upright like, with a glassy sort of look in his eyes which gave me
  quite a turn. I spoke to him, but he never answered, and then I went close up
  to him and touched his hand. It was cold as ice, and then it seemed to strike
  me that he must be dead," concluded Robert, in an awestruck tone. "I rang
  every one up, and sent for a doctor, but it was all no use, of course."</p>

  <p>"Had he done any writing? Were there any papers about?" I queried.</p>

  <p>Robert put a piece of paper silently in my hands. It was a sheet of plain
  foolscap, with these words written on it in Sir Edward Farradale's
  writing:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">Last will and testament of Edward Farradale, Knight,
  December 24th, 188-. I, Edward Farradale, being in sound...</p>

  <p>And there the pen had slipped from his fingers and left a long scrawling
  mark down the paper. I shuddered. Sudden death is an awful thing.</p>

  <p>A few hours later Philip Farradale stood by his dead father's body, and on
  the third day, chief mourner amongst an imposing assemblage, followed it to
  the grave. I never told him of that will which I had been bidden to prepare.
  <i>Cui bono</i>? And why should I, their most intimate friend, be the first
  to cast a cloud over their unsullied happiness, which surely they have richly
  deserved? For the days of their misery are forgotten, and, thanks to
  excellent constitutions, it has left no evil traces behind. A long cruise in
  the most luxurious of yachts brought the colour back to Mrs. Farradale's
  cheeks, and the southern breezes and restful life renewed in her the strength
  and youth which privation and misery had taken from her; whilst he came back
  to England broad-shouldered and sunburnt, with happy, careless laugh and
  animated manners, a different man from the Philip Farradale who, by his
  stolid expression of hopeless misery, had excited my sympathy in that
  Oxfordshire lane. And little Philip. Well, I have just read in <i>The
  Times</i> that he is looked upon as the most promising, although the
  youngest, batsman in he Harrow eleven. So it may reasonably be inferred that
  he too has suffered little from early privations. One word as to our genial
  little manager, Mr. Andrews. They would have done anything for him, and I
  myself could have helped him in many ways, but he would have none of it.</p>

  <p>"I'm a confirmed Bohemian," he laughed, when we first delicately hinted at
  some little assistance. "I delight in being hard up. I delight in having to
  walk now and then because I haven't enough money to pay my railway fare.
  Surfeit would trouble me more than privation. When I want your help I shall
  not forget that I have good friends." And so we had to let him have his own
  way. I often see him, though, for walking tours are still my hobby; and if I
  can plan one so as to fall in with a shabby little company of strolling
  players in some out-of-the-way town-village, why, then I am always heartily
  welcomed, and Dick Andrews, as merry and beaming as ever, will take up his
  quarters with me until the three days or a week are up, and tents are struck
  and the show moves on.</p>

  <p class="first">DOZEN men were seated around a table in the stuffy, stale-
  odoured room&mdash;and a spokesman on whom all their eyes were bent.</p>

  <p class="first">"It is for that, my brothers, that you are summoned here to-
  night," he was saying in a low yet distinct tone. "It is to bid you prepare.
  We have sure advices. The wrath of the Fatherland is kindled. Even now, our
  great and invincible army is being mobilized. Soon you shall rule in the
  country where you have served!"</p>

  <p>There was a little murmur of guttural approval. The faces of the men
  turned towards the speaker were of various types enough, but their dress was
  uniform&mdash;the grease-stained, shapeless livery of the waiter fresh from
  his night's toil.</p>

  <p>The man at the head of the table twirled his fair moustache fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he cried, "my children, think what it means! They force a landing,
  our brave German soldiers, and what do they find? An opposing army of the
  cowards who ran from the Boers! Perhaps &mdash;but what else! An army of
  brave men, many thousands strong, trained, armed, sprung from who knows
  where&mdash;as eager to strike for the Fatherland and crush these fat
  stiff-necked English, as their brothers who come fresh from the barracks.
  Think what a joyful surprise&mdash;what a certainty of victory, what glory
  for all of us who have secretly planned and organized the army of hidden men!
  Brothers! The Fatherland!&mdash;and victory!"</p>

  <p>They grunted and drank and grunted again. The chairman took up his
  hat.</p>

  <p>"I ask you," he said, "to drink one more toast&mdash; success to my
  mission! I cannot tell you what it is. One man only, save myself, knows it.
  But I can tell you this: If I am successful your rifles will be on your
  shoulders before many days are past, and you will see these English, as you
  march through the streets, scurry to their holes like rabbits. I go to make
  the war!"</p>

  <p>They drank, and set down their empty tankards. Their voices were scarcely
  raised above a whisper, for this was a business meeting of the Waiters' Trade
  Union Association.</p>

  <p>"Success to Max! To the war!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A neatly dressed young man, fair, with waxed moustache, and
  a bearing which seemed to indicate some sort of military training, stepped
  out from a small pony-cart in front of the Grand Hotel,
  Settlingham-by-the-Sea, and promptly commenced a spirited argument with the
  driver as to the fare. Having ascertained the exact legal amount, he paid it
  in a shilling and some carefully counted coppers. Then, carrying his own bag,
  he marched into the hotel.</p>

  <p>"Is the manager, Mr. Rice, in, Miss?" he asked the young lady at the
  office.</p>

  <p>She glanced behind her. The manager stepped forward. The young man took
  off his hat.</p>

  <p>"My name," he said, "is Spielman. I received your wire, and I have come by
  the earliest possible train.</p>

  <p>The manager was disposed to be affable and held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Glad to see you, Mr. Spielman," he said. "The hall-boy here will show you
  your room, and you had better change as soon as possible. Will you step
  inside and have something first?"</p>

  <p>"I should enjoy," the young man answered, "a glass of beer. It is a warm
  afternoon!"</p>

  <p>He entered the little bar behind the office and bowed to the young ladies,
  who received his greeting with a mixture of condescension and reserve. A
  head-waiter was a person who had been known to presume upon his position.</p>

  <p>"I trust," Mr. Spielman said, "that business is fairly good, sir?"</p>

  <p>"We are very nearly full up," the manager answered. "You will find plenty
  to do."</p>

  <p>"I like work," the young man said simply. "Is there any one to whom you
  wish me to show special attention?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," the manager answered&mdash;" I am glad you mentioned it. I
  will give you the names of the others to-morrow, but our most important
  visitor just now is Lord Brentmore."</p>

  <p>The head-waiter bowed. It was one of his professional habits always to bow
  at the mention of a lord's name.</p>

  <p>"A very rich gentleman?" he inquired deferentially.</p>

  <p>"Not only rich," the manager answered, "but he is a Cabinet
  Minister&mdash;Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He has come down here,
  with all his family, for a rest and a month's golf. Not that he gets much
  rest, poor fellow, with all these Continental troubles getting worse every
  day. By the by, Mr. Spielman, are you a German?"</p>

  <p>"l am a Swiss," lied Mr. Spielman.</p>

  <p>"Can't say I'm sorry," the manager admitted. "Mr. Spielman. I don't want
  to hurry you, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Spielman finished his beer at once.</p>

  <p>"In one quarter of an hour," he announced, "I shall be in the
  dining-room."</p>

  <p>The new arrival was shown to his room on the fifth floor, and with
  expressionless face made a rapid toilet. On his way to the dining-room he
  met, in the hall, a young man who was lounging against a table, with a paper
  in his hand, and who surveyed him curiously through an eyeglass. Mr. Spielman
  bowed and passed on to his duties, but a slight frown had gathered upon his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"I was an ass!" he murmured softly.</p>

  <p>The young man, who was called the Honourable Philip Usher, and was Lord
  Brentmore's private secretary, strolled towards the door and met his
  lordship, who was just coming in from golf.</p>

  <p>"Good match, sir?"</p>

  <p>Lord Brentmore's face was beaming.</p>

  <p>"Excellent," he answered. "We played a fourball&mdash;the Colonel and I
  against Holland and Dick. The Colonel was off the game, only came in once,
  but we won two up. I did five threes."</p>

  <p>Usher nodded sympathetically. "There is one despatch, sir," he said. "I
  have decoded it. Shall I come upstairs with you now?"</p>

  <p>Lord Brentmore led the way to a private sitting room on the first floor
  and listened to the message. His face clouded over a little.</p>

  <p>"A bit stiff, eh?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>Usher nodded.</p>

  <p>"It may be your fancy, sir," he said, "but it really seems to me that they
  want to force a quarrel."</p>

  <p>"We won't have it," Brentmore answered. "We can't afford it. If war must
  come it must, but not now. Another couple of years, and we can snap our
  fingers at them."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," Usher remarked, "that our friends realize that."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't mind so much," Lord Brentmore continued, "if I could get the
  chief and Morland to realize the position. Practically, you know, Usher," he
  added, glancing round the room and lowering his voice a little, "I am the
  only man in the Cabinet who is hot for peace."</p>

  <p>"I know it, sir," Usher answered, "and I know that you are right. That is
  why I am glad that you are so much better just now. If you were laid up, I
  believe that we should be at war in a week." Lord Brentmore nodded.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately," he said, "I never felt better in my life. This place suits
  me exactly. I shall build a house here some day."</p>

  <p>"I wish that you had one now, sir," Usher answered. "When so much depends
  upon you. I am not sure that it is wise to stay in a hotel."</p>

  <p>Lord Brentmore shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Nothing could happen to me here," he remarked, "to which I should not be
  liable in my own house. Besides, as you know, we could not get a house. Now
  then, Usher, if you are ready, I'll give you down a reply. I'm going to try
  the gentle answer."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The new head-waiter was apparently a great success. He was
  prompt, courteous, and possessed of obvious administrative gifts. No one in
  the room could complain of being neglected, but his chief attention was not
  unnaturally bestowed upon Lord Brentmore's party, which consisted of his
  Lordship himself, his wife, one daughter, Lady Eva, and Usher. He frequently
  brought them dishes with his own hands, and they found every want
  anticipated. Usher eyed him more than once curiously.</p>

  <p>"I'm inclined to be a democrat," he remarked, when their new attendant was
  out of the room for a moment, "but I can't help thinking that fellow had
  rather a cheek to come down from town first class." Lord Brentmore looked up
  amused. "Are you sure that he did?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," Usher answered; "we were in the same carriage for some
  distance, until I changed into an empty one at Ipswich. Saw you coming down,
  didn't I?" he remarked, as Spielman reappeared. "I believe so, sir," the
  head-waiter answered quietly. "A friend of mine gave me a pass."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie," Usher muttered, as Spielman hurried off to another table.
  "I saw him give up his ticket."</p>

  <p>Lord Brentmore smiled.</p>

  <p>"After all, why not?" he remarked. "We all have one pet extravagance. His
  may be travelling first class. Mine, if I could afford to indulge in it,
  would be to put down a new ball on every tee."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why he wanted to lie about it, anyhow," Usher remarked.</p>

  <p>They left the room soon afterwards. Usher sought out the manager in his
  room.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Rice," he said, "I hope you won't think me a nuisance, but can you
  tell me anything about your new head-waiter?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," the manager answered. "I trust that he has given
  satisfaction?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," Usher answered. "It isn't that. There are just a few things
  I should like to know. Is he a German?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, a Swiss."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" Usher remarked. "He doesn't look like one. Now, can you tell me
  this? Lord Brentmore first wrote you about coming here in July didn't
  he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Did you engage this fellow before or after then?"</p>

  <p>"Afterwards, sir. In fact, I did not engage him at all. Hausman was
  coming, the dark German from the Imperial, who was here last year&mdash;you
  may remember him, sir; but it seems he was taken ill, and Spielman has come
  on to take his place for a month."</p>

  <p>"At Hausman's recommendation?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. I had other references, though."</p>

  <p>"Does it pay these fellows to come down here?" Usher asked.</p>

  <p>The manager smiled.</p>

  <p>"Wonderfully well, sir," he answered. "I know for a fact that Hausman made
  more in his three months here last year than he could make in a twelvemonth
  at the Imperial. I shouldn't have engaged him again on the same terms, but he
  begged so hard, and the visitors here liked him so much."</p>

  <p>Usher nodded.</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't be likely to give up the job of his own accord, then?" he
  remarked. "Sham being ill, or anything of that sort?"</p>

  <p>"Is it likely, sir," the manager asked. "Besides, I saw him in London only
  last week, and he was most eager about it."</p>

  <p>Usher nodded and turned away.</p>

  <p>"I trust that there isn't anything about the new man that you disapprove
  of, sir?" Mr. Rice asked with concern.</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all," Usher answered. "He seems a most capable fellow. Please
  don't let him think that I've been complaining. He seems to know his business
  thoroughly."</p>

  <p><a id="pic11"

        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>"But," Usher added to himself as he went upstairs, "I am not quite sure
  what his business is." Lady Eva waited below for her escort in their usual
  after-dinner stroll for along time. Usher, having first locked the door,
  spent nearly an hour in the sitting-room where Lord Brentmore and he usually
  worked. He first of all re-set all the combination locks of the
  despatch-boxes and sealed them up with a signet-ring, which he carefully
  replaced upon his finger. Then he took out the code-book and disposed of it
  in a secret place about his own person. Finally, he destroyed the blotting
  paper and burnt all the fragments of destroyed letters which he could find in
  the waste-paper basket. Lord Brentmore came in just as he had finished.</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you up to, Usher?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Taking precautions, sir," the young man answered.</p>

  <p>"Against what?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure. Espionage, I suppose."</p>

  <p>Lord Brentmore's eyes twinkled. For a statesman, he was distinctively an
  unimaginative person.</p>

  <p>"Do you suspect any one in particular?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Usher nodded. "The new head-waiter," he answered briefly.</p>

  <p>"Because he came first class?"</p>

  <p>"That and many other reasons," Usher answered. Lord Brentmore lit a
  cigar.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Right!" Usher answered. "To begin with, he came first class because he
  wished to escape observation, and he was busy all the time sorting papers. I
  took him for some one's private secretary. Then, he came as substitute for
  another man, who is supposed to be ill, but who served me with my luncheon
  yesterday morning at the Imperial. The change was made since it was announced
  that you were coming here. Further, he calls himself a Swiss, when I'm
  perfectly certain he's a full-fledged German."</p>

  <p>Lord Brentmore was unconvinced.</p>

  <p>"Supposing he is a spy," he said, "what good can he do himself here? We
  are not likely to talk secrets before him, or to leave despatches about."</p>

  <p>Usher shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am sure of one thing only," he said, "he wants watching."</p>

  <p>* * * * * *</p>

  <p>The next morning Lord Brentmore was late for breakfast. When, at last, he
  appeared, Usher regarded him anxiously. The healthy colour of the night
  before had gone. He was pale, almost sallow, his eyes were clouded, and the
  flesh under them was baggy. He had all the appearance of a man suffering from
  a bad bilious attack.</p>

  <p>"Good morning," he said curtly, sinking into his chair. "Tea and dry toast
  only for me, waiter."</p>

  <p>"Seedy?" Usher inquired laconically.</p>

  <p>"Liver!" Lord Brentmore answered irritably. "That brutal sweet champagne,
  I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Hard luck," Usher answered. "You'll have to take it easy to-day."</p>

  <p>"I'm down here to play golf, and I shall play golf," Lord Brentmore
  growled. "The Colonel will knock my head off, I suppose, though. What's
  this?"</p>

  <p>"Some fresh tea, sir," the head-waiter answered. "The other has been
  standing some little time."</p>

  <p><a id="pic12"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>Lord Brentmore drank two cups, and ate a little toast. Then he went out on
  the links, and returned to the hotel at lunch-time a little better. He ate a
  sole specially prepared, drank one whisky-and-soda, and went back to golf.
  About four o'clock, however, he returned, looking worse than ever.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to lie down," he announced shortly. "Any despatches?"</p>

  <p>"Two," Usher announced. "They are important. I will read them to you
  upstairs."</p>

  <p>Lord Brentmore listened to the messages with darkening face.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word," he said fiercely, "it makes one feel that the Chief and
  Morland are right. It's no use humbugging about with these fellows. I've a
  good mind to give them what they're asking for!"</p>

  <p>Usher looked at his chief anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that just what they are aiming at, sir?" he remarked. "They have
  been trying all the time to goad us into a belligerent frame of mind."</p>

  <p>"And, egad, they'll succeed soon!" Lord Brentmore answered. "Here, take
  down."</p>

  <p>It took Usher nearly an hour's persuasion before he got the message into
  reasonable terms. When he returned from sending it off he brought back with
  him the Settlingham doctor. Lord Brentmore was obviously annoyed, but
  submitted himself to the usual examination. The doctor was thoughtful for a
  moment or two afterwards. He sat with his note-book in his hand, as though
  about to write a prescription, but instead he asked a few more and apparently
  irrelevant questions.</p>

  <p>"Liver, I suppose?" Lord Brentmore asked, when at last the physician's
  pencil began to move.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the doctor answered. "You should be quite yourself in a couple of
  days."</p>

  <p>He gave some instructions as to diet, and handed over his prescription.
  Usher left the room with him.</p>

  <p>"Rather sudden attack, isn't it?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Very, I should say," was the answer. "The symptoms are a little puzzling,
  but they do not point to anything serious."</p>

  <p>Usher drew a little closer to the doctor's side and took his arm as they
  descended the staircase.</p>

  <p>"No trace at all of&mdash;poison, I suppose?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>The doctor started. The suggestion was somewhat startling.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered. "I can't say that. His Lordship must have taken
  something to disagree with him rather violently. Beyond that, there is
  nothing to be said. I think he will be better to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Usher went back to his chief.</p>

  <p>"If I were you, sir," he said, "I should leave this place."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Lord Brentmore asked testily.</p>

  <p>"Frankly," Usher answered, "I believe that head-waiter has been
  interfering with your food."</p>

  <p>"Then you're an ass!" Lord Brentmore declared. "I haven't patience to
  listen to such rubbish!" Usher went out and sent a telegram to Scotland Yard.
  He went also to the manager, and the next day there was a new assistant in
  the kitchen. Luncheon-time passed without incident. Lord Brentmore was very
  irritable, ate nothing, and looked worse than ever. He had abandoned any
  attempt to play golf, and sat studying some recent despatches with an ominous
  frown. He came in late to dinner, and gave an order to the head-waiter, who
  attended him obsequiously to his chair. Five minutes afterwards the trouble
  came.</p>

  <p>Usher heard the clatter of falling dishes and the sound of raised voices,
  and springing from his chair hastened to the screened-off passage from the
  kitchen. The head-waiter, immaculate no longer, but with stained shirt-front
  and eyes almost starting from his head, was held by the throat by the new
  cook's assistant, and on the floor, by the side of a broken dish, was what
  seemed to be a small silver phial, with holes perforated at the top. The
  detective touched it with his foot.</p>

  <p><a id="pic13"
     name="pic13"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1203441h-images/FTQ06-4.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>"Pick up that, sir," he said, recognizing Usher. "I caught him shaking it
  over the sole he was taking to Lord Brentmore."</p>

  <p>Usher stooped down and put it in his pocket. The waiters were beginning to
  gather round.</p>

  <p>"Bring him this way," Usher directed. A minute later they were in an
  unoccupied room at the rear of the building. The detective let go his
  prisoner, who stood for a few minutes breathing heavily.</p>

  <p>"Are you both mad," he asked, with a show at least of indignation. "What
  have I done to be treated like this?"</p>

  <p>"I fancy," Usher answered coolly," that we can answer your question better
  when we have had the contents of this little phial analysed. In the meantime
  the police had better take care of you!"</p>

  <p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"As you will," he answered contemptuously. "I am curious to know, however,
  what I shall be charged with."</p>

  <p>The detective smiled.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I shall be able to tell you better, Mr. Max Meyell," he said,
  "when we have searched the premises of the Waiters' Trades Union. I've had a
  hint about you before."</p>

  <p>There was a blinding flash&mdash;a loud report, and the detective
  staggered backwards. The room was full of smoke&mdash;Usher sprang to the
  door, but he was too late. He wrenched it open. At the end of the passage the
  head-waiter was coming calmly towards him.</p>

  <p>"I am ready for your arrest, sir," he said, bowing and holding out his
  hands, as though for the handcuffs. "I trust that the gentleman inside is not
  hurt, but I was forced to send a message before I could comfortably make the
  acquaintance of your English prison. For Milord Brentmore you need have no
  anxiety; he will very soon be well."</p>

  <p>The detective came out with his left arm hanging helpless.</p>

  <p>"He done us, sir," he said gloomily. There are forty-six German waiters
  here, and Heaven knows which one Ah!"</p>

  <p>He rushed for the telephone. The wire was cut and the instrument smashed.
  Outside a little German waiter, with his coat-tails flying behind him, was
  bending over a bicycle on his way to the post office.</p>

  <p>"Quite a genius," Usher remarked. "Take his revolver away."</p>

  <p>The head-waiter stepped back and bowed professionally. Then, without a
  moment's hesitation, he pressed the muzzle to his forehead and blew out his
  brains.</p>

  <p>"The Fatherland!" he muttered, as he fell in a crumpled heap across the
  threshold.</p>

  <p>"Quite <i>au Japonais</i>," Lord Brentmore remarked when they told him
  about it.</p>

  <p>*****</p>

  <p>Lord Brentmore was playing golf again in two days, and once more the war
  clouds lightened. The premises of the Waiters' Union were duly raided, and it
  was a very harmless lot of documents which fell into the hands of the police,
  and a much injured society who shouted of their wrongs. But another reigns in
  Max Meyell, alias Spielman's place, and many a garret bedroom in Soho or
  thereabouts is still adorned with the waiting rifle.</p>

  <h2><a id="story7"
     name="story7">VII.&mdash;SIR GEOFFREY'S GUEST</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of magazine publication found</h3>

  <p class="first">SIR GEOFFREY POWERS HALLEDEAN, Bart., stood on the hearth-
  rug of his study, with an open letter in his hand and a perplexed frown on
  his brow. Twice he read the offending epistle through &mdash;it was not a
  long one&mdash;and then he rang the bell and summoned his housekeeper. A
  moment or two later there was a soft tap at the door, a rustling of stiff
  black silk, an apologetic cough, and that most discreet of matrons glided
  into the room.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mrs. Burditt," said the baronet, glancing up from his
  letter.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Sir Geoffrey," returned the housekeeper respectfully, and
  added, after a short pause, "I understand from Burditt that you wished to
  speak to me."</p>

  <p>Sir Geoffrey nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I wanted a few words with you about this letter," and he tapped it
  impatiently with his forefinger. "An old friend of mine, a Mr. Comlin, has
  been in India for twenty years and only returned yesterday. The moment he
  reached London he found a cablegram which necessitates his immediate return
  to Ceylon. He doesn't go into details, but says that he has some tea-gardens
  there, and something is wrong with the manager whom he left in charge. It
  seems that he brought his little girl over with him, and dare not take her
  back so soon, as she cannot stand the sea voyage. He has lost sight of all
  his English friends, so of course he doesn't know what to do with her,
  and&mdash;rather unreasonably, I must say&mdash;writes imploring me to have
  her down here until he can get back again, probably in six months' time. He
  appears almost to take my acceptance for granted, for he has secured his
  berth in a steamer which starts this afternoon, and says that he cannot go
  unless I wire him acquiescence. It's uncommonly awkward. What on earth shall
  we do with a child down here?" Sir Geoffrey inquired disconsolately. "And yet
  I can't refuse."</p>

  <p>Perhaps Mrs. Burditt thought that the presence of a little girl might in
  some measure enliven the gloom of Halledean Court, and lighten a little its
  solitude. Anyhow, she seemed in no way inclined to raise difficulties.</p>

  <p>"You can't refuse, Sir Geoffrey," she said decidedly, "and I don't see
  that it will put us about much. There's a large nursery right away in the
  south wing, never been opened for years. She'll be quite out of the way
  there, and won't disturb you a bit. How old did you say she was, sir?"</p>

  <p>Sir Geoffrey referred again to the letter.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that he mentions her&mdash;oh, yes, here it is. Nine next
  birthday. Isn't she almost old enough to send to school?"</p>

  <p>"Dear me, no, Sir Geoffrey," replied Mrs. Burditt. "She'll want a nurse,
  though, and if she stops long, a governess. I'd better engage a nurse for
  her, sir."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," he assented dubiously; "and make any other necessary
  arrangements, Mrs. Burditt. I'll leave the entire matter in your hands, and I
  shall rely upon you to keep her to the south wing of the house as much as
  possible. That is all, I think. Be so good as to tell Thomas to saddle a
  horse at once. I shall want him to ride over to Harborough with a
  telegram."</p>

  <p>The telegram was duly sent, and in a few hours' time came the
  reply:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">A THOUSAND THANKS. CARRY WILL ARRIVE HARBOROUGH STATION
  5.30. GOING OUT THIS AFTERNOON BY THE ATALANTA. WILL WRITE FIRST
  MAIL.</p><br>

  <p>Sir Geoffrey Powers Halledean, of Halledean Court, Leicestershire, and the
  St. James' Club, Pall Mall, was a bachelor and a recluse. Perhaps recluse is
  scarcely a strong enough word, for the life he led was almost the life of a
  hermit. He was the despair of the county, for owning one of the richest
  estates, and being one of the finest horsemen and best-looking men in the
  neighbourhood, he neither hunted nor visited, but simply buried himself in
  his books and writing, and took not the slightest interest in the sports and
  pursuits of those who lived around him. To men this was tantalizing, but to
  women it was worse. It was simply torture to think that within a few miles of
  them lived so desirable a neighbour, who was utterly indifferent to their
  gracious regard and numberless invitations, and who preferred burying himself
  amongst his books and pamphlets to taking his proper place in the society of
  the county, and yielding himself up for a prize to the best-looking or most
  fortunate of the young ladies of the shire. Year followed year, however, and
  found all their efforts to draw him from his seclusion fruitless, and at last
  they gave it up. The men&mdash; some of them&mdash;read his articles in the
  fortnightly and other reviews, and pronounced them uncommonly clever, which,
  of course, increased the vain attempts of their wives to secure him on their
  visiting list and as their guest. He never sat on the bench, and the affairs
  of his estate were altogether in the hands of his steward. He never attended
  a meet, although he gave a hundred guineas yearly to the hunt; his keepers
  shot over his covers at their own sweet will, save on those very rare
  occasions when he had some learned friends down from London who could shoot,
  and Halledean Court, once the most hospitable house in the county, was,
  notwithstanding its owner's large rent-roll, partly closed up.</p>

  <p>Of course there were plenty of stories about, malicious and otherwise,
  which professed to account for this extraordinary seclusion on the part of
  Sir Geoffrey Halladean, and perhaps it would be as well to at once declare
  that they were every one false. The facts were these: Sir Geoffrey had been
  educated for the bar, and had come into the title and estates quite
  unexpectedly when he was twenty-six years old. He was an orphan, and lived
  much alone, was of studious tastes and quiet habits, and he heard of his good
  fortune with something akin to indifference. His principal satisfaction was
  that now he could relinquish his profession, of which he had never been
  particularly fond, and devote his whole attention to branches of study which
  were more congenial to him. He began to read deeply, and if only he had
  commenced his career as a student under a suitable mentor the energy and
  intellect which he readily commanded would have carried him forward without
  doubt into the foremost ranks of the thinkers of the day. But he was
  versatile in his tastes, impressionable by nature, and a trifle morbid and
  pessimistic in his ideas of his fellows, which begat in him a slight
  censoriousness. His appetite for study was insatiable, but not altogether
  healthy. He had flitted from school to school of ancient and latter-day
  philosophy, reckoning himself at various times amongst the disciples of the
  most untenable, until he suddenly discovered the flaw in their doctrine and
  abruptly shifted his quarters. He read everything that came near him,
  reading, therefore, a little that was wholesome and a good deal that was not,
  until at thirty-five years of age it had commenced to dawn upon him that he
  had wasted some of the best years of his life in mastering doctrines and
  tenets which he had afterwards as religiously overthrown in grappling with
  monsters of his own rearing; and, in short, that his multifarious stock of
  learning had won him nothing but the reputation of a pedant, and the most
  decided consciousness that he was still an extremely ignorant and unsatisfied
  man.</p>

  <p>But what was he to do? Avoidance of society becomes a habit more difficult
  to break through than any other, and his many years of rigid solitude had
  developed this habit strongly. He was shy and ill at ease if he came near one
  of the opposite sex; nor could he talk even with men upon everyday subjects
  without embarrassment. He had acquired all the <i>mauvaise honte</i> of the
  bookworm, and he knew that it would be a medicine too nauseous for him to
  seek relief for his disappointments in society. So he burnt all his notes on
  twenty different schools of irrational philosophy, took long walks or rides
  during the mornings, and settled down to study science the rest of the day.
  In person he was tall and finely built, and though constant study had stooped
  his shoulders somewhat, the stoop was not ungraceful. He was dark, with dark
  moustache and unkempt beard, for he never troubled to shave; of somewhat
  pallid complexion and high cheek bones, owing no doubt to his many years of
  intellectual toil; but his features were regular and well cut, and his eyes
  particularly keen and brilliant; in dress he was decidedly a sloven; as,
  indeed, he was in all matters of personal appearance. He was thirty-five
  years of age, and respectively as he was riding or writing looked ten years
  younger or older. Such was Sir Geoffrey Powers Halledean, Bart.</p>

  <p>The matter of the reception of Mr. Comlin's little girl having been
  transferred to Mrs. Burditt's shoulders, and finding her unexpectedly amiable
  about it, Sir Geoffrey troubled himself no more about the affair. He returned
  from his morning's ride about two o'clock, gave orders for a carriage to meet
  the 5.30 train at Harborough station, but had directed that his little guest
  should have tea in the housekeeper's room on her arrival. Then he settled
  himself down to write an article for his favourite review. He heard the
  carriage return from the station, but, being immersed in his subject, did not
  deem it necessary to go out himself to welcome the little stranger. Suddenly
  his door was burst open without any one having knocked&mdash;a thing which he
  never recollected to have happened before&mdash;and on glancing up with a
  reproving frown, he beheld to his utter astonishment a stylishly-dressed and
  extremely pretty young lady crossing the floor towards him with outstretched
  hand and bewitching smile.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Sir Geoffrey Halledean?" she exclaimed brightly. "I am
  Carry Comlin."</p>

  <p>Sir Geoffrey rose to his feet, and stared at the young lady, literally
  open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"Miss Comlin," he repeated vacantly while he mechanically shook hands.</p>

  <p>"Papa had your telegram this morning," she continued, sweeping his
  carefully-written sheets from an arm-chair on to the floor, and coolly
  seating herself. "How awfully good it is of you to have me! You expected me
  by this train, didn't you? I fancied you looked rather surprised when I came
  in."</p>

  <p>"I thought&mdash;there is some little mistake," he faltered. "I understood
  from Mr. Comlin's letter "&mdash; and he commenced a frantic search for it in
  each of his pockets. "You're more than nine years old, aren't you?" he burst
  out desperately.</p>

  <p>"More than nine years old! Oh, Sir Geoffrey, of course I am! How
  ridiculous! I'm nineteen next birthday."</p>

  <p>Sir Geoffrey had at last extracted Mr. Comlin's letter from his pocket,
  and was studying it.</p>

  <p>"So it is, nineteen," he groaned; "I'm sure I thought it was nine. You
  see, Comlin never let me know when he was married, or I don't remember if he
  did. And you're his little daughter. Good heavens! what are we to do?"</p>

  <p>"Do? It doesn't matter much, does it?" said the young lady, who was calmly
  unbuttoning her gloves.</p>

  <p>"Matter?" groaned Sir Geoffrey; "why, I live here quite by myself;
  and&mdash;and there's a nursery for you up in the north wing, and a nurse
  coming to-night; and Mrs. Burditt's been looking out dolls, and Noah's arks,
  and things for you all this afternoon. And they've laid tea for you in the
  housekeeper's room, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off suddenly. She had been listening to him with an amused
  twinkle in her eyes, and was now leaning back in her chair, giving way to
  peal after peal of the merriest and most musical laughter he had ever heard
  in his life. He gazed at her for a moment bewildered, and then, despite a
  strong inclination to ring for Mrs. Burditt, or to make his escape somehow,
  he was suddenly, to his own great astonishment, constrained to resume his
  seat, and join heartily in the laugh, a thing he had not done for years. At
  last she stopped and wiped her eyes&mdash;very blue eyes they were&mdash;with
  a tiny lace handkerchief. He stopped too, and looked at her, and
  then&mdash;there was no resisting it&mdash;they both laughed again.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear! I feel quite exhausted," she said at length, smiling feebly up
  at him from the depths of the easy chair in which she had collapsed. "It's
  too ridiculous, isn't it? A nursery and a Noah's ark! How papa will laugh
  when I tell him!"</p>

  <p>He was beginning to feel frightfully ill at ease again. "Wouldn't
  you&mdash;a&mdash;like to take your things off?" he suggested, with something
  very much like a blush.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I must," she said, rising. "Mrs. Burditt will show me my room:
  I suppose that is your old housekeeper's name, isn't it? And can
  Celeste&mdash;Celeste is my maid&mdash;have one somewhere near me?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, of course," he assented hurriedly. "Mrs. Burditt will make any
  arrangements you like. You can choose your own room after to-day."</p>

  <p>"Thank you so much, Sir Geoffrey. Good-bye. I shan't be long&mdash;"; and
  with a smile and nod, to which he had just presence of mind enough to respond
  with a stiff bow, she vanished.</p>

  <p>Sir Geoffrey closed the door after her, and returned to his seat feeling
  very much like a man in a dream. It was years&mdash;many years&mdash;since he
  had exchanged half a dozen words with a lady, young or old; and now, without
  the least warning, there was a fashionable young lady quartered in the house,
  utterly ignorant of the character of her host, and who would no doubt expect
  to be talked to and amused. It was an awful situation for him. Who was to
  entertain her, and how was he to escape? Should he be taken ill and confined
  to his room&mdash; something with an ugly name, and catching, or but at this
  point his cogitations were interrupted by the appearance of Mrs. Burditt on
  the scene.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's you, is it?" he exclaimed, after a nervous start. "This is very
  awkward, Mrs. Burditt."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Burditt pursed her lips, and looked somewhat glum.</p>

  <p>"It is very awkward, indeed, Sir Geoffrey," she assented.</p>

  <p>"It all arises from Comlin's execrable writing," he continued, pulling out
  the letter. "I'm sure it looks like nine, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Burditt took out her spectacles, and acknowledged that the latter
  part of the word was indistinct.</p>

  <p>"Well, what are we to do with her?" he asked helplessly.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Burditt reflected.</p>

  <p>"The nurse may as well go back again at once," she remarked. "Miss Comlin
  has brought her own maid."</p>

  <p>"But she can't stop here, can she?" queried Sir Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>"I don't know much about these sort of things," he continued nervously;
  "but it wouldn't be considered exactly proper, would it?"</p>

  <p>"Decidedly not, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, what are we to do?" he reiterated impatiently.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Burditt considered for a while.</p>

  <p>"A companion," she suggested doubtfully, "would&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By no means," interrupted Sir Geoffrey hurriedly. "Another like her? No,
  thank you," vigorously.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, there's your aunt, Sir Geoffrey&mdash; Mrs. Prim. Perhaps she
  would come and stop for awhile, if you wrote and asked her."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Prim was a maiden lady of limited means, so the suggestion was
  reasonable.</p>

  <p>"I'll write her at once," declared Sir Geoffrey, seizing a pen. "No, I
  won't, I'll telegraph. Tell Thomas to saddle a horse at once,
  and&mdash;er&mdash;Mrs. Burditt, don't you think it would be better if she
  dined alone, and something was sent in here to me? Couldn't you say that I
  was busy, or something&mdash; anything," he broke off anxiously.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Burditt shook her head. "It would be scarcely kind, sir&mdash;the
  first evening, too," she said deprecatingly.</p>

  <p>Sir Geoffrey groaned. "Well, I'll send that telegram, anyhow," he said,
  writing it out. "Don't forget to tell Thomas, Mrs. Burditt."</p>

  <p>He had scarcely despatched it when the door opened and Miss Comlin
  entered.</p>

  <p>"Do you know that the dinner bell has rung, Sir Geoffrey, and you're not
  dressed yet? Well, I shan't let you go now; I'm too desperately hungry to
  wait," she continued, laughing. "No one seemed to have the least idea what to
  do with me when I came downstairs. The drawing-room's closed up, they said,
  so I came in here. We'll go in to dinner now, if you're ready,
  please&mdash;"; and she laid a tiny white hand upon the sleeve of his shabby
  brown shooting-coat.</p>

  <p>They moved across the magnificent hall, and into the small dining-room, a
  cosy little octagonal chamber really only a recess of the most imposing
  apartment, and separated from it by folding doors. A bright fire was burning
  in the marble grate, and dinner was laid for two on a round table in the
  centre of the room. Miss Comlin glanced around at the massive pictures, the
  wainscoted walls, the antique black oak furniture, and at the table sparkling
  with plate and glass, and gave a sigh of satisfaction as she sank into the
  high-backed chair, which a tall footman gravely held for her.</p>

  <p>"What a charming room, Sir Geoffrey!" she exclaimed approvingly; "and what
  a dear little round table this is! I suppose you always dine here when you're
  alone? I just peeped in at the proper dining-room, and it made me feel quite
  shivery. It's so big. Do you really live in this enormous place all by
  yourself? It must be dull."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I live here by myself," he replied. "But I expect my aunt, Mrs.
  Prim, here to-morrow," he hastened to assure her. "I've telegraphed for
  her."</p>

  <p>"On my account, I suppose. I'm so sorry. I think it much nicer as it is,
  and I hate old women. I'm afraid I shall be a dreadful nuisance, though," she
  added with a smile that seemed to invite contradiction.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you will," he said hesitatingly. "You see, I have a good
  deal of writing to do every day; but I'm quite sure that you'll find it very
  dull indeed. Mrs. Prim is very nice, though," he added consolingly, "if she
  wasn't so deaf."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, I shan't, I'm never dull," she declared confidently. "Sir
  Geoffrey, will you do me a favour?" she whispered, leaning over towards
  him.</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"Then do send that ridiculously solemn footman away. I declare it quite
  takes my appetite away to look at him. We can wait on ourselves."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, by all means. Gravas, leave the room," said Sir Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir," said Gravas, turning round, astounded, from his
  occupation of cutting bread at the sideboard.</p>

  <p>"You needn't wait. We don't want you. We're going to wait upon ourselves,"
  exclaimed Sir Geoffrey with a desperate cheerfulness. He was woefully ill at
  ease, and envied beyond measure his guest's perfect composure.</p>

  <p>Gravas retreated in a dignified manner, with his nose in the air, and
  leaving the bread uncut. His master watched him depart, and envied him.</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad he's gone," remarked the young lady confidently. "I like
  Indian servants best, I must say. They are so graceful, and full of tact;
  altogether different from that pompous old fright. Have you ever been in
  India?"</p>

  <p>Sir Geoffrey had travelled very little, and told her so.</p>

  <p>"No? Well, I like England ten times better than India. I was brought up
  here, you know, and went to school at Brighton until two years ago, when papa
  sent for me to go out to Ceylon. The school was broken up directly I left, or
  I dare say I should have been there now. India didn't suit me a bit; I'm so
  glad to be in England again." There was a short silence, and Sir Geoffrey
  racked his brains in vain for something to say to her.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't it awful for poor papa to rush back to Ceylon before we'd been in
  England twenty-four hours? I was so sorry for him."</p>

  <p>"It was most unfortunate," her host assented fervently; and then he
  ventured a question about the tea-gardens, which she immediately began to
  describe in a most graphic manner. He was interested, and for a while forgot
  his nervousness. On the whole, he got through dinner much better than he
  anticipated. It certainly was a decided novelty, after years of solitary
  banquets, with the silent Gravas and his thoughts for sole companions, to
  have a lively intelligent, and dazzlingly beautiful young lady seated
  scarcely a yard away from him, and keeping him engaged in conversation during
  the whole of the meal. It had not been quite so unpleasant, however, as he
  feared; indeed since the departure of Gravas he had been gradually recovering
  his self-possession to a most astonishing extent. When the time came for the
  removal of the sweets, however, he felt that a difficulty was at hand.</p>

  <p>"I really don't quite know what room there is for you to go to," he
  remarked awkwardly. "Tomorrow the drawing-room or a smaller sitting-room
  shall be got ready, but at present there are only this one and my study in
  habitable condition."</p>

  <p>"Oh, pray don't apologize," begged Miss Comlin, leaning back in her chair
  and leisurely sipping her moselle. "I shall like stopping with you, if I may.
  I don't mind smoking; there is nothing I like better than the smell of a
  cigar."</p>

  <p>"I have a little writing "he commenced timidly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you want to go into the study," she interrupted. "Very well. I may
  come too, mayn't I? Celeste can unpack my fancy-work, and I'll promise to be
  as quiet as a mouse."</p>

  <p>This was not exactly his idea.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that it will be very dull for you," he said. "Wouldn't you
  rather go into Mrs. Burditt's room for an hour? She is an extremely
  respectable woman."</p>

  <p>Miss Comlin shrugged a pair of the whitest shoulders in the world.</p>

  <p>"Are the dolls and the Noah's ark there?" she inquired mischievously. "If
  you had rather I went there, I will, but I should prefer the study."</p>

  <p>Of course, after that, what could he do but give her his arm again and
  take her there? and, having placed an easy chair for her near the fire, poked
  the embers into a blaze, and rung the bell for her maid to bring her
  fancy-work, he retreated to his writing table at the other end of the room.
  He took up his pen, and looked through his papers. Yes, he had left off in
  the middle of a very interesting sentence. He read it through again
  carefully.</p>

  <p>"However highly qualified may be the inquirer into this portentous
  subject, alike by experience and intellect, he may yet fail through having
  imperfectly digested the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>That was where he had left off, and now he dipped his pen in the ink, and
  prepared to dash off the remainder of the sentence. What was it that the
  inquirer ran a risk of imperfectly digesting? He hesitated. It had been as
  clear as day to him when he had commenced the paragraph, but somehow, now the
  whole subject seemed mixed up, in a most incongruous fashion, with blue eyes,
  a dainty figure, and a rippling laugh, and his eyes stole away from the paper
  to where the possessor of these charms was seated, and remained watching a
  little white hand, flashing with diamonds, dexterously passing a needle
  backwards and forwards, through a piece of black satin, and studying the
  graceful outlines of her lithesome figure, as she leaned back in the easy
  chair, with a pair of very shapely little black satin shoes resting upon the
  fender. Presently she laid her work down, and half closed her eyes. No doubt
  she was dull. Ought he not, after all, he thought uneasily, to make some
  effort to entertain her, as it was her first evening? Well, he would v just
  finish this sentence and try.</p>

  <p>"He may yet fail through having imperfectly digested,"&mdash;digested
  what? Bah! it was no good, he was not in a writing mood; he must sacrifice
  this evening; anyhow, he could make it up to-morrow.</p>

  <p>"You are tired, Miss Comlin."</p>

  <p>She started, and opened her eyes, to see Sir Geoffrey standing on the
  hearth-rug beside her, with his elbow on the mantelpiece. How long had he
  been there? she wondered.</p>

  <p>"A very little. Have you finished your writing?"</p>

  <p>He laughed uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Well, I haven't done a lot," he acknowledged with perfect truth. "I am
  scarcely in a working humour."</p>

  <p>A knock at the door, and Gravas enters with the tea-tray. Generally a
  single cup was brought in for Sir Geoffrey, but to-night the tea-pot and
  whole equipage appeared, and were deposited on a small table by Miss Comlin's
  side. A minute later Sir Geoffrey was explaining that he took neither sugar
  nor cream, and was accepting with nervous fingers the delicate gold and white
  cup from a lady's hand the first time for many years.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if there is a piano anywhere?" inquired Miss Comlin as she
  stirred her tea.</p>

  <p>"There are two or three somewhere," he answered carelessly. "There is a
  grand in the drawing-room, which I don't believe has ever been played on, and
  a very fair one in the small dining-room. There's one here, too," and he
  pointed to the corner behind her.</p>

  <p>"May I try it?" and, receiving his ready assent, she put down her cup, and
  seating herself before the instrument struck a few chords.</p>

  <p>"It sounds like a good one, although it's a little out of tune," she
  pronounced. "What shall I play?"</p>

  <p>"Anything&mdash;or something of Mendelssohn's," he added vaguely. To tell
  the truth, Mendelssohn was the only one of the masters whose name, on the
  spur of the moment, he could remember, although once he had been very fond of
  music.</p>

  <p>She paused for a moment to think, and then her fingers glided softly over
  the keys in the musical prelude to one of the inimitable <i>Lieder ohne
  Worte</i>. She played well, and Sir Geoffrey listened eagerly. Many years had
  passed since he had listened to such music, and he was conscious of the
  revival of a pleasure which had been lost to him as he listened to the
  smoothly-flowing melody. When she had finished, she wheeled round abruptly
  and received more than thanks from the gratified smile by which he was
  listening.</p>

  <p>"Shall I play again?" she asked; and taking his silence (for he was in a
  day-dream) for consent, she played on and on, gliding from Mendelssohn to
  Beethoven, from Beethoven to Schubert, and from Schubert back again to
  Mendelssohn. Then she closed the piano and rose.</p>

  <p>He had taken her chair, and was contemplating with curiosity the piece of
  fancy-work gingerly poised in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to finish my crewel-work for me?" she asked, laughing.</p>

  <p>He blushed&mdash;actually blushed&mdash;as he sprang up and relinquished
  his seat.</p>

  <p>"I was wondering what it was?" he said, laying it carelessly down.
  "Crewel-work, is it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, don't you see it's a table-cloth?" she explained. "I do believe it's
  just large enough for this little table. So it is! I'll finish it to-morrow.
  What do you generally do with yourself all day, Sir Geoffrey? Ride, fish,
  shoot, or what? The meets have not commenced yet, have they?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet, I think. I lead a somewhat peculiar life, Miss Comlin, and
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"Will you do me a favour?" she asked, looking up at him with a winning
  smile.</p>

  <p>He bent his head in silence.</p>

  <p>"Well, call me Carry, not Miss Comlin, do! If you won't, I shall call you
  Sir Geoffrey Powers Halledean every time I speak to you, and perhaps you have
  some other names which I could include. You wouldn't like that, would
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," he replied promptly. "I will call you whatever you
  please. I was going to explain to you that I was afraid you'll find it very
  dull here. I generally go for a very long walk or ride in the morning, and
  work all the rest of the day. I don't know any of the people round here, and
  have no visitors. You won't be able to help being dull, unless you're very
  fond of reading," he added disconsolately.</p>

  <p>"I do wish you wouldn't bother about me, Sir Geoffrey," she answered
  cheerfully. "I think it's awfully kind of you to have me here at all; and
  really, I shan't expect you to put yourself out of the way one bit to amuse
  me. I'll go for a walk in the morning, if I may," she added. "You needn't be
  afraid that I can't walk, because I can, and I've got some boots upstairs as
  thick as yours. If you'll take me with you sometimes in the morning, I'm sure
  I can get through the rest of the day."</p>

  <p>Of course he murmured a ready assent, but he was really most dismayed at
  the prospect. When on earth should he be able to digest his reading if his
  solitary walks and rides were done away with? and whatever would people think
  to see him, the bachelor recluse, walking all over the country with d young
  lady? Perhaps they would all call again. The bare idea made him shudder.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to ring for Celeste now, if I may&mdash;oh, thanks, as he
  sprung up and hurried to the bell. "I'm so tired, and I'm sure you'll be glad
  to get rid of me."</p>

  <p>"I assure you "he began ruefully imagining that she was in earnest.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you needn't deny it I " she said laughing. "Good night, Sir
  Geoffrey."</p>

  <p>"Good night, Miss Comlin."</p>

  <p>"Good night, who?" holding up her finger, and shaking her head
  playfully.</p>

  <p>"Good night, Miss Carry." And he crossed the room and opened the door,
  bending his head as she passed out; for there was something in the clear,
  frank glance of those bewitching blue eyes, which made him continually deny
  himself the pleasure of gazing into them. He closed the door, and returned to
  his neglected article; but it did not progress much that night. It was
  scarcely to be wondered at, that so startling an innovation as Carry Comlin's
  presence in his bachelor home should interfere with his thoughts; and while
  to himself he regretted the serious interference to his work which it would
  occasion, he was nevertheless half-conscious of looking forward with, at any
  rate, curiosity, if not with actual pleasure, to her six months' visit.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The next morning, according to his invariable custom, the
  master of Halledean Court rose early and went for his three-mile walk. On his
  return he found Miss Comlin in the breakfast-room, reclining in his easy
  chair and reading <i>The Times</i>.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Sir Geoffrey; you're late," in a comical tone of reproof.
  "I've a good mind to give you your coffee cold. Do you know, I've been up
  three-quarters of an hour, and have been exploring all over the place. I
  believe your gardener thought that I was trespassing, but I explained matters
  to him, and he has given me a rose. Isn't it a beauty?" and she displayed the
  terra-cotta orange bud stuck coquettishly in the bosom of her well-fitting
  morning gown.</p>

  <p>He bent down somewhat stiffly and admired it.</p>

  <p>"I have been out, too," he said. "If I had known you were such an early
  riser, I should have waited for you."</p>

  <p>"How kind of you! Do you know, Sir Geoffrey, I think that this is the most
  charming place I ever saw. I'm longing to get out of doors again. Such a
  splendid morning, too. You will take me for a very long walk, won't you?"</p>

  <p>Of course he would. He persuaded himself that he should be wanting in
  courtesy to his guest if he refused, and that he was making a sacrifice of
  his inclination; but all the time he felt just a trifle hypocritical, for he
  was looking forward to the walk almost as much as she was.</p>

  <p>Breakfast went on merrily, and, before its conclusion, he found himself
  (despite a previously formed intention of being just a trifle more dignified
  and patronizing, as became one so much her elder) laughing at her lively
  remarks, and even trying to cap them, to her unbounded amusement. The moment
  the meal was over she rushed away to put on her things; and Sir Geoffrey, as
  he lit a cheroot and unfolded his paper, decided that, so far as he could see
  at present, he could easily put up with this sort of thing for six months,
  and, indeed, it would not matter very much if Mr. Comlin stayed in Ceylon for
  a very considerable time.</p>

  <p>Soon she reappeared, in a trim, short walking dress and black jacket,
  carrying an ebony walking stick, and evidently quite prepared for a long
  walk. He threw down his paper at once, and hurried off for his hat.</p>

  <p>"I generally go to the stable first for the dogs," he said, when he
  returned. "Do you care to come?"</p>

  <p>"I should like to," she answered readily. "I love horses."</p>

  <p>"There's only a very poor lot of cattle here now," he remarked, as he rang
  the yard bell for Burditt. "If you ride, we must get something for you."</p>

  <p>"Of course I ride, but you mustn't do anything of the sort, Sir Geoffrey,
  please. What a dear little dachshund! Tory, is his name? and the collie is
  Rover? Down, Rover! Down, Tory! I declare they're getting fond of me
  already."</p>

  <p>The tour of the stables was soon made, and Sir Geoffrey felt almost
  ashamed as they passed stall after stall empty, and he noticed the generally
  dismantled appearance of the whole place. There was a pair of very good
  carriage horses, somewhat overfed and under-exercised, but otherwise very
  fair cattle; a trio of very indifferent hacks; an old hunter pensioned off;
  and his own magnificent dark bay, Prince Charles. There was absolutely
  nothing for his guest to ride, and he felt quite angry as he caught her look
  of disappointment.</p>

  <p>"Never mind, Miss Carry," he said, "I shall ride over to Leicester this
  afternoon, and see if I can pick up anything there that will carry you. Do
  you know if that man Horton has got anything decent to sell?" he asked,
  turning to Burditt.</p>

  <p>"Muster 'Orton's allus got some decent cattle, sir," replied the head
  groom. "I seed one or two very decent-looking animals at his yard only the
  day before yesterday. It's a powerful bad time o' the year to buy, though,
  sir. He'll be wanting a rare price if he's got anything as is really
  good."</p>

  <p>Sir Geoffrey thought of his long income, never yet quarter spent, and
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"I shall ride over this afternoon," he decided. "We want a few fresh
  horses."</p>

  <p>"What! and leave me all alone?" exclaimed Miss Comlin disconsolately.</p>

  <p>He smiled at her look of utter dismay.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm afraid there isn't room for two on Prince Charles, is there?"
  he said; "and you wouldn't care about walking by the side, would you?"</p>

  <p>"We might drive," she suggested.</p>

  <p>It was an idea which had not occurred to him. He considered for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," he decided. "The landau at three, Burditt."</p>

  <p>"Don't you ever drive yourself, Sir Geoffrey?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Don't care about it; and besides, I don't think there's anything to
  drive. We'll see, if you like," and they entered the coachhouses.</p>

  <p>There was a mail phaeton, nearly new, with great red wheels, which took
  Miss Comlin's fancy at once.</p>

  <p>"Oh, do drive me in that!" she begged; and Sir Geoffrey, who had not yet
  learnt to refuse her anything, gave the necessary orders.</p>

  <p>Their walk that morning he never forgot. It was a strange experience to
  him, after years of solitary tramps, with Tory and Rover his sole companions,
  to find himself side by side with a well-dressed and charming young lady, who
  expected to be helped over stiles and to be told all about the country. No
  time now for metaphysical speculations, or for leaning against a gate and
  planning his week's work, while Tory, wild after rabbits, deserted him, and
  even the faithful Rover grew impatient. This was a very different sort of
  walk, and very much more appreciated by his canine companions. His solitude
  had been wrested from him, and to his surprise he found society&mdash; such
  society as he had&mdash;far from disagreeable. Indeed, as they got further
  out into the country, the keen, sharp air seemed to exhilarate him as it had
  never done before, and he found himself actually monopolizing the
  conversation, throwing sticks for Rover and jumping ditches with Tory, like
  an overgrown schoolboy, while Carry gave her laughing encouragement to
  everything. When they reached home, mud all over, and, as Miss Comlin
  expressed it, "absolutely famished," he was forced to admit that he had never
  returned from a more enjoyable walk. At luncheon they talked over the
  morning, and petted Tory for his rabbit-chasing exploits, and altogether
  found it a very pleasant meal. Sir Geoffrey's luncheon generally consisted of
  a soda and milk and a biscuit only; but to-day he shared his companion's
  famished condition, and for the first time since he could remember felt
  really hungry. When they withdrew from the table he felt himself thinking,
  with almost a shudder, of his study, in which he always spent the afternoon,
  and looking eagerly forward to his drive. Punctually at three o'clock the
  phaeton came round, and almost simultaneously Carry appeared, in short
  seal-skin jacket and piquant hat. As he watched her drawing on her tan
  gloves, Sir Geoffrey found himself thinking of his own appearance with
  something of dismay. His long driving-coat was not so very shabby, however;
  and, besides, what an idiot he was, he thought, with almost a blush&mdash;as
  if she would notice his appearance!</p>

  <p>He helped her up to the box-seat, lit the cigar which she begged him to
  smoke, and sprang up beside her; and they bowled down the wide avenue, the
  horses arching their necks and keeping well together, though the work was new
  to them. He was a good whip, although he drove so seldom; and with his fair
  companion by his side chattering pleasantly, and his horses quite fresh,
  gnawing at the bit and answering to his slightest touch, he thoroughly
  enjoyed the drive, and kept up the conversation with spirit. Just outside
  Leicester they overtook a barouche, whose occupants leaned right out of the
  carriage, to gaze with astonishment at the bachelor recluse (who was
  popularly supposed to be a staunch misogynist) driving an extremely stylish
  young lady in an irreproachable phaeton. An exclamation from the barouche
  caused Carry to turn her head, and with a £tart of surprise she nodded and
  waved her hand to its smiling occupants.</p>

  <p>"Why, Sir Geoffrey," she exclaimed, "you never told me that Lord
  Hanesborough's place was near here! That was Ida Hanesborough in the back
  seat, and her brother on the box. I suppose the old lady is their mother. How
  delightful! Do they live far away?"</p>

  <p>Sir Geoffrey touched his horses, and they bounded forward, leaving the
  barouche considerably in the rear.</p>

  <p>"We passed close to Hanesborough Hall," he said. "I would have told you if
  I had known that they were friends of yours. Hanesborough Park is the next
  estate to Halledean."</p>

  <p>"How singular! They are scarcely friends of mine; but I was at school with
  Ida, and Jack used to come down and take us out sometimes. Very pleased we
  girls were to see him then." Sir Geoffrey conceived an instant and
  inexplicable aversion to Captain Hanesborough.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'll want to call," he remarked, flicking his horses'
  ears.</p>

  <p>"Well, no; that would be scarcely proper, you know. I expect they will
  call on me. And this is Leicester! What a nice clean town!"</p>

  <p>Sir Geoffrey smiled.</p>

  <p>"We are entering it from the best side," he remarked; "but it really is
  not so bad for a manufacturing town."</p>

  <p>They drove through the streets in silence. Arrived at the stables, he
  pulled up, and lifted her from her seat, and they walked up the yard
  together. The horse-dealer, to whom Sir Geoffrey mentioned his requirements,
  did not know him, and was disposed to be somewhat curt. There was such a run
  after 'osses just now, that he was very near cleared out. and doubted whether
  he had anything to suit. However, they would see what he had, and two or
  three very indifferent-looking animals were trotted up the yard.</p>

  <p>Sir Geoffrey turned away in contempt.</p>

  <p>"If that's a sample of what you have to offer, we needn't detain you any
  longer, I think," he said, moving away.</p>

  <p>Mr. Horton looked at his would-be customer. The long driving coat was
  shabby and old-fashioned, and his hat was old and battered, but there was the
  stamp and bearing of a gentleman about him, which the horse-dealer was not
  slow in detecting; and the girl was thoroughbred, anyhow.</p>

  <p>"You see, sir, it's like this," he said apologetically. "I've got a couple
  of particularly fine animals, but I want to sell them in the neighbourhood,
  if I can, to hunt with Sir Bache's or the Quorn. They'll do me good, these
  animals, that's where it is. Now you don't belong to these parts, sir, I
  think."</p>

  <p>"I am Sir Geoffrey Halledean, of Halledean Court," his customer answered
  shortly, "and if you have anything in your stables worth buying, I will give
  you your price for it. I don't want a miserable screw, like those animals
  we've just seen. I want something that looks well, can go, and will carry a
  lady."</p>

  <p>Mr. Horton removed a straw from his mouth, and took off his hat.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, Sir Geoffrey Halledean, I'm sure, for showing you
  those brutes. Dick, bring out Janette!" he shouted to his assistant. "I've
  got a lovely animal there, Sir Geoffrey, but I didn't want to sell her out of
  the county; that's why I didn't show her you at first, not having the
  pleasure of knowing you."</p>

  <p>Janette was led out, and proved to be a bright bay with dark points,
  nearly thoroughbred, with easy action and perfectly proportioned. Miss Comlin
  was in ecstasies, and even Burditt, who was sent for to give his opinion, had
  not a fault to find.</p>

  <p>"Can she jump?" asked Sir Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Mr. Horton was very eloquent on that score.</p>

  <p>"I should like to try her, if it isn't inconvenient. You have a range
  there, I see."</p>

  <p>A saddle was quickly brought, and Sir Geoffrey divested himself of his
  long coat and mounted. Janette was disposed to be fractious for a moment, but
  her rider's firm hand and reassuring voice quieted her instantly. He trotted
  her up the yard and then put her at the hurdles, which she negotiated
  skilfully.</p>

  <p>"These are not much use in the south Leicestershire country, you know,"
  said Sir Geoffrey, turning in his saddle. "Haven't you something a trifle
  stiffer?"</p>

  <p>A five-barred gate was fetched and easily cleared.</p>

  <p>"'Tain't the first time he's been astride of a 'oss," remarked Mr. Horton
  admiringly to Miss Comlin. "Don't he hold her beautiful at the fences?"</p>

  <p>"I think she'll do," decided Sir Geoffrey, as he trotted down and
  dismounted. "Do you like her, Miss Carry?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do," she answered vigorously. "I think she's perfect. But
  you're not going to buy her for me! You must not, you know, really."</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to buy her for myself," he said. "Now, Mr. Horton," he
  continued, moving a little on one side, "what's her price?"</p>

  <p>"Two hundred guineas, Sir Geoffrey; not a penny less."</p>

  <p>"I didn't offer you a penny less," was the somewhat contemptuous reply.
  "Give me a pen, and I'll write you a cheque. And I shall send for her the
  first thing to-morrow morning," were Sir Geoffrey's last words as he issued
  from the little office a minute later, drawing on his gloves. "Now, Carry,
  are you ready?" He was beginning to find it quite easy to call her Carry
  now.</p>

  <p>"Is there anywhere else you want to call? " he asked as they regained the
  carriage.</p>

  <p>"I should like the Queen and the Whitehall," she said.</p>

  <p>They drove up to the station, and he bought every magazine he could find.
  Then they drove into the town again to call at the saddler's. As they passed
  along the Market Street she suddenly told him to stop. He pulled up, and
  looked at her inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Look in that shop window," she directed.</p>

  <p>He did so. "It's full of hats," he said dubiously.</p>

  <p>She looked up at him with a mischievous smile.</p>

  <p>"You're to go in and buy one!"</p>

  <p>He coloured and laughed.</p>

  <p>"All right; come in and choose one for me, then."</p>

  <p>The hat was soon chosen, and the old one discarded. Then between them they
  discovered other things which he wanted, all of which she gravely selected.
  When they left the shop, he laughing and declaring he was ruined, there was
  quite a large parcel to be stowed away in the phaeton.</p>

  <p>"Any other commands?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're to go to a tailor's now, and have some new clothes made," she
  insisted merrily.</p>

  <p>And of course he went.</p>

  <p>They drove home quickly, for their shopping had taken time, and it was
  getting chilly. As they turned in at the avenue they met a fly lumbering
  down. Sir Geoffrey looked aghast.</p>

  <p>"By jove, I quite forgot! That venerable aunt of mine was to turn up
  to-day. She's evidently arrived."</p>

  <p>They looked at each other blankly.</p>

  <p>"I suppose she has," Carry said with a sigh. "It's rather a nuisance,
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It is," he assented vigorously, bringing his horses up with a jerk at the
  entrance.</p>

  <p>"Sir Geoffrey," she said, as he helped her down, "may I pour out the
  coffee in the morning, please?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her, and burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>"Of course you may, if you like. You shall be housekeeper, and she shall
  be guest."</p>

  <p>She hurried away with a bright nod, and Sir Geoffrey strolled in to meet
  his aunt, feeling rather like a guilty schoolboy. She was a quaint, motherly
  old lady, and though it was rather a shock to her to find a lively and very
  handsome young lady established in her nephew's house, she entertained far
  too great an awe of him to make any remark. As he had assured Carry, she was
  not very dreadful, and went to sleep directly after dinner for the rest of
  the evening.</p>

  <p>The next morning, just as Sir Geoffrey and his guest were starting for
  another country ramble, there was a trampling of horses' hoofs in the avenue.
  Sir Geoffrey strode to the window and frowned.</p>

  <p>"Some friends of yours," he remarked, turning to Carry; "Miss Hanesborough
  and her brother. I shall go on with my writing for a while."</p>

  <p>"You will stay?" she pleaded. "Do!"</p>

  <p>But his old dread of society was upon him, and with a firm negative he
  made his escape.</p>

  <p>They stayed for a long time&mdash;all the morning in fact&mdash;and the
  sound of their merry conversation, which penetrated into his study, somehow
  spoilt his chance of doing much work. At last they came out into the hall,
  and he heard young Hanesborough's cordial "Good-bye," and then some
  conversation in a lower key; finally, they mounted their horses and rode
  away, and immediately afterwards the door of his study was thrown open and
  Carry unceremoniously entered.</p>

  <p>"Too late for a walk before lunch, isn't it?" she said, walking to the
  window to watch her visitors disappear.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. Your friends have gone, then?" he remarked, continuing his
  writing.</p>

  <p>"Yes; and oh, Sir Geoffrey, I may go, mayn't I? Jack, I mean Captain
  Hanesborough, and Ida are going to call for me to-morrow morning, and take me
  to the opening meet of the season. I may ride Janette, mayn't I?" she
  pleaded.</p>

  <p>Sir Geoffrey gulped down the strongest feeling of disappointment which he
  had experienced for a very long time. He had quite made up his mind to
  overcome his antipathy to mixing with his fellows and to have taken her
  himself, and now she wanted to go with some one else. What an ass he was!</p>

  <p>"Of course you can do as you like," he answered quietly. "Janette is quite
  at your service, and any orders you give Mrs. Burditt will be transmitted to
  the stables."</p>

  <p>"Oh, thanks! thanks! thanks! How delightful! And how kind you are, Sir
  Geoffrey! I'm so sorry that you don't hunt. I forgot to tell you that
  luncheon was ready."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Prim and Carry had all the conversation to themselves at lunch-time,
  for Sir Geoffrey hurried through his in grim silence, and before the meal was
  half over abruptly arose.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me, Mrs. Prim," he said hurriedly; "I have some writing
  which I am anxious to get on with."</p>

  <p>"Aren't we going for a walk this afternoon, Sir Geoffrey?" asked Carry
  quietly.</p>

  <p>He hesitated and glanced at her. She was looking down at her plate, and he
  could not see her face; but surely she could not be very anxious about it, or
  she would have looked up at him eagerly, as she had done only a few minutes
  before, when she had asked to go to the meet. No, she didn't care much about
  going, he decided.</p>

  <p>"Not this afternoon, I think," he answered a little coldly. "If you and
  Mrs. Prim care about driving, pray order the carriage," and he retreated into
  the library.</p>

  <p>At dinner time he was disposed to be a little more amiable, but Carry had
  a headache. Later on, when he made his way into the drawing-room for some
  tea, she had gone to her room, and Mrs. Prim was half asleep. Sir Geoffrey
  forgot to ask for his tea, and went back to his study.</p>

  <p>Her headache was quite gone in the morning, to judge by her beaming face
  as she entered the morning room in her trim, well-fitting riding habit. She
  chatted incessantly the whole of breakfast time, and was extremely
  charming.</p>

  <p>"I do wish you were going, Sir Geoffrey," she said sweetly.</p>

  <p>He opened his lips to say that he would go, but before he could get the
  words out there was a trampling of horse's feet in the avenue, and she had
  rushed away to meet her friends. He turned on his heel, and vanished into the
  study.</p>

  <p>It was a magnificent field, and the sport was keen. Carry, with Captain
  Hanesborough and his sister, kept well to the front, but she soon found that
  she was by far the best mounted, and, by a leap which Janette made nothing
  of, placed several fields between herself and her friends, who had to wait
  their turn at the gap. She was getting excited, and never dreamt of stopping
  for them, for there were several scarlet coats and one or two ladies in the
  field in front, and the hounds were in full cry. There was a thick, but not
  very high hedge in front of her, and she was just settling down in her saddle
  for the jump, when an imperative voice behind shouted her to stop, and she
  heard a horse coming up at a thundering gallop. She could see nothing amiss,
  but tightened her hold on the reins and tried to pull up. Janette, however,
  was eager for the jump, and despite her efforts would have gone at it, but
  that her pursuer circled round and, pulling up with a jerk which smothered
  them both with mud, laid an iron hand on Janette's curb and threw her on her
  haunches.</p>

  <p>"You should be more careful, Miss Comlin, when you know nothing of the
  country," said a stern voice. "That hedge is wired, and there is a wired
  railing the other side. Where are your friends?"</p>

  <p>"Sir Geoffrey!" she gasped. "You here! How fortunate that you stopped me!"
  and she gave a little shiver as a more careful inspection showed her the
  warning notice and the obstruction on the other side. "I should have had a
  nasty cropper, shouldn't I? You might have told me that you were coming."</p>

  <p>"You didn't ask me, you see; but here are your friends," he added hastily.
  "There is a gate in the left-hand corner. Turn Janette round, please," and
  before she had realized that he meant to leave her, he had cantered off in
  the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>Carry and her friends had not the best of fortune during the rest of the
  run, and they were never close up. Just at last, however, a lucky detour gave
  them a splendid view of the finish. It had been a trying run over some nasty
  country at a killing pace, and only one huntsman besides Sir Bache and the
  whip showed up at the death.</p>

  <p>"Whoever's the man in the faded pink?" asked one of the Hanesborough
  party. "Hang it! I thought I knew every man in the hunt, but he's a stranger
  to me."</p>

  <p>"So he is to me," said Captain Hanesborough; "but whoever he is he can
  ride like blazes. I never saw a horse better handled. I've seen him before
  somewhere, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"They all turned homewards, and somehow Carry found herself a little
  behind the others with Captain Hanesborough. As they neared Halledean Court
  they drew rein to bid good-bye to one of their party, and while they were
  talking in a group a horseman in a faded scarlet coat and seedy looking tops,
  riding a magnificent dark bay horse, cantered by and raised his hat
  slightly.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" asked every one as soon as he was out of earshot, for they
  recognized him as the man who was leading the field at the death.</p>

  <p>"That is Sir Geoffrey Halledean," said Carry, smiling.</p>

  <p>A bombshell could not have created a greater sensation. That handsome,
  distinguished-looking man, who rode like a centaur, and whom Ida Hanesborough
  declared had the most glorious eyes she had ever seen; the man who had
  apparently retired from the world, and was neither more nor less than a
  hermit!</p>

  <p>"Didn't you see him driving me yesterday?" asked Carry, somewhat surprised
  at the universal bewilderment; for it did not strike her for the moment that
  Ida had only just returned from boarding-school, and that Captain Jack was
  never at home for longer than a month together. Perhaps, too, she scarcely
  realized the utter seclusion in which Sir Geoffrey had lived.</p>

  <p>"We saw that some one was driving you; but, for my part, I was so
  astonished to see you at all," exclaimed Captain Hanesborough, "that I
  couldn't take my eyes off you to look at any one else. Besides, you passed so
  quickly."</p>

  <p>"I call it a regular downright shame!" declared his sister vigorously. "Do
  you know, Carry, he absolutely refuses to know us, though mamma has pestered
  him with invitations? He is absolutely unapproachable. How I envy you! I
  declare I've fallen in love with him."</p>

  <p>Carry's lips curled a little as she pulled up at the lodge gate.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure Sir Geoffrey would be extremely flattered," she said. "Shall I
  tell him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care if you do," replied Miss Hanesborough laughing. "We shall
  come for you tomorrow," she called out.</p>

  <p>"But I don't think you'd better," said Carry, turning round on her saddle.
  "I shall"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense!" declared Miss Hanesborough; "I couldn't keep Jack away if
  I wanted to; and, besides, I'm dying to see Sir Geoffrey again. We may drop
  across him, you know. <i>Au revoir</i>," and she cantered away waving her
  hand.</p>

  <p>Several weeks of Miss Comlin's stay at Halledean Court passed away. The
  Hanesboroughs were indefatigable in calling for her, and in taking her with
  them for rides to the meet, and home to dinner at Hanesborough hall, on which
  occasions Mrs. Prim always accompanied her. Sir Geoffrey made no sign of
  annoyance at her constant absence, but had relapsed more rigidly than ever
  into his former self, and his misanthropical habits; and even when Carry and
  Mrs. Prim were at home he never entered the drawing-room. He had not appeared
  in the hunting-field again, nor did he show any signs of intending to follow
  up his splendid debut. Once she had summoned up courage to ask him to take
  her to a meet, and he had hesitated and changed colour.</p>

  <p>"Are your friends not coming for you, then?" he had asked; and she had
  been obliged to tell him "Yes," wishing in her heart that they were not.</p>

  <p>"Then there is no necessity for me to go," he had said coldly; and after a
  moment's awkward silence he had made his escape into his sanctum.</p>

  <p>She had never asked him again. Once or twice, as they were returning from
  the meets, Sir Geoffrey had passed them on Prince Charles; and on each
  occasion, to her secret annoyance, she had been riding with Captain
  Hanesborough. His bow, though always polite, was stiff and ceremonious, and
  on those evenings he was gloomier than usual. One evening, about a month
  after her arrival, he was busy writing in his study, when there was a timid
  knock at the door; and in response to his impatient "Come in," Carry
  entered.</p>

  <p>He rose with no very pleased face, and, with a lingering glance at his
  papers, placed a chair for her.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything I can do for you, Miss Comlin?" he said shortly. He
  never called her Carry now.</p>

  <p>"N&mdash;no, nothing particular," she said, toying with her rings and
  regarding them intently. There was a short silence, during which he resumed
  his seat, and fidgeted nervously with his pen.</p>

  <p>"Sir Geoffrey," falteringly.</p>

  <p>"Miss Comlin."</p>

  <p>"I have something to ask you."</p>

  <p>He bowed his head and waited.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I think I must have offended you," she went on, speaking
  hurriedly, with her eyes fixed on the floor. "The first two days I was here
  you were so nice, and everything was delightful, and now you don't take
  the&mdash;the slightest notice of me, and&mdash; and I don't like it, and I
  think I'd better go away, please."</p>

  <p>Something suspiciously like a sob followed the termination of her little
  speech, and something very much like a tear dropped on to the carpet.</p>

  <p>Sir Geoffrey pretended to notice neither, but his voice was lower than
  usual when he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I did not think it made any difference to you," &mdash;with eyes fixed
  upon his desk as he spoke. "Of course I was very pleased to do my best to
  entertain you while you were here alone. But you have friends now more of
  your own age and disposition. I'm not a very agreeable companion, you know.
  I've lived a solitary life so long that I've become stupid and dull. The
  Hanesboroughs are very nice friends for you, and I'm glad you get on so well
  with them. I should only be a kill-joy if I joined you."</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell you something, Sir Geoffrey?" she asked gently. He did not
  answer, and she continued, "I enjoyed those first two days better than any
  since. There!"</p>

  <p>Sir Geoffrey could scarcely believe his ears. He felt in a strange state
  altogether.</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Supposing they, the Hanesboroughs, were not to come again," she went on
  hesitatingly, "would &mdash;would it be like that again?"</p>

  <p>"I daresay it may be," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, you are my guardian for the present, aren't you? so I feel
  that I ought to tell you. Captain Hanesborough&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well," impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Wants me to marry him, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well," more impatiently still.</p>

  <p>"And, of course, I refused."</p>

  <p>"Why?" with the most ridiculous and evident affectation of
  carelessness.</p>

  <p>"Because I don't care for him. " He threw down his arms and
  surrendered.</p>

  <p>"Carry, do you care for any one else?"</p>

  <p>She stole a glance at him. He was pale, and his hands were shaking
  nervously.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I might do, if some one were to ask me," she said demurely.</p>

  <p>And some one did ask her, for she is now Lady Halledean.</p>

     name="story8">VIII.&mdash;A SPRIG OF HEATHER</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of magazine publication found</h3>

  <p class="first">THAT was a halcyon month for Fred and for me&mdash;the month
  we spent with Dick down at his bungalow on the Norfolk coast. Never was
  anything more opportune than Dick's invitation. We were in one of the
  tightest corners I ever remember. David had turned rusty; nothing that we
  could either of us turn out seemed in the least to satisfy those mysterious
  purchasers of his. He had put his foot down firmly. He would not look at
  another picture for a month! And there we were, owing three weeks' rent, and
  our credit pledged up to the hilt at every commercial establishment in the
  neighbourhood. Even Jones, the tobacconist &mdash;Jones, the long-suffering
  and good-natured&mdash; had grumbled at that last half-pound of flake we had
  sent for, and had enclosed in the box our joint account, with an expression
  of his peremptory desire for some manner of settlement. And with it all the
  thermometer was ninety degrees in the shade, and the air of Stile's Row was
  foetid. We sat in our shirt-sleeves before the open window and stewed. The
  sight of a cab passing by laden with seaside luggage, steamer chairs, and
  travelling easel, white umbrella and golf clubs, came like the last straw.
  Fred got up and kicked our one hassock to the other end of the room.</p>

  <p>"Oh, d&mdash;n!" he exclaimed savagely. "I beg your pardon, old chap. It's
  so beastly stuffy."</p>

  <p>I murmured a sympathetic assent. It was undeniably stuffy.</p>

  <p>"Fancy," Fred continued softly, with his eyes fixed upon me, "fancy a
  strong fresh sea breeze, just a dash of brine in it, you know, and sunshine
  fresh from heaven&mdash;not focussed upon us through the fogs and evil odours
  of this Sodom of a city! Bah! isn't it enough to make a man sick with
  longing?"</p>

  <p>"It is," I groaned. "Pass the tobacco and shut up."</p>

  <p>I relit my pipe, and Fred followed suit. The blue cloud around us grew
  thicker, and our hearts grew heavier. Then came Dick bounding into the room
  with hot, eager face and a roar of greeting.</p>

  <p>"Hurrah! you fellows," he exclaimed. "I've an idea. Where's my pipe?"</p>

  <p>He went to the mantelpiece and selected his own cherished briar. He still
  kept it in the old place, although sometimes we saw nothing of him for a
  month together.</p>

  <p>"Hand over the baccy," he continued, after a preliminary and apparently
  satisfactory blow down the stem.</p>

  <p>Fred passed the already half-empty box, with a dismal glance at its
  diminishing contents. Dick helped himself recklessly. His pipe had a large
  bowl, and he pressed the tobacco down with an iron fore-finger. I began to
  foresee the climax of our miseries&mdash;a tobaccoless evening.</p>

  <p>"How are things?" he inquired tersely.</p>

  <p>"Bad," Fred growled.</p>

  <p>"Disgustingly bad," I echoed.</p>

  <p>"Ah, I thought they might be," Dick continued, with unabated cheerfulness.
  "Wrong time of the year to work. Wrong time of the year to try and sell
  pictures. Now, you chaps, attention!"</p>

  <p>We composed ourselves to listen. Dick had evidently something to say. He
  waited until his pipe was well alight, and then commenced.</p>

  <p>"You fellows, you know, haven't treated me exactly well since I came into
  my tin," he said slowly. "I haven't said much about it, but I'm going to give
  my little growl now. You won't come to see me because I live at Mayfair. You
  wouldn't even come to shoot with me last September because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I laid my hand upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Dick!" I said firmly. "We've been through all this before.
  What's the good of it? You know why we don't come. Our ways are not Mayfair
  ways, neither are our clothes. It's good of you to want us, but it's no go.
  We shouldn't be comfortable, and you wouldn't."</p>

  <p>"And as to shooting," Fred put in, "we haven't a gun between us, nor any
  of the rig-out. Owen's quite right. We're glad to see you here, Dick, and
  we're glad&mdash;jolly glad&mdash;that you don't forget us. I hope we'll
  always be pals&mdash;the three of us &mdash;and all that; but it's no use
  closing our eyes to facts, is it? You belong to a different world now. You
  didn't come here to kick against the pricks again, surely?"</p>

  <p>Dick cheered up. A gleam of satisfaction shone in his blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"No, I did not," he assented. "The fact is, I've got you this time on
  toast, both of you. I saw an advertisement in last week's
  <i>Field</i>&mdash;bungalow to let on the Norfolk coast, close to sea;
  bathing, fishing, golf, and all the rest of it. I went down the day before
  yesterday and took it straight away. Now listen to me seriously. This is not
  a request; it is not an invitation. I insist upon it. You two fellows have
  just got to pack up and go down with me to-morrow. Not one other soul is
  going to be there except the servants. We'll have a glorious time. You can
  make it pay, too! Lots of pretty bits among the cliffs, and such a sea! Fred,
  old boy, it's on, isn't it? Owen, old chap?"</p>

  <p>Fred and I exchanged rapid glances.</p>

  <p>"No other visitors, did you say, Dick? None of your own people even?" I
  inquired, with assumed carelessness.</p>

  <p>"Not a soul except us three, I pledge you my word," Dick declared
  earnestly. "No pier, no dressing-up, or promenading, or any of that sort of
  thing. Just flannels and a good old comfortable time."</p>

  <p>Fred went to our vaulting-bar and performed a fancy acrobatic feat of his
  own invention.</p>

  <p>"Hurrah!" he exclaimed, coming down upon his head. "It's on! Good old
  Dick!"</p>

  <p>And in a more dignified manner I signified our acceptance of Dick's
  invitation.</p>

  <p>What a time that was&mdash;what a halcyon month! It stands for ever in the
  wilderness of our memories, marked with a great white stone. The bungalow was
  simply perfect. It stood on a little tableland of green lawn, between two
  mighty cliffs, with a forest of pines and firs behind, and the sea, the sea
  sparkling, stretched away in front. The first breath of the place as we drove
  from the station in the evening was like a strong, sweet tonic, and that
  night we were like children, walking backwards and forwards upon the cliffs,
  sniffing the breeze, and watching the lights far out at sea.</p>

  <p>We breakfasted the next morning in a long, low room, whose open windows
  looked full upon the German Ocean&mdash;and such a breakfast it was! Dick was
  always famous at the commissariat! Stile's Row seemed very far away.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you fellows care about swimming," Dick said, as we
  filled our pipes.</p>

  <p>"There are steps right away down to the beach from the bottom of the
  garden there, and I've had a tent fixed up and some bathing togs sent in.
  What do you say?"</p>

  <p>What did we say? Not much. But with the first plunge into the salt water
  the burden of years was gone, the poison of weariness and disappointment had
  glided from out our veins and faded away in thin air. We were boys again,
  animal creatures only, glorying in our strength and the power of cleaving
  those long blue waves, whose murmuring and gurgling in our ears was like the
  sweetest of all music. Stroke for stroke, shoulder to shoulder, through the
  cool, rushing waters we swam. I opened my arms to the sea, and the joy of it
  was like the joy of fine wine. Most glorious of all physical emotions is the
  delight of meeting and buffeting those rolling waves.</p>

  <p>That was a halcyon time indeed. Dick had a little yacht there, and we
  sailed her up and down the coast, lounging on the deck, with the sunlight we
  had longed for all around us and the salt spray flying in our faces. At the
  end of a week or so we began to feel a healthy desire for work, and on one
  hot day we fetched out our easels and settled down upon the cliffs in a spot
  where only choice of subject was difficult. And on that first day commenced
  our episode.</p>

  <p>Our episode, of course, was feminine. She came up behind us with Dick and
  her father, just as we had got fairly to work. She had brown hair, which
  rippled and waved as a woman's should, a curiously childlike face, and large
  soft eyes. She was wearing a brown holland gown with a bunch of heather stuck
  in her bosom. She was fresh, and sweet, and well bred. That is all I know
  about her. Fred could have gone on describing her for an hour, but this is
  not Fred's story.</p>

  <p>General Chesham, her father, lived in the white house we could see through
  the trees, and he was Dick's nearest neighbour. He was an Anglo-Indian,
  genial, hearty, and good-humoured. They stayed for some time, and the girl
  talked all the while to Fred, preferring, as I could see, his dashing style
  and easy manipulation of colour to my own slower and, in a sense, more
  laborious work. I never knew what they talked about then or on those other
  days; but they certainly did talk a good deal, and to some purpose. Morning
  after morning she came gliding down to us, flitting in and out of the pine
  trees in her father's grounds, a soft white figure in the glancing sunlight,
  and blithely crossing the cliffs towards our chosen spot, with a man-servant
  behind bearing her easel. She, too, painted not at all badly, and she was
  never weary of talking about art, and the beauty of devoting one's life to it
  To amuse her, Fred would tell her stories of our life in London, dwelling
  only on the bright side of it, treating our impecuniosity as a joke, and
  blurring over our hardships. She sat and listened as though entranced. She
  was by no means an ordinary girl, and sometimes as I watched her face
  upturned to Fred's I became conscious of a dim feeling of uneasiness. I
  wished that her father would interfere. She certainly had more liberty than
  was good for her. But, after all, it seemed to be no business of mine. It was
  the first holiday I had had for years, and it might be the last for many
  more. I put away all thoughts of trouble. I would have none of them. The days
  were golden with June sunshine, and sweet with the perfume of fragrant winds.
  I read poetry among the cliffs, and now and then I began to dream again. Not
  altogether happy dreams are those when youth&mdash; or, at any rate, youth's
  most buoyant season&mdash;has gone, and a bushel of bright hopes has changed
  into a handful of dry sticks. Yet I was thankful enough to find that the
  capacity still lingered. To be past the age of dreams is to stand upon the
  threshold of death&mdash;the death of mediocre content, or mortally wounded
  sensibility. So I was glad to plant my foot once more&mdash;even though with
  difficulty&mdash;upon the borderland of the world of strange fancies, that
  glittering world of dreams. For while I dreamed of dead things Fred was
  drifting into a living trouble. I was walking homewards one evening through
  the heather, when I came suddenly upon two figures. Their easels were side by
  side; a field of waving scarlet poppies and yellowing corn ran down the
  sloping cliff to the sea before them. But they were not painting. She was
  standing, bending over him, her hands upon his shoulders; he was leaning
  forward, with his head bent low; and the light upon their faces was that
  light which comes but once in a lifetime, and which no man can mistake.</p>

  <p>I dropped my easel with a crash, and they both started round.</p>

  <p>"How you frightened us, Mr. Wrathall!" the girl cried, looking at me with
  flushed face and not too friendly aspect.</p>

  <p>"Not so much as you frightened me," I answered gravely. "We shall have to
  hurry, shan't we, Fred?" I added.</p>

  <p>The colour had mounted to his sunburnt brow, but he met my steady gaze
  fearlessly. I had done wrong to doubt Fred for a moment. Poor old chap! I
  passed my arm through his when the girl had gone. He commenced at once. His
  voice shook several times. Poor old chap!</p>

  <p>"It isn't my fault, Owen," he said; "at least, I think not. I have never
  said a single word to her which her father might not have heard. I see,
  though, that it was not well for us to have been together so much. I thought
  that I was the only one who could suffer. I used to be fond of girls, you
  know&mdash;that sort of girl; and lately&mdash;well, the kind of feminine
  society we can command isn't exactly edifying, is it?" he broke off, with a
  hard little laugh. "Well, it's over."</p>

  <p>I pressed his arm.</p>

  <p>"Brace up, old chap!" I murmured. "We've had a glorious time.
  Nine-thirty's the morning train, I think. You can manage that?"</p>

  <p>He nodded, and we went in to dinner. I felt a brute, but what else was
  there to do?</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Stile's Row had never seemed more cheerless than when we
  slowly trudged up those interminable flights of stairs and unlocked our door.
  Yet I, at any rate, was a better man. We were both sunburnt&mdash;as brown as
  berries&mdash;and we were bringing back work which we should have no need to
  hawk about. We could pay our debts, and start with a bit in hand. We talked
  this over, smoking a late pipe, and Fred did his best to be cheerful. When we
  parted we smiled quite bravely.</p>

  <p>"Don't you bother about me, Owen," he said, as we clasped hands the last
  thing&mdash;an old habit of ours. "I'm hit, but not mortally. And&mdash;and I
  wouldn't be without the memory of that month&mdash; not for worlds."</p>

  <p>His voice shook a little, and we both looked out of the window at the
  entrancing vision of grey roofs stretching away in a dreary wilderness to the
  smoke-begrimed horizon. Then we went to our hard little beds and made mild
  jokes at our short lapse into luxury. But when I woke up in the middle of the
  night, Fred was sitting on the window-sill, half dressed, and smoking. I let
  him be. A fellow with grit in him gets over those things better without
  sympathy. I too had spent nights like that. Memory is a sweet torturer; yet
  who would not sometimes be a victim?</p>

  <p>We sold our pictures well, and we went to work in grim earnest. A month
  passed. Then, one night, there was a timid knock at the door, and she walked
  in.</p>

  <p>I sprang to my feet and stood between them. Fred was off his guard with a
  sudden joy, and had I not been there she would have been in his arms.</p>

  <p>"Miss Chesham!" I exclaimed breathlessly. "Are you alone?"</p>

  <p>She set down a dressing-bag which she had been carrying, and for a moment
  her eyes met mine defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am. I have run away. I am going to be an artist. I was miserable
  at home."</p>

  <p>She held out her hands to Fred. He took them gravely; but he kept her at
  arm's length.</p>

  <p>"Do they know where you have come?" I asked sternly.</p>

  <p>She shook her head, impatient at my questioning.</p>

  <p>"No. I shall write and tell them presently. Mr.
  Montavon&mdash;Fred&mdash;you are not angry? You don't seem at all pleased to
  see me!"</p>

  <p>I suppose she knew that he cared, and she had hoped to find him alone. But
  I stood between them.</p>

  <p>"You ought not to have come here," I said. "It is not a fit place for
  you."</p>

  <p>Her lips trembled. She stamped her foot. She was half crying, half
  furiously angry with me. For all her child's face, she was bewitchingly
  pretty.</p>

  <p>"I did not come here to see you," she exclaimed. "You have no right to
  interfere. You are very horrid. Fred, say that you are glad to see me!"</p>

  <p>"I cannot," he answered hoarsely. "Wrathall is right; it sounds cruel, but
  it is right! This is not a fit place for you! You must go away!"</p>

  <p>"I cannot," she answered doggedly. "I do not know a soul in London. I have
  some money, plenty of money, and I am going to take a studio here, and paint.
  You talk to me as though I were a child. I am not a child. I am a woman, and
  women do those things, I know. You treat me as though I were a girl who had
  run away from school. Don't be cruel, please! Let me stay here! I shall be no
  trouble, and I want to take that empty studio you told me about. I do not
  mind roughing it&mdash;not a little bit, Fred!"</p>

  <p>He shook his head bravely. He could not trust himself to speak. She sat
  down on an empty box &mdash;our last chair had given way&mdash;and sobbed.
  Fred and I looked at one another. We had neither of us contemplated anything
  like this. I went up to him.</p>

  <p>"Will you leave it to me, Fred?" I asked, laying my hand upon his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Take her away, old chap&mdash;quickly."</p>

  <p>I snatched up my hat, and, hastily slipping oft my smock, put on my most
  decent coat.</p>

  <p>"Miss Chesham," I said firmly, "will you come with me, please?"</p>

  <p>She stood up, wiping her eyes.</p>

  <p>"No, I won't!" she answered. "I hate you! Fred!"</p>

  <p>He shook his head and kept away from her.</p>

  <p>"You don't seem to understand," he said quietly. "Look around you. This is
  where and how we live. How&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's all right, only it wants a good cleaning," she interposed. "Those
  cabinets are dreadful. Your landlady ought to be ashamed of herself."</p>

  <p>"I daresay," Fred continued, "she thinks the same of us. We are nearly
  always behind with our rent. We earn just enough to keep body and soul
  together&mdash;and only just enough. There is not a woman in the whole
  building. It is not a fit place for women."</p>

  <p>"You do not care for me!" she cried, with feminine irrelevance. "You have
  forgotten those days!"</p>

  <p>"I shall never forget them," he answered; "but you must go away. Go with
  Wrathall, please. Do as he tells you. It is best."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand to him, and he raised it gently to his lips. Then
  she let me lead her gently down the stairs. Her own eyes were blinded with
  tears. Outside we found a hansom, and I handed her in.</p>

  <p>"Eighteen, Hereford Gardens," I told the driver. She pulled down her veil,
  and we spoke never a word all the way. I knew that she hated me. Yet she did
  everything as I told her.</p>

  <p>A man-servant opened the door. To my great relief, his mistress was at
  home. She came to me in a moment or two&mdash;a stern-faced, grey-haired old
  lady, yet kindly enough, as I knew well. When she saw me, she stopped
  short.</p>

  <p>"What, Owen," she cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes, aunt," I answered. "I have come to ask you a favour. This young lady
  is the daughter of General Chesham, of Norfolk, and, owing to an unfortunate
  accident, she finds herself in London alone. Will you receive her as your
  guest until her father can take her away?"</p>

  <p>She held out her hand to the girl, and I breathed freely.</p>

  <p>"I had hoped, Owen," she said, with a shade of reproach in her tone, "that
  the first favour you have thought fit to ask me would have been for yourself.
  However, I shall be exceedingly glad to receive Miss Chesham. I know her
  father quite well."</p>

  <p>I left them together, and walked back with a sense of huge relief. Fred
  was striding up and down the studio waiting for me.</p>

  <p>"I have left her at my aunt's in Hereford Gardens," I said. "She will be
  all right there."</p>

  <p>"You are a brick!" he declared. He knew that it had cost me something to
  ask that favour.</p>

  <p>"And now we must telegraph to her father," I reminded him. "What shall we
  say?"</p>

  <p>But there was no need to write that telegram. There was a sharp knock at
  our door, and the General himself appeared upon the threshold. He was white
  with fury. Fred was standing by his easel, and he marched straight up to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Where is my daughter?" he thundered. "What have you done with her, you
  blackguard?"</p>

  <p>I stepped between them.</p>

  <p>"Your daughter, General Chesham, is quite safe," I told him. "She is with
  my aunt, Lady Wrathall, at Eighteen, Hereford Gardens."</p>

  <p>He drew a long breath and looked at me from underneath his bushy
  eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Are you telling me the truth, sir?" he asked sternly.</p>

  <p>"We are neither of us," I answered, "in the habit of telling untruths; nor
  are we accustomed to be addressed in such a fashion. Your daughter called
  here about an hour ago. We gathered that she had left home unknown to you,
  and we persuaded her to go to my aunt's. I have just returned from escorting
  her there."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand. "Sir, I thank you," he said. "I apologize. Mr.
  Montavon, pray forgive my use of so unwarrantable an epithet. I was excited
  and nervous. Pray accept my apology." Fred shook hands with him silently.
  Then he turned to me again.</p>

  <p>"Eighteen, Hereford Gardens, I think you said? I will go there at
  once."</p>

  <p>"It would be as well," I answered. "Allow me to light you downstairs."</p>

  <p>When I returned Fred was groping upon the floor. He got up with a little
  sprig of heather in his hand. I pretended not to see him slip it into his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"What mad creatures girls are!" I remarked, lighting my pipe, with my back
  to him.</p>

  <p>"Very," he answered absently.</p>

  <p>The girl's name was Dorothy.</p>

  <h2><a id="story9"
     name="story9">IX.&mdash;LADY PRICE'S COMPANION</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of magazine publication</h3>

  <p class="first">LADY BEATRICE PRICE had reached that stage of a woman's
  existence when a husband becomes merely a possibility, although a very
  desirable possibility; and the idea had commenced to suggest itself to her
  that she ran a very fair chance of ending her days an old maid.</p>

  <p>It was not her fault, poor girl! Through seven long seasons (she had
  missed one or two) had she answered to the roll-call of society, and had
  unflinchingly gone through the prescribed course of <i>matinées</i>, drives
  in the Park, lounges through picture galleries, garden-parties, receptions,
  dinners, and dances. Never had she been unduly coy when an eligible took her
  in to supper, or failed to accord an attentive ear and gracious smile when he
  leaned over her chair. She was not ill-looking; for although now the wear and
  tear of season after season had given to her fair features a somewhat passee
  appearance, she had, nevertheless, during her first year or two been
  considered somewhat of a beauty; and only a combination of the most
  fortuitous circumstances had prevented her from securing a prize.</p>

  <p>The Duke of &mdash;&mdash; was reported to have been dead gone on her, and
  certain it was he followed her about with great assiduity, when his mother's
  death suddenly called him to Scotland. And, alas! when they met again the
  flame had died away, and she failed to rekindle it. There is no need,
  however, to go into these matters and explain how circumstances had gone
  against Lady Beatrice. Suffice it to say, that at thirty years of age (she
  only owned to twenty-five) Lady Beatrice Price was still unmarried, and it
  was not of her own choosing that this was so. She was an orphan, and her
  brother and two sisters were all married. Therefore she had a
  companion&mdash;a Miss Laura Dorse.</p>

  <p>Now, why Lady Beatrice should have chosen this young lady for a companion
  is a matter for some surprise, for ladies who are gliding through their youth
  on oiled wheels do not generally care for a companion ten years their junior,
  and very much their superior in looks. Nevertheless, Miss Laura Dorse was
  certainly a remarkably nice-looking girl, a brunette with laughing eyes and
  piquant chin, and altogether charming. It is a wonder that Lady Beatrice
  should have chosen such a companion; but she did, and they appeared to get on
  very well together.</p>

  <p>It was towards the end of July, and London was empty. Lady Beatrice was
  sick of London, of society, and almost of life.</p>

  <p>"You are not looking well, my lady," remarked Miss Dorse one morning, with
  much anxiety in her tone, and very little in her heart. "Your ladyship looks
  absolutely seedy."</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice stretched herself and yawned. "I am <i>ennuyée</i>," she
  declared, "bored to death. We will go down to Pennedis&mdash;"; and to
  Pennedis they went.</p>

  <p>Pennedis was an insignificant Cornish fishing village, where Lady Beatrice
  had a small property. The house was a large rambling building, fairly well
  kept up, for its mistress was not an infrequent visitor. It suited her,
  sometimes even in the middle of the season, to rush down here for a week,
  and, having imbibed a fresh supply of health and brightness from the pure air
  and invigorating breezes, to hurry back to town, and lose it all again in the
  whirl and bustle of the routine of society.</p>

  <p>Miss Dorse liked these visits, brief though they were, for she was a
  healthy little thing, and preferred the country to the town; besides, in the
  latter, Lady Beatrice had continually her presence, and seldom let her out of
  her sight; but at Pennedis it was otherwise. She liked long walks, and Lady
  Beatrice, though she could not walk herself, could scarcely be so exacting as
  to deprive her companion of so innocent and simple an amusement.</p>

  <p>Well, down to Pennedis they went, Miss Dorse exultant, Lady Beatrice
  worn-out and depressed. It was beginning to dawn upon her that she could not
  stand many more seasons in town, and that it was almost time for her to
  abandon her vain quest after a husband&mdash;for that was what it really
  meant&mdash;and settle down at Pennedis to her doom of spinsterhood. Perhaps
  her disappointments made her just a trifle ill-tempered and irritable.
  Certain it is that Miss Dorse hailed with delight the prospect of a little
  more liberty, and a little less supervision from her far from immaculate
  mistress.</p>

  <p>Pennedis was glad to see them; in fact, Pennedis received them with open
  arms; but as all its inhabitants were tradespeople, who might be expected to
  profit by their coming, its welcome did not count for much. Neither Lady
  Beatrice nor her companion were much impressed thereby.</p>

  <p>The day after their arrival Miss Dorse went for one of her long walks;
  when she returned her cheeks were much flushed, and she looked quite
  bewitchingly pretty. She had had such an adventure! had lost her way, and had
  been put right, and, indeed, escorted, by the curate in charge of the parish.
  Such a nice man he was! He would have called that afternoon, only he was
  afraid they they would scarcely be settled yet, but he did hope to see them
  at church on the morrow.</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice shrugged her shoulders and went on with her novel, very
  little interested. It was probable that a curate at Pennedis would be a short
  man with red hair and freckles, and champagne bottle shoulders. She was
  rather a connoisseur in men's looks, and her experience of country curates
  was not promising; so she merely nodded tranquilly, and made no remark.</p>

  <p>The next day was Sunday, and, as was her invariable custom when in the
  country, Lady Beatrice, accompanied by Miss Dorse, went to church. When she
  had swept up the aisle, preceded by the obsequious pew-opener, into her
  cushioned seat, and, having arranged her rustling draperies, glanced
  carelessly around, she was at once conscious of a great surprise. The curate,
  whose probable appearance she had mentally derided, was a tall, powerfully
  built, and extremely handsome man, having far more the appearance of an
  officer in the Dragoons than a country curate. Lady Beatrice was at once
  conscious of a much-increased interest in the service, and detected herself
  secretly regretting that she had not taken a little more pains with her
  <i>toilette</i>, although such regret was altogether unnecessary, for she
  appeared then, as she always appeared, a stylishly dressed, somewhat
  <i>blasée</i> woman of the world. The Rev. George Westaby went through the
  service and read the lessons in a rich, melodious voice, and during the
  sermon, by no means a long one, his dark eyes rested continually upon her
  ladyship's pew. If it had not been too ridiculous, though, Lady Beatrice
  could almost have declared that they rested oftenest upon her companion's
  demure visage; anyhow, she felt it her duty to administer a few short words
  of reproof on their way home, with regard to that little episode of
  yesterday, which reproof Miss Dorse felt quite sure would not have been
  administered had the curate turned out to be, as Lady Beatrice had imagined
  him, red-haired, freckled, and champagne bottle-shouldered.</p>

  <p>On the following afternoon Lady Beatrice donned one of her most becoming
  gowns, and appeared in the drawing-room with a book of somewhat more sombre
  appearance and contents than it was her wont to read. Miss Dorse felt that
  there was a purpose in this, and, pleading a headache, remained at home too,
  instead of taking her usual long ramble. At precisely four o'clock, just as
  they had laid down their books to welcome the afternoon tea-tray, a caller
  was announced, and the Rev. George Westaby was shown in.</p>

  <p>He was, beyond question, an extremely handsome man, and he took tea with
  the ladies, and entertained them with most voluble and interesting
  conversation.</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice was charmed, and noticed with great satisfaction that he
  seemed almost to ignore her companion, and talked exclusively to herself. He
  accepted an invitation to stay and dine with them readily, and made himself
  especially agreeable. There was absolutely not one household in his parish,
  he assured Lady Beatrice, to visit whom was a pleasure, and he seemed as
  delighted as a schoolboy at the prospect of his evening's entertainment.</p>

  <p>The entertainment was reciprocal, for he talked amusingly and with
  intelligence on every subject that was started. Lady Beatrice was in raptures
  with her guest, and Miss Dorse silently appreciative. When he joined them on
  the balcony after dinner (they permitted him to smoke a cigar there), the
  conversation grew more personal, and Lady Beatrice wondered that he was
  relegated to such an out-of-the-way hole as Pennedis.</p>

  <p>"I can assure you," she murmured, in her most silvery accents, "that we
  expected to find some grey-haired septuagenarian or raw stripling here, who
  would bore us beyond measure by his visits, and want us to start clothing
  clubs, and attend mothers' meetings, or something of that sort." And she
  shuddered prettily. "You can't tell how relieved we are, aren't we, Laura?
  But you must feel buried alive here, Mr. Westaby."</p>

  <p>Mr. Westaby sighed and looked moody.</p>

  <p>Yes, he had found existence in Pennedis insufferably dull, and, he was
  obliged to confess, his duties were tedious.</p>

  <p>But it was his misfortune to be quite without friends, and to be able to
  command no influence whatever; so he had had to go to the wall, while more
  fortunate and, he hinted, less efficient men had been pushed forward. The
  Church was, like all other professions, he explained, woefully overcrowded,
  and unless a man had influence, or family, or something to help him on, he
  might stagnate in such a place as this during the best years of his life. But
  perhaps he should find it a little less dull now. Was Lady Price
  contemplating a very long stay?</p>

  <p>Yes, her ladyship had made up her mind to stay here for a couple of months
  at least, she assured him graciously. The ordinary watering-places were
  crowded and the Continent overrun; besides which, she found the absolute
  quiet of Pennedis so grateful after the noise and bustle of London. The Rev.
  Westaby would be welcome whenever he chose to call. She hoped that they
  should see much of him.</p>

  <p>He bowed his thanks, and, perhaps unconsciously, his eyes rested for a
  moment on Miss Dorse's piquant face. She blushed the very slightest blush in
  the world, and dropped her eyes. Her ladyship noticed it, and frowned.</p>

  <p>That night Lady Beatrice spent a considerable time before the
  looking-glass and in silent meditation in her easy chair. The upshot of her
  meditations was, that she decided to marry the Rev. George Westaby.</p>

  <p>In accordance with this resolution, he was encouraged to become a frequent
  visitor at Pennedis Grange, and, as was only natural, Lady Beatrice received
  him with her sweetest smiles and in her most becoming gowns. Really he was a
  very distinguished-looking man, and would be a husband to be proud of.</p>

  <p>She soon ascertained, by a little judicious pumping, that though he was
  not particularly well born, there was nothing ignoble in his parentage; and
  perhaps it was just as well that he had no relations likely to trouble him.
  Alone he would probably all his life remain a poor curate; as her husband it
  was her firm intention that he should end his days a bishop; for she had
  sense enough to see that his extempore sermons were above the average, and
  his delivery, a most important point in Lady Beatrice's estimation of a
  Churchman, was perfect.</p>

  <p>Several weeks passed, and Lady Beatrice was perfectly satisfied with the
  course of events. The Rev. George Westaby was almost a daily caller, and his
  manner was all that a woman could desire who was endeavouring to effect a
  conquest. Indeed, so easy appeared to be the task of bringing this village
  curate to her feet, that she would have been almost inclined to call it tame,
  had not his splendid physique and distinguished bearing generated within her
  some vague emotion, which, no doubt, in a woman of the world is the
  substitute for love.</p>

  <p>But there came a cloud, although only a passing one. One afternoon Lady
  Beatrice was standing on the balcony of Pennedis Grange, idly gazing through
  a telescope which was fixed there, when she spied two figures on the sands.
  One was the Rev. George Westaby, and the other her companion, Miss Dorse. She
  watched them pacing to and fro, evidently talking very earnestly, watched
  them approach towards the house, and separate with a feeling at her heart
  very like jealousy. If she had made up her mind to stoop to marry this
  country curate, at any rate, she would brook no rivals. On that score she was
  very decided.</p>

  <p>That night there were words between Lady Beatrice and her companion; in
  vulgar parlance there was a row. Lady Beatrice was sarcastic and spiteful,
  Miss Dorse was sullen and at last impertinent. The end was one which Lady
  Beatrice did not regret. The next morning's train bore Miss Dorse away to
  London, with six months' salary in her pocket, in lieu of notice.</p>

  <p>The Rev. George Westaby took the matter very quietly, and, to Lady
  Beatrice's great satisfaction, did not exhibit any feeling beyond a mild
  surprise at Miss Dorse's sudden departure. This Lady Beatrice felt to be
  wholly satisfactory, and began to think that perhaps she had been
  unnecessarily severe with her companion. Still, she was better out of the
  way, and Lady Beatrice determined that her next companion should be one of a
  very different sort. The bishop-in-future spent quite as much of his time as
  formerly at the Grange; but Lady Beatrice felt that matters required a
  fillip. No doubt he felt considerable diffidence about declaring himself to a
  lady so much above him in rank and position. It was very natural, and,
  indeed, creditable, that he should. He must be encouraged; and he was
  encouraged, not only by speaking glances, but also by insinuations and
  innuendoes, which were at last successful; and one evening the Rev. Westaby
  left Pennedis Grange the accepted suitor of Lady Beatrice Price.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it would be as well not inquire too closely into the exact manner
  in which this culmination was brought about. It might have been Leap Year;
  and there is a good deal of excuse for Lady Beatrice if, considering their
  relative positions, she did give him even a little more than encouragement.
  Suffice it to say that one proposed, and the other accepted.</p>

  <p>Their courtship was not a particularly ardent one, but Lady Beatrice found
  it perfectly satisfactory. One day she unfolded to him her plans for the*
  future, of which he quite approved.</p>

  <p>"It would be very much nicer," she remarked <i>en passant</i>, "if the
  living could be arranged for before our marriage, wouldn't it, George? You
  would feel more independent then."</p>

  <p>He agreed with her, as he did in everything, and the conversation
  dropped.</p>

  <p>Two or three days later, however, he resumed it. He had heard of a living
  for sale in a very nice part of Derbyshire, which he thought eminently
  suitable, and he detailed with some enthusiasm its many advantages. Lady
  Beatrice listened with interest; and during the evening it was decided that
  her lover should journey up to London immediately, and make a few more
  inquiries.</p>

  <p>He went up on the morrow, and very soon a letter came from him. Everything
  that he could hear of the living was more than satisfactory, and the price
  (£5,500) was moderate. He thought that Beatrice could not do better than
  arrange for it, and he would remain in town in case she cared for him to
  settle the matter; or, no doubt, it could be done by her lawyer.</p>

  <p>By the return of post he received a most affectionate letter from his
  fiancee, and a cheque for £5,600. He immediately acknowledged receipt of
  these by a post-card. He was going to run down to Derbyshire, he said, and
  would write on the morrow; and then the next day, and the remainder of the
  week passed, and Lady Beatrice heard nothing of her lover. She began to be
  alarmed, for this silence was incomprehensible. Something had happened to
  him, she feared&mdash;perhaps he had been taken ill&mdash;and at last, unable
  to bear the suspense any longer, she packed a portmanteau, and, accompanied
  by her maid, journeyed up to London. She drove first of all to her bankers,
  and ascertained that her cheque had been cashed three days ago by a
  gentleman, who had taken a large amount of gold. Then she drove to the hotel
  where he had stopped, and, trembling with an indefinable fear, made her
  inquiries. Yes, the Rev. G. Westaby had stopped there, but he had left three
  days ago. If she was Lady Price, there was a letter for her.</p>

  <p>Perplexed, she took it into a sitting-room, and tore it open. Directly she
  had read it she swooned.</p>

  <p class="letter">Langham Hotel,<br>
  August 20th.</p>

  <p class="letter">My dear Lady Beatrice,&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">After a good deal of meditation I have come to the
  regrettable but unalterable decision that I cannot accept the flattering
  proposition which you were so kind as to make to me a short time since. I
  fear that I should not be able to make you happy, nor should I myself be
  satisfied and contented in the career which you purposed for me. The fact is,
  I have always had a great and increasing dislike for the profession which I
  was compelled by circumstances, which I will not here dilate upon, to adopt.
  Therefore I have come to the conclusion to absent myself for a while, and to
  seek in another country, and in another vocation, that happiness which I am
  confident that I should fail to attain here.</p>

  <p class="letter">With my prayers for your forgiveness,</p>

  <p class="letter">I remain, yours regretfully,<br>
  George Westaby.</p>

  <p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;I have taken the liberty of retaining the
  proceeds of the cheque which you were so kind as to send me, and if at any
  time I shall be able to repay it (a contingency which I do not, however,
  contemplate as very possible), I shall find pleasure in doing so.</p>

  <p>The worst of the whole matter was, that the only point on which the
  manager of the hotel could give Lady Price any information was, that the
  gentleman in question had left the hotel in company with a young lady, who,
  from her description, could be none other than her ladyship's late
  companion.</p>

  <p>Lady Beatrice is still a spinster.</p>

  <h4>ILLUSTRATED BY G. &amp; M. MONTBARD</h4>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Mar 1902</h3>

  <p class="first">A MAN, stripped to the shirt, bruised and disfigured in many
  places with blood and dirt, lay prostrate upon a sandy hillock, his bloodshot
  eyes turned steadily westwards. He was in dire straits&mdash;starving, half
  mad with thirst, and exhausted with fruitless fighting. For every barrel of
  his empty, still smoking revolver, a dead or dying man lay upon the little
  plateau around him. He had fought as a man fights who sees his own life
  forfeited by reason of overmastering odds, yet girds himself to meet death as
  becomes one of a great race and a great country. The number of his assailants
  had been such as had made fighting a pantomime, and his desperate resistance
  a farce, as far as any chance of escape was concerned. A hundred savage
  soldiery, whose language was a mystery to him, and whose arms and whole
  appearance a revelation, had come upon him in his sleep a short hour ago.
  Away over the stony steppes and across the mountains his false guides were
  flying in mortal terror of their lives.</p>

  <p>For this was an unknown country of horrors, at whose portals whole
  generations of explorers had perished, whose great city was still the home of
  mystery, the despair and the desire of travellers of all nations. Alone on
  the face of the earth the people had resisted the march of civilization, had
  held firm and unshaken the great barriers which Nature and their own savagery
  had reared about the sacred capital. Yonder it lay in the cold grey light
  across the plain, its great walls, monuments of marvellous masonry,
  encompassing it like an iron band, behind a heterogeneous multitude of
  minarets and strange square columns, flat-roofed houses, and curious watch
  towers. Even in those moments of his agony the man forgot his sufferings and
  his approaching doom in the mingled exultation and despair of the explorer.
  He, first of all Englishmen, first indeed of all Europeans, was looking,
  though from afar off and in grievous plight, upon the sacred city of Thibet.
  Even though he paid for his daring with his life, as seemed indeed certain,
  this was at least some measure of consolation. Yet it was consolation fraught
  with dismay and anger. To die so near the goal was maddening. A fit of
  ineffective rage seized him. Who were these wretched, half-starved savages to
  stand between him and the desire of his life? He measured them against
  himself, and the thought of their brute power over him made him almost
  hysterical in those first hours of his pain. He was a man of note in his
  country, rich, noble, young. If only he could make them understand. He cursed
  the grim barrier of non-comprehension which his little knowledge of Asiatic
  and their hideous dialect had reared between them. All his signs they had
  treated with contempt. He had pointed towards the city and had shown them
  papers&mdash;papers to which many seals had been affixed, and which proved
  him to be an Englishman of note, entitled to the respect and consideration of
  all foreign powers. He had pointed backwards across the hills whence he had
  come, a long and wearisome journey, which from days had grown into weeks, and
  from weeks to months.</p>

  <p>Nothing had availed him. He had no presents with which to bribe them. Such
  few pieces of gold which he had possessed had been snatched from him by the
  first comers, their yellow Mongolian faces and narrow eyes on fire with
  cupidity. They had stripped him of his few possessions, with a ruthlessness
  peculiar to their race, and afterwards they had set upon him to destroy him.
  He had a horrible fear that even now they were hesitating to kill him only
  because, furious at his stout resistance, they were planning a more terrible
  thing. He had heard many stories of the tortures which these people inflicted
  upon chance travellers, drawn towards their city as a moth to the candle by
  its solemn and impenetrable mystery. He recalled them now with sickening
  distinctness. What they had done to others they would surely do to him. And
  presently it appeared that he was right.</p>

  <p>A dozen of them came, dragging a pine trunk stripped of its branches up
  the side of a wooded ravine a hundred yards away. Others began to drill a
  hole in the rising ground close to where he lay. Backwards and forwards they
  passed, casting every now and then upon him glances of fierce and sickly
  hatred, shouting menaces at him in a heathen gibberish, throwing every now
  and then a stone at his uncovered head. The man realized then, more fully
  perhaps than ever before, the hideous, unconquerable hate of this people for
  all aliens, under which heading he, the European, most surely came. It was
  written in their sallow faces, it flashed in their black, narrow slit eyes,
  their gestures, and the vindictive torrent of abuse which flowed from their
  lips, proclaimed it.</p>

  <p>Their dead comrades they kicked aside with indifference. It was no desire
  to avenge them which had kindled their rage, which had made death too slight
  a punishment to be meted out to him, which had put torture into their
  minds&mdash;for it was going to be torture. The man saw it in their faces,
  read it in every grin and leer which chilled his blood. He groaned aloud. It
  was an evil end for him, Geoffrey Felbrigge, Earl of Lechfort, Lord
  Lieutenant of his county and Master of Hounds.</p>

  <p>An hour afterwards they left him. He was trussed and tied to the post
  which they had improvised, his hands and legs aching with the cords which cut
  into his flesh, his face turned with relentless irony to the city of his
  desires. They had trooped away, whither exactly he could not tell, with
  strange mocking cries, and with flourishing gestures which seemed like an
  invocation to the elements to rain their tortures upon him. He was alone,
  with no one save his thoughts to bear him company&mdash;a strange, lone
  figure in the rocky solitude.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>A fierce sun beat upon him all day. For ten hours he had neither eaten nor
  drunk, and the roof of his mouth was like blistered leather. His eyes were
  bloodshot and his tongue swollen. He had tugged at his cords until his arms
  were bruised, and the blood had forced its way through his tightened skin.
  Then a partial but merciless unconsciousness came to him. The sandy desert
  faded away before his eyes, the sun gleaming minarets of the city mocked him
  no longer, the fierce heat ceased to torture his numbed flesh. He was back in
  London, back in the long drawing room, with its delicate perfumes and gently
  softened shade, face to face with the woman whose invincible pride and his
  own stubbornness had driven him forth a reckless wanderer, had kindled in him
  the old, wild spirit&mdash;the passion for new countries, which, before he
  had met her, had been the joy of his life. Tall and fair and slim, in her
  white evening gown, he could see her standing before him with eyes which bade
  him stay, which said things to him which her tongue had been too proud to
  utter. He could see the jewel which flashed upon her heaving bosom, the tears
  which welled slowly into her eyes. It was his fault, his fault. The thought
  of her&mdash;his wife&mdash;the woman, and the only woman he had ever loved,
  soothed him for one moment only to madden him the next. She would be waiting
  for him, and he would never return. He would never be able to take her hands,
  to look into her eyes, to smooth her hair and kiss away those tears, as he
  had longed to many a time since he had left London in a sudden fit of blind,
  unreasoning fury. She had been right. He had been brutal and unreasonable.
  After all, the difference between them had been so pitifully trivial. He was
  a brave man, and he had looked death in the face before, death as hideous as
  this if quicker. Yet he broke down now. It was the thought of Helen, not to
  see her&mdash;to let her know . . . .</p>

  <p>Then sun went down, and the cooler air was rent with the sound of a man's
  sobs.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In another hemisphere, London was doing its best to amuse
  itself. Westwards the pavements were thronged with saunterers, the streets
  were blocked with hansoms, the night was warm, and the women's dresses were
  like the wings of summer butterflies. The playhouses were flaring with light,
  everywhere there was colour and movement and languorous content. Further
  westwards, from the great dwelling houses and the mansions of the squares,
  drugget crossed the pavement, there was the murmur of floating music and soft
  voices from the holland-shrouded balconies above. The whole city seemed
  steeped with pleasure this soft spring evening. Every one was entertaining or
  being entertained.</p>

  <p><a id="pic15"

        style="margin-right:20%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>On the balcony of one of the great mansions in Cadogan Square a woman was
  standing alone. She had escaped for a moment unseen from the brilliantly lit
  ballroom behind; her face was turned eastwards, and her eyes were soft with
  unshed tears. It was a moment rendered necessary by a sudden rush of memories
  which had brought a lump into her throat and a strange sadness into her
  heart. The last time she had been a guest in this house he had been her
  companion. She remembered distinctly how he had arranged her cloak in the
  carriage, had thrown away his freshly-lit cigarette because she had coughed,
  had been, as it chanced, upon that evening more than ordinarily attentive to
  her in such little ways as woman sets store by. She remembered too, how he
  had seemed to her that night, in comparison with the other men who had
  thronged the rooms, more than ordinarily handsome; he had danced with her
  three times, and out here on the balcony he had leant over her with a little
  laugh, and had kissed her&mdash;his own wife. Oh, how mad, how foolish she
  had been to let him go, when a single word from her would have stopped him.
  Never a day had passed but she had repented the stupid, stubborn pride which
  had kept sealed her lips. Where was he now? Lost to her, perhaps, for ever.
  She gazed wistfully and tearfully eastwards. Many thousand miles away, a man
  was being tortured, and he too was thinking of that night.</p>

  <p>"At last I have found you then, Helen. Do you know that I have been
  looking for you everywhere?"</p>

  <p>She turned round slowly and unwillingly. A tall, soldierly man was
  standing by her side, a man who looked at her as a man looks only at the
  woman he loves. She saw and shrank from it, as she had done many a time
  before. She wanted no man's love save his who was gone.</p>

  <p>"I came out for a breath of fresh air, Morton," she answered. "The rooms
  here are always too hot. I think that they must be badly ventilated. I was
  just going in. Will you give me your arm?"</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he said, "would you do me a favour, Helen. I want to talk to
  you for five minutes before you meet with any of your friends inside, May
  I?"</p>

  <p>She moved her head gravely, but her manner explained a certain
  unwillingness.</p>

  <p>"If it is necessary," she answered, "I am quite ready to listen to
  you."</p>

  <p>He drew a short breath and hesitated. So much depended upon the next few
  minutes. There were grey hairs in his head, he was approaching middle age,
  and all his life he had loved but one woman. For a time she had been lost to
  him. This was his chance of winning her again. It was for life or death. No
  wonder that he hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Helen," he said at last, "there is some news which I wish you to hear
  first from me. The evidence of poor Geoffrey's death has been accepted
  unanimously and without question by the court. I believe that since mid-day I
  have had the right to call myself the Earl of Lechfort."</p>

  <p>Once more she turned eastwards. Her cheeks were very pale, but her eyes
  were dry. She spoke distinctly enough, though her tone was hard and
  emotionless.</p>

  <p>"I thought," she said, "that it would take a week for them to give a
  decision."</p>

  <p>"The evidence," he answered, gently, "was too conclusive to leave room for
  a shadow of doubt. No one regrets poor Geoffrey's death more than I do,
  Helen; but as to doubting it&mdash;it is impossible."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Morton," she said, "I do not complain. You must let me know
  about your other arrangements, and I will move into the Dower House, at
  Huncote, whenever you please. That, however, must not imply that I consider
  myself a widow."</p>

  <p>He interrupted her&mdash;a frown upon his forehead, a note of passion in
  his tone.</p>

  <p>"Give me credit at least, Helen," he cried, "for being ordinarily decent.
  You shall choose either Lechfort or Massingham, and it will be yours for
  life. Besides, I could not afford to live in them myself. I am forced to take
  the title and the estates; but, as you know, the income from them is not
  large, and all Geoffrey's money was, of course, left to you."</p>

  <p>"I will agree to anything," she said listlessly, "which you and my
  solicitors advise."</p>

  <p>He drew a little nearer to her, and the danger light flashed once more in
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Helen," he said, "I want you to agree to something else, which has
  nothing to do with Mr. Cunliffe, which has nothing to do with anybody except
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>The attempt at discouragement was obvious. He chose to ignore it.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey has been dead now for three years"</p>

  <p>She stopped him.</p>

  <p>"He has disappeared for three years," she corrected. "Do you mind leaving
  it like that?"</p>

  <p>"He is dead. The proofs are absolute. We have his clothes and his
  belongings, the testimony of his guides, the word of those who saw him dead.
  God knows that I am not one who ever hankered after dead men's shoes. I would
  bring him to life if I could, but it is impossible. Helen, you must learn to
  realize this."</p>

  <p>She looked him steadily in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"The proofs," she said slowly, "may seem convincing. I do not blame the
  courts for admitting them, or you for taking the title; yet, for myself, I am
  a woman, and I must have something to live for. I am going on hoping. What
  else can I do?"</p>

  <p>"You can make others happy," he cried, his voice thick with emotion.
  "Happiness for yourself lies&mdash; that way. It is useless to nurse a dead
  sorrow. Geoffrey is dead, poor chap, and believe me, Helen, I am sorry. But
  there is the future."</p>

  <p>"I shall live on&mdash;and hope," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Helen, when you say that," he answered, "you rob me of the one great hope
  of my life. You know very well what I mean. You know that I love you. No,
  don't shrink from me. I am not a poisonous thing. There is nothing criminal
  in loving you. If there is, I have been a criminal all my life, for I have
  never cared for any other woman. I don't ask for anything now; no, not even
  for hope. It is too soon. You have not realized as yet that Geoffrey has
  gone. I am going to wait very quietly and very patiently. I ask for nothing,
  but I want you to know."</p>

  <p>She drew her skirts coldly away from contact with him.</p>

  <p>"Morton," she said, "perhaps it is as well that you have spoken. I can
  tell you my mind now plainly. If you wish to remain my friend, you will never
  breathe a word of this again. To you Geoffrey may seem dead; to me he is
  alive. I am a woman, you know, and I am hard to convince. Facts count for
  little with me against consciousness. I feel that Geoffrey is alive; I refuse
  to believe him dead. He may never come back to me, but I shall wait for him
  &mdash;and hope."</p>

  <p>"What hope can you have?" he protested bitterly. "You read the letter from
  Colonel Denny?"</p>

  <p>"Other Englishmen were travelling that way."</p>

  <p>"His clothes? They were his. His tailor has proved it."</p>

  <p>"He may have lent them, or they may have been stolen."</p>

  <p>"His silence?"</p>

  <p>"He is in a country as silent as the grave."</p>

  <p>"It is ridiculous," he cried passionately. "You will not listen to reason.
  It is madness. You are offering up the best years of your life a fruitless
  sacrifice&mdash;to what? God knows. You mean that you will never listen to
  me, that you will cling to this miserable folly throughout your life and
  mine. You will wreck them both for a whim&mdash;a superstition."</p>

  <p>"I am Geoffrey's wife," she said. "So I shall always feel myself
  until"</p>

  <p>"Until what?"</p>

  <p>"Until I know that he is dead."</p>

  <p>"Until you know that he is dead," the man repeated slowly. "That is
  certain enough already. Yet tell me this&mdash;what further proof will
  satisfy you?"</p>

  <p>"The sight of his body, or speech with one who has actually seen it," she
  answered slowly. "Nothing else."</p>

  <p>The man ground his heel upon the stone floor, and his face was set and
  white.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Helen," he said. "I am an idle man. I will humour your fancy. You
  will not listen to me unless you have speech with some one who has seen
  Geoffrey's body, or can bring you certain word of his death. Very well. Where
  he went I will go. I will follow in his footsteps until I come to the end. He
  is dead. I know it. Never mind, I will bring you the proof. And then?"</p>

  <p>"You mean it!" she cried. "You will go?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will go. And then?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head sadly.</p>

  <p>"I cannot make any bargain," she said. "If is too hideous. Besides, you
  know my belief. You will find Geoffrey alive. I am sure of it. You will bring
  him home to me. If you do that&mdash;oh, if you do that!"</p>

  <p>The light upon her face was a brilliant revelation of her surpassing
  beauty. But the man who saw it was white to the lips. To him it was torture.
  If only she would ever care for him like that.</p>

  <p>"I will take my chance," he said slowly; "but remember that before I start
  I warn you. I shall come back alone. That I am sure of before I start. Try
  and make up your mind to it, or you will only be courting a bitter
  disappointment."</p>

  <p>She answered him with apparent irrelevance,</p>

  <p>"When shall you start?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">There was a time when the man had clung to life, but that
  time had gone by. It was for death now that he prayed, for forgetfulness, for
  oblivion. Of time he had lost all count. There was no change in the days. The
  same pitiless sun burned and scorched his flesh from mid-day to sundown.
  Every evening he breathed the same little gasp of relief as the fiery red
  ball sank behind the low line of wild storm beaten rocks. Yet the nights
  brought no relief. As the darkness fell came the keen icy winds, the
  deathlike silence, the unutterable sense of desolation, which made him glad
  even to crane his neck and watch the dark forms of the savage warriors who
  guarded him gathered round a fire of logs outside their hut. At first he had
  treated the privations which he was made to endure, the leering gibes and
  hideous mockery of his yellow-skinned guards, with the full contempt of a
  strong, brave man. He had nerved himself to face death, and he had closed the
  door upon all that host of torturing thoughts which had made such an end so
  bitter. But the time had been too long. More than once already he had broken
  down, had felt a sudden burning at his eyeballs, and the rush of warm,
  unmanly tears. Beyond there seemed to be still more terrible things. Already
  he had experienced a hideous unloosing of all fixed thought, he had burst
  into violent and incoherent speech, which had sounded strangely even to his
  own ears. He had felt himself dimly to be on the threshold of that fearful
  world where the body lives and the mind is held by demons. Then he had looked
  about him with feverish and sick desire for a weapon with which to escape.
  Anything sooner than the horrible chains of madness&mdash;death a thousand
  times rather, if by any means he could compass his own self-destruction. But
  there was no weapon. The ill-clad, pitiless savages who guarded him took
  zealous care that the white-faced interloper, who had dared to journey to
  within sight of their holy city, should not escape them. By degrees he had
  learned a little of their language. One night he gathered easily from their
  signs and disjointed words that they were discussing his death. They were
  weary of their solitude, of their lonely guard upon the mountains. Better
  finish him off or swear that they had cut him down whilst endeavouring to
  escape. They die so slowly, these white-faced devils, and the time hung heavy
  upon their hands up here in the lonely pass. But there was always a majority
  who shook their heads solemnly and were firm. To end his tortures would mean
  death to every one of them. Their orders were to keep him alive. Their own
  heads would grin from the walls which bounded the slaughter-house of the city
  if they disobeyed. So those who were weary went out and kicked him savagely
  to relieve their feelings, and returned to the shelter of the hut.</p>

  <p>Then there came a night when he awoke with a sharp cry and a rush of blood
  to his poor, numbed heart, from one of those long, agonizing dozes, which was
  as near as ever he could come to sleep.</p>

  <p>The cry was stifled by a hot hand thrust upon his mouth, and a gentle
  exclamation of warning. A man had crept out from the shadow of the rocks, and
  was standing beside him. A man whose face was familiar, whose expression was
  one of horrified pity. He told himself that this must be a nightmare&mdash;he
  had had them before, and he dug at his eyeballs, and then opening them wider,
  stared and stared again. But the man's face did not fade away as those others
  had done. On the contrary he was drawing nearer, his trembling lips were
  parted, and a hoarse whisper came from them:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey. Why, Geoffrey, this is horrible. What, in God's name, have they
  been doing to you?"</p>

  <p>Then the sleeping mind of the man awoke, and his heart beat thick and
  strong. He had buried all hope long ago. This was like new life.</p>

  <p>"Morton," he whispered faintly. "Speak to me again softly. Let me feel
  you. I want to be sure that you are flesh and blood. I have had so many
  fancies in the night time. Let me be sure that this is not another cursed
  dream."</p>

  <p>The man drew nearer to him, and the glazed eyes of the captive lit up as
  though with fire. Whatever those others might have been this was a real and
  palpable presence.</p>

  <p>"You know me, Geoffrey, old chap. I came out here to look for you. They
  said that these devils had done you to death. Thank God that I have found
  you. Have courage, Geoff."</p>

  <p>"Thank God, indeed!" the man sobbed. "Be still for a moment, Morton; let
  me think."</p>

  <p>There was a short, tense silence. His heart was thumping against his ribs,
  and his head swam. Yet with this sudden birth of hope something of his old
  coolness was back again. He was able to think, and to think clearly. Afar off
  there was a break in the night, the dawn was already brightening in the east.
  Soon they would be bringing his handful of dried peas and water. He looked
  anxiously towards the hut where all was still.</p>

  <p>"You are not alone, Morton?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"How many of you are there?"</p>

  <p>"Only myself and one guide, an Afghan," the newcomer answered. "The others
  have all deserted. I started with twenty, and twenty carriers, but they have
  melted away. We have had to fight twice."</p>

  <p>"There are twelve men guarding me," the prisoner whispered, motioning
  towards the hut. "Soon they will wake and bring me food. If you set me free
  now, we should not be able to get far enough away. Go and hide till night
  comes again. When it is dark enough I will call out as though with pain. They
  will take no notice. I have shrieked through a whole night, and they have not
  turned their heads. Come softly up to me then, and have a knife ready to cut
  these accursed ropes. How did you come&mdash; on foot?"</p>

  <p>"I have horses; two spare ones&mdash;little mountain ponies. They climb
  the mountains like cats. Once away they will never catch us. Bear up, old
  chap, till to-night."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">All through the long day the man, who seemed indeed to be
  enduring a perpetual crucifixion, appeared to be growing weaker and weaker.
  The soldiers who guarded him wagged their heads, came out to stare, and
  jabbered amongst themselves. He was nearing his end; that was certain. No one
  but a strong man could have held out so long. It was nearly all over now.
  They decided to send one of their number to the city with the news. Their
  instructions had been to keep him alive as long as possible. He was to remain
  there, alive or dead, an awful message from this people to the hated
  strangers who should seek to force their way on towards the sacred city. But
  when their backs were turned there was a change in the man. A new light was
  in his eyes, the fire of a new hope was burning once more in his veins. Yet
  that day was the longest he had ever known. Surely the sun had never moved so
  slowly, the darkness had never been so long delayed. Yet slowly though that
  fiery red ball sank into the west, his setting was none the less sure.</p>

  <p>At last his rim touched the broken line of rocky hills, beyond which was
  home and freedom. Then, all quivering with impatience, the man waited whilst
  grey deepened into black, and the voices of his guards, seated together in
  the distance, grew drowsier and fainter. And the day too had been long, the
  longest of his life, to the man who lay behind a rock waiting only a few
  hundred yards away. Months ago, when first he had heard some vague rumours of
  an Englishman held in captivity and torture by this cruel and savage people,
  he had had only one thought &mdash;to push on at all hazards and at all
  risks. He had only half believed their story; even if there were truth in it,
  he had not expected to find in their captive the man to find some trace of
  whom was the avowed object of his expedition. During that long, horrible day
  he began to realize what the finding of Geoffrey must mean to him. It was the
  death-blow to his hopes. With this man's return to life must end the one
  great desire of his heart. It was like slow madness creeping into his brain.
  He had never doubted but that he would go home after many dangers and many
  privations to take her hand in his, to tell her that he had done all that a
  man could do, that failure was written in the book of death beforehand, and
  then, some day, to plead for his reward. He would not have hurried her; she
  was not a woman to be easily won, but in the end his persistence and his
  devotion must have triumphed. This was how he had thought of the future; his
  worst imaginings had never included such a possibility as this. He was to
  return shamefaced and corrected, to confess that she was right, to take her
  husband home to her, and leave them to their happiness. What was there left
  for him? Without Helen life in any form was barely endurable. The desire for
  her had been the one great desire of his life. He looked back over the bare,
  wild country across which he had come, across the iron-girt hills on which
  never a tree or a shrub could blossom, and up the great gorge where every
  footstep had been taken in peril, and every loose stone dislodged by their
  cautious progress had fallen a thousand feet. And as the day wore on, the
  man's passion grew, and voices whispered in his ear. Helen was so beautiful;
  she would so soon learn to love him. If he crept away now down into the
  little valley where the ponies were tethered and his worn-out guide was
  sleeping, in an hour he would be far away. The way back was easy. There would
  be no one to whisper of his treachery, rather he would be praised for his
  gallant journey into the heart of a dangerous country. What was Geoffrey to
  him? There had been no pretence of friendship between them; they were kin,
  and that was all.</p>

  <p>And Helen. He closed his eyes and stood once more by her side upon the
  balcony. The perfume of her hair, the soft, silent music of her
  eyes&mdash;with a swift rush of memories these things became suddenly real to
  him in the deep silence of a brooding and unpeopled land.</p>

  <p>When the sun set he was ten miles away, riding with white, hard face and
  loose hands, breathing sharply, and with a glare in his eyes which was like
  the glare of a madman. For he was pursued by ghosts, they were on every side
  of him, in front, their voices whispered to him through the gathering
  darkness. Was it he, Morton Felbrigge, soldier and gentleman, a man of honour
  and of good conscience, who was riding into the night with ashen cheeks?
  Never daring to look behind, trembling at every shadow and starting at every
  breath of wind which moaned through the few lone trees. He thought of his
  last campaign, of that terrible battle from whence he had come drenched with
  blood, with the body of his comrade upon his shoulders and the thunderous
  applause of his wildly excited regiment in his ears. He thought of the small
  iron cross which the Queen had pinned to his breast, and which, it had seemed
  to him, must for ever keep the man against whose heart it beat from even the
  passing thought of meanness or dishonour. He thought of the woman who trusted
  him, with whom his life, if indeed he ever dared to claim her, must be one
  long living lie. Of the grim secret which, as the years went on, would work
  in his veins like poison, until the hour of inevitable confession came, and
  the eyes, which had learned to look upon him kindly, blazed out the scorn of
  a wronged and deceived woman. He thought of these things until his head was
  full of horror, and he hated himself and what he was doing with a deadly,
  sickening hatred. Yet he rode on still into the night.</p>

  <p>And behind, across the steppes and up the gorge, a man was waiting for him
  with breathless and passionate eagerness. The sun had set and the darkness
  had come. With pain and difficulty he moved his head a little and looked
  around. Where was Morton, his deliverer? Why did he not come? Every moment
  now was a golden moment wasted.</p>

  <p>The night was dark, his guards were asleep. Many times his cry, strained
  at first, but pitifully now in earnest, had wailed out upon the thick
  darkness. Sometimes his guards had cursed, sometimes an animal from the
  distant belt of woods had yelped back an answer, but Morton never came, and
  of all the nights of torture which the man had passed that was the cruelest.
  When morning came he was very near to death, when the mid-day sun beat upon
  his head he was raving. When night came again, he was in a torpor, and death
  hovered around. He was still unconscious when a knife cut his bonds and the
  arm of a strong man lifted him, a poor helpless wreck, from the ground. The
  motion of a pony revived him for a moment, at the sound of a shot he opened
  his eyes. He was in a strange place, and, as he staggered back to
  consciousness, he saw such a sight as few have looked upon. He saw Morton,
  with blood streaming from his face, and eyes flashing like a man possessed of
  devils. With a two edged sword, which gleamed in his hand like whirling
  silver, he had cut down three of his assailants. In his left hand his
  revolver was flashing out the fires of death. The desire of life seized hold
  of the half-conscious man. He slipped from his pony, and snatching a sword
  from the dead hand of a prostrate man, joined in the fray. It was a battle
  against hideous odds, but when it was over Geoffrey was unhurt, and his
  deliverer, with the stump of an arm hanging useless by his side and the lust
  of blood in his red eyes, was looking about for more men to kill&mdash;and
  there were none.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was years before Geoffrey knew the whole truth, but he
  and Helen heard it together one Christmas morning, when a great guest
  honoured them by coming straight to Elton Towers on his return from a
  campaign which had made his name a household one, and himself the idol of an
  enthusiastic country. Outside, the way across the park to church was lined
  with people who were waiting to see him pass out, who had come from far and
  near on the chance of seeing him. He took them both into the great library
  and bade them listen to him.</p>

  <p>With slow bitter words and bent head he told them the story of that night
  and day. He told them of his flight and of the agony of his repentance, how
  he had ridden back through the soft, grey dawn-light and the burning heat as
  though the fires of hell were at his back. But they never let him finish.
  Geoffrey had seized his hands, and with a deep sob had begged him to stop.
  But the woman bent over and closed his white lips with hers. When they passed
  out across the park and between the lines of people who had been waiting with
  uncovered heads in deep respectful silence for a glimpse of him, he bowed to
  them with a smile which for many years no man had seen. Those who knew him
  from his photographs wondered. Later, in the clubs, men congratulated him
  upon his altered looks and obvious happiness. He laughed at them always and
  passed on. He alone knew how slight the joy which his fame and success had
  brought, how immeasurably sweet the dropping of that grim burden of
  self-hatred, which at the touch of her lips and the clasp of Geoffrey's hands
  had fallen away from him for ever. The tragedy of that night has still a dark
  corner in his mind&mdash;but the key has been turned upon it and the fires
  are extinct.</p>

  <p class="first">SOMEWHAT SHORT, precise-looking young man stood on the steps
  of a mansion in Hyde Park Gardens, deliberately scraping his boots; for the
  weather was showery, and he had walked from the Foreign Office. Having
  concluded that operation, he turned to the opened door, and instantly
  perceived, from the disturbed expression of the usually most impassive of
  doorkeepers, that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>"Is anything the matter, Burditt?" he asked condescendingly, as he stepped
  into the hall. "Mrs. Tregarron and Miss Alice are quite well, I hope?"</p>

  <p>The man first carefully secured the door, then turned round and bowed.</p>

  <p>"The ladies are quite well, my lord," he said gravely; "but we are all a
  good deal upset this afternoon. Mrs. Tregarron will see you at once in the
  morning&mdash; room, if your Lordship will be so good as to come this way,"
  and he ushered the visitor down the hall into a small room on the left-hand
  side.</p>

  <p>Curiosity was not one of Lord Maclenie's failings, neither was impatience;
  so he did not question the man further, merely desiring him to at once inform
  Mrs. Tregarron of his arrival.</p>

  <p>In less than a minute his prospective mother-in-law&mdash;a tall,
  aristocratic-looking woman, wearing a widow's cap and looking about fifty
  years old&mdash;swept into the room.</p>

  <p>"My dear Robert," she exclaimed, holding out her hand, "how good of you to
  come so soon! Of course you have had my note?"</p>

  <p>His Lordship shook his head. "I have had no note from you today," he
  answered. "Alice is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I wrote you to Cadogan Place nearly two hours ago," interrupted Mrs.
  Tregarron.</p>

  <p>"Which note I have not yet had the pleasure of receiving," he returned.
  "We are busy at the Foreign Office, and I have not been home to lunch. Alice
  is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then you don't know anything about it?" broke in Mrs. Tregarron. "Dear
  me! I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you were to tell me&mdash;" he ventured to suggest.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tregarron became all impressiveness.</p>

  <p>"You remember that diamond necklace you gave Alice yesterday morning?"</p>

  <p>Of course he remembered it. Had he not spent nearly the whole of the
  previous afternoon at Filmoy and Morton's, undecided whether a less
  magnificent present would not be deemed a more suitable offering to a
  portionless fiancee? and had he not, after finally deciding upon its
  acquisition, then and there written out a cheque for fifteen hundred guineas,
  and left the shop with the little morocco case in his breast-pocket?
  Certainly he remembered that diamond necklace.</p>

  <p>"Well, what about it?" he inquired almost impatiently. He was proud of his
  self-control, this rising young diplomatist, but Mrs. Tregarron's manner was
  irritating.</p>

  <p><a id="pic16"

        style="margin-right:20%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>"It has been stolen," she said impressively, and then leaned back in her
  chair, waiting anxiously to see what effect her communication would have upon
  him.</p>

  <p>It was instantaneous. Lord Maclenie was self-controlled, but parsimonious;
  and fifteen hundred guineas is a good deal of money.</p>

  <p>"Stolen!" he exclaimed, starting from his seat. "Stolen!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, stolen," repeated Mrs. Tregarron, gently pressing a little lace
  handkerchief to her eyes, and watching all the time with deep anxiety his
  disturbed expression. "Sit still, and I will tell you all about it. You have
  no idea how upset we have all been."</p>

  <p>"Upset! I should think so!" exclaimed his Lordship vigorously. "Have you
  any idea what that necklace was worth, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tregarron knew quite well her future son-in-law had taken care that
  she should not remain in ignorance, but she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me, please," she pleaded. "I really cannot bear it just now.
  Let me tell you how it happened."</p>

  <p>"Just what I want to get at," he exclaimed impatiently. "Do you suspect
  anyone?"</p>

  <p>"At present, no one; but I think, when you hear the circumstances, you
  will agree with me that the theft must have been carried out by someone
  resident in the house; and, if so, they can have had no opportunity of
  disposing of it, for I have allowed no one to go out on any pretext whatever.
  I look upon it as somewhat a suspicious circumstance that Ann (Alice's maid)
  has twice asked for leave to absent herself this afternoon. Of course I
  refused it."</p>

  <p>"Of course. But please tell me exactly how it happened," entreated Lord
  Maclenie.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tregarron cleared her throat and proceeded in her recital of the
  affair. Told in her own way and in her own words it took some time; but,
  briefly, the facts&mdash;very simple facts they were&mdash;appeared to be as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Directly after breakfast that morning, Alice (Mrs. Tregarron's only
  daughter and Lord Maclenie's betrothed) had left the room, and, a few minutes
  later, had summoned her mother into the apartment in which they now were to
  look at the diamonds by daylight. After admiring them for some time, Mrs.
  Tregarron was called away for her morning's interview with the cook, and
  about half an hour later Alice had come to her and announced her intention of
  visiting old Lady Somerville, her godmother. She did not return for
  luncheon&mdash;she very seldom did when she went to visit Lady
  Somerville&mdash;but got back early in the afternoon. She met her mother in
  the hall, and explained that she had hurried away immediately after lunch as
  it had suddenly occurred to her during that meal that she had left her
  necklace on the mantelpiece of the morning-room. Mrs. Tregarron and her
  daughter then entered the morning-room together and found that the necklace
  had disappeared. They searched everywhere, high and low, and then questioned
  the servants, who one and all denied having even entered that particular room
  during the whole morning.</p>

  <p>"You can imagine what a state Alice and I were in then," concluded Mrs.
  Tregarron. "Poor girl! It made her quite ill, and she has gone to lie down
  for a while. Of course, I forbade any of the servants to leave the house, and
  sent round to you, and also a note to Scotland Yard. Did I do right?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see that anything else could have been done," replied Lord
  Maclenie thoughtfully. "It seems a strange affair altogether. Could the room
  be entered from outside, I wonder?" and he crossed the room and looked
  out.</p>

  <p>"Easily; but the window does not appear to have been tampered with, and
  you must remember it was in the middle of the day. Anyone getting through the
  window would certainly have been seen."</p>

  <p>Once more the interior of the room was carefully examined. Nothing was to
  be discovered. All was in order. Neither could the sagacious officer from
  Scotland Yard, who arrived a quarter of an hour later, find anything at all
  suspicious in the entrance to or general appearance of the room. The servants
  one by one were had in and examined, and the trunks of all of them, from the
  newly installed scullery-maid to the gray-haired butler, thoroughly
  ransacked, but nothing affording the faintest shadow of a clue was
  discovered.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to see my daughter herself?" inquired Mrs. Tregarron of
  the astute-looking detective, who stood sucking his pencil and looking
  thoroughly bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Quite unnecessary," he declared. "I should be sorry to have her
  disturbed. There is really nothing to ask her beyond what you have told me.
  It's not a pleasant thing to say, ma'am," he continued, "but the thief must
  be one of your servants. I should like the name and address of each of them,
  and also, if you can oblige me with it, particulars of their last place; and
  I must ask you to let me know at once if one of them leaves your service or
  give notice."</p>

  <p>"I suppose a reward had better be offered?" remarked Lord Maclenie.</p>

  <p>The officer assented.</p>

  <p>"Decidedly it would be better that there should be a reward."</p>

  <p>"Then you can make it £250."</p>

  <p>"Very good, your Lordship." And, after making a few more notes, the
  detective departed, with the usual promise that, should he discover a clue,
  etc.</p>

  <p>A fortnight elapsed and nothing was heard from him. At the end of that
  time Lord Madenie had a conversation at the club with an acquaintance
  concerning the mysterious robbery.</p>

  <p>"In the hands of Scotland Yard, is it?" remarked the latter. "Well, I
  don't want to revile any of our institutions, but I really do think that, so
  far as our established detective force is concerned, we are a long way behind
  the other countries of Europe. Scotland Yard very seldom discovers anything
  more than clues nowadays. Now, look here, Maclenie," he continued in a lower
  tone, "I could introduce you to a man&mdash;he's not regularly in the
  profession, but he'd do anything for me&mdash;who would find out all about
  this little affair for you, if anyone could. He's a regular sharp fellow, is
  Ashley; and only say the word, and I'll tell him to call and see you."</p>

  <p>Lord Maclenie shook his head doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe in amateur detectives much," he remarked disparagingly.
  "I'm afraid if Scotland Yard can't make anything of it, that it would be
  waste of time and money trying anyone else. Of course, if he likes to take it
  up on the chance of the reward&mdash;I've offered £250 reward, you
  know&mdash;well, then I don't mind helping him with any information. If he
  likes to come down to Hyde Park Gardens tonight, I shall be there."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell him," replied his friend. "Detective business of any sort
  is his hobby, and I dare say he'll come."</p>

  <p>The surmise was a correct one. About nine o'clock of the same evening a
  respectable-looking, middle-aged man, who gave his name as Mr. Ashley, called
  at Mrs. Tregarron's house in Hyde Park Gardens and asked for Lord Maclenie,
  who was spending the evening with his betrothed. His Lordship immediately
  explained the circumstances to Mrs. Tregarron, and begged leave to have the
  man shown in.</p>

        style="margin-left:20%; float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>"You really must excuse me, then," pleaded Miss Tregarron, rising from her
  chair with a languid gesture and a slight frown of annoyance. "I'm perfectly
  sick of the whole matter, and shall go to my room until the man's gone."</p>

  <p>"As you please," and Lord Maclenie rose and opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Ask Mr. Ashley to step this way," he said to the servant, who had
  remained in the room. And, accordingly, Mr. Ashley was shown in.</p>

  <p>The simple story of the theft was repeated to him in a few words. He
  listened attentively and grew thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"I should rather like to see Miss Tregarron," he remarked, after a long
  pause, "if not inconvenient."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tregarron looked rather doubtful.</p>

  <p>"Is it necessary?" she inquired, with her hand on the bell.</p>

  <p>Mr. Ashley bowed in a deprecating manner.</p>

  <p>"If she is engage, pray don't disturb her," he said suavely. "Any time
  will do; but I should like to see her."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tregarron rang the ball, and, through the servant, conveyed Mr.
  Ashley's request to her daughter. In a minute or two he returned. Miss
  Tregarron was suffering from headache and had retired. She was sorry that she
  could not see Mr. Ashley.</p>

  <p>The detective did not seem in the least disappointed; in fact, his eyes
  brightened as he received this message.</p>

  <p>"It is of no consequence," he declared. "No doubt I have all the
  information available. I should like just a word with the coachman, though.
  May I step down stairs and speak to him?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tregarron would have had him summoned, but the detective seemed bent
  on descending to the lower quarters, and, accordingly, he was ushered into
  the servants' hall, and the coachman brought to him; but when he arrived, Mr.
  Ashley seemed to have lost interest in him, and merely asked him carelessly a
  desultory question or two.</p>

  <p>"Miss Tregarron kept you a good time waiting at Lady Somerville's?" he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"We didn't wait for her, sir; we had orders to come back and fetch her
  again in an hour and a half's time, which we did."</p>

  <p>The detective seemed mildly surprised.</p>

  <p>"I should have thought," he said reflectively, "that it would have been
  scarcely worth while for you to have come back again. It must have taken you
  all your time."</p>

  <p>"It did that, sir, and no mistake," assented the coachman; "but young
  ladies never think of the 'osses. Anyways, them were her orders, and, of
  course, I was bound to obey them."</p>

  <p>"Just so; and then she kept you a good time waiting, I expect, when you
  got back?"</p>

  <p>"Not so very long, sir&mdash;not more than a quarter of an hour."</p>

  <p>"Ah! well, good evening," said Mr. Ashley, turning away. "I am much
  obliged to you. Sorry to have disturbed you, though. I ought to have
  remembered that you were away during the time that the jewels were
  stolen."</p>

  <p>"Seems a very mysterious affair, madam," he admitted, on his return to the
  upper regions. "If anything occurs to me, however, I will, of course, let you
  know. Good-night, ma'am; good-night, my lord," and Mr. Ashley bowed himself
  out of the room.</p>

  <p>"Clear as daylight," he murmured to himself, as he walked slowly
  homewards; "but a nasty job to tackle."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the quiet smile on his lips did not denote any great
  distaste in his task.</p>

  <p>Early on the following morning he took the 'bus up to Highgate, and
  alighted at the road at which Lady Somerville resided. There was a cab-stand
  near, and he entered the shelter and made a few inquiries, the result of
  which appeared to be perfectly satisfactory. Then he took down a name and
  address, after which a certain coin of the realm found its way into the dirty
  but eager palm of one of the Jehus.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be getting on. He set off, after leaving the shelter, for a
  very different part of town, and entered a low, dirty-looking little shop,
  from behind the counter of which a somewhat dirty-looking Jew bowed to him
  obsequiously.</p>

  <p>"A few words with you, Jacob," said the detective shortly; and, in
  obedience to a gesture, he followed the man into a little back room.</p>

  <p>The few words lasted fully an hour, at the end of which time Mr. Ashley
  emerged from the shop with a confident smile upon his lips.</p>

  <p>His morning's work was not yet finished, though. He made some more calls,
  but chiefly now upon his most distinguished patrons, including Lord
  Maclenie's friend, who had recommended him. As a rule, Society doings
  possessed no manner of interest for him, but today he was incessantly asking
  questions about different people, and at the end of the morning his satisfied
  smile had not decreased.</p>

  <p>The next day he called again at Hyde Park Gardens. Mrs. Tregarron was out;
  but the announcement of her absence did not appear to be an overwhelming
  shock to him. In fact, he had just watched her drive away. He would see Miss
  Tregarron.</p>

  <p>The servant to whom he conveyed his request was not at all sanguine as to
  the young lady's willingness to see him, but he was shown into the
  morning-room and his message taken. In a very few minutes a tall, handsome
  girl swept into the room and confronted him. The detective rose and
  bowed.</p>

  <p>"You wish to speak with me, Mr.&mdash;Mr. Ashley, I believe?" she said,
  slightly acknowledging his salutation. "Be as quick as you can, please, as
  I'm particularly engage."</p>

  <p>"I will not detain you a moment longer than is necessary, Miss Tregarron,"
  he said quietly. "Permit me to offer you a chair."</p>

  <p>She sat down and fixed her dark eyes upon him, full of impatient inquiry.
  Mr. Ashley hesitated. He had a delicate task before him, and he knew nothing
  of this young lady's disposition.</p>

  <p>"Will you permit me," he said slowly, "to tell you a short story which has
  come under my notice lately? It will not detain you long, and you will,
  perhaps, find it interesting."</p>

  <p>She arched her magnificent eyebrows, as if somewhat surprised at his
  presumption, but motioned him to proceed.</p>

  <p>"We detectives come across some strange incidents sometimes," he began,
  "and unravel some curious tangles. Listen to this story, for instance, none
  the less interesting, perhaps, since it is strictly true. There was a young
  lady and young gentleman who fell in love with one another. Both were poor,
  both were in Society, and the young lady was everywhere expected to make a
  brilliant match, for she was beautiful and her mother ambitious. This young
  gentleman with whom she had unfortunately fallen in love, although of
  excellent family, was not only poor, but was also hopelessly in debt; and so,
  seeing the utter impossibility of ever being married to the man she loved,
  the young lady yields to her mother's solicitations and becomes engaged to a
  rich young nobleman.</p>

  <p>"She has resolved to see no more of her unhappy lover, nor does she; but
  she hears of him often, for it happens that her maid and his manservant are
  brother and sister. She hears of his despair at the news of her engagement,
  of the terrible worry of his debts, and of his unsuccessful attempts to raise
  a certain sum of money to enable him to leave the country and start life
  afresh. Her pity for him is great, and she resolves anonymously to help him.
  At first, however, she is powerless, for she, too, is of a poor family, and
  the sum is an impossibility to her. Whilst she is striving hard to think of
  some means whereby to raise the money, her betrothed, a very rich but
  somewhat stingy young nobleman, makes her his first present&mdash;a diamond
  necklace of great value. An idea occurs to her. She cares nothing for the
  stones, and they are her own. Can she not secretly realize them, and thus
  obtain the money for her desperate lover? She resolves to do so, and lays her
  plans with considerable shrewdness. The necklace is believed by everyone to
  have been stolen; her lover receives the money in such a fashion that he
  imagines it to come from someone else from whom he has no hesitation in
  accepting it, and joyfully carries out his plans. Only two persons know the
  true facts of the cases&mdash;the young lady and myself."</p>

  <p>"A very romantic story, Mr. Ashley," said the young lady quietly, with her
  eyes fixed upon the carpet. "I should like to know the end."</p>

  <p>The detective smiled and cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"Well, the fact of&mdash;er&mdash;the second party becoming acquainted
  with this little story was most annoying to the young lady, as, of course,
  his disclosure of it would mean the breaking off of her marriage and social
  ruin. Fortunately, however, this second party was quite amenable to reason,
  and had not the slightest wish to ruin the young lady's prospects. He
  suggested to her, therefore, that she should promise him (on paper) to pay
  him twice the amount of the reward after her marriage and give him a small
  sum down to cover expenses." She, being a sensible girl, at once agreed to
  this.</p>

  <p>Miss Tregarron rose and moved toward the door.</p>

  <p>"You Will excuse me for a moment?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," and during her brief absence Mr. Ashley occupied himself in
  drawing up a little document.</p>

  <p>She was not gone long, and re-entered the room with a roll of notes in her
  hand.</p>

  <p>"To continue your story, Mr. Ashley," she said, with a levity in her tones
  which scarcely harmonized with her pallor-stricken face, "the young lady
  handed over fifty pounds in notes&mdash;all she could spare before her
  marriage, for she was, as you observed, very poor&mdash;and signed the
  document which the second party had prepared for her," and, sitting down at
  the table, she signed with a firm hand the slip of paper which lay before
  her. "That ends the story, I think, Mr. Ashley," she added, rising.</p>

  <p>"That ends the story, Miss Tregarron," the detective replied. "I wish you
  a very good-morning," and he bowed himself out of the room.</p>

  <p>"Your detective didn't turn up trumps, after all," remarked Lord Madenie
  to his friend in the smoking-room of the club, about a fortnight after his
  return from his honeymoon. "A regular duffer, I thought him."</p>

  <p>"I can't make it out," replied his friend thoughtfully. "Ashley doesn't
  often fail."</p>

  <p>Perhaps Mr. Ashley, after all, does not reckon this little affair as
  amongst his failures.</p>

  <p class="first">OCIETY was very considerably astonished when Sir Francis
  Cleydon, Bart., married the orphan daughter of a rich Australian planter, and
  suddenly exchanged the life of a man from town for the healthier but less
  exciting one of a country squire, society was very considerably astonished.
  The moral part of it expressed unbounded satisfaction and approval at the
  unexpected salvation of a man who had seemed to be going to the bad as fast
  as a man could go. The immoral faction sneered at his weakness in being led
  away from the lofty career of the pursuit of unlicensed pleasures by a girl's
  sweet face, and prophesied his speedy return to their ranks. They did not for
  a moment believe that his defection was a permanent one; their experience
  failed to recall to their minds a single case of a man who had gone as far on
  the road to ruin as their late <i>confrère</i> had done, and had yet been
  able to pull up short and abjure for ever the ways of unrighteousness. For
  six years Sir Francis had been the most reckless of turf plungers, and an
  almost nightly <i>habitué</i> of those clubs and private houses where the
  green tables form the principal part of the entertainment.</p>

  <p>Other vices he had, but this latter one seemed to fascinate him the most,
  and for years men had spoken of him as a confirmed gamester. His losses had
  lately been as much the topic for gossip as on his debut his wealth had been,
  and already every one was prophesying the near approach of the end. He had
  spent a huge fortune, and his fine estates were heavily mortgaged. They could
  bear no more charges, and the final crash seemed just about to descend, when,
  without the least warning or notification of his intentions, the whole of his
  racing stud, his London house, carriages and horses, and sundry other
  possessions, were advertised for sale, and his marriage with Miss Golding and
  retirement to Cleydon Hall announced in all the society papers.</p>

  <p>No one was more surprised than Sir Francis himself. He had lived so long
  amongst a school with whom it was considered d la mode to be blase and used
  up, that he had almost forgotten that he possessed any feelings at all. It
  was quite a new sensation to him when he fell in love with Helen Golding; it
  speedily became a revelation. He felt himself suddenly galvanized into life
  from the dull lethargy into which a long course of palliating pleasures had
  plunged him.</p>

  <p>At heart he was not a bad man, nor was he naturally vicious. His follies
  had been the not unnatural result of a slovenly guardianship on the part of a
  sporting uncle, and a careless, slipshod education. They had grown into
  habits, and he had yielded to them, never altogether without compunction; but
  the first breath of a good woman's influence, even though she was little more
  than a child, had awakened him into a keen and shameful realization of the
  miserable emptiness and folly of his grovelling life. He had wasted no time
  in irresolute regrets. He had confessed his whole life to Helen Golding, but
  he spoke of it as a thing of the past. He did not plead for her love as the
  price of his reformation, for that was a thing already assured; he only
  begged her to wait for a little while, and forget the Sir Francis of the past
  when the Sir Francis of the future should offer himself to her.</p>

  <p>She felt that he was sincere, and did not attempt to conceal her love for
  him; and before he left her it had been decided that the period of probation
  might be dispensed with. It would be easier for him as a married man to break
  off at once all connection with his former life. And so in less than a month
  they were married; and, while London was still agape with the news, they were
  wandering through Italy, and Sir Francis was realizing for the first time
  what happiness really was.</p>

  <p>Those sneering prophecies which Sir Francis's <i>quondam</i> associates
  had freely indulged in were not verified. The Leicestershire baronet never
  again formed one of their <i>coterie</i>, nor, indeed, did he ever feel the
  slightest inclination to do so. His reformation was sincere and complete, and
  his love for the woman whom he looked upon as his preserver was steadfast and
  unwavering. One only of his former tastes had survived the death-blow of his
  marriage, and with that one he had fought many desperate battles, and in all
  cases came off the victor. He had been reckoned a confirmed gambler, and,
  indeed, there had been in the old days no more ardent worshipper at the
  shrine of the green table than Sir Francis. It had become a passion with him,
  and several times since his marriage he had been horribly tempted. During his
  honeymoon he had shunned Monaco and other gambling centres, with the nervous
  dread inspired by his unwilling knowledge of the fascination which they still
  had over him; but subsequently his wife had unsuspectingly bidden him take
  her there, and he had been compelled to face a horrible temptation. He was
  nervous and ill at ease during the whole of their stay, scarcely venturing
  out of the hotel, and turning pale at the very mention of the
  gaming-tables.</p>

  <p>At first Lady Cleydon had thought him ill; but suddenly the truth dawned
  upon her, and she had declared at once that she was bored to death and
  longing to be away. Her husband heard her with joy, and when they left Monaco
  the next day he left it with the feeling of a conqueror. Since then they had
  been careful to avoid such places without hinting to one another why, and as
  years passed by, and local interest grew stronger with him, Sir Francis began
  to congratulate himself that the battle at Monaco had been a final and
  decisive one. Lady Cleydon's fortune, although a large one, had been
  insufficient to totally free the Cleydon estates from all encumbrance. There
  had been a third mortgage which it had not been possible to redeem; but when,
  two years after their marriage, a little Francis was born, his father and
  mother at once determined that it must and should be paid off before the boy
  grew up. It was not an easy matter to save a little over thirty thousand
  pounds even out of such a rent-roll as the Cleydon estate showed, for times
  were bad and farmers were all expecting large abatements. It was done,
  however; and by the time the boy reached his tenth birthday the money was
  forthcoming, and in a week's time Sir Francis and his wife reflected with
  satisfaction that the mortgage would be no more.</p>

        style="margin-left:20%; float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>One morning during that same week Sir Francis stood on the steps of the
  Cleydon Arms, smoking a cigar and lounging slightly against the side of the
  door. It was very seldom that he honoured the inn which bore his name (or the
  name of the estate) by his presence, still more seldom that he chose to
  advertise it by lingering about in the doorway; and the delighted proprietor,
  who remained discreetly in the rear rubbing his hands, and ready to rush
  forward at any moment if addressed, felt that every minute his distinguished
  guest remained there in that easy posture, in full view of the loiterers in
  the little town and right opposite the rival hostelry, was worth pounds to
  him. His sole regret was that Braggs the butcher, and Sneed the baker, and
  other frequenters of the Cleydon Arms were not present to witness this
  phenomenon; but even this regret was tempered by the reflection of how he
  would be able to embellish this unwonted occurrence, and astonish his little
  company with it at their evening meeting.</p>

  <p>Sir Francis himself was quite unaware that his presence was creating such
  a commotion in the mind of his obsequious host, and was lingering there
  simply because, until the blacksmith had finished shoeing his horse, he had
  nothing better to do.</p>

  <p>Presently it began to occur to him, however, that he was the object of a
  good deal of respectful curiosity on the part of the passers-by, and that his
  position was a trifle conspicuous. Accordingly he roused himself from some
  very pleasant meditations anent that scrip of legal parchment which he hoped
  soon to thrust on the fire, and decided upon a stroll down the street to the
  smithy. Before he had quitted his position, however, a figure approaching on
  the opposite side of the way attracted his notice, and he paused. Strangers
  were not common in Cleydon, and the man who was coming slowly towards him was
  not at all an ordinary stranger. He was tall, and of unmistakably well-bred
  appearance, with the slight stoop of a horseman, and attired in a riding suit
  and cover-coat of no provincial cut.</p>

  <p>He favoured the loiterer on the steps with a bland, inoffensive stare as
  he passed him and entered the inn, but that his face invited no salutation,
  Sir Francis would have bidden him good morning promptly. When he had
  disappeared the baronet turned round and interviewed the landlord.</p>

  <p>"Know that gentleman?" he inquired, indicating with the end of his cigar
  the stairs up which the stranger had passed.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Sir Francis. He's taken the whole of the first floor, and all
  my stabling for the hunting season. Honourable Bernard Granville's his name,
  Sir Francis. Got some very pretty animals, too, and looks like a straight
  goer."</p>

  <p>Sir Francis was necessarily interested, for he was the master of the
  principal pack of hounds in the locality, and a very good master, too.</p>

  <p>"Take my card up, Bowles," he told the landlord. "I should like to make
  Mr. Granville's acquaintance." And, delighted at the notice accorded to his
  guest, Bowles hurried obediently away.</p>

  <p>Mr. Granville would be very pleased to see Sir Francis. And so the baronet
  was shown up into the sitting-room and announced with all pomp. The two men
  speedily fraternized. The most important consideration&mdash;who was Mr.
  Granville? &mdash;was satisfactorily explained in the first few minutes. The
  Granvilles of Somerset were a county family of undoubted respectability,
  members of whom, indeed, graced the pages of Debrett's Peerage, and to a
  younger branch of them Mr. Granville belonged.</p>

  <p>This question settled, there was some desultory conversation about horses,
  dogs, cattle-breeding, and other agricultural matters, concerning all of
  which Mr. Granville seemed to know a good deal, and Sir Francis began to
  consider him a very decent sort of fellow. He explained that he had come down
  a fortnight before the opening of the regular season, meaning to spend the
  intervening period with an old friend, Colonel Ashton, but, unfortunately,
  Ashton was dangerously ill, and could receive no visitors, so he had been
  forced to occupy his hunting quarters earlier than he had intended. Sir
  Francis winced a little at the mention of Colonel Ashton's name, for he was
  notoriously a member of the fast set to which he himself had once belonged,
  but he did not on that account abate his favourable impressions of his new
  acquaintance. He had lived so long amongst rustics that the conversation of a
  well-bred and well-informed man was particularly pleasing&mdash;so pleasing,
  indeed, that, when he rose to go, he pressed Mr. Granville to return with him
  and spend at Cleydon Hall the period which he had intended to spend with
  Colonel Ashton. This Mr. Granville at first refused to do, but eventually he
  agreed to return with Sir Francis to dinner, and leave the matter of his
  further stay for subsequent discussion.</p>

  <p>With Lady Cleydon Mr. Granville did not progress quite so well. She
  wondered what had brought the crow's feet and wrinkles into his otherwise
  young looking face, and she made a very shrewd guess as to their existence in
  conjunction with a pallid, almost sallow complexion. Still, she was, of
  course, civil to her husband's guest, and when she left them together to
  discuss, as she fondly imagined, the claret and the prospects of the
  approaching hunting season, she did so without any presentiment of evil. And
  yet, had she only known it, the Honourable Bernard Granville was the most
  dangerous man in England to leave alone with her husband.</p>

  <p>For a while the two men chatted pretty well in the manner which she had
  anticipated; then Mr. Granville asked his host a fatal question.</p>

  <p>"Do anything at <i>écarté</i>?" he inquired carelessly, toying with a
  dessert knife.</p>

  <p>Sir Francis started quietly, and a shiver ran through his entire frame.
  The old passion was not yet dead.</p>

  <p>"Not lately," he answered in a low tone. "I think we have no cards in the
  house."</p>

  <p>Mr. Granville looked astonished. A country house which did not boast a
  single pack of cards was an anomaly such as he had rarely come across.</p>

  <p>"Oh, as for that," he answered, "I have plenty in my portmanteau; but
  perhaps it's hardly worth the trouble of fetching them. Suppose we go in to
  Lady Cleydon instead," he suggested, drinking off his claret and rising.</p>

  <p>Sir Francis was in the toils of a horrible temptation. Surely it was his
  duty to entertain his guest; a few hands could do no harm. Supposing he was
  unfortunate, he could afford to lose a hundred or two; and side by side with
  these plausible reflections was the old longing to handle once more the cards
  and experience the hopes and fears of the player. It was too strong for
  him.</p>

  <p>"Lady Cleydon will scarcely expect us so soon," he remarked, hastily
  pouring out a glass of wine and drinking it off. "I should rather like just
  one game. Couldn't my man find the cards."</p>

  <p>Mr. Granville shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Just as you please. I think there's a pack of cards in my great coat
  pocket. It hangs up in the hall."</p>

  <p>Sir Francis rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Well, fetch them, then," he said, with an excited sparkle in his eyes.
  "Come across into the library, Granville; we shall find it warmer there."</p>

  <p>Mr. Granville rose, and having leisurely lighted another cigar followed
  his host across the hall into a smaller apartment. Sir Francis drew a small
  table up to the fire, and the two men seated themselves. At first the play
  seemed pretty even, but after a while the luck set steadily against Sir
  Francis. So far from causing him to desist, however, this seemed to render
  him more eager. He plunged, doubled the stakes, trebled them, but the result
  was always the same. Great beads of perspiration began to stand out on his
  forehead, and he dared not glance twice at the I.0.U.'s which he was
  constantly handing across to his adversary. At last the latter threw down the
  cards.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you fully realize, Sir Francis," he said in a slow
  grave tone, rendered a little tremulous by the excitement which he was
  struggling to conceal, "that I have won an exceedingly large sum of money
  from you. I shall play no longer; the luck is all on my side."</p>

  <p>"You will give me my revenge?" said Sir Francis eagerly. "Let us go on
  now."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," replied Mr. Granville, rising and collecting his I.O.U's;
  " don't you see that it is quite light? This evening, if you like, you shall
  try to relieve me of some of those," and he tapped the little bundle of
  papers which he held with his forefinger.</p>

  <p>About an hour later Lady Cleydon was awakened by a slight noise in her
  room. At the foot of her bed stood her husband, with ghastly face, bloodshot
  eyes, and disordered attire. He stood there, in the full light of the early
  morning sun which was streaming in at the window, with folded arms looking at
  her.</p>

  <p>"Francis," she cried, a dreadful fear settling down upon her, "what have
  you been doing?"</p>

  <p>He laughed savagely.</p>

  <p>"Gambling, Helen, gambling! A thousand curses upon the cards! I'll win it
  all back to-night, though! By God, I will! We'll pay off the mortgage yet!
  What a fool I was to double that last stake with the luck dead against
  me!"</p>

  <p>She sprang up, her eyes ablaze with wrathful indignation.</p>

  <p>"Francis, have you been gambling with that money?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic20"
     name="pic20"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>His eyes fell before hers, and he turned towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Ay, and lost it!" he said sullenly. "I'll win it back, though; I'll win
  it back!"</p>

  <p>She turned from him, her face full of loathing scorn. She uttered no words
  of reproach, no reminders of his broken vow. She spoke never another word,
  and he slunk away like a whipped dog.</p>

  <p>That was a miserable day at Cleydon Hall. Sir Francis went for a long
  ride, and did not return until late in the afternoon. His guest lunched
  alone, and spent the afternoon strolling about the park, and Lady Cleydon did
  not leave her room until evening. When her husband returned, she followed him
  to his room.</p>

  <p>"Francis," she pleaded, laying her hand upon his arm, "grant me a
  favour."</p>

  <p>He listened without speaking.</p>

  <p>"What is done cannot be undone," she continued softly. "Promise me not to
  play to-night, and we will forget everything else."</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "Impossible, Helen. If I have to pay that man what I
  lost last night, I should never have another happy moment. I shall win it
  back."</p>

  <p>Again she pleaded, but in vain. Then she left him; instinct told her that
  words would be wasted. Bernard Granville was lounging in an easy chair in the
  library, when the door opened, and admitted his beautiful hostess, for Lady
  Cleydon was a very beautiful woman still.</p>

  <p>He rose at once, and offered her a chair. She declined it, and remained
  standing on the hearth-rug, nervously toying with a bracelet.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Granville," she said abruptly, "you won a good deal of money from my
  husband last night."</p>

  <p>He bowed. "Sir Francis was certainly most unfortunate," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I have come to ask you a favour," she went on hurriedly. "I want you to
  go away, and not play any more with him. You have won a fortune from him
  already. Isn't that enough?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her steadily for a minute or two. With her large blue eyes,
  and simple, eager manner, she seemed almost like a child.</p>

  <p>"I have promised to give Sir Francis his revenge," he said quietly, "and I
  am bound in honour to do so."</p>

  <p>Her heart sank, but she did not lose courage.</p>

  <p>"Will you come with me?" she said, moving towards the door. "I want to
  show you something."</p>

  <p>He followed her in silence along many corridors and up many stairs. At
  last she paused, and opened the door of a large, lofty room.</p>

  <p>"Francis, I have brought some one to see you," she said.</p>

  <p>A fair-haired little boy, with his mother's large, blue eyes and his
  father's straight, well-cut features, bounded over towards them. Then,
  remembering his manners, he held out his hand to the visitor, and looked up
  shyly.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Mr. Granville? I know your name, you see, because we saw
  you in the park this afternoon, and nurse told me."</p>

  <p>Mr. Granville nodded.</p>

  <p>"It's a very beautiful park," he said, somewhat absently.</p>

  <p><a id="pic21"

        style="margin-right:20%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Little Francis agreed with him, and then turned to his mother. Presently
  she checked his flow of eager, childish conversation, and declared that they
  must go.</p>

  <p>Mr. Granville shook hands with his little host, and silently followed her
  out of the room and down into the library. She closed the door, and moved
  close up to his side.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Granville," she said earnestly, "I would not have taken you up there
  only that there is something in your face that I like. I am sure that you can
  be generous. I want you to put yourself in my place for one moment. I don't
  know whether you ever heard about my marriage; I should think not," she said,
  looking at his old-young face, guiltless of beard or moustache. "You cannot
  be very old, and it was some years ago. Sir Francis had been a gambler, and
  he was heavily in debt; but he promised never to touch a card again. I
  trusted him, and until last night he has kept his promise faithfully. For
  years we have been saving and pinching to free the estate from debt for
  little Francis. Last night has undone it all. Of course, you only did what
  any one else would have done," she went on hastily. "You won, and you had a
  right to win. I am not blaming you in the least; but, oh, if you would only
  go away now! If you go on playing you will win. I am sure you will;
  and&mdash;and&mdash;my poor little Francis, Mr. Granville; I took you up to
  see him because I thought you must have been something like him once, and you
  might think of that time and have pity on him. Fancy what your mother would
  have felt like if some one had threatened to ruin her little boy! Oh, do go
  away, Mr. Granville! I will never grudge what you have won! I&mdash;I will
  always think kindly of you, and bless you if you will go. You will, won't
  you?"</p>

  <p>He looked down at her with an odd look in his boyish face.</p>

  <p>"You ask a difficult thing, Lady Cleydon," he said, "for I am what your
  husband was&mdash;a confirmed gambler."</p>

  <p>"But you will go?" she pleaded breathlessly. He shook his head. "I can't
  refuse to give him his revenge," he said; "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what?"</p>

  <p>"On one condition I will promise to win no more money from him."</p>

  <p>"What condition?"</p>

  <p>"Simply that you will come and sit with us while we play."</p>

  <p>She shuddered; but her resolution was soon taken.</p>

  <p>"I consent," she said. "Now take me in to dinner."</p>

  <p>It was a strange meal, and no one was sorry when it was over. Sir Francis,
  indeed, was recklessly gay; but both his wife and his guest were strangely
  silent. When the time came for Lady Cleydon to retire she kept her seat. Her
  husband looked at her questioningly.</p>

  <p>"You are determined to play to-night?" she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. I am going to relieve Granville of a few of his pieces of
  paper," Sir Francis said, with a nervous attempt at jocularity.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," she replied; "I shall remain too."</p>

  <p>Sir Francis protested querulously, angrily; but in vain. When they went
  into the library, Lady Cleydon followed them, and established herself in an
  easy-chair before the fire.</p>

  <p><a id="pic22"
     name="pic22"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>The game commenced, and proceeded hour after hour with the same result.
  The tide of luck seemed to have turned in favour of Sir Francis. One by one
  his I.O.U.'s were handed back to him, and were flung into the fire; at last
  there remained but one. The cards were dealt. Granville led; and Sir Francis
  played the king, and won the piece of paper.</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet, pale, trembling, but determined.</p>

  <p>"Granville," he said huskily, "we are quits, I believe."</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>Sir Francis seized the pack of cards in his hand, and dashed them into the
  grate.</p>

  <p>"Thank God!" he exclaimed. "Helen, look up. You will forgive me? This has
  been a lesson to me, and I am cured at last. Never again shall a card pass
  through my fingers. Need I swear it?"</p>

  <p>She looked up, with a great relief in her face, and then turned round full
  of gratitude to Mr. Granville. He was leaning forward against the table, with
  his head buried in his hands. Scarcely noticing her husband, she rose, and,
  gliding noiselessly to his side, touched his arm.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Granville!"</p>

  <p>He shrank from her and started to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Lady Cleydon," he said hastily, in a tone so full of agony that it
  brought the tears into her eyes, "don't speak to me! Don't come near me! Keep
  away, and listen."</p>

  <p>The hard look had gone from his face, and he looked almost like a boy. He
  had moved to the other side of the table, and was leaning over towards
  them.</p>

  <p>"Lady Cleydon," he said hastily, "I have a confession to make. You think
  that I'm a gentleman. I ought to be; but I'm not. I'm a blackguard and a
  card-sharper!"</p>

  <p>Sir Francis started; Lady Cleydon never moved, but her soft blue eyes
  remained fixed upon him, full of a gentle pity.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you a little of my story," he went on. "If Sir Francis lived
  in town, he would have known it, and he would not have received me here. I
  haven't deceived you about my name. My name is still Granville, although my
  family have offered me money to change it more than once. I was a younger
  son, and never had a penny of fortune. For that reason, I suppose, my father
  sent me into the Guards, and expected me to live like a gentleman on my pay.
  I became fond of cards, became skillful, and soon began to depend upon them
  to keep me. It was all very well for a time; but by degrees men began to get
  shy of playing with me, and gradually whispers began to get about that
  I&mdash;I cheated. It was a foul lie," he went on passionately; "but people
  believed it. I was obliged to leave the regiment, and I sank lower and lower.
  My luck began to desert me, and I was at my wit's end. Then Colonel Ashton
  told me that you had once been a desperate gambler, and now lived quite away
  from the world. I came to Cleydon for the sole purpose of ruining you if I
  could. You brought me here, and last night for the first time in my fife I
  played with marked cards. I was sorry for it; and, Lady Cleydon, it was you
  who made me feel that if I did not undo what I had done I should be miserable
  for life! If I had kept that money I should have gone to Australia, and tried
  to live a new life; but I'm glad I didn't keep it. You can turn me out of the
  house now if you like, Sir Francis," he said, with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>There was a long silence, then Lady Cleydon rose and moved to his
  side.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Granville," she said, "no one will turn you out of this house. Will
  you shake hands with me?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her wistfully, incredulously. Then suddenly his lower Up grew
  tremulous, and he burst into tears. He was but a boy after all.</p>

  <p>That last mortgage was not paid off until the following year, for Sir
  Francis and his wife found another use for a small part of the money. It was
  not much that Bernard Granville would accept as a loan from his new friends,
  but it was enough to win him fortune and honour in the new world. And the
  letter which Lady Cleydon gave him to her uncle and <i>quondam</i> guardian,
  Mr. Golding, won him something far more precious&mdash;a true, loving wife.
  He had loved her first for her sister's sake, but very soon for her own; and

  <h3>No record of magazine publication found</h3>

  <p class="first">IT WAS very fashionable and very dull. Captain Herbert
  Crawford was heartily sorry that he had come; yet now he was there he could
  not in decency leave for half an hour, so he screwed his eyeglass firmly into
  his right eye, folded his arms with an air of invincible martyrdom, and
  detaching himself as much as possible from the crush, took up his favourite
  position against the wall.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Archibald's afternoons had nothing particular to recommend them, and
  yet they were always crowded. Nothing unusual was ever offered in the way of
  entertainment, nor were the Archibalds themselves remarkably high up in the
  social scale, yet somehow it had got to be the fashion to go to their
  afternoons. Herbert Crawford, glancing languidly through the rooms, noticed a
  good many very distinguished people, and wondered why they came.</p>

  <p>Nothing could be more stupid than this confused babel of small talk, in
  which he himself had been compelled to take his share. There were none of the
  attractions offered by more eager hostesses, no new beauty or lion of any
  sort to stimulate interest or curiosity. The whole thing was profoundly and
  unutterably stupid, and one young man in particular was profoundly and
  unutterably bored.</p>

  <p>From boredom to disgust is only a stage. Just as he was calculating the
  chances of a well-timed movement towards the door, a servant crossed the room
  going to be music, then. Herbert Crawford, who was a Philistine and hated the
  music of the future, repressed with difficulty an impatient frown, and
  resigned himself to a quarter of an hour's agony. There was a slight hush,
  and he looked up wearily, never doubting but that he should see a young man
  of the usual type&mdash;a long-haired, weak-legged, weak-voiced tenor, with a
  roll of music under his arm, and a sickly simper on his pale face. This was
  an "advanced" house, and he felt pretty sure that he knew the sort of thing
  they would go in for. As it happened, he was wrong.</p>

  <p>In the first place it was not a young man at all.</p>

  <p>Herbert Crawford was very nearly guilty of the unpardonable rudeness of an
  audible "egad!" as the musician approached. Not only was she a woman, but she
  was young, strikingly pretty, and was steadily returning his fixed gaze out
  of the largest, brightest, and most innocent-looking eyes he had ever seen in
  his life. She was demurely dressed in a plain black gown, relieved only by a
  white collar; but her figure was perfect, and the gown fitted. Everything
  about her was scrupulously neat and plain; even her wavy hair showed some
  signs of having been brushed back; yet there was something peculiarly piquant
  about her appearance, something which irresistibly suggested a spice of
  coquetry.</p>

  <p>Captain Crawford watched her withdraw her eyes and calmly sit down to play
  with a sudden interest. He was no longer bored, he was puzzled.</p>

  <p>Every one listened, every one admired, every one applauded when the
  performance was over, every one except Herbert Crawford. He was still in his
  old position, watching the little singer with a curious gleam in his blue
  eyes. Once she rose for a moment, and their eyes met over the top of the
  piano. She had just finished singing a gay little French chanson, during
  which every feature in her face had been alight with piquant merriment, and
  every one was applauding heartily. She looked at Herbert Crawford, whose
  handsome, languid face had assumed a sudden sternness, and met his intent
  gaze. The change which passed over her face was magical. Like a flash the
  gaiety and light left her features, and a dull grey pallor took its place. A
  momentary shiver passed through her frame, and her eyes seemed for a moment
  distended with horror. Then, at the sound of Mrs. Archibald's voice over her
  shoulder, she was herself again, and turned quietly round to meet her
  patroness.</p>

  <p>"You have done very well, Miss Lemaine," said Mrs. Archibald suavely.
  "General Reid is quite delighted with your singing, and I have given him your
  address. Call here to-morrow afternoon at about this time, if you have no
  engagement, and I think I can promise you a pupil."</p>

  <p>Miss Lemaine murmured her thanks, with her eyes fixed upon the carpet.</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," she said. "You will not want me again this afternoon?
  May I go?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. The man in the hall will fetch a cab for you, if you ask him.
  Ah, Lady Erdmont, I am so pleased to see you! How good of you to come!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Archibald turned away to speak to a late arrival, and, gathering up
  her music, Miss Lemaine moved away. Between her and the door Herbert Crawford
  was standing, and he was the only man in that part of the room. His duty was
  obvious, and he did it; he rose and opened the door for her gravely, and
  without the vestige of a smile. As she passed she looked up into his face
  with a sudden, mutely appealing glance, and he saw that there were tears in
  her bright eyes.</p>

  <p>"I want to speak to you," she said, in a low tone. "Please come away now.
  I shall wait in the square."</p>

  <p>He had no time to answer her, for she walked away without even looking
  behind. He turned back into the room, and hestitated. If he went, she would
  certainly make a fool of him. Like most of his sex, he could not bear to see
  a woman cry; and yet he must go&mdash;of course he must go.</p>

  <p>"Well, Captain Crawford, and what do you think of my young
  <i>protegée</i>?" asked Mrs. Archibald, as he advanced to make his
  <i>adieux</i>.</p>

  <p>"I think her singing excellent," he answered.</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad!" his hostess answered. "Do you know, I was thinking of
  recommending her to Lord Crawford for your sisters? He asked me only the
  other day if I knew of a singing mistress who had a style of her own, and
  Miss Lemaine's references are exceptionable."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" he answered. "May I ask in what shape they are? Miss Lemaine is
  not English, is she?"</p>

  <p>"I believe she's a Frenchwoman," Mrs. Archibald answered. "I had quite an
  enthusiastic letter from the Countess d'Armayne about her."</p>

  <p>He was a little surprised, but he made no remark. In a few minutes he took
  his leave, and hurried out into the street.</p>

  <p>It was a dreary March afternoon, and a cold damp wind was blowing a
  drizzling rain into his face. He turned up his coat collar and looked around.
  At first he thought that she was nowhere in sight, and, curiously enough, he
  was conscious of a distinct feeling of disappointment. Then, through the iron
  railings of the square, he caught sight of a little patch of black frock
  fluttering in the wind, and recognized it at once. He crossed the road, and
  in a few moments was by her side with uplifted hat.</p>

  <p>The last vestige of anger had left him as he looked down at her thin
  shabby jacket, and saw what pains she had taken to appear neat in clothes
  which had certainly seen better days. Perhaps she surprised the unconscious
  pity in his eyes. It seemed so, for a sudden flush stole into her pale
  cheeks, and she drew herself up with a dignified gesture.</p>

  <p>"I forget," she said, stopping in the middle of the pavement and turning
  round upon him. "You will not care to walk&mdash;to be seen in the streets
  with me! You had better not come. I will write to you."</p>

  <p>"That is not quite kind of you, Miss Lemaine," he said quietly. "Have I
  given you any reason to think me a snob? If you will let me see you home, I
  shall be quite happy."</p>

  <p>Miss Lemaine looked up at him, and the flush died out of her face. He had
  meant it, and she felt a little ashamed of herself.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Captain Crawford," she said simply, and they walked on side by
  side in the fast-gathering twilight. As they passed a lamp-post he stole a
  glance into her pale, wan little face, and his heart smote him for his
  suspicions. How forlorn she looked, and yet how brave!</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she said presently, "do you think that I am an adventuress, an
  impostor? I suppose you do, you must do."</p>

  <p>"But I don't," he answered promptly. "I only want to know."</p>

  <p>"You shall know everything," she said. "You shall come home with me, if
  you will. I cannot tell you in the streets."</p>

  <p>They walked on together, a strange-looking couple. He tall, distinctly an
  aristocrat, with his hands thrust deep down into the pockets of his loose
  overcoat, with a white gardenia in his buttonhole&mdash;a figure such as one
  might meet on the pavement of Pall Mall or St. James', but a little
  noticeable in the region they were entering upon. She was pale and anxious,
  with a sad gleam in her large dark eyes, and something foreign in her
  appearance, even her movements. Now and then people paused and looked after
  them, but they were quite unconscious of it. Once when they passed a busy
  thoroughfare, and looked down the broad lines of glittering lamps, and at the
  pavements thronged with hurrying men and women, she drew a little closer to
  him; and when they had left it behind, and the roar of traffic was no longer
  in their ears, she gave a little shudder.</p>

  <p>"I am glad it is quiet again," she said slowly. "That sound makes me
  sadder than anything in the world. It is dreadful!"</p>

  <p>He looked down at her compassionately.</p>

  <p>"You are too young to talk like that," he said.</p>

  <p>"I have forgotten what youth is," she answered bitterly. "I am nineteen, I
  think; but I feel an old woman. Ah, monsieur!" she added, in a more natural
  tone, and with more of the foreign accent, "to be in a great city like this,
  alone, friendless, poor, and see every one around struggling for themselves
  against the world&mdash;ah! it is enough to make one feel faint-hearted."</p>

  <p>"Don't call yourself friendless," he said impulsively. "May I not
  count?"</p>

  <p>"As a friend or enemy?" she asked. "Nay, I will, not ask that. You were a
  true friend to me once, and, though I was terrified to see you looking so
  stern at Mrs. Archibald's I don't think you meant to expose me, did you? It
  has been my first chance, and you could ruin me if you liked; but you will
  not?"</p>

  <p>"No, I will not," he assured her; "I would sooner die. But, forgive my
  asking, you will tell"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes; I will tell you everything," she interrupted, looking at him
  curiously. "Perhaps you know that Mrs. Archibald thought of recommending me
  to your father, Lord Crawford. Of course you want to be sure that I am a fit
  person to teach singing to your sisters. Well, I am respectable. Yes, I am,
  although you may not think it."</p>

  <p>He was pained by her tone, and a little hurt, for it was surely unjust in
  her. But, before he could say anything, she had timidly laid her hand upon
  his arm and was looking up into his face, her dark eyes swimming with
  tears.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," she said softly. "I ought not to talk like that; I had
  forgotten about that night. It was good of you not to have told Mrs.
  Archibald."</p>

  <p>"As if I should do such a thing!" he said hotly. "I am not a brute."</p>

  <p>"I am sure you are not," she answered, smiling up at him with a flash of
  her old mirth. "Now do you know where you are?"</p>

  <p>He looked around with an involuntary shudder.</p>

  <p>It was a dreary neighbourhood, a neighbourhood of shabby genteel
  six-roomed houses, where the smoke had discoloured the bricks, and laid a
  depressing hand everywhere. There was a green-grocer's shop on one side, and
  a public house on the other. The refuse from the former had been thrown out
  into the street, and some of it lay in a black puddle at their feet. The
  smell from a neighbouring tan-yard helped to poison the air. Dirty children
  were playing in the gutters, half-clad and ill-shaped. The windows of the
  long row of smoke-defaced houses were blindless and curtainless. The tiny
  strip of waste land in front of each was desolate, save for broken crockery
  and tin-ware, mingled with a few oyster shells. It was a land where the utter
  extinction of everything pertaining to beauty seemed to have been aimed at
  and successfully accomplished. In its place was utter wretchedness, utter
  ugliness, utter desolation.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember the place," he said.</p>

  <p>"It was here I left you on that night. I was ashamed to show you where I
  lived then. Now I am going to take you to it. Come!"</p>

  <p>She crossed the road, and he followed her; then, holding her head proudly,
  but with a curious trembling of the lips, she entered a wretched-looking
  greengrocer's shop, the whole stock of which seemed to consist of a few
  strings of onions, and a pile of half-rotten apples and potatoes in a common
  heap. A stout, red-faced woman was standing behind the counter shaking a few
  sickly-looking sweets out of a glass bottle into the outstretched hands of a
  small customer. At the entrance of her lodger with Herbert Crawford she
  suspended her operations and stared at them dumbfounded. Miss Lemaine crossed
  the floor of the shop without glancing towards her, and, opening a door at
  the further end, turned round and beckoned to her escort.</p>

  <p>"Will you come this way, please?" she said, looking steadily at him.</p>

  <p>He followed her, stooping low, and stumbling over a basket of onions which
  lay in the way. They were in a narrow passage, and through the open door of a
  room on the other side they could see a coarse, half-dressed young man
  lolling across two stools with a pipe in his mouth, and a cracked jug of beer
  by his side. He stared at Herbert Crawford in blank amazement, and when he
  commenced to ascend the rickety staircase after his guide, the young man
  burst out in a half-derisive, half-indignant exclamation. Miss Lemaine looked
  round quickly.</p>

  <p>"Take no notice, please," she whispered pleadingly. "He is my landlady's
  son, and I am afraid that he has had too much to drink."</p>

  <p>He nodded silently&mdash;he would have found speech rather difficult just
  then&mdash;and followed her on to the landing. She turned the handle of a
  door, and with a gesture bade him enter.</p>

  <p>She left him standing just inside the room, while she walked swiftly to a
  sofa, which was drawn up to the miserable, struggling fire. He only gave one
  quick glance around, but it was enough. It was just such a room as might have
  been expected in such a neighbourhood, in such a house. The tattered remains
  of a carpet only half covered the floor; a cheap, unwholesome-looking paper
  hung down from the wall; the horse hair sofa, with a great gap in its side,
  creaked and groaned on its castors. There had been curtains, but they had
  gone; pictures on the wall, but their place was empty. The table was of deal,
  only half covered by a soiled cloth; a cracked looking-glass and one cheap
  vase were the only ornaments of the chimney-piece. There was but one thing in
  its favour&mdash;the room was clean.</p>

  <p>He had taken it all in at a glance; and then his eyes rested upon the pale
  figure stretched on the sofa. It scarcely seemed like a living face, so thin
  and delicately chiselled were the features, and marble-white their pallor.
  The dark steadfast eyes&mdash;sightless he knew them to be&mdash;were turned
  towards him, but a pair of wonderfully thin arms were thrown around Miss
  Lemaine's neck, and he saw at once a certain likeness between the two
  faces.</p>

  <p>"Lenore, Lenore, you have come back at last, then," a faint voice was
  saying; "I have been so tired and restless. Tell me quickly. Did you succeed.
  Were they kind?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear, very," was the quiet reply. "How cold you are, and how bad the
  fire is! Hasn't Mrs. Rogers been up?"</p>

  <p>There was a slight weary movement of the little head.</p>

  <p>"Not once; no one has been. Lenore, there is some one with you; who is
  it?"</p>

  <p>Lenore rose to her feet, and, still holding the thin white hands, turned
  round to Captain Crawford.</p>

  <p>"It is a gentleman who has brought me home, Emilie. Captain Crawford, this
  is my sister. She is, as you see, an invalid."</p>

  <p>A great saddening pity rushed into his heart as he looked into the two
  pale faces turned towards him, so alike, yet so different in expression. In
  Lenore's half-eager half-appealing look there was something which seemed to
  beg him to speak kindly to the little invalid, and it touched him to the
  heart. He walked to the sofa, and, stooping down, took the frail little hands
  which Lenore yielded him so readily.</p>

  <p>"Your sister was good enough to let me walk home with her," he said. "She
  thought that you would like to hear from some one who was there how much
  every one liked her singing, and how successful she was. She is going to
  teach my sisters."</p>

  <p>A wonderfully sweet light flashed across the tiny white face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, how good of you to come and tell me," she cried, in a low tremulous
  voice. "Lenore, are you not happy? Tell me quick, shall we be able to leave
  this dreadful place?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear; we shall be able to leave very soon now. To-morrow, I
  hope."</p>

  <p>A sudden passion of tears and sobs convulsed the little face, but it was
  over in a moment, and she was smiling up into his face with a tremulous
  joy.</p>

  <p>"Don't think me very silly, please," she said pleadingly. "It is such
  happiness to think that we can get away from this place. You have a flower in
  your coat, haven't you? How delicious it smells! Please to come a little
  nearer."</p>

  <p>He drew it from his coat, and placed it between her eager fingers.</p>

  <p>"Do you like flowers? I will send you some," he said.</p>

  <p>"O, thank you; will you really? Yes, I like flowers, and all sweet
  perfumes; and I love the sunlight and the sound of the sea, and the country
  and soft voices&mdash;like yours and Lenore's&mdash;and music. I cannot see
  any of these things, you know, but I can feel them. Once we were so happy! I
  used to sit out in a garden and feel the sun, and hear the sea far away
  murmuring so faintly. But still I could hear it, rising and falling, even
  when it was very calm, and no one else could; and then there was a breeze
  rustling in the trees, and birds and insects creeping out into the sunshine
  and talking to one another (for they do talk, you know, though we cannot
  understand them); and then there was the sweet faint perfume of the flowers,
  and Lenore would read to me, and I would sit and think until I got drowsy and
  fell asleep. I don't think I minded much about being blind then, but it is
  all so different now&mdash;so different!"</p>

  <p>A little choking sob stopped her speech, and somehow Captain Crawford,
  Guardsman and man of the world, felt wonderfully inclined to echo it. He
  pressed the child's hand, and was silent for a moment. Then Lenore
  spoke:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Emilie, dear, would you mind leaving Captain Crawford and me alone for a
  minute or two? I have something to say to him." The child raised herself a
  little and picked up a crutch from the floor. For the first time Herbert
  Crawford saw how shrunken her form really was, and an infinite pity filled
  his heart. He had seen so little of this sort of thing, so little real
  suffering and pain.</p>

  <p>"Will Mr. Crawford come and see me again?" the child asked, turning a fair
  wistful face towards him.</p>

  <p>"Many times, I hope," he answered. "I shall come and see you as often as
  your sister will let me."</p>

  <p>She turned away with a sigh of contentment.</p>

  <p>"I am so glad," she said softly. "Thank you for the flower, Captain
  Crawford. Good-bye."</p>

  <p>He raised the little hand, which he had been holding, to his lips, and let
  it go. Then she left the room on her sister's arm.</p>

  <p>Lenore was back again almost immediately.</p>

  <p>Holding the door open she called to the woman below. Then, as the stairs
  began to creak beneath the heavy ascending footsteps, she came into the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Captain Crawford," she said quietly. "I am going to explain to you about
  that night."</p>

  <p>"It is not necessary," he began eagerly. "I" She held out her hand in a
  dignified manner.</p>

  <p>"If you do not feel it necessary, I do," she said. "Come in, Mrs.
  Rogers."</p>

  <p>The woman, who had been waiting in the shop below, came in, and took up a
  position just inside the door. She was dirty, half-dressed, with coarse red
  face and aggressive manners. Herbert Crawford looked away from her to the sad
  little figure by his side with relief.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Rogers," Lenore said, "I have sent for you to ask you a favour. I
  want you to explain to this gentleman how it happened that I was at the Star
  Music Hall one night last month."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Rogers moved her great arms from under her apron and stuck them
  akimbo.</p>

  <p>"Who be 'ee, to want ter know about your doings?" she inquired
  bluntly.</p>

  <p>"This gentleman is a friend of mine, and I wish you to tell him," was the
  quiet reply.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Rogers tossed her head in a manner which she meant to be
  sarcastic.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I mind doing that," she said. "My dortor
  Sal&mdash;she's a singer, down at the Star&mdash; got a reg'lar engagement
  like, and she was bad, in bed. We sent down word that she couldn't come out,
  and they sent back that unless she cum and did her turn, or sent summun else
  that would, she was sacked. This young 'ooman 'ere's a singer, and she went
  instead one night. That's 'ow it was, I reckon."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Rogers has omitted to mention," Lenore said, turning to Herbert
  Crawford," that Sal has been kind to us, kinder than any one else in this
  place, and she was very anxious not to have her engagement cancelled; also
  that I owed Mrs. Rogers money, and she threatened that unless I consented
  that she would turn Emilie and me out into the street. I sang one song there
  and then came away. Directly I got outside I was annoyed, and you were
  passing by and rescued me. Now you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," he answered.</p>

  <p>"May I arsk, miss, was that hall you wanted me for?" asked Mrs.
  Rogers.</p>

  <p>Lenore turned a shade paler.</p>

  <p>"That is all now, Mrs. Rogers," she said softly. "To-morrow morning I
  shall be able&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow morning be d&mdash;d for a tale," interrupted Mrs. Rogers
  angrily. "I've heard it hoften enough. I wants my money, and I'll hev it, or
  out on the streets&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Silence, woman!" thundered Captain Crawford.</p>

  <p>She paused, with her mouth wide open for a torrent of abuse, and stared in
  a stupefied way at the pale boyish face and flashing blue eyes. She was the
  virago of the neighbourhood, and neither man nor woman had dared to speak
  thus to her before. Yet there was something quelling in the quiet disdain of
  that aristocratic supercilious face, which had recovered its calm almost
  immediately. She did not understand it at all, but she felt conquered.</p>

  <p>He had moved to the door, and was holding it open.</p>

  <p>"You will go downstairs and fetch Miss Lemaine's bill at once," he said
  quietly.</p>

  <p>She looked at him, made one last effort to recover her lost power of
  speech, and submitted. Herbert Crawford closed the door after her, and looked
  round for Lenore. She was very pale, and was leaning against the table, with
  her head half-hidden between her hands.</p>

  <p>"Miss Lemaine," he said, "I am going to ask you a great favour. I am going
  to claim the right we all have of assisting our fellow creatures now and
  then. It is only for a very short time, remember, for things will be very
  different with you soon. There is your sister, too. For her sake you must let
  me help you a little; you will, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"How can I help it?" she said, looking up at him with dim eyes. "How good
  you are! I have struggled, and struggled, and from a stranger I would sooner
  have died than taken help. But from you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She held out her hands, and he took them in his with a strange thrill of
  pleasure. Neither of them spoke. He was fighting against a sudden maddening
  desire to take that sad little figure in his arms, and hold it there, and to
  whisper into her ear that the long and weary struggle was over,
  that&mdash;</p>

  <p>Suddenly he released her hands with a burning sense of shame. God help him
  from such thoughts as these! He had been of the world, and its taint was upon
  him. But to think of her like that! it was foul heresy. His whole better self
  leaped up to strengthen him; they should be his sisters, and he would be very
  good to them.</p>

  <p>There was something strange about that silence between them, and they were
  glad to have it broken even by strange means. There was a sound like a kick
  at the door, and it burst open. The man whom they had seen drinking below
  walked into the room. His coarse brutal face was inflamed with drink and
  anger, and his breath exhaled the mingled odour of drink and foul tobacco
  from the short pipe between his teeth.</p>

  <p>"I'll be d&mdash;d if we're a-goin' to stand this 'ere sort of goings on!"
  he exclaimed, walking threateningly up to the pair. "Our lodgers 'ere has got
  to keep themselves respectable or else they go on to the blessed streets. We
  ain't going to allow no gemmun visitors 'ere, so there, miss. Why for all
  your proud ways, ye are no better than&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The conclusion of his speech never came. Without moving a muscle of his
  face, Captain Crawford had first struck the pipe from between the man's teeth
  and then knocked him down. For a moment he was too stunned and too astonished
  to rise, and during that moment Captain Crawford turned rapidly to
  Lenore.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon for doing that," he said. "It was stupid to be angry
  with such an animal. You must leave this place at once now. Bring what
  luggage you can, and leave the rest. Don't be frightened. Your room is next
  to this, isn't it? Go in and fetch Emilie and your things. I will wait for
  you on the landing."</p>

  <p>She obeyed him trembling, and they left the room together, passing the
  semi-recumbent figure of Sam Rogers. He looked up with an evil smile, and
  then, gathering himself up, staggered out after them. He found Herbert
  Crawford on the landing alone.</p>

  <p>Rogers had no small reputation as a bruiser, and he saw nothing in the
  straight slim figure before him to fear&mdash;nothing save that absolute
  coolness and languid self-assurance which irritated him beyond measure. He
  took his coat off and spat upon his hands.</p>

  <p>Captain Crawford watched him unmoved.</p>

  <p>"Look here, young man," he said quietly, "if you'll take my advice, you'll
  be satisfied with what you've had and be off. Well, if you will have
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Now Crawford had been reckoned the most skillful boxer of his college, and
  had kept in practice in the regimental gymnasium, besides which he was a
  young Englishman of the genuinely athletic type, and his limbs, though slim,
  were hard and sinewy. The consequence was that when Lenore opened the door of
  her room in terror a moment or two afterwards, Mr. Samuel Rogers was lying on
  his face sobbing drunken tears. Captain Crawford was quietly drawing on his
  gloves, without a scratch on his handsome face.</p>

  <p>"Have you hurt him," cried Lenore fearfully.</p>

  <p>"Not so much as he deserves," he answered coolly. "We will leave at once
  if you are ready. Give me the box, please."</p>

  <p>He lifted it from the ground&mdash;a small tin trunk&mdash; and, taking
  Emilie, carried her downstairs. Lenore came close behind. There they met Mrs.
  Rogers.</p>

  <p>"What 'ah yer been doin' to my Sam'l?" she cried fiercely; "and three pun
  ten shillings I want from you, young 'ooman, or you don't quit my house."</p>

  <p>Herbert Crawford counted four pounds into her hand, and took up the box
  again.</p>

  <p>"You can give the change to your son to cure his broken head. Come along,
  Miss Lemaine."</p>

  <p>They walked through the shop and out into the street. Then he put down the
  box, and they all looked at one another.</p>

  <p>They were certainly a strange-looking group. Crawford, handsome and
  debonair in the fashionable garments of his class, looked every inch an
  earl's son. Under his arm was a bundle of old umbrellas and wraps. His foot
  was resting lightly on a small tin box, and Emilie's hand was through his
  other arm. Both the girls looked lamentably shabby, and Emilie's crutch was
  patched up in many places. They were both watching him anxiously, and both
  were immensely relieved when they saw a slight twitching of the lips deepen
  into a smile as he looked from one to the other. He had not one atom of false
  pride, and he was enjoying the situation immensely, notwithstanding its
  perplexities.</p>

  <p>"A council of war," he exclaimed lightly, "and I vote myself into the
  chair. The first thing which the lodgings-hunter does is to get a cab. Isn't
  that so?"</p>

  <p>Emilie clapped her hands.</p>

  <p>"Of course it is. Oh, how clever you are, Captain Crawford! Are we going
  far away from here?"</p>

  <p>"As far as possible," he answered. "Now let me see, what part shall we
  try?"</p>

  <p>"Somewhere where they are quite cheap, please," Lenore said anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I'll see to that," he answered confidently. "You shall hear me bargaining
  with the landlady."</p>

  <p>"What fun," laughed Emilie. "I shall like that."</p>

  <p>Captain Crawford considered for a moment. It had suddenly occurred to him
  that without references, or, worse still, with his reference and presence, it
  would be no easy matter for them to obtain respectable lodgings. Nobody is so
  censorious and suspicious as the London landlady, and to be accompanied by
  Captain Crawford of the Guards, son of the Earl of Crawford, would scarcely
  be a recommendation for a poor singer and her sister. Watching him closely,
  Lenore divined something of his thoughts, and a deep flush stole into her
  face.</p>

  <p>"I think Captain Crawford had better not come with us," she said
  faintly.</p>

  <p>"Think you're going to get rid of me, do you?" he laughed "Come along;
  it's all right. I've got a capital idea. We only want a cab now, and we shall
  be right."</p>

  <p>He took up the box again and looked along the road. There was no vehicle
  in sight, except a small handsome brougham with a pair of dark bays, the
  footman and coachman of which were gazing curiously at the little group. As
  it approached the coachman pulled his horses up, and touching his hat, looked
  inquiringly at Captain Crawford.</p>

  <p>"Egad! here's a piece of luck!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Why, Gregson, what on earth are you doing out here?" he asked the man as
  he brought the carriage round with a little sweep and drew up by the
  kerbstone.</p>

  <p>"To the mission room at St. Philip's with some parcels, my lord. The bays
  wanted exercising, so I put them in the brougham."</p>

  <p>"This is capital, girls," Captain Crawford exclaimed, as the tall footman
  shouldered the trunk and held the door open. "Emilie, take my hand. That's
  right. Now, Miss Lemaine. I want to go to No. 18, Pitt Street, John Reynolds'
  house, you know. This is better than a growler, isn't it?" he said, as the
  carriage rolled on.</p>

  <p>"Yes; ought we to be here?" asked Lenore, a little awed, for she had seen
  the earl's coronet on the panel.</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"Considering the carriage is mine," he said, "I don't think we're taking a
  great liberty. The horses are my father's, but I use them whenever I like.
  Now let me tell you where we're going to."</p>

  <p>"If you please," Lenore said.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's not a grand place by any means; but I think you'll be
  comfortable. Ten years ago a coachman of my father's married one of the
  housemaids&mdash;romantic affair, wasn't it&mdash;and they took a nice little
  house at Pitt Street, and a lodger. I happen to know that the lodger left
  last week, and that they haven't got another one. I think it will do
  capitally for you, because it's nicely situated, and you won't have so far to
  go backward and forwards, Miss Lemaine, and here we are."</p>

  <p>The carriage had pulled up in a quiet street before a row of solid,
  comfortable-looking houses. In five minutes everything was arranged. A few
  words from Captain Crawford, and Mrs. Reynolds was dropping curtsies to the
  two young ladies, and welcoming them heartily. No need of references or
  certificates of respectability. One of the family had brought them, and that
  was enough for Mrs. Reynolds. Besides, the fair sweet face of the little
  invalid, and Lenore's darker but more impressive beauty, only a little marred
  by suffering and anxiety, had already won her heart. From the first moment
  she was enthusiastic about them.</p>

  <p>As for the girls themselves, the utter change in their surroundings seemed
  almost incredible. The sitting-room, in which they were soon ensconced in
  cosy easy chairs before a bright fire, was not only comfortable, it was
  really tastefully and well furnished. Mrs. Rogers and her drunken son seemed
  to belong to another world. Here everything was pleasant, and smiling, and
  friendly. Emilie leaned back in her chair, steeped in a sort of dreamy
  satisfaction; Lenore, who had borne all the strain of their long struggle
  with poverty, was nervous and a little hysterical.</p>

  <p>They were alone quite ten minutes, and then Captain Crawford came in, hat
  in hand. He was fast becoming quite a master of tact, and commenced talking
  at once.</p>

  <p>"I think Mrs. Reynolds will make you girls comfortable," he said cheerily.
  "Don't you attempt to talk business with her, Miss Lenore. I'll arrange all
  that for you. And I must go now, because I asked a man to dine with me, and
  it's getting late. My sisters will come and see you in a day or two."</p>

  <p>"But you will come, too, won't you?" begged Emilie, holding one of his
  hands between hers.</p>

  <p>"Rather; you'll find I shall be a regular nuisance, he laughed. "I'm
  coming to read to you, Emilie, and I won't forget the flowers. Good-bye.
  Goodbye, Miss Lenore."</p>

  <p>And then, before they had quite realized it, he had gone, and their
  proceedings became purely feminine. Lenore sank on her knees by her sister's
  side, and Emilie's arms stole round her neck.</p>

  <p>"Isn't he good?" sobbed the little invalid. "We shall never, never, never
  be able to repay him. Wasn't it grand, Lennie, the way he brought us away
  from that awful place. Oh, I do wish I could see him. I know that he is tall,
  and brave, and handsome."</p>

  <p>"He is, dear," Lenore answered between her tears.</p>

  <p>"I wonder why he has done it all," Emilie went on. "Do you know, Lennie, I
  think he must like you a little."</p>

  <p>Lenore was pale no longer, but she turned her head away.</p>

  <p>"Hush, Emilie," she said softly. "We must not think of him like that. He
  is a great nobleman's son, and we"</p>

  <p>"I don't care," Emilie continued; "nobody is good enough for you."</p>

  <p>And that night Herbert Crawford walked down to Knightsbridge under the
  stars, feeling like a man who had taken the first step in a new world. For
  the first time he saw, and saw clearly, wherein lay all the sweetness and
  happiness of life. The old life, with its false ideals, its false philosophy,
  and, alas! its many weaknesses, lay behind him like an evil nightmare. The
  good which he had done that day was as nothing compared to the good which he
  had received.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The triumph of a great singer is as the triumph of a queen.
  A new star had burst upon the world, and London was raving about her. And on
  the morning after her great success Captain Crawford sat in her drawing-room,
  the most envied man in town, because he alone was always sure of a welcome
  from her. She came in to him very soon, a little pale after the last night's
  excitement, but with her piquant delicate beauty wonderfully enhanced by the
  success of the last twelve months. She held out her hand to him with a glad
  smile, and he did not immediately release it.</p>

  <p>"I did not come round to you last night. I thought you would be too
  tired," he said. "You got my note?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and the flowers," she answered warmly. "It was kind of you. But you
  are always kind."</p>

  <p>"Can one help being kind when one loves?" he answered, with sudden
  passion. "Lenore, Lenore, you are all the world to me. I have loved you
  always. Darling, will you be my wife?"</p>

  <p>For the first time in his life he took her into his arms, and his lips
  touched her forehead. Then he drew away from her, and looked into her face.
  It was deadly pale, and half-hidden in her hands.</p>

  <p>"Lenore," he cried hoarsely. "Tell me what is the matter? Is it that you
  cannot care for me?" She looked up, and he was dumb before the agony in her
  white face.</p>

  <p>"I cannot marry you," she said slowly. "I will not. No, listen. Who am I?
  A singer, and that is all. I have no name even, no father, or money.
  Everything I have I owe to you. I will not marry you. You must marry one of
  your own order&mdash; some rich and noble woman. No, I will not marry
  you."</p>

  <p>"Lenore, that is all nothing," he said softly. "I love you. No other woman
  would make me happy, my darling!"</p>

  <p>She kept him away from her.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she said, "would your father consent?"</p>

  <p>To her he would not lie.</p>

  <p>"Not now," he answered. "He would some day. What does it matter? I love
  you."</p>

  <p>"Herbert," she said softly, "you have been the truest, the noblest friend
  a lonely woman ever had. I did not think that such men lived. Now, listen, I
  will not marry you; it would not be fitting; it would ruin your life. I will
  not marry you."</p>

  <p>"There is some one else," he cried, with a sudden dread.</p>

  <p>She shrank back as though he had struck her. Then she looked up at him
  with quivering lips.</p>

  <p>"That is the first cruel thing you have ever said to me, and God knows
  that it is false," she said. "My life belongs to Emilie. I will marry no one
  else. At least, I promise you that. Will you please go away?"</p>

  <p>Then, without a word, he took up his hat, and for the first time in his
  life he left her in anger.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Lord St. Maurice lay dying in his great castle in the north,
  and by his bedside, still enveloped in his travelling coat, Captain Crawford
  was standing. They were alone, though doctors and nurses were close at hand.
  Relations there were none, save his nephew, for Lord St. Maurice had lived in
  solitude for many years, a worn-out, hardened cynic. The lights were dim, and
  the old man's life was ebbing fast away. Captain Crawford had been only just
  in time.</p>

  <p>"Herbert," he whispered hoarsely, "I have deceived you; deceived
  everybody. My boy, I have daughters alive. I have left them my money. It is
  only justice."</p>

  <p>It was a great shock, but he bore it well. Over and over again had this
  old man, who hated his father and hated his elder brother, told him that,
  save the title and lands of the marquisate, all would be his. He had been
  brought up for it. Besides it he had nothing.</p>

  <p>"Where are they&mdash;your daughters?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I do not know. If they are dead all will be yours. I married, twenty-two
  years ago, a lady of France. She died. I kept the secret of our marriage. We
  had two daughters. I placed them with a notary of high repute, with ample
  means, and I made him swear that he would keep the secret of their birth till
  I sent for them. I sent for them. The notary had absconded, bankrupt; my
  daughters have gone&mdash;no one knows where. Find them, Herbert. I have
  twenty thou&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was obliged to stop struggling for breath. Captain Crawford was
  trembling. He drew a locket from his neck and opened it.</p>

  <p>"Do you know the face?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The old man looked, and gave a great cry.</p>

  <p>"It is my wife, Lenore!"</p>

  <p>Captain Crawford shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is your daughter, Lenore."</p>

  <p>Lord St. Maurice fell back upon the pillow, and gave a little gasp. He was
  dead.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Again he stood in her little drawing-room, in deep mourning,
  and with a very serious face. When she came in she was frightened.</p>

  <p>"What has happened, Herbert?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Lenore, I have found your father," he said, gravely.</p>

  <p>"Is he alive?"</p>

  <p>"I have come from his death-bed."</p>

  <p>She sat down trembling, and speechless.</p>

  <p>"Lenore, your father is dead, and you must think well of him. He left you,
  as he thought, well provided for. His last thoughts were of you."</p>

  <p>"Who was he?"</p>

  <p>"My uncle, the Marquis of St. Maurice. We are cousins, Lenore."</p>

  <p>"Your uncle! Your uncle! The one who was to leave you all his money?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; only he has done better with it. You and Emilie are the greatest
  heiresses in England, and I am your guardian."</p>

  <p>"Have you not always been that?" she sobbed. "We do not want the money. We
  will not have it."</p>

  <p>"But you must," he answered gently. "He was your father."</p>

  <p>"Herbert," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"We will only have it on one condition."</p>

  <p>"And that is?"</p>

  <p>She looked up at him with a curious look in her face.</p>

  <p>"Cannot you guess?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head."</p>

  <p>"Please, will you marry me?"</p>

  <p>He took her into his arms, and she hid her face upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure, quite sure, that you care for me?" he asked
  rapturously.</p>

  <p>"You silly, silly boy," she answered. "Could you not see that I loved you
  heart and soul from that first night? How blind men are!"</p>

  <p>So Captain Crawford married an heiress, and the world lost a great singer.
  And Emilie was almost as happy as they.</p>

  <h4>ILLUSTRATED BY A. FORESTIER</h4>

        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">ON'T hurry, Charlie. I want you for a minute or two. The
  billiard match can wait."</p>

  <p class="first">Rather reluctantly I resumed my seat, and refilled my glass.
  <i>Tête-à-têtes</i> with my uncle after dinner were wont to be somewhat
  wearisome, and my saucy little cousin's challenge, as I had held the door
  open for her a moment before, was decidedly more tempting. Still, was not my
  uncle also my guardian and a Cabinet Minister, and was not I Ins paid
  secretary? And there being no alternative save compliance, I obeyed and
  waited in silence, mildly wondering whether anything had happened in the
  House that afternoon which he purposed to communicate to me, or whether I was
  doomed to an hour or two's somewhat prosy meanderings about things in
  general.</p>

  <p>An unusually long silence rather stimulated my curiosity. Something must
  have happened, I concluded, noting my uncle's thoughtful countenance, and I
  hinted at my growing curiosity by a gentle cough.</p>

  <p>My uncle rose to the hint. "Charlie," he said abruptly, "could you go
  abroad to-morrow&mdash;to Rome?"</p>

  <p>I stared at him in amazement, with my glass suspended midway between the
  table and my lips. Go to Rome to-morrow, with the London season at its
  height! What could the old buffer mean?</p>

  <p>"Rome!" I repeated feebly, setting my glass down, and inserting the wrong
  end of my cigar between my teeth. "Ugh. D&mdash;. I beg your pardon.
  Certainly I could, if it were necessary."</p>

  <p>My uncle bit his lip, but, leaning over the table towards me, went on
  seriously, "Take another cigar, and listen to me. I have been with Dash this
  afternoon, and he agrees with me that some one must leave tomorrow for Rome
  with most important dispatches for Sir Henry Odell. I mentioned your
  name&mdash;recommended you, in fact. Dash had no objection, so long as I
  vouched for your discretion, which I ventured to do. But remember, Charlie,
  the matter is an extremely important one, and we do not care for even the
  barest rumour of your mission to get about. And there must not be a second's
  delay. You must travel night and day until you reach Rome. A good deal hangs
  upon your zeal and discretion in this matter, and, unimportant though your
  part in it may be, do it well, and it will be a start for you."</p>

  <p>Needless to say I was delighted with the mission, and swore to myself and
  to my uncle that I would be as discreet as Disraeli, and as swift as
  steamboat and express trains would allow me. Another thought, too, filled me
  with pleasurable anticipations of my coming journey. For had not Sir Henry
  Odell, grizzled old baronet, carried away from me my first sweetheart, pretty
  Nellie Aveland, the rector's only daughter down at Whilton, my old home, and
  had I not often wished to see her again? Poor little Nellie! Could I even
  forget her, as in our last stolen interview she had flung her little white
  arms around my neck, and with her large, innocent blue eyes filled with
  tears, had sobbed out that, though her parents insisted upon her marriage
  with the old baronet, her heart was always mine? How delightful to think that
  I should see her again so soon!</p>

  <p>At noon on the following morning I was on the platform at Charing Cross,
  with a small portmanteau in my hand, my sole luggage, and in due course I
  crossed the channel, journeyed through the mighty tunnel, and found myself
  careering down through Italy, within a few hours of my destination. At
  L&mdash;&mdash;there was a brief halt for refreshments, and carrying with me
  my portmanteau (I knew too much of railway travelling in Italy to leave it in
  the carriage), I formed one of the mob of hungry and thirsty travellers who
  besieged the refreshment rooms.</p>

  <p>At the door of the room I had a great surprise. I caught sight of a figure
  which struck me at once as being familiar, and my heart gave a sudden leap,
  half of astonishment, half of pleasure, for when I reached the entrance I
  stood face to face with Nellie.</p>

  <p>"Lady Odell!" I exclaimed, and, with a violent start, she turned round and
  recognized me.</p>

  <p>"Charlie!" and the look in her eyes, as well as her tone, fulfilled my
  most sanguine expectations. I was not forgotten.</p>

  <p>"You here?" she went on in astonishment; "and carrying your own luggage
  too, like a veritable Cook's tourist! Where on earth are you going to?"</p>

  <p>"To Rome. And you?"</p>

  <p>"Also to Rome." She had gone to L&mdash;&mdash; to see an old
  school-fellow off to England, and was alone, except for her maid. She was
  waiting for a parcel&mdash;a letter in fact &mdash;which she had promised to
  deliver for her friend in Rome, and could not leave till the next train. It
  was only an hour's delay, and it was a faster train. Of course I would wait
  for her?</p>

  <p>I hesitated, and alas! yielded. An hour could make no difference, and,
  besides, it would be too late to see Sir Henry that night. Yes, I would wait,
  and, amid a shower of eager questions, I watched the train glide off to Rome
  without me.</p>

  <p>We stood talking for about half an hour, and then she stopped a porter and
  asked a question. She appeared perplexed at his reply; he repeated it, and
  passed on, and she looked up at me with a gesture of annoyance. She had been
  misinformed. There was no other train to Rome until 6.30 in the morning.
  Whatever should we do? and she looked up half-piteously, half-comically.</p>

  <p>My first impulse was one of decided anger, and a very British oath escaped
  through my teeth. But how could I be angry with her? And, after all, it could
  make no real difference. I had travelled all the way without an hour's real
  repose, and a night's sleep would do me no harm; and so I determined to make
  the best of it, and console my companion in misfortune, consolation which she
  needed very little, however, and indeed, somewhat to my surprise, she seemed
  inclined to regard the contretemps as a capital joke. There was but one
  decent hotel in the place, we learnt, and there I proposed leaving her and
  her maid, while I sought quarters elsewhere. But to this she strongly
  objected.</p>

  <p>"You silly goose, Charlie," she laughed; "we are not in England, you know,
  and you forget I have Hannah here with me. There isn't the least necessity
  for you to run away, unless you want to."</p>

  <p>Needless to say, I did not run away. We dined alone, and lingered long
  over the meal, and until late in the evening, full of reminiscences of our
  childhood and barely veiled allusions to that other period of our life, and
  even that parting in the old rectory garden. We lived the old days over
  again, and never in those times had I found Nellie Aveland so fascinating and
  bewitching as Lady Odell now was. She seemed scarcely changed at all, except
  that her figure was improved and her face just a trifle thinner and paler.
  But her tones had never been more tender or her manner more captivating, and
  I began to fear that unless I was very careful indeed I should make a fool of
  myself, for Lady Odell was fully as attractive to me now as had been Nellie
  Aveland in the not very distant past. After a while our conversation
  gradually drifted into things of the present, and with some little importance
  in my tone I told her of my mission to her husband. She laughed merrily, and
  clapped her hands.</p>

  <p>"Fancy you, Charlie, a special envoy! Do let me look at your
  dispatches!"</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "Quite impossible!" I declared, in an official tone as
  near as possible a counterpart of my worthy uncle's.</p>

  <p>She fairly screamed with laughing.</p>

  <p>"Why, Charlie, I don't believe you've got any!" she cried. "You're only
  hoaxing me. Why, you couldn't get a dispatch box in that little
  portmanteau!"</p>

  <p>I undid the strap, and held out a long black ebony case with silver knobs
  at each end.</p>

  <p><a id="pic23"
     name="pic23"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>
  <br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1203441h-images/FTQ14-2.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>"What a funny box for dispatches, Charlie!"</p>

  <p>"They're generally used at the F.O. now," I replied carelessly.</p>

  <p>This was a most atrocious fib. The fact was, my dispatches consisting only
  of one short letter, I had not been provided with a dispatch-box. The long
  black case was the exact facsimile of one in which I generally kept my
  shaving implements, and which was now reposing at the bottom of my
  portmanteau. I had bought the pair at a shop in Bond Street only a week or
  two before meaning to present them to my cousin for glove-boxes, but for some
  reason or other never did so. The one came in so nicely for my shaving
  things, and the other had caught my eye when glancing around for something in
  which to keep my precious document, and, attracted by its official-looking
  appearance, I had utilized it for that purpose.</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether there is anything important in that letter," she
  remarked meditatively, after a short pause. "Nothing to call us back to
  England, I hope, Charlie; I hate England!"</p>

  <p>I expressed my total ignorance of the contents of the letter.</p>

  <p>"You could not expect me to divulge them even to you, Nellie," I added
  somewhat reprovingly, but she was silent.</p>

  <p>It was very late before we said good-night, but at last Nellie rang for
  her maid and left me.</p>

  <p>"Shall Hannah see about your bag being sent up?" she asked carelessly, as
  she rose to go.</p>

  <p>"No thanks. When will you remember, Nellie, that a special envoy never
  lets his dispatches out of his sight?" I added laughing.</p>

  <p>"Well, just as you like," she said. "Good-night."</p>

  <p>It was not long before I also retired; but not feeling in the least
  sleepy, and finding a very comfortable lounge in my room, I lit a cigar and
  sat up for a while. The hotel seemed quite quiet; apparently everybody else
  had long ago retired. I was rather startled, therefore, when all of a sudden
  I heard a light footstep pass along the corridor and halt outside my room. I
  listened for a moment, and then, without quitting my position, shouted out,
  "Who's there?" No answer, no sound of retreating footsteps. Very strange, I
  thought, and, moving across the room, opened my door and looked out. Not a
  soul was in sight. I shut my door and very soon dismissed the circumstance
  from my mind. Some one, no doubt, retiring late had lost his way, and had
  paused to read the number over my door, and as I was beginning to feel
  sleepy, I slowly undressed and got into bed, and very soon was fast asleep.
  Scarcely half an hour could have passed when I awoke with a slight start, and
  an indefinable sense of something being wrong. The moment I opened my eyes
  and looked around I saw to what I owed my awakening.</p>

  <p><a id="pic24"

  <img src="1203441h-images/FTQ14-3.png"
        style="margin-left:20%; float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">The door of the room stood wide open and a woman was
  standing just inside, with her back to me, holding a shaded lamp in her hand.
  My first impulse, and I very nearly yielded to it, was to jump out of bed; my
  next to lie quite still, and watch the figure through half-closed eyes. She
  was standing nearly in the middle of the room, looking eagerly around, and
  with a start, which very nearly betrayed me, I recognized Nellie, with a
  white, scared look on her face. I could scarcely believe that it was not a
  dream, but I held my breath and waited. Suddenly she seemed to discover the
  whereabouts of what she sought, and with a rapid, gliding movement, she drew
  near the dressing-table and caught up a long black case which lay there. She
  tried to open it, but it was locked. Then she secreted it in her dress, and
  turning rapidly round&mdash;so rapidly that I only just had time to close my
  eyes&mdash;she glided softly out of the room and shut the door.</p>

  <p>I sat up in bed and held my head in a maze of bewilderment. Then the thing
  grew clear to me, and I smiled as I felt under my pillow and drew out my
  dispatch box with the precious letter inside. Of course, I could see how it
  was now. Nellie had always been an inveterate practical joker, and she had no
  doubt hit upon the idea of making off with my dispatches, and herself
  conveying them to her husband. But I shouted with laughing, until the old bed
  grew creaky, and the shaky mahogany poles rattled, as I reflected that she
  had made off with my razor-case, and as it was locked she would not, in all
  probability, discover the mistake until she presented it to Sir Henry. Sleep
  now was out of the question, so I arose, smoked another cigar, read for
  awhile in the grey dawn, and then made an elaborate <i>toilette</i>, minus
  the shave, and descended into the breakfast room. As I expected,
  "<i>madame</i>" had left by the early train, and there was a note for me. I
  tore it open.</p>

  <p class="letter">Dear Charlie,&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">I think, perhaps, that I had better not be seen travelling
  in Rome with you alone, at such an unearthly hour, so I am going on by the
  early train. How I envy you in the express; you will reach Rome only half an
  hour later. Shall see you this afternoon, I suppose.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours,<br>
  Nellie.</p>

  <p>I smiled; nay, I laughed many times during the consumption of my matutinal
  meal to the great surprise of the waiter, who seemed astonished to see an
  <i>Anglais</i> milord indulge in such unseemly, and, apparently, causeless
  mirth. In due course I arrived in Rome, and drove straight to the Embassy.
  Business first, I thought, and presented my letter, rather surprised that Sir
  Henry did not greet me with a burst of merriment. He was very courteous,
  though, and affable; but as I watched him read, although he had never been a
  friend of mine, I was greatly grieved to see how bowed down and ill he
  looked, and an idea which had occurred to me, that this letter concerned his
  resignation, was confirmed. He read it through slowly, and then folded it
  up.</p>

  <p>"Has Lady Odell returned?" I burst out.</p>

  <p>To my astonishment, Sir Henry, drew himself up and flashed a haughty
  glance upon me.</p>

  <p>"Sir?" he said, in a tone of stern interrogation.</p>

  <p>I stammered, and then hastened to explain, but my tale seemed very little
  to amuse him.</p>

  <p>"You have had a very narrow escape, sir," he said quietly. "Lady Odell
  left me a fortnight ago."</p>

  <p>"Left you?" I repeated, in an idiotic manner.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he went on, in a low tone and with averted head; "her conduct has
  repeatedly been a source of annoyance to me, and, recently, has been such as
  to make her the talk of Rome. A fortnight ago she left me. Rumour asserts
  that she is&mdash;is under the protection of a certain Signor Tubelli, the
  Secretary for Foreign Affairs here. I have taken the necessary steps to
  procure a divorce. You have had a very narrow escape, sir; Tubelli is a
  dangerous man, and would give much to learn the contents of this letter," and
  he touched it lightly with his forefinger. "Let us change the subject."</p>

  <p>I left Rome the next day on very good terms with Sir Henry, but Nellie I
  did not meet again, I wonder whether Signor Tubelli uses my razors.</p>

     name="story15">XV.&mdash;SOMETHING IN A NAME</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of magazine publication found</h3>

  <p class="first">I THINK her very charming indeed!" declared Major
  Cunningham, thoughtfully stroking his moustache. "So delightfully
  unsophisticated and girlish!"</p>

  <p>"H'm! A season in town would improve her," replied his aunt; "she is
  rather gauche."</p>

  <p>"A season in town, on the contrary, would probably spoil her. It is that
  very gaucherie, as you term it, that pleases me most. I admire Miss Hunt
  exceedingly." And the major strolled away to give his arm to the young lady
  in question, who had just risen from the piano.</p>

  <p>She was only a girl, just escaped from the schoolroom&mdash;the daughter
  of a country squire, whose little circle of life had been bounded by a few
  calls paid and returned, one or two tennis-parties, a single dinner party,
  and this fortnight which she was spending at a country house.</p>

  <p>No wonder that her hostess, Lady Mary Allthrop, a woman of the world, and
  a leader of society, observed in her guest what to her town-bred instincts
  appeared to be gaucherie, but which her nephew, Major Cunningham, looked upon
  with a far different and more indulgent aspect. He had told his aunt and
  hostess that he thought her charming, and she was charming.</p>

  <p>She was not only beautiful, but her expression and manners were winning,
  and her large grey eyes almost perfect. True, her immature figure was the
  figure of a girl, and at times her shyness was easily apparent 5 but these
  were trifles which he readily pardoned. The latter, indeed, he found
  attractive. And if he admired her, what did she think of him? She was given
  to hero-worship, and he possessed all the qualities to inspire it. He had
  distinguished himself in a recent campaign. He was tall, with well-knit,
  stalwart frame, and handsome face, bronzed by exposure to the Eastern suns,
  for his had been no toy soldiering.</p>

  <p>He had seen much life, had travelled far, was rich, and heir to a title;
  and, withal, it was whispered he was a woman-hater. Could there be stronger
  attributes to attract her fancy?</p>

  <p>All that first evening of her visit to Roughton Manor she watched him with
  interest. She listened eagerly to his monosyllabic conversation at the dinner
  table, and she detected with a smile his air of relief when her hostess rose,
  and the ladies followed her out of the room.</p>

  <p>Later on she watched him furtively in the drawing room, the last to
  appear, listening with forced interest and bored expression to the gushing
  conversation of one of the daughters of the house. Roughton Manor was a
  country house of a somewhat free-and-easy type, and with the additional
  licence of Christmas-time there was every opportunity for indulging in
  flirtations more or less pronounced. But Major Cunningham did not seem
  disposed to avail himself of his opportunities although more than one pair of
  bright eyes challenged him temptingly, and more than one pair of ruby lips
  seemed disposed to take the initiative. He was courteous, and even agreeable,
  but cold, and appeared to find more pleasure in talking to deaf old Professor
  Hutchinson than in bandying words with younger guests. Once she&mdash;May
  Hunt &mdash;caught his eye fixed upon her, and, despite her efforts, she
  blushed. She was fair and beautiful, with almost an ethereal beauty, and she
  had admirers in plenty. But she also was reserved and silent, and gave them
  no encouragement; so one by one they voted her shy, or stupid, or both, and
  left her alone, to her great satisfaction.</p>

  <p>There was an impromptu dance later on in the evening, but she danced
  little, and he not at all. She was surprised, therefore, and unaccountably
  nervous when he suddenly left his seat, and, whispering to Lady Mary, crossed
  the room towards her with his aunt on his arm.</p>

  <p>"My nephew, Major Cunningham&mdash;Miss Hunt."</p>

  <p>And, the formal words of introduction spoken, she left them together, and
  passed on to speak to others of the guests. He bowed gravely, and begged for
  the pleasure of a dance. Of course she assented, and, of course, she danced
  with him again, sat out dances with him, and spent the whole evening, and
  many succeeding ones, in a whirl of delicious excitement.</p>

  <p>He was attracted by her shyness, which repelled others. He took pains to
  penetrate beneath the surface, and was no whit surprised to find her both
  charming and intelligent, although strangely naive and girlish, and he was
  amused and not a little flattered by her only half-concealed reverence for
  him.</p>

  <p>The sequence was a natural one, and needs no explanation. He lost his
  heart, received another in exchange, and when the fortnight's visit was up
  they were engaged.</p>

  <p>His had been a stern, joyless life, full of hardships in his early youth,
  the remembrance of which seemed to have embittered in some measure his later
  life. But in her love he seemed suddenly to find relief and happiness. With
  her his severity and gravity vanished, and none could have been more kind and
  tender; and, withal, the change made him appear, as every one remarked, ten
  years younger.</p>

  <p>And how he loved her! Not with the passionate ardour of youth, but with
  the full, deep, unchangeable love of a man of strong will and principles. It
  was the first love of his life, for women before had never attracted him. He
  had looked upon them as something outside his life, playthings for younger
  men of more susceptible mould; and the idea that he himself would some day
  find consolation and happiness at a woman's hands he would have deemed
  ridiculous.</p>

  <p>But so it was; and fervently he blessed the chance which had led him down
  to spend Christmas at Roughton Manor, for May's love had changed the whole
  tenor of his life, and made the world a different place for him.</p>

  <p>His whole nature was softened, and by rapid degrees his manners changed
  from the hard sternness of a reserved and unhappy man to the genial
  pleasantness of a happy and contented disposition. He seemed to be commencing
  life anew, and his friends were never tired of congratulating him on his
  changed appearance and manners.</p>

  <p>There were no difficulties in the way of their engagement, and he was
  eager that it should be a short one, and, indeed, that they should be married
  almost at once. But Mr. Hunt urged otherwise, pointing out his daughter's
  extreme youth.</p>

  <p>"A year's waiting will do neither of you any harm, Hugh," he urged; "and
  besides, May will be stronger then. You can wait a year, surely?"</p>

  <p>"But you don't consider her really delicate?" Major Cunningham asked
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Not she," Mr. Hunt assured him encouragingly. "Outgrown herself a little,
  that's all. She'll be a different girl in a year's time."</p>

  <p>And so it was arranged. Major Cunningham was to spend the rest of his time
  with the Hunts, and then return to his regiment for a month or two
  preparatory to sending in his papers and selling out, for Mr. Hunt insisted
  that he should do so before his marriage, and he himself had no wish to do
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>Happily the days passed by for both of them, he revelling in his new-found
  happiness, and she none less happy in his love. And then came the first
  cloud. His leave was suddenly shortened, and his regiment ordered to
  Burmah.</p>

  <p>It was a great trial; but he was a soldier first and a lover afterwards,
  and he never dreamt of evading the trouble by exchanging or selling out.</p>

  <p>"My last campaign," he whispered to her on the night before his departure,
  "and soon over, I trust. And when I get back home again I shall expect to see
  you quite well and strong, darling," he added tenderly.</p>

  <p>She smiled at his anxiety through her tears.</p>

  <p>"I shall be all right, Hugh dear. But just fancy, if anything were to
  happen to you in that horrid Burmah "And she shuddered.</p>

  <p>He laughed, and shook his head. Then he said, in a somewhat graver
  tone:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We can never tell what may happen, but I don't think there's much fear.
  Those beggars will have to knock under. I shouldn't wonder if the fighting
  wasn't all over by the time we get there." No: he could not tell what was
  going to happen, or he would never have left England. As it was he went, and
  after a weary voyage landed with his regiment at Rangoon.</p>

  <p>In the very first skirmish he was wounded in the arm by a Burmese spear,
  and his campaign was over. His arm was perfectly useless, so, after a weary
  time in the hospital, he was put on the invalided list and shipped off to
  England.</p>

  <p>The change and the sea-breeze soon set him up again, and by the time the
  Mediterranean was reached his health was almost restored, although he was
  compelled to keep his arm in a sling.</p>

  <p>He had received but few letters from England, as indeed there had been no
  time; but those which he had received from the Hunts had seemed to him to
  dwell strangely on May's increasing delicacy, and had even hinted at the
  possibility of having to remove her to a warmer climate.</p>

  <p>But May in her letters had made light of her rumoured illness, and
  declared that she felt well and strong. Still, though he comforted himself
  with her assurances, he was nervously anxious to reach England, and see for
  himself whether there was any ground for her parents' fears.</p>

  <p>In due course the long voyage came to an end, and, with scarcely an hour's
  delay in London, he travelled down to Calton Hall. Mr. Hunt was at the little
  station to meet him, and welcomed him heartily.</p>

  <p>"And May, how is she?" was almost the first question Major Cunningham
  asked, as they walked down the narrow platform together.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hunt looked very grave.</p>

  <p>"We fear that she is getting no better," he said with a sigh; "but she
  persists in saying otherwise. Anyhow, I've made up my mind to have Jenner
  down and know the worst&mdash;though I hope that won't be very bad," he
  added, with an attempt at cheerfulness, as he saw the sudden pallor in the
  other's face, and caught a half-smothered ejaculation. "You are scarcely
  strong yourself yet, Cunningham ," he said kindly, passing his arm through
  his companion's, and leading him out of the station. "Was it wise to hurry
  down like this, do you think?"</p>

  <p>"I could not rest until I had seen her," was the reply, and then in
  silence they were driven through the country lanes to Calton Hall.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Hunt was in the hall to welcome her future son-in-law; but he was too
  impatient to pay much attention to her voluble greetings.</p>

  <p>"Where is she?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"In the morning-room. She is expecting you."</p>

  <p>And Mrs. Hunt threw open the door, and, closing it with a sigh, left them
  together.</p>

  <p>She was reclining on a couch; but as he entered she half rose and
  stretched out her arms.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Hugh! Thank God you have come!"</p>

  <p>And in a moment he was by her side on his knees, and her arms were round
  his neck.</p>

  <p>In those first few minutes of exquisite joy he forgot his fears; but after
  a while he drew back a little to survey her more closely, and a strange
  anxiety filled him as he watched her hollow cheeks, flushed with a delicate
  streak of colour, her large grey eyes unnaturally brilliant, and noticed,
  too, how thin she was and fragile-looking&mdash;far more so than when he had
  left her.</p>

  <p>"My darling, you have been ill!" he exclaimed anxiously, striving hard to
  keep from his tones and his expression the nervous dread which was filling
  him as he realized her altered appearance.</p>

  <p>She smiled&mdash;a faint, wintry smile, though.</p>

  <p>"I have not been very ill, Hugh, but I shall soon be all right now that
  you are come back." And the little white hand, with its long thin fingers,
  stole softly into his, and, while he smoothed it gently between his own, and
  caught the pleading look in her eyes, he had hard work to bear himself like a
  man.</p>

  <p>"I hope so," he murmured with passionate earnestness; and he bent close
  over the imprisoned hand that she might not see the glistening in his eyes.
  "I hope to God you will!" And then he forced himself to talk more cheerfully;
  but it was with a heavy heart that he left her.</p>

  <p>The great physician from London came down and examined his patient; but he
  either would not or could not pronounce a decided opinion.</p>

  <p>"Take her to the South of France at once, and keep her there," he said.
  "She will need the greatest care."</p>

  <p>"But she will recover?" asked Mr. Hunt anxiously.</p>

  <p>The great man hesitated. "There is danger," he admitted " and where there
  is danger one should always be prepared for the worst. Your daughter may die,
  and she may live; but she certainly will not live in this climate." And with
  this scanty consolation he pocketed the cheque, and was driven off to catch
  the express back to town.</p>

  <p>To the South of France they went, all four&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Hunt and
  their daughter and Major Cunningham. A skilled nurse was in attendance, but
  her labours and care were nothing to the major's. Night and day he passed by
  May's bedside, reading, talking cheerfully to her, or sitting by her side in
  a silence more eloquent than words, holding her hand in his, and trying hard
  to look smiling and happy, and to banish the misery and anxiety from his
  careworn face.</p>

  <p>Mother and father, loving and tender though they were, could not do for
  her what he did. He never left her, save for a minute or two at a time to
  ransack the shops of the little French town for fruit, flowers, or anything
  which he thought would tempt the invalid's fancy; and, hurrying back to her
  side, he thought himself amply repaid by one sad, sweet smile from her wasted
  face.</p>

  <p>Such devotion awed father and mother, and tacitly they seemed to recognize
  his right to watch over her, and keep the place by her side; and even in the
  midst of their own sorrow they trembled when they thought what would come to
  him when the time for inevitable separation arrived; for it was
  inevitable.</p>

  <p>Not all the balmy breezes of the southern sea, nor the skilled physician
  who attended her, nor his devotion who watched over her, could do more than
  prolong for a little while the evil day; and it came at last.</p>

  <p>It was Christmas-time; but at Nice there was little in the surroundings to
  show it. Her couch had been drawn up by loving hands to the open window, and
  her eyes, tired with the monotony of the room, could rest upon the blue
  Mediterranean, stretching away in front, and the hosts of tiny white sails
  gently gliding over its placid surface, and here and there on the verge of
  the horizon the long, thin streak of black smoke which betokened a passing
  steamer.</p>

  <p>Every now and then the laughter of joyous conversation of the crowds on
  the promenade below was borne to their ears by the soft breeze, in strange
  discord to the feelings of both of them, for there were tears in his eyes,
  and a pained look on her thin, white face.</p>

  <p>"Don't, Hugh!" she whispered pleadingly, pressing his hand with a feeble
  pressure; and he forced a smile as he turned and bent over her, watching her
  with a tender, yearning look the while he rearranged the shawl and eased her
  pillows.</p>

  <p>Soon after then the end came. A slight but sudden change in her face
  alarmed him, and hastily he dispatched the nurse for Mr. and Mrs. Hunt.</p>

  <p>He was on his knees by her side, bending over her with awe-struck face,
  and, without moving his eyes towards them, held up his hand as the door
  opened.</p>

  <p>"The doctor!" he muttered hoarsely; and the doctor, never far away, was
  speedily summoned. No one dared speak. Her mother took one hand, and the
  other he still retained; and her face was turned towards him. Suddenly she
  cried out:</p>

  <p>"Hugh, Hugh! Lift me up! quick!" And, folding his arms around her, he
  lifted her to a sitting posture.</p>

  <p>"Christmas Day!" she whispered softly. "Our first Christmas, Hugh, and our
  last!" she added sadly, after a short pause.</p>

  <p>"Hold me tighter, Hugh!" And with a great lump in his throat, and his
  breath coming quickly, the tall soldier stooped down and drew her closer to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Kiss me!" she whispered, turning half round.</p>

  <p>And mother and father, weeping bitterly, in turn bent over and kissed her;
  but, though her head was turned towards them, she still clung to him.</p>

  <p>"Now, Hugh," she whispered. And with a sob which shook his strong frame
  he, too, kissed her.</p>

  <p>"Don't tremble so!" she murmured, with a faint attempt at a smile, and her
  eyes fixed lovingly upon him. "We shall meet again some time, some day. How
  good you have been to me, Hugh! Good-bye!"</p>

  <p>And then, after a brief silence, a strange look flitted across her face,
  and with a groan he laid her reverently down, for in his arms her spirit had
  passed away.</p>

  <p>None saw him again until the funeral; and then he came forth from his room
  like a ghost, and mechanically took part in the dismal ceremony.</p>

  <p>Mother and father, sorrow-stricken though they were, felt their own grief
  eclipsed by the dull agony in that white, drawn face; but they scarcely dared
  to speak to him, and, pitying greatly, they left him alone, making no vain
  attempts at consolation. They travelled together as far as London, and there
  they parted.</p>

  <p>"Try and bear up, Cunningham," said Mr. Hunt, as they stood together at
  Charing Cross station. "Come down home with us, and be quiet for a time. You
  need a rest." But he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I must go back to my regiment," he said. "Good-bye."</p>

  <p>"You will come and see us when you return to England?" begged Mrs. Hunt,
  with tears in her eyes. He shook his head again.</p>

  <p>"You are very good, but I shall never return to England," he said sadly.
  And, looking at his shrunken form and hopeless bearing, they felt that his
  words were surely true; and so, in sorrow and with heavy hearts, they bade
  him <i>adieu</i>.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Christmas Day in a fine, old country mansion in the north of
  England, and such a Christmas Day! For to all the joys and pleasures of the
  holiday season was added another joy which was sufficient of itself to plunge
  every occupant of the Hall, and every inhabitant of the little village, into
  a very fever of excitement and anticipation.</p>

  <p>They knew little about soldiering, these simple country folks, and had
  heard very little indeed about the war in "furrin parts"; but they knew that
  young Tom Carlyon, the squire's youngest son, was back from his first
  campaign just in time to spend Christmas Day at home, and man and boy, woman
  and child, they all turned out and cheered him lustily as the dogcart which
  brought him from the wayside station passed by their cottages and turned in
  at the Hall gates.</p>

  <p>And why not, indeed? Had they not known him from earliest
  childhood&mdash;this tall, boyish-looking young officer? And was he not a
  universal favourite with them all, young and old?</p>

  <p>"Hurrah for Mr. Tom!" And the sturdy villagers would have stopped his
  carriage and insisted upon a sturdy grip of the hand, which they knew would
  not be refused, but that their womenkind reminded them that there were those
  at the Hall, eagerly waiting, who had the first right to welcome him; and so
  they let him pass unhindered up the broad drive to the Hall, where loving
  voices choked with sobs bade him welcome, and loving arms encircled his
  neck.</p>

  <p>And May Hildyard, she, too, was there, blushing and happy&mdash;as what
  girl would not have been? &mdash; to welcome home her soldier-lover, and to
  read in his ardent gaze that she was unforgotten.</p>

  <p>Such a chorus of welcoming there was; but at last it died away, and things
  went on much as usual, except that no one was spoken to but Tom, and nothing
  talked about but Burmah. Then dinner-time came; and afterwards they all drew
  their chairs round the blazing fire, Tom, between his mother and Bessie,
  still decidedly the hero of the hour.</p>

  <p>"Thank God that my boy is safe!" said Mrs. Carlyon, her hand seeking his
  for a moment. He was her favourite child, and his absence had been terrible
  to her.</p>

  <p>He returned the gentle pressure, and the boyish face grew suddenly grave,
  and the reckless gaiety died out of his tones.</p>

  <p>"Yes, mother," he said quietly, "I am home safe, you see, but I had a very
  narrow escape once, I never cared to mention it in my letters, but I should
  like to tell you all about it now."</p>

  <p>A slight shudder ran through the little circle, for the sudden gravity was
  infectious; and then they pushed their chairs a little closer towards him,
  and leant eagerly forward to hear Tom's tale.</p>

  <p>"It was twelve months ago to-day, mother," he went on, addressing himself
  chiefly to her, "and Frank Pomerill, Major Cunningham (you have heard me
  speak of him), and I had a day's leave for shooting up by the ruby-mines. We
  were only a few miles from the outposts, but somehow we managed to lose our
  way in a Burmese jungle&mdash; nasty sort of places, I can tell you&mdash;and
  when we did get out in the open again it was night, and we were in a bit of a
  fog as to the track.</p>

  <p>"We didn't care about losing our way again&mdash; once was quite
  enough&mdash;and so, rather than run any risk, we picketed our horses, lit a
  fire, and prepared to spend the night. Pomerill was asleep in a minute; he
  was dead beat. But somehow I was restless&mdash;perhaps because it was
  Christmas night, and I was thinking a good deal of you all here&mdash;and
  after a while I got up and, going over to the remains of the fire, drew out
  your photograph, May, and had a good look at it.</p>

  <p>"When I put it in my pocket again and turned round, I found, to my
  surprise, Major Cunningham was wide awake, and watching me. I never told you
  much about Cunningham, did I? Perhaps because none of us knew very much. He
  was one of our best officers, but very severe and reserved, and we youngsters
  were awfully afraid of him, I can tell you.</p>

  <p>"And yet some of the men almost worshipped him, and told no end of tales
  about his kindness to them, and how he used to go and see one of the drummer
  boys who was down with fever, and nurse him himself, while every one else
  gave the tent as wide a berth as possible. There were plenty of tales like
  that about him, but he was so grim and reserved that we scarcely dared to
  speak to him even at lunch.</p>

  <p>"They used to say that he had been engaged to a girl, and she died. If
  that was it, he must have been awfully fond of her, for he seldom smiled, and
  when in action exposed himself with the reckless daring of a man who was
  tired of his life, and sought to throw it away. Well, you can guess the sort
  of man he was; and when I caught him watching me devouring your photograph,
  May, I felt rather dropped upon, I can tell you; but I laughed it off as well
  as I could.</p>

  <p>"'Christmas Day, you know, major,' I said, 'and one can't help thinking a
  little of the people at home.' To my surprise he smiled quite pleasantly, and
  began asking me questions about you all. I was only too glad to have some one
  to talk to, so I chatted away, and he listened, and seemed quite interested
  until I mentioned your name, May.</p>

  <p>"Then his face clouded suddenly over, and I don't think he heard anything
  else. And then it struck me that I had heard somewhere that he had been
  engaged to a May some one or other. Well, I didn't venture to ask him any
  questions, of course; so I shut up, and turning round went off fast to sleep.
  I suppose it must have been quite an hour later when a slight sound aroused
  me, and I sprang up in a fright.</p>

  <p>"Pomerill was snoring like a trooper, but Cunningham had evidently heard
  the sound, whatever it was, and was standing up peering into a semi-darkness.
  In less than a minute we heard it again, a rustling among the bamboos, and a
  subdued murmur of voices, and, turning sharply round, we could dimly see a
  mass of dark, crouching forms, scarcely eighty yards away, with their eyes
  glistening like beads as they stole on their hands and feet nearer to us
  every moment.</p>

  <p>"I kicked Pomerill, and he was on his feet in a twinkling. 'To horse!'
  Cunningham shouted. 'Look alive, Carlyon; the dacoits are upon us!' And we
  made for the animals like a shot. We reached the spot where we had tethered
  them before the dacoits were clear of the jungle; and then my blood ran cold
  for a minute, I can tell you. I hadn't been very careful about tethering my
  mare, and she had made off&mdash;nothing but a broken bridle left. All up
  with me, I thought, as Pomerill vaulted into the saddle; and then I heard
  Cunningham's strong voice at my elbow.</p>

  <p>"'Your mare hasn't gone far,' he said quickly. 'She's round the other side
  of the hillock grazing. Ride mine, and I'll soon catch her.' And he held the
  stirrup out for me and motioned me impatiently to mount.</p>

  <p>"I was in the saddle like a shot; but then I hesitated and looked
  round.</p>

  <p>"'I can't see my mare,' I said, perplexed.</p>

  <p>"'Off you go, and never mind your mare!' he shouted in a voice of thunder.
  'I'll see to her. Be off, sir!' he continued, as a spear from the foremost of
  the dacoits sank quivering into the ground only a few feet from us.</p>

  <p>"'Remember May, and ride for your life! I'm coming round the other way.'
  And, without another word, I bent down in my saddle and galloped away for
  dear life. It was no use looking behind for Cunningham, for there were dozens
  of routes by which he might follow us, and without a doubt he would choose a
  different one to ours.</p>

  <p>"We were nearer to the camp by a good five miles than we had reckoned on,
  and after half an hour's hard galloping we passed the outposts and pulled up.
  The first thing I saw was my mare, tethered by the side of our tent, and
  quietly feeding.</p>

  <p>"'Has any one seen Cunningham?' I cried out, suddenly alarmed. But they
  all shook their heads.</p>

  <p>"'How long has Brown Bess been here?' I asked Duncan, who had just hurried
  up. Duncan was my man then.</p>

  <p>"'About three hours, sir,' he answered. 'Galloped in with a broken bridle
  and no saddle, as if for all the world she'd broken loose from tether. In a
  rare sweat she was, too,' he added.</p>

  <p>"Then I saw it all; and, with a groan, I turned Cunningham's powerful
  chestnut round and galloped straight back again. I scarcely knew how to go
  on," he continued, and his voice faltered and his eyes grew dim. "I was back
  there in half an hour at the most; but it was all over.</p>

  <p>"He was lying on his back at the foot of a giant tree, with his tunic off
  and his shirt literally soaked with blood. The dacoits were all
  gone&mdash;they must have heard me coming, for Pomerill had followed me with
  a skirmishing party&mdash;but they had done their deadly work. He was just
  breathing his last when I leapt off and bent over him.</p>

  <p>"His right hand, stretched out, clenched his sword with such a grip that
  we never got it away, and it was buried with him; the other hand was inside
  his shirt clutching a photograph stained and soaked in his life's blood. His
  eyes opened as he felt my touch, and he tried to smile&mdash;a grim, ghastly
  attempt. He only faltered one word&mdash;a woman's name&mdash;May, and then
  he died without a gasp or struggle. Oh, God, it is awful to think of!"</p>

  <p>And the young man rose and paced the room, while Mrs. Carlyon and May wept
  aloud.</p>

  <p>"He must have fought like a lion," Tom went on, looking up for a moment
  and dashing a suspicious moisture from his eyes, "for around him were the
  bodies of three dacoits, all stone dead, and from the blood on their trail
  there must have been some wounded; but at the moment of his death his
  features relaxed into a quiet smile, as if he had died at peace with the
  world. I never saw him look so happy in life."</p>

  <p>"God bless him!" murmured Mrs.Carlyon through her tears. "But for him I
  should never have had my boy back. God bless him!"</p>

  <p>"Amen!" said Mr. Carlyon solemnly. "He was a hero."</p>

  <p>Years passed on, but Hugh Cunningham was not forgotten. In that happy
  English home there is a golden-haired, prattling youngster named Hugh
  Cunningham Carlyon, who is never tired of telling his youthful and grown-up
  friends of the gallant officer whose name he bears, who gave his life to save
  his father's, who died a fearful death in order that his father might come
  home and marry mamma&mdash;and all because her name was May.</p>

  <p>And so, though he sleeps in a soldier's grave in a far-off country, there
  is one household in England who hold his name in reverence and cherish his
  memory, and who fervently pray that in another world he has found that
  happiness which on earth was taken from him.</p>
