  <h2><a name="ch0"
     id="ch0"></a>INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AMERICAN EDITION.</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was considered an intrepid thing for Walter Besant to do
  when, twelve or thirteen years ago, he invaded the great East End of London
  and drew upon its unknown wealth of varied material to people that most
  charming novel, "All Sorts and Conditions of Men." Until then the West End
  knew little of its contiguous neighbor in the East. Dickens's kaleidoscopic
  views of low life in the South of London were manifestly caricatures of the
  slum specimens of human nature which he purposely sought and often distorted
  to suit his bizarre humor. Mr. Besant may be fairly considered as the pioneer
  of those who have since descended to the great unchartered region of East
  London, about which, so far as our knowledge of the existing conditions of
  human life in that community are concerned, we remained until, as it were
  yesterday, almost as; ignorant as of the undiscovered territories in Central
  Africa. Contemporaneous with Mr. Besant's "discovery" of East London began
  the eastward march of the Salvation Army, which has since honeycombed this
  quarter of the metropolis with its militant camps. Gradually the barriers
  were thrown down, and the East has become accessible to literature and to
  civilization as it never had been to the various Charity and Church
  missionary organizations.</p>

  <p>It was as the secretary of an old Charity Trust that Mr. Arthur Morrison
  first made his acquaintance with East London, and by dint of several years'
  residence and attentive study acquired his knowledge of the East End and its
  myriad denizens. Right in the midst of the great square bounded by the
  Thames, the Lea, the City, Kingsland, and the Hackney open spaces lie the
  dreary "Mean Streets" which Mr. Morrison has described with uncommon power
  and vigor, and among which the operations of his secretaryship engaged him
  laboriously for years. The possibility of presenting his observations of East
  London in narrative form began to grow upon him while casting around for
  literary pabulum to convert into magazine articles, and in October, 1891,;
  appeared his first sketch, entitled "A Street," in "Macmillan's Magazine."
  This, in a remodelled form, now serves as an introductory chapter to the
  present collection. The article in "Macmillan's" attracted a good deal of
  attention, and won for its author the good fellowship of Mr. W. E. Henley,
  who encouraged him in his idea of writing a series of short stories and
  studies which should describe East End life with austerity, restraint, and
  frankness. A large number of the "Tales" appeared in the "National Observer"
  and several followed in the "Pall Mall Budget." The dedication to Mr. Henley
  of "Tales of Mean Streets" is a grateful acknowledgment by the author of the
  kindly and frank counsel of his friendly critic; whose criticism, it may be
  added, has been mainly directed towards the author's craftsmanship&mdash;his
  conceptions of the life he was portraying the critic was wise enough to let
  alone. Mr. Morrison has also been indebted on the side of art in fiction to
  Mr. Walter Besant, whom he met in the East End.</p>

  <p>Mr. Morrison has been fortunate in his literary experience. He is another
  witness to the fact that merit makes its way from the outside, without
  necessarily receiving aid or having ;influence brought to bear on editors or
  publishers. It is curious to note that a manuscript of his which happened to
  be rejected once was accepted on the day following, and now has a place in
  this book. Some cycling verses contributed as a lad to a cycling magazine
  began his literary career, and for some years he continued to write on what
  was then a novel sport. He drifted into broader channels and became a
  frequent contributor to popular papers and magazines. During this period he
  was working on the Charity Commission, and wrote only by way of relaxation.
  About five years ago he resigned his office on the Trust, and, occupying
  chambers near the Strand, joined the editorial staff of an old-established
  evening paper, where for some months he continued to write leaderettes and
  miscellaneous articles and notes until, becoming convinced that he could not
  do justice to such ability for better work which he might possess amidst the
  grinding routine of newspaper scribbling, he gave up his post and applied
  himself to more serious writing, contributing to the "Strand," and other
  magazines and reviews. About this time he began the series which is now
  gathered under the common title "Tales of Mean Streets." On its recent
  ;publication in England it was received with instant recognition as a book of
  extraordinary merit, and it has met with signal success. Some idea of the
  strong impression which it has made in England may be gathered from Mr.
  Arthur Waugh's warm tribute to the author's distinction in a recent letter to
  the "Critic." "He deals exclusively," writes Mr. Waugh, "with life in the
  East End of London, and he does so with a fearlessness and originality which
  are of more value than many sermons. I do not know whether his book is
  published in America; but if so, I strongly advise every reader of this
  letter to secure it. Those who do so will learn from its pages more of the
  degradation and misery of a certain side of London life than they could in
  many weeks of philanthropic 'slumming.' Mr. Morrison's will be a name to
  conjure with in another season."</p>

  <p>Mr. Arthur Morrison is but thirty-one, and has just stepped on to the
  threshold of literary fame as a writer of decided promise and strength. He
  has only broken ground as yet in the field which has brought him his spurs,
  and is at present contemplating a longer story of East End life. The number
  of those who have attempted to write familiarly of the seamy side of our
  great cities; from close observation and laborious study of its life in a
  first-hand fashion is so small that it is easy to believe that the author of
  "Tales of Mean Streets," possessing as he does the prime qualities of a
  novelist, has a future before him in an unprecedented form of literature.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>PREFACE TO THE BONI &amp; LIVERIGHT EDITION</h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER a quarter of a century these brief and searching tales
  of Arthur Morrison's still keep the breath of life in them&mdash;modest but
  precious salvages from the high washings and roarings of the
  eighteen-nineties. The decade&mdash;the last of the Victorian age, as of the
  century&mdash;was so fecund that some Englishman has spread out its record to
  the proportions of a book. It was a time of youngsters, of literary
  rebellions, of adventures in new forms. No great three-decker sailed out of
  it, but what a host there was of smaller craft, rakish and impudent&mdash;the
  first "Jungle Book," the "Dolly Dialogues," "The Second Mrs. Tanqueray," the
  first plays and criticisms of George Bernard Shaw, "Sherlock Holmes," the
  matriculation pieces of H.G. Wells, Jerome K. Jerome, Hewlett, "Dodo" Benson,
  Hichens and so on, and all the best of Gissing and Wilde. Think of the
  novelties of one year only, 1894: "The Green Carnation," "Salome," "The
  Prisoner of Zenda," the "Dolly Dialogues," Gissing's "In the Year of
  Jubilee," the first "Jungle Book," "Arms and the Man," "Round the Red Lamp,"
  and, not least, these "Tales of Mean Streets."</p>

  <p>In the whole lot there was no book or play, save it be Wilde's "Salome,"
  that caused more gabble than the one here printed again, nor was any destined
  to hold its public longer. "The Prisoner of Zenda," chewed to bits on the
  stage, is now almost as dead as Baal; not even the stock companies in the oil
  towns set any store by it. So with "The Green Carnation," "Round the Red
  Lamp," the "Dolly Dialogues," and even "Arms and the Man," and, I am almost
  tempted to add, the "Jungle Book." But "Tales of Mean Streets" is still on
  its legs. People read it, talk about it, ask for it in the book-stores;
  periodically it gets out of print. Well, here it is once more, and perhaps a
  new generation is ready for it, or the older generation&mdash;so young and
  full of fine enthusiasm in 1894!&mdash;will want to read it again.</p>

  <p>The causes of its success are so plain that they scarcely need pointing
  out. It was not only a sound and discreet piece of writing, with people in it
  who were fully alive; there was also a sort of news in it, and even a touch
  of the truculent. What the news uncovered was something near and yet scarcely
  known or even suspected: the amazing life of the London East End, the sewer
  of England and of Christendom. Morrison, in brief, brought on a whole new
  company of comedians and set them to playing novel pieces, tragedy and farce.
  He made them, in his light tales, more real than any solemn Blue Book or
  polemic had ever made them, and by a great deal; he not only created
  plausible characters, but lighted up the whole dark scene behind them. People
  took joy in the book as fiction, and pondered it as a fact. It got a kind of
  double fame, as a work of art and as social document&mdash;a very dubious and
  dangerous kind of fame in most cases, for the document usually swallows the
  work of art. But here the document has faded, and what remains is the
  book.</p>

  <p>At the start, as I say, there was a sort of challenge in it as well as
  news: it was, in a sense, a flouting of Victorian complacency, a headlong
  leap into the unmentionable. Since Dickens' time there had been no such
  plowing up of sour soils. Other men of the decade, true enough, issued
  challenges too, but that was surely not its dominant note. On the contrary,
  it was rather romantic, ameliorative, sweet-singing; its high god was
  Kipling, the sentimental optimist. The Empire was flourishing; the British
  public was in good humor; life seemed a lovely thing. In the midst of all
  this the voice of Morrison had a raucous touch of it. He was amusing and
  interesting, but he was also somewhat disquieting, and even alarming. If this
  London of his really existed&mdash;and inquiry soon showed that it
  did&mdash;then there was a rift somewhere in the lute, and a wart on the
  graceful body politic.</p>

  <p>Now all such considerations are forgotten, and there remains only the book
  of excellent tales. It has been imitated almost as much as "Plain Tales From
  the Hills," and to much better effect. The note seems likely to be a
  permanent one in our fiction. Now and then it appears to die out, but not for
  long. A year ago I thought it was doing so&mdash;and then came the "Limehouse
  Nights" of Thomas Burke, and James Stephens' "Hunger." Both go back to "Tales
  of Mean Streets" as plainly as <i>vers libre</i> goes back to Mother
  Goose.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2"></a>INTRODUCTION: A STREET</h2>

  <p class="first">THIS street is in the East End. There is no need to say in
  the East End of what. The East End is a vast city, as famous in its way as
  any the hand of man has made. But who knows the East End? It is down through
  Cornhill and out beyond Leadenhall Street and Aldgate Pump, one will say: a
  shocking place, where he once went with a curate; an evil plexus of slums
  that hide human creeping things, where filthy men and women live on
  penn'orths of gin, where collars and clean shirts are decencies unknown,
  where every citizen wears a black eye, and none ever combs his hair. The East
  End is a place, says another, which is given over to the Unemployed. And the
  Unemployed is a race whose token is a clay pipe, and whose enemy is soap: now
  and again it migrates bodily to Hyde Park with banners, and furnishes
  adjacent police courts with ;disorderly drunks. Still another knows the East
  End only as the place whence begging letters come; there are coal and blanket
  funds there, all perennially insolvent, and everybody always wants a day in
  the country. Many and misty are people's notions of the East End; and each is
  commonly but the distorted shadow of a minor feature. Foul slums there are in
  the East End, of course, as there are in the West; want and misery there are,
  as wherever a host is gathered together to fight for food. But they are not
  often spectacular in kind.</p>

  <p>Of this street there are about one hundred and fifty yards&mdash;on the
  same pattern all. It is not pretty to look at. A dingy little brick house
  twenty feet high, with three square holes to carry the windows, and an oblong
  hole to carry the door, is not a pleasing object; and each side of this
  street is formed by two or three score of such houses in a row, with one
  front wall in common. And the effect is as of stables.</p>

  <p>Round the corner there are a baker's, a chandler's, and a beer-shop. They
  are not included in the view from any of the rectangular holes; but they are
  well known to every denizen, and the chandler goes to church on Sunday and
  pays for his seat. At the opposite end, turnings lead to streets less rigidly
  ;respectable: some where "Mangling done here" stares from windows, and where
  doors are left carelessly open; others where squalid women sit on doorsteps,
  and girls go to factories in white aprons. Many such turnings, of as many
  grades of decency, are set between this and the nearest slum.</p>

  <p>They are not a very noisy or obtrusive lot in this street. They do not go
  to Hyde Park with banners, and they seldom fight. It is just possible that
  one or two among them, at some point in a life of ups and downs, may have
  been indebted to a coal and blanket fund; but whosoever these may be, they
  would rather die than publish the disgrace, and it is probable that they very
  nearly did so ere submitting to it.</p>

  <p>Some who inhabit this street are in the docks, some in the gasworks, some
  in one or other of the few shipbuilding yards that yet survive on the Thames.
  Two families in a house is the general rule, for there are six rooms behind
  each set of holes: this, unless "young men lodgers" are taken in, or there
  are grown sons paying for bed and board. As for the grown daughters, they
  marry as soon as may be. Domestic service is a social descent, and little
  under millinery and dressmaking is compatible with self-respect. The general
  servant may be caught young among the turnings at the end; where mangling is
  done; and the factory girls live still further off, in places skirting
  slums.</p>

  <p>Every morning at half-past five there is a curious demonstration. The
  street resounds with thunderous knockings, repeated upon door after door, and
  acknowledged ever by a muffled shout from within. These signals are the work
  of the night-watchman or the early policeman, or both, and they summon the
  sleepers to go forth to the docks, the gasworks, and the ship-yards. To be
  awakened in this wise costs fourpence a week, and for this fourpence a fierce
  rivalry rages between night-watchmen and policemen. The
  night-watchman&mdash;a sort of by-blow of the ancient "Charley," and himself
  a fast vanishing quantity&mdash;is the real professional performer; but he
  goes to the wall, because a large connection must be worked if the pursuit is
  to pay at fourpence a knocker. Now, it is not easy to bang at two knockers
  three-quarters of a mile apart, and a hundred others lying between, all
  punctually at half-past five. Wherefore the policeman, to whom the fourpence
  is but a perquisite, and who is content with a smaller round, is rapidly
  supplanting the night-watchman, whose cry of "Past nine o'clock," as he
  collects orders in the evening, is now seldom heard.</p>

  <p>The knocking and the shouting pass, and there; comes the noise of opening
  and shutting of doors, and a clattering away to the docks, the gasworks and
  the ship-yards. Later more door-shutting is heard, and then the trotting of
  sorrow-laden little feet along the grim street to the grim Board School three
  grim streets off. Then silence, save for a subdued sound of scrubbing here
  and there, and the puny squall of croupy infants. After this, a new trotting
  of little feet to docks, gasworks, and ship-yards with father's dinner in a
  basin and a red handkerchief, and so to the Board School again. More muffled
  scrubbing and more squalling, and perhaps a feeble attempt or two at
  decorating the blankness of a square hole here and there by pouring water
  into a grimy flower-pot full of dirt. Then comes the trot of little feet
  toward the oblong holes, heralding the slower tread of sooty artisans; a
  smell of bloater up and down; nightfall; the fighting of boys in the street,
  perhaps of men at the corner near the beer-shop; sleep. And this is the
  record of a day in this street; and every day is hopelessly the same.</p>

  <p>Every day, that is, but Sunday. On Sunday morning a smell of cooking
  floats round the corner from the half-shut baker's, and the little feet trot
  down the street under steaming burdens of beef, potatoes, and batter
  pudding&mdash;the; lucky little feet these, with Sunday boots on them, when
  father is in good work and has brought home all his money; not the poor
  little feet in worn shoes, carrying little bodies in the threadbare clothes
  of all the week, when father is out of work, or ill, or drunk, and the Sunday
  cooking may very easily be done at home,&mdash;if any there be to do.</p>

  <p>On Sunday morning one or two heads of families appear in wonderful black
  suits, with unnumbered creases and wrinklings at the seams. At their sides
  and about their heels trot the unresting little feet, and from under painful
  little velvet caps and straw hats stare solemn little faces towelled to a
  polish. Thus disposed and arrayed, they fare gravely through the grim little
  streets to a grim Little Bethel where are gathered together others in like
  garb and attendance; and for two hours they endure the frantic menace of
  hell-fire.</p>

  <p>Most of the men, however, lie in shirt and trousers on their beds and read
  the Sunday paper; while some are driven forth&mdash;for they hinder the
  housework&mdash;to loaf, and await the opening of the beer-shop round the
  corner. Thus goes Sunday in this street, and every Sunday is the same as
  every other Sunday, so that one monotony is broken with another. For the
  women, however, Sunday is much as; other days, except that there is rather
  more work for them. The break in their round of the week is washing day.</p>

  <p>No event in the outer world makes any impression in this street. Nations
  may rise, or may totter in ruin; but here the colorless day will work through
  its twenty-four hours just as it did yesterday, and just as it will
  to-morrow. Without there may be party strife, wars and rumors of wars, public
  rejoicings; but the trotting of the little feet will be neither quickened nor
  stayed. Those quaint little women, the girl-children of this street, who use
  a motherly management toward all girl-things younger than themselves, and
  toward all boys as old or older, with "Bless the child!" or "Drat the
  children!"&mdash;those quaint little women will still go marketing with big
  baskets, and will regard the price of bacon as chief among human
  considerations. Nothing disturbs this street&mdash;nothing but a strike.</p>

  <p>Nobody laughs here&mdash;life is too serious a thing; nobody sings. There
  was once a woman who sang&mdash;a young wife from the country. But she bore
  children, and her voice cracked. Then her man died, and she sang no more.
  They took away her home, and with her children about her skirts she left this
  street forever. The other women did not think much of her. She was
  "helpless."</p>

  <p>One of the square holes in this street&mdash;one of the single,
  ground-floor holes&mdash;is found, on individual examination, to differ from
  the others. There has been an attempt to make it into a shop-window. Half a
  dozen candles, a few sickly sugar-sticks, certain shrivelled bloaters, some
  bootlaces, and a bundle or two of firewood compose a stock which at night is
  sometimes lighted by a little paraffine lamp in a tin sconce, and sometimes
  by a candle. A widow lives here&mdash;a gaunt, bony widow, with sunken, red
  eyes. She has other sources of income than the candles and the bootlaces: she
  washes and chars all day, and she sews cheap shirts at night. Two "young men
  lodgers," moreover, sleep upstairs, and the children sleep in the back room;
  she herself is supposed not to sleep at all. The policeman does not knock
  here in the morning&mdash;the widow wakes the lodgers herself; and nobody in
  the street behind ever looks out of window before going to bed, no matter how
  late, without seeing a light in the widow's room where she plies her needle.
  She is a quiet woman, who speaks little with her neighbors, having other
  things to do: a woman of pronounced character, to whom it would be
  unadvisable&mdash;even dangerous&mdash;to offer coals or blankets. Hers was
  the strongest contempt for the helpless woman who sang: a contempt whose;
  added bitterness might be traced to its source. For when the singing woman
  was marketing, from which door of the pawnshop had she twice met the widow
  coming forth?</p>

  <p>This is not a dirty street, taken as a whole. The widow's house is one of
  the cleanest, and the widow's children match the house. The one house cleaner
  than the widow's is ruled by a despotic Scotchwoman, who drives every hawker
  off her whitened step, and rubs her door handle if a hand have rested on it.
  The Scotchwoman has made several attempts to accommodate "young men lodgers,"
  but they have ended in shrill rows.</p>

  <p>There is no house without children in this street, and the number of them
  grows ever and ever greater. Nine-tenths of the doctor's visits are on this
  account alone, and his appearances are the chief matter of such conversation
  as the women make across the fences. One after another the little strangers
  come, to live through lives as flat and colorless as the day's life in this
  street. Existence dawns, and the doctor-watchman's door knock resounds along
  the row of rectangular holes. Then a muffled cry announces that a small new
  being has come to trudge and sweat its way in the appointed groove. Later,
  the trotting of little feet and the school; the midday play hour, when love;
  peeps even into this street; after that more trotting of little
  feet&mdash;strange little feet, new little feet&mdash;and the scrubbing, and
  the squalling, and the barren flower-pot; the end of the sooty day's work;
  the last home-coming; nightfall; sleep.</p>

  <p>When love's light falls into some corner of the street, it falls at an
  early hour of this mean life, and is itself but a dusty ray. It falls early,
  because it is the sole bright thing which the street sees, and is watched for
  and counted on. Lads and lasses, awkwardly arm in arm, go pacing up and down
  this street, before the natural interest in marbles and doll's houses would
  have left them in a brighter place. They are "keeping company"; the manner of
  which proceeding is indigenous&mdash;is a custom native to the place. The
  young people first "walk out" in pairs. There is no exchange of promises, no
  troth-plight, no engagement, no love-talk. They patrol the street side by
  side, usually in silence, sometimes with fatuous chatter. There are no
  dances, no tennis, no water-parties, no picnics to bring them together: so
  they must walk out, or be unacquainted. If two of them grow dissatisfied with
  each other's company, nothing is easier than to separate and walk out with
  somebody else. When by these means each has found a fit mate (or thinks so),
  a ring is bought, and the odd association becomes a regular ;engagement; but
  this is not until the walking out has endured for many months. The two stages
  of courtship are spoken of indiscriminately as "keeping company," but a very
  careful distinction is drawn between them by the parties concerned.
  Nevertheless, in the walking out period it would be almost as great a breach
  of faith for either to walk out with more than one, as it would be if the
  full engagement had been made. And love-making in this street is a dreary
  thing, when one thinks of love-making in other places. It begins&mdash;and it
  ends&mdash;too soon.</p>

  <p>Nobody from this street goes to the theatre. That would mean a long
  journey, and it would cost money which might buy bread and beer and boots.
  For those, too, who wear black Sunday suits it would be sinful. Nobody reads
  poetry or romance. The very words are foreign. A Sunday paper in some few
  houses provides such reading as this street is disposed to achieve. Now and
  again a penny novel has been found among the private treasures of a growing
  daughter, and has been wrathfully confiscated. For the air of this street is
  unfavorable to the ideal.</p>

  <p>Yet there are aspirations. There has lately come into the street a young
  man lodger who belongs to a Mutual Improvement Society. Membership in this
  society is regarded as a sort of learned degree, and at its meetings; debates
  are held and papers smugly read by lamentably self-satisfied young men
  lodgers, whose only preparation for debating and writing is a fathomless
  ignorance. For ignorance is the inevitable portion of dwellers here: seeing
  nothing, reading nothing, and considering nothing.</p>

  <p>Where in the East End lies this street? Everywhere. The hundred and fifty
  yards is only a link in a long and a mightily tangled chain&mdash;is only a
  turn in a tortuous maze. This street of the square holes is hundreds of miles
  long. That it is planned in short lengths is true, but there is no other way
  in the world that can more properly be called a single street, because of its
  dismal lack of accent, its sordid uniformity, its utter remoteness from
  delight.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3"></a>LIZERUNT.</h2>

  <h3><a name="ch3-1"
     id="ch3-1"></a>I. LIZER'S WOOING.</h3>

  <p>Somewhere in the register was written the name Elizabeth Hunt; but
  seventeen years after the entry the spoken name was Lizerunt. Lizerunt worked
  at a pickle factory, and appeared abroad in an elaborate and shabby costume,
  usually supplemented by a white apron. Withal she was something of a beauty.
  That is to say, her cheeks were very red, her teeth were very large and
  white, her nose was small and snub, and her fringe was long and shiny; while
  her face, new-washed, was susceptible of a high polish. Many such girls are
  married at sixteen, but Lizerunt was belated, and had never a bloke at
  all.</p>

  <p>Billy Chope was a year older than Lizerunt. He wore a billycock with a
  thin brim and a permanent dent in the crown; he had a bobtail coat, with the
  collar turned up at one side and down at the other, as an expression of
  ;independence; between his meals he carried his hands in his breeches
  pockets; and he lived with his mother, who mangled. His conversation with
  Lizerunt consisted long of perfunctory nods; but great things happened this
  especial Thursday evening, as Lizerunt, making for home, followed the fading
  red beyond the furthermost end of Commercial Road. For Billy Chope, slouching
  in the opposite direction, lurched across the pavement as they met, and,
  taking the nearer hand from his pocket, caught and twisted her arm, bumping
  her against the wall.</p>

  <p>"Garn," said Lizerunt, greatly pleased: "le' go!" For she knew that this
  was love.</p>

  <p>"Where yer auf to, Lizer?"</p>

  <p>"'Ome, o' course, cheeky. Le' go;" and she snatched&mdash;in vain&mdash;at
  Billy's hat.</p>

  <p>Billy let go, and capered in front of her. She feigned to dodge by him,
  careful not to be too quick, because affairs were developing.</p>

  <p>"I say, Lizer," said Billy, stopping his dance and becoming business-like,
  "goin' anywhere Monday?"</p>

  <p>"Not along o' you, cheeky; you go 'long o' Beller Dawson, like wot you did
  Easter."</p>

  <p>"Blow Beller Dawson; <i>she</i> ain't no good. I'm goin' on the Flats.
  Come?"</p>

  <p>Lizerunt, delighted but derisive, ended with a promise to "see." The bloke
  had come at; last, and she walked home with the feeling of having taken her
  degree. She had half assured herself of it two days before, when Sam Cardew
  threw an orange peel at her, but went away after a little prancing on the
  pavement. Sam was a smarter fellow than Billy, and earned his own living;
  probably his attentions were serious; but one must prefer the bird in hand.
  As for Billy Chope, he went his way, resolved himself to take home what
  mangling he should find his mother had finished, and stick to the money;
  also, to get all he could from her by blandishing and bullying, that the
  jaunt to Wanstead Flats might be adequately done.</p><br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>There is no other fair like Whit Monday's on Wanstead Flats. Here is a
  square mile and more of open land where you may howl at large; here is no
  danger of losing yourself, as in Epping Forest; the public houses are always
  with you; shows, shies, swings, merry-go-rounds, fried fish stalls, donkeys,
  are packed closer than on Hampstead Heath; the ladies' tormentors are larger,
  and their contents smell worse, than at any other fair. Also, you may be
  drunk and disorderly without being locked up,&mdash;for the stations won't
  hold everybody,&mdash;and when all else has palled, you may set fire to the
  turf. Hereinto Billy and Lizerunt projected ;themselves from the doors of the
  Holly Tree on Whit Monday morning. But through hours on hours of fried fish
  and half-pints both were conscious of a deficiency. For the hat of Lizerunt
  was brown and old; plush it was not, and its feather was a mere foot long,
  and of a very rusty black. Now, it is not decent for a factory girl from
  Limehouse to go bank-holidaying under any but a hat of plush, very high in
  the crown, of a wild blue or a wilder green, and carrying withal an ostrich
  feather, pink or scarlet or what not; a feather that springs from the fore
  part, climbs the crown, and drops as far down the shoulders as may be.
  Lizerunt knew this, and, had she had no bloke, would have stayed at home. But
  a chance is a chance. As it was, only another such hapless girl could measure
  her bitter envy of the feathers about her, or would so joyfully have given an
  ear for the proper splendor. Billy, too, had a vague impression, muddled by
  but not drowned in half-pints, that some degree of plush was condign to the
  occasion and to his own expenditure. Still, there was no quarrel; and the
  pair walked and ran with arms about each other's necks; and Lizerunt thumped
  her bloke on the back at proper intervals; so that the affair went regularly
  on the whole: although, in view of Lizerunt's shortcomings, Billy did not
  insist on the; customary exchange of hats. Everything, I say, went well and
  well enough until Billy bought a ladies' tormentor and began to squirt it at
  Lizerunt. For then Lizerunt went scampering madly, with piercing shrieks,
  until her bloke was left some little way behind, and Sam Cardew, turning up
  at that moment and seeing her running alone in the crowd, threw his arms
  about her waist and swung her round him again and again, as he floundered
  gallantly this way and that, among the shies and the hokey-pokey barrows.</p>

  <p>"'Ulloo, Lizer! Where <i>are</i> y' a-comin' to? If I 'adn't laid 'old o'
  ye&mdash;!" But here Billy Chope arrived to demand what the 'ell Sam Cardew
  was doing with his gal. Now Sam was ever readier for a fight than Billy was;
  but the sum of Billy's half-pints was large: wherefore the fight began. On
  the skirt of an hilarious ring Lizerunt, after some small outcry, triumphed
  aloud. Four days before, she had no bloke; and here she stood with two, and
  those two fighting for her! Here in the public gaze, on the Flats! For almost
  five minutes she was Helen of Troy.</p>

  <p>And in much less time Billy tasted repentance. The haze of half-pints was
  dispelled, and some teeth went with it. Presently, whimpering and with a
  bloody muzzle, he rose and; made a running kick at the other. Then, being
  thwarted in a bolt, he flung himself down; and it was like to go hard with
  him at the hands of the crowd. Punch you may on Wanstead Flats, but
  execration and worse is your portion if you kick anybody except your wife.
  But, as the ring closed, the helmets of two policemen were seen to be working
  in over the surrounding heads, and Sam Cardew, quickly assuming his coat,
  turned away with such an air of blamelessness as is practicable with a
  damaged eye; while Billy went off unheeded in an opposite direction.</p>

  <p>Lizerunt and her new bloke went the routine of half-pints and
  merry-go-rounds, and were soon on right thumping terms; and Lizerunt was as
  well satisfied with the issue as she was proud of the adventure. Billy was
  all very well; but Sam was better. She resolved to draw him for a feathered
  hat before next bank holiday. So the sun went down on her and her bloke
  hanging on each other's necks and straggling toward the Romford Road with
  shouts and choruses. The rest was tram-car, Bow Music Hall, half-pints, and
  darkness.</p><br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>Billy took home his wounds, and his mother, having moved his wrath by
  asking their origin, sought refuge with a neighbor. He ;accomplished his
  revenge in two instalments. Two nights later Lizerunt was going with a jug of
  beer; when somebody sprang from a dark corner, landed her under the ear,
  knocked her sprawling, and made off to the sound of her lamentations. She did
  not see who it was, but she knew; and next day Sam Cardew was swearing he'd
  break Billy's back. He did not, however, for that same evening a gang of
  seven or eight fell on him with sticks and belts. (They were Causeway chaps,
  while Sam was a Brady's Laner, which would have been reason enough by itself,
  even if Billy Chope had not been one of them.) Sam did his best for a burst
  through and a run, but they pulled and battered him down; and they kicked him
  about the head, and they kicked him about the belly; and they took to their
  heels when he was speechless and still.</p>

  <p>He lay at home for near four weeks, and when he stood up again it was in
  many bandages. Lizerunt came often to his bedside, and twice she brought an
  orange. On these occasions there was much talk of vengeance. But the weeks
  went on. It was a month since Sam had left his bed; and Lizerunt was getting
  a little tired of bandages. Also, she had begun to doubt and to consider bank
  holiday&mdash;scarce a fortnight off. For Sam was stone-broke, and a plush
  hat was further away than ever. And all; through the later of these weeks
  Billy Chope was harder than ever on his mother, and she, well knowing that if
  he helped her by taking home he would pocket the money at the other end, had
  taken to finishing and delivering in his absence, and, threats failing to get
  at the money, Billy Chope was impelled to punch her head and gripe her by the
  throat.</p><br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>There was a milliner's window, with a show of nothing but fashionable
  plush-and-feather hats, and Lizerunt was lingering hereabouts one evening,
  when some one took her by the waist, and some one said, "Which d'yer like,
  Lizer?&mdash;The yuller un?"</p>

  <p>Lizerunt turned and saw that it was Billy. She pulled herself away, and
  backed off, sullen and distrustful. "Garn," she said.</p>

  <p>"Straight," said Billy, "I'll sport yer one.&mdash;No kid, I will."</p>

  <p>"Garn," said Lizerunt once more. "Wot yer gittin' at now?"</p>

  <p>But presently, being convinced that bashing wasn't in it, she approached
  less guardedly; and she went away with a paper bag and the reddest of all the
  plushes and the bluest of all the feathers; a hat that challenged all the
  Flats the next bank holiday, a hat for which no girl need have hesitated to
  sell her soul. As for; Billy, why, he was as good as another; and you can't
  have everything; and Sam Cardew, with his bandages and his grunts and groans,
  was no great catch after all.</p>

  <p>This was the wooing of Lizerunt: for in a few months she and Billy married
  under the blessing of a benignant rector, who periodically set aside a day
  for free weddings, and, on principle, encouraged early matrimony. And they
  lived with Billy's mother.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3><a name="ch3-2"
     id="ch3-2"></a>II. LIZER'S FIRST.</h3>

  <p>When Billy Chope married Lizerunt there was a small rejoicing. There was
  no wedding-party; because it was considered that what there might be to drink
  would be better in the family. Lizerunt's father was not, and her mother felt
  no interest in the affair; not having seen her daughter for a year, and
  happening, at the time, to have a month's engagement in respect of a drunk
  and disorderly. So that there were but three of them; and Billy Chope got
  exceedingly tipsy early in the day; and in the evening his bride bawled a
  continual chorus, while his mother, influenced by that unwonted quartern of
  gin the occasion sanctioned, wept dismally over her boy, who was much too far
  gone to resent it.</p>

  <p>His was the chief reason for rejoicing. For Lizerunt had always been able
  to extract ten shillings a week from the pickle factory, and it was to be
  presumed that as Lizer Chope her earning capacity would not diminish; and
  the; wages would make a very respectable addition to the precarious revenue,
  depending on the mangle, that Billy extorted from his mother. As for Lizer,
  she was married. That was the considerable thing; for she was but a few
  months short of eighteen, and that, as you know, is a little late.</p>

  <p>Of course there were quarrels very soon; for the new Mrs. Chope, less
  submissive at first than her mother-in-law, took a little breaking in, and a
  liberal renewal of the manual treatment once applied in her courting days.
  But the quarrels between the women were comforting to Billy: a diversion and
  a source of better service.</p>

  <p>As soon as might be, Lizer took the way of womankind. This circumstance
  brought an unexpected half-crown from the evangelical rector who had married
  the couple gratis; for recognizing Billy in the street by accident, and being
  told of Mrs. Chope's prospects, as well as that Billy was out of work (a fact
  undeniable), he reflected that his principles did on occasion lead to
  discomfort of a material sort. And Billy, to whose comprehension the
  half-crown opened a new field of receipt, would doubtless have long remained
  a client of the rector, had not that zealot hastened to discover a vacancy
  for a warehouse porter, the offer of presentation; whereunto alienated Billy
  Chope forever. But there were meetings and demonstrations of the Unemployed;
  and it was said that shillings had been given away; and, as being at a
  meeting in a street was at least as amusing as being in a street where there
  was no meeting, Billy often went, on the off chance. But his lot was chiefly
  disappointment: wherefore he became more especially careful to furnish
  himself ere he left home.</p>

  <p>For certain weeks cash came less freely than ever from the two women.
  Lizer spoke of providing for the necessities of the expected child: a
  manifestly absurd procedure, as Billy pointed out, since, if they were unable
  to clothe or feed it, the duty would fall on its grandmother. That was law,
  and nobody could get over it. But even with this argument, a shilling cost
  him many more demands and threats than it had used, and a deal more general
  trouble.</p>

  <p>At last Lizer ceased from going to the pickle factory, and could not even
  help Billy's mother at the mangle for long. This lasted for near a week, when
  Billy, rising at ten with a bad mouth, resolved to stand no nonsense, and
  demanded two shillings.</p>

  <p>"Two bob? Wot for?" Lizer asked.</p>

  <p>"'Cos I want it. None o' yer lip."</p>

  <p>"Ain't got it," said Lizer sulkily.</p>

  <p>"That's a bleed'n' lie."</p>

  <p>"Lie yerself."</p>

  <p>"I'll break y' in 'arves, ye blasted 'eifer!" He ran at her throat and
  forced her back over a chair. "I'll pull yer face auf! If y' don't give me
  the money, gawblimy, I'll do for ye!"</p>

  <p>Lizer strained and squalled. "Le' go! You'll kill me an' the kid too!" she
  grunted hoarsely. Billy's mother ran in and threw her arms about him,
  dragging him away. "Don't, Billy," she said, in terror. "Don't,
  Billy&mdash;not now! You'll get in trouble. Come away! She might go auf, an'
  you'd get in trouble!"</p>

  <p>Billy Chope flung his wife over and turned to his mother. "Take yer 'ands
  auf me," he said: "go on, or I'll gi' ye somethin' for yerself." And he
  punched her in the breast by way of illustration.</p>

  <p>"You shall 'ave what I've got, Billy, if it's money," the mother said.
  "But don't go an' git yerself in trouble, don't. Will a shillin' do?"</p>

  <p>"No, it won't. Think I'm a bloomin' kid? I mean 'avin' two bob this
  mornin'."</p>

  <p>"I was a-keepin' it for the rent, Billy, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yus; think o' the bleed'n' lan'lord 'fore me, doncher?" And he pocketed
  the two shillings. "I ain't settled with you yut, my gal," he added to Lizer;
  "mikin' about at 'ome an' 'idin' money. You wait a bit."</p>

  <p>Lizer had climbed into an erect position, and, gravid and slow, had got as
  far as the passage. Mistaking this for a safe distance, she replied with
  defiant railings. Billy made for her with a kick that laid her on the lower
  stairs, and, swinging his legs round his mother as she obstructed him,
  entreating him not to get in trouble, he attempted to kick again in a more
  telling spot. But a movement among the family upstairs and a tap at the door
  hinted of interference, and he took himself off.</p>

  <p>Lizer lay doubled upon the stairs, howling: but her only articulate cry
  was, "Gawd 'elp me, it's comin'!"</p>

  <p>Billy went to the meeting of the Unemployed, and cheered a proposal to
  storm the Tower of London. But he did not join the procession following a man
  with a handkerchief on a stick, who promised destruction to every policeman
  in his path: for he knew the fate of such processions. With a few others, he
  hung about the nearest tavern for a while, on the chance of the advent of a
  flush sailor from St. Katharine's, disposed to treat out-o'-workers. Then he
  went alone to a quieter beer-house and took a pint or two at his own expense.
  A glance down the music-hall bills hanging in the bar having given him a
  notion for the evening, he bethought himself of dinner, and made for
  home.</p>

  <p>The front door was open, and in the first room, where the mangle stood,
  there were no signs of dinner. And this was at three o'clock! Billy pushed
  into the room behind, demanding why.</p>

  <p>"Billy," Lizer said faintly from her bed, "look at the baby!"</p>

  <p>Something was moving feebly under a flannel petticoat. Billy pulled the
  petticoat aside, and said, "That? Well, it <i>is</i> a measly snipe." It was
  a blind, hairless homunculus, short of a foot long, with a skinny face set in
  a great skull. There was a black bruise on one side from hip to armpit. Billy
  dropped the petticoat and said, "Where's my dinner?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno," Lizer responded hazily. "Wot's the time?"</p>

  <p>"Time? Don't try to kid me. You git up; go on. I want my dinner."</p>

  <p>"Mother's gittin' it, I think," said Lizer. "Doctor had to slap 'im like
  anythink 'fore 'e'd cry. 'E don't cry now much. 'E&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go on; out ye git. I do' want no more damn jaw. Git my dinner."</p>

  <p>"I'm a-gittin' of it, Billy," his mother said, at the door. She had begun
  when he first entered. "It won't be a minute."</p>

  <p>"You come 'ere; y' ain't alwis s' ready to do 'er work, are ye? She ain't
  no call to stop; there no longer, an' I owe 'er one for this mornin'. Will ye
  git out, or shall I kick ye?"</p>

  <p>"She can't, Billy," his mother said. And Lizer snivelled and said, "You're
  a damn brute. Y' ought to be bleedin' well booted."</p>

  <p>But Billy had her by the shoulders and began to haul; and again his mother
  besought him to remember what he might bring upon himself. At this moment the
  doctor's dispenser, a fourth-year London Hospital student of many inches, who
  had been washing his hands in the kitchen, came in. For a moment he failed to
  comprehend the scene. Then he took Billy Chope by the collar, hauled him
  pell-mell along the passage, kicked him (hard) into the gutter, and shut the
  door.</p>

  <p>When he returned to the room, Lizer, sitting up and holding on by the
  bed-frame, gasped hysterically: "Ye bleedin' makeshift, I'd 'ave yer liver
  out if I could reach ye! You touch my 'usband, ye long pisenin' 'ound you!
  Ow!" And, infirm of aim, she flung a cracked teacup at his head. Billy's
  mother said, "Y' ought to be ashamed of yourself, you low blaggard. If 'is
  father was alive 'e'd knock yer 'ead auf. Call yourself a doctor&mdash;a
  passel o' boys!&mdash;Git out! Go out o' my 'ouse, or I'll give y' in
  charge!"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;why, hang it, he'd have killed her." Then to Lizer, "Lie
  down."</p>

  <p>"Sha'n't lay down. Keep auf! if you come near me I'll corpse ye. You go
  while ye're safe!"</p>

  <p>The dispenser appealed to Billy's mother. "For God's sake make her lie
  down. She'll kill herself. I'll go. Perhaps the doctor had better come." And
  he went: leaving the coast clear for Billy Chope to return and avenge his
  kicking.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3><a name="ch3-3"
     id="ch3-3"></a>III. A CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES.</h3>

  <p>Lizer was some months short of twenty-one when her third child was born.
  The pickle factory had discarded her some time before, and since that her
  trade had consisted in odd jobs of charing. Odd jobs of charing have a shade
  the better of a pickle factory in the matter of respectability, but they are
  precarious, and they are worse paid at that. In the East End they are
  sporadic and few. Moreover, it is in the household where paid help is a
  rarity that the bitterness of servitude is felt. Also, the uncertainty and
  irregularity of the returns were a trouble to Billy Chope. He was never sure
  of having got them all. It might be ninepence, or a shilling, or
  eighteenpence. Once or twice, to his knowledge, it had been half-a-crown,
  from a chance job at a doctor's or a parson's, and once it was three
  shillings. That it might be half-a-crown or three shillings again, and that
  some of it was being kept back, was ever the suspicion evoked by Lizer's
  ;evening homing. Plainly, with these fluctuating and uncertain revenues, more
  bashing than ever was needed to insure the extraction of the last copper;
  empty-handedness called for bashing on its own account; so that it was often
  Lizer's hap to be refused a job because of a black eye.</p>

  <p>Lizer's self was scarcely what it had been. The red of her cheeks, once
  bounded only by the eyes and the mouth, had shrunk to a spot in the depth of
  each hollow; gaps had been driven in her big white teeth; even the snub nose
  had run to a point, and the fringe hung dry and ragged, while the bodily
  outline was as a sack's. At home, the children lay in her arms or tumbled at
  her heels, puling and foul. Whenever she was near it, there was the mangle to
  be turned; for lately Billy's mother had exhibited a strange weakness,
  sometimes collapsing with a gasp in the act of brisk or prolonged exertion,
  and often leaning on whatever stood hard by and grasping at her side. This
  ailment she treated, when she had twopence, in such terms as made her smell
  of gin and peppermint; and more than once this circumstance had inflamed the
  breast of Billy her son, who was morally angered by this boozing away of
  money that was really his.</p>

  <p>Lizer's youngest, being seven or eight months old, was mostly taking care
  of itself, when Billy made a welcome discovery after a hard and; pinching
  day. The night was full of blinding wet, and the rain beat on the window as
  on a drum. Billy sat over a small fire in the front room smoking his pipe,
  while his mother folded clothes for delivery. He stamped twice on the hearth,
  and then, drawing off his boot, he felt inside it. It was a nail. The
  poker-head made a good anvil, and, looking about for a hammer, Billy
  bethought him of a brick from the mangle. He rose, and, lifting the lid of
  the weight-box, groped about among the clinkers and the other ballast till he
  came upon a small but rather heavy paper parcel. "'Ere&mdash;wot's this?" he
  said, and pulled it out.</p>

  <p>His mother, whose back had been turned, hastened across the room, hand to
  breast (it had got to be her habit). "What is it, Billy?" she said. "Not
  that: there's nothing there. I'll get anything you want, Billy." And she made
  a nervous catch at the screw of paper. But Billy fended her off, and tore the
  package open. It was money, arranged in little columns of farthings,
  halfpence, and threepenny pieces, with a few sixpences, a shilling or two,
  and a single half-sovereign. "O," said Billy, "this is the game, is
  it?&mdash;'idin' money in the mangle! Got any more?" And he hastily turned
  the brickbats.</p>

  <p>"No, Billy, don't take that&mdash;don't!" ;implored his mother. "There'll
  be some money for them things when they go 'ome&mdash;'ave that. I'm savin'
  it, Billy, for something partic'ler: s'elp me Gawd, I am, Billy."</p>

  <p>"Yus," replied Billy, raking diligently among the clinkers, "savin' it for
  a good ol' booze. An' now you won't 'ave one. Bleedin' nice thing, 'idin'
  money away from yer own son!"</p>

  <p>"It ain't for that, Billy&mdash;s'elp me, it ain't; it's case anythink
  'appens to me. On'y to put me away decent, Billy, that's all. We never know,
  an' you'll be glad of it t'elp bury me if I should go any time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll be glad of it now," answered Billy, who had it in his pocket; "an'
  I've got it. You ain't a dyin' sort, <i>you</i> ain't; an' if you was, the
  parish 'ud soon tuck <i>you</i> up. P'raps you'll be straighter about money
  after this."</p>

  <p>"Let me 'ave <i>some</i>, then,&mdash;you can't want it all. Give me some,
  an' then 'ave the money for the things. There's ten dozen and seven, and you
  can take 'em yerself if ye like."</p>

  <p>"Wot&mdash;in this 'ere rain? Not me! I bet I'd 'ave the money if I wanted
  it without that. 'Ere&mdash;change these 'ere fardens at the draper's wen you
  go out: there's two bob's worth an' a penn'orth; I don't want to bust my
  pockets wi' them."</p>

  <p>While they spoke Lizer had come in from; the back room. But she said
  nothing: she rather busied herself with a child she had in her arms. When
  Billy's mother, despondent and tearful, had tramped out into the rain with a
  pile of clothes in an oilcloth wrapper, she said sulkily, without looking up,
  "You might 'a' let 'er kep' that; you git all you want."</p>

  <p>At another time this remonstrance would have provoked active hostilities;
  but now, with the money about him, Billy was complacently disposed. "You
  shutcher 'ead," he said, "I got this, any'ow. She can make it up out o' my
  rent if she likes." This last remark was a joke, and he chuckled as he made
  it. For Billy's rent was a simple fiction, devised, on the suggestion of a
  smart canvasser, to give him a parliamentary vote.</p>

  <p>That night Billy and Lizer slept, as usual, in the bed in the back room,
  where the two younger children also were. Billy's mother made a bedstead
  nightly with three chairs and an old trunk in the front room by the mangle,
  and the eldest child lay in a floor-bed near her. Early in the morning Lizer
  awoke at a sudden outcry of the little creature. He clawed at the handle till
  he opened the door, and came staggering and tumbling into the room with
  screams of terror. "Wring 'is blasted neck," his father grunted sleepily.
  "Wot's the kid 'owlin' for?"</p>

  <p>"I's 'f'aid o' g'anny&mdash;I's 'f'aid o' g'anny!" was all the child could
  say; and when he had said it, he fell to screaming once more.</p>

  <p>Lizer rose and went to the next room; and straightway came a scream from
  her also. "O&mdash;O&mdash;Billy! Billy! O my Gawd! Billy, come 'ere!"</p>

  <p>And Billy, fully startled, followed in Lizer's wake. He blundered in,
  rubbing his eyes, and saw.</p>

  <p>Stark on her back in the huddled bed of old wrappers and shawls lay his
  mother. The outline of her poor face&mdash;strained in an upward stare of
  painful surprise&mdash;stood sharp and meagre against the black of the grate
  beyond. But the muddy old skin was white, and looked cleaner than its wont,
  and many of the wrinkles were gone.</p>

  <p>Billy Chope, half-way across the floor, recoiled from the corpse, and
  glared at it pallidly from the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Good Gawd!" he croaked faintly, "is she dead?"</p>

  <p>Seized by a fit of shuddering breaths, Lizer sank on the floor, and, with
  her head across the body, presently broke into a storm of hysterical
  blubbering, while Billy, white and dazed, dressed hurriedly and got out of
  the house. He was at home as little as might be until the coroner's; officer
  carried away the body two days later. When he came for his meals, he sat
  doubtful and querulous in the matter of the front room door's being shut. The
  dead once clear away, however, he resumed his faculties, and clearly saw that
  here was a bad change for the worse. There was the mangle, but who was to
  work it? If Lizer did, there would be no more charing jobs&mdash;a clear loss
  of one-third of his income. And it was not at all certain that the people who
  had given their mangling to his mother would give it to Lizer. Indeed, it was
  pretty sure that many would not, because mangling is a thing given by
  preference to widows, and many widows of the neighborhood were perpetually
  competing for it. Widows, moreover, had the first call in most odd jobs
  whereunto Lizer might turn her hand: an injustice whereon Billy meditated
  with bitterness.</p>

  <p>The inquest was formal and unremarked, the medical officer having no
  difficulty in certifying a natural death from heart disease. The bright idea
  of a collection among the jury, which Billy communicated, with pitiful
  representations, to the coroner's officer, was brutally swept aside by that
  functionary, made cunning by much experience. So the inquest brought him
  nought save disappointment and a sense of injury...</p>

  <p>The mangling orders fell away as suddenly and completely as he had feared:
  they were duly absorbed among the local widows. Neglect the children as Lizer
  might, she could no longer leave them as she had done. Things, then, were bad
  with Billy, and neither threats nor thumps could evoke a shilling now.</p>

  <p>It was more than Billy could bear: so that, "'Ere," he said one night,
  "I've 'ad enough o' this. You go and get some money; go on."</p>

  <p>"Go an' git it?" replied Lizer. "O yus. That's easy, ain't it? 'Go an' git
  it,' says you. 'Ow?"</p>

  <p>"Any'ow&mdash;I don't care. Go on."</p>

  <p>"Wy," replied Lizer, looking up with wide eyes, "d'ye think I can go an'
  pick it up in the street?"</p>

  <p>"Course you can. Plenty others does, don't they?"</p>

  <p>"Gawd, Billy...wot d'ye mean?"</p>

  <p>"Wot I say; plenty others does it. Go on&mdash;you ain't so bleed'n'
  innocent as all that. Go an' see Sam Cardew. Go on&mdash;'ook it."</p>

  <p>Lizer, who had been kneeling at the child's floor-bed, rose to her feet,
  pale-faced and bright of eye.</p>

  <p>"Stow kiddin', Billy," she said. "You don't mean that. I'll go round to
  the fact'ry in the mornin': p'raps they'll take me on temp'ry."</p>

  <p>"Damn the fact'ry."</p>

  <p>He pushed her into the passage. "Go on&mdash;you git me some money, if ye
  don't want yer bleed'n' 'ead knocked auf."</p>

  <p>There was a scuffle in the dark passage, with certain blows, a few broken
  words, and a sob. Then the door slammed, and Lizer Chope was in the windy
  street.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4"></a>WITHOUT VISIBLE MEANS.</h2>

  <p class="first">ALL East London idled, or walked in a procession, or waylaid
  and bashed, or cried in an empty kitchen: for it was the autumn of the Great
  Strikes. One army of men, having been prepared, was ordered to
  strike&mdash;and struck. Other smaller armies of men, with no preparation,
  were ordered to strike to express sympathy&mdash;and struck. Other armies
  still were ordered to strike because it was the fashion&mdash;and struck.
  Then many hands were discharged because the strikes in other trades left them
  no work. Many others came from other parts in regiments to work, but remained
  to loaf in gangs: taught by the example of earlier regiments, which, the
  situation being explained (an expression devised to include mobbings and
  kickings and flingings into docks), had returned whence they came. So that
  East London was very noisy and largely hungry; and the rest of the world
  looked on with intense interest, making earnest suggestions, and
  comprehending nothing. Lots of strikers, having no strike pay; and finding
  little nourishment in processions, started off to walk to Manchester,
  Birmingham, Liverpool, or Newcastle, where work might be got. Along the Great
  North Road such men might be seen in silent companies of a dozen or twenty,
  now and again singly or in couples. At the tail of one such gang, which
  gathered in the Burdett Road and found its way into the Enfield Road by way
  of Victoria Park, Clapton, and Stamford Hill, walked a little group of three:
  a voluble young man of thirty, a stolid workman rather older, and a pale,
  anxious little fellow, with a nasty spasmic cough and a canvas bag of
  tools.</p>

  <p>The little crowd straggled over the footpath and the road, few of its
  members speaking, most of them keeping to their places and themselves. As yet
  there was nothing of the tramp in the aspect of these mechanics. With their
  washed faces and well-mended clothes they might have been taken for a jury
  coming from a local inquest. As the streets got broken and detached, with
  patches of field between, they began to look about them. One young fellow in
  front (with no family to think of), who looked upon the enterprise as an
  amusing sort of tour, and had even brought an accordion, began to rebel
  against the general depression, and attempted a joke about going to the
  Alexandra Palace. But; in the rear, the little man with the canvas bag,
  putting his hand abstractedly into his pocket, suddenly stared and stopped.
  He drew out the hand, and saw in it three shillings.</p>

  <p>"S'elp me," he said, "the missis is done that&mdash;shoved it in unbeknown
  when I come away! An' she's on'y got a bob for 'erself an' the kids." He
  broke into a sweat of uneasiness. "I'll 'ave to send it back at the next
  post-office, that's all."</p>

  <p>"Send it back? not you!" Thus with deep scorn the voluble young man at his
  side. "<i>She'll</i> be all right, you lay your life. A woman allus knows 'ow
  to look after 'erself. You'll bleed'n' soon want it, an' bad. You do as I
  tell you, Joey: stick to it. That's right, Dave, ain't it?"</p>

  <p>"Matter o' fancy," replied the stolid man. "My missis cleared my pockets
  out 'fore I got away. Shouldn't wonder at bein' sent after for leavin' 'er
  chargeable if I don't soon send some more. Women's different."</p>

  <p>The march continued, and grew dustier. The cheerful pilgrim in front
  produced his accordion. At Palmer's Green four went straight ahead to try for
  work at the Enfield Arms Factory. The others, knowing the thing hopeless,
  turned off to the left for Potter's Bar.</p>

  <p>After a long silence, "Which 'll be nearest,; Dave," asked little Joey
  Clayton, "Newcastle or Middlesborough?"</p>

  <p>"Middlesborough," said Dave; "I done it afore."</p>

  <p>"Trampin' ain't so rough on a man, is it, after all?" asked Joey
  wistfully. "<i>You</i> done all right, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Got through. All depends, though it's rough enough. Matter o' luck.
  <i>I</i>'ad the bad weather."</p>

  <p>"If I don't get a good easy job where we're goin'," remarked the voluble
  young man, "I'll 'ave a strike there too."</p>

  <p>"'Ave a strike there?" exclaimed Joey. "'Ow? Who'd call 'em out?"</p>

  <p>"Wy, <i>I</i> would. I think I'm equal to doin' it, ain't I? An' when
  workin' men stand idle an' 'ungry in the midst o' the wealth an' the lukshry
  an' the igstravagance they've produced with the sweat of their brow, why,
  then, feller-workmen, it's time to act. It's time to bring the nigger-drivin'
  bloated capitalists to their knees."</p>

  <p>"'Ear, 'ear," applauded Joey Clayton; tamely, perhaps, for the words were
  not new. "Good on yer, Newman!" Newman had a habit of practising this sort of
  thing in snatches whenever he saw the chance. He had learnt the trick in a
  debating society; and Joey Clayton; was always an applausive audience. There
  was a pause, the accordion started another tune, and Newman tried a different
  passage of his harangue.</p>

  <p>"In the shop they call me Skulky Newman. Why? 'Cos I skulk, o' course"
  ("'Ear, 'ear," dreamily&mdash;from Dave this time). "I ain't ashamed of it,
  my friends. I'm a miker out an' out, an' I 'ope I shall always remain a
  miker. The less a worker does the more 'as to be imployed, don't they? An'
  the more the toilers wrings out o' the capitalists, don't they? Very well
  then, I mike, an' I do it as a sacred dooty."</p>

  <p>"You'll 'ave all the mikin' you want for a week or two," said Dave Burge
  placidly. "Stow it."</p>

  <p>At Potter's Bar the party halted and sat under a hedge to eat hunks of
  bread and cheese (or hunks of bread and nothing else) and to drink cold tea
  out of cans. Skulky Newman, who had brought nothing, stood in with his two
  friends. As they started anew and turned into the Great North Road he said,
  stretching himself and looking slyly at Joey Clayton, "If <i>I'd</i> got a
  bob or two I'd stand you two blokes a pint apiece."</p>

  <p>Joey looked troubled. "Well, as you ain't, I suppose I ought to," he said
  uneasily, turning toward the little inn hard by. "Dave," he cried to Burge,
  who was walking on, "won't you 'ave; a drink?" And, "Well, if you <i>are</i>
  goin' to do the toff, I ain't proud," was the slow reply.</p>

  <p>Afterward Joey was inclined to stop at the post-office to send away at
  least two shillings. But Newman wouldn't. He enlarged on the improvidence of
  putting out of reach that which might be required on an emergency, he
  repeated his axiom as to a woman's knack of keeping alive in spite of all
  things: and Joey determined not to send&mdash;for a day or so at any
  rate.</p>

  <p>The road got looser and dustier; the symptoms of the tramp came out
  stronger and stronger on the gang. The accordion struck up from time to time,
  but ceased toward the end of the afternoon. The player wearied, and some of
  the older men, soon tired of walking, were worried by the noise. Joey
  Clayton, whose cough was aggravated by the dust, was especially tortured,
  after every fit, to hear the thing drawling and whooping the tune it had
  drawled and whooped a dozen times before; but he said nothing, scarce knowing
  what annoyed him.</p>

  <p>At Hatfield Station two of the foremost picked up a few coppers by helping
  with a heavy trap-load of luggage. Up Digswell Hill the party tailed out
  lengthily, and Newman, who had been letting off a set speech, was fain to
  save his wind. The night came, clear to see and sweet to smell. Between
  Welwyn and Codicote; the company broke up to roost in such barns as they
  might possess: all but the master of the accordion, who had stayed at a
  little public-house at Welwyn, with the notion of earning a pot of beer and a
  stable-corner (or better) by a tune in the tap-room. Dave Burge lighted on a
  lone shed of thatched hurdles with loose hay in it, and Newman straightway
  curled in the snuggest corner on most of the hay. Dave Burge pulled some from
  under him, and, having helped Joey Clayton to build a nest in the best place
  left, was soon snoring. But Joey lay awake all night, and sat up and coughed
  and turned restlessly, being unused to the circumstances and apprehensive of
  those months in jail which (it is well known) are rancorously dealt forth
  among all them that sleep in barns.</p>

  <p>Luck provided a breakfast next morning at Codicote: for three bicyclists,
  going north, stood cold beef and bread round at The Anchor. The man with the
  accordion caught up. He had made his lodging and breakfast and eightpence:
  this had determined him to stay at Hitchin, and work it for at least a day,
  and then to diverge into the towns and let the rest go their way. So beyond
  Hitchin there was no music.</p>

  <p>Joey Clayton soon fell slow. Newman had his idea; and the three were left
  behind, and Joey staggered after his mates with difficulty.; He lacked sleep,
  and he lacked stamina. Dave Burge took the canvas bag, and there were many
  rests: when Newman, expressing a resolve to stick by his fellow-man through
  thick and thin, hinted at drinks. Dave Burge made twopence at Henlow level
  crossing by holding an unsteady horse while a train passed. Joey saw little
  of the rest of the day; the road was yellow and dazzling, his cough tore him,
  and things were red sometimes and sometimes blue. He walked without knowing
  it, now helped, now lurching on alone. The others of the party were far ahead
  and forgotten. There was talk of a windmill ahead, where there would be rest;
  and the three men camped in an old boathouse by the river just outside
  Biggleswade. Joey, sleeping as he tottered, fell in a heap and lay without
  moving from sunset to broad morning.</p>

  <p>When he woke Dave Burge was sitting at the door, but Newman was gone.
  Also, there was no sign of the canvas bag.</p>

  <p>"No use lookin'," said Dave; "'e's done it."</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"Skulky's 'opped the twig an' sneaked your tools. Gawd knows where 'e is
  by now."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;" the little man gasped, sitting up in a pale sweat..."Not
  sneaked 'em...is 'e?...S'elp me, there's a set o' callipers worth fifteen bob
  in that bag...'e ain't gawn...?"</p>

  <p>Dave Burge nodded inexorably.</p>

  <p>"Best feel in your pockets," he said, "p'raps 'e's bin there."</p>

  <p>He had. The little man broke down. "I was a-goin' to send 'ome that two
  bob&mdash;s'elp me, I was...An' what can I do without my tools? If I'd got no
  job I could 'a pawned 'em&mdash;an' then I'd 'a sent 'ome the
  money&mdash;s'elp me I would...O, it's crool!"</p><br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>The walking, with the long sleep after it, had left him sore and stiff,
  and Dave had work to put him on the road again. He had forgotten yesterday
  afternoon, and asked, at first, for the others. They tramped in silence for a
  few miles: when Joey suddenly flung himself upon a tussock by the
  wayside.</p>

  <p>"Why won't nobody let me live?" he snivelled. "<i>I'm</i> a 'armless bloke
  enough. I worked at Ritterson's, man and boy, very nigh twenty year. When
  they come an' ordered us out, I come out with the others, peaceful enough; I
  didn't want to chuck it up, Gawd knows, but I come out promp' when they told
  me. And when I found another job on the Island, four big blokes set about me
  an' 'arf killed me. <i>I</i> didn't know the place was blocked. And when two
  o' the blokes was took up, they said I'd get strike-pay again if I didn't
  identify 'em; so I didn't. But; they never give me no strike-pay&mdash;they
  laughed an' chucked me out. An' now I'm a-starvin' on the 'igh road. An'
  Skulky...blimy...<i>'e's</i> done me too!"</p><br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>There were days wherein Joey learned to eat a swede pulled from behind a
  wagon, and to feel thankful for an early turnip; might have learned, too,
  just what tramping means in many ways to a man unskilled both in begging and
  in theft, but was never equal to it. He coughed&mdash;and worse: holding to
  posts and gates, and often spitting blood. He had little to say, but trudged
  mechanically, taking note of nothing.</p>

  <p>Once, as though aroused from a reverie, he asked, "Wasn't there some
  others?"</p>

  <p>"Others?" said Dave, for a moment taken aback. "O, yes, there was some
  others. They're gone on ahead, y'know."</p>

  <p>Joey tramped for half a mile in silence. Then he said, "Expect they're
  'avin' a rough time too."</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;very like," said Dave.</p>

  <p>For a space Joey was silent, save for the cough. Then he went on: "Comes
  o' not bringing 'cordions with 'em. Every one ought to take a 'cordion what
  goes trampin'. I knew a man once that went trampin', an' 'e took a 'cordion.
  <i>He</i> done all right. It ain't so rough; for them as plays on the
  'cordion." And Dave Burge rubbed his cap about his head and stared; but
  answered nothing.</p>

  <p>It was a bad day. Crusts were begged at cottages. Every rise and every
  turn, the eternal yellow road lay stretch on stretch before them, flouting
  their unrest. Joey, now unimpressionable, endured more placidly than even
  Dave Burge. Late in the afternoon, "No," he said, "it ain't so rough for them
  as plays the 'cordion. They 'as the best of it...S'elp me," he added
  suddenly, "<i>we're</i> all 'cordions!" He sniggered thoughtfully, and then
  burst into a cough that left him panting. "We're nothin' but a bloomin' lot
  o' 'cordions ourselves," he went on, having got his breath, "an' they play
  any toon they like on us; an' that's 'ow they make their livin'. S'elp me,
  Dave, we're all 'cordions." And he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Um&mdash;yus," the other man grunted. And he looked curiously at his
  mate; for he had never heard that sort of laugh before.</p>

  <p>But Joey fondled the conceit, and returned to it from time to time; now
  aloud, now to himself. "All 'cordions: playin' any toon as is ordered,
  blimy...<i>Are</i> we 'cordions? <i>I</i> don't b'lieve we're as much as
  that...no, s'elp me. We're on'y the footlin' little keys; shoved about to
  soot the toon...Little tin keys, blimy...; footlin' little keys...I've bin
  played on plenty, <i>I</i> 'ave..."</p>

  <p>Dave Burge listened with alarm, and tried to talk of other things. But
  Joey rarely heard him. "I've bin played on plenty, <i>I</i> 'ave," he
  persisted. "I was played on once by a pal: an' my spring broke."</p>

  <p>At nightfall there was more bad luck. They were driven from a likely barn
  by a leather-gaitered man with a dog, and for some distance no dormitory
  could be found. Then it was a cut haystack, with a nest near the top and
  steps to reach it.</p>

  <p>In the night Burge was wakened by a clammy hand upon his face. There was a
  thick mist.</p>

  <p>"It's you, Dave, ain't it?" Clayton was saying. "Good Gawd, I thought I'd
  lawst you. What's all this 'ere&mdash;not the water is it?&mdash;not the
  dock? I'm soppin' wet."</p>

  <p>Burge himself was wet to the skin. He made Joey lie down, and told him to
  sleep; but a coughing fit prevented that. "It was them 'cordions woke me," he
  explained when it was over.</p>

  <p>So the night put on the shuddering gray of the fore-dawn. And the two
  tramps left their perch, and betook them, shivering and stamping, to the
  road.</p>

  <p>That morning Joey had short fits of dizziness; and faintness. "It's my
  spring broke," he would say after such an attack. "Bloomin' little tin key
  put out o' toon." And once he added, "I'm up to one toon, though, now: this
  'ere bloomin' Dead March."</p>

  <p>Just at the outskirts of a town, where he stopped to cough over a gate, a
  stout old lady, walking out with a shaggy little dog, gave him a shilling.
  Dave Burge picked it up as it dropped from his incapable hand, and "Joey,
  'ere's a bob," he said; "a lady give it you. You come an' git a drop o'
  beer."</p>

  <p>They carried a twopenny loaf into the tap-room of a small tavern, and Dave
  had mild ale himself, but saw that Joey was served with stout with a
  penn'orth of gin in it. Soon the gin and stout reached Joey's head, and drew
  it to the table. And he slept, leaving the rest of the shilling where it
  lay.</p>

  <p>Dave arose, and stuffed the last of the twopenny loaf into his pocket. He
  took a piece of chalk from the bagatelle board in the corner, and wrote this
  on the table:&mdash;"<i>dr. sir. for god sake take him to the work
  House</i>."</p>

  <p>Then he gathered up the coppers where they lay, and stepped quietly into
  the street.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5"></a>TO BOW BRIDGE.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE eleven-five tram-car from Stratford started for Bow a
  trifle before its time. The conductor knew what he might escape by stealing a
  march on the closing public-houses; as also what was in store for all the
  conductors in his wake, till there were no more revellers left to swarm the
  cars. For it was Saturday night, and many a week's wages were a-knocking
  down; and the publicans this side of Bow Bridge shut their doors at eleven
  under Act of Parliament, whereas beyond the Bridge, which is the county of
  London, the law gives them another hour, and a man may drink many pots
  therein. And for this, at eleven every Saturday, there is a great rush
  westward, a vast migration over Lea, from all the length of High Street. From
  the nearer parts they walk, or do their best to walk; but from further
  Stratford, by the Town Hall, the Church, and the Martyrs' Memorial, they
  crowd the cars. For one thing, it is a long half-mile, and the week's work is
  over. Also, the car being swamped, it is odds; that a man shall save his
  fare, since no conductor may fight his way a quarter through his passengers
  before Bow Bridge, where the vehicle is emptied at a rush. And that means yet
  another half-pint.</p>

  <p>So the eleven-five car started sooner than it might have done. As it was
  spattering with rain, I boarded it, sharing the conductor's forlorn hope, but
  taking care to sit at the extreme fore-end inside. In the broad street the
  market clamored and flared, its lights and shadows flickering and fading
  about the long churchyard and the steeple in the midst thereof; and toward
  the distant lights, the shining road sparkled in long reaches, like a
  blackguard river.</p>

  <p>A gap fell here and there among the lights where a publican put his gas
  out; and at these points the crowds thickened. A quiet mechanic came in, and
  sat near a decent woman with children, a bundle, a basket, and a cabbage.
  Thirty yards on the car rumbled, and suddenly its hinder end was taken in a
  mass of people&mdash;howling, struggling, and blaspheming&mdash;who stormed
  and wrangled in at the door and up the stairs. There were lads and men
  whooping and flushed, there were girls and women screaming choruses; and in a
  moment the seats were packed, knees were taken, and there was not an inch of
  standing room. The conductor cried, ;"All full!" and tugged at his
  bell-strap, whereunto many were hanging by the hand; but he was swept from
  his feet, and made to push hard for his own place. And there was no more
  foothold on the back platform nor the front, nor any vacant step upon the
  stairway; and the roof was thronged; and the rest of the crowd was fain to
  waylay the next car.</p>

  <p>This one moved off slowly, with shrieks and howls that were racking to the
  wits. From divers quarters of the roof came a bumping thunder as of
  cellar-flapping clogs. Profanity was sluiced down, as it were by pailfuls,
  from above, and was swilled back as it were in pailfuls from below. Blowses
  in feathered bonnets bawled hilarious obscenity at the jiggers. A little maid
  with a market-basket, hustled and jostled and elbowed at the far end,
  listened eagerly and laughed when she could understand; and the quiet
  mechanic, whose knees had been invaded by an unsteady young woman in a
  crushed hat, tried to look pleased. My own knees were saved from capture by
  the near neighborhood of an enormous female, seated partly on the seat and
  partly on myself, snorting and gulping with sleep, her head upon the next
  man's shoulder. (To offer your seat to a standing woman would, as beseems a
  foreign antic, have been visited by the ribaldry of the whole crowd.) In the
  midst; of the riot the decent woman sat silent and indifferent, her children
  on and about her knees. Further along, two women ate fish with their fingers
  and discoursed personalities in voices which ran strident through the uproar,
  as the odor of their snack asserted itself in the general fetor. And opposite
  the decent woman there sat a bonnetless drab, who said nothing, but looked at
  the decent woman's children as a shoeless brat looks at the dolls in a
  toyshop window.</p>

  <p>"So I ses to 'er, I ses"&mdash;this from the snacksters&mdash;"I'm a
  respectable married woman, I ses. More'n you can say, you barefaced hussey, I
  ses&mdash;" Then a shower of curses, a shout, and a roar of laughter; and the
  conductor, making slow and laborious progress with the fares nearest him,
  turned his head. A man had jumped upon the footboard and a passenger's toes.
  A scuffle and a fight, and both had rolled off into the mire, and got left
  behind. "Ain't they fond o' one another?" cried a girl. "They're a-goin' for
  a walk together;" and there was a guffaw. "The silly bleeders'll be too late
  for the pubs," said a male voice; and there was another, for the general
  understanding was touched.</p>

  <p>Then&mdash;an effect of sympathy, perhaps&mdash;a scuffle broke out on the
  roof. But this ;disturbed not the insides. The conductor went on his plaguy
  task: to save time, he passed over the one or two that, asked now or not,
  seemed likely to pay at the journey's end. The snacking women resumed their
  talk, the choristers their singing; the rumble of the wheels was lost in a
  babel of vacant ribaldry; the enormous woman choked and gasped and snuggled
  lower down upon her neighbor's shoulder; and the shabby strumpet looked at
  the children.</p>

  <p>A man by the door vomited his liquor: whereat was more hilarity, and his
  neighbors, with many yaups, shoved further up the middle. But one of the
  little ones, standing before her mother, was pushed almost to falling; and
  the harlot, seeing her chance, snatched the child upon her knee. The child
  looked up, something in wonder, and smiled; and the woman leered as honestly
  as she might, saying a hoarse word or two.</p>

  <p>Presently the conflict overhead, waxing and waning to an accompaniment of
  angry shouts, afforded another brief diversion to those within, and something
  persuaded the standing passengers to shove toward the door. The child had
  fallen asleep in the street-walker's arms. "Jinny!" cried the mother,
  reaching forth and shaking her. "Jinny! wake up now&mdash;you mustn't go to
  sleep." And she pulled the; little thing from her perch to where she had been
  standing.</p>

  <p>The bonnetless creature bent forward, and, in her curious voice (like that
  of one sick with shouting), "She can set on my knee, m'm, if she likes," she
  said; "she's tired."</p>

  <p>The mother busied herself with a jerky adjustment of the child's hat and
  shawl. "She mustn't go to sleep," was all she said, sharply, and without
  looking up.</p>

  <p>The hoarse woman bent further forward, with a propitiatory grin. "'Ow old
  is she?...I'd like to&mdash;give 'er a penny."</p>

  <p>The mother answered nothing; but drew the child close by the side of her
  knee, where a younger one was sitting, and looked steadily through the fore
  windows.</p>

  <p>The hoarse woman sat back, unquestioning and unresentful, and turned her
  eyes upon them that were crowding over the conductor; for the car was rising
  over Bow Bridge. Front and back they surged down from the roof, and the
  insides made for the door as one man. The big woman's neighbor rose, and let
  her fall over on the seat, whence, awaking with a loud grunt and an
  incoherent curse, she rolled after the rest. The conductor, clamant and
  bedevilled, was caught between the two pell-mells, and, demanding fares and
  gripping his satchel, was carried; over the footboard in the rush. The
  stramash overhead came tangled and swearing down the stairs, gaining volume
  and force in random punches as it came; and the crowd on the pavement
  streamed vocally toward a brightness at the bridge foot&mdash;the lights of
  the Bombay Grab.</p>

  <p>The woman with the children waited till the footboard was clear, and then,
  carrying one child and leading another (her marketings attached about her by
  indeterminate means), she set the two youngsters on the pavement, leaving the
  third on the step of the car. The harlot, lingering, lifted the child
  again&mdash;lifted her rather high&mdash;and set her on the path with the
  others. Then she walked away toward the Bombay Grab. A man in a blue serge
  suit was footing it down the turning between the public-house and the bridge
  with drunken swiftness and an intermittent stagger; and, tightening her
  shawl, she went in chase.</p>

  <p>The quiet mechanic stood and stretched himself, and took a corner seat
  near the door; and the tram-car, quiet and vacant, bumped on westward.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6"></a>THAT BRUTE SIMMONS.</h2>

  <p class="first">SIMMONS'S infamous behavior toward his wife is still matter
  for profound wonderment among the neighbors. The other women had all along
  regarded him as a model husband, and certainly Mrs. Simmons was a most
  conscientious wife. She toiled and slaved for that man, as any woman in the
  whole street would have maintained, far more than any husband had a right to
  expect. And now this was what she got for it. Perhaps he had suddenly gone
  mad.</p>

  <p>Before she married Simmons, Mrs. Simmons had been the widowed Mrs. Ford.
  Ford had got a berth as donkeyman on a tramp steamer, and that steamer had
  gone down with all hands off the Cape: a judgment, the widow woman feared,
  for long years of contumacy which had culminated in the wickedness of taking
  to the sea, and taking to it as a donkeyman&mdash;an immeasurable fall for a
  capable engine-fitter. Twelve years as Mrs. Ford had left her still
  childless, and childless she remained as Mrs. Simmons.</p>

  <p>As for Simmons, he, it was held, was fortunate in that capable wife. He
  was a moderately good carpenter and joiner, but no man of the world, and he
  wanted one. Nobody could tell what might not have happened to Tommy Simmons
  if there had been no Mrs. Simmons to take care of him. He was a meek and
  quiet man, with a boyish face and sparse, limp whiskers. He had no vices
  (even his pipe departed him after his marriage), and Mrs. Simmons had
  engrafted on him divers exotic virtues. He went solemnly to chapel every
  Sunday, under a tall hat, and put a penny&mdash;one returned to him for the
  purpose out of his week's wages&mdash;in the plate. Then, Mrs. Simmons
  overseeing, he took off his best clothes and brushed them with solicitude and
  pains. On Saturday afternoons he cleaned the knives, the forks, the boots,
  the kettles, and the windows, patiently and conscientiously. On Tuesday
  evenings he took the clothes to the mangling. And on Saturday nights he
  attended Mrs. Simmons in her marketing, to carry the parcels.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Simmons's own virtues were native and numerous. She was a wonderful
  manager. Every penny of Tommy's thirty-six or thirty-eight shillings a week
  was bestowed to the greatest advantage, and Tommy never ventured to guess how
  much of it she saved. Her ;cleanliness in housewifery was distracting to
  behold. She met Simmons at the front door whenever he came home, and then and
  there he changed his boots for slippers, balancing himself painfully on
  alternate feet on the cold flags. This was because she scrubbed the passage
  and doorstep turn about with the wife of the downstairs family, and because
  the stair-carpet was her own. She vigilantly supervised her husband all
  through the process of "cleaning himself" after work, so as to come between
  her walls and the possibility of random splashes; and if, in spite of her
  diligence, a spot remained to tell the tale, she was at pains to impress the
  fact on Simmons's memory, and to set forth at length all the circumstances of
  his ungrateful selfishness. In the beginning she had always escorted him to
  the ready-made clothes shop, and had selected and paid for his clothes: for
  the reason that men are such perfect fools, and shopkeepers do as they like
  with them. But she presently improved on that. She found a man selling cheap
  remnants at a street corner, and straightway she conceived the idea of making
  Simmons's clothes herself. Decision was one of her virtues, and a suit of
  uproarious check tweeds was begun that afternoon from the pattern furnished
  by an old one. More: it was finished by Sunday; when Simmons, overcome by
  astonishment; at the feat, was indued in it, and pushed off to chapel ere he
  could recover his senses. The things were not altogether comfortable, he
  found: the trousers clung tight against his shins, but hung loose behind his
  heels; and when he sat, it was on a wilderness of hard folds and seams. Also
  his waistcoat collar tickled his nape, but his coat collar went straining
  across from shoulder to shoulder; while the main garment bagged generously
  below his waist. Use made a habit of his discomfort, but it never reconciled
  him to the chaff of his shopmates; for as Mrs. Simmons elaborated successive
  suits, each one modelled on the last, the primal accidents of her design
  developed into principles, and grew even bolder and more hideously
  pronounced. It was vain for Simmons to hint&mdash;as hint he did&mdash;that
  he shouldn't like her to overwork herself, tailoring being bad for the eyes,
  and there was a new tailor's in the Mile End Road, very cheap, where..."Ho
  yus," she retorted, "you're very consid'rit I dessay sittin' there actin' a
  livin' lie before your own wife Thomas Simmons as though I couldn't see
  through you like a book. A lot you care about overworkin' me as long as
  <i>your</i> turn's served throwin' away money like dirt in the street on a
  lot o' swindlin' tailors an' me workin' an' slavin' 'ere to save a 'apenny
  an'; this is my return for it any one 'ud think you could pick up money in
  the 'orseroad an' I b'lieve I'd be thought better of if I laid in bed all day
  like some would that I do." So that Thomas Simmons avoided the subject, nor
  even murmured when she resolved to cut his hair.</p>

  <p>So his placid fortune endured for years. Then there came a golden summer
  evening when Mrs. Simmons betook herself with a basket to do some small
  shopping, and Simmons was left at home. He washed and put away the
  tea-things, and then he fell to meditating on a new pair of trousers,
  finished that day and hanging behind the parlor door. There they hung, in all
  their decent innocence of shape in the seat, and they were shorter of leg,
  longer of waist, and wilder of pattern than he had ever worn before. And as
  he looked on them the small devil of Original Sin awoke and clamored in his
  breast. He was ashamed of it, of course, for well he knew the gratitude he
  owed his wife for those same trousers, among other blessings. Still, there
  the small devil was, and the small devil was fertile in base suggestions, and
  could not be kept from hinting at the new crop of workshop gibes that would
  spring at Tommy's first public appearance in such things.</p>

  <p>"Pitch 'em in the dustbin!" said the small devil at last; "it's all
  they're fit for."</p>

  <p>Simmons turned away in sheer horror of his wicked self, and for a moment
  thought of washing the tea-things over again by way of discipline. Then he
  made for the back room, but saw from the landing that the front door was
  standing open, probably by the fault of the child downstairs. Now a front
  door standing open was a thing that Mrs. Simmons would <i>not</i> abide: it
  looked low. So Simmons went down, that she might not be wroth with him for
  the thing when she came back; and, as he shut the door, he looked forth into
  the street.</p>

  <p>A man was loitering on the pavement, and prying curiously about the door.
  His face was tanned, his hands were deep in the pockets of his unbraced blue
  trousers, and well back on his head he wore the high-crowned peaked cap
  topped with a knob of wool, which is affected by Jack ashore about the docks.
  He lurched a step nearer to the door, and "Mrs. Ford ain't in, is she?" he
  said.</p>

  <p>Simmons stared at him for a matter of five seconds, and then said,
  "Eh?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Ford as was, then&mdash;Simmons now, ain't it?"</p>

  <p>He said this with a furtive leer that Simmons neither liked nor
  understood.</p>

  <p>"No," said Simmons, "she ain't in now."</p>

  <p>"You ain't her 'usband, are ye?"</p>

  <p>"Yus."</p>

  <p>The man took his pipe from his mouth, and grinned silently and long.
  "Blimy," he said at length, "you look the sort o' bloke she'd
  like,"&mdash;and with that he grinned again. Then, seeing that Simmons made
  ready to shut the door, he put a foot on the sill and a hand against the
  panel. "Don't be in a 'urry, matey," he said, "I come 'ere t'ave a little
  talk with you, man to man, d'ye see?" And he frowned fiercely.</p>

  <p>Tommy Simmons felt uncomfortable, but the door would not shut, so he
  parleyed. "Wotjer want?" he asked. "I dunno you."</p>

  <p>"Then, if you'll excuse the liberty, I'll interdooce meself, in a manner
  of speaking." He touched his cap with a bob of mock humility. "I'm Bob Ford,"
  he said, "come back out o' kingdom-come, so to say. Me as went down with the
  <i>Mooltan</i>&mdash;safe dead five year gone. I come to see my wife."</p>

  <p>During this speech Thomas Simmons's jaw was dropping lower and lower. At
  the end of it he poked his fingers up through his hair, looked down at the
  mat, then up at the fanlight, then out into the street, then hard at his
  visitor. But he found nothing to say.</p>

  <p>"Come to see my wife," the man repeated. "So now we can talk it
  over&mdash;as man to man."</p>

  <p>Simmons slowly shut his mouth, and led the; way upstairs mechanically, his
  fingers still in his hair. A sense of the state of affairs sank gradually
  into his brain, and the small devil woke again. Suppose this man <i>was</i>
  Ford? Suppose he <i>did</i> claim his wife? Would it be a knock-down blow?
  Would it hit him out?&mdash;or not? He thought of the trousers, the
  tea-things, the mangling, the knives, the kettles, and the windows; and he
  thought of them in the way of a backslider.</p>

  <p>On the landing Ford clutched at his arm, and asked in a hoarse whisper:
  "'Ow long 'fore she's back?"</p>

  <p>"'Bout a hour, I expect," Simmons replied, having first of all repeated
  the question in his own mind. And then he opened the parlor door.</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Ford, looking about him, "you've bin pretty comf'table. Them
  chairs an' things"&mdash;jerking his pipe toward them&mdash;"was
  hers&mdash;mine that is to say, speaking straight, and man to man." He sat
  down, puffing meditatively at his pipe, and presently: "Well," he continued,
  "'ere I am agin, ol' Bob Ford dead an' done for&mdash;gawn down in the
  <i>Mooltan</i>. On'y I <i>ain't</i> done for, see?"&mdash;and he pointed the
  stem of his pipe at Simmons's waistcoat,&mdash;"I ain't done for, 'cause why?
  Cons'kence o' bein' picked up by a ol' German sailin'-'utch an' took; to
  'Frisco 'fore the mast. I've 'ad a few years o' knockin' about since then,
  an' now"&mdash;looking hard at Simmons&mdash;"I've come back to see my
  wife."</p>

  <p>"She&mdash;she don't like smoke in 'ere," said Simmons, as it were at
  random.</p>

  <p>"No, I bet she don't," Ford answered, taking his pipe from his mouth, and
  holding it low in his hand. "I know 'Anner. 'Ow d'you find 'er? Do she make
  ye clean the winders?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Simmons admitted uneasily, "I&mdash;I do 'elp 'er sometimes, o'
  course."</p>

  <p>"Ah! An' the knives too, I bet, an' the bloomin' kittles. I know.
  Wy"&mdash;he rose and bent to look behind Simmons's head&mdash;"s'elp me, I
  b'lieve she cuts yer 'air! Well, I'm damned! Jes' wot she would do, too."</p>

  <p>He inspected the blushing Simmons from divers points of vantage. Then he
  lifted a leg of the trousers hanging behind the door. "I'd bet a trifle," he
  said, "she made these 'ere trucks. Nobody else 'ud do 'em like that.
  Damme&mdash;they're wuss'n wot you're got on."</p>

  <p>The small devil began to have the argument all its own way. If this man
  took his wife back perhaps he'd have to wear those trousers.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Ford pursued, "she ain't got no milder. An' my davy, wot a
  jore!"</p>

  <p>Simmons began to feel that this was no longer; his business. Plainly,
  'Anner was this other man's wife, and he was bound in honor to acknowledge
  the fact. The small devil put it to him as a matter of duty.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Ford suddenly, "time's short an' this ain't business. I won't
  be 'ard on you, matey. I ought prop'ly to stand on my rights, but seein' as
  you're a well-meanin' young man, so to speak, an' all settled an' a-livin'
  'ere quiet an' matrimonual, I'll"&mdash;this with a burst of
  generosity&mdash;"damme, yus, I'll compound the felony, an' take me 'ook.
  Come, I'll name a figure, as man to man, fust an' last, no less an' no more.
  Five pound does it."</p>

  <p>Simmons hadn't five pounds&mdash;he hadn't even five pence&mdash;and he
  said so. "An' I wouldn't think for to come between a man an' 'is wife," he
  added, "not on no account. It may be rough on me, but it 's a dooty.
  <i>I'll</i> 'ook it."</p>

  <p>"No," said Ford hastily, clutching Simmons by the arm, "don't do that.
  I'll make it a bit cheaper. Say three quid&mdash;come, that's reasonable,
  ain't it? Three quid ain't much compensation for me goin' away
  forever&mdash;where the stormy winds do blow, so to say&mdash;an' never as
  much as seein' me own wife agin for better nor wuss. Between man an' man
  now&mdash;three quid; an' I'll shunt. That's fair, ain't it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course it's fair," Simmons replied ;effusively. "It's more'n fair:
  it's noble&mdash;downright noble, <i>I</i> call it. But I ain't goin' to take
  a mean advantage o' your good-'artedness, Mr. Ford. She's your wife, an' I
  oughtn't to 'a' come between you. I apologize. You stop an' 'ave yer proper
  rights. It's me as ought to shunt, an' I will." And he made a step toward the
  door.</p>

  <p>"'Old on," quoth Ford, and got between Simmons and the door; "don't do
  things rash. Look wot a loss it'll be to you with no 'ome to go to, an'
  nobody to look after ye, an' all that. It'll be dreadful. Say a
  couple&mdash;there, we won't quarrel, jest a single quid, between man an'
  man, an' I'll stand a pot out o' the money. You can easy raise a
  quid&mdash;the clock 'ud pretty nigh do it. A quid does it; an'
  I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a loud double-knock at the front door. In the East End a
  double-knock is always for the upstairs lodgers.</p>

  <p>"Oo's that?" asked Bob Ford apprehensively.</p>

  <p>"I'll see," said Thomas Simmons in reply, and he made a rush for the
  staircase.</p>

  <p>Bob Ford heard him open the front door. Then he went to the window, and,
  just below him, he saw the crown of a bonnet. It vanished, and borne to him
  from within the door there fell upon his ear the sound of a well-remembered
  female voice.</p>

  <p>"Where ye goin' now with no 'at?" asked the voice sharply.</p>

  <p>"Awright, 'Anner&mdash;there's&mdash;there's somebody upstairs to see
  you," Simmons answered. And, as Bob Ford could see, a man went scuttling down
  the street in the gathering dusk. And behold, it was Thomas Simmons.</p>

  <p>Ford reached the landing in three strides. His wife was still at the front
  door, staring after Simmons. He flung into the back room, threw open the
  window, dropped from the wash-house roof into the back-yard, scrambled
  desperately over the fence, and disappeared into the gloom. He was seen by no
  living soul. And that is why Simmons's base desertion&mdash;under his wife's
  very eyes, too&mdash;is still an astonishment to the neighbors.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7"></a>BEHIND THE SHADE.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE street was the common East End street&mdash;two
  parallels of brick pierced with windows and doors. But at the end of one,
  where the builder had found a remnant of land too small for another
  six-roomer, there stood an odd box of a cottage, with three rooms and a
  wash-house. It had a green door with a well-blacked knocker round the corner;
  and in the lower window in front stood a "shade of fruit"&mdash;a cone of
  waxen grapes and apples under a glass cover.</p>

  <p>Although the house was smaller than the others, and was built upon a
  remnant, it was always a house of some consideration. In a street like this
  mere independence of pattern gives distinction. And a house inhabited by one
  sole family makes a figure among houses inhabited by two or more, even though
  it be the smallest of all. And here the seal of respectability was set by the
  shade of fruit&mdash;a sign accepted in those parts. Now, when people keep a
  house to themselves, and keep it clean;; when they neither stand at the doors
  nor gossip across back-fences; when, moreover, they have a well-dusted shade
  of fruit in the front window; and, especially, when they are two women who
  tell nobody their business: they are known at once for well-to-do, and are
  regarded with the admixture of spite and respect that is proper to the
  circumstances. They are also watched.</p>

  <p>Still, the neighbors knew the history of the Perkinses, mother and
  daughter, in its main features, with little disagreement: having told it to
  each other, filling in the details when occasion seemed to serve. Perkins,
  ere he died, had been a shipwright; and this was when the shipwrights were
  the aristocracy of the workshops, and he that worked more than three or four
  days a week was counted a mean slave: it was long (in fact) before
  depression, strikes, iron plates, and collective blindness had driven
  shipbuilding to the Clyde. Perkins had labored no harder than his fellows,
  had married a tradesman's daughter, and had spent his money with freedom; and
  some while after his death his widow and daughter came to live in the small
  house, and kept a school for tradesmen's little girls in a back room over the
  wash-house. But as the School Board waxed in power, and the tradesmen's pride
  in regard thereunto waned, the attendance, never large, came down to twos;
  and threes. Then Mrs. Perkins met with her accident. A dweller in Stidder's
  Rents overtook her one night, and, having vigorously punched her in the face
  and the breast, kicked her and jumped on her for five minutes as she lay on
  the pavement. (In the dark, it afterwards appeared, he had mistaken her for
  his mother.) The one distinct opinion the adventure bred in the street was
  Mrs. Webster's, the Little Bethelite, who considered it a judgment for sinful
  pride&mdash;for Mrs. Perkins had been a Church-goer. But the neighbors never
  saw Mrs. Perkins again. The doctor left his patient "as well as she ever
  would be," but bedridden and helpless. Her daughter was a scraggy,
  sharp-faced woman of thirty or so, whose black dress hung from her hips as
  from a wooden frame; and some people got into the way of calling her Mrs.
  Perkins, seeing no other thus to honor. And meantime the school had ceased,
  although Miss Perkins essayed a revival, and joined a dissenting chapel to
  that end.</p>

  <p>Then, one day, a card appeared in the window, over the shade of fruit,
  with the legend "Pianoforte Lessons." It was not approved by the street. It
  was a standing advertisement of the fact that the Perkinses had a piano,
  which others had not. It also revealed a grasping spirit on the part of
  people able to keep a house; to themselves, with red curtains and a shade of
  fruit in the parlor window; who, moreover, had been able to give up keeping a
  school because of ill-health. The pianoforte lessons were eight-and-sixpence
  a quarter, two a week. Nobody was ever known to take them but the relieving
  officer's daughter, and she paid sixpence a lesson, to see how she got on,
  and left off in three weeks. The card stayed in the window a fortnight
  longer, and none of the neighbors saw the cart that came in the night and
  took away the old cabinet piano with the channelled keys, that had been
  fourth-hand when Perkins bought it twenty years ago. Mrs. Clark, the widow
  who sewed far into the night, may possibly have heard a noise and looked; but
  she said nothing if she did. There was no card in the window next morning,
  but the shade of fruit stood primly respectable as ever. The curtains were
  drawn a little closer across, for some of the children playing in the street
  were used to flatten their faces against the lower panes, and to discuss the
  piano, the stuff-bottomed chairs, the antimacassars, the mantelpiece
  ornaments, and the loo table with the family Bible and the album on it.</p>

  <p>It was soon after this that the Perkinses altogether ceased from
  shopping&mdash;ceased, at any rate, in that neighborhood. Trade with; them
  had already been dwindling, and it was said that Miss Perkins was getting
  stingier than her mother&mdash;who had been stingy enough herself. Indeed,
  the Perkins demeanor began to change for the worse, to be significant of a
  miserly retirement and an offensive alienation from the rest of the street.
  One day the deacon called, as was his practice now and then; but, being
  invited no further than the doorstep, he went away in dudgeon, and did not
  return. Nor, indeed, was Miss Perkins seen again at chapel.</p>

  <p>Then there was a discovery. The spare figure of Miss Perkins was seldom
  seen in the streets, and then almost always at night; but on these occasions
  she was observed to carry parcels, of varying wrappings and shapes. Once, in
  broad daylight, with a package in newspaper, she made such haste past a
  shop-window where stood Mrs. Webster and Mrs. Jones, that she tripped on the
  broken sole of one shoe, and fell headlong. The newspaper broke away from its
  pins, and although the woman reached and recovered her parcel before she
  rose, it was plain to see that it was made up of cheap shirts, cut out ready
  for the stitching. The street had the news the same hour, and it was
  generally held that such a taking of the bread out of the mouths of them that
  wanted it by them that had plenty; was a scandal and a shame, and ought to be
  put a stop to. And Mrs. Webster, foremost in the setting right of things,
  undertook to find out whence the work came, and to say a few plain words in
  the right quarter.</p>

  <p>All this while nobody watched closely enough to note that the parcels
  brought in were fewer than the parcels taken out. Even a hand-truck, late one
  evening, went unremarked: the door being round the corner, and most people
  within. One morning, though, Miss Perkins, her best foot foremost, was
  venturing along a near street with an outgoing parcel&mdash;large and
  triangular and wrapped in white drugget&mdash;when the relieving officer
  turned the corner across the way.</p>

  <p>The relieving officer was a man in whose system of etiquette the Perkinses
  had caused some little disturbance. His ordinary female acquaintances (not,
  of course, professional) he was in the habit of recognizing by a gracious
  nod. When he met the minister's wife he lifted his hat, instantly assuming an
  intense frown, in the event of irreverent observation. Now he quite felt that
  the Perkinses were entitled to some advance upon the nod, although it would
  be absurd to raise them to a level with the minister's wife. So he had long
  since established a compromise: he closed his finger and thumb upon the brim
  of his hat, and let his; hand fall forthwith. Preparing now to accomplish
  this salute, he was astounded to see that Miss Perkins, as soon as she was
  aware of his approach, turned her face, which was rather flushed, away from
  him, and went hurrying onward, looking at the wall on her side of the street.
  The relieving officer, checking his hand on its way to his hat, stopped and
  looked after her as she turned the corner, hugging her parcel on the side
  next the wall. Then he shouldered his umbrella and pursued his way, holding
  his head high, and staring fiercely straight before him; for a relieving
  officer is not used to being cut.</p>

  <p>It was a little after this that Mr. Crouch, the landlord, called. He had
  not been calling regularly, because of late Miss Perkins had left her five
  shillings of rent with Mrs. Crouch every Saturday evening. He noted with
  satisfaction the whitened sills and the shade of fruit, behind which the
  curtains were now drawn close and pinned together. He turned the corner and
  lifted the bright knocker. Miss Perkins half opened the door, stood in the
  opening, and began to speak.</p>

  <p>His jaw dropped. "Beg pardon&mdash;forgot something. Won't wait&mdash;call
  next week&mdash;do just as well;" and he hurried round the corner and down
  the street, puffing and blowing and; staring. "Why the woman frightened me,"
  he afterward explained to Mrs. Crouch. "There's something wrong with her
  eyes, and she looked like a corpse. The rent wasn't ready&mdash;I could see
  that before she spoke; so I cleared out."</p>

  <p>"P'r'aps something's happened to the old lady," suggested Mrs. Crouch.
  "Anyhow, I should think the rent 'ud be all right." And he thought it
  would.</p>

  <p>Nobody saw the Perkinses that week. The shade of fruit stood in its old
  place, but was thought not to have been dusted after Tuesday.</p>

  <p>Certainly the sills and the doorstep were neglected. Friday, Saturday, and
  Sunday were swallowed up in a choking brown fog, wherein men lost their
  bearings, and fell into docks, and stepped over embankment edges. It was as
  though a great blot had fallen, and had obliterated three days from the
  calendar. It cleared on Monday morning, and, just as the women in the street
  were sweeping their steps, Mr. Crouch was seen at the green door. He lifted
  the knocker, dull and sticky now with the foul vapor, and knocked a gentle
  rat-tat. There was no answer. He knocked again, a little louder, and waited,
  listening. But there was neither voice nor movement within. He gave three
  heavy knocks, and then came round to the front window. There was the shade of
  fruit, the glass; a little duller on the top, the curtains pinned close about
  it, and nothing to see beyond them. He tapped at the window with his
  knuckles, and backed into the roadway to look at the one above. This was a
  window with a striped holland blind and a short net curtain; but never a face
  was there.</p>

  <p>The sweepers stopped to look, and one from opposite came and reported that
  she had seen nothing of Miss Perkins for a week, and that certainly nobody
  had left the house that morning. And Mr. Crouch grew excited, and bellowed
  through the keyhole.</p>

  <p>In the end they opened the sash-fastening with a knife, moved the shade of
  fruit, and got in. The room was bare and empty, and their steps and voices
  resounded as those of people in an unfurnished house. The wash-house was
  vacant, but it was clean, and there was a little net curtain in the window.
  The short passage and the stairs were bare boards. In the back room by the
  stair-head was a drawn window-blind, and that was all. In the front room with
  the striped blind and the short curtain there was a bed of rags and old
  newspapers; also a wooden box; and on each of these was a dead woman.</p>

  <p>Both deaths, the doctor found, were from syncope, the result of inanition;
  and the ;better-nourished woman&mdash;she on the bed&mdash;had died the
  sooner; perhaps by a day or two. The other case was rather curious; it
  exhibited a degree of shrinkage in the digestive organs unprecedented in his
  experience. After the inquest the street had an evening's fame: for the
  papers printed coarse drawings of the house, and in leaderettes demanded the
  abolition of something. Then it became its wonted self. And it was doubted if
  the waxen apples and the curtains fetched enough to pay Mr. Crouch his
  fortnight's rent.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8"></a>THREE ROUNDS.</h2>

  <p class="first">AT six o'clock the back streets were dank and black; but
  once in the Bethnal Green Road, blots and flares of gas and naphtha shook and
  flickered till every slimy cobble in the cartway was silver-tipped. Neddy
  Milton was not quite fighting-fit. A day's questing for an odd job had left
  him weary in the feet; and a lad of eighteen cannot comfortably go unfed from
  breakfast to night-fall. But box he must, for the shilling was irrecoverable,
  and so costly a chance must not be thrown away. It was by a bout with the
  gloves that he looked to mend his fortunes. That was his only avenue of
  advancement. He could read and write quite decently, and in the beginning
  might even have been an office-boy, if only the widow, his mother, had been
  able to give him a good send-off in the matter of clothes. Also, he had had
  one chance of picking up a trade, but the firm already employed as many boys
  as the union was disposed to allow. So Neddy had to go, and pick up such
  stray jobs as he might.</p>

  <p>It had been a bad day, without a doubt. Things were bad generally. It was
  nearly a fortnight since Ned had lost his last job, and there seemed to be no
  other in the world. His mother had had no slop-waistcoat finishing to do for
  three or four days, and he distinctly remembered that rather less than half a
  loaf was left after breakfast; so that it would never do to go home, for at
  such a time the old woman had a trick of pretending not to be hungry, and of
  starving herself. He almost wished that shilling of entrance-money back in
  his pocket. There is a deal of stuff to be bought for a shilling: fried fish,
  for instance, whereof the aromas, warm and rank, met him thrice in a hundred
  yards, and the frizzle, loud or faint, sang in his ears all along the Bethnal
  Green Road. His shilling had been paid over but two days before the last job
  gave out, and it would be useful now. Still, the investment might turn out a
  gold mine. Luck must change. Meanwhile, as to being hungry&mdash;well, there
  was always another hole in the belt!</p>

  <p>The landlord of the Prince Regent public-house had a large room behind his
  premises, which, being moved by considerations of sport and profit in
  doubtful proportions, he devoted two nights a week to the uses of the Regent
  Boxing Club. Here Neddy Milton, through a; long baptism of pummellings, had
  learned the trick of a straight lead, a quick counter, and a timely duck; and
  here, in the nine-stone competition to open this very night, he might
  perchance punch wide the gates of Fortune. For some sporting publican, or
  discriminating book-maker from Bow, might see and approve his sparring, and
  start him fairly, with money behind him&mdash;a professional. That would mean
  a match in six or eight weeks' time, with good living in the mean while: a
  match that would have to be won, of course. And after that...!</p>

  <p>Twice before he had boxed in a competition. Once he won his bout in the
  first round, and was beaten in the second; and once he was beaten in the
  first, but that was by the final winner, Tab Rosser, who was now matched for
  a hundred a side, sparred exhibition bouts up west, wore a light Newmarket
  coat, and could stand whiskey and soda with anybody. To be "taken up" on the
  strength of these early performances was more than he could reasonably
  expect. There might be luck in the third trial; but he would like to feel a
  little fitter. Breakfast (what there was of it) had been ten hours ago, and
  since there had been but a half-pint of four-ale. It was the treat of a
  well-meaning friend, but it lay cold on the stomach for want of solid
  company.</p>

  <p>Turning into Cambridge Road, he crossed, and went on among the by-streets
  leading toward Globe Road. Now and again a slight aspersion of fine rain came
  down the gusts, and further damped his cap and shoulders and the ragged hair
  that hung over his collar. Also a cold spot under one foot gave him fears of
  a hole in his boot-sole as he tramped in the chilly mud.</p><br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>In the Prince Regent there were many at the bar, and the most of them knew
  Neddy.</p>

  <p>"Wayo, Ned," said one lad with a pitted face, "<i>you</i> don't look much
  of a bleed'n' champion. 'Ave a drop o' beer."</p>

  <p>Ned took a sparing pull at the pot, and wiped his mouth on his sleeve. A
  large man behind him guffawed, and Neddy reddened high. He had heard the
  joke. The man himself was one of the very backers that might make one's
  fortune, and the man's companion thought it would be unsafe to back Neddy to
  fight anything but a beefsteak.</p>

  <p>"You're drawed with Patsy Beard," one of Ned's friends informed him.
  "You'll 'ave to buck up."</p>

  <p>This was bad. Patsy Beard, on known form, stood best chance of winning the
  competition, and to have to meet him at first set-off was ill luck, and no
  mistake. He was a thickset little; butcher, and there was just the ghost of a
  hope that he might be found to be a bit over the weight.</p>

  <p>A lad by the bar looked inquiringly in Ned's face and then came toward
  him, shouldering him quietly out of the group. It was Sam Young, whom Neddy
  had beaten in an earlier competition. "'Ungry, Neddy?" he asked, in a
  corner.</p>

  <p>It was with a shamed face that Neddy confessed; for among those in peril
  of hunger it is disgraceful to be hungry. Sam unpocketed a greasy paper,
  enveloping a pallid sausage-roll. "'Ave 'alf o' this," he said. It was a
  heavy and a clammy thing, but Ned took it, furtively swallowed a large piece,
  and returned the rest with sheepish thanks. He did not turn again toward the
  others, but went through to the room where the ring was pitched.</p>

  <p>The proceedings began. First there were exhibition bouts, to play in the
  company. Neddy fidgeted. Why couldn't they begin the competition at once?
  When they did, his bout would be number five. That would mean at least an
  hour of waiting; and the longer he waited the less fit he would feel.</p>

  <p>In time the exhibition sparring was ended, and the real business began. He
  watched the early bouts feverishly, feeling unaccountably; anxious. The lads
  looked strong and healthy. Patsy Beard was as strong as any of them, and
  heavy. Could he stand it? This excited nervousness was new and difficult to
  understand. He had never felt like it before. He was almost trembling; and
  that lump of sausage-roll had stuck half-way, and made breathing painful
  work. Patsy Beard was at the opposite corner, surrounded by admirers. He was
  red-faced, well-fed, fleshy, and confident. His short hair clung shinily
  about his bullet head. Neddy noted a small piece of court-plaster at the side
  of his nose. Plainly there was a tender spot, and it must be gone for, be it
  cut, or scratch, or only pimple. On the left side, too, quite handy. Come,
  there was some comfort in that.</p>

  <p>He fell to watching the bout. It was a hard fight, and both the lads were
  swinging the right again and again for a knock-out. But the pace was too hot,
  and they were soon breathing like men about to sneeze, wearily pawing at each
  other, while their heads hung forward. Somebody jogged him in the back, and
  he found he must get ready. His dressing was simple. An ill-conditioned old
  pair of rubber gymnasium shoes replaced his equally ill-conditioned bluchers,
  and a cotton singlet his shirt; but his baggy corduroys, ragged at the ankles
  and doubtful at the seat, remained.</p>

  <p>Presently the last pair of boxers was brought into the dressing-room, and
  one of the seconds, a battered old pug with one eye, at once seized Neddy.
  "Come along, young 'un," he said. "I'm your bloke. Got no flannels? Awright.
  Jump on the scales."</p>

  <p>There was no doubt as to the weight. He had scaled at eight stone
  thirteen; now it was eight stone bare. Patsy Beard, on the other hand,
  weighed the full nine, without an ounce to spare.</p>

  <p>"You're givin' 'im a stone," said the old pug; "all the more credit 'idin'
  of 'im. 'Ere, let's shove 'em on. Feel 'em." He grinned and blinked his
  solitary eye as he pulled on Neddy's hand one of a very black and long-worn
  pair of boxing-gloves. They were soft and flaccid; Neddy's heart warmed
  toward the one-eyed man, for well he knew from many knocks that the softer
  the glove the harder the fist feels through it. "Sawftest pair in the place,
  s'elp me," grunted the second, with one glove hanging from his teeth. "My lad
  'ad 'em last time. Come on."</p>

  <p>He snatched a towel and a bottle of water, and hurried Neddy from the
  dressing-room to the ring. Neddy sat in his chair in the ring-corner, and
  spread his arms on the ropes: while his second, arms uplifted, stood before
  him and; ducked solemnly forward and back with the towel flicking overhead.
  While he was fanning, Neddy was still conscious of the lump of sausage-roll
  in his chest. Also he fell to wondering idly why they called Beard Patsy,
  when his first name was Joe. The same reflection applied to Tab Rosser, and
  Hocko Jones, and Tiggy Magson. But certainly he felt hollow and sick in the
  belly. Could he stand punching? It would never do to chuck it half through.
  Still&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ready!" sang the timekeeper.</p>

  <p>The old pug threw the towel over his arm. "'Ave a moistener," he said,
  presenting the water-bottle to Neddy's mouth. "Don't swaller any," he added,
  as his principal took a large gulp. "Spit it out."</p>

  <p>"Seconds out of the ring!"</p>

  <p>The old prize-fighter took his bottle and climbed through the ropes.
  "Don't go in-fightin'," he whispered from behind. "Mark 'im on the
  stickin'-plaster; an' if you don't give 'im a 'idin', bli' me, I'll give you
  one!"</p>

  <p>"Time!"</p>

  <p>The seconds seized the chairs and dragged them out of the ring, as the
  lads advanced and shook hands. Patsy Beard flung back his right foot, and
  made a flashy prance with his left knee as they began to spar for an opening:
  it; was Patsy's way. All Neddy's anxiety was gone. The moment his right foot
  dropped behind his left, and his left hand rocked, knuckles up, before him,
  he was a competent workman, with all his tools in order. Even the lump of
  dough on his chest he felt no more.</p>

  <p>"Buy, buy!" bawled a wag in the crowd, as a delicate allusion to Beard's
  more ordinary occupation. Patsy grinned at the compliment, but Neddy confined
  his attention to business. He feinted with his left, and got back; but Patsy
  was not to be drawn. Then Neddy stepped in and led quickly, ducking the
  counter and repeating before getting away. Patsy came with a rush and fought
  for the body, but Neddy slipped him, and got in one for nothing on the ear.
  The company howled.</p>

  <p>They sparred in the middle. Patsy led perfunctorily with the left now and
  again, while his right elbow undulated nervously. That foretold an attempt to
  knock out with the right: precautions, a straight and persistent left, and a
  wary eye. So Neddy kept poking out his left, and never lost sight of the
  court-plaster, never of the shifty right. Give and take was the order of the
  round, and they fought all over the ring, Patsy Beard making for close
  quarters, and Neddy keeping off, and stopping him with the left. Neddy met a
  straight punch on the nose; that made his eyes water, but through the tears
  he saw the plaster displaced, and a tiny stream of blood trickling toward the
  corner of Patsy's mouth. Plainly it was a cut. He broke ground, stopped
  half-way and banged in left and right. He got a sharp rive on the neck for
  his pains, and took the right on his elbow; but he had landed on the spot,
  and the tiny streak of blood was smeared out wide across Patsy's face. The
  company roared and whistled with enthusiasm. It was a capital rally.</p>

  <p>But now Neddy's left grew slower, and was heavy to lift. From time to time
  Patsy got in one for nothing, and soon began to drive him about the ring.
  Neddy fought on, weak and gasping, and longed for the call of time. His arms
  felt as if they were hung with lead, and he could do little more than push
  feebly. He heard the yell of many voices, "Now then, Patsy, hout him! 'Ave
  'im out! That's it, Patsy, another like that! Keep on, Patsy!"</p>

  <p>Patsy kept on. Right and left, above and below, Neddy could see the blows
  coming. But he was powerless to guard or to return. He could but stagger
  about, and now and again swing an ineffectual arm as it hung from the
  shoulder. Presently a flush hit on the nose drove him against the ropes,
  another in the ribs almost through them. But a desperate, wide; whirl of his
  right brought it heavily on Patsy's tender spot, and tore open the cut. Patsy
  winced, and&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Time!"</p>

  <p>Neddy was grabbed at the waist and put in his chair. "Good lad!" said the
  one-eyed pug in his ear as he sponged his face. "Nothink like pluck. But you
  mustn't go to pieces 'alf through the round. Was it a awk'ard poke
  upsetcher?"</p>

  <p>Neddy, lying back and panting wildly, shook his head as he gazed at the
  ceiling. "Awright; try an' save yourself a bit. Keep yer left goin'&mdash;you
  roasted 'im good with that; 'e'll want a yard o' plaster to-night. An' when
  'e gits leadin' loose, take it auf an' give him the right straight from the
  guard&mdash;if you know the trick. Point o' the jaw that's for, mind. 'Ave a
  cooler." He took a mouthful of water and blew it in a fine spray in Neddy's
  face, wiped it down, and began another overhead fanning.</p>

  <p>"Seconds out of the ring!" called the timekeeper.</p>

  <p>"Go it, my lad,"&mdash;thus a whisper from behind,&mdash;"you can walk
  over 'im!" And Neddy felt the wet sponge squeezed against the back of his
  neck, and the cool water trickling down his spine.</p>

  <p>"Time!"</p>

  <p>Neddy was better, though there was a worn feeling in his arm-muscles.
  Patsy's cut had been well sponged, but it still bled, and Patsy meant giving
  Neddy no rest. He rushed at once, but was met by a clean right-hander, slap
  on the sore spot. "Bravo, Neddy!" came a voice, and the company howled as
  before. Patsy was steadied. He sparred with some caution, twitching the cheek
  next the cut. Neddy would not lead (for he must save himself), and so the two
  sparred for a few seconds. Then Patsy rushed again, and Neddy got busy with
  both hands. Once he managed to get the right in from the guard as his second
  had advised, but not heavily. He could feel his strength going&mdash;earlier
  than in the last round&mdash;and Patsy was as strong and determined as ever.
  Another rush carried Neddy against the ropes, where he got two heavy body
  blows and a bad jaw-rattler. He floundered to the right in an attempt to
  slip, and fell on his face. He rolled on his side, however, and was up again,
  breathless and unsteady. There was a sickening throbbing in the crown of his
  head, and he could scarce lift his arms. But there was no respite: the other
  lad was at him again, and he was driven across the ring and back, blindly
  pushing his aching arms before him, while punch followed punch on nose, ears,
  jaws, and body, till something; began to beat inside his head, louder and
  harder than all beside, stunning and sickening him. He could hear the crowd
  roaring still, but it seemed further off; and the yells of "That's it, Patsy!
  Now you've got 'im! Keep at 'im! Hout 'im this time!" came from some other
  building close by, where somebody was getting a bad licking. Somebody with no
  control of his legs, and no breath to spit away the blood from his nose as it
  ran and stuck over his lips. Somebody praying for the end of the three
  minutes that seemed three hours, and groaning inwardly because of a lump of
  cold lead in his belly that had once been sausage-roll. Somebody to whom a
  few called&mdash;still in the other building&mdash;"Chuck it, Neddy; it's no
  good. Why don'cher chuck it?" while others said, "Take 'im away, tyke 'im
  away!" Then something hit him between the eyes, and some other thing behind
  the head; that was one of the posts. He swung an arm, but it met nothing;
  then the other, and it struck somewhere; and then there was a bang that
  twisted his head, and hard boards were against his face. O it was bad, but it
  was a rest.</p>

  <p>Cold water was on his face, and somebody spoke. He was in his chair again,
  and the one-eyed man was sponging him. "It was the call o' time as saved ye
  then," he said; "you'd never; 'a' got up in the ten seconds. Y' ain't up to
  another round, are ye? Better chuck it. It's no disgrace, after the way
  you've stood up." But Neddy shook his head. He had got through two of the
  three rounds, and didn't mean throwing away a chance of saving the bout.</p>

  <p>"Awright, if you won't," his Mentor said. "Nothink like pluck. But you're
  no good on points&mdash;a knock-out's the on'y chance. Nurse yer right, an'
  give it 'im good on the point. 'E's none so fresh 'isself; 'e's blowed with
  the work, an' you pasted 'im fine when you did 'it. Last thing, just before
  'e sent ye down, ye dropped a 'ot 'un on 'is beak. Didn't see it, didjer?"
  The old bruiser rubbed vigorously at his arms, and gave him a small, but
  welcome, drink of water.</p>

  <p>"Seconds out of the ring!"</p>

  <p>The one-eyed man was gone once more, but again his voice came from behind.
  "Mind&mdash;give it 'im 'ard and give it 'im soon, an' if you feel groggy,
  chuck it d'reckly. If ye don't, I'll drag ye out by the slack o' yer trousis
  an' disgrace ye."</p>

  <p>"Time!"</p>

  <p>Neddy knew there was little more than half a minute's boxing left in
  him&mdash;perhaps not so much. He must do his best at once. Patsy was showing
  signs of hard wear, and still blew; a little: his nose was encouragingly
  crimson at the nostrils, and the cut was open and raw. He rushed in with a
  lead which Neddy ducked and cross-countered, though ineffectually. There were
  a few vigorous exchanges, and then Neddy staggered back from a straight drive
  on the mouth. There was a shout of "Patsy!" and Patsy sprang in, right elbow
  all a-jerk, and flung in the left. Neddy guarded wildly, and banged in the
  right from the guard. Had he hit? He had felt no shock, but there was Patsy,
  lying on his face.</p>

  <p>The crowd roared and roared again. The old pug stuffed his chair hastily
  through the ropes, and Neddy sank into it, panting, with bloodshot eyes.
  Patsy lay still. The timekeeper watched the seconds-hand pass its ten points,
  and gave the word, but Patsy only moved a leg. Neddy Milton had won.</p>

  <p>"Brayvo, young 'un," said the old fighter, as he threw his arm about
  Neddy's waist, and helped him to the dressing-room. "Cleanest knock-out I
  ever see&mdash;smack on the point o' the jaw. Never thought you'd 'a' done
  it. I said there was nothink like pluck, did'n' I? 'Ave a wash now, an'
  you'll be all the better for the exercise. Give us them gloves&mdash;I'm off
  for the next bout." And he seized another lad, and marched him out.</p>

  <p>"'Ave a drop o' beer," said one of Neddy's new-won friends, extending a
  tankard. He took it, though he scarcely felt awake. He was listless and weak,
  and would not have moved for an hour had he been left alone. But Patsy was
  brought to, and sneezed loudly, and Neddy was hauled over to shake hands with
  him.</p>

  <p>"You give me a 'ell of a doin'," said Neddy, "<i>I</i> never thought I'd
  beat you."</p>

  <p>"Beat me? well you ain't, 'ave you? 'Ow?"</p>

  <p>"Knock-out," answered several at once.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm damned," said Patsy Beard...</p><br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>In the bar, after the evening's business, Neddy sat and looked wistfully
  at the stout red-faced men who smoked fourpenny cigars and drank special
  Scotch; but not one noticed him. His luck had not come after all. But there
  was the second round of bouts, and the final, in a week's time&mdash;perhaps
  it would come then. If he could only win the final&mdash;then it <i>must</i>
  come. Meanwhile he was sick and faint, and felt doubtful about getting home.
  Outside it was raining hard. He laid his head on the bar table at which he
  was sitting, and at closing time there they found him asleep.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9"></a>IN BUSINESS.</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was a great effervescence of rumor in Cubitt Town when
  Ted Munsey came into money. Ted Munsey, commonly alluded to as Mrs. Munsey's
  'usband, was a moulder with a regular job at Moffat's: a large, quiet man of
  forty-five, the uncomplaining appurtenance of his wife. This was fitting, for
  she had married beneath her, her father having been a dock timekeeper.</p>

  <p>To come into money is an unusual feat in Cubitt Town; a feat,
  nevertheless, continually contemplated among possibilities by all Cubitt
  Towners; who find nothing else in the Sunday paper so refreshing as the
  paragraphs headed "Windfall for a Cabman" and "A Fortune for a Pauper," and
  who cut them out to pin over the mantelpiece. The handsome coloring of such
  paragraphs was responsible for many bold flights of fancy in regard to Ted
  Munsey's fortune: Cubitt Town, left to itself, being sterile soil for the
  imagination. Some said that the Munseys had come in for chests packed with
  bank notes,; on the decease of one of Mrs. Munsey's relations, of whom she
  was wont to hint. Others put it at a street full of houses, as being the
  higher ideal of wealth. A few, more romantically given, imagined vaguely of
  ancestral lands and halls, which Mrs. Munsey and her forbears had been "done
  out of" for many years by the lawyers. All which Mrs. Munsey, in her hour of
  triumph, was at little pains to discount, although, in simple fact, the
  fortune was no more than a legacy of a hundred pounds from Ted's uncle, who
  had kept a public-house in Deptford.</p>

  <p>Of the hundred pounds Mrs. Munsey took immediate custody. There was no
  guessing what would have become of it in Ted's hands; probably it would have
  been, in chief part, irrecoverably lent; certainly it would have gone and
  left Ted a moulder at Moffat's, as before. With Mrs. Munsey there was neither
  hesitation nor difficulty. The obvious use of a hundred pounds was to put its
  possessors into business&mdash;which meant a shop; to elevate them socially
  at a single bound beyond the many grades lying between the moulder and the
  small tradesman. Wherefore the Munseys straightway went into business. Being
  equally ignorant of every sort of shopkeeping, they were free to choose the
  sort they pleased; and thus it was that Mrs.; Munsey decided upon drapery and
  haberdashery, Ted's contribution to the discussion being limited to a mild
  hint of greengrocery and coals, instantly suppressed as low. Nothing could be
  more genteel than drapery, and it would suit the girls. General chandlery,
  sweetstuff, oil, and firewood&mdash;all these were low, comparatively.
  Drapery it was, and quickly; for Mrs. Munsey was not wont to shilly-shally.
  An empty shop was found in Bromley, was rented, and was stocked as far as
  possible. Tickets were hung upon everything, bearing a very large main figure
  with a very small three-farthings beside it, and the thing was done. The
  stain of moulding was washed from the scutcheon; the descent thereunto from
  dock timekeeping was redeemed fivefold; dock timekeeping itself was left far
  below, with carpentering, shipwrighting, and engine-fitting. The Munseys were
  in business.</p>

  <p>Ted Munsey stood about helplessly and stared, irksomely striving not to
  put his hands in his pockets, which was low; any lapse being instantly
  detected by Mrs. Munsey, who rushed from all sorts of unexpected places and
  corrected the fault vigorously.</p>

  <p>"I didn't go for to do it, Marier," he explained penitently. "It's 'abit.
  I'll get out of it soon. It don't look well, I know, in a; business; but it
  do seem a comfort, somehow."</p>

  <p>"O you an' your comfort! A lot you study <i>my</i> comfort,
  Hedward!"&mdash;for he was Ted no more&mdash;"a-toilin' an' a-moilin' with
  everything to think of myself while you look on with your 'ands in your
  pockets. Do try an' not look like a stuck ninny, do!" And Hedward, whose
  every attempt at help or suggestion had been severely repulsed, slouched
  uneasily to the door, and strove to look as business-like as possible.</p>

  <p>"There you go again, stickin' in the doorway and starin' up an' down the
  street, as though there was no business doin'"&mdash;there was none, but that
  might not be confessed. "D'y' expect people to come in with you a-fillin' up
  the door? Do come in, do! You'd be better out o' the shop altogether."</p>

  <p>Hedward thought so too, but said nothing. He had been invested with his
  Sunday clothes of lustrous black, and brought into the shop to give such
  impression of a shop-walker as he might. He stood uneasily on alternate feet,
  and stared at the ceiling, the floor, or the space before him, with an
  unhappy sense of being on show and not knowing what was expected of him. He
  moved his hands purposelessly, and knocked things down with his elbows; he
  rubbed his hair all up behind, and furtively wiped the resulting; oil from
  his hand on his trousers: never looking in the least degree like a
  shop-walker.</p>

  <p>The first customer was a very small child who came for a ha'porth of pins,
  and on whom Hedward gazed with much interest and respect, while Mrs. Munsey
  handed over the purchase: abating not a jot of his appreciation when the
  child returned, later, to explain that what she really wanted was sewing
  cotton. Other customers were disappointingly few. Several old neighbors came
  in from curiosity, to talk and buy nothing. One woman, who looked at many
  things without buying, was discovered after her departure to have stolen a
  pair of stockings; and Hedward was duly abused for not keeping a sharp
  look-out while his wife's back was turned. Finally, the shutters went up on a
  day's takings of three and sevenpence farthing, including a most dubious
  threepenny bit. But then, as Mrs. Munsey said, when you are in business you
  must expect trade to vary; and of course there would be more customers when
  the shop got known; although Hedward certainly might have taken the trouble
  to find one in a busier thoroughfare. Hedward (whose opinion in that matter,
  as in others, had never been asked) retired to the back-yard to smoke a
  pipe&mdash;a thing he had been pining for all day; but was quickly recalled
  (the pipe being a clay) upon Mrs. Munsey's discovery that the; act could be
  observed from a neighbor's window. He was continually bringing the family
  into disgrace, and Mrs. Munsey despaired aloud over him far into the
  night.</p>

  <p>The days came and went, and trade varied, as a fact, very little indeed.
  Between three and sevenpence farthing and nothing the scope for fluctuation
  is small, and for some time the first day's record was never exceeded. But on
  the fifth day a customer bought nearly seven shillings' worth all at once.
  Her husband had that day returned from sea with money, and she, after months
  of stint, indulged in an orgie of haberdashery at the nearest shop. Mrs.
  Munsey was reassured. Trade was increasing; perhaps an assistant would be
  needed soon, in addition to the two girls.</p>

  <p>Only the younger of the girls, by the bye, had as yet taken any active
  interest in the business: Emma, the elder, spending much of her time in a
  bedroom, making herself unpresentable by inordinate blubbering. This was
  because of Mrs. Munsey's prohibition of more company-keeping with Jack Page.
  Jack was a plumber, just out of his time&mdash;rather a catch for a moulder's
  daughter, but impossible, of course, for the daughter of people in business,
  as Emma should have had the proper feeling to see for herself. This Emma had
  not: she wallowed in; a luxury of woe, exacerbated on occasions to poignancy
  by the scoldings and sometimes by the thumpings of her mar; and neglected
  even the select weekly quadrille class, membership whereof was part of the
  novel splendor.</p>

  <p>But there was never again a seven-shilling customer. The state of trade
  perplexed Mrs. Munsey beyond telling. Being in business, one must, by the
  circumstance, have a genteel competence: this was an elementary axiom in
  Cubitt Town. But where was the money? What was the difference between this
  and other shops? Was a screw loose anywhere? In that case it certainly could
  not be her fault; wherefore she nagged Hedward.</p>

  <p>One day a polite young man called in a large pony-trap and explained the
  whole mystery. Nobody could reasonably expect to succeed in a business of
  this sort who did not keep a good stock of the fancy aprons and lace bows
  made by the firm he was charged to represent. Of course he knew what business
  was, and that cash was not always free, but that need never hinder
  transactions with him: three months' credit was the regular thing with any
  respectable, well-established business concern, and in three months one would
  certainly sell all the fancy aprons and lace bows of this especial kind and
  price that one had room for. And he need; scarcely remind a lady of Mrs.
  Munsey's business experience that fancy aprons and lace bows&mdash;of the
  right sort&mdash;were by far the most profitable goods known to the trade.
  Everybody knew <i>that</i>. Should they say a gross of each, just to go on
  with? No? Well, then half a gross. These prices were cut so near that it
  really did not pay to split the gross, but this time, to secure a good
  customer, he would stretch a point. Mrs. Munsey was enlightened. Plainly the
  secret of success in business was to buy advantageously, in the way the
  polite young man suggested, sell at a good price, and live on the profits:
  merely paying over the remainder at the end of three months. Nothing could be
  simpler. So she began the system forthwith. Other polite young men called,
  and further certain profits were arranged for on similar terms.</p>

  <p>The weak spot in the plan was the absence of any binding arrangement with
  the general public; and this was not long in discovering itself. Nobody came
  to buy the fancy aprons and the lace bows, tempting as they might seem.
  Moreover, after they had hung a week or more, Alice reported that a large
  shop in the Commercial Road was offering, by retail, aprons and bows of
  precisely the same sort at a less price than the polite young man had charged
  for a wholesale purchase. Mrs. Munsey grew desperate,; and Hedward's life
  became a horror unto him. He was set to stand at the door with a fancy apron
  in one hand and a lace bow in the other, and capture customers as they
  passed: a function wherein he achieved detestable failure; alarming passing
  women (who considered him dangerously drunk) as greatly as his situation
  distressed himself.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Munsey grew more desperate, and drove Hedward to the rear of the
  house, with bitter revilings. Money must be got out of the stock somehow.
  That a shop could in any circumstances be unremunerative puzzled as much as
  it dismayed her. The goods were marked down to low prices&mdash;often lower
  than cost. Still Mrs. Munsey had the abiding conviction that the affair must
  pay, as others did, if only she might hold out long enough. Hedward's
  suggestion that he should return to the moulding, coming and going as little
  in sight as possible, she repelled savagely. "A nice notion you've got o'
  keepin' up a proper position. You ain't content with disgracin' me and
  yourself too, playin' the fool in the shop till trade's ruined an' nobody
  won't come near the place&mdash;an' I don't wonder at it...You're a nice sort
  of 'usband, I must say. What are you goin' to do now, with the business in
  this pretty mess, an' your wife an' children ready to starve? What; are you
  goin' to do? Where are you goin' to turn? That's what I want to know."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm a-thinkin' it out, Marier, in a legal point. P'r'aps, you know,
  my dear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't dear me! I 'ate a fool."</p>

  <p>Marked as low as they might be, none of the aprons nor the bows nor the
  towels nor the stockings nor any other of the goods were bought&mdash;never a
  thing beyond a ha'porth of thread or a farthing bodkin. Rent had to be paid,
  and even food cost money. There was a flavor of blank disappointment about
  Saturday&mdash;the pay day of less anxious times; and quarter day, when all
  these polite young men would demand the money that was not&mdash;that day was
  coming, black and soon. Mrs. Munsey grew more desperate than ever, sharp of
  feature, and aged. Alone, she would probably have wept. Having Hedward at
  hand, she poured forth her bitterness of spirit upon him; till at last he was
  nagged out of his normal stolidity, and there came upon his face the look of
  a bullock that is harried on all hands through unfamiliar streets.</p>

  <p>On a night when, from sheer weariness of soul, she fell from clatter
  toward sleep, of a sudden Hedward spoke. "Marier&mdash;" he said.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"You ain't give me a kiss lately. Kiss me now."</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool. I'm sick an' tired. Go to sleep, if you can sleep, with
  everything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Kiss me, I tell you!" He had never commanded like that before. She
  marvelled, feared a little, and obeyed.</p>

  <p>In the morning, when she awoke, he had already gone downstairs. This was
  as usual. When she followed, however, he was not to be found in the house.
  The shop shutters had been taken down, and the windows carefully cleaned,
  although it was not the regular window-cleaning day; but the door was shut.
  On the sitting-room table were two papers, one within the other. The first
  was written with many faults and smudges, and this was how it ran:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">"the deed and testiment of Ed. Munsey this is to cirtiffy
  that i make over all my property to my belov<sup>d</sup> wife stock bisness
  and furnitur so help me god all detts i keep to pay myself and my wife is not
  ansrable for them and certiffy that I O U Minchin and co 9 pound 4/7 Jones
  and son 6 pound 13/2 and settrer all other detts me and not my wife I O U<br>
  <br>

  <p>The other was a letter:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">"my dear wife i have done this legle dockerment after
  thinking it out it will make you alrite having all made over and me still
  oawe the detts not you as you can pull round the bisness as you said with

  will soon all be rich swels i know so no more from yours affec husband<br>
  <br>
  Ed. Munsey<br>
  <br>
  "love to Emma and Alice this one must be burnt keep the other"</p>

  <p>Near the papers lay Ted Munsey's large silver watch and chain, the silver
  ring that he used to fasten his best tie, three keys, and a few coppers.
  Upstairs the girls began to move about. Mrs. Munsey sat with her frightened
  face on the table.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>THE RED COW GROUP.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Red Cow Anarchist Group no longer exists. Its leading
  spirit appears no more among his devoted comrades, and without him they are
  ineffectual.</p>

  <p>He was but a young man, this leading spirit, (his name, by the bye, was
  Sotcher,) but of his commanding influence among the older but unlettered men
  about him, read and judge. For themselves, they had long been plunged in a
  beery apathy, neither regarding nor caring for the fearful iniquities of the
  social system that oppressed them. A Red Cow group they had always been,
  before the coming of Sotcher to make Anarchists of them: forgathering in a
  remote compartment of the Red Cow bar, reached by a side door in an alley; a
  compartment uninvaded and almost undiscovered by any but themselves, where
  night after night they drank their beer and smoked their pipes, sunk in a
  stagnant ignorance of their manifold wrongs. During the day Old Baker
  remained to garrison the stronghold. He was a long-bankrupt ;tradesman, with
  invisible resources and no occupation but this, and no known lodging but the
  Red Cow snuggery. There he remained all day and every day, "holding the
  fort," as he put it: with his nose, a fiery signal of possession, never two
  feet from the rim of his pot; while Jerry Shand was carrying heavy loads in
  Columbia Market; while Gunno Polson was running for a book-maker in Fleet
  Street; while Snorkey was wherever his instinct took him, doing whatever paid
  best, and keeping out of trouble as long as he could; and while the rest of
  the group&mdash;two or three&mdash;picked a living out of the London heap in
  ways and places unspecified. But at evening they joined Old Baker, and they
  filled their snuggery.</p>

  <p>Their talk was rarely of politics, and never of "social problems": present
  and immediate facts filled their whole field of contemplation. Their accounts
  were kept, and their references to pecuniary matters were always stated, in
  terms of liquid measure. Thus, fourpence was never spoken of in the common
  way: it was a quart, and a quart was the monetary standard of the community.
  Even as twopence was a pint, and eightpence was half-a-gallon.</p>

  <p>It was Snorkey who discovered Sotcher, and it was with Snorkey that that
  revolutionary appeared before the Red Cow group with his; message of
  enlightenment. Snorkey (who was christened something else that nobody knew or
  cared about) had a trick of getting into extraordinary and unheard-of places
  in his daily quest of quarts, and he had met Sotcher in a loft at the top of
  a house in Berners Street, Shadwell. It was a loft where the elect of
  Anarchism congregated nightly, and where everybody lectured all the others.
  Sotcher was a very young Anarchist, restless by reason of not being
  sufficiently listened to, and glad to find outsiders to instruct and to
  impress with a full sense of his sombre, mystic dare-devilry. Therefore he
  came to the Red Cow with Snorkey, to spread (as he said) the light.</p>

  <p>He was not received with enthusiasm, perhaps because of a certain
  unlaundered aspect of person remarkable even to them of the Red Cow group.
  Grease was his chief exterior characteristic, and his thick hair, turning up
  over his collar, seemed to have lain for long unharried of brush or comb. His
  face was a sebaceous trickle of long features, and on his hands there was a
  murky deposit that looked like scales. He wore, in all weathers, a long black
  coat with a rectangular rent in the skirt, and his throat he clipped in a
  brown neckerchief that on a time had been of the right Anarchist red. But no
  want of welcome could abash him. Here,; indeed, he had an audience, an
  audience that did not lecture on its own account, a crude audience that might
  take him at his own valuation. So he gave it to that crude audience, hot and
  strong. They (and he) were the salt of the earth, bullied, plundered and
  abused. Down with everything that wasn't down already. And so forth and so
  on.</p>

  <p>His lectures were continued. Every night it was the same as every other,
  and each several chapter of his discourse was a repetition of the one before.
  Slowly the Red Cow group came around. Plainly other people were better off
  than they; and certainly each man found it hard to believe that anybody else
  was more deserving than himself.</p>

  <p>"Wy are we pore?" asked Sotcher, leaning forward and jerking his extended
  palm from one to another, as though attempting a hasty collection. "I ask you
  straight, wy are we pore? Why is it, my frien's, that awften and awften you
  find you ain't got a penny in yer pocket, not for to git a crust o' bread or
  'alf a pint o' reasonable refreshment? 'Ow is it that 'appens? Agin I ask,
  'ow?"</p>

  <p>Snorkey, with a feeling that an answer was expected from somebody,
  presently murmured, "No mugs," which encouraged Gunno Polson to suggest,
  "Backers all stony-broke." Jerry; Shand said nothing, but reflected on the
  occasional result of a day on the loose. Old Baker neither spoke nor
  thought.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you, me frien's. It's 'cos o' the rotten state o' s'ciety. Wy
  d'you allow the lazy, idle, dirty, do-nothing upper classes, as they call
  'emselves, to reap all the benefits o' your toil wile you slave an' slave to
  keep 'em in lukshry an' starve yerselves? Wy don't you go an' take your
  shares o' the wealth lyin' round you?"</p>

  <p>There was another pause. Gunno Polson looked at his friends one after
  another, spat emphatically, and said, "Coppers."</p>

  <p>"Becos o' the brute force as the privileged classes is 'edged theirselves
  in with, that's all. Becos o' the paid myrmidons armed an' kep' to make
  slaves o' the people. Becos o' the magistrates an' p'lice. Then wy not git
  rid o' the magistrates an' p'lice? They're no good, are they? 'Oo wants 'em,
  I ask? 'Oo?"</p>

  <p>"They <i>are</i> a noosance," admitted Snorkey, who had done a little time
  himself. He was a mere groundling, and persisted in regarding the proceedings
  as simple conversation, instead of as an oration with pauses at the proper
  places.</p>

  <p>"Nobody wants 'em&mdash;nobody as is any good. Then don't 'ave 'em, me
  frien's&mdash;don't 'ave 'em! It all rests with you. Don't 'ave no
  ;magistrates nor p'lice, nor gover'ment, nor parliament, nor monarchy, nor
  county council, nor nothink. Make a clean sweep of 'em. Blow 'em up. Then
  you'll 'ave yer rights. The time's comin', I tell you. It's comin', take my
  word for it. Now you toil an' slave; then everybody'll 'ave to work w'ether
  'e likes it or not, and two hours work a day'll be all you'll 'ave to
  do."</p>

  <p>Old Baker looked a little alarmed, and for a moment paused in his
  smoking.</p>

  <p>"Two hours a day at most, that's all; an' all yer wants provided for, free
  an' liberal." Some of the group gave a lickerish look across the bar. "No
  a'thority, no gover'ment, no privilege, an' nothink to interfere. Free
  contrack between man an' man, subjick to free revision an' change."</p>

  <p>"Wot's that?" demanded Jerry Shand, who was the slowest convert.</p>

  <p>"Wy, that," Sotcher explained, "means that everybody can make wot
  arrangements with 'is feller-men 'e likes for to carry on the business of
  life, but nothink can't bind you. You chuck over the arrangement if it suits
  best."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Gunno Polson musingly, rotating his pot horizontally before him
  to stir the beer; "that 'ud be 'andy sometimes. They call it welshin'
  now."</p>

  <p>The light spread fast and free, and in a few nights the Red Cow group was
  a very promising little bed of Anarchy. Sotcher was at pains to have it
  reported at two places west of Tottenham Court Road and at another in Dean
  Street, Soho, that at last a comrade had secured an excellent footing with a
  party of the proletariat of East London, hitherto looked on as hopeless
  material. More: that an early manifestation of activity might be expected in
  that quarter. Such activity had been held advisable of late, in view of
  certain extraditions.</p>

  <p>And Sotcher's discourse at the Red Cow turned, lightly and easily, toward
  the question of explosives. Anybody could make them, he explained; nothing
  simpler, with care. And here he posed at large in the character of mysterious
  desperado, the wonder and admiration of all the Red Cow group. They should
  buy nitric acid, he said, of the strongest sort, and twice as much sulphuric
  acid. The shops where they sold photographic materials were best and cheapest
  for these things, and no questions were asked. They should mix the acids, and
  then add gently, drop by drop, the best glycerine, taking care to keep
  everything cool. After which the whole lot must be poured into water, to
  stand for an hour. Then a thick, yellowish, oily stuff would be found to have
  sunk to the; bottom, which must be passed through several pails of water to
  be cleansed: and there it was, a terrible explosive. You handled it with care
  and poured it on brick-dust or dry sand, or anything of that sort that would
  soak it up, and then it could be used with safety to the operator.</p>

  <p>The group listened with rapt attention, more than one pot stopping
  half-way on its passage mouthwards. Then Jerry Shand wanted to know if
  Sotcher had ever blown up anything or anybody himself.</p>

  <p>The missionary admitted that that glory had not been his. "I'm one o' the
  teachers, me frien's&mdash;one o' the pioneers that goes to show the way for
  the active workers like you. I on'y come to explain the principles an' set
  you in the right road to the social revolution, so as you may get yer rights
  at last. It's for you to act."</p>

  <p>Then he explained that action might be taken in two ways: either
  individually or by mutual aid in the group. Individual work was much to be
  preferred, being safer; but a particular undertaking often necessitated
  co-operation. But that was for the workers to settle as the occasion arose.
  However, one thing must be remembered. If the group operated, each man must
  be watchful of the rest; there must be no half measures, no timorousness; any
  comrade wavering, temporizing, or behaving in any way; suspiciously, must be
  straightway <i>suppressed</i>. There must be no mistake about that. It was
  desperate and glorious work, and there must be desperate and rapid methods
  both of striking and guarding. These things he made clear in his best
  conspirator's manner: with nods and scowls and a shaken forefinger, as of one
  accustomed to oversetting empires.</p>

  <p>The men of the Red Cow group looked at each other, and spat thoughtfully.
  Then a comrade asked what had better be blown up first. Sotcher's opinion was
  that there was most glory in blowing up people, in a crowd or at a theatre.
  But a building was safer, as there was more chance of getting away. Of
  buildings, a public office was probably to be preferred&mdash;something in
  Whitehall, say. Or a bank&mdash;nobody seemed to have tried a bank: he
  offered the suggestion now. Of course there were not many public buildings in
  the East End, but possibly the group would like to act in their own
  neighborhood: it would be a novelty, and would attract notice; the question
  was one for their own decision, independent freedom of judgment being the
  right thing in these matters. There were churches, of course, and the
  factories of the bloated capitalist. Particularly, he might suggest the
  gas-works close by. There was a large gasometer abutting on the street, and;
  probably an explosion there would prove tremendously effective, putting the
  lights out everywhere, and attracting great attention in the papers. That was
  glory.</p>

  <p>Jerry Shand hazarded a remark about the lives of the men in the gas-works;
  but Sotcher explained that that was a trivial matter. Revolutions were never
  accomplished without bloodshed, and a few casual lives were not to be weighed
  in the balance against the glorious consummation of the social upheaval. He
  repeated his contention, when some weaker comrade spoke of the chance of
  danger to the operator, and repeated it with a proper scorn of the
  soft-handed pusillanimity that shrank from danger to life and limb in the
  cause. Look at the glory, and consider the hundred-fold vengeance on the
  enemy in the day to come! The martyr's crown was his who should die at the
  post of duty.</p>

  <p>His eloquence prevailed: there were murmurs no more. "'Ere, tell us the
  name of the stuff agin," broke out Gunno Polson, resolutely, feeling for a
  pencil and paper. "Blimy, I'll make some to-morrer."</p>

  <p>He wrote down the name of the ingredients with much spelling. "Thick,
  yuller, oily stuff, ain't it, wot you make?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yus&mdash;an' keep it cool."</p>

  <p>The group broke up, stern and resolute, and; Sotcher strode to his home
  exultant, a man of power.</p><br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>For the next night or two the enthusiasm at the Red Cow was unbounded.
  There was no longer any questioning of principles or action&mdash;every man
  was an eager Anarchist&mdash;strong and devoted in the cause. The little
  chemical experiment was going on well, Gunno Polson reported, with confident
  nods and winks. Sotcher repeated his discourse, as a matter of routine, to
  maintain the general ardor, which had, however, to endure a temporary check
  as the result of a delicate inquiry of Snorkey's, as to what funds might be
  expected from head-quarters. For there were no funds, said Sotcher, somewhat
  surprised at the question.</p>

  <p>"Wot?" demanded Jerry Shand, opening his mouth and putting down his pipe:
  "ain't we goin' to get nothink for all this?"</p>

  <p>They would get the glory, Sotcher assured him, and the consciousness of
  striking a mighty blow at this, and that, and the other; but that was all.
  And instantly the faces of the group grew long.</p>

  <p>"But," said Old Baker, "I thought all you blokes always got somethink from
  the&mdash;the committee?"</p>

  <p>There was no committee, and no funds: there; was nothing but glory, and
  victory, and triumph, and the social revolution, and things of that kind. For
  a little, the comrades looked at each other awkwardly, but they soon regained
  their cheerfulness, with zeal no whit abated. The sitting closed with
  promises of an early gathering for the next night.</p>

  <p>But when the next night came Sotcher was later than usual. "Ullo," shouted
  Gunno Polson, as he entered, "'ere you are at last. We've 'ad to do important
  business without you. See," he added in a lower tone, "'ere's the stuff!" And
  he produced an old physic-bottle nearly full of a thick, yellowish fluid.</p>

  <p>Sotcher started back half a pace, and slightly paled. "Don't shake it," he
  whispered hoarsely. "Don't shake it, for Gawd's sake!...Wot&mdash;wotjer
  bring it 'ere for, like that? It's&mdash;it's awful stuff, blimy." He looked
  uneasily about the group, and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand.
  "I&mdash;I thought you'd git the job over soon as the stuff was ready...'Ere,
  my Gawd!" he squeaked under his breath, "don't put it down 'ard on the table
  like that. It's sich&mdash;sich awful stuff." He wiped his forehead again,
  and, still standing, glanced once more apprehensively round the circle of
  impassive faces. Then after a pause, he asked, with an effort,
  "Wot&mdash;wotjer goin' to do now?"</p>

  <p>"Blow up the bleed'n' gas-works, o' course," answered Gunno Polson
  complacently. "'Ere's a penn'orth o' silver sand, an' a 'bacca canister, an'
  some wire, an' a big cracker with a long touch-paper, so as to stick out o'
  the canister-lid. That ought to set it auf, oughtn't it? 'Ere, you pour the
  stuff over the sand, doncher?" And he pulled out the cork and made ready to
  mix.</p>

  <p>"'Old on&mdash;'old on&mdash;don't! Wait a bit, for Gawd's sake!" cried
  Sotcher, in a sweat of terror. "You&mdash;you dunno wot awful stuff it
  is&mdash;s'elp me, you don't! You&mdash;you'll blow us all up if you don't
  keep it still. Y&mdash;you'll want some&mdash;other things. I'll go
  an'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Jerry Shand stood grimly against the door. "This 'ere conspiracy'll
  'ave to be gawn through proper," he said. "We can't 'ave no waverers nor
  blokes wot want to clear out in the middle of it, and p'r'aps go an' tell the
  p'lice. Them sort we 'as to <i>suppress</i>, see? There's all the stuff
  there, me lad, an' you know it. Wot's more, it's you as is got to put it up
  agin the gas-works an' set it auf."</p>

  <p>The hapless Sotcher turned a yellower pallor and asked faintly, "Me? Wy
  me?"</p>

  <p>"All done reg'lar and proper," Jerry replied, "'fore you come. We voted
  it&mdash;by ballot, all square. If you'd 'a' come earlier you'd 'a' 'ad a
  vote yerself."</p>

  <p>Sotcher pushed at Jerry's shoulder despairingly. "I won't, I won't!" he
  gasped. "Lemme go&mdash;it ain't fair&mdash;I wasn't 'ere&mdash;lemme
  go!"</p>

  <p>"None o' yer shovin', young man," said Jerry severely. "None o' yer
  shovin', else I'll 'ave to punch you on the jore. You're a bleed'n' nice
  conspirator, you are. It's pretty plain we can't depend on you, an' you know
  wot that means,&mdash;eh? Doncher? You're one o' the sort as 'as to be
  suppressed, that's wot it means. 'Ere, 'ave a drink o' this 'ere beer, an'
  see if that can't put a little 'art in ye. You got to do it, so you may as
  well do it cheerful. Snorkey, give 'im a drink."</p>

  <p>But the wretched revolutionary would not drink. He sank in a
  corner&mdash;the furthest from the table where Gunno Polson was packing his
  dreadful canister&mdash;a picture of stupefied affright.</p>

  <p>Presently he thought of the bar&mdash;a mere yard of counter in an angle
  of the room, with a screen standing above it&mdash;and conceived a wild
  notion of escape by scrambling over. But scarce had he risen ere the watchful
  Jerry divined his purpose.</p>

  <p>"'Old 'im, Snorkey," he said. "Keep 'im in the corner. An' if 'e won't
  drink that beer, pour it over 'is 'ead."</p>

  <p>Snorkey obeyed gravely and conscientiously,; and the bedraggled Sotcher,
  cowed from protest, whined and sobbed desolately.</p>

  <p>When all was ready, Jerry Shand said: "I s'pose it's no good askin' you to
  do it willin', like a man?"</p>

  <p>"O, let me go, I&mdash;I ain't well&mdash;s'elp me, I ain't. I&mdash;I
  might do it wrong&mdash;an'&mdash;an'&mdash;I'm a&mdash;a teacher&mdash;a
  speaker; not the active branch, s'elp me. Put it auf&mdash;for
  to-night&mdash;wait till to-morrer. I ain't well an'&mdash;an' you're very
  'ard on me!"</p>

  <p>"Desp'rit work, desp'rit ways," Jerry replied laconically. "You're
  be'avin' very suspicious, an' you're rebellin' agin the orders o' the group.
  There's only one physic for that, ain't there, in the rules? You're got to be
  suppressed. Question is 'ow. We'll 'ave to kill 'im quiet somehow," he
  proceeded, turning to the group. "Quiet an' quick. It's my belief 'e's spyin'
  for the p'lice, an' wants to git out to split on us. Question is 'ow to do
  for 'im?"</p>

  <p>Sotcher rose, a staring spectre. He opened his mouth to call, but there
  came forth from it only a dry murmur. Hands were across his mouth at once,
  and he was forced back into the corner. One suggested a clasp-knife at the
  throat, another a stick in his neckerchief, twisted to throttling-point. But
  in the end it was settled that it would be simpler, and would; better destroy
  all traces, to despatch him in the explosion&mdash;to tie him to the
  canister, in fact.</p>

  <p>A convulsive movement under the men's hands decided them to throw more
  beer on Sotcher's face, for he seemed to be fainting. Then his pockets were
  invaded by Gunno Polson, who turned out each in succession. "You won't 'ave
  no use for money where you're goin'," he observed callously; "besides, it 'ud
  be blowed to bits an' no use to nobody. Look at the bloke at Greenwich, 'ow
  'is things was blowed away. 'Ullo! 'ere's two 'arf-crowns an' some tanners.
  Seven an' thrippence altogether, with the browns. This is the bloke wot
  'adn't got no funds. This'll be divided on free an' equal principles to 'elp
  pay for that beer you've wasted. 'Old up, ol' man! Think o' the glory.
  P'r'aps you're all right, but it's best to be on the safe side, an' dead
  blokes can't split to the coppers. An' you mustn't forget the glory. You 'ave
  to shed blood in a revolution, an' a few odd lives more or less don't
  matter&mdash;not a single damn. Keep your eye on the bleed'n' glory! They'll
  'ave photos of you in the papers, all the broken bits in a 'eap, fac-similiar
  as found on the spot. Wot a comfort that'll be!"</p>

  <p>But the doomed creature was oblivious&mdash;prostrate&mdash;a swooning
  heap. They ran a piece of; clothes-line under his elbows, and pulled them
  together tight. They then hobbled his ankles, and took him among them through
  the alley and down the quiet street, singing and shouting their loudest as
  they went, in case he might sufficiently recover his powers to call for help.
  But he did not, and there in the shadow, at the foot of the great gasometer,
  they flung him down with a parting kick and a barbarous knock on the head, to
  keep him quiet for those few necessary moments. Then the murderous canister,
  bound with wire, was put in place; the extruding touch-paper was set going
  with a match; and the Red Cow Anarchists disappeared at a run, leaving their
  victim to his fate. Presently the policeman on that beat heard a sudden
  report from the neighborhood of the gas-works, and ran to see what it might
  mean.</p><br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>The next morning Alfred Sotcher was charged at the Thames Police Court as
  a drunk and incapable. He had been found in a helpless state near the
  gas-works, and appeared to have been tied at the elbows and ankles by
  mischievous boys, who had also, it seemed, ignited a cracker near by where he
  lay. The divisional surgeon stated that he was called to the prisoner, and
  found him tearful and incoherent, and smelling strongly of drink. He
  complained of having; been assaulted in a public-house, but could give no
  intelligible account of himself. A canister found by his side appeared to
  contain a mixture of sand and castor oil, but prisoner could not explain how
  it came there. The magistrate fined him five shillings, with the alternative
  of seven days, and as he had no money he was removed to the cells.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>ON THE STAIRS.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE house had been "genteel." When trade was prospering in
  the East End, and the ship-fitter or block-maker thought it no shame to live
  in the parish where his workshop lay, such a master had lived here. Now, it
  was a tall, solid, well-bricked, ugly house, grimy and paintless in the
  joinery, cracked and patched in the windows: where the front door stood open
  all day long; and the womankind sat on the steps, talking of sickness and
  deaths and the cost of things; and treacherous holes lurked in the carpet of
  road-soil on the stairs and in the passage. For when eight families live in a
  house, nobody buys a door-mat, and the street was one of those streets that
  are always muddy. It smelt, too, of many things, none of them pleasant (one
  was fried fish); but for all that it was not a slum.</p>

  <p>Three flights up, a gaunt woman with bare forearms stayed on her way to
  listen at a door which, opening, let out a warm, fetid waft from a close
  sick-room. A bent and tottering old; woman stood on the threshold, holding
  the door behind her.</p>

  <p>"An' is 'e no better now, Mrs. Curtis?" the gaunt woman asked, with a nod
  at the opening.</p>

  <p>The old woman shook her head, and pulled the door closer. Her jaw waggled
  loosely in her withered chaps: "Nor won't be; till 'e's gone." Then after a
  certain pause, "'E's goin'," she said.</p>

  <p>"Don't doctor give no 'ope?"</p>

  <p>"Lor' bless ye, I don't want to ast no doctors," Mrs. Curtis replied, with
  something not unlike a chuckle. "I've seed too many on 'em. The boy's
  a-goin', fast; I can see that. An' then"&mdash;she gave the handle another
  tug, and whispered&mdash;"he's been called." She nodded amain. "Three seprit
  knocks at the bed-head las' night; an' I know what <i>that</i> means!"</p>

  <p>The gaunt woman raised her brows, and nodded. "Ah, well," she said, "we
  all on us comes to it some day, sooner or later. An' it's often a 'appy
  release."</p>

  <p>The two looked into space beyond each other, the elder with a nod and a
  croak. Presently the other pursued, "'E's been a very good son, ain't
  'e?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay, well enough son to me," responded the old woman, a little
  peevishly; "an' I'll 'ave 'im put away decent, though there's on'y the; Union
  for me after. I can do that, thank Gawd!" she added, meditatively, as chin on
  fist she stared into the thickening dark over the stairs.</p>

  <p>"When I lost my pore 'usband," said the gaunt woman, with a certain
  brightening, "I give 'im a 'ansome funeral. 'E was a Oddfeller, an' I got
  twelve pound. I 'ad a oak caufin an' a open 'earse. There was a kerridge for
  the fam'ly an' one for 'is mates&mdash;two 'orses each, an' feathers, an'
  mutes; an' it went the furthest way round to the cimitry. 'Wotever 'appens,
  Mrs. Manders,' says the undertaker, 'you'll feel as you're treated 'im
  proper; nobody can't reproach you over that.' An' they couldn't. 'E was a
  good 'usband to me, an' I buried 'im respectable."</p>

  <p>The gaunt woman exulted. The old, old story of Manders's funeral fell upon
  the other one's ears with a freshened interest, and she mumbled her gums
  ruminantly. "Bob'll 'ave a 'ansome buryin', too," she said. "I can make it
  up, with the insurance money, an' this, an' that. On'y I dunno about mutes.
  It's a expense."</p>

  <p>In the East End, when a woman has not enough money to buy a thing much
  desired, she does not say so in plain words; she says the thing is an
  "expense," or a "great expense."; It means the same thing, but it sounds
  better. Mrs. Curtis had reckoned her resources, and found that mutes would be
  an "expense." At a cheap funeral mutes cost half-a-sovereign and their
  liquor. Mrs. Manders said as much.</p>

  <p>"Yus, yus, 'arf-a-sovereign," the old woman assented. Within, the sick man
  feebly beat the floor with a stick. "I'm a-comin'," she cried shrilly; "yus,
  'arf-a-sovereign, but it's a lot, an' I don't see 'ow I'm to do it&mdash;not
  at present." She reached for the door-handle again, but stopped and added, by
  after-thought, "Unless I don't 'ave no plooms."</p>

  <p>"It 'ud be a pity not to 'ave plooms. I 'ad&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There were footsteps on the stairs: then a stumble and a testy word. Mrs.
  Curtis peered over into the gathering dark. "Is it the doctor, sir?" she
  asked. It was the doctor's assistant; and Mrs. Manders tramped up to the next
  landing as the door of the sick-room took him in.</p>

  <p>For five minutes the stairs were darker than ever. Then the assistant, a
  very young man, came out again, followed by the old woman with a candle. Mrs.
  Manders listened in the upper dark. "He's sinking fast," said the assistant.
  "He <i>must</i> have a stimulant. Dr. Mansell ordered port wine. Where is
  it?" Mrs. Curtis mumbled dolorously. "I tell you he <i>must</i> have; it," he
  averred with unprofessional emphasis (his qualification was only a month
  old). "The man can't take solid food, and his strength must be kept up
  somehow. Another day may make all the difference. Is it because you can't
  afford it?" "It's a expense&mdash;sich a expense, doctor," the old woman
  pleaded. "An' wot with 'arf-pints o' milk an'&mdash;" She grew inarticulate,
  and mumbled dismally.</p>

  <p>"But he must have it, Mrs. Curtis, if it's your last shilling: it's the
  only way. If you mean you absolutely haven't the money&mdash;" And he paused
  a little awkwardly. He was not a wealthy young man&mdash;wealthy young men do
  not devil for East End doctors&mdash;but he was conscious of a certain haul
  of sixpences at nap the night before; and, being inexperienced, he did not
  foresee the career of persecution whereon he was entering at his own expense
  and of his own motion. He produced five shillings: "If you absolutely haven't
  the money, why&mdash;take this and get a bottle&mdash;good: not at a
  public-house. But mind, <i>at once</i>. He should have had it before."</p>

  <p>It would have interested him, as a matter of coincidence, to know that his
  principal had been guilty of the selfsame indiscretion&mdash;even the amount
  was identical&mdash;on that landing the day before. But, as Mrs. Curtis said
  nothing; of this, he floundered down the stair and out into the wetter mud,
  pondering whether or not the beloved son of a Congregational minister might
  take full credit for a deed of charity on the proceeds of sixpenny nap. But
  Mrs. Curtis puffed her wrinkles, and shook her head sagaciously as she
  carried in her candle. From the room came a clink as of money falling into a
  teapot. And Mrs. Manders went about her business.</p>

  <p>The door was shut, and the stair a pit of blackness. Twice a lodger passed
  down, and up and down, and still it did not open. Men and women walked on the
  lower flights, and out at the door, and in again. From the street a shout or
  a snatch of laughter floated up the pit. On the pavement footsteps rang
  crisper and fewer, and from the bottom passage there were sounds of stagger
  and sprawl. A demented old clock buzzed divers hours at random, and was
  rebuked every twenty minutes by the regular tread of a policeman on his beat.
  Finally, somebody shut the street-door with a great bang, and the street was
  muffled. A key turned inside the door on the landing, but that was all. A
  feeble light shone for hours along the crack below, and then went out. The
  crazy old clock went buzzing on, but nothing left that room all night.
  Nothing that opened the door...</p>

  <p>When next the key turned, it was to Mrs. Manders's knock, in the full
  morning; and soon the two women came out on the landing together, Mrs. Curtis
  with a shapeless clump of bonnet. "Ah, 'e's a lovely corpse," said Mrs.
  Manders. "Like wax. So was my 'usband."</p>

  <p>"I must be stirrin'," croaked the old woman, "an' go about the insurance
  an' the measurin' an' that. There's lots to do."</p>

  <p>"Ah, there is. 'Oo are you goin' to 'ave,&mdash;Wilkins? I 'ad Wilkins.
  Better than Kedge, <i>I</i> think: Kedge's mutes dresses rusty, an' their
  trousis is frayed. If you was thinkin' of 'avin' mutes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yus, yus,"&mdash;with a palsied nodding,&mdash;"I'm a-goin' to 'ave
  mutes: I can do it respectable, thank Gawd!"</p>

  <p>"And the plooms?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, yus, and the plooms too. They ain't sich a great expense, after
  all."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>SQUIRE NAPPER.</h2>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p>Bill Napper was a heavy man of something between thirty-five and forty.
  His moleskin trousers were strapped below the knees, and he wore his coat
  loose on his back, with the sleeves tied across his chest. The casual
  observer set him down a navvy, but Mrs. Napper punctiliously made it known
  that he was "in the paving"; which meant that he was a pavior. He lived in
  Canning Town, and was on a footpath job at West Ham (Allen was the
  contractor) when he won and began to wear the nickname "Squire."</p>

  <p>Daily at the stroke of twelve from the neighboring church, Bill Napper's
  mates let drop rammer, trowel, spade, and pick, and turned toward a row of
  basins, tied in blue-and-red handkerchiefs, and accompanied of divers tin
  cans with smoky bottoms. Bill himself looked toward the street corner for the
  punctual Polly bearing his own dinner fresh and hot; for home; was not far,
  and Polly, being thirteen, had no school now.</p>

  <p>One day Polly was nearly ten minutes late. Bill, at first impatient, grew
  savage, and thought wrathfully on the strap on its nail by the
  kitchen-dresser. But at the end of the ten minutes Polly came, bringing a
  letter as well as the basin-load of beef and cabbage. A young man had left
  it, she said, after asking many ill-mannered questions. The letter was
  addressed "W. Napper, Esq.," with a flourish; the words, "By hand," stood in
  the corner of the envelope; and on the flap at the back were the embossed
  characters "T. &amp; N." These things Bill Napper noted several times over,
  as he turned the letter about in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Seems to me you'll 'ave to open it after all," said one of Bill's mates;
  and he opened it, setting back his hat as a preparation to serious study. The
  letter was dated from Old Jewry, and ran thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="cp">"<i>Re</i> B. Napper <i>deceased</i>.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Sir,&mdash;We have a communication in this matter
  from our correspondents at Sydney, New South Wales, in respect to
  testamentary dispositions under which you benefit. We shall be obliged if you
  can make it convenient to call; at this office any day except Saturday
  between two and four.&mdash;Your obedient servants,<br>
  <br>
  "Tims &amp; Norton."</p>

  <p>The dinner hour had gone by before the full inner meaning had been wrested
  from this letter. "B. Napper deceased" Bill accepted, with a little
  assistance, as an announcement of the death of his brother Ben, who had gone
  to Australia nearly twenty years ago, and had been forgotten. "Testamentary
  dispositions" nobody would tackle with confidence, although its distinct
  suggestion of biblical study was duly remarked. "Benefit" was right enough,
  and led one of the younger men, after some thought, to the opinion that Bill
  Napper's brother might have left him something: a theory instantly accepted
  as the most probable, although some thought it foolish of him not to leave it
  direct instead of authorizing the interference of a lawyer, who would want to
  do Bill out of it.</p>

  <p>Bill Napper put up his tools and went home. There the missis put an end to
  doubt by repeating what the lawyer's clerk said: which was nothing more
  definite than that Bill had been "left a bit"; and the clerk only
  acknowledged so much when he had satisfied himself, by sinuous questionings,
  that he had found the real legatee. He further advised the bringing of
  certain; evidence on the visit to the office. Thus it was plain that the
  Napper fortunes were in good case, for, as "a bit" means money all the world
  over, the thing was clearly no worthless keepsake.</p><br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p>On the afternoon of the next day, Bill Napper, in clean moleskins and
  black coat, made for Old Jewry. On mature consideration he had decided to go
  through it alone. There was not merely one lawyer, which would be bad enough,
  but two of them in a partnership; and to take the missis, whose intellects,
  being somewhat flighty, were quickly divertible by the palaver of which a
  lawyer was master, would be to distract and impede his own faculties. A male
  friend might not have been so bad, but Bill could not call to mind one quite
  cute enough to be of any use, and in any case such a friend would have to be
  paid for the loss of his day's work. Moreover, he might imagine himself to
  hold a sort of interest in the proceeds. So Bill Napper went alone.</p>

  <p>Having waited the proper time without the bar in the clerk's office, he
  was shown into a room where a middle-aged man sat at a ;writing-table. There
  was no other lawyer to be seen. This was a stratagem for which Bill Napper
  was not prepared. He looked suspiciously about the room, but without
  discovering anything that looked like a hiding-place. Plainly there were two
  lawyers, because their names were on the door and on the letter itself; and
  the letter said we. Why one should hide it was hard to guess, unless it were
  to bear witness to some unguarded expression. Bill Napper resolved to speak
  little, and not loud.</p>

  <p>The lawyer addressed him affably, inviting him to sit. Then he asked to
  see the papers that Bill had brought. These were an old testimonial reciting
  that Bill had been employed "with his brother Benjamin" as a boy in a
  brick-field, and had given satisfaction; a letter from a parish guardian, the
  son of an old employer of Bill's father, certifying that Bill was his
  father's son and his brother's brother; copies of the birth registry of both
  Bill and his brother, procured that morning; and a letter from Australia, the
  last word from Benjamin, dated eighteen years back. These Bill produced in
  succession, keeping a firm grip on each as he placed it beneath the lawyer's
  nose. The lawyer behaved somewhat testily under this restraint, but Bill knew
  better than to let the papers out of his possession, and would not be
  done.</p>

  <p>When he had seen all, "Well, Mr. Napper," said the lawyer, rather
  snappishly (obviously he was balked), "these things seem all right, and with
  the inquiries I have already made I suppose I may proceed to pay you the
  money. It is a legacy of three hundred pounds. Your brother was married, and
  I believe his business and other property goes to his wife and children. The
  money is intact, the estate paying legacy duty and expenses. In cases of this
  sort there is sometimes an arrangement for the amount to be paid a little at
  a time as required; that, however, I judge, would not be an arrangement to
  please you. I hope, at any rate, you will be able to invest the money in a
  profitable way. I will draw a check."</p>

  <p>Three hundred pounds was beyond Bill Napper's wildest dreams. But he would
  not be dazzled out of his caution. Presently the lawyer tore the check from
  the book, and pushed it across the table with another paper. He offered Bill
  a pen, pointing with his other hand at the bottom of the second paper, and
  saying, "This is the receipt. Sign just there, please."</p>

  <p>Bill took up the check, but made no movement toward the pen. "Receipt?" he
  grunted softly; "receipt wot for? I ain't 'ad no money."</p>

  <p>"There's the check in your hand&mdash;the same thing. It's an order to the
  bank to hand you; the amount&mdash;the usual way of paying money in business
  affairs. If you would rather have the money paid here, I can send a clerk to
  the bank to get it. Give me the check."</p>

  <p>But again Bill was not to be done. The lawyer, finding him sharper than he
  expected, now wanted to get this tricky piece of paper back. So Bill only
  grinned at him, keeping a good hold of the check. The lawyer lost his temper.
  "Why, damn it," he said, "you're a curious person to deal with. D'ye want the
  money and the check too?"</p>

  <p>He rang a bell twice, and a clerk appeared. "Mr. Dixon," said the lawyer,
  "I have given this person a check for three hundred pounds. Just take him
  round to the bank, and get it cashed. Let him sign the receipt at the bank. I
  suppose," he added, turning to Bill, "that you won't object to giving a
  receipt when you get the money, eh?"</p>

  <p>Bill Napper, conscious of his victory, expressed his willingness to do the
  proper thing at the proper time, and went out with the clerk. At the bank
  there was little difficulty, except at the clerk's advice to take the money
  chiefly in notes, which instantly confirmed Bill in a determination to accept
  nothing but gold. When all was done, and the three hundred sovereigns,
  carefully counted over for the third and fourth; time, were stowed in small
  bags about his person, Bill, much relieved after his spell of watchfulness,
  insisted on standing the clerk a drink.</p>

  <p>"Ah," he said, "all you City lawyers an' clurks are pretty bleed'n' sharp,
  I know, but you ain't done me, an' <i>I</i> don't bear no malice. 'Ave wot
  you like&mdash;'ave wine or a six o' Irish&mdash;I ain't goin' to be stingy.
  I'm goin' to do it open an' free, I am, an' set a example to men o'
  property."</p><br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p>Bill Napper went home in a hansom, ordering a barrel of beer on the way.
  One of the chief comforts of affluence is that you may have beer in by the
  barrel; for then Sundays and closing times vex not, and you have but to reach
  the length of your arm for another pot whenever moved thereunto. Nobody in
  Canning Town had beer by the barrel except the tradesmen, and for that Bill
  had long envied the man who kept shop. And now, at his first opportunity, he
  bought a barrel of thirty-six gallons.</p>

  <p>Once home with the news, and Canning Town was ablaze. Bill Napper had come
  in for three thousand, thirty thousand, three hundred ;thousand&mdash;any
  number of thousands that were within the compass of the gossip's command of
  enumeration. Bill Napper was called "W. Napper, Esq."&mdash;he was to be
  knighted&mdash;he was a long-lost baronet&mdash;anything. Bill Napper came
  home in a hansom&mdash;a brougham&mdash;a state coach.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Napper went that very evening to the Grove at Stratford to buy silk
  and satin, green, red, and yellow&mdash;cutting her neighbors dead, right and
  left. And by the next morning tradesmen had sent circulars and samples of
  goods. Mrs. Napper was for taking a proper position in society, and a house
  in a fashionable part&mdash;Barking Road, for instance, or even East India
  Road, Poplar; but Bill would none of such foolishness. He wasn't proud, and
  Canning Town was quite good enough for him. This much, though, he conceded:
  that the family should take a whole house of five rooms in the next street,
  instead of the two rooms and a cellule upstairs now rented.</p>

  <p>That morning Bill lit his pipe, stuck his hands in his pockets, and
  strolled as far as his job. "Wayo, squire," shouted one of the men as he
  approached. "'Ere comes the bleed'n' toff," remarked another.</p>

  <p>"'Tcheer, 'tcheer, mates," Bill responded, calmly complacent. "I'm a-goin'
  to wet it."; And all the fourteen men left their paving for the beer-house
  close by. The foreman made some demur, but was helpless, and ended by coming
  himself. "Now then, gaffer," said Bill, "none o' your sulks. No one ain't
  a-goin' to stand out of a drink o' mine&mdash;unless 'e wants to fight. As
  for the job&mdash;damn the job! I'd buy up fifty jobs like that 'ere and not
  stop for the change. You send the guv'nor to me if <i>'e</i> says anythink:
  unnerstand? You send 'im to <i>me</i>." And he laid hands on the foreman, who
  was not a big man, and hauled him after the others.</p>

  <p>They wetted it for two or three hours, from many quart pots. Then there
  appeared between the swing doors the wrathful face of the guv'nor.</p>

  <p>The guv'nor's position was difficult. He was only a small master, and but
  a few years back had been a working mason. This deserted job was his first
  for the parish, and by contract he was bound to end it quickly under penalty.
  Moreover, he much desired something on account that week, and must stand well
  with the vestry. On the other hand, this was a time of strikes, and the air
  was electrical. Several large and successful movements had quickened a spirit
  of restlessness in the neighborhood, and no master was sure of his men. Some
  slight was fancied, something was not done as it should; have been done from
  the point of view of the workshop, and there was a strike, picketing, and
  bashing. Now, the worst thing that could have happened to the guv'nor at this
  moment was one of those tiny, unrecorded strikes that were bursting out
  weekly and daily about him, with the picketing of his two or three jobs.
  Furious, therefore, as he was, he dared not discharge every man on the spot.
  So he stood in the door, and said: "Look here, I won't stand this sort of
  thing&mdash;it's a damn robbery. I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's all right, ol' cock," roared Bill Napper, reaching toward the
  guv'nor. "You come 'an 'ave a tiddley. I'm a bleed'n' millionaire meself now,
  but I ain't proud. What, you won't?"&mdash;for the guv'nor, unenthusiastic,
  remained at the door. "You're a sulky old bleeder. These 'ere friends o' mine
  are 'avin' 'arf a day auf at my expense: unnerstand? My expense. I'm a-payin'
  for their time, if you dock 'em; an' I can give <i>you</i> a bob, me fine
  feller, if you're 'ard up. See?"</p>

  <p>The guv'nor addressed himself to the foreman. "What's the meaning o' this,
  Walker?" he said. "What game d'ye call it?"</p>

  <p>Bill Napper, whom a succession of pots had made uproarious, slapped the
  foreman violently on the shoulder. "This 'ere's the gaffer," he; shouted.
  "'E's all right. 'E come 'ere 'cos 'e couldn't 'elp 'isself. I made 'im come,
  forcible. Don't you bear no spite agin' the gaffer, d'y' ear? 'E's my mate,
  is the gaffer; an' I could buy you up forty times, s'elp me&mdash;but I ain't
  proud. An' you're a bleed'n' gawblimy slackbaked..."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the guv'nor to the assembled company, but still ignoring
  Bill, "don't you think there's been about enough of this?"</p>

  <p>A few of the men glanced at one another, and one or two rose. "Awright,
  guv'nor," said one, "we're auf." And two more echoed, "Awright, guv'nor," and
  began to move away.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Bill Napper, with disgust, as he turned to finish his pot,
  "you're a blasted nigger-driver, you are. An' a sulky beast," he added as he
  set the pot down. "Never mind," he pursued, "<i>I'm</i> awright, an' I ain't
  a 'arf-paid kerb-whacker no more, under you."</p>

  <p>"You was a damn sight better kerb-whacker than you are a millionaire," the
  guv'nor retorted, feeling safer now that his men were getting back to
  work.</p>

  <p>"None o' your lip," replied Bill, rising and reaching for a pipe-spill:
  "none o' your lip, you work'us stone-breaker." Then, turning with a sudden
  access of fury, "I'll knock yer face off, blimy!" he shouted, and raised his
  fist.</p>

  <p>"Now, then, none o' that here, please," cried the landlord from behind the
  bar; unto whom Bill Napper, with all his wonted obedience in that quarter,
  answered only, "All right, guv'nor," and subsided.</p>

  <p>Left alone, he soon followed the master-pavior and his men through the
  swing doors, and so went home. In his own street, observing two small boys in
  the prelusory stages of a fight, he put up sixpence by way of stakes, and
  supervised the battle from the seat afforded by a convenient window-sill.
  After that he bought a morning paper, and lay upon his bed to read it, with a
  pipe and a jug; for he was beginning a life of leisure and comfort, wherein
  every day should be a superior Sunday.</p><br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p>Thus far the outward and visible signs of the Napper wealth were these:
  the separate house; the barrel of beer; a piano&mdash;not bought as a musical
  instrument, but as one of the visible signs; a daily paper, also primarily a
  sign; the bonnets and dresses of the missis; and the perpetual possession of
  Bill Napper by a varying degree of fuddlement. An inward and dissembled sign
  was a regiment, continually ;reinforced, of mostly empty bottles, in a
  cupboard kept sacred by the missis. And the faculties of that good lady
  herself experienced a fluctuating confusion from causes not always made plain
  to Bill: for the money was kept in the bedroom chest of drawers, and it was
  easy to lay hands on a half-sovereign as required without unnecessary
  disturbance.</p>

  <p>Now and again Bill Napper would discuss the abstract question of entering
  upon some investment or business pursuit. Land had its advantages; great
  advantages; and he had been told that it was very cheap just now, in some
  places. Houses were good, too, and a suitable possession for a man of
  consideration. Not so desirable on the whole, however, as Land. You bought
  your Land and&mdash;well there it was, and you could take things easily. But
  with Houses there was rent to collect, and repairs to see to, and so forth.
  It was a vastly paying thing for any man with capital to be a Merchant; but
  there was work even in that, and you had to be perpetually on guard against
  sharp chaps in the City. A public-house, suggested by one of his old mates on
  the occasion of wetting it, was out of the question. There was tick, and long
  hours, and a sharp look-out, and all kinds of trouble, which a man with money
  would be a fool to encounter. Altogether, perhaps, Land; seemed to be the
  thing: although there was no need to bother now, and plenty of time to turn
  things over, even if the matter were worth pondering at all, when it was so
  easy for a man to live on his means. After all, to take your boots off, and
  lie on the bed with a pipe and a pot and the paper was very comfortable, and
  you could always stroll out and meet a mate, or bring him in when so
  disposed.</p>

  <p>Of an evening the Albert Music Hall was close at hand, and the Queen's not
  very far away. And on Sundays and Saturday afternoons Bill would often take a
  turn down by the dock gates, or even in Victoria Park, or Mile End Waste,
  where there were speakers of all sorts. At the dock gates it was mostly Labor
  and Anarchy, but at the other places there was a fine variety; you could
  always be sure of a few minutes of Teetotalism, Evangelism, Atheism,
  Republicanism, Salvationism, Socialism, Anti-Vaccinationism, and Social
  Purity, with now and again some Mormonism or another curious exotic. Most of
  the speakers denounced something, and if the denunciations of one speaker
  were not sufficiently picturesque and lively, you passed on to the next.
  Indeed, you might always judge afar off where the best denouncing was going
  on by the size of the crowds, at least until the hat went round.</p>

  <p>It was at Mile End Waste that a good notion occurred to Bill Napper. He
  had always vastly admired the denunciations of one speaker&mdash;a little
  man, shabbier, if anything, than most of the others, and surpassingly
  tempestuous of antic. He was an unattached orator, not confining himself to
  any particular creed, but denouncing whatever seemed advisable, considering
  the audience and circumstances. He was always denouncing something somewhere,
  and was ever in a crisis that demanded the circulation of a hat. Bill
  esteemed this speaker for his versatility as well as for the freshness of his
  abuse, and Bill's sudden notion was to engage him for private addresses.</p>

  <p>The orator did not take kindly to the proposal at first, strongly
  suspecting something in the nature of "guy" or "kid"; but a serious assurance
  of a shilling for an occasional hour and the payment of one in advance
  brought him over. After this Squire Napper never troubled to go to Mile End
  Waste. He sat at ease in his parlor, with his pot on the piano, while the
  orator, with another pot on the mantelpiece, stood up and denounced to order.
  "Tip us the Teetotal an' Down-with-the-Public-'Ouse," Bill would request, and
  the orator (his name was Minns) would oblige in that line till most of the
  strong phrases had run out, and had begun to recur.; Then Bill would say,
  "Now come the Rights o' Labor caper." Whereupon Minns would take a pull at
  the pot, and proceed to denounce Capital, Bill Napper applauding or groaning
  at the pauses provided for those purposes. And so on with whatever subjects
  appealed to the patron's fancy. It was a fancy that sometimes put the
  orator's invention to grievous straits; but for Bill the whole performance
  was peculiarly privileged and dignified. For to have an orator gesticulating
  and speechifying all to one's self, on one's own order and choice of subject,
  is a thing not given to all men.</p>

  <p>One day Minns turned up (not having been invited) with a friend. Bill did
  not take to the friend. He was a lank-jawed man with a shifty eye, who smiled
  as he spoke, and showed a top row of irregular and dirty teeth. This friend,
  Minns explained, was a journalist&mdash;a writer of newspapers; and between
  them they had an idea, which idea the friend set forth. Everybody, he said,
  who knew the history of Mr. Napper admired his sturdy independence and
  democratic simplicity. He was of the people and not ashamed of it. ("Well,
  no, I ain't proud," Bill interjected, wondering what was coming.) With all
  the advantages of wealth, he preferred to remain one of the people, living
  among them plainly, conforming to their simple; habits, and sympathizing with
  their sorrows. ("This chap," thought Bill, "wants to be took on to hold forth
  turn about with the other, and he's showing his capers; but I ain't on it.")
  It was the knowledge of these things, so greatly to Mr. Napper's honor, that
  had induced Minns and Minns's friend to place before him a means by which he
  might do the cause of toiling humanity a very great service. A new weekly
  paper was wanted&mdash;wanted very badly: a paper that should rear its head
  on behalf of the downtrodden toilers, and make its mighty voice heard with
  dread by the bloated circles of Class and Privilege. That paper would prove a
  marvellously paying investment to its proprietor, bringing him enormous
  profits every week. He would have a vast fortune in that paper alone, besides
  the glory and satisfaction of striking the great blow that should pave the
  way to the emancipation of the Masses and the destruction of the vile system
  of society whose whole and sole effect was the accumulation of wealth in the
  hands of the Grasping Few. Being professionally disengaged at present, he
  (the speaker), in conjunction with his friend Minns, had decided to give Mr.
  Napper the opportunity of becoming its proprietor.</p>

  <p>Bill was more than surprised: he was also a little bewildered. "What," he
  said, after two; draws of his pipe, "d'ye mean you want me to go in the
  printin' line?"</p>

  <p>That was not at all necessary. The printing would be done by contract. Mr.
  Napper would only have to find the money. The paper, with a couple of
  thousand pounds behind it&mdash;or even one thousand (Minns's friend read a
  difficulty in Bill's face)&mdash;would be established forever. Even five
  hundred would do, and many successful papers had been floated with no more
  than a couple of hundred or so. Suppose they said just a couple of hundred to
  go on with, till the paper found its legs and began to pay? How would that
  do?</p>

  <p>Bill Napper smoked a dozen whiffs. Then he said: "An' what should I 'ave
  to do with the two 'undred pound? Buy anythink?"</p>

  <p>Not directly that, the promoters explained. It would finance the
  thing&mdash;just finance it.</p>

  <p>"'Oo'd 'ave the money then?"</p>

  <p>That was perfectly simple. It would simply be handed over to Minns and his
  friend, and they would attend to all the details.</p>

  <p>Bill Napper continued to smoke. Then, beginning with a slight chuckle at
  the back of his throat, he said: "W'en I got my money, I went to a lawyer's
  for it. There was two lawyers&mdash;one layin' low. There was two fust-rate
  lawyers an' a lot o' clurks&mdash;City clurks&mdash;an' a; bank an' all. An'
  they couldn't 'ave me, not for a single farden&mdash;not a farden, try an'
  fiddle as they would...Well, arter that, it ain't much good <i>you</i>
  a-tryin' it on, is it?" And he chuckled again, louder.</p>

  <p>Minns was indignant, and Minns's friend was deeply hurt. Both protested.
  Bill Napper laughed aloud. "Awright, you'll do," he said; "you'll do. My
  'abits may be simple, but they ain't as simple as all that. Ha&mdash;ha!
  'Ere, 'ave a drink&mdash;you ain't done no 'arm, an' I ain't spiteful.
  Ha&mdash;ha!"</p><br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>It was on an evening a fortnight after this that, as Bill Napper lay, very
  full of beer and rather sleepy, on the bed&mdash;the rest of his household
  being out of doors&mdash;a ladder was quietly planted against the outer wall
  from the back-yard. Bill heard nothing until the window, already a little
  open, was slowly pushed up, and from the twilight outside a head and an arm
  plunged into the thicker darkness of the room, and a hand went feeling along
  the edge of the chest of drawers by the window. Bill rolled over on the bed,
  and reached from the floor one of a pair of heavy iron-set boots. Taking the
  toe in his right hand, and grasping the footrail of the bedstead with his
  left, he raised himself on his knees, and brought the; boot-heel down heavily
  on the intruding head. There was a gasp, and the first breath of a yell, and
  head, arm, shoulders, and body vanished with a bump and a rattle. Bill Napper
  let the boot fall, dropped back on the bed, and took no further heed.</p>

  <p>Neither Minns nor his friend ever came back again, but for some time
  after, at Victoria Park, Minns, inciting an outraged populace to rise and
  sweep police and army from the earth, was able to point to an honorable scar
  on his own forehead, the proof and sign of a police bludgeoning at Tower
  Hill&mdash;or Trafalgar Square.</p><br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p>Things went placidly on for near ten months. Many barrels of beer had come
  in full and been sent empty away. Also the missis had got a gold watch and
  divers new bonnets and gowns, some by gift from Bill, some by applying
  privily to the drawer. Her private collection of bottles, too, had been
  cleared out twice, and was respectable for the third time. Everybody was not
  friendly with her, and one bonnet had been torn off her head by a neighbor
  who disliked her airs.</p>

  <p>So it stood when, on a certain morning, Bill being minded to go out, found
  but two shillings in his pocket. He called upstairs to the missis, as was his
  custom in such a pass, asking her to fetch a sovereign or two when she came
  down; and as she was long in coming, he went up himself. The missis left the
  room hurriedly, and Bill, after raking out every corner of the drawer (which
  he himself had not opened for some time) saw not a single coin. The missis
  had no better explanation than that there must have been thieves in the house
  some time lately: a suggestion deprived of some value by the subsequent
  protest that Bill couldn't expect money to last forever, and that he had had
  the last three days ago. In the end there was a vehement row, and the missis
  was severely thumped.</p>

  <p>The thumping over, Bill Napper conceived a great idea. Perhaps after all
  the lawyers had done him by understating the amount his brother had left. It
  might well have been five hundred pounds&mdash;a thousand
  pounds&mdash;anything. Probably it was, and the lawyers had had the
  difference. Plainly, three hundred pounds was a suspiciously small sum to
  inherit from a well-to-do brother. He would go to the lawyers and demand the
  rest of his money. He would not reveal his purpose till he saw the lawyers
  face to face, and then he would make his demand; suddenly, so that surprise
  and consternation should overwhelm and betray them. He would give them to
  understand that he had complete evidence of the whole swindle. In any case he
  could lose nothing. He went, after carefully preparing his part, and was
  turned out by a policeman.</p>

  <p>"After that," mused Squire Napper, going home, "I suppose I'd better see
  about getting a job at Allen's again. He can't but make me gaffer,
  considering I've been a man of property."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>"A POOR STICK."</h2>

  <p class="first">MRS. JENNINGS (or Jinnins, as the neighbors would have it)
  ruled absolutely at home, when she took so much trouble as to do anything at
  all there&mdash;which was less often than might have been. As for Robert, her
  husband, he was a poor stick, said the neighbors. And yet he was a man with
  enough of hardihood to remain a non-unionist in the erector's shop at
  Maidment's all the years of his service; no mean test of a man's fortitude
  and resolution, as many a sufferer for independent opinion might testify. The
  truth was that Bob never grew out of his courtship-blindness. Mrs. Jennings
  governed as she pleased, stayed out or came home as she chose, and cooked a
  dinner or didn't, as her inclination stood. Thus it was for ten years, during
  which time there were no children, and Bob bore all things uncomplaining:
  cooking his own dinner when he found none cooked, and sewing on his own
  buttons. Then of a sudden came children, till in three years there were
  three; and Bob ;Jennings had to nurse and to wash them as often as not.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Jennings at this time was what is called rather a fine woman: a woman
  of large scale and full development; whose slatternly habit left her coarse
  black hair to tumble in snake-locks about her face and shoulders half the
  day; who, clad in half-hooked clothes, bore herself notoriously and unabashed
  in her fulness; and of whom ill things were said regarding the lodger. The
  gossips had their excuse. The lodger was an irregular young cabinetmaker, who
  lost quarters and halves and whole days; who had been seen abroad with his
  landlady, what time Bob Jennings was putting the children to bed at home; who
  on his frequent holidays brought in much beer, which he and the woman shared,
  while Bob was at work. To carry the tale to Bob would have been a thankless
  errand, for he would have none of anybody's sympathy, even in regard to
  miseries plain to his eye. But the thing got about in the workshop, and there
  his days were made bitter.</p>

  <p>At home things grew worse. To return at half-past five, and find the
  children still undressed, screaming, hungry, and dirty, was a matter of
  habit: to get them food, to wash them, to tend the cuts and bumps sustained
  through; the day of neglect, before lighting a fire and getting tea for
  himself, were matters of daily duty. "Ah," he said to his sister, who came at
  intervals to say plain things about Mrs. Jennings, "you shouldn't go for to
  set a man agin 'is wife, Jin. Melier do'n' like work, I know, but that's
  nach'ral to 'er. She ought to married a swell 'stead o' me; she might 'a'
  done easy if she liked, bein' sich a fine gal; but she's good-'arted, is
  Melier; an' she can't 'elp bein' a bit thoughtless." Whereat his sister
  called him a fool (it was her customary good-by at such times), and took
  herself off.</p>

  <p>Bob Jennings's intelligence was sufficient for his common needs, but it
  was never a vast intelligence. Now, under a daily burden of dull misery, it
  clouded and stooped. The base wit of the workshop he comprehended less, and
  realized more slowly, than before; and the gaffer cursed him for a sleepy
  dolt.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Jennings ceased from any pretence of housewifery, and would sometimes
  sit&mdash;perchance not quite sober&mdash;while Bob washed the children in
  the evening, opening her mouth only to express her contempt for him and his
  establishment, and to make him understand that she was sick of both. Once,
  exasperated by his quietness, she struck at him; and for a moment he was
  another man. "Don't do that, Melier,"; he said, "else I might forget myself."
  His manner surprised his wife: and it was such that she never did do that
  again.</p>

  <p>So was Bob Jennings: without a friend in the world, except his sister, who
  chid him, and the children, who squalled at him: when his wife vanished with
  the lodger, the clock, a shade of wax flowers, Bob's best boots (which fitted
  the lodger), and his silver watch. Bob had returned, as usual, to the dirt
  and the children, and it was only when he struck a light that he found the
  clock was gone. "Mummy tooked ve t'ock," said Milly, the eldest child, who
  had followed him in from the door, and now gravely observed his movements.
  "She tooked ve t'ock an' went ta-ta. An' she tooked ve fyowers."</p>

  <p>Bob lit the paraffin lamp with the green glass reservoir, and carried it
  and its evil smell about the house. Some things had been turned over and
  others had gone, plainly. All Melier's clothes were gone. The lodger was not
  in, and under his bedroom window, where his box had stood, there was naught
  but an oblong patch of conspicuously clean wall-paper. In a muddle of doubt
  and perplexity, Bob found himself at the front door, staring up and down the
  street. Divers women-neighbors stood at their doors, and eyed him curiously;
  for Mrs. Webster, moralist, opposite, had not watched the day's; proceedings
  (nor those of many other days) for nothing, nor had she kept her story to
  herself.</p>

  <p>He turned back into the house, a vague notion of what had befallen
  percolating feebly through his bewilderment. "I dunno&mdash;I dunno," he
  faltered, rubbing his ear. His mouth was dry, and he moved his lips uneasily,
  as he gazed with aimless looks about the walls and ceiling. Presently his
  eyes rested on the child, and "Milly," he said decisively, "come an' 'ave yer
  face washed."</p>

  <p>He put the children to bed early, and went out. In the morning, when his
  sister came, because she had heard the news in common with everybody else, he
  had not returned. Bob Jennings had never lost more than two quarters in his
  life, but he was not seen at the workshop all this day. His sister stayed in
  the house, and in the evening, at his regular homing-time, he appeared,
  haggard and dusty, and began his preparations for washing the children. When
  he was made to understand that they had been already attended to, he looked
  doubtful and troubled for a moment. Presently he said: "I ain't found 'er
  yet, Jin; I was in 'opes she might 'a' bin back by this. I&mdash;I don't
  expect she'll be very long. She was alwis a bit larky, was Melier; but very
  good-'arted."</p>

  <p>His sister had prepared a strenuous lecture; on the theme of "I told you
  so"; but the man was so broken, so meek, and so plainly unhinged in his
  faculties, that she suppressed it. Instead she gave him comfortable talk, and
  made him promise in the end to sleep that night, and take up his customary
  work in the morning.</p>

  <p>He did these things, and could have worked placidly enough had he been
  alone; but the tale had reached the workshop, and there was no lack of
  brutish chaff to disorder him. This the decenter men would have no part in,
  and even protested against. But the ill-conditioned kept their way, till, at
  the cry of "Bell O!" when all were starting for dinner, one of the worst
  shouted the cruellest gibe of all. Bob Jennings turned on him and knocked him
  over a scrapheap.</p>

  <p>A shout went up from the hurrying workmen, with a chorus of "Serve ye
  right," and the fallen joker found himself awkwardly confronted by the shop
  bruiser. But Bob had turned to a corner, and buried his eyes in the bend of
  his arm, while his shoulders heaved and shook.</p>

  <p>He slunk away home, and stayed there: walking restlessly to and fro, and
  often peeping down the street from the window. When, at twilight, his sister
  came again, he had become almost cheerful, and said with some briskness, "I'm
  a-goin' to meet 'er, Jin, at seven. I know where she'll be waitin'."</p>

  <p>He went upstairs, and after a little while came down again in his best
  black coat, carefully smoothing a tall hat of obsolete shape with his
  pocket-handkerchief. "I ain't wore it for years," he said. "I ought to 'a'
  wore it&mdash;it might 'a' pleased 'er. She used to say she wouldn't walk
  with me in no other&mdash;when I used to meet 'er in the evenin', at seven
  o'clock." He brushed assiduously, and put the hat on. "I'd better 'ave a
  shave round the corner as I go along," he added, fingering his stubbly
  chin.</p>

  <p>He received as one not comprehending his sister's persuasion to remain at
  home; but when he went she followed at a little distance. After his penny
  shave he made for the main road, where company-keeping couples walked up and
  down all evening. He stopped at a church, and began pacing slowly to and fro
  before it, eagerly looking out each way as he went.</p>

  <p>His sister watched him for nearly half an hour, and then went home. In two
  hours more she came back with her husband. Bob was still there, walking to
  and fro.</p>

  <p>"'Ullo, Bob," said his brother-in-law; "come along 'ome an' get to bed,
  there's a good chap. You'll be awright in the mornin'."</p>

  <p>"She ain't turned up," Bob complained, "or else I've missed 'er. This is
  the reg'lar place&mdash;where I alwis used to meet 'er. But she'll; come
  to-morrer. She used to leave me in the lurch sometimes, bein' nach'rally
  larky. But very good-'arted, mindjer; very good-'arted."</p>

  <p>She did not come the next evening, nor the next, nor the evening after,
  nor the one after that. But Bob Jennings, howbeit depressed and anxious, was
  always confident. "Somethink's prevented 'er to-night," he would say, "but
  she'll come to-morrer...I'll buy a blue tie to-morrer&mdash;she used to like
  me in a blue tie. I won't miss 'er to-morrer. I'll come a little
  earlier."</p>

  <p>So it went. The black coat grew ragged in the service, and hobbledehoys,
  finding him safe sport, smashed the tall hat over his eyes time after time.
  He wept over the hat, and straightened it as best he might. Was she coming?
  Night after night, and night and night. But to-morrow...</p>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>A CONVERSION.</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE are some poor criminals that never have a chance:
  circumstances are against them from the first, as they explain, with tears,
  to sympathetic mission-readers. Circumstances had always been against Scuddy
  Lond, the gun. The word gun, it may be explained, is a friendly synonym for
  thief.</p>

  <p>His first name was properly James, but that had been long forgotten.
  "Scuddy" meant nothing in particular, was derived from nothing, and was not,
  apparently, the invention of any distinct person. Still, it was commonly his
  only name, and most of his acquaintances had also nicknames of similarly
  vague origin. Scuddy was a man of fine feelings, capable of a most creditable
  hour of rapturous misery after hearing, perhaps at a sing-song, "Put Me in my
  Little Bed," or any other ditty that was rank enough in sentiment: wherefore
  the mission-readers never really despaired of him. He was a small, shabby man
  of twenty-six, but looking younger; with a runaway chin, a sharp yellow;
  face, and tremulously sly eyes; with but faint traces of hair on his face, he
  had a great deal of it, straight and ragged and dirty, on his head.</p>

  <p>Scuddy Lond's misfortunes began early. Temptation had prevailed against
  him when he was at school, but that was nothing. He became errand boy in a
  grocer's shop, and complications with the till brought him, a howling
  penitent, to the police court. Here, while his mother hid her head in the
  waiting-room, he set forth the villainy of older boys who had prompted him to
  sin, and got away with no worse than a lecture on the evils of bad company.
  So that a philanthropist found him a better situation at a distance, where
  the evil influence could no longer move him. Here he stayed a good
  while&mdash;longer than some who had been there before him, but who had to
  leave because of vanishing postal orders. Nevertheless, the postal orders
  still went, and in the end he confessed to another magistrate, and fervently
  promised to lead a better life if his false start were only forgiven.
  Betting, he protested, was this time the author of his fall; and as that
  pernicious institution was clearly to blame for the unhappy young man's ruin,
  the lamenting magistrate let him off with a simple month in consideration of
  his misfortune and the intercession of his employer, who had never heard of
  the grocer and his till.</p>

  <p>After his month Scuddy went regularly into business as a lob-crawler: that
  is to say, he returned to his first love, the till: not narrowly to any
  individual till, but broad-mindedly to the till as a general institution, to
  be approached in unattended shops by stealthy grovelling on the belly. This
  he did until he perceived the greater security and comfort of waiting without
  while a small boy did the actual work within. From this, and with this, he
  ventured on peter-claiming: laying hands nonchalantly on unconsidered parcels
  and bags at railway stations, until a day when, bearing a fat portmanteau, he
  ran against its owner by the door of a refreshment bar. This time the
  responsibility lay with Drink. Strong Drink, he declared, with deep emotion,
  had been his ruin; he dated his downfall from the day when a false friend
  persuaded him to take a Social Glass; he would still have been an honest,
  upright, self-respecting young man but for the Cursed Drink. From that moment
  he would never touch it more. The case was met with three months with hard
  labor, and for all that Scuddy Lond had so clearly pointed out the
  culpability of Drink, he had to do the drag himself. But the mission-readers
  were comforted: for clearly there was hope for one whose eyes were so fully
  opened to the causes of his degradation.</p>

  <p>After the drag, Scuddy for long made a comfortable living, free from
  injurious overwork, in the several branches of lob-crawling and
  peter-claiming, with an occasional deviation into parlor-jumping. It is true
  that this last <i>did</i> sometimes involve unpleasant exertion when the
  window was high and the boy heavy to bunk up; and it was necessary, at times,
  to run. But Scuddy was out of work, and hunger drove him to anything, so long
  as it was light and not too risky. And it is marvellous to reflect how much
  may be picked up in the streets and at the side-doors of London and the
  suburbs without danger or vulgar violence. And so Scuddy's life went on, with
  occasional misfortunes in the way of a moon, or another drag, or perhaps a
  sixer. And the mission-readers never despaired, because the real cause was
  always hunger, or thirst, or betting, or a sudden temptation, or something
  quite exceptional&mdash;never anything like real, hardened, unblushing
  wickedness; and the man himself was always truly penitent. He made such
  touching references to his innocent childhood, and was so grateful for good
  advice or anything else you might give him.</p>

  <p>One bold attempt Scuddy made to realize his desire for better things. He
  resolved to depart from his evil ways and to become a nark&mdash;a copper's
  nark&mdash;which is a police spy, or ;informer. The work was not hard, there
  was no imprisonment, and he would make amends for the past. But hardly had he
  begun his narking when some of the Kate Street mob dropped on him in Brick
  Lane, and bashed him full sore. This would never do: so once more implacable
  circumstance drove him to his old courses. And there was this added
  discomfort: that no boy would parlor-jump nor dip the lob for him. Indeed
  they bawled aloud, "Yah, Scuddy Lond the copper's nark!" So that the hand of
  all Flower and Dean Street was against him. Scuddy grew very sad.</p>

  <p>These and other matters were heavy upon his heart on an evening when, with
  nothing in his pockets but the piece of coal that he carried for luck, he
  turned aimlessly up Baker's Row. Things were very bad: it was as though the
  whole world knew him&mdash;and watched. Shopkeepers stood frowningly at their
  doors. People sat defiantly on piles of luggage at the railway stations, and
  there was never a peter to touch for. All the areas were empty, and there
  were no side-doors left unguarded, where, failing the more desirable wedge,
  one might claim a pair or two of daisies put out for cleaning. All the
  hundred trifling things that commonly come freely to hand in a mile or two of
  streets were somehow swept out of the world's economy; and; Scuddy tramped
  into Baker's Row in melting mood. Why were things so hard for some and so
  easy for others? It was not as though he were to blame&mdash;he, a man of
  feeling and sentiment. Why were others living comfortable lives unvexed of
  any dread of the police? And apart from that, why did other gonophs get lucky
  touches for half a century of quids at a time, while he!...But there: the
  world was one brutal oppression, and he was its most pitiable victim; and he
  slunk along, dank with the pathos of things.</p>

  <p>At a corner a group was standing about a woman, whose voice was uplifted
  to a man's accompaniment on a stand-accordion. Scuddy listened. She sang,
  with a harsh tremble:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"An' sang a song of 'ome, sweet 'ome,<br>
  The song that reached my 'art.<br>
  'Ome, 'ome, sweet, sweet 'ome,<br>
  She sang the song of 'ome, sweet 'ome,<br>
  The song that reached my 'art."</p>

  <p>Here, indeed, was something in tune with Scuddy's fine feelings. He looked
  up. From the darkening sky the evening star winked through the smoke from a
  factory chimney. From anear came an exquisite scent of saveloys. Plaintive
  influences all. He tried to think of 'ome himself&mdash;of 'ome strictly in
  the abstract, so that it might reach his 'art. He; stood for some minutes
  torpid and mindless, oozing with sentiment: till the song ended, and he went
  on. Fine feelings&mdash;fine.</p>

  <p>He crossed the road, and took a turning. A lame old woman sat in a recess
  selling trotters, where a dark passage led back to a mission-hall. About the
  opening a man hovered&mdash;fervent, watchful&mdash;and darted forth on
  passers-by. He laid his hand on Scuddy's shoulder, and said: "My dear friend,
  will you come in an' 'ear the word of the Lord Jesus Christ?"</p>

  <p>Scuddy turned: the sound of an harmonium and many strenuous voices came
  faintly down the passage. It was his mood. Why not give his fine feelings
  another little run? He would: he would go in.</p>

  <p>"Trotters!" quavered the lame old woman, looking up wistfully. "Two a
  penny! Two a penny!" But no: he went up the passage, and she turned patiently
  to her board.</p>

  <p>Along the passage the singing grew louder, and burst on his ears unchecked
  as he pushed open the door at the end:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"'Oosoever will, 'oosoever will,<br>
  Send the proclamation over vale an' 'ill;<br>
  'Tis a lovin' Father calls the wand'rer 'ome,<br>
  'Oosoever will may come!"</p>

  <p>A man by the door knew him at once for a stranger, and found him a seat.
  The hymn; went quavering to an end, and the preacher in charge, a small,
  bright-eyed man with rebellious hair and a surprisingly deep voice, announced
  that Brother Spyers would offer a prayer.</p>

  <p>The man prayed with his every faculty. He was a sturdy, red-necked
  artisan, great of hand and wiry of beard: a smith, perhaps, or a bricklayer.
  He spread his arms wide, and, his head thrown back, brought forth, with
  passion and pain, his fervid, disordered sentences. As he went on, his throat
  swelled and convulsed in desperate knots, and the sweat hung thick on his
  face. He called for grace, that every unsaved soul there might come to the
  fold and believe that night. Or if not all, then some&mdash;even a few. That
  at least one, only one, poor soul might be plucked as a brand from the
  burning. And as he flung together, with clumsy travail, his endless,
  formless, unconsidered vehemences of uttermost Cockney, the man stood
  transfigured, admirable.</p>

  <p>From here and there came deep amens. Then more, with gasps, groans, and
  sobs. Scuddy Lond, carried away luxuriously on a tide of grievous sensation,
  groaned with the others. The prayer ended in a chorus of ejaculations. Then
  there was a hymn. Somebody stuffed an open hymn-book into Scuddy's hand, but
  he scarce saw it. Abandoning himself to the ;mesmeric influence of the many
  who were singing about him, he plunged and revelled in a debauch of emotion.
  He heard, he even joined in; but understood nothing, for his feelings filled
  him to overflowing.</p>

  <p class="poem">"I 'ave a robe: 'tis resplendent in w'iteness,<br>
  Awaitin' in glory my wonderin' view:<br>
  Oh, w'en I receive it, all shinin' in brightness,<br>
  Dear friend, could I see you receivin' one too!<br>
  For you I am prayin'! For you I am prayin'!<br>
  For you I am prayin', I'm prayin' for you."</p>

  <p>The hymn ceased; all sat down, and the preacher began his discourse:
  quietly at first, and then, though in a different way, with all the choking
  fervor of the man who had prayed. For the preacher was fluent as well as
  zealous, and his words, except when emotion stayed them, poured in a torrent.
  He preached faith&mdash;salvation in faith&mdash;declaiming, beseeching,
  commanding. "Come&mdash;come! Now is the appointed time! Only
  believe&mdash;only come! Only&mdash;only come!" To impassioned, broken
  entreaty he added sudden command and the menace of eternity, but broke away
  pitifully again in urgent pleadings, pantings, gasps; pointing above,
  spreading his arms abroad, stretching them forth imploringly. Come, only
  come!</p>

  <p>Sobs broke out in more than one place. A woman bowed her head and rocked,
  while her; shoulders shook again. Brother Spyers's face was alight with joy.
  A tremor, a throe of the senses, ran through the assembly as through a single
  body.</p>

  <p>The preacher, nearing his peroration, rose to a last frenzy of adjuration.
  Then, ending in a steadier key, he summoned any to stand forth who had found
  grace that night.</p>

  <p>His bright, strenuous eyes were on the sobbers, charging them, drawing
  them. First rose the woman who had bowed her head. Her face uncovered but
  distorted and twitching, still weeping but rapt and unashamed, she tottered
  out between the seats, and sank at last on the vacant form in front. Next a
  child, a little maid of ten, lank-legged and outgrown of her short skirts,
  her eyes squeezed down on a tight knot of pocket-handkerchief, crying wildly,
  broken-heartedly, sobbed and blundered over seat-corners and toes, and sat
  down, forlorn and solitary, at the other end of the form. And after her came
  Scuddy Lond.</p>

  <p>Why, he knew not&mdash;nor cared. In the full enjoyment of a surfeit of
  indefinite emotion, tearful, rapturous, he had accepted the command put on
  him by the preacher, and he had come forth, walking on clouds, regenerate,
  compact of fine feelings. There was a short prayer of thanks, and then a
  final hymn:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"Ring the bells of 'eaven, there is joy to-day,<br>
  For a soul returnin' from the wild!"</p>

  <p>Scuddy felt a curious equable lightness of spirits&mdash;a serene
  cheerfulness. His emotional orgasm was spent, and in its place was a numb
  calm, pleasant enough.</p>

  <p class="poem">"Glory! glory! 'ow the angels sing&mdash;<br>
  Glory! glory! 'ow the loud 'arps ring!<br>
  'Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea,<br>
  Pealin' forth the anthem of the free!"</p>

  <p>The service ended. The congregation trooped forth into the evening; but
  Scuddy sat where he was, for the preacher wanted a few words with his
  converts ere he would let them go. He shook hands with Scuddy Lond, and spoke
  with grave, smiling confidence about his soul. Brother Spyers also shook
  hands with him and bespoke his return on Sunday.</p>

  <p>In the cool air of the empty passage, Scuddy's ordinary faculties began to
  assert themselves; still in an atmosphere of calm cheer. Fine
  feelings&mdash;fine. And as he turned the piece of coal in his pocket, he
  reflected that, after all, the day had not been altogether unlucky&mdash;not
  in every sense a blank. Emerging into the street, he saw that the lame old
  woman, who was almost alone in view, had risen on her crutch and turned her
  back to roll her white; cloth over her remaining trotters. On the ledge
  behind stood her little pile of coppers, just reckoned. Scuddy Lond's
  practised eye took the case in a flash. With two long tip-toed steps he
  reached the coppers, lifted them silently, and hurried away up the street. He
  did not run, for the woman was lame and had not heard him. No: decidedly the
  day had not been blank. For here was a hot supper.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>"ALL THAT MESSUAGE."</h2>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">"ALL that messuage dwelling-house and premises now standing
  on part of the said parcel of ground" was the phrase in the assignment of
  lease, although it only meant Number Twenty-seven Mulberry Street, Old Ford,
  containing five rooms and a wash-house, and sharing a dirty front wall with
  the rest of the street on the same side. The phrase was a very fine one, and,
  with others more intricate, lent not a little to the triumph and the
  perplexity the transaction filled old Jack Randall withal. The business was a
  conjunction of purchase and mortgage, whereby old Jack Randall, having thirty
  pounds of his own, had, after half-an-hour of helpless stupefaction in a
  solicitor's office in Cornhill, bought a house for two hundred and twenty
  pounds, and paid ten pounds for stamps and lawyer's fees. The remaining two
  hundred pounds had been furnished by the Indubitable Perpetual Building
  Society, on the; security of a mortgage; and the loan, with its interest, was
  to be repaid in monthly instalments of two pounds and fourpence during twelve
  years. Thus old Jack Randall designed to provide for the wants and
  infirmities of age; and the outright purchase, he argued, was a thing of
  mighty easy accomplishment. For the house let at nine shillings a week, which
  was twenty-three pounds eight shillings a year; and the mortgage instalments,
  with the ground rent of three pounds a year, only came to twenty-seven pounds
  four, leaving a difference of three pounds sixteen, which would be more than
  covered by a saving of eighteenpence a week: certainly not a difficult saving
  for a man with a regular job and no young family, who had put by thirty
  pounds in little more than three years. Thus on many evenings old Jack
  Randall and his wife would figure out the thing, wholly forgetting rates and
  taxes and repairs.</p>

  <p>Old Jack stood on the pavement of Cornhill, and stared at the traffic.
  When he remembered that Mrs. Randall was by his side, he said, "Well, mother,
  we done it;" and his wife replied, "Yus, fa', you're a lan'lord now." Hereat
  he chuckled and began to walk eastward. For to be a landlord is the ultimate
  dignity. There is no trouble, no anxiety in the world if you are a landlord;
  and there is no work. You just; walk round on Monday mornings (or maybe you
  even drive in a trap), and you collect your rents: eight and six, or nine
  shillings, or ten shillings, as the case may be. And there you are! It is
  better than shopkeeping, because the money comes by itself; and it is
  infinitely more genteel. Also, it is better than having money in a bank and
  drawing interest; because the house cannot run away as is the manner of
  directors, nor dissolve into nothingness as is the way of banks. And here was
  he, Jack Randall, walking down Leadenhall Street a landlord. He mounted a
  tram-car at Aldgate, and all things were real.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">OLD JACK had always been old Jack since at fourteen young
  Jack had come 'prentice in the same engine-turner's shop. Young Jack was a
  married man himself now, at another shop; and old Jack was near fifty, and
  had set himself toward thrift. All along Whitechapel Road, Mile End Road, and
  Bow Road he considered the shops and houses from the tram-roof, madly
  estimating rents and values. Near Bow Road end he and his wife alighted, and
  went inspecting Twenty-seven Mulberry Street once more.; Old Jack remarked
  that the scraper was of a different shape from that he had carried in his
  mind since their last examination; and he mentioned it to Mrs. Randall, who
  considered the scraper of fact rather better than the scraper of memory. They
  walked to and fro several times, judging the door and three windows from each
  side of the street, and in the end they knocked, with a purpose of reporting
  the completed purchase. But the tenant's wife, peeping from behind a blind,
  and seeing only the people who had already come spying about the house some
  two or three times, retired to the back and went on with her weekly
  washing.</p>

  <p>They waited a little, repeated the knock, and then went away. The whole
  day was "off," and a stroll in the Tower Hamlets Cemetery was decided on.
  Victoria Park was as near, but was not in the direction of home. Moreover,
  there was less interest for Mrs. Randall in Victoria Park, because there were
  no funerals. In the cemetery, Mrs. Randall solaced herself and old Jack with
  the more sentimental among the inscriptions. In the poor part, whose
  miscellaneous graves are marked by mounds alone, they stopped to look at a
  very cheap funeral.</p>

  <p>"Lor', Jack," Mrs. Randall said under her breath with a nudge, "wot a
  common caufin! Why, the body's very nigh a-droppin' through; the bottom!" The
  thin under-board had, in fact, a bulge. "Pore chap! ain't it shockin'!"</p>

  <p>The ignominy of a funeral with no feathers was a thing accepted of course,
  but the horror of a cheap coffin they had never realized till now. They
  turned away. In the main path they met the turgid funeral of a Bow Road
  bookmaker. After the dozen mourning coaches there were cars and pony traps,
  and behind these came a fag-end of carts and donkey-barrows. Ahead of all was
  the glazed hearse, with attendants in weepers, and by it, full of the pride
  of artistry, walked the undertaker himself.</p>

  <p>"Now that," said old Jack, "is somethin' like a caufin." (It was heavy and
  polished and beset with bright fittings.) "Ah," sighed his missis, "ain't it
  lovely!"</p>

  <p>The hearse drew up at the chapel door, where the undertaker turned to the
  right-about and placidly surveyed the movements of his forces. Mrs. Randall
  murmured again: "Lovely&mdash;lovely!" and kept her eyes on the coffin. Then
  she edged gently up to the undertaker, and whispered, "What would that kind
  o' caufin be called, mister?"</p>

  <p>The undertaker looked at her from the sides of his eyes, and answered
  briskly, "Two-inch polished oak solid extry brass fittin's." Mrs. Randall
  returned to old Jack's side and repeated; the words. "That must cost a lot,"
  she said. "What a thing, though, to be certain you won't be buried in a
  trumpery box like that other! Ah, it's well to be rich."</p>

  <p>Old Jack gazed on the coffin, and thought. Surely a landlord, if anybody,
  was entitled to indulge in an expensive coffin? All day he had nursed a fancy
  that some small indulgence, something a little heavier than usual in the
  matter of expense, would be proper to celebrate the occasion. But he
  reflected that his savings were gone and his pockets no fuller than had
  always been their Wednesday wont: though, of course, in that matter the
  future would be different. The bearers carried the coffin into the chapel,
  and Mrs. Randall turned away among the graves. Old Jack put his hands in his
  pockets, and, looking at the ground, said: "That was a nobby caufin, mother,
  wasn't it?" Whereunto Mrs. Randall murmured: "Lovely&mdash;lovely!" yet
  again.</p>

  <p>Old Jack walked a little further, and asked, "Two-inch polished oak, 'e
  said, didn't 'e?"</p>

  <p>"Solid, an' extry brass fittin's; beautiful!"</p>

  <p>"I'll remember it. That's what you shall 'ave if it 'appens you go fust.
  There!" And old Jack sat on the guard-chain of a flowery grave with the air
  of one giving a handsome order.</p>

  <p>"Me? Git out! Look at the expense."</p>

  <p>"Matter o' circumstances. Look at Jenkins's Gardens. Jenkins was a
  bench-'and at the Limited; got 'is 'ouses one under another through building
  s'ieties. That there caufin 'ud be none too dear for <i>'im</i>. We're
  beginnin'; an' I promise you that same, if you'd like it."</p>

  <p>"Like it!" the missis ejaculated. "Course I should. Wouldn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Wy, yus. Any one 'ud prefer somethin' a bit nobby; an' thick."</p>

  <p>And the missis reciprocated old Jack's promise, in case he died first: if
  a two-inch polished oak solid could be got for everything she had to offer.
  And, tea-time approaching, they made well pleased for home.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">IN two days old Jack was known as a landlord all about. On
  the third day, which was Saturday, young Jack called to borrow half a
  sovereign, but succeeded only to the extent of five shillings: work was slack
  with him, and three days of it was all he had had that week. This had
  happened before, and he had got on as best he could; but now, with a father
  buying ;house-property, it was absurd to economize for lack of half a
  sovereign. When he brought the five shillings home, his wife asked why he had
  not thrown them at his father's head: a course of procedure which, young Jack
  confessed, had never occurred to his mind. "Stingy old 'unks!" she scolded.
  "A-goin' about buyin' 'ouses, an' won't lend 'is own son ten shillin's! Much
  good may all 'is money do 'im with 'is 'ateful mean ways!" This was the
  beginning of old Jack's estrangement from his relatives. For young Jack's
  missis expressed her opinion in other places, and young Jack was soon ready
  to share it: rigidly abstaining from another attempt at a loan, though he
  never repaid the five shillings.</p>

  <p>In the course of the succeeding week two of his shopmates took old Jack
  aside at different times to explain that the loan of a pound or two would
  make the greatest imaginable difference to the whole course of their future
  lives, while the temporary absence of the money would be imperceptible to a
  capitalist like himself. When he roundly declared that he had as few loose
  sovereigns as themselves, he was set down as an uncommon liar as well as a
  wretched old miser. This was the beginning of old Jack's unpopularity in the
  workshop.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">HE took a half-day off to receive the first week's rent in
  state, and Mrs. Randall went with him. He showed his written authority from
  the last landlord, and the tenant's wife paid over the sum of nine shillings,
  giving him at the same time the rent-book to sign and a slip of written
  paper. This last was a week's notice to terminate the tenancy.</p>

  <p>"We're very well satisfied with the 'ouse," the tenant's wife said (she
  was a painfully clean, angular woman, with a notable flavor of yellow soap
  and scrubbing-brush about her), "but my 'usband finds it too far to get to
  an' from Albert Docks mornin' and night. So we're goin' to West 'Am." And she
  politely ejected her visitors by opening the door and crowding them through
  it.</p>

  <p>The want of a tenant was a contingency that old Jack had never
  contemplated. As long as it lasted it would necessitate the setting by of ten
  and sixpence a week for the building society payments and the ground-rent.
  This was serious: it meant knocking off some of the butcher's meat, all the
  beer and tobacco, and perhaps a little firing. Old Jack resolved to waste no
  more half-days in collecting, but to send his; missis. On the following
  Monday, therefore, while the tenant's wife kept a sharp eye on the man who
  was piling a greengrocer's van with chairs and tables, Mrs. Randall fixed a
  "To Let" bill in the front window. In the leaves of the rent-book she found
  another thing of chagrin: to wit, a notice demanding payment of poor,
  highway, and general rates to the amount of one pound eighteen and
  sevenpence. Now, no thought of rates and taxes had ever vexed the soul of old
  Jack. Of course, he might have known that his own landlord paid the rates for
  his house; but, indeed, he had never once thought of the thing, being content
  with faithfully paying the rent, and troubling no more about it. That night
  was one of dismal wakefulness for old Jack and his missis. If he had
  understood the transaction at the lawyer's office, he would have known that a
  large proportion of the sum due had been allowed him in the final adjustment
  of payment to the day; and if he had known something of the ways of
  rate-collecting, he would have understood that payment was not expected for
  at least a month. As it was, the glories of lease-possession grew dim in his
  eyes, and a landlord seemed a poor creature, spending his substance to keep
  roofs over the heads of strangers.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">ON Wednesday afternoon a man called about taking the house,
  and returned in the evening, when old Jack was home. He was a large-featured,
  quick-eyed man, with a loud, harsh voice and a self-assertive manner. Quickly
  old Jack recognized him as a speaker he had heard at certain street-corners:
  a man who was secretary, or delegate, or that sort of thing, to something
  that old Jack had forgotten.</p>

  <p>He began with the announcement, "I am Joe Parsons," delivered with a stare
  for emphasis, and followed by a pause to permit assimilation.</p>

  <p>Old Jack had some recollection of the name, but it was indefinite. He
  wondered whether or not he should address the man as "sir," considering the
  street speeches, and the evident importance of the name. But then, after all,
  he was a landlord himself. So he only said, "Yus?"</p>

  <p>"I am Joe Parsons," the man repeated; "and I'm looking for a 'ouse."</p>

  <p>There was another pause, which lasted till old Jack felt obliged to say
  something. So he said, "Yus?" again.</p>

  <p>"I'm looking for a 'ouse," the man repeated, "and, if we can arrange
  things satisfactory, I might take yours."</p>

  <p>Mr. Joe Parsons was far above haggling about the rent, but he had certain
  ideas as to painting and repairs that looked expensive. In the end old Jack
  promised the paint a touch-up, privily resolving to do the work himself in
  his evenings. And on the whole, Mr. Joe Parsons was wonderfully easy to come
  to terms with, considering his eminent public character. And anything in the
  nature of a reference in his case would have been absurd. As himself
  observed, his name was enough for that.</p><br>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">OLD JACK did the painting, and the new tenant took
  possession. When Mrs. Randall called for the first week a draggle-tailed
  little woman with a black eye meekly informed her that Mr. Parsons was not at
  home, and had left no money nor any message as to the rent. This was awkward,
  because the first building society instalment would be due before next
  rent-day&mdash;to say nothing of the rates. But it would never do to offend
  Mr. Parsons. So the money was scraped together by heroic means (the missis
  produced an unsuspected twelve and sixpence from a gallipot on the kitchen
  dresser), and the first instalment was paid.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Randall called twice at Mulberry Street next rent-day, but nobody
  answered her knocks. Old Jack, possessed by a misty notion, born of use, that
  rent was constitutionally demandable only on Monday morning, called no more
  for a week. But on Thursday evening a stout little stranger, with a bald head
  which he wiped continually, came to the Randalls to ask if the tenant of
  Twenty-seven Mulberry Street was Mr. Joe Parsons. Assured that it was, he
  nodded, said, "Thanks! that's all," wiped his head again, and started to go.
  Then he paused, and "Pay his rent regular?" he asked. Old Jack hesitated.
  "Ah, thought so," said the little stranger. "He's a wrong 'un. <i>I've</i>
  got a bit o' paper for 'im." And he clapped on his hat with the handkerchief
  in it and vanished.</p><br>

  <h3>VII.</h3>

  <p class="first">OLD JACK felt unhappy, for a landlord. He and the missis
  reproached themselves for not asking the little stranger certain questions;
  but he had gone. Next Monday morning old Jack took another half-day, and went
  to Mulberry Street himself. From appearances, he assured himself that a
  belief, entertained by his missis,; that the upper part of his house was
  being sublet, was well founded. He watched awhile from a corner, until a
  dirty child kicked at the door, and it was opened. Then he went across and
  found the draggle-tailed woman who had answered Mrs. Randall before, in every
  respect the same to look at, except that not one eye was black but two. Old
  Jack, with some abruptness, demanded his rent of her, addressing her as Mrs.
  Parsons. Without disclaiming the name, she pleaded with meek uneasiness that
  Mr. Parsons really wasn't at home, and she didn't know when to expect him. At
  last, finding this ineffectual, she produced four and sixpence: begging him
  with increasing agitation to take that on account and call again.</p>

  <p>Old Jack took the money, and called again at seven. Custom or law or
  what-not, he would wait for no Monday morning now. The door was open, and a
  group of listening children stood about it. From within came a noise of
  knocks and thuds and curses&mdash;sometimes a gurgle. Old Jack asked a small
  boy, whose position in the passage betokened residence, what was going
  forward. "It's the man downstairs," said the boy, "a-givin' of it to 'is wife
  for payin' awy the lodgers' rent."</p>

  <p>At this moment Mr. Joe Parsons appeared in the passage. The children, who
  had once or; twice commented in shouts, dispersed. "I've come for my rent,"
  said old Jack.</p>

  <p>Mr. Joe Parsons saw no retreat. So he said, "Rent? Ain't you 'ad it? I
  don't bother about things in the 'ouse. Come again when my wife's in."</p>

  <p>"She is in," rejoined old Jack, "an' you've been a-landin' of 'er for
  payin' me what little she 'as. Come, you pay me what you owe me, and take a
  week's notice now. I want my house kep' respectable."</p>

  <p>Mr. Joe Parsons had no other shift. "You be damned," he said. "Git
  out."</p>

  <p>"What?" gasped old Jack&mdash;for to tell a landlord to get out of his own
  house!..."What?"</p>

  <p>"Why git out? Y' ought to know better than comin' 'ere askin' for money
  you ain't earnt."</p>

  <p>"Ain't earnt? What d'ye mean?"</p>

  <p>"What I say. Y' ain't earnt it. It's you blasted lan'lords as sucks the
  blood o' the workers. You go an' work for your money."</p>

  <p>Old Jack was confounded. "Why&mdash;what&mdash;how d'ye think I can pay
  the rates, an' everythink?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care. You'll <i>'ave</i> to pay 'em, an' I wish they was 'igher.
  They ought to be the same as the rent, an' that 'ud do away with fellers like
  you. Go on: you do your damdest an' get your rent best way you can."</p>

  <p>"But what about upstairs? You're lettin' it out an' takin' the rent there.
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's none o' your business. Git out, will ye?" They had gradually
  worked over the doorstep, and Randall was on the pavement. "I sha'n't pay,
  an' I sha'n't go, an' ye can do what ye like; so it's no good your
  stoppin'&mdash;unless you want to fight. Eh&mdash;do ye?" And Mr. Parsons put
  a foot over the threshold.</p>

  <p>Old Jack had not fought for many years. It was low. For a landlord outside
  his own house it was, indeed, disgraceful. But it was quite dark now, and
  there was scarcely a soul in the street. Perhaps nobody would know, and this
  man deserved something for himself. He looked up the street again, and then,
  "Well, I ain't so young as I was," he said, "but I won't disappoint ye. Come
  on."</p>

  <p>Mr. Joe Parsons stepped within and slammed the door.</p><br>

  <h3>VIII.</h3>

  <p class="first">OLD JACK went home less happy than ever. He had no notion
  what to do. Difficulties of private life were often discussed and argued out
  in the workshop, but there he had become too unpopular to ask for anything in
  the nature of; sympathy or advice. Not only would he lend no money, but he
  refused to stand treat on rent days. Also, there was a collection on behalf
  of men on strike at another factory, to which he gave nothing; and he had
  expressed the strongest disapproval of an extension of that strike, and his
  own intention to continue working if it happened. For what would become of
  all his plans and his savings if his wages ceased? Wherefore there was no
  other man in the shop so unpopular as old Jack, and in a workshop
  unpopularity is a bad thing.</p>

  <p>He called on a professional rent-receiver and seller-up. This man knew Mr.
  Joe Parsons very well. He never had furniture upon which a profitable
  distress might be levied. But if he took lodgers, and they were quiet people,
  something might be got out of them&mdash;if the job were made worth while.
  But this was not at all what old Jack wanted.</p>

  <p>Soon after it occurred to him to ask advice of the secretary of the
  building society. This was a superficial young man, an auctioneer's clerk
  until evening, who had no disposition to trouble himself about matters
  outside his duties. Still, he went so far as to assure old Jack that turning
  out a tenant who meant to stay was not a simple job. If you didn't mind
  losing the rent it might be done by watching until the house was; left
  ungarrisoned, getting in, putting the furniture into the street, and keeping
  the tenant out. With this forlorn hope old Jack began to spend his leisure
  about Mulberry Street: ineffectually, for Mrs. Parsons never came out while
  he was there. Once he saw the man, and offered to forgive him the rent if he
  would leave: a proposal which Mr. Parsons received with ostentatious
  merriment. At this old Jack's patience gave out, and he punched his tenant on
  the ear. Whereat the latter, suddenly whitening in the face, said something
  about the police, and walked away at a good pace.</p><br>

  <h3>IX.</h3>

  <p class="first">THE strike extended, as it was expected and designed to do.
  The men at old Jack's factory were ordered out, and came, excepting only old
  Jack himself. He was desperate. Since he had ventured on that cursed
  investment everything had gone wrong: but he would not lose his savings if
  mere personal risk would preserve them. Moreover, a man of fifty is not
  readily re-employed, once out; and as the firm was quite ready to keep one
  hand on to oil and see that things were in order, old Jack stayed: making his
  comings and goings late to dodge the pickets,; and approaching subtly by a
  railway-arch stable and a lane thereunto. It was not as yet a very great
  strike, and with care these things could be done. Still, he was sighted and
  chased twice, and he knew that, if the strike lasted, and feeling grew
  hotter, he would be attacked in his own house. If only he could hold on
  through the strike, and by hook or crook keep the outgoings paid, he would
  attend to Mr. Parsons afterward.</p><br>

  <h3>X.</h3>

  <p class="first">ONE Saturday afternoon, as Mrs. Randall was buying greens
  and potatoes, old Jack, waiting without, strolled toward a crowd standing
  about a speaker. A near approach discovered the speaker to be Mr. Joe
  Parsons, who was saying:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"&mdash;&mdash;strike pay is little enough at the time, of course, but
  don't forget what it will lead to! An' strike pay does very well, my frien's,
  when the party knows 'ow to lay it out, an' don't go passin' it on to the
  lan'lord. Don't give it away. When the lan'lord comes o' Monday mornin', tell
  'im (polite as you like) that there's nothink for 'im till there's more for
  you. Let the lan'lord earn 'is money, like me an' you. Let the lan'lords pay
  a bit towards this 'ere strike as; well as the other blaggards, the
  imployers. Lan'lords gits quite enough out o' you, my feller workers,
  when&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They don't git much out o' you!" shouted old Jack in his wrath; and then
  felt sorry he had spoken. For everybody looked at him, and he knew some of
  the faces.</p>

  <p>"Ho!" rejoined the speaker, mincingly. "There's a gent there as seems to
  want to address this 'ere meetin'. P'r'aps you'll 'ave the kindness to step
  up 'ere, my friend, an' say wot you got to say plain." And he looked full at
  old Jack, pointing with his finger.</p>

  <p>Old Jack fidgeted, wishing himself out of it. "You pay me what you owe
  me," he growled sulkily.</p>

  <p>"As this 'ere individual, after intruding 'isself on this peaceful
  meetin', ain't got anythink to say for 'isself," pursued Mr. Joe Parsons,
  "I'll explain things for 'im. That's <i>my</i> lan'lord, that is: look at
  'im! 'E comes 'angin' round my door waitin' for a chance to turn my pore wife
  an' children out o' 'ouse and 'ome. 'E follers me in the street an' tries to
  intimidate me. 'E comes 'ere, my feller workers, as a spy, an' to try an'
  poison your minds agin me as devotes my 'ole life to your int'rests. That's
  the sort o' man, that's the sort o' lan'lord <i>'e</i> is. But 'e's somethink
  more than a greedy, thievin', overfed; lan'lord, my frien's, an' I'll tell
  you wot. 'E's a dirty, crawlin' blackleg; that's wot else 'e is. 'E's the
  on'y man as wouldn't come out o' Maidment's; an' 'e's workin' there now,
  skulkin' in an' out in the dark&mdash;a dirty rat! Now you all know very well
  I won't 'ave nothink to do with any violence or intimidation. It's agin my
  principles, although I know there's very often great temptation, an' it's
  impossible to identify in a crowd, an' safe to be very little evidence. But
  this I will say, that when a dirty low rat, not content with fattenin' on
  starvin' tenants, goes an' takes the bread out o' 'is feller men's mouths,
  like that bleedin' blackleg&mdash;blackleg!&mdash;blackleg!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Old Jack was down. A dozen heavy boots were at work about his head and
  belly. In from the edge of the crowd a woman tore her way, shedding potatoes
  as she ran, and screaming; threw herself upon the man on the ground; and
  shared the kicks. Over the shoulders of the kickers whirled the buckle-end of
  a belt. "One for the old cow," said a voice.</p><br>

  <h3>XI.</h3>

  <p class="first">WHEN a man is lying helpless on his back, with nothing in
  hand, he pays nothing off a; building society mortgage, because, as his wife
  pawns the goods of the house, the resulting money goes for necessaries. To
  such a man the society shows no useless grace: especially when the secretary
  has a friend always ready to take over a forfeited house at forced sale
  price. So the lease of Twenty-seven vanished, and old Jack's savings with
  it.</p>

  <p>And one day, some months later, old Jack, supported by the missis and a
  stick, took his way across the workhouse forecourt. There was a door some
  twenty yards from that directly before them, and two men came out of it,
  carrying a laden coffin of plain deal.</p>

  <p>"Look there, Jack," the missis said, as she checked her step; "what a
  common caufin!" And indeed there was a distinct bulge in the bottom.</p>
