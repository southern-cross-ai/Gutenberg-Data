  <h3>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h3>

  <p class="note">This e-book was built from digital copies of the 26 issues of
  <i>The Strand Magazine</i> in which the lavishly-illustrated series "Zig-Zags
  at the Zoo" was published between July 1892 and August 1894. It contains
  digitally-enhanced versions of the 580-odd delightful animal caricatures that
  James Affleck Shepherd drew for the series. The limitations of HTML coding
  made it necessary, in some cases, to reposition these, with the result that
  the book is not a one-to-one copy of the series as it appeared in <i>The
  Strand</i>. Furthermore, additional headers have been added to the title
  graphics to make them more readable and to reduce the amount of white space
  resulting from the deletion of enapsulated text. The font used in the titles
  and the captions is Bradley Hand ITC, which is more in keeping with the style
  and spirit of the illustrations than the serif font used in <i>The Strand
  Magazine</i>. &mdash;RG.</p>

  <h3>REVIEW FROM THE SPECTATOR, MARCH 30, 1895</h3>

  <p class="quote">It would be difficult to decide which is the more essential
  part of <i>Zig Zags at the Zoo</i>,&mdash;the pen or the pencil.</p>

  <p class="quote">They are complementary to each other, and both are
  observant, humorous, and accurate. Mr. Morrison has a keen sense of humour,
  and Mr. Shepherd has an equally keen sense of the ludicrous, and between them
  they make every animal provide some amusement. Some birds&mdash;and birds
  furnish Mr. Shepherd with his happiest efforts&mdash;seem born to become
  comedians on the smallest provocations, and on these he exercises the art of
  caricature with great success. He has certainly a most decided gift for true
  caricature, and exaggerates prominent features with much skill. Every word of
  the letterpress is readable, and there is no small amount of acute
  observation conveyed in the rambling remarks on various creatures'
  characteristics. It would be superfluous to praise or single out any
  particular drawing; but the bears, perhaps, show Mr. Shepherd's skill, and
  various birds his mastery of the art of suggestive caricature. <i>Zig-Zags at
  the Zoo</i> is a necessary volume to all people who are fond of animals and
  gifted with a sense of humour.</p>

  <p class="first">"ZIG-ZAGS AT THE ZOO" is a title which must not be
  misunderstood. The Zigzag&mdash;though possibly suggestive of a beast with
  stripes&mdash;is not a newly-captured wild animal lately added to the great
  London collection; it is merely the ordinary commonplace, charming, and
  delightful Zig-zag of everyday existence. For variety is the spice of life,
  and every man taking ease and joy of his life shall go through it in
  zig-zags. The direct road is the path of the toiler. Observe a man at a
  picture exhibition&mdash;a man who begins at number one on the catalogue and
  goes right through with solemn persistence until he arrives at the longest
  number at the last page, and the uttermost corner of the last gallery. That
  man is either "doing the show" for a newspaper, or prefers to make the
  pictures an affliction unto himself. A picture show, like everything else,
  should be taken on the zig-zag. The man who plans and cogitates the nearest
  way between two streets&mdash;that man is too busy poor fellow, to know the
  sweets of the zig-zag. To go upon the zig-zag is to see more, and with
  greater entertainment. Who sees more stars, more lamp-posts, front-doors, and
  keyholes than other men&mdash;yea, even unto tenfold? He who goes home on the
  zig-zag.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag01-02.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The zig-zag is the token, the mystic sign, of contentful ease and good
  fellowship the world over; the very word is passed to us, like a loving-cup,
  by the French, who have taken it in all good amity from the Germans, as
  Littré himself testifieth, and what greater sign of universal brotherhood
  shall you want than that? The zig-zag, too, is necessary; for the soberest
  citizen may not walk home through many streets in a straight line, lest he
  break his nose. "Zig-zag: something with short sharp turns," says the
  respectable Webster. Let us, therefore, take here a sharp turn, lest we run
  our noses against the wall of brown speculation.</p>

  <p>Many good friends have I in the gardens of the Zoological Society of
  London. These good friends devote their entire lives to the furtherance of a
  popular taste for zoology, and are, or should be at once elected, most
  distinguished active members of the society. To pay certain gold guineas a
  year is a good thing; but what human member of the society would live amiably
  behind bars for the cause, to be stared at and made the subject of personal
  impudences? Now, all these fine fellows have their individual characters,
  their little personal habits and crotchets, just as have those distinguished
  zoologists who walk upright and wear tail-coats.</p><br>

  <p>For instance, you may have come upon a row of three lions, or monkeys, or
  seals, as the case may be, and to you, a casual visitor, they shall be but
  three very similar seals or monkeys or lions. So also in the official
  guide-book, for a guide-book which is sober and official can say no other.
  But scrape close acquaintance with those creatures and talk to their keepers,
  and you shall find them Bill, Polly, and Sam: Bill, perhaps, being an
  easy-going lion (or seal or monkey), with a weakness for a lump of sugar, and
  a disregard of the state of his coat; Polly a coquette, with a vast pride in
  her tail; and Sam a touchy old fellow who objects to all but one particular
  keeper; and each with a history. Among these distinguished personages shall
  we zig-zag, and improve acquaintance. Meantime, let us sit upon this seat on
  the terrace with a good view of the gardens before us, while the big
  good-humoured Jung Perchad stalks along below with a howdahful of children
  and an eye to the casual bun; and let us meditate.</p><img src=

  <p>I like to conduct my brown studies in an atmosphere of mingled evolution
  and metempsychosis. It is a pity that the theory of our evolution from the
  primordial protoplasm in an inclusive line through every living species
  should now be considered old-fashioned. I like to imagine that among my
  remote ancestors every living thing is represented&mdash;it gives them a
  family interest. And if, further, I can persuade myself that <i>I</i> have
  been everything, at one time or another, from a bluebottle to a
  giraffe&mdash;why, then I can brown-study forever. The imaginative mind can
  compass all things. Well may I remember the comfort of a mouth six feet by
  measurement along the lips, in a crocodile. You take in your enemy in one
  large generous smile, and he is seen no more. And a tail for others&mdash;the
  cow, the dog, the horse, the lion, the tiger&mdash;is a convenience, both as
  a fly-whisk and as a help to working up a tantrum. In evolution from a
  bluebottle to a giraffe one learns the value of these things.</p><img src=

        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>As a bluebottle, I think I should have enjoyed life&mdash;as a young one
  certainly; an elderly bluebottle gets bloated, slow, and gouty, losing his
  sense of humour. He grows infirm of purpose, too, and forgets to return to
  the same spot on a bald head after the eighteenth time of chasing
  off&mdash;the eighteenth time being really just when the fun begins.
  Sometimes he passes over a red nose altogether, probably from a fear of
  aggravating the gout in his feet. I am a little more doubtful about the
  giraffe. I should certainly have had a better opportunity of holding my head
  high in the world than I ever have now; and the giraffe has the advantage of
  the bluebottle in the matter of gouty feet. But what a neck for
  mumps!</p><br>
  <br>

        title="Illustration">

  <p>I think I <i>must</i> have been a raven or a jackdaw at some
  time&mdash;reasoning by induction&mdash;and I must have had a rare good time.
  The great object of a raven's life is the collection of valuables, wherein he
  resembles a large half of the human race. He steals rings, silver thimbles,
  and money, hoarding them in a safe and quiet place. Now, there is nothing so
  impartial as good Dame Nature. For everything she gives its compensation;
  every poison has its antidote, every excess its counteracting scarcity;
  nothing dies. Everything is a cause, and the effects of all causes work on
  for eternity. So that I conclude that my life as a raven must have been
  peculiarly successful from a business point of view, and that for that flood
  of good fortune I am now suffering the ebb. Obviously I must have been
  bursting with this world's wealth in some life or another, else why things as
  they so painfully are? Or perhaps&mdash;stunning thought!&mdash;I am saving
  up all this penury against a flood of millions to come. But, come when it
  will, it shall never overwhelm me, for I shall take a holiday in a Scotch
  hotel. I quite believe I skipped the crocodiles; at any rate, I find little
  hereditary affinity between us. When a crocodile objects to its surroundings,
  it refuses its food; as a boy at school, I objected very much to my
  surroundings, but without any effect of that sort.</p>

  <p>My late friend&mdash;God rest him!&mdash;Mr. Jamrach, used to have rare
  tussles with his crocodiles. They were valuable as property, and when, out of
  spite, they took to attempting suicide by starvation, he had them tied up
  firmly and fed forcibly with a long pole <i>à la</i> ramrod. I never remember
  being so obstinate about my dinner as that; and if I had, from what I
  recollect of him, I don't believe my worthy preceptor would have done as Mr.
  Jamrach did. I never heard of his using any stick in that way. Beyond all
  this too, it should be observed that the crocodile has three distinct lids to
  each eye, whereby he is equipped for the performance of six separate and
  entirely distinct winks of the single variety, and an incalculable number of
  the more complicated sort by combination. Now the wink is the infallible sign
  of a frivolous and larky nature, and in disclaiming all relationship with the
  crocodile I need say no more than this.</p><br>

  <p>I often wonder what all these animals think of the band which plays here
  in the summer. The coming of the warm season is a time of joy, at any rate to
  the more tropical varieties, and it seems a pity to make it sad with a band.
  Perhaps it is done on the great principle of universal compensation already
  spoken of. Not that the band isn't a good one, you should understand, but a
  band of any sort before dinner is an infliction. Music is rather a nuisance
  to a hungry man, and its proper occasion arrives after a good dinner. Lions
  and tigers have ten times the capacity for hunger granted to man, and should
  be considered accordingly. Herein do I speak with feeling; for on several
  days of the week a German band plays near the corner of my street in the
  hungriest hour of the twenty-four, and on all the other afternoons the young
  lady next door, who is learning to sing (and taking a very long time over it)
  practises her scales.</p><br>
  <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag01-09.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>I should like to have met that German band when I was&mdash;say a tiger,
  and very hungry. But the young lady who will never learn to sing is
  infinitely worse, and deserves no consideration at all. I should like an
  opportunity of attacking her as a mouse.</p>

  <p>Old Sir John Maundevile is a man one would like to have met. I would do a
  great deal&mdash;even unto paying at the gate&mdash;to inspect a zoological
  garden furnished with a good selection of Sir John's discoveries. I should
  like, for instance, to see his "wylde Gees, that han 2 Hedes." They are not
  found in many poultry-yards nowadays, and have become swans on inn signs. I
  should like, too, to see that "fulle felonous Best" with a black head and
  three long horns, "trenchant in front, scharpe as a Sword," with which he
  "sleethe the Olifaunt," Again, I think I should like to see those "Ipotaynes,
  that dwellen sometyme in the Watre and sometyme on the Lond; and thei ben
  half Man and half Hors," and compare them with the blithesome hippopotamus as
  we now see him in our own Zoo.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag01-10.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>I should like to have the opinion of the man end on his equine hinder
  half, and to see how he walked; for, unlike the centaur, the "ipotayne" had
  only two legs. I should like to get a "cokadrille" as Maundevile's book
  pictures him, with long legs and ears like a donkey's, and show him to the
  sleepy alligators in the reptile house, by way of reconciling long-sundered
  relatives. But most I should like to get my mutton from a tree in the way Sir
  John did in a kingdom "that men clepen Caldilhe"&mdash;somewhere, it would
  seem, between India and China. On the tree, says our good friend, grows a
  fruit "as though it were Gourdes" and in each of these gourds grows a
  "lyttylle Lomb, withouten Wolle," which lamb, as well as the fruit, Sir John
  has eaten. "And that is a gret Marveylle," quoth Sir John; and so it is, when
  you come to think of it.</p><br>
  <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag01-11.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>It is a pity that there was no wool on those "Lombs;" it would have given
  the narrative a certain artistic completeness, a rounding off. But, since
  there was no wool, it is fortunate that Sir John distinctly said so,
  otherwise people might have called him a liar.</p>

  <p>Before the Zoological Society find specimens of these rarities, perhaps
  they may come upon another giraffe or two. Sir John Maundevile really plays
  light with the giraffe. He might have made something much more startling of
  it than "a Best pomelee or spotted; that is but a litylle more highe than is
  a Stede; but he hathe the Necke a 20 Cubytes long; and his Croup and his Tayl
  is as of an Hert; and he may loken over a gret highe Hous." Moreover, the
  illustrative woodcut in my copy actually under-represents the neck by full
  two-thirds; but that is for the very best of all reasons&mdash;there is no
  room on the block for any more. Perhaps it was because Sir John vouched for
  the giraffe that up to the present century most people in this country
  disbelieved in its existence.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag01-12.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>But just consider how he might have put it, and with truth; and how that
  heavy-handed artist might have put it&mdash;without truth. An animal with a
  deer's head, a leopard's skin, a swan's neck; a tongue that was used as a
  man's hand to grasp things a foot from its nose. With eyes that saw in every
  direction without a turn of the head; with nostrils that closed or opened.
  Withal higher than three tall men, one above another, and capable of slaying
  a man with one kick of a hinder leg, yet so timid as to fly before a child or
  a little dog! One feels rather ashamed of Sir John, after all, for neglecting
  his opportunities. There is difficulty in the capture of a giraffe, and there
  is expense. These obstacles, however, and greater ones, have been overcome
  again and again in time past by the Zoological Society of London, and
  probably giraffes soon will be seen here again. They are becoming rare even
  in their own habitat, and an African hunt would be a long and trying one.
  However, a giraffe is still to be had, and the time is distant when we shall
  become dependent for the supply upon a forlornly possible giraffe shower.
  Fish, frogs, and insects in showers are not unknown, while cats and dogs are
  proverbial. Water-spouts cause these fish and frog showers; in a giraffe
  transaction it would be necessary to charter rather a strong waterspout, and
  to stay indoors awhile; all a serious possibility considered from a

  <p class="first">A BEAR is an adaptable creature, a philosopher every inch.
  He takes everything just as it comes&mdash;and doesn't readily part with it.
  He lives in all sorts of countries, in all manner of weather and climate,
  merely changing his coat a little to suit the prevailing weather. He will eat
  honey&mdash;when he can get it; when he can't he consoles himself with the
  reflection that it is bad for the teeth. He is largely a vegetarian, except
  when meat falls in his way, and although innocently fond of buns, will
  cheerfully put up with strawberries and cream if they stray in his direction.
  There is a proverb inculcating the principle of catching the bear before you
  sell his skin. This, from a business point of view, is obviously absurd. If
  you can find somebody idiot enough to buy the skin first, <i>and pay
  cash</i>, why, take it, and let him do the catching. It will save a deal of
  trouble, and you will probably have a chance of selling the same skin again
  after the other fellow's funeral.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag02-02.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The bear is indeed a very respectable beast, as beasts go. And he
  certainly is respected in some quarters. Both the North American Indians and
  the Lapps reverence him too much even to mention his name in conversation;
  with them he is "the old man in the fur cloak" or "the destroyer." Indeed, it
  seems reasonable to feel a certain respect for an animal which can knock the
  top of your head off with a blow of his paw; but both the Indians and the
  Lapps carry their respect a little too far. To kill a bear and them humbly
  apologise to the dead body, as they do, is adding insult to injury,
  especially if you dine off the injured party immediately afterward. Neither
  is it likely to propitiate Bruin if a dozen men, while prodding him
  vigorously with a dozen spears, express their regret for the damage they are
  doing, and hope that he'll pardon the liberty. All this they do in sober
  earnest, and even go so far as to proffer a polite request that he won't hurt
  them. If he ever accedes to this, it is probably because he is confused by
  the contemplation of such colossal "cheek."</p>

  <p>All this is galling enough, though otherwise intended, but contumely
  reaches its climax when dinner comes on. It would be annoying enough to the
  shade of the departed gentleman in fur to hear that he made a capital joint,
  or the reverse; still, it is what might be expected. But this sort of thing
  they studiously refrain from saying. They talk with enthusiasm of the poor
  bear's high moral qualities&mdash;often inventing them for the occasion, it
  is to be feared&mdash;and, presumably talking at his ghost, tell each other
  that it was most considerate and indulgent of him to let them kill him so
  easily. Now this is worse than laying on insult with a trowel; it is piling
  it on with a shovel, and rubbing it in with a brick.</p><img src=

  <p>Contact with man ruins the respectability of the bear. He gets dissipated
  and raffish, and appears in the dock at police-courts. He associates with low
  companions&mdash;unclean-looking foreigners&mdash;who bang him sorely about
  the ribs with sticks to make him dance. They keep him badly, and he grows
  bony and mangy. He retaliates upon them by getting loose, frightening people,
  and breaking things. Then, when he is brought before a magistrate, they have
  to pay his fine. Sometimes they get into prison over him. The end is always
  the same&mdash;a bear who begins by associating with these people always
  turns up at the police-court before long, and once there, he comes again and
  again&mdash;just in the manner of the old offenders at Marlborough-street.
  Even in the innocent old times, when Bidpai wrote (or plagiarised) his
  fables, association with man made a fool of a bear. Witness the fable of the
  gardener's bear, who, zealous about a fly on his master's face, brought a paw
  upon it with all his force, and knocked off an indispensable piece of the
  worthy gardener's head.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag02-04.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>There is nothing whatever recorded against that gardener's character; he
  probably lived a most exemplary life, and won prizes at all the prehistoric
  horticultural shows in India&mdash;although it might not be strictly correct
  for a American to say there were no flies on him. But his society made a
  great ass of that bear.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag02-05.gif"

  <p>There was once a belief that bears licked their cubs into shape. If there
  be anything in this, all the bears in my acquaintance came of very negligent
  mothers&mdash;or, per­haps, of mothers who tried the other sort of licking.
  They have strength, sagacity, stupidity, gloom, cheerful­ness, teeth, hair,
  claws, position, magnitude, and big feet; but nothing at all like shape. This
  is why they are able to indulge in such a rich variety of attitudes of rest.
  With so convenient a want of shape, a bear may be put upon the ground as you
  please, and so he will lie, without rolling. A bear rests or sleeps just as
  he falls, as you shall see on any warm day here at the Zoo. Usually, however,
  he makes an attempt to spread his feet against something. What this is it
  doesn't matter, so long as he nay reach it with the flat of his foot; he is
  never perfectly safe, he feels, unless there is a firm foundation for that
  very large area of sole; considerations of natural gravity he doesn't stop to
  think about. He has a deal of confidence in the supporting capability of
  those feet; and, if the table of square measure means anything, he is
  actively justified So he lies on his back, and plants his feet against the
  side of his den; or on his side, and plants them against the bars. If there
  be two, they plant their feet against each other, and, in the sweet communion
  of sole, fall asleep; if there be only one, he curls up, and opposes his
  palms to his soles, and falls asleep so. Bango, the hairy-eared bear in the
  end cage, does this.</p>

  <p>A man who once said it was his sole attitude was driven to seek refuge
  from an infuriated populace in the seal pond. Notwithstanding this, and all
  that has been said about brute instinct in animals, nobody can gaze at, for
  instance, Michael, the big brown bear, without seeing at once that his sole
  is quite big enough for his body, big as that is.</p><img src=

  <p>While the family motto of Samson, the big Polar bear, is understood to be,
  "O my prophetic sole, mine ankle!" This, however, is another story, and
  relates to Samson's slight lameness in a hind foot. Samson is a fine fellow
  in the matter of size. The only short thing about him is his tail, unless you
  count his temper. And there really is some excuse for the short temper. The
  climate would be a sufficient excuse in itself. It might, perhaps, be
  reasonable to say that the English climate is sufficient excuse for anybody's
  shortness of temper, but on the Polar bear it has the effect of that of India
  on an Englishman.</p><br>

        title="Illustration">

  <p>Both Samson and Mrs. Samson&mdash;her name is Lil&mdash;manage fairly well
  in the winter, although they would be the more comfortable for an iceberg or
  two. But in the summer they keep as much as possible to the coolness of their
  cave, and look dolefully out at the visitors with just the expression of a
  fat Cockney when he says, "Ain't it 'orrid 'ot?" Still, Samson has had
  twenty-one of these summers now, and is bigger and stronger than ever, so
  that it is plain that his health does not suffer. Lil is only a little bigger
  than was Samson when he first arrived, and is playful&mdash;Samson isn't.</p>

  <p>Twenty-one years is a good length of healthy captivity for a bear, but
  Bango, the hairy-eared bear, has been here since 1867&mdash;established a
  quarter of a century, as the shopkeepers say. Bango lives with a single eye
  to his own comfort and nourishment, being blind in the other. Still, he can
  see a bun with his one eye just as quickly as any other bear can with two.
  Bango has a delusion&mdash;he is firmly convinced that by the regulations he
  is entitled to nine or ten meals a day, in addition to promiscuous snacks. By
  way of agitating for his rights, he makes a dinner gong of the partition
  between his cage and the next, punching it vigorously and uproariously for
  five minutes together whenever it strikes him that a meal is
  due.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag02-08.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>A sad, bad character in bears lives a few doors further down. It is Billy,
  the sloth-bear. He is the most disreputable, careless, lazy, and unkempt bear
  on the premises. Perhaps his parents neglected him. Certainly if one bear can
  have less shape than another, which has none, Billy has. He is more than
  shapeless; he approaches the nebulous. A sort of vast, indefinite, black mop,
  with certain very long and ill-kept claws observable in odd places, and now
  and again a dissolute, confused muzzle, in which a double allowance of lip
  and a half-allowance of lip mingle indistinguishable.</p><img src=
  "1500391h-images/ZigZag02-09.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Billy is usu­ally asleep. He is as fond of eat­ing as any other bear, but
  fonder still of sleeping. Give him a biscuit while he is lying down, and he
  will come for it with an indignant expression of muzzle, implying that you
  are rather a nuisance than otherwise.</p>

  <p>Ludlam's dog, says the proverb, was so lazy as to lay his head against the
  wall to bark. Billy must have been Ludlam's bear. Round at the other side,
  Joey, Fanny, and Dolly, the little Malayan bears, are certainly not lazy.
  Dolly will turn a somersault for you with his head (yes, I mean his) in the
  sawdust, bringing himself over by gripping the bars with his feet. Fanny will
  do the same thing high up against the bars, climbing a somersault, so to
  speak. Of course, there is no regular charge for this performance, but
  neither Fanny nor Dolly will feel disappointed if you contribute a biscuit to
  the prize fund. Fanny will find the biscuit with her paw, even if it be put
  out of sight on the ledge before the partition.</p>

  <p>But Michael&mdash;big Michael, the great brown Russian bear, the largest
  bear in the place except Samson&mdash;doesn't need to trouble to hunt for
  biscuits. He just opens his mouth, and you throw your contribution in. Now,
  with most of the bears this is something of a feat of skill, since you may
  easily pitch a little wide, and fail to score a bull's-eye. But when
  Michael's mouth opens&mdash;let us call him the Grand Duke Michael, by the
  bye&mdash;when the Grand Duke's mouth opens you can't very easily miss it. Go
  and look at the Grand Duke's mouth and see.</p><img src=

  <p>One chiefly respects Kate, the Syrian bear, as a relative of those other
  Syrian bears that ate the forty-two rude boys who annoyed Elisha. I have
  sometimes wondered whether these bears, hearing mention of a bald head, had
  aroused in them any personal feeling in regard to bear's-grease. But, on
  consideration, I scarcely think this likely, because bear's-grease for the
  hair is always made from pig. The pretty young Himalayan here can dance if
  she will, having been taught by the bearward, Godfrey. But she will only
  dance when she feels "so disposed," and never if asked, which is ungrateful
  to Godfrey, who has taken pains with her education, and who managed bears
  long before her grandmother was born.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag02-11.gif"

  <p>Menush and Nelly belong to a good family&mdash;the American
  blacks&mdash;but have been in trade, in the pit, until quite lately. Having
  acquired a considerable competence in buns, however, they have now retired
  into semi-privacy.</p>

  <p>They grew so excessively fat, indeed, upon the public bounty, that it
  became a matter of great difficulty to induce either to climb the
  pole&mdash;and almost as difficult a thing for either do it. Now they live in
  ease&mdash;although, looking at them and remembering that they are sporting
  characters, one might suppose them to be thinking of taking a quiet public
  house for the rest of their days.</p>

  <p>Punch and Judy have succeeded to the pit business. A few days after they
  first took possession, two other bears were turned in with them, nameless,
  but these obviously should be called Toby and the Policeman. When Punch and
  Judy, young bears and new to the place, first found themselves in the
  unaccustomed area, they looked about them till their eyes fell in succession
  upon the pole, the bath, and the floor&mdash;circular, and plainly meant as a
  ring. Here was a gymnasium, ready fitted; wherefore they promptly began a
  grand inaugural assault-at-arms, lasting most of the day.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag02-13.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>There was no distinct separation of the events; plunging, boxing,
  climbing, and wrestling were mixed in one long show, frequently approaching
  in character the drama wherefrom Punch and Judy derive their names, with one
  variation. For Judy is rather larger and stronger than Punch, who accordingly
  became chief receiver, and this with the utmost good humour. The pair, in the
  wild delight of comparative freedom in novel surroundings, having executed a
  prelusive scramble and rampage and a mutual roll in the bath, stood up and
  sparred carefully for an opening. Judy soon began proceedings with both
  mawleys, Punch ducking very cleverly and putting in the right on the
  listening-machine. Not to be denied, Judy bored in, and using right and left
  scored a decided lead, when Punch, the trickier of the two, observing his
  partner's back now to be turned to the bath, ducked in, held and back-heeled,
  both falling a mighty plunge, Punch uppermost, thus finishing round one.
  Round two consisted chiefly in a persevering attempt by Punch to drag Judy
  out of the bath, in order to roll in it himself. Round three began by Judy
  suddenly rising from the water and driving Punch violently up against the
  pole, from which awkward position he dropped on to four feet and retreated
  with celerity, suddenly stopping and turning about to deliver a stinger
  between the eyes.</p>

  <p>This round continued an unrecorded length of time, and consisted chiefly
  of wrestling, the bottom of the bath in the end being about the driest spot
  in the pit. Rounds four, five, and six consisted of judicious extracts from
  rounds one, two, and three, in new combinations, and with varying results,
  the combatants retiring, <i>secundum artem</i>, to their proper corners
  between each round. Bangs on the smeller, drives in the breadbasket and
  dexter optic, straight uns on the knowledge-box, rib-benders and
  ivory-rattlers were fully represented, and there were frequent visitations in
  the atmospheric department.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag02-14.gif"

        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>As the seventh round was about to begin, a visitor protruded a bun,
  impaled upon the stick for the purpose provided, near the pole a little way
  up. Business was immediately suspended, and Judy made for that bun. With some
  difficulty&mdash;Judy wasn't used to the pole, and it shook the more the
  higher she ascended&mdash;she acquired the little present half way up, and
  descended to where Punch waited to renew the display. But Judy was
  thoughtful, and indisposed for the noble art. She had found a new thing in
  life, something to live for and think about&mdash;buns. So she thought about
  them. The place where they were to be found, she reasoned&mdash;for she had
  never noticed the man at the opposite end of the long stick&mdash;was up that
  pole; the pole being probably a bun-tree. So that, whenever disposed for
  buns, it only needed to climb the pole and find some. Having arrived at this
  stage in the argument, it seemed to strike her that another bun was
  desirable, there and then. Wherefore she began another rather nervous climb,
  her eyes fixed steadily above to where the buns were expected to appear.</p>

  <p>The expedition was a failure, and Judy pondered it, with the apparent
  decision that the buns must be a little higher up. So she started again, and
  found one! She has got over that little bun-tree superstition by this time,
  and can climb better. Also she and the others have already broken up entirely
  five of the sticks upon which buns arrive, thus from time to time cutting off
  the supply. And although Toby and the Policeman are very useful as seconds at
  the later boxing matches, very few buns get past Judy. Punch, the hen-pecked
  and wily, waits good-humouredly at the foot of the pole, and has been known
  to catch many a bun that Judy climbed for.</p><img src=

  <p>Through all the bear-dens you may see bears in attitudes sufficiently
  human to be quaint and grotesque. A squat like that of an Indian idol, an
  oddly human looking out of window, or a lounge at the bars, clumsily
  suggestive of a lounge at a bar in the Strand; and of all the attitudes those
  of the gentle little Malay are quaintest. A certain bandy human
  respectability hangs about these small fellows. Dolly, after turning his
  somersault, will sit and inspect his reward just as a child will examine an
  apple, judging where to make the first bite. Dolly's great luxury is a
  cocoanut. He will thrust holes through the eyes at the end with a claw, and
  drink the milk before proceeding to the kernel. If the eyes are too tough to
  be pierced, he will lose his temper, like a spoiled child, and smash the nut
  against the floor; after which he will rush about distracted making wild
  efforts to drink the milk. I think some sort of a moral lesson might be
  deduced from this. If so, the gentle reader is at liberty to deduce it,
  without extra charge.</p>

  <h2><a id="story3"
     name="story3"></a>III. &mdash; ZIG-ZAG CAMELINE</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, September 1892</h3>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag03-01.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">THE CAMEL is very largely a fraud. That is to say, he
  contributes his half share to a very large fraud, and the goody-goody natural
  history books of childhood's days contribute the other half&mdash;perhaps
  rather more than half. First he is a fraud in the matter of docility&mdash;a
  vile fraud. We read of the kind, patient, intelligent camel, who voluntarily
  settles on his knees to receive his load, and afterwards carries it for any
  number of thousands of miles at twenty or thirty miles an hour with nothing
  to eat and we approve of the camel and his cheapness.</p>

  <p>Then there is a proverb which aids the fraud&mdash;most proverbs,
  by-the-bye, aid a fraud of some sort&mdash;a proverb about the last straw
  breaking the camel's back. What a glamour of oppressed, uncomplaining
  patience that proverb sets about the camel! You imagine the picturesque but
  inconsiderate Bedouin, having piled his faithful camel with everything he
  possesses, looking about for something else to crown the structure. There are
  all his tents, blankets, trunks, bags, rugs, hatboxes, umbrellas, and
  walking-sticks, with some grocery for Mrs. B. and a wooden horse from the
  Bagdad Arcade for the little B's. It seems a pity, having a camel, not to
  load it up enough, so he looks for something else, but can see nothing.
  Suddenly it strikes him that he has just used a straw to drink a gin-sling,
  and without for an instant considering what may be the result, he pops it on
  the top of the rest of the baggage. The patient, loving creature has barely
  time to give its master one pathetically reproachful look when its back goes
  with a bang.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag03-02.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration"> <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag03-03.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Now, this may be the way of the Bedouin, but it isn't the way of the
  camel. He doesn't wait for the last straw&mdash;he won't have the first if he
  can help it. There's no living thing in the universe that he wouldn't like to
  bite or kick; and when he isn't engaged in active warfare with creation in
  general, he is sulking and planning it.</p>

  <p>He equally resents being loaded or fed, or banged with a pole. He wants
  the world for himself, and finding he can't get it, sulks savagely. He has to
  be shoved forcibly to his knees and tied down by the neck and fore-legs
  before he is loaded, and while the operation is in progress he grunts and
  growls like a whole menagerie, and reaches about&mdash;he <i>can</i>
  reach&mdash;to masticate people. When he is loaded he won't get up-but he
  will grunt and bite.</p>

  <p>When at last he is persuaded to stand upon his legs he devotes himself to
  rushing about and scattering his load far and wide&mdash;and biting. The
  unhappy Bedouin's household furniture, hat-boxes, and wooden horse are
  scattered all over the Syrian Desert, and the unhappy Bedouin himself is
  worse off than at the beginning; and still the insatiate creature bites. The
  Bedouin swears&mdash;in his own way&mdash;hopes that jackals may sit upon the
  grave of the camel's grandfather, and so forth&mdash;and gathers his
  belongings together preparatory to beginning afresh.</p>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>And then, after all this&mdash;and supposing that all troubles are
  overcome and the journey ends without mishap&mdash;that delightful camel
  objects to the baggage being taken off, and growls and bites. It is not mere
  poetic imagery, it is a wicked joke to call the camel the ship of the desert.
  To call it even the Carter Paterson of the desert would be to cast
  reflections upon the business conscientiousness of a very respectable firm.
  One is disposed to be the harder on the camel because of the goody-book
  fraud, which is a double-barrelled fraud, telling wonderful stories of the
  camel's speed. As a matter of fact, the ordinary pack-camel, lightly loaded,
  is barely up to three miles an hour.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag03-05.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>He is a provident beast in the matter of drink. He takes a very long drink
  when he can get it, and saves it, neatly stowed away, against the drought. As
  a camel gets older and more experienced, he lays by more and more water in
  this way arriving in the course of a long and thirsty life at five or six
  quarts. If he lived a little longer he would probably add whisky.</p>

  <p>He is also provident in the matter of food. He feeds on his hump. I see an
  opportunity of dragging in a joke just here about a perpetually sulky man
  doing the same, but I refrain. I take the occasion to renounce and disclaim
  all intention of saying anything about the morose camel always having the
  hump, or of his contrary disposition giving him a greater hump the more he
  has to eat. It is vulgar as well as old. The only variation in the facial
  expression of the camel takes place when he eats. Ordinarily the camel wears
  an immutable, deceptive, stupid, good-natured grin. This is a wise provision
  of Nature, leading people to trust and approach him, and giving him
  opportunities to gnaw their faces off with suddenness and less difficulty; or
  guilelessly to manoeuvre the victim near a wall, against which he can rub him
  and smash him flat.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag03-06.gif"

        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">His feeding manners are vulgar, although superior to the
  tiger's. When he eats he uses his immense lips first as fingers to lift the
  desired dainty. Then he munches in a zig-zag, using alternately his right
  upper teeth on his left lower, and <i>vice versa</i>, and swinging his lips
  riotously. And he chucks up his nose, taking full advantage of his length of
  neck in swallowing.</p>

  <p>Here at the Zoo probably the first of the camels to attract the visitors'
  attention is Bob the Bactrian, in his semi-detached villa under the clock.
  Bob the Bactrian is a handsome old ruffian when his coat is in full bloom. He
  sheds twenty-four pounds of hair every year&mdash;and a pound of camel-hair
  is a good deal. It is frightful to think of the miles of watercolour sketches
  which might be perpetrated with the brushes made from twenty-four pounds of
  camel-hair. Self the keeper has sufficient of it by him to weave enough cloth
  to clothe a regiment&mdash;and with good raiment.</p><img src=

  <p class="first">I think Bob is a little vain of his fine beard and long
  hair. He poses about in picturesque attitudes when it is in good condition,
  and nothing short of a biscuit will make him disturb the curve of his neck.
  Bob is a military character&mdash;he came from Afghanistan&mdash;and carries
  out the part with great completeness.</p>

  <p>Offer Bob a biscuit, and, as he hangs his head over the railings in
  slobbering expectancy, he will "mark time" regularly with all four feet.
  Rose, the cross-bred Bactrian, lives next door to Bob, and there is something
  about the pair, and about their whole environment, that makes one think of
  them in the characters of an area belle and a fascinating guardsman;
  particularly as Bob is, I believe, a sort of cousin. The railing between them
  helps the illusion, just as the clock-tower above them gives a tone to Bob's
  military bearing&mdash;being dimly suggestive of the Horse Guards.</p>

  <p>Between Bob in full bloom and Bob in a state of moult, there is a world of
  difference. A sorry, ill-upholstered, scraggy shagbag is Bob in his
  periodical moult. All his beard&mdash;all his magnificent frills gone; a
  bare, mangy hide with a small patch here and there of inadhesive hair is all
  his outward show. Poor Bob feels his out-at-elbows state keenly, and lies
  low. He hides all day in the innermost recesses of his state apartment under
  the clock, and only ventures forth when the gates of the Gardens are closed,
  or when Rose is asleep. Sometimes the presence of a piece of biscuit on the
  floor of his front garden will tempt him sorely for hours, till he ventures
  forth after it, first looking cautiously about from his door to make sure
  that he is unobserved.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag03-11.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Neither his periodical seediness of appearance, however, nor anything else
  under the sun will prevent Bob demanding his meals. He keeps Self the keeper
  up to his work. If at any time it should occur to him that business in
  biscuits is becoming slack, or that another meal is due&mdash;neither a rare
  contingency&mdash;Bob walks to his back door and kicks with his fore-feet,
  like a rude boy. The keeper must come then, because Bob's foot never improves
  a door.</p>

  <p>Among Bob's accoutrements a feared and detested place is held by a big
  leather muzzle, a thing its wearer regards with mingled feelings. He isn't
  altogether sorry when Self proceeds to buckle it on, because it means that a
  pleasant walk about the grounds is to ensue. But bitter, bitter, poor Bob's
  lot to walk among human hands teeming with many buns&mdash;buns shut out for
  ever by that thing of leather! He sees the elephants caressed and fed; Jingo
  and Jung Perchad amble good-humouredly about, swinging their trunks in
  affable freedom right and left, and collecting many a pleasant morsel; while
  he, the magnificent, the bearded, the military Bob, in that vile
  nose-cage&mdash;but there! He turns his head the other way, and tries to look
  as though he hated buns. He tries not to see them, but they glisten,
  gloriously brown and sticky, from all sides&mdash;somehow there are always
  more buns about when that muzzle is on. And Bob becomes a greater misanthrope
  than is natural to him; which, speaking of a camel, is saying much. But what
  living thing in all these Gardens could spend half its waking hours in
  painfully assuming a contempt for buns without becoming a
  misanthrope?</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag03-12.gif"

  <p>Rose, who is cross-bred, is, in sheer spite of the hint the word carries,
  rather an amiable creature, and very rarely cross&mdash;for a camel. There
  has even been no necessity to give her a nose-ring. She is not always of an
  industrious appearance, having a habit of lying about in an Orientally lazy
  heap&mdash;so Oriental a heap that one instinctively looks for the hookah
  which Rose ought, in the circumstances, to be smoking.</p>

  <p>The local flies try a little annoyance now and again, but they have
  learned a great respect for a camel's length of reach. I remember a country
  bluebottle&mdash;a very raw and self-confident country bluebottle&mdash;who
  made a rash onslaught upon Rose without proper consideration. I knew this
  fly&mdash;I had met him once before, when he madly attempted to burgle a tin
  picnic box containing nothing. I felt interested to observe how he would get
  on with Rose, knowing well that, without asking advice of any regular local
  bluebottle, he would assume her to be a mere scraggy town cow.</p><img src=
  "1500391h-images/ZigZag03-13.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>This is just what he did. Rose stood, looking perfectly amiable&mdash;all
  camels look amiable; it is a part of their system&mdash;and, to an
  unaccustomed eye, quite unconscious of the country bluebottle's existence.
  Still, there was a certain optical twinkle which should have warned that
  bluebottle. But, heedless all, he rushed forward and made to settle on Rose's
  shoulder. With a nonchalant swing the near hind leg came up, and that
  bluebottle was brushed off his legs. He buzzed about for a little while,
  puzzled. This was quite a new motion in cow-legs&mdash;some town improvement,
  evidently. So he settled&mdash;at least he tried&mdash;near the top joint of
  that hind-leg, where the foot couldn't reach him. Rose looked calmly ahead at
  nothing and moved no limb but the near foreleg, which swung quietly back,
  and&mdash;that bluebottle was projected into space at the instant his feet
  were landing.</p>

  <p>He gathered himself together, and sat on the roof of the stable to think
  it over. Meanwhile Rose stood at ease, without a further movement. The
  bluebottle considered the question strategically, and made up his mind that
  on the chest, just before the joints of the fore-legs, nothing could touch
  him. He tried it. But he only arrived on the spot simultaneously with a
  hind-foot, which swung neatly out between the fore-legs and drove that
  bluebottle into the surrounding atmosphere once more. And still Rose gazed
  amiably at nothing.</p>

  <p>Losing his temper he made straight for her nose; but the nose never moved.
  The hind leg came up once more, however, and made the rout complete. Baffled
  and disgusted, the rash bluebottle flew off in a pet over the rails dividing
  Rose from Bob. Now Bob was just indulging in a yawn of the very largest size,
  and that rash bluebottle, never looking where he was going&mdash;! Well,
  well, it was a sad end for a bright young bluebottle, just beginning to see
  life. And still Rose gazed amiably at nothing, standing just as that departed
  bluebottle first saw her.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag03-14.gif"

  <p>But the aristocrat among the camels here is Tom, who is white, and a
  rarity. He was captured in an Egyptian fight, and was little more than
  half-grown when he arrived, but has increased in seven years, and will grow
  no larger now&mdash;nor any more savage. This litter contingency has been
  provided for by a neat little iron ring which Tom wears in his nose.</p>

  <p>At the Zoo the camel's naturally unamiable temper is not aggravated by
  overloading; nobody looks about for that last straw after the two or three
  small boys have mounted. Wherefore these camels are as well behaved as camels
  can be. Tom doesn't playfully try to smash his keeper against the
  wall&mdash;at any rate, not quite so often as he did at first&mdash;chiefly
  because of that piece of jewellery in his nose. That has made a very
  peaceable dromedary of Tom, for when he takes a walk the keeper snaps one end
  of a neat little piece of chain upon the ring, and keeps the other in his
  hand. And Tom will do anything rather than have his nose pulled.</p>

  <p>At a time when Tom is in the seclusion of the stable&mdash;perhaps
  invisible&mdash;approach the rails with an air of having a biscuit about you.
  Promptly Tom will emerge from his lair, with a startling stride and a
  disconcerting reach of neck. Make no further sign of biscuit. Then, if Self
  be by, you shall find that he has imparted to Tom a certain polish of manner
  surprising in a camel. Self will tell Tom to beg, and Tom will beg
  immediately; the supplication consisting in standing on three legs and
  throwing the right forefoot negligently across the left knee. Thereat you
  probably give him a biscuit. But if yo remain obdurate, or have come
  biscuitless, Tom's politeness evaporates at once. He turns his back upon his
  visitor with a certain studied rudeness of manner&mdash;a contumelious
  nose-in-air tail-turning&mdash;and stalks disgustedly back to his boudoir.
  Any other camel will do this, and it is natural. Why do these human creatures
  come to the rails unprovided with biscuits? What are they for? So the camel
  turns up his nose&mdash;and a camel <i>can</i> do this; watch him&mdash;and
  flounces away.</p>

  <p>Now, I like Bob, and I like Rose, so far as one may like a camel; and I
  like Tom, so far as Tom will allow it. But that doesn't in the least
  reconcile me to the juvenile natural history book.</p>

  <p>You can't conscientiously look Bob or Tom in the face and call him a ship
  of the desert, or a ship of any kind. You might possibly manage to work up a
  small fit of sea-sickness if you rode a Heirie&mdash;the swiftest of the
  dromedaries&mdash;at his best pace; because at a pinch the Heirie can make
  ten miles an hour, shaking his unfortunate rider's joints loose, even though
  he be swathed in many swadlings. But neither Bob nor Tom is a Heirie. Tom is
  a fairly quick dromedary, but Bob, if he will pardon my saying so, is only an
  ordinary slow camel; nothing more than the "hairy scary oont" sung by Mr.
  Kipling. In Mr. Kipling's ballad Mr. Atkins is made to call the camel many
  things, but never a ship of the desert. Contrariwise,</p>

  <p class="poem">&mdash;"the commissariat cam-u-el, when all is said and

  <p>Two attendants have the camels in the Zoo, Mr. Self and Mr.

  <p>The former is the officially appointed keeper, with the regular badge and
  uniform. He has been master of the camels for more than forty years, and
  knows a family (human) infant representatives of which he has led round on
  camel-rides for three generations. What Self doesn't know about the little
  fads and fancies of "the hairy scary oont" there is nobody to tell him. He is
  a wary and observant person, is Self.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag03-21.gif"

  <p>When a man has been forty years watching the affably-smiling camel, and
  looking out to avoid being suddenly jammed to death against a wall, or having
  his face bitten off and his feet viciously trodden on, wary observation
  begins to be natural with him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Toots occupies quite a different position in life from Mr. Self, being
  a cat. Mr. Toots, as fits his name, is a quiet and reserved cat. Bob and Rose
  are quite friendly with Mr. Toots, and will, if possible, avoid stepping on
  him, which is an astonishing degree of amiability in a camel; but, of course,
  so far as Rose is concerned, she is an unusually amiable camel. Mr. Toots is
  a noticeable, carroty cat, and you can't deceive either Bob or Rose with a
  substitute. Once Mr. Toots was unwell, and a tabby was installed, as a
  temporary experiment, in his place. Bob was determined to suppress all
  spurious imitations, and the last worldly sensation of that unhappy tabby was
  conveyed through the medium of Bob's fantastic toe. Therefore Mr. Toots still
  maintains his monopoly, and may sit among Bob's or Rose's feet with
  confidence. Tom, however, doesn't know him, and won't. So that Mr. Toots,
  with the wisely accommodating spirit of his namesake, says&mdash;"Oh, it's of
  no consequence, thank you&mdash;no consequence at all, I'm sure," and gets
  away from Tom to bask in the magnificent patronage of Bob the Bactrian and
  the lady next door.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag03-22.gif"

  <p>Cantankerous and uncertain as is the character of the camel, there is a
  deal of human nature about him. When he has packed into his character all the
  possible devil, and ostrich, and orphan, there is still room for much human
  cussedness, and it is there. You shall see it even in his very face. There is
  a world of expression in a camel's face, misleading often to a stranger, but
  with a human deceit. The face lends itself particularly to varied and
  strongly marked expression. The nostrils will open and close with a great
  flexibility, and the lips and eyebrows are more loose and mobile still. What
  more machinery may the camel want for the facial expression of his ill
  qualities? With such a lip and nose he can sneer as never can human thing;
  this at the humble person who brings him no biscuit. He can guffaw
  coarsely&mdash;and with no sound beyond a rare grunt. Furious malice is
  native to his face, and a self-sufficient conceit and superciliousness comes
  with full feeding. Even in his least expressive slumber the camel is smugly
  complacent, although his inborn genius cannot teach him that a piece of
  cardboard is not a biscuit.</p>

  <p class="first">WHEN I have wandered about the Zoo in a proper zigzag of a
  suitable derangement; when Samson has been nodded to, Bob the Bactrian
  chatted with, and other acquaintances called upon; and when a naturally lazy
  disposition suggests a rest, I like to sit opposite the great birdcage, which
  is officially declared a pond&mdash;the Night Herons' Pond&mdash;and look
  upon the small world there living and moving. Everything is busy&mdash;ducks,
  gulls, herons, egrets, umbres, flamingoes, ruffs, spoonbills,
  screamers&mdash;all but the doves, who are lazy and sulky&mdash;each in his
  own particular way. Each, that is to say, in his own particular method and
  action, for each has the same object&mdash;something to eat. It is a
  wonderful thing to observe&mdash;this persistence of birds after something to
  eat. Capture almost any bird you please, fill him with somewhere about double
  his own bulk of food, and let him go again. In two minutes you shall find
  that bird gravely prospecting about and making all sorts of experimental
  borings&mdash;for something to eat. And birds show the most extraordinary
  conviction of the edibility of the world in general.</p><img src=
  "1500391h-images/ZigZag04-02.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Most birds will extract nourishment somehow from a brick, an old nail, or
  a broken bottle; those who can't will try. And when a certain tract has been
  searched through, pebble by pebble, and found to be absolutely barren, then
  they will begin on it again, on the off-chance of a thrown brick or the
  passing of some human creature in the meantime having left behind it
  something to eat.</p>

  <p>Here most of the birds are omnivorous&mdash;certainly none are vegetarians
  but the doves. The doves, as vegetarians, represent the brotherhood, or the
  cause, or the belief, or whatever it is, rather unfavourably.</p><img src=
  "1500391h-images/ZigZag04-04.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The dove can never do anything much credit, being rather an insignificant
  humbug itself. Here, in contrast with the rest, you observe it as a miserably
  inactive and sulky little bird, who won't join anything else in a hopeless
  food-hunt, but is as greedy as all the rest together when the keeper brings a
  regular meal. Also it growls and fumes angrily at the friendly approach of
  any other bird&mdash;a bird probably who would make little trouble of eating
  it at a sitting, beak and all. And sitting in fluffy little groups of two or
  three, it grunts pharisaically at the good-humoured ibis below, as he tosses
  his long beak and swallows whatever animal food it may have found him. The
  dove takes life more easily than any of the other birds in the place, and
  still goes about (or, more ordinarily, sits still) grumbling, peevish, and
  spiteful.</p>

  <p>The flamingoes forming the upper ten (as well as four can) in this little
  world, insist on being served from a lordly pail, from which, their heads
  being inverted, their upper beaks scoop.</p>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>The heron, although no inferior searcher of the ground, will never trouble
  unnecessarily about provisions already in a safe place. No provisions are in
  a safe place here among so many birds; but Jerry, the solitary purple heron
  in the cage just behind us, has a tiny pond to himself. Throw a little fish
  therein, soon after Jerry's dinner. Jerry, without leaving his perch, will
  inspect it narrowly&mdash;from above, to see if it be alive; from the side,
  to judge of its plumpness; and from each other direction, for purposes which
  any other intelligent heron will at once understand. Then Jerry will return
  to his siesta, his next snack assured, for he knows that the fish can never
  leave the pond.</p>

  <p>A bird will never sacrifice an ounce of dignity if it may be saved.
  Observe a little crowd of the smaller birds here swoop upon a handful of
  biscuit-crumbs&mdash;ruffs, gulls, and maybe a little oyster-catcher; see
  then a larger bird approach. All these dignified little birds at once raise
  their beaks and stalk gravely and deliberately off, with an unconcerned
  expression of having had quite enough for themselves, so that the big bird
  may do as he likes with the remainder.</p>

  <p>The sudden appearance of a man in the inclosure may cause what seems to be
  a temporary upset of the general dignity&mdash;that of all the birds, big or
  little. All join in a tempestuous swirl, filling the air with flappings and
  small shrieks. But, the shock over, the swirl becomes nothing but the
  collective fly round, by way of exercise, which is a regular part of the
  day's enjoyment at the Night Herons' Pond.</p>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>Though the man stay, the swirl will soon settle, and the swirlers join in
  a stately walk-off&mdash;away from the man, however&mdash;a sort of quaintly
  regular parade&mdash;a church parade, let us say, for its decorum. The most
  imposing parader is the horned screamer, who is a sort of pageant by himself.
  He stands upright, spreads his wings wide, throws his head back, and lifts
  his extensive feet much before him&mdash;a very beadle, a very drum-major
  among birds.</p>

  <p>Wherever so many animals as this, of any sort, be gathered together, there
  will be found some comedy characters. The African hammer-head (or, more
  politely, the tufted umbre) is a comedy character, when he is on foot. His
  comic head labels him at once; and he plays up to his comic head. He doesn't
  join in the swirl when a man comes in&mdash;on the contrary, he runs towards
  him, and, cocking his sharp eye, looks out for&mdash;something to eat. Then,
  as the man moves off, the hammer-head trots zealously after his heels,
  looking for that something to eat in the boot tracks. A human being, in the
  belief of the hammer-head, is a moving thing which exudes everywhere
  something to eat.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag04-08.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration"> <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag04-09.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">Wherefore, in whatsoever place a human being may have been,
  and upon or near whatsoever thing he may have touched, the hammer-head
  expects to find refreshments. He rushes immediately to that place and hunts
  assiduously. If he find nothing, his first expression is one of unbounded
  surprise.</p>

  <p>The laws of Nature, it would seem, are being defied. So he looks again, to
  make quite sure. But there is really nothing. He thinks for a second, and
  then glares with sharp suspicion in the direction of the retreating
  creature.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag04-10.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>It can't be a human being, after all. It is a mere fraud; some conceited
  thing trying to look like one. Else, why isn't there something to eat? And he
  turns off with contempt. But when the hammer-head takes to flying, the low
  comedy goes, and, with his broad brown wings and swooping flight, he is
  rather a professional beauty than otherwise. Nothing but the flap of the
  hammer-head's wings will disturb the sulky heron&mdash;the solitary
  misanthrope whose place is the right-hand upper corner of the great cage, and
  whom nothing will tempt down.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag04-11.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The spoonbill might be a professional beauty himself, if he could always
  be looked at sideways&mdash;a white, graceful, slim-beaked beauty; but he
  will turn his head about (looking for something to eat), and then that
  fearful, bibulous nose upsets the picture completely.</p>

  <p>Even the snowy egret provides a little fun at times, although he doesn't
  mean it. He is very much in earnest, is the snowy egret, and objects, with
  long claws and a very sharp beak, to the earthly existence of all other
  living things.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag04-12.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>He has given up chasing the other birds about the inclosure, because he
  couldn't always catch the little ones, and sometimes the big ones caught him.
  So he sits on a convenient tree and waits for anything assailable to come
  within two yards. Then every fine feather on his body stands up electrically,
  and&mdash;well, go and see him, if you like a picture of fury. It isn't
  always easy to express your egret&mdash;this last being a sentence wherein
  one might build a laborious pun were the laws of ordinary decency in
  abeyance.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag04-13.gif"

  <p>But the great bird here is the flamingo. I like the flamingo. He runs a
  deal to neck and legs, but his heart is in the right place. It really can't
  help it. You can't imagine a startled flamingo's heart jumping into his
  mouth&mdash;the way is too long and bendy; while as to its sinking into his
  boots, even if he had any&mdash;just look at his legs! When first I arrive at
  this inclosure I always whistle for Sam, the big flamingo. Sam immediately
  lifts his head and takes a long sideways look to assure himself that it is an
  acquaintance, and not an impertinent stranger; then he says "Kra-a-ak!" and
  goes on looking for something to eat. I reply cheerily. He lifts his head
  again, and approaching the wires and standing at his full height, with
  outstretched wings, says "Kra-a-ak"&mdash;not at all the same word, observe,
  although of the same spelling; the tone and meaning being more confidential.
  Thereafter he keeps nearer, and we conduct a mutually improving conversation
  of whistles and kra-a-aks.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag04-14.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"

  <p>Sam is the acknowledged monarch of this inclosure. He is a gentle and
  considerate monarch, but won't stand any nonsense. He has been observed to
  inspect the small dove-cots fixed upon the trees in the inclosure, as
  considering it ill-fitting that the subject should enjoy a roofed habitation
  and the king none; but considering the habitation itself equally
  ill-fitting&mdash;except regarded as a waistcoat&mdash;appears not yet to
  have attempted to take possession. Sam, stately bird, presides over his
  subjects with a proper majesty. He looks from aloft upon their little
  weaknesses, their small fads, their quarrels and their friendships, and is
  amused, in a lofty and superior sort of way, just as you and I are, my
  friend.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag04-15.gif"

  <p>He looks from above with indif­ferent interest on the ruffs, for instance.
  The ruffs are small, but there is character about them. See two approach each
  other from opposite directions&mdash;looking, perhaps, for some­thing to eat.
  They meet, stop, straddle wide their legs, and blow up their neck-feathers.
  Regarding each other fixedly, they rock solemnly to and fro. Then they let
  fall their collars and go off, each on his way, as though nothing had
  happened.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag04-16.gif"

  <p>It is a rude courtesy&mdash;a sort of ruff etiquette, in fact. Sometimes,
  however, this putting on of frills&mdash;a the same thing will do in other
  places&mdash;leads to fights.</p>

  <p>And over all reigns the majestic Sam&mdash;over the fluffy-necked little
  ruff, the perky hammerhead, the dissipated spoonbill, the jolly ibis, the
  sedate screamer, and the excitable egret. Nothing can disturb Sam's
  serenity&mdash;nothing, at any rate, which can happen in this
  aviary.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag04-17.gif"

  <p>One thing might do it&mdash;a thing I hope never to see happen. An
  ill-natured keeper might bring in a common goose, and introduce him. Now, I
  believe that this would cut Sam's feelings sorely, because the flamingo,
  after all (although here it is treason to say so), is really only a kind of
  goose, in the classification of the spiteful naturalist; and publicly to
  bring him face to face with his vulgar and ungraceful poor relation would
  give Sam away cruelly among his subjects. The poor relation is a mere low
  caricature of Sam in neck and legs; and a thing which, in its own ridiculous
  way, makes a preposterous showing off and posing of its burlesque
  neck.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag04-18.gif"

  <p>Which reflection leads us to another&mdash;that the birds in this
  inclosure may be classified into two sorts: those who are proud of their
  necks&mdash;as the ruffs and flamingoes; and those who are ashamed of
  them&mdash;as the herons, who bury them between their shoulders, until, from
  the back, you shall judge one a humpbacked old witch and a thing of evil.</p>

  <p>King Sam, with all his majesty, must take exercise sometimes&mdash;usually
  after the royal bath. Whereat all other birds avoid his path, and hide in
  unconsidered corners. Sam's exercise is a devastating rush, comprehending all
  this inclosure, without consideration for trees, or shrubs, or birds, or
  rocks, or water. He merely sweep through all, in strides of many yards, with
  outstretched neck, and wings a-spread and gorgeous in black and scarlet. This
  for some five stormy minutes, and with again and again a "Kra-a-ak."</p>

  <p>One only among the flamingo nobility retains, in this climate, a pink
  flush over all his outer feathers; and he, good soul, is subject to
  rheumatism or some similar affliction; wherefore he limps painfully until
  Church, the keeper, anoints his legs with oil, and is an object of small
  consideration among the plebeian gulls and ducks about him; for wherein is
  the grandeur of rheumatic legs, even when so many times as long as thick? And
  so, in a quiet corner, he stands, with a special pail of refreshment within
  beak-reach, and nurses his affliction. And smaller birds, with a certain
  timorous impudence&mdash;for he has still a fearsome beak, which will reach a
  long way&mdash;trot up and pretend to sympathize with him.</p><img src=

  <p class="first">A TIGER is not a lion. This will be understood, though I
  treat of tigers in a leonine chapter. For neither is a leopard a lion, nor a
  cheetah, nor a puma, yet all these live in the lion-house. Wherefore must the
  title be held to refer to the locality, and not to a section of its
  inhabitants. This is probably called the lion-house in a formal survival of
  the spirit which gives the lion a kingship among the lower animals. But the
  lion really is a fraud&mdash;as much so, at any rate, as the camel. It is
  very sad to find so many downright frauds among the innocent lower animals,
  but there isn't a department in these Gardens where you shall not discover a
  humbug of some sort. In this house, perhaps, there is less humbug about the
  tigers than about any or the others, although even the tiger has his little
  hypocrisies; still he is justly and honestly indignant that the place, by
  title, should be given to the lions, and is supercilious in his bearing to
  human creatures in consequence.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag05-02.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>It must be noted that the show of lions here to be seen, large as it is,
  is by no means fully representative of the various species. There are none of
  the more familiar of our English lions; the Red Lion, the White Lion, the
  Blue Lion&mdash;to say nothing of the accompanying
  stomach-warmer&mdash;familiar as they are in our town streets, are not to be
  found here; nor is that noble creature, the lion of heraldry. This is a pity;
  because here he would be fed, and would get rid of that painfully
  greyhound-like waist which is among the more noticeable of his
  characteristics; and I should have an opportunity of inspecting that
  extraordinary growth, his tail, with its many vigorous sprouts and branches;
  and many other of his members, an acquaintance of which in the flesh I have
  long much desired.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag05-03.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Nor is the King of Beasts represented as he was of old in the British
  Museum&mdash;by the remarkable species <i>Leo shagbagga stuficus</i>;
  wherefore also I grieve. For in the museum variety were many strange bodily
  developments and physical functions unknown among others. <i>Leo shagbagga
  stufficus</i> might be approached with perfect safety, and any naturalist
  sufficiently intrepid might, in the fabled manner of Richard Coeur de Lion,
  boldly thrust his hand deep between the beast's open jaws, and from his
  innermost vitals extract upholstery. It was never very good upholstery, being
  chiefly flue and dusty straw, but it was quite equal to imparting a
  distinctive want of shape which at once stamped <i>Leo shagbagga</i> an
  unique species. The tail, also, has been known to yield walking sticks.
  External patches of differing tints, attached by large stitches of
  pack-thread, did not indicate a separate variety of this species, being
  peculiar to individuals only.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag05-04.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>I fear <i>Leo shagbagga</i> is now an extinct species, but the Blue Lion,
  the White Lion, and the Red Lion we may see every day&mdash;although not
  here&mdash;and become intimately acquainted with. Also we may see the British
  Lion&mdash;the cartoon lion&mdash;who waves a Union Jack, wears a straw hat,
  and smokes a pipe. Familiarity with the lion has bred so much contempt for
  him that really we shall be going very little further in classing him a
  domestic animal. They keep him in a shed, whack him with a stick, and make
  him jump through a hoop&mdash;and a poor old sheep he seems, he who is
  treated thus in caravans. The lion, as I have said, is a fraud; a posing,
  theatrical, Turveydrop and Bobadil of a fraud.</p><img src=

  <p>Look at him in this, his house. He turns up his nose at the visitors an
  affects a magnanimous superiority. If he were a human thing he would wear
  <i>pince-nez</i> and a velvet jacket, and look pityingly great at picture
  shows, though in his inner heart a mere beer-drinking vulgarian and a smoker
  of pipes. So always with the lion; he will pose fine and large if he meet you
  out for a walk in a jungle, and do his utmost to terrify you; if driven to it
  he may take the liberty of helping himself to a mouthful of you. But all this
  is only if he has first failed to sneak away unobserved. In South Africa a
  team-driver, finding a family of lions in his path, will calmly take his long
  stock-whip and whip them away; and they go meekly, glad to escape the lash.
  When no stock-whip is handy, a traveller from England is
  used&mdash;preferably with a title.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag05-06.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Here in one respect only are the lions treated with absolute cruelty, but
  in that respect the cruelty is of an aggravated sort. Come into the
  lion-house at what time, on what day (except Saturday and Sunday) you please,
  and you shall find various artists, and more various people who are not, nor
  ever will be artists, sketching and daubing and outraging the features and
  the feelings of lions and tigers.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag05-07.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Perhaps, however, it is a moral dispensa­tion, teaching the animals to
  look for­ward to Sunday with longing, as a day of blessed relief and rest;
  guarding their conduct in the matter of Sunday observance, while the bars and
  the keeper take care of it in other matters.</p>

  <p>Little defence is available against all these daubers; but it is possible
  for a lion or a tiger to lie lifelessly and flat upon its side, offering only
  the uninspiriting outline of a rug or an empty sack, as though the pelt had
  been cast, and the animal were somewhere else.</p>´

  <p>This expedient is largely practised, until it would seem the most natural
  thing in the world for a keeper to enter with a pitchfork and toss all those
  empty skins into one heap, to be carried away on wheelbarrows. Of the
  counter-expedients of the artists&mdash;of the pinchings of tails left near
  bars, of the twitchings of protrusive whiskers, and the pea-shootings in the
  countenance&mdash;let there be silence, lest others be tempted to imitate and
  fall victims to the casual paw, or to the little less deadly detection of
  Sutton, the keeper.</p>

  <p>Even a humbug may be a handsome humbug. Look at Duke, the wicked old
  Nubian in the end cage, as he sits serenely and loftily looking over your
  head. He knows better than you do that you admire his fine, uplifted head and
  his great tawny and black mane.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag05-10.gif"
        style="float:left"

        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Duke is a great character in his way. Handsome old chap as he is, and
  proud of it, Duke never was a gallant&mdash;never a lioness's lion. All sorts
  of attempts have been made during his long residence here to mate him, but
  Duke draws the line at Duchesses. Perhaps he would treat the ladies better if
  he were allowed to make his own selection. When they are chosen by the
  keepers he chews them himself. He once gave a lioness a fatal bite, but that
  is his only claim to the designation of a lady-killer. And so he lies curled
  up alone, hugging himself with reciprocal affection. I remember a keeper once
  making a long and elaborate joke about this lion putting up his dukes and
  putting down the Duchesses, but have forgotten its exact terms.</p><img src=
  "1500391h-images/ZigZag05-12.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Another lion, a little further along, does all Duke's share of
  love-making, in addition to more than his own. The keepers have their own
  name for this lion, but I prefer to call him The Gentleman Next Door, any
  lioness who happens to be in the adjoining cage being Mrs. Nickleby. He does
  not throw her cucumbers and vegetable marrows, for several obvious reasons;
  but he roars and scratches at the iron partition door with a vigour proper to
  the part, while Mrs. Nickleby lolls indifferently in her own place. Prince
  and Nancy are a fine old couple of lions&mdash;married fifteen years, and a
  peaceable, comfortable old pair still. Ask Sutton, the head lion-keeper,
  about Prince and Nancy. Sutton, by-the-bye, will soon have been employed in
  these gardens for forty years. If I were a statistician I probably could
  prove, by rule of arithmetic, that Sutton has been killed many times over, in
  the course of so many years among lions and tigers. Not being a statistician,
  I am compelled to admit that he hasn't. Sutton enjoys the distinction of
  being the only thing in the lion-house never sketched by the artists and the
  sketchers who are not artists.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag05-13.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>It is noticeable that a lion&mdash;any lion, every lion&mdash;likes to
  take his ease with his nose stuffed out between the bars&mdash;by way,
  probably, of sniffing the air of freedom, and feeling as much at liberty as
  possible in the circumstances, regardless of contact with the iron of the
  cage. I am not sure that this muzzle-exposure is always good for Felis Leo; I
  have a suspicion that it may be responsible for some of the toothaches
  wherewith he now and again is afflicted, and ascribes, probably, to Sutton's
  partiality for open windows. A lion with a toothache is a pitiable thing;
  still, a thing to which I should prefer to administer comfort from the
  opposite side of the bars; and one the extraction of whose tooth I could
  leave, without envy, in other hands. Any person of ordinary humanity would
  prefer losing a tooth of his own to inflicting the pain of extraction
  upon&mdash;say Duke here&mdash;with his own hand. There is more tenderness
  for the feelings of dumb animals than one might imagine in the world, in such
  circumstances as these. Although why Duke should be called a dumb animal is
  not easy to explain after hearing his shocking language if dinner arrives a
  little later than suits him.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag05-14.gif"

        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Notwithstanding all his grandeur and all his posing, the lion doesn't
  sufficiently wash his face; nor, indeed, any other part of himself. A tiger's
  ablutionary lickings are disproportionately few and small in area compared
  with those of the humble tom-cat of our native tiles. But compared with those
  of the lion they are profuse, excessive, superfluous. The lion has not yet
  learned the lesson of personal cleanliness. Some day, if I think of it when I
  see him, I shall suggest to Sutton the expedient of turning the garden hose
  on these lions. I don't believe they would enjoy it at first, but their
  education must begin somewhere. And Sutton might find this process more
  convenient than an actual bodily assault with soap and towels, although,
  considered as a spectacle, this plan would have its merits; and might command
  its price as an advertisement for the soap.</p><img src=

        title="Illustration">

  <p>There are other respects in which the lion compares unfavourably with the
  tiger. Watch them yawning. Yawning, by-the-bye, is the only really
  fashionable amusement here in the lion-house&mdash;after eating. One of the
  cheetahs has a wooden ball to play with, but a cheetah is naturally low in
  his tastes, and even he is ashamed of the amusement, pursuing it by stealth,
  when unobserved, and concealing the ball by lying before it when visitors
  arrive; and in his inner heart I feel sure he prefers eating&mdash;if not
  yawning.</p>

  <p>I have before now felt suspicious of the genuine character of some of the
  yawns here to be inspected. There are really too many of them. It is largely
  a mere posing and show-off. "Law, Maria," says the country cousin, "look at
  him a-gapin'; what awful teeth!" and the lion (or tiger as may be) likes it,
  seizing the first opportunity of gaping again, and extracting more flattery.
  So that yawning has become a fashionable pursuit. But there is an inferiority
  in the lion's yawn. The tiger opens his head frankly and fully, baring his
  gums and exposing his teeth in all their vicious pointedness. It is a fierce
  yawn, a downright yawn, such a yawn as could be no yawn but a tiger's. The
  lion's might almost be a sheep's. His heavy lips overhang his gums like those
  of a toothless old woman. It is a mere slovenly, ridiculous yawn, with no
  terror in it. The lips retract a little perhaps as the mouth closes, but all
  the lustre is already gone from out of that yawn.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Anybody who looks at the matter with the least care may see that in all
  things the lion has been accorded an elevation which is not his right. The
  superstition is long a-dying, even among the lower animals themselves. The
  puma here, for instance, puffed up with a ridiculous vanity born of having
  been called the American lion by some naturalist who should have known
  better, rolls among his bed-straw until enough hangs about his ears to
  represent a mane, and then stalks forth to be admired. He is encouraged by
  ignorant visitors who, from his size and colour, assume him to be a young
  lion, and call him one. I have even heard these sages disputing about his
  age, and walking off saturated with the animosity born of contentious
  ignorance, without once looking at the label which published the creature's
  pumaship to all the world. This sort of thing turns the puma's head, and
  makes a fool of him.</p>

  <p>The tiger's superiority to the lion consists chiefly in his candour. He is
  a wicked, vicious rascal, a thief and a murderer, and he owns it. He doesn't
  pose. He would always rather run away than be bothered with fighting, unless
  he happen to be hungry, and so would the lion.</p><img src=

  <p>But the lion will attitudinize if he thinks you have observed him, and try
  to make his running away look like magnanimity. The tiger simply bundles off,
  without any false pride. These particulars I give on hearsay evidence. They
  did not seem sufficiently important to warrant the expense of a personal
  test. Anybody anxious to know more of the lion or tiger has open to him
  several means of acquiring information at first hand&mdash;among others,
  palmistry. Both the lion and the tiger have paws of great mobility of
  expression. I have no doubt that if a skilful chiromancist were carefully and
  painstakingly to examine the paws of either Duke the lion or Tommy the big
  tiger here, he would before very long be greatly struck by them. Indeed,
  persons with very little practical knowledge of palmistry have been known,
  after a very short acquaintance with a tiger's paw, to carry away an
  extremely vivid impression thereof.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag05-21.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>It should be more generally understood that a tiger does not eat buns.
  There is a popular superstition that he does&mdash;a superstition extending
  also to lunch biscuits, bull's-eyes, and acidulated drops. Worthy old ladies
  are the chief votaries of the bun superstition, little boys and girls
  attending school treats taking the bull's-eye and acidulated drop branch. A
  tiger doesn't resent the offer of a bun as an insult&mdash;he is merely
  amused. Offer a bun to Duke, and he will express a desire to bite off half of
  you at once.</p>

  <p>Tommy and Minnie are a long-wedded tiger couple&mdash;at the opposite end
  to Duke. And in their cage, if feeding-time be near, you shall see a quaint
  thing. Every animal in this place carries an internal clock of extreme
  accuracy, which sets him roaring furiously a little before four
  o'clock&mdash;every one but Tommy. Tommy makes a clock of himself entirety,
  to measure up the tedious minutes. He makes no sound, but walks, persistently
  following his tail, in a circle. As the minutes pass the circle narrows and
  the pace quickens, until, as the dinner-waggon rolls in its appointed
  grooves, he turns completely on an axis, his head making to the left, his
  tail to the right. And so until his dinner is actually within the bars, when
  he picks it up in his stride and retreats with it to a corner.</p><img src=

  <p>The smallest cat here is not on show. This is Dodger, the baby tiger. He
  lives in an elegant private bed-sitting-room, built of strong planks, at the
  back of the house, by the door of Sutton's quarters, and in full view of the
  iron bathing-machine arrangement whereby the lions and tigers pass out to
  their back playgrounds in fine weather. The Dodger is not, perhaps,
  altogether beautiful&mdash;in a physical sense. He runs largely to ears and
  feet, and has the general appearance of having been put together hurriedly,
  with the wrong neck. But Dodger means well, and will play with your hands as
  long as you please to risk a nip of the teeth. If you are a stranger he will
  mew at you at first, which, as his voice is just breaking, is an exhilarating
  thing to hear, being a varying compound of roar, howl, mew, and whimper,
  grateful to the tympanum. But he soon grows friendly, especially if you place
  your hand casually on the dinner-waggon standing near his
  quarters.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag05-23.gif"

  <p class="first">Another affable creature is the cheetah. With his lithe
  limbs, strong neck, and small bullet head, he has a certain prize-fighting
  appearance, but, like the Game Chicken, is quite affable. The cheetahs here
  are subjected to a certain ignominy which I trust and believe the Society is
  not intentionally responsible for. A board inscribed "Beware of Pickpockets"
  is hung conspicuously over their heads. It is scarcely credible that the
  proximity is intended as suggesting a horrible pun upon the name of the poor
  animals, but it arouses suspicions in the minds of some people, and is apt to
  place the unfortunate cheetahs in the abject position of accomplices in the
  outrage. And when the Dodger is promoted to one of these large cages, the
  suspicion in his case may even be greater, and naturally; with the possibly
  redeeming feature that only a lame joke, and not an inhuman pun, will be
  suspected. Before then, however, the reproach may be removed.</p><img src=

  <p>In the early morning, before the gardens are opened, Sutton, Dodger, and
  the cheetah go out for a walk about the grounds, amid a shower of envy.
  Michael, the big bear, in particular, looks from behind his window blinds in
  much displeasure. I should like to take Michael out for a stroll&mdash;say
  along the Strand; there would be a deal to amuse him.</p>

  <p>It is a pity that some of the leopards are not as good-humoured as Dodger
  and the cheetahs.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag05-25.gif"

  <p>One particular pair live in a perpetual mutual threat to bite off each
  other's heads. Anything is a sufficient provocation. Whatever the one is
  doing arouses the jealousy of the other&mdash;and there you are!</p>

  <p>We human animals have long held a conceited belief that other creatures
  shrink and cower under the gaze of our eyes; and as example we point to the
  big cats. A tiger, we say, will not look a man in the face. He won't, but
  fear is not his motive. It is superciliousness&mdash;a lofty affectation of
  indifference, and nothing else.</p>

  <p>Every cat is the same in this respect&mdash;lion, tiger, leopard, panther,
  Tom or tabby. It is only another expression of the cat's native vanity.
  Loving to be stared at and admired, he makes a great show of the most
  contemptuous indifference to everybody. Before you reach the cage you may now
  and again detect, from the corner of your eye, the cat observing you with
  some interest; after you have passed you may see the same thing&mdash;if you
  are very sly. But while you are before him, and looking at him, the tiger
  cuts you dead. You don't exist&mdash;you are mere impalpable
  space.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag05-27.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Some people don't like this treatment and wave sticks and umbrellas to
  attract his attention; but he only gazes dreamily away into some other region
  of space. They get angrier, and hurl guidebooks and cigar-ends; and he stares
  placidly at the ceiling. They waggle hats on sticks; as irritatingly as
  possible, and he glances casually at his bedroom door. Even when it seems
  proper to transfer his gaze from the space at the left of his interviewer to
  that at his right, it sweeps round with a most offensive air of passing over
  mere space; or perhaps it passes over the insulted person's head. With the
  keeper it is different. No tiger is a hero to his keeper, and the tiger knows
  it. The keeper has found him out long ago, and it is useless to attitudinize
  before <i>him</i>, or to attempt to ignore his existence. So the tiger tries
  to rush at him under the bars. The keeper is associated in his mind, and very
  naturally, with something to eat. The keeper always appears with the beef,
  but although the beef comes between the bars, he is always defrauded of the
  keeper. Wherefore the keeper is a <i>bête-noir</i>, a constant reminder of a
  good meal put under his nose and taken away again.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it may be hinted to those nobly ambitious of attracting the notice
  of a lion or tiger, that the hat-trick may be expensive if tried upon a young
  and frolicsome animal. A sudden temptation, such as the offer of a new hat,
  may cause a young lion or tiger to forget his dignity for some little
  time&mdash;as long as the hat lasts. It was a very few Sundays ago that
  Victoria&mdash;the young lioness here belonging to the Queen&mdash;secured a
  very decent bowler, which had been extended with a view of reaching something
  from the ledge before the cage. Victor, her mate, although, of course,
  connected with Royalty by marriage, so far unbent as to participate in that
  hat, which provided a pleasant twenty minutes' entertainment; at the close of
  which the late owner borrowed a peaked cap from the keeper, and went home.
  But Victor does not unbend as a rule. He is an affable lion, however,
  perfectly friendly with those he knows. He might almost be allowed out, were
  it not that the artists and the photographers, and the daubers and sketchers
  who are neither, would probably suffer from his natural indignation. So he
  sits behind the bars and dreams of the golden time when all things shall be
  free and equal, and he shall kick those people and all their works into the
  outer darkness.</p>

  <p class="first">SUFFA CULLI, Jung Perchad, Jingo, and Solomon&mdash;where
  are their enemies? What human thing so base as nurse ili-will for the genial
  elephant? The jolly elephant&mdash;the meek, all-obedient elephant&mdash;the
  elephant, who provides the world with ivory, and Sunday-school anecdotes, and
  rides for twopence! Though I turn from my fellow-man&mdash;having found him
  out&mdash;though every other thing that crawls, runs, or flies revolt me,
  still may I keep my faith in the elephant; for assuredly he will be worthy
  thereof. He, almost alone among living creatures, has never betrayed my
  trust. I believed in the lion&mdash;the picture-books of infancy taught me of
  his valour, his magnanimity, and all the rest; but the lion has turned out an
  impostor. I believed in the camel&mdash;his intelligence, his long-suffering
  docility; but the camel is a humbug. In the elephant I may still believe. All
  those charming stories, wherein the elephant never forgets an injury, nor is
  ungrateful for a benefit&mdash;usually expressing the facts by squirting
  water over somebody&mdash;all those charming stories I may still turn to for
  comfort amid the tribulations of this world, with confidence that even if
  they are not all strictly true, they are at least reasonable lies.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag06-02.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>I look back with much affection upon the virtuously-squirting elephant.
  The squirtee most clearly to be remembered is the bad tailor who pricked the
  elephant's trunk.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag06-03.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The squirter was, I believe, the first elephant whose acquaintance I made.
  I certainly knew him long before I knew that other virtuous elephant who
  broke a man's head with a cocoanut, to compensate the man for breaking a
  cocoanut with his head. I almost think I knew him before I first met the
  Noah's Ark elephant. The Noah's Ark elephant was my most confidential
  playmate, and tasted rather of garden-mould till the paint came off, when he
  lost his grittiness and became a pig, having broken his trunk. He was not
  very broad in the back, it is true, having been made of a flat piece of wood,
  but he was a very interesting animal before he was a pig.</p><img src=
  "1500391h-images/ZigZag06-04.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>I was much more intimate with him than with Noah, who was a little stiff,
  not to say stuck-up. As a pig his career ended suddenly in a memorable
  maritime disaster&mdash;when a vessel in my ownership, chartered at the time
  as a cattle-boat, foundered in the duck pond with most of the farmyard and a
  good deal of the ark.</p>

  <p>It was while the Noah's Ark elephant was a pig that I first saw the circus
  elephant. He was not altogether a fair specimen. He was rude. He rang an
  immense railway bell for his dinner, and when he had finished one course,
  swept everything off the table with his foot. None of the elephants in this
  place would behave like that. Even Jingo and Solomon, who are
  young&mdash;mere boys&mdash;know better than that, and take buns and apples
  most respectfully. The circus elephant, too, played low practical jokes with
  the clown, and danced on a tub at a fatal sacrifice of dignity.</p><img src=

  <p>In Sir John Maundevile I still have a dear friend among what that charming
  old truth-monger called the "olifaunts." He has curly tusks and a bushy tail,
  and carries a very tall castle on his back, with mighty battlements. He is
  more startling even than our old friend of the Surrey side, once
  ignominiously cleped the "Pig and Tinder-box." When first I met the pantomime
  elephant I cannot remember. But I have often met him since, and more than
  once I have been permitted to refresh one or both ends of him with
  half-and-half. He is the only elephant of my acquaintance whose magnificence
  has turned out to be hollow. Anatomically, he is simple, his viscera
  consisting almost entirely of two convenient handles, whereby his trunk and
  tail may be made to swing.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag06-06.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>I knew an exceptionally talented forelegs, who drew extra pay for his
  ability to knock off a stage policeman's helmet with the trunk. But he was
  subject to the infirmities of genius, and once, under an exceptional burden
  of half-and-half, fell ruinously down a trap-door with all the front half of
  the structure and the Great Mogul, who was in the howdah. Also, I knew a
  hindlegs&mdash;but that is another story.</p>

  <p>The late Albert Smith once knew a sponge-cake elephant&mdash;but that also
  is another story. There is moreover another story still&mdash;any number of
  other stories&mdash;about the burglar-elephant. He is always in the papers.
  He gets away from a menagerie and shoves in the front of a tuck-shop with his
  head; after which he eats the tuck-shop, shutters and all, and goes to sleep
  on the ruins of the house.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag06-07.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Sometimes he goes the rounds of a market and samples things in general. He
  is very catholic in his tastes, and will toss off a scuttleful of coals or a
  suit of ready-made clothes with equal freedom and good humour. He has also
  been known to break into a pill factory, being afterwards used as an
  advertisement for the pills. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
  Animals seems to have had no means of preventing the perpetration of this
  form of revenge.</p>

  <p>Here, at the Zoo, the elephants are much too respectably brought up for
  this sort of thing. Still they are not muffs, and wilt take their beer and
  'bacca in all good-fellowship. Leave no unprotected pocket wherein cigars
  within the sweep of Jung Perchad's trunk.</p>

  <p>For 'bacca he will chew and beer drink, if Iles, his keeper, but leaves
  him for two minutes to his wicked devices. Here we have the elephant's one
  little vice. He will hang about a bar. See here, on summer days when all four
  leave their work of carrying childhood in two-pennyworths; just on the home
  side of the tunnel under the Outer Circle stands a refreshment bar.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag06-08.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>With any excuse whatsoever, but usually with no excuse at all, Jung
  Perchad, Suffa Culli, Jingo, and Solomon will linger wistfully about this
  bar. Buns are their ostensible object, but I know they covet
  beer.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag06-09.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Even a bun, however, will be taken in good part, and it takes a vast
  number of buns to offend an elephant. Buns, indeed, are the civilized
  elephant's chief article of commerce, and between the elephants and the bears
  is much trade rivalry. Solomon is understood to be agitating for a pole, to
  place the establishment upon an equal footing with the opposition.</p>

  <p>Bank Holiday is a terrible day for these elephants. No reasonable elephant
  can refuse a bun, or an apple, or a lead-pencil, or a boy's hat, when it is
  offered. It might hurt the donor's feelings; further, some day, in the
  winter, when nobody comes, he might want just such refreshment.</p><img src=
  "1500391h-images/ZigZag06-10.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>But it is sad to think of the faithful elephant towards the end of the
  day, weighed down to the very earth with the offerings of an injudicious
  public, helplessly contemplating the last bun, with no inch of storage
  left.</p>

  <p>And sadder to know that, when the struggle is done, and that last bun
  deposited, with dolor and affliction, upon the varied accumulation which he
  envelops, that elephant will proceed indoors to face the officially-provided
  supper&mdash;a barn full of "cow's wittles" (Suffolkese) and a serried
  company of pails full of mash. What he does with the supper in the
  circumstances is a matter of speculation, but none is ever left over for
  breakfast.</p>

  <p>More sadness, too, one might look for on the morning after a Bank Holiday,
  in the bilious and dissipated face, the boiled eye, of Jung Perchad, greatest
  of all the takers of the cake. But the bilious face, the boiled eye, is not
  there. No elephant has a liver. Anatomists may profess to have discovered a
  liver in a dead elephant, but that is only said to astonish the ignorant.
  Proof plain is there that no living elephant is so afflicted. Nobody with a
  liver may light-heartedly eat pencils and pocket-combs and purses and
  plum-cake as does an elephant.</p>

  <p>Suffa Culli has swallowed a purse with six guineas in it, gaining less
  discomfort by the transaction than the owner, who had to walk
  home.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag06-12.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"

  <p>The lamented Jumbo once purloined and swallowed a box of blister ointment
  from the pocket of a veterinary surgeon with perfect impunity; anybody who
  has lunched or blister ointment might well spend the few remaining minutes of
  his life in admiration for Jumbo's digestive works.</p><br>

  <p>So that the excesses of Bank Holiday never leave any seeds of subsequent
  discomfort with either Jung Perchad, Suffa Culli, Jingo, or Solomon.
  Staggering outside a mammoth load of everything, either may lean pantingly
  against a tree for a few minutes&mdash;you may see their favourite tree
  between the elephant and parrot houses, forced from the perpendicular and
  bare of bark&mdash;but to-morrow he will be equal to beginning again.</p>

  <p>In the bad weather, when few visitors come, the elephants are kept
  indoors. This is as well, upon the whole. If they were all let loose, with
  very few people about the grounds, awkward things might happen. In the
  summer, and especially on Bank Holidays, there are quite as many offers of
  refreshment as can easily be attended to, and the elephantine belief that the
  entire outside world is intended to be eaten does not get free play. An
  unfortunate country visitor meeting several elephants at once after a long
  estrangement from buns, might have disconcerting adventures. His pockets
  would certainly be rifled and his umbrella eaten, at once; also his hat. I am
  not quite certain that they wouldn't assume that he had offered them most of
  his clothes. I had some very good friends among the elephants of Mr. John
  Cooper, the famous tamer. Notably Blind Billy, who had all the value of his
  lost sight in his solid common sense.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag06-14.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>But I was speaking of clothes. Mr. Cooper's Betsy once ate a whole suit
  exclusive of the boots, but inclusive of certain pockets full of money and
  tobacco. The reason Betsy refrained from eating the boots was the simple one
  that they weren't there, which is why I should expect little mercy for the
  clothes of our friend from the country. The elephants would have them, and
  when they had gently relieved him of everything loose, they would curl their
  trunks up overhead and wait for further contributions. That is just like an
  elephant. He can't understand when you have got to the end of your
  resources.</p>

  <p>Iles is master of the elephants. Scott, whom Jumbo made famous, was his
  predecessor, and, long ago, Godfrey, the bearward, kept the elephants. Jung
  Perchad, Suffa Culli, Jingo, and Soloman all respect Iles, and trumpet when
  he tells them. Also, Suffa Culli will pick him up carefully with her trunk,
  and plant him on her neck; then&mdash;gentle soul!&mdash;she will pass him up
  the whip.</p><br>

  <div align="center">

        title="Illustration">

  <p>Have I, or have I not, detected on these occasions a certain twinkle of
  the eye, and a certain playful flourish of that whip? I believe I have.
  "Here, take it, my friend," Suffa Cull might be saying, "take it, and play
  with it as much as you like. It seems to please you, and it doesn't hurt me.
  But if I began on you with it&mdash;" and she chuckles quietly But she will
  obey the crack of that whip, and presently kneel down as gently as you please
  for Iles to alight. Moreover, on request, she will raise her voice (and her
  trunk) and trumpet most tremendously. I fear that the repetition of this sort
  of thing has made Suffa Culli unwarrantably vain of her voice.</p><img src=

  <p>Now, their winter shutting-in may preserve these elephants from colds, and
  may preserve private property from the elephants; but it deprives them of
  exercise. I must make a suggestion of some sort on behalf of these elephants
  when next I see Iles&mdash;some means of healthy recreation and "keeping in
  form;" something, in fact, in the way of a gymnasium. I do not go so far as
  to recommend the horizontal bar in Jung Perchad's case&mdash;it would come
  expensive in bars. But they all have tastes which would lead them to prefer a
  bar of some sort, even with nothing to drink on it.</p>

  <p>Even the swimming bath at the back, wherein is found much cool refreshment
  during summer, is largely out of the question in winter. Possible rheumatism
  and the chance of being frozen in makes that delectable pond useless till
  spring.</p>

  <p>An elephant has a great fondness for wallowing in water, although whether
  entirely from motives of cleanliness may be disputed, since on occasion he
  prefers a deposit of soft mud, a very proper and natural preference, I
  believe, for any creature in a state of imperfect civilization, as may be
  judged from the tastes of the human boy.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag06-20.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Mud, argues the human boy, is soft, mild, and soothing to the touch; also
  it is warm and comforting, equally in its liquid or semi-liquid state, and
  when forming a solid extra-cutaneous deposit. Wherefore the human boy,
  following his proper instincts, mudlarks. Is it this predilection for mud
  which leads all these four elephants persistently to ignore the foot-scrapers
  placed at the doors of the elephant-house for their accommodation? Look at
  them. They are obviously intended for the use of elephants, and for that of
  no lesser creature in this world. I have no doubt that at the absolute
  command of Iles these elephants would scrape their feet; for the elephant is
  a placable fellow, always anxious to please; but as it is they never do so,
  and all those many hundredweights of iron stand useless; for it never strikes
  a man entering the house to use an article of convenience so obviously
  intended for an elephant.</p><br>

  <p>But in the winter, though one may not meet him outside, one may hold quite
  an improving conversation with the elephant in his house. He is always ready
  for conversation, He waits all day for it behind a row of great bars and
  curling trunks. I do not know whether any nervous, short-sighted strangers
  ever at a first lengthwise glance take this elephant-house for the abode of
  serpents, all loose and looking for victims, but it might be
  excusable&mdash;especially if the house were made a great deal longer, and
  less well-lighted, and more elephants provided. But it is unlikely that this
  expense will be incurred for the purpose. Short-sighted people make enough
  mistakes about elephants already, in the manner of the American in blue
  spectacles who lately hailed Suffa Culli and her juvenile load under the
  impression that she was an omnibus carrying passengers to and from the
  Gardens; and in the manner of the historical gentleman of bad sight, who
  offered a biscuit to Jung Perchad's tail. By-the-bye, was this gentleman an
  historical personage or a mere figment of a funny man's imagination? I have
  heard of him, often&mdash;had heard of him before I knew Jung
  Perchad&mdash;but I cannot get Iles to admit having seen him.</p>

  <p>The arch under the Outer Circle stands for ever a memorial of the stature
  of the late lamented Jumbo. Jumbo could just get through that arch, and then
  by aid only of a certain shrinking within himself&mdash;a sort of gigantic
  shrugging of the shoulders. If the Society had thoughtlessly repaved under
  that arch with thicker stone, Jumbo would have been kept out all night. Now,
  this arch and the constant talk of Jumbo is a lifelong grief and tribulation
  unto Jung Perchad. Nothing would please Jung Perchad so much as to get a sore
  back against the top of that arch. But he can't. He is exactly three inches
  too short. He might get the sore back, of course, by rubbing against the
  side, but Jung Perchad is an honourable elephant, and a sportsman&mdash;never
  condescending to a mean trick; besides which, nobody would accept any sore as
  evidence of record height except one at the very top.</p><img src=

  <p>Those three inches make a gloomy creature of Jung Perchad&mdash;when there
  are no buns, and he has leisure to brood. The despicable atom of measurement
  is being continually hurled at his wrinkled head, and even Iles shows him no
  mercy, "Oh, dear," says the young lady visitor, "what a great elephant!" And
  Jung Perchad feels the sinful pride rise within him. Then the young lady
  says, "Is he as big as Jumbo was?" and Jung Perchad's heart is ready to
  break, for well he knows Iles's too truthful reply. <i>Three inches less</i>.
  Oh, that three inches! Where is the glory of being the biggest elephant in
  the Gardens of the Zoological Society of London only to be for ever reminded
  of an insignificant inferiority to a perfect stranger, who is dead?&mdash;and
  serve him right, probably. Jung Perchad grinds his teeth&mdash;lucky he
  hasn't tusks&mdash;no matta&mdash;r&mdash;r, a time will come! And he broods,
  and resolves to eat every earthly thing he meets, till he finds something
  that makes him grow; and matures mechanical plans for getting his back nearer
  the crown of that arch, until the last inquirer after those three inches has
  left, the gates are shut, and night falls; and his legs grow unsteady beneath
  him, and give way; and poor Jung Perchad and all his sorrows sink into a
  grey, grunting heap of slumber.</p>

  <p class="first">SUCH birds as, having wings, fly not, preferring to walk, to
  run, or to waddle, as legs and other circumstances may permit or
  compel&mdash;these are the cursores: such birds also as, having no wings, or
  none to speak of, run by compulsion on such legs as they may muster. These
  are many&mdash;so many that I almost repent me of the heading to this
  chapter, wherein I may speak only of the struthiones among the
  cursores&mdash;the curious cassowary, the quaint kiwi, the raucous rhea, the
  errant emeu, and the overtopping ostrich. But the heading is there&mdash;let
  it stand; for in the name of the cursores I see the raw material of many sad
  jokes&mdash;whereunto I pray I may never be tempted, but may leave them for
  an easy exercise for such as have set out upon the shameless career of the
  irreclaimable pun-flinger.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag07-02.gif"

  <p>It was some time&mdash;years&mdash;before I got rid of the impression left
  upon me by the first ostrich with which I became acquainted. He lived in an
  old picture-book, and would nowadays be considered quite out of fashion by
  up-to-date ostriches, having webbed feet and an improper number of toes. I
  like to believe that feet of this sort were popular among ostriches at that
  time, being loath to destroy early beliefs. From the same cause, I have other
  little private superstitions about the ostrich; there was no ostrich, so far
  as I can remember, in my Noah's ark, whence I derive my conviction that the
  species cannot have existed at the time of the Deluge, but has been evolved,
  in the succeeding centuries, by a gradual approach and assimilation of the
  several characteristics of the camel and the goose.</p>

  <p>The two ostriches here, at the Zoo, have no pet names bestowed on them by
  the keepers. This is inconvenient, not to say unfair. They have been placed,
  it will be observed, in the stables hitherto occupied by the late lamented
  giraffes. It is a striking and notable instance of care and the sense of
  fitness of things on the part of the Society. These stables, they probably
  reflected, have all along been fitted with tenants twenty feet
  high&mdash;queer tenants, which were often called camelopards. We can't
  replace these with similar tenants, unfortunately, but we will do our best
  with animals as high as possible and with all available neck; and they shall
  be camel-geese. And here they are; a few feet short, unavoidably, but as high
  as possible; quite the equivalent of the giraffes so far as concerns the
  camel, and as much superior as one may consider a goose to a leopard. And
  here you may stand and watch them, or sit. And you may watch, if you please,
  for the coming of the giraffes which the Society are now anxious to buy, or
  for the wandering wraiths of those dead, dispossessed, and indignant.
  Meantime inventing names for the two camel-geese&mdash;let us say Atkinson
  and Pontius Pilate.</p>

  <p>I like to stand by Atkinson till he dozes. Atkinson is a fine, big fellow,
  and when he squats down his head is in a convenient position for observation.
  Presently he gapes; then his eyes shut, and his beak droops&mdash;just a very
  little. Then the beak droops a little more, and signs of insecurity appear
  about the neck. Very soon a distinct departure from the vertical is visible
  in that neck; it melts down ruinously till almost past recovery, and then
  suddenly springs erect, carrying an open-eyed head, wherefrom darts a look of
  indignant repudiation of any disposition to fall asleep; and so keeps until
  the eyes close again. I have waited long, but have never seen Atkinson fall
  permanently asleep.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag07-05.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"

  <p>The possibilities of the ostrich are not properly recognised. He is
  domesticated, and bred with the utmost ignominy in a poultry run, and his
  tail is pulled out with impunity. I am not quite sure that he habitually
  figures on South African dinner tables with his legs skewered to his ribs,
  but he has fallen quite low enough for that; submitting even to the last
  indignity of being hatched out by a common stove incubator. Now, the elephant
  has also been domesticated, but he has also been allowed to adopt a
  profession. He dances on a tub and rides a tricycle at a circus. Nothing of
  this sort has been attempted with the ostrich, but much might be done. He
  would make a first-rate bicyclist, and could get through much of the business
  of the "eccentric comedian." A couple of them would go to make a capital
  knockabout act. High kicks of the very highest, floor-strides of the very
  longest&mdash;and there would be a world of opportunities in the neck. No end
  of possibilities lie in the neck&mdash;even the "legitimate." You could run
  in a forty-minute sketch, wherein two long-separated but faithful lovers
  should fall against each other and wind their necks about together like a
  caduceus, or barley-sugar&mdash;or anything. Also the camel-goose might fling
  his neck about the villain, and strangle him. But perhaps, after all, variety
  business would suit best. Pontius Pilate in a kilt and philibeg would bring
  down the house with a Highland fling or gillie callum. And Atkinson in a
  long-stride table chair and banjo act would be comforting to the
  perceptions.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag07-06.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">Whether the ostrich is actually such an ass as to hide his
  head with a notion of concealing himself I don't quite know, but there is
  certainly a deal of ass in the camel-goose. A Hottentot will put an ostrich
  skin over his head, and walking with his natural shanks exposed get among an
  ostrich family and kill them off one after another, to the family's
  astonishment. Now, a bird who mistakes a nigger with a mask for an intimate
  relation plainly enjoys in his composition a large flavour of the ass. Not
  knowing it, however, the camel-goose is just as happy, and neither
  experiences the bitterness of being sold nor the sweetness of selling. I
  don't believe that Atkinson was even aware of the triumphant sell which he
  lately assisted in administering to Mr. Toots, the cat from the
  camel-house.</p>

  <p>The cat in the ostrich-house is a sly fellow, and I believe he knows why
  there are fewer pigeons in the roof of the hippopotamus-house than there
  were. He horribly sold Mr. Toots, who was anxious to have a snack of poultry
  himself, for a change. "In my house," said this bold, bad cat, "there are the
  biggest pigeons you ever saw. Go in and try one, while I look out for the
  keeper." And the trustful Mr. Toots went in; and when, full of a resolve to
  make it hot for everything feathered in that house, Mr. Toots bounced into
  the presence of Atkinson, who is rather more than seven feet high, he came
  out anxious for the scalp of that other cat. I never mention this little
  adventure to Mr. Toots, who is sensitive, but all the other Zoo cats chaff
  him terribly. Even Jung Perchad and the other elephants snigger quietly as
  they pass, and Bob the Bactrian, from the camel-house, laughs outright; it is
  a horrid, coarse, vulgar, exasperating laugh, that of Bob's. Atkinson,
  however, is all unconscious of the joke, and remains equally affable to cats,
  pigeons, and human beings.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag07-07.gif"

  <p>Pontius Pilate is just the sort of camel-gander that <i>would</i> bury its
  head to hide itself. Pontius Pilate is, I fear, an ass; also a snob. He has a
  deal of curiosity with regard to Atkinson, who is a recent arrival, and
  lately belonged to the Queen. Also, he is often disposed to pay a
  visit&mdash;with his head&mdash;to Atkinson's quarters, and take a friendly
  snack&mdash;at Atkinson's expense; this by an insinuation of the neck out
  between his own bars and in between those of Atkinson, adjoining. But he
  doesn't understand the laws of space. Having once fetched his neck around the
  partition into Atkinson's larder by chancing to poke his head through the end
  bars, he straightway assumes that what is possible between some bars is
  possible between all; and wheresoever he may now be standing when prompted by
  companionable peckishness, straight he plunges among the nearest bars, being
  mightily astonished at his inability to reach next door, if by chance he have
  dropped among bars far from Atkinson's. He suspects his neck. Is the
  ungrateful tube playing him false? Maliciously shortening? Or are his eyes
  concerned in fraud? He loops his head back among his own adjoining bars, with
  a vague suspicion that they may be Atkinson's after all; and he stretches and
  struggles desperately. Some day Pontius Pilate will weave himself among those
  bars, basket fashion, only to be extricated by a civil engineer and a
  practical smith. Pontius Pilate is the sort of camel-gander that damages the
  intellectual reputation of the species. Of course he would bury his head to
  hide himself. Equally of course he would muzzle himself to prevent you from
  biting him, or tie his legs together to prevent you from running and catching
  him, or anything else equally clever. Pontius Pilate, I have known you
  long&mdash;even loved you, in a way. But I have observed you closely, and
  though, like Dogberry, you may have everything fine about you, I am impelled
  sorrowfully to write you down an ass.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag07-08.gif"

  <p>The ostrich is one of those birds whose whole command of facial expression
  is carried in the neck. He can only express himself through his features by
  offering you different views of his head. This is a great disadvantage. It
  limits the range. You may express three sentiments by the back, front, and
  side of the head, and something by way of combination in a three-quarter
  face. Then you stop, and have no further resource than standing on your head,
  one of the few things an ostrich is not clever at. But with such materials as
  he has, the ostrich does very well. Observe, his mouth is long, and droops at
  the corners; but the corners are wide apart, for there the head is
  broad.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag07-09.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Now you may present simple drama by the aid of this mouth&mdash;suitably
  disposed and ordered by the neck. Take Atkinson, here, whose beak has a
  certain tip-tinting distrusted of the teetotaler. Bend his head (only in
  theory, because Atkinson won't stand any practical nonsense)&mdash;bend his
  head to look downward, and let his neck wilt away sleepily. Now, viewed from
  the side, where is a more lamentable picture of maudlin intoxication? What
  could improve it, except, perhaps, a battered hat, worn lop-sided, and a
  cigar-stump? He is a drunken old camel-gander, coming home in the small
  hours, and having difficulties with his latch-key. Straighten Atkinson's
  neck, open wide his eyes, and take a three-quarter face view of him. Sober,
  sour, and indignant, there stands, not the inebriated Atkinson, but the
  disturbed Mrs. Atkinson on the stairs, with a candle, and a nightcap, and a
  lecture. That awful mouth actually conjures that candle, that nightcap, and
  that lecture into existence&mdash;you see and hear them more clearly than you
  do Atkinson, although they are not there. But this is an advanced exercise in
  struthian expression&mdash;a complicated feat, involving various and complex
  elements. There is the neck-wilt and the bending of the head; also the
  three-quarter face, not a simple element.</p>

  <p>The plain and elementary principles of struthian expression lie in the
  mere front and side views. The third simple view, the back, is not
  particularly eloquent, although practice might do something even for that. At
  the side the ostrich is glum, savage, misanthropical, depressed&mdash;what
  you will of that sort. Let him but turn and face you&mdash;he can't help a
  genial grin. All done by the versatile neck, you observe, which gives the
  head its position.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag07-10.gif"

        title="Illustration">

  <p>Man, instigated by woman, has a habit of pulling out the camel-gander's
  tail. This ruins the appearance of the site of that tail, without
  commensurately improving the head whereunto the tail is transplanted&mdash;an
  unprofitable game of heads and tails, wherein tails lose and heads don't win.
  Even the not over clever ostrich knows better than to wear those feathers on
  the wrong end. Perhaps he knows that he is enough of a fool already.</p>

  <p>There is a deal of hidden interest about the ostrich's neck. It is the
  cleverest piece of an ostrich&mdash;unless you count his stomach; and even in
  the triumphs of the stomach the neck takes a great share. When a camel-goose
  lunches off a box of dominoes, or a sack of nails, or a basketful of broken
  bottles, there is quite as much credit in the feat due to the neck as to the
  stomach; with anybody else all the difficulties of that lunch would begin
  with the neck&mdash;even a thicker neck. Parenthetically, one remembers that
  the ostrich's neck is not always thin. Catch Atkinson here in a roaring
  soliloquy, and you shall see his red neck distended as a bladder, with a
  mighty grumbling and grunting. This by the way. The neck makes nothing of the
  domino difficulty, or the tenpenny nail difficulty, or the door-knob
  difficulty, or the broken bottle difficulty&mdash;which are not difficulties
  to the camel-goose. On the contrary, the neck revels in them and keeps the
  dainties as long as possible. Give Pontius Pilate, or Atkinson&mdash;I am
  quite impartial&mdash;an apple. When he swallows it you shall see it, in a
  bulge, pass along and <i>round</i> his neck; down it goes and backward, in a
  gradual curve, until it disappears among the feathers&mdash;corkscrews, in
  fact. Observe, I recommend an apple for this demonstration. Dominoes and
  clinkers are all very well, but they rattle about inside, and disturb the
  visitors; and with an apple you will the more plainly observe that
  corkscrew.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag07-12.gif"

        title="Illustration">

  <p>Not satisfied, you perceive, with enjoying his domino or his door-knob all
  the way along that immense neck, the camel-gander must needs indulge in a
  spiral gullet. It is mere gluttony. Especially is it wicked of Atkinson, who
  has already the longest bird-neck in all these gardens. Look at the necks of
  all the cursores. The poor little wingless kiwi, with a mere nothing of a
  neck&mdash;for a cursore. <i>He</i> does without a spiral gullet. The festive
  cassowary&mdash;which, by-the-bye, <i>doesn't</i> abound&mdash;or
  exist&mdash;on the plains of Timbuctoo, as the rhyme says&mdash;the festive
  cassowary, I say, wears his gullet plain. The rusty rhea takes things below
  with perfect directness. The lordly emeu gets his dinner down as quickly as
  the length of his neck will permit. It is only when one reaches the top of
  the cursorean thermometer, all among the boilings, so to speak, that the
  ostrich, with the longest neck of all, must poach another few inches by going
  in for a spiral. Pontius Pilate is bad enough, but a spiral for
  Atkinson!&mdash;well, there!</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag07-14.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The partiality of the struthians for eccentric
  refreshments&mdash;clinkers, nut-crackers, and the like&mdash;leads many to a
  superstition that these things are as nourishing as they are attractive.
  They're not. Certain liberal asses have a curious habit of presenting the
  birds with halfpence. I scarcely understand why, unless modern environments
  have evolved penny-in-the-slotomaniacs. And I am prepared to bet that on
  occasions they are less generous with their pence. Nevertheless, they do it,
  and it kills the birds. One cassowary who died recently was found to contain
  one and eightpence in copper. I suggest that in future the experimentalizers
  confine their contributions to bank-notes. I have taken the trouble to
  ascertain that these will do no harm while their disappearance will afford an
  additional enjoyment to the contributors commensurate with their higher
  value.</p>

  <p>Perhaps there is something in the habits of the cassowary himself that
  explains these offerings. The cassowary always comes to meet you at the bars
  with a look of grave inquiry. If you offer no tribute he turns off, with many
  cockings of the beak, surprised, indignant, and contemptuous. Very few people
  can endure this. They hastily produce anything they have&mdash;anything to
  conciliate the contemptuous cassowary. And as he takes it, an expression
  steals across the cassowary's face which seems to admit that perhaps the
  fellow isn't such a shocking outsider after all. When a man has nothing more
  nutritive about him, this form of extortion may produce halfpence.</p>

  <p>The rhea is small potatoes beside the ostrich&mdash;merely a smaller and
  dingier camel-gander. But the emeu is a fine upstanding fellow, with his
  haughty sailing head and his great feather boa.</p>

  <p>He is a friendly and inquisitive chap, and will come stalking down to the
  wires to inspect you. If you like to walk up and down outside his inclosure
  he will take a turn with you, walking at your side and turning when you do.
  He is justly proud of his height and his ruff, but there is nothing
  objectionably haughty about the emeu; I have always found him ready for a
  quiet chat.</p>

  <p>He will eat various things, like the ostrich; so that one regards him with
  a certain respect, not to say awe, for there is no telling what wonderful
  things may or may not be inside him. The biggest and handsomest emeu here is
  my particular friend. When he talks to you or walks by your side he is very
  fine; but when he walks about a little way off, with his head to the ground,
  foraging, he looks rather like a tortoise on stilts, which is not imposing.
  Sometimes, when he thinks nobody is looking, he rushes madly up and down his
  territory by way of relieving his pent-up feelings, stopping very suddenly
  and looking cautiously about to assure himself that nobody saw him. I call
  this emeu Grimaldi; firstly, because Grimaldi is rather a fine name, and
  secondly, because when once you have had a view of his head from the back you
  can't call him anything else.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag07-16.gif"

  <p>The most extraordinary bird in the world is the kiwi. But it is not the
  most extraordinary bird seen by visitors to the Zoo, because they never see
  it. The kiwi buries itself asleep all day, and only comes out in the night to
  demolish an unpleasant and inconvenient proverb. The kiwi is the latest of
  all the birds, but catches the most worms. For this let us honour the kiwi,
  and hurl him in the face of the early risers. He stamps about the ground in
  the dark night, and the worm, being naturally a fool, as even the proverb
  demonstrates, comes up to investigate, and is at once cured of early rising
  for ever. The kiwi, having no wings (unless you count a bit of cartilage an
  inch or so long, buried under the down), has the appearance of running about
  with his hands in his pockets because of the cold. And being covered with
  something more like hair than feathers, is a deal more like a big rat than a
  bird of any sort.</p>

  <p>Indeed, I don't believe the kiwi himself has altogether made up his mind
  which to be. Before he decides he will probably become extinct. Any glimpse
  his friends have of him here is short. Suddenly brought out into the day, he
  stands for a moment, and blinks; then he puts his beak up and his legs apart,
  and there is a black streak and a heap of straw where it vanishes.</p>

  because to become extinct and to occupy a place of honour beside the dodo is
  a distinction much coveted amongst the lower animals. The dodo was a squabby,
  ugly, dumpy, not to say fat-headed, bird when it lived; now it is a hero of
  romance. Possibly this is what the seal is aiming at; but personally I should
  prefer the extinction of the punster.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag08-02.gif"

  <p>The punster is a low person, who refers to the awkwardness of the seal's
  gait by speaking of his not having his seal-legs, although a mariner or a
  sealubber, as he might express it. If you reply that, on the contrary, the
  seal's legs, such as they are, are very characteristic, he takes refuge in
  the atrocious admission, delivered with a French accent, that they are
  certainly very sealy legs. When he speaks of the messages of the English
  Government, in the matter of seal-catching in the Behring Sea, he calls it
  whitewashing the sealing, and explains that the "Behrings of this here
  observation lies in the application on it." I once even heard a punster
  remark that the Russian and American officials had got rather out of their
  Behrings, through an excess of seal on behalf of their Governments; but he
  was a very sad specimen, in a very advanced stage, and he is dead now. I
  don't say that that remark sealed his fate, but I believe there are people
  who would say even that, with half a chance.</p><img src=

  <p class="first">Another class of frivoller gets his opportunity because it
  is customary to give various species of seals&mdash;divers species, one might
  say&mdash;inappropriate names. He tells you that if you look for sea-lions
  and sea-leopards, you will not see lions, nor even see leopards, but
  seal-lions and seal-leopards, which are very different. These are called
  lions and leopards because they look less like lions and leopards than
  anything else in the world; just as the harp seal is so called because he has
  a broad mark on his back, which doesn't look like a harp. Look at Toby, the
  Patagonian sea-lion here, who has a large pond and premises to himself. I
  have the greatest possible respect and esteem for Toby, but I shouldn't
  mistake him for a lion, in any circumstances. With every wish to spare his
  feelings, one can only compare him to a very big slug in an overcoat, who has
  had the misfortune to fall into the water. Even his moustache isn't
  lion-like. Indeed, if he would only have a white cloth tucked round his neck,
  and sit back in that chair that stands over his pond, he would look very
  respectably human&mdash;and he certainly wants a shave.</p>

  <p>Toby is a low-comedy sea-lion all over. When I set about organizing the
  Zoo Nigger Minstrels, Toby shall be corner-man, and do the big-boot dance. He
  does it now, capitally. You have only to watch him from behind as he proceeds
  along the edge of the pond, to see the big-boot dance in all its quaint
  humour. Toby's hind flappers exhale broad farce at every step. Toby is a
  cheerful and laughter-moving seal, and he would do capitally in a pantomime,
  if he were a little less damp.</p>

  <p>Toby is fond of music; so are most other seals. The complete scale of the
  seal's preferences among the various musical instruments has not been fixed
  with anything like finality; but one thing is certain&mdash;that far and away
  above all the rest of the things designed to produce music and other noises,
  the seal prefers the bagpipes. This taste either proves the seal to be a
  better judge of music than most human beings, or a worse one than any of the
  other animals, according as the gentle reader may be a native of Scotland or
  of somewhere in the remainder of the world. You may charm seals by the
  bagpipes just as a snake is charmed by pipes with no bag. It has even been
  suggested that all the sealing vessels leaving this country should carry
  bagpipes with them, and I can see no sound objection to this course&mdash;so
  long as they take all the bagpipes. I could also reconcile myself to a
  general extrusion of concertinas for this useful purpose&mdash;or for any
  other; not to mention barrel organs.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag08-06.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>By-the-bye, on looking at Toby again I think we might do something better
  for him than give him a mere part in a pantomime; his fine moustache and his
  shiny hair almost point to a qualification for managership. Nothing more is
  wanted&mdash;except, perhaps, a fur-trimmed coat and a well-oiled
  hat&mdash;to make a very fine manager indeed, of a certain sort.</p>

  <p>I don't think there is a Noah's ark seal&mdash;unless the Lowther Arcade
  theology has been amended since I had a Noah's ark. As a matter of fact, I
  don't see what business a seal would have in the ark, where he would find no
  fish to eat, and would occupy space wanted by a more necessitous animal who
  couldn't swim. At any rate, there was originally no seal in my Noah's ark,
  which dissatisfied me, as I remember, at the time; what I wanted not being so
  much a Biblical illustration as a handy zoological collection. So I appointed
  the dove a seal, and he did very well indeed when I had pulled off his legs
  (a little inverted v). I argued, in the first place, that as the dove went
  out and found nothing to alight on, the legs were of no use to him; in the
  second place, that since, after all, the dove flew away and never returned,
  the show would be pretty well complete without him; and, thirdly, that if, on
  any emergency, a dove were imperatively required, he would do quite well
  without his legs&mdash;looking, indeed, much more like a dove, as well as
  much more like a seal. So, as the dove was of about the same size as the cow,
  he made an excellent seal; his bright yellow colour (Noah's was a yellow dove
  on the authority of all orthodox arks) rather lending an air of distinction
  than otherwise. And when a rashly funny uncle, who understood wine, observed
  that I was laying down my crusted old yellow seal because it wouldn't stand
  up, I didn't altogether understand him.</p>

  <p>Toby is a good soul, and you soon make his acquaintance. He never makes
  himself common, however. As he swims round his circular pond, behind the high
  rails, he won't have anything to say to a stranger&mdash;anybody he has not
  seen before. But if you wait a few minutes he will swim round several times,
  see you often, and become quite affable. There is nothing more intelligent
  than a tame seal, and I have heard people regret that seals can't talk, which
  is nonsense. When a seal can make you understand him without it, talking is a
  noisy superfluity. Toby can say many things without the necessity of talking.
  Observe his eyes fixed upon you as he approaches for the first time. He turns
  and swaps past with his nose in the air. "Pooh, don't know you," he is
  saying. But wait. He swims round once, and, the next time of passing, gives
  you a little more notice. He lifts his head and gazes at you, inquisitively,
  but severely. "Who's that person?" he asks, and goes on his
  round.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag08-08.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Next time he rises even a little more. He even smiles, slightly, as he
  recognises you from the corner of his eye. "Ah! Seen you before, I fancy."
  And as he flings over into the side stroke he beams at you quite
  tolerantly.</p>

  <p>He comes round again; but this time he smiles genially, and nods.
  "'Morning!" he says, in a manner of a moderately old acquaintance. But see
  next time; he is an old, intimate friend by this; a chum. He flings his
  fin-flappers upon the coping, leans toward the bars with an expansive grin
  and says: "Well, old boy, and how are you?"&mdash;as cordially and as loudly
  as possible without absolutely speaking the words. He will stay thus for a
  few moments' conversation, not entirely uninfluenced, I fear, by
  anticipations of fish. Then, in the case of your not being in the habit of
  carrying raw fish in your pockets, he takes his leave by the short process of
  falling headlong into his pond and flinging a good deal of it over you. There
  is no difficulty in becoming acquainted with Toby. If you will only wait a
  few minutes he will slop his pond over you with all the genial urbanity of an
  intimate relation. But you must wait for the proper forms of
  etiquette.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag08-09.gif"

  <p class="first">The seal's sloppiness is annoying. I would have a tame seal
  myself if he could go about without setting things afloat. A wet seal is
  unpleasant to pat and fondle, and if he climbs on your knees he is positively
  irritating. I suppose even a seal would get dry if you kept him out of water
  long enough; but <i>can</i> you keep a seal out of water while there is any
  within five miles for him to get into? And would the seal respect you for it
  if you did? A dog shakes himself dry after a swim, and, if he be your own
  dog, he shakes the water over somebody else, which is sagacious and
  convenient; but a seal doesn't shake himself, and can't understand that wet
  will lower the value of any animal's caresses. Otherwise a seal would often
  be preferable to a dog as a domestic pet. He doesn't howl all night. He never
  attempts to chase cats&mdash;seeing the hopelessness of the thing. You don't
  need a license for him; and there is little temptation to a loafer to steal
  him, owing to the restricted market for house-seals. I have frequently heard
  of a dog being engaged to field in a single-wicket cricket match. I should
  like to play somebody a single-wicket cricket match, with a dog and a seal to
  field for me. The seal, having no legs to speak of&mdash;merely
  feet&mdash;would have to leave the running to the dog, but it <i>could</i>
  catch. You may see magnificent catching here when Toby and Fanny&mdash;the
  Cape sea-lion (or lioness), over by the turkeys&mdash;have their snacks of
  fish. Sutton the Second, who is Keeper of the Seals (which is a fine
  title&mdash;rather like a Cabinet Minister), is then the source of a sort of
  pyrotechnic shower of fish, every one of which is caught and swallowed
  promptly and neatly, no matter how or where it may fall.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag08-11.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>Fanny, by the way, is the most active seal possible; it is only on
  extremely rare occasions that she indulges in an interval of comparative
  rest, to scratch her head with her hind foot and devise fresh gymnastics.
  But, all through the day, Fanny never forgets Sutton, nor his shower of fish,
  and half her evolutions include a glance at the door whence he is wont to
  emerge, and a sort of suicidal fling back into the pond in case of his
  non-appearance, all which proceedings the solemn turkeys regard with
  increasing amazement.</p>

  <p>Toby, however, provides the great seal-feeding show. Toby has a perfect
  set of properties and appliances for his performance, including a chair, a
  diving platform, an inclined plane leading thereunto, and a sort of plank
  isthmus leading to the chair. He climbs up on to the chair, and, leaning over
  the back, catches as many fish as Sutton will throw for him. He dives off the
  chair for other fish. He shuffles up the inclined plane for more fish, amid
  the sniggers of spectators, for Toby's march has no claim to magnificence. He
  tumbles himself unceremoniously off the platform, he clambers up and kisses
  Sutton (keeping his eye on the basket), and all for fish. It is curious to
  contrast the perfunctory affection with which Toby gets over the kiss and
  takes his reward, with the genuine fondness of his gaze after Sutton when he
  leaves&mdash;with some fish remaining for other seals. Toby is a willing
  worker; he would gladly have the performance twice as long, while as to an
  eight hours' day&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

  <p>The seals in the next pond, Tommy and Jenny, are insulted with the epithet
  of "common" seals; but Tommy and Jenny are really very respectable, and if a
  seal do happen to be born only <i>Phoca vitulina</i>, he can't really help
  it, and doesn't deserve humiliation so long as he behaves himself. <i>Phoca
  vitulina</i> has as excellent power of reason as any other kind of
  seal&mdash;brain power, acquired, no doubt, from a continual fish diet. Tommy
  doesn't feel aggrieved at the slight put upon him, however, and has a proper
  notion of his own importance. Watch him rise from a mere floating
  patch&mdash;slowly, solemnly, and portentously, to take a look round. He
  looks to the left&mdash;nothing to interest a well-informed seal; to the
  front&mdash;nothing; to the right everything is in order, the weather is only
  so-so, but the rain keeps off, and there are no signs of that dilatory person
  with the fish; so Tommy flops in again, and becomes once more a floating
  patch, having conducted his little airing with proper dignity and
  self-respect. Really, there is nothing common in the manners of Tommy; there
  is, at any rate, one piece of rude mischief which he is never guilty of, but
  which many of the more aristocratic kinds of seal practise habitually. He
  doesn't throw stones.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag08-13.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">He doesn't look at all like a stone-thrower, as a matter of
  fact; but he&mdash;and other seals&mdash;<i>can</i> throw stones
  nevertheless. If you chase a seal over a shingly beach, he will scuffle away
  at a surprising pace, flinging up the stones into your face with his hind
  feet. This assault, directed toward a well-intentioned person who only wants
  to bang him on the head with a club, is a piece of grievous ill-humour,
  particularly on the part of the crested seal, who can blow up a sort of
  bladder on the top of his head which protects him from assault; and which
  also gives him, by-the-bye, an intellectual and large-brained appearance not
  his due, for all his fish diet. I had been thinking of making some sort of a
  joke about an aristocratic seal with a crest on it&mdash;beside a fine coat
  with no arms&mdash;but gave up the undertaking on reflecting that no real
  swell&mdash;probably not even a parvenu&mdash;would heave half-bricks with
  his feet.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag08-14.gif"

        title="Illustration">

  <p>All this running away and hurling of clinkers may seem to agree ill with
  the longing after extermination lately hinted at; but, in fact, it only
  proves the presence of a large amount of human nature in the composition of
  the seal. From motives of racial pride the seal aspires to extinction and a
  place beside the dodo, but in the spirit of many other patriots, he wants the
  other seals to be exterminated first; wants the individual honour, in fact,
  of being himself the very last seal, as well as the corporate honour of
  extinction for the species. This is why, if he live in some other part, he
  takes such delighted interest in news of wholesale seal slaughter in the
  Pacific; and also why he skedaddles from the well-meant bangs of the genial
  hunter&mdash;these blows, by the way, being technically described as
  sealing-whacks.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag08-15.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The sea-lion, as I have said, is not like a lion; the sea-leopard is not
  like a leopard; but the sea-elephant, which is another sort of seal, and a
  large one, may possibly be considered sufficiently like an elephant to have
  been evolved, in the centuries, from an elephant who has had the ill-luck to
  fall into the sea. He hasn't much of a trunk left, but he often finds himself
  in seas of a coldness enough to nip off any ordinary trunk; but his legs and
  feet are not elephantine.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag08-16.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>What the previous ad­ventures of the sea-lion may have been in the matter
  of evolution, I am at a loss to guess, unless there is anything in the slug
  theory; but if he keep steadily on, and cultivate his moustache and his
  stomach with proper assiduity, I have no doubt of his one day turning up at a
  seaside resort and carrying on life in future as a fierce old German out for
  a bathe. Or the Cape sea-lion, if only he continue his obsequious smile and
  his habit of planting his fore-flappers on the ledge before him as he rises
  from the water, may some day, in his posterity, be promoted to a place behind
  the counter of a respectable drapery warehouse, there to sell the skins his
  relatives grow.</p>

  <p>But after all, any phocine ambition, either for extinction or higher
  evolution, may be an empty thing; because the seal is very comfortable as he
  is. Consider a few of his advantages. He has a very fine fur overcoat, with
  an admirable lining of fat, which, as well as being warm, permits any amount
  of harmless falling and tumbling about, such as is suitable to and inevitable
  with the seal's want of shape. He can enjoy the sound of bagpipes, which is a
  privilege accorded to few. Further, he can shut his ears when he has had
  enough, which is a faculty man may envy him. His wife, too, always has a
  first-rate sealskin jacket, made in one piece, and he hasn't to pay for it.
  He can always run down to the seaside when so disposed, although the run is a
  waddle and a flounder; and if he has no tail to speak of&mdash;well, he can't
  have it frozen off. All these things are better than the empty honour of
  extinction; better than evolution into bathers who would be drownable, and
  translation into unaccustomed situations&mdash;with the peril of a week's
  notice. Wherefore let the seal perpetuate his race&mdash;his obstacle race,
  as one might say, seeing him flounder and flop.</p>

  and a particular enthusiasm for natural history, will refer to any one of the
  great standard works on birds, and, turning to the index, seek for the family
  title of the Conkaves, I have every hope and confidence that he will not find
  it; because, as a matter of fact, it is a little invention of my own, and, I
  may modestly urge, rather a neat thing in scientific nomenclature, on the
  whole. It has the advantage of including in one family the storks and the
  pelicans, which in all orthodox books on birds are planted far apart and out
  of sight of each other, with many orders, tribes, and families between. Under
  my title they are gathered amicably together in the common possession of very
  long bills, like two tailors on a man's doorstep. The word is derived, in the
  proper and regular manner, from ancient sources; from <i>conk</i>, a
  venerable Eastern word, signifying a nose or beak, and the Latin <i>avis</i>,
  a bird. And I offer the term freely as my humble, but I trust useful,
  contribution to science; my first contribution.</p><img src=

  <p>The stork is regarded, in many countries, with a certain
  semi-superstitious reverence and esteem. After many prolonged and serious
  attempts to saturate myself with a similar feeling, I regret to confess to a
  certain smallness of esteem for the stork. You can't esteem a bird that makes
  ugly digs at your feet and heels with such a very big beak. Out in their
  summer quarters the storks are kept in by close wire, and close wire will
  give an air of inoffensiveness to most things. But, away in a by-yard, with a
  gate marked "private," there stands a shed wherein the storks are kept warm
  in winter, behind wooden bars; and between these bars stork-heads have a way
  of dropping at the toes of the favoured passer-by, like to action of a row of
  roadmen's picks.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag09-03.gif"

  <p>The stork has come off well in the matter of bodily endowment. The pelican
  has a tremendous beak&mdash;achieved, it would seem, by a skimping of
  material in the legs; but the stork has the tremendous beak and legs of
  surprising growth as well. His wings, too, are something more than
  respectable. At flying, at eating, at portentous solemnity of
  demeanour&mdash;in all these and in other things the pelican and the stork
  score fairly evenly; but at walking the pelican is left behind at once. This
  makes one suspect the stork's honesty. The pelican has a good beak and wings,
  and pays for them, like an honest bird, out of its legs, just as the ostrich
  pays for its neck and legs out of its wings. But the stork is abnormally
  lucky in beak, neck, legs, and wings together, and even then has material
  left to lay out in superfluous knobs and wens to hang round its neck, which
  leads to a suspicion that many of its personal fittings belong properly to
  some other bird. I've a notion that the unlucky kiwi might identify some of
  the property.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the adjutant should be acknowledged king of the conkavians. Billy,
  the Zoo adjutant, has, I believe, no doubt on the subject at all. Billy is an
  ornament to the military profession&mdash;a very fine fellow, with a thing on
  the back of his neck like a Tangerine orange, and a wen on the front of it,
  which he can blow out whenever he wants to amuse himself, and everything else
  handsome about him. He is an old soldier, too, is Billy, having been Adjutant
  of the Regent's Park Conkavian Corps for seventeen years; but if you knew
  nothing of his age, still you would call Billy an old soldier&mdash;upon a
  little acquaintance with his habits.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag09-05.gif"

  <p class="first">There seems no valid reason why the professional
  aspi­rations of the stork should be restricted to the army. If an adjutant,
  why not a dean? Why not a proctor? There is the making of a most presentable
  don about a stork; and I have caught a stork in an attitude of judicial
  meditation that might do honour to any bench. There is no reason why "sober
  as a judge" should not be made to read "sober as a stork," except that the
  stork is the more solemn creature of the two; and I think that some species
  of stork&mdash;say the marabou, for instance&mdash;might fairly claim brevet
  rank as judge, after the example of the adjutant. The elevation of a beak to
  the bench might be considered an irregular piece of legal procedure; but,
  bless you, it's nothing unusual with a stork. Put any bench with something to
  eat on it anywhere within reach of a stork's beak in this place, and you
  shall witness that same elevation, precedent or no precedent.</p><img src=

  <p>A common white stork hasn't half the solid gravity of an adjutant or a
  marabou. He has a feline habit of expressing his displeasure by blowing and
  swearing&mdash;a habit bad and immoral in a cat, but worse in a stork
  accustomed to Church. Church, by-the-bye, is the keeper of all the
  conkavians, as well as of the herons, the flamingoes, the ibises, the egrets,
  and a number of other birds with names more difficult to spell. It is
  impossible to treat disrespectfully a man with such widespread
  responsibilities as this, or there might be a temptation to mention that he
  is not an unusually high Church, although his services are not always simple,
  often involving a matter of doctorin'. But, then, some people will say
  anything, temptation or none. And after all, it is pleasant to know that,
  whatever a stork or a pelican wants, he always goes to Church.</p><br>

  <p class="first">This being the case, there is a proverb about cleanliness
  that makes one wonder why the marabou stork doesn't wash himself. It isn't as
  though he never wanted it. I have a horrible suspicion about this philosophic
  old sloven. I believe his profession of philosophic contemplation is assumed,
  because it is the easiest excuse for indolence. Now, a pelican is not a bird
  of graceful outline, but he <i>is</i> careful about his feathers. The pelican
  is a scrupulous old Dutchman, and the stork is an uncleanly old Hindu. And
  uncleanly he must be left, for it takes a deal to shame a stork. You can't
  shame a bird that wraps itself in a convenient philosophy.</p>

  <p>"Look here&mdash;look at me!" you can imagine a pelican
  cleanliness-missionary saying to the stork. "See how white and clean I keep
  all my feathers!" "Um," says the stork, "it only makes 'em a different
  colour." "But observe! I just comb through my pinions with my beak, so, and
  they all lie neat and straight!" "Well, and what's the good of that?" grunts
  the stork. "And then you see," says the pelican, ignoring the question, "with
  a good long beak you can reach everywhere, over your back and under your
  wings; see, I'm as clean under my wings as anywhere else, although it's
  covered up!" "Beastly vanity," growls the old Hindu, getting bored. "Then,"
  continues the Dutchman, "you give yourself a good shake, and there you are!"
  "And then," says the philosopher sarcastically, "to-morrow, I suppose, you'll
  have to do it all over again?" "Of course!" "Oh! I hate a fool!" says the
  stork, and closes the lecture.</p>

  <p>Thus the marabou. The ordinary white stork is comparatively respectable,
  and so is the adjutant&mdash;or comparatively almost respectable, let us say;
  you can't be too cautious in giving a personal character to a
  stork.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag09-10.gif"

  <p>For long, long, the stork has enjoyed a reputation for solemn wisdom, for
  philosophical dignity. Now for the first time I venture to question this
  reputation&mdash;to impeach the stork as a humbug. It is easy to achieve a
  reputation for profound and ponderous wisdom, so long as one looks very
  solemn and says nothing. This is the stork's recipe. Go up to Billy here, or
  one of the marabous, as he stands with his shoulders humped up about his
  head, and make a joke. He won't see it. He will lift his eyebrows with a
  certain look of contempt, and continue to cogitate&mdash;about nothing. If
  the joke is a very bad pun&mdash;such a frightful pun that even a stork will
  see and resent it&mdash;perhaps he will chatter his beak savagely, with a
  noise like the clatter of the lid on an empty cigar-box; but he will continue
  his sham meditations. "Ah, my friend," he seems to say, "you are empty and
  frivolous&mdash;I cogitate the profounder immensities of esoteric
  cogibundity." The fact being that he is very seedy after his previous night's
  dissipation.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag09-11.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">That is the chief secret of the stork's solemnity, I am
  con­vinced. He has a certain repu­tation to maintain before visitors, but
  after hours, when the gates are shut and the keepers are not there to see,
  the marabou stork is a sad dog. I haven't quite made up my mind what he
  drinks, but if he has brandies and sodas he leaves out too much soda. Look at
  that awful nose! It is long past the crimson and pimply stage&mdash;it is
  taking a decided tinge of blue. It <i>looks</i> worse than brandy and
  soda&mdash;almost like bad gin&mdash;but we will be as charitable as
  possible, and only call it brandy and soda.</p>

  <p>I should like to see the marabou stork on his nightly ran-tan, if only to
  gloat over his lapse of dignity, just as one would give much to see Benjamin
  Franklin with his face blacked, drunk and disorderly and being locked up.
  But, as a shocking example, the marabou is quite bad enough with his awful
  head in the morning; his awful head and his disreputable nose, that looks to
  want a good scraping. I respect Billy, the adjutant, for his long service and
  the Tangerine at the back of his neck. The ordinary stork (although he swears
  and snaps) I also respect, because the goody books used to tell pious lies
  about him. The whale-headed stork, which is also called the shoe-bird, I
  respect as a sort of relative of the shoo-fly that didn't bother somebody.
  But the marabou has forfeited all respect&mdash;converted it into nose-tint.
  I must talk to Church seriously about the marabou.</p>

  <p>Now, the pelican is no humbug. There is nothing like concealment about his
  little dissipations; and he is perfectly sober. Any little irregularity at
  the pelican club just opposite the eastern aviary never goes beyond a quiet
  round or two for a little fish dinner. It is quite a select and a most proper
  club. Indeed, the first rule is, that if any loose fish be found on the club
  premises, he is got rid of at once by the first member who detects him. And
  the club spirit is such that disputes frequently occur among members for the
  honour of carrying out this salutary rule. The chairman of the club is an old
  crested pelican, who, by some oversight, has never been provided with a
  private name of his own. I think he should be called Peter, because he can
  take such a miraculous draught of fishes. It <i>is</i> a draught; you
  know&mdash;a pelican doesn't eat fishes&mdash;he drinks them down in bulk.
  For Peter, a dozen or so fresh herrings is a mere swill round of the
  mouth.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag09-13.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Peter walks about the club premises with much dignity, deferred to on all
  sides by the other members. His kingship is rarely disputed, having been
  achieved by the sort of conquest most familiar in the pelican club; and his
  divine right is as much respected as his tremendous left.</p>

  <p>A pelican never bears malice; he hasn't time, especially now, with
  competition so keen in the fish business, and Church's fish pails only of the
  ordinary size. There is never any ill-feeling after a little spar, and each
  proceeds, in the most amicable way, to steal some other pelican's fish. A
  spar at this club, by-the-bye, is a joyous and hilarious sight. Two big birds
  with stumpy legs and top-heavy beaks, solemnly prancing and manoeuvring
  before one another with an accompaniment of valiant gobbles and a punctuation
  of occasional pecks&mdash;a gleesome spectacle.</p><img src=

  <p>Another sport much exhibited at the pelican club is that of the
  broadsword. The school of fence is that of Mr. Vincent
  Crummies&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;over;
  one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;under. You see, when a dozen or
  two birds with beaks a couple of feet long or so get together in a small
  area, and now and again rush all in the same direction for fish, fencing is
  certain to develop, sooner or later. So here you have it, <i>secundum
  artem</i>&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;over;
  one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;under; and although none have yet
  attained the Crummleian degree of knocking out sparks, there is a deal of
  hollow noise, as of thumping on a wooden box.</p>

  <p>But there is never any after-malice, and in less than five minutes either
  combatant will swallow a fish rightfully belonging to the other, with perfect
  affability.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag09-16.gif"

  <p>There is a good deal of the philosopher about the pelican, and of a more
  genuine sort than characterizes the stork. The pelican always makes the best
  of a bad job, without going into an unnecessary tantrum over it. If another
  member of the club snatches a fish first, the pelican doesn't bother, but
  devotes his attention to the next that Church throws; a fish in the pouch is
  worth a shoal in somebody else's. Now and again Peter loses his temper for a
  moment if the others catch the first snack, and lays about him with his
  bill&mdash;but then, when a fellow's chairman, and a lot of other fellows
  come snatching the lunch from under his nose&mdash;why, hang it all, you
  know...But it is only for a moment, and Peter is soon in position for the
  next pouchful. He is artful about this position. When Church appears at the
  rails with a pailful of fish most of the members rush to those rails, jostle
  together and shove their beaks through them and over them&mdash;any way to
  get nearer the pail. But the chairman knows very well that Church doesn't
  throw the fish outside the rails, but into the inclosure, somewhere near the
  middle; and near the middle the sagacious Peter waits, to his early
  profit&mdash;unless Church is unusually slow about throwing the fish, in
  which case Peter is apt to let his excitement steal his sagacity, and to rush
  into the pell-mell, anxious to investigate the delay.</p><img src=

  <p>There is a deal of excellent wear in a pelican. One has been here about
  thirty years, and two more have been established on the same premises for a
  quarter of a century. All these three are in capital working repair and will
  probably last, with a patch or two, and a little soleing and heeling, for a
  century or two more; no respectable pelican is ever bowled out for less than
  three figures.</p>

  <p>In the winter the club takes up its quarters in the shed behind the
  inclosure; a shed sumptuously furnished with certain benches and forms,
  whereon the club stands in rows, with a general appearance of a number of
  very solemn naughty boys in a Board school. In winter, too, Church will often
  put his bucketful of fish on the ground, so that the club may dine in a
  clubbier way. But whether you watch this club feeding together from the pail,
  each member doing his best to put away the whole pailful at a gulp, or
  whether you observe them playing a sort of greedy game of lacrosse with fish
  which Church throws them, you will be equally amazed that the pelican was
  used as a symbol of charity and brotherly love in early and middle Christian
  art.</p>

  <p>I have seen a pelican enact a most instructive moral lesson at a
  pail-dinner. Observe the bill and pouch of a pelican. The pouch is an elastic
  fishing-net, and the lower mandible is a mere flexible frame to carry it.
  Now, I have observed a pelican to make a bounce at the fish-pail, with
  outspread wings, and scoop the whole supply. But then his trouble began. The
  whole catch hung weightily low in the end of the pouch, and jerk and heave as
  he might, he could never lift the load at the end of that long beak
  sufficiently high to bolt it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, his friends collected about him and remonstrated, with many
  flops and gobbles, betting him all his fish to nothing that he would lose it
  after all; this way they chased that bag, and that way, while the bagger, in
  much trepidation and with many desperate heaves, wildly sought remote corners
  away from his persecutors.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag09-22.gif"

  <p>Now, by the corner of the club premises stands an appliance, the emblem of
  authority, the instrument of justice, and the terror of the evilly-disposed
  pelican&mdash;a birch-broom. This, brandished in the hands of Church, caused
  a sudden and awful collapse of the drag-nets, an opening, a shower of fish
  and many snaps; wherefrom walked away many pelicans with fish, and one with
  none, who had looked to take all. The moral is plain to the verge of
  ugliness.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag09-23.gif"

  <p>A pelican has no tongue&mdash;or none to speak of. It is a mere little
  knob scarcely the size of a cherry. The long, long meditations of the pelican
  (lasting between feeding times) are given up to consideration whether or not
  the disgrace of this deficiency is counter-balanced by the greater capacity
  for fish which it gives the pouch. After all, it is only another instance of
  that commercial honesty which makes the pelican pay for his beak out of his
  legs; he gives his tongue for a pouch. There should be a legend of the
  pelican applying honestly to Adam to buy a pouch, and the wily stork waiting
  and waiting on the chance of snatching one without paying for it, until all
  had been served out; afterwards living all its life on earth in covetous
  dudgeon, unconsoled by its wealth of beak, legs, wings, and neck, and pining
  hopelessly for the lost pouch. There are many legends of this sort which
  ought to exist, but don't, owing to the negligence of Indian solar myth
  merchants, or whoever it is has charge of that class of
  misrepresentation.</p>

  <p>The pelican can fly, although you would never believe it, to look at the
  club members here. To a Zoo pelican a flight of two feet is an undertaking to
  be approached with much circumspection and preparation, and a summoning of
  resolution and screwing of courage proper to the magnitude of the feat. It
  takes a long time to learn to fly on to a bottom-up bucket. The Zoo pelican
  begins on a shadow&mdash;not a very dark one at first&mdash;and works his way
  up by jumping over, darker shadows to straws and pebbles, before he tries a
  bucket. The accomplished bucket-jumper makes a long preliminary survey and
  circumnavigation of his bucket before performing, and when he does begin it
  is with a number of wild rushes and irresolute stops. When at last he gets
  the proper length of run, and the right foot in front, and doesn't see
  anything to baulk him, he rises with a great effort, and all the lookers-on
  who don't know him stare up over the trees, and are astonished to find him,
  after all, only on the bucket. His pinions are cut, poor fellow! If they were
  not, what would become of the fishmongers' shops?</p>

  <p class="first">THERE is a certain coolness, almost to be called a positive
  want of cordiality, between snakes and human beings. More, the snake is never
  a social favourite among the animals called lower. Nobody makes an intimate
  friend of a snake. Popular natural history books are filled and running over
  with anecdotes of varying elegance and mendacity, setting forth extraordinary
  cases of affection and co-operation between a cat and a mouse, a horse and a
  hen, a pig and a cockroach, a camel and a lobster, a cow and a wheelbarrow,
  and so on; but there is never a snake in one of these quaint alliances.
  Snakes do not do that sort of thing, and the anecdote-designer's imagination
  has not yet risen to the feat of compelling them, although the stimulus of
  competition may soon cause it.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag10-02.gif"

  <p class="first">The case most nearly ap­proaching one of friendship between
  man and snake known to me is the case of Tyrrell, the Zoo snake keep­er, and
  his "laidly worms." But, then, the friendship is mostly on Tyrrell's side,
  and, moreover, Tyrrell is rather more than human, as anyone will admit who
  sees him hang boa constrictors round his neck. Of course one often hears of
  boys making pets of common English snakes, but a boy is not a human creature
  at all; he is a kind of harpy.</p>

  <p class="first">The prairie marmot and the burrowing owl come into
  neighbourly contact with the rattlesnake, but the ac­quaintance does not
  quite amount to friendship. The prairie marmot takes a lot of trouble and
  builds a nice burrow, and then the owl, who is only a slovenly sort of
  architect himself, comes along and takes apartments. It has never been quite
  settled whether or not the lodger and the landlord agree pleasantly together,
  but in the absence of any positive evidence they may be given credit for
  perfect amiability; because nobody has found traces of owl in a dead marmot's
  interior, nor of marmot in an owl's. But the rattlesnake is another thing. He
  waits till the residence has been made perfectly comfortable, and then comes
  in himself; not in the friendly capacity of a lodger, but as a sort of unholy
  writter&mdash;a scaly man-in-possession. He eats the marmot's family and
  perhaps the marmot himself: curling himself up comfortably in the best part
  of the drawing-room. The owl and his belongings he leaves severely alone; but
  whether from a doubt as to the legality of distraining upon the goods of a
  lodger, or from a certainty as to the lodger's goods including claws and a
  beak, naturalists do not say.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag10-05.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Personally, I incline very much to the claw-and-beak theory, having seen
  an owl kill a snake in a very neat and workmanlike manner; and, indeed, the
  rattlesnake sometimes catches a Tartar even in the marmot. It isn't terror of
  the snake that makes him unpopular; the most harmless snake never acquires
  the confidence of other creatures; and one hesitates to carry it in his hat.
  This general repugnance is something like backing a bill or paying a
  tailor&mdash;entirely a matter of form. Nothing else has sympathy with the
  serpent's shape.</p>

  <p>When any other animal barters away his legs he buys either fins or wings
  with them; this is a generally-understood law, invariably respected. But the
  snake goes in for extravagance in ribs and vertebræ; an eccentric, rakish,
  and improper proceeding; part of an irregular and raffish life. Nothing can
  carry within it affection, or even respect, for an animal whose tail begins
  nowhere in particular, unless it is at the neck; even if any creature may
  esteem it an animal at all that is but a tail with a mouth and eyes at one
  end. Dignify the mouth and eyes into a head, and still you have nothing
  wherewith to refute those who shall call the snake tribe naught but heads and
  tails; a vulgar and raffish condition of life, of pot-house and Tommy-Dod
  suggestion.</p>

  <p>And this is why nothing loves a snake. It is not because the snake is
  feared, but because it is incomprehensible. The talk of its upas-like
  influence, its deadly fascination, is chiefly picturesque humbug. Ducks will
  approach a snake curiously, inwardly debating the possibility of digesting so
  big a worm at one meal; the moving tail-tip they will peck at cheerfully.
  This was the sort of thing that one might have observed for himself years
  ago, here at the Zoo; at the time when the snakes lived in the old house in
  blankets, because of the unsteadiness of the thermometer, and were fed in
  public. Now the snakes are fed in strict privacy lest the sight overset the
  morals of visitors; the killing of a bird, a rabbit, or a rat by a snake
  being almost a quarter as unpleasant to look upon as the killing of the same
  animal by a man in a farmyard or elsewhere. The abject terror inspired by the
  presence of a snake is such that an innocent rat will set to gnawing the
  snake's tail in default of more usual provender; while a rabbit placed with a
  snake near skin-shedding time will placidly nibble the loose rags of
  epidermis about the snake's sides.</p>

  <p>The pig treats the snake with disrespect, not to say insolence; nothing,
  ophidian or otherwise, can fascinate a pig. If your back garden is infested
  with rattlesnakes you should keep pigs.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag10-09.gif"

  <p class="first">The pig dances contemptuously on the rattlesnake, and eats
  him with much relish, rattles and all. The last emotion of the rattlesnake is
  intense astonishment; and astonishment is natural, in the circumstances. A
  respectable and experienced rattlesnake, many years established in business,
  has been accustomed to spread panic everywhere within ear and eye shot;
  everything capable of motion has started off at the faintest rustle of his
  rattles, and his view of animal life from those expressionless eyes has
  invariably been a back view, and a rapidly diminishing one. After a life-long
  experience of this sort, to be unceremoniously rushed upon by a common pig,
  to be jumped upon, to be flouted and snouted, to be treated as so much swill,
  and finally to be made a snack of&mdash;this causes a feeling of very natural
  and painful surprise in the rattlesnake. But a rattlesnake is only surprised
  in this way once, and he is said to improve the pork.</p>

  <p>As a <i>tour de force</i> in the gentle art of lying, the snake-story is
  justly esteemed. All the records in this particular branch of sport are held
  in the United States of America, where proficiency at snakes is the first
  qualification of a descriptive reporter. The old story of the two snakes
  swallowing each other from the tail till both disappeared; the story of the
  snake that took its own tail in its mouth and trundled after its victim like
  a hoop; the story of the man who chopped a snake in half just as it was
  bolting a rat, so that the rat merely toddled through the foremost half and
  escaped&mdash;all these have been beaten out of sight in America.</p>

  <p>At present Brazil claims the record for absolute length of the snakes
  themselves; but the Yankee snake-story man will soon claim that record too.
  He will explain that each State pays a reward for every snake killed within
  its own limits; but that there are always disputes between the different
  States as to payment; because most of the snakes killed are rather large,
  crawling across several States at once.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag10-11.gif"

  <p class="first">Here, among a number of viperine snakes of about the same
  size, is a snake that lives on eggs. He is about as thick as a lead pencil,
  but that doesn't prevent his swallowing a large pigeon's egg whole, nor even
  a hen's egg at a pinch. It dislocates his jaw, but that is a part of his
  professional system, and when the business is over he calmly joints up his
  jaw again and goes to sleep. He is eccentric, even for a snake, and wears his
  teeth on his backbone, where they may break the egg-shell so that he may spit
  it away. When he first stretched his head round an egg, the viperine snakes
  in the same case hastily assumed him to be a very large tadpole; and since
  tadpoles are regarded with gastronomical affection by viperine snakes, they
  began an instant chase, each prepared to swallow the entire phenomenon,
  because a snake never hesitates to swallow anything merely on account of its
  size.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag10-13.gif"

  <p class="first">When finally the egg-swallower broke the egg, and presented
  to their gaze the crumpled shell, the perplexed viperines subsided, and
  retired to remote corners of the case to think the matter over and forget
  it&mdash;like the crowd dispersed by the circulating hat of the
  street-conjurer.</p>

  <p>Familiarity with the snake breeds toleration. He is a lawless sort of
  creature, certainly, with too many vertebræ and no eyelids; but he is not
  always so horrible as he is imagined.</p><br>

  <p class="first">A snake is rather a pleasant thing to handle than otherwise.
  Warm, firm, dry, hard and smooth on the scales, rather like ivory to the
  touch. He is also a deal heavier than you expect. When for good behaviour I
  have been admitted to Tyrrell's inner sanctum here, and to the corridors
  behind the lairs, where hang cast skins like stockings on a line, I have
  handled many of his pets. I have never got quite as far as rattlesnakes,
  because rattlesnakes have a blackguardly, welshing look that I don't approve.
  But there is a Robben Island snake, about five feet long, with no poison, who
  is very pleasant company. It is a pity that these snakes have no pet names. I
  would suggest The Pirate as a suitable name for any snake from Robben
  Island.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag10-16.gif"

  <p class="first">For anybody who has been bitten by a cobra, or a
  rattlesnake, or a puff-adder, there are many remedies, but few people who can
  recommend them from personal experience. It is to be feared that most of them
  unfortunately die before writing their testimonials. Perhaps they were too
  long deciding which thing to take. The most famous of these remedies, and
  probably the best, on the whole, is to get excessively drunk. It is expensive
  to get drunk after a poisonous snake-bite, because something in the veins
  fortifies the head against the first bottle or two of whisky.</p><img src=

  <p class="first">Getting drunk before the bite won't do, although there would
  appear to be a very widely prevalent impression that it will, and a very
  common resolve to lay up a good store of cure against possible accidents in
  the future. This may be misdirected prudence, and nothing else, but there is
  often a difficulty in persuading a magistrate to think so.</p>

  <p>The snake <i>will</i> be eccentric, even in the matter of its eggs. Most
  snakes secure originality and independence in this matter by laying eggs like
  an elongated tennis-ball&mdash;eggs covered with a sort of white parchment or
  leather instead of shell. All the rest go further, and refuse to lay eggs at
  all.</p>

  <p>The snake insists on having his food fresh; you must let him do his own
  killing. Many carry this sort of fastidiousness so far as to prefer taking it
  in alive, and leaving it to settle matters with the digestive machinery as
  best it may.</p>

  <p>It is well to remember what to do in case of attack by a formidable snake.
  If a boa constrictor or a python begin to curl himself about you, you should
  pinch him vigorously, and he will loosen his folds and get away from you.
  Some may prefer to blow his head off with a pistol, but it is largely a
  matter of taste, and one doesn't want to damage a good specimen. The
  anaconda, however, who is the biggest of the constrictors, won't let go for
  pinching; in this case the best thing is not to let him get hold of you at
  all.</p><br>

  <p>Tobacco-juice will kill a puff-adder. If you come across a puff-adder, you
  should open his mouth gently, remembering that the scratch of a fang means
  death in half an hour or so, and give him the tobacco-juice in a suitable
  dose; or you can run away as fast as possible, which is kinder to the snake
  and much healthier for yourself.</p>

  <p>By far the biggest snake here is the python, in the case opposite the
  door; he is more than twenty feet long, and is seriously thinking of growing
  longer still. Tyrrell picks him up unceremoniously by the neck and shoves him
  head first into a tank of water, when he seems to need a little stir and
  amusement. I think, perhaps, after all, the most remarkable being exhibited
  in the reptile house is Tyrrell. I don't think much of the Indian
  snake-charmers now. See a cobra raise its head and flatten out its neck till
  it looks like a demoniac flounder set on end; keep in mind that a bite means
  death in a few minutes; presently you will feel yourself possessed with a
  certain respect for a snake-charmer who tootles on a flute while the thing
  crawls about him.</p>

  <p class="first">But Tyrrell comes along, without a flute&mdash;without as
  much as a jew's-harp&mdash;and carelessly grabs that cobra by the neck and
  strolls off with it wherever he thinks it ought to go, and you believe in the
  European after all. He is a most enthusiastic naturalist, is Tyrrell. He
  thinks nothing of festooning a boa constrictor about his neck and arms, and
  in his sanctum he keeps young crocodiles in sundry watering-pots, and other
  crawling things in unexpected places. You never quite know where the next
  surprise is coming from. I always feel doubtful about his pockets. I
  shouldn't recommend a pickpocket to try them, unless he really doesn't mind
  running against a casual rattlesnake.</p>

  <p>Tyrrell is the sort of man who is quite likely to produce something from
  his cap and say: "By-the-bye, this is a promising youngster&mdash;death
  adder, you know. And here," taking something else from his coat or vest

  curious. It isn't <i>very</i> poisonous&mdash;kills in an hour or so. Now,
  this," dragging another from somewhere under his coat, "<i>is</i> rather

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, May 1893</h3>

  <p class="first">WHEN an animal is more than usually a fool for its size,
  Nature indulgently permits it to go about with a pouch that it may not lose
  its family. Nature also sends it to live in Australia, and man, seeing more
  common sense in the pouch than anywhere else in the creature, calls the
  entire organism a marsupial, after the pouch. Only one marsupial is allowed
  to live out of Australia, and that is the opossum; but, then, the opossum is
  no fool, and can take care of itself in the outer world. Here at the Zoo,
  besides the opossum, we have kangaroos, wallabies, wallaroos, wombats, and
  certain other eccentric things, including the Tasmanian devil; but none is a
  bigger fool than the biggest marsupial, the kangaroo. This is natural,
  because he has most room to store his imbecility. The kangaroo's general
  weakness of character is visible all over him. He has never quite made up his
  mind what to be even now; he is nothing but a flabby compromise.</p>

  <div align="center">

        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">There would appear to be two plausible theories about the
  construction of the kangaroo; when, in the beginning, the animals chose their
  parts, the kangaroo may have been first, and weakly and indecisively chose at
  random, of no set purpose; or he may have been last, and obliged to put up
  with what was left. I incline to the first theory, partly because the
  kangaroo is well furnished as regards quality of parts, although they are
  oddly assorted, and partly because to make an indecisive</p><br>

  <div align="center">

  <p class="first">selection would be just in accord with his character. He
  fancied a sheep's head, rather, but hadn't enough decision of character to
  take a sheep's head as it was and be thankful for it. He preferred a donkey's
  ears to the sheep's, so had them substituted. Even then, some mistrust of the
  boldness of the design intimidated him, and he cautiously compromised by
  having them small. The only part of a kangaroo or wallaby that has the least
  independence about it is the tail; and the wallabies are so proud of the
  individuality, that they sit with their tails extended before them all
  day:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag11-02G.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p class="first">and the colonist acknowledges the merit of the kangaroo's
  tail by making soup of it. Let us grant the kangaroo his tail, since it is
  the only thing that is unmistakably his own. Abashed at his own temerity in
  venturing to take an independent tail, all the kangaroo's other selections
  became hopelessly demoralized. He took a grasshopper's hind legs, and
  plagiarized a rat's fore-paws. Obviously, he got the design of his coat
  partly from the rabbit and partly from the rat, and the idea of his pouch
  from the bookmaker.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag11-03.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>Now, it is a noticeable thing, illustrative of the mental stagnation of
  the kangaroo, that, having adopted the crude idea of the bookmaker's or
  'bus-conductor's pouch, he&mdash;or, rather, she&mdash;through all the
  generations, has never developed an improvement on that pouch, either by
  evolution, selection, or natural adaptation.</p><img src=

        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Even in these days of improvement, the kangaroo's pouch has no separate
  compartment for silver. Of course it is mainly used to carry the family in,
  but in any really intelligent and enterprising class of animals that pouch
  would long ago have improved and developed, through the countless ages, into
  a convenient perambulator, with rubber tires and a leather hood. As it is,
  the kangaroo has not so much as added a patent clasp. Still, in its merely
  primitive form, the pouch is found useful by the small kangaroo.</p><br>
  <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag11-05.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>It is an ever-ready refuge from the prowling dingo dog, and any little
  kangaroo who breaks a window has always a capital hiding-place handy. Indeed,
  the young kangaroo would fare ill without this retreat, because any other
  cradle the mother, being a kangaroo, would probably forget all about, and
  lose. It is only because the pouch hangs under her very nose that she
  remembers she has a family at all. All the kangaroo's strength seems to have
  settled down into the hind legs and the tail, leaving the other parts
  comparatively weak, and the head superlatively useless, except as an
  attachment for the mouth. One would imagine that in the period which has
  elapsed since the Creation the feeblest-minded of animals would have had time
  to arrive at some final choice in the matter of coat-colour; but the kangaroo
  hasn't. He never makes up his mind about anything; he begins life in a
  pale-grey colour; in a year or two he changes his mind and turns very
  dark&mdash;darker than either his father or his mother. The originality
  pleases him for a little while, and then he gets doubtful of his choice, and
  makes a wretched compromise&mdash;the kangaroo is compromise all
  over&mdash;settling down for the rest of his life to a tint midway between
  the light and the dark. If he lived a little longer he would probably
  experiment in blue. As it is, he sometimes makes an attempt in
  pink&mdash;with powder. Only the male kangaroo uses this cosmetic, and where
  he finds it and how he keeps it is a mystery; he doesn't put it on his
  face&mdash;he devotes it entirely to the complexion of his chest and
  stomach.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag11-06.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Australians call a full-grown male kangaroo a "boomer": why, I don't know.
  I could understand the application of the term in this country, where such a
  thing as a boom in boxing kangaroos has been heard of, and&mdash;this some
  while ago&mdash;a "white kangaroo" boom. The boxing kangaroo has made a very
  loud boom indeed, and has done something to earn the title of
  "boomer."</p><br>
  <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag11-07.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">Here, at the Zoo, however, there would seem to be little
  ambition among the kangaroos to distinguish themselves as boxing boomers; but
  there is a very frequent attitude suggestive of wrestling
  practice&mdash;perhaps because these would-be boomers have muddled things,
  and are thinking of the wrestling lion. Personally, I am not anxious either
  to box or to wrestle with a kangaroo; for the beast has a plaguey unpleasant
  hind foot, armed with a claw like a marline-spike, and a most respectable
  ability to kick a hole in a stranger with it. It is a kind of weapon that
  ordinary boxing and wrestling systems don't allow for, and not at all an
  amusing sort of thing to have lashing about among one's internal
  machinery.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag11-08.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>I don't wish to attribute any unsportsmanlike proceedings to the kangaroo
  now before the public, but to point out that the indiscriminate election of
  kangaroos into boxing clubs should be discouraged; especially of raw young
  kangaroos, ready to put on the gloves with anybody and to lose their tempers.
  Beware of kangaroo upper-cuts. Indeed, the boxing kangaroo should properly
  wear two pairs of gloves, and the bigger and softer pair should go upon his
  hind feet. For his is a form of <i>la savate</i> which admits neither of
  duck, guard, nor counter; and leaves its signature in a form long to be
  remembered and hard to stitch up.</p>

  <p>The white kangaroo was much less of a boomer. He dared to be original as
  to colour, and has been shivering and cowering and looking miserable ever
  since in terror of his own independence; he looks only a sort of unhappy
  white rabbit, overgrown in the hinder half. But there is encouragement to be
  got from the case of the boxing boomer. The kangaroo will never become clever
  of himself, but perhaps the showman may teach him. There are many comic
  opportunities in the kangaroo&mdash;particularly in the pouch. Let the
  showman see to it.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag11-09.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The most entirely objectionable of all the marsupials is the Tasmanian
  devil. It is only a little devil, a couple of feet or so long, but its
  savagery is beyond measuring by anything like a two-foot rule. No reasonable
  devils could wish to be treated with more indulgence than the Zoological
  Society extends to these. A rolling blind is provided to keep the sun out of
  their eyes, and they are politely labelled "Ursine Dasyures," for fear of
  offending them. They ill deserve either attention, and at any rate I should
  like to see the label changed. The function of the Tasmanian devil in the
  economy of Nature is to bite, scratch, tear and mangle whatever other work of
  Nature happens to be within reach. It is touching to observe the preference
  exhibited by the Tasmanian devil for its keeper, who feeds it; it tries to
  bite him much oftener and more savagely than anybody else. Thus you observe
  that kindness has some effect, even with the Tasmanian devil.</p><img src=
  "1500391h-images/ZigZag11-10.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">Of course, by its nature, it resents kindness more than
  anything else, but it will also attack anybody for cruelty, or indifference,
  or admiration, or curiosity, or for looking at it, or for not looking at it,
  or any other injury. You can't drive it away with anything; it won't go for a
  stick and it won't go for a gun; nevertheless it will go for you, like three
  hundred wild cats.</p>

  <p>The Tasmanian method of taming it is to blow it into space with a heavy
  charge of buckshot; and this seems to be the only way of rendering it quite
  harmless. In life the Tasmanian devil has one desire, one belief, one
  idea&mdash;general devastation. Herein, perhaps, he is the superior of the
  kangaroo, who doesn't have ideas.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag11-11.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>There is a superstition that once, in distant ages, a kangaroo had an
  idea, and if you closely observe a kangaroo who is left to himself, you may
  see something in that superstition. Ever since the time of that idea (which,
  of course, the kangaroo forgot) the whole race of kangaroos has been trying
  desperately to remember it. Whenever a kangaroo finds himself alone, and
  unobserved, he addresses himself to recollecting that idea.</p>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"

  <p>He gazes thoughtfully at his paws, finding no inspiration. Then, he tries
  the vacant air above him, with equal ill-success. He brown-studies at the
  fence, at the ground, at his own tail; he will never, never rescue that lost
  idea (which is probably a most insane one, not worth rescuing), but he is
  always persuading himself that he is on the very point of catching it;
  frowning and turning his head aside as though the words were in his mouth but
  wouldn't come off the tongue. You will also notice that he wrestles
  desperately with it in his sleep, with his fore paw over his nose. If in his
  waking efforts he sees you watching him, he instantly assumes an air of alert
  wisdom, intended to convey the belief that he has known all about the idea
  for years, and is only thinking about applying it in some practical way or
  making a book of it. But the attempt is a failure&mdash;those ears give it
  away. For intellectual pursuits the kangaroo is not fitted.</p><img src=

  <p>But he <i>can</i> jump; and the disconsolate grasshopper, whose hind-leg
  copyright the kangaroo has infringed, is far behind the record. It is, in
  fact, reported of an educated West Indian that, visiting New South Wales and
  encountering his first kangaroo, he sat down immediately to write an essay on
  the unusually large grasshoppers of Australasia.</p>

  <p>Whether or not a serious naturalist is justified in excluding from a
  chapter on marsupial animals a careful and detailed consideration of the
  bookmaker and the 'bus-conductor, I will not stay to argue. I refrain from
  dealing at length with these interesting creatures in this place, because of
  the regrettable absence of specimens from the Zoo. The conductor
  (<i>Bellpunchus familiaris</i>) is readily capturable in this country. The
  habits of the bookmakers (<i>marsupialis vulgaris</i>) may be studied, and
  their curious habits learned by anybody willing to incur the expense in the
  inclosures set apart for their exhibition at the various racecourses, where
  their sportive gambles are the subject of great interest (and principal) on
  the part of speculative inquirers.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag11-14.gif"

  <p>Mansbridge is the guardian of the kangaroos in the Zoo&mdash;or the
  kangaruler, as one may say. Most pouched things in the Gardens are given to
  the care of Mansbridge, which involves a sort of compliment, for a pouched
  thing is never clever by itself, and wants a keeper who can think for it. He
  has the wallabies, the kangaroo hares, the kangaroo rats (mad things these,
  greater hotch-potches than the others), and the wombats. The wombat cannot
  jump like the kangaroo or the wallaby, and his sprightliness and activity are
  the sprightliness and activity of a cast-iron pig. He is slow, but I scarcely
  think he is quite such an ass as the kangaroo. I have even found him
  indulging in repartee, as you shall see.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag11-15.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">Every single move­ment of any part of the wombat is
  deli­berate and well con­sidered; it is apparently debated at great length by
  all the other parts, and determined upon by a formal resolution, duly
  proposed, seconded, and carried by the complete animal properly assembled.
  Once the motion is carried, nothing can stop it. If the wombat's travels are
  crossed by a river, he merely walks into it, across the bottom, and out at
  the other side. Here, in lairs side by side, live a common wombat and a
  hairy-nosed wombat. They don't come out much in daylight, and they had been
  here some time before they found themselves both out for an airing together.
  "Halloa," reflected the hairy-nosed wombat, "here is my neighbour. I'll chaff
  him!" and he straightway set to work to invent some facetious observation. In
  an hour or so an idea struck him, and, advancing to the partition bars, he
  said to the common wombat, "Here, I say&mdash;you're common!" and laughed
  uproariously.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag11-16.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>The common wombat felt the sting of the remark and determined upon a
  crushing repartee. While the other chuckled over his achievement (about an
  hour and a half) the common wombat laboriously constructed his retort. "Yah!
  hairy-nose!" he said, when the reply was properly finished and polished. And
  then <i>he</i> chuckled, while the other thought it over. The hairy-nosed
  wombat thought it over and the common wombat thought it over (chuckling the
  while) for some hours without arriving at any more epigrams. After that they
  went into their dens to take a rest. And to this day it is a matter of
  dispute as to which has the best of that chaffing match: and the hairy-nosed
  wombat is as far off a brilliant reply to the common wombat as ever, while,
  of course, the common wombat need not begin to think of another witticism
  until the hairy-nosed wombat invents, constructs and delivers his. Which is
  why they never speak to one another now, as anybody may see for himself in
  proof of the anecdote, if he feel inclined to doubt it. Both are
  good&mdash;tempered and affable in their way; but while they still have this
  portentous combat of wits on hand they can't afford much time and attention
  for visitors. The common wombat still meditates and chuckles inwardly over
  his victory, and the hairy-nosed wombat is thinking hard, and mustn't be
  disturbed. It is difficult to imagine what may be the end of the affair, or
  when the minds of both the wombats may be free to attend to the friendly
  greetings of visitors; in the meantime, it is well that the reason for their
  preoccupation may be known. They are not proud. The intelligence of the
  marsupials is in some sort redeemed by the wombat, who is given a slow and
  inelastic gait to accord with his mental weight, while the frivolous kangaroo
  bounces about the world like a thing of india-rubber, and plays a game of
  leap-frog with all Nature.</p>

  a vile harpy, and the eagle is the embodiment of everything great and mighty,
  and glorious and free, and swooping and catoptrical. There is very little to
  say against the eagle, except that he looks a deal the better a long way off,
  like an impressionist picture or a volcano.</p>

  <p>When the eagle is flying and swooping, or soaring and staring impudently
  at the sun, or reproaching an old feather of his own in the arrow that sticks
  in his chest, or mewing his mighty youth (a process I never quite
  understood)&mdash;when he is doing noble and poetical things of this class at
  an elevation of a great many thousand feet above the sea level he is sublime.
  When you meet him down below, on his feet, much of the sublimity is rubbed
  off.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag12-04.gif"

  <p>There is only one eagle in the world with whom I can claim anything like a
  confidential friendship, although I know many. His name is Charley. If, after
  a chat with Bob the Bactrian, you will turn your back to the camel-house and
  walk past the band-stand toward the eagles' aviaries, you will observe that
  the first corner cage is occupied by wedge-tailed eagles&mdash;a most
  disrespectful name, by-the-bye, I think. There are various perches, including
  a large tree-trunk, for these birds; but one bird, the oldest in the cage,
  doesn't use them.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag12-05.gif"

  <p>He keeps on the floor by the bars facing the place where Suffa Culli and
  Jung Perchad stand to take up passengers, and looks out keenly for cats. That
  is Charley. He is all right when you know him, is Charley, and I have it on
  the best authority that there are no flies on him. A rat on the straggle has
  been known to turn up in this aviary and run the gauntlet of all the
  cages&mdash;till he reached Charley; nothing alive and eatable ever got past
  <i>him</i>. I have all the esteem and friendship for Charley that any eagle
  has a right to expect; but I can't admit the least impressiveness in his
  walk.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag12-06.gif"

  <p>An eagle's feet are not meant to walk with, but to grab things. An eagle's
  walk betrays a lamentable bandy-leggedness, and his toe-nails click awkwardly
  against the ground. This makes him plant his feet gingerly and lift them
  quickly, so that worthy old ladies suppose him to be afflicted with lameness
  or bunions, an opinion which disgusts the bird, as you may observe for
  yourself; for you will never find an eagle in these Gardens submitting
  himself to be fondled by an old lady visitor. It is by way of repudiating any
  suggestion of bunions that the eagle adopts a raffish, off-hand, chickaleary
  sort of roll in the gait, so that altogether, especially as viewed from
  behind, a walking eagle has an appearance of perpetually knocking 'em in the
  Old Kent Road.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag12-07.gif"

  <p>There is nothing in the world that pleases an eagle better at dinner-time
  than a prime piece of cat. Charley tells me that, upon the whole, he prefers
  a good, plump, mouse-fed tabby; he adds that he never yet heard of a tame
  eagle being kept at a sausage shop, though he would like a situation of that
  sort himself, very much. The stoop of a free eagle as it takes a living
  victim is, no doubt, a fine thing, except for the victim; but the grabbing of
  cut-up food here in captivity is merely comic. The eagle, with his
  Whitechapel lurch, makes for the morsel and takes it in his stride; then he
  stands on it in a manner somehow suggesting pattens, and pecks away at the
  hair&mdash;if, luckily, he has secured a furry piece.</p>

  <p>I am not intimate with any eagle but Charley, but I am very friendly with
  all of them&mdash;golden, tawny, white-tailed, and the rest, with their
  scowls and their odd winks&mdash;all but one other of the wedge-tailers, who
  stays for ever at the top of the tree trunk and looks out westward, trying to
  distinguish the cats in the gardens of St. John's Wood; he is reserved as
  well as uppish, and I don't know him to speak to.</p>

  <p>I am pretty intimate with many of the owls. The owl I know least is a
  little Scops owl, kept alone in the insect-house. He has for next-door
  neighbour a sad old reprobate&mdash;Cocky, the big Triton cockatoo&mdash;who
  abuses him horribly. The fact is, they both occupy a recess which once Cocky
  had all to himself, and now Cocky bullies the intruder up hill and down dale;
  although little Scops would gladly go somewhere else if he could, and takes
  no notice of Cocky's uncivil bawlings further than to lift his near wing
  apprehensively at each outburst. He and I have not been able to improve our
  acquaintance greatly, partly because he is out of reach, and partly because
  Cocky's conversation occupies most of his time. The Zoo owls are a lamentably
  scattered family.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag12-11.gif"

  <p>Another Scops owl, with one eye, lives in the eastern aviary, in Church's
  care. He is a charming, furious little ruffian (I am speaking of the owl, and
  not of Church), and perfectly ready to peck any living thing, quite
  irrespective of size.</p>

  <p>Where he lost his eye is a story of his own, for he was first met with but
  one. He sits on his perch with a furious cock of the ears&mdash;which are not
  ears at all, but feathers&mdash;with the aspect of being permanently prepared
  to repel boarders; and the only thing that could possibly add to his
  fierceness of appearance would be a patch over the sight of the demolished
  eye; a little present I would gladly make myself, if he would let me.</p>

  <p>He lives just underneath a much less savage little Naked-foot Owl, who
  doesn't resent your existence with his beak, but gazes at you with a most
  extreme air of shocked surprise.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag12-13.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>He doesn't attack you bodily for standing on this earth on your own
  feet&mdash;he is too much grieved and scandalized. He looks at you as a
  teetotal lady of the Anti-Gambling League would look at her nephew if he
  offered to toss her for whiskies. He follows you with his glare of outraged
  propriety till you shrink behind Church and sneak away, with an indescribable
  feeling of personal depravity previously unknown. Why should this pharisaical
  little bird make one feel a criminal? As a matter of fact, he is nothing but
  a raffish fly-by-night himself; and his pious horror is assumed, I believe,
  as much to keep his eyes wide open and him awake as to impose on one.</p>

  <p>The owls' cages proper are away behind the llamas' house, and here you may
  study owl nature in plenty; and you may observe the owls, like people sitting
  through a long sermon, affecting various concealments and excuses for going
  to sleep in the daytime. The milky eagle-owl pretends to be waiting for a
  friend who never keeps his appointment. You come upon him as he is dozing
  away quietly; he sees you just between his eyelids, and at once stares
  angrily down the path as if he were sick of waiting, and the other owl
  already half an hour overdue. Of course there is no owl coming, so he shakes
  his head testily and half shuts his eyes.</p><br>

  <p>If you go away then, he goes to sleep again. If you stay, he presently
  makes another pretence of pulling out his watch and wondering if that owl is
  ever coming. He has practised the transparent deception so long that he does
  it now mechanically, and sleeps, I believe, or nearly so, through the whole
  process. The oriental owl does it rather differently. He doesn't open his
  eyes when you first wake him&mdash;this in order to give greater
  verisimilitude to his pretence of profound meditation; he wishes you to
  understand that it is not your presence that causes him to open his eyes, but
  the natural course of his philosophical speculations.</p><img src=

  <p>As a pundit, he disdains to appear to observe you; so he gazes solemnly at
  a vast space with nothing whatever for its centre. He sees you, but he knows
  you for a creature that never carries raw meat with it, like a keeper; a
  creature beneath the notice of <i>Bubo orientalis</i>.</p>

  <p>As a song-bird, the owl is not a conspicuous success. Perhaps he has
  learned this in the Zoo, for he cannot be induced to perform during visiting
  hours. He is a reserved person, and exclusive. If you, as a stranger, attempt
  to scrape his acquaintance, he meets you with an indignant
  stare&mdash;confound your impudence!</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag12-16.gif"

  <p>Nothing in this world can present such a picture of offended, astounded
  dignity as an owl. I often wonder what he said when Noah ordered him
  peremptorily into the Ark. As for myself, I should as soon think of ordering
  one of the beadles at the Bank.</p>

  <p>Many worthy owls, long since passed away as living things, now exist in
  their astral forms as pepper-boxes and tobacco-jars. They probably belonged,
  in life, to the same species as a friend of mine here, who exhibits one of
  their chief physical features.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag12-17.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"

  <p>He sits immovably still, so far as his body&mdash;his jar or
  pepper-reservoir&mdash;is concerned; indeed, if he is not disturbed, he sits
  immovably altogether, and sleeps. When he is disturbed he wakes in
  instalments, opening one eye at a time. He fixes you with his wild, fiery
  eye, his indignant stare. Start to walk round him; the head turns, and the
  stare follows you, with no movement whatever of the part containing the
  pepper. The head slowly turns and turns, without the smallest indication of
  stopping anywhere. I never tempted it farther than once round, but walked
  back the other way, for fear of strangling a valuable bird. Besides, I
  remembered an owl pepper-box once, which became loose in the screw through
  continual turning, so that the head fell off into your plate, and all the
  pepper after it.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag12-18.gif"

  <p>The biggest owls are the eagle-owls. The eagle-owls here occupy a similar
  sort of situation to that of the hermit in an old tea-garden. In a secluded
  nook behind the camel-house a brick-built cave is kept in a wire cage, which
  not only hinders the owls from escaping, but prevents them taking the cave
  with them if they do. The cave is fitted up with the proper quantity of weird
  gloom and several convenient perches; the perches, however, are indistinct,
  because the gloom is obvious. In the midst of it you may see two fiery eyes,
  like the fire-balls from a Roman candle, and nothing else. This is the most
  one often has a chance of seeing here in bright day.</p><br>

  <p>Often the eagle-owls are asleep, and then you do not even see the
  fireworks. I know the big eagle-owl fairly well; that is to say, I am on
  snarling terms with him. But once he has settled in his cave he won't come
  out, even when I call him Zadkiel.</p>

  <p>There are very few birds that I should not like to keep as pets if I had

  <p>The least unpleasant-looking of the lot is the little Angola vulture, who
  is put among the kites; and she is bad enough: a horrible eighteenth-century
  painted and powdered old woman; a Pompadour of ninety. The large bearded
  vulture is not only an uncompanionable fellow to look at, but he doesn't
  behave respectably. It is not respectable to hurl yourself bodily against
  anybody looking over a precipice and unaware of your presence, so as to break
  him up on the rocks below, and dine off his prime cuts. I have no doubt that
  Self&mdash;(Self, by-the-bye, keeps eagles and vultures as well as
  camels)&mdash;has any amount of sympathy for his charges, but who
  <i>could</i> make a pet of a turkey-vulture, with its nasty, raw-looking red
  head, or of a cinereous vulture, with its unwholesome eyes and its
  unclean-looking blue wattle? No, I am not over-fond of a vulture. He is
  always a dissipated-looking ruffian, of boiled eye and blotchy complexion,
  and you know as you look at him that he would prefer to see you dead rather
  than alive, so that he might safely take your eyes by way of an appetizer,
  and forthwith proceed to lift away your softer pieces preparatory to
  strolling under your ribs like a jackdaw in a cage much too small. He sits
  there placid, unwinsome, and patient; waiting for you to die. But he has his
  little vanities. He is tremendously proud of his wings&mdash;and they
  certainly are wings to astonish. On a warm day he likes to open them for
  coolness, but often he makes this a mere excuse for showing off. He waits
  till some easily-impressed visitor comes along&mdash;not a regular
  frequenter. Then he stands up and spreads his great pinions abroad, and
  perhaps turns about, and the visitor is duly impressed.</p>

  <p class="first">So the vulture stands and receives the admiration, hoping
  the while that the visitor has heart disease, and will drop dead where he
  stands. And when the visitor walks off without dying the old harpy lets his
  wings fall open, ready for somebody else.</p>

  <p class="first">THE DOG is a strange and mysterious creature, and what he
  <i>is</i>, innately, is a problem of life. To consider him a mechanical
  organism on four legs intended to carry sticks and provide a benevolent
  Government with an annual seven-and-sixpence, is the mooning of the common
  fool; of the fool, moreover, who never knew a dog to speak to.</p><img src=

  <p>To talk of instinct is but to announce oneself the empty creature of a
  formula. The fact that he is derived (ages back) from the wolf increases, if
  possible, his mystery; for every bad quality which the domestic dog has not
  the wolf has, with no compensating virtue except that you needn't buy a
  license to keep him; notwithstanding which recommendation most people prefer
  to keep a dog for ordinary purposes. That the dog did not arrive at his
  present moral state at any extremely remote age is evident from the popular
  fables and proverbs relating to him, for therein he always appears a mean,
  wolfish beast, and a fool to boot. As witness the Dog in the Manger, the Dog
  with a Shadow, the Dog with an Ill Name, and the rest of them. So that the
  reformation of the dog has come about in comparatively recent times, and it
  is a testimony to his innate worth that constant association with man since
  his conversion has not corrupted him.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag13-04.gif"

  <p class="first">Tom, the large grey wolf here at the Zoo, is, I am almost
  convinced, some­what in a way of reform­ation himself. If he feels hungry,
  you may see him approach the bars and wag his tail; this on the off-chance of
  your having a bit of raw beef about you. But he can't smile with anything
  like cordiality; no wolf can. His tail looks amiable enough, but he conducts
  business with the opposite end, which is not so reassuring to look
  at&mdash;which, in fact, contradicts the tail flatly. As he stands thus, end
  on, you would scarcely guess the number of pounds of solid meat that Tom has
  put away within a couple of days.</p>

  <p>He has a lanky, thin, edge-forward sort of aspect, as though he were cut
  out of a deal board with a saw, and only intended to be looked at broadside
  on, like a piece of stage scenery.</p>

  <p>Tom won't show his teeth quite so readily as Coolie, the Indian wolf, next
  door. You cannot make a captive wolf show his teeth by the ordinary means of
  waving a hat or an arm&mdash;he disregards this sort of thing entirely. You
  must catch him unawares, and startle him by a sudden rush towards the bars
  with your head down.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag13-06.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>This will give you an undesirable appearance of mental derangement; but,
  properly executed, it will startle the wolf. You will betray Tom into a
  temporary exhibition of ferocity but he will recover instantly, and pretend
  that he only opened his mouth to yawn. When he has finished his yawn he will
  glance casualty and serenely down the cages, with a contemptuous air of never
  having seen you at all, and of being quite unaware that such a person as
  yourself was ever born. This treatment is very galling, coming as it does
  from a wolf whom even its proprietors are fain to label "common"; but you
  shouldn't have laid yourself open to it, to begin with.</p>

  <p>The gentleman who sent Tom here can handle him as much as he pleases, and
  treat him precisely as one would treat an ordinary house-dog, but Tom has a
  persuasive way of inducing other people not to try the game on their own
  account&mdash;not to try it more than once, at any rate. He will recognise
  his old master joyfully after a year or two's absence, but I have not yet
  entered upon patting terms with Tom myself; because I know that lathy
  appearance of limb to be a deception and a snare. But, at least, Tom is half
  reformed, and if he lives another few hundred years will probably develop the
  regular way into a dog.</p>

  <p>Coolie, next door, is a ruffian, and makes no shame of it. He would like a
  piece out of you, and doesn't care if you know it. If anything, he would
  prefer two pieces. Failing that, he would like a piece of Tom; or of North,
  the keeper; or of Bob, the Eskimo dog; or of his own grandmother, if he could
  get it. There's no weak sentiment about Coolie. The only thing that would
  dissuade him from eating a relation would be the event of the relation first
  eating him. I don't altogether like Coolie; he is not the sort of chap that
  anybody would fall in love with at first sight. He won't meet your eye so
  long as he is out in the cage. Try to fix him for a moment; try to annoy him,
  in fact. He will evade your eye in the shiftiest fashion, keeping you in
  sight, however, with the corner of his own, for fear of accidents. Presently,
  at the end of his patience, he will retreat into his lair and give you a
  straight look at last; one which will convince you at once of the
  multifarious advantages of conducting these little experiments from this side
  of the bars.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag13-09.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>But even Coolie has his softer moments, when he will rub against the bars
  to be patted. I like to pat Coolie myself, and I consider any method of
  patting him to be in many respects the best. When I see Coolie against the
  bars and looking amiable (for Coolie), and I feel disposed to pat him, I call
  North, and authorize him to pat Coolie on my behalf. In this way I have
  become quite friendly with Coolie, who is as affable under my pats as if I
  were his keeper. I shall always pat Coolie like this; I am able to devote
  more attention to the general superintendence of the proceedings when I have
  an assistant to attend to the manual detail. Sometimes Sutton helps me pat
  the lions in the same way. It requires a little nerve, of course, but I am
  always perfectly cool.</p>

  <p>Bob, the Eskimo dog, lives in the next cage to Coolie, and in the next
  cage still there are a pair of prairie wolves, whose improvement on the
  common wolf lies only in externals. To look at, they seem a kind of collie,
  but with a finer model of head than any collie-breeder can produce. Except in
  appearance, they are far back in the blackest ages of wolfdom. One of
  them&mdash;Charlie&mdash;has an offensive habit of sitting up on the
  coping-pier from which the cage division-bars spring, because that is
  regarded as a sort of feat of gymnastics, impossible to the other wolves,
  since they are too big. If you particularly want him to perform, for your
  amusement, he won't do this trick, small as it is; but when you are not
  looking he persists in it, by way of annoying the neighbours who can't
  perform it. Perhaps, after all, the Dog in the Manger wasn't a dog at all,
  but a prairie wolf. The man who called him a dog didn't examine him closely
  enough; few people stay long to examine a loose wolf. Like a dog as the
  prairie wolf is&mdash;and he tries his utmost to maintain this respectable
  appearance&mdash;his drooped tail, his snarling mouth, and his small eyes,
  expose the pretence. He is attempting his promotion in the wrong
  way&mdash;merely by imitating the uniform of the superior rank.</p><img src=

  <p>There can be no reasonable doubt that the wolf wants to be a dog if he
  can. He quite understands his rascally inferiority, but will never give up
  his social ambition, especially when so many visitors encourage his vanity,
  time after time, by mistaking him for a dog. There are times when such a
  mistake is natural&mdash;almost pardonable. On a hot day, for instance, a
  wolf, to cool his mouth, will muster up a most commodious smile&mdash;present

  <p>But the wolf is too sad a blackguard to redeem himself by an occasional

  <p class="first">Give a well-bred dog a biscuit, and he will munch it with
  gentlemanly relish and keep a polite welcome ready for another. A wolf, being
  always hungry enough to eat anything, will take it, but in an indifferent,
  perfunctory, disdainful fashion, not vouchsafing the courtesy of concealing
  his contempt for your present; while animal food drives him to the opposite
  extreme. The wolf can't even sleep like a dog. Bob, the Eskimo (who is a
  gentleman among dogs, with low neighbours whose manners he despises), sleeps
  as an honest dog always does sleep; flung upon the ground with his legs,
  head, and tail spread about fearlessly, and his mind as conscious of
  rectitude as if he could tell you so in Latin.</p><img src=

  <p class="first">Tom or Coolie can't sleep like that. The wolf tries to hide
  under himself. He remembers his many crimes, even in sleep, and can't trust
  his legs or his tail or anything else in sight. He hides his tail between his
  legs, and resorts to the most complicated and twisty devices for arranging
  his legs to hide each other. He gets underneath himself, covers himself over
  him, and tucks in the corners; and even then his sleep is restless. I don't
  think Red Riding Hood's grandmother has ever been properly digested.</p>

  <p>Bob, the Eskimo dog, is a fine fellow, as friendly as any dog you may
  name, except to wolves. He would be glad to visit the wolves next door, and
  take their machinery to pieces hastily with his teeth, and the wolves so
  heartily reciprocate the sentiment that a sheet-iron memorial of the fact has
  been erected between the cages. There is another dog called Bob a little
  further along&mdash;the Dingo dog. He is a cunning-looking fellow, of more
  civilized condition than the wolves, but sharing with them their chief
  characteristic of eternal hunger. The Dingo dog is the only animal that can
  beat the cat's collection of nine lives; he is calculated to possess
  twenty-seven. If you give a wild Dingo a single bang on the head he will lie
  down as if killed at once, shamming; lying doggoh, in fact. But you may beat
  him out flat and dissect him, and as soon as your back is turned he will
  gather together his outlying fragments, blow himself into shape, and walk
  home. He doesn't mind a little accident of that sort.</p>

  <p>In this row of cages, too, are jackals&mdash;black-backed jackals,
  ordinary jackals, and extraordinary jackals, as well as foxes. A jackal is
  recognisable at once&mdash;a mean-looking fox of the wrong colour. The
  prettiest jackal is the black-backed, but still he is a jackal and nothing
  better; as unmistakable as though he went about singing, "My name it is
  Jackal," after the Coal Hole bard. It is odd to observe how, in a jackal the
  influence of ages of habit remains. Never hunting for himself; and always
  waiting for the broken leavings of some more powerful hunter, he cannot, even
  now in his cage, altogether believe that his dinner is intended, in the first
  place, entirely for himself. So, when North pokes it between the bars he
  hesitates for a moment, and looks round for the lion. It is sad life wherein
  one doubts ownership in one's own dinner.</p><br>

  <p>A fox must be an unpleasant sort of person to live with, for other reasons
  beside the smell. A fox's conversation consists chiefly of snarls. Put two
  foxes together, and they will at once begin to invent occasions for snarling
  at one another. They don't quarrel outright, probably from fear of the
  consequences. The favourite device of one of the Indian desert foxes here is
  of a Donnybrookian flavour. His mate has a way of amusing herself with a
  little circus&mdash;just trotting round the floor in a ring. He watches her
  at this amusement, and when a snarl seems desirable, he dismounts from his
  perch and lays his tail just across her track, and waits for her to trample
  on it; then he snarls and snaps at her face, and she snarls and snaps at his.
  This being accomplished, he returns, perfectly satisfied, to his roost, to
  rest and doze till his system requires refreshing with another snarl. A
  properly-executed mutual snarl, almost approaching a bite, will last him for
  ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>

  <p>These foxes&mdash;all of them&mdash;have a very irritating cause of bad
  temper to contend with in the existence of a fine pair of Chinese geese a few
  yards beyond the obstructive bars. The ordinary fox has arrived at a stoical
  attitude of indifference to the Chinese goose. He affects to believe that he
  is uneatable. The Chinese goose wears a black stripe behind his neck, rather
  suggestive of a pigtail; this the fox points out to his friends as evidence
  of uneatability, having learned the consolation from a relative who once had
  a fancy for grapes.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag13-21.gif"

  <p>As for the wolf, the cause of man's hatred for him lies in the fact that a
  wolf nursed Romulus and Remus. If this malevolent creature had left them as
  they were, they would have been drowned in the Tiber. Thus Romulus would
  never have built Rome, and there would have been no Caesar, no Dr. Smith's
  Smaller Roman History, no Principia Latina, and untold misery would have been
  spared many generations of long-suffering schoolboys. No wonder that the wolf
  is held in horror and detestation by all nations, and is exterminated
  mercilessly wherever found.</p>

  <p>Years of bitter tears, bitter Caesar, bitter Accidence, bitter Smith's
  Smaller, and bitterest swish have left their scar upon the human soul, and
  roused up an hereditary and traditional hatred of the beast, but for whose
  malignant interference All Gaul would never have been divided in Three Parts;
  a hatred only second in its wild intensity to that of the snake who beguiled
  Eve. Consequently the wolf for ever wears his tail between his legs, as does
  every member of the canine kind unbeloved by man, which, by-the-bye, is a
  noticeable thing in itself, but obvious to everybody who shall compare those
  in this row.</p>

  <p>This faithful creature kept ceaseless watch over his masters without
  eating, drinking, or sleeping, for the trying period of 309 years. It is the
  most wonderful instance of a dog's fidelity I ever came across, and an
  excellent specimen of the dog story in several respects. Speaking of facts,
  it is not generally known that some day a great wolf is to arise in the North
  (according to Scandinavian prophecy) and swallow the sun and moon. One is
  usually a little inclined to distrust this statement until he has seen a wolf
  at work on an ordinary meal; never after. Indeed, one has only to see Coolie
  louping swiftly to and fro, and Tom bouncing against his back door when
  feeding-time approaches, to feel that it wouldn't be altogether safe to leave
  the moon loose hereabout with nobody to take care of it.</p>

  <p class="first">A SENSE of humour is a vastly saving grace. Long has it
  saved all the Corvidae from exterminaion at the hands of outraged man. The
  raven, the jackdaw, the magpie, the rook&mdash;what would their thievishness,
  their malignant mischief, earn were it not for their sense of humour.</p>

  <p>Thieves all, they are still Artful Dodgers and Charley Bateses, and we
  smile though they snatch our very dinner. The snatching of the dinner from
  somebody else's jaws, friend's or enemy's, is the main plot of most of the
  raven's jokes, causing him also to secrete a spare morsel in the baggy part
  of his lower beak, when other ravens are about.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag14-02.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>Extreme quickness lends additional quaintness to the pranks of the raven.
  The ravens at the Zoo, ever changing in <i>personnel</i>, remain true to a
  sort of mixed game of coddam and hunt the slipper. Let one of their number
  produce his stored morsel, and instantly it has been snatched, snatched, and
  snatched again, all along the line and back. With whom it at last rests only
  one mortal creature knows&mdash;the raven who has it. In him a natural
  exultation struggles with an attempt to look as though he had lost the
  tit-bit. In the others the chagrin of loss wars with a desire to look
  triumphant; so that the net result is a very level appearance of general
  stolidity.</p>

  <p>Sardonic joker as he is, the raven has an immense sense of personal
  dignity. He is the greatest of the Corvidae, and he knows it. Not for him the
  scrambling hilarity of his small cousin, the jackdaw. Don't injure the
  raven's self-esteem, or he will be revenged, at some time or another. I have
  known a tame raven wait for months for an opportunity of plucking off, before
  a large company, the wig of a lady of doubtful age who had referred to him
  disrespectfully as "that thieving beast."</p><img src=

        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Also, when an innocent little boy at the Zoo has asked his mother if the
  raven were a blackbird, I have observed a look of indignation that carried
  with it a distinct threat to bite that little boy's little red legs. Never
  will a raven forget his dignity. Even a raven in love won't do it. He has,
  after all, considerable excuse for pride. A bird on such familiar terms with
  the great Odin as to sit on his shoulder every evening and retail to him the
  day's gossip is naturally proud. One Scandinavian legend mentions two such
  ravens, but I imagine that they are a sort of prophetic allegory, intended to
  typify successive editions of the evening paper. The belief in the raven as a
  bird of ill-omen probably arose from the fact that he was never known to turn
  up anywhere without stealing something, or doing mischief in some other way;
  just as one may consider a nitro-glycerine bomb an unlucky article to find on
  the cellar stairs.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag14-04.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>His fame as a prophet&mdash;and he was chief of the ancient
  augurs&mdash;may be due to many things. Perhaps he had a wrinkle or two from
  Elijah in recognition of the supply of provisions; or he may even have felt a
  motive for his generosity in a certain fellow-feeling; which would at least
  seem a plausible conjecture, since otherwise it is impossible to conceive of
  his refraining from stealing the supplies <i>en route</i>.</p>

  <p>Travis is the keeper of the crows' cages, as also of the great Western
  Aviary. He is a most surprising authority on birds, and is no fledgeling
  himself; he is the oldest keeper in the service, as his "No. 1" testifies,
  and has been here since the year 1851.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag14-05.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>I have been lingering over the name "Travis" for some time, separating it
  thoughtfully into T. R. Avis, with an ultimate idea of a pun, or an acrostic,
  or a rebus, or a charade, or conundrum, or something of the kind, but have
  regretfully given up the notion. Still, considering his almost unique
  knowledge of birds&mdash;not to mention the ability of his brother as a
  bird-staffer&mdash;I think Travis might arrange, by deed-poll, for some such
  name as <i>Terrae Rara Avis</i>, if the equal mutilation of name and
  catch-phrase be tolerated.</p>

  <p>Among the many curious birds in the domain of Travis is the laughing
  jackass. Now, there are several reasons why something should be said here of
  the laughing jackass.</p>

  <p>In the first place, this is a Zig-zag, and since it is headed "Zig-zag
  Corvine," it is proper and in accordance with the correct spirit of
  Zig-zaggedness that something should he included that isn't corvine at all.
  Moreover, it is fitting that a bird which is called a jackass and is indeed a
  king- fisher, and being a kingfisher doesn't catch fish, should be classed
  with something that is neither jackass nor king-fisner nor fish, to carry out
  the original principle.</p>

        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The laughing jackass is a broad low-comedy sort of bird, who usually makes
  your acquaintance in a little game of spoof of his own. He knows that you
  have come to the cage to hear him laugh, so he won't do it. But in order to
  keep you there in expectancy as long as possible, he pretends to have
  discovered an enemy, or something to eat, or the ghost of some other jackass,
  close by. He stares intently at nothing, and then turns round and inspects it
  on the other side. He crouches cautiously on his perch and looks at it
  cornerwise. He organizes an elaborate plan of strategy, and makes a beginning
  of ap­proaching nothing on tip-toe. He finds that it has observed him, and
  forthwith ducks his head and looks out warily. It moves, and he follows it
  intently with his eyes; he seems about to spring at nothing, and you become
  excited; when he suddenly lets it go and grins at you, and you realize that
  you are sold.</p>

  <p>The laughing jackass is not a distinguished joker, like the raven. He is a
  very frantic sort of buffoon; one who imagines he has a funny reputation to
  maintain, and who strains to maintain it at all hazards. Which is why he
  bursts into his demoniac laugh at certain regular times of the day&mdash;a
  habit which has earned him the unflattering name of the "Settlers' Clock."
  The fact is, he has been trying for hours, unsuc­cessfully, to think of a
  joke, and laughs to make the world believe that he has made one. It is
  noticeable that with these birds laughing is highly infectious, and that when
  one starts the rest join at once, each trying to outscream the others. Every
  individual is trying to claim the joke for himself.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag14-08.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>Personally, I incline to the belief that the laughing jackass, as a tribe,
  has only one joke. Mutual admiration societies are formed, and the members
  tell each other this joke in turn, and laugh unanimously.</p>

  <p>You may see the system in operation here. One bird will burst upon a few
  friends with the air of a breathless discoverer and a vast number of
  chuckles. He tells the ancestral joke, in confidence, to jackass the second.
  Then the two scream and choke with delirious laughter, and the joke is passed
  on to jackass the third, and so forth&mdash;and fifth, and sixth&mdash;till
  every jackass is screaming for a minute together, till the regular amount of
  mutual admiration has been ex pended, and they stop suddenly and cock their
  beaks demurely for the approbation of visitors.</p>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"

        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>For the laughing jackass's own sake, I wouldn't introduce him to a raven
  because the jackass would be sure to repeat the joke to his new acquaintance,
  and the raven, a sardonic and superior joker, would be apt to deal savagely
  with him; and this more because of the badness of the joke than its age. I
  know a raven named Elijah (there would appear to have been some confusion of
  Scriptural history at his christening) who would be a bad subject for the
  laughing jackass's joke. He is not at the Zoo, but in private ownership,
  which is a great deal the worse in general devilment for the private owner,
  although he hasn't discovered it for himself yet.</p>

  <p>Elijah's chief delight, by the way, is to run loose in a flower garden or
  a conservatory, where the surroundings may be reduced to a salad in about
  five minutes. "Do you know why they call me a laughing jackass?" <i>Dacelo
  gigantea</i> might ask Elijah; for this conundrum, I am convinced, is the
  ancestral wheeze. "Perhaps it's because you're a jackass to laugh so much,"
  Elijah would say, severely. "No, you're wrong!" would scream that fatuous
  kingfisher. "It's because they think Jack&mdash;as good as any other name!
  Ha! ha! How's that? Isn't Jackass good as his master?" and he would guffaw
  deliriously while Elijah sharpened his big beak.</p><img src=

        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>"H'm," Elijah would grunt, with savage calmness, when the laugh was over.
  "Just make another joke like that, will you?" And the unhappy jackass would
  have to save himself as best he might.</p>

  <p>The laughing jackass is all very well as a chorus, but he can't sustain a
  separate low-comedy part. The raven can, the jackdaw and the magpie can, the
  jay can, and even the rook and the ordinary crow have their humoursome
  talents.</p><br>

  <p>The chaplain crow becomes a very passable Stiggins, under the influence of
  the sun, which acts as his pineapple rum. Hot sunshine opens the mouth of the
  chaplain crow, and causes a rolling of the head and eyes, suggestive of a
  lachrymose sermon; and a spasmodic croak that is an overcharged rant by
  itself. You grow more serious at each step nearer the chaplain crow on these
  occasions, and you pull up with a start at the thought of a collection. I am
  not sure that much of his distress is not caused by the laughing jackasses,
  who have an impious practice of laughing at their conundrum on
  Sunday.</p><br>

  <p>There is a temptation to call the three worst offenders among the
  jackasses Tom, and Bob, and Billy, and the chaplain crow Sir Macklin, by
  compliment or with apologies to the "Bab Ballads"; but, in good truth, there
  is no other name for the chaplain crow but Stiggins. His white choker is
  ragged and soiled and pulled askew on his neck. You look at him for long with
  an indefinite conviction that something is wanting in his equipment. A red
  beak would be an improvement, certainly and to secure it a cross with the
  chough might be tried; but what you really miss in Stiggins is a black bottle
  and bad umbrella.</p><br>

  <p>The raven was once white, Ovid tells us, but Apollo turned him black for
  tale-bearing. The rook and the crow must have told tales, too, unless Apollo
  condemned the lot at once, from uncertainty as to the actual culprit. The
  magpie and the chaplain crow are only partly black&mdash;offence not
  specified. Perhaps they told white lies. Here at the Zoo are two perfectly
  white jackdaws, and I have spent some time in an effort to discover for what
  conspicuously virtuous exploit they have been so distinguished. I can find
  nothing in their histories greatly to distinguish them from other jackdaws
  except the colour of their feathers.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag14-15.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>I have known many jackdaws and have possessed a few, but cannot, by any
  effort, imagine one of them doing anything particularly virtuous; jackdaws by
  nature are not intended to be pious. I have a jackdaw now who is a most
  interesting and pleasing thief, liar, and bully, but he neglects the more
  usual moral qualities. As a thief and a liar his performances are probably no
  more remarkable than those of other jackdaws, but as a bully he has ways of
  his own. He bullies every living thing with less brains than himself,
  irrespective of size, and eats such of them as are small enough. He hectors
  cats tremendously&mdash;merely by force of superior intellect.</p>

  <p>When a cat perceives a bird&mdash;the size of some she is in the habit of
  trying to catch&mdash;pelting headlong toward her down a garden-path, with
  furious eyes and beak, shouting "Hullo, Jack! Shut up! Shut up! Come along,
  old girl! Hi! hi! hi!"&mdash;that cat has some excuse for hastily retiring
  over the wall to think things over; and Jack cocks his head and chuckles. He
  bullies dogs when they will allow it; when he meets one that won't, he finds
  a safe perch and abuses him violently. He will even bully a housemaid who is
  afraid of having her heels pecked. Once he went on a visit and tried to bully
  Elijah, but that was very nearly being another tale. Elijah is not the sort
  of bird anyone would bully for pastime, and Jack found speed as useful as
  intellect, for once in a way. But if he came to the Zoo to-morrow, he would
  probably begin by bullying Jung Perchad.</p>

  <p>The raven was never meant to be bullied. He is a wag, certainly, but a wag
  of a satanic sort. His very chuckle is fierce; and when the heat makes him
  open his mouth to pant, it isn't with a lachrymation, as the chaplain crow,
  nor with a grin, as the magpie, but with a severe and business-like
  seriousness, that says plainly that somebody's heels must be bitten for this;
  preferebly, I imagine, Apollo's, as the gentleman that drives the sun; and
  who, also, first made the raven as black as he could possibly be painted. The
  full age of the raven is not known, and in the belief of many he shares with
  the donkey the reputation of immortality. Notwith standing which, Charles
  Dickens had a raven that died of too free indulgence in white paint.</p>

  <p>Like many another wag, the raven hates nothing so much as looking
  ridiculous; wherefore, in his private moments he practises dignity. It is the
  last thing one would expect of the raven, but he does it. Watch the occasion
  and you may observe him carefully practising a graceful and imposing emerging
  spring into his open cage, when he knows of nobody looking. And, in truth,
  the practised raven has a courtly bow, but it requires preparation and
  training. Betray your presence after he has substituted a downer with his
  nose for the stately bow and strut he had intended, and you will humiliate
  him as even plucking would not; and send him into retirement with a longing
  to snatch your watch.</p>

  entomologist has his own ideas as to classification, and each system of
  classification, considered separately, seems to consist of an aggravation of
  the confusions of all the other systems. Therefore let us have no system in
  our contemplation whatsoever it may please us unprofitably and frivolously to
  observe.</p>

  <p>The illustrative moralist has a way of rushing to the insect world for his
  lessons, though a moment's reflection and a few inquiries would convince him
  that the insect world is the most immoral sphere of action existing. The
  pervading villainy of the whole insect kingdom is obvious in the very system
  of their existence; for if ever you inquire what is the earthly use of some
  particular insect, you always find that it is to eat some other insect,
  which, if allowed to increase, would do all sorts of frightful damage. You
  then find that the use of this second insect is to kill some other insect, an
  equal pest; the object in life of the third insect being to unite in large
  numbers and assassinate some entirely different and very large insect indeed,
  who spends his days and nights skirmishing about and devouring all the
  different sorts of insects we have just been speaking of.</p>

  <p>Therefore, since the mission of every insect is to kill some other, it is
  plain that murder is the chief occupation of the insect tribes, and even the
  illustrative moralist is reported to admit that murder is not a strictly
  moral amusement. Also, since it is proper that every insect should be kept in
  restraint by some other, it is plain that the sum of insect depravity, apart
  from murder, must be vast indeed; which disposes of the insect as a popular
  preacher. But the insect as an ogre, the insect as a pirate, as a flute, a
  flageolet, a torpedo, a Jew's harp, a walking-stick, a double bass, and a
  Jack-in-the-box&mdash;in such characters he shines, often literally. For the
  beetle <i>Xylotrupes</i>, with his glossy back, is a double bass, and nothing
  in the world else&mdash;unless it be a bloated violoncello. Just as the stick
  insect may be a flute, a flageolet, a walking-stick, or a mere twig, as fancy
  may persuade you; and as the trap-door spider may be a Jack-in-the-box or a
  wicked ogre rising through the stage in a pantomime.</p><img src=

  <p>Here, in the Insect House, one may see the trap-door in all its neatly
  fitting and spring-hinged guile, and there is no reason why a moral fable
  should not be built round him, or round any other insect, so long as he is
  not elevated to an ethical pedestal whereon he has no right. For instance,
  one might tell the Fable of the Artful Spider and the Fascinating Beetle
  thus: "A certain Green Beetle, that was a great Belle, was much Beloved by a
  Brown Spider, owning an elegant and convenient Trap-door in a Fashionable

  <p class="first">But his Suit had an unfavourable course owing to the
  intervention of a Prussian Blue Beetle, who was the more favoured Swain.
  Having thought on many Stratagems, the Spider at length placed a rustic seat
  near his Dwelling, and Advertised that that was the Place to Spend a Happy
  Day, knowing full well that he Green Beetle and the Prussian Blue Beetle
  would take Cheap Returns, and sit upon the rustic seat to Spoon. And when
  things fell out as he had intended, behold, he arose from his Den and Tickled
  the Prussian Blue Beetle in the Ribs, quietly Concealing himself. And having
  Repeated this, at length he left open the Trap-door, taking Ambush behind it;
  and when the Prussian Blue Beetle arose and investigated the Premises, with
  great Speed did the Spider hasten to shut down the Lid upon him, placing a
  Weight thereon, to reconcile him to his Incarceration. And straightway the
  Spider did make his Court unto the Green Beetle, and they lived as happy as
  usual ever afterward. <i>Moral</i>: We may learn from this History, that, as

  <p>The big hairy Tarantula Spider, too, the ogre that will kill a bird or a

  <p>Speaking of booms, by the way, one remembers that, according to Tennyson,
  "At eve the beetle boometh." But the only beetle one remembers as effecting
  much in the way of a boom is the Colorado Beetle. The beetle, as a general
  thing, is not given to publicity of any sort, preferring a retired and quiet
  life. He never interferes in public affairs&mdash;having too many legs to
  look after. The Bombardier Beetle, however, <i>can</i> boom. Touch him, and

  <p>Quantrill, here, is very kind to the Tarantula Spiders, often giving them
  a steam bath to assist them in getting rid of their old suits of clothes.
  Quantrill keeps in order the moths, butterflies caterpillars, and spiders in
  the Insect House. He is a man who has arrived at a state of being when
  nothing feels crawly&mdash;not even a centipede. To be on terms of daily
  intimacy with lions, tigers, elephants, and pelicans is a great thing, but I
  feel a more peculiar awe for a man who is the confidential friend of several
  scorpions, and who keeps two spider-ogres on show in glass cases;
  consequently, I am always respectful to Quantrill, and inspect his person
  carefully for stray scorpions before coming very near.</p>

  <p>A certain amount of entomology is forced on everybody, whether of a
  scientific turn or not. There are very many seaside lodging-houses where the
  whole of the inmates, without distinction of scientific tastes, sleeplessly
  adopt the study from their first night of residence.</p><img src=

  <p>The sea air invariably stimulates interest in natural history. Nobody,
  therefore, however humble, need despair of acquiring entomological knowledge
  from want of material. The earnest student need do no more than buy an
  expensive sealskin cloak to gather together an instructive swarm of moths,
  sufficient to engage his attention for a long time. The Japanese, by-the-bye,
  have a pretty story to account for the rushing of moths at a flame. The
  moths, they say, in love with the night-flies, were bidden to fetch fire for
  their adornment.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag15-11.gif"

  <p>The moths, being naturally fools from the circumstance of being in love,
  rushed at the first flame available, and were damaged. This is a very pretty
  excuse for the moth, and perhaps more flattering than the belief prevalent in
  this country, which is that the moth is fool enough to burn himself without
  being in love. Because a moth never learns wisdom. Once having got away with
  the loss of half a wing, he might reasonably be expected, in future, on
  observing the light that caused the damage, to remark, knowingly, "Oh, that's
  an old flame of mine," and pass by on the other side. But he doesn't. He
  flies into it again and burns his other wing, or, more probably, roasts
  himself completely. Thousands of generations of scorched and roasted moths
  have passed away without developing the least knowledge of the properties of
  fire in their descendants. The moth remains consistent, and a
  fool.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag15-12.gif"

  <p>There are few things of its size more annoying than a bluebottle. He is
  always bursting with offensive, bouncing, robust animal spirits. He snorts
  and trumpets about your room in an absurdly important manner, when you are
  anxious not to be disturbed. To personal acquaintances of his own size he
  must be an intolerable nuisance. He is like those awful stout persons who
  wear very shiny hats very much on one side, who hum loud choruses, slap you

  <p>The Death Watch is an­other domestic insect never very cordially received.
  He only taps by way of telegraphic signal to his friends, but after all the
  terror he has caused he might have had the consideration to invent some other
  system. The Death-Watch, the Death's-Head-Moth, and the Pirate Spider are the
  banditti among insects&mdash;who are all cut-throats themselves to begin
  with.</p>

  <p>One of the most remarkable characteristics of insects as a class is their
  contempt for legs. No insect minds the loss of a leg or two, having so many
  others. A spider sometimes will get along very well with one. Indeed, every
  insect would seem to be made of parts which are complete strangers to each
  other. I have seen a wasp "divided," like Clonglocketty Angus McClan, "close
  by the waist," but not in the least inconvenienced by the solution of
  continuity. The front half, having the best of the bargain by reason of
  retaining the wings and legs, strolled away in the most unconcerned fashion,
  leaving the unfortunate abdomen, legless and wingless, to get home as best it
  might. Whereon one might construct yet another fable, relating the meeting of
  the front end of that wasp with an enemy, and its inability to use its sting
  at a critical moment, with the moral, Never Despise even a Deserted Abdomen.
  Wasps, by the way, are not social favourites. I have seen an ordinarily
  companionable man, not otherwise given to physical exercise, climb
  fatiguingly, and grovel painfully by way of excusing himself from making a
  wasp's closer acquaintance. And when a wasp succeeds in making a visit,
  alighting on a man's hand or neck, that man never asks him to sit down,
  because it is when a wasp sits down that one best understands the uselessness
  of his acquaintance. The only satisfactory way of averting a wasp-sting is to
  stand on the animal's back for five minutes before he commences.</p>

  <p>The domestic black-beetle is so called in celebration of its being brown
  in colour and not a beetle. Beetles are aristocrats who keep their wings in
  sheaths. The more proper name for <i>Blatta Orientalis</i> is the cockroach,
  because it is equally unlike a cock and a roach. Its use in the economy of
  Nature is to supply a consolation for big feet. It is well known as a kitchen
  ornament, although its natural diffidence of disposition induces it to
  reserve its decorative effects for the evening, when it organizes reviews and
  parades on every available spot. Few domestic pets are regarded more
  affectionately by their proprietors. Lettuce leaves and wafers are
  distributed for its comfort nightly, and I have known even respectable
  teetotalers to pander to its depraved tastes, and provide it with the means
  of shocking intoxication in an old pie-dish provided with convenient
  ladders.</p>

  <p class="first">THE ELEPHANT, the various sorts of swine, the rhinoceros,
  and the hippopotamus&mdash;these are the pachydermata. Now, the elephant has
  had a Zig-zag to itself, and the pig shall have none of this Zig-zag;
  excellent reasons why now I speak only of the hippopotamus and rhinoceros. It
  is not easy to catch the hippopotamus at a moment of extravagant agility. To
  obtain lively sketches of the hippopotamus for the embellishment of these
  page, has been a task of long waiting, weary sitting, tiresome standing, much
  hanging about, hope deferred, heart-sickness, and final disappointment. Other
  animals baffle the artist by restless movement.</p>

  <p>Guy Fawkes, the big hippopotamus here, has an easier trick; she (this Guy
  is a she) lies perseveringly still. Iles was kind enough to suggest a shower
  of rain, because Guy has a way of getting up and strolling into the pond to
  get out of the wet. We had no influence with the rain, so had to wait for it.
  The rain came, and the wetting, but Guy Fawkes braved out the shower rather
  than serve the will of an artist. So that it is not possible in this place to
  gratify the public with authentic portraits of Guy Fawkes turning a
  somersault, or dancing a hornpipe, or walking on a tight-rope, or even riding
  on a bicycle.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag16-03.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration">

  <p>Still, the views which are possible have the undeniable merit of accuracy
  and architectural actuality. In the first place, standing on the path behind
  the paddock, we enjoy a view of the south elevation. Here the whole length of
  the edifice is visible in its simple grandeur. The architecture is of the
  manner of Vanbrugh on whom, it will be remembered the poet exhorted the earth
  to lie heavy, in retaliation for the heaviness of his buildings. Nothing of
  Vanbrugh's ever lay heavier per cubic foot on the groaning earth than Guy
  Fawkes lies here. I defy even a ghost to rise from the earth under Guy
  Fawkes.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag16-04.gif"

  <p>Let her but lie on it and she would extinguish a volcano and drive an
  earthquake discomfited away to some part where the earth's crust was less
  immovably suppressed. It is a humiliating thing in most cases to be sat upon,
  but when Guy Fawkes is the sitter, little room is left in the sittee for
  humility or any of the other virtues.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag16-05.gif"

  <p>The east view of the structure is obtained from near the gazelle sheds,
  and the view from the north (only a partial one, but still picturesque) you
  get from inside the house. If you can get into the ostrich paddock (you
  can't) you will have an opportunity of surveying the venerable pile from
  somewhere about west by south.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag16-06.gif"

  <p>This is a sort of end ele­vation, with a conspic­uous display of the west
  wing, if anything about a hippopotamus can be called a wing. Then you will
  bave seen and admired Guy Fawkes pretty well all round.</p>

  <p>The hippopotamus in general is admired for several causes. His (or her)
  mouth is indisputably the biggest extant, and has long been acknowledged to
  exceed even that of the Philanthropic Reformer, while his hide is almost as
  thick. His legs, although serviceable, are not altogether up to ballet form,
  but his chest measurement anybody might be proud of. Perhaps we love him
  most, though, as an old Londoner, although he has not been a familiar
  wanderer in the London streets since the tertiary epoch, which was some time
  ago. Again, in old time the hippopotamus was installed the symbol of impiety
  and ingratitude, which may account for a vast deal of
  popularity.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag16-07.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>His name, of course, is derived from the Greek <i>hippo</i> a horse, and
  <i>potamos</i> river; but he cannot be regarded as a very successful horse.
  Few people who admire a handsome Cleveland, with good knee-action, would, as
  a habit, harness him with a hippopotamus to a landau. The hippopotamus has no
  points; no more points, and no sharper ones, than a German sausage.</p>

  <p>Still, it cannot be too widely known that the hippopotamus does move
  sometimes. Even Guy Fawkes does, and some insignificant proportion of the
  visitors (about ¼ in 10,000, I believe) witness the feat. But even then she
  rarely does more than change her elevations&mdash;just brings her north
  elevation round south, for a change of air.</p>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"

  </div>

  <p>It is a grave and solemn rite, this turning about, and it proceeds with
  properly impressive deliberation. She rises by a mysterious process, in which
  legs seem to take no part; she anchors her face against the ground, as
  regarding her head in the light of a great weight (which it is) dumped down
  to prevent the rest of her being blown away by an unexpected zephyr. Then,
  with her weighty muzzle as pivot and centre, she executes a semi-circular
  manoeuvre suggestive of an attempt to kill time&mdash;rather, one might say,
  procrastinates herself round&mdash;until the north elevation faces south,
  when immediately she becomes a sausage again, turned about.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag16-09.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>All this is done with such perfect modesty that you immediately forget
  whether you saw her legs or not&mdash;indeed, whether she had any. As a
  matter of fact, I may here inform a doubtful public that Guy Fawkes
  <i>has</i> feet: her legs&mdash;if she has them&mdash;she, with propriety,
  veils in certain lashings of fat.</p>

  <div align="center">

  <p>Guy Fawkes was so called in defiance of her sex because she was born (here
  in the menagerie) on November 5th, 1872. Next door to Guy Fawkes lives
  Jupiter, who is only a small hippopotamus, some way from being fully grown.
  Jupiter, however, has ambitions. She admires and envies, beyond all things,
  the placid repose of Guy Fawkes. He does his best to imitate her. But as yet
  he is little more than a beginner&mdash;a mere amateur in inertia.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag16-11.gif"

  <p class="first">He is so inordinately proud of lying perfectly still for
  twenty minutes or so that he must look round for admiration, and spoil the
  effect at once. His mental attitude toward Guy Fawkes is that of the boy to
  Sidi Lakdar in Daudet's <i>La Figue et le Paresseux</i>&mdash;but Jupiter is
  far, very far, from being the equal of the boy in the noble craft of the
  <i>paresseux</i>. The fact is that Jupiter, in his ambition to become a
  creditable hippopotamus, an immobile vastness, a venerable pile, tries a
  little too much at once. Guy Fawkes, he considers, can smash anything earthly
  by lying on it, and herein he is right. Aspiring to the crushing power of Guy
  Fawkes, he is continually troubled by one or two hard iron knobby projections
  from the ground, which serve to keep the door of his den in place. Try as he
  will, these pieces of iron won't be suppressed; on the contrary, they
  discompose his surrounding atmosphere of fat&mdash;must reach, in fact, to
  within a very few feet of his ribs&mdash;and this is
  uncomfortable.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag16-12.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Still he pegs away, combining his attempt at the placidity of Guy Fawkes
  with that upon the obstinacy of the iron knobs. So that on the whole he does
  not succeed, comes as near perpetual motion as a hippopotamus may (about
  three moves an hour), and frequently betrays his possession of legs. He is
  never mistaken for a sausage, but presents the general appearance of a
  succession of cartloads of mud of varying shapes and designs. Jupiter,
  however, from his very perseverance, will get on, and some day, when full
  grown, he will take sausage rank and suppress earthquakes as well as Guy
  Fawkes. Then he will have north, south, east and west elevations, and,
  leaving behind the ignominy of resemblance to cartload of mud, became a
  Venerable Pile, and shroud his legs.</p>

  <p>There are times when neither Guy Fawkes nor Jupiter will condescend so far
  as to exhibit themselves architecturally; on careful scrutiny a broad
  nose-tip is observable, apparently floating on the surface of the pond. This
  is Guy Fawkes or Jupiter, as the case may be. Inexperienced sparrows,
  strangers to the place, have been known to alight on the small island thus
  presented, and to go away again immediately, doubtless to carry the report
  that the island was of an actively volcanic character.</p>

  <p>The hippopotamus has now been a familiar object in the Zoo for forty-three
  years, and the rhinoceros for longer; but still one hears occasionally the
  remarks (usually for the instruction of toddling youth) of worthy old ladies,
  who confuse the one with the other. It might conduce to the spread of more
  exact knowledge if an announcement of identity were painted in large white
  letters across the south elevation of Guy Fawkes. As it is, that most
  eligible advertising space is wasted completely.</p><img src=

        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"

  <p>The derivation of the name of the rhinoceros was once most intelli­gently
  explained by a showman exhibiting one. "This, ladies an' gents, is the
  cellerbrated rhinoserious&mdash;called rhino 'cos of is immense pecoonary
  value; called serious consekins o' bein' mentioned in 'Oly Writ." His points
  of difference from the hippopotamus are fairly obvious. Both have a good
  thick overcoat, certainly, but the hippopotamus, anxious for a good fit,
  fills all baggy spaces with fat, while the rhinoceros, preferring the free
  and easy appearance of a caped ulster, lets the garment hang in folds; not
  that the rhinoceros starves or wastes. Jim here, the older of the two Indian
  rhinoceroses (the other is Tom) measures more than twelve feet in girth, and,
  if eating will do anything, is certainly not decreasing. The feeding of the
  rhinoceros is a surprisingly thorough process. A few trusses of hay, a few of
  straw, a few of tares, a few biscuits and so on lie along one side of his
  sanctum. The biscuits go first, and then, beginning at one end of the hay, he
  eats his way through till he arrives at the straw, and through that to the
  tares.</p>

  <p>When these have all disappeared, he will proceed steadily to devour any
  broom, shovel, or bucket which may have been left in the place, and so eat
  his way through the furniture till his residence is absolutely bare. Then,
  after a careful inspection to assure himself of the surrounding emptiness, he
  will roll up to the bars and there stand with open mouth to receive
  whatsoever the visitors may choose to cast therein. Much investigation and
  many hours of careful thought I have devoted to an attempt to ascertain why
  he doesn't proceed to consume the house itself; but it remains a curious
  mystery. Possibly it may be because of a tacit understanding with Iles, the
  keeper, that in consideration of the reversion of all old brooms and stable
  utensils, the building shall remain uneaten. Tom, in particular, regards as
  an especial joy the privilege of browsing on a discarded broom.</p>

  <p>Jim, who has been here twenty-nine years, is a taciturn rhinoceros, who
  nevertheless likes company. Jack and Begum, the pair of smaller, hairy-eared
  rhinoceroses, are Jim's next-door neighbours. When Jim and his neighbours are
  out in their respective paddocks, Jim takes no notice of the others. But if
  only he be left in his paddock while Jack and Begum are within, he
  immediately yearns for company; goes, in fact, to the dividing railing and
  shouts for it aloud. This shout seems to be part of a game of "I-spy-I,"
  which Jim is trying to persuade Jack and Begum to indulge in. He may be
  standing perfectly quiet near his door when the impulse comes upon him. Then
  he trots out, shouts at the railing, runs furiously all round his paddock
  (with a noise as of a trotting troop of cavalry with loose accoutrements),
  and finally bounces "home" in triumph, and waits there for Jack and Begum to
  appear&mdash;defeated. If they do not come&mdash;usually they do not because
  the door is shut&mdash;he repeats his shout and run; if they happen to be let
  out, Jim promptly loses all interest in them. He yearns but for the
  absent.</p>

  <p>Jack and Begum are an extremely affable pair, most excellent and intimate
  friends of mine. You may go fearlessly and pat Begum&mdash;although she would
  prefer being fed. You may also pat Jack if he be near enough to the bars. If
  not, you may shut your eyes and pat a brick wall&mdash;it is just the same
  thing, if only you select a sufficiently rough wall.</p><img src=

  <p>I am sorry to have to report, as a result of careful observation, my
  conviction that Begum tyrannizes over her husband. They run a sort of circus,
  wherein Jack does the whole performance, while Begum per­sonally surrounds
  the entire receipts. For some cause of which I am ignorant, Jack always walks
  with a quaintly high-stepping action of the hind legs.</p><img src=
  "1500391h-images/ZigZag16-20.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>It was this, I am certain, that first suggested the circus to the
  financial genius of Begum. Jack solemnly goes through his high-stepping march
  round, by way of opening procession. He presents himself to various points of
  view, so as to give the spectators full measure for their contributions. Then
  he flounders into the water and gloomily clowns for the amusement of the
  vulgar. He goes through a series of rhinoceros trick-wading feats, finishing
  up by splashing over on his back, and spilling most of the pond.</p><img src=
  "1500391h-images/ZigZag16-21.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>That is the per­formance. It isn't a very great one, but it draws
  contributions of biscuits and buns, which Begum eats as fast as they accrue.
  As soon as the business is over, Jack rolls lugubriously into a corner and
  sits down to weep drips from the pond, with an expression of dismal
  recognition of the hollowness and mockery of all this glittering
  theatricality and sham gaiety. But Begun still goes round with the mouth.
  Jack never come to the rails for a share, feeling too deeply the vanity of
  mere earthly buns; also having long ago been convinced that it is his
  business to earn while the missis eats them.</p>

  <p>Jack and Begum have opposite opinions in the matter of
  Monday.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag16-22.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Monday is the sixpenny day, and Jack has to clown his hardest; while Begun
  collects a vast toll. Sometimes a bun has been thrown directly under Jack's
  muzzle, while Begum has been busy at the farther end of the paddock. Then
  Jack has gazed for a moment reproachfully at the thrower, as who would say:
  "My friend, you should know better than thus to cast temptation before a weak
  and erring rhinoceros"; then at the bun, as who would add: "Ah, a bun&mdash;a
  worldly bun. All buns is vanities. Nevertheless, lest peradventure some
  weaker vessel be tempted&mdash;perhaps even the missus&mdash;if I leave it
  there, I will proceed to surround it with what grace I may "; which he
  does.</p><br>

  <p>Tom, at the further end, is an excitable sort of rhinoceros. His
  fidgetiness has resulted in the almost complete rubbing away of his horn.
  This circumstance lays Tom open to a deal of slighting criticism from
  unzoological visitors. "'<i>E</i> ain't a rhinoceros!" they say; "Where's his
  horn?" And then, when convinced by the label&mdash;"Well, 'e ain't got a fine
  'orn like the other"&mdash;alluding to Jim. This annoys Tom, and, as
  trampling his enemies out flat is an impossibility, he turns about and sulks.
  He is no bad fellow though, on the whole, and it is just possible that he has
  rubbed down his horn to see ahead better. Tom is very fond of his
  pond&mdash;too fond. He gets excited and dashes his corners off against the
  sides, so that his allowance of bath has to be limited; otherwise he would
  kill more bluebottles. Tom has to take to the water to kill bluebottles.</p>

  <p>It costs a rhinoceros a great deal of valuable time to kill bluebottles by
  charging at them with his horns, and if he doesn't kill them they creep under
  the folds of his ulster and annoy him. Immersion in water crowds the
  bluebottles into a small space&mdash;about the ears. And with his ears Tom
  drowns bluebottles at an amazing rate.</p>

  <p class="first">NOW, the mustelidae are the weasels; and the badger is a
  weasel, improbable as it may seem, as also is the otter, the stoat, the
  polecat, the skunk, the glutton, the ratel, and many others. And since so
  many things are weasels&mdash;and to speak of many things at once is beyond
  my compass herein&mdash;those weasels only will I speak of that chiefly take
  the eye in the outer parts of house number twenty-seven; saying nothing of
  the glutton (though all weasels are gluttons, each in his way), nor of the
  polecat, nor the stoat, nor the skunk, nor the weasel that went
  pop.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag17-02.gif"

  <p>Every admirer of modesty should love the badger. So little he obtrudes
  himself that we are often assured that the badger (or the brock, as it is
  still called locally) is within a specimen or two of obliteration. But it is
  the brock's modesty that conceals his existence, for well he knows that, in
  his case, brock's display may not contribute much to brock's benefit; which
  words are an advertisement.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag17-03.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"

  <p class="first">Badger-draw­ing is a thing of the past, and rightly. But
  upon this page the drawing of a badger may now be seen without danger of
  interference from the police. He is the white badger, and is never easy to
  draw. His native objection to daylight overcomes his sense of duty to the
  public, and nothing will make him show himself, short of taking away all his
  straw. Raking away his coverlet only exposes him for a moment; he burrows
  again and vanishes. He has left his card on the wire, he argues, and that
  ought to satisfy any reasonable visitor.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag17-03.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"

  <p>Although, labelled as he is, "Common Badger," he may feel rather ashamed
  of that card. That is a notion that I can never get rid of. All over the
  Gardens various animals are insulted by the epithet "common." Then there are
  the "Stump-tail Lizard," the "Dusty Ichneumon," and the "Hairy-nosed Wombat,"
  not to mention the "Bottle-nosed Whale," that isn't here at all. Is man
  justified in so insulting his more virtuous fellow-creatures? Why should we
  show vulgar discourtesy even to a whale?</p>

  <p>The ratels, too, although not insulted in name, are grievously oppressed
  after the manner of David Copperffeld at Creakle's.</p><br>

  <p>"These animals bite" is the notice for ever fixed upon their cage. It
  gives rise to sad unpopularity, which the ratels can never mitigate, in the
  manner of David, with jam tarts and redcurrant wine. But more of this
  presently.</p>

  <p>Jack, the otter, in his big round cage, has his own particular affront to
  endure, none the less an affront because it is in Latin. <i>Lutra
  vulgaris</i> is the scientific name of Jack, but it is just as offensive to
  call an otter vulgar in Latin as in English.</p><img src=

        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>I can quite believe that it was this painted stigma of vulgarity that
  caused Jack to run away, some few years ago, and set up in the fish business
  on the Regent's Canal. It took some few days to persuade him to return, and
  the task of the persuaders was, I take it, none too easy. An otter is a rare
  good fighter, and there is trouble involved in bringing him home dead; but
  alive, he is a whirling tangle of teeth and claws, bad to handle. In any
  case, Jack is never vulgar. He is an epicure in the matter of fish, and an
  unerring connoisseur. Observe further the patrician disdain with which he
  regards the ignorant people who think to feed him with biscuits. It may be
  thought a vulgar taste that led him to start life afresh in the Regent's
  Canal, but where else could he go?</p>

  <p>But in all the house numbered twenty-seven there are no such favourites as
  the ratels. Why these have never been properly, officially, and individually
  given personal names I cannot understand.</p><img src=

  <p>I prefer to call them Edwin and Angelina, because they are always turning
  and turning; although to imagine Edwin a gentle hermit of the dale, or a
  gentle anything, is not easy. For Edwin bites, and hard, and so does
  Angelina. But then it is only their fun. I admire Edwin and Angelina because
  they keep up their spirits in most annoying circumstances.</p>

  <p>Those labels (there are two of them) informing everybody in capital
  letters that "<span class="smcap">These animals bite</span>," have a most
  remarkable effect on human visitors. They touch, in some occult way, a hidden
  and mysterious spring of human impulse. For no human creature (able to read)
  can see that label without at once repeating aloud, "These animals bite." It
  is a most astounding phenomenon. Watch by the wires, and you shall see. A
  family arrives, and immediately mother points to the label and says, "These
  animals bite." "Ugh!" says the eldest little girl, also looking at the label,
  "they bite!" "Look here," says the boy from school, "these fellows bite!"
  Nurse stoops and informs Toddles that these animals bite. Toddles looks up
  and replies "Dey bite!" with an air of imparting exclusive knowledge; and
  then the whole family subsides into a murmuring chorus, whereof the only
  distinct words are "They bite." And so they move off.</p>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>Then come old men, old women, young men, and young women, boys and girls,
  tinkers, tailors, soldiers, sailors, and the others. Each separately reads
  the label, and then assures all the others that these animals bite. Little
  Bobby strays from a family party, and reads that fatal label. He rushes back,
  breathless, to report that "these animals bite," and the whole family come
  pell-mell.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag17-10.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>They stand before the label and repeat the mystic formula to one another,
  and then move off, making way for others, who do the same thing. It is
  positively maddening. No wonder the ratels bite; the Archbishop of Canterbury
  would bite if you tortured him with that exasperating reiteration.</p>

  <p>As it is, the phrase must eat into the very being of Edwin and Angelina,
  and they seem to take their regular trot round to the eternal refrain,
  "These&mdash;animals&mdash;bite&mdash;these&mdash;animals&mdash;bite," always
  and for ever; Edwin introducing a small variation by a somersault each time
  as he reaches the narrow part of the cage, and Angelina by a jump against the
  wires. These perambulations are executed with a steady thoughtfulness that
  plainly indicates profound cogitation of some kind. If it is not the
  rhythmical repetition of the notice on the label, it is probably the
  conjugation of the verb: "I bite, thou bitest, he bites. We bite, you bite,
  they bite, I have bitten, thou hast bitten&mdash;" and so on, and so
  on.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag17-12.gif"
        style="float:left"

        title="Illustration">

  <p>Edwin and Angelina are really most deserving and persevering entertainers
  of the knock-about or Two Macs order, with a strong dash of the Brothers
  Griffiths. Angelina is best on the horizontal bar, and it is here that she
  retreats when at feeding time she has a tit-bit to which Edwin may take an
  independent fancy. The whole cage is well adapted for the performances of the
  ratels, and, substantially made as it is, anybody is perfectly justified in
  calling it a ratel-trap affair.</p>

        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">Edwin and Angelina much prefer their cage to liberty; at
  closed hours, when the keeper takes them out for a walk, they are inclined to
  crawl back behind the label that tells of their bites. They have a cement
  floor, so that they can no longer burrow underneath with a wild notion of
  coming out in some other part of the world, as they once did; and the drain
  is carefully covered in now, so that games of follow-my-leader therein, once
  their chief sport, are no longer practicable. But chiefly Edwin and Angelina
  live to revel in the pure delights of mutual assault and
  battery.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag17-16.gif"
        style="float:left"

        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Never is Angelina so happy as when she is joyously gnawing her Edwin's
  head, while his attention is concentrated on a gleeful attempt to drag the
  hide off her back.</p>

  <p>It is only from the inside of a skin as tough and elastic as the ratel's
  that tooth-and-nail combat can be properly enjoyed as a pastime. A ratel is
  just as fond of being bitten as of biting. It stimulates the healthy action
  of the skin, and doesn't hurt in the least. But a good hammering is also
  enjoyable. If Edwin and Angelina have been particularly good, no more
  acceptable reward can be offered them than the accidental leaving inside the
  cage of a pail. Then the devoted couple may fondle one another vigorously
  with that pail until it becomes a battered wisp of metal, and they feel
  bright and refreshed all over. Edwin and Angelina between them consume in a
  week sufficient personal violence to supply Cork political meetings for six
  months. With a little more hardening they might even come whole out of a
  football match.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag17-18.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>But even ratels have never ventured as far as football. A little infuriate
  devastation by way of amusement is all very well, but the ratel avoids
  extremes. Still, it is not easy to understand the necessity for that
  notice&mdash;"These animals bite." Nobody would think of disputing the
  fact.</p>

  <div align="center">

  </div>

  <p>They <i>are</i> biting all the time, more legibly than you can paint it on
  a label. If only they ate all they bit, Edwin would have become Angelina by
  gradual absorption and Angelina Edwin, long ago; then they would have become
  absorbed back again, and which would be which by this time nobody but an
  analytical chemist could calculate.</p>

  <p>Indeed, I have a theory that the breed of ratels has been evolved out of
  certain quarrelsome seals, monkeys, and Malayan bears, who all ate each other
  up entirely, and then attacked a shopful of ladies' muffs subsequently
  blossoming out in the guise of a medley of all the various antagonistic
  elements, to perform gymnastics and Two-Mac riots for the amusement of
  visitors to the Zoo; enacting also at times the instructive little sketch of
  "Bill Slogins and the Missis; or the Door on the Jar and the Family Jar on

  <p class="first">This is a Zig-Zag performed by Alice, one of the darters
  that live at the end of the fish-house&mdash;for it is in accordance with the
  general zig-zaggedness of things that the most popular residents in the
  fish-house are the birds. The diving birds are penguins, shags, and darters,
  and the darters are Jack and Alice. Many may remember the famous ballad
  beginning&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"Keeper may I go in to fish?"<br>
  "Oh, yes, my own fair darter!"</p>

  <p class="first">although probably they won't. The darter therein referred to
  is popularly supposed to have been Alice. It is probably because of her name
  that Alice had this remarkable dream, although Waterman (which is the name of
  the keeper&mdash;a man evidently born for the fish-house) thinks it was
  because of swallowing Jack's dinner as well as her own. Alice certainly had
  done very well&mdash;she always does&mdash;and was well disposed for sleep.
  Jack went quietly and respectably home to his cage, but Alice stayed on the
  diving-board, dozing. Waterman reached for her with the net, and for a moment
  aroused her senses by the display of a roach, but Alice remembered that she
  was loaded to the sinking-line already, and forbore. Waterman was called
  away, and Alice slept.</p>

  <div align="center">

        title="Illustration">

  <p>Now as Alice slept she dreamed. And it was this. In the water below her
  (where she knew she had left nothing living larger than the natural
  animalcula) there appeared, moving towards her, a double row of great
  phosphorescent fishy eyes. Then between each pair of steadily upturned eyes
  she saw, as is usual, a nose. Then below the nose a pale, ghastly, half-open
  mouth. It was shuddersome. Alice had never before seen any fish that she did
  not welcome gladly and take inside with promptitude. But these fish, all with
  their noses pointing upward and their unnaturally large eyes fixed upon
  her&mdash;these she knew at once, by instinct, were not to be eaten. There is
  no record, even in the transactions of the Psychical Research Society, of an
  edible ghost. These awful-eyed fish passed beneath the diving-board on which
  she stood, and, strangely enough, Alice could see their eyes as plainly after
  they had passed out of sight as before.</p>

    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag18-04.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>Then a weird, mysterious sound gathered about her, intensifying into a
  loud wail&mdash;the wail of many hundreds of fishy spirits repeating the
  words of the mystic inscription over the tank: "The diving birds are fed at
  twelve and three p.m."</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag18-05.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Thus was the case made plain to Alice. These were the avenging
  spirits&mdash;the phantoms of hundreds of fish eaten and forgotten;
  reproachful roach and minatory minnows. Alice could not speak&mdash;it would
  have been impossible to deny the charge if she could, for the words were
  painted on a board in such large letters that nobody could doubt their truth.
  Suddenly each wing was taken in a clammy but firm grasp, and a pair of
  greater eyes than ever appeared at each side of her. "You're wanted, young
  person," said a gruff voice at one side, and "Better come quietly!" said
  another, on the opposite side. "Never you mind wot for," pursued the first
  voice, as though Alice had asked, which she hadn't; "you'll find that out
  soon enough at the station." And "It's our dooty to warn you," added the
  second voice, "that anything you say 'll be took down as evidence ag'in you."
  "All right," Alice replied, with a conciliatory flutter, "I won't say
  anything." "Says she won't say anything," remarked the second voice, "take
  that down; it's important."</p>

  <p>All this time they were moving serenely along through the glass, the
  frames of the cases and the walls of the house, into the black shed of doom
  at the back where none but keepers go and the fated fish that feed the diving
  birds. "You're remanded here," Alice's left-hand captor informed her, "till
  the sessions." "But I haven't been charged yet," protested Alice. "Charged?
  O' course not," returned the policeman&mdash;he was barbel&mdash;"we don't
  charge you nothing for this; but it's dry work here swimming through deal
  doors, and a drop o' something short now&mdash;" "Look here," said Alice, as
  an idea struck her, "can't this be squared?" "No," answered the barbel,
  gloomily, "you can't square a ghost, you know; everything drops through his
  pockets. That's the worst of being a ghost. Take down that she tried to
  square us," he added to his mate; "it's scandalous." Nothing was taken down,
  however, and Alice wondered whether either had been to one of the school of
  fish she had heard of. "Look here," said the barbel, "I know what you're
  thinking about&mdash;schools; board schools, because you used to board on
  them. Ah, you've been a bad darter. But you mustn't think. It isn't
  allowed."</p>

  <p>Alice sat on the corner of the bench near the largest tank of fish and
  shuddered; for now there were more ghosts than ever, and one came close to
  her ear and made an awful pun about this being her last perch.</p>

  <div align="center">

  <p>She had often wondered what was really the worst thing a ghost could do to
  anyone, and now she knew and trembled. Presently she was whisked up and
  rushed bodily through the walls again to the godwit's cage, where a public
  meeting of fish was taking place in a hole in the grotto. A good many birds
  were waiting about outside to hear the result of the meeting, which, it
  seemed, was all over except the election of the chairman, which had been
  forgotten at the beginning, and was now being settled by a raffle. Presently
  a fine trout came swimming down through the air. Alice recognised him at once
  as the largest trout in the tank near the door. "Halloa," said the trout,
  "you're the prisoner, aren't you? I'm the scene-shifter&mdash;always looking
  after the flies, you know. Never hear of trout-flies? See this scene shift."
  Immediately Alice felt her wings grasped again, and something pulled her feet
  backward from under her. She was blinded for a few seconds, during which she
  felt herself hurriedly dragged the length of the fish-house. When she was set
  upon her feet and looked about she found that the place was fitted as a court
  of justice. "Ah!" said the trout in her ear, "that's something like a system
  of scene-shifting; a little invention of my own. You shift the
  spectator&mdash;saves lots of trouble. System extensively adopted by the
  police."</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag18-08.gif"

  <p>Alice was standing in the dock. One of the piker was judge&mdash;the big
  pike from the end tank. The jury were packed&mdash;very tightly&mdash;in a
  box on the left. Alice wondered whether it might put the Court in a good
  humour to refer to it casually as the sardine-box, but decided to save the
  idea for an emergency. The judge looked severely about him, and from time to
  time snapped his jaws sharply, at which all the jury jumped nervously.
  Presently the judge snapped very loudly and asked, "What's the charge?" At
  this the bullhead appeared dragging a board, which he displayed. It was the
  board from above the tank. On it were inscribed the words&mdash;"The Diving
  Birds are fed at twelve and three p.m." "Oh, that's the charge, is it?" said
  the judge in a loud voice. "And pray, sir, who are you?" "I'm the bullhead,
  me lud," replied that unfortunate, very frightened. "I am for the
  prosecution." "Then what do you mean, sir, by coming into court with no
  horns?" "Beg your pardon, me lud," quavered the bullhead, "but I've got
  none&mdash;none of us have." "What, no horns?" said the judge. "I humbly
  apologize," replied the bullhead, trembling all over. "Don't argue, sir,"
  roared the judge, savagely "come to lunch with me!" At which invitation the
  unlucky bullhead fainted away, and all the other fish tried to look as if
  they thought it served him right.</p>

  <p>"Now there'll be no speech for the prosecution," said the judge, "and
  that'll save time. And there'll be nobody to call witnesses for the
  prosecution, and that'll save time too. There's too much of this dilatory
  legal formality, delaying meals. Where's the evidence of arrest?" At this a
  carp stepped into the witness-box. "Well, constable," asked the judge, "did
  you arrest the prisoner?" "No, yer ludship," said the carp. "Is that what
  you've come to prove?" "Yus, yer ludship," responded the carp. "Oh, I see,"
  said the pike, "the plan will be to call everybody who <i>didn't</i> arrest
  her, so as to make quite sure of that first?" His lordship seemed amused.</p>

  <p>"Jest so, yer ludship," answered the carp.</p>

  <p>"That'll be rather slow," said the judge, "and I want my lunch soon. Would
  <i>you</i> like to come to lunch with me?" His lordship looked more amused
  than ever, but the carp turned pale and gasped. "Because, you know," the
  judge pursued, "if you <i>wouldn't</i>, you'd better say who <i>did</i>
  arrest the prisoner, and save time."</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag18-11.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>"Ghosts, me lud, ghosts!" ejaculated the carp; "we can't call
  'em&mdash;they're ghosts. We can't call ghosts from the nasty deep, me lud."
  "No, no, of course not, my poor fellow," replied the judge, soothingly; "of
  course not. You're a most intelligent carp, and I'm delighted to have met
  you. Just come to lunch with me to-day, will you?"</p>

  <p>At this the carp gave a despairing cry and fell out of the witness-box. "I
  wonder why they don't like lunching with the judge!" Alice thought.
  "Somebody's thinking in court," shouted the pike, excitedly. "I won't have
  it. The next person who thinks, I'll commit to my lunch for contempt of
  Court."</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag18-12.gif"

  <p>Then Alice thought she knew why nobody liked to be present at the judge's
  lunch. At this moment Mike, the penguin, came waddling into Court as fast as
  he could in a wig and gown and wiping his beak on his sleeve. "Hope I haven't
  kept the Court waiting, me lud," said Mike, "but I've only just been called
  to the bar. The barmaid said&mdash;" "Stop!" said the judge, "is the barmaid
  here?" "No, me lud, in the next pond&mdash;Spiers and Pond." The judge looked
  disappointed. "Ah! hum!" he said, "um&mdash;not here; well, who said she was?
  Proceed." "I appear in this case, me lud." "Well, who for?" asked the pike.
  "I don't care, me lud," said the penguin, "suppose we say the prisoner?" "All
  right," replied the pike, "be quick."</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag18-13.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>"Me lud," began Mike, with a bow, "and gentlemen of the jury," (with
  another) "in the whole course of my professional experience I have never
  approached any case whatever, having, unfortunately, been too frequently
  called to the bar. The barmaid always&mdash;but that is another story.
  Unaccustomed as I am to public-hou&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;public speaking,
  I feel, me lud, that on this occasion if I failed to plead the cause of my
  unfortunate client with all my force and all my strength and all my power,
  that I&mdash;in fact, that I should not succeed in bringing these various
  qualities into requisition in this particular case. Me lud, my client is
  charged with being fed at twelve and three. I fail, me lud, to see the
  gravity of this charge. I am authorized to say that my client will gladly
  consent to be fed on as many more occasions as the Court may consider proper.
  As to the few trifling murders involved, that, my lud, I contend is a matter
  too small for the consideration of this Court. Murder, as we all know, is a
  small failing practised by the most honourable birds and fish every day. Even
  your ludship yourself has lunch. The same hand that ministers unto my
  unfortunate client at twelve and three provides lunch, me lud and gentlemen
  of the jury, for all of us. What! did you never see the keeper? Did you never
  hear of a jolly young Waterman? Me lud and gentlemen, you with
  darters&mdash;'erring darters, I may say&mdash;of your own, I&mdash;I throw
  myself upon&mdash;upon the nearest chair, and implore you to remember the
  temptation to which my client has been subjected, and how pleasant you would
  be fried yourselves."</p>

  <p class="first">The penguin, pulling out an immense handkerchief, flung
  himself on a chair where the grey mullet had placed a bent pin. Rising again
  immediately, and dropping his handkerchief, the penguin put the grey mullet
  into his pocket and said: "Call the godwit."</p>

  <p>The godwit hopped into the witness-box and stood on one leg. "Be careful,
  sir," said the pike, sternly. "Hold u your head, and don't stand on one leg.
  It's insolent!" The godwit immediately put down his other foot and
  straightened up. "I have heard," said the penguin, "of people coming into
  court without a leg to stand on." At this a gudgeon laughed, and was
  immediately taken into custody for the judge's lunch. "Now then, sir," said
  the judge to the godwit, "tell us what you know." "I don't know anything,"
  said the godwit; "it saves so much trouble." "Did you ever see the prisoner
  committing murders at twelve and three?" asked the penguin. "No, never!" "Why
  was that?" "Because the centre tanks were in the way," answered the godwit,
  "and I couldn't see her at all." "There, me lud," cried the penguin,
  triumphantly; "here is an irreproachable witness who didn't see the crime;
  what do you ask more than that? Further, there is proof that he couldn't have
  seen it. I have any number of witnesses to testify the same thing. Call the
  avocet."</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag18-17.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">"Call the <i>what?</i>" said the usher, very loudly. He was
  deaf, and a flounder. "Call the <i>what?</i>"</p><img src=

        title="Illustration">

  <p>"Never mind," said the penguin. "That ain't what you said before," roared
  the usher; "don't you go playin' jokes on me." The avocet was already in the
  witness-box behind the usher, and while the penguin and the flounder shouted
  at one another the judge suddenly leaned over and snapped the witness up. He
  sank back in his chair placidly munching the avocet, while the jury, who had
  been attempting to unlock their box and sneak away before the pike's
  lunch-time, all stared with such hushed astonishment that the cod-sounds (the
  foreman was a cod) could be heard distinctly all over the court.</p>

  <p>When at last the avocet's legs had finally vanished, the judge, leaning
  back complacently, said, "I don't think we'll wait for that witness; he seems
  to have disappeared. Hope nothing's happened to him."</p><img src=

  <p>"Call the thunder-fish," said the penguin. Everybody drew aside and
  prepared to make way for something tremendous. "Here I am," said a very small
  voice in court, and a fish about four inches long wriggled shyly into the
  box. "Tell the jury what you know of the case," said the
  penguin.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag18-20.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>"The case? Oh, yes&mdash;the case," the thunder-fish replied, nervously;
  "it's a very good case, I'm sure. Glass sides and an iron frame; I've nothing
  to complain of in the case, except that sometimes one runs his nose against
  the glass without thinking. I <i>have</i> heard it called an aquarium. But,
  then&mdash;"</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag18-21.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>"What do they call you a thunder-fish for, you wretched tittlebat?"
  demanded the judge. "I don't know, I'm sure," answered the thunder-fish,
  meekly, "unless it's because it's easy to spell on the label; some ain't."
  "Oh!" said the pike, and swallowed the thunder-fish. "I was going to invite
  that witness to lunch with me," he went on, after a pause, "but I shan't
  now."</p>

  <p>Bill, the shag, was called, and examined by the penguin. "How are you?"
  "Pretty bobbish." Here a voice from the gallery cried "Bobbish! why, you
  ain't got a bob in the world; you're only threepence an ounce."</p>

  <div align="center">

        title="Illustration">

  <p>"Who is that person?" asked the judge, angrily. "That's the tittlebat,"
  said the usher; "if I hadn't got both eyes on one side of my head, I
  shouldn't have seen him." "Here, come," protested the tittlebat,
  "<i>you're</i> not a whale, you know. I may be a tittlebat now, but I have
  been whitebait&mdash;shall be again soon." "Ah!" mumbled the flounder to
  himself, "sometimes I'm a sole!" "If it hadn't been the tittlebat," said the
  pike, "I'd invite him to lunch for his disrespect. But it's no use asking
  tittlebats to lunch&mdash;you're as hungry as ever afterwards. That's why
  he's impudent."</p>

  <p>The penguin resumed the examination. "You are a diving bird of some
  experience yourself," he said. "Now tell me how often are you fed?" "Often?"
  replied the shag, with contempt; "it ain't often; it's only twice a day. Call
  that often?"</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag18-24.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Here the judge interposed. "Let's have the verdict now," he said, "and
  then there will be more time for lunch. If this is a good witness you can
  call him some other time, you know&mdash;in another case." Then, turning to
  the jury, he snapped, "What's your verdict?"</p><img src=

        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"

  <p>The jury trembled and tried to hide behind each other. "We&mdash;we'll
  think about it, me lud," said the foreman. "What!" cried the judge,
  excitedly; "think in this court? I won't have it&mdash;it's disrespectful.
  Anybody caught thinking will be committed to my lunch for contempt of Court.
  I won't have it." Whereupon he immediately fell asleep.</p>

  <p>"Well, your ludship," said the foreman, "as we mustn't think, and there's
  only two notice-boards in the house, and one was used for the charge, we
  shall have to use the other for the verdict. 'Beware of Pickpockets,' me
  lud." But the pike snored on, and so did Alice.</p>

  <p class="first">THE frog and the toad suffer, in this world of injustice,
  from a deprival of the respect and esteem that is certainly their due. In the
  case of the frog this may be due largely to the animal's headlong and
  harlequin-like character, but the toad is a steady personage, whose solemnity
  of deportment, not to speak of his stoutness, entitles him to high
  consideration in a world where grave dulness and personal circumference
  always attract reverence.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag19-02.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The opening lines of a certain famous poem have without a doubt done much
  to damage the dignity of the frog. "The frog he would a-wooing go" is not,
  perhaps, disrespectful, although flippant; but "whether his mother would let
  him or no" is a gross insult. Of course, it is a matter upon which no
  self-respecting frog ever consults his mother; but the absurd jingle is
  immortal, and the frog's dignity suffers by it. Then there is a certain
  pot-bellied smugness of appearance about the frog that provokes a smile in
  the irreverent. Still, the frog has received some consideration in his time.
  The great Homer himself did not disdain to sing the mighty battle of the
  frogs and mice; and Aristophanes gave the frogs a most important chorus in
  one of his comedies; moreover, calling the whole comedy "The Frogs," although
  he had his choice of title-names among many very notable
  characters&mdash;Aeschylus, Euripides, Bacchus, Pluto, Proserpine, and other
  leaders of society.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag19-03.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Still, in every way the frog and the toad are underesteemed&mdash;as
  though such a thing as a worthy family frog or an honourable toad of business
  were in Nature impossible. It is not as though they were useless. The frog's
  hind legs make an excellent dish for those who like it, as well as a joke for
  those who don't. Powdered toad held in the palm is a fine thing to stop the
  nose bleeding&mdash;or, at any rate, it was a couple of hundred years ago,
  according to a dear old almanac I have.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag19-04.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>On the same unimpeachable authority I may fearlessly affirm a smashed
  frog&mdash;smashed on the proper saint's day&mdash;in conjunction with hair
  taken from a ram's forehead and a nail stolen from a piebald mare's shoe, to
  be a certain remedy for ague, worn in a little leather bag. If it fails it
  will be because the moon was in the wrong quarter, or the mare was not
  sufficiently piebald, or the nail was not stolen with sufficient dishonesty,
  or some mistake of that sort.</p>

  <p>Personally, I am rather fond of frogs and toads. This, of course, in a
  strictly platonic sense, and entirely apart from dinner.</p><img src=

        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">A toad I admire even more than a frog, be­cause of his
  gentle­manly calm. He never rushes at his food ravenously, as do so many
  other creatures. Place a worm near him and you will see. He inspects the worm
  casually, first with one eye and then with the other, as who would say:
  "Luncheon? Certainly. Delighted, I'm sure." Then he sits placidly awhile, as
  though thinking of something else altogether. Presently he rises slightly on
  his feet and looks a little&mdash;very little&mdash;more attentively at the
  worm. "Oh, yes," he is saying&mdash;"luncheon, of course. Whenever you like,
  you know." And he becomes placid again, as though interested in the general
  conversation.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag19-06.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>After a little he suddenly straightens his hind legs and bends down over
  the worm, like a man saying, "Ah, and what have we got here now? Oh,
  worm&mdash;<i>ver au naturel</i>&mdash;capital, capital!" After this there is
  nothing to do but to eat, and this the toad does without the smallest delay.
  For leisurely indifference, followed by a business-like grab, nothing can
  beat a toad. Almost before the cover is lifted, figuratively speaking, the
  worm's head and tail are wriggling, like a lively moustache, out of the sides
  of the toad's mouth.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag19-07.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>The head and tail he gently pats in with his hands, and there is no longer
  any worm; after which the toad smiles affably and comfortably, possibly
  meditating a liqueur. I have an especial regard for the giant toad in one of
  the cases against the inner wall of the reptile-house lobby. There is a
  pimpliness of countenance and a comfortable capaciousness of waistcoat about
  him that always make me wonder what he has done with his churchwarden and
  pewter. He has a serene, confidential, well-old-pal-how-are-you way of
  regarding Tyrrell, his keeper. Of late (for some few months, that is) the
  giant toad has been turning something over in his mind, as one may perceive
  from his cogitative demeanour. He is thinking, I am convinced, of the new
  Goliath Beetle. The Goliath Beetle, he is thinking, would make rather a fit
  supper for the Giant Toad. This because he has never seen the beetle. His
  mind might be set at rest by an introduction to Goliath, but the
  acquaintanceship would do no good to the beetle's morals. At present Goliath
  is a most exemplary vegetarian and tea-drinker, but evil communications with
  that pimply, dissipated toad would wreck his principles.</p><img src=

  <p>Why one should speak of the Adorned Ceratophrys when the thing might just
  as well be called the Barking Frog, I don't know.</p><img src=
  "1500391h-images/ZigZag19-09.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"

  <p class="first">Let us compromise and call him the Ad­orned C., in the
  man­ner of Mr. Wemmick. I respect the Adorned C. almost as much as if he were
  a toad instead of a frog, but chiefly I admire his mouth. A crocodile has a
  very respectable mouth&mdash;when it separates its jaws it opens its head.
  But when the Adorned C. smiles he opens out his entire anatomical bag of
  tricks&mdash; comes as near bisecting himself indeed as may be; opens, in
  short, like a Gladstone bag.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag19-10.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>From a fat person, of course, you expect a broad, genial smile; but you
  are doubly gratified when you find it extending all round him. That, you
  feel, is indeed no end of a smile&mdash;and that is the smile of the Adorned
  C.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag19-11.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">But, notwithstanding this smile, the Ad­orned C. is short of
  temper. Indeed, you may only make him bark by practising upon this fact.
  Tyrrell's private performance with the Adorned C. is one that irresistibly
  reminds the spectator of Lieutenant Cole's with his figures, and would
  scarcely be improved by ventriloquism itself.</p><img src=
  "1500391h-images/ZigZag19-12.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The Adorned C. prefers biting to barking, and his bite is worse than his
  bark&mdash;bites always are, except in the proverb. This is why Tyrrell holds
  the Adorned C. pretty tight whenever he touches him. The one aspiration of
  the Adorned C. is for a quiet life, and he defends his aspiration with bites
  and barks. Tyrrell touches him gently, cautiously, and repeatedly on the back
  until the annoyance is no longer to be tolerated, and then the Adorned C.
  duly barks like a terrier. Now, the most interesting thing about the Adorned
  C., after his mouth, is his bark, and why he should be reluctant to exhibit
  it except under pressure of irritation&mdash;why he should hide his light
  under a bushel of ill-temper&mdash;I can't conceive.</p>

  <p class="first">If you rejoice in the sight of a really happy, contented
  frog, you should stand long before White's Green Frog, and study his smile.
  No other frog has a smile like this; some are wider, perhaps, but that is
  nothing. A frog is ordained by Nature to smile much, but the smile seems
  common­ly one of hunger merely, though often one of stomach-ache. White's
  Green Frog smiles broad content and placid felicity. Maintained in comfort,
  with no necessity to earn his living, this is probably natural; still, the
  bison enjoys the same advantages, although nobody ever saw him smile; but,
  then, an animal soon to become extinct can scarcely be expected to
  smile.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag19-23.gif"

        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">In the smile of White's Green Frog, however, I fear, a
  certain smug, Peck­sniffian quali­ty is visible. "I am a Numble individual,
  my Christian friends," he seems to say, "and my wants, which are few and
  simple, are providenti­ally supplied. There­fore, I am Truly Happy.</p><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>It is no great merit in my merely batra­chian na­ture that I am Truly
  Happy; a cheerful counten­ance, my friends, is a duty imposed on me by an
  indulgent Providence." White's Green Frog may, how­ever, be in reality a frog
  of excellent moral worth: and I trust that Green's White Frog, if ever he is
  discovered, will be a moral frog too.</p>

  <p>By-the-bye, some green frogs are blue. That is to say, individuals of the
  green species have been found of the skyey colour and sold at a good price as
  rarities. When it was not easy to find one already blue, the prudent
  tradesman kept a green frog in a blue glass vase for a few weeks, and brought
  it out as blue as you might wish.</p>

  <p>The colour stayed long enough, as a rule, to admit of sale at a decent
  price, but was liable to fade after.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag19-27.gif"

  <p class="first">As I think I have said, the toad is distinguished by a
  placid calm denied to the frog; therefore it is singular that the ordinary
  toad's Latin name should be <i>Bufo vulgaris</i>&mdash;a name suggestive of
  nothing so much as a low&mdash;disgrace­fully low&mdash;comedian. <i>Bufo
  vulgaris</i> should be the name of a very inferior, rowdy clown. The frog is
  a much nearer approximation to this character than the toad. The frog comes
  headlong with a bound, a bunch of legs and arms, with his "Here we are again!
  Fine day to-morrow, wasn't it?" and goes off with another bound, before the
  toad, who is gravely analyzing the metaphysical aspect of nothing in
  particular, can open his eyes to look up.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>The toad has one comic act, however, of infinitely greater humour than the
  bouncing buffooneries of the frog. When the toad casts his skin he quietly
  rolls it up over his back and head, just as a man skins off a close-fitting
  jersey. Once having drawn it well over his nose, however, he immediately
  proceeds to cram it down his throat with both hands, and so it finally
  disappears. Now, this is a performance of genuine and grotesque humour, which
  it is worth keeping a toad to see.</p>

  <h2><a id="story20"
     name="story20"></a>XX. &mdash; ZIG-ZAG DASYPIDIAN</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, February 1894</h3>

  <div align="center">

  </div><br>

  <p class="first">THE DASYPIDAE are not such fearful wild-fowl as their name
  may seem to indicate; for the name Dasypus is nothing but the scientific
  naturalist's innocent little Greek way of saying "hairy-foot." The Sloth, the
  Scaly Manis, the Armadillo, the Platypus, the Aard-Vark, the Anteater, and
  one or two more comprise the family, presenting the appearance of a job-lot
  of odds and ends at the tail of an auctioneer's catalogue. Not only is the
  family of a job-lot nature, but each individual seems a sort of haphazard
  assemblage of odd parts made up together to save wasting the pieces; for some
  have tremendous tails, and some have almost none; some have armour and some
  have hair; one has an odd beak, apparently discarded by a duck as awkwardly
  shaped; some have two toes only on a foot, some three, some four, and some
  five&mdash;just as luck might have it in the scramble, so to speak; they only
  agree in being all very hard up for teeth.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag20-02.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The sloth is an admirable creature in many respects. Chiefly, he has a
  glorious gift of inaction&mdash;a thing too little esteemed and
  insufficiently cultivated in these times. If it is sweet to do nothing, as we
  have it on the unimpeachable authority of a proverb, therefore it must be
  actually noble to do nothing on scientific principles, as does the
  sloth.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag20-03.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The objectionably moral and energetic class of philosopher is always ready
  to enlist the ant, the bee, and similarly absurdly busy creatures as
  practical sermons on his side; and that the indolent Philosopher has never
  retaliated with the sloth is due merely to the fact that he <i>is</i>
  indolent, practically as well as theoretically. Yet the sloth has
  well-esteemed relations. Consider other proverbs. "Sloth," says one, "is the
  mother of necessity." Then another. "Necessity," says this second, "is the
  mother of invention." Whence it plainly follows that sloth is invention's
  grand­mother&mdash;although nobody would think it to look at the sloth here,
  in house number forty-seven.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag20-04.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Now there are persons who attempt to deprive the sloth of the credit due
  to his laziness by explaining that his limbs are not adapted for use on the
  ground. This is a fact, although it is mean to use it to discredit so fine a
  reputation. The sloth is indeed a deal more active when he is hanging upside
  down by his toes&mdash;but then that is all a part of his system, since it is
  plain that his greatest state of activity is merely one of suspended
  animation. It is only when he is in a state of suspense that the sloth is
  really happy, and this is only one aspect of the topsy-turviness of his
  entire nature. Hanging horizontally, head and tail downward, is his normal
  position in society, and this is apt to lead to a belief among the unthinking
  that he must have lived long in Australia and there become thoroughly used to
  holding on to the world in his usual attitude; but his actual home is Central
  and South America&mdash;not altogether "down under," but merely on the
  slope.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag20-05.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The sloth in this place is, in the eyes of most visitors, a mere mop in a
  heap of straw. Let but the keeper stir him up and he reveals himself
  gradually, the picture of a ragged, rascally mendicant&mdash;a dirty ruffian
  whose vocation can be nothing more laborious than extorting coppers on
  pretence of sweeping a crossing. A little more stirring, and he will reach
  for his perch and invert himself, to think things over. To him the floor is
  inconvenient, for it is his ceiling; anybody's ceiling is inconvenient to
  crawl about on.</p>

  <p>When one knows that the sloth never drinks, one is prepared to believe
  that he persistently refuses to stand; but then nobody can stand anything,
  even drinks, on a ceiling.</p>

  <p>If by any chance he finds himself on the ceiling (which, as I have said,
  is his word for floor), he can only hook his claws wherever he sees a hole,
  and drag himself. He is the poorest of all the Dasypidae in the matter of
  tail, and was also unfortunate in the allotment of toes, only wearing two on
  each fore-foot. Which disposes of the sloth.</p><img src=
  "1500391h-images/ZigZag20-06.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Of the Dasypidae there are only, beside the sloth, various armadillos and
  an ant-eater in this place. The armadillo is a placid creature, with none of
  the warlike disposition that its armour might lead some to expect. Mild and
  placable, as well as rather bashful, it has somewhat the character of a
  beplated and armed theatrical super, who play the flute and teaches in a
  Sunday-school when off duty. It is susceptible to cold, too, and regardless
  of any heroism of appearance in face of a chill in the air. Withal the
  armadillo is indifferent alike to flattery and abuse: you can no more hurt
  his feelings than his back.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag20-07.gif"
         alt="Illustration"

        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>There are several sorts of armadillo here, but all are equally indifferent
  to criticism. Nothing is more impervious to criticism (or anything else, if
  you come to that) than an armadillo. He should have been born a minor poet.
  An oyster appears to care very little for what is said of him, but a good
  deal of his indifference is assumed; you often catch him opening his shell to
  listen. The armadillo won't open his shell for anything&mdash;figuratively as
  well as literally speaking.</p>

  <p>If a raging mad jaguar prances up to an armadillo, the armadillo curls up
  quietly with an expression that says: "Really, you excite yourself overmuch;
  I suppose you want to gnaw me. If you expect to <i>eat</i> me, after your
  length of experience, you must be&mdash;well, rather a fool, if I may say so.
  I shall go to sleep," which he does, while the jaguar ruins his teeth.</p>

  <p>Naturalists have marvelled at the fact that native Paraguayans find
  whether an armadillo is at home by poking a stick into his burrow, when (if
  he is) out comes a swarm of mosquitoes. "What," they ask, wonderingly, "can
  mosquitoes want with an armadillo, when other things not quite so hopeless
  are near at hand for biting?" But it is probably a mosquito championship
  meeting.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag20-09.gif"
        style="float:left"

  <p>The sloth, sluggard as he is, has not gone to the ant, but to the
  ant-eater; that is to ay, his cage is not far from Sukey's here. Sukey is not
  a wise person. Nobody anxious to be an orator with so little talent for it
  can be wise. When first you enter the room you observe that Sukey is anxious
  to address a large meeting.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag20-10.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"

  <p>She has a ledge before her, on which she rests her fore-knuckles in a
  manner so extremely suggestive of a lecture that you instinctively look for
  the customary carafe and glass, and feel perplexed at their absence.
  Regardless of this disadvantage, Sukey will turn this way and that, and thump
  alternately with one fist and the other, and even, in the excitement of her
  eloquence, bounce bodily upon the ledge before her, as one has heard of a
  gymnastic American divine doing in his pulpit.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag20-11.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>This will the voiceless Sukey do till public indifference disgusts her,
  and she flops heavily back on her knuckles into hinder retirement. But no
  failure can stifle her ambition, whether it be actually for oratorical
  distinction, as appearances indicate, or only for such cockroaches as you may
  choose to offer her, as the keeper believes.</p>

  <div align="center">

        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">Sukey is not an impressive person&mdash;her features are
  against it. She is not equal to assuming a presence. With all her wealth of
  nose, she can't turn it up at anybody. Her sneer is a wretched failure. Any
  attempt at an imposing attitude is worse; a large nose of a sort is often a
  noble feature of itself; but a nose like this!...Sukey's extravagance in nose
  is paid for by a scarcity of mouth. Her small mouth may be a loveliness in
  itself, but it will never allow Sukey a sneer or a smile&mdash;let alone a
  laugh; it condemns her to perpetual prunes and prism, so that Sukey may
  neither impress you by a haughty presence, nor sneer at you, nor laugh at
  you; one thing only remains&mdash;and it is a low expedient&mdash;she
  <i>can</i> put out her tongue at you&mdash;by the yard.</p><img src=

        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>I have often speculated as to how much of this tongue Sukey really has
  stowed away inside her, and what would happen if she let it all out at once.
  It would probably get entangled with everything and with itself, like a ball
  of string cast loose, and Mansbridge (who is Sukey's keeper) would spend an
  afternoon unfastening all the knots.</p><br>
  <br>

        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">One has to see Sukey many times before the lineal
  possibili­ties of her tongue begin to dawn on one. See her once or twice
  only, and she may only exhibit a mere foot or so of it&mdash;possibly only
  eight or ten inches. Another time she will let out a foot or eighteen inches
  more, and you are rather surprised; still your belief is unshaken that there
  <i>is</i> another end to that tongue somewhere. But when, some time later,
  she casually releases another yard or two, beyond the few feet wherewith you
  are familiar, with an aspect of keeping miles more in reserve, you abandon
  the doctrine of the finiteness of things earthly as mere scientific
  superstition.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag20-18.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>Plainly, I don't believe there is any other end to Sukey's tongue. It has
  the redeeming feature, however, of possessing <i>one</i> end, which anybody
  may see; and as there is an end to Sukey's tongue we won't be too hard on
  her, remembering that there have been Sukeys&mdash;well, differently provided
  for.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag20-19.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Sukey's tongue is a sticky thing, and she waves it about with a view of
  eating any unfortunate insect that may adhere to it, on the
  catch-'em-alive-oh principle. Her chiefest tit-bit is a cockroach, and, as
  you will perceive from her manner as you make her acquaintance, it is a firm
  article of Sukey's belief that visitors carry these interesting insects about
  with them, in large quantities.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag20-20.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>When one remembers how comparatively unfashionable this practice is, one
  can understand that Sukey largely lives the life of a disappointed creature.
  By way of a great feast, she will sometimes be given a mouse; and she fishes
  perseveringly through such odd cracks and holes as she may find, in hopes of
  providing such a feast for herself. I respectfully suggest baiting the end of
  her tongue with a piece of cheese. As it is, I fear her catch of mice is
  scarcely sufficient to warrant the importation of the ant-eater as a
  substitute for the harmless necessary (but usually more harmful than
  necessary) Tom-cat of the garden-wall.</p>

    <img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag20-21.gif"
         alt="Illustration"

  </div>

  <p>The ant-eater is not a prepossessing being, Anybody who had never before
  seen or heard of him would readily believe him to be an inhabitant of the
  moon. He looks the sort of animal one would invent in a nightmare; his
  comparatively sober colours and his bushy tail save him from being an
  absolute unearthly horror. Conceive, if you can, a pink ant-eater with blue
  spots and a forked tail!</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag20-22.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Neither is the ant-eater very wise; nothing with so much tongue is very
  wise; and the ant-eater uses up so much of its head-stuff on its nose that
  nothing is left for the brain. The ant-eater never cuts his wisdom teeth,
  because he never has any teeth at all. Really the ant-eater scarcely seems a
  respectable character, considered altogether. An animal with more than a foot
  of slender nose, expressly used for poking into other people's concerns (the
  ants'), an immeasurable tongue, no use for a tooth-brush, and an irregular
  longing for cockroaches for lunch&mdash;well, is such an animal quite
  respectable? Would you, for instance, tolerate him in your club?</p>

  <p>The only fairly respectable member of the Dasypidae is the
  armadillo&mdash;unless you count the sloth's scientific indolence a claim to
  respectability; I rather think it is. But none of the Dasypidae are
  clever&mdash;not one. They are all in the lowest form of the mammalian
  school, and whenever one is not at the bottom of the form it is because
  another already occupies the place. You will commonly find them placed last
  of the mammalia in the first book of natural history you look at.</p><br>

  <p class="first">NOW, a "scansorial zigzag" may be interpreted to mean a
  graded path up a cliff&mdash;does mean it, in fact, if you like to use the
  phrase in that sense. I don't. Scansores are climbing birds&mdash;toucans,
  parrots, parrakeets, cockatoos, macaws, lories, and woodpeckers. In the house
  numbered 54 and 55 on the plan of the Gardens (having two numbers for no
  particular reason except that one would be quite enough), all these birds are
  represented except the woodpecker. The wood-pecker is also excluded from this
  zigzag for similar reasons, which I can't remember at this moment. One may be
  the fact of the woodpecker tapping, whereas all taps is
  vanities.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag21-02.gif"

  is over against the wall, opposite the front door of 54 and 55, that one
  recognises the fine Roman nose of the toucan. A green nose, a red nose, a
  yellow nose, a black nose, all these colours you may see, but all nobly Roman
  as to shape. The toucan will not talk in the manner of the parrot, but he (or
  she) is an admirable listener. I have told the green-billed toucan many
  stories of bird-scandal without interruption, and, on the whole, the
  conversation has been most improving. "Dear, dear!"&mdash;"Really,
  now"&mdash;"Who'd have thought it?"&mdash;"No&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;o! You
  don't really say so? Well, you do surprise me!" These are the only
  contributions offered to the talk by the green-billed toucan, and even these
  are only in pantomime. An ideal listener, the toucan. I have a horrible
  temptation to say that toucan play at that game, and that if you are anxious
  not to be toucandid, you toucan say nothing, and the bird will listen just as
  respectfully; but a pious bringing-up enables me to cast the temptation from
  me&mdash;toucancel the inclination, in fact. Howbeit, the truth remains that
  the toucan will listen with perfect attention whether you proffer information
  aloud or get no further than inventing it.</p>

  <p>The toucan will chatter horribly in native freedom, but that is only when
  many hundreds of other toucans are present to keep it in countenance; for the
  toucan's voice is not pretty, and he knows it. Still, when hundreds assemble,
  every one with a discordant voice, nothing is more natural than that they
  should all shout at once, and unite in the belief that the performance is
  admirable. If there were any ugly women (there are not, of course&mdash;it is
  a mere hypothesis), and they were all collected together to the number of
  many hundreds on a solitary island, the first thing they would do would be to
  hold a beauty show with a prize for everybody, and next they would fight over
  the distribution of those prizes. The toucans do something very much like
  this&mdash;minus the fighting, because the prize is mutual admiration. They
  chatter and scream in their hundreds&mdash;taking care to leave a sentinel on
  guard, because other animals won't stand anything, even in South
  America&mdash;and at intervals they all join in a simultaneous yell of
  approbation, audible half a league off.</p>

  <p>The whole performance is a sad piece of humbug, which makes one marvel
  greatly that because of it the South American natives call the toucan the
  Preacher-bird. Here, with so many gorgeous parrots and macaws about, the
  toucan behaves with becoming modesty, but in the presence of any duller-clad
  bird than itself its arrogance is frightful. A great crowd of toucans will
  mob any such unfortunate creature with much chatter, till, surrounded by long
  and threatening bills, like a despairing debtor, he "hops the twig"&mdash;if
  he can.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most dissipated-looking creature in the animal kingdom is a
  toucan during a bad moult. You long to give him a gallon of soda-water and a
  temperance tract. He sleeps much (a toucan always sleeps with his beak over
  his shoulder and covered by his wing&mdash;he doesn't mean to have that nose
  stolen)&mdash;he sleeps as much as possible, and wakes as seedy as one can
  imagine.</p>

  <p>He can scarcely drag his beak off his back without banging it on his
  perch, and considers the question of breakfast with a shudder. With many
  blinks he strives desperately to pull himself together&mdash;to pull together
  a handful of loose quills and a beak.</p>

  <p>They give him grapes; it is a mockery. Who can eat grapes with such a
  head? He may struggle with a grape perhaps for a few seconds, but breakfast
  beats him in the end, and he retires to a repentant corner. What a night it
  must have been.</p>

  <p>Out of his moult, however, and in good feather, the toucan is rather a
  fine bird, so long as you forget his nose. The Ariel toucan here&mdash;with
  the black beak&mdash;is a little horsey in aspect&mdash;a very
  little&mdash;but quite neat and gentlemanly. Not such a real old crusted
  Tory-club-window gentleman as the Triton cockatoo, but still a gentleman. As
  for the green-billed toucan, she can never be anything but a good-natured
  Jewess in her most gorgeous Shobbos clothes.</p>

  <p>The comparative quietness of the toucans in house number 54-55 is,
  probably, due to a worse thing&mdash;the noise of the parrots and cockatoos;
  the house can hold no more noise, and the toucans altogether despair of ever
  making themselves heard.</p>

  <p>Why the windows are so rarely broken I can scarcely understand, except on
  the hypothesis of a suspension of natural laws for the benefit of natural
  science and its institutions. The keeper says he doesn't mind the
  noise&mdash;to such torture may human nature be accommodated by long habit.
  Saint Cecilia would have become accustomed to boiling if she had had forty
  years of it. The other saint (male, but I forget which) who was grilled could
  never have done without his hot gridiron if he had been able to keep on it
  for forty years, the time this keeper has been among these parrots.
  Personally, I should expect to become reconciled to boiling, grilling, or any
  other class of plain cookery, in about half the time that would elapse before
  a few hundred competitive parrot-yells began to feel soothing to the
  nerves.</p>

  <p>There is no other house in these Gardens where the unobtrusive visitor is
  so made to feel his utter smallness and insignificance&mdash;and that by mere
  brazen clamour&mdash;as in this. The elephants look large&mdash;they are
  large&mdash;but the elephants behave with gentlemanly quietness and
  self-respect. The parrots rise up and curse you (and everything else) with
  sudden and painful unanimity. You are appalled, dwarfed, made insignificant
  and ashamed by the overpowering vastness of&mdash;the mere row.</p><img src=

  <p>The fact is that each single individual of this crowd of parrots,
  cockatoos, macaws, and parrakeets holds his own importance above every other
  created thing as a prime article of belief, and is naturally and most
  virtuously indignant when he finds that you don't go directly to him and load
  him with presents. Therefore, he blares and screams at you, till the air
  swims in your ears and eyes and the outer world is but a chaos of great
  beaks, angry combs, and streaks of red, green, and white. If you venture so
  far as to make an invidious selection, and tender a peace-offering to a
  particular bird, you draw down upon your devoted head the double rage and
  united jealousy of all the other parrots, cockatoos, parrakeets, and macaws,
  each convinced that you couldn't possibly have seen <i>him</i> or you would
  never have slighted so superlative a creature; and again the air and the
  colours swim to your senses.</p>

  <p class="first">The whole sensation is not unlike that produced by a long
  inspection of immense thundering and shrieking engineering works. You feel
  bewildered and you feel small: and everything about you is metallic and
  mechanical. Every movement of a parrot, if you will but notice it, is
  suggestive of metal joints and mechanical action; and the voice&mdash;but
  there is no metal metallic enough to emit such a voice as that at its
  worst.</p>

  <p>There is a married couple here&mdash;Triton cockatoos&mdash;near the
  keeper's room.</p>

  <p>They nag and quarrel and snarl at one another, and all on strictly
  mechanical principles. Their only gibe is an inarticulate snarl delivered
  when repartee seems unlikely.</p>

  <p>Thus, Mr. C. observing Mrs. C. apparently asleep will snarl ferociously,
  and compose himself to rest. In a little while Mrs. C. will rouse herself,
  and perceiving the placid quiescence of Mr. C., will snarl at him and go to
  sleep again; all this with a mechanic jerk of the head and neck suggestive of
  Punch or an automaton. After a while, perhaps, the inclination for a snarl
  will take both at once, and, finding themselves face to face, with nothing
  original to say, they will subside and sulk for the rest of the day, each
  trying hard to think of some particularly unkind remark to hurl at the
  other.</p>

  <p>Cocky, the big Triton, has been moved here from the insect-house, and
  shows signs of forgetting his English. That is what will occur in a
  congregation of this sort.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag21-13.gif"

  <p>The marvel is that many of the birds will still talk at all. An old,
  rose-crested cockatoo will dance gracefully, with his head on one side (and
  his eye on the reward), at the offer of a nut. He is called Cocky, in common
  with all of his kind, just as the parrot is always Polly; but I prefer to
  call him Richardson, because his is, practically speaking, the only show in
  the fair.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag21-14.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"

  <p class="first">There is a slen­der-billed cocka­too, who of­fers me a
  war­like challenge to "come on" when­ever I approach him, and a few more who
  have a word or two, but Richardson is the only bird capable of a decent show.
  He will stand at his cage wires and bawl out "What ho! what ho! what ho!" in
  a way that confirms his classification as a showman and gives a hint of
  aspirations to tragedy. Richardson is the least mechanical of the birds here,
  and is a most respectable and old-fashioned veteran, who would look quite in
  character taking snuff, arid whose polite accomplishments have not been
  ruined by his residence among unmannered crowds of other birds.</p><img src=

  <p class="first">But, mannered or not, here is nothing but a crowd of
  scream­ing, unfeeling, snapping painted machines. I have never seen a plucked
  parrot, but I know without seeing, that you have only to pluck one to lay
  bare nuts and bolts cams, hinges, springs, cranks, and metallic joints. See a
  cockatoo spread and shut his crest; clearly it is just the motion that could
  be actuated by a string on the wooden harlequin principle; probably, as there
  is no string, there is a long spiral spring under the feathers of the head
  (just lying along where some people part their hair) set going by a catch on
  the principle of the air-gun trigger.</p>

  <p class="first">As to the gorgeous me­chanisms on perches that hang in a
  line down the main aisle, every joint, sound, and motion spells "clockwork"
  aloud. Such of these as speak have one word, which is "Hullo!"</p>

  <p class="first">This, in varying degrees of urgency and gruffness, will
  greet you as you pass along the line&mdash;if you show any indication of
  nuts; other­wise you are insignificant, and unworthy of notice.</p>

  <p class="first">One fine blue and yellow machine will not say "Hullo"
  without receiving a nut in advance; probably being constructed on the
  familiar automatic prin­ciple. But it is all an ex­pressionless outcome of
  clockwork. We seldom see among the lists of "patents sealed" and "provisional
  protections" granted, any reference to an invention for improvements in the
  mechanism of parrot and cockatoos.</p>

  <p>It is a remarkable thing that so obvious a field for invention and
  improve­ment should have been so much neglected. Plainly, an easy and obvious
  improve­ment would be the provision of a simple shut-off valve, by which the
  suf­fering proprietor could stop the parrot's steam whistle when
  desired.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag21-19.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The desira­bility of some such im­provement need not be enlarged upon,
  and, once the appliance were in the market, every parrot-owner would hasten
  to have it fitted to his machine.</p>

  <p>Another contrivance, having the same object, would consist of a
  self-acting escape valve, by which the familiar scream of the mechanism would
  be diverted, and escape noiselessly through a small grating at the back of
  the neck after a certain degree of pressure had been attained. Moreover, what
  more easy than to have the outer side of the jaw-hinge fitted with a
  convenient butterfly-nut, by tightening which, after the periodical stoking
  with maize and so forth, the engine would be prevented from nipping
  carelessly-offered fingers?</p>

  <p>As it is at present, the jaw-hinge is a mere ordinary pair of sharp
  pincers barbarically ornamented with feathers and colours. Improvements
  suggest themselves at every point. Many of these otherwise amusing
  instruments cause trouble by occasionally breaking out into startling and
  exceedingly forcible language. It would seem that a pressure valve might be
  profitably employed in this case also, by means of which, as soon as the
  expressions reached to the degree of "blow it," or "shut up," the power would
  be immediately diverted, and either allowed to escape harmlessly through a
  small chimney at the top of the head, or else conducted by a
  power-transmitting mechanism to an adjacent musical-box, which would play
  "Pop Goes the Weasel," or something else of a similarly moral tendency.</p>

  <p>The whole subject is full of profitable suggestions, which are offered,
  free of any expense beyond a small royalty to myself, to the notice of
  persons of mechanical genius.</p><br>

  <p class="first">PEOPLE, as a rule, are not fond of lizards, and the larger
  the lizards the less people like them; until the crocodile and the alligator,
  largest of all, are received with positive antipathy, and rarely treated as
  pets. People make many excuses for such an attitude toward lizards; calling
  them ugly, crawly, slimy, scaly, and so forth.</p><img src=

        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>I have an hypothesis that envy is a large element in this human antipathy.
  For after all, if we will but confess it, the alligator's is rather an
  enviable lot. To lie all day in a bed of warm, soft mud&mdash;really, it is a
  pleasant thing. To be able, without inconvenience, to postpone dinner for a
  fortnight&mdash;that is attractively economical. To enjoy the advantages of
  six eyelids and the resulting capability in winks&mdash;there is something
  even in this.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag22-03.gif"

  <p>But chiefly, envy for the croco­dile has got into the grain of humanity by
  heredity from those ancients who believed everything that Plutarch told them
  in his book, <i>De Iside et Osiride</i>. The crocodile, he informs us
  therein, can render itself invisible at will, everything else being perfectly
  visible to it the while. This is a noble privilege, and worthy of the most
  respectful envy. Jack the Giant Killer performed the trick by means of a
  cloak; but Plutarch's crocodile does it "merely by the power of the heye," as
  the street-corner mesmerist has it&mdash;does it "like winking," in fact. The
  mechanism is very simple, and quite easy to understand. It consists only of a
  membrane to draw over the eye; and as the eye it is drawn over is the
  crocodile's, it is obvious that he becomes invisible at once. His ability to
  see others is provided for by the ingenious expedient of having the membrane
  transparent&mdash;and there you are. What could be simpler? Anybody who can
  run to a transparent membrane fitting for his eyes may dodge his creditors at
  will, thanks to the tip of the benevolent and ingenious
  Plutarch.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag22-04.gif"

  <p>In the reptile-house at these Gardens, the largest saurian bears the apt
  name of Little-'un. He is a youthful alligator, although, being rather more
  than 10ft. 6in. long, he has quite grown out of short frocks. Nothing
  infantile remains about his appearance, and he has in full development that
  curious cravat of fleshy folds and creases noticeable in no animals but
  alligators and 'bus-drivers, and among the latter species only in the stout
  and red-faced variety.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag22-05.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">Little-'un's name was not given him by way of a joke, but
  be­cause, nine years ago, he was only a foot long&mdash;which <i>is</i>
  little for an alligator. Little-'un has always been a good business
  alligator, however, and by strict industry and invincible persev­erance in
  the pursuit of what­ever might be eatable, has ri­sen to an honoured and
  con­siderable eminence in the higher Zoo circles.</p>

  <p>To observe the open countenance of Little-'un bearing down on a piece of
  meat that ought property to belong to some other alligator, is to get a sight
  of a truly original edition of "Smiles's Self Help." Little-'un's one moral
  principle is&mdash;the greatest good of the greatest alligator. His business
  maxim is&mdash;get something to eat; honestly, if there is no other way, but,
  anyhow, get it as large as possible, and as often as you can.</p><img src=

  <p>He would, without the least bashfulness, proceed to eat his friends in the
  same tank if Tyrrell (the keeper, whom you know already) neglected the
  commissariat. Indeed, he once began on one fellow-lodger, with no other
  excuse than opportunity. Feeding was in progress, and, in the scramble and
  confusion, a smallish crocodile, lunging his nose in the direction of the
  desired morsel, without particularly noticing where that direction led, found
  himself up to the eyes in Little-'un's dental establishment. Little-'un's
  prudent habits rendered it unlikely that he would deliberately fling away
  anything that Providence had actually thrust into his mouth, even if it were
  his own grandfather; and only a vigorous application of Tyrrell's pole saved
  the crocodile from making a meal in a sense he didn't originally intend.</p>

  <p>Eighty-five degrees is the temperature prescribed for the water here, and
  every crocodile is a thermometer unto himself, soon showing signs,
  notwithstanding his thick hide, of any variation in the rate of his gentle
  stewing&mdash;Little-'un being as sensitive as any, in spite of his assiduous
  attention to business.</p>

  <p>With Tyrrell, by the way, Little-'un is comparatively affable, for an
  alligator. Tyrrell climbs calmly into the basin, among its inmates, to swill
  and mop it out at the weekly cleaning, herding crocodiles and alligators into
  a corner by the flourish of a mop, in a manner more than
  disrespectful&mdash;almost insulting. There is some mysterious influence
  about that mop. Why should alligators shut their heads and stand meekly aside
  at its potent waggle? I would never venture up the Nile without Tyrrell's
  mop. With one wave of that mystic sceptre I would assume immediate
  sovereignty over all the crocodiles in Africa, and drive them into corners.
  There is no withstanding that mop. If it will intimidate crocodiles, plainly
  it would be successful with leopards, cobras, lions, and tigers. If I could
  borrow it I would even try it on the beadle at the Bank of England, and if I
  could wave <i>him</i> aside with it, I should know that thenceforth the world
  was at my feet; and I'm afraid Tyrrell wouldn't get his mop
  back.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag22-07.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>But I was speaking of Little-'un: his affability; and of Tyrrell: his
  irreverent familiarity. When Tyrrell mops out the basin, he finds it
  convenient to leave somewhat under a foot of water in the bottom for cleaning
  purposes, and as this would be damp (as is water's nature) to tread in, he
  calmly stands on Little-'un's back and proceeds placidly with his mopping. To
  wave an alligator aside with a mop is an insult altogether, but to stand on
  his back for the sake of dry shoes is an outrage unutterable. Little-'un
  seems a very appropriate name as it stands, but if ever a time should arrive
  when it must he changed, I think, with every respect and honour to the
  departed statesman, I should suggest John Bright. "Mr. Speaker," said an
  honourable member, who spoke before he thought, but whose name I have
  forgotten, "Mr. Speaker, the right honourable gentleman" (Mr. Bright)
  "accuses me of making allegations. Why, sir, the right honourable gentleman
  is the greatest alligator in this House!" Which is precisely what Little-'un
  is now.</p>

  <p>Round at the back, in his private domains, Tyrrell keeps a crocodile and
  alligator nursery. It is a metal box fixed against a wall and holding about a
  gallon. Here are all the infants, eight inches to a foot long, squirming,
  wriggling, and struggling, with a lively activity foreign to the nature of
  the full-grown alligator. Tyrrell will plunge his hand into the struggling
  mass and produce a handful for your inspection. They are charming little pets
  and as ready to bite as if they were twenty feet long. An alligator may be
  pardoned some impatience in growing; if he is to be ten feet and a half long
  at nine years of age, there is a deal of lee-way to make up. Most creatures
  would be discouraged at being born only to a measurement in inches, and
  refuse to grow at all.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag22-08.gif"

  <p class="first">There would appear to be a sort of general reluct­ance to
  make a domestic pet of the crocodile; it is not fashionable now, and nobody
  seems anxious to set the <i>mode</i>. To en­courage anybody who is disposed
  to distinguish himself, I may observe that a crocodile is cheap­est when
  young. This is doubly fortunate, because for a less sum you have a longer run
  for your mo­ney&mdash;the last expression not being intended in any
  uncomfortable sense. I believe the usual price of young crocodiles and
  alli­gators, up to a certain size, is a guinea a linear foot; at any rate, I
  know you could buy them at that rate of my old friend Mr. Jamrach, and I have
  no doubt that the Zoological Society may be able, from time to time, to spare
  a foot or two of alligator at the price. If you buy a foot&mdash;or a yard,
  as the case may be (the <i>case</i>, of course, will be a little longer, but
  that is unworthy trifling)&mdash;you must be careful to keep it in a warm
  place, in water at the right temperature, at night as well as day. Then when
  it grows to the size of Little-'un, it will make an imposing embellishment
  for your entrance-hall, and useful to receive subscription-collectors. And to
  take them inside.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag22-10.gif"

  <p>It is a bad thing to generalize in a world containing China. China upsets
  everything. If you venture to put a date to the invention of gunpowder,
  somebody is sure to remind you to except China; the same with printing and
  everything else. There is nothing China hasn't got or hasn't had. So that
  naturally, after America has many years flaunted and gloried in the exclusive
  possession of the broad-nosed alligator as distinguished from the
  sharp-snouted crocodile, China, in the old familiar aggravating way, bobs up
  serenely with <i>her</i> alligators&mdash;perfectly authentic and genuine,

  all the&mdash;" He will probably refuse to believe the thing alive, and it
  certainly looks more like a fine old Paleozoic Fossil than anything else
  imaginable. This is due to the operation of Misdirected Patience&mdash;a
  virtue so noticeable as to demand capital letters. For the Snapper has been
  in this not very large tank for ten years, and has not yet become convinced
  that there are no fish in it. Wherefore he laboriously and patiently fishes
  without a moment's cessation. Fishing, with him, means waiting immovably with
  open mouth for a fish to come and be gobbled. He has waited ten years for a
  bite, but that is nothing unusual, as you may try for yourself, if you buy a
  rod and line. It is calculated, I believe, that a hundred years more in his
  present attitude will be sufficient to fossilize him, when, no doubt, he will
  be passed on to the Geological Society.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag22-12.gif"

  <p>He has never yet found the need for an individual name; but I am thinking
  of suggesting a suitable combination&mdash;I think it should be Job
  Walton.</p>

  <p>Job is not an emotional person. He never exhibits enthusiasm, even for
  fishing. I shouldn't myself, after ten years' waiting for a bite. There he
  floats, with all the mental activity of an ordinary brick, while visitors
  come and go, nations are convulsed, elections, boat-races are decided, and
  green weed grows all over his back, but he doesn't care. "A rolling stone
  gathers no moss" is a capital proverb for the guidance of people who care for
  moss as a personal adornment. Job avoids all rolling, in common with other
  forms of movement, and is lavishly rewarded with moss of the greenest, on
  back, legs, toes, and tail.</p>

  <p>Beyond his patience (a negative sort of virtue, after all), Job Walton has
  no particular personal characteristic that I can discover, except extreme
  niggardliness plain and patent in his face. He has nothing in the world to be
  niggardly with, except his moss, but if he had, he would make a very
  unindulgent uncle. I have a theory that Job is not an animal at all, but a
  fossilized concretion of the twin virtues (or what you like to call them),
  patience and stinginess; a sort of petrified fungus, produced by the chemical
  action consequent on the mingling of the two qualities. Probably some very
  shocking old miser (perhaps it was Scrooge himself) lost all his stinginess
  at once, just at the identical moment when some long-suffering person lost
  his patience (this was, probably, an angler).</p><img src=

  <p>The subtle essences comprising these qualities met and

  occurs a thousand times a day in the case of toadstools.</p>

  <p>I am really friendly with only one of the smaller lizards here&mdash;and
  he is a large one; the big monitor at the corner. But I have never been able
  to learn from him, even in his most confidential moments, how many feet of
  tongue he really has. It is a round, whip-lash sort of tongue, like the
  ant-eater's, and I have a private superstition in both cases that there
  actually is no other end to that tongue.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag22-15.gif"

  <p>The monitor is fond of rats, but the rats are not at all partial to his
  society. Lesueur's Water lizard is a curious specimen. He has not been here
  long, but has already assumed, on his own nomination, a position of great
  responsibility and importance. He is Inspector of Visitors. He won't have
  questionable characters in the reptile-house.</p><img src=

  <p class="first">When not actively inspecting, he is watching for his
  victims. He ob­serves a visitor approaching. He is on guard at once, by the
  front glass of the case. His aspect is official and stern, his manner abrupt
  and peremptory; he is not a lizard to be trifled with. "Paid your shilling?"
  he demands, as plainly as a silent lizard may. "Got your railway ticket? Show
  it."</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag22-17.gif"

  <p class="first">Any respectable visitor with the fear of the law before his
  eyes will comply at once. "Where do you live? Produce your last water-rate
  receipt." He looks you up and down suspiciously. "Been vaccinated lately?
  Date? All right. Pass along." And he swings abruptly round to watch for
  somebody else.</p>

  <p>The Australian Bearded Lizard (most quaint lizards are Australian) is
  supposed to derive his colloquial name&mdash;the Jew Lizard&mdash;from his
  beard. But he has an Israelitish acquisitiveness of his own,
  too.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag22-18.gif"

  <p>"Mine," he intimates, "mine, every one of them: and you keep your hands

  "pishnesh" if mere gesture-talk admitted of it. A little irritation goes a
  long way with the Jew lizard. His beard stands out tremendously, he swells to
  a rib-threatening degree, and stands at bay with open mouth, ready to smite
  the Philistines hip and thigh and spoil the Egyptians of their
  finger-tips&mdash;let them but come near enough. But he is a very respectable
  lizard, not so lazy as most, and pleasant to the touch.</p><img src=

  <p>An active little Gallot's lizard was placed here lately, with a pair of
  chameleons, but the contrast was so disgraceful to the chameleons that he was
  removed, and made to chum with a Gecko, a few cases off. He absorbed all the
  rations, too, which was an addition of injury to insult, although chameleons
  can always put off dinner for a month or two without inconvenience.</p>

  <p>A chameleon is a sort of twin. Like other things, he has two halves; but
  these halves are only acquainted with one another&mdash;not really
  intimate.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag22-23.gif"

  <p class="first">His left-hand side is often asleep while the right is as
  wide awake as a chame­leon's side can he. His eyes, also, are quite
  independent of one another, and roll in opposite directions as often as not,
  so that he would he inconvenient as a Speaker. Everybody would catch his eye
  at once and there would be quarrels&mdash;possibly even fights&mdash;a thing
  impossible in the House of Commons as it is. A chameleon never walks, he
  proceeds in this way.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag22-25.gif"

  <p>After a long and careful deliberation, extending over half an hour or so,
  he proceeds to lift one foot. You may not be able to see it moving, but it is
  moving all the same, like the hand of a watch. Take a look round the Gardens
  and come back, when, if you have not been too hurried in your inspection, you
  may see the lifted foot in mid-air, and the chameleon probably asleep. He
  usually takes a nap after any unusual exertion. In an hour or two he will
  wake up, and proceed to plant that foot, with proper deliberation, before
  him. Then there will be another nap and a good think, after which the tail
  will begin to unwind from the branch it clings to. This process, persistently
  persevered in for many days, will carry the intrepid gymnast quite a number
  of inches.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag22-26.gif"

  <p>But a journey of this sort is an enterprise rarely ventured on. Chameleons
  prefer the less exciting sport of sitting face to face and daring each other
  to mortal combat, secure in the assurance that neither will think of moving
  toward the other.</p>

  <p>They <i>have</i> been known to Fight. A chameleon fight is an amusement
  whereunto neither the Peace Society nor the Society for the Prevention of
  Cruelty to Animals need have any objection. No evangelistic clergyman need
  incur scandal by being present, an interested spectator, at a chameleon
  fight. The savage combatants never attempt to bite. They gaze gravely and
  seriously at the surroundings, and at proper pre-arranged intervals solemnly
  dab their tails together&mdash;not hard, nor with any particular feeling
  beyond a desire to conduct the rite with proper formality and decorum. It is
  the most harmless and dignified scuffle in the animal creation.</p><br>

  <p class="first">WHENCE has arisen the notion that monkeys are happy
  creatures? Probably from the inadequate fact that they pull one another's
  tails and run away. But a being may be mischievous without being happy. Many
  mischievous boys are never happy possibly because the laws of Nature won't
  permit of half the mischief they are anxious to accomplish. Still, the
  monkey, at any rate in a state of freedom, is looked upon as a typically
  happy creature. "And watch the gay monkey on high," says Bret Harte; and Mr.
  Kipling addresses the monkey as "a gleesome, fleasome thou," which latter
  looks like an attempt to make an admissible adjective pass in an unwarranted
  brother.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag23-02.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>I have seen monkeys fleasome, treesome, freesome, keysome (opposite
  adjectives these, you will perceive on reflection), and disagreesome, but
  cannot call to mind one that looked in the least gleesome. Everything that
  runs up a fence or swings on a rope is not necessarily jolly, much as the
  action would appear to justify the belief. Many a human creature has stormed
  a fence with a lively desire to attain the dogless side, but no noticeable
  amount of jollity; and a man escaping from fire by, a rope wastes no time in
  unseasonable hilarity, dangle he never so quaintly. Look at their faces; look
  also at the monkey's face. If a monkey grin, it is with rage; his more
  ordinary expression of countenance is one of melancholy reflection&mdash;of
  sad anxiety. His most waggish tricks are performed with an air of hopeless
  dejection. Now, this may be due to any one of three causes, or even to a
  mixture of them. It may be that, like the boy, he dolorously reflects that,
  after all, mischief has its limits; that you cannot, so to speak, snatch the
  wig of the man in the moon, upset the Milky Way, or pull the tail of the
  Great Bear. Or it may be that a constant life of practical jokes, and of
  watchfulness to avert them, is a wearying and a saddening thing after all. Or
  it may be that every ape, meditating on his latest iniquity, tries for ever
  to look as though it were the other monkey.</p><img src=

  <p>With many people, to speak of the Zoo monkeys is to speak of Sally. Poor
  Sally! Who would not weep for Sally? For Sally is dead and hath not left her
  peer. A perversion of Milton is excusable in the circumstances. Why is there
  no memorial of Sally? "Is the spot marked with no colossal bust?" as they say
  on invitations to bachelor small-hour revels. There should, at least, be a
  memorial inscription to Sally.</p>

  <p>Sally, when first she came here in 1883, was a modest and, indeed, rather
  a shy chimpanzee. A few years of elementary education, however, quite changed
  Sally's character, for she learnt to count up to five, and to be rather
  impudent. Wonderfully uniform are the results of elementary education. The
  chimpanzees, orang-outangs, and such near relatives of humanity are kept,
  when they are alive to keep, in the sloths' house. Such as are there chiefly
  occupy their time in dying. It seems to be the only really serious pursuit
  they ever take to. Sudden death is so popular among them, that it is quite
  impossible to know how many are there at any particular time without having
  them all under the eye at the moment. A favourite "sell" among them is for a
  chimpanzee or orang to become a little educated and interesting, then wait
  till some regular visitor invites all his friends to inspect the phenomenon,
  and die just before they arrive at the door. This appears to be considered a
  most amusing practical joke by the dead monkey, and is much persevered
  in.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag23-04.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Sally was a black-faced chimpanzee. The white-faced kind is more common,
  and in the days of its extreme youth much more like a stage Irishman, except
  that his black hair gives him the appearance of wearing dress trousers very
  much frayed at the ankles.</p>

  <p>The orang-outang is less intellectual as a rule than the chimpanzee; but
  he has a deceptive appearance of brain-pan&mdash;an illusory height of
  forehead&mdash;-that earns undeserved respect.</p><img src=

  <p>Many a man has conducted a suc­cessful business with credit on the
  strength of a reputa­tion as easily earned. With the orang as with the
  chimpanzee, it is in infancy that he presents the most decently human
  appearance. But even then he is a low, blackguard sort of baby&mdash;worse
  than the precocious baby of the Bab Ballad could possibly have been. He
  should have a pipe for a feeding-bottle and a betting-book to learn his
  letters from. These anthropoid apes come with such suddenness and die with
  such uncertainty that I cannot say whether there are any in the Zoo now or
  not&mdash;-I haven't been there since yesterday.</p><img src=

  <p>But wanderoos there are, I feel safe in saying, and Gibbons. The wanderoo
  is a pretty monkey, and usually gentle. He has a grave, learned, and reverend
  aspect as viewed from the front, and this is doubtless why, in India, his is
  supposed to be a higher caste, respected and feared by other monkeys. That
  same wig, however, that looks so venerable in the forefront view, is but a
  slatternly tangle in profile, like unto the <i>chevelure</i> of a dowdy
  kitchenmaid. But a wanderoo, well taught, and of good-temper, is as clean and
  quaint a pet as you may desire, and as delicate as the poet's gazelle, with
  its incurable habit of dying. The same may be said of the Gibbon. In this
  climate he Declines and Falls on the smallest excuse, although, perhaps, not
  quite so readily as the chimpanzee, who may almost be said to Decline and
  Fall professionally, like Mr. Wegg.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag23-07.gif"

  <p>The Diana monkey, too, makes a pleasant pet, and is not so confirmed a
  dier as some. The Diana monkey here is over in the large monkey-house, in the
  middle of the Gardens. Her name is Jessie, and her beard is most venerable
  and patriarchal.</p>

  <p>But just outside the eastern door of the big house, John, the Tcheli
  monkey, occupies his separate mansion. John is a noticeable and choleric
  character. He dislikes being made the object of vulgar curiosity, and is apt
  to repel an inspection of his premises with a handful of sawdust. Any
  unflattering remark on his personal appearance will provoke a wild dance
  about his cage and a threatening spar through the wires. But once threaten
  him with a policeman&mdash;do as much as mention the word, in fact&mdash;and
  John becomes a furious Bedlamite, with the activity of a cracker and the
  intentions of dynamite. Against floor, walls, ceiling, and wires he bounces
  incontinent, flinging sawdust and language that Professor Garner would
  probably translate with hyphens and asterisks.</p><img src=

        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"

  <p>John is the most easily provoked monkey I know, and the quaintest in his
  rage. He is also the hardiest monkey in the world, being capable o enjoying a
  temperature of ten degrees below zero; but there is a suitable penalty
  provided in the by-laws for any person so lost to decency as to suggest that
  this Tcheli monkey is a very Tcheli monkey indeed. For John's benefit I would
  suggest an extra heap of sawdust on Bank Holidays. On an occasion of that
  sort it is little less than cruelty to keep him short of
  ammunition.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag23-09.gif"

  <p class="first">Of the big mon­key-house, who remembers more than a
  nightmare of tails, paws, and chatterings? Here are monkeys with beards,
  monkeys with none, big monkeys, little monkeys, monkeys with blue faces,
  monkeys who would appear to have escaped into the grounds at some time and to
  have sat on freshly painted seats; all thieving from visitors and each other,
  pulling tails, swinging, turning somersaults, with faces expressive of
  unutterable dolor and weariness of the world. The wizen, careworn face of the
  average monkey appeals to me as does that of the elderly and rheumatic
  circus-clown, when his paint has washed off.</p><img src=

        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">The monkey, I am con­vinced, is as sick of his regu­lation
  jokes as is the clown of his. But he has a comic reputation to keep up, and
  he does it, though every me­chanical joke is a weariness and a sorrow to the
  flesh. "There is somebody's tail hanging from a perch," reflects the monkey,
  looking lugubriously across the cage. "I am a joker, and several human
  creatures are looking at me, and preparing to laugh; consequently, I must
  pull that tail, though I would prefer to stay where I am, especially as it
  belongs to a big monkey, who will do something unpleasant if he catches me."
  And with an inward groan he executes the time-honoured joke and bolts for his
  life.</p>

  <p>It is a sad affliction to be born a wag by virtue of species. There is one
  monkey here who for some weeks displayed a most astonishing reluctance to
  snatch things through the wires, and a total disinclination to assist or
  share in the thefts of his friends by "passing on" or dividing. For some time
  I supposed him to be a moral monkey strayed from a Sunday-school book, and
  afflicted with an uncomfortable virtue. But afterwards I found that his
  conscientiousness was wholly due to his having recently grabbed a cigar by
  the hot end, and imbibed thereby a suspicion of the temperature of
  everything.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag23-12.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Beware especially, in this house, of the paws of Marie, the Barbary ape.
  She has a long reach, and quickness enough to catch a bullet shot
  Poole-fashion&mdash;softly. Only Jungbluth, her keeper, can venture on
  familiarities, and him she takes by the eyebrows, gently stroking and
  smoothing them. Behind the large room Jungbluth keeps sick monkeys, delicate
  monkeys, tiny monkeys, and curious monkeys, who have no room outside.</p>

  <p>Here is a beautiful moustache monkey, segregated because of a slight cold,
  and at liberty to train his moustache without interference, if only it would
  grow sufficiently long. Watch the light fur under the chin of a moustache
  monkey; it is tinted with a delicate cobalt blue, a colour that would seem
  impossib except in feathers.</p>

  <p>But the little marmosets and the Pinche monkey, all in a cage together,
  are chiefly interesting here. The Pinche monkey is badly afflicted with
  nerves, and, as he is undisputed chief of the community, the marmosets have
  to be careful how they sneeze, or cough, or blink, or his indignation may be
  aroused. So that the whole performance in this cage is a sort of eccentric
  knockabout act, by the celebrated Marmosetti Eccentric
  Quartette.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag23-13.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Marmoset No. 1 ventures on a gentle twitter, and the rest join in the
  song. Promptly the irritated Pinch bounds from his inmost lair, and the
  songsters are scattered. Everybody doesn't know, by-the-bye, that the
  marmoset is consumed with an eternal ambition to be a singing bird, and
  practises his notes with hopeless perseverance. Another thing that many seem
  to be ignorant of, even some who keep marmosets as pets, is that a marmoset's
  chief food should consist of insects. In a state of freedom he also eats
  small birds; but for a pet, cockroaches and bluebottles will probably be
  found, as a dietary, preferable in some respects to humming-birds and
  canaries.</p>

  <p>Among the sick in this place is a spider monkey. Mind, I say he is there.
  To-morrow, or in five minutes, he will probably be somewhere else, for that
  is the nature of a monkey. Sickening, recovering, dying, snatching, jumping,
  tail-pulling, bonnet-despoiling, everything a monkey does is done in a
  hurry.</p>

  <p class="first">This particular spider monkey has two or three names, as
  Jerry, Tops and Billy, whereunto he answers indifferently; but I prefer to
  call him Coincidence, because of his long arms, and he answers as well to
  that name as to another. He came in here because of a severe attack of
  horizontal bar in the stomach. I have never seen a monkey fall, and, for that
  reason, wish I had seen the attack, as a curiosity. For, by some accident,
  un­paralleled in monkey history, Coincidence managed to miss his hold, and
  fell on his digestive department across a perch. He is a long, thread-papery
  sort of monkey, and it too a little time to convince him that he wasn't
  broken in half. When at last he understood that there was still only one of
  him, he set himself to such a doleful groaning and rubbing and turning up of
  the eyes, that Jungbluth put him on the sick list at once. But it took a very
  few hours to make him forget his troubles; and, indeed, I have some suspicion
  that the whole thing was a dodge to secure a comfortable holiday in
  hospital.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag23-17.gif"

  <p>That certainly is the opinion of Coincidence's friend, the Negro monkey,
  as his face will tell you, if you but ask him the question. It may interest
  those who already know that Coincidence has a long arm, to know also that he
  has but four fingers to each hand and no thumb; it is a part of his system.
  His tail is another part of his system, and you mustn't touch

  <p class="first">There is no more affable and friendly monkey alive than
  Coincidence, al­though he is a little timid; but once touch his tail (it is
  long, like every­thing else belong­ing to Coincidence), and you lose his
  friendship for ever. He instantly complains to Jungbluth, and points you out
  unmistakably for expulsion. It is this house that witnesses most excitement

  <p>Who would be a monkey in a cage set in the midst of a Bank Holiday crowd?
  I wouldn't, certainly, if there were a respectable situation available as a
  slug in some distant flower-pot, or a lobster at the bottom of the sea. Is a
  monkey morally responsible for anything he may do under the provocation of a
  Bank Holiday crowd? Is he not rather justified in the possession of all the
  bonnets and ostrich feathers he can grab by way of solatium?</p><img src=

  <p>Bank Holiday is the <i>dies irae</i> of these monkeys, and then is
  Professor Garner avenged. The Professor shut himself in an aluminium cage,
  and the cage littered about Africa for some time, an object of interest to
  independent monkeys&mdash;a sort of free freak show.</p>

  <p>Here the monkeys, secure in <i>their</i> cage, study the exterior freaks,

  But it is hard work&mdash;and savage. It takes even a capful of monkeys a few

  <h3>First published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, June 1894</h3>

  <p class="first">"RODOPORCINE" is a portmanteau-word. It is not a regular
  scientific term, although, as I may claim with modest pride (being its
  inventor), it is almost ugly enough to be one. I have invented it largely for
  the benefit of the building (it is only one building) which the Zoological
  Society numbers six and seven, and divides arbitrarily into "The Swine House"
  and "The Rodents' House"; but chiefly I have invented it because I wanted a
  title for this Zigzag. <i>Rodo</i> I gnaw, <i>porcus</i> a pig.</p>

  <p>The Society have old authority for any amount of confusion between the
  swine and the rodents. The guinea-pig has long ago established its right to
  its name, on the indisputable grounds of being entirely unconnected with
  Guinea, and not a pig, but a rodent.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag24-02.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The capybara is also called a water-pig (even in its Greek name) in
  virtue, doubtless, of being a rodent. "Porcupine" means a thorny pig; the
  name being again found convenient for a rodent, and enunciated with peculiar
  emphasis by the wag who wrote:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="poem">Each hair will stand on end upon thy wig,<br>
  Like quills upon the frightful porcupig.</p><br>

  <p>Then, by way of pleasant variation, the hedgehog derives its title from
  the fact of being neither a hog nor a rodent, but only a prickly kind of
  mole. So that confusion among pigs and rodents is an ancient, time-honoured,
  and respectable state of affairs, only feebly deferred to by the Zoological
  Society in placing the two side by side. Let us consider them, therefore, in
  a proper derangement and with a due regard to confusion.</p><img src=

  <p>The thoughtless world is disrespectful to the pig. It even uses its name
  as a term of reproach. Nobody likes to be called a pig, and yet if some were
  to accept the epithet with a good grace, and conscientiously act up to the
  character, there would be a deal of improvement in their manners. Proverbs
  abuse and slight the pig. "Pigs may whistle, but they have an ill mouth for
  it," says one; "Drunk as David's sow," says another; "What can you expect
  from a pig but a grunt?" asks a third, totally ignoring the existence of such
  products as bacon, lard, bristles, and saddle-leather. But then proverbs are
  always perpetrating injustices somewhere, until abuse from a proverb has
  become a sort of testimonial to the worth of anything&mdash;animal,
  vegetable, or mineral.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag24-04.gif"

  <p>The pig eats all it can get, certainly, but that is only a manifestation
  of what we are apt to call, in ourselves, prudence and business acumen. Once
  thoroughly fed it regards the world with serene apathy, but that is merely
  broad-mindedness and toleration.</p>

  <p>The nearest relatives here to the familiar porker of our native
  agricultural show are the wild swine&mdash;European and Asiatic&mdash;well
  set-up creatures, of form and manner not to be considered with disrespect,
  and carrying with them no more of traditional piggishness than a certain easy
  Bohemianism of manner and irregularity of bristle.</p><img src=

  <p>It is plain to see that whatever may be found of ill account in the pig is
  due to the contaminating influence of man. A wiry, well-groomed wild pig is a
  decent citizen of the animal community, unpleasantly ready with his tusks, of
  course, but clearly dignified and with intelligence. To me the wart-hog
  always seems the precise militarist among pigs. His neat, well-fitting feet,
  his closely-clad legs, and his high carriage of head are alone enough, to say
  nothing of his warlike tusks, and his mutton-chop side-whiskers, which indeed
  are only a sort of warts, but look as much like the real thing as they can
  manage. But, for all the other qualities of the grizzled old soldier, it
  cannot be concealed that he has a drunken eye.</p><img src=

        alt="Illustration"

  <p>From the comparatively noble wild swine (who cannot open his mouth without
  an invariable appearance of being about to sneeze) man has, by long selection
  and careful breeding, evolved a preposterous cylinder of locomotive pork.
  This he calls an "improved" pig&mdash;as who should speak of improving the
  heavens by casting advertisements thereon from a magic-lantern. It is a
  quaint paradox in the pig-fancier's system that the pig with the greatest
  number of excellent points is, as a matter of fact, the pig whose rotundity
  presents no point anywhere, nor anything like a point.</p>

  <p>There is a deal of catholicity of taste in a pig. He is quite prepared to
  devour the whole animal and vegetable kingdom, and very little hunger would
  persuade him to admit the mineral kingdom, too. Almost anything will "please
  the pigs"&mdash;which may be the origin of the proverb, although
  origin-mongers say differently; and yet the pig's senses of taste and smell
  are particularly acute; witness his use as a beast of chase&mdash;for the
  truffle. He has also an acute weather-wisdom, if countrymen's weather-lore be
  accepted; for if pigs carry straw in their mouths it will inevitably rain.
  Wherefore picnic parties will do well to remove all straw from the reach of
  pigs.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag24-07.gif"

        alt="Illustration"

  <p>The capybara&mdash;the water-pig which is no pig&mdash;is a rudimentary
  sort of structure. He presents a kind of rough outline or experimental draft
  of a quadruped in its preliminary stages of invention. All the materials are
  there&mdash;more than enough, in fact and the rough plan of their arrangement
  is sketched out, but there is no detail&mdash;nor, indeed, any other kind of
  tail&mdash;and no finish. The body (and a very liberal body, too), the hair
  (also liberal, and thick), the head and legs, have been put together
  tentatively with a shovel, and all the fine work has been omitted; indeed,
  the operations have never even arrived at the stage at which the tail is
  stuck on. The capybara's ideals, notions of life, wants and aspirations are
  of the rudimentary character appropriate to his figure. He has no particular
  objection to being tame and docile so long as he is fed&mdash;nor any
  particular repugnance to being otherwise.</p>

  <div align="center">

  <p>He will eat a piece of cabbage if it is there; otherwise he gets on very
  well with a lump of firewood. He has a drink when the idea occurs to him, and
  takes it in the ordinary way as a rule, but, sometimes, under the unwonted
  stimulus of a brilliantly new conception, he sits in his drink as he takes
  it.</p>

  <div align="center">

  <p>This would appear to be his notion of humour; it is the capybara's only
  joke, and he never varies it in form or spirit. He is not a communicative
  beast, and never offers a remark to any human creature but Church, his
  keeper, and then it is by way of extracting something to eat. The remark is a
  sort of purring rattle&mdash;the rudimentary speech of an animal whose vocal
  organs have not been tuned. The redeeming feature in the capybara, in these
  days of hysteric fad, is his utter absence of "views" on any subject in the
  world. And he has no enthusiasms.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag24-10.gif"

  <p>The tapir is nothing but an ambitious pig&mdash;a pig trying to be an
  elephant. But the most careful cultivation has not succeeded in elongating
  his trunk beyond a few inches, and the biggest of the tapirs can get no
  nearer the stature of the elephant than a small donkey. It is probably this
  that makes the tapir a melancholy animal, silent and despondent. There is no
  gaiety in the composition of the tapir. In a fatefully unlucky moment he
  began to try to be an elephant, and thenceforward happiness forsook him. Like
  the king in the history-book, he never smiled again. His life is one
  cheerless, hopeless, dreary struggle to be what he can never become. Being a
  pig, he is obstinate, or he would have given up the attempt long ago.
  Elephantine ambition in particular is not born in the tapir, though ambition
  of a vague sort is. The young tapir always begins by trying to be a tiger or
  a zebra; breaking out in brilliant stripes and spots; but in due time he
  regularly settles down, after the manner of his kind, to achieve rank as an
  elephant. He is a melancholy example of discontent in humble circumstances.
  Still, there is a deal of human nature in the tapir. Plainly it is largely
  Hebrew human nature, notwithstanding his porcine connections.</p><img src=

        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The ordinary tapir is a grave, respectable, and judicious Israelitish
  financier, prudent and careful; but the Malayan tapir here is a giddy young
  person who makes the money fly. See his short white covert coat, with the
  little black bobtail visible below it, and note his vacant eye. How badly he
  wants a crook-handled stick and a high collar! But you may despise the tapir,
  his restless ambition, and his immature trunk as you please&mdash;all your
  contempt will be reciprocated, and with interest. He is almost the only
  animal here who knows that sightseers don't usually carry about with them his
  particular sort of food, and he is, therefore, loftily indifferent to the
  tenderest blandishments.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag24-12.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>He despises you for having neither trunk nor tusks; in his matured
  philosophy, only an elephant is admirable; as a baby, he admires the zebra
  and tries to be one of them. And so he lives here, in house number sixty,
  equidistant between the zebras and the elephants, and as likely to become one
  as the other. Though he could ensure his juvenile stripes being fast colours
  (which he cannot), the tapir would fail as a zebra in the hinder end. The
  docility of the zebra's head he might easily attain to&mdash;indeed, he has
  it now&mdash;but the inconsistent friskiness of his heels would be beyond
  him.</p><br>

  <p>There are a good many fine points about the porcupine. Church, the keeper,
  once got half a-dozen of them in his calf, and went to bed for a week to
  celebrate the occasion. The porcupine is one of those animals that look
  pleasantest from the front. There his bristles all lie back smoothly from his
  forehead, giving him an aspect as aesthetically and Wildely tame as may be.
  But behind&mdash;well, you get a view of all his fine points. A little
  irritation&mdash;a very little&mdash;brings up his fine points in spiky
  array, as though he were caught from behind in a gale of wind.</p><img src=

        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration"><br>

  <p>There are no Irish porcupines, which is remarkable when you consider that,
  in a fight, the porcupine invariably advances backward, most valorously
  retreating to the front in pursuit of the enemy to which he turns his back,
  and pressing forward courageously to the rear. That is to say, in a manner
  less mixed, that the porcupine always attacks an enemy by springing backward
  at him, with spines extended.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag24-16.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>He has a tremendous set of teeth, like chisels, but these he never uses
  except to chew up timber with. He will never fight with his teeth, being
  apprehensive of a punch on the nose, where he is tender. But in his advance
  to the rear he is formidable, and wonderfully quick. I have already mentioned
  Church's experience. The night is the time of the porcupines' greatest
  activity, and then they are apt to fight, springing backward at one another,
  losing quills and tearing out specimen lumps of anatomy at a terrific rate.
  In the daytime the porcupine is not an active creature. He drags himself
  clumsily along with his armament rattling behind him, taking no more trouble
  than to glance at Church on the chance of a donation of the adamantine
  biscuits and similarly inflexible food that most delights him, and receiving
  disappointment or the refreshment with equal equanimity.</p>

  <p class="first">THE ANTELOPE is bovine&mdash;in its own scientific way. It
  belongs to one sub-tribe of the bovina, while the respectable cow of our
  native dairy belongs to another; therefore, herein the antelope and the
  relations of the ox are spoken of together. The greatest of all the bovina in
  these Gardens&mdash;the Bos, in fact, if one may make a Yankee-Latin
  pun&mdash;is Jack, the American bison.</p>

  <p class="first">There is a deal of beef behind Jack's skin, and dear beef,
  for here will never again be seen such another bison as Jack, and he is worth
  a deal of money. The bison which once paved the prairies with many miles of
  beef is now all but extinct&mdash;soon will be.</p>

  <p class="first">Jack is not as friendly as he might be. I cannot claim to
  have slapped jack on the back, as I have slapped many creatures that may seem
  wilder than any mere cattle. As a matter of sober truth, Jack is about the
  most dangerous brute in the place.</p>

  <p>In the course of the preparation of this paper he has been found a
  disconcerting animal to sketch&mdash;if the attempt be made from the door of
  his residence, while he takes his walks abroad in his front garden. For he
  has strong opinions in the matter of trespass, and turns them over in his
  mind as he stalks past, afterwards communicating them to the trespasser by
  sundry glares of the eye, brandishings of the tail, sudden approaches of the
  spacious countenance, and threatening snorings; so that often the trespasser
  is fain to fall in with Jack's opinions suddenly, and get out without wasting
  time on ceremony or picking things up.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag25-07.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Jack is not amiable, even to relations. It is all a matter of space. Among
  his other strong opinions Jack has one, especially strong, on the question of
  adequate breathing and exercise area for a healthy bull. Anything smaller
  than the space here at his disposal he regards as unhealthy for more than one
  animal, and is apt to maintain his opinion by indisputable demonstration.
  Place him with another animal in a restricted space, and you will at once
  perceive that the arrangement is extremely unhealthy&mdash;for the other
  animal. Jack puts down his head, and in a very little while his companion
  will probably be found dead from overcrowding. The most fatal sort of
  overcrowding I know of is Jack's.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag25-08.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"

  <p>His front garden is of a size that satisfies his notions, and he willingly
  allows the presence of Nell, his spouse, and a calf; but if either of these
  ventured into his private sanctum behind, she would be overcrowded to a pulp
  in five minutes.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag25-09.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p class="first">Jack's outline&mdash;if you for­get the tail&mdash;is grand,
  but his constant attitude of readi­ness to deal with a question of
  overcrowding gives him an air of clerkly and impartial attention,
  ignominiously sug­gestive of the Civil Service. His shaggy head, though,
  inclines him more to the aspect of the sham Bohemian. Still, however his
  appearance may strike the individual fancy, there is no doubt possible of the
  fact that he is for ever absorbed in profound meditation. Mere questions of
  air-space and overcrowding, I am convinced, affect him with only a passing
  interest.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag25-10.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>In general he is pathetically brooding, with bowed head, over his nearly
  approaching extinction. Not that extinction is an unpleasant fate&mdash;for
  is it not a rare and envied dignity? But he laments that he will drag into
  nothingness with him the last fragments of the old joke about the Indian
  resolved on skinning the bison to make his wigwam, and the bison making the
  Indian's wig warm without waiting to be skinned. Jack's fore-end is by far
  more imposing to look at than the rest of him. He has neat, well-bred legs,
  and his steely muscles fill his skin well; but that skin is a threadbare
  piece of upholstery, and the nap only adheres in scanty patches.</p>

  <p>I would respectfully suggest to the authorities that a new skin for Jack
  (of good quality and permanent nap) be included in the next estimate for
  repairs.</p>

  <p>If, at the same time, the question of a new tail were considered,
  something would have been paid of the large debt of gratitude owing to the ox
  tribe for the many things&mdash;shoe-leather, horn coat-buttons, some part of
  what we buy for milk, ox-tail soup, beef-tea, and bull's-eyes&mdash;that it
  gives to suffering humanity.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag25-11.gif"

  small fitting long ago, and now it presents a ludicrous want of balance with
  the opposite end. The commonest pump is better off.</p><img src=

  connubial thrashing. Fortunately her husband is somewhere far away in
  Asia&mdash;and a truculent despot he probably is.</p>

  <p>For tearfully and mournfully as his ill-used spouse regards you, it would

  resembling the nylghai, whose repartee to any ill-considered joke is apt to
  take the form of an awkward drive in the ribs.</p>

  <p>The nylghai is a well-groomed looking fellow, who perpetually chews the
  cud at double express speed, as though engaged in a perpetual match for the
  ruminating championship.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag25-20.gif"

  <p>But the low-comedy merchant <i>par excellence</i> of this department is
  the bubaline antelope. His hoofs spread out before his shins like the long
  boots of the dancing nigger, his horns are of the loudest
  thunder-and-lightning pattern, his ears are of the wildest donkey-design, his
  head is that of a cheap tack-hammer, and his nose&mdash;but, there; there is
  no describing that nose&mdash;it puts the ant-eater to shame.</p>

  <p>His bodily frame­work asserts itself through the in­adequate skin in
  ostentatious lumps and cor­ners; as though about half of the bones had been
  sent home too large, with the skin originally intended for something
  two-thirds the bubaline's size.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag25-22.gif"
        style="margin-right:5%; float:right"

  <p>The bubaline antelope is the quadruped embodiment of the Misfit as an
  institution. And he is hopelessly, lamentably innocent and unconscious of his
  eccentricities! Small boys stand before his den and scream with laughter; the
  bubaline looks at them with a mild and grieved surprise.</p>

  <p>He has heard hundreds of visitors laugh like that, and could never
  understand why it was done. What can it be? Any animal with a sense of humour
  would at least cover up that nose.</p>

  <p>Over in the house where once the giraffes lived, solemnly ruminate the
  stately zebus. The zebu is a grand piece of scenery, and looks as though it
  might carry with it some excellent cuts of beef. But it is not active, and
  only its ears betray the fact that the whole thing is not stuffed. And those
  ears bob and flap solemnly as though worked by some concealed official behind
  with a long string.</p><br>

  <p class="first">NOW, after I have classified and displayed many things in a
  system of confusion proper to my want of design, at the end there remain many
  old friends, from the woolly llama that lives by Tom, the white camel, to the
  vagrant mouse that steals pinches of the porcupine's dinner. Some are in the
  catalogue, many are not.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag26-02.gif"

  <p>There is an old horse that drags a refuse cart, and, having been here for
  years, is past all surprising. He would plod past a two-headed dragon, or a
  unicorn with a fiery tail, in the same state of calmness in which he plods
  past Jim the rhinoceros or Jack the bison. Far different is it with the
  venerable canal horses that tramp resignedly by the Regent's Canal, where it
  cuts the Gardens in two. They see nothing, for that costs a shilling, and the
  Society spend many shillings in fences; but they hear, and most of all they
  hear the parrots when they hang out for an airing on a warm day.</p><img src=

  <p>There is a wicked old blue macaw&mdash;a fine, big fellow, whose name
  should be Blue Peter&mdash;who tricks the unhappy canal horses all day;
  shouting "Wo&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;o!" at the top of his voice, and chuckling
  with unholy delight when the angular victim welcomes the opportunity for a
  rest.</p>

  <p>Some creatures there are that are uncatalogued because they hold official
  positions. Such are Nell, Church's terrier, divers cats, and the matronly old
  hens that hatch out eggs for rarer birds. The fat importance of one old
  Cochin hen and the tremendous number and thickness of her garments make out a
  complete claim on her behalf to be called Mrs. Gamp. Mrs. Gamp's must be a
  life of surprises.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag26-04.gif"

  <p>For a respectable suburban hen of the strictest propriety and the most
  regular and orderly habits is naturally surprised when a long and
  conscientious sitting results in a brood of spindly cranes or an
  ear-splitting choir of laughing jackasses. It shocks her sense of the proper
  and respectable, and confuses her orderly intellect. For in her suburban
  intelligence what is eccentric is disreputable, and so she trots about
  distracted, half afraid of her family and half of the gallinaceous Mrs.
  Grundy. The life is undermining her nervous system. No hen's nervous system
  will stand an eternal uncertainty as to whether a particular egg will turn to
  a thing all beak, or a thing all legs, or a thing to swim, a thing to run, or
  a thing to fly; with a reserve possibility that it may turn to a snake or a
  lizard. There is dignity in Mrs. Gamp's official position, I grant; but it is
  a wearing work, hatching out a perpetual succession of
  nightmares.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag26-06.gif"

  <p>In the Zoo you may find curiosities on both sides of the bars. On the
  human side there are, at least, as many as on the other. Maybe a company of
  sailors, who go to a show for a laugh, and guffaw conscientiously at
  everything, to the intense scandal of the serious creatures, like Bob the
  Bactrian and most of the owls: or a worthy group of country cousins, each
  brimming over with perfect ignorance of any animal more recondite than a cow,
  and imparting their misinformation to each other with great freedom and
  confidence. The intelligent foreigner comes here, too, in those peculiar felt
  and straw hats that only he knows how to get; hats often with little cockades
  of feathers stuck in the sides of the bands. He begins at house number one,
  and solemnly and diligently broods over each animal in succession, to the
  very last in house sixty-four.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag26-07.gif"

  <p>He is fat of face, and usually wears spectacles. Also there is the unhappy
  elementary school, sternly marshalled in a trotting column and dragged neck
  and crop through the grounds for the enlargement of their information and the
  improvement of their beraddled minds; whom the unbending schoolmaster impels
  over the gravel paths at the pace calculated to get them out of the gate
  within the time allowed for their free visit; and whose precise acquisitions
  in zoology on the run, and impressions of the whole business in general, one
  would rather like to analyze.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag26-08.gif"

  <p>But pre-eminent, perkiest, cheekiest of all things not in the catalogue,
  is the sparrow. He flies casually to and fro among wolves, tigers, and
  leopards, with an airy confidence and self-sufficiency that nothing bigger
  than a sparrow can imitate.</p>

  <p>He drops in casually on Tom, the big tiger, as he takes his afternoon nap
  in his back-yard, and bounces to and fro under Tom's nose, discussing
  zoological politics on a footing of perfect equality, and disturbing Tom's
  nap.</p><br>

  <p>Feeling his vast importance, and quite recognising the principle that his
  exalted position carries with it certain social duties which he must not
  neglect, he makes a flying call on Duke, the Nubian lion, and patronizes him
  with the proper grace, suggesting various impossible alterations in regimen
  by way of improving Duke's digestion and mending his temper.</p><img src=

  <p class="first">He hops across the Gar­dens and discusses the prospects of
  the hay-crop with Jim the rhinoceros, who is dietetically interested in the
  matter; then, having swaggered past the retiring mice who assume a residuary
  interest in Jim's dinner, he hangs about a little at a bar&mdash;partly
  because it is the nobby thing, and partly because of the crumbs&mdash;and so
  across Regent's Park and off to a cricket match at Lord's.</p>

  <p>But there are creatures that have not been spoken of in these pages, yet
  still have respectable positions in the catalogue.</p><img src=

  <p>Instance the llamas and guanacos. I am not fond of the guanaco. He
  spits&mdash;and with an accurate aim. Take care how you rouse the ire of the
  guanaco, for he spits suddenly and without warning. You may rouse his ire in
  many hundreds of thousands of ways. By wearing a peculiar hat or an ordinary
  hat; walking quietly or with a swagger, or running or sitting or standing
  still; by speaking, shouting, or remaining silent, or by existing in the same
  world; and, his ire roused, he promptly spits, while Tom, the wicked old
  white camel next door, looks on with delighted approval. He would spit
  himself if he could, but prefers biting.</p><br>

  <p>Then there is the secretary bird, with his many quills and his smart, War
  Office air. He has caused many a pitched zoological battle over the question
  whether he is a stork or a hawk; and his own battles with snakes cover him
  with glory and fill him with snake. He struts smartly about, plainly a
  secretary who knows his business and will stand no nonsense. There are all
  the stags, finest and largest and most disdainful of all being the wapiti.
  But a stag is always in a preliminary and incipient state of weeping, in
  spite of his assumption of "side," and until he becomes venison is really an
  uninteresting creature. Some day, perhaps, he wil properly make up his mind
  and have a good cry and get it over.</p><img src="1500391h-images/ZigZag26-16.gif"
        style="float:left"

        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Then he may turn his mind to something else and take a worthy position in
  society. As it is, the stag at best, if he has any definite character at all,
  is a hypocrite. He poses as the beautiful, mild, benig­nant, timid, loving
  and oppressed creature, and is at heart a savage. Worthy and well-meaning
  people, with soft hearts and heads of blubber, sob and squeal because he is
  hunted. He is such a darling, timid, trustful creature, say they, and to hunt
  him is the act of cowardly brutality.</p>

  <p>Now, I challenge any of these kind people to approach a group of the
  mildest park deer, any day late in August, select a quiet-looking buck, and
  attempt, in the most friendly way, to pat or stroke him. I am not particular
  as to the sort of deer&mdash;big red deer or little roebuck&mdash;but I hope
  the challenge won't be accepted, because the worthy adventurer will probably
  experience a dig in the ribs that will cause him a ride home on a hurdle. I
  say nothing of wilder deer. <i>Verb. sat sap.</i> Still, the stag is a
  characterless creature. There is even more character in the yak, just
  opposite, mild creature as it is, with its old womanish air of coddling in
  its black silk shawl, and its pathetic grunt.</p><img src=

  <p>Also there are the Barbary wild sheep, who turn up in all sorts of
  unexpected corners of the place. There is something truculently timid,
  savagely mild, about the name of the Barbary wild sheep. It begins like
  thunder and dies away like a zephyr. It reminds one of Sidney Smith's
  lethally-preaching Wild Curates.</p>

  <p>But behold, I have forgotten some of the most noble of the uncatalogued;
  chief among them Nell, Church's fox-terrier, who (herself and her numerous
  descendants) makes deadly war on the uncatalogued, unhoused, uninvited
  undesired rats, themselves a large part of the population of this place, and
  as destructive. An excellent official is Nell, honest, diligent, and with
  quick jaws.</p>

  <p>But no less worthy in their way are the regiment of battle-scarred cats,
  terrors among mice and rats both. Chief among these is Mr. Toots, of the
  camel-house, the intimate friend of Bob the Bactrian; and the elephant-house
  cat and the ostrich-house cat occupy high positions. But many a stout heart
  beats quicker at the smell of mouse beneath the fur of the more obscure rank
  and file of the uncatalogued cats.</p>
