  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was two o'clock in the afternoon of the last Thursday in
  September, opening day of the autumn term.</p>

  <p>The weather was unseasonably sultry, and the air in Dr Milton (Tubby)
  Forrester's lecture-arena lay as inert and stale as the cadavers in the grim
  old anatomical laboratory adjoining.</p>

  <p>But if the atmosphere of the dingy little theatre was not refreshingly
  tonic it was emotionally tense. Whatever it lacked in sweetness it made up in
  stress; for Anatomy, under the brilliant but irascible Forrester, was reputed
  to be the stiffest course in the entire four-year curriculum.</p>

  <p>Hopeful of being credited at the outset with the flimsy virtue of
  punctuality, the exceptionally large class of new medical students&mdash;one
  hundred and thirty-three; all men, this year, but eight&mdash;had assembled
  with the nervous promptness of first-time voyagers boarding a ship.</p>

  <p>As for the personnel of the class, less than half were newly graduated
  from the main body of the State University only a mile distant. The rest of
  them had recently received their degrees&mdash;Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor
  of Science&mdash;in colleges of various rating, scattered all the way from
  the Alleghenies to the Coast. A few of the more gregarious imports had nodded
  and exchanged casual civilities in the Registrar's quarters, earlier in the
  day; but everyone felt himself a stranger in this unfamiliar setting; even
  the men who had been living for a quadrennium within a ten minutes' walk of
  the Medical College campus.</p>

  <p>But no matter from how near or far they had come, there wasn't a person
  present this afternoon, in Tubby Forrester's amphitheatre, who had not heard
  the dismaying legends of his impatience, his arrogance, his bad temper, his
  noisy tantrums. And yet it was largely on account of Tubby that most of them
  had decided to study medicine here. Tubby was mean as the devil, but he knew
  his stuff. Not only was he an anatomist of high distinction but a recognized
  authority on neurological surgery. His office walls were covered with
  impressive certificates of kudos bestowed by medical schools and renowned
  scientific societies, tributes embossed on vellum in four languages.</p>

  <p>In not many medical colleges did the novice have access to such talented
  supervision in his early adventures with Anatomy. Tubby maintained that if a
  man had a natural flair for the subject his gift would show up promptly. He
  was ever on the alert for budding genius in this field. To his colleagues on
  the faculty he had confided that he was on a still hunt for potential
  anatomists who had the makings of neurological surgeons.</p>

  <p>The ordinary, run-of-the-mine medical matriculate did not pause to reflect
  that he might be better off in a school where mediocrity was treated with
  more patience. The big thing was to earn a diploma bearing Tubby's
  distinguished autograph. Even a very small and useless spoon achieved some
  dignity if the word "Sterling" was stamped on its handle.</p>

  <p>But it could not be said that any of the ungifted had been deceived into
  the error of casting his lot with this great man. Tubby made no bones about
  the fact that he was interested only in the upper tenth. His attitude toward
  the large majority of his students was contemptuous and contemptible. His
  savage sarcasms stung them until their very souls were afire with hate and
  their eyes burned with defenceless fury. Hundreds of practising
  physicians&mdash;ranging in age from thirty-five to fifty, and in locale from
  the Lakes to the Gulf and from Sea to Sea&mdash;were proud to be able to say
  that they had had their Anatomy under Forrester, but they invariably added
  that Tubby was a brute, and many with better memories for the indignities
  they had suffered at his hands referred to him in terms much more unpleasant
  than that.</p>

  <p>This afternoon, with ample time and a suitable environment for morbid
  meditation, the new class sat in the steeply ascending semicircular rows of
  creaking seats, resting their forearms on the battered desks, scowling at
  their fidgeting fingers or absently thrumming the corners of their virgin
  notebooks. Occasionally they lifted an apprehensive glance toward the door
  leading from Tubby's office. The early Christian martyrs waiting in the arena
  for the lions' cage to open may have had at least the consolation that their
  impending discomfort would be brief. There would be four years of Tubby
  Forrester.</p>

  <p>Tradition held that the first session with this erratic bully was
  guaranteed to be a highly interesting entertainment, provided you were not of
  the dozen or more who would be singled out, stood up on their feet, and given
  a chance to make or break themselves irrevocably in a preliminary skirmish
  where it was dangerous to be witty and a disaster to be dull.</p>

  <p>Customarily he opened his address by referring to this meeting as "The
  Acquaintance Hour"&mdash;a phrase that was expected to fetch a sardonic
  chuckle, for it was with such verbal lollipops that the University churches
  and the "Y" angled for new student patronage. Irreverent as Satan, Tubby
  loved to toy derisively with these ingratiating clichés of organized
  altruism. But by the end of "The Acquaintance Hour" all the subtlety of his
  mockeries would have been abandoned, and you would have had a taste of the
  real thing you had let yourself in for when you signed up for Anatomy under
  Forrester.</p>

  <p>"If you have to be petted and patted," he would growl, "join the
  Glad-handers' Club, or the Back-slappers, or the Well-wishers. If you find
  that your system demands more sugar, there are plenty of institutions in this
  locality where you may have it for much less than the asking. They will teach
  you how to be as friendly as a wet dog. Tea will be served, songs will be
  sung, charades will be played. If you want your boots licked, they will do it
  for you. But don't expect any of that nonsense here! This edifice has been
  dedicated to Science. Here we strive to be precise in our research; honest in
  our nomenclature. If you are a jackass you will have to go elsewhere to be
  deceived into the belief that you are a zebra."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>He was entering now from his office. Ten minutes overdue, he marched with
  jerky-gaited pomposity to the waist-high table that served as his desk. This
  table, mounted on large rubber-tyred casters and topped with a two-inch
  marble slab, was six feet three in length by three feet wide; and you didn't
  have to be a medical student to guess what use was made of it when it wasn't
  acting as Tubby's lectern.</p>

  <p>The class brought itself to rigid attention as the steely eyes
  comprehensively surveyed the well-filled theatre. There was no need of
  building up any dramatic suspense here, but Tubby coolly looked the crowd
  over for a long moment while with both hands he rhythmically tugged at the
  platinum watch-chain spread across his ample abdomen, a disquieting gesture
  that suggested the whetting of a carving-knife.</p>

  <p>"Dear Christian Friends," he began, clipping his words. A general grin
  testified that Tubby was measuring up to the picture of him that everyone had
  conceived. "This," said the attitude of the class, "is the fellow. No doubt
  of that. Hard-boiled, all right. A nine-minute egg."</p>

  <p>"It is indeed a pleasure," railed Tubby, "to welcome so goodly a number to
  our Acquaintance Hour. Among those who have preceded you through these
  charming halls, to take up the arduous activities of the most ancient
  profession&mdash;save one&mdash;some may have told you that in this snug
  little theatre, and the more commodious workshop adjacent, we are just one
  happy family, loving one another all the day long." He paused to let this
  mockery soak in and collect its wages in knowing sniffs and dry chuckles. His
  penetrating gaze raked the rows, tier by tier; a darting glance that dared
  you to withhold your tribute to his mordant wit. His attitude was that of a
  peeved sergeant inspecting a squad with the hope of discovering a loose
  button.</p>

  <p>The pause was alarmingly lengthened. Midway of the top row, Tubby's
  sweeping search rested for an instant, carried on to the end of the row,
  returned to the middle, and concentrated upon a face that was quite unaware
  of the inquisition. There was a dead silence, but the inattentive one had
  failed to notice the ominous break in Tubby's address, apparently unaware
  that he was under fire.</p>

  <p>Presently the sour flippancies were resumed, but they lacked their
  previous finesse. Tubby was not intentionally pulling his punches, but they
  hadn't the old steam back of them. Again and again his gaze shot truculently
  to the centre of the top row where it had met that impassive profile. It was
  a lean, strong, determined face, the features clean-cut as an image on a
  coin, and as immobile. The lips were in repose but not compressed: they did
  not denote animosity or disapproval. Had they been primly puckered into an
  evidence of hostility Tubby would have been better satisfied. He would give
  the offended beggar another wallop: give him something to be sore about. But
  these lips were not registering distaste; not registering anything but
  unconcern. The deep-set eyes which Tubby had tried vainly to command were
  vaguely exploring a far corner of the neglected room where a soot-smudged
  wall met a discoloured ceiling. It was obvious that the insufferable fellow
  either wasn't listening at all or felt that what he was hearing did not rate
  his respectful attention.</p>

  <p>Tubby's speech, stridently satirical, scrambled on through the deep mud
  with heavy boots. Every man in the class&mdash;but one&mdash;sensed that an
  impious hand had been laid upon the halter of the professor's goat, but
  nobody's curiosity was urgent enough to risk a craning of the neck. The
  instinct of self-preservation was very active here, to-day.</p>

  <p>The corrosive ironies continued for a few minutes, but Tubby was tiring of
  this mood. His tone and tempo changed abruptly. He patted his damp brow with
  a large white handkerchief, smiled briefly, endeavoured to be playful,
  repeated&mdash;as if it were original&mdash;the old joke about
  specialization. "If you must specialize," he said, "go in for Dermatology,
  for your patients will never get well and they will never die and they will
  never get you up at night." And everybody laughed at this but one man, the
  obnoxious chap in the top row who&mdash;if he had heard a word of this
  ancient wheeze&mdash;was probably saying to himself that it would be impolite
  to laugh at a joke so weighted with infirmity. Damn the bounder! Tubby
  couldn't remember ever having been so befuddled. Again he came to a full
  stop, changed his gears, lowered his tone, became sincere. He talked of the
  doctor's life in unexpected phrases of forthright honesty. Properly viewed,
  he said earnestly, it was not an occupation but a vocation, a life-commitment
  rather than a livelihood, an obsession rather than a profession.</p>

  <p>"You will quickly classify yourselves into the categories where&mdash;by
  native gift and intention&mdash;you properly belong. You will do that in the
  course of your first year. According to our statistics, fifteen per cent of
  you are so dull and lazy that you will be fired&mdash;for the sake of the
  College, the public, and yourselves. Fifty per cent of you will make passing
  grades and receive degrees and diplomas. What you lack in talent and skill
  you may compensate with a pleasant bedside manner. Relying more upon
  sentimentality than scientific knowledge, you may possibly earn twice as much
  by the administration of sympathy and aspirin as your contemporaries who may
  be twice as well informed.</p>

  <p>"These two groups will account for sixty-five per cent of you. A quarter
  of the class will turn out to be better than average students; better than
  average doctors. You will do your work as well as you can, according to the
  light that is in you, and you will deserve credit for this fidelity.</p>

  <p>"Of the remaining ten per cent&mdash;the top ten per cent&mdash;it is
  conceivable that there might develop something quite promising. Don't bank on
  it&mdash;but it might happen.</p>

  <p>"I do not know, to-day, who you are&mdash;you of this interesting ten per
  cent. Perhaps you, yourselves, do not know. I venture a word with you at this
  time. This counsel is not intended for sluggards, trimmers, time-servers, or
  potential quacks; nor is it meant for the merely competent, however honest
  and industrious they may be. I am speaking now to the candidates for rating
  in the top tenth."</p>

  <p>He glanced up, rather negligently, toward the upper tier, and found
  himself looking squarely into a pair of ice-blue eyes that might easily have
  been related to his own. He drew a dry smile, and went on.</p>

  <p>"And it is to be hoped," added Tubby&mdash;as an after-thought in defining
  his restricted audience&mdash;"it is to be hoped that no apathetic
  day-dreamer, who may have sat here in a coma until now, will too
  optimistically identity himself as a divinely ordained member of this
  privileged minority."</p>

  <p>It was very quiet. The class felt that Tubby had paid off somebody for
  inattention. The mystery concerning the professor's serious disconcertment
  was now cleared up. Everybody hoped the affair was a closed incident. The
  constraint had been annoying.</p>

  <p>"You of the top tenth," continued Tubby, "will very soon become aware of
  your rating. You will not have to wait until you see your grades at the close
  of the term.</p>

  <p>"One of the most frequent mistakes made, in classroom admonitions, is the
  teacher's fatuous promise to his disciples that diligent application is a
  guarantee of the student's success. It goes without saying, of course, that
  the student who does his work to the best of his ability has more to show for
  the time he has spent in school than the sluggard. But the persons who
  comprise the upper tenth of the class must have much more to offer than mere
  diligence, however praise-worthy is their honest industry.</p>

  <p>"There is a homely adage, customarily quoted with a smile, which
  discourages any attempt to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. This is far
  from funny. It is tragic. In the course of my experience here, I have been an
  unwilling auditor of classroom work sincerely performed by young men and
  women who had no natural gifts for this undertaking. Perhaps they might have
  succeeded brilliantly in some other quest: I do not know. But&mdash;no matter
  how hard they worked&mdash;they had no chance of achieving distinction. They
  were biologically ineligible. It was not their fault; it was their
  misfortune.</p>

  <p>"In a much smaller number of cases, we have had students who gave early
  promise of future success, but lacked the courage to invest themselves
  whole-heartedly in their work. They were good for the hundred-yard dash, but
  they hadn't the wind required to do a mile; much less a marathon.</p>

  <p>"Now it might be supposed that my next statement should extol the happy
  combination of brains and diligence; and these are, indeed, a promising pair
  of success-factors. But the upper tenth needs something more. The price of
  diligence is self-discipline. Concentration upon your work necessarily
  demands a resolute avoidance of time-wasting and distracting frivolity. You
  are quite aware of that. And it is a mere platitude to say that if you wish
  to get anywhere in preparing for this profession, you must give yourself
  utterly to your job.</p>

  <p>"But that is not all. Self-discipline, in the opinion of the moralist, is
  always worth what it costs. And perhaps there is something to be said in
  favour of the martyr, who, by living a sacrificial, self-controlled life,
  earns credits negotiable in some other, better world beyond the sky. I am not
  an authority on that subject. But self-discipline, practised for the purpose
  of leaving one free to do one's chosen work, fails of its performance if one
  pursues it at the cost of very much fretting and conscious effort.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, there will be occasional days when the collar will gall you.
  No matter how well you have yourself in hand, there will be times when the
  animal that is in you clamours for its rights. But if you find yourself in a
  continuous running fight with your appetites&mdash;to the extent that your
  mind is constantly disturbed&mdash;your sacrifices will not justify their
  expense.</p>

  <p>"This leads me to say that the self-discipline of the upper ten per cent
  must be&mdash;for the most part&mdash;effortless and automatic. And it may
  become so, very quickly, if the claims of your vocation loom larger than the
  urgency of your physical desires. When the job becomes important enough to
  warrant your membership in the fortunate ten per cent, the outside
  distractions will not worry you."</p>

  <p>Tubby's voice had lowered to a conversational tone. It was almost as if he
  were having a heart-to-heart with a single individual in the privacy of a
  confidential interview. The class sat poised, deeply attentive. The silence
  would have been broken by a pin-drop. The cognitive little eyes drifted to
  the upper row of the amphitheatre. The blondish young athlete who had ruined
  "The Acquaintance Hour" was leaning far forward in his seat, with his elbows
  on his knees and his fists supporting a firm chin. His eyes were intent, his
  lips compressed. Tubby frowned, and continued.</p>

  <p>"Out of this top tenth of the class, almost anything is likely to emerge.
  One never knows what may come forth from this exclusive group. Sometimes we
  run along for years, in this Medical College, without observing the rise of a
  student who promises to make an important contribution. Once in a blue moon,
  the upper tenth delivers to Medical Science an explorer, a discoverer, a
  trail-blazer."</p>

  <p>Tubby's next sentence sent a thrill through the closely integrated
  audience. You could feel it bang at your heart and magnetize your spine. You
  not only felt it yourself, but you knew that everybody else&mdash;to a
  degree&mdash;was experiencing this sensation.</p>

  <p>"Is there anyone here," asked Tubby, impressively, "who will tell
  us&mdash;some day&mdash;what we want to know about cancer?... Will one of
  you&mdash;some day&mdash;give us a prophylaxis for infantile paralysis? The
  two important gentlemen who are to perform these feats are&mdash;if I may
  venture the prediction&mdash;already born. May I be still more hopeful and
  hazard the guess that they are already of age? It may be that they are
  experienced scientists, now on the eve of their discoveries. It may be that
  they are students in some medical school." Tubby paused. The class sat
  transfixed, welded into one solid chunk. "These two men," declared Tubby, in
  a tone so low as to be barely audible&mdash;"these two men may be in this
  room&mdash;<i>now!</i>"</p>

  <p>He suddenly booted them out of their hypnosis. He tugged out his watch,
  shuffled his thick sheaf of registration papers, shifted his stance to the
  end of the autopsy table. His face lighted a little with a smile that
  suggested he was going to be funny again. The class straightened its back and
  drew a long breath, the first long one it had felt the need of for some time.
  Nobody looked at his neighbour. Nobody wanted anyone else to know how deeply
  he had been stirred. Tubby had gone at it again in another mood.</p>

  <p>"And now," he was saying, "to all of you&mdash;regardless of your various
  ratings, regardless of what you are or may become, I charge you that the
  study and practice of medicine and surgery is a scientific pursuit to be
  approached with much the same attitude as you might undertake a post-graduate
  course in Geology. Keep your emotions out of it, and give your brains a
  chance. The less sentiment you apply to this enterprise, the better will be
  your workmanship. I have often thought of suggesting to my peers,"
  extemporized Tubby, "that at least one year's internship should be spent in a
  veterinary hospital where the young medical student might pursue his work
  without the emotional interference of the patient's family."</p>

  <p>This, thought the weary class, was very good indeed. Tubby gave them all a
  chance to laugh merrily. Even the face in the upper tier broke into a grin.
  But it was far, far too late for this young Rip Van Winkle to wake up and
  take an interest. It wouldn't do him very much good now. Tubby sniffed and
  went on.</p>

  <p>"Your present attitude should be that of a researchist seeking exact facts
  about the construction of the human body. Unquestionably there is a place
  where it is in order to consider Shakespeare's apostrophe&mdash;'What a piece
  of work is man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and
  moving, how express and admirable!' But that place is not the anatomical
  laboratory. If you are wise, my Christian Friends, you will leave all that to
  the poets and parsons. It's their job; not yours. Your business is to study
  man as a badly made contraption in need of repair. Whether the human animal
  committed a blunder when&mdash;in the course of his evolution&mdash;he
  resolved to stand on his hind legs and face the world in an upright position,
  is a question I should not presume to discuss in all its phases. Personally,
  I am just as well satisfied not to be walking on all fours. But when this
  animal tipped his viscera from horizontal to perpendicular he incurred a
  flock of disabilities. They begin to show up as soon as he learns to
  walk.</p>

  <p>"You want to keep it in mind," declared Tubby, seriously, "that orthodox
  theology is exactly wrong in its explanation of man's woes. It wasn't Adam's
  fall that caused the trouble: it was his rise. A dog may become so
  sycophantic that he will sit up, now and then, for a moment, just to flatter
  his master by imitation; but he has sense enough not to do it very often or
  for very long. According to the Bible, Eve was sentenced to bear her young in
  pain because she plucked an apple from a tree, in disobedience to a divine
  command. Had she been content to munch the apples that had fallen on the
  ground she could have borne her cubs without risk and without help.</p>

  <p>"All this places you in an indefensible position as a student. Your whole
  training is for the purpose of fitting you to promote the cause of
  civilization. And the more civilization we achieve, the poorer we are,
  physically. Civilization has given us many benefits, no doubt; it has also
  developed habits that have produced defective teeth, defective eyes, ears,
  noses, bronchia. We still have a few of the old glands that were of earlier
  value; now a menace. May I repeat&mdash;you are to study man as a poorly made
  machine that can't even support its own weight for very long at a time, in
  testimony whereof you are all sitting down to ease your freight at age
  twenty-three. By the time you're sixty-three, solicitous relatives will be
  following you about with a chair. You will still have a few years to spend
  here, perhaps. During the course of your career you may have become wise,
  noble, renowned. You will also have had your tonsils removed, and your
  appendix; perchance a kidney. You will be wearing artificial teeth and
  glasses and maybe a gadget to aid your hearing.... I want you to go into
  the anatomical laboratory with the understanding that a great many of the
  things you find out are not as they ought to be. The vital organs were
  originally intended to function in another position. Forget all this prattle
  about man being made in the image of God. If it's true, it's no credit to
  him. Anybody who wants to believe in that sort of thing had better keep out
  of the dissecting room.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;and this should cheer your hearts&mdash;while this anatomical
  laboratory, to which you are shortly to be introduced, is no place to look
  for fragrance or faith or fairy-stories, it is at least honest, which can't
  be said of legislative halls or art galleries or cathedrals. You are here in
  quest of truth. Once a fact is amply attested you are to accept it, no matter
  how ugly it is; no matter how much you wish it wasn't so; no matter how
  violently it collides with what you have previously thought and would still
  prefer to think. And don't make the mistake of imagining that the testimony
  is all in, and on file. Many a scientist, six feet underground, would suffer
  all the agonies of the supposedly damned if he could come forth to-day and
  read some of his own dogmatic remarks, long since reduced to utter nonsense
  by new findings. Remember that until a theory has been disproved&mdash;no
  matter how fantastic it may appear in the light of our current
  knowledge&mdash;it should be accorded the respect due to a proposition that
  might be proved&mdash;sometime."</p>

  <p>Tubby closed this sentence in an impressive tone that signified he had
  said about everything. He looked up, and consulted the face that had annoyed
  him. The eyes were wide with interest. They were intensely aware and deeply
  thoughtful. Tubby didn't care what they thought. He disliked them. The fellow
  needed a trimming. Tossing open a huge portfolio of papers on the autopsy
  table, the professor&mdash;with a flash-back to the earlier mood of studied
  mockery&mdash;drawled: "Now, with your patient indulgence, we will call the
  roll. On this occasion you will stand when your name is spoken, so that I may
  identify you, and also that you&mdash;for purpose of acquaintance&mdash;may
  identify one another....</p>

  <p>"John Wesley Beaven.... Kindly arise, John Wesley, wherever you are,
  and let the congregation see you."</p>

  <p>There was a stir in the top row. Amused faces, at all angles, turned in
  that direction. Seats squeaked and shoes scraped. Everybody was eager to see
  how a stranger might react to this kind of teasing.</p>

  <p>A tall, handsome, Viking sort of fellow had risen and stood waiting
  whatever discourtesies the Medical College had to offer at the hands of its
  witty anatomist. Tubby's little eyes gleamed with satisfaction. He moistened
  his lips with the tip of his tongue while he deliberated the best technique
  of punishment for the bounder who had given him such a bad hour.
  Painstakingly polishing his pince-nez, he consulted the carbon copy of
  Beaven's registration form.</p>

  <p>"I observe, John Wesley, that the first college you attended&mdash;where
  you spent your freshman and sophomore years&mdash;is a righteous little
  institution engaged chiefly in the manufacture and disbursement of Methodist
  preachers. That fact, coupled with your name, leads me to suspect that you
  have come to us from a pious home. We will endeavour to be on our guard
  against the use of any objectionable language in your presence." Tubby waited
  for snickers, but apparently the class was hopeful of seeing a sentiment
  develop in favour of the mercy which almost anyone of them might need before
  the hour was over.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," responded Beaven, respectfully. The class smiled wanly.
  It was evident that Tubby's effort to enlist scorn for the six-foot,
  one-hundred-and-ninety pound newcomer as a tenderly nourished plant had not
  been an entire success. He would dig a little deeper.</p>

  <p>"I assume, John Wesley, that you have thought a great deal about souls.
  There's a standing prize here for any dissection that reveals the former
  presence of a soul&mdash;or any need of a soul to operate the complicated
  machinery of the human body. Perhaps you might like to go in for it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Beaven, unruffled. "How much is it, sir?"</p>

  <p>Tubby wasn't quite ready with a reply to that, and the class laughed
  merrily, hoping that Beaven's counter-query would be accepted in fun.</p>

  <p>"I think we can safely sign the cheque, Mr Beaven, and let you fill in
  your own figures.... Now&mdash;as a son of the true faith, you doubtless
  believe in the resurrection of the body. Do you feel that it is very good
  cricket for you to put your so-called God to the inconvenience of
  reassembling the bodies you expect to hack into bits in our
  charnel-house?"</p>

  <p>Beaven drew a boyishly unaffected smile that spread over the room like a
  contagion.</p>

  <p>"The final mobilization isn't my job, sir," he replied. "I suppose that
  whoever is in charge of it will just have to take them the way he finds
  them."</p>

  <p>The class enjoyed this very much, and shifted amused glances back to the
  pit.</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," said Tubby, dryly. "Perhaps if you had taken time to
  formulate a more clever reply you would have observed that if God could
  create them, he should have no trouble re-creating them."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," agreed John Wesley. The class grinned again, but a bit
  apprehensively. This good-looking beggar had better mind his step, for Tubby
  was getting sore.</p>

  <p>"But you do believe, do you not, Mr&mdash;er"&mdash;Tubby leaned over his
  papers to recover the name&mdash;"Beaven, that on the last day the trumpet
  shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," answered Beaven, after a little delay, "one must be
  open-minded. The theory is rather fantastic, but&mdash;it hasn't been
  disproved yet."</p>

  <p>This brought a general ripple of friendly&mdash;albeit somewhat
  nervous&mdash;laughter. They all rejoiced in Beaven's courage, though
  something warned them that it was sheer foolhardiness. Tubby pretended to
  smile with tight lips.</p>

  <p>"I can see, Brother Beaven, that you believe it. That should be of great
  assistance to you in your anatomical research. There will be occasions, on
  warm days, when you may find comfort in the thought
  that&mdash;eventually&mdash;bodies do become incorruptible."</p>

  <p>The class thought this mildly witty, and chuckled a little. Thus
  encouraged, Tubby regained all of the old arrogance, fixed a scornful gaze on
  his victim, and proceeded with the flogging.</p>

  <p>"When you write home to your pastor, I presume you will inform him that
  you have fallen into a hell-hole of atheism."</p>

  <p>Young Beaven accepted this good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't be surprised."</p>

  <p>"Nor care?" pressed Tubby.</p>

  <p>"Probably not."</p>

  <p>"Not interested in protecting the true faith?" Tubby's widened eyes
  simulated outraged piety.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;not interested in any discussion of Theology that came from a
  Professor of Anatomy."</p>

  <p>The class gasped involuntarily. The fellow was committing suicide.</p>

  <p>Tubby lowered his head until his jowls overlapped his collar. His little
  eyes were metallic.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are inferring that a Professor of Anatomy isn't qualified
  to think or talk about anything else but pickled corpses."</p>

  <p>There was a little pause before Beaven replied, very respectfully, very
  humbly, "I was not inferring anything, sir."</p>

  <p>Without an instant's delay, Tubby leaped into this trap.</p>

  <p>"Oh! Well! Now!" he barked. "Now we are getting somewhere! You would like
  to take that back, eh? Very prudent of you."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you misunderstood me, sir," said Beaven, carefully picking his
  words. "I was not inferring. I was implying. I imply. You infer. Is that not
  correct, sir?"</p>

  <p>So, now, Beaven had finally disposed of himself. If all the reports about
  Tubby as a grudge-carrier were even approximately true, Beaven would never
  live long enough to be forgiven for this unnecessary insult.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Brother Beaven," commented Tubby, with mock deference.
  "Perhaps you would do better if you stuck to your Rhetoric. You may find
  Anatomy difficult. We shall see. You may sit down now, please."</p>

  <p>He hooked on his glasses with nervous fingers, and fussed with his papers.
  The class scowled. The next name was called perfunctorily amid much
  restlessness. Everybody, including Tubby, seemed eager to be done with it. On
  a couple of occasions there was a brief but futile effort to introduce some
  mild pleasantry, but the response was feeble and barely polite.</p>

  <p>"That is all," said Tubby, gruffly.</p>

  <p>He gathered up his papers, thrust them untidily into the big portfolio,
  and stalked stiffly out of the room. Nobody moved until the office-door had
  slammed. Then a surly sibilant escaped, like jets of steam, in various
  quarters of the room; perhaps an involuntary hiss, perhaps the symbol of a
  rough epithet. Tubby Forrester had got off on the wrong foot with his new
  class of medics. From his behaviour it was evident that no one was more aware
  of it than himself.</p>

  <p>They slowly came to their feet, hitched up their trousers, clattered down
  the steps, and funnelled through the hall-door, mostly avoiding one another's
  eyes. Every face recorded dissatisfaction. Anatomy was going to be tough.
  Tubby, at his best, was mean as dirt. Now he had special reasons for being
  testy and relentless. He would probably try to save his face by punishing the
  whole outfit.</p>

  <p>Nobody&mdash;not even the men who had sat adjacent to
  him&mdash;felicitated Beaven on his audacity. Two or three, for sheer
  humanity's sake, grinned amiably, and one chap winked at him, a wooden wink
  copied from the dummy on the knee of a ventriloquist. But almost everyone was
  intent upon his own departure. There was an unexpressed but perceptible
  sentiment to the effect that Beaven was partly to blame for this unhappy
  situation. Tubby had had it coming to him, no doubt; but Beaven would have
  done better to swallow his nasty medicine without any attempt at retaliation.
  His replies to Tubby's impudence were clever enough, but the class seemed to
  feel that Beaven would have been much more clever if he had kept his mouth
  shut.</p>

  <p>And Jack Beaven himself now shared this belief. He felt suddenly outcast.
  For years he had been looking forward with keen interest to his medical
  course. Part of the pleasure he would derive from his associations with other
  young fellows intent upon the same work. Now he had made things difficult for
  himself&mdash;and them. He had made a bad start. He was sorry.</p>

  <p>In the lower corridor, two girls stood talking; possibly waiting for
  another. Jack identified them as members of the class. The pretty brunette he
  remembered specially because she had stirred a bit of welcome entertainment
  at the roll-call. Tubby had called the name, "W. Gillette," adding: "And if
  the 'W' should happen to stand for 'William', we may anticipate some skilful
  deductions at his hands." Then this girl had risen, and everybody was amused.
  And she had carried it off very well, too; hadn't seemed a bit
  embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"The 'W'," observed Tubby, when the ripple of laughter had subsided,
  "probably stands for something else." He was still glum, but trying hard to
  be amiable.</p>

  <p>"My name is Winifred, Doctor Forrester," she had replied easily.</p>

  <p>"Are you intending to put 'W. Gillette, M.D.' on your office-door?" asked
  Tubby.</p>

  <p>Everybody was very quiet. W. Gillette was not hard to look at, and she had
  all the poise in the world. Indeed, if she had had any more poise it might
  easily have been mistaken for brass.</p>

  <p>"I haven't decided, sir. Perhaps you will advise me, when the time
  comes."</p>

  <p>This had brought forth a little patter of discreet applause during which
  Miss Gillette had resumed her seat. There was no further comment from Tubby,
  who apparently felt that the enlivening episode had come to a satisfactory
  conclusion. The fragile smile, with which he had regarded this incident,
  quickly faded.</p>

  <p>The Gillette girl was going to be popular. Jack glanced at her and the
  less physically opulent Miss Reeves as he reached the bottom of the stairs,
  and they gave him a comradely grin. He did not pause to speak. There wasn't
  much to be said. He felt that they would be better served if they did not too
  conspicuously espouse his cause.</p>

  <p>After he had passed through the outer door into the mellow October
  sunshine, he heard his name spoken, and a patter of heels. He paused to find
  the girl at his elbow. She was smiling, and her dimples were very
  attractive.</p>

  <p>"Please don't give it another thought," she said, in the tone of a
  long-time friend. "He'll forget all about it by to-morrow. Everybody is with
  you."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Jack, warmly. "Did I look like a lost dog?"</p>

  <p>"Just a little. But&mdash;I suppose we're all going to feel that way until
  we get acquainted.... Good-bye," she said, with her lips rather than her
  voice. Winifred flashed him another smile of loyalty, and turned to rejoin
  the Reeves person who had overtaken them.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," said Jack, "and thanks, again."</p>

  <p>The friendly overture momentarily brightened his spirits. It also
  perplexed him slightly. Perhaps the Gillette girl's audacity was prompted by
  an impulsive wish to cheer him up. She had indicated that she, too, was
  lonesome. Was that a bid for some social attention? Maybe not. At least she
  was entitled to the benefit of the doubt. He hoped he hadn't seemed to lack
  appreciation of her cordiality. He rather wished he had been a little more
  gracious. Mightn't he have said: "I'll be seeing you"&mdash;or something like
  that&mdash;instead of an unadorned "Good-bye"?</p>

  <p>Tubby's stirring remarks about self-discipline, as an imperative of
  success in the medical profession, had made an impression. Jack had not
  contemplated any personal resolutions; he had been so sore over Tubby's
  insolence, and the wrangle they had had, that the thought of acting on the
  brute's advice&mdash;or even of considering it seriously&mdash;was
  distasteful. He realized, now, that Tubby's stern counsel on this subject had
  gripped him. The first evidence of it was the indifference he had manifested
  toward the girl. At the moment he could not define his reason for failing to
  do his part toward the promotion of their acquaintance. Tubby's command was
  at the bottom of it. Tubby had laid down the simple but savage rules for the
  governance of "the top ten per cent". Not only were they to practise a severe
  self-discipline, but they were to commit themselves to it with such devotion
  that presently it wouldn't hurt, any more. It would become automatic.</p>

  <p>There might be an element of truth in this. Perhaps old Tubby knew. He was
  a bachelor, reputed to be a glutton for work; probably had himself bridled
  and saddled; drove himself with spurs and a curb-bit. The
  earnestness&mdash;the solemnity&mdash;with which he had talked about
  self-discipline couldn't have been a mere theory with him. He had laid it on
  to the potential top ten per cent of the new class as if he were extending
  them monastic vows.</p>

  <p>The appeal was quite thrilling. Perhaps it was worth an honest trial. And
  if you were going to experiment with it, a good time and place to begin was
  now and here. The longer you postponed it, the less likely you would be to
  make the adventure. Jack walked briskly to the street, sensing a curious
  state of maturity suddenly arrived at. He wished someone else than Tubby had
  provided the idea. It was an odd sensation to be so deeply moved by a motive
  that had been growled at you, a recommendation that had been thrust at
  you&mdash;by a man you had good reasons to despise.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>At the next corner, a big fellow waited, grinned, extended a hand; said
  his name was Wollason.</p>

  <p>"You know mine," drawled Jack, with a rather bitter smile. "Tubby kicked
  it around a-plenty." They shook hands from the same height and fell into
  step.</p>

  <p>"You sure trimmed our sassy little Pekinese down to the hide," laughed
  Wollason. "But he can still chew the pants right off o' you."</p>

  <p>Jack nodded, and said he supposed so. Then his steps slowed and he
  quizzically inspected his new friend's face.</p>

  <p>"I say, Wollason, don't we know each other? Aren't you Tony Wollason?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! I was just waiting to see if you would remember. I had a little
  advantage of you. While Tubby was reciting your college background, and
  making fun of your school, I was looking you over."</p>

  <p>"It's all coming back now," said Jack. "You were at left half for Ashburn
  when I was playing right end with Milford. Sophomores, weren't we?"</p>

  <p>"Nineteen," assisted Tony. "The next year I went to Lawrence,
  and&mdash;you went to Evanston, didn't you?... That last game of the
  season was a pretty fast one, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"You and I ought to know," said Jack. "We nearly got put in the dog-house
  for mixing it in the open field. Boy!&mdash;what a shiner you gave me!"</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;they would have put us out of the game, all right, if the
  alumni hadn't protested. It was about the only interesting feature of the
  day&mdash;as I recall it&mdash;and the old boys were appreciative. By the
  way, they never fixed my nose as good as it was before."</p>

  <p>Jack looked at the nose appraisingly.</p>

  <p>"I'll repair it for you, one of these days, just for practice."</p>

  <p>"Like hell you will. You've done that nose all the damage I'm going to
  take off of you. Where are you living, Jack? I haven't found a room yet. Just
  got in this morning from Chicago. Sat up all night. Saving expenses. I still
  eat&mdash;but not to excess."</p>

  <p>"You might like it where I am," suggested Jack. "Rooming-house of long
  standing. Medics. Smells like it, too. But clean enough. Hard-bitten old lady
  named Doyle. She had one room left at noon."</p>

  <p>"How are the beds?"</p>

  <p>"Mine isn't too bad."</p>

  <p>"How many lodgers per bathroom?"</p>

  <p>"You'll be Number Six, I think. How many bathrooms are you accustomed
  to?"</p>

  <p>"Anybody in the house taking piano lessons?"</p>

  <p>"No piano. No saxophone. No small boy."</p>

  <p>"No beautiful daughter, pining for friendship?"</p>

  <p>"No daughter, no friendship," pursued Jack. "No towels, no soap; and, this
  morning, no hot water. They're fixing the heater. Want to come and look? It's
  only four blocks from here."</p>

  <p>Tony nodded, and at a leisurely pace they proceeded up Hill Street.</p>

  <p>"It's none of my business," said Tony, "but what the devil were you trying
  to do to yourself to-day? Don't you know that old Tubby can make things
  mighty rough for you? They say he has the memory of an elephant when it comes
  to paying off old scores."</p>

  <p>Jack pleaded guilty with a self-reproachful frown and a shake of the
  head.</p>

  <p>"You're quite right, Tony. I was a dreadful ass. Haven't any excuse to
  offer. Tumbled into it by accident." He hesitated for a moment, and then went
  on in a tone of confidence. "It's only ten days ago that I was called home by
  the death of my mother. She was a fine example of the old school, in thought
  and behaviour; uncompromisingly orthodox. I didn't share her opinions but I
  respected them for what they meant to her. To-day, when Tubby was taking the
  old traditions for a ride, his smart-alecky manner annoyed me. Under any
  other circumstances, maybe I might have thought he was witty. I knew I ought
  to be chortling over his sour jokes, but I couldn't."</p>

  <p>Tony interposed with a brief proffer of sympathy, and said it was a pity
  that old Tubby hadn't known the facts in the case.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that's what made him mad at me, in the first place," continued
  Jack. "And then, when he began taking me for a ride, I bristled up. I'm
  sorry, now; but he was so damned insolent."</p>

  <p>"How do you suppose he gets away with that stuff?" growled Tony.</p>

  <p>"Because he's a genius."</p>

  <p>Tony shot a quick glance of inquiry, not sure whether this comment was
  ironical. Jack's face was honest.</p>

  <p>"I mean it, Tony. Tubby's the real goods. He's a genius. Maybe that is the
  way you can spot a genius. They're all more or less goofy, unstable,
  conceited, overbearing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;you're thinking about the temperamental artists," interrupted
  Tony. "Everybody expects that of the musicians and painters and such-like
  cissies&mdash;the sensitive boys and gals who have to go out and throw up
  when they see a couple of colours that don't match. But Tubby's a
  scientist."</p>

  <p>"All the same: scientists have had their weak moments, too. It's human
  nature. Even Koch and Pasteur were pretty cocky after so much fuss had been
  made over them. Remember? And Bigelow's fame in surgery didn't prevent him
  from being mean to his subordinates. Tubby can't help it. You see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tony snorted his scorn and hoped Jack wasn't putting Tubby Forrester into
  the same bracket with Koch and Pasteur.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" countered Jack. "It's an acknowledged fact that Forrester is
  one of the most distinguished neurologists of our time. Ask anybody!...
  And&mdash;that isn't quite all, Tony. Didn't you find yourself getting quite
  a kick out of the sentence or two that Tubby fired off&mdash;the only really
  sincere moment in the whole speech&mdash;about self-discipline as the price
  of success in science?"</p>

  <p>Tony chuckled, rather grimly, and said he guessed old Tubby was too damn'
  mean to be approached with any temptations to be frivolous.</p>

  <p>"It would be easy enough for that bird," he added. "Nobody would ever ask
  Tubby to go out on a binge."</p>

  <p>"Maybe not&mdash;now," agreed Jack. "But something tells me that Tubby has
  pursued this programme of hard work and no play&mdash;all his life. And he's
  scouting for candidates who might be eligible to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;to take the veil," sneered Tony. "Well&mdash;not me! I'll do
  my work as well as I can, but I certainly don't intend to be a hermit."
  Jack's rejoinder was so tardy that Tony added: "And I can't picture you in
  that role, either."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Jack, absently, "of course not."</p>

  <p>"Got to have a little fun&mdash;as you go along."</p>

  <p>"Certainly." Jack's tone was moody, preoccupied. He made a little gesture
  toward the ugly brown house on the right. "There," he said, "it is&mdash;such
  as it is."</p>

  <p>Tony regarded the battered old box with a grin, and remarked that if
  anybody should decide to renounce the pleasures of the world in behalf of a
  big idea, this might be an ideal place to locate.</p>

  <p>"I wish you good luck with Tubby," he said, as they turned in toward the
  house. "If you can't get along with him, you may want to take his advice, and
  specialize in English. The little lesson you gave him was a screamer."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have done it. It hurt him. I was hitting him below the belt,
  when I reflected on his scholarship. Nobody should attack him at that point.
  It might slow him up."</p>

  <p>Tony sniffed.</p>

  <p>"Why the hell should you care&mdash;if he was slowed up?"</p>

  <p>"Because"&mdash;Jack's eyes suddenly grew steely&mdash;"I want Tubby to be
  at his best. He has a brilliant mind&mdash;and I want to know what's in it. I
  want him to pour it out by the bucketful...."</p>

  <p>"Sounds as if you were planning to be a greasy grind."</p>

  <p>"I hope it wasn't a priggish remark. I didn't intend it so. But&mdash;if a
  man is going in for medicine, at all, he'd better go in deep, hadn't he? Not
  much point to one's preparing to be a mere hand-holder and crooner. If you're
  going in for a scientific career, you'd better be a scientist, hadn't you? If
  it costs something, you'd better arrange to pay it, shouldn't you? Tubby's
  right&mdash;at that point."</p>

  <p>"You'd better look out," chuckled Tony. "First thing you know, you'll be
  developing into another Tubby; starry bright and mean as hell. See
  here&mdash;I believe you really admire this little pipsqueak!"</p>

  <p>"I admire his mind."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you should let him know that, pretty soon. And he'll forgive
  you."</p>

  <p>"I'd see myself doing that!" growled Jack.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I'm afraid you don't like him."</p>

  <p>"Personally&mdash;I hate him."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was late afternoon, the twenty-fourth of December. All
  day the sky had been heavily overcast and for the past two hours the snow had
  been tumbling down in big wet flakes that gave no promise of remaining to
  provide sport.</p>

  <p>The street-lights in the down-town business district had come on at three.
  Motor-cars churned and slithered and spun their chains in the brown slush as
  they backed away from curbs. Littered shops wearied of their own disorder and
  drooping sales-girls candidly yawned while mumbling praises of their tousled
  merchandise.</p>

  <p>All of the students who could manage it had left three days ago for the
  holiday recess. Only a few of the University buildings on the main campus
  showed lights. The professors were helping their wives decorate small trees
  with baubles and tinsel; performing the rite with dignity and precision, and
  saving the tissue-paper.</p>

  <p>Out in the Medical College zone the streets were almost deserted. There
  was a light in the Bursar's office in the Administration Building, and in the
  anatomical laboratory on the top floor of Lister Hall; but the rest of the
  institution had gone out of business.</p>

  <p>Three of Mrs Doyle's roomers had stayed on. Bugs Cartmell was remaining
  because he had recently acquired a new stepfather and didn't want to go home;
  Tony Wollason, because he lived in Wyoming and couldn't afford to go home;
  Jack Beaven, because he had no home to go to.</p>

  <p>The widow Doyle, tall, gaunt, and grim, who had housed five student
  generations of medics and spoke their patter with amazing fluency, was just
  back from having a chiropractic adjustment for the relief of her sciatica.
  She sat placidly rocking in the bay-window of her small living-room, chewing
  gum and perusing the current issue of her favourite magazine,
  <i>Astrology.</i> Christmas had never disturbed her routine. If parents of
  small children wanted to turn their houses upside down for a week, and litter
  their rooms with pine-needles, all well and good; but Mrs Doyle saw no reason
  for the nuisance and expense of holiday decorations at her house. It had not
  been her policy to coddle her tenants. Some landladies of her acquaintance
  went out of their way to be nice to their students, and a precious lot of
  thanks they got for it. They would prime their pens on your rugs, wipe their
  razors on your towels, and polish their shoes with your curtains, no matter
  how much you pampered them. Mrs Doyle was about as maternal as an
  incubator.</p>

  <p>The house was quiet, dimly lighted, and chilly. Tony, having slept most of
  the day, had gone down town to a movie. Bugs had received by express a bottle
  of bootleg whisky from his elder brother in New York, craftily packed in a
  box marked "storage battery." Having generously planned to share the gift
  with his fellow-lodgers upon their return, he decided to sample it and make
  sure it would be good for them. One couldn't be too careful, these days.
  Confident of its quality, Bugs now observed that his feet were damp.
  Exchanging the shoes for his well-worn moccasins, he padded down to the
  kitchen where he hoarsely requested a pitcher of hot water, a handful of
  sugar cubes, and the loan of the nutmeg shaker.</p>

  <p>Mrs Doyle, who had not served as his chambermaid for two and a third years
  without learning something about his habits, remarked that his cold must have
  come on very suddenly. Sniffing him diagnostically as he stood by her side
  waiting for the kettle to boil she added: "But I don't suppose you'll need a
  doctor." Then she grinned almost archly, as to say that while it was
  certainly none of her business if he wanted to indulge himself a
  little&mdash;seeing it was Christmas 'n' all&mdash;he needn't imagine he was
  putting anything over. Bugs receipted the meaningful smirk with a rather
  rakish smile. No, he wouldn't need a doctor, he said; didn't believe in
  doctors, anyway; if he got too sick he would send for a faith-healer.
  Retiring to his untidy room on the third floor he had presently gone to bed,
  contentedly jingled, with a copy of <i>Arrowsmith,</i> a new novel which was
  said to deal with the medical profession. Some day, he reflected, he would
  write one himself. Nobody would like it, but it would be the truth.</p>

  <p>Beaven had asked permission to work in the anatomical laboratory during
  the Christmas vacation. There was nothing unusual about the request except
  that first-year students were not in the habit of applying for such permits,
  which were mostly issued to seniors doing research on their graduation
  theses. Ordinarily, one asked Tubby's consent. But Jack wasn't seeking
  favours of Tubby, so he had put his request through the Dean's office, a
  procedure strictly in order, and the permission had been formally granted.
  Doubtless Tubby's O.K. had been secured, but Jack had spared himself the
  necessity of a personal interview.</p>

  <p>The relation between the two had been a source of considerable amusement
  and conjecture. The earlier fear that Tubby, exasperated over his
  humiliation, might punish the whole class for Beaven's impudence, had been
  promptly relieved. He was impatient, exacting, sarcastic; but no worse than
  his reputation for ungraciousness.</p>

  <p>The battle between the professor and his unlucky disciple continued
  unabated. Sometimes the class was much annoyed. But the animosity had its
  droll moments, too. From the first day, Tubby made it a point to badger
  Beaven about his religious upbringing and the piety he had imputed to him,
  invariably addressing him in the classroom with honeyed phrases implying that
  he was likely to be offended if not handled tenderly. Had Jack been a member
  of some monastic order, appearing in gown and cowl, tonsured and barefooted,
  he couldn't have been treated with more deference. At times, Tubby's mockery
  was so laboured as to be very tiresome. On these occasions, Beaven's replies
  took no account of the mood in which the questions had been asked. Once in a
  while, Jack would play up to the role assigned him, and the dialogue had
  large possibilities, but before they were done with it, Tubby would be
  peevish. One day when the discussion related to the various phenomena of the
  endocrine glands, and much talk was made of physical functions speeded or
  retarded by mental states&mdash;the supernormal strength of the frenzied, the
  curious achievement of "second wind" by track athletes, etc.&mdash;Tubby had
  spoken of the adrenalin suddenly poured into the blood stream of men on the
  battlefield, as a prophylaxis against hæmorrhage, and raised the question
  whether the glands might&mdash;in an emergency&mdash;provide immunity against
  disease.</p>

  <p>"Brother Beaven," said Tubby, "when Saint Francis kissed the leper, do you
  think his piety may have accounted for the fact&mdash;if it is a
  fact&mdash;that he did not contract the disease himself?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied Jack, soberly. "In the brotherhood to which I belong
  we frequently kiss lepers."</p>

  <p>The class thought this was going to be a lot of fun, and gave rapt
  attention to the combatants, all eyes bright with expectation.</p>

  <p>"And you find that it does you no damage?" queried Tubby.</p>

  <p>"Not to us, sir. It is our method of administering euthanasia."</p>

  <p>Everybody laughed and felt that Beaven had scored a point. Tubby didn't
  like it. For a moment it seemed that he was about to carry on with the
  serious discussion of his theme. Then he decided to put Beaven on the
  spot.</p>

  <p>"That brings up an interesting question," he said severely. "You seem to
  speak favourably of euthanasia. Are there any circumstances under which a
  doctor might seem justified by giving his patient a painless death?"</p>

  <p>The class sobered. It looked as if Tubby was trying to back his victim
  into a corner where any attempt at persiflage might be easily
  misinterpreted.</p>

  <p>"It is against the law," Jack replied.</p>

  <p>"Is that the reason you would not do it?"</p>

  <p>"It is a good enough reason."</p>

  <p>"Then you are never going to kill anybody when you are a doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Very likely, sir; but not intentionally."</p>

  <p>"Your murders will all be accidental?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;that is, all of them that I commit in a strictly
  professional capacity."</p>

  <p>Tubby grunted, and resumed his lecture where he had left off. It was clear
  to everybody, including himself, that the interlude hadn't been a very
  dignified performance; nor had he succeeded in making Beaven appear
  ridiculous.</p>

  <p>One method of hectoring, which Tubby had practised freely during the early
  days of the term, had been abandoned. He had a trick of organizing the
  questions he put to Beaven in such a manner that they admitted of but one
  reply; questions so elementary that a high-school student with a sketchy
  knowledge of Physiology would have been considered a dolt if he had muffed
  them. But it was to be noticed that Tubby had discontinued this tactic. After
  the first couple of weeks, the class having had time to turn in some assigned
  anatomical drawings, Tubby left off treating Beaven as if he were a
  numbskull. Quite to the contrary, he now began the habit of singling him out
  when the question was exceptionally difficult. On these occasions, Tubby was
  sour but civil. It would grow very quiet in the classroom. Everybody would
  expect&mdash;and hope&mdash;that Tubby, upon receiving a correct reply to a
  hard question, might be decent enough to express his commendation. But he
  would merely nod briefly and proceed with the quiz.</p>

  <p>"I can't see what he thinks he's going to gain," the comely Gillette
  remarked, one day, when they happened to find themselves paired in the
  straggling procession that ambled down the walk to the street. "He knows
  you're the best student in the class, and admits it by the sort of questions
  he asks you. Why does he keep on trying to poke fun at you?"</p>

  <p>"He doesn't like me," said Jack.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;he certainly has got a nerve!" complained Winifred,
  sympathetically.</p>

  <p>Jack grinned and reminded her that Tubby was a nerve specialist. He felt
  silly over Winifred's solicitude.</p>

  <p>"It's a funny thing," she continued, "how he seems to spend more time at
  your table in the lab than with anyone else. I often wonder: does he go over
  there just to annoy you and find fault? One day I saw him snarling at you,
  and then he picked up your notebook and pinched on his cute little lorgnette
  and scowled at your drawing for a long time, and then scribbled something on
  it, and almost threw it at you. And then stalked away, mad as a wet hen."</p>

  <p>Jack shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't quite that bad," he said. "Tubby was just making a little
  suggestion; something he hadn't mentioned in class. It spoiled my drawing, so
  I had it to do over; but it was a very interesting&mdash;" To Winifred's
  surprise, Jack suddenly interrupted himself to say. "Hold out your hand.
  Spread out your fingers. Bend back the little one. Stretch it out. Now bend
  back the next one. Notice the difference. See how much more freedom you have
  with the little finger?"</p>

  <p>Winifred obeyed him, critically surveying her hand. It was a very shapely
  hand, she was pleased to note, and she hoped he might think so. Perhaps he
  would say something to that effect, when the impromptu lesson was over. But
  he didn't.</p>

  <p>"That's because," he went on, as unmoved by the beauty of her hand as he
  might have been if it belonged to a cadaver, "there's a different tendon
  structure serving the little finger; not very much, but enough difference to
  be noticed; slightly different calibre of nerve-fibre, too. That's what Tubby
  was calling my attention to."</p>

  <p>"Mighty small matter to be making such a big fuss about," she grumbled,
  loyally.</p>

  <p>"Maybe&mdash;but it's these small matters that have made Tubby a great
  anatomist."</p>

  <p>Winifred pouted in his behalf, firming a very pretty mouth.</p>

  <p>"So you still think he's great," she said, "after the rotten way he has
  treated you."</p>

  <p>"Of course," declared Jack. "Tubby's attitude toward me has nothing to do
  with his ability as a scientist."</p>

  <p>She regarded him with wide, perplexed eyes, almost as if they were total
  strangers, and did not reply for a long moment.</p>

  <p>"I'm almost afraid of you," she said, at length. "I believe you're as
  cold-blooded as Tubby is. You two pretend to hate each other, but you don't;
  not really. I'll bet you're as nearly alike as identical twins. I think I
  know now why Tubby comes to your table and growls at you. He knows you've got
  something."</p>

  <p>"Pish!" said Jack.</p>

  <p>"And I know something else," Winifred went on, impressively. "Yesterday he
  ordered your table to be pushed over on the north side, next to a window. And
  I said to Millicent Reeves: 'I'll bet Tubby has put him over there, by that
  draughty window, so he will be cold and uncomfortable.'"</p>

  <p>Jack laughed.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you're right," he said. "It is chilly over there."</p>

  <p>Winifred lifted a hand in contradiction.</p>

  <p>"Ah, no, Brother Beaven. He put you over there so you would have the
  advantage of that north light."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! I'm the last fellow in the world that Tubby would befriend. See
  here&mdash;he doesn't show any partiality. Hasn't he given you a square
  deal?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! And he didn't scribble anything on my paper about that
  what-you-may-call-it tendon in the fingers."</p>

  <p>"Extensor," supplied Jack. <i>"Extensor digiti quinti proprius,</i> for
  short."</p>

  <p>"Wow!" said Winifred, wincing. "What a pretty mouthful! Do you try to
  remember all that stuff? I'm sure I don't."</p>

  <p>Jack frowned down upon her like an elder brother. "You'd better," he said.
  "There will be an examination, some day. Tubby may be negligent about his
  parlour manners, but he wants everybody to know the Latin names for
  things."</p>

  <p>At the corner their steps lagged. Winifred drew a sigh and remarked that
  all work and no play might make Jack a dull boy. She looked him straight in
  the eyes as she said it, and his heart missed a beat. He had a fleeting
  notion to do something about it.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," she said, caressing the word provocatively.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," said Jack.</p>

  <p>He sensed a sudden glow of well-being as he pursued his way down the
  street with lengthened stride and squared shoulders. It hadn't occurred to
  him why the damned old beast had moved him into that draughty corner. The
  girl had guessed the reason. Tubby wanted to give him a chance to do his
  best. Tubby hated him like hell, but was on his side when it came to the
  pursuit of their common task. Tubby deserved a spanking, but he was a great
  scientist. Jack laughed; laughed aloud; and then suddenly remembered that to
  laugh aloud&mdash;by oneself&mdash;was a sign of madness. For the moment, he
  had forgotten all about Winifred.</p>

  <p>A few days later&mdash;it was nearly six o'clock&mdash;Jack was conscious
  of someone at his elbow. He had been working since four on a piece of
  independent research on the structure of the left subclavian vein. Tubby had
  remarked, seemingly rather more to himself than the class: "The left
  subclavian vein: well&mdash;do your best. And when you have done your best,
  you will still have much to learn. I recommend your diligent study of it."
  Jack had taken the hint and had stayed after the usual laboratory hours to do
  a painstaking dissection.</p>

  <p>"Hello," he said, absently. "You still here?"</p>

  <p>"My last drawing bounced back on me," muttered Winifred. "He told me to do
  it over. And now everybody's gone, and this place is dreadfully spooky. I've
  got the jitters."</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly," said Jack, comfortingly. "These people are harmless.
  Some of them were public nuisances, while they were alive, but they're
  philanthropists now." He straightened an aching spine, and regarded her with
  a friendly grin. "This fellow," said Jack, patting his cadaver cordially on
  the chest, "committed suicide after having forged a note for a sizable sum of
  money. The man who lost the money is probably at home, by this time, reading
  the evening paper. He is well-to-do, highly respected, and after dinner he
  and his wife will go somewhere for a game of bridge. But&mdash;he will never
  have a chance to serve his generation in a big way because, after all's said
  to his credit, he is just another run-o'-the-mine citizen. When he dies, the
  lodge will turn out in plumes and mothballs, and bury him. Maybe taps will be
  blown at his grave, if he was something in the war. But&mdash;<i>my</i>
  friend here," continued Jack, "is offering the medical profession some
  information about the left subclavian vein&mdash;but I wish he wouldn't be so
  darned reticent."</p>

  <p>Winifred eyed him steadily, her inviting lips pursed. She shook her head.
  It was a pretty head. She had just suffered a permanent.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how you can do it," she said, slowly. "You love it, don't
  you? I hate it! I loathe it!" She tucked her forehead into the crook of her
  arm, and shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you should be doing something else," suggested Jack, fraternally.
  "Maybe you should be at home, serving on the hospitality committee for the
  Junior League."</p>

  <p>Now Winifred was going to cry. Jack regarded her with apprehension but
  with interest. He had been looking ahead, in the textbooks, and presently he
  would be studying the various phenomena of the lachrymal glands. He didn't
  want Winifred to cry, but if she was going to cry he felt that he might as
  well note all the phases of it that could be viewed externally.</p>

  <p>"Come on," she entreated, brokenly. "Let's leave these rotten old
  corpses&mdash;and go out and have dinner&mdash;some place&mdash;and&mdash;Oh,
  I'm so dreadfully fed up with this terrible business." She drew a long
  breath, with a sob in it, and pushed her face deep into his white smock. Jack
  patted her arm.</p>

  <p>There was a sound of brisk footsteps. Professor Milton Forrester had
  ineptly chosen this high-geared moment for an excursion from his office into
  his private laboratory. He paused, outraged at the sight which smote his
  gaze. Winifred detached herself from Jack's shoulder, and regarded the enemy
  with frightened, tearful eyes. Jack felt as foolish as he looked. Tubby bore
  down on them indignantly.</p>

  <p>"Well!" he snorted. "If this isn't the last place in the world for people
  to make love! It's a wonder the whole roomful of cadavers doesn't sit up and
  laugh! Now&mdash;you get out of here&mdash;both of you&mdash;and attend to
  your mooning elsewhere!" He strode off, stiffly, toward his laboratory. At
  the door he paused to say: "Beaven&mdash;I'm surprised at you. I had
  hoped&mdash;" He shook his head, disgustedly, opened the door, and
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you'd better run along now," said Jack, thickly. "I think we've
  done enough to ourselves, for one session."</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully sorry, Jack," murmured Winifred. "My fault. All of it. He'll
  hate you, now, worse than ever. Please forgive me."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Never had a day passed more quickly. He had gone to the anatomical
  laboratory at nine, presently realizing&mdash;when he glanced up to find
  himself alone&mdash;that it was noon. After a while the others drifted in,
  tied on their aprons, lighted their pipes. It was to be hoped that no one of
  his elders and betters would stroll over to see what he was up to. He could
  imagine Jim Wentworth, whom he knew slightly, glancing at his sketch and
  saying with a grin: "You'd better not try to stand on your head, little one,
  until you learn how to walk."</p>

  <p>Jack was not engaged on any required problem to-day. He was attempting to
  satisfy his curiosity about something that probably had no practical value at
  all.</p>

  <p>Shortly before vacation, the class had been studying the head. Tubby had
  called attention to the quite elaborate fan-shaped muscular equipment
  extending above and behind the ear, an ingenious device for which there was
  but little use. He had added that it was a vestigial remain of muscles which
  were very important and active long ago when men's ears were as mobile as the
  ears of dogs. Now that we had escaped from the jungle and were no longer
  preyed upon by an assortment of stealthy enemies, we were not required to be
  on the jump.</p>

  <p>"You should easily locate, on the cartilaginous rim of your own ear,"
  remarked Tubby, "a trace of the tip which used to sweep about with the
  swiftness and certainty of movement still displayed by the human eye."</p>

  <p>It was rather odd, Jack thought, that the tip of the dawn man's ear should
  have degenerated through disuse until you could hardly find it, while the
  muscles which had served the ear's necessities&mdash;a million years
  ago&mdash;showed no signs of atrophy.</p>

  <p>Nobody in the class had raised the questions. Tubby had volunteered no
  further information on the matter. The dissection had proceeded and the
  scheduled drawings had been made, quite as if there was nothing peculiar
  about the auricular muscles which had been loafing on the job for innumerable
  ages. The class had picked its way, routinishly, through these muscle-fibres,
  tagging the arteries and veins and nerves with red, blue, and black threads,
  as usual. And, having drawn their charts, had moved along next day to a
  similar examination of the frontalis.</p>

  <p>Jack hadn't been satisfied with this ear business, and wanted another go
  at it for his own private information. Already the study of nerve structure
  had begun to be of peculiar interest to him. He realized it was rather silly
  to be thinking&mdash;in his first year&mdash;of going in for neurological
  surgery as a specialty, but something told him it was likely to turn out that
  way.</p>

  <p>This probability presented an annoying problem. Had he discovered in
  himself a special concern for something else&mdash;internal medicine, for
  instance&mdash;he would be seeing less of Tubby Forrester as the years
  passed. If he went in for neurological surgery, the time would come when he
  might be at Tubby's elbow all the day long&mdash;a most undesirable
  situation.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, when Tubby had been particularly mean to him in the classroom,
  Jack would swear that this settled it. He would leave off concentrating his
  attention on nerves. Next day he would be in the library, absorbed in Ransom,
  Whitaker, and Quain, pretending not to notice Miss Selfridge's sniff when he
  asked for them&mdash;as if she was thinking: "Sonny&mdash;you'd better stick
  to good old Gray until you learn where all the bones are."</p>

  <p>It was four o'clock now. On the tall desk beside his operating-table, Jack
  had painstakingly drawn a good sketch of the auricular muscles&mdash;a much
  more complete and detailed drawing than he had done previously as a
  requirement. In the microscope he had sharpened the focus of the
  stereoscopics upon the tiny tendril of nerve-fibre, and was studying it with
  an absorption so complete that he was startled to find Tubby beside him.</p>

  <p>"Nice way for a pious Christian to spend Christmas Eve," said Tubby. "I
  should have thought you might be playing Santa Claus at some Sunday School
  festivity."</p>

  <p>Jack straightened, blinking a little as he eased out of his eyestrain.</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't have me," he drawled. "Not chubby enough."</p>

  <p>He blandly looked Tubby up and down, his eyes lingering briefly in the
  vicinity of the great man's midriff.</p>

  <p>"May I venture to inquire," asked Tubby, with elaborate courtesy, "what
  you think you are doing?"</p>

  <p>Jack nodded his head toward the drawing and Tubby, adjusting his glasses,
  gave it a glance.</p>

  <p>"I thought you had already done this. I seem to recall that we passed it,
  some days ago."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. I was just curious about it." Jack proceeded to explain the
  nature of his inquisitiveness, rather reluctantly, for he didn't want Tubby
  to make sport of him. It was all very well if Tubby, wanting to punish him,
  held him up to open ridicule before the class, savagely raking him as a prig.
  But he hoped for some degree of fairness and sincerity when it came to a
  matter of scientific inquiry.</p>

  <p>"Far as I can see," concluded Jack, "the nerves in control of these
  non-functioning muscles are of the same structure and calibre as those of the
  frontalis. Why haven't they atrophied?"</p>

  <p>"What do you want to know for?" growled Tubby, resetting the stereoscopics
  to his own astigmatism, and squinting at the tiny thread of nerve.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;just curiosity," replied Jack, lamely, and half-ashamed of the
  confession. He wondered if Tubby would be cad enough to make some
  contemptuous allusion to it later in the classroom.</p>

  <p>Tubby tucked his pince-nez back in his breast pocket.</p>

  <p>"I see you're interested in nerves. Why?"</p>

  <p>"I've often wondered," said Jack, in a tone barely audible, as if he were
  speaking to himself. Then, with animation: "Would you be good enough to tell
  me, sir, what I want to know about this nerve?"</p>

  <p>Tubby, who had been carrying his overcoat on his arm, put it on and
  buttoned it.</p>

  <p>"No!" he snapped. "I'll not tell you!"</p>

  <p>He needn't be so damned brutal about it, thought Jack, flushing with
  anger.</p>

  <p>"I'll not tell you," repeated Tubby&mdash;"because I don't know. And I
  don't thank you for stirring the question up." He tugged on his gloves, with
  quick little jerks.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;I suppose <i>nobody</i> knows," said Jack.</p>

  <p>Tubby darted a searching look.</p>

  <p>"Are you trying to say something smart, young man?" he challenged, his jaw
  thrust out pugnaciously.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I never was more honest in my life. I think that if you do not
  know, it is unlikely that anybody else does."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" muttered Tubby. He turned to go, took a few steps, returned,
  elbowed Jack away from the microscope, peered into it for a long moment, and
  having grunted "Humph", stiffened his back and marched out of the room.</p>

  <p>Jack turned his head to watch this pompous retreat; then grinned, and
  growled deep in his throat: "Merry Christmas&mdash;Towser."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Noisily closing the laboratory door behind him, Dr Forrester proceeded
  through the dimly lighted lecture amphitheatre to his office. He had a call
  to make before dinner, and had forgotten the street address.</p>

  <p>Snapping on the lamps, he drew out a large metal drawer from the cabinet
  of case-histories, extracted the page he sought, and put on his glasses. A
  good deal of misery had been boiled down into the succinct, cold-blooded
  phrases detailing the clinical log of William Mason, forty, carpenter,
  resident of Elmersville, married, no children; state charge.</p>

  <p>Forrester's eye ran swiftly through the report, stirring afresh an
  indignation that&mdash;six weeks ago&mdash;had furnished him the materials
  for a whole day of fiery speeches.</p>

  <p>A dozen years ago, Mason had begun to suffer burning pains in the lower
  part of his back. He had consulted a physician in the little town where he
  lived, and was given amateur massage and hot fomentations&mdash;and bromides.
  For more than a year he continued, with increasing discomfort, to pursue his
  trade. The pain becoming unbearable, he had consulted another physician in
  the slightly larger neighbouring town of Kenwood. His tonsils and four teeth
  were removed. Six months later another doctor had operated on him for hernia,
  followed shortly by an appendectomy. Two years afterwards he was hospitalized
  again and an extension apparatus was applied to his legs for eight weeks.</p>

  <p>Then they had all given it up. Mason was helplessly bed-ridden, nursed by
  his wife who supported them by home baking.</p>

  <p>Three months ago, Mason, having applied for examination in the University
  Clinic, had made the journey on a stretcher. A careful survey of the case
  showed that the patient had a lumbosacral tumour of the spinal cord.</p>

  <p>Forrester had fumed and raged when he made this discovery. Throwing all
  discretion and diplomacy to the winds, he had had his say about the case. By
  rights, William Mason ought to sue the state for damages. He had been put to
  unspeakable agony, he had lost a dozen years out of his working life, had
  spent his savings and surrendered his home. It was the state's fault. The
  state had licensed men to practise medicine and surgery who regarded their
  vocation as a mere trade&mdash;a mere source of food supply, "like a
  truck-patch". Perhaps they thought they meant well, romping up and down the
  countryside with their self-assured manner and their impressive little
  leather satchels, earning plaudits for their attentiveness, their kind words,
  their soothing smiles, but not knowing whether they were afoot or horseback
  when it came to making a scientific diagnosis. Mason had been given the
  dirtiest kind of a dirty deal.</p>

  <p>Next morning after Dr Forrester had performed the operation&mdash;a
  laminectomy on the twelfth thoracic and first three lumbars&mdash;removing an
  incredibly large encapsulated tumour, he determined to make the shocking
  affair known. All that day he had recounted the steps in Mason's case for the
  benefit of his classes; had waived the scheduled lectures; had engaged in a
  furious lambasting of the State Legislature, the Medical Association, and the
  public's <i>laisser-faire</i> attitude toward incompetence in the most
  important profession.</p>

  <p>"It all goes to show," he had declaimed, "what comes of a lack of
  training, lack of self-discipline, lack of capacity for personal sacrifice in
  school and during internship.</p>

  <p>"William Mason is a typical victim of malpractice. Some of you are
  unwittingly making preparations to go forth to commit similar crimes. You are
  eager to get out of training and set up business for yourselves. Some selfish
  little fluff is yapping at you to hurry up and marry her. Your parents think
  you ought to be earning money pretty soon. You're tired of the long hours,
  the strict supervision, the monotonous hospital food, the drudgery, the
  screams, and the stinks. So&mdash;you pop out, with your little black
  satchel, to rub horse liniment on William Mason's rump; or, in a brilliant
  display of acumen, to yank his tonsils out. A dozen years later, some sour
  old curmudgeon, who wasn't in such a hurry to hang out a shingle, finds an
  aged tumour in Mason's spinal cord."</p>

  <p>That had been a very noisy day in the Forrester classroom. He had raked
  the whole lexicon to find strong enough phrases.</p>

  <p>"I hope you are not gathering from my heated remarks," he had cautioned,
  "that I am emotionally upset about William Mason, as an individual. The fact
  that he spent twelve years in abject misery is most emphatically none of my
  business. His aches and pains haven't cost me one minute's sleep. The world
  is full&mdash;has ever been full&mdash;of aches and pains. I am not the least
  bit sentimental on that subject. Nor is it my affair if Mason's wife had to
  bake cookies to support him. She might have been engaged in a less
  interesting occupation.</p>

  <p>"But I <i>have</i> been losing sleep over the deplorable conditions which
  permit these injustices. I feel responsible. It is my duty to help prepare
  physicians to do something better for William Mason than sit by his bed twice
  a week, and look again at his tongue, and tell him to buck up bravely. I tell
  you&mdash;part of your shame as an incompetent is <i>my</i> shame!"</p>

  <p>He had felt that these speeches had really done some good. It seemed that
  his classes were doing more serious work; not so many absences; not so many
  asinine replies to simple questions. William Mason had been put to a lot of
  suffering, but his case had served a very good purpose. Somebody should tell
  the chap that. It would be interesting to observe his reaction.</p>

  <p>Forrester glanced at his watch and was startled to find how long he had
  been standing here, brooding over the Mason incident. He noted the
  address&mdash;121 South Hemlock. He remembered now, having had occasion to
  look it up only yesterday.</p>

  <p>The Masons had been advised to go into furnished rooms for a few weeks, so
  that he might be available to the clinic. The man would have to be under
  supervision for some time. He couldn't be discharged now and sent back to
  Elmersville where the medical profession would have nothing for him but
  sympathy and sleeping-powders.</p>

  <p>The streets were slippery and Forrester drove with caution. He wore a
  scowl. It was rather awkward&mdash;his feeling of obligation to have a look
  at Mason, this afternoon. People were so soft and silly about Christmas.
  These Masons unquestionably felt grateful to him for the operation. The woman
  had tried to make a fuss over him in the hospital. How often he was obliged
  to put up with this sort of thing. It always embarrassed him; made him
  suspect that his colleagues were grinning behind his back. Sometimes he had
  been required to be almost rude, realizing that he was hurting their
  feelings; but&mdash;he could trust the tear-wipers and back-patters to attend
  to these damaged sensibilities.</p>

  <p>He rang the bell and heard it jingle in the second-floor flat. Mrs Mason,
  a shawl about her shoulders, hurried down the stairs. She peered at him with
  bewilderment for a moment; then smiled the sort of welcome she might have
  bestowed upon a relative.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;it's Dr Forrester! I never seen you without your long white
  coat and cap. Come in, please. Bill will be so glad." She closed the door
  behind them; and, still holding on to the knob, lowered her voice to say:
  "And oh&mdash;Dr Forrester&mdash;you can't ever know what it has meant to
  Bill and I&mdash;all those wonderful things to eat." The big tears ran
  unchecked, while Forrester stared at her in dismay. Some blundering fool at
  the grocery store&mdash;in spite of strict instructions&mdash;had let them
  know.</p>

  <p>He made an impatient gesture up the cold stairway, and Mrs Mason piloted
  him through the stuffy little living-room to the bedside.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mason; how goes the battle?" demanded Forrester.</p>

  <p>The sick man's eyes lighted. He reached out his hand, which the doctor
  grasped by the wrist. There was a minute of silence. Forrester did not take
  out his watch; had his ear attentive to the busy little clock on the
  bureau.</p>

  <p>"Turn over and let me see your back.... Bring that light over here...
  . Hold it&mdash;so." He drew up the sheet again, pocketed his glasses, nodded
  his head. "Very good. Doing nicely."</p>

  <p>"Doctor"&mdash;Mason cleared his throat&mdash;"That was an awful fine
  thing you did for us. We know you are a big man, with a lot o' folks to worry
  about. And we certainly thank you for thinking of us&mdash;'specially
  now."</p>

  <p>"It's made Christmas mighty happy for us," put in Mrs Mason. "Hasn't it,
  Bill?"</p>

  <p>"I'll say. You've got a heart, Doc! You're not only a big surgeon. You're
  a prince." Bill, overcome by his own words, wiped his nose on the corner of
  the sheet.</p>

  <p>"We was almost afraid of you," ventured Mrs Mason; adding, recklessly:
  "One of the nurses said you was too busy to take any store of common
  folks."</p>

  <p>Forrester was stroking his gloves on to his fingers with impatience. He
  felt he had to say something to clear this matter up.</p>

  <p>"Mr Mason&mdash;and Madam&mdash;I hope you will understand my exact
  motives in ordering this food. The fact that it has come to you on Christmas
  is a mere coincidence, I assure you. I am much interested in your
  case&mdash;as a matter of professional concern. I would like to bring you
  into my student clinic, within the next four weeks, with your normal
  activities fairly well resumed. You can assist me by taking proper care of
  yourself, and making every effort to build up your strength. I feared that
  you might try to live on poor food, for reasons of economy. I don't want any
  of <i>that!"</i> His voice shrilled to lecture-room pitch. He turned almost
  belligerently to Mrs Mason. "And I don't want <i>you</i> skimping on food,
  either! You're thin as a rail. First thing you know, you'll be flat, and then
  he'll have <i>you</i> to fret about. And that will detain his convalescence.
  I intend to see to it that you both are provided with proper nourishment. But
  what I have done is strictly <i>professional!"</i> He glared more fiercely at
  Mrs Mason as he observed a timid smile puckering her lips. This ignorant
  woman wasn't getting the idea, at all. <i>"Strictly</i> professional!" he
  repeated.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;how about the holly wreath, Doctor? Did you mean for Bill and I
  to eat that?" She took Bill's hand as if to solicit his support of her
  audacity.</p>

  <p>"Holly? Holly?" Forrester made an earnest task of buttoning his gloves.
  "Humph! Well! I had forgotten. A trifle&mdash;I'm sure. The important thing
  is that I want you, Mason, to give me a good blood count within the next few
  days."</p>

  <p>To his wife's amazement, Bill let loose a half-hysterical haw-haw, the
  doctor regarding him with sombre disapproval.</p>

  <p>"You can't kid <i>me,</i> Doc&mdash;God bless yuh!"</p>

  <p>"Nor me, neither," declared Mrs Mason, bravely. "You done it out o' the
  kindness of your big heart. Perfessional&mdash;Pooh! We never had a better
  friend. Look what you done for him, a'ready! And now these presents!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;well&mdash;have it your own way," grumbled Forrester, in the
  tone he often employed with psychopathic patients. Taking up his hat, he
  moved toward the door. Mrs Mason said she would go down with him, but he
  assured her, with frosty dignity, that he could let himself out.</p>

  <p>"Merry Christmas, Doc!" called Bill.</p>

  <p>Forrester paused, blinked a few times, and replied, stiffly: "Oh
  yes&mdash;of course&mdash;of course."</p>

  <p>"Merry Christmas, Dr Forrester," said Mrs Mason, tenderly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. Quite so.... Good evening."</p>

  <p>He closed the door and made his way gingerly down the poorly lighted
  stairway, climbed into his coupé, fumbled for his cigarettes, struck a match,
  spun his engine, and scooted off through the slush in the direction of the
  University Club where he was having dinner with an old bachelor crony,
  Linton, of the Law Faculty.</p>

  <p>He found him in the library, deep in a big leather chair.</p>

  <p>"Hi, Scrooge," drawled Linton, dragging himself to his feet. "You're late.
  I thought maybe you had gone carolling."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Tony and Bugs were engaged in a laborious discussion of
  what's-it-all-about-anyway when Jack returned at nine. Pausing at the open
  doorway of Cartmell's dishevelled room, he peered into the smoke-fog and
  grinned understandingly.</p>

  <p>"Come in," said Bugs, thickly, "and improve your mind. Important words are
  being uttered and much truth is coming to light."</p>

  <p>"'<i>In vino Veritas</i>,'" added Tony, with deep solemnity.</p>

  <p>"Smells more like whisky," said Jack.</p>

  <p>"The fellow has the nose of a chemist," muttered Bugs. "Bring a glass,
  Doctor, and we'll see how much <i>veritas</i> you are able to
  contribute."</p>

  <p>In dressing-gown and slippers Jack presently joined them, poured himself a
  small nip from the depleted bottle, gulped and shuddered, filled his pipe,
  and dumped the miscellaneous contents of a chair on to the floor. "Don't let
  me interrupt," he said. "As you were."</p>

  <p>Bugs, sprawled on the bed, rose on one elbow, propping his head up with
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you'd better give your family an account of your recent
  movements," he suggested, paternally. "It's very late for you to be out. Have
  you been down among the bright lights, observing the antics of the quick, or
  up in the lab, consorting with the dead?"</p>

  <p>"He smells like the lab," remarked Tony.</p>

  <p>"Then we don't care to hear anything about your adventures," decided Bugs.
  "Tony and I have just passed a unanimous resolution, after a learned debate,
  to the effect that the medicine man has as good a right as a plumber to live
  a normal life; three meals regularly, seven hours' sleep&mdash;all served in
  one piece&mdash;a decent house to live in, preferably in the suburbs of a
  small village, a wife, children, flower garden&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With plenty of ground," interposed Tony, "for vegetables and
  chickens&mdash;and a nice fat pig in a pen."</p>

  <p>"No, shir!" objected Bugs. "I've been telling him you can't have
  vegetables <i>and</i> chickens. But"&mdash;wistfully&mdash;"I'd rather like
  to have a pig-pen."</p>

  <p>Jack made a comprehensive gesture with his pipe-stem, and drawled: "What's
  the matter with this one?"</p>

  <p>"We trust you are not trying to be offensive," said Bugs, with dignity.
  "You come in here reeking of a loathsome occupation, partake of our
  hospitality, throw our various necessities on the floor, and then insinuate
  that our room is untidy. Rank ingratitude."</p>

  <p>"Rank is right," agreed Tony. "By the way&mdash;have you found out yet
  what made you wiggle your ears when you were a monkey, or whatever damn'-fool
  thing it was you wanted to know?"</p>

  <p>"Proceed, brothers," urged Jack. "I should like to hear more about this
  country doctor, with the chickens and the asparagus and the pig&mdash;and the
  medicine case filled with quinine, morphine, and castor-oil. Tubby ought to
  be here to make a few more remarks about the progress of medical science in
  Elmersville."</p>

  <p>Bugs sat up and extended an arm in a sweeping gesture.</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;there you are! Let's start from there. Take Tubby, for example.
  What d'you suppose that old killjoy gets out of life? Bachelor. Lives at a
  club. On duty seven days of the week."</p>

  <p>"And on Sunday," added Tony. "That makes eight."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. And trying to tell people," declaimed Bugs, "how they ought to
  live." He paused for reply.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'm not acting as Tubby's attorney," countered Jack,
  "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No!" cut in Tony, "I shouldn't think you would, after the dirty treatment
  you've had."</p>

  <p>"That's all true enough. Tubby has been very unpleasant. But that is a
  personal matter. He doesn't like me; and, naturally, I don't like him. All
  that is beside the point. It has nothing to do with what we're talking about.
  I think I understand Tubby's attitude about the medicine man. One thing is
  certain: you can't be a doctor and raise chickens. I doubt whether you can be
  a really good doctor and have a home, a wife, social duties, children, care
  of a house, worry of family illness, monthly bills."</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;but look at us!" grumbled Tony. "Here we are, on Christmas
  Eve, crowded into this frowsy old rat-hole&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shay, fellah," protested Bugs, "enough has been said about my humble
  abode. If you don't like it, you can&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;I know where you mean." Tony dismissed him with an overhand
  gesture. "And we'll be spending Christmas in just such diggings until it's
  time to move up to the top floor of the hospital annex for a few more years
  of captivity. Don't you think we'll deserve a home&mdash;ever?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't a matter of deserving," said Jack. "It's the nature of the job;
  that's what we're discussing. You think that a doctor can pursue a normal
  life. I disagree. I've given up the home idea&mdash;for good."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;you're going to be an old bachelor&mdash;like Tubby?"
  demanded Bugs, incredulously. "You'll never get away with it. It must have
  been easy for Tubby. No woman would want him."</p>

  <p>"That's right," mumbled Tony. "Some gal will shout: 'My hero!'&mdash;and
  take you into camp."</p>

  <p>"I have only one interest in life now," declared Jack, resolutely, "and
  that's scientific. That's <i>all.</i> Nothing else matters. I may turn out to
  be no good at it, but&mdash;it won't be because I wanted a home."</p>

  <p class="verse">"O lit-tle town of Beth-le-hem&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs Doyle had turned on her radio.</p>

  <p>"Guess you're right, at that," conceded Bugs, indulgently. "A home is
  nothing but a millstone around your neck.... I wish the old lady would
  turn off that Sunday School entertainment. I never realized she was so darned
  sentimental."</p>

  <p class="verse">"A-bove thy deep and dream-less sleep&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tony lifted himself out of his chair, stretched to full torsion, yawned
  mightily, and said he was going to bed.</p>

  <p class="verse">"The ev-er-last-ing Light&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Me, too," said Jack. "Goodnight."</p>

  <p>"Merry Christmas!" drawled Bugs.</p>

  <p>Retiring to his room, Jack disposed himself comfortably in two chairs,
  lighted his pipe, and listened. It was not a Sunday School entertainment.
  Sunday Schools didn't furnish that kind of music. This was a choir of trained
  voices. Sunday Schools didn't have trained voices. If you wanted to hear a
  really good interpretation of the old hymns, you had to call in singers from
  secular society. It took the world, the flesh, and the devil to make these
  expressions of religion inspirational. The idea had never occurred to him
  before&mdash;not just this way. Funny thing about that. Religion's best
  art-forms&mdash;painting, sculpture, poetry, music, drama&mdash;had been
  composed and executed by people who were primarily artists concerned with art
  for art's sake. Same way with healing, maybe. The greatest contributors to
  medicine and surgery weren't the people who had been moved to holy pity by
  the world's distress: they had gone in for science not because they were
  emotionally disturbed over human suffering but because they were
  intellectually curious and wanted to know to what lengths of discovery
  science might carry them.</p>

  <p class="verse">"No ear may hear His com-ing..."</p>

  <p>Nor had the scientist been trained and encouraged by organized religion.
  More often than not, religion had disapproved of them. Sometimes they had had
  to fight their way through the prophets and priests to lay hold upon the
  instruments of research.</p>

  <p class="verse">"The dear Christ en-ters in."</p>

  <p>Jack's brooding eyes narrowed in serious concentration. An interesting
  question, this. Just where did "the dear Christ" come into this picture?
  Whose side was He on? What did He think of the whole business? Did it offend
  Him to see the healing of the world's diseases going forward in the hands of
  people who didn't give a moment's thought to the problem of "inspiration"?
  Maybe the solemn wiseacres had Him all wrong. Maybe "the dear Christ" was
  concerned only with having the Truth come out and do its work&mdash;no matter
  who found it, or how. If that could be proved, well&mdash;it certainly would
  upset the apple-cart; but it would make "the dear Christ" popular with the
  people who were pushing civilization forward. It would liberate Him from the
  tight little enclosures where He fraternized with the uninquisitive and the
  resigned. Science would claim Him! The researchists would shout to the
  sentimentalists: "He has been your exclusive property too long! He's on
  <i>our</i> side!"... And they would hang His picture in the lab. In the
  anatomical lab, where Tubby could see it. Tubby wouldn't object. All he cared
  for was science. If it could be shown that Christ was in favour of science,
  Tubby would be for Him. And they would hang His picture in the chemical lab.
  It might change their tactics. They couldn't take much interest in poison gas
  if He was looking down at 'em and they knew He was concerned about chemical
  research.</p>

  <p class="verse">"It came upon th' mid-night clear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The sweet old lyric reached into Jack's memory and stirred him. He closed
  his eyes and let the pictures file by.... When he and Jean&mdash;his
  twin&mdash;had been little things, Father would go downstairs early,
  Christmas morning, to rouse the furnace. It was barely light. He and Jean
  would be pipping to go down and see the tree and the gifts. But they weren't
  permitted; not until Father had played a few Christmas hymns on the
  phonograph. They must sit still in bed and listen. Mother would come and put
  her arms around them, and they would try to be very still.</p>

  <p class="verse">"O ye be-neath life's crushing load&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nobody was ever more sentimental than Mother. She certainly took her
  religion hard&mdash;and took it straight. When he and Jean were in high
  school, the family still ran the Christmas hymns on the phonograph before
  anyone went down&mdash;but Father.</p>

  <p class="verse">"Look now for glad and gol-den hours&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Once, he and Jean had brought home a couple of records that weren't
  exactly religious&mdash;according to Mother's ideas. One was an old English
  ballad that had something in it about ale, and another was "Noël" which she
  felt had been concocted under the wrong auspices. Mother wouldn't have it.
  Christmas was a religious occasion, and you wanted to be mighty careful what
  brand of religion it was, too. "Ave Maria" wasn't quite the thing for
  Christmas morning, though Mother was uncompromising about the Virgin Birth.
  If you didn't believe that, the whole thing fell to pieces, she said. And
  maybe it did.... Maybe it had!</p>

  <p class="verse">"Joy-ful all ye na-tions rise&mdash;<br>
  Join th' tri-umph of the skies&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They always had to attend everything the little Church had to offer at
  Christmas time. Grandfather had been a Methodist preacher and it was up to
  the family to honour the faith he had toiled for. It had been the pure faith,
  once delivered unto the saints, and you weren't allowed to ask any questions
  about it. Mother always grew nervous and petulant when you asked questions.
  Faith couldn't grow in an atmosphere of doubt.</p>

  <p class="verse">"Veiled in flesh th' God-head see&mdash;<br>
  Hail th' in-car-nate Deity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Whenever people began raising queries they opened the way for Satan to
  come into their hearts and make them unhappy&mdash;unhappy and unworthy.
  Mother was very precious. She might have been pretty if she hadn't worn her
  beautiful Titian hair that way. Sometimes a cute little curl would peep out
  from under her hat-brim and she would be prompt to tuck it back where it
  belonged. God didn't go in much for pretty things. He liked plain people best
  and preferred them to wear dowdy clothes. My Uncle!&mdash;but it had stirred
  things up when Jean came home, one day, with her hair bobbed. He and Jean had
  been half-grown before they realized that Father was fairly well-to-do.
  Mother didn't want them to know because she hoped to keep them unspotted from
  the world.</p>

  <p class="verse">"Sing, choirs of an-gels&mdash;<br>
  Sing in ex-ul-ta-tion&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But they had loved her for her goodness and her tenderness. She would have
  crawled on her hands and knees over a road of cinders to get them something
  she thought they ought to like.</p>

  <p>After Father was gone, she had redoubled her efforts to make them good. To
  be good meant to believe; believe the Word. No, no, darling&mdash;here is The
  Word. You must accept The Word&mdash;and be saved.</p>

  <p>And when they had come home from college for Christmas vacation, in their
  freshman year, Mother had insisted on the early morning phonograph programme,
  same as when they were tiny tots. This time Mother operated the phonograph;
  and when it burst forth lustily with "He rules the world with truth and
  grace, and makes the nations prove the glories of His righteousness and
  wonders of His love", Jean, who was sitting on the foot of his bed, put both
  hands over her ears. It was the third year of the World War.... Then
  Jean&mdash;how vividly he remembered the moment&mdash;she had her comb in her
  hand, and had been running it through her lovely corn-yellow hair. She tipped
  back her head, shook her curls, resumed her combing, and muttered: "It would
  be funny&mdash;if it wasn't so terribly tragic."</p>

  <p>Now that Mother was gone, one remembered best the sweetness of her. There
  was no discounting the value of her beliefs in their effect upon <i>her.</i>
  She had gone through hell, at the last, with her inoperable cancer, but The
  Word had unquestionably come to the rescue. Everybody had marvelled at her
  calmness. You could say what you pleased about religion as an opiate;
  sometimes that's what you wanted&mdash;an opiate. Medical science could be
  grateful for some sedative strong enough to counteract pain, without doing
  any damage. There was no sense in sneering at religion because it made people
  contented with their disappointments and resigned to their incurable
  miseries. Religion had science licked at that point; no question.</p>

  <p class="verse">"Word of th' Fa-ther&mdash;now in flesh
  ap-pear-ing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It would be a great thing to be able to believe that; to be able to
  return&mdash;even for an hour&mdash;to the ecstasy of complete trust in this
  declaration. Impossible, of course. It would demand a faith that not only
  passed all understanding but wilfully dodged facts already well in hand. The
  Plan of Salvation was idealistic enough, but it wasn't working. It never
  <i>had</i> worked. It had helped Mother die quietly and with a smile, but it
  hadn't done anything to keep her alive and give her back her health. If the
  world was to be saved, it would have to escape from its own bigotries,
  diseases, slaveries. The Plan hadn't done much in this field.
  Science&mdash;not sentiment&mdash;was The Word.</p>

  <p>The house was quiet. Mrs Doyle had shut off the radio. Jack roused from
  his reverie and decided to write to Jean, at home in Oregon.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Girl:<br>
  <br>
  It is midnight here; nine with you. For the past hour I have been listening
  to Christmas carols on the landlady's radio. All afternoon I worked in the
  lab. The two things don't jibe.<br>
  <br>
  I tried to get myself back into the state of mind we used to be in when we
  were children. I honestly wished I could. Something tells me that if you want
  to be happy, you'd better not begin asking questions&mdash;about
  <u>anything.</u> And that brings up the problem&mdash;What makes one
  <u>want</u> to be happy? Have you any <u>right</u> to be happy? Is that what
  we're here for&mdash;to be <u>happy?</u></p><br>

  <p>He sat there for some minutes, tapping his teeth with his pen; decided
  impulsively that this wasn't the sort of a letter a man should write to his
  sister on Christmas Eve; crumpled the page and threw it into the
  waste-basket.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN mid-February of Beaven's senior year, the capable members
  of the class were in something of a dither.</p>

  <p>All examinations at the Medical College were to be viewed with deep
  respect, if not alarm, but on this occasion they were of momentous
  importance, for they had much to do with determining the internship
  assignments.</p>

  <p>Obviously it was impossible for more than a few, from each graduating
  class, to intern in the University Hospital under the expert eye of the
  faculty. The hospital could absorb about ten. The rest of them were expected
  to make other arrangements.</p>

  <p>Some of them, resident in far-distant places, preferred&mdash;regardless
  of their scholastic rating&mdash;to intern in the locality where they hoped
  eventually to practise. In many cases the graduate had a father, uncle, or
  influential friend in the profession who could be depended upon to secure for
  him a satisfactory berth.</p>

  <p>The prized assignments, however, which were based on high marks, entitled
  the graduate to two or three or four years in the University environment
  where he was directly under the guidance of men who were considered mentors
  in their respective specialities. Out of this fortunate group, a smaller
  number&mdash;only two or three, each year&mdash;received still more valuable
  plums in the nature of apprenticeships to certain professors in whose
  departments they had exhibited unusual interest and skill.</p>

  <p>These conferments of honour and glory did not always turn out to the
  ultimate benefit of the appointee, however desirable they appeared when
  announced at the convocation.</p>

  <p>Graduate Jones, having shown a natural flair for aural surgery, would be
  taken under the wing of Professor Smith, the king-pin in Otology. Young Jones
  had access to Smith's personal laboratory where he became a little of
  everything from dish-washer to researchist. He stood at his chief's elbow in
  difficult operations; and, in certain sublime moments, assisted. He fagged
  for Dr Smith with all the humility of a lackey; drove back to the house to
  get Smith's other pair of glasses; telephoned social messages of regret when
  there was some expert lying to be done which couldn't be trusted to the
  artless Miss Wonderly, the office secretary.</p>

  <p>After the wistful young Jones had been sharpening Smith's lead pencils,
  keeping track of Smith's lecture-notes, and taking Smith's car down town to
  be lubricated&mdash;for a couple of years&mdash;he might be permitted to turn
  out, some inclement night, to minister to the chronic ear-ache of Grandma
  Perkins, one of Smith's private patients who had been bequeathed to him and
  his heirs and assigns for ever by the late Professor Brown, his predecessor
  in the Chair of Otology.</p>

  <p>From then on, young Jones's future was unpredictable. He might remain as
  Smith's associate, receiving more and more work of the sort that the chief
  didn't care to bother with. In this capacity there was plenty of sound
  experience to be had, both in aural surgery and clandestine starvation. If
  Smith considerately died before Jones was too infirm to be of any practical
  use, the latter&mdash;assuming he had made himself solid with the
  powers&mdash;might succeed to the Chair. Here the odds were against him,
  however, for there was a frequent clamour for new blood on the faculty; and
  some of the Directors seemed to feel that the classic remark: "A prophet is
  not without honour save in his own country," was one of the ten commandments,
  instead of a dismaying comment on the valuation of merit according to its
  geographical remoteness.</p>

  <p>Desperate at thirty-three, Jones might tug loose to engage in private
  practice, in which he might do very well if his drudgeries as Smith's valet,
  stooge, and boot-licker had not demolished his personality. The appointment
  was thought to be a plum, but it was as dangerous as dynamite and it ditched
  more men than it distinguished.</p>

  <p>Tubby Forrester had been without a graduate assistant since the first of
  the year. Young Royce, who had held the post for five years, had gone to
  teach Anatomy in the deep South. Tubby had been enraged; but, having observed
  that Royce was determined to go, had aided him in securing a good
  position.</p>

  <p>Everybody was curious to know whether Tubby now intended to tap someone
  for the vacant job. Unquestionably he needed an able assistant, for he was
  known to be up to his ears in some private experiments in neuropathology;
  incubation stuff that required no end of diligent and expert attention. As
  the matter stood, Tubby was obliged to visit his laboratory at all sorts of
  odd hours&mdash;holidays, midnights, mealtimes&mdash;to note the successive
  phenomena disclosed by his chemical concoctions.</p>

  <p>Of course, Jack Beaven was the logical candidate for this position.
  Anybody could tell you that. Beaven knew so much more about the physical
  aspects of neurology than anyone else in the class that comparisons were
  merely silly. He had a peculiar genius for it. And but for their personal
  animosity, it was inevitable that Tubby would appoint him. That factor,
  however, made the problem too difficult. It was beyond anyone's imagination
  that Tubby would sentence himself to such constant and intimate contact with
  a man he had taunted and insulted; nor was it likely that Beaven would accept
  the job, in the improbable event of its being offered to him. Under normal
  circumstances it was exactly the opportunity he would most need and desire,
  but not at the price of enduring&mdash;every day and at close
  range&mdash;humiliations he could neither avoid nor avenge.</p>

  <p>During the past year, Jack had accepted Tubby's jabs and jibes in the
  classroom without attempting to defend himself. On one occasion,
  however&mdash;only a week before the examinations&mdash;he had shown that his
  docility must be accounted for on other grounds than fear. The incident had
  not improved their personal relations.</p>

  <p>Dr Maxwell, grand old exponent of abdominal surgery, had done a most
  interesting operation on an ulcer requiring the removal of a short section of
  the small intestine. The demonstration was made before the senior clinic, the
  students giving it their rapt attention. During the operation, Dr Maxwell
  explained that such was the rapidity of natural repair at this point that the
  suture would be complete and the intestine ready to resume its normal
  processes at the expiration of four hours.</p>

  <p>He further declared that the sphincter muscle at the pyloric orifice of
  the stomach contracted, immediately upon the beginning of the operation, and
  remained taut for five hours, to prevent the contents of the stomach from
  proceeding into the intestine, thus giving the lesion plenty of time to heal
  itself before going to work again.</p>

  <p>After the patient had been wheeled out, still unconscious, the doctor
  said: "This act of the pyloric sphincter, which makes the operation possible,
  is to be studied in the field of Neurology. If you want to know anything
  about that phase of it, you must take it up with Dr Forrester. And if he
  explains it so that you think you understand it, you will know a great deal
  more about it than I do."</p>

  <p>Evidently someone had queried Tubby on the subject; for, next morning, in
  his lecture&mdash;they were in the midst of a course on the surgery of the
  autonomic nervous system&mdash;Tubby made reference to the case.</p>

  <p>"Before presenting the conventional theories held by students of
  Neurology, I think it might be of interest to learn your own deductions. I
  would like to have each of you write a paper to be submitted next Thursday.
  This assignment," he added, with a sly smile, "will afford an opportunity for
  those of you, who still believe in miracles, to let yourselves go, and give
  us a real taste of the glad evangel. I may ask Brother Beaven to read us his
  sermon aloud. We would be gratified if he could find a helpful moral lesson,
  based on this text."</p>

  <p>It was generally believed that Tubby would not carry out this threat. By
  Thursday he would have forgotten about it. But Jack decided to be prepared,
  in the event that he was called upon to read his paper before the class.</p>

  <p>Having concluded his Thursday lecture, Tubby said: "And now we will hear
  from Mr Beaven. He has been requested to give us a few remarks on the wisdom
  of the pylorus. It is to be hoped he will add something to the sum of accrued
  knowledge on this matter.... Mr Beaven, I suggest that you come to the
  front where your fellow-scientists may see and hear you without risking a
  cervic dislocation."</p>

  <p>Jack had enjoyed his task of preparing the paper. The subject was of
  immense interest to him. He spared no pains in collecting information. It was
  a scholarly essay, and the class listened to it with utmost
  concentration.</p>

  <p>Briefly recapitulating the diagnosis, and the steps in the operation, he
  proceeded to discuss the peculiar emergency-act of the sphincter valve.</p>

  <p>"It has been shown by Dr Maxwell," continued Beaven, "that the sphincter
  muscle closed tightly, upon the instant that the intestine was severed, and
  remained closed until an hour after sufficient time had elapsed for Nature to
  complete the repair.</p>

  <p>"Obviously, the autonomic system provided that a signal be given, arising
  at the point of the injury, and conveyed to the sphincter muscle. This
  explanation, however, does not suffice. The presence of the ulcer had already
  constituted an injury to the intestine, an injury serious enough to suggest
  that the acidulous contents of the stomach, continuing to flow past the
  damaged area, would make the lesion increasingly dangerous.</p>

  <p>"No such signal was sent to the sphincter; or, if sent, it was unheeded,
  the sphincter having decided, apparently, that in spite of the unhappy
  circumstances the business of digestion must carry on. At the moment,
  however, that the operation began, which gave promise of a remedy for the
  injured area, the sphincter was willing to co-operate. Up to that time, the
  sphincter knew there was no use doing anything about it."</p>

  <p>The class was vastly entertained by Beaven's evident plan to edge over
  into the field of ethics. Everybody's eyes darted to and fro from Tubby's
  face to Jack's. Tubby's was a study. He sat with averted eyes, toying with
  his little moustache, listening with respectful attention.</p>

  <p>"It has been suggested," Jack went on, "that the moral implications on
  this problem be set forth. In the capacity of class homilist, I venture to
  call your attention, brethren and sisters, to the extraordinary common-sense
  displayed by the pyloric sphincter. It is informed, through the autonomic
  nervous system, that something is going on in a gut which, if continued for
  very long, will bring the whole institution to ruin.</p>

  <p>"An unwise, impatient, unstable pyloric sphincter would be apt to say to
  the damaged intestine: 'It is obvious that you are no good. You are here to
  do your part in the digestion of food for the nourishment of the whole body.
  You are not attending to your business. Indeed, every additional task you are
  asked to perform makes you less and less able to brace up and carry on. That
  being the case, I shall clamp down hard, and there will be no more work of
  any sort for you to do. Your resignation is accepted. The funeral will occur
  on Monday. Friends may send flowers, or omit them at the announced desire of
  the relatives, and be privately damned for their discourtesy.'"</p>

  <p>Tubby unexpectedly grinned at this, and the class gave Jack the benefit of
  an appreciative laugh.</p>

  <p>"But because the sphincter is wise," continued the paper, "with a wisdom
  out of all proportion to that which is commonly thought to be seated
  somewhere between the cowlick and the collar-button, it permits the contents
  of the stomach to flow through; reluctantly, and wishing the circumstances
  otherwise, but unwilling to close out the whole business in a mood of
  exasperated superiority.</p>

  <p>"In my opinion, dearly beloved, however miraculous may seem the decisive
  act of the pylorus in shutting down for a period of five hours&mdash;when it
  had become apparent that an outside force was at work to insure the repair of
  the injured intestine&mdash;this phenomenon is not as difficult to understand
  as the patience of the sphincter in refusing to exercise drastic judgment
  through the days when things aren't going as they should.</p>

  <p>"One feels that the easiest thing a sphincter can do, under such
  conditions, is to close up. The act that reveals its wisdom is its
  forbearance and restraint in the presence of another organ's disability."</p>

  <p>There was a momentary pause; and then, in a serious tone which couldn't
  quite be evaluated&mdash;whether it was spoken in irony or in
  earnest&mdash;Beaven added: "'Grant this, Lord, unto us all.'"</p>

  <p>Tubby arose during the round of generous applause and when it was quiet he
  said: "Brother Beaven's sentimental discussion of the tender mercy practised
  by the wise little sphincter valve has been most inspiring. Were it not for
  the fact that we might disturb our neighbours, I would suggest that we close
  this meeting with the Long Metre Doxology.... The
  congregation&mdash;without further benefit of clergy&mdash;stands
  dismissed."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>On the day after the mid-term recess, there was a convocation of the
  senior class. It was understood that at this assembly the list of internships
  would be read. Tubby, as the chairman of the faculty committee on such
  assignments, delivered a brief address, reasserting&mdash;and
  deploring&mdash;the fact that the University Hospital could not provide room
  for a larger number.</p>

  <p>The place was very quiet, very tense. Those who felt they were on the
  border-line where their acceptance or rejection might have been determined by
  the mere fraction of a point, listened with strained faces and pounding
  hearts. Tubby pinched on his gold glasses and took up the paper.</p>

  <p>Jack Beaven's name headed the list. There was a little gasp of surprise,
  and a spontaneous burst of applause. Tubby flushed slightly and held up his
  hand in a signal for order. For a moment or two thereafter, he stood blinking
  indecisively as if he might be contemplating a comment but apparently thought
  better of it and continued reading. Having set itself a pattern for behaviour
  in the reception of this news, the class applauded all the names as they were
  announced. Tony Wollason made no attempt to conceal his joy when, at the end
  of the list, he found himself among the immortals.</p>

  <p>As for the special appointments, only two, said Tubby, were being made
  this year. Mr Thomas, whose work in blood-and-skin had shown promise, would
  be invited to serve as student assistant to Dr Meeker. The class offered
  felicitations to Thomas with a brief clapping of hands. No one knew Thomas
  very well. He was a mole.</p>

  <p>Tubby tapped his papers into precise alignment, signifying that the event
  was about to be concluded. He took off his glasses and seemed uncertain about
  the manner in which his final announcement should be phrased.</p>

  <p>"And now," he said, with a half-derisive smile, "I find myself about to
  emulate the mysterious wisdom of the pyloric sphincter."</p>

  <p>The class, quick to catch the significance of Tubby's allusion, burst into
  applause. Say what you liked about the old demon, he was a good sport!
  Tubby's stock was riding a strong bullish market.</p>

  <p>Jack's face coloured a little as he realized that everybody was curious to
  learn his thoughts.</p>

  <p>Tubby went on, quietly.</p>

  <p>"I am asking Brother Beaven to hold forth in my own laboratory through the
  coming year. He will serve as my private chaplain. He will spend the
  remainder of his time with one eye on my test-tubes and the other on the
  clock; or, when the experiment is more deliberate, on the almanac." He
  paused, reflectively. "This appointment," continued Tubby, feeling his way,
  with narrowed eyes, "may be somewhat in the nature of a surprise. If anyone
  ever tells you that these special appointments at the Medical College are
  based upon personal congeniality, or favouritism, or that they are withheld
  because of temperamental antipathy or private prejudice, I hope you will be
  able to remember that Beaven and I are at work together solely in the
  interest of neurological research."</p>

  <p>It was quite a dramatic moment. The class felt that it had been let in on
  a most unusual scene. The more analytical ones, who thought they knew
  something about psychology, guessed that Tubby&mdash;not quite up to the
  exactions of a private chat with Jack, on the subject of their
  relationship&mdash;was defining his own attitude in this open session; a
  strange procedure, but not stranger than many another impulsive act of the
  erratic neurologist.</p>

  <p>Tubby signified that he had said his say, and bowed in mock deference
  toward his rather bewildered appointee. Suddenly the room was deathly still.
  Jack had risen to his feet. He bowed respectfully to Tubby, and said, in a
  steady voice: "I shall do my best, sir. I, too, believe that 'the ship is
  more than the crew'."</p>

  <p>"You mean," said Tubby, "you don't have to like the captain in order to
  obey him?"</p>

  <p>Jack nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's what I mean, sir," he said, and sat down.</p>

  <p>"This," said Tubby, "is a good example of the scientific spirit....
  That will be all. You are at liberty."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Among the scattered members of the medical profession who, as former
  students and interns, had experienced shabby treatment at Dr Forrester's
  hands, not many had nourished a lasting ill-will.</p>

  <p>For the most part they spoke of him in about the same way that they
  remembered certain upperclassmen in college who had paddled them inexcusably
  on the night of their fraternity initiation. It was something to be laughed
  over, after a few years had passed.</p>

  <p>There was a small number, however, to whom Tubby's ruthlessness was no
  joke and would never be a joke though they lived to a hundred; men who had
  been hectored and badgered and finally canned out of school because, perhaps
  quite inadvertently, they had ruffled the old cock's feathers.</p>

  <p>Not infrequently, through the years, a chap would suddenly pack up and
  leave the Medical College or the hospital, unable to endure any more
  indignities. In such cases the fellow was likely to deliver to his intimates
  a malediction, swearing by all the larger gods and smaller fishes that he
  would get even with Tubby sometime, somewhere, somehow. But, as was to be
  expected from so much heat and bluster, the tumult subsided as fresher frets
  or more profitable engagements distracted the attention of the injured. So,
  Tubby had never been actually kicked out of the window or torn limb from
  limb, as had often been unpleasantly predicted.</p>

  <p>It was a common remark among the medics&mdash;and younger fry on the
  faculty, too&mdash;that eventually Tubby would get his block knocked off, but
  everyone knew that an earnest wish had sired the forecast and that nobody
  would ever go to the length of doing physical damage to Tubby, however much
  such chastisement might be merited.</p>

  <p>Dr Lawrence Carpenter, ex-member of the Medical School's class of 1920,
  hadn't blustered nor threatened when in the middle of his third year he had
  departed. He had left a brief note for Dr Forrester stating in calm,
  business-like phrases that he felt he would be more comfortable in another
  medical college. There was a postscript which said: "I'll be seeing you, one
  day, I hope."</p>

  <p>Young Carpenter's chief offence had been of negligible importance. He was
  of a wealthy family, had been accustomed to spending his large allowance
  freely, dressed expensively and rather flashily, lived in a ritzy apartment,
  and drove about in a long rakish roadster that had enough engine-power to
  drag ten times its weight at an unlawful speed.</p>

  <p>Apparently it had never occurred to Larry Carpenter that in an environment
  where most of the people lived modestly, if not indeed with a pathetic
  frugality, his reckless extravagance might excite unfavourable comment.</p>

  <p>Fortunately offsetting this bad habit, Larry was co-operative, democratic,
  genial. He always pulled more than his share of the load when something was
  afoot requiring class funds, and did it unobtrusively. He entertained
  frequently and his guests were not selected either on a basis of their having
  or not having ample means of their own. Beyond question, some of his
  fellow-students envied him, but not bitterly. Frequently they ragged him
  about his extensive wardrobe and a few of the more audacious called him
  "Gotrocks" to his face, but nobody tried to make his life difficult; nobody
  but Tubby Forrester.</p>

  <p>Tubby had taken a savage dislike to Carpenter at once. It was commonly
  believed this aversion could be accounted for by the simple fact that
  Carpenter was not a very diligent student, that he took all the cuts, that he
  was frequently tardy, and&mdash;more particularly&mdash;that he refused to be
  cowed by Tubby's satirical rebukes. But, in the opinion of a few of the more
  discerning, Tubby didn't like the idea of Larry's financial rating. It gave
  him an air of independence. When Tubby wanted to administer reproach, he went
  at it scientifically, studying his victim's vulnerable spots and taking an
  unerring aim at the point where he could do the most damage. But he never was
  quite able to call his shots when he went after Larry. Larry would grin, as
  if he might be saying: "Entertain yourself, Doc, but keep it in mind that I'm
  not actually obliged to stay here." Now and again, in private, someone would
  suggest that Tubby was jealous. And there was no question about his fondness
  for good things. He dressed very well, owned a car that made most of the
  vehicles parked in that vicinity look like junk. When he went to Europe in
  the summer his stateroom was on A-deck in a five-day ship. Tubby was
  well-to-do, and didn't object to your knowing it.</p>

  <p>That may have had something to do with his feeling towards Larry
  Carpenter, or it may not. But, at all events, Tubby began early to ride
  Larry, insinuating&mdash;when the unhappy fellow had muffed a difficult or
  purposely confusing question&mdash;that perhaps if less time were spent on
  physical adornment and a little more on mental beautification his chances of
  graduating would be improved. When someone else had failed to answer a
  question, Tubby was almost sure to gaze disgustedly at Larry, and say: "And
  <i>you</i> wouldn't know; <i>would</i> you?"&mdash;until, one day, Larry put
  an end to that mode of address by answering, impertinently: "I wouldn't."</p>

  <p>But finally the time came when Carpenter couldn't stand any more, and he
  left. And perhaps that might have been the end of the story if Tubby hadn't
  persisted in his animosity. When queried by the Dean of a seaboard medical
  college, to which Larry had applied for admission, Tubby had let loose a
  reply that practically insured a rejection. Maybe Tubby thought he was merely
  being honest. He wrote that Carpenter was an indifferent student, which was a
  fact, and added that if he had less money and more brains it would be to his
  advantage.</p>

  <p>Pretty well baffled but not beaten, Larry had taken the matter up with the
  Carpenters' family physician, who made a prompt and thorough investigation,
  with the result that Larry was accepted, after considerable delay. But, word
  having leaked that he was entering at this odd hour&mdash;within a month of
  the end of the college year&mdash;because of trouble elsewhere, he was
  received merely on approval. Having benefited none by his unpleasant
  experience, he continued to live in a manner quite out of step with the
  prevailing economy, which did little to set him right in the opinion of an
  institution that already viewed him askance. So&mdash;he had a tough time
  there; was obliged, upon graduation, to intern in a hospital where the range
  of clinical material was limited; and felt that he was badly used, all
  around.</p>

  <p>A dispassionate invoice of his woes might have shown that he was
  responsible for them himself. Even his close friends realized that he should
  have known he couldn't act the playboy and expect preferments at the hands of
  earnest people who slaved while they skimped. In Larry's opinion, however,
  Tubby Forrester was the fellow who had done him in, and the more he brooded
  over it the more dangerous was his deepening resolution to get even.</p>

  <p>The problem of breaking into active practice&mdash;perplexing enough under
  the most favourable circumstances&mdash;proved insurmountable. He was
  accepted on the staff of a reputable private clinic where it was hoped he
  might increase a desirable clientele because of his acquaintance with the
  society set, but apparently his social connections had more confidence in him
  at the bridge-table than the operating-table, and they shunned his sumptuous
  office as if some lethal contagion were raging there. This finished him
  off.</p>

  <p>With a half-dozen rich and idle cronies he went on an extended cruise in
  the South Seas which turned out to be a protracted binge. Until then,
  although convivial, Larry was more temperate than most of his sort. Now that
  he was afloat, physically and emotionally, he loosened the restraints.
  Whenever he was remorseful and jittery and idiotically self-piteous, he laid
  all the blame for his failures and excesses on to Tubby, and concocted
  ingenious plans for vengeance.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, when he was at loose ends&mdash;he always got mean and
  quarrelsome whenever he tried to drink himself up out of a hangover&mdash;he
  would mumble his griefs and confide his sinister programme of retaliation,
  but nobody paid any attention to him, further than to tell him he was just a
  damn' fool, plastered to the eyebrows, which, while true enough, didn't quite
  cover the case. Larry meant it, even when sober.</p>

  <p>The end of the year had come, and the Medical College had finished its
  work. There had been a few days' recess which the seniors had spent
  idly&mdash;if they were remaining&mdash;or packing their dunnage if they were
  leaving for good. Commencement Week was at hand and the town was filling with
  visitors, parents, alumni, and wiseacres from neighbouring colleges.</p>

  <p>Carpenter, whose University class was having a reunion, had announced to a
  score of intimates that he was throwing a party on Tuesday night at the
  Livingstone Hotel. Immediately after the baseball game, they were to join him
  in the suite he had engaged. It was a roistering event, the management of the
  hotel admitting afterwards that while their house was not unused to racket
  and breakage, an all-time record for damage and disorder had undoubtedly been
  achieved. Larry saw his guests off to their rooms at dawn but he did not go
  to bed. For breakfast he had a large bowl of onion soup, some bicarbonate of
  soda, and two Scotch highballs. Then he took a hot bath, nervously shaved his
  chin full of nicks, and called for his car.</p>

  <p>Arriving at the Medical College campus at eight, he proceeded to Tubby's
  office, hopeful of finding him there early. He was unarmed, but there was the
  light of battle in his swollen eyes.</p>

  <p>Tubby was seated at his desk when Larry entered, without knocking. He was
  presently leaving for the University Administration Building, where the
  faculty contingent of the Commencement procession would mobilize for the
  customary parade to the Auditorium, where in the absence of Dean Emery, he
  would read the names of the young medical men entitled to degrees. His
  impressive black gown, with the symbolic green snakes climbing a pole
  embroidered on the sleeve, was draped across the back of a chair, his gold
  and green and black silk hood was folded on the desk, and his mortar-board
  with the bright gold tassel reposed on top of it; well-deserved trappings
  which he had worn every Commencement for sixteen years, but was not to wear
  to-day, on account of an accident which Prexy regretfully announced when
  stating that Dr Osgood would present the candidates for the
  degree&mdash;Doctor of Medicine.</p>

  <p>He glanced up at the intruder, whom he failed to recognize immediately,
  blinked a few times, and laid down his pen.</p>

  <p>"I see you don't remember me, Tubby," rasped Carpenter, truculently. "You
  gave me the sack, six years ago, and then pursued me with a dirty letter to
  discredit me."</p>

  <p>"You're drunk," said Tubby. "I suggest that you go somewhere and sleep it
  off. Then, if you think you want to talk to me, I shall listen to you."</p>

  <p>Larry lurched forward, spread out both hands on the desk, and growled:
  "Well, if I'm drunk, that's your fault. And what I've got to say to you, I'm
  goin' to say&mdash;right now!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you'd better pretend you're a gentleman," advised Tubby, loftily.
  "If you insist on talking, take off your hat, and sit down. And be
  brief."</p>

  <p>"I take my hat off," said Carpenter, thickly, "only in places worthy of a
  decent man's respect. And I haven't come here to sit down and visit. I
  promised myself, long time ago, I would come back here, some time when it was
  convenient, and punch your nose. And this is the day. Maybe it will be rather
  awkward for you&mdash;my showing up just as you are getting ready to go over
  to the Auditorium and show off your finery, but that's your picnic, not mine.
  If you want to wear a lot o' colours, you might as well have a red beak and a
  black eye. Now&mdash;will you take it sitting, or would you prefer to stand
  up?"</p>

  <p>"I'll stand, thank you," said Tubby, pushing back his chair. "I haven't
  had much experience in fighting. I've delegated all that to my dog."</p>

  <p>Larry moved around the corner of the desk and stood with feet wide
  apart.</p>

  <p>"Better take your glasses off," he warned.</p>

  <p>Tubby thought so too, and laid them down deliberately.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity to spoil that mug," taunted Carpenter, taking a step
  forward.</p>

  <p>At that instant, Tubby waded in courageously. He had spoken the truth
  about his inexperience in fighting. He whanged away wildly with both hands
  and both eyes shut. Carpenter backed off a little and took his measure; then
  he began to fulfil his promise. Tubby's valour was in fine fettle, but his
  technique was bad. He left his stomach unguarded until his wind gave out, and
  then he began leading with his chin. His flesh was soft and Carpenter's
  knuckles were hard. Presently they were in the centre of the room, Tubby
  having felt that he needed more space, and Larry willing to accommodate him.
  Now there was a bad cut over Tubby's left eye and his nose was bleeding. The
  battle was going to be over, pretty soon. They both felt that
  confidently.</p>

  <p>Then the door opened.</p>

  <p>Beaven had been in Tubby's laboratory to check the temperature of an
  incubation. On his way out he heard the sound of scuffling in the office. For
  a moment he stood listening intently; then opened the door. The belligerents
  paused to take note of his arrival. Tubby was panting hard. His face was
  white as chalk, and bleeding in a half-dozen places.</p>

  <p>"Get out of here!" yelled Carpenter, as Beaven stepped between them. "I
  mean to finish this job!"</p>

  <p>Tubby leaned back wearily against the edge of the desk, holding on for
  support and swaying dizzily. Carpenter elbowed Beaven aside and drew back his
  arm to apply the final blow. Before he had a chance to deliver it, he found
  himself suddenly whirled about.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;you want to be in it too, do you?" he snarled, facing his new
  antagonist. "Well, take <i>that!</i>" He struck savagely, but the blow fell
  short.</p>

  <p>Jack didn't relish the task that had fallen to him, for it was plainly
  evident that the big fellow was in a drunken frenzy, but it was no time to be
  considerate. He saw no reason for prolonging the engagement. The chap was
  running wild, and would have to be put away promptly and decisively. He
  deliberately selected a spot on the mandible, just below the second bicuspid,
  where the foramen gives exit to the mental branch of the fifth nerve, and
  struck it a sledge-hammer blow that would have knocked the bronze image of a
  major-general out of his saddle. Carpenter's knees buckled under him and he
  dropped limply to the floor.</p>

  <p>Taking up the telephone, Jack asked for the Medical Library. Only ten
  minutes ago he had left Wollason there, who had gone in to return some books,
  and was to wait until Jack finished his errand in the laboratory.</p>

  <p>"Come up to Dr Forrester's office," he said, quietly. "There has been a
  little accident. Don't say anything&mdash;and come quickly."</p>

  <p>Tubby had groped his way around to the other side of the desk and was
  slumped in his chair. He roused with an effort and watched Beaven who, down
  on one knee, was examining the fallen warrior.</p>

  <p>"Is he badly hurt?" asked Tubby huskily.</p>

  <p>Jack turned back an eyelid, felt the pulse, unbuttoned the man's
  collar.</p>

  <p>"He'll come around, presently," he said. "Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"Former student here," mumbled Tubby. "Drunken bounder."</p>

  <p>"Umm," Jack nodded, comprehendingly.</p>

  <p>"I hope we may be able to keep this quiet," said Tubby, with a dry
  throat.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>Tony Wollason opened the door and surveyed the scene with wide eyes.</p>

  <p>"Jeze!" he exclaimed. "What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Shut the door, Tony. This drunken bruiser came here and assaulted Dr
  Forrester. It's quite important this doesn't get out. Give him a sniff of
  something and stay here with him until he is able to stand up. Then take him
  to Doyle's in a taxi and put him in my bed. Don't do it until you're sure the
  building is cleared. Everybody will be over at the Auditorium presently."</p>

  <p>"But, hell, Jack&mdash;how about Commencement?"</p>

  <p>"We'll be there in time for our diplomas." Beaven turned to his stricken
  chief. "Now, Doctor, if you're able, we will go over to your laboratory, and
  I'll try to put you together again." Taking him by the arm, he led Tubby out
  through the lecture-room and into the small laboratory where he eased him
  into a chair. Tubby was pale and shaky.</p>

  <p>"Nauseated?" inquired Jack, coldly professional. He lighted the gas under
  a small sterilizer.</p>

  <p>"A little," gulped Tubby, feebly.</p>

  <p>"Want to throw up or lie down&mdash;or both?" Jack's tone was dryly
  indifferent. He went to a glass case and laid out a pair of scissors, a roll
  of antiseptic gauze, a spool of adhesive tape, and a couple of surgical
  needles.</p>

  <p>Tubby retched ominously and Jack brought him a basin. Then, going out into
  the anatomical laboratory, he wheeled in an autopsy table and helped his
  distinguished patient to spread himself upon it. Tubby sank back with a
  groan. Jack began sponging the bloody wounds.</p>

  <p>"Fortunate&mdash;you&mdash;arrived," muttered Tubby, at length. "The
  fellow&mdash;would have beaten me&mdash;to death."</p>

  <p>"Probably," drawled Jack, swabbing the open cuts with an earnest
  antiseptic. "That's why I stopped him. We can't have you killed, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"He came up&mdash;to try to settle&mdash;an old score," explained Tubby,
  clenching his hands as the disinfectant bit deep.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I don't know how much he owed you"&mdash;Jack paused to rig a
  needle&mdash;"but he seems to have paid off quite a bit of it."</p>

  <p>Tubby grinned sourly and closed his eyes as the needle-work began, but did
  not flinch.</p>

  <p>"Took me by surprise," mumbled Tubby.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you should have been surprised, sir," said Jack, his eyes
  intent upon the delicate task. "You've had several good lickings coming to
  you, for a long time&mdash;if you don't mind my saying so."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you think <i>you</i> owe me one," commented Tubby, painfully. "If
  so, why did you interfere?"</p>

  <p>"Because you are very important to neurological surgery, for one thing.
  And, besides, I want to know a lot of things that nobody else knows&mdash;but
  you." Jack deliberately took up the scissors and snipped the dangling ends
  from a suture.</p>

  <p>Tubby opened his eyes and stared up into Jack's impassive face.</p>

  <p>"That," he declared solemnly, "is the most cold-blooded remark that was
  ever made&mdash;by one man to another&mdash;in the history of the world."</p>

  <p>Jack rethreaded the needle deftly and resumed his work on a fresh
  area.</p>

  <p>"Knowing how you feel, sir, on the subject of sympathy and
  sentimentality," said Jack, "I thank you. If our positions were reversed, you
  would have no very good reason for sparing my life."</p>

  <p>"You do yourself an injustice, Brother Beaven," replied Tubby, squinting
  acknowledgment of the next stitch. "I can make good use of you."</p>

  <p>Jack regarded his patient with a new interest.</p>

  <p>"After what has happened to-day?" he queried. "I shouldn't have thought
  you would ever want to see me again."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not&mdash;if you were doing this as a personal favour. In that
  event I might feel at a disadvantage. But you have considered this a
  professional duty. You didn't want to see me killed because I have
  information you need. And you are sewing me up for the same reason. I owe you
  nothing. If our positions were&mdash;as you say&mdash;reversed, I would have
  taken the same attitude toward you, I think. You will be of great service to
  me as an assistant here in the laboratory. I shouldn't want to lose you."</p>

  <p>Jack sheared off a strip of adhesive from the spool and applied it to
  Tubby's cheek.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear you say, sir, that our relations are to remain purely
  professional. Now that this is mutually understood, we can work together more
  efficiently."</p>

  <p>"More efficiently than what?" growled Tubby.</p>

  <p>"Than if you were afraid I might develop&mdash;by propinquity&mdash;some
  personal liking for you, sir. You may safely dismiss any such apprehension."
  Jack smoothed on the last strip of adhesive with firm fingers. "Want to sit
  up now? How does it feel?"</p>

  <p>"Good job," admitted Tubby.</p>

  <p>"Your car out in the lot?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I'll drive you home. You live at the University Club, don't you? We'll
  try to get you in without too much excitement."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Brother Beaven, but I don't care to accept any further
  attentions. You may go on now about your business."</p>

  <p>"I made the suggestion, sir, because we must keep this affair quiet. I
  don't believe you can do it&mdash;by yourself. And I don't want you worried
  over the chatter that might result if this got noised about."</p>

  <p>Tubby snarled.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be any of your damn' business if I was worried."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," contradicted Jack, "but it most certainly would be of
  personal concern and disadvantage to me if you were hectored by humiliating
  gossip. In that case you couldn't possibly be at your best. Your mind would
  be distracted. You are a very important scientist and I want to have access
  to you at your fittest. Otherwise"&mdash;he tossed a negligent gesture that
  dismissed the whole matter&mdash;"otherwise&mdash;I shouldn't care two whoops
  in hell if everybody in the world heard about your squabble with this
  fellow&mdash;and laughed. Am I making myself clear?"</p>

  <p>Tubby blinked thoughtfully for a minute and replied grimly: "In that case,
  you may drive me home." He tugged his keys out of his pocket with a hand that
  still trembled. "I'll meet you&mdash;out in front."</p>

  <p>"Think you can get downstairs by yourself, sir?" asked Jack, doubtfully.
  "Perhaps you'd better come along with me&mdash;and let me steady you a bit.
  You're pretty badly shaken, you know."</p>

  <p>"Do as I tell you!" barked Tubby.</p>

  <p>"Cigarette?" Jack offered his opened packet.</p>

  <p>"I'll smoke my own," growled Tubby, fumbling in his coat pocket.</p>

  <p>"Light?" Jack struck a match.</p>

  <p>Tubby shook his head.</p>

  <p>Jack grinned&mdash;and left the room.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The problem of getting Tubby into the University Club without stirring up
  a lot of interest and curiosity was gratifyingly simple. At almost any other
  time this feat would have been impossible. But all the residents and guests
  were either at the Administration Building, mobilizing for the Commencement
  parade, or at the Auditorium awaiting it. To the doorman and the elevator boy
  it was necessary only to say that there had been a little accident&mdash;of
  no consequence.</p>

  <p>"No, no, no," spluttered Tubby, when the steward wanted to go up with him
  and make him comfortable. "It's nothing. I'll be quite all right. If anyone
  inquires, tell them&mdash;tell them I'm quite all right. But&mdash;no
  callers; no telephone messages; no anything, until I notify you."</p>

  <p>Having unloaded his responsibility, Jack was undecided what to do with the
  car. He didn't know where Tubby kept it and disliked to inquire. It might
  bring on a flood of questions. So he drove on, turned the corner, and headed
  toward his rooming-house. Tony would probably be waiting there for further
  instructions.</p>

  <p>Parking the coupé in front of the Doyle house, Jack went upstairs and met
  Tony in the hallway.</p>

  <p>"How's your rambunctious friend by now?" asked Jack.</p>

  <p>"Asleep," said Tony. "He got so noisy that I had to put him away. After
  all, we're graduating and the procession is forming right now. We ought to be
  there. I haven't toiled and starved for years to let some drunken bum keep me
  from&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You and me&mdash;both," agreed Jack. "How much did you give him: enough
  to hold him until we get back?"</p>

  <p>"Bet your life," muttered Tony. "I gave him the needle. He ought to be
  contented until two o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Hope you didn't overdo it."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;only a quarter grain&mdash;and just a mere sliver more&mdash;to
  be generous."</p>

  <p>"Come on, then. Have you told Lady Doyle?"</p>

  <p>Tony nodded.</p>

  <p>They went down to the car. Jack started the motor and they pushed off
  toward the Auditorium.</p>

  <p>"I've got to get some sort of message to Osgood&mdash;or
  somebody&mdash;accounting for Tubby's absence," he said, anxiously. "Can't
  quite decide how to do it. Anything to suggest? I asked Tubby what
  explanation he wanted given but he was still too unhooked to hatch a bright
  idea."</p>

  <p>"Tell 'em he was injured slightly in an explosion," said Tony helpfully.
  "That'll be near enough the truth." They both chuckled at this and Jack
  agreed that it was a good thought.</p>

  <p>"I'll write a note and pass it in to Osgood or Shane or someone," he said,
  suddenly relieved. "That will save questions and answers."</p>

  <p>"Right!&mdash;and the old buzzard can fill in the details when he gets
  around to it," assisted Tony. "Gosh!&mdash;but Tubby took an awful lickin'!
  How many stitches did he need?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't count 'em," said Jack soberly, unwilling to share Tony's
  sardonic glee. "Dozen or so, maybe."</p>

  <p>"Did you have a good time?" pressed Tony.</p>

  <p>"Can't say that I did," Jack's tone was serious. "I went to no bother to
  make it easy for him. But&mdash;Tubby was game. Tubby's a brute, no doubt;
  but he can take it!" There was a thoughtful silence. "Funny thing, Tony: I
  hate old Tubby like hell; but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;I know," grumbled Tony. "You hate him like hell but you think
  he's wonderful. You hate him like hell but you follow him around like a
  dog&mdash;and you're near enough like him to be his son. If I'd been in your
  place, I'd have sewed him up with Grade A sash-cord&mdash;and then I'd have
  sewed his mouth shut!"</p>

  <p>"It's the most important mouth on this campus," declared Jack. "You don't
  have to like Tubby to admit that he's a great man. Tubby's sound&mdash;all
  the way through. I'm for everything he stands for, Tony. And I liked the way
  he took his beating&mdash;and his stitches."</p>

  <p>They parked Tubby's big coupé a block from the Administration Building.
  Jack scribbled a note, and they proceeded to the main entrance where the
  faculties were assembling, bright with dear-bought colours and hot with the
  weight of their heavy robes. Finding the medical group, he pushed through the
  dignified crowd and handed his message to Shane. Then he hurried away to
  rejoin Tony and his class at the far end of the long hall where the
  graduating medics milled about, self-consciously blowing their ragged silk
  tassels out of their eyes and wishing they dared smoke a cigarette.</p>

  <p>Viewed in prospect, this graduation day had ever been a beacon light
  shining brightly in Jack's imagination. It would be&mdash;he had always
  felt&mdash;a stirring sensation to stand, at the summons of good old Prexy,
  and listen to the sonorous words, "By virtue of the authority vested in
  me&mdash;I confer upon you the degree&mdash;Doctor of Medicine". It promised
  to be a most impressive moment, to be faced with all the reverence of a
  candidate for holy orders. It was a bit disillusioning to find oneself pawing
  over the cheap black rags that lay tousled on the long tables, hunting for a
  gown that would reach below one's knees and a mortar-board big enough to fit
  an adult skull. Tony looked so funny in his No. 6 hat that Jack laughed.</p>

  <p>"Don't know how I'm going to keep the damn' thing on," muttered Tony.</p>

  <p>"Vacuum pressure," suggested Jack dryly. "That ought to hold it."</p>

  <p>In this mood they fell into line and marched to the Auditorium, well to
  the fore of the long parade&mdash;a full thousand&mdash;graduating from the
  various colleges. The big organ boomed forth Elgar's "Pomp and Circumstance".
  Somebody made a prayer. Somebody made a speech. The diploma mill began to
  grind. At exactly twelve-ten Shane came to the front of the platform and
  said, "The candidates for the degree&mdash;Doctor of Medicine&mdash;will
  please rise." They rose. Prexy, a bit mellow, indulged himself to the extent
  of a brief, informal announcement before conferring the degree. They were
  entering upon one of the most noble, most exacting, most sacrificial of the
  learned professions. "It distresses me to announce," he went on, "that Dr
  Forrester, who was to have been with us here to-day, has been hurt in a
  laboratory explosion. Early morning&mdash;Commencement Day&mdash;when, one
  would think, the Doctor might find himself at liberty from his professional
  duties, he goes to his laboratory to pursue his important experiments; and,
  in the course of his work, suffers injury. I commend to you this example of
  fidelity. You are about to set forth on a great adventure in the cause of
  human welfare. You are to be envied your high privilege: you are to remember
  that there is no discharge in this war.... And now&mdash;by virtue of the
  authority vested in me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And so&mdash;they were Doctors of Medicine. Tony had nudged Jack with his
  elbow when Prexy was decorating Tubby, <i>in absentia,</i> but Jack gave no
  sign that he thought the situation amusing.</p>

  <p>After they had disposed of their battered finery in the Administration
  Building, Jack remarked that he must now put up Tubby's car; so they
  telephoned to the University Club for instructions, drove the coupé to the
  public garage where it belonged, paused at a drug store for a sandwich and a
  glass of milk, and took a street-car to the Medical College. It was half-past
  one.</p>

  <p>"I say, Tony," said Jack, impulsively, "this fellow Carpenter left his car
  up there this morning. Maybe we'd better see what's become of it."</p>

  <p>"Think we'd recognize it?"</p>

  <p>"Probably. He's from Philadelphia. Pennsylvania licence, no doubt. If it's
  locked, we can get the keys."</p>

  <p>The car was not locked. Apparently Carpenter had been too intent on his
  errand to exercise much prudence. It was indeed a very good-looking vehicle.
  Tony said he would do the driving, this time. Mrs Doyle was rocking on the
  front verandah when they drew up. She grinned a little and remarked that they
  seemed to prefer riding to walking, to-day. Tony told her they had stolen the
  other car and traded it for this one, adding that when the police arrived she
  should tell them the robbers had left on foot.</p>

  <p>"You <i>are</i> a one," conceded Mrs Doyle, amiably.</p>

  <p>Proceeding to Jack's room, they entered without knocking and found
  Carpenter engaged in producing a yawn of large dimensions. He raised up on
  one elbow and took stock of his guests. Then his brow clouded as he
  recognized Jack. It was apparent that he anticipated some more trouble.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?" he asked, thickly.</p>

  <p>Tony volunteered to clear things up.</p>

  <p>"You are at the residence of a Mrs Doyle, who earns her living by housing
  medical men. I am <i>Doctor</i> Tony Wollason. My young friend, in whose bed
  you have been languishing, is <i>Doctor</i> Jack Beaven&mdash;a fine,
  upstanding, resolute fellow, whose acquaintance you made earlier in the day
  when you were presenting your former teacher with a bam on the snoot. Do you
  recall?"</p>

  <p>Carpenter nodded, grinned tentatively, and glanced toward Jack, uncertain
  what role he was expected to play.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he muttered. "I was drunk."</p>

  <p>"You were indeed," agreed Tony. "But&mdash;speaking unofficially, and for
  myself alone&mdash;I feel that you did a good day's work. And if it is
  customary with you to perform such services while drunk, you certainly must
  be a very useful citizen when in your right mind."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather not be kidded," said Carpenter, bristling a little. "It isn't
  very funny."</p>

  <p>"You have the right attitude, I think," said Jack soberly. "You paid off
  Dr Forrester, and now you wish you hadn't. Well&mdash;you didn't hurt him
  very badly, and we have contrived to keep the affair quiet. Nobody is going
  to know anything about it&mdash;unless you get drunk again and spill it." He
  leaned against the foot of the bed and extended an ominous index-finger
  toward Carpenter's heavy eyes. "And&mdash;if you do&mdash;you'll have me to
  settle with! As Wollason has indicated, you doubtless had cause for
  provocation and couldn't be much blamed for taking your revenge.
  But&mdash;now that you've had it&mdash;let that be sufficient. I want to go
  on record with a promise: if I ever hear&mdash;next week or ten years from
  now&mdash;that you have told what happened this morning, I shall hunt you
  down and break your neck!"</p>

  <p>"That's right, Mr Carpenter," advised Tony, pretending earnestness. "The
  little tap he gave you was a mere free sample of the standard-size wallop he
  administers when he's mad."</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" growled Jack. "This is no time for fooling.... Mr Carpenter,
  your car is out in front of the house. If you want to go, there's no reason
  why you shouldn't. If you want to use the telephone&mdash;or if there is
  anything we can do for you, we'll be happy to oblige."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Carpenter, sincerely. "You have been very kind. I'll go
  now. You needn't fear that I shall ever tell about this. I'm plenty ashamed
  of it."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I wouldn't fret too much about it," drawled Jack. "Here: let
  me give you a hand with those trousers."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Late in the afternoon Tony, rousing from a satisfactory two-hour nap,
  dressed with unusual care and sauntered over to the deserted Medical campus.
  Entering the dingy, echoing lower corridor of Lister Hall he lazily mounted
  the well-worn, creaking stairs to Tubby's private laboratory where he knew
  Jack could be found making notes on some important cultures demanding
  frequent inspection.</p>

  <p>The door was ajar, so Tony came in without knocking, crossed the room to
  the table where Jack sat hunched over the big Zeiss, and jabbed a thumb into
  his industrious friend's short ribs. Detaching himself from his occupation,
  Jack glanced up, appraised the intruder with curiosity, and returned to his
  job at the microscope.</p>

  <p>"What's up?" he mumbled, absently. "Why do you appear in this festal
  raiment, Dr Wollason? Are you to be Queen of the May?"</p>

  <p>"It had occurred to me, Professor," said Tony, "that considering we have
  had a long and eventful day we might go down into the bright lights for
  dinner. If this thought commends itself to you, and your conscience will
  permit a brief absence from this sweet-smelling garden of roses&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where had you thought we'd go, Doctor?" asked Jack without looking
  up.</p>

  <p>"How about the Livingstone? It builds up my personality amazingly to
  swagger through the lobby and sprawl in those big leather chairs."</p>

  <p>"You mean the ones in the little enclosure marked 'Reserved for Guests'? I
  never sit there. I'm a very proud and sensitive person."</p>

  <p>"There'll be no temptation to lounge in the lobby to-night. The place will
  be packed. Lots of little parties. Swarms of alumni. Much excitement. Sounds
  of revelry. Better come along. It will be good for us."</p>

  <p>Tony hadn't been very hopeful. His face lighted when Jack replied
  negligently that the idea&mdash;if one considered its source&mdash;was
  surprisingly sound, adding that he would be ready to go in five minutes.</p>

  <p>"Of course you realize," he went on, "that I shall be obliged to return to
  the house for a more suitable costume. If the Livingstone is a-buzz with
  important social functions perhaps it may aid our personality development if
  we wear dinner clothes."</p>

  <p>"Sorry," regretted Tony, "I haven't a clean dress shirt."</p>

  <p>"You shall have one of mine," said Jack, unctuously. "I shall give you the
  pleated one. I try to do one good deed every day, thus accumulating treasures
  in heaven." He closed his notebook, tossed it into the desk-drawer, and went
  to the closet for his coat.</p>

  <p>"Your manner of speech, Dr Beaven," observed Tony, "increasingly reveals
  the influence of your irreverent master." Suddenly abandoning his persiflage,
  he added seriously, "It's a solemn fact, Jack. You're more like old Tubby
  every day; do you know it? I can remember the time when Tubby's flippancies
  and sacrilegious flings annoyed you frightfully."</p>

  <p>"Thanks for the sermon, Padre," drawled Jack, reaching for his hat. "If
  you will now pronounce the benediction, we'll go and find you a shirt."</p>

  <p>"That's the sort of thing I mean, damn it!" spluttered Tony. "You ought to
  snap out of that, old son, before it gets to be a habit. You're going to be
  talking with all sorts of patients, pretty soon; people who haven't anything
  left but their religion&mdash;and&mdash;and their sentiment&mdash;and they
  won't like it.... I'm just telling you," he finished lamely. "People don't
  like Tubby. They're afraid of him. That's one of the reasons. Better look
  out."</p>

  <p>Jack gave him a comradely slap on the shoulder as they moved toward the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Tell you what we'll do, Tony," he said, teasingly. "We'll hang out our
  shingle together. I'll do the diagnosis and the treatment&mdash;and you go
  along to cheer 'em up."</p>

  <p>Tony made no reply until they were out in the air. It was evident that he
  hadn't enjoyed this spoofing.</p>

  <p>"We'll not talk any more about it," he said, glumly. "If you want to be
  just like Tubby&mdash;or even out-Tubby Tubby&mdash;go to it&mdash;and joy be
  with you."</p>

  <p>"Wonder how the old boy's getting on," reflected Jack, glad to drop the
  disquieting subject that had put a momentary constraint between them.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you'd better call up and inquire," suggested Tony.</p>

  <p>Jack chuckled.</p>

  <p>"He'd probably tell me to go to hell."</p>

  <p>"It's a very pleasant friendship," observed Tony. "Anybody can see
  that."</p>

  <p>"I don't want his friendship," growled Jack. "I want his skill, his
  information, his surgical technique. If you don't mind my tooting my own horn
  for a few measures, Tony, I'm rather proud of the fact that I can learn
  valuable lessons from a man I don't like."</p>

  <p>Tony was thoughtful for a moment before replying.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;before you canonize yourself for your magnanimity," he
  remarked, dryly, "you'd better make sure that you don't like him. I've a
  notion that this animosity between you two silly asses is superficial."</p>

  <p>"Let's talk about something else," suggested Jack. "What other ideas have
  you?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>As Tony had predicted, they had found the Livingstone unusually active.
  Arriving at seven-thirty, they had made their way slowly through the noisy
  lobby where knots of old fellows, who had dined early, were spinning yarns
  and smoking big cigars. The crowded foyer was a-twitter with feminine voices;
  wives, no doubt, temporarily left on the beach by their learned spouses.</p>

  <p>The congestion in the big dining-room had been somewhat relieved. A table
  for two was presently available.</p>

  <p>"Know those fellows?" asked Tony, indicating the pair of diners nearest
  them. Jack glanced across and took brief stock of the neighbours, who were
  finishing their dessert; urbane, greying men in their late forties. He shook
  his head.</p>

  <p>"Do you?" he asked. "Look like doctors."</p>

  <p>"The one on this side is Woodbine," said Tony, out of the corner of his
  mouth. "Buffalo. Pulmonary."</p>

  <p>Jack nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've heard of him. Good man. How did you recognize him?"</p>

  <p>"Someone pointed him out to me this morning. They're talking shop, I
  think."</p>

  <p>Jack took up the menu card.</p>

  <p>"In the humble home where I was reared," he remarked, idly, "we were
  taught that it is impolite to eavesdrop or squat at keyholes. You listen to
  their conversation&mdash;and tell me what they are saying&mdash;and I'll see
  what there is to eat."</p>

  <p>The waiter was at hand now and they gave him their orders. The man across
  from Dr Woodbine was talking earnestly.</p>

  <p>"... And one of these days, Jimmy, there's going to be a bomb dropped
  into camp. You'll see! Sometimes I think the Medical College is almost as sad
  a place as a reformatory. You take the reformatory now. Sound enough in
  theory. The state rigs up an institution for the reclamation and development
  of mishandled boys; arranges for their schooling, sports, health; provides
  shops, amusements, movies. But the whole thing falls down because the guards
  and teachers and overseers take a cynical view of the project. The boys catch
  it. They contaminate one another.... Same thing goes for the medical
  school. Dry old devils on the faculty, each obsessed with his own little
  speciality. Nobody interested in the humanitarian aspects of the profession.
  Medics get to thinking it's smart to be cold.... You take the
  situation&mdash;right here&mdash;" He lowered his voice and leaned forward to
  mutter something inaudible to the attentive young pair near-by.</p>

  <p>Tony quizzed Jack's eyes and grinned a little. "Ever talk with Cunningham
  about this?" Woodbine was saying. "He has some pretty strong convictions.
  Fearless, too.... By the way, he's making the principal speech to-night at
  the Ninety-Nine class reunion."</p>

  <p>"I know it. Wish I could get in on it."</p>

  <p>Woodbine chuckled; picked up the dinner-check, brought out his wallet.</p>

  <p>"Too bad old Tubby's laid up," he said. "They're of the same class; aren't
  they? They might put on quite a sprightly debate."</p>

  <p>The soup came on. Jack became immediately attentive to it. The older men
  pushed back their chairs and left the dining-room. Tony ventured a comment on
  what they had heard. "Most interesting," he observed.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" said Jack, indifferently. "I didn't find it so. Nothing new, is it?
  Same old complaint. Lot o' these old has-beens&mdash;too damn' lazy to keep
  up with the march of science&mdash;trying to defend their own indolence by
  making war on their betters.... Have an olive?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The foyer was practically cleared when Jack and Tony came out of the
  dining-room. At the farther end of it a close-packed little crowd was
  assembled, evidently listening to something of considerable interest.</p>

  <p>"Shall we see what's up?" asked Jack. They strolled toward the overflow
  meeting that had mobilized about the half-open door of the ordinary. It was
  one of the occasions when they found it of advantage to be tall. Twenty-five
  or thirty grizzled old chaps&mdash;easily recognizable as doctors&mdash;were
  listening to a speech. This, agreed Jack and Tony, with an exchange of
  knowing nods, would be the Medical Class of Ninety-Nine; and the speaker,
  beyond all question, was Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"Want to stay?" whispered Tony.</p>

  <p>"For a minute." Jack turned his head to listen sharply, his narrowed eyes
  aimlessly taking in the neighbours, more than half of whom were women. This
  would be natural, of course. It was probably the sort of speech that women
  would enjoy. A few feet away a pretty girl in black satin attracted his
  curiosity. She wasn't seeing anything, for her view was quite obstructed, but
  she was listening hard. Her head was tipped back a little, her eyes were
  raised, her lips were parted. It unquestionably was, thought Jack, the most
  beautiful head he had ever seen; hair so black it was midnight-blue,
  bobbed&mdash;and straight bangs that covered half of an unusually white
  forehead. Jade eardrops. Shapely ears. He began to be ashamed of himself for
  staring, but the girl was so completely unaware of his scrutiny that he
  continued to observe her. She looked foreign. Didn't seem to belong here.
  Longest lashes he had ever noticed. Their curling tips almost touched her
  brows: the brows were gracefully arched. He wasn't hearing a word that this
  Dr Cunningham was saying. He glanced out of the tail of his eye and found
  Tony raptly absorbed in the speech. Resolved to listen, he concentrated on
  the voice that sounded as if it spoke with deep feeling. Now he began to
  catch the drift of it.</p>

  <p>"Menaced by the threat of over-sophistication...."</p>

  <p>Jack's eyes travelled slowly back to the attractive girl. He was not
  naturally disposed to invoice women's physical proportions, but it occurred
  to him that a man would have to be a hardened atheist indeed if he could look
  at this girl and deny the existence of a benevolent Creator. He told himself
  he had no right to be gazing at her; but, after all, it was about the same as
  looking at a lovely picture.</p>

  <p>Standing beside her was a woman probably old enough to be her mother, a
  quite distinguished figure, blonde, intelligent, poised. They seemed somehow
  to belong together. Jack wondered if they were related; tried to find some
  facial resemblance. Suddenly the girl turned her head and looked him squarely
  in the eyes, surprising him in the act of offering her an admiration so
  utterly undisguised that his expression, he knew, was equivalent to a
  statement of his thoughts. It was exactly as if he had said, "I hope I'm
  giving you no offence, but you are the most adorable creature I ever
  saw."</p>

  <p>For an instant, she queried him with her wide eyes&mdash;a childlike
  question, as to say, "Why?" And she couldn't be blamed. She thought they had
  met&mdash;and she had forgotten&mdash;and he had remembered. He couldn't turn
  away from that inquisitive pair of eyes with a confession that he had simply
  been staring. So&mdash;he ventured a smile and was promptly rewarded. Without
  the slightest suggestion of reticence or shyness or pretence of aloofness,
  she returned his smile and resumed her interest in the address. Jack's heart
  skipped a beat. It was high time now, he felt, to attend to the meeting.
  Clearly&mdash;something had been said which had been of so much interest to
  her that she had thought he, too, had been impressed by it. That was why she
  had smiled, no doubt. That was why he had smiled, she may have thought.
  So&mdash;he listened.</p>

  <p>You had to admit that the fellow was a convincing speaker, and meant every
  word he said. But&mdash;it was the same old stuff. Appeal to sentiment.
  Doctors must be altruists. Doctors must realize their responsibility to guide
  their patients into a safe and sound thought-life. Jack scowled. Tony leaned
  forward and whispered, "Want to go?"</p>

  <p>He didn't want to go, but he mighty well knew that Tony would be curious
  if he wanted to remain. He nodded&mdash;but did not stir.</p>

  <p>"No matter how discriminating we may be in our diagnoses," Cunningham was
  saying, "no matter how skilful we are with our surgery, how canny with our
  evaluation of X-ray pictures, how thorough our pathology, our usefulness to
  our generation swings on one axis. When the laboratory becomes of paramount
  importance, and physical healing becomes the all-in-all, we are shorn of our
  greatest strength; we have declined to accept our highest commission. We are
  living in a time of amazing progress in science, and no man of our vocation
  dares lose one step in this onward progress; but it is my solemn conviction
  that when all's said that can be said about our duty to keep abreast of
  modern research and experiment, our job is primarily an affair of the heart.
  It may be tame and trite to say that love of humanity is the greatest thing
  in the world, but without that urge all the new patter of science is as
  sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. I may have all faith in the amazing
  progress of our honoured craft, our clever inventions, our efficient
  implements, our instruments of precision&mdash;but, if I have not love, I am
  nothing!"</p>

  <p>It was too, too much. Jack turned to Tony and muttered, unfortunately loud
  enough to be overheard by the girl, "Let's go. I've had enough of this
  love-bird."</p>

  <p>She looked up into his eyes with a baffled, beaten expression, as if he
  had struck her in the face. Instantly he repented of his impulsive rudeness.
  What if she was somehow related to this Cunningham? He wanted to apologize.
  For a second he lingered. Tony was pushing out through the crowd and he
  followed.</p>

  <p>They fell into step.</p>

  <p>"What did you make of that girl?" inquired Tony.</p>

  <p>"What girl?" muttered Jack.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well&mdash;never mind," drawled Tony. "You must have been pretty hard
  hit if you can't bear to speak of her to your closest playmate."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, Tony. I was still thinking about that sloppy speech. Did you
  ever&mdash;in all your life&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tony slipped his hand through Jack's arm and slowed his steps.</p>

  <p>"You said to me, this afternoon, that it is a great thing when a man can
  learn lessons from people he dislikes; people who are antipathetic,
  antagonistic. I suggest that you try this out on someone else besides old
  Tubby. Perhaps you might learn something from Cunningham."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ALTHOUGH their mutual antipathy remained unchanged, the
  three years of Jack Beaven's internship (and "apprenticeship" under Dr
  Forrester) had been speeded by interesting problems in the field of inquiry
  to which they were devoted.</p>

  <p>Beaven's work was exacting and exhausting. Not only was he expected to
  perform the usual hospital drudgeries incident to the career of an ordinary
  "house-pup", but he was obliged to toil in Tubby's laboratory where
  increasing responsibilities were shifted to his broad shoulders.</p>

  <p>Tubby never went to the length of commending him for his diligence, nor
  did he ever voice any satisfaction over the rapid development of his young
  subordinate's unusual talents, but it was plainly evident&mdash;by the
  reckless confidence with which he left important experiments in Beaven's
  hands&mdash;that he had full respect for the knowledge and skill of his loyal
  assistant.</p>

  <p>Their relationship continued to be frostily professional. Dr Forrester
  issued orders cogently, crisply, haughtily. Jack answered, "Yes, sir", in
  exactly the same metallic tone, scrupulously respectful but devoid of the
  slightest trace of amiability. They never exchanged smiles or civilities;
  never said "Good morning" or "Good night"; never told each other that it was
  a warm day or a cold one. No comments were ever offered concerning current
  events, however startling. All England could go on strike, a tropical
  hurricane could devastate the Florida coast, Lindbergh could fly to Paris;
  such matters were not mentioned between them. Conversation was infrequent,
  laconic, and restricted to business. Had it been announced, some morning,
  that the world was coming to an end at five o'clock that afternoon, neither
  would have known or cared how the other felt about it.</p>

  <p>But when a laboratory experiment had reached a phase where its success or
  failure was at stake, with a canny guess to be refuted or verified, they
  became intensely aware of each other and alive to the sole bond that united
  them. On such occasions they rubbed elbows companionably as they peered at
  test-tubes held up to the light, and touched heads as they studied baffling
  X-ray plates, growing gleeful over their findings and momentarily sharing
  their delight; or, if they had been foiled and deluded, raspingly muttering
  their damns in concert. At these times, they were in complete accord. Their
  normal relation of austere preceptor and taciturn disciple gave way to such a
  harmony of mind and mood that anyone observing them&mdash;sitting side by
  side, ear to ear, on their tall stools, breathlessly watching the reaction of
  a solution into which three drops of some potent acid had been
  introduced&mdash;might have thought them father and son.</p>

  <p>One day&mdash;it was near the close of Beaven's second year as Tubby's
  assistant&mdash;an incident occurred which, while trifling enough in itself,
  indicated their mutual attitude perfectly. Jack had just succeeded, after
  much painstaking work, in accomplishing a very delicate adjustment in a
  temperamental microscope. Tubby, absent-mindedly occupied with his own
  business and unaware of what was afoot at his assistant's table, stamped
  heavily across the room, on his way out, and was suddenly stopped in his
  tracks by Jack's sharp command, <i>"Easy, there! And don't you slam that
  door!"</i></p>

  <p>The impudent order had popped out involuntarily. With the echo of the
  words in his ears, Jack's heart missed a beat. He realized that he had done a
  pretty dreadful thing, and glanced up expecting to face a justifiable
  indignation. Tubby was proceeding the rest of the way on tiptoe. He closed
  the door very softly behind him. Jack tightened his fingers into an
  astonished fist, caught his lip between his teeth, drew a quick smile that
  registered an immense satisfaction, and made a decisive gesture of approval
  in the direction of the door, "<i>Atta</i>boy!" he exclaimed. It was fine! It
  was of the stuff that they put into grand opera!</p>

  <p>Tubby was a brute. He hated him. In any other but their present
  relationship, he would have wanted to get even with him somehow for his
  continued meanness. But in the laboratory, when important things were in
  process, he and Tubby were not related as a pompous professor and an immature
  associate. They stood on an equal footing here, humbly serving the same
  master. Every personal consideration&mdash;their mutual dislike, their
  temperamental incompatibility, their vast difference in rank, age,
  experience&mdash;everything in which they differed, and everything they
  despised in each other was ignored when their common master made a demand!
  Everything else had to move on to the siding&mdash;and let Science have the
  right-of-way. It was quite a stirring thought.</p>

  <p>Jack often wished he knew the nature of Tubby's feelings about this. As
  for himself, he occasionally pondered it, sometimes with a studious frown,
  sometimes with a broad grin, but always with a sensation of pride. The
  relation between himself and Tubby Forrester might be deucedly irritating to
  both of them, but this much could be said for it: Their personal animosity
  dignified their job. The job was bigger than they were, and they both knew
  it.</p>

  <p>Always he had been strangely stirred by Kipling's declaration, "The ship
  is more than the crew". That sort of gallantry gave him a sense of
  exaltation. Human progress could proceed at a startling pace, he felt, if
  every intelligent man regarded his task with such devotion. Doubtless the
  sluggish movement of civilization could be explained by the half-hearted
  efforts of men whose attention was distracted by all manner of outside
  interests. They didn't keep their eye on the ball. They spent an inordinate
  amount of time and thought on their own affairs; associates watching one
  another anxiously to make sure the other fellow wasn't paid a larger salary,
  didn't own a bigger car, hadn't taken a longer vacation. The trouble was,
  obviously, that they weren't committed to their job. That was what ailed
  civilization: too much jealousy and selfishness interfering with the minds of
  the people who ordered the world's work. They didn't care a damn for the
  ship, so long as they got what they thought was coming to them&mdash;in rank,
  wages, shore leaves, pensions.</p>

  <p>All the way down the line of human action, the machinery of progress was
  screechingly hot with the friction of personalities yelping for preferments.
  What society needed most was the equivalent of the Hippocratic oath, honestly
  sworn and subscribed to and faithfully kept by men who held the world's
  welfare in their hands. When the whole legal profession acknowledged that
  Justice was its God; when attorneys and judges cast aside all their personal
  desires, their tedious bickerings, their envies, and bowed themselves before
  the calm, majestic face of Justice, the public would respect the law and
  obediently walk in its ways. When teachers left off thinking about their jobs
  in terms of monthly cheques and promotions, swearing fealty to the cause of
  Education, their disciples would be ashamed not to follow them. When the
  people's elected representatives in legislative halls and executive offices
  abandoned their duplicities, their connivances, their unabashed knaveries,
  their lust for applause, front-page publicity, and indiscriminate loot; when
  these so-called statesmen were willing to serve Patriotism with something
  like the selfless devotion of the men who served Science; well&mdash;the
  world would presently come out into the sunshine of a new day! What
  Civilization needed was a crew that understood the nature of its obligation
  to the ship!</p>

  <p>His relation to Tubby Forrester, Beaven felt, was conducive to the highest
  type of service to their important task. They gave no heed to each other as
  persons. They wasted no time in small talk. Nothing else in the world
  mattered, when they were together, but their scientific research.</p>

  <p>Sometimes he allowed his imagination to play with the fancied scene of a
  captain and a navigating officer, standing shoulder to shoulder on the
  bridge, in a dangerous storm, venomously despising each other but
  acknowledging that the ship was their mistress. Perhaps&mdash;when and if the
  ship made port&mdash;they would sneak off to some quite spot and fight out
  their pent-up animosity. But that event could wait. Just now, they were
  serving a mistress whose claims on them were such as no other mistress could
  undercut or understand. She was their God, and She was a jealous God, and so
  far as they were concerned <i>there were no other gods before Her.</i></p>

  <p>That's the way it was with him and Tubby. Science was their God. Whatever
  might be their hostility toward each other as persons, they put it all aside
  when their God spoke. What mattered their insignificant little tiffs, or
  their puerile aversions, or even their silly little <i>selves</i> when in the
  presence of their Lord! It was, thought Jack, a form of worship that really
  amounted to something. It rebounded into their work&mdash;work for the
  emancipation of society from its pains and discomforts; work that would set
  men free of their physical disabilities. He and Tubby were religious. The
  laboratory was their chapel, the Bunsen burner was their censer of incense,
  the perpetual light was to be seen in the Crooks tube, the stained glass was
  not in the windows but in the depths of a high-powered microscope. The
  analogy moved him to the depths. He pressed it for further revelations, even
  to the length of saying to himself that the poor, mangled cadavers had been
  given&mdash;in the laboratory&mdash;the right to a triumphant resurrection;
  not some fantastic emergence from the grave on a "last day", but a glorious
  opportunity to serve the world, now and here. He would have given a great
  deal for a chance to say all this to Tubby, and watch his face.</p>

  <p>Not infrequently, memories of his childhood would sweep over him. The
  family's social life had been so inextricably tangled with the doings in
  their little church that it was almost impossible to review his youth without
  bumping into something religious. As he looked back upon those experiences
  now, from his present position as a servant of Science, the whole sorry
  business offended him. In the light of recent events, he recalled the
  contentious sects whose discordant quarrels kept the neighbourhood at
  loggerheads. How glibly they all talked about their God! But they didn't talk
  the same language. The high quest that should have bound them all
  together&mdash;as he and Tubby were bound together&mdash;was the one and only
  thing that kept them apart.</p>

  <p>If their God had really possessed them&mdash;as Science possessed himself
  and Tubby&mdash;they might have had rows about everything else, but not about
  <i>Him.</i> Had they been sportsmanly enough to agree upon a truce, in the
  presence of their God, like the officers on a ship or scientists in a
  laboratory, they might have got something that would have made them a great
  deal finer and more useful than they were.</p>

  <p>But their conception of God wasn't big enough. He couldn't command their
  attention. He was such a frail little fellow that they had the audacity to
  fight before His very face! He was so impotent that in His presence they were
  able to remember and exploit all of their futile controversies. If He had
  meant anything to them, they couldn't have done it! They sneered at each
  other's efforts to evaluate Him. There wasn't a single unifying influence at
  work throughout the whole community&mdash;not even their God! Least of
  all&mdash;their God. That was what made them poor, cloddish, selfish, stupid.
  There was nothing to stir their courage or stimulate their minds. That was
  what ailed them: they had no <i>God.</i> The poor old home-made scarecrow
  that they had set up, and called God, had never done anything for them but
  split up the country-side into warring factions.</p>

  <p>He remembered how, as a lad, he had earnestly wished that he could feel
  the ecstasy, the tug, the thrill of a Spirit that would inspire him to
  reverence, awe, and devotion. It was impossible.</p>

  <p>Now, belatedly, he had achieved that sense of being mastered by a powerful
  influence worthy of his best efforts. Science was his Master! Maybe Science
  was just another name for The True God. Certain quaint and cryptic bits of
  Scripture, read by his father at morning prayers, clung tenaciously to his
  memory. One sentence in particular, that had widened his boyish eyes,
  recurred to him. "I am inquired of by them that asked not for <i>Me</i>."
  Perhaps there was some truth in this. Perhaps a diligent inquiry into the
  mysteries of Science was indeed a quest for God. At all events, when Science
  was your God, you knew exactly what to expect of Him. Science wasn't full of
  whims and pusillanimous little prejudices and partialities. Science had no
  pet children; no chosen people. You could kowtow and genuflect and sing and
  pray all you liked to this God, and try to make yourself believe that you and
  yours had a special stand-in, but if you combined certain potent chemicals in
  the wrong relationships, He would blow the pants right off of you, as
  promptly and cheerfully as He would pay off the most flippant atheist for the
  same mistake.</p>

  <p>Some day there might be an occasion to discuss all this with Tubby. He
  suspected that Tubby&mdash;down deep inside&mdash;was potentially religious.
  His constant jibes at the common prattle of the sects certainly indicated
  that the subject was much on his mind.</p>

  <p>Jack had but little time for recreation, and no social life at all. He did
  not fret about it. His programme had no place in it for women, and social
  events inevitably threw one into contact with them. He was strongly aware of
  their attraction. They disturbed and distracted him. He could easily
  understand the predicament of his fellow-interns who made short shrift of
  their work and committed inexcusable blunders when under the spell of some
  new infatuation. The way to insure against any such mental collapse was to
  avoid women; refuse to think about them. For many weeks after graduation he
  had been pestered by memories of the charming girl he had seen at the
  Livingstone; but he had resolutely disposed of her&mdash;the only girl he had
  ever really longed to know.</p>

  <p>Most of the other interns groused about the long hours required of them
  and made their own tasks almost unendurable. Their complaints occasionally
  rose to shrill crescendos of rage when peremptorily ordered to do some
  relatively unimportant thing at nine-fifteen&mdash;thus destroying a promised
  evening off duty&mdash;something that might as well be done at eight or one.
  For some of them it was so hard a life that they candidly discussed throwing
  it all up&mdash;and to hell with it!</p>

  <p>Jack would make a mockery of their discomforts, ironically soothing them
  with such philosophical titbits as "There, there! This too shall pass". And
  they would mutter, "Old sphynx! Old mole! Old owl!" And indeed he did seem
  much older than the lot of them. Sometimes he made fun of their rages and
  sometimes showed his utter disgust, declaring they were a herd of asses,
  unconsciously giving the word an intonation, accent, and value so amazingly
  like Tubby's own use of it that it startled him.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It had been tentatively planned that Beaven's internship and appointment
  as Dr Forrester's laboratory assistant should carry on through four years. At
  the end of his third year, however, this programme was revised. Tubby had
  been invited to spend the first term in Edinburgh as an exchange lecturer in
  Neurological Surgery.</p>

  <p>This invitation from the celebrated medical college in Scotland had been
  extended three years previously and annually renewed, but Tubby had not felt
  until now that he could safely leave his job.</p>

  <p>One afternoon in early May, he came into the laboratory where Jack was
  staining a tissue for microscopic examination, and said brusquely,
  "Beaven&mdash;you don't imagine that you know enough about Anatomy to teach
  it, do you?"</p>

  <p>"To whom?" drawled Jack, without looking up.</p>

  <p>Tubby laid his hat and stick on the table, mounted a tall stool, scowled,
  and demanded attention.</p>

  <p>Jack put down his work and listened.</p>

  <p>"I am spending the first term in Edinburgh. I have been farming out my
  duties here. How much of a mess do you suppose you'd make of the first-year
  class in Anatomy?"</p>

  <p>"You ought to know, sir. All the Anatomy I have, I got from you."</p>

  <p>Tubby's lips twitched in a brief smile.</p>

  <p>"Your damned impertinence, too, I suppose," growled Tubby.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; but I wouldn't have the nerve to try to teach that in your
  absence&mdash;if that's what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Beaven&mdash;I don't know why I tolerate you. You're as impudent as the
  devil."</p>

  <p>"Oh no, sir! But&mdash;thanks for the concession&mdash;just the same."</p>

  <p>"That's settled, then," said Tubby. "First-year Anatomy. Better bone up on
  it. And keep it in mind that these young cubs have to be handled patiently,
  at first."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;I remember how you do it."</p>

  <p>"You're a bit inclined to be sarcastic, you know."</p>

  <p>Jack grinned.</p>

  <p>"I am told that the younger house-pups find you a pretty hard taskmaster,"
  continued Tubby.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;they're going in for a serious business," said Jack,
  defensively, "and they may as well find it out now."</p>

  <p>"But don't imagine that because you yourself live like a monk and work
  like a slave&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've been acting on your own advice and example, sir," interposed Jack.
  "Besides&mdash;I like it."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! Nobody likes such severe self-discipline."</p>

  <p>"How about <i>you?</i>" demanded Jack.</p>

  <p>Tubby dismissed this query with an impatient shrug.</p>

  <p>"What I am trying to get through your tonsure, Father Beaven, is my wish
  to leave here with the belief that when I return I may find the first-class
  year still attending the Medical School. Don't discourage these cubs. And
  don't make them hate you. You easily could, you know."</p>

  <p>The interview gave Jack many reflective moments. Was he getting hard? Was
  he cutting himself off from everything and everybody? He must have come a
  long way on the road to isolation if even Tubby was moved to warn him.</p>

  <p>Reviewing his relationship to the interns, the nurses, and the patients,
  he was bound to admit that he had no personal interest in these people beyond
  the business that had put them all under the same roof. He comforted himself
  with the knowledge that he was courteous in his dealings with them. But it
  was apparent that in most respects, he and Tubby Forrester&mdash;for all
  their mutual animosity&mdash;were as nearly alike as peas in a pod.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Young Dr Beaven kept the yearlings on the jump. Tubby, returning in
  February, was so occupied with experiments relating to his own speciality,
  that he had no inclination to resume class-work. Occasionally he would
  saunter about through the anatomical laboratory, pausing to ask tricky
  questions, picking up drawings and tossing them down; but, apparently
  confident that his assistant was doing a good job, he gave himself no further
  concern about it, and privately promised himself that he was done teaching
  the elements of Anatomy.</p>

  <p>The past eight years of steady contact with medical interests had brought
  Jack Beaven into a maturity that gave him the appearance of being older than
  thirty. There had been no fundamental changes in him, but all of his
  identifying traits had been seasoned and accented. Never disposed to be
  garrulous, his conversation had become laconic. His physical exercise,
  restricted now to an hour's vigorous workout at the punching-bag in the
  gymnasium, every day from five to six, was admittedly a health measure rather
  than a pleasurable recreation. Occasionally he took a long walk into the
  country, alone. During this past year, because of his classroom and
  laboratory duties, he had been relieved of the routine activities of
  internship, but he still lived in the Hospital Annex as before.</p>

  <p>In physical appearance he had developed into a rather striking figure. The
  blondish hair, which still had a strong tendency to be curly, was close
  cropped. His features, naturally rugged, gave him distinction as they
  matured. The deep-set blue eyes had a penetrating quality, possibly to be
  accounted for by the inquisitive, analytical mind behind them, and their
  diligent application to microscopy. His work had made him serious. He almost
  never laughed aloud at anything. Indeed, his cloistral life did not bring him
  into frequent contact with amusing episodes. His smile&mdash;when it
  showed&mdash;was unexpectedly boyish, but brief.</p>

  <p>Hospital patients, after a few unrewarded attempts to be jocularly
  informal, gave it up. It was clear that he hadn't come to play with them.
  They saw that there was a chasm between themselves and young Dr Beaven too
  wide and deep to be crossed. This had the effect of increasing their
  confidence in his skill, especially when they noted the assurance and
  decisiveness of every movement he made in their presence. He wasn't much of a
  joker, but he knew his stuff.</p>

  <p>Nobody had to be told that Dr Beaven was absolutely obsessed by his work.
  His impassive face testified that if he had any emotions at all they were
  under perfect control. He wasted no time in soft compliments, but when he
  commended anyone for excellent behaviour under heavy stress his crisp words
  of approval were cherished.</p>

  <p>There was very little difference in his attitude toward men and women
  patients. By implication, rather than direct statement, he gave women to
  understand that they were expected to have brains and bravery. They liked his
  cool confidence in their toughness and were bewildered by his cooler
  indifference to their coquetries. Many droll stories drifted about through
  the hospital, reporting brusque remarks made by Dr Beaven to patients putting
  up a gallant fight. One yarn, told by a nurse, had it that he had come into a
  room at two a.m. to see how a young woman was getting on who had been put
  through an operation, late in the afternoon, to repair a broken jaw and deep
  throat lacerations received in an automobile collision. The conversation was
  reported to have run as follows:</p>

  <p>Doctor: "Hello" (gruffly). "Does it hurt badly?"</p>

  <p>Patient: "No, sir."</p>

  <p>Doctor: "I know better. You're lying."</p>

  <p>Patient: "Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>Doctor: "But you have the proper spirit."</p>

  <p>Patient (mistily): "Thanks."</p>

  <p>Doctor (whimsically): "Lies of great men all remind us, we can make our
  lies sublime."</p>

  <p>Patient: "Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."</p>

  <p>Dr Beaven hadn't said anything further, not even "Good night". After the
  door had closed behind him, the patient, swathed in bandages, had mumbled,
  "He's wonderful".</p>

  <p>"How do you mean&mdash;wonderful?" snapped the nurse, testily. "Don't go
  losing your heart to this good-looking thing just because he was sweet enough
  to call you a liar when you said it didn't hurt; for that's as sweet as he's
  ever going to be&mdash;on you&mdash;or anybody else. That bird's arteries are
  filled with ice-cold lemon juice."</p>

  <p>But the whole hospital had a growing respect for Beaven&mdash;a sentiment
  compounded of fear and admiration&mdash;and predictions were freely made that
  he would be a very important person, some day.</p>

  <p>"Exactly like Tubby," was usually added.</p>

  <p>"Except that Beaven doesn't have tantrums."</p>

  <p>"No; he doesn't shout and swear&mdash;but&mdash;boy!&mdash;he's hard!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>One morning in mid-June, Dr Forrester summoned Beaven to his office. They
  faced each other, as usual, coolly and without salutations. Tubby pointed to
  the chair opposite and redirected his attention to the voluminous case-report
  he had been reading. Jack ignored the invitation and waited, absently toying
  with his dangling stethoscope.</p>

  <p>"We are getting a case from up-state to-morrow that promises to be
  interesting." Tubby leaned forward, smoothed out the document on his desk,
  and tapped it significantly with the inevitable pince-nez. "It is referred to
  us by Dr William Cunningham. Ever hear of him?"</p>

  <p>Jack nodded noncommittally. For an instant he was tempted to comment, but
  decided to withhold his own opinion. One heard a good deal about Cunningham,
  these days. The medics discussed him freely. He had a sound reputation as a
  surgeon; was highly respected as a diagnostician; was reputed to be the most
  able surgical consultant in the whole Saginaw Bay region. On the other hand,
  he was considered a self-confessed sentimentalist; one of these altruistic
  chaps who stewed and fretted over the non-pathological problems of his
  patients; a typical example of what Tubby scornfully called "the good ole
  country doc".</p>

  <p>It would be interesting indeed to hear Tubby&mdash;who had never once
  referred to Cunningham in Jack's presence&mdash;offer his own appraisal of
  his soft-hearted classmate, who believed that the greatest thing in the world
  is the love of humanity&mdash;surely a sappy thing for a scientific man to
  say.</p>

  <p>"This is in the nature of a repair job," continued Tubby, momentarily
  dashing Jack's hope for an intimate revelation. "Some unsuccessful surgery
  was done on this case before Cunningham saw it. Cunningham could
  unquestionably attend to it himself, but he apparently has a good reason for
  wanting to refer the case to a better guesser than he is." The chief paused
  to glare a challenge at his protégé. "I daresay you think <i>you're</i> a
  pretty smart guesser by this time; eh? Well&mdash;we'll see." Something had
  happened to make Tubby very scratchy, this morning. Willing to accommodate
  his boss with the proffer of a little controversial fuel, Jack countered
  with, "Depends on what the guess is about, sir. I'm willing to guess that
  thirty-six inches make a yard, though I've never verified it, and have it
  only on the flimsiest hearsay."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" grunted Tubby. "Very silly remark!... Sit down; damn it! You
  make me nervous!"</p>

  <p>Jack sat, on the arm of the chair, and lighted a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"The patient," continued Tubby, reconcentrating on his papers, "is a
  seven-year-old boy. Six months ago, he fell from a step-ladder, his left arm
  striking a picket of an iron fence&mdash;the awkward little rascal&mdash;and
  one of the spikes penetrated the medial aspect of the arm near the junction
  of its middle and upper thirds. A bruise and a slight hæmorrhage but no
  impairment of function. Simple bandage. Next day there was a pain in the hand
  but none in the arm.... Got that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied Jack, through a lazy streamer of smoke. "Median
  nerve."</p>

  <p>"Of course!" Tubby's tone indicated that any ass should have known the
  trouble was in the median nerve. "So&mdash;after two weeks the pain became
  more acute; now localized to the medial half of the hand; second and third
  fingers stiff; nails brittle and glossy; skin dry. The boy found that the
  pain could be somewhat alleviated if the hand was kept moist; or, better,
  immersed in a basin of water." Tubby paused to query&mdash;over the top of
  his glasses&mdash;whether these facts meant anything to his junior.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" grumped Jack, in a tone so amazingly like Tubby's that the
  chief blinked a little.</p>

  <p>"An operation was performed&mdash;by some doctor I never heard
  of&mdash;fellow named Munson&mdash;up there some place. It appears to have
  been a fairly intelligent job, but without results." Tubby glanced up.
  "Perhaps you can guess what this chap tried to do."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;if this is an examination," replied Jack, slightly ruffled, "I
  suppose the man performed a peri-arterial sympathectomy."</p>

  <p>"Exactly! But there was no relief. The hand now became so sensitive that a
  loud noise or the jar of traffic in the street was almost unendurable. We
  have scar tissue to deal with, and Cunningham says there is a distressing
  pulsation."</p>

  <p>"Nerve probably adhering to the brachial artery," ventured Jack.</p>

  <p>"Sounds like it.... Well&mdash;that's all. You know as much about the
  case as I do. And my only reason for calling you in on it"&mdash;Tubby rose,
  and pushed back his chair&mdash;"is because I have had my lenses changed and
  am not quite accommodated to the correction. This nerve-suture will be a
  tricky job. I may ask you to do it. Take all this stuff along with you;
  Cunningham's covering letter&mdash;and all. Parts of the letter are personal.
  I haven't time to edit it and get a deleted copy for you. You will note that
  Cunningham's observations include a rambling account of the patient's family,
  a whole paper-basketful of irrelevant comments having no bearing whatsoever
  on the case. That"&mdash;Tubby's voice grew testy&mdash;"that's Dr William
  Cunningham's besetting sin. Father Beaven. He's a good surgeon. He's a good
  diagnostician. He might have been a great man; had it in him; might have been
  a member of this faculty!"</p>

  <p>It was plain to see that the letter from Cunningham had stirred the
  smouldering ashes of an old friendship that had met disaster.</p>

  <p>"So, you are not to leap to the conclusion"&mdash;Tubby handed the papers
  across the desk&mdash;"that Cunningham is just an old blaters-skite because
  he gossips like an afternoon tea at the Mother's Club. He has a sentimental
  interest in this family; wants 'em shown special attentions."</p>

  <p>"Not a ward case, I take it."</p>

  <p>"By no means! They are quite independent. The child's mother is bringing
  him down. I have made a reservation for her at the Livingstone. Her sister
  will come later. Cunningham will be here for a day, if he can get away."</p>

  <p>Jack folded the bulky document, pocketed it, and walked toward the
  door.</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;Beaven&mdash;" called Tubby.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"I expect to be away for a few days, immediately after Commencement. You
  will have full charge of this case during convalescence. Bare possibility, of
  course, that the operation may not be successful. Might have it to do over
  again. If so&mdash;it's your job.... That's all."</p>

  <p>Proceeding to Tubby's laboratory, Jack re-read the case-history with care.
  Cunningham might be a garrulous old lady, but there wasn't anything loose or
  unprofessional about the case-history. Then he took up the personal letter,
  perusing it with expanding interest. Two or three facts about the
  Cunningham-Forrester relationship were plain as a pikestaff. These men had
  once been intimate. Something had tugged them apart. Perhaps Tubby had been
  annoyed over Cunningham's unprofessional attitude toward his job. Maybe
  Cunningham's success had taken a tuck in Tubby's pet theory. Or, Cunningham
  was mildly annoyed over Tubby's cold-bloodedness. At all events&mdash;they
  hadn't been very close; not for a long time. Not unfriendly, but not chummy;
  not any more. Jack marvelled that Tubby had let him see this letter. It was
  an immensely interesting document; nice little riddle in psychology.</p>

  <p>Waiving that problem, Jack ran his eye over the detailed information about
  the patient and his kin. The boy, Theodore King, was exceptionally bright for
  a seven-year-old. Precocious, and a bit spoiled. His mother, Mrs Claudia
  King, was the widow of a man who had been conspicuous in the lumber industry.
  Before their marriage she had been private secretary to the president of the
  company, a position she had resumed after her husband's death.</p>

  <p>Her father&mdash;as if that mattered a damn in the relief of young
  Theodore's nerve-adhesion&mdash;had been a sea-captain, Henry Hilton by name,
  running from San Francisco to Hong Kong for many years; shrewd, thrifty,
  picturesque old chap, who had stacked up a considerable fortune and left his
  daughters well fixed.</p>

  <p>"Claudia King is not required to work for her living," clattered
  Cunningham, "but for her health. You will observe that she is disposed to
  overplay her gem-like brilliance. All of her thinking is done in italics. She
  burns more carbon while asleep than most people do at full gallop. She will
  probably reorganize your hospital while she is with you (and do a mighty good
  job of it, too). Claudia is uncommonly easy to look at, and uncommonly hard
  to talk to; a renowned monologuist. If you feel it imperative to tell her
  something, grasp her firmly by the scruff of the neck with your left hand and
  put your right hand over her mouth&mdash;and watch out for your fingers. Her
  sister, whom you will see a little later, resembles her in that they are both
  white, female, and adult. Otherwise they have nothing in common. The sister
  was a story that deserves more space than even this lengthy letter
  permits."</p>

  <p>Jack folded the letter and thrust it into the pocket of his white duck
  jacket, sat for a long time staring out at the window. He wished he knew the
  probably dramatic tale of the battered friendship between the eccentric
  Saginaw Bay surgeon and surly old Tubby.</p>

  <p>An unwelcome thought suddenly smote him. Could it be possible that Tubby
  was asking him to have charge of the King case for the purpose of showing up
  Cunningham as a person of small importance professionally? Cunningham is
  baffled by a surgical problem and sends it down to Tubby for expert handling.
  Tubby sniffs, and turns the case over to his assistant. Would old Tubby be
  that mean? Jack's eyes narrowed thoughtfully and he shook his head.
  No&mdash;not even Tubby would do that! Tubby's explanation was honest, no
  doubt. He was having his glasses changed. That was all.</p>

  <p>Descending the stairs, his mind so preoccupied that he made no response to
  the respectful greetings of students on the way up, Jack entered the library,
  went back to the alcove containing works on the autonomic nervous system, and
  settled down to a review of unique case-histories of nerve-adhesions
  involving the brachial artery. Cunningham's human-interest comments on the
  case had been utterly forgotten. The fact that the little boy was said to be
  bright and his young mother brilliant hadn't registered at all. The youngster
  might be a half-wit and his mother a shrimp and his enigmatical aunt a
  monster, for all he cared. The case, so far as Jack was concerned, was a
  problem in neurological surgery.</p>

  <p>After an hour he returned to the anatomical laboratory and strolled among
  the tables until he found a pair of young medics dissecting an arm in the
  general field of his present concern.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me a moment, won't you?" he said, stepping between them. "I want
  to look at something."</p>

  <p>They deferentially made way, pleased to feel that the capable and handsome
  young Dr Beaven had thus honoured their cadaver. One of them, hopeful of
  making the most of this unexpected contact with his Anatomy teacher,
  audaciously ventured a bit of grim drollery.</p>

  <p>"This gentleman came to us from one of the state hospitals for the insane,
  Dr Beaven. Pete and I call him 'Mr Hatter'."</p>

  <p>Beaven, thoroughly occupied with his problem, knitted his brows and
  regarded the flushing young medic with a mystified stare.</p>

  <p>"What did you say?" he inquired, remotely.</p>

  <p>"It was of no consequence, sir," explained the unhappy humorist. "I said
  we called this subject 'Mr Hatter'&mdash;because he was a nut, you know."</p>

  <p>"Oh," drawled Beaven, absently, adding&mdash;after a long moment's
  intensive search with a probe&mdash;"I should think you might find him
  congenial."</p>

  <p>The other student unsuccessfully stifled a chuckle, and Beaven glanced
  over his shoulder to survey him briefly.</p>

  <p>"Very happy relationship all round," observed the young anatomist.
  "Thanks, gentlemen." He turned away, conciliating them with the merest
  suggestion of a twinkle at the corners of his steel-blue eyes.</p>

  <p>Mr Hatter's attendants, rosily sensitive to the cool ridicule they had
  experienced, fell to work industriously, hoping the neighbouring tables had
  missed the dialogue. After a while the more facetious one muttered, out of
  the corner of his mouth, "God, I'd hate to have him mad at me."</p>

  <p>"Playful little feller; eh, wot?" said Pete.</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;like Tubby."</p>

  <p>"Well," soberly, "if I knew as much as Beaven knows about old man
  Hatter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't know anything else."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't need to."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT had been a long time since Jack Beaven had taken any
  personal interest in a child. From the day he had left home to enter college,
  a dozen years ago, there had been very few occasions for meeting young
  children.</p>

  <p>As an intern, his contacts with them had been infrequent. Most of the
  surgery he saw was performed on adults. And as Tubby Forrester directed his
  student assistant's attention more and more toward neurological surgery, the
  opportunities for seeing children became correspondingly farther apart. It
  was a rare thing for a child to show up in this department.</p>

  <p>Perhaps if he had nourished the hope that some day he might have a home
  and a family of his own, he would have made more effort to acquaint himself
  with the mental processes of early adolescence. As the matter stood, he was
  as unfamiliar with the normal behaviour of a seven-year-old boy as with the
  habits of a penguin.</p>

  <p>Of course this lack of knowledge related only to Jack's information
  concerning the child's mind. A seven-year-old boy, considered physically, was
  a man drawn to a smaller scale. You didn't have to explore to find his
  brachial artery or his median nerve. But his mind, far from being a
  diminutive model of a man's mind, was an entirely different institution.</p>

  <p>Early next morning after the operation, Jack went up to see how his young
  patient was getting on. He felt confident that the nerve repair would prove
  successful. The tricky part of it&mdash;dissecting the nerve out of the scar
  tissue, and freeing it from the artery to which it had adhered, and suturing
  the nerve ends, after the neuromatous portion had been excised&mdash;had been
  his personal responsibility. Tubby had merely opened the field of operation.
  Jack had done the rest of it. And it was a good job. Dr Cunningham had not
  been able to come, somewhat to Jack's disappointment. His curiosity about
  Cunningham had been stirred.</p>

  <p>He had seen very little of the boy on the afternoon of his arrival.
  Nervously distressed by the fatigue, excitement, and jarring of the trip, the
  patient had been given a sedative strong enough to induce lethargy. Tubby
  felt that they knew enough about the history of the case. The important thing
  now was to let the boy rest. Jack had not seen Mrs King. Assured that her
  child was in good hands, she had been driven to the hotel by Tubby himself,
  who rarely went out of his way to accommodate the kin of his out-of-town
  patients. Jack was secretly amused when the nurse told him, and reflected
  that Dr Cunningham's comment on the lady's attractiveness must have had some
  element of truth in it.</p>

  <p>Nor had he seen Mrs King yesterday at the time of the operation.
  Undoubtedly she had followed when the lad had been taken from his room, but
  they had stowed her away safely before the anæsthetizing had begun. After the
  operation, Tubby had gone directly to the room, but Jack had not followed.
  After all, it was Tubby's case. At seven, Jack had peeped in, and the nurse
  said the boy was asleep; everything the way it ought to be; and Mrs King had
  been advised to return to the hotel since there was nothing she could do at
  the hospital. Dr Forrester, added the nurse, had come for her.</p>

  <p>About six-thirty next morning the assistant in Neurology proceeded to the
  King room and quietly pushed the door open. The boy was awake. He seemed very
  small. The short fringe of damp, curling, black hair on the white forehead
  was soft and babyish. The eyes, extraordinarily long-lashed, were set wide
  apart in an oval face with a dimple in the chin.</p>

  <p>Young Dr Beaven went to the bedside, looked down into the questioning
  brown eyes, and said, "How do you do, Mr King?"</p>

  <p>The child folded his lower lip between his teeth and struggled with a
  grin.</p>

  <p>"How do you do?" he replied, remotely.</p>

  <p>The Warren girl, who had been on duty since eleven, was caught with a
  sudden chuckle in the very middle of an open-faced yawn, and retired to the
  window, where she regarded the maple trees with much interest.</p>

  <p>"Does your hand hurt?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;but my arm does."</p>

  <p>"That's good," commented Dr Beaven. "I mean&mdash;about your hand. We
  don't care anything about the arm."</p>

  <p>"Oh?" said the child, wide-eyed, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Did you sleep well last night?" asked the doctor, taking the boy's good
  wrist in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I think so. Did you?"</p>

  <p>"Just fairly well, sir," replied the doctor, soberly. He drew out his
  watch and regarded it with full attention.</p>

  <p>"What was the matter? Did you drink coffee? My mother&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shh," said Miss Warren, with a high smile and uplifted finger.</p>

  <p>Presently Dr Beaven repocketed his watch and said, as one man to another,
  "No, sir; it wasn't coffee. I am a doctor, Mr King, and doctors almost never
  sleep all night. Last night, I was up several times. Sick people, you know.
  This is a hospital." He gently drew down the sheet. "I should like to listen
  to your heart, please."</p>

  <p>"Will it make a loud noise&mdash;in that thing?"</p>

  <p>"I hope not."</p>

  <p>"Will you let me listen to yours when you're through listening to
  mine?"</p>

  <p>"Not to-day. The nurse wants you to be very quiet to-day."</p>

  <p>"Don't you?"</p>

  <p>Dr Beaven, feeling that his suggestion about silence might be obeyed, had
  put the tips of his instrument in his ears, but now took them out again, and
  said, "Don't I what?" to which the patient promptly replied, "Don't you want
  me to be quiet?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes; of course. Everybody wants you to be quiet; Miss Warren, and Dr
  Forrester, and I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And my mother, too, I expect," added the boy, helpfully.</p>

  <p>"Unquestionably. Now if you'll kindly not talk for just a minute&mdash;"
  He laid the bell of the instrument on the child's heart.</p>

  <p>"Was it still beating?" asked the boy, eagerly, when the doctor had
  stuffed the stethoscope back into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Faintly. It will be stronger, I think, after you have spent an hour or
  two without talking."</p>

  <p>"I didn't see you yesterday."</p>

  <p>"No. I saw you&mdash;but you were asleep."</p>

  <p>"Dr Beaven operated on you, dear," put in Miss Warren. "We must be very
  quiet now."</p>

  <p>The brown eyes shifted to inspect her gravely.</p>

  <p>"You, too?"</p>

  <p>Miss Warren couldn't think of a prompt answer to that, and merely laid her
  finger-tips on her pursed mouth and opened her eyes wide.</p>

  <p>"Did you see my mother?" asked the boy, returning to the doctor, who shook
  his head.</p>

  <p>"Does that mean 'No?'&mdash;or 'Shut up'?"</p>

  <p>"Both," said Dr Beaven quietly.</p>

  <p>There was a moment of reflection. The boy sighed.</p>

  <p>"My mother says it isn't polite to say 'Shut up'."</p>

  <p>"That's true, Mr King. But doctors aren't engaged to be polite.
  However&mdash;may I beg your pardon?"</p>

  <p>The child nodded enthusiastically. Dr Beaven moved away toward the
  door.</p>

  <p>"I shall be seeing you again," he said.</p>

  <p>"But you said you would beg my pardon."</p>

  <p>"Didn't I?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;you just asked me if you could."</p>

  <p>"You certainly keep your eye on the ball, don't you?"</p>

  <p>The boy's eyes danced.</p>

  <p>"Do you like to play ball? I'll bet you could play football if you wanted
  to. Did you ever?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you to-morrow&mdash;provided I get a report that you have been
  very quiet all day."</p>

  <p>"What did you do to my hand to make it stop hurting?"</p>

  <p>"I shall tell you that, too, to-morrow, if you are obedient to-day."</p>

  <p>The child shook his head obstinately.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't hurt me to lie still and listen, while you talked."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow!" said Dr Beaven, firmly.</p>

  <p>Teddy's face registered disappointment. It was easily to be seen that he
  was accustomed to having his own way.</p>

  <p>At the door, the doctor turned and said, significantly, "All the patients
  on this floor are men. You are one of them, Mr King." He gravely gave the
  little fellow a military salute. Teddy's lips reluctantly broke into a smile
  as the salute was returned. Miss Warren viewed the pantomime with
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Did you like Dr Beaven?" she asked, after the door had closed.</p>

  <p>Teddy nodded with heavy dignity.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't ask me questions," he said, severely. "I'm not allowed to
  talk."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Late that afternoon, in a brief conference in his laboratory, Dr Forrester
  made it clear that he would not expect his assistant to give any of his time
  to the King boy for the next three days.</p>

  <p>"I am obliged to leave on Saturday, Beaven. After that, you will look
  after the case until the child is ready to go home."</p>

  <p>This wasn't a bit like Tubby. As soon as an interesting operation was
  performed, and its success assured, Tubby had no further concern about it. In
  this instance he had endeavoured&mdash;rather lamely, Jack thought&mdash;to
  explain his continued interest on the ground of his close friendship with Dr
  Cunningham, whose patient should receive personal attention.</p>

  <p>There was nothing about the boy's case that required expert oversight.
  Except for the natural procedure of healing and full recovery from the shock
  of the operation, little remained to be done that Time and Nature would not
  attend to.</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," replied Jack.</p>

  <p>"The boy's mother," continued Tubby, "expects to go home on Saturday. She
  has a responsible position and feels she should return to it. His aunt will
  arrive on Sunday, and remain here until he is ready to be discharged; a week
  longer, perhaps. You will decide that."</p>

  <p>It was somewhat annoying to Jack, finding himself conscious of a strong
  curiosity about a woman. He wanted to see this Mrs Claudia King, who had
  upset Tubby's equilibrium. He sincerely hoped that his eminent preceptor
  would not turn out to be a silly old ass. However, habit and training would
  eventually assert their claims, he knew. Tubby might be temporarily
  distracted, but he would snap out of it. Mrs King would go home, and Tubby
  would resume his customary programme. You couldn't make a Romeo of Tubby.</p>

  <p>Meantime, while the famed neurologist was enjoying a brief season of
  excitement, the claims of Science would be discharged by his faithful
  associate. Jack hoped he was not smug when he entertained this valorous
  thought. He hated smugness. Smugness had been the thing he had considered
  most objectionable in the religious fanatics with whom he had been associated
  in his youth.</p>

  <p>As he sat there in the laboratory, after Tubby's departure, it suddenly
  dawned on him that if a man didn't watch himself with care he could easily
  become as disgustingly pleased with his own moral grandeur while serving
  Science as he might when paying the tribute of stern self-discipline before
  the face of Jehovah or whatever other tribal deity had stirred his
  imagination.</p>

  <p>It was a disturbing thought. Here was the vast majority of the world's
  population obviously proceeding without any idealism, at all; not conscious
  of an obligation to render any kind of service or pay homage&mdash;other than
  a perfunctory gesture&mdash;to any sort of God. In striking contrast, here
  was another group, numerically negligible, spending a lifetime of rigorous
  devotion to the service of some Master; and, in the face of that great cost
  and at the sacrifice of almost everything which men have counted pleasurable,
  finding that their honest courage had developed a cancer of
  self-righteousness! No matter what kind of God you served, you were menaced
  by this unhealthy fungus. You went in for Art, and presently you were pleased
  to find that you had achieved a beauty of soul which set you apart. You went
  in for Religion; and, if you did it with all your might, it wouldn't be long
  before you would be mounting the temple steps, murmuring sweetly, "Lord, I
  thank Thee that I am not as other men are." If you hoped to avoid the
  inevitable temptations of the æsthete and the mystic, you would better go in
  for Science. No trashy sentiment about <i>that!</i> No climbing the martyr's
  stake to sing brave hallelujahs in the flames! No self-pitying,
  self-congratulatory preening of feathers!</p>

  <p>That's what he had come to think about his own life programme. Science was
  a Master you could follow without falling victim to these nasty little
  psychoses which softened the minds of sentimental daubers and
  prayer-hounds.</p>

  <p>To-day, Beaven stood shocked in the presence of the fact that it was
  possible to become just as putridly self-pleased over one's abnegations in
  the cause of Science. He despised himself for the littleness of the thought.
  He had caught himself saying to himself, "Very well. Let Tubby Forrester go
  and play. I'll carry on!" It was a pretty hard jolt. He went back to the
  hospital to pursue his rounds. And all day he kept saying to himself, "After
  all, I'm nothing but a well-trained chemist and carpenter. I know where all
  the parts are&mdash;and I know how to fix 'em&mdash;and so does the greasy
  fellow on his back under the motor-car. I work in a hospital and he works in
  a garage. I've been taking myself and my job too seriously. Need more fresh
  air and sunshine. And diverting society, too."</p>

  <p>But he made no effort to satisfy his curiosity about Mrs King. Nor did he
  call to see the child until late Saturday afternoon, when he was sure that
  both Tubby and the boy's mother had left town.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Jack was obliged to admit that he was pleasantly stirred by the child's
  welcome. There was no question about its genuineness.</p>

  <p>"Teddy has been inquiring for you, Dr Beaven," said Miss McFey. "He feared
  you had forgotten him."</p>

  <p>"I knew Dr Forrester was taking good care of you." Dr Beaven took the
  small hand. "And this is a big hospital, with a lot of sick people in it. I
  suppose you're almost well now. Sitting up&mdash;and everything."</p>

  <p>"My mother went home," said Teddy, soberly. "Did you see her?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I didn't meet your mother. I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"I told her about you."</p>

  <p>"So?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;she laughed."</p>

  <p>"At me?" The doctor raised his brows.</p>

  <p>"About your calling me 'Mr King'. My Aunt Audrey is coming to-morrow. She
  wouldn't think it was funny. Aunt Audrey is very polite. She will draw
  pictures for me. Can you draw pictures?"</p>

  <p>Somewhat to his own surprise, Jack nodded, drew out a pencil and a
  prescription pad, and quickly sketched an arm.</p>

  <p>"There. That is the place where you were hurt. This nerve was injured and
  grew fast to an artery. See? That. And this made your hand hurt, because it
  was the same nerve that wiggled these two fingers. So&mdash;we mended the
  nerve, and your hand didn't hurt any more. It doesn't; does it?"</p>

  <p>Teddy shook his head reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"Can you draw anything else&mdash;besides sore arms?"</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;faces of people, and cows, and horses, and things?"</p>

  <p>"Umm-humm&mdash;and pagodas and rickshaws and people planting rice."</p>

  <p>"No. Do I look like a Chinaman?"</p>

  <p>"You mustn't say 'Chinaman' in front of Aunt Audrey. She wouldn't like
  it."</p>

  <p>Properly reproved, Dr Beaven said he really knew better and would be
  careful about it in the future.</p>

  <p>"Does your aunt draw pictures of people planting rice?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Lovely ones. Aunt Audrey <i>is</i> Chinese." Teddy opened his big
  brown eyes wide and shook his head. "Didn't you know?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," said Dr Beaven, quietly. "I hadn't heard that. Are you sure?
  <i>You</i> aren't Chinese. And your mother isn't, is she?"</p>

  <p>"No. Just Aunt Audrey," said Teddy, firmly. "You'll see," he added, noting
  the doctor's expression of amused incredulity.</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine why he should say that," interposed Miss McFey.</p>

  <p>"I expect your aunt must have travelled a good deal in China," suggested
  Dr Beaven, "and that's why she likes the country so well.... Now let's
  have a peep at that arm. Oh&mdash;that's getting along famously."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;that isn't it," declared Teddy, oblivious to the arm.</p>

  <p>"My Aunt Audrey <i>is truly</i> a Chinese." He bobbed his head
  energetically. "You ask her!"</p>

  <p>"Very well," agreed the doctor. "You ought to know."</p>

  <p>"And she can eat with chopsticks same as you do with a spoon."</p>

  <p>"All right, Teddy. It's O.K. with me. And that's why she likes pictures of
  China."</p>

  <p>"She makes faces, too."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! How shocking!"</p>

  <p>Teddy laughed hilariously.</p>

  <p>"I mean&mdash;she draws faces. Maybe she'll draw a picture of <i>you,</i>
  I don't know, though. She's very polite."</p>

  <p>Dr Beaven grinned, and the little boy's face was perplexed.</p>

  <p>"I expect you're trying to say that your aunt is&mdash;is reserved. Do you
  know what that means?"</p>

  <p>Teddy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Shy," assisted Miss McFey.</p>

  <p>"Umm-humm," answered Teddy, uncertainly. "She's not like you, or&mdash;or
  my mother&mdash;or anybody. Her really name is Lan Ying, but I don't call her
  Lan Ying except when we play. My mother doesn't like to have me call her Lan
  Ying."</p>

  <p>Dr Beaven rose to go, feeling that they were probably getting too deep
  into family affairs.</p>

  <p>"I'll see you to-morrow, Teddy. Be a good boy."</p>

  <p>He closed the door behind him and proceeded to the elevator, aware that
  the nod with which he had just now greeted Dr Shane was indifferent enough to
  have been mistaken for an insult. Lan Ying, indeed! Lan Ying probably had a
  loose screw.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Sunday was a busy day. Not only did Jack have his own duties to perform,
  but Tubby's as well, plus much extra work occasioned by the absence of
  several staff members in attendance at the State Medical Association's annual
  meeting.</p>

  <p>With these pressing cares on his mind, the crowded hours passed with very
  little further thought about Teddy King&mdash;whose case did not require
  it&mdash;or of the lad's enigmatic relative who drew pictures of pagodas and
  ate with chopsticks. His imagined portrait of this lady was very sketchy.
  Obviously she was an eccentric maiden who had gone in for oriental things in
  a big way. The Cunningham letter had mentioned that her father made regular
  trips to China; a long time ago, doubtless. Perhaps he had taken her with him
  on one of his voyages to China. Or at least he had talked interestingly at
  home concerning the country. And, later&mdash;after the old man had
  died&mdash;this Audrey Hilton, with a comfortable income and nothing to do,
  with no home ties and indifferent to matrimony, had become a seasoned
  traveller.</p>

  <p>It was easy to contrive this much of a picture. She would be about forty;
  tall, wiry, resourceful; expert with a camera; a self-admitted authority on
  Chinese art. She would be able to tell a Yuan vase from a Ming at a hundred
  yards, and talk your arm off about the ethereal grace of pot-bellied
  Buddhas.</p>

  <p>Sooner or later he would be obliged to meet this Audrey Hilton&mdash;this
  Lan Ying&mdash;and make a decent show of being interested in what she had to
  say; for the lad's sake, and Tubby's and Dr Cunningham's.</p>

  <p>There was always a big jam in the hospital on Sunday afternoon. The finer
  the day the bigger the jam&mdash;and this was mid-June. Friends and relatives
  packed the elevators to suffocation and swarmed through the corridors, en
  route to administer candy and home worries to their sick. The doctors and
  nurses generally resorted to the stairways to go more easily from one floor
  to another. Occasionally seasoned visitors, reluctant to join the pushing
  pack in the sluggish elevators, took to the stairs, too.</p>

  <p>Jack Beaven rarely saw individuals in the Sunday afternoon multitude. The
  crowd was all of a piece. Not often did any of these people stir the
  slightest interest. Now and again, he had given a bit of idle thought to this
  matter, wondering whether it could be true that persons&mdash;otherwise and
  elsewhere intelligent and good-looking&mdash;inevitably sagged into a common
  state of flat-faced stupidity upon entering a hospital. Perhaps there was
  something in the air that brought it on.</p>

  <p>The day was gradually wearing itself and everybody else out. It was four
  o'clock now and the tide of visitors had begun to ebb. People were leaving by
  platoons. Jack had been up on the fourth floor to make sure the appendectomy
  he had done late last night was behaving itself. It had been an emergency
  affair, the patient having arrived in a party gown attended by her husband
  and a half-dozen friends in evening clothes. He had not told them afterwards
  what a narrow squeak she'd had. Tubby was always saying to his classes, "It
  is not necessary to inform your patient or his relatives, after an operation,
  that but for your remarkable skill there would have been a death in the
  family. Leave all that kind of prattle to the chaps who must blow about their
  cunning, if anyone is ever to learn of it."</p>

  <p>Glancing over the chart, Jack handed it back to the nurse, nodded his
  satisfaction, noted that the patient was sleeping normally, and proceeded on
  his way down to the third where a kidney drainage was becoming
  fretful&mdash;and not much wonder.</p>

  <p>He had pushed open the stiff spring swinging door leading to the stairway
  and was passing through when a brisk patter of heels on the stone floor
  informed him that he was closely followed. Obviously the heels belonged to a
  visitor; not a nurse. Pausing momentarily he tried to retain his grip on the
  door to prevent its snapping violently into someone's face, but it slipped
  from his fingers.</p>

  <p>Not to be thought rude, he turned, pushed the stubborn door open with his
  elbow, and waited indifferently for the heels to come through. She hesitated
  in the doorway, gave him an appreciative smile which sobered suddenly to a
  half-perplexed look of recognition. Then she smiled again, perhaps with a
  trace of amusement at the sight of his surprised eyes. Afterwards, when Jack
  reconstructed the details of that chance encounter, it occurred to him that
  he had simply stared unsmilingly into her face. His memory of her had been
  accurate in every detail. She hadn't changed in the slightest particular. The
  blue-black bobbed hair was in the same mode as before, the even-edged fringe
  concealing the upper half of an arrestingly white forehead. Sometimes he had
  thought his imagination had run away with him when he remembered her brown
  eyes, but now he realized that his mental picture had been correct. She was
  even dressed much as she had been on the night he had stared her out of
  countenance at the Livingstone. Her black satin blouse was buttoned to the
  throat where it was topped with a snug collar. An accordion-pleated white
  silk skirt completed the costume that sculptured a shapely figure.</p>

  <p>He instantly decided not to advert to their former meeting. To have done
  so would have been to confess a recollection implying a deeper interest than
  he cared to admit; and, besides, it might be embarrassing to her if he
  imputed the same interest on her own part. If she wanted to speak of
  it&mdash;well, that would be another matter. In that case, he could remember
  their meeting.</p>

  <p>She took a step forward, through the open doorway, and made a curiously
  quaint little bow.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said Jack. "These doors are very much in earnest."</p>

  <p>"They object&mdash;may-bee&mdash;to one's leaving the hospital." Her voice
  was softly pitched in a contralto register, and the words were spoken slowly,
  precisely, without an identifiable accent but with the cautious deliberation
  of one accustomed to thinking in another language. Her "maybe" was oddly
  stressed on the second syllable. "May-bee."</p>

  <p>Jack couldn't think of anything suitable to say in response to this. He
  remarked rather dryly that the stairway was not often used&mdash;except by
  employees.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" She raised her brows and shook her head in a manner amusingly
  childlike. "Perhaps I am not allowed. I did not know. I am very sor-ree."</p>

  <p>They had come to the door which opened into the third-floor corridor. He
  pushed it open and signed to her to precede him.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said, again with a little bow. "I shall go to the
  lift&mdash;for the remainder of my journey."</p>

  <p>"Not if you'd rather walk down," said Jack, casually. "Come along. I'll go
  with you. If you have a car parked, I can show you how to get out by the
  shortest route."</p>

  <p>"I am not imposing?" Again she shook her head&mdash;a gesture which seemed
  to accompany any query she hoped might be answered in the negative. "Do the
  taxicabs&mdash;are they available there too?"</p>

  <p>"No. They have to be called. I'll do it for you." They had arrived at the
  first floor. Jack indicated the way into the corridor.</p>

  <p>"I should not be taking your time, sir," she protested. He made no reply
  to that. Doubtless the appropriate thing to say was that he was happy to
  serve her, but habit was strong and he was not accustomed to making such
  remarks. Together they walked to the Information Desk.</p>

  <p>"Call a taxi for this lady, please," said Jack, crisply.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Dr Beaven," replied the clerk.</p>

  <p>The girl quickly raised her head and glanced up into his eyes. Her lips
  parted slightly in a smile that showed very white even teeth. He regarded her
  with sober interest.</p>

  <p>"It will be here presently," he said. "At the main entrance."</p>

  <p>"You have been very kind." She bowed again. "Thank you."</p>

  <p>For a moment Jack entertained an impulse to see her to the front door and
  into her cab, but his habit of strictly minding his own business intervened.
  Besides, he disliked the prospect of amusing the loquacious clerks in the
  front office by passing their windows with this young woman in tow. It
  wouldn't be in conformity with his normal behaviour.</p>

  <p>His eyes followed her for an instant. Then he retraced his course by the
  stairways, with the third floor as his objective. It had been a very stirring
  interlude. He wished he had contrived some plausible reason for learning her
  name. With a studious frown he tried mentally to call the roll of
  fourth-floor patients.</p>

  <p>His steps had lagged. Pulling himself together with a shrug of
  self-reproach, he scowled over the silly moment he had had. It was quite
  against his principles to permit himself to be distracted&mdash;for more than
  an instant&mdash;by a pretty face. He had driven her quite out of his
  thoughts, long ago. He would do so again. She wasn't going to mean anything
  to him. It was the girl's exotic flavour that had made her linger in his
  thoughts, no doubt. A most enchanting personality, quite unlike anyone he had
  ever met. Who and what was she? Something decidedly foreign, but difficult to
  place. Caucasian; no question about that. European? Probably not. No accent;
  not French, Spanish, Italian. Nothing Latin: too calm for that. Russian? No.
  That courtly bow: where did that come from?</p>

  <p>He paused before the door where he had met her, pushed it open, walked
  through, released it slowly, halted a moment at the window, still in a deep
  study. Then a light suddenly dawned, and with it came a slow smile.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'll be damned!" he muttered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NOTWITHSTANDING his reputation for cold-bloodedness, Jack
  Beaven had not arrived at thirty without experiencing many a sharp conflict
  between his head and his heart. These struggles were brief but savage.</p>

  <p>It was one thing to have mapped an ambitious programme of unremitting
  effort in the cause of Science: it was quite another thing to conform to the
  severe demands of that inflexible design. The seizures of revolt did not
  threaten the plan very often; but, when they did, the uprising was
  violent.</p>

  <p>For about three hundred and sixty days of the year Jack was complacent
  over the stern self-discipline he practised, and had good reasons for feeling
  that his sacrifices provided their own reward. To maintain his ambition was a
  costly investment, but it had paid him profitably. As he surveyed the current
  professional rating of his former classmates&mdash;very few of whom had
  struck their stride&mdash;it was apparent that he had been exceptionally
  fortunate.</p>

  <p>Doubtless there had been an element of luck in his early and sound
  success. He was ready to concede that. In any of the so-called learned
  professions it was demonstrated, over and over again, that of two men equally
  in earnest, equally industrious, equally prepared, one might move rapidly
  into reward and recognition while his friend plodded along, doggedly
  perseverant, but without promise of advancement. Some little quirk of
  personality, perhaps quite irrelevant to the actual requirements of the job,
  might prove to be the deciding factor; some odd mannerism, maybe, that the
  man himself was hardly aware of; an over-ready, open-faced smile that
  suggested toadyism, the involuntary disclosure of a lack of self-confidence;
  or an habitual pursing of the lips as if to say&mdash;"This is it: you can
  take it or leave it."</p>

  <p>Jack had been lucky, and was appropriately thankful. But there was no
  denying that most of his success could be explained by his stubborn
  determination to let nothing beguile him from the road he had chosen to
  travel. Ordinarily he proceeded on this deliberately charted course with
  steady steps, entirely self-possessed, and assured that what he had achieved
  already was worth its price. And it had been very costly.</p>

  <p>His angular pattern for living had squared his shoulders, tensed his jaw,
  chiselled an arc of crow's-feet on each temple, firmed his mouth, and
  narrowed his steel-blue eyes. His conversation was restricted to professional
  matters. He was increasingly economical with his words. Nobody could or did
  say that he was gruff. His attitude toward those whom he outranked was
  consistently just and considerate. He was courteous to the young interns, to
  the nurses and orderlies; but when he commanded that something be done it was
  issued in a tone clearly meaning that either the order, or the person who
  received it, would have to be carried out.</p>

  <p>But there were occasional bad days and nights when Beaven doubted whether
  the game was worth the candle. At such times, he looked back with derision
  upon the personal sacrifices he had made in an effort to hold the rough road
  toward his goal. Where the average man, in a blue funk of remorse over his
  mistakes, generally lashed himself for his laziness and dissipations, Jack's
  sour reflections deplored the loss of the normal pleasures he had missed
  while serving a master who wanted all of his time or none of it.</p>

  <p>Unswerving ambition was a thrilling thing to yodel about, if you were a
  well-paid grand opera tenor, dying nightly for noble principles, and rushing
  out&mdash;after the sublime tragedy&mdash;to fill your capacious paunch with
  spaghetti and chianti; but it wasn't quite so stirring if pursued without
  orchestral accompaniment.</p>

  <p>Lonely valour was easy enough for the poets; easy enough for the
  high-school valedictorian, fetching his oration to a heart-bumping climax
  with the resounding shout&mdash;"Excelsior!" Very glibly could this
  insufferably bright boy mouth the classic lines recording a young hero's
  ascent to greatness and glory. A gallant fellow, this youth with the banner.
  Up and up and up went he. "In happy homes he saw the light"&mdash;but on he
  climbed, undetained. "Oh, stay," the maiden said, "and rest thy weary head
  upon this breast"&mdash;but no, sirree, said he, said he: Excelsior!...
  <i>That</i> kind of stuff.... A bit dismaying at the end of the trip,
  however. "There in the twilight, cold and grey, lifeless but beautiful he
  lay." And who cared a tinker's damn? The fellow had never really belonged
  anywhere. The people who hadn't asked anything better of life than to be
  amply fed, decently clothed, happily married, beloved at home, and respected
  by the neighbourhood, thought this chap with the grim face and highfalutin
  banner was a nut.</p>

  <p>And after he had worn himself out on his solitary trek, he at length
  slumped down on the tipmost top&mdash;encased in snow and ice, banner and
  all&mdash;to take the count. "And from the sky, serene and far, a voice fell
  like a falling star&mdash;Excelsior!"</p>

  <p>Now&mdash;wasn't that nice? And who wouldn't love to go plugging along by
  himself, bearing a banner with a strange device&mdash;"Excelsior", perhaps,
  or "Neurological Surgery"; spurning the welcoming lights shining in the
  windows of happy homes; thumbing a frost-bitten nose at the generous maiden
  with the hospitable breast; finally winding up at the summit, stiff as a
  statue and dead as Queen Anne&mdash;but beautiful; oh, how beautiful! A
  shivering angel, blowing steam into his mittens, would softly coo
  "Excelsior". Fine pay for the perils of the trip! Nobody else would care a
  hoot. In the spring thaw, a Saint Bernard dog would nose him out....
  "Lookit!" calls the pious monk. "Excelsior."</p>

  <p>But Beaven took pains to disguise his feelings when these moods (they
  usually swamped him for a day or two in early summer, and during the
  Christmas holidays) descended like a sudden fog to make him desperately
  restless and remorseful.</p>

  <p>Happily, through all the years&mdash;until just now&mdash;no identifiable
  lights had beckoned to him from any particular window. The happy home he had
  passed up was a mere phantom. If he had impulsively decided to renounce his
  ambition and rush with all speed toward that happy home, he wouldn't have
  known where to find it. The maiden who called, "Oh, stay!" lacked a name and
  a street address. No girl had been attractive enough to disturb him, much
  less detain him. This was to be accounted for by the fact that he had
  resolved not to be attracted. Something warned him that the surest immunity
  against falling in love was an attitude of complete detachment from the whole
  tribe of them. And&mdash;if he did have to say it himself&mdash;he had done a
  thoroughly good job of avoiding them.</p>

  <p>To the effective pursuance of this resolve, Jack Beaven had practised a
  technique of his own devising. He was half ashamed of it, and not for any
  consideration would he have confided the nature of it to a friend, however
  urgent his need of counsel in this field. When brought face to face with a
  pair of bewitchingly pretty lips, he steadied himself against disaster by
  looking straight through to the exact spot where the quadratus labii
  superiosis separated into three muscular controls employed in the enchanting
  act of smiling. If she pouted a little under this scientific inspection, he
  noted the slight twitch of the mentalis muscle at its point of origin in the
  incisive fossa. You could keep yourself on an even keel by performing these
  imaginary dissections. They were never done in a spirit of disrespect.
  Indeed, he felt he was doing the girl a favour if&mdash;upon observing that
  she was cordially disposed toward him&mdash;he could promptly signify that
  her charms were being wasted. He didn't like to have people take up his time,
  and he assumed that others should be grateful if he was considerate of
  theirs.</p>

  <p>These dissections were in the nature of insurance. Destiny having decreed
  that you were to be a celibate in the cause of science, you had a right to
  defend yourself against impulses that might distract your attention. Jack
  always knew how to deal with the lingering memory of a provocative curve.
  Immediately he fancied himself in the operating room. "Scalpel," he would
  mutter to the nurse at his elbow. "Sponge... Retractor... Forceps...
  Scissors... Needles." Ordinarily this method was fool-proof and
  time-worthy.</p>

  <p>On the Sunday night after his chance meeting with the girl he had every
  reason to believe was Audrey Hilton, Jack discovered that she was much on his
  mind. At six he had gone up to Teddy's room to pay his respects to the little
  fellow, whom he had not seen all day.</p>

  <p>"I wanted you to come this afternoon," complained Teddy in a tone that
  accused the doctor of having let him down. "Lan Ying was here to see me."</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Teddy. It has been a busy day. Perhaps I may see your aunt
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I told her about you."</p>

  <p>"And I suppose she laughed, as you said your mother did."</p>

  <p>Teddy's face wrinkled in perplexity.</p>

  <p>"About my calling you 'Mr King'," explained the doctor, smiling.</p>

  <p>Teddy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No. Lan Ying wouldn't think that was funny."</p>

  <p>"So you didn't tell her that, eh?" drawled the doctor, absently, as he
  inspected the child's arm.</p>

  <p>"He gave you a reputation as a very hard worker, Dr Beaven," said Miss
  McFey. "I think Miss Hilton got the impression that you never slept."</p>

  <p>"You tell her not to worry, Teddy," said the doctor, reassuringly. "I get
  plenty of sleep."</p>

  <p>But not that night. At eleven he had gone to his room, made himself
  comfortable in dressing-gown and slippers, and begun an intensive review of a
  case-history&mdash;an intradural tumour which was going to be on the table
  promptly at nine in the morning.</p>

  <p>He knitted his brows in earnest concentration upon the words before him,
  annoyed by interpolations which kept breaking into Dr Rogers's account of a
  previous operation that had proved ineffective. "I then removed another
  lamina at the upper part of the incision&mdash;(They
  object&mdash;may-bee&mdash;to one's leaving the hospital!)&mdash;and on
  opening the dura mater I saw on the left side of the cavity a round,
  dark-bluish mass about 3 mm. in diameter&mdash;(Oh? Perhaps I am not allowed.
  I am very sor-ree)&mdash;resting upon the left lateral column and posterior
  root zone of the spinal cord&mdash;(I should not be taking your time,
  sir)."</p>

  <p>And that was a fact. Realizing that these upraised brown eyes and full red
  lips were playing the very devil with to-morrow's duty, Jack determined to
  have it out with the intruder and be done with her. He tossed the bulky
  script on to the table, filled his pipe and lighted it, and settled himself
  deep in his chair, his eyes half closed.</p>

  <p>He was in the operating-room now, and had nodded toward the door, signing
  that he was ready. Presently they wheeled her in. Young Linquist was at the
  foot, backing into the room. Harvey was at the other end, pushing. The rubber
  castors rolled noiselessly. Flagler was closing in, at the rear, with his
  portable anæsthetizing apparatus. Miss Terry was gingerly picking at a
  viciously hot towel with rubber-clad finger-tips, unwrapping the instruments.
  The only sound was the hiss of steam escaping from the valve of the
  autoclaves. He nodded to Harvey, who drew down the rubber mask from its perch
  above the patient's head, and was making ready to adjust it over her face. It
  was all very vivid.</p>

  <p>He put out a staying hand and regarded her almost childish face with
  solicitude, trying to brace himself against a sensation of tenderness. Roused
  by this scrutiny, she slowly opened her eyes, looked up into his with a
  bewildered little smile of recognition. "Oh!" she said. "Is something the
  matter with me?" She shook her head as she asked the question, hopeful of a
  negative reply. "No," he heard himself saying, firmly. "There's something the
  matter with <i>me.</i> I'm operating on you to cure what ails me. Understand?
 ..." "May-bee," she answered, pensively.</p>

  <p>Shaking himself loose from his painful reverie, Jack rose and paced up and
  down the room for a few turns, tossed aside his dressing-gown, dressed
  hurriedly in his street clothes, went downstairs and out into the warm June
  night. The policeman at the corner greeted him. "You're out late, Doc."</p>

  <p>He returned from his walk about three, quite restored to his normal mind.
  He had been working too hard, his resistance was down, he had undertaken too
  many extra responsibilities in Tubby's absence. Everything would be all right
  again, to-morrow. One thing was certain: he wasn't going to permit an
  intriguing smile to make a monkey of him after all the expensive
  self-restraint invested in the pursuit of the only thing in the world that
  really mattered, This girl-smitten Beaven who had mooned and dreamed for a
  poignantly unhappy hour wasn't going to be allowed to double-cross this
  steadfast Beaven who had kept his nose to the grindstone for eight years. He
  took up the case-history of the intradural tumour and read it through with
  care, made a handful of memoranda, left a six-thirty call, went to
  bed&mdash;and slept.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>No effort was made to have a glimpse of this mysterious Lan Ying on
  Monday. At noon Jack had dropped in, briefly, to say "Hello" to the little
  boy, promising to call later in the day. But he had not done so.</p>

  <p>Time was an excellent healer of diseases. When in doubt about what to do,
  do nothing. While you are waiting to decide what should be done, the problem
  may solve itself. How often this had been demonstrated in baffling cases in
  the hospital. Tubby was an ardent advocate of this principle. Put the man to
  bed and keep him under observation for a while. Don't rush at him with pills
  and tools until you're sure of your diagnosis. And give Time a chance to do
  something for him.</p>

  <p>This desire to see more of Audrey Hilton was probably an ephemeral wish, a
  mere phosphorescence that would be driven into total eclipse by the bright
  white lights of absorbing tasks in the operating-room.</p>

  <p>On Tuesday morning, a bit apologetic when he observed that Teddy's
  feelings had been hurt, Jack went to some pains to exhibit a friendly
  interest. The boy's bed was strewn with sheets of drawing paper bearing
  pencil-sketches.</p>

  <p>"Teddy has been anxious to show you some pictures," said Miss McFey. "His
  aunt drew them for him, yesterday."</p>

  <p>The doctor took up three or four of the scattered pages for close
  inspection, cleverly executed drawings of dwarfed trees with branches that
  postured meaningfully.</p>

  <p>"This," explained Teddy, leaning forward with his cheek snuggled against
  the doctor's forearm, "is a very tired tree. It has been working all night
  and is worn out."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I can see it is," agreed the doctor.</p>

  <p>"It seems to need some leaves," put in Miss McFey.</p>

  <p>"Of absence, probably," he added, a remark that was wasted on both of
  them.</p>

  <p>"This one," Teddy went on, pleased to be serving as interpreter, "is Miss
  McFey, bringing in the orange juice. And this is me, squatting, with the
  catcher's mitt. This is the best one, I think."</p>

  <p>"So do I." The doctor grinned over the grotesque but deucedly lifelike
  personifications. He put down the trees and took up another sheet.</p>

  <p>"Faces," said Teddy. "Not really faces; just parts of faces. Lan Ying
  likes to make eyes and noses and ears and chins, by themselves. These are all
  mouths."</p>

  <p>"It's easy enough to find yours, Teddy."</p>

  <p>"I told Miss Hilton," said the nurse, "that it looked as much like her own
  mouth as it did like Teddy's."</p>

  <p>Dr Beaven briefly nodded, leaving Miss McFey to speculate privately. He
  observed an inquisitive light in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"It would be very natural if they resembled each other," he said promptly,
  hoping this comment would take effect.</p>

  <p>"That's Miss McFey," said Teddy.</p>

  <p>"Umm." The doctor nodded his recognition. "Here's one that looks as if it
  might bite. Pretty grim, I'd say."</p>

  <p>Teddy rumpled his hair with white fingers and grinned uneasily.</p>

  <p>"That isn't a very good one," he said, reaching for the paper. "Sometimes
  Lan Ying doesn't draw very good ones."</p>

  <p>Miss McFey was busily gathering up the sketches.</p>

  <p>"We mustn't keep Dr Beaven too long, Teddy. Let's clear off the bed now
  and give the doctor a chance to examine you."</p>

  <p>Suddenly the child resolved to be honest, no matter what came of it. He
  retrieved the page of mouths and pointed to the severe one.</p>

  <p>"That's the way Lan Ying thinks you look," he said, with a deprecatory
  chuckle. "But that's because she never saw you."</p>

  <p>"And you told her, Teddy, that Dr Beaven worked very hard," assisted
  untactful Miss McFey, tactfully. "So&mdash;she tried to draw a tired
  one."</p>

  <p>"This isn't a tired mouth," remarked the doctor. "This is an <i>iron</i>
  mouth." He decided to make a little joke of it. "This mouth could take a
  handful of marbles, Teddy, and chew 'em up into&mdash;into oatmeal."</p>

  <p>"Do you like to play marbles?" asked the child, much relieved to steer the
  conversation into a more pleasant channel.</p>

  <p>Yes&mdash;he liked to play marbles; that is, he did a long time ago; and
  now we would have another look at the arm, and be on our way.</p>

  <p>The incident was trivial enough, but he wished it hadn't happened.
  Clearly, this Audrey Hilton had given both her nephew and the nurse to
  understand that there had been no meeting. The McFey girl would know better.
  The drawing of his mouth might be arrestingly unflattering, but it was easily
  recognizable. McFey couldn't be much blamed if she was inquisitive. Perhaps
  she would confide the little mystery to someone else. The thought annoyed
  him. He could imagine the physically opulent McFey, whose red head was so
  full of romantic nonsense that she wasn't above making eyes at the orderlies,
  chattering some rubbish as&mdash;"And she let on that she had never seen him,
  and he as much as said he'd never seen her, and there was that
  picture&mdash;the spit-'n'-image of him. What d'you know about that?"</p>

  <p>He went up to the operating-room to make ready for a ten o'clock
  gall-bladder, changed to his surgical kit, and began the usual process of
  scrubbing up. He glanced into the mirror and studied his mouth from a fresh
  angle of observation. It wasn't a sullen mouth, or a cruel mouth, or a
  pessimistic mouth. It wasn't peevish or petulant. The worst thing you could
  say about it was that it looked&mdash;determined. He thrust an elbow against
  the control that increased the heat of the water in the basin and continued
  his vigorous scrubbing. Determined&mdash;that's the way it looked. A damn'
  good trait, too. Fine thing if more people had it. Maybe they'd get
  somewhere. (May-bee.)</p>

  <p>The Chinese might not approve of that sentiment, but who were the Chinese?
  They hadn't contributed very much to the world's welfare. Mighty little they
  knew about science. You probably wouldn't see many mouths like this in China.
  But that didn't mean that this one was reprehensible. May-bee she hadn't
  meant it that way. May-bee she liked a firm, straight, indefatigable mouth....
 But what difference did it make <i>what</i> manner of mouth she liked?
  She would be gone by the day after to-morrow. He would put her out of his
  mind entirely. In fact, he had almost done so already. He caught his eye in
  the glass and queried it for a substantiation of this last remark, and was
  instantly informed that he was a liar.</p>

  <p>His reflection candidly told him that not only was he trying to fool
  himself about his dismissal of Audrey Hilton from his mind; he had also tried
  to fool himself about that mouth of his. "Determined"&mdash;he had said,
  complacently. That wasn't the word for it at all. "Detached"&mdash;that was
  it. Except for his tireless activities in a small world of test-tubes and
  retorts, microscopes and fluoroscopes, dissections and operations, he lived
  apart. It was a dismaying world, cluttered with pickled corpses and sick
  rabbits. He had put the real world behind him so long ago that he had
  forgotten what it was about. It had been years since he had talked to an old
  man, except to get his case-history. He knew so little about young children
  that he was embarrassed in their presence. His understanding of women was
  restricted to an accurate knowledge of their anatomy. His few friends moved
  about in a world not much larger than his own, talking in scientific terms
  and smelling of antiseptics and ether.</p>

  <p>It was a detached mouth; and, in the effort to arrive at this detachment,
  it had become <i>hard.</i> Not much wonder if nobody slapped Jack Beaven on
  the back, or detained him with a droll story, or suggested a few hours off
  duty for a frolic.</p>

  <p>Audrey Hilton had captured and defined that mouth with a half-dozen
  pencil-strokes. She knew more about his mouth than he did.</p>

  <p>He held out his arms for the surgical gown and the Warren girl slipped the
  sleeves to the shoulder. Their eyes met for a split second. Her impersonal
  look suggested that if she had any talent for drawing, her picture of him
  would be much the same as the one that had disturbed him. Maybe he looked
  like that to everybody.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The next morning he told Teddy that he might go home on Thursday. It was
  no surprise. They had been talking about it for several days.</p>

  <p>"When Miss Hilton comes, this afternoon," he added, to Miss McFey, "you
  may say that I shall hope to see her before she leaves the hospital. You will
  call me, please."</p>

  <p>From then on he went about his usual duties in an abstracted manner,
  frequently consulting his watch, now wondering why the time passed so slowly,
  now wishing the interview over. When three o'clock came, he found himself in
  an expectant attitude; starting, a little, whenever he heard the sound of a
  house-telephone. At three-forty-five he was in the men's surgical,
  readjusting an elevating apparatus for a broken hip, when a ward nurse
  informed him he was wanted on the telephone. His heart bumped.</p>

  <p>"Beaven," said Dr Shane, urgently, "come up to operating-room C. They've
  just brought in another automobile crack-up. Two of 'em. Looks bad for the
  girl. I haven't had a chance to examine her very closely yet, but I'm afraid
  her neck is broken."</p>

  <p>"O.K., Shane; I'll be right up."</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure whether he was annoyed or relieved that something had
  interfered. On the way to the operating-room he decided that he would ask one
  of the nurses to inform Miss Hilton of the emergency that had turned up. He
  would see her, if possible, later.</p>

  <p>Arriving in the operating-room, it became apparent at once that they were,
  as Shane had suspected, dealing with a broken neck. The young woman, probably
  twenty-two, was dully conscious and when asked to move her arm could not do
  so. Several plates were made of the injury, and it was evident that
  considerable damage had been done to the cord. Jack decided against any
  operative interference, but followed along to the room to observe the rate of
  temperature increase which would indicate whether heroic measures should be
  undertaken at once.</p>

  <p>He talked to her in a very business-like way.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?"</p>

  <p>"Prentiss. Nancy Prentiss."</p>

  <p>"Miss Prentiss&mdash;" Jack began, seriously.</p>

  <p>"Mrs Prentiss," she said.</p>

  <p>"Oh. Then the man who was hurt with you is your husband."</p>

  <p>"No. My husband is away&mdash;looking for a job."</p>

  <p>"Well, Mrs Prentiss, your recovery depends on your own ability to keep
  your head and obey orders. Your neck is hurt very badly, but I think you are
  going to get well&mdash;provided you lie still, no matter how uncomfortable
  you are, and make sure you do no further injury to this place that is broken.
  For the present I am going to stay right here with you&mdash;and so is the
  nurse. Remember that any crying, any excitement is going to send your fever
  kiting; and then we will have to do something very serious. If you will keep
  cool and be quiet, you have a chance. Are you going to work with us?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Doctor. May I see my mother?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow."</p>

  <p>"She will want to see me."</p>

  <p>"We will explain."</p>

  <p>"She will take on, if you don't let her see me."</p>

  <p>"Thanks for telling me. If your mother is a taker-on, we can do nicely
  without her for a couple of days. Don't worry. We will tell her all about
  it."</p>

  <p>"She has my baby."</p>

  <p>"Very good. It's in safe hands. You will not need to fret about it. No
  more talking now."</p>

  <p>At nine the chart showed that the temperature was holding at 102
  1/2<sup>0</sup>. The patient was asleep under a strong sedative.</p>

  <p>"I am going out now for an hour," said Jack to the nurse. "If you want me,
  the Desk will know where I am."</p>

  <p>He had had nothing to eat since morning but a sandwich and a glass of milk
  at noon, but the stresses of the past few hours had made him indifferent to
  the thought of food. Going down to the main office he put through a call to
  the Livingstone Hotel and presently recognized the low-pitched voice with the
  foreign influence giving it a cautious precision.</p>

  <p>"Very sorry not to have seen you to-day, Miss Hilton. We had some
  unexpected trouble here, and I couldn't get away. They may have told you. I
  should have liked to talk with you before you take your nephew home. Is there
  anything I can do for you?"</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, Doctor," she said, carefully spacing her words. "I am
  sor-ree too that I must leave without your instructions about Teddy, his
  exercises, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How would it be if I came over to see you now? I am relieved from duty
  for a little while."</p>

  <p>"Yes; you may come. Thank you."</p>

  <p>Hurriedly changing to his street clothes, Jack took a taxi to the hotel.
  Upon inquiring at the desk for Miss Hilton, the clerk said she was in Parlour
  Suite A, and had left word that he was to be shown up. He followed the
  bell-boy to the elevator, ascended to the top floor, pressed the button, and
  waited, wondering what manner of reception he might have.</p>

  <p>She opened the door and he stood for a moment rather nonplussed. Teddy
  hadn't been fooling. His Aunt Audrey was Chinese.</p>

  <p>In response to her deferential bow, he stepped into the room. She was
  dressed in a black satin jacket with a high throat and long sleeves, black
  satin trousers, tiny black satin slippers.</p>

  <p>Taking his hat, she nodded toward a chair and seated herself opposite
  him.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said, "for coming."</p>

  <p>For five minutes Beaven was strictly professional, laying out a programme
  of simple exercises for restoring the boy's arm to its normal condition and
  usefulness. Audrey Hilton listened attentively, with an occasional question
  when his terms became too technical for her to understand.</p>

  <p>Then there was a little pause. Beaven's errand seemed to be over, but he
  was not ready to go. He hesitated. He could not overcome the impulse to
  continue on a more personal basis.</p>

  <p>"Teddy said you were Chinese, but I thought the child was just having
  fun."</p>

  <p>"Not really, Doctor." Her tone was comradely. "You knew&mdash;on
  Sunday&mdash;that I wasn't quite&mdash;quite orthodox. Oh, how severely your
  eyes accused me of being something foreign."</p>

  <p>Jack smiled and nodded.</p>

  <p>"And my mouth, too, I fear. I admit that I couldn't quite make you out,
  and of course it wasn't any of my business to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To solve the riddle. Certainly not. But if it interests you, at all, I
  shall tell you."</p>

  <p>"Tell me anything you like," said Jack, encouragingly. "I feel sure it's
  more than a mere masquerade."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. Do you want to smoke, Dr Beaven? A pipe&mdash;may-bee?" She
  abandoned the straight chair where she had sat so primly, and chose a low
  stool, folding her arms over her knees, and watching him with interest while
  he filled his pipe.</p>

  <p>"There is of course nothing unusual about an American's being born in Hong
  Kong," she began. "This has happened many, many times; children of
  missionaries, and embassy people. But it is not often that an American child
  remains abroad very long. He is sent back to school. He quickly forgets the
  land of his birth and finds himself quite at home in the land of
  his&mdash;his nationality."</p>

  <p>"And you remained," said Jack, "until you became Chinese. Is that it?"</p>

  <p>"My father was the commander of a steamship. For twelve years he went back
  and forth from America to China. Naturally he had opportunities to meet many
  well-born and educated citizens of China, on their journeys to this country
  on business; commercial, political. It was not always comfortable for them.
  Sometimes they were given the cold shoulder by Americans who had had no
  experience with Chinese, except those they had seen in some menial
  service.</p>

  <p>"My father seemed to understand their predicament, and they probably
  sensed his sympathy. May-bee the word was quietly passed among them that
  Captain Hilton was a cosmopolitan gentleman. One never knows just how such
  information gets about in China. They are very good at keeping their own
  counsel, and equally good at sharing knowledge that might be of mutual
  benefit.</p>

  <p>"There was a Chinese merchant in Hong Kong named Sen Ling&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jack's eyes widened a little.</p>

  <p>"What is it Teddy calls you?&mdash;Lan Ying?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, smiling. Responding to his evident interest, she seemed to
  welcome the opportunity to explain herself.</p>

  <p>"On Sen Ling's first trip to America his feelings were hurt so badly that
  when he boarded my father's ship for his return he was half-ill with his
  humiliation. Perhaps it was his own fault, really. He had seen so many
  splendid things done for his servants who had been in the hospital and school
  of the American Christians that he thought our people here had a feeling of
  fellowship with the Chinese. He might have known better. If it had so
  happened that he himself&mdash;together with Chinese men of his own
  caste&mdash;were faced with the miseries of ignorant and superstitious
  Americans of the lowest class, he might have fed them for sheer pity's sake;
  but he would not have expected the Americans of his own social rating to
  express great gratitude over his philanthropies. He might rather have
  expected them to be embarrassed and annoyed by his performing charities they
  had neglected. They would hold themselves stiffly aloof, and he would never
  understand. He would despise them for their haughtiness, and all he would
  ever know of their civilization he would have to learn from their ignorant
  masses.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;Sen Ling, hopeful of finding a warmth of heart in the Americans,
  was badly snubbed. And as if it was not enough for him to board the ship for
  home wounded and shamed, a few Americans on the vessel took pains to let him
  see their contempt. My father had it from the ship's doctor that Sen Ling was
  ill, and he went to his stateroom. They had a long talk. My father moved Sen
  Ling to a cabin in his own suite, had him out on the bridge and explained the
  mysteries in the chart-room. And then, after the voyage, he probably forgot
  all about the incident; but Sen Ling remembered. After that, whenever my
  father's ship docked at Hong Kong, Sen Ling was at the wharf waiting to bow a
  welcome to him; sent him gifts; invited him to be his guest. At first, my
  father pleaded business as his excuse for refusing to accept these
  invitations. But, once he had gone there, he never made port at Hong Kong
  without calling at the house of Sen Ling where he was entertained as a dear
  friend. It was a palatial home." She paused, reflecting.</p>

  <p>"I am sure you must have seen it," said Jack, hoping she might
  elaborate.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I had always lived there until about three years ago. It was
  verree difficult to leave my Chinese home. For a while after coming to
  America I was so lonesome I thought I should have to return. I cannot tell
  you how deeply indebted I am to Dr and Mrs Cunningham for their friendship
  when I was so distressed. They have frequently taken me with them on little
  trips. The first time they did so&mdash;only a few days after I had arrived
  in this country&mdash;they brought me with them to a Commencement at the
  University." She looked up and smiled. "Dr Cunningham made a talk to the
  members of his class at the Livingstone Hotel."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Jack. "I remember."</p>

  <p>"You did not like his speech." Her tone invited him to say why he had not
  liked it.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I did not hear very much of it," he replied. "There was a good
  deal of confusion in the foyer where we stood. And my attention
  was&mdash;diverted.... It had been an eventful day," he hastened to add.
  "My own graduation&mdash;and a flock of rather unusual occurrences." Then,
  impulsively, he confided, "I didn't mean to offend you, that night. I have
  always been sorry."</p>

  <p>Her smile raced his heart.</p>

  <p>"You have a good memory," she said.</p>

  <p>"At times." Jack felt the three-year-old episode had now been sufficiently
  reviewed and hoped to restore the conversation to its previous theme.
  "So&mdash;for most of your life&mdash;you've lived in China. Wouldn't you
  like to tell me about it?"</p>

  <p>"Gladly&mdash;if I am not keeping you."'</p>

  <p>The telephone rang. She rose and answered it.</p>

  <p>"For you," she said, handing him the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Yes, Miss Warren. Yes; right away."</p>

  <p>He tossed the receiver back on the hook and turned to her with a little
  shake of his head.</p>

  <p>"That's the way it goes," he muttered. "That"&mdash;he pointed to the
  telephone as if it symbolized the restrictions under which he
  lived&mdash;<i>"that</i> thing has a strangle-hold on me&mdash;for life!" He
  reached out his hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorree," she said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NEXT morning, after the departure of Audrey Hilton and
  Teddy, Jack Beaven received an official communication from the Board of
  Trustees offering him the position of Assistant Professor of Anatomy. The
  gratifying news arrived at a strategic moment, for the recipient was very
  restless and depressed.</p>

  <p>With a consistent perversity, Tubby had chosen to arrive in town yesterday
  just in time to assume full charge of the migration, thus making it entirely
  unnecessary for Jack to accompany Miss Hilton and her young nephew to the
  train. Unable to have another glimpse of Audrey after having been hastily
  summoned from the hotel to the hospital, he had counted on a final word with
  her, on the way to the railroad station. He had no hope of learning the rest
  of the Chinese story, but there would be some comfort in seeing her once
  more. After that, he would endeavour to put her out of his thoughts.</p>

  <p>Shortly before they left the hospital, Jack had gone to Teddy's room to
  say Good-bye. The excited little boy was friendly but distracted by the
  confusion of packing. Audrey, at their formal handshake of parting, looked
  for an instant into his eyes with an expression of anxiety that suggested a
  candid sharing of his disappointment in leaving their acquaintance dangling
  with no expectation of cultivating it further.</p>

  <p>Feeling himself decidedly in the way, Jack had left the room and gone
  about his business, promptly experiencing a sag in his spirits. He hadn't
  realized until now the extent of Audrey Hilton's invasion of his peace. All
  the afternoon he kept saying to himself that if there had been an opportunity
  for a few words with her alone he might have been satisfied to declare their
  brief friendship a closed incident. If he could have had a chance to thank
  her for giving him a little glimpse of her most interesting story; if he
  could have told her how much he regretted the circumstances that had broken
  into her fascinating narrative; if he could have expressed the hope that some
  time&mdash;who knows?&mdash;they might meet again, it would have helped
  immeasurably to bring their mutual interest to a much less disquieting
  conclusion. He slept very little that night and awoke in the morning with the
  feeling that life was barely worth the bother of living it.</p>

  <p>With the arrival of the impressive document, Jack immediately felt that
  the universe could be viewed if not with jubilation at least with patience,
  tolerance, and a willingness to arbitrate.</p>

  <p>The University's recognition of him had not materially altered Jack's
  duties but had definitely improved his status. Henceforth instead of serving
  merely as a refractor behind the brilliant light shed by Tubby Forrester, he
  would be given a chance to generate a bit of illumination on his own account.
  Now he was to have better rating; a respectable salary, too, though that
  didn't matter so much except for the satisfaction of receiving wages
  commensurate to his work. The money problem had never bothered him. Indeed
  the modest trust fund which constituted his inheritance had been so much more
  than his need of it that its reinvestment annually had amassed a tidy sum. To
  have his salary raised from seventy-five dollars per month to two
  hundred&mdash;immediately effective&mdash;meant nothing more to Jack than an
  acknowledgment that his services to the Medical College and the hospital had
  increased in value. With no dependants and few desires, this feature of his
  promotion counted for very little beyond its pleasant implication that he was
  progressing professionally; and that, after all, was the only thing worth a
  moment's thought.</p>

  <p>He was sincerely grateful that this boost had come to him at an hour when
  it was a debatable matter whether his profession was going to command the
  attention he had previously given it. Now he was able to take a fresh grip on
  his responsibilities, reassuring himself that his steady devotion to a policy
  of hard work and no play was justified. The letter had come in the nick of
  time. It would help him forget the girl.</p>

  <p>Tubby, of course, was directly responsible for the appointment. Under no
  circumstances would the Board of Trustees have taken this action without the
  full approval of the Professor of Anatomy. Tubby had suggested it and had
  seen to it that the resolution was put through. Common decency demanded that
  some expression of gratitude should be promptly forthcoming; no easy task, in
  this case.</p>

  <p>That afternoon, Jack called at Tubby's office, not quite sure yet about
  the phrasing of his appreciation; sure only that it was up to him to
  acknowledge the favour.</p>

  <p>"Dr Forrester," he began, "I have received the appointment as Assistant
  Professor of Anatomy. I&mdash;I appreciate it very much."</p>

  <p>"Then you'd better write to the Board of Trustees," drawled Tubby, "and
  tell 'em so."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Jack, lamely, feeling that there wasn't much more to be
  added. He turned to leave the room.</p>

  <p>"Dr Beaven," barked Tubby. "It is none of my business where you live, but
  I understand they're crowded in the Hospital Annexe. Now that you are a
  member of the faculty, I suggest that you move to other quarters. You can
  afford to, now."</p>

  <p>Jack felt a slow flush creeping up his cheeks. Tubby's insinuation that he
  was likely to be too stingy to leave his free quarters among the interns was
  insufferable. God knew he wouldn't have been living there if his day and
  night duties in the hospital had not required it. For an instant he was
  impelled to say as much, but thought better of it. After all, he had come
  here to thank Tubby; not to make war with him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," he said, shortly, and left the room.</p>

  <p>The fact was&mdash;however indignant he felt&mdash;it hadn't occurred to
  him that he would now be free to live more comfortably. Doubtless the thought
  would have come to him presently. It would seem very queer to be setting up
  an establishment of his own. With the new idea in mind, he took a couple of
  hours off, next day, to investigate available bachelor suites in the
  vicinity.</p>

  <p>Having lived for years with the bare necessities of existence, sleeping on
  a hospital bed and sharing a community bathroom, his mental vision of new
  quarters comprehended a small suite of two furnished rooms and a bath. But
  after having been shown a more commodious apartment on a residence street
  fully a mile from the Medical College it suddenly struck him that if he was
  to live the rest of his life alone he was at least entitled to surround
  himself with a few things he could call his own. The apartment was
  unfurnished. For the next few days, every spare hour was spent in shopping
  for the equipment of his new home. Once he had begun it, he gave the matter
  his full attention, wondering&mdash;as he saw his possessions
  arrive&mdash;why he had gone so long without desiring them.</p>

  <p>The little cubicle that the apartment-house manager had&mdash;no doubt
  jocularly&mdash;referred to as a library was the only room left unplanned.
  Jack closed the door on that, deciding to wait until he could think of some
  use for it. The living-room was to serve also as a library. One of the
  bedrooms&mdash;the one with the north light&mdash;would be fitted up as a
  laboratory. It was a strange sensation&mdash;to be a householder.</p>

  <p>He framed the most recent pictures of Jean and her two small children and
  hung them above his new leather-topped desk, wishing he had the right to ask
  Audrey Hilton for hers, too; wondering whether, if she sent him one, it would
  help or hurt. This idea was promptly dismissed as impracticable; a bit silly,
  indeed, in view of their short acquaintance and the improbability of their
  meeting again. For soft sentimentality this thought&mdash;he felt, on sober
  reflection&mdash;should be given some sort of prize. Tubby should be called
  in to make the award.</p>

  <p>Undeniably, this rigging up of Jack Beaven's new establishment had
  slightly mellowed him. He was becoming domesticated. Within ten days he was
  living at the new address, realizing that there was something at once amusing
  and pathetic about his proprietary pride as he moved about among his
  possessions, trying out the big leather chairs and the over-stuffed
  davenport; and wondering, as he sat at his large desk (he had ordered some
  very good-looking social stationery), who, besides Jean, he might write to.
  Tony Wollason, quietly growing leaner and shabbier in a little rat-hole of a
  town in Wyoming, was surprised a week later to have a chatty reply to his
  Christmas greetings. Bugs Cartmell, flat-footing for the Health Officer of
  Peoria, was likewise amazed to discover that his former fellow-lodger at Mrs
  Doyle's remembered his existence. Jack also began a few letters addressed
  respectively to Miss Hilton, Miss Audrey Hilton, Audrey, and Lan Ying,
  tearing them into small, precise squares and tossing them into a very
  handsome waste-basket lined with metal and bound in tan leather to match the
  new desk.</p>

  <p>Transportation facilities between the hospital and the apartment being
  found sluggish and unreliable, Jack presently resolved to buy a car. In a few
  days a modish maroon roadster was assigned a private stall in the parking-lot
  at the rear of the hospital. A freshly lettered card, affixed to the low
  railing in front of the stall, said&mdash;DOCTOR BEAVEN. This, he felt, was
  the most convincing certificate he had received, accrediting his arrival as a
  seasoned and recognized member of the medical profession. His appointment to
  the faculty had afforded him a new self-confidence; his acquirement of a home
  of his own had given him a feeling of permanence and stability. But his name,
  printed in the same-sized black letters as the neighbouring names of
  Forrester, Shane, McCormack, Osgood, and a dozen more&mdash;all of them his
  seniors&mdash;had a curious effect upon him, deepening his resolve to give
  the profession that had so early and generously rewarded him for his
  single-hearted zeal a reconsecrated fidelity to prove that the honour had not
  been too unworthily bestowed. The car may have been an extravagance, but the
  name on the railing was a stimulating challenge.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was in the last week of August that the incident occurred which drove a
  new wedge between Jack and Tubby. Had anyone else but Dr Forrester been
  caught in the ridiculous situation into which Jack had come involuntarily,
  the matter would have been dismissed with a laugh. But the great man's pride
  was badly injured. He had been surprised in the act of displaying a softness
  of heart; and Beaven, of all people, had witnessed it. The person most to
  blame for the unfortunate affair was the Prentiss baby.</p>

  <p>The recovery of Nancy Prentiss was one of the major achievements of Tubby
  Forrester's career. Cervical injuries always registered a very high mortality
  rate, and Nancy had been so badly hurt that for three days after she had been
  brought into the hospital everybody&mdash;including Tubby&mdash;agreed it
  would be more humane to let her die in peace than to subject her to an
  inevitably futile mauling.</p>

  <p>But when she refused to confirm the general prediction, Tubby&mdash;who
  had popped in, every two hours, to inspect her chart&mdash;began toying with
  the thought of attempting an operation. Not in the memory of the eldest nurse
  had Tubby seemed so indecisive. He would stand by Nancy's bed, tapping his
  gold pince-nez against his teeth, his gimlety little eyes narrowed to mere
  slits; then he would utter a snort that had the value of&mdash;"Certainly
  not! Nonsense! Silly!"&mdash;and leave the room, to return shortly and go
  into another trance.</p>

  <p>At eight o'clock on the morning of the fifth day, Tubby impulsively
  growled, "Get her ready! Up she goes!"</p>

  <p>The case attracted wide attention. A flood of gaudy and unwelcome
  newspaper publicity, keenly embarrassing to the noted neurologist, spread
  tidings of the "miracle" he had wrought. Hundreds of wistful inquiries poured
  in from relatives of incurables and inoperables who seemed to be under the
  impression that the University Hospital had gone into competition with
  Lourdes or Sainte Anne de Beaupré.</p>

  <p>To Tubby's credit it was observed that while he made short work of the
  excited sensationalists who sought interviews, he was unusually dutiful in
  replying to the voluminous correspondence which their noisy dispatches had
  stirred up, and did his utmost to put himself and the hospital right with
  these people who sought more aid than he or any other man could hope to
  deliver.</p>

  <p>But, however much the press reports had exaggerated the story, the fact
  remained that Tubby had saved the young woman's life when the chances of her
  survival or her death were related&mdash;according to medical annals&mdash;as
  one is related to three hundred and ten. Professional journals gave generous
  space to the case-history and the technique employed, a score of surgeons
  specializing in neurological surgery visited the patient, the whole hospital
  was proud as a peacock, and Tubby's habitual scowl gave way to intermittent
  flashes of good-nature, almost as rare as the operation he had performed.</p>

  <p>From the very first, Tubby's relation to Nancy Prentiss would have made a
  dog laugh. It might have been unfair to speak of Nancy as scum; for
  scum&mdash;especially in laboratory experiments&mdash;occasionally had
  considerable significance and value. The girl had had about as little mental
  or moral discipline as could be imagined of any person living in a civilized
  community, and had not been provided with the emotional stability demanded by
  so long a grind of tedium and discomfort as her convalescence required. It
  was a case where the post-operative care was of the highest importance.
  Nobody but Tubby could do anything with her.</p>

  <p>She was an impudent and wilful little rascal with a vocabulary of
  invectives that would have paled the cheek of an inebriated sailor. For
  unalloyed brass and impertinence, Nancy had probably never met a rival worthy
  of her talents until she collided with Tubby Forrester. Having capitulated
  with the humble concession that she had never known anyone so mean and tough,
  Nancy became Tubby's devoted slave and beamed on him with the fascinated eyes
  of an obedient collie.</p>

  <p>Under the peculiar circumstances, Tubby became Nancy's slave, too. The
  whole hospital was aware of Tubby's predicament and rejoiced in it. He was
  called at all hours to deal with Nancy's tantrums. On these occasions the
  amenities they exchanged were so forthright that the nurses left the room.
  Tubby had given his patient to understand, at the outset, that it was of no
  personal concern to him whether she lived or died, except for the single fact
  that he wanted to demonstrate the success of the surgical technique he had
  employed. Nobody had ever been quite that honest with Nancy before. One day
  she had had a rather mellow moment in which she confided a good deal of her
  brief but exciting past, and Tubby agreed with her that it would be no great
  loss to the social order if she failed to recover.</p>

  <p>"In fact," he added, judicially, "I suppose it is an immoral act on my
  part to prolong your life. You are no good, Nancy, and I see no excuse for
  your living at all. But I'll tell you this: if you let me down, by refusing
  to get well, I'll&mdash;I'll never speak to you again!"</p>

  <p>And so&mdash;the indestructible Nancy had got well enough to be taken to
  her mother's frowsy little cottage on the outskirts of town, after two months
  of gruelling immobility, lying on her face, imprisoned by bandages and
  pillows as inflexible as sandbags.</p>

  <p>Several times daily, during her last two weeks at the hospital, Tubby was
  sent for to keep her from spoiling the whole thing. Toward the last, as her
  returning strength increased her restlessness and exasperation over the
  confinement, the nurses did not elaborate on the nature of the call when they
  telephoned to Tubby. They just said, "Nancy," and Tubby said, "Coming."</p>

  <p>Sometimes he swore at her most horribly, and it was said that once in a
  fine frenzy he called her by a very unpleasant&mdash;albeit by no means
  misapplied&mdash;name, upon receipt of which she called him a stuck-up,
  pig-eyed, little pennyfeist, an appellation undeniably impolite but&mdash;in
  the opinion of many who heard about the affair&mdash;approximately correct.
  When savagery was of no avail, Tubby would soothe her with rash promises. On
  these occasions she badgered him into pledges of favours to be rendered when
  and if she ever got out of this damn' plaster cast. It was often wondered to
  what extent Tubby would endeavour to keep his word.</p>

  <p>One afternoon in August an emergency case came into the hospital which
  clearly called for Tubby's good judgment. A painter had fallen from a
  scaffolding, and there had been a dislocation of the twelfth thoracic
  vertebra. Having studied the X-ray plate, Jack Beaven found the cord slightly
  injured. Preferring that Tubby should see the picture before anything was
  done, a general search for him was instituted without success. Then somebody
  remembered that he had been going down every afternoon to see Nancy Prentiss,
  who had no telephone.</p>

  <p>Jack drove to the house. The front door was open. He was about to rap on
  it when he heard Nancy's metallic voice issuing from a room adjacent to the
  little sitting-room at the door of which he waited with startled eyes.</p>

  <p>"C'mout o' there, damn yuh! I see yuh, a-crouchin' behind that there
  tractor! Up with 'em, now, er I'll blow yer head off!"</p>

  <p>Nancy's enunciation was slightly impaired, leading to the suspicion that
  she had been gagged. Jack opened the screen and walked in, crossed the
  living-room, and stood in the doorway. With her yellow hair done up in
  curl-papers, and her jaws kneading an incredibly large mouthful of chewing
  gum, Nancy was reading aloud a western shocker. She was flat on her back in
  bed, her knees drawn up to lend support to the magazine. She glanced up,
  grinned, and said, "Hello, little one. Looking for your papa?" Nancy pointed
  impishly to a corner of the room not yet in Jack's view. He stepped through
  the doorway and halted, unbelieving.</p>

  <p>By the window, in an old-fashioned, ramshackle rocking-chair, sat Tubby
  holding Nancy's baby in his arms, with one hand steadying a tilted bottle.
  The impromptu nurse glanced up and glared at the intruder murderously. Jack's
  amazement at the sight quickly gave way to an outburst of laughter. He could
  no more have controlled it than his heart-beats.</p>

  <p>"Smatter?" demanded Nancy, vigorously agitating her gum. "Didn'cha ever
  see anybody feed a baby before?" But this comment failed to have a steadying
  effect on Jack. He couldn't stop laughing.</p>

  <p>"Get out!" roared Tubby, his voice cracking a little with fury. Jack was
  suddenly sobered. Tubby seemed about to be threatened with a stroke. Nobody
  had ever been that mad before.</p>

  <p>"You're wanted at the hospital," he said, retreating.</p>

  <p>"Get out!" screamed Tubby.</p>

  <p>And Jack got out. After that, their relation&mdash;at no time
  amicable&mdash;was so strained that the hospital noticed it. In the
  operating-room, Tubby would say to the Warren girl, "Tell Dr Beaven to do
  this suture." And Jack, at Tubby's elbow, would comply. Merely to say that
  they despised each other was to have said nothing whatsoever about it.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Dr Shane had hinted that he would like to see the new diggings. More than
  ready to comply, for the apartment was still a novelty and he was anxious to
  show it to his friend, Jack drove him over there after having luncheon with
  him down town.</p>

  <p>"Beaven, if I were you," said Shane, settling himself comfortably into a
  big tan-leather chair and fumbling in his tobacco-pouch, "I would ask for a
  couple of weeks off before the new term opens."</p>

  <p>"So? I hadn't felt the need of a vacation."</p>

  <p>"Well," drawled Shane, nodding his head sagely, "you'd better. Far back as
  I can recall, you have had no time off; at least not since you began working
  with Forrester. And you needn't tell me that working with Forrester is any
  fun. It's no secret that you and Tubby are in each other's hair."</p>

  <p>Jack laughed dryly and minimized the ruction with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"We understand each other," he said. "Dr Forrester's bark is worse than
  his bite."</p>

  <p>"Maybe so&mdash;but I'd rather be bit, once in a while, than barked at all
  the time. I know you admire Tubby's skill, and so do I. But he's hard to get
  along with. He's wearing to the nerves. Anybody who has to see as much of him
  as you do should have a leave of absence occasionally. If it was me, I'd want
  to be away about eight months out of twelve."</p>

  <p>Jack loyally mumbled something about Tubby's not being so bad, really;
  and, as for a vacation, he wouldn't know what to do with one if he had
  it.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly!" said Shane. "A few days away from the grind will do
  wonders for you. Change of air, change of scenery. You're not quite up to
  par, you know. I watched you to-day, stirring things around with your fork
  and not eating anything. You've been glum as a clam lately. Maybe somebody or
  something has been getting your goat. I don't know. And, anyway, it's none of
  my business. But you'd better not start in on your new faculty job with your
  tail dragging. I'm telling you this for your own good; same as if I was your
  uncle."</p>

  <p>Jack shook his head and lamely repeated that he wouldn't know where to go
  or what to do.</p>

  <p>"Thunderation!" shouted Shane, pointing in the wrong direction with his
  pipe. "Any number of things to do! Take a boat trip up the Great Lakes. Toss
  a few mystery stories or some such tripe into a bag and go on a cruise for a
  couple of weeks. Come back fit as a fiddle. Brown as a bun. Full of zip. Why
  not go fishing? Like to fish?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether I do or not. Probably not. Never did&mdash;except
  for grubby perch and blue-gills when I was a youngster."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;it's about time you learned. Best diversion there is. If you
  want to stop thinking, try fishing. Get out in a flat-bottomed boat with some
  old guy who doesn't know what your occupation is and couldn't talk about it
  with any intelligence if he did know. Live out in the open, broiling your own
  catch, and fighting deer-flies. Spend the evening reading detective stories.
  Give your mind a complete rest. Better think that over."</p>

  <p>The idea wasn't half bad. The past few days had been unusually trying.
  Tubby had been impossible. The weather had been depressing. Jack had never
  been quite so lonesome. The new living quarters had solved a few small
  problems but had presented a new one. It was going to be a great treat to get
  out of the crowded and noisy Hospital Annexe where there was no privacy at
  all. You could live like a gentleman. Nobody would borrow your last shirt or
  swipe your razor blades or come in singing "Sweet Adeline" when you were
  short on sleep. But, it was a radical change to move out of all this
  confusion into the quiet of the new apartment. Lonesome? You woke up in the
  night, roused by the silence. The silence wasn't merely the absence of
  racket. The silence was positive. Perhaps you needed a cat or a dog or a
  geranium; something alive. Now that you had a new home, you wanted something
  to share it with you. And then you would get to thinking along that line.
  Presently you would arrive at the thought that needed to be pitched out of
  your mind, pretty soon, if you didn't want to go crazy; a monstrously silly
  idea it was, too, for it was very doubtful if she had given you a second
  thought. The telephone had rung, and you had answered it and said "Good
  night" and left the room, and that was all. She had handed you your hat and
  looked up into your eyes, very soberly, and said, "Sor-ree." And that was
  all. And that was enough. And that ought to be the end of it.</p>

  <p>But Shane's suggestion was worth considering; so he milled it for several
  hours and asked for a two-weeks' leave. The request was granted without a
  word of debate.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Dr Osgood. "Quite proper. Hope you have a good time.
  Leave your address at the office, so we will know how to reach you."</p>

  <p>Jack felt puzzled and not a little chagrined. It would be most ungracious
  not to tell Osgood where he was going, and he disliked to confess that he had
  no plans.</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd go fishing," he said, impulsively.</p>

  <p>"Excellent. Up north, I suppose."</p>

  <p>Jack nodded, wondering whether "north" meant some particular river or lake
  that the fishermen knew about, or extended on to the pole.</p>

  <p>"Cunningham writes me there's some fine bass fishing now in Spruce Lake,
  only an hour's drive for him. Wanted me to come up, but I can't get away just
  now. He would be glad to have you come, I know."</p>

  <p>Jack meditated a reply with averted eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that would be an imposition," he said, reluctantly. "I do not
  know Dr Cunningham."</p>

  <p>Osgood waved the objection aside with a flick of his hand.</p>

  <p>"That wouldn't make the slightest difference. Cunningham is a grand
  fellow. He will enjoy having you. And, as for knowing him, he was much
  pleased over your attentions to the King child. Forrester told him the
  operation was mainly your job."</p>

  <p>Jack's eyes widened a little, but he shook his head resolutely. It was a
  great temptation. It would give him a chance to see Audrey Hilton. But was
  that good sense? It was costing him a lot of earnest will-power to barricade
  his mind against this girl. He'd better stick to his guns. Besides, it
  wouldn't be very good cricket to accept Cunningham's intimate friendship and
  hospitality, considering how little respect he had for him
  professionally.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Doctor," he replied, firmly, "but it's quite too much to ask of
  Cunningham. I wouldn't feel comfortable about it."</p>

  <p>"Very well." Osgood turned away to attend to the queries of a waiting
  nurse, and Jack set out on his morning's duties in the wards. He had turned
  down a golden opportunity to do the thing he very much desired, but he had
  demonstrated his ability to make that sacrifice. His self-satisfaction
  squared his shoulders. He had himself well in hand, he reflected proudly.</p>

  <p>At noon, as he was leaving the hospital, Osgood summoned him into his
  office. Osgood's face was beaming with an enigmatic grin. He handed Jack a
  telegram. It was from Cunningham.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">VERY HAPPY INDEED TO EXTEND INVITATION TO BEAVEN FOR
  FISHING EXCURSION TELL HIM TO WIRE ME WHAT DAY HE IS COMING</p><br>

  <p>Jack read the message through twice before looking up. His face was
  troubled.</p>

  <p>"Mighty good of you&mdash;both," he admitted, slowly, "but I don't see how
  I can do that."</p>

  <p>Osgood chuckled boyishly.</p>

  <p>"I don't see how you can do anything else," he declared. "It's all
  arranged for you. You can't wire Cunningham that you don't want to come."</p>

  <p>"That's true," said Jack. He was thoughtful for a long moment.
  "Well&mdash;thanks... I'll go."</p>

  <p>Now that the decision had been made for him, he felt he had an adequate
  alibi to offer his conscience. He grinned dryly at remembrance of the droll
  yarn about the good Catholic who, on a Friday, having called for shark,
  whale, and octopus, without results, had reluctantly taken roast beef. In an
  almost hilarious mood, he hurried away to the laboratory to inspect his
  cultures. He was going to see Audrey! Through no fault of his, the matter had
  been determined for him. He had done his best to avoid this temptation.
  Certainly he had played fair with his conscience. Heaven knew he had "asked
  for fish".</p>

  <p>There was an operation at one. He whistled a few bars of "Sweet Rosie
  O'Grady" while scrubbing up. Tubby, at an adjacent basin, scowled at him and
  he grinned amiably.</p>

  <p>"Losing your mind?" asked Tubby, anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, <i>sir!"</i> boasted Jack, recklessly.</p>

  <p>"It's the heat," declared Tubby.</p>

  <p>"It's the humidity!" amended Jack, vigorously scouring his fingers. "Good
  old humidity! Makes things grow! Yes, s-i-r!"</p>

  <p>"You'd better pipe down," muttered the Warren girl, holding up his
  surgical gown. "He'll think you're drunk. Maybe you are. You certainly act
  like it." She moved almost into his arms and sniffed him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I'm going fishing," he whispered, impressively.</p>

  <p>"You're going crazy," she replied, tying his tapes.</p>

  <p>"That'll make it unanimous," he said. "We'll all be crazy."</p>

  <p>Late that afternoon, Jack drove down town to outfit himself for the
  expedition. It was a very disconcerting experience. The young man behind the
  counter in the sporting-goods store was at once misled about his unidentified
  customer.</p>

  <p>"I want to look at some fishing equipment," said the customer.</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir. What did you have in mind? Where are you fishing?"</p>

  <p>Jack jerked his head in a general northerly direction and said,
  "Oh&mdash;up state."</p>

  <p>"You'll probably be looking for muskies."</p>

  <p>"Probably." Jack didn't know what muskies were but if they were fish
  indigenous to northern lakes&mdash;which seemed a reasonable
  deduction&mdash;he would probably be looking for them.</p>

  <p>"And bass," added the clerk. "Of course you have your rods." This was said
  in a tone implying that if a prospective customer didn't even have his rods
  he had no business here, at all.</p>

  <p>"Of course," replied Jack, coldly, a bit irritated over the insinuation.
  The fellow had said "rods". What would you do with more than one rod? One for
  muskies, probably; one for bass, one for sharks.</p>

  <p>"Reels in good order?"</p>

  <p>Jack nodded. It was apparent that reels were temperamental.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you want lines, leads, spoons, flies; eh?" The clerk turned to
  push the sliding-door of a tall glass case. "Here you are, sir. If you'll
  step around the counter, you may look 'em over."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I've left my car parked a little too close to a fire-plug,"
  said Jack. "Excuse me, please."</p>

  <p>As he drove away, there swept over him a feeling of mortification, not
  induced entirely by this episode. He was realizing how very little he knew of
  the sports and pastimes which constituted so large an area of almost every
  normal man's life. Other men could tell you the standing of all the clubs in
  the Big Leagues, knew what was par on every hole on every course within a
  radius of twenty miles, knew the names of hockey players; knew where to fish
  and when&mdash;and what to take along. He didn't know anything. He scowled
  darkly as he drove into the tight garage. He didn't know anything about
  anything that men were interested in. Perhaps he'd better wait for the
  fishing tackle; make a clean breast of it to Cunningham.</p>

  <p>He decided that he would drive up on Friday. With an early start he could
  do it nicely in a day. Putting through a toll-call he informed Dr Cunningham
  of his plans, thanked him for his generosity, and said that he would go to
  the Roscommon Hotel, upon arrival. Cunningham, boisterously genial, would
  have none of that. "No, sir. Coming directly to my house! The lady may want
  to have a few friends in for dinner. You try to get here by six-thirty. Next
  morning we'll go out to the lake."</p>

  <p>The two intervening days were tiresomely long. He had made a wise decision
  about the vacation. Needed to be out of doors. Needed to inspect the strange
  mind of this generous fellow, Cunningham. Needed to have one more glimpse of
  Audrey Hilton before he put her permanently out of his thoughts. Of course
  Cunningham would expect him to call on Teddy and his family. No more than
  common courtesy to do that. Even tough old Tubby Forrester would have wanted
  to pay his respects to a patient under similar circumstances.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The drive was delightful. It was the first long trip that Jack had taken
  alone. The top of the roadster had been let down, transforming it into quite
  another type of vehicle. The whole out-of-doors was yours. The car skimmed
  along, more like a speedboat than a thing on wheels. The dawn breeze swept
  by, cool, invigorating. The sky was streaked with pink. One's nostrils
  dilated eagerly to inhale the early morning earthy smell of dewy grass, moist
  soil, the pungent aromatics of pine and balsam. There was a whirr of wings as
  the swift car flushed a covey of quail at the rounding curve that rimmed a
  pond strewn with white water-lilies. Country-dawn sounds combined to produce
  a symphony that Jack had not heard since he was a boy; the creak of a
  wind-pump, the bleat of sheep, the crowing of roosters, the lowing of cattle,
  fugitive bits of arias offered by meadow-larks.</p>

  <p>The effect of it all was exhilarating, intoxicating. Jack was amazed to
  find his mind reacting to the swift rush of the morning wind, the rapidly
  shifting kaleidoscope of forms and colours as the winding road unrolled like
  a ribbon over graceful hills. His mind was free, uncensored, out on its own.
  With the reckless spirit of young Pippa on her annual day off, he wanted to
  sing and shout.</p>

  <p>The small towns were waking up now, and the broad highway was sucking
  in&mdash;from lanes and barnyards&mdash;all sorts of market-trucks and
  battered flivvers rattling toward the day's work. The sleepy road was taking
  up its burden, rousing to its responsibilities, insisting on full stops at
  junctions. Now we were coming into a big town where twenty-five miles an hour
  would be enough until we reached a sign saying twenty would be enough. Big
  factories; red brick, high iron fences, guarded gates, tall chimney stacks.
  Hundreds&mdash;thousands of men swarmed the streets, poured through the
  gateways; men in their late twenties and thirties, mostly; blue shirts open
  at the throat; stocky fellows; hold their own in a fight, no doubt; some
  tall, slim ones overtopping the stocky chaps; ought to have employment out in
  the fresh air; big, bulging, chicken-gizzardly Adam's apples, hollow chests,
  stooped shoulders, unquestionably anæmic, touch of T.B., low metabolism, red
  count down to the danger line; but&mdash;to blazes with the diagnosis.</p>

  <p>At the University, Remsen, ambitious entomologist, had rigged an ingenious
  glass house for the observation of a city of ants. Remsen wasn't quite so
  sure as Maeterlinck had been on the subject of the social behaviour of
  insects. Remsen doubted whether any intelligence was required of the
  individual. The ant's job was cut out for him to fit his sex, or the lack of
  it, his size, his structure. If the ant was leggy, he had a good deal of
  running around to do. Some of the ants worked all day in one spot. Factory
  life. One little job to do, rapidly, expertly, automatically, without
  thinking. If you stopped to think about what you were doing, you got behind,
  and the ant next to you shouted a bad name. Nice occupation. Led to mental
  decay. But all jobs were more or less like that. Jack reflected on his own
  duties. Not much difference between a work-bench and an operating-table.
  Surgeon had cleaner hands, cleaner tools, but was just a mechanic, after
  all.</p>

  <p>Presently he was out of the swarm of ants, ants making automobiles, and
  was increasing speed in frowsy suburbs, accelerating to pass long, lumbersome
  vans piled high with new cars, worse than mere road-hogs; road-hippopotami.
  There was very little of the pastoral now. Towns were coming fast and ugly.
  By noon Jack was passing through a district largely devoted to the milling of
  lumber. Enormous stacks of it waited to be shipped in the hulking freighters
  moored at great wharves. He turned off the highway and on to a cobbled street
  to have a better look. Heavy chains rattled over enormous pulleys, long
  cranes swept quarter-circles with precarious loads of sawed pine and lowered
  the burden into the big square hole, returning almost instantly with twisted
  cables dangling, sprawling steel fingers stretching out for another handful
  of yellow lumber. The boat didn't care; wasn't affected in any way by the
  threat of more work to do; just sat there and let the lazy sailors smear red
  paint on her rusty belly, and the fussy windlasses feed more lumber into her
  capacious maw; indifferent as a cow chewing her cud while they milked her. It
  might be fun to sail in one of these unhurried old tubs. You could escape
  from all drudgeries and cares for a few months. What would that do to you?
  Would you come back refreshed and ready for duty? Refreshed, maybe (may-bee),
  but probably not ready for duty. It might cure you permanently of any desire
  for work. No&mdash;a breathing spell of a week or two would be better. You
  must not delay your return to the other ants, or they might declare you
  dead&mdash;or a deserter.</p>

  <p>So&mdash;he got to thinking about sociology, as he drove on and regained
  the highway a half-mile farther. Very foolish for people to talk about
  "Social Science". Science was a laboratory pursuit. If you were going to be
  scientific you had to work by fixed rules and with instruments of precision.
  "Social Science"&mdash;indeed! Of course you could call anything a science if
  you didn't care how you abused the word. Science of barbering. Science of
  chicken-raising. Science of lawn-mowing. Plenty of people hoping to dignify
  their petty crafts by attaching "science" to them. Take "Political Science":
  with no two students agreed about where it had come from, whither it was
  bound, or what it was good for. "Science of Ethnology": about as practical as
  trying to tie up a sand-dune with a clothes-line; study of the "character of
  races"&mdash;nonsense. Let an invading nation come in and sit down on a race
  for a couple of generations, and their own grandmothers wouldn't recognize
  'em. What would it do to an American girl if she had lived from her infancy
  in Hong Kong?</p>

  <p>You couldn't make a "science" out of sociology. Why couldn't you? You
  couldn't diagnose and treat the social behaviour of human ants. Why not?
  Maybe you could put them through a clinic, one by one. You could say to this
  fellow, "We've gone over your case with care, Mr Beaven, and recommend a
  two-years' voyage on a lumber-boat. It's going to China. China would be good
  for you. Cure your restlessness. The Chinese are well balanced. They do not
  fret."</p>

  <p>Never in his life had Jack's mind rambled, scuttled, galloped,
  somersaulted over such a wide variety of problems. The new scenes, the
  release from duty, the rush of wind conspired to produce a pleasant ungirding
  of the brain. Perhaps it was healthful to let your thoughts loose,
  occasionally; relieve the tension of responsibility; let your mental belt out
  a few holes. Maybe the mind needed intervals of rest. Even a setting hen had
  sense enough to let her eggs cool off, for a half-hour every day.</p>

  <p>At five o'clock he stopped in a village and telephoned Dr Cunningham that
  he would arrive at six; sauntered back to his car, paid for the fresh tankful
  of gas, and pushed on. Cunningham had been more than cordial. Jack was
  anticipating the visit with mounting interest. It would be the first night he
  had spent in a private home for thirteen years. The speedometer again crept
  up to sixty. Cunningham had said something about dinner guests to-night. He
  didn't say who. A couple of doctors, maybe; and their wives. Silly thought,
  no doubt, but not beyond possibility that they might ask Mrs King and Miss
  Hilton. Audrey. Very pretty name. Very good road. Sixty-five. Sixty-eight.
  Lan Ying. Absurdly sweet little toy name&mdash;Lan Ying. Seventy.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT had been a morning of surprises. Dr Cunningham had upset
  the theory that you couldn't mix science and sentiment.</p>

  <p>As he sat in Cunningham's hard-used sedan at the main entrance to Mercy
  Hospital waiting his host's return, it occurred to Jack Beaven that he would
  have to abandon his prejudices on this subject.</p>

  <p>Under Tubby Forrester's influence, Jack had contrived a mental portrait of
  the typical family physician of the better sort who endeavours to treat a
  wide variety of cases. He had pictured Cunningham as a fair example.</p>

  <p>Cunningham, he felt, was worthy of respect as a general practitioner who,
  for lack of time and the necessary instruments of research, could hardly be
  expected to keep himself informed on contemporary discoveries or the latest
  techniques employed by explorers in the field of medicine and surgery.</p>

  <p>Tubby's urgent insistence upon scholarship and "the scientific attitude"
  had been carried to the point of sneering snobbery, Jack thought. There was a
  rightful place in society for the family doctor. Obviously this busy man was
  no scientist. No matter what fine intentions he may have had, during his
  early days, his diversified duties in homes and hospitals would make it
  impossible for him to continue his studies. Gradually,
  inevitably&mdash;perhaps regretfully&mdash;the hard-pressed fellow would slip
  farther and farther behind in his scientific interests until he not only
  failed to make any progress but was inclined&mdash;for reasons of sheer
  self-defence&mdash;to adopt an attitude of derision toward the new-fangled
  crotchets of the experts. Jack had expected to find Cunningham exemplifying
  this state of mind.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that he entertained any top-lofty ideas about his own
  superiority to Cunningham. He could understand this man's difficult position.
  Under similar circumstances, he would unquestionably pursue the same course.
  The family doctor, visiting&mdash;in one day's rounds&mdash;a broken hip, an
  incipient T.B., a chronic arthritis, a benign cyst (that he nervously hoped
  wasn't going to be malignant), a cerebral hæmorrhage, an aneurism, a
  pernicious anæmia, a carbuncle, an ingrowing toe-nail, a chicken pox, and a
  carcinoma&mdash;shouldn't be asked to engage in scholarly research.</p>

  <p>It was exactly as if some Jack of all trades who had spent the day going
  about from place to place successively performing such feats as the
  readjustment of a hot-water heater, the repair of broken plastering, the
  installation of a plate-glass window, the mending of a door-lock, a
  thermostat, a lamp, a chair, a hardwood floor, a sewing-machine, a
  phonograph, should then be sneered at because he hadn't written a monograph
  on television.</p>

  <p>Jack Beaven felt that he had the proper degree of sympathy for the family
  doctor. But&mdash;down inside himself, defiant of all the extenuating
  circumstances, there was a conviction that the general practitioner was, as
  Tubby had satirically maintained, only a benevolent soother tirelessly
  scattering sedatives and sunshine, courage and quinine, aspiration and
  aspirin, love and liniment. One thing was certain: If a man was working at a
  job that demanded a constant exercise of his emotions it wouldn't be long
  before he suffered a deterioration of his intellect. Doubtless that was what
  ailed so many social workers, professional altruists, welfarers, parsons, and
  the like. The unrelenting drain on their emotional energy made it impossible
  for them to use their brains. Cunningham, of course, would be better than
  that. The fact that he had the respect of Tubby and Shane and the others at
  the Medical College was significant. However, Cunningham was a general
  practitioner. You couldn't be a general practitioner and a scientist....
  And now Cunningham had knocked this well-established theory into a cocked
  hat. Jack sat in the sedan, under the shade of a tall elm, still utterly
  bewildered over what he had seen during the past hour and a half.</p>

  <p>It had been an eventful morning. At six-thirty they had breakfasted
  together, rising early because his host had to attend to a few professional
  duties before leaving on their excursion to the lake. Mrs Cunningham had
  joined them while they were having a second cup of coffee and a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>Jack had liked her immensely from the first moment. Her effortless
  hospitality had put him at ease immediately upon his arrival. She had met him
  with the quiet amiability of a pet cousin whose trust and devotion could be
  taken for granted. He hadn't been in the house an hour until he felt they
  were long-time friends.</p>

  <p>She was, or rather had been, a typical Nordic blonde. At forty-five she
  was still pretty; a bit more roly-poly than was good for her, a bit too white
  for her florid type, but her sky-blue eyes were clear and uncommonly
  intelligent. They lighted quickly in response to drollery. They had a
  capacity for friendly teasing. They were also wise. It was doubtful if you
  could fool them very much about anything. They did not make an effort to
  impress you with their subtlety, nor were they snoopy, but&mdash;they took
  you in. You could do a pretty fair job of playing the poker-face, but you had
  a feeling that Edith Cunningham&mdash;in spite of her blandly disarming
  smile&mdash;could see right through the backs of your cards.</p>

  <p>She unwilfully conveyed the impression of having had a lot of experience
  in a close-up study of human relationships. Maybe she saw through your cards
  because it was a deck she had played with so often that each card had its own
  identifying marks. She was not obtrusively inquisitive, feeding you cues for
  inevitable confessions and watching you&mdash;with the diligence of a cat at
  a rat-hole&mdash;for some unguarded remark that might be shaken into a
  revelation of the Hyde that was secreted within your Jekyll. Not at all! It
  wasn't as if she was trying to let you know that she had already gone through
  with a ladder and a lantern and knew all about you from your first bottle to
  your last battle. There were plenty of women who made a gallant bluff at that
  sort of prescience, mistaking their victim's unhappy look for abject
  surrender when the real cause of his discomfort was a pain in the neck.</p>

  <p>There wasn't a smart-alecky drop of blood in Edith Cunningham's body. But
  you sensed, almost immediately after Audrey Hilton had come downstairs to
  join the other dinner guests, last night, that Edith was quietly saying to
  herself, "Well&mdash;what have we here? Isn't this interesting?" Audrey had
  quite taken his breath away. Nobody had ever been so lovely. No doubt he had
  stared. He had been in the library with Cunningham and young Kline and Mr
  Swanson. Mrs Cunningham appeared in the doorway and asked them to come. She
  stood beside him as Audrey&mdash;whom he had not expected&mdash;came down. He
  had tried to be collected when he greeted her. What he wanted was to throw
  his arms around her and hold her tight. Edith must have divined his wish. For
  the next time their eyes met, Jack knew she knew.</p>

  <p>Claudia King he had not liked quite so well as he had expected, maybe
  because in features and pigments she most certainly did resemble her
  incomparable sister and he didn't want anyone else in the world&mdash;not
  even a blood relative&mdash;to look like Audrey. If this was an imbecile
  thought, as he was forced to suspect, it was due to his mental turbulence. It
  was the first time anything like this had happened to him. He had had no
  opportunity to build up, through previous exposures and inoculations, any
  immunity against this strange psychosis. It was easy to locate the cause of
  his assorted mental disabilities manifested of late in his insomnia,
  restlessness, and instability. Because of his constant absorption in his
  work, he not only had failed to immunize himself against this kind of an
  attack, but it was clear to see that he had a definite anaphylaxis in regard
  to this particular girl. It was a problem in allergy.</p>

  <p>Perhaps that's what explained the apparent boredom of matrimony. A man
  went about yearning for a wife and a home. Eventually he met the one
  particular woman to whom he was allergic. Having located the exact cause of
  his general wistfulness he married her and that cured him, precisely as a
  hay-fever victim may sneeze his very brains out until it is scientifically or
  accidentally disclosed that the dust emanating from a rug&mdash;not just any
  rug, mind you, but a Shiraz rug with a pattern of hexagonal panels&mdash;will
  touch him off. Joyfully he takes a few injections of Shiraz rug-dust and
  never sneezes again.</p>

  <p>Jack Beaven had been doing a good deal of thinking about love. And since
  the only school of thought to which he was accustomed was essentially
  pathological and pathognomonic, he psyched himself up one side and down the
  other, growing more and more bewildered. Indeed he wondered if he wasn't
  getting a bit nutty. Edith Cunningham's sly grin had been very disturbing.
  What she had detected with the experienced eye of a diagnostician, any mere
  layman would presently be able to see at a glance. Perhaps the thing would
  come out on him in the form of a rash.</p>

  <p>Well&mdash;be that as it might, he didn't care for Claudia. He wondered
  what Tubby had seen in her to make him go prancing about. She was so
  feverishly animated, neurally taut as a fiddle-string, almost boisterously
  glamorous, and hard to talk to unless you put yourself at full gallop. Maybe
  that's what had done Tubby in. He was such a pompous old ass that women
  shrivelled into silence when they met him. The incandescent Claudia had
  probably caught him the way a pair of dazzling headlights will stun a
  rabbit.</p>

  <p>Considerably to Jack's satisfaction, Claudia had made short work of him
  when they met, permitting him to give himself to Audrey who offered her hand,
  looked up from beneath long lashes, and said, "She did not
  die?"&mdash;accompanying the query with that inimitable little shake of the
  head which meant she earnestly hoped the reply would be negative.</p>

  <p>"No," he had answered, "'but I found her in need of help. I was sorry
  about the interruption. You were saying&mdash;it was about Sen Ling, you
  know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I remember clearly," she replied without a trace of coquetry. "You had
  just said, to me" (how quaintly childlike her lips when she made the words
  'to me'), "'So&mdash;for most of your life&mdash;you've lived in China.
  Wouldn't you like to tell me about it?'"</p>

  <p>Jack nodded, happy that she was able (and willing) to recall the episode
  with such accuracy. He was prompt to let her know that he too had cherished a
  detailed picture of that conversation.</p>

  <p>"And you said, 'Gladly&mdash;if I am not keeping you.'"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she assisted&mdash;"and then the telephone rang and you skipped
  away."</p>

  <p>"I had to go," he declared, soberly.</p>

  <p>"I know." She regarded him with a sort of brooding smile such as she might
  have bestowed on Teddy. "You were so ver-ree serious." She pursed her lips,
  affecting sternness, knitted her brows severely beneath the adorable black
  fringe, lifted an imaginary receiver to her ear, and repeated&mdash;with
  appropriate pauses for listening, "'Yes... Yes, Miss Warren... Right
  away.'"</p>

  <p>The implications of her exact reproduction of his words had stirred him.
  He hoped his voice would not betray his happiness. Taking himself in hand, he
  tried to be casual. "You have an excellent memory, Miss Hilton; even for
  names. It was Miss Warren who called me."</p>

  <p>She shook her head with artless honesty. "No&mdash;names are ver-ree hard
  for me to remember. With us"&mdash;she turned her head slightly in the
  direction of her sister as if hopeful her voice had not carried&mdash;"with
  the Chinese," she amended, guarding her tone, "names are not so difficult.
  They always mean something."</p>

  <p>"Yours, too, I suppose," Jack had ventured.</p>

  <p>"Of course." She lowered her lashes momentarily. "You will think it
  foolish&mdash;may-bee. Chinese names are so&mdash;so fanciful."</p>

  <p>At this juncture Dr Kline, Cunningham's junior associate, had sauntered up
  to claim her as his dinner companion. Kline was a self-contained chap, but
  admiration shone in his eyes. She took his arm and gave Jack a smile over her
  shoulder as she turned. Edith Cunningham, now at his elbow, had led him into
  the dining-room, Kline and Audrey following. Mr Swanson attended the luminous
  Claudia. Cunningham and the diminutive Mrs Swanson, absurdly dwarfed
  alongside his six-feet-three, brought up the rear.</p>

  <p>Having arrived at their places, and before they sat, a little hush fell.
  No one had signalled for it. Apparently these people, having been guests here
  before, knew what was coming, for their eyes were expectantly levelled at the
  face of their host. There seemed something almost majestic about the dynamic
  fellow at that arrested moment. Bowing his white head, Cunningham
  reverentially said a Latin grace; and, without an instant's interval,
  remarked, as he drew back his chair, "I'm glad to see you're serving cold
  consommé, Edith. It's hot as the devil in here."</p>

  <p>After they were seated, Jack, who could hardly keep his amusement out of
  his voice, said, quietly, "I didn't know you were Catholics."</p>

  <p>"We aren't," drawled Edith. "That's just one of Bill's many whims. Thinks
  there ought to be some religion in the home."</p>

  <p>"But why in Latin?" asked Jack, smiling broadly.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;Bill thinks it's a little better taste to address God in a
  language you don't use for ordinary conversation."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be damned," muttered Jack, under his breath.</p>

  <p>"That's what I used to say," rejoined Edith. "But when you've known Bill
  Cunningham as long as I have, you won't be damned for anything he says or
  does. He's the most unpredictable, most inconsistent, most magnificent
  creature God ever made."</p>

  <p>Then she had gone on&mdash;with brief intervals for attention to her
  duties as hostess&mdash;to do some pithy biographical sketches of the small
  company. Ole Swanson was the third generation of his family in spruce and
  pine; very civic-minded. That's what attracted Bill to him. Parks,
  play-grounds, a small art-gallery, the municipal orchestra.</p>

  <p>"Bill's hobby&mdash;the orchestra.... Are you interested in music?"</p>

  <p>Jack had been obliged to confess that this part of his life had not been
  cultivated.</p>

  <p>"Bill thinks it's very important for a doctor to have diversions," she
  said. "Remember?&mdash;of course you don't&mdash;you were too young&mdash;but
  in the early days of X-ray the doctors used to burn their fingers. Bill says
  if you don't have some æsthetic protection as an insulation&mdash;or
  something like that&mdash;Science will burn your fingers. He says he has some
  scars that he got before he found that out."</p>

  <p>Jack knew that his face was registering astonishment. He hoped it wasn't
  registering just a trace of amusement. He guessed that Cunningham wouldn't
  have to insulate himself very heavily to avoid being damaged by Science. His
  contacts with Science were probably about as remote as the average
  congressman's relation to statesmanship. Now Edith was speaking of Kline, the
  Bostonian, who had been with them for a year. She had lowered her voice, for
  Kline was seated next to her.</p>

  <p>"It isn't important," she was saying, "for every good-looking young doctor
  to be a bachelor, but it is mighty convenient if a good-looking bachelor can
  be a doctor. When the girls pester him he has the best alibi in the world....
 I dare say you've worked that yourself, Dr Beaven&mdash;a-plenty."</p>

  <p>Jack protested that the girls had never bothered him very much, to which
  she had replied, in the dry tone of an elder sister, "Pish". He had
  considered standing his ground on this but decided it might sound silly to be
  debating her playful rejoinder. His non-committal smile had the effect of
  encouraging her to a further exploration.</p>

  <p>"Claudia King would make a grand wife for you. Never a dull moment. Always
  something going on. No long, tiresome silences, with neither of you able to
  think of anything to say."</p>

  <p>He had glanced up to interrogate her impassive face, and she laughed a
  little, doubtless at the sober perplexity she may have found in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"No," she went on, confidentially, "on second thought, I doubt if that
  would work out. Claudia is too&mdash;too dynamic. She's been managing the
  Swanson lumber mills, and Swanson, and Mrs Swanson and Effie Swanson, and
  Peter Swanson, and setting up her generator higher and higher to carry the
  load until&mdash;well&mdash;when you plug her into some quiet, pastoral
  scene, like a dinner party in a private home, she blows all the fuses out....
 You need a more serene wife&mdash;somebody like"&mdash;she made an
  elaborate pretence of casting about, and Jack thought he knew what was
  coming&mdash;"like her sister, for instance."</p>

  <p>It was a moment before Jack trusted himself to glance up. Edith's sky-blue
  eyes met him squarely&mdash;a bit solicitously, he thought. He was conscious
  of drawing a long breath.</p>

  <p>"She's the most enchanting thing I ever saw," murmured Edith, spacing her
  words. "Naive as a child; deep as the sea."</p>

  <p>Jack considered saying, "That's very interesting", but felt it would
  offend her; so he simply nodded his head. She could make what she liked of
  that.</p>

  <p>"Audrey has had a very strange life," continued Edith, shielding her
  voice. "Know about it?"</p>

  <p>"Just a little."</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything about China?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;nothing."</p>

  <p>"Better inform yourself."</p>

  <p>There was a considerable pause before he decided, almost against his will,
  to say, "Why?"</p>

  <p>She did not reply to this. When their eyes met, she lifted her brows a
  little, smiled companionably, and turned to ask Mr Swanson how the new boat
  was behaving.</p>

  <p>Kline had rather completely monopolized Audrey after dinner. Claudia had
  taken possession of Jack; first, to tell him all about Teddy, and then to
  tell him all about everything. She seemed to be on a strain. He suspected her
  of being in the early phases of an exophthalmic goitre; either that or
  cocaine, and of course it wouldn't be the latter.</p>

  <p>"And how's Dr Forrester, the old darling?" she inquired, leaning forward
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>Jack grinned in spite of himself. He'd heard Tubby called almost
  everything but never a darling.</p>

  <p>"Very well, I think, Mrs King. I haven't seen much of him, lately, except
  of course in a strictly professional way." Jack thought he might as well
  sound her out a little. "We haven't had dinner together for quite some
  time."</p>

  <p>"He talks so much of you," declared Claudia.</p>

  <p>Jack said, "So?"&mdash;mentally reserving the thing he really wanted to
  say.</p>

  <p>"I hope this isn't going to turn your head completely&mdash;which would be
  very bad for you at your age&mdash;but he told me that you were the most
  brilliant anatomist of his whole acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for telling me. I appreciate it as much as if it were
  true."</p>

  <p>"But it is true. He did say that," she insisted.</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean he wouldn't say so&mdash;though that, I'll admit, is rather
  unexpected. I meant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;you're just being modest. That, too, is a sign of
  greatness."</p>

  <p>Jack was beginning to feel himself something of an ass.</p>

  <p>"My sister likes you," said Claudia.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Jack. "I reciprocate." He didn't fancy the direction of
  the talk, fearing he might give himself away to this pair of bright eyes.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you can do something for her. Tell her she belongs right here in
  the good old U.S.A. She was brought up in China, you know, and can't forget
  it." Claudia shook her head. "Tsch! Tsch! I don't know what I'm going to do
  with her."</p>

  <p>"Do you have to do something with her?" asked Jack, a bit brazenly, he
  feared.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'm her older sister," defended Claudia. "She has no one else
  to advise her." She lowered her tone. "Dr Kline is simply mad about her. And
  she treats him as if he were her grandfather. Everywhere she goes she's a
  sensation. And she sits at home all day writing letters to China; doing it in
  Chinese, too, damn it! It exasperates me so! First thing you know, people
  will be thinking <i>I'm</i> part Chink." Her voice changed to entreaty. "Dr
  Beaven&mdash;I feel that Audrey would listen to almost anything you said to
  her. Do!&mdash;do talk her out of this!"</p>

  <p>Jack mumbled something about his not being very good at minding other
  people's business for them and feared any intervention on his part might be
  mistaken for impertinence. Then it occurred to him to champion Audrey's
  cause.</p>

  <p>"Suppose your sister does like the Chinese," he said. "Maybe the sort of
  Chinese she knows compare very favourably with the people she has met over
  here. I'm sure I don't know," he added, more conciliatory. "I never was
  there. I dare say you've been."</p>

  <p>Claudia shook her head, disdaining the thought.</p>

  <p>The Swansons were rising. Mrs Swanson was drawing her face into a smile
  that was the equivalent of a bread-and-butter letter, and Mr Swanson was
  shaking a trouser-leg loose from a garter. Jack saw a chance to have a quiet
  word with Audrey.</p>

  <p>"Before I return," he was saying, urgently, "I wonder if it wouldn't be
  possible to hear the rest of that story."</p>

  <p>Her face was doubtful.</p>

  <p>"We would like to have you call," she said. "But I mustn't talk of China.
  My sister thinks my heart is too much in China. She wishes me to
  forget&mdash;and not talk about it."</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't we take a drive?" asked Jack, a little surprised at his own
  impulsive suggestion. "Then you could tell me. Would there be any objection
  to that?"</p>

  <p>"It would be ver-ree pleasant," she agreed. "Thank you."</p>

  <p>"Dr Cunningham and I plan to come in from the lake on Monday, probably
  about noon. I could come for you at three. Would that be agreeable?"</p>

  <p>"Quite so. I shall be ready."</p>

  <p>"And you can talk about China&mdash;all you please," he promised, lowering
  his voice. "Maybe you will tell me what Lan Ying means."</p>

  <p>Audrey smiled companionably as she offered her hand.</p>

  <p>"May-bee," she said, softly.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>After breakfast, Cunningham had loaded the back seat of his sedan with
  food and tackle. He had a couple of calls to make before leaving.</p>

  <p>"You may as well go along, Jack," he said. "Then we can be on our way. My
  first stop is over on the east side."</p>

  <p>Presently they were moving rapidly through a more modest residential
  district, Cunningham chattering about the case he was going to see.</p>

  <p>"Took this child home from the hospital yesterday," he was saying.
  "Knocked down by a car. Concussion. And a lot of abrasions. For a day or two
  it looked like a pretty close thing. Family quite upset. Had 'em all on my
  hands; parents and half a dozen children; all scared because Dolly was
  unconscious."</p>

  <p>Jack wondered why they couldn't be kept out and ventured to ask the
  question.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," agreed Cunningham, "we could have kept them out. That's what
  you would do at the University Hospital. You're strictly business, down
  there. But it wasn't doing Dolly the slightest damage to have her brothers
  and sisters come in and cry over her." He was thoughtful for half a block,
  evidently organizing something he wanted to say.</p>

  <p>"Beaven," he broke forth, at length, "the medical profession has done a
  very poor job of capitalizing anxiety and grief."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I don't understand," said Jack.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;here you have the case of a family that has gone along for
  years without a major disaster. Plenty of small perplexities; making ends
  meet, losing a job, having babies, mumps, rackets with the relatives; minor
  irritations, but no heart-breaking tragedies. Husband and wife take each
  other for granted. Not much romance left. The children get on their mother's
  nerves, and she cuffs them about. This seeming the proper thing to do, they
  cuff each other. The girls are catty and jealous; the boys are surly and
  cruel. Along comes a catastrophe. Somebody in the family is seriously sick or
  injured. Instantly they discover how much they care for one another. They are
  all mellowed. The outburst of affection isn't directed at the patient
  exclusively. The parents are bound together; ties more enduring and endearing
  than the early love based largely on physical attraction. Brothers and
  sisters hold hands and speak softly. Lazy Sam runs errands cheerfully.
  Selfish Lizzie volunteers to wash the dishes."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it does have that effect on a household," agreed Jack, for
  courtesy's sake. "But where does the medical profession come in?"</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;that's the point," said Cunningham, indicating it on the
  steering-wheel with an impassive forefinger. "We're so intent on our fussy
  little programmes of hospital discipline, which I'm bound to say have been
  rigged up mostly for the personal convenience of the doctors and nurses, that
  we do nothing whatever to help the family get the benefit of their lesson. We
  do worse than that: we try to keep them from it."</p>

  <p>"A hospital without discipline would soon be in trouble, wouldn't it?"
  Jack hoped there was no irritation in his tone.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but we've made too much of that. We've been very short-sighted.
  All we're interested in is the physical therapy. Child has broken skull. Our
  job is to reduce the fracture. Never mind the family. They're not sick.
  They're none of our business. We're not even under obligations to answer
  their questions. Let 'em sit and wait in the reception room. That's what the
  reception room is for. Bah! This high-and-mighty professional attitude gripes
  me so&mdash;I can hardly contain myself."</p>

  <p>Jack pursed his lips and wished Cunningham wouldn't go any farther in his
  sentimental debauch.</p>

  <p>"Of course it's important that the patient recovers," continued
  Cunningham, trying to regain his composure. "But it's important also that the
  family has a chance to realize something on this disaster. I want them to get
  together in the sick-room and commit themselves&mdash;in the presence of one
  another&mdash;to a new devotion to their tribe. A good deal of our
  cold-blooded austerity is the nurse's fault, but she wouldn't be quite so
  high-handed if she didn't think we were approving her course. She likes to
  make 'em feel that she is a professional&mdash;and knows a lot; closes the
  door on them; hushes them down when they come in on tiptoe, wide-eyed and
  scared. The family, instead of having a chance to express its affection, is
  self-conscious, silent, embarrassed. I say to my nurses, 'Let 'em in! If mean
  little Patsy, the young bully, wants to have a touch of hysteria, and promise
  he'll never pull hair any more, let him bawl. Chances are he isn't annoying
  anybody but you.'" Cunningham chuckled. "These nurses certainly can freeze up
  a home. I tell my nurses, 'This isn't a mere job. This is a vocation.'"</p>

  <p>Jack felt that he had never heard such an unabashed defence of what Tubby
  had so often and so sourly condemned as "sloppy sentiment". He was both
  amazed and disappointed. Cunningham had been spoken of as a sound workman.
  They'd even asked him to join the faculty! What a mess he'd stir up. The
  school would soon be a laughing-stock. But&mdash;he wouldn't debate the
  matter. Cunningham was his senior and his host. He hoped there wouldn't be
  any more talk on this subject. Presently they drew up in front of a rather
  battered house, the bare spots in the dooryard testifying to hard usage.</p>

  <p>"Come along in," said Cunningham. "I'm going to give you a treat; glimpse
  of the old family doc in his natural habitat." He laughed boyishly. "I've
  often wished I could take Tubby around with me for a day, the old
  hypocrite."</p>

  <p>"Hypocrite?" echoed Jack.</p>

  <p>"Sure!" drawled Cunningham. "Pretends to be an iceberg; pretends his heart
  is nothing but a syringe: he may be able to spoof you fellows at the
  University, but I know more about Tubby's soft insides than he does
  himself."</p>

  <p>Jack, not knowing what rejoinder to make, grinned and said nothing. Some
  of the family had sighted the car at the curb, and the children came swarming
  out of the house.</p>

  <p>"Just look at 'em." Cunningham turned off the ignition, and chuckled with
  amusement over the bewildered stare on Jack's face. The youngsters were
  climbing on to the running-boards, all talking at once. Dolly, they shrilled,
  was sitting up. Dolly was eating her breakfast. Dolly had a new pup&mdash;the
  darlingest little pup that Daddy had got for her. They'd all given her
  presents.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, get away&mdash;about a dozen of you&mdash;so I can open the
  door!" shouted Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"I got her some dishes," yelled Jimmie, "at the ten-cent store."</p>

  <p>Jack followed along, feeling a bit out of it. Rather undignified, he
  thought, Cunningham's free and easy manner with these children. They had no
  more respect for him than they might have had for the ice-cream vendor.</p>

  <p>They entered the house. The woman met them. She was frowsy, shapeless, and
  needed a lot of dental attention, but the smile she gave Bill Cunningham was
  very tender; almost reverential.</p>

  <p>"Mrs Timmons," said Cunningham, "this is my friend, Dr Beaven."</p>

  <p>She wiped a damp hand on her brown apron and gave it to Jack tentatively,
  glancing at Cunningham with anxiety in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"No, no, no, Mrs Timmons," he said, reassuringly. "There's nothing the
  matter. Dr Beaven is not here for a consultation. We're going fishing."</p>

  <p>She smiled, happily relieved. Her attitude was puzzling. Cunningham had
  pretended she was alarmed for fear it was thought that Dolly needed a
  specialist. Jack wondered if she wasn't afraid of him. Maybe it showed in his
  face that he wasn't quite in sympathy with all this informality.
  Well&mdash;Cunningham could get whatever satisfaction he might out of this
  kind of idolatry. As for himself he preferred a more professional demeanour.
  By the Cunningham technique, you probably lost in respect and disciplinary
  authority all that you gained in palaver and devotion.</p>

  <p>They all went in together to see Dolly, who reached up her arms.
  Cunningham allowed himself to be hugged. He made a brief examination, had a
  quick, quiet conference with the nurse, sat down in a creaking old chair, and
  said, "I've brought Dr Beaven out to hear you say your catechism." The
  children drew closer about him and grew suddenly quiet. It was evident that
  they knew what was coming. Cunningham had put them through this quiz before,
  and they were anxious to prove that they remembered the right answers.</p>

  <p>"If Dolly hadn't got well, what would have happened to the rest of you?"
  asked the doctor, solemnly.</p>

  <p>"We would never have been happy any more," they replied, practically in
  unision.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;now you're all going to be happy?"</p>

  <p>A chorus of assent.</p>

  <p>"Always?"</p>

  <p>"Always."</p>

  <p>"No quarrelling?"</p>

  <p>"No quarrelling."</p>

  <p>"Cross your heart?"</p>

  <p>They crossed their hearts&mdash;and hoped to die.</p>

  <p>"That's all, then," said Cunningham. "Meeting's out." He disentangled
  himself from the miniature mob and led the way to the car, accompanied by his
  noisy constituency.</p>

  <p>"Dolly doesn't know it," said Cunningham, when they were in motion again,
  "but her whack on the head has been worth a good deal to this family. They
  were the damnedest lot of little ruffians."</p>

  <p>It was pretty dreadful&mdash;this exhibition of mawkishness. Jack tried to
  think of something pleasant to say about it, but the words wouldn't come. He
  was willing to concede that it was good for the Timmons family to stop
  wrangling, but it wasn't the doctor's business to attend to it. Maybe their
  plumbing was out of order, but it wasn't the doctor's business to fix it.
  Maybe their roof leaked. Maybe a payment was due on the mortgage. It would be
  nice if all their affairs were put in order&mdash;but the doctor shouldn't
  try to do it. While he was giving himself up to these unprofessional services
  he was becoming less and less a man of science. Couldn't do
  everything&mdash;so science would have to be neglected. Tubby was right!</p>

  <p>"Got to stop at my office a minute, Jack," said Cunningham, as they swung
  into a busy street. "Want to come up with me?"</p>

  <p>Jack assented, naturally, but he would have preferred to wait below. He
  had no curiosity to see that office. He could easily picture it; a reception
  room, a nurse-secretary, a private cubicle with a desk and an adjustable
  chair for examinations and a glass case of instruments for minor repairs;
  perhaps another little coop with a cot.</p>

  <p>They had drawn up in the parking-lot at the rear of a fifteen-storey
  modern building. They took the elevator to the top floor. In the carpeted
  corridor there was a desk and a girl in a white uniform. Jack thought it odd
  that Cunningham's secretary was holding forth in the hall. Maybe she served
  as general secretary for a dozen doctors. It was immediately apparent that
  the girl was in Cunningham's service exclusively. His offices comprised the
  whole top floor!</p>

  <p>"Come back to the laboratory, Beaven," he said. "I've a bit of an
  experiment I want you to look at before we go."</p>

  <p>"You have your own laboratory?" Jack was puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Hell, yes," called his host, over his shoulder, as he led the way down
  the hall. "Think I was just a pill-pedlar?"</p>

  <p>He opened the door, and they stepped into a spacious room equipped with
  the latest gadgets for pathological research.</p>

  <p>"I've been doing a little independent investigation of interstitial
  pneumonia," said Cunningham. "I got some nice smears yesterday. Stone mason.
  We have a lot of dusty, abrasive jobs in this country. Take a peek into that
  microscope, Beaven."</p>

  <p>Jack bewilderedly tossed aside his straw hat and went to the table by the
  north window. The microscope was a Beck binocular! He adjusted the delicate
  mechanism of the eye-pieces, and concentrated his attention on the tiny
  burnt-sienna smear.</p>

  <p>"That's the best specimen I've had," said Cunningham, at his elbow.</p>

  <p>Feeling so small that he thought it would be more appropriate if he were
  at the other end of the microscope, Jack studied the infinitesimal but very
  significant object for a long moment. His thoughts were divided. He wished he
  could ask Cunningham's pardon for the injustice he had done him. Cunningham
  wouldn't want that. It would make their relations very awkward.</p>

  <p>"Made your count yet&mdash;leucocytes?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and that reminds me I must give these notes to the girl to
  transcribe." Cunningham gathered up a handful of pencil-written sheets from
  the table. "Made 'em last night when she wasn't here."</p>

  <p>Jack, still intent on the smear, repeated, as from a considerable
  distance, "Last night?"</p>

  <p>"After you went to bed."</p>

  <p>Straightening, Jack regarded his host with silent appraisal for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"Do much of that? Night work&mdash;after you've been at it, all day?"</p>

  <p>"It's more satisfactory." The other detached himself from the disapproving
  eyes. "No interruptions&mdash;at night."</p>

  <p>"It'll break you," warned Jack.</p>

  <p>"You do the same thing, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Not quite. I haven't your responsibilities. Besides&mdash;I'm a younger
  man than you. This programme of yours will shorten your life."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not trying to hang up a new record for longevity."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>He was coming down the hospital steps now, almost jauntily. It was easy to
  see that he had already put himself into a vacation mood. Jack leaned over
  and opened the car-door for him.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to have kept you waiting," said Cunningham, spinning the old
  engine. "I've a chap in there&mdash;Jim Gibson&mdash;who has been laid up for
  three months with a bad leg; compound fracture, infection, long and painful
  drainage; hasn't cared a hoot whether he got well or not; shrewish wife, wild
  daughter. Part of it was Jim's fault. The leg was the least of his
  troubles&mdash;and the least of mine. I am going to discharge him on Monday."
  He exploded a sigh of recollection. "I saw, from the first, that it wasn't
  any use to drain Jim's infected leg unless we drained the poison off the
  whole darned Gibson family."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I wouldn't be much good at that sort of thing," admitted Jack,
  feeling he ought to say something.</p>

  <p>"You would if you had it to do. It's part of the job: maybe its the most
  important part. Sometimes I think my surgery is chiefly valuable because it
  gives me entry to the confidence of a family. We do a satisfactory piece of
  surgical repair, and people think we can work wonders of all sorts. They look
  to us with a trust they don't have in anybody else. It's flattering,
  but&mdash;you've got to pay for the distinction!"</p>

  <p>They were in a brief traffic tangle now, Cunningham attending to his
  problem at the wheel. There was a considerable pause in the talk. When the
  street was clear, Jack said, "I've never thought about it, just that way. My
  training has been different. It has never occurred to me to interest myself
  in the private lives of patients."</p>

  <p>"That's because you don't think of them as <i>your</i> patients. They are
  referred to you by other doctors. The home physician knows the patient,
  through and through. You get the case because you're an expert, a specialist.
  You feel that you aren't expected to know anything&mdash;or to want to know
  anything&mdash;but the pathology involved." Cunningham's eyes suddenly
  widened with a new idea. "But&mdash;I say!&mdash;Beaven; you really have a
  bigger chance to do something important than the old doc at home! See? The
  patient has been sent to you because you're more accomplished than the family
  physician. <i>You</i> perform the miracle! Old doc couldn't do it; admitted
  it; brought the case to you. <i>You</i> did it! By Jove&mdash;if <i>you</i>
  were to show some concern for the fellow's well-being, he'd follow you about
  like a dog!"</p>

  <p>Jack grinned rather self-consciously over this crazy imputation of
  greatness, hardly knowing what rejoinder would sound less silly than
  another.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he conceded, at length, "I believe in social rehabilitation,
  but it's a separate task. I can't attend to that&mdash;and give the best I've
  got to science."</p>

  <p>Cunningham turned his head and faced Jack with an almost paternal
  smile.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think that social rehabilitation isn't a science?" he
  asked, quietly. "Beaven&mdash;every man's occupation should serve him mainly
  as an axis on which he revolves through a given social area, in the capacity
  of a constructive humanitarian. Even in an obscure job, he makes social
  contacts offering opportunities. Not every man has my chance to do something
  important, much less <i>your</i> chance which I think is greater&mdash;for
  the reason I have told you. But, if a man wills it so, he can exert a mighty
  influence even as a common craftsman. One time, there was a
  <i>carpenter</i>&mdash;" He left the sentence unfinished.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe that story?" queried Jack.</p>

  <p>"Substantially. I expect it has been cluttered with legends that were
  well-intended&mdash;but unnecessary."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;the miracles?"</p>

  <p>They were getting out into the open country now. Cunningham allowed the
  old sedan to slow down a little. He did not immediately reply. Jack felt that
  he would when he was ready, and waited.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;let's not talk about those miracles, just now," said
  Cunningham, thoughtfully. "Let's talk about ours. Yours and mine. If Jim
  Gibson was your case, handled according to your professional theory, you'd
  say to the nurse, Monday morning, 'Gibson can go, this afternoon. His leg is
  well now.' And they'd help Gibson into his pants&mdash;and call a taxi." The
  sedan lagged almost to a stop. Cunningham laid his hand on Jack's knee and
  looked him squarely in the eyes. "But when I discharge Jim Gibson, on Monday,
  I'm going to say, <i>'Arise</i>&mdash;<i>and walk!'</i> And Gibson's going to
  know that I expect something more of him than mere <i>locomotion!"</i></p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THAT inclement night seemed specially made for
  story-telling, and Cunningham knew a good one. It was the most unusual and
  fascinating tale Jack Beaven had ever heard; the most disquieting, too, for
  the farther his companion went into it the more remote was China and the
  Chinese, and&mdash;of course&mdash;Lan Ying.</p>

  <p>The vacationing doctors made a ridiculous sight as they sprawled before
  the blazing spruce in their bathing-suits and blankets. All the chairs in the
  one-room log cabin, except the ones they occupied, were ranged in two rows on
  either side of the big field-stone chimney, grotesquely draped with soggy and
  steaming garments. It was raining cats and dogs, and the air&mdash;abominably
  hot through most of the day&mdash;had become decidedly cool.</p>

  <p>From three o'clock on, the sky had lowered and darkened, occasionally
  muttering and spitting crimson fire through the folds of purple-blue
  curtains, a quite exciting spectacle. It seemed that a great deal was going
  on, what with the mounting racket of the threatened storm and the increasing
  recklessness of the bass.</p>

  <p>Jack felt that he had never been through a more confusing experience, with
  the whole heaven staging a noisy and flamboyant show while a hard-fought
  battle was being waged with a plunging, diving, twisting, leaping, utterly
  berserk bass made of unlickable courage and coiled steel
  springs&mdash;undoubtedly the biggest fish ever deceived by a hand-made fly.
  It was found later to weigh three and one-half pounds&mdash;not tons.</p>

  <p>Cunningham stood up and dragged in the muddy anchor&mdash;an old
  ploughshare on fifty feet of sash-cord. Beaven limbered up the oars and
  fitted them into the creaking rowlocks. The storm was gaining strength.</p>

  <p>"It's old Richard Wagner!" called Cunningham.</p>

  <p>"Ought to be arrested," shouted Jack. "Disturbing the peace."</p>

  <p>"It's grand! Magnificent!" Cunningham swept the tempestuous sky with an
  exultant gesture. Jack, reinstalling an oar that he had just yanked free of
  its lock by a mighty tug, yelled, "Glad you like it!"</p>

  <p>Whereupon Cunningham delivered an impressive oration. Anybody could see,
  he declaimed, that the soul of Wagner was putting on the big show. All the
  Wagnerian devices were at work in the way the storm built itself
  up&mdash;through threats and challenges, thrusts and forays, piling crescendo
  on crescendo&mdash;until, the supplies have given out, it scurried back to
  the ammunition dump for more kettledrums and cymbals&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And water," assisted Jack.</p>

  <p>"Then," pursued his companion, undistracted, "it goes into a huddle for
  grumbled consultation on strategy, and rushes forth again into the open
  field&mdash;a thousand abreast, galloping full tilt, lickety-split, hoofs
  pounding, turf flying, armour clanging... Sheets of flame! Bursts of
  bombs!... Stupendous!... Tremendous!... It's Wagner!"</p>

  <p>"And it's vet," added Jack. "Wery, wery vet!"</p>

  <p>In the world's long history it had never&mdash;but once&mdash;rained this
  hard before. Jack, rowing with long strokes and budding blisters, his head
  tipped back to let the water in the scuppers of his panama run down his neck
  instead of his eyes, inquired how far it was to the mountains. Cunningham was
  scaling the biggest bass, raking its shining flank with an experienced
  hand.</p>

  <p>"You'd better save your wind for your work," he advised. "You've a
  half-mile to go. No&mdash;you needn't look round." He flapped the fish over
  on the other side and harvested another long winnow of silver scales. "I'll
  stop you before you run into the dock."</p>

  <p>"Galley slave," growled Jack.</p>

  <p>"None o' that soap-box oratory." The other slit open the bass and scooped
  its viscera into the lake. "I'm a capitalist."</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;you look like one. You ought to see yourself."</p>

  <p>It had been that kind of an afternoon, conversationally; chaff, banter,
  and nonsense. Cunningham had turned out to be a rare companion. Beaven,
  habitually serious, was discovering in himself a capacity for play, and was
  delighted. After a couple of eternities Cunningham began signalling
  directions for landing. Cramped and weary, they climbed out on to the
  slippery wharf, unloaded their catch, and plodded heavily to the cabin,
  squashing water at every step; soaked to the hide.</p>

  <p>Presently the host demonstrated that he was a good cook, though he didn't
  have to be a very good one to seem so when the huge platter of broiled fish
  encountered the voracious appetites developed by the day's sport.</p>

  <p>After the noble feast had been devoured and cleared, the contended medicos
  replenished the fire, lighted their pipes, and agreed that the
  world&mdash;taken by and large&mdash;should be viewed with approval.
  Doubtless it had its little imperfections; but, as worlds went, drawled
  Cunningham, this one wasn't any worse than some and better than most.</p>

  <p>"I'll take your word for it," agreed Jack, lazily. "You've probably been
  about more than I have."</p>

  <p>"No"&mdash;Cunningham was suddenly serious. "That's my most valuable
  regret. All my life I've nursed a bad case of wanderlust. And I haven't
  been&mdash;anywhere."</p>

  <p>Jack admitted that he too had often wished he might push back his horizon
  a little but didn't intend to fret about it. "It just isn't in the cards for
  me."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not&mdash;for either of us," conceded Cunningham. "It's hard for
  us to get away. But I'm convinced that the man who spins around one pivot,
  describing a circle about a hundred miles in circumference, occasionally
  flying off at a tangent for a day in Detroit or Chicago, but never really
  seeing the outside world, has missed the best part of life."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it isn't quite that bad," reflected Jack. "If it's scenery you
  want, our country can supply every sort there is. If it's people,
  well&mdash;there are plenty of foreigners here. You don't have to go to
  Italy."</p>

  <p>The other roused to support his argument. That was, he declared, the hell
  of it. We had all sorts of foreigners, but they didn't represent their races
  or nations any more than our own riff-raff could represent us abroad.</p>

  <p>"What can you find out about Czechoslovakia," he persisted, "in your
  hospital wards? What do we learn about Italian thought&mdash;manners, aims,
  arts&mdash;from the ordinary run-o'-the-mine Dago who shows up at the Free
  Dispensary?" He paused for a long moment. "What I want to do most,
  Beaven"&mdash;Cunningham lowered his voice, impressively&mdash;"what I hope
  to do&mdash;some day&mdash;is to see China."</p>

  <p>"Why China?" Jack shifted his position and was attentive.</p>

  <p>"I'm not thinking about the tourist's China," continued Cunningham,
  ignoring the query. "Swarms of coolies, fantastic processions, joss houses,
  tea houses, junk shops and junks, shrill sounds and bad smells&mdash;and then
  back to the cruise-boat for the hop to Honolulu. No, no! I want to see a
  Chinese home of the better sort. I'd like to stay a while&mdash;and get
  acquainted."</p>

  <p>"Fat chance of that," scoffed Jack. "But whatever put such a notion in
  your head?" He tried to make his voice sound careless.</p>

  <p>Cunningham got up and poked the fire, returned to his chair, hooked a bare
  toe under the rung of another and drew it toward him, stretched out his legs
  on it, and refired his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Beaven&mdash;how much do you know of Audrey Hilton's story?"</p>

  <p>"Almost nothing. She told me she was brought up over there."</p>

  <p>"Interested?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Why not? Carry on."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Cunningham, having settled to the task of narration, spent the first few
  minutes reciting the part of the story that Jack already knew. The wealthy
  and cultured Sen Ling, wounded in spirit because of slights and rebuffs
  received in this country and on homing shipboard, had been tactfully
  conciliated by Captain Hilton, ship's commander; invited to share his suite,
  given the liberty of the bridge, treated with dignity and distinction. Sen
  Ling had been quietly grateful.</p>

  <p>"Hilton's motives may have been a bit confused: I don't know. He may have
  felt that the fine old Chinaman had had a raw deal, and wanted to assist him
  in saving face. On the other hand, Hilton was something of a diplomat in his
  business relations with Hong Kong and may have hoped that Sen Ling's goodwill
  would be valuable to the steamship company. At all events, it turned out that
  way. When the captain died he was fairly well-to-do. Bonuses&mdash;and so
  on&mdash;from an appreciative board. Hilton, for years, carried the most
  lucrative cargoes of any ship in the trans-Pacific service. Sen Ling had
  passed the word around that Hilton was their friend.</p>

  <p>"But that wasn't all; smallest part of it. Hilton's favour to the Chinaman
  had loomed so large in the merchant's mind that he invariably came down to
  see the ship tie up. Sometimes the captain's duties would detain him on deck
  for three or four hours, but when he came off there would be his
  Chink&mdash;waiting for him; insisting on Hilton's coming to his house to be
  his guest. For months these invitations were refused. The captain had his
  work to do; probably didn't want to go, anyhow. One day he gave in. Sen Ling
  had seemed very much hurt over these rejections of his hospitality and Hilton
  decided to humour him. That may have been for business reasons. What I'm
  trying to get at is: Captain Hilton never made an effort to wangle himself in
  the esteem of Sen Ling."</p>

  <p>"Maybe that's the reason the Chinese wanted him," suggested Jack.</p>

  <p>"Doubtless.... Well&mdash;after that, Henry Hilton never had to be
  coaxed. And it may be assumed that his motives, from that time
  on&mdash;whatever they may have been, in the first place&mdash;were free of
  any commercial interest. When he arrived, his host was always waiting for him
  with luxurious litters and bearers, and breezy old Hilton was eager to climb
  in and be carried over the winding road to the beautiful house of Sen Ling,
  halfway up the peak that overlooked the city."</p>

  <p>"He must have known instinctively how to accommodate his habits and
  behaviour to the customs of the Sen Ling home," reflected Jack, "or he
  wouldn't have felt so easy there."</p>

  <p>Cunningham nodded agreement.</p>

  <p>"That&mdash;plus the fact that Henry had been in the Chinese trade long
  enough to pick up plenty of information about their peculiar quirks. But Sen
  Ling was by no means an open book for the captain to read at a sitting. He
  was a deep one. Hilton had been visiting him regularly for a period of more
  than three years before he knew&mdash;and he found this out by sheer
  accident, and not from the Sen Lings&mdash;that the merchant was lavishly
  philanthropic. He was said to be, for instance, the largest private
  contributor to the English Hospital's upkeep and had staked a half-dozen or
  more Chinese youths to their medical education in England."</p>

  <p>"Why England? It was farther."</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure this was ever explained. Perhaps Sen Ling's unhappy
  experiences in the States may have had something to do with it. At all
  events, Hilton discovered that his Chinese friend&mdash;for all his strict
  adherence to the manners and motives of his own country&mdash;did not resent
  the intrusion of any knowledge that might add to the general welfare of
  China. His large benevolence to the hospital is a case in point; and,
  besides, it is an important factor to this story."</p>

  <p>Cunningham helped himself to the tobacco tin and passed it. The fire was
  smouldering, and Beaven revived it. He had a feeling that the first chapter
  had come to an end. It had all been interesting enough, but he was anxious to
  see Audrey come into it.</p>

  <p>"I think it may be taken for granted," Cunningham went on, "that Sen
  Ling's influence in Hong Kong&mdash;both with the foreigners and the
  Chinese&mdash;was very strong. Even at that, he must have had a very anxious
  time at the turn of the century, when the Boxer mess was on. I don't know how
  he managed it, but the English Hospital in Hong Kong was one of the few
  institutions that carried on without any interruption through those wild
  days. For about a year, foreign trade was upset, shipping disorganized,
  everything at sixes and sevens. Henry Hilton's ship, for some unexplained
  reason, came more nearly carrying on a normal schedule than any other vessel
  doing business in Chinese waters. The fact that Hilton was British-born had
  nothing to do with it; for Chinese animosity was more vigorously
  demonstrated, at that time, against England than America.</p>

  <p>"But Henry stoutly refused, during this period, to be Sen Ling's guest,
  unwilling to put his friend in an embarrassing position. After the rebellion
  had subsided, their former relations were resumed, seemingly all the stronger
  for the temporary interruption. Sen Ling had four sons and one wife. His
  monogamy was considered, by his intimates, as in the nature of an
  eccentricity. Perhaps the fact that Madame Sen Ling was a descendant of the
  celebrated King Wan family&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I say," Jack chimed in, "you seem to be mighty well posted on these
  details. Where did you learn all this?"</p>

  <p>Cunningham smiled, chuckled reminiscently.</p>

  <p>"My yarn is synthetic, Beaven. It's pieced together of bits furnished
  partly by Audrey and her sister, but mostly from Ted King, Claudia's deceased
  husband. Ted's father was Henry Hilton's chief navigating officer&mdash;and
  closest friend&mdash;for all of a dozen years. That's how Ted and Claudia
  met. This story also is not without interest, but I shan't bother you with it
  just now."</p>

  <p>"Very well," consented Jack. "Be on your way."</p>

  <p>"Let's see&mdash;where were we?... Oh, yes&mdash;Sen Ling had only one
  wife, four sons, and enough uncles, aunts, cousins, second-cousins, nephews,
  and nieces to&mdash;I am told that when they all assembled on ceremonial
  occasions the family made quite an impressive showing."</p>

  <p>"All live together?"</p>

  <p>"In one big compound, surrounded by a high wall and gorgeously beautiful
  gates, though I understand that these huge establishments are rigged up so
  that&mdash;in spite of the population&mdash;each unit of the big family
  enjoys about as much privacy as it wants.... Well&mdash;I'm stringing this
  out too long. Hope I'm not boring you."</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly! I'm all ears."</p>

  <p>"Claudia Hilton was born in '96. In San Francisco. Her mother had a rough
  time and was not very well for several years. She was hospitalized a
  half-dozen times, and the little girl was sent to a first-class
  boarding-school near Monterey. The Hiltons were warned that they'd better not
  have any more children. I don't know the pathology. Might have been any one
  of a dozen things, as you know.</p>

  <p>"In 1904, Mrs Hilton discovered she was going to have a baby. Henry,
  naturally, was very much worried; couldn't leave his run, particularly at
  that time, for affairs in China were unsettled; the whole
  situation&mdash;politically, commercially&mdash;loaded with doubt and
  dynamite. The ship's doctor, to whom Henry had confided his anxiety,
  suggested that Mrs Hilton might be better off in Honolulu. So, they took her
  over there. She was lonely&mdash;and scared. Once, well on toward the end of
  her time, Henry found her&mdash;on his outbound voyage&mdash;in a grand state
  of hysterics, which wasn't like her, at all. The ship's doctor said they had
  better take her along. By the time they reached Hong Kong Mrs Hilton needed
  better care than they could give her on shipboard, so they put her in the
  hospital."</p>

  <p>"Sen Ling's, maybe?" guessed Jack.</p>

  <p>Cunningham nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and the Sen Ling family was very much concerned. Henry had to
  sail again in a week. They assured him that they would see to it that Mrs
  Hilton had every care. Reluctantly the captain put out to sea. It was before
  the days of radio. When he arrived in San Francisco they handed him a cable
  from Sen Ling. It was brief.</p>

  <p>"SHE IS BURIED WITH MY ANCESTORS YOUR GIRL CHILD IS WITH US"</p>

  <p>Beaven gave an incoherent exclamation of amazement.</p>

  <p>"They took her home with them?"</p>

  <p>"They did. They engaged a nurse from the hospital. Nobody knows anything
  about the scene enacted when Henry next returned to Hong Kong and saw his
  daughter for the first time. It must have been very tender. Madame Sen Ling
  was overjoyed to have a girl-baby in the house; probably glad her own
  children were boys, but naturally wistful for a girl, nevertheless. It was
  obvious that the baby would have to remain in China for the time being. Henry
  had no home now. Claudia was much better off in the girls' school than she
  might have been under the care of a housekeeper. Next time he came back Henry
  told Madame Sen Ling that he wished to name the baby Audrey, after her
  mother. Madame Sen Ling smiled and ventured to glance at her husband
  inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"'She should have two names, Captain Hilton,' said Sen Ling. 'You shall
  call her Audrey. We ask permission to call her Lan Ying.'"</p>

  <p>"Does that mean something?" asked Jack.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but I don't know what."</p>

  <p>"She wouldn't tell you?" Jack tried to keep his tone steady.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;and Claudia doesn't know, for I asked her."</p>

  <p>Jack nearly bit his pipe-stem in two. Even her sister didn't know. But
  Audrey would tell <i>him</i>&mdash;may-bee!</p>

  <p>"Beaven&mdash;I'm getting cold. Besides, I've told you about all there is,
  except that this girl never came back until a year ago. Claudia's objections
  to her sister's remaining any longer in China had fermented until they were
  almost an obsession. She thought and talked about nothing else. Finally I was
  persuaded to write and say that I thought&mdash;and it was true enough, God
  knows&mdash;that Audrey had better come back, at least on a visit, or Claudia
  would be sick. So&mdash;Sen Ling and his wife brought her over. They went
  around the other way and spent some time in England where Sen Ling had some
  business he wished to cover personally."</p>

  <p>"That explains something," said Jack. "When she was in our hospital she
  referred to the elevator as the lift. That's English, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"You've a remarkable memory," drawled Cunningham with a grin.
  "However&mdash;Audrey Hilton didn't have to go to London to learn that an
  elevator is a lift. Hong Kong is, as you know, essentially British. All the
  Caucasian children she knew were as English as John Bull."</p>

  <p>"Then she did have some contacts with English-speaking people? I gathered
  from some of her peculiar pronunciations that her knowledge of English was
  had by reading rather than conversation. She puts quaint stress on certain
  syllables&mdash;'ver-ree' and 'fun-nee' and 'may-bee'."</p>

  <p>Cunningham laughed. "You've got that down pretty pat, Beaven.
  Well&mdash;this fun-nee little trick of hers is a hang-over from the
  influence of a governess the Sen Lings provided for her. The woman was French
  originally; tutored Audrey in French and the sort of English that a French
  person would dispense. Sometimes Audrey's sentences are composed in a manner
  that proves she was better acquainted with French syntax. But, however
  competently she handles herself in English&mdash;and French&mdash;I have no
  doubt she does most of her thinking in Chinese."</p>

  <p>"She'll become Americanized, won't she, in time?" asked Jack, in a hopeful
  tone that meant the question admitted of only one answer.</p>

  <p>"I doubt it," said Cunningham, with conviction. "One of the unexplained
  mysteries is the uncanny ability of the Chinese to assimilate the people who
  get caught in the web of their curious culture. They are not crusaders, they
  are not missionaries, they are not propagandists. They have no interest in
  making converts. In fact, they have always exhibited a serene indifference to
  the philosophy and manners of foreigners. But history insists that the people
  who go to China, and stay in China long enough to expose themselves to its
  mind and mood, are captive. The ancient Greek had the same capacity. The
  Romans could hammer 'em to a pulp but had to admit that the Greeks had taken
  'em into camp&mdash;spiritually. The time came, even while the Gauls had
  Greece in abject slavery, when no Roman could call himself a gentleman if he
  didn't speak Greek. No&mdash;you'll find that Audrey Hilton will never be at
  home anywhere but in Cathay. Some ways considered, it's a great pity. Her
  life&mdash;judged by our views&mdash;will probably be ruined. She couldn't
  possibly bring herself to marry a Chinese, no matter how deeply she might
  respect him&mdash;and any American who marries her will either have to make
  her over, from the ground up, which would inevitably destroy her
  personality&mdash;or else&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a long pause before Jack gained the consent of his own mind to
  inquire, "Or else&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>Cunningham made a baffled gesture with upturned palms, and after a
  moment's delay, muttered, "Or else&mdash;go Chinese himself."</p>

  <p>"That's&mdash;that's too bad," commented Jack, lamely.</p>

  <p>They sat for a couple of minutes in silence. Then the host rose and raked
  the coals together with the fire-shovel; Jack watching him with moody,
  abstracted eyes.</p>

  <p>"Thought I'd tell you," said Cunningham.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was by no means an easy task to inform Cunningham of the engagement he
  had made with Audrey for the drive. If it had not been such a discourteous
  thing to do, Jack wouldn't have told him. But there was no dodging it. It
  could be postponed but not evaded.</p>

  <p>Best of all reasons for his reticence was his doubt whether he had any
  right to be seeing more of Audrey. There could be no question about the
  unwisdom of his course. He was aware that in yielding himself still farther
  to the charm and loveliness of this enchanting girl he was taking a chance of
  demolishing his own plan for living; to say nothing of the injustice he might
  be perpetrating by disclosing&mdash;and this seemed unavoidable&mdash;his
  deep interest in her.</p>

  <p>The programme he had mapped for himself, many years ago, and to which he
  had adhered with stern fidelity, demanded a singleness of purpose&mdash;the
  pursuit of Science. It had been his conviction, deliberately arrived at and
  uncompromisingly maintained, that the work he intended to do should have his
  full attention. He had resolutely averted his thoughts from any wish to
  establish a home and take on the inevitable cares which would absorb more and
  more of his time and interest. The happier the home, the worse for his
  ambition.</p>

  <p>In allowing himself to think tenderly of Audrey Hilton, he had not, he
  felt, violated his compact with himself. Nothing would come of it: he would
  see to that. Surely nobody could say it was his fault if
  circumstances&mdash;directly in lines of professional duty&mdash;had thrown
  him into contact with this superb creature. His interview with her at the
  Livingstone Hotel, Jack told himself, had not been sought for any other
  reason than to extend the natural courtesies required by the occasion. His
  vacation trip, too, was soundly explainable. Had he had not been advised to
  take it? It hadn't been his own idea, at all. Shane had suggested it,
  claiming he ought to have a few days of recreation for the sake of his own
  fitness for his work. Nor had it been his own scheme to visit Cunningham.
  That was Osgood's suggestion. To find a good place for fishing; that was the
  motive. And if Audrey Hilton was a dinner-guest at the Cunninghams', it
  certainly wasn't his fault.</p>

  <p>And he couldn't be a boor, could he? Science surely didn't expect a man to
  be rude, unsocial. Ordinary politeness required him to say he was sorry he
  had been called away in the middle of the story she was telling him. It was
  natural enough, was it not, to say he would like to hear the rest of it? A
  man could be a devoted scientist and still be a gentleman, couldn't he? And
  when Audrey had given an excellent reason why it would be impossible to
  finish her story in the presence of her sister, what else was there for him
  to do than suggest a private talk? It was all plain as a pikestaff. Down
  inside himself, his censor-mind grinned, winked, and made the objectionable
  noise commonly referred to as a Bronx cheer, to which he had with dignity
  replied by arraying his assorted self-justifications.</p>

  <p>But it was one thing to explain to himself the casualness of his
  appointment with Audrey and the utter lack of design in his engagement to see
  her alone. It was quite another thing to say to Bill Cunningham, "I'm going
  for a drive, this afternoon, with Audrey Hilton." He couldn't line up all his
  defences and excuses, and invite Cunningham to observe how naturally this had
  come about. It would sound very silly. And his censor-mind, chuckling,
  remarked, "It would sound silly because it <i>is</i> silly, and nobody knows
  it better than you."</p>

  <p>"I'm going for a drive, this afternoon, with Audrey Hilton," said Jack,
  when they were within a mile of the city.</p>

  <p>"Edith told me," said Cunningham. "She had invited Audrey to go with her
  to a garden-party to-day, and she begged off from the engagement; said she'd
  just promised to go with you. That will be very nice. Hope you have a good
  time. We'll expect you to spend the night with us. Right? And dinner?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Bill. I hope I'm not wearing out my welcome. I'll be off
  to-morrow. Back to the mill, I think. I am not accustomed to vacations. I've
  a guilty feeling that I'm neglecting my work."</p>

  <p>"In my opinion," said Cunningham, "any man engaged in a profession as
  wearing to the nerves as ours can do more work in eleven months than in
  twelve. No man is more in need of a regular vacation than a doctor&mdash;and
  no man is less able to take one."</p>

  <p>Jack, agreeing to this, added, "I've often wondered whether&mdash;instead
  of carrying on through a long term of eleven months, and then absenting
  oneself for a month, and getting rusty in one's technique&mdash;it might be
  more sensible to take two or three days off occasionally."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;here we are." Bill drew up in the garage-area. "Now for a bite
  of lunch, and we'll be on our ways. Edith won't be here. She's at the party.
  One of the hostesses. We'll see her this evening."</p>

  <p>Making short work of his luncheon, Cunningham hurried away. Jack dressed
  with care in sports clothes, occasionally glancing at his watch on the
  chiffonier. Fearing he had forgotten to wind it, he gave the stem a few
  turns. It was an odd thing, he said to his reflection in the glass as he
  retied his scarf, how time seemed to stop, on some occasions; how swiftly it
  speeded, on others. Apparently the mind possessed no uniform instruments of
  precision for estimating time. Three minutes spent in boiling an egg and
  three minutes in a long-distance telephone conversation weren't the same
  thing, at all. A man knew, by experience, how much he could lift; how fast he
  could run; how far he could jump. He knew, almost to the inch, the length and
  breadth of his car; knew, to a certainty, whether or not he could drive
  through a narrow lane between vehicles in congested traffic; knew whether he
  could park in an opening at a crowded curb. But he was inaccurate in judging
  the relative value of five minutes, ten, fifteen. With only one life to live,
  and time being very precious, it was queer that the human being hadn't
  evolved a precise time-sense to assist in saving this most valuable of all
  gifts. His censor-mind spoke up: "If you want to know why you're
  philosophizing on this subject, I'll tell you. You're averting your thoughts
  from this interview with Audrey because you're afraid of it. You want to see
  her, but you don't know what you want to say to her. You're in love with her,
  and you know you shouldn't be. You would like to know just where you stand,
  in her regard, and you hope she likes you. You believe she likes you.
  But&mdash;if she does&mdash;what are you going to do next?"</p>

  <p>The roadster responded pleasantly to his guidance, promising to be on its
  best behaviour. Audrey's street address was not hard to find, a commodious
  house of the bungalow type. She met him at the door, dressed for the drive.
  Her white flannel suit, well tailored, was distinctly American, accenting her
  shapeliness more insistently than the flowing Chinese garments in which he
  had found her on the evening of their interrupted talk at the Livingstone
  Hotel. A red scarf intensified the glossy blackness of her hair, and a narrow
  white satin bandeau bound the fascinating black fringe to a white forehead.
  She held out her hand and gave him a smile that raced his pulse, making no
  attempt to dissimulate: she was eager to have him come and entirely willing
  to let him know how she felt about it.</p>

  <p>"So sorree you will not see Teddy," she said. "He left on Saturday for a
  boy's camp. So well. So happee. Shall we go?" Her dark eyes widened with the
  query, and she nodded her head, childishly, as if coaxing to be off. It was
  as if they had known each other so long that she had no reason to be
  reticent. Jack's heart warmed at this little gesture of trust. In some
  indefinable manner Audrey was&mdash;he couldn't find a phrase for
  it&mdash;was in his keeping. He had a glowing sensation of something akin to
  proprietorship.</p>

  <p>The roadster top had been folded down. Apparently it was the first time
  Audrey had been driven in an open car. The sense of freedom delighted her,
  and she said so. She said so with such exultation that Jack wondered whether
  she didn't live a rather hampered life. He asked her if there was any
  particular drive she would prefer to take, to which she replied,
  "Anywhere."</p>

  <p>So, putting the town behind them, Jack chose the road over which he had
  just come with Cunningham, a winding gravelled road that hugged the wooded
  shores of small lake sparkling in the afternoon sun. The car was rolling
  slowly, smoothly, through a heavily shaded avenue of tall firs; Audrey, with
  parted lips, drew a deep, luxurious breath, shook her head incredulously over
  the beauty of the scene and her own sensation of pure delight.</p>

  <p>"You don't often get out into the country?" observed Jack.</p>

  <p>"No. My sister is always engaged through the day, and I do not drive."</p>

  <p>"It would be pleasant if you had a little car. Then you could be more
  free."</p>

  <p>Audrey smiled half-pensively and slowly shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Some people are not destined to have freedom," she said. "I think I am
  one of them."</p>

  <p>"Was your liberty restricted when you lived in China?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally. Chinese girls, especially in homes that adhere to the old
  traditions, live very closely sheltered lives. However, I did not worry about
  it then. In America it is different. Almost everyone has more freedom."</p>

  <p>"But not you?" asked Jack, sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"May-bee it is my fault," confessed Audrey. "I find it difficult to adjust
  myself to American ways. I do not know many people. And my sister, knowing
  how little chance I have had to be independent, leads me about with her as if
  I were a small child."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;we can't have that," declared Jack, firmly. "You will have to
  tell your sister that you're grown up."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid Claudia would not believe it."</p>

  <p>"You'd better issue a declaration of independence before she smothers
  you."</p>

  <p>Audrey laughed a little, almost guiltily.</p>

  <p>"I think I am doing that now," she confessed. "I feel like a culprit.
  Claudia would not approve of this, at all. So I did not tell her. It is a
  strange experience," she added, "to be out on one's own."</p>

  <p>In the mood of a fellow-conspirator, Jack surprised her by admitting that
  he too was enjoying an unaccustomed freedom.</p>

  <p>"I live a very narrowly bounded life," he was saying. "If you are
  relishing your stolen hour of liberty, I can assure you that I share your
  sensations."</p>

  <p>"But do the hospital and the Medical College require you to work all the
  time?" she wanted to know. "How cruel of them!"</p>

  <p>"In all fairness to them," explained Jack, "my schedule of work has been
  of my own making. It's a long story. I mustn't bore you with it. The day is
  too fine for such dull reminiscences."</p>

  <p>"Please," said Audrey, gently. "I want to know&mdash;if you want to
  tell."</p>

  <p>The car slackened its speed perceptibly.</p>

  <p>"When I entered the Medical College as a student, I had about the same
  ideas concerning my future work that were shared by the majority of my
  classmates. I had a natural fondness for scientific research and looked
  forward to my medical course with interest, but it never occurred to me that
  I would permit my profession to dominate my life to the extent that nothing
  else could have a place in my thoughts."</p>

  <p>"And then something happened&mdash;suddenly?" encouraged Audrey.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but not what you might suppose. Many people have sworn
  themselves into an exclusive devotion to some task or mission because of a
  tragic disappointment; unhappy love affair, maybe. That wasn't the case with
  me. I had pursued the normal life of a college student but without any
  entanglements that would affect my emotional gearing. No&mdash;the thing that
  happened was an address delivered to the class, on the first day, by a very
  brilliant and hard-working professor. The picture he drew of a life devoted
  to science stirred me very deeply. To attain the highest proficiency in that
  career, the professor said, one must not only practise constant
  self-discipline&mdash;as to habits, hours of work, and the abandonment of
  social distractions&mdash;but must see to it that the self-discipline became
  automatic and effortless."</p>

  <p>"I see," commented Audrey. "So you wouldn't have to spend any of your time
  worrying about what you had given up."</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" declared Jack, pleased over her promptness to understand.</p>

  <p>"And you did it?" she asked. "I can see that you did. Was it not
  difficult?"</p>

  <p>"Not for long. I think I soon began to take pride in it, like a man saving
  money. The first thousand is the hardest."</p>

  <p>"And, after that, he is a miser," she suggested, smiling.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," Jack agreed. "I never thought much about money, so I don't
  know just where thrift turns to avarice."</p>

  <p>"You would not need to think much about money&mdash;if you never went any
  place or did anything but work. So, after a while"&mdash;Audrey shook her
  head in expectation of his answer&mdash;"you did not fret, any more, about
  the pleasure you were missing?"</p>

  <p>He deliberated his reply for a moment.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be quite true to say that I did not have restless days; but,
  in the main, I found so much interest in my job that nothing else made much
  of a bid for my attention." He turned to her with a smile that promised a
  confession. "Take the subject of girls, for example. There's probably nothing
  that can so completely divert a young man's mind as an infatuation. I
  resolved that to avoid this problem it would be better if I closed my eyes to
  the very existence of women."</p>

  <p>Audrey's eyes were averted as she received this information. She made no
  comment, and Jack went on.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;you see&mdash;this is in the nature of a stolen hour of freedom
  for me, too." He chuckled, a bit self-consciously. "You have run away from
  Claudia, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you have run away from yourself," added Audrey, soberly.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;something like that."</p>

  <p>"But"&mdash;she glanced up with an honest smile in her brown
  eyes&mdash;"you have so good an excuse, Dr Beaven. This is, after all, a
  research party for you. I was invited to tell you the rest of my story about
  my life in China. May-bee," she added, thoughtfully, "you might have a
  Chinese patient, some time; is it not so?"</p>

  <p>Jack studied her eyes for an instant, but they would not confess they were
  teasing.</p>

  <p>"That's true," he replied, gratefully. "I might. Perhaps you will go on
  with it now. I am most anxious to hear it."</p>

  <p>"It is hard to know where to begin." Audrey's tone was tender as she
  adventured upon the strange narrative. Much of the tale Jack had already
  heard from Cunningham, but he did not tell her so; he listened attentively to
  her account of the unusual circumstances of her birth in Hong Kong and her
  adoption by the Sen Lings. The car idled to a stop at a bend in the road
  where there was ample space to park in full view of an engaging vista, a
  silver lake rippled by the breeze.</p>

  <p>"Tell me something about your childhood," encouraged Jack, when she had
  done with the prologue of her story. "I know next to nothing about life in
  China. Far as my knowledge goes, you might as well have been born on the
  moon. Was the Chinese language hard for you to learn?"</p>

  <p>Audrey laughed merrily.</p>

  <p>"How sillee!" she exclaimed. "It was my native tongue, you know. I suppose
  it was no more difficult to learn than English was for you when you were a
  baby, Dr Beaven." Her brown eyes twinkled teasingly as she added, "I assume
  that you were once a baby. You are such a verree serious man, I am not sure
  about that."</p>

  <p>Jack chuckled to prove that he wasn't as serious as he seemed, and Audrey
  continued with her story.</p>

  <p>"I distinctly remember my first little shoes," she said, dreamily. "They
  were red, with grey cats' faces painted on the toes; so I wouldn't fall, you
  know. The cats made me sure-footed."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;the family actually believed that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no." Audrey smilingly repudiated this accusation. "That is," she
  hastily qualified, "I am sure my mother did not think so, and of course the
  wise Sen Ling did not. But&mdash;the old myths are quite persistent, and the
  old symbols are respected. Perhaps Shu-cheng may have believed in the cats.
  Shu-cheng was my amah&mdash;my nurse&mdash;and had been brought up to have
  faith in all of the superstitions. Most of the instruction given to little
  children is done in fairy-tales. But it is so with you, too; is it not?
  Perhaps we heard more than you, about the doings of the gods, though I am not
  sure of that. Your Jehovah&mdash;he opened a dry path through the rivers, did
  he not, so his good friends would not get their feet wet?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but not lately," said Jack, amused.</p>

  <p>Audrey's face was suddenly animated.</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;that is the difference between your gods and ours," she went
  on. "Your gods have done their work. Ours are very much alive and busy all
  the day long."</p>

  <p>"For instance&mdash;?" Jack's interest was mounting.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;our kitchen god heard everything that was said and reported to
  the other gods."</p>

  <p>"Was there more talk in the kitchen than elsewhere?"</p>

  <p>"May-bee. I think there is always more candid talk in kitchens. But
  perhaps the reason why they hung this god's picture in the kitchen was
  because it was so convenient to the sugar-bowl. Whenever we said anything
  rude or unkind that we did not want told to the other gods, we touched the
  kitchen god's lips with sugar."</p>

  <p>"So his report would be more palatable?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and we had to pay for the sugar by performing some errand."</p>

  <p>"Or having to sit in the corner, perhaps," suggested Jack, "meditating on
  your misdeamenour."</p>

  <p>"No," said Audrey, seriously. "The Chinese would never punish a child that
  way. Meditation in China is not a penalty but a privilege. The Chinese father
  would be greatly distressed if his child felt that an hour of thoughtful
  solitude was irksome."</p>

  <p>This was a new idea, but Jack agreed that it had merit.</p>

  <p>"The next time I have a chance to repeat this to the parents of a small
  child," he said, "I shall give them something to think about."</p>

  <p>With the utmost candour Audrey rejoined, "Perhaps you may want to remember
  this when you have occasion to discipline your own children&mdash;if you
  should have some."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'll not be having any," said Jack, firmly. "As I have told
  you, there is no room in my life for the obligations one should expect to
  meet in a well-ordered home&mdash;and I am sure I shouldn't want any other
  kind. I definitely gave up all thought of that&mdash;years ago. I have no
  time for such responsibilities."</p>

  <p>"I fear I am in the same position&mdash;for other reasons&mdash;but good
  ones," replied Audrey, after a meditative pause. "I seriously doubt whether I
  could fit into the way of life that is practised in the American home; and,
  of course, I could not consent to marry in China, however deeply I respect
  the Chinese."</p>

  <p>"You and I have a great deal in common, Audrey. You don't mind, do
  you&mdash;my calling you Audrey?"</p>

  <p>She smiled and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;but I would rather you called me by the name I like so much
  better&mdash;my Chinese name, you know&mdash;the one I have always worn,
  until recently. I think it would be verree pleasant if you called me Lan
  Ying. I get hungry to hear my name. Do you want to say it?" She leaned
  forward a little toward him, her eyes lighting with a new interest; and,
  elaborating the movements of her expressive lips, as if she were instructing
  a small child, carefully enunciated, "Lan Ying."</p>

  <p>"Lan Ying," repeated Jack, tenderly, making the name sing, as she had
  done. She clapped her hands happily.</p>

  <p>"So verree good for the first time," she said, in a tone of maternal
  encouragement. "You are quick to imitate, Dr Beaven. I shall teach you many
  of the words I like best, just to hear you say them. I am starved for the
  sound of my own language. Perhaps you do not realize how intense that kind of
  hunger can be."</p>

  <p>"I never thought about it before," admitted Jack, "but it's easy to
  understand&mdash;Lan Ying&mdash;how you must feel about that. Now that you
  speak of it, I do not often hear my name, these days. My student friends, who
  called me Jack, have mostly gone away to other places. I am Dr Beaven in the
  hospital and the Medical School." There was a long moment before Lan Ying
  replied.</p>

  <p>"Shall I?" she asked, searching his eyes seriously.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to?" He tried to say it calmly.</p>

  <p>"If I may. I do not know. We are hardly more than strangers. Perhaps it is
  not done. You would tell me&mdash;is it not so?&mdash;if that would be the
  wrong thing for me to do."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I would tell you, Lan Ying." His heart was pounding. He hoped
  she did not realize the exact state of his emotions.</p>

  <p>Her lips were pursed slightly and her eyes were momentarily averted, as if
  she were debating whether to extend a confidence.</p>

  <p>"Your name will not be difficult to say," she ventured. "In the hospital I
  heard Miss Warren refer to you, in speaking to another nurse, and she called
  you by your first name. I think the nurses do that quite often. Do you know
  what they call your Dr Forrester?" Her lips widened in a smile.</p>

  <p>Jack nodded and grinned.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I know."</p>

  <p>"Does he?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>She shook her head in anticipation of his next reply, and said, "He does
  not like it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. There are so many things that Tubby doesn't like. This may
  be one of them."</p>

  <p>"What are some of the others?" inquired Lan Ying, with interest.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;me, for instance."</p>

  <p>Lan Ying promptly disputed this with a little gesture of unbelief.</p>

  <p>"I heard that," she said, "but it surely is not true."</p>

  <p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

  <p>"Because he told my sister you gave promise of becoming the most brilliant
  surgeon in the hospital. Would he say such a thing if he did not like
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;he might. One man can approve of another man's work without
  liking him personally. Sometimes I think that two men who dislike each other
  can get more work done than cronies who waste their time in friendly
  talk."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;you like Doctor Forrester, do you not?"</p>

  <p>"Not by a jugful!"</p>

  <p>"And you work together&mdash;all day?"</p>

  <p>"And all nights, sometimes."</p>

  <p>"He never calls you 'Jack'?" she asked. It warmed him to hear his name on
  the lips of Lan Ying. They were adorable lips. Their mobile curves fascinated
  him. He could not see through to the muscles that moved them: he had
  forgotten everything he ever knew about anatomy.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, with a slightly sardonic smile. "Tubby is never chummy
  with me. He is very surly and critical. It is only fair to say, though, that
  his reproaches are generally just and beneficial. He is a very wise man. It
  was Tubby who made the speech I told you about&mdash;on the first
  day&mdash;the speech that changed the whole course of my life."</p>

  <p>Lan Ying shook her head incredulously.</p>

  <p>"You mean to say," she demanded, in a bewildered tone, "that you would
  permit the opinions of a man&mdash;whom you disliked&mdash;to set you going,
  for life, on a new path?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? Opinions about such matters are not private property. I didn't
  have to like Tubby in order to see sound sense in what he was saying. Perhaps
  this sounds as if I were not very sensitive," he added&mdash;"and maybe I'm
  not. It has sometimes occurred to me that my likes and dislikes for other
  people are not as acute as in the case of most persons. Part of my
  self-imposed programme is the careful disciplining of my affections and
  aversions. My aversion to Tubby hasn't interfered with my feeling that it is
  mutually to our advantage to work together. And I suppose"&mdash;he was
  choosing his words carefully&mdash;"I suppose that I could regard an
  affection in much the same way. I might feel it strongly without letting it
  encroach on my duties."</p>

  <p>He was not quite satisfied with this speech, which he had delivered mostly
  for his own benefit.</p>

  <p>"You are verree strong, Jack," remarked Lan Ying, seriously, a comment
  that left him feeling foolishly priggish; but was, he felt, about the sort of
  rejoinder he had earned. "And verree lonely, I think," she added, "having so
  little interest in people&mdash;as persons."</p>

  <p>"Any line of scientific research," explained Jack, dodging the real issue
  of the conversation, "is a lonely job. But"&mdash;he brightened&mdash;"it has
  its compensations. I should not want to be doing anything else. I am quite
  contented."</p>

  <p>Lan Ying shook her head with child-like obstinacy.</p>

  <p>"You could not be," she demurred. Impulsively she laid her fingers on his
  sleeve. "Why do you not make friends with this Tubbee? He is stubborn, and
  dislikes to take the first step toward a reconciliation. But you are
  younger&mdash;and you are not stubborn&mdash;and I know you are not
  bitter."</p>

  <p>Jack frowned a little. It was a painful subject. He hoped they might soon
  dispose of it. However, it was not at the stage where he could abandon
  it.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to reconcile," he said, resolutely. "Tubby and I were
  never friends. We have had no friendship to repair or reclaim."</p>

  <p>"I am sorree, Jack," she replied, softly. "It must have done you both a
  great deal of damage&mdash;to feel that way." Noting his mood, and apparently
  realizing that there had been quite enough talk about this matter, Lan Ying
  abruptly called his attention to the loveliness of the peaceful scene spread
  before them.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you would like to stroll down toward the lake," suggested Jack.
  He glanced at her shoes. "I don't think you would find it too rough. There
  seems to be a fairly good path."</p>

  <p>She was pleased with the idea, and they set out through the tall firs,
  Jack making no effort to accommodate his long stride to the little steps she
  was taking. They were very small feet. He wondered about them. Lan Ying,
  glancing up, found him smiling, and asked the reason with her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I think I heard, somewhere," he said, audaciously, "that the Chinese had
  stopped going in for small feet. Perhaps the rumour was incorrect."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," acknowledged Lan Ying, "if you mean what I think you mean. I
  am not so ver-ree big. I do not need big feet."</p>

  <p>"That must have been quite frightful," reflected Jack, "binding their
  girl-babies' feet, and making them hobble through life."</p>

  <p>Lan Ying laughed; and, halting, pointed to her heels, three inches
  high.</p>

  <p>"I think women are not supposed to walk naturally in any country," she
  said. "Did you ever look under the table in one of your nicer
  restaurants?"</p>

  <p>Jack couldn't recall that he had ever done so, but promised he would, next
  time.</p>

  <p>"Shoes off, maybe?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"It is so funnee," she said. "The Chinese gave up their foot-foolishness,
  just in time to save me much discomfort; and now I have come to America to
  find it."</p>

  <p>"If I were a woman," announced Jack, "I would be independent, and wear
  what I pleased."</p>

  <p>"Pouf!" scoffed Lan Ying, in unexpected raillery. "What do <i>you</i> know
  about women?"</p>

  <p>He nodded agreement to this charge, though he felt he might have debated
  the question successfully. It may have occurred to Lan Ying that this would
  be a suitable place to change the topic, for she immediately gave herself to
  an exultant appreciation of the natural beauty surrounding them.</p>

  <p>"How refreshing this must be for you," she was saying, "after such long,
  trying days in the hospital. It must grieve you dreadfully&mdash;all the
  miseries of the people."</p>

  <p>Jack's nod of assent was rather noncommittal. He disliked to pose as a
  sentimental altruist, much less a martyr.</p>

  <p>"The miseries of the people," he reflected, casually, "are all in the
  course of the doctor's daily work. He cannot let them grieve him. The more he
  is emotionally upset by these misfortunes the less able he is to relieve
  them. The patients and their families can be depended on to do the grieving.
  A doctor cannot wear his heart on his sleeve."</p>

  <p>The metaphor stirred Lan Ying's interest.</p>

  <p>"How funnee!" she exclaimed. "'His heart on his sleeve'."</p>

  <p>"Didn't you ever hear that before? It's an old stock saying with us. If a
  person is easily moved to pity or sympathy or affection we say that is
  wearing one's heart on one's sleeve."</p>

  <p>"And it is not considered good form to pity anybody?" she asked, with
  widened eyes. "And one should not show sympathy or affection?"</p>

  <p>"Depends on circumstances," Jack replied, judicially. "Pity is usually
  ruinous. One would think that so cheap a gift as pity could have no weight at
  all&mdash;either for good or bad; but it can do a lot of damage. And sympathy
  often accents troubles that would be much less painful if the people tried to
  forget them. And as for affection; well, that's quite another matter, but one
  has to be careful where one displays affection." He tried to make this sound
  dryly impersonal. Lan Ying's face was turned away, her eyes surveying the
  rippled lake.</p>

  <p>"You may think it strange," she said, slowly returning to him, "but I have
  much to learn about such things. In China we do not see many persons outside
  the family and a small circle of close friends. Even in the household, the
  men and women do not associate closely or confidentially. I was brought up
  with women. Perhaps I have been wearing my heart on my sleeve. When I like a
  friend verree much, I cannot help telling her so." She shook her head
  inquiringly. "One should not do that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," said Jack, reassuringly. "That's quite all right."</p>

  <p>Her eyes were serious as she searched his face with all the honest candour
  of a child.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;I must not say I like <i>you?"</i> she queried.</p>

  <p>He regarded her for a moment, smiled a little, and replied, slowly,
  "Well&mdash;if you were my sister&mdash;I think I might advise you not to say
  it; at least, not quite so&mdash;so directly."</p>

  <p>"Oh?" pursued Lan Ying. "If I were your sister, I should not tell you I
  liked you? How funnee!"</p>

  <p>"I think you misunderstood me. I meant&mdash;if you were my sister I
  should advise you not to say that to a man friend. He might take advantage of
  your frankness."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;<i>you</i> would not," she declared, looking him squarely in
  the eyes.</p>

  <p>"No, Lan Ying," returned Jack, resolutely. "You may say whatever you like
  to me. I'll understand. You can't help knowing that I like you, too, very
  much."</p>

  <p>"I am so glad," she said, happily. "To-night I shall write to my
  foster-mother and tell her I now have a good friend."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you will write to me too, occasionally," suggested Jack,
  privately reflecting that he was behaving rather badly. This affair must not
  go any farther, he kept saying to himself.</p>

  <p>"If you wish; but my letters will not be interesting. Nothing ever
  happens. It is so different with you. Your life is full of activity. You do
  so many kind deeds."</p>

  <p>Their conversation had been so uniquely forthright that Jack felt the
  necessity of qualifying her compliment to his altruism. He hoped he was not
  to be bracketed in her esteem as a grown-up Boy Scout. By mutual consent they
  sat down on a green knoll near the quiet water.</p>

  <p>"You do me too much credit, Lan Ying. I am not consciously performing kind
  deeds. Patients in the hospital are not there on my invitation, and my
  interest in them is professional. If they have other than physical troubles,
  that's too bad, but none of my business. The man who comes into the hospital
  with a spinal tumour may have any number of other things the matter with him,
  and they ought to be remedied; but, so far as I am concerned, he is just
  a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just a tumour," assisted Lan Ying, soberly.</p>

  <p>"Just a case," amended Jack. "Maybe I've been saying this the worse way.
  What I mean is: I am trying to do my job as well as I can, without dividing
  my attention between my professional duty and an emotional interest in the
  patient as a person."</p>

  <p>"I should think you would be missing a great deal of happiness that you
  are entitled to, Jack. After you have performed an operation that has made
  someone well again, he would be so grateful that almost anything you said to
  him would carry weight. I know," she added, "it would be true with
  me&mdash;if I had been sick, and you had made me well. You could advise me
  about anything, then; and I should listen."</p>

  <p>For an instant he had a recollection of the occasion when he had fancied
  her on the operating-table. It had been such a vivid experience that the
  memory sent a little shudder through him.</p>

  <p>"I appreciate your thinking that, Lan Ying," he said, "but you might get
  poor advice. Doctors aren't supposed to know anything much&mdash;outside
  their own field."</p>

  <p>"They ought to," persisted Lan Ying. "They have the best chance in the
  world to help people. I think it would be verree sad and dull
  business&mdash;just cutting into people&mdash;and sewing them up again. But
  it would not be sad or dull if you knew you were going to give them courage
  and direction, after they were on the way to health again. That would be
  wonderful!"</p>

  <p>Jack did not immediately reply. He had already stated his position in
  regard to the surgeon's task, and did not wish to defend it further.</p>

  <p>"Shall you be coming back again, sometime, to see Dr Cunningham?" Lan Ying
  was saying. Jack wondered whether Cunningham had occurred to her mind in
  connection with what she had said about the wider opportunities of his
  profession. For a moment he experienced a little surge of jealousy, the first
  rap of it that had ever come to him. His response to her query was so tardy
  that Lan Ying glanced up to interrogate his eyes. Turning to her, he extended
  his open hand into which she trustfully laid a small gloved one.</p>

  <p>"Lan Ying," he said, gently, "I am so fond of you that I mustn't do
  anything to make you unhappy. I know how much delight it would give me to see
  you often. But&mdash;as I have told you&mdash;I am a slave to my work. I want
  to be your friend, but I'm afraid my friendship will add very little to your
  happiness."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;may-bee&mdash;we will not see each other&mdash;any more?"
  she asked, in a tone that was barely audible.</p>

  <p>"You have been so honest with me, Lan Ying, that I must be sincere with
  you. I shouldn't be saying this," he went on, recklessly, "but nobody has
  ever&mdash;" He broke off, suddenly, freeing her hand. After a moment of
  struggle, he continued, resolutely steadying his voice. "My friendship
  is&mdash;is a poor thing. I shall not forget you. We will write to each
  other, sometimes," he finished, lamely.</p>

  <p>She took his hand in both of hers and pressed it warmly.</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean, Jack. May-bee I understand even better than you.
  Your life is all planned&mdash;and it is a verree courageous life&mdash;and
  there is no room in it for anybody or anything but your work. You have given
  up everything&mdash;so you might be a great scientist. And I should be most
  unhappy if our friendship worried you, or occupied your mind. But&mdash;it
  need not be so. We are both of us lonely people. To you, men and women are
  just broken machines that you must repair&mdash;day after day, night after
  night&mdash;all your life&mdash;until you die. Surely&mdash;a hard task. With
  me&mdash;I have no country, no interests, no happiness. We are both
  waifs&mdash;you and I." She paused. He felt that it was a critical moment.
  Steady! Steady! The firm grip that had kept his emotions&mdash;his
  passions&mdash;on a leash for years was still there. "And when I knew that
  you liked me a little," continued Lan Ying, "I wanted you for a friend. No
  one understands me&mdash;but you. And now you are afraid to like me; is it
  not so?" Her eyes were misty.</p>

  <p>"From now on, Lan Ying," replied Jack, a little huskily, "you and I are
  going to understand each other. It will be a peculiar friendship,
  because&mdash;because neither of us will expect anything of the
  other&mdash;but comradeship."</p>

  <p>"I am so glad," she said. "It will be verree nice. I shall do a
  water-colour for you to hang in your library. Would you like that?"</p>

  <p>"Please&mdash;and may I have a picture of you, Lan Ying?"</p>

  <p>"In my Chinese clothes, may-bee?"</p>

  <p>"In anything&mdash;so it's you."</p>

  <p>"Shall we go now?" she asked. "I must be at home when Claudia
  arrives."</p>

  <p>They retraced their steps slowly to the road, carefully avoiding a return
  to the subject of their personal relations. Jack opened the door of the car
  for her, and closed it with the sensation that he had no right to her, yet
  she seemed to belong to him. He opened the other door and stepped in.</p>

  <p>He tipped the ignition key and was on the point of spinning the engine,
  but he paused. "This has been the most delightful day I ever spent," he
  added. "Thank you, Lan Ying, for&mdash;for coming with me."</p>

  <p>She had tugged off her gloves, and now gave him her bare hand.</p>

  <p>"It has made me happy," she said, softly. "I shall be content to
  wait&mdash;a long, long time&mdash;until we meet again. I wonder"&mdash;she
  drew a regretful little sigh&mdash;"if we shall ever again be able to talk to
  each other&mdash;this way&mdash;apart from other people."</p>

  <p>"I hope so," said Jack, unsteadily. Then, impulsively, he slipped his arm
  about her and drew her close to him. She made a brief flutter of protest like
  a captured bird, just a breathless little "Oh!"&mdash;and relaxed in his
  arms, nestling her cheek against his shoulder. A whole minute passed. She
  stirred. Jack lifted her small hand and, bending over it, kissed it. Lan
  Ying's brooding eyes followed the hand, watching the caress with a smile on
  her parted lips. Their eyes met in a mutual confession that no words could
  have denied. She slowly disengaged her hand and, with eyes averted, softly
  pressed the back of it to her own lips.</p>

  <p>"Lan Ying"&mdash;Jack's voice was husky&mdash;"I haven't the slightest
  right to ask this of you&mdash;and if you don't want to, I'll
  understand&mdash;but it might be a very long time before we see each
  other&mdash;" He leaned toward her, entreatingly.</p>

  <p>For a long moment she searched his eyes studiously, each of them
  separately, back and forth; inspected his lips gravely; returned to his eyes;
  smiled, tremulously, and said, with a childish little shake of the head, "It
  would not be the wrong thing&mdash;for me&mdash;to do?"</p>

  <p>The crow's-feet at his temples deepened.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't ask me to decide that for you, Lan Ying."</p>

  <p>She turned her face away and meditated on her problem for a little while,
  a slow flush creeping up her cheek. Then she returned to him and said, shyly,
  "You may think it funnee, Jack, but I never kissed anyone, in my life, but my
  sister&mdash;once&mdash;and little Teddy. May-bee I shall not do it verree
  well."</p>

  <p>He put his arms around her and drew her to him, kissed her on the adorable
  black fringe and the white forehead, laid his cheek against hers, finding it
  comfortingly warm. One small hand trustingly circled his neck. Her eyes were
  closed.</p>

  <p>With a racing heart, he found her lips, and she
  responded&mdash;tentatively, honestly. Then, for an ecstatic moment, a great
  wave seemed to engulf them both. They clung to each other, startled by the
  discovery of the force of their emotions.</p>

  <p>Beaven was more than startled: he suddenly realized that he was terrified.
  He had never dreamed that he&mdash;the controlled, scientific mind and
  pulse&mdash;could be so shaken. With an effort, almost of violence, he
  released the girl, strove to recover his self-control.</p>

  <p>There was a moment of silence between them. Then Beaven, his voice
  unsteady, in spite of his effort to control it, whispered, "Thank you,
  darling. You are very good to me. But&mdash;you mustn't ever let me do it
  again. I have no claim on you."</p>

  <p>She laid her palm against his cheek.</p>

  <p>"Please do not be sorree, Jack. It was my own decision. And&mdash;it was
  my own desire. We will not do it&mdash;any more. Shall we go now? Claudia
  will be wondering."</p>

  <p>He pushed the starter-button, and the roadster moved slowly into the
  road.</p>

  <p>"I never thought anything like this could ever happen to me," murmured
  Jack.</p>

  <p>Lan Ying was stroking her gloves on to her slim fingers.</p>

  <p>"Nothing has happened to you," she said, reassuringly. "You will now go
  back to your destiny, and I shall go back to mine. But&mdash;we shall be
  friends for ever; is it not so?"</p>

  <p>Jack's eyes were on the road, as the car gathered speed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, sincerely, "it is so."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TUBBY was barking dictations to his stampeded Miss Romney
  when, on Wednesday morning early, Jack showed up in response to a peremptory
  telephone call. To his surprise, the office was folding up. Minions from the
  administrative office ventured in and scurried out. The much-travelled bags
  were piled beside the door. Jack sauntered across to the window, lounged on
  to the sill, and waited.</p>

  <p>"That's all," declaimed Tubby. "You may go. I want to talk to Dr Beaven.
  Call a taxi. I'll be down in ten minutes. And send up an orderly for my
  luggage." Apparently Tubby was going abroad, if his baggage was luggage.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," squeaked the girl, as she went out.</p>

  <p>"Now, Beaven&mdash;" Jack took the inquisitorial chair and Tubby clapped
  on his derby hat to add a touch of finality to his remarks. "As you see, I'm
  about to leave. Sudden decision. The Regents insist on my attending this
  Neurological Congress in Vienna."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you can go, sir," said Jack.</p>

  <p>"Not sure that I want to," gruffed Tubby. "Not sure it is a good time for
  me to be off the campus."</p>

  <p>"I'll do my best, sir, while you're gone," said Jack.</p>

  <p>"There's more at stake this time. Perhaps you know what I mean." Tubby
  scowled searchingly into Jack's baffled eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I don't, sir."</p>

  <p>"That's odd. Do you mean to tell me you've been on a fishing trip with
  Cunningham, and he didn't tell you about his lecture assignment?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. Not a word."</p>

  <p>Tubby lighted a cigarette and seemed uncertain where to begin with an
  explanation.</p>

  <p>"You're going to see a lot more of Cunningham," he growled.</p>

  <p>"That's good, sir."</p>

  <p>"Quite to the contrary, that's bad, sir," mocked Tubby. "It is quite
  impossible that you should have been in intimate contact with Cunningham and
  not be affected somewhat by his damn'-fool ideas. They sound reasonable when
  he states them. They would not be so insidious if Cunningham was a
  second-rater. But that's the trouble. Cunningham is not a mere evangelist. He
  is an informed pathologist and an excellent surgeon. But&mdash;and here's the
  difficulty&mdash;there's only one Bill Cunningham, so far as I know. For the
  rank and file of doctors, his brand of sentimentality would be ruinous."
  Tubby pushed back his chair and began pacing the floor. "Ruinous!" he
  repeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," agreed Jack, honestly.</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;here is the problem. You will recall that we have a new member
  of the Board of Regents, Mr Denman of Chicago, who has recently been
  appointed to the committee on Medical College affairs. Just why, I'm sure I
  don't know. I fail to see how his gift of one hundred thousand
  dollars&mdash;pumped out of an Oklahoma oil-field&mdash;qualifies him to
  select the special lecturers for this institution. Nor do I know why the
  other members of the committee have listened to him. Perhaps they feel that
  whoever pays the piper should be permitted to call the tune. In my opinion,
  this Denman&mdash;however generous&mdash;is about as well fitted to suggest
  policies to the Medical College as I am to be&mdash;the"&mdash;Tubby groped
  for an assignment appropriately remote&mdash;"the Maharajah of Lickapoo."</p>

  <p>Jack considered saying, "You might do that quite nicely, sir," but
  prudently refrained.</p>

  <p>"Denman began it innocuously enough," continued Tubby, clipping his words,
  "by suggesting a series of lectures by some man of outstanding reputation as
  a general practitioner; something fresh from the field. Everybody agreed to
  that. The new member should be treated amiably. He'd come through with a lot
  of money. Perhaps he'd respond to an encore." Tubby's tone was bitter.
  "Then&mdash;properly encouraged&mdash;the fellow amended his own informal
  resolution to include an occasional clinic, and a week or two of making the
  rounds of the hospital with the interns and seniors in tow, showing them how
  to talk to the patients. That wasn't so good, but nobody debated the matter.
  I think they all assumed that the appointment would be left to the discretion
  of the faculty. It would have been no more than common courtesy."</p>

  <p>Jack stroked his jaw to efface a grin. "The faculty"&mdash;Huh! Tubby had
  assumed that he himself would make the appointment.</p>

  <p>"Then!" shouted Tubby. "Then!&mdash;with all this agreed to, the bounder
  suggests that Cunningham&mdash;of all people on earth&mdash;should be asked
  to lead the cubs around, and show 'em how to hold hands and coo!"</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;they approved?" inquired Jack, suspecting he knew the
  answer.</p>

  <p>"They approved&mdash;the asses! And of course Cunningham will accept. Why
  shouldn't he? Honourable assignment. He can't very well refuse. This Denman,
  it appears, was popped into the hospital up there with an emergency
  gall-bladder or something, a year ago. Cunningham operated. He could and
  would do a good job. Denman liked him, naturally enough. Couldn't be blamed
  for that. Everybody likes Cunningham. I like him. The story is that Denman
  sent Cunningham a whopping fee, which he returned with a modest bill,
  suggesting that the rest of the money be presented to the hospital. And the
  tale sounds authentic. That's about what Cunningham would do. Upright fellow.
  But&mdash;not the man for this special lectureship."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you have said that, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No. This Denman is a pretty smooth individual. He had taken the pains to
  remark that Cunningham and I were old friends and classmates; it went without
  saying&mdash;and then he proceeded to say it&mdash;that I would be glad
  enough to see this honour bestowed upon this comrade of my youth. If he'd
  gagged me, he couldn't have taken out better insurance against my
  objections." Tubby, having boiled over, resumed his seat. His tone became
  almost confidential.</p>

  <p>"Now, Beaven, you will have to do your best, in an indirect way, to
  counteract the influence of this genial Boy Scout from Saginaw Bay. Don't
  offend him. Don't deride him. Don't make open war on him. But see to it that
  these youngsters are kept steady." Tubby glared a threat. "I hope I'll not
  find, when I come back here in November, that the whole school has gone in
  for faith-healing!"</p>

  <p>"I'll try to obey your wishes, sir," promised Jack.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you'd better. You have come into a very responsible position,
  and you know how you got there. I practically went on your bond when the
  Regents thought you were too young for this faculty appointment. Don't let me
  down.... And now&mdash;there's one more thing."</p>

  <p>A grizzled orderly had shuffled in. Tubby pointed to the bags and motioned
  him out.</p>

  <p>"One thing more. Yesterday, I understand, we took in another polio. It's
  getting late in the season for polio, and this may be the last of it. I hope
  so."</p>

  <p>"But I don't have to do anything about that, do I?"</p>

  <p>"Not unless you're interested. It's not your job&mdash;no. But you are
  better equipped than anyone else within five hundred miles to do some
  valuable research. If I could be sure we'd have some more polio&mdash;enough
  polio to offer a fairly wide range of clinical material&mdash;I shouldn't
  think of leaving."</p>

  <p>The bald statement made Jack wince. He had been trained to despise and
  distrust sentiment, but this comment was a bit too cold-blooded, even for
  him.</p>

  <p>"You have a heavy schedule," continued Tubby, obviously unaware of Jack's
  reaction. "But if there is an opportunity for laboratory investigation of
  this thing, don't miss it. Don't miss it, even if you have to slight
  something else. Give it the best you've got!" He glanced at his watch. "I
  must go," he snapped. "Tell the Romney to lock my desk and give you the
  keys." With a jerky little nod in Jack's general vicinity, he caught up his
  camel's-hair coat and brief-case, and marched out, leaving the door open
  behind him.</p>

  <p>Hooking a rangy leg over the arm of his chair, Jack waited for the office
  clerk's return. He was glad the interview had occurred. It had cleared his
  mind of perplexity. It had helped him to the consolidation of a precarious
  position. He knew now where his duty lay. Cunningham had upset him.
  Cunningham had played the very devil with his mental habits. Now Tubby had
  come to the rescue of the jeopardized scientific attitude. Bill Cunningham,
  performing all manner of good and gracious deeds along the shoreline of
  Saginaw Bay, was an admirable friend and an undeniably useful citizen. But
  Cunningham, teaching his sentimental bedside manner to a lot of
  impressionable young medics, was another person altogether.
  Tubby&mdash;confound him&mdash;was right about that.</p>

  <p>As for the prospect of laboratory polio, that wasn't much of an issue.
  There wouldn't be any more infantile paralysis; not after midsummer.</p>

  <p>Pallid little Romney's high heels were pattering in. Jack regarded her
  indifferently as she cleared off the top of Tubby's desk.</p>

  <p>"Dr Forrester said I am to be your secretary now, while he's away," she
  reported, with a twitchy little smile.</p>

  <p>"That so?" replied Jack, absently. "Well&mdash;you may go, and have
  yourself a vacation&mdash;until Monday."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," she said, anxiously. "Will it be all right, do you
  think?" Her puzzled eyes doubted it. "Do I have to ask anyone else?"</p>

  <p>"You may if you wish," said Jack dryly. "Ask anybody. Ask the girl at the
  switchboard. Ask the orderlies. But&mdash;you said you were to be my
  secretary and I have told you to take a vacation until Monday."</p>

  <p>She made a pathetic little grimace as if she were about to cry. Somehow it
  didn't fit in with the starchy permanent, the snugly modish grey gown, the
  competent business air. Jack sat up straight and regarded her with
  interest.</p>

  <p>"What ails you?" he queried. "Somebody get your goat?"</p>

  <p>Romney twisted the end of her nose with a small handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I haven't had a goat," she replied, thickly, "for almost two years."</p>

  <p>Jack grinned.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been working here?" he asked. "I forget."</p>

  <p>"Almost two years."</p>

  <p>"It's a curious coincidence," drawled Jack.</p>

  <p>Miss Romney ventured a half-hysterical chuckle.</p>

  <p>"I needn't tell <i>you</i> anything about a lost goat," she retorted. "But
  maybe you don't care about yours. You have your guinea pigs and your
  monkeys." Brittle Miss Romney had the traditional posture and mood of the
  admittedly licked who back up against the wall resolved to sell out dearly.
  Jack was amused but he admired her. Her passion spent, she collapsed into
  Tubby's chair. "Now you can fire me if you want to," she muttered,
  ruefully.</p>

  <p>"Romney," he said, soberly, "you have had a hard day and you're upset. I'd
  much rather see you blow off at the whistle than explode and shatter the
  building. I cannot remember anything you have said. Run along now and come
  back Monday morning. While you're gone, you might look for your goat. A few
  days of fresh air and a change of scenery would be good for you."</p>

  <p>"I'll send my sister," said the girl. "She needs it more than I do."</p>

  <p>Jack was about to say, "As you like", when the Cunningham influence
  prompted him to inquire, "What's <i>her</i> trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Our mother has a cancer, Dr Beaven. She requires constant care. Lou is
  practically a prisoner. I'm gone all day, and Lou carries the load."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;Lou does the nursing and you earn the living?"</p>

  <p>Romney nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's pretty tough," said Jack. "I'm afraid you don't have very much
  fun."</p>

  <p>"Some people weren't meant to have fun," rejoined Romney. "Their job is
  cut out for them."</p>

  <p>"There's a certain satisfaction, though, in courageously doing one's duty,
  don't you think?" Jack remembered what Edith Cunningham had said about the
  value of a challenge to bravery.</p>

  <p>"I expect there is for <i>you,"</i> sighed Romney. "You work hard all the
  time and never have any fun; but you don't actually <i>have</i> to do it. It
  isn't brave when you <i>have</i> to do it."</p>

  <p>"Nobody <i>has</i> to do <i>anything,"</i> declared Jack. "You&mdash;for
  example. You could run away from it all, if you wanted to."</p>

  <p>"But I'd have to take myself along, and it wouldn't be any fun." Her eyes
  lighted with a sudden smile that made her almost pretty. "I expect that's
  what keeps <i>you</i> from running off," she ventured.</p>

  <p>Jack nodded a tentative approval and rose to go.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad we had this talk," he said. "You're very good stuff, Romney, if
  you don't mind my saying so."</p>

  <p>Romney's eyes were swimming and her chin trembled a little.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," she said, unsteadily. The tears were rolling down her cheeks
  now, but she managed a grateful smile. "I'm glad to have made your
  acquaintance, Dr Beaven."</p>

  <p>Jack softly closed the door behind him. That was an odd thing for Romney
  to say. Perhaps she was embarrassed. He'd been seeing her in Tubby's office
  every day for&mdash;how long was it? Almost two years. "Glad to have made
  your acquaintance," eh? He frowned, as the light broke. Tubby was right.
  Express sympathy or human interest, and presently you find yourself all
  milled up with people's private predicaments. Then you can't keep your mind
  on the business you're being paid to do. Little Romney lived a dog's life,
  but it was no affair of his. And the minute he shows a glimmer of concern,
  she insists that he has become another fellow than the one she'd known. "Glad
  to have made your acquaintance." Damned impudence; that's what it was. That's
  what you got for hobnobbing with the Cunninghams.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>On his swift drive back to the University, yesterday, the most recent
  appointee on the Medical College faculty had been a seriously perplexed young
  man.</p>

  <p>As he had sped along, only vaguely conscious of the colourful landscape
  that had filled him with delight a few days ago, his mental tumult suggested
  a complete reorganization of his aims. He resented this proposal as absurd
  but he could not dismiss it.</p>

  <p>It was quite evident that he should not have gone on this fishing
  excursion. That's what came of abandoning your programme, even for a day.
  This brief vacation, which was to have been a pleasantly restful interlude,
  now appeared in immediate retrospect as a distressing intrusion upon his
  peace. He was to have come back refreshed. Instead, he was returning
  bewildered, asking himself how much of his life-plan was any longer tenable;
  how many of his professional duties required a drastic reappraisal.</p>

  <p>In the first place&mdash;overtopping all his other problems&mdash;there
  was Audrey. Why hadn't he been sensible enough to let that memory fade into
  oblivion? Ever since that first chance meeting on the stairway in the
  hospital, she had been much on his mind. But in the natural course of events
  he would, he knew, have forgotten her; or, not forgetting, cherish the dream
  as the most dear of his many might-have-beens. As matters now stood, Audrey
  Hilton was in a fair way to monopolize his mind. She had said, "Nothing has
  happened to you, Jack. You will go back to your destiny, and I shall return
  to mine." And that would certainly be a moving speech as the curtain slowly
  descended on the third act of a stage-play, after which the sacrificial
  offerings could retire to their dressing-rooms, scrub off the paint, put on
  their street clothes, and saunter out together for a snack.</p>

  <p>But something <i>had</i> happened to him. He was returning to his
  "destiny", yes; but it wouldn't be the same destiny. One thing was clear, and
  in this he felt he had Audrey's full sympathy and approval: they would not
  marry. They would be friends for ever; that would be all. And that would be
  torture. He would go back to his eighteen-hour-per-day job bearing this extra
  burden; facing more exacting responsibilities than ever before, and with a
  mind distracted.</p>

  <p>Momentarily the recollection of yesterday's enchanted hour swept his heart
  with ecstasy. Every instant of that glorified moment was indelible. He could,
  he believed, have disciplined himself to forget the Audrey Hilton he had met
  at the hospital, and the Audrey Hilton he had talked with at the Livingstone
  and at the Cunninghams'; but the kiss would remain an indestructible memory.
  Perhaps the easy and sensible way to deal with it was to toss all of his
  life-programme aside and let this new motive have the right of way.</p>

  <p>Having luxuriated in this prodigal thought for a few miles, his
  hard-earned mental habits would reassert their claims, and demand a hearing.
  Did not this love-smitten Jack Beaven, who was toying with the idea of
  marriage, a home, a family, social obligations, domestic problems, owe
  something to that other Beaven who had lived like a monastic and worked like
  a slave to win the distinctions that had now come to him? Why had he been
  asked, at thirty-one, to become a member of the faculty? An unusual
  achievement of this sort should be valued no more for what it had brought
  than what it had cost! And Tubby&mdash;hateful as he had been&mdash;had
  engineered his early arrival into a place of preferment. What would Tubby
  think? What would Tubby say? What would Tubby have a perfect right to do when
  he learned that a girl had stepped in to claim part of his time and most of
  his mind?</p>

  <p>And then&mdash;there was Cunningham. Last night, in the library, over
  their pipes, Cunningham had said some things that had impressed him
  deeply.</p>

  <p>"Leave out the human-interest element," Cunningham had declared, "and a
  surgeon might as well be working in a garage. When you stop to think about
  it, Beaven, there's a good many points of similarity between a man and an
  automobile. Gasoline and blood serve the same purpose. Plenty of likeness
  between lymphatics and lubrication; the ignition system and the lungs;
  radiator and kidneys. The car also has eyes that get out of whack and feet
  needing a good deal of attention."</p>

  <p>"And a larynx," Jack had added, solemnly, "suffering from overwork."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. And there isn't much difference between Jack Beaven, in white
  duck, working on a bad kidney&mdash;and Chuck Billings, in greasy overalls,
  working on a bad water-pump, except that Beaven has an opportunity to add
  something of nobility to his patient."</p>

  <p>"And Chuck," assisted Jack, obligingly, "hasn't anything to show for his
  work but six dollars and fifty cents."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure about that, Jack." Cunningham puffed thoughtfully for a
  long moment. "It just happens that I didn't invent 'Chuck Billings' to serve
  my little homily. I know Chuck Billings very well. He operates the garage
  where I go for repairs. I took a busted appendix out of Chuck, about five
  years ago. He was sure he was going to die, and I felt, too, that his
  prediction wasn't a bad guess. He didn't have much to fall back on. He'd been
  very intemperate. Very improvident. Not much good. Head over heels in debt.
  Floating bills all over town. Well&mdash;one day, when he was burning up, and
  felt that he was as good as dead, and ought to be collecting time-and-a-half
  for overtime, he wanted to tell me what sort of fellow he'd be if he got
  well."</p>

  <p>"When the Devil is sick, he'd be a saint," recalled Jack,
  sardonically.</p>

  <p>"Exactly! And that's the time to let him commit himself. So&mdash;we
  brought up one of the girls from the hospital office, who had a notary's
  power and seal, and we let Chuck dictate a new constitution for himself, to
  be effective when and if he ever asked for his shoes. He was talking his head
  off, anyhow; so he might as well be talking about that."</p>

  <p>Edith Cunningham had appeared in the doorway at this juncture.</p>

  <p>"Intruding?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't," said her husband, pointing his pipe-stem at the davenport.
  "I was telling Jack about Chuck Billings."</p>

  <p>"Famous story," murmured Edith. "Jack will love it."</p>

  <p>Doubtless she had called him Jack because Cunningham had just done so. All
  the same, it had warned him. He liked her. She was sound.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;not to elaborate this too much&mdash;Chuck got well, as you
  have probably forecast; and, having had quite a bit of experience with
  death-bed confessions and promises, I thought I would make a little
  experiment. When it became fairly clear that the angels weren't in urgent
  need of Chuck, I mailed his dictated aspirations to a bang-up good printer in
  Detroit, and ordered a copy&mdash;thirty inches by eighteen&mdash;to be done
  in a dignified Gothic type, with art initials in red. It was a beautiful job.
  I had it framed under glass. And on the day we turned Chuck loose, I gave it
  to him. He was sitting on the edge of the bed, grinning. His wife was there,
  waiting to drive him home. I said, 'Chuck, you have been such a gallant
  patient that I've decided to present you with a certificate. This entitles
  you to be&mdash;from now on&mdash;a very important fellow in this town. I
  hope you will accept it, with my best wishes, and enjoy all the new rights
  and privileges it offers you.' Chuck gingerly took the thing in both hands,
  balanced it on his knee, and stared at it in astonishment. His lips
  soundlessly formed the words as he read on with widening eyes. Mrs Billings,
  pleased at her husband's distinction, and bursting with curiosity, hooked an
  arm over his shoulder and surveyed the formidable document with a stunned
  expression of incredulity. It was ever so much more impressive in
  ecclesiastical print than it could have been in pen-writing. Chuck swallowed,
  a couple of times, rather noisily, as he reviewed his legally attested vows
  to pursue a new life. When he had finished, he handed the thing to his wife,
  and said, sheepishly, 'Thanks, Doc.' For a long time he sat staring at the
  floor. Then he looked up, and blurted out, huskily, 'By God&mdash;I said it!
 ... By God&mdash;I'll do it!... O.K., Doc!'... Well"&mdash;Cunningham
  whipped out his handkerchief and blew a strident blast&mdash;"I couldn't stay
  there any longer, so I bade them a hasty farewell and got out."</p>

  <p>"And then&mdash;?" Jack had asked, not very optimistically.</p>

  <p>Cunningham straightened from his lounging posture in the big leather
  chair, tapped a finger on Jack's knee, and replied, "Chuck Billings took that
  thing down town&mdash;<i>and hung it up in his garage!"</i></p>

  <p>"And it's there now!" declared Edith, proudly. "All sorts of people,
  having business there, drift over to the wall where it hangs, and read it,
  mostly without comment. Sometimes they mutter, 'Well, I'll be damned.' But
  nobody laughs."</p>

  <p>"Of course," conceded Cunningham, "we really had a little something to
  work on in Chuck's case. People like him. And they trust him. Very personable
  chap. If he'd had a little more education and a better background, he might
  have gone far."</p>

  <p>"He has gone far, Bill," put in Edith, "considering where he started
  from."</p>

  <p>"The Rotary Club took him in, a couple of years ago," continued her
  husband.</p>

  <p>Jack felt he must have grinned a little, unwittingly, for Cunningham
  interrupted himself to defend his remark.</p>

  <p>"I know," he said, "how Tubby would sneer at that. It has become the
  fashion to poke fun at these luncheon clubs. Well&mdash;there's many a
  selfish old codger who has been either inspired or shamed into something like
  sound social behaviour by such organizations. I'll bet if the citizens of
  this country would turn the Government over to these derided boobs in the
  luncheon clubs&mdash;and let them run it for a while&mdash;there'd
  be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut, Bill," advised Edith. "Go on&mdash;about Chuck."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;the Rotary Club took Chuck in. Proudest moment of his life, I
  guess. They put him on a committee to recondition delinquent boys who've done
  time in the Reformatory and are consequently in need of reformation. He
  always has three or four of these fellows working for him. Last time I was in
  there, I said, 'Chuck, how are your problem boys making out, on the average?'
  And he rubbed his head with the greasiest hand in town and said, 'Well, Doc;
  it's this way. So long as we make 'em think they're doing something
  important, they play the game pretty straight. If I say to Pat Reegan, "Now
  this is a darned ticklish job, Pat, and if you can't do it be sure to call
  for me," Pat comes through with some fine work.'"</p>

  <p>"That's the whole thing; isn't it, Bill? The challenge!" Edith's eyes were
  thoughtful. "Isn't that what keeps them lined up?"</p>

  <p>"That's what keeps us <i>all</i> lined up, dear," he answered. "The
  challenge to do something worth doing! The feeling that something is expected
  of us! I know this sounds trite, Jack. Sentimental small-town stuff, if you
  like. Maybe, with your highly specialized interests, it seems mawkish, moony,
  and annoyingly unprofessional. But if&mdash;while I'm taking a bad appendix
  out of Chuck Billings&mdash;I can put an idea into him that makes him useful
  and respected, I'm willing to be a hick."</p>

  <p>The telephone had rung, at that point, and Cunningham went to answer
  it.</p>

  <p>Jack said, "Has he done this sort of thing often, Mrs Cunningham?"</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;printing Chuck's promises? No&mdash;not just that way. I
  think the occasion usually suggests the method. He finds it a fascinating
  game; studies his patients' minds, learns their history, discovers their
  vulnerable spots, and plans his attack like a military strategist debating
  whether to launch an offensive by land, water, or air. Mostly he appeals to
  their courage, I think; imputes to them a gallant spirit; assumes that they
  are strong; makes them believe it. He gets a great thrill out of his
  experiments. Of course he loves surgery and his work in the laboratory. They
  demand a certain amount of skill. But&mdash;the other thing&mdash;revamping
  people's mental attitudes&mdash;that's where my husband's heart is."</p>

  <p>Cunningham had appeared at the door, hat in hand.</p>

  <p>"I'll be out for an hour," he announced. "Hospital."</p>

  <p>"Want me to go along?" asked Jack.</p>

  <p>"No, you stay here and talk to Edith."</p>

  <p>After the front door had slammed, Jack said, "Your husband is a remarkable
  fellow. I never knew anyone just like him."</p>

  <p>"Have a good time with him at the lake?" asked Edith, casually.</p>

  <p>"Excellent."</p>

  <p>"Bill says he told you Audrey Hilton's story. You like her very much;
  don't you? I could see that you did."</p>

  <p>He had not been prepared for this cool inquisition. In any other tone or
  mood it might have sounded impertinent. Edith was asking him if he liked
  Audrey in much the same voice she might have used had she asked him if he
  liked horses or Beethoven or steamed clams.</p>

  <p>"Very much indeed," he had replied, frankly.</p>

  <p>"That's nice," approved Edith. "You two should have a very happy life
  together, I think. You have so much to present to each other; your
  distinction, her charm; your ambition, her serenity; your&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do not expect ever to marry, Mrs Cunningham," Jack had interposed. "The
  nature of my work does not permit it. Audrey and I have talked it all over,
  frankly."</p>

  <p>"Oh? So soon?" Edith's brows expressed amused surprise. "Well, you
  certainly haven't let much grass grow since you met her. How deliriously
  funny! You two blessed things talked it all over, and decided not to marry!
  Now wasn't that heroic of you both; especially you!" She laughed.</p>

  <p>"Sorry if it sounded heroic," Jack had countered. "I'm not given to
  heroics. We were just facing facts. I don't think either of us felt
  martyred."</p>

  <p>"Don't be miffed," entreated Edith. "But you are so dreadfully serious,
  Jack. You invite teasing, and it's hard to resist." She suddenly sobered.
  "Please don't think I'm indifferent to your passion for work. I can guess
  what it has cost you to be where you are. I am sure you didn't arrive at it
  by self-indulgence. But isn't it possible"&mdash;she half-closed her eyes,
  thoughtfully&mdash;"isn't it possible that your single-minded devotion to
  your work has become something of an idiosyncrasy? You've made a lot of cruel
  self-sacrifices. You're proud of them. You have a right to be. You love your
  scars. They identify you&mdash;and that's what everybody strives for;
  identifying marks; something more interesting than mere finger-prints.
  Perhaps you never actually strutted up to a mirror and said, 'You're the man
  who's going to be remembered for having given up everything to Science;
  wedded to her, renouncing all others and cleaving only unto her till death do
  you part.' But&mdash;that has been your purpose and your pride. If I'm wrong,
  please correct me."</p>

  <p>"That's one way of saying it, I suppose," admitted Jack.</p>

  <p>"And now a bright and lovely girl has tapped at your heart, but you
  haven't room for her because you think your heart is already occupied. I
  think you're mistaken. It's your head that's fully occupied; not your heart.
  You've cultivated your intellect at the expense of your emotions. Audrey
  would be good for you."</p>

  <p>"As a loyal friend&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>Edith smiled knowingly, and relaxing from her argument lounged negligently
  into the corner of the davenport.</p>

  <p>"I should like to make a bet with you, Dr John Wesley Beaven."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not about that," he protested.</p>

  <p>"If I can't bet, let me at least prophesy. I'll give you and Audrey a year
  to find out how silly you are."</p>

  <p>"Are you a pretty good prophet?" Jack grinned, dryly.</p>

  <p>"One of the best. Positively uncanny&mdash;in romantic matters. First time
  I ever saw Bill Cunningham I mentally branded him as my personal property.
  Went home and told my mother I was as good as married."</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about it," insisted Jack, thankful for the digression.</p>

  <p>"It was at a concert&mdash;Chicago Symphony Orchestra&mdash;in Detroit.
  Bill was an intern then. He had brought Tubby Forrester with him, hoping to
  distract his mind from his trouble. Tubby had just lost his girl."</p>

  <p>"Girl?" echoed Jack, incredulously. "Tubby ever have a girl?"</p>

  <p>"Very much so," declared Edith.</p>

  <p>"I can't picture Tubby in love with anybody. What happened? Wouldn't she
  have him?"</p>

  <p>Edith sat for a moment meditating a reply.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll let Bill tell you," she said.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Tubby's final instructions had the effect of stiffening Jack's resistance
  to the mellowing influence of Audrey and the Cunninghams. Back in the old
  routine, it was inevitable that his accustomed mental states should prevail.
  In his effort to deal vigorously with the sentimental considerations that had
  briefly given him pause, he made things even rougher than he had planned for
  his classes in Anatomy.</p>

  <p>Tubby had been intolerant toward all but the most promising. Jack had
  decided to be a little more considerate of the backward and unself-confident.
  For the first few days the young professor made a point of being merciful to
  the sluggish. He answered their foolish questions politely, dealt kindly with
  their assininities, and refrained from disclosing the depth of his
  exasperation over the defectiveness of their pre-medic training, a distinct
  departure from the tradition of that lecture-hall where Tubby had so
  frequently inquired&mdash;in a frenzied screech&mdash;whether the high
  schools had all stopped teaching elementary Physiology. Jack tried to be
  patient and conciliatory, but it was hard work. If you put up your whip, the
  lazy nags slowed to a walk.</p>

  <p>Among those who gave evidence of sound scholarship and a willingness to
  work, there was one student to whom Beaven could give any amount of special
  attention with the full approval of the entire class. This was a good-looking
  and affable Chinese named Abbott, who had made a favourable impression on the
  first day by quaintly accounting for the incongruous name under which he
  registered.</p>

  <p>The circumstances had been droll. At the first roll-call when, in response
  to the name "Abbott", the young Chinese had stood at attention, Beaven had
  stared at him with such candid astonishment that the class had laughed
  good-naturedly, Mr Abbott himself grinning broadly. Without waiting for
  interrogation, the suave Oriental had volunteered to explain.</p>

  <p>"Professor Beaven"&mdash;he pronounced it "Beeven", which widened the
  general smile&mdash;"I wish to say"&mdash;Abbott made a courtly
  bow&mdash;"that the name of my family in China is 'Ng'. I brought this name
  with me to college in America, but it was difficult for my new friends to
  speak. My teachers and classmates could not believe there was such a name.
  Some thought I was taking them for what you call 'the ride'. In a bank I was
  asked what the letters 'N.G.' meant on the bottom of my cheque. It appeared
  that in America this was an unhappy symbol denoting that something was wrong.
  So, in my sophomore year"&mdash;he paused apologetically&mdash;"but perhaps I
  am taking too much time with the unimportant story of my name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By no means!" declared young Dr Beaven. "We have heard nothing more
  interesting than this in a dog's age. Kindly proceed, Mr Abbott&mdash;and do
  not feel hurried." The class was delighted.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," said Abbott, bowing. "So, in my sophomore year, I
  changed my name to one less embarrassing."</p>

  <p>"Quite justifiable," approved Dr Beaven. "Perhaps you may be willing to
  confide why, among all the names you had access to, you chose 'Abbott'."</p>

  <p>"With pleasure, sir. I had observed two facts about class-rolls.
  Frequently the students were seated alphabetically, which placed the 'A's'
  near the teacher."</p>

  <p>"I was not aware," drawled Beaven, with a quiet amusement at once shared
  by the class, "that this was considered a favourable location. In my own
  student days it was often thought an inconvenience."</p>

  <p>"The Chinese eye," explained Abbott, "is usually myopic. We like to be
  close to the desk, especially when experiments are demonstrated. But, sir,
  there was also another reason why it is good for the foreigner to be at the
  top of the roll-call. When something new or difficult is proposed, the
  foreigner&mdash;if called upon first&mdash;will be pardoned if he commits a
  blunder; because, being a foreigner, he knows no better. But if he is asked
  the question after many of his classmates have&mdash;have&mdash;what you call
  'muffed it'&mdash;the professor, by that time, is so peeved that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Abbott was drowned out by the laughter.</p>

  <p>"One often hears vague references," commented Beaven, when order had been
  restored, "to the wisdom of the East without realizing to what practical
  purposes this sagacity may be devoted. I feel, Mr Abbott, that you have added
  something important to the science of applied psychology. May I venture to
  speak for the class when I say that we all bid you a most cordial
  welcome?"</p>

  <p>There was spontaneous applause. Abbott bowed deeply three times, twice to
  his young professor and again to his classmates. He had made a nice place for
  himself and nobody was jealous.</p>

  <p>"Hereafter," added Beaven, when the applause had subsided, "you may sit in
  the front row, Mr Abbott, and claim all the privileges and penalties thereto
  pertaining." Everybody liked this. The episode had been a pleasant interlude.
  Abbott was in a fair way to become the class mascot, and Beaven's stock had
  risen.</p>

  <p>With this salutary introduction, it was natural that the Chinese could
  receive special attention from his Anatomy teacher without exciting anyone's
  envy; and when, presently, Abbott began displaying an extraordinary talent in
  the laboratory, Beaven's marked interest in him was a thing to be
  expected.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew that Dr Beaven had any other reason for giving Abbott so much
  personal oversight. The secret was comparatively safe. Everything Chinese had
  suddenly taken on a glamorous significance. Never having thought about the
  mind of China with any more concern than he had for the rings of Saturn, the
  brilliant young neurologist found himself presented with a brand-new,
  age-old, fascinatingly mysterious field of investigation.</p>

  <p>Bill Cunningham had declared that any American who married Audrey Hilton,
  with any expectation of their mutual happiness, would have to "go Chinese".
  It was not Jack Beaven's purpose to inform himself about China with this end
  in view. He was not going to marry Audrey Hilton: that was definitely
  understood. He and the adorable Lan Ying had resolved upon a comradeship:
  that was all. But to add interest to this relation it was important, he felt,
  that he should orient himself. The more he knew about China, the more
  pleasure they would find in their correspondence.</p>

  <p>One Saturday morning, late in October, Beaven had come into the anatomical
  laboratory on some research errand of his own; and, noticing his pet Chinese
  industriously at work on a head, strolled over to his table for a friendly
  word with him. Although aware that Abbott had a neat sense of humour, Jack's
  talks with him had been consistently serious and business-like. To-day he
  ventured a bit of facetiousness.</p>

  <p>"I am told," said Beaven, lounging on to a stool beside the table, "that
  the Mongolian oral structure differs in some respects from the Caucasian.
  It's rather a pity we do not have one of your deceased countrymen in here for
  your benefit."</p>

  <p>Abbott shook his head and grinned mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"The Chink," he observed, "esteems his carcase more highly than the
  Yank."</p>

  <p>"Why is that?" asked Beaven.</p>

  <p>"Because your Yankee goes to heaven when he dies. He gets a new body. It
  is not important to him what they do with his old one." Abbott laid his
  instruments aside and seemed prepared to pursue the philosophical topic if he
  had the slightest encouragement.</p>

  <p>"You don't anticipate survival, then?" Jack queried.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, sir; but not after the Christian manner. When you die, sir, the
  angels say, 'Here comes the good Dr Beaven. Have a seat, Dr Beaven, and join
  in the singing.'"</p>

  <p>Jack laughed boyishly, to Abbott's surprise.</p>

  <p>"That's very refreshing," he said. "Kindly go on."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. And that is why Dr Beaven does not care whether they bury his
  body in sacred ground or cut it up for educational purposes. But the poor
  heathen Chinee does not expect any personal attention, later. He cannot
  remember having had any special honours before he came into the world, and he
  does not look for any when he returns to the source."</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;that's the reason he makes provision for his bones?"</p>

  <p>"It is a good reason, I think."</p>

  <p>"A most interesting subject," said Beaven, sincerely. "I should like to
  pursue it with you. We must have a more leisurely talk, Abbott." He was
  moving away from the table. "If you have no plans for to-morrow afternoon,
  about five, how would you like to come to my apartment for a cigarette and a
  pot of tea?"</p>

  <p>"With your permission, sir," replied Abbott, bowing, "I shall bring the
  tea.... Allee same Chinee," he added, relishing his little joke.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was the beginning of a very satisfying and profitable international
  friendship. Abbott did not become familiar, and Beaven did not pry; but they
  shared each other's minds to a greater extent than either of them had thought
  possible. On his second visit a week later, Abbott brought a basket
  containing the makings of a sort of ragout, and proved himself an excellent
  cook, Beaven mounting a kitchen stool to observe the process. Abbott was
  slicing water chestnuts and talking&mdash;at his host's
  suggestion&mdash;about oriental customs and the Chinese mind.</p>

  <p>"China," philosophized Abbott, "leaned up against the past; plastered
  herself fast to the past. America looked to the future.</p>

  <p>"You expect everything of the future," he went on, industriously plying
  his knife. "We expect nothing of it. We are satisfied with things as they
  are; you are impatient for change."</p>

  <p>"The world can't have much progress&mdash;without change," said Jack.</p>

  <p>"Progress?" Abbott glanced up and smiled dryly. "I hear that the English
  have a saying, 'What we made on the merry-go-round we lost on the swings'.
  Same with your progress, I think. Maybe a dozen lives saved in Michigan
  to-day through new inventions in surgery. As many lives lost by new invention
  of automobile. Airship makes it possible for important men to speed up their
  business transactions. Also provides new engine of slaughter. And business
  not much improved, I think. Radio is remarkable invention; gives you world
  news. Formerly the poor and ignorant did not worry about the world, for they
  did not know its daily troubles. Now everybody knows; everybody frets;
  everybody scared."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;what's the answer?" asked Jack, as Abbott put the pan on the
  range.</p>

  <p>Abbott chuckled a little, without turning from his work.</p>

  <p>"That is a typical American query, is it not, sir? You Americans always
  want answers. You want them immediately. You want a prescription that you can
  take to the Pharmacy of History and have it filled. Let all the people pour a
  dose before each meal; or, if there are not to be any meals, pour it at the
  hour when meals were accustomed to occur. The poor Chinee is in no hurry for
  an answer to the questions his fathers addressed to The Great Silence."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," reflected Jack, after a pause, "it would be very difficult
  for the Chinese mind and the American mind to adjust comfortably."</p>

  <p>Abbott interrupted his work long enough to observe cannily that it would
  depend on what they were discussing.</p>

  <p>"Let's suppose a case." Jack tried to make this sound impersonal. "Suppose
  that an American man, believer in scientific advancement and rather disposed
  to be materialistic, should form an attachment for a Chinese woman, trained
  to value the past more than the present or the future&mdash;what are their
  chances of ever understanding each other's point of view?"</p>

  <p>Abbott gave him a quick, searching glance, and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they might," he replied, "if they loved each other. They would be
  unhappy, sometimes; but not so unhappy as if they had denied their love."</p>

  <p>"You're quite romantic," said Jack. "I hadn't suspected you of it, with
  your deep interest in scientific matters."</p>

  <p>"Is it your thought, Dr Beaven, that a man who studies science is not
  capable of love?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps that's putting the matter too strongly. But is it not true that a
  man genuinely concerned with some exacting research might find it difficult
  to pay much attention to&mdash;to the affairs of the heart?"</p>

  <p>Abbott drew a brief smile.</p>

  <p>"Man was a lover," he said, philosophically, "long before he was a&mdash;a
  neurologist." He turned quickly to rattle his pans as an accompaniment to his
  retreat after firing off this audacity.</p>

  <p>"You seem to imply," said Jack, trying to sound amused, "that my question
  arose out of a personal interest in this matter."</p>

  <p>Abbott made an apologetic little bow. "Kindly pardon me, Dr Beaven. I
  thought you had intended me to know."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;now that you do know," said Jack, "do you mind telling me how
  you arrived at this conclusion?"</p>

  <p>"Several times, Dr Beaven, you have asked me questions showing your strong
  interest in Chinese life and culture. I have wondered why. China has so very
  little to contribute to the investigations of the laboratory. I had curiosity
  to learn what it was in China that you wanted. And now you have told me. But
  I can quickly forget that you have told me. I hope I have not been
  impolite."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," said Jack, half-impatiently. "You couldn't be impolite if you
  tried. And your deduction is fairly accurate. I have a very warm
  friend&mdash;an American by blood&mdash;who was born in China and has lived
  there continuously until only a year ago."</p>

  <p>"But she is&mdash;after all&mdash;an American? That should offer no
  problem. Her being born in China, and living in China, does not make her
  Chinese."</p>

  <p>"This is a peculiar case, Abbott. The young lady was brought up from
  infancy in a Chinese home. Her mother died when she was born. She rarely had
  a brief glimpse of her father who died when she was eight. She never spoke a
  word of English until she was seven."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Abbott, thoughtfully, "that would make a difference. May I
  ask what kind of a home it was?"</p>

  <p>"The people live in Hong Kong. The man is a wealthy and influential
  merchant. He has been very generous with his gifts to the English
  Hospital."</p>

  <p>Abbott's impassive face brightened.</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;I know. I have heard of him. Sen Ling. He has sent many students
  abroad for medical training."</p>

  <p>"That's the man," said Jack. "My friend was brought up in his home."</p>

  <p>"Then," declared Abbott, firmly, "she is Chinese."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;probably"&mdash;Jack's tone had the flavour of
  finality&mdash;"she will never be&mdash;anything else."</p>

  <p>"The Chinese," said Abbott, "are never&mdash;anything else."</p>

  <p>"She is in this country now." Jack's remark hinted that Abbott's comment
  was debatable.</p>

  <p>"So am I," said Abbott, "but me no 'Melican man'."</p>

  <p>They both laughed a little. Then, after he had paced a few turns up and
  down the tiny kitchen, with his hands deep in his jacket pockets, Beaven said
  seriously, "Abbott, if I am to continue my friendship with this young lady, I
  suppose I shall have to 'go Chinese'."</p>

  <p>Abbott shook his head discouragingly.</p>

  <p>"You mean," queried Jack, "I shouldn't attempt it?"</p>

  <p>"I mean"&mdash;Abbott sought to brighten the other's solemn face with a
  bit of drollery&mdash;"I mean&mdash;no can do."</p>

  <p>Jack nodded. "I suppose you're right. But at least I might learn a few
  words of Chinese, for courtesy's sake; don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"Easily."</p>

  <p>"Would you oblige me?"</p>

  <p>"Gladly."</p>

  <p>"What does 'Lan Ying' mean?"</p>

  <p>"'English orchid'."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Never having considered social correspondence as anything but an
  affliction, Jack Beaven's pleasure in composing letters to Audrey Hilton was
  exceeded only by his delight in receiving letters from her.</p>

  <p>His work had so completely absorbed him, in recent years, that he rarely
  had a letter other than a business communication. Every month or six weeks
  there would be a two- or three-page scrawl from Jean&mdash;a dutiful,
  sisterly, housewifely, incredibly uninteresting résumé of a young matron's
  dashings about, planning balanced meals, breaking in a new cook or a new pup,
  wiping leaky noses, taking bridge lessons and a course of lectures on Current
  Events&mdash;letters which began with the breathless remark that this was
  going to be a full day, and ended abruptly by saying that she smelt something
  scorching or that Junior had just fallen out of bed.</p>

  <p>He liked Jean. He had endearing memories of their childhood together. But
  they had been separated for many years. Now that his whole existence was
  bounded by surgery, and Jean was literally drowning in domesticity, they had
  about as much in common as a gallon of ethyl chloride and a half-dozen cans
  of your best vegetable soup on the first delivery please without fail. Jack's
  conscience sometimes smote him when he viewed the breadth of the chasm. There
  had been no misunderstanding, no estrangement; just a gradual retreat from
  the close comradeship that had meant so much to them in their youth. He
  always sent Christmas presents, and was precise in remembering the ages of
  the children. Sometimes he would promise that he was coming out to visit
  them; next summer, perhaps&mdash;fully aware, as he did so, that he hadn't
  the slightest intention of it.</p>

  <p>For the first time in his life, letter-writing was something other than a
  necessary drudgery. At Audrey's suggestion they had agreed upon a weekly
  letter to be written&mdash;if convenient&mdash;on Sunday night. Jack soon
  found this schedule too restricting, and wrote every other day. Audrey's
  habitual salutation was "My dear friend", until the letter came in which she
  thanked him for the orchid.</p>

  <p>He had made haste to let her know that he had discovered the meaning of
  her Chinese name. Abbott had no more than left the apartment, that Sunday
  evening at seven, than Jack was telephoning to the little floral shop at the
  Livingstone, pleased to find it still open, further pleased to learn that
  they had some orchids. He wanted only one, and he would be down in a few
  minutes. On the card, accompanying the single orchid&mdash;to be shipped
  air-special&mdash;he wrote, "My favourite flower&mdash;for my favourite
  friend.&mdash;Jack."</p>

  <p>Her next letter was awaited with an impatience that made his classroom
  hours drag sluggishly. And when it came he tore it open with the eagerness of
  a prisoner hopeful of reprieve. His heart thumped as he caught sight of the
  first line.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Jack:<br>
  <br>
  Thank you for the lovely orchid, and the nice note, and all the bother you
  must have gone to in hunting down a Chinese&mdash;a professor in Economics,
  maybe, who wondered why the professor of Anatomy must know the meaning of
  "Lan Ying". Perhaps he smiled, but I think he was just bewildered.<br>
  <br>
  My sister told me she had a letter from Dr Forrester, yesterday. She did not
  tell me what he said. Perhaps he inquires about Teddy, who is getting on well
  in school, doing everything the other boys do.<br>
  <br>
  My sister is not quite pleased over our friendship. She observes the coming
  of your frequent letters. It is not that she dislikes or disapproves of you.
  To the contrary, she much enjoys you. But she cannot understand a friendship
  that is content to remain a friendship. I told her of our firm decision about
  that. She is determined to see me married&mdash;and settled down securely. So
  long as I am your friend, I shall be indifferent to the sport of capturing a
  husband, she thinks.<br>
  <br>
  How happy I am that I do not depend upon Claudia for my living. In that case,
  I should feel much embarrassed. As the matter is&mdash;while I should prefer
  to humour my sister in all her smallest wishes, I think it is so much more
  important that I should do as I please&mdash;for her sake as well as
  mine.<br>
  <br>
  If sacrificing one's own wishes to the will of another is a good thing to do,
  I should be disobliging if I deprived my sister of the benefit which may come
  to her by letting me have my own way in the management of my life.</p><br>

  <p>Jack chuckled as he read this, wondering if Audrey's logic in respect to
  the benefits of self-surrender was a part of the "wisdom of the
  East"&mdash;or was she just having a spot of fun?</p><br>

  <p class="letter">It is not good for people [the letter went on] to exercise
  their wills very much in dominating the other members of their households.
  Slavery must be hard indeed for the slave, but it is hard also for the
  master. Slavery in a family would be difficult for all of them, I think. If
  one member of the house required the others to do his bidding in everything,
  great and small, it would not be long until no one of them would have a mind
  of his own; and then they would all lean heavily upon the strong one for
  support. I have often observed this in China.<br>
  <br>
  I should not want ever to become a burden to my sister; so, to avoid this
  danger to her happiness, I must not encourage her to do my thinking for me.
  Eventually she will be better served if I remained entirely independent of
  her will except in matters where her wishes coincide with my own. Do you not
  think this is the kindly thing for me to do?</p><br>

  <p>It was certainly a quaint way to state the old problem of the family boss.
  But, however funny it sounded in Audrey's bookish phraseology, her psychology
  was sound. Jack made a brief review of the cases he had known where a mother
  had completely dominated her children&mdash;not quite so ruthlessly
  destroying them as an outlaw tigress eating her cubs, but as effectually
  reducing them to a state of helplessness. He had heard plenty of tales about
  the heavy father, playing his thankless role as a dictator, having a grand
  time, making them all jump the rope while he cracked the whip. And when their
  personalities had been demolished, they all climbed up on him and he had them
  to carry, pickaback, as long as he lived, a penalty which served him right,
  of course, but was a pretty high price to pay for the sadistic pleasure he
  had had in making them lick his boots.</p>

  <p>One thing was sure: Audrey, however sweet and gracious, wasn't going to be
  ordered about. Jack's anxiety on this score was relieved. The only obstacle
  to their friendship had been the probable objections of the competent
  Claudia. It was a comfort to feel that any attempted interference from that
  quarter would be ineffective.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Tubby was slated to be back about the middle of November. It occurred to
  Jack that he might contrive to slip away during the Thanksgiving recess.
  Edith Cunningham had suggested it. So&mdash;now there was something for him
  and Audrey to write about; something to look forward to.</p>

  <p>Cunningham's first string of lectures and clinics had been booked for the
  third week of October&mdash;and Jack wondered whether the chief's sudden
  decision to go to Vienna hadn't been inspired by a wish to be out of town at
  that time&mdash;but had been postponed, at his own request, until December.
  Perhaps he had thought it better cricket to wait&mdash;especially for the
  clinics&mdash;until Tubby was on the ground. The Regents,
  however&mdash;unquestionably this Denman's hand was in it&mdash;had insisted
  on Cunningham's coming in October for a convocation address. Denman wasn't
  going to take the risk of having his friend use the soft pedal to save
  Tubby's face.</p>

  <p>So&mdash;on the third Monday morning of October, Cunningham had appeared.
  The Medical College Auditorium was packed. Jack didn't like to admit it, even
  to himself, but the atmosphere of the place had in it more invigoration than
  he had ever sensed there on such occasions. It was warm, friendly, inspiring.
  The students punctuated it with genuine applause; hilarious applause; not the
  mere perfunctory patter for duty's sake. Jack knew he had no business
  approving it, but it was impossible not to be swept along by it.</p>

  <p>"You take your typical case-history," Cunningham was saying, midway of his
  address. "Man comes into our hospital relayed to us by some baffled general
  practitioner from a small town. Comes accompanied by a letter in which
  Doc&mdash;wanting to give a good account of himself, if not of the
  patient&mdash;has taken pains to be scholarly. Case-history goes something
  like this." Cunningham adjusted his glasses and read, dryly: "'In August, a
  year ago, patient complained that his toes were sensitive to pressure. By
  October, the calves of his legs were similarly affected. Shortly afterward,
  he walked with much difficulty, and the hands were weak and awkward. Marked
  dysmetria and ataxia were indicated by the finger-to-nose test. Extensor and
  flexor movements were weakly performed. Ataxia confirmed by heel-to-knee
  test. Abdominal reflexes absent. Bone vibratory sense absent as high as the
  crests of the ilium. Pain sensation absent as high as the third thoracic
  dermatome. Plantar stimulation produced a withdrawal reflex with a crossed
  extensor reflex in the opposite extremity.'"</p>

  <p>He had paused to take off his reading-glasses. Everybody laughed,
  anticipating something good. Shane, who had introduced him and was seated a
  few feet away, contributed to the entertainment by saying, "Shouldn't there
  be a report on a Wassermann, about now?" There was renewed laughter, Shane
  glowing happily.</p>

  <p>"Thanks." Cunningham turned to wave a friendly salute. "I was coming to
  that, Doctor. The Wassermann reaction on the spinal fluid was&mdash;we will
  say&mdash;negative. Now, I think"&mdash;he glanced again at Shane&mdash;"I'm
  sure you know what ailed the fellow."</p>

  <p>The hall grew suddenly quiet. Old Shane was on the spot. It was once when
  Polly talked out of turn. The medics nudged one another, bug-eyed with
  delight.</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;Shane recrossed his legs&mdash;"I suspect that when you did a
  laminectomy, you found some adhesions between the cord and
  arachnoid&mdash;but you'd better ask Dr Beaven. That's his line."</p>

  <p>Faculty chairs scraped as Cunningham's gaze roved for Jack, seated well to
  the rear of the platform, as became his junior rank.</p>

  <p>"Dr Shane," said Cunningham, "has found adhesions. Do you agree, Dr
  Beaven?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied Jack; "between the cord and arachnoid."</p>

  <p>"And a tumour?"</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily. Of course, I'm just guessing, sir. The case-history is
  not very voluminous."</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;there you are!" Cunningham tapped expressive knuckles on the
  reading-desk. "Dr Beaven is right. This case-history is inadequate&mdash;but
  not for the reason he has in mind. He and Dr Shane have hit this difficulty
  smack on the button. Their operation is unquestionably sound. The adhesions
  would be relieved, and there is no reason why the patient should not get
  well&mdash;if this was all that ailed him. But the case-history, as Dr Beaven
  says, is insufficient. It should go on to say, 'Three years ago, the patient
  lost his job as an assistant bank-cashier because the president's son, having
  just graduated from college, needed something to do. Instead of coming out
  honestly with the actual reason for his discharge, it was made to appear that
  our man was being fired for incompetency. Because he was having difficulty in
  making a new business connection, the girl he was engaged to marry grew
  restless and after a stormy quarrel&mdash;for by this time our friend had had
  about all he could take, and was irritable and edgy&mdash;they parted and did
  not later resume their friendship. Patient therefore feels there is very
  little justice in the world. He is not only insensitive to palpation as high
  as the third thoracic dermatome, but he no longer reacts to the well-meant
  overtures of friends who would gladly be of service if they knew how to go
  about it.' <i>Now then!</i> The treatment, I claim, isn't finished when the
  adhesions are relieved in this fellow's spine. What are you going to do about
  the rest of this diagnosis? While your man is convalescent from the
  operation, but still beastly sick in his soul, what else are you planning?
  You've cured his adhesions. Why not finish the job?"</p>

  <p>Apparently the students approved this thought, or at least they were on
  the speaker's side, for they applauded mightily. What Tubby had said was
  true, beyond all question. These youngsters were enraptured. There weren't a
  half dozen, probably, who could have made even a wild guess about the
  physical diagnosis. But they were keen to know how the patient should be
  advised, mentally rebuilt, made over into something that the Rotary Club
  would present with a medal. They wanted to know how to help him get another
  job and another girl&mdash;and live happily ever afterward. Jack scowled. He
  liked Bill Cunningham, but this sort of thing was no good.</p>

  <p>There was faculty luncheon afterward at the University Club. Jack couldn't
  remember a similar affair in which the honour guest had been quite so warmly
  received. You really couldn't stand out against the magnetic appeal of
  Cunningham's personality. He was a royal fellow. He was a
  sentimentalist&mdash;on through to the marrow. But he was a sound workman,
  and you had to respect him.</p>

  <p>Early in November, Jack felt it would be comforting to make sure about the
  Thanksgiving event, so he wrote to Bill and Edith reminding them of his
  invitation and accepting it forthwith if it was still open and convenient. He
  also remarked that he hoped to see as much as possible of Audrey during his
  brief visit.</p>

  <p>Re-reading this letter, he thought he should add a word that might protect
  himself and Audrey from any embarrassment arising from the Cunninghams' naïve
  desire to be obliging.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he said, in an underscored postscript, "you need be at no
  pains to isolate us. I think you know the nature of our relation. We are good
  friends&mdash;and that's as far as it goes."</p>

  <p>Next day he had a telegram from Bill.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">EDITH AND I DELIGHTED HAVE YOU WITH US THANKSGIVING PS OH
  YEAH</p><br>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">RETURNING from Austria on the morning of November
  eighteenth, Tubby Forrester was staggered by the dismaying news that the
  Cunningham lectures and clinics&mdash;which he had made a nine-thousand-mile
  detour to avoid&mdash;were still happily anticipated by the starry-eyed
  Regents in charge of Medical College affairs.</p>

  <p>He had calmly taken it for granted that this dangerous nonsense would have
  been celebrated, and&mdash;it was to be hoped&mdash;forgotten. Serene in that
  faith, Tubby had asked no questions and nobody had bothered to disillusion
  him.</p>

  <p>It was therefore more disturbing to learn that the awkward predicament he
  had dodged was waiting to welcome him home. Nor did it relieve the situation
  to discover that Cunningham&mdash;in a unique convocation speech&mdash;had
  already won the loud acclaim of the students, a brilliant reception by the
  Faculty Club, and front page recognition by the Associated Press.</p>

  <p>No one had been at any pains to cushion the shock. Remembering that the
  Regents' Medical College Committee was in regular monthly session that
  afternoon, Tubby had thought it dutiful to appear and give a prompt account
  of his stewardship, a report which&mdash;though received amiably
  enough&mdash;was immediately driven into total eclipse by Osgood's panegyric
  on Cunningham's address which, he declared, had done the Medical College more
  good in the opinion of the public, and the students more good in the opinion
  of the faculty, than anything that had happened since the memory of man
  runneth not to the contrary&mdash;and a lot more stuff like that; laud,
  honour, glory, and praise, complete with hallelujahs and amen. It was pretty
  terrible for Tubby.</p>

  <p>"And I suppose," he snarled, late that night, in an unpleasant rehash of
  it with Beaven&mdash;"I suppose you sat there and applauded, along with the
  rest of 'em."</p>

  <p>"Would you have preferred me to arise and publicly denounce him, sir?"
  countered Jack. "Or should I have appointed myself a committee of one to
  scowl and sulk?"</p>

  <p>Tubby sourly nodded his full understanding that his ungrateful associate
  had let him down.</p>

  <p>"You attended the reception, too, I daresay, and beat your hands off when
  bright ridicule was heaped upon everything you stand for,
  professionally."</p>

  <p>Jack was slow with his reply, but when it came it hoisted Tubby out of his
  chair.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," drawled Jack. "Hadn't you heard? After Cunningham's talk at the
  Faculty Club I got up and said that as an accredited representative of Dr
  Forrester, I wanted to register his utter disgust&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What!" shouted Tubby, bouncing up wide-eyed with rage.
  "Why&mdash;you&mdash;you damn fool!"</p>

  <p>"Be calm," soothed Jack, with a placating overhand gesture. "Of course I
  said nothing of the kind. It just occurred to me that you might like to hear
  how it would have sounded."</p>

  <p>Tubby sank back into his chair and patted his forehead with his
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"You could have registered your own feelings," he mumbled, "without
  dragging my name into it."</p>

  <p>"Well," rejoined Jack, recklessly, "I'm willing to be your goat, here on
  the campus, but you'll have to excuse me, sir, if I decline to serve in that
  capacity at a social meeting in the University Club."</p>

  <p>"Do you realize what you're saying?" Tubby folded his arms on the desk and
  leaned forward in an attitude of incredulity. His voice shook.</p>

  <p>Jack nodded.</p>

  <p>"Should have said it," he muttered, "long ago."</p>

  <p>"I made you, Beaven," said Tubby, spacing out his words impressively, "and
  I can unmake you. Don't you know that?"</p>

  <p>"It's possible&mdash;but not likely, sir," replied Jack, with infuriating
  indifference. "My position is subject to the Regents. If you wish to prefer
  charges against me, I shall defend myself."</p>

  <p>"Charges? Charges? Won't it be sufficient if I say to the Regents that we
  can't work together in harmony?"</p>

  <p>Jack chuckled dryly.</p>

  <p>"When did we work together in harmony? I've been your stooge and your
  whipping-boy for years, Dr Forrester. And everybody on this campus knows
  it."</p>

  <p>From there on, for the next hour, Drs Forrester and Beaven fairly well
  cleared their systems of all the pent-up animosity that hadn't filtered
  through in the course of their long association. At midnight they had
  resolved to keep their mutual disaffection from becoming a public scandal.
  Jack had freely conceded his indebtedness to the chief for many favours, but
  had declared his independence.</p>

  <p>"There is no reason," he said quietly, "why we cannot work together
  exactly as we have done. Our conversation to-night has not altered our
  relationship in the slightest degree. All it comes to is that we have been
  honest enough to tell each other what we have been thinking for a long time.
  It has cleared the air a little, I feel. If I have been brutally impudent,
  sir, you invite it." He rose to go.</p>

  <p>"Getting back to where we started, in this discussion," said Tubby, with a
  detaining gesture, "am I to understand that you approve this grand debauch of
  Cunninghamery?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Jack, bluntly, "you are not to understand anything of the
  sort. I share your opinion that Cunningham's appearance here was a backward
  step. I do not share your opinion that it would be sensible to
  protest&mdash;if that really is your opinion, which I very much doubt."</p>

  <p>"Are you planning to co-operate cheerfully with Cunningham when he returns
  for these abominable clinics?"</p>

  <p>"I think I'll take my cue from you, sir," answered Jack, with elaborate
  deference. "If you rise up and fight him, I'll join you. I suspect," he added
  craftily, "that I shall not be called to the colours."</p>

  <p>"You think I'm a coward; don't you, Beaven?" barked Tubby.</p>

  <p>Jack laughed, almost good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I don't think you're a coward, sir; but I was just reminded of
  the old yarn about a brave assembly of frontiersmen that once waited to
  defend a hill against a pack of Indians. When the savages were sighted, there
  were about ten times as many of them as the heroic band had anticipated, and
  one of their wise men said, 'It is considered good strategy, when greatly
  outnumbered, to retreat. I, being somewhat lame, shall start now.'"</p>

  <p>"Very funny indeed," rasped Tubby. "I suggest that you accompany your
  crippled friend. I'll stay and fight."</p>

  <p>"Well, you're a pretty good fighter, sir," said Jack, in a tone of
  reminiscence. "I've seen you in action. You certainly can take it on the
  chin!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>No more polio had been reported during Tubby's absence. The two cases he
  had mentioned, on the eve of setting out for Vienna, had been discharged when
  the primary phase of the disease was passed. Jack had not seen either of
  them; nor did he know what had become of them. He had assumed that they were
  now being looked after by the physicians who had sent them in for
  observation.</p>

  <p>On the next morning after their stormy interview Jack relayed the
  information to Tubby that an advanced case of poliomyelitis had just arrived;
  that Doane wanted him to have a look at it.</p>

  <p>Tubby, after a night of bitter brooding, seemed eager to lay hold of
  almost any weapon for the tardy defence of his outraged dignity. Dismissing
  the Romney girl with a curt jerk of his head, he demanded to know why Doane
  couldn't handle the case himself. It was Doane's job, wasn't it?</p>

  <p>"I think that's what Doane wants to know, sir," said Jack. "The case has
  had a lot of surgery. Doane hasn't gone into it thoroughly but suspects it
  has got itself rather out of the usual orthopedic bracket and needs the
  attention of a neurological expert."</p>

  <p>Tubby grunted a receipt of this implied compliment and unbent a little.
  After the drubbing he had received, almost any ointment offered relief. Jack,
  somewhat remorseful over the spanking he had administered last night, noted
  the effect of his tribute to the chief's ineffable wisdom and incomparable
  skill, and was pleased. He had dressed Tubby down and was now willing to
  scrub him up. Nothing, he felt, was so becoming to a victor as
  magnanimity.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he overplayed this a little. Tubby retreated into his shell like a
  turtle, until nothing contactual remained in sight but a pair of steely,
  suspicious eyes. Yes&mdash;he would look at the case, when he got around to
  it. Beaven could go now, he said, in a tone that suggested an unpleasant
  destination.</p>

  <p>Next afternoon Tubby had operated, Doane and Beaven assisting; or, rather,
  standing by as interested spectators; admiring spectators, too, for it was
  indeed a tricky job and the old boy was at his best. You could despise him
  with all your heart, mind, and strength, but Tubby was a surgeon; swift,
  sure, precise, almost prescient in his confident dissection of nerve-fibre
  and musculature that had suffered the distortions of a stream unbedded by a
  ruthless flood. When it was finished, Doane muttered, "Tubby has a sixth
  sense; the sense of fixation in space; only other animal that has it is a
  bee." He grinned and added, out of the corner of his mouth, "That makes two
  points of resemblance between Tubby and the bee." Jack did not press Doane
  for the other similarity, but thought he knew. They both chuckled, and let it
  go at that.</p>

  <p>The operation, whatever it might do for the young patient, had a marked
  effect on Tubby. It was the most exacting piece of work he had been called
  upon to do for a long time, and nobody needed to tell him that you could
  count on the fingers of one hand all the other surgeons on earth who might
  have done it as skilfully. His recovery of self-confidence stiffened his
  spine and his strut and his stare. When he stalked the hospital corridors,
  attachés of all degrees&mdash;from colleagues to
  mop-slingers&mdash;disappeared into doorways. As for his current relation to
  Jack, Tubby now held himself rigidly aloof. When communication was positively
  necessary, he conveyed his orders through the frightened little Romney who,
  having slightly upholstered her angularity in his absence, had already lost a
  couple of pounds and a vestigial dimple since his return.</p>

  <p>Jack was in the private laboratory, which Tubby now studiously avoided,
  when Romney timidly poked her head in to say, "Dr Forrester says that you are
  to look after the Buckley child."</p>

  <p>"Buckley?" repeated Jack, squinting at a test-tube he was holding against
  the light.</p>

  <p>"The polio he operated on," explained Romney, edging into the room.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;was that its name? I'd forgotten. Why isn't Doane taking care of
  it? It's his case."</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir. But I've just been down to tell him that you are to
  look after her."</p>

  <p>"Come over here," said Jack.</p>

  <p>Romney complied, rather diffidently, glancing toward the door which had
  blown shut.</p>

  <p>"Are you getting enough to eat?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't that, sir. I'm being sent about, giving orders to people that
  make them mad; and then they take it out on me. I'm afraid I can't stand it
  very much longer, Dr Beaven." Apparently Romney felt weak in the knees, for
  she dropped into a chair, contrary to her customary attitude of
  deference.</p>

  <p>"You're far too sensitive, Romney. The trouble with you is that you have
  the instincts of a lady. Anything like courtesy and gentility is a serious
  handicap in this environment."</p>

  <p>"I've got used to the smell," she said, with a wan little smile. "And I've
  got used to being shouted at. But I don't like to have people mad at me for
  giving them messages that hurt their feelings. Dr Doane nearly had a
  fit."</p>

  <p>"Does he think I had anything to do with elbowing him off this polio?"</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;Romney made a confirming little gesture with both
  hands&mdash;"you might tell him you didn't. It would please him, I
  think."</p>

  <p>"Thanks for the tip, Romney. I'll set his mind at ease on that."</p>

  <p>"He has been frightfully interested in the case; I mean&mdash;in the
  child. She's a sweet little thing, and apparently she has had a pretty rough
  time of it. Her father is&mdash;simply impossible!"</p>

  <p>"You seem to know a good deal about it."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I've been sent down there, several times, to copy the chart.
  Martha is in the open ward. Her father sits there by the bed, most of the
  afternoon, criticizing the nurses and the doctors and making himself
  objectionable. It makes Martha ashamed and unhappy. I don't see how she can
  get well under such conditions. I'll bet that if&mdash;" She left off
  suddenly, and rose to go.</p>

  <p>"You'll bet what, Romney?" insisted Jack, stepping into her way.</p>

  <p>"You remember when Dr Cunningham was here?" she ventured. "I hadn't much
  to do, that day, and I slipped into the Auditorium and heard him."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Jack, "and you bet that if Dr Cunningham had charge of this
  case, he'd do something to relieve the situation. Well&mdash;what? Tell the
  little girl not to care how much of a nuisance her father is?"</p>

  <p>"I think he'd talk to her father," said Romney. "Maybe he's sick, too. It
  might be worth finding out. I must go." She made off toward the door, and
  paused with her hand on the knob. "Have I talked too much?" she asked,
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"You simply answered my questions, Romney. <i>Pax vobiscum."</i></p>

  <p>"What does that mean?"</p>

  <p>"It means 'Go in peace', and I wish you wouldn't talk to me as if I were
  the Lord High Executioner."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said Romney, as she slipped through the doorway.</p>

  <p>The episode disturbed him more than a little. During Tubby's absence they
  had become quite friendly. She had blossomed in the atmosphere of
  tranquillity, had regained her poise, had been almost gay sometimes. Now that
  Tubby was back, she was a tight little tangle of neuroses.</p>

  <p>After lunch, he went to Doane and said, "I'm informed that Tubby wants me
  to carry on with your polio. I think you know I had nothing to do with that,
  and am simply obeying orders. I should have greatly preferred that the case
  be left in your hands where, in my opinion, it properly belongs. But&mdash;my
  opinion not being worth a diddlededee&mdash;I suppose I'll have to take over.
  Anything you want to tell me?"</p>

  <p>Doane was quite decent about it, though it was easily to be seen that his
  morale was in need of a tuck or two. He posted Jack on what they'd been
  doing, reviewed at some length their annoyance over the attitude of the
  child's father; and, together, they went into the ward to have a look at the
  case. On the way, Doane said, "Incidentally, we just brought in something
  that looks to me like polio from the same part of town. Horrible
  neighbourhood. Ambulance had to be towed out of the mud."</p>

  <p>Thomas Buckley was seated by the bed, a sharp-nosed, darting-eyed,
  undersized, shabby, snappish fellow, who drew a surly grin. Doane introduced
  Jack, who made short work of his nod.</p>

  <p>"H'are yuh, Doc," sneered Buckley. "How's tricks?"</p>

  <p>"The next trick," said Jack, with quiet contempt, "is ours. You may report
  to me, in the private laboratory in Lister Hall, in a half-hour. I shall
  instruct an orderly to tell you where it is. And if you don't show up,
  instructions will be left at the front office that you are not to be admitted
  into the hospital again."</p>

  <p>"The hell you say!" snorted Buckley. "This is a state institution!"</p>

  <p>"Correct," said Jack, crisply. "But not all of the state institutions are
  hospitals. I advise you to do as you're told."</p>

  <p>"Huh! All right, Doc," said Buckley with a truculent grin. "I'll be
  there."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Quite warm under the collar, Jack examined the embarrassed little girl and
  proceeded to Lister Hall, up the stairs, through the anatomical laboratory
  where orderly rows of white-shrouded cadavers waited patiently for Monday's
  painless operations, and into the adjoining room where he had spent such a
  considerable amount of his time for years. Recently he had devoted more than
  the usual number of hours per day to research, rarely going to his apartment
  until midnight.</p>

  <p>He examined a few virus-cultures, made some notes, looked at his watch,
  organized the speech he intended to deliver upon the arrival of the irascible
  Buckley. Presently there was a tap on the door; not the arrogant thump he had
  expected; a quite timid little rap, indeed. He opened the door, and his
  visitor hesitated on the threshold.</p>

  <p>"Come in," said Jack, coolly.</p>

  <p>"My God&mdash;it stinks up here!" observed Buckley, weakly.</p>

  <p>"You probably feel that way about it," replied Jack, dryly, "because of
  your unfamiliarity with the necessities of the medical profession. Sit down,
  please." He pointed to one of the tall stools. "I am rather surprised, Mr
  Buckley, that you have found our anatomical laboratory offensive. We had been
  feeling that you considered yourself somewhat of an authority on medicine,
  surgery, nursing, and hospital management, judging by the freedom with which
  you have been offering criticisms. That's what I want to talk to you
  about."</p>

  <p>"Could I have a drink of water?" asked Thomas, irrelevantly.</p>

  <p>Jack uncorked a bottle of ammonia.</p>

  <p>"Sniff that," he recommended. "We'll postpone the water. I hadn't supposed
  you were so sensitive. You don't talk like a delicately geared person.
  Stomach out of order?"</p>

  <p>"It's out of work," grumbled Thomas. "It hasn't had enough to do,
  lately."</p>

  <p>Jack mounted the other stool, offered his guest a cigarette which was
  sullenly refused, and lighted one for himself.</p>

  <p>"You mean you're not eating properly? Why is that? Can't digest your
  food?"</p>

  <p>"Can't afford it. But that's no affair of yours, Doc. I'm not up here to
  panhandle you. Go ahead and say what you got to say-so I can get out o'
  this."</p>

  <p>"What you probably need is a few square meals, Buckley. If you're broke,
  why don't you go down town to the Community Chest people? That's what they're
  for. They'll help you."</p>

  <p>"We're not beggars," growled Thomas. "And I don't care to have
  investigators snooping around in my house. Well&mdash;tell me why I'm up
  here, and be done with it!"</p>

  <p>The stern lecture which awaited Buckley seemed in need of revision. The
  fellow was starving. Maybe that was what made him so mean. Cunningham's
  comments on the inadequacy of case-histories recurred to Jack's mind.</p>

  <p>"Unemployed, I suppose?" he queried.</p>

  <p>"Yeah."</p>

  <p>"What can you do? What have you done?"</p>

  <p>"What do <i>you</i> care? You haven't any work for me, so what's the use
  asking?"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't inquiring out of sheer curiosity."</p>

  <p>"What else?" demanded Buckley. "I haven't come to consult you about my
  health, and you have no work that I can do. Why the devil should we waste our
  time with questions and answers?"</p>

  <p>Jack grinned a little.</p>

  <p>"Your time doesn't seem to be very valuable," he drawled, "and I'm willing
  to give you some of mine. Go ahead! Let yourself out! Maybe it will be good
  for you to tell somebody." And, as Buckley&mdash;his face
  twitching&mdash;sourly debated a reply, Jack found himself saying, "I know it
  isn't any fun to talk about your troubles."</p>

  <p>Thomas scrubbed his bony chin with the back of a thin hand and pulled a
  reluctant grin.</p>

  <p>"I'll take one of your cigarettes now, Doc; if you don't mind."</p>

  <p>Jack offered him a light and he puffed for a moment, drawing deep
  inhalations until his eyes swam with vertigo.</p>

  <p>"Doc&mdash;you're a specialist," he began, at length, with a comprehensive
  gesture that took in the whole array of scientific instruments in the room.
  "In a way&mdash;so am I. I'll bet you have to be mighty particular when you
  use that thing." He pointed to one of the big microscopes. "Can't do much
  guessing. Well&mdash;I was trained for one of those jobs where you don't
  guess, and I lost it because I was in competition with guessers. See what I
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Jack, crisply. "I'm afraid I don't. You'd better tell me some
  more about it."</p>

  <p>"You know anything about how airplanes are made?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Was that what you were doing?"</p>

  <p>"Doc&mdash;maybe you wouldn't believe it&mdash;but when airplanes are put
  together the business of fitting the parts is such a nice job that the rivets
  are tooled to a thousandth of an inch. They're so valuable that they keep 'em
  in a safe, same as you'd see in a small bank. And when they're fitted, you
  have to heat 'em to exactly the right temperature or they won't go into the
  holes in the aluminium alloy."</p>

  <p>Jack's eyes were bright with interest. He crossed his rangy legs, rested
  an elbow on his knee, cradled his chin in the cup of his hand, and leaned
  forward attentively.</p>

  <p>"That's very interesting," he said. "Go on, please."</p>

  <p>Buckley's face had lost its expression of truculence, and his voice had
  modulated to a tone of honest sincerity.</p>

  <p>"When you drive 'em through," he continued, "and have flattened 'em out on
  the other side, you use a dental mirror to inspect the second head and see if
  it's a perfect clench, all the way 'round. It's kind of a careful job,
  Doc."</p>

  <p>"I see it is," agreed Jack, respectfully. "It's either exactly
  right&mdash;or it's wrong: that kind of a job."</p>

  <p>"Yeah.... I used to keep saying to myself," Buckley went on,
  reminiscently, "before I was a foreman, and was still driving
  rivets&mdash;and, mind you, Doc, I'm no softy, either&mdash;'If this tears
  out, somebody who thought the ship was O.K. will be killed, maybe.' It was
  always on my mind when I was driving rivets."</p>

  <p>"Pretty heavy responsibility. You had the right attitude, I think."</p>

  <p>"Then I was made foreman. Well&mdash;we got very busy; lot o' army and
  navy orders; had to bring in new help; most of 'em young fellers who'd never
  learned to do things right. Some of 'em had had a little experience working
  with steel and tin. They were used to putting up gutters and spouting. If the
  joints didn't fit by a quarter of an inch they would whack 'em with a hammer
  until they were pretty close, and the paint would cover up the cracks.
  Well&mdash;building airships wasn't that kind of a job. You couldn't hold 'em
  together with paint&mdash;if you know what I mean."</p>

  <p>Jack grinned and said it sounded reasonable.</p>

  <p>"Of course, they all belonged to the union. And so did I. Had to, in fact.
  Well&mdash;there was a lot of the work that I couldn't pass. I kept showing
  'em how it must be done to get by, but they didn't care. Then I got mad and
  began firin' the lazy bums." Buckley sighed and made a hopeless little
  gesture with outspread fingers.</p>

  <p>"You can guess the rest."</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure that I can," said Jack. "You mean&mdash;<i>you</i> got fired
  for being too exacting?"</p>

  <p>Buckley chuckled and shrugged.</p>

  <p>"I got fired for punching a union inspector on the nose. He had come into
  the shop, waddling his shoulders like a traffic cop when he's going to give
  you a ticket, and began growling a lot o' 'What-the-hell?' You know about how
  he'd do it, Doc. And I went crazy. I never was much in a fight. But I just
  happened to swing this one right, and the feller dropped like a beef.
  Well&mdash;of course the boss was on my side, but there wasn't much for him
  to do. The company expected him to get the work out, somehow, so he had to
  fire me. The union forced him to it. And I was so mad I tore up my union
  card, right there in the shop, before all of 'em, and told 'em I didn't want
  to have my name mixed up with a mess o' lousy hoodlums. And, of course, that
  didn't do me any good when I went scouting for another job."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I can see that," said Jack. "What do you live on, now?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;my wife makes little pot-holders&mdash;so you don't burn your
  fingers, you know. And I peddle 'em."</p>

  <p>"Where do you live?"</p>

  <p>Buckley motioned with his head and glumly replied, "Up at the edge o'
  town. A few cheap little houses up there, just this side of the
  reservoir."</p>

  <p>Jack frowned studiously.</p>

  <p>"Were you living there when Martha took sick?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah."</p>

  <p>"I understand there was another polio brought in from that district
  yesterday. What sort of neighbourhood is it? The ambulance was mired in the
  mud. Had to be hauled out."</p>

  <p>Thomas's eyes were horrified and his face worked convulsively. "No, Doc!
  No! That's not what ails the Collins girl! She had had the flu, and they were
  afraid of pneumonia! If they say she has infantile paralysis, they're
  crazy!"</p>

  <p>Jack regarded this outburst with undisguised astonishment.</p>

  <p>"We'll see," he said, quietly. Stepping to the telephone, he asked the
  office where they had put the Collins child. While he waited, Thomas slipped
  off the stool and shambled toward the door.</p>

  <p>"If you're through with me, Doc, I'll go," he said, unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," demanded Jack. "You wait a minute."</p>

  <p>Thomas leaned his back against the door, and waited glumly.</p>

  <p>"Connect me, please," the doctor was saying.... "Slattery, are you
  nursing this Collins case;... Is it polio?... That's what I heard.
  Wanted to verify it.... What? Focalized in the right arm&mdash;same as the
  Buckley child? I find they came from the same neighbourhood. Yes&mdash;very
  odd.... No&mdash;I wouldn't think so. It's a mere coincidence....
  No&mdash;that's too utterly fantastic, Slattery.... Dr Doane handling the
  case, isn't he? He's there now? Let me talk to him.... Doane&mdash;this is
  Beaven. Does it strike you as a queer thing that your Collins polio and my
  Buckley, coming in from the same district, exhibit the same phenomena?...
  That's my guess, too; coincidence. However&mdash;it's worth an investigation.
  We'll look into it, to-morrow, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jack heard the door close, softly, hung up the receiver with a bang, and
  started in pursuit of the fleeing Buckley. He overtook him in the lower
  corridor, grasped him by the shabby coat-collar, and brought him to a sudden
  stop. Buckley sagged against the wall, retching with nausea.</p>

  <p>"Let go," he begged, weakly. "That stink-hole made me sick."</p>

  <p>"Not so sick that you couldn't run&mdash;like a wild animal. You've
  something on your chest, Buckley, and you're not leaving here until I know
  what it is." Jack's tone left no doubt about his determination to see it
  through.</p>

  <p>"All right, Doc. I'll tell you, if you promise you won't squeal." Then,
  suddenly savage, the shaken fellow shrieked, "If you do, you'll wish you
  hadn't!"</p>

  <p>Jack replied sternly that they would consider all that when they got to
  it; and, taking the trembling man by the arm, slowly steered him back to the
  laboratory, poured him a minute dose of brandy, and said, "Now&mdash;take
  your time&mdash;and tell the truth&mdash;and tell it all. Soon as you begin
  to lie, I'll begin to know it. You're not a very skilful liar, Buckley. I
  don't know what you've done that's given you this fright and guilt but,
  whatever it is, you'd better tell me, rather than the police."</p>

  <p>"The Collins girl makes three," muttered Thomas. "Our Martha, and another
  kid named Mead. These Meads just moved in, a few weeks ago. I don't know them
  very well. I knew the fellow that lived in the house before. Name of Billows.
  He moved to Detroit. Got a job as a steam-fitter. He was mighty handy with
  tools&mdash;same as me&mdash;and broke&mdash;same as me." He paused, for a
  long moment. "And a mighty tough egg. Good fellow to leave alone."</p>

  <p>"I suppose he got you into trouble," guessed Jack. "Well&mdash;go on with
  it. But&mdash;before you do that&mdash;what became of this Mead boy?"</p>

  <p>"He's at home. His folks don't believe in doctors."</p>

  <p>"What makes you think he has infantile paralysis?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe he hasn't." Thomas brightened a little. "He had a lot of fever, and
  now it's all settled in his arm. I heard you say something about these kids
  having crippled arms."</p>

  <p>"Which arm?"</p>

  <p>Thomas was tardy with his answer.</p>

  <p>"Same one," he admitted, reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to look into that," said Jack. "I'll notify the health
  authorities about the Mead case.... Now&mdash;go right on and tell me how
  you think you figure in this matter."</p>

  <p>"Maybe I don't," said Thomas. "But this is what happened. There wasn't any
  water in our houses, and the old hog who owned 'em wouldn't pipe it in.
  Several months ago he took sick, we heard, and sent a boy around to collect
  the rent; so&mdash;he didn't know what was going on. One of the neighbours up
  the road had a well, and was mean and grouchy about our tramping in there,
  half a dozen times a day; so&mdash;this fellow Billows said we'd do our own
  plumbing."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;you tapped into a water main?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah. It wasn't much of a trick."</p>

  <p>"Just your house and Billows's?"</p>

  <p>"Four. Collins and an old fellow named Bowers did the digging, and for
  that we let them in on it, too."</p>

  <p>"Oh?" said Jack, suddenly enlightened. "When you heard about the diagnosis
  of the Collins child you began to make some deductions. You think it's in the
  water. I suppose you tapped into the main between the reservoir and the
  filtration plant. Right?"</p>

  <p>Thomas nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;the whole affair will have to be investigated," said Jack,
  "promptly and thoroughly. And I don't see how you and these other men can
  evade your responsibility in this matter. However&mdash;now that you have
  made an effort to correct it, I should think you might get off with a stern
  lecture at the City Hall. I'll do what I can for you."</p>

  <p>"A fat chance o' that!" growled Thomas. "There's more to it than I told
  you. This Billows fellow&mdash;he just lately got through doing a stretch in
  the pen&mdash;isn't going to be arrested any more without making somebody pay
  for it. He stole that pipe, over in Wheaton."</p>

  <p>"You helped him? How did he get it over here?"</p>

  <p>"He had something on a fellow, in Wheaton, that owned a truck. Made him
  haul the pipe here. You start something that exposes Billows, and he'll
  squeal on the other fellow. Then you and me will both be taken for a ride.
  See? Let me go, Doc! I'll shut off the water, so there won't be any more
  trouble; and you 'tend to your own business."</p>

  <p>"But this <i>is</i> my business, Buckley. The result of this investigation
  may be of tremendous interest to science. We might make some discovery that
  would help to explain this terrible disease! Do you mean to tell me that you
  wouldn't risk a little something&mdash;to save hundreds of children from
  suffering like Martha's?"</p>

  <p>Thomas shook his head and drew a surly frown.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't find out anything. You docs are helpless as a lot o'
  kittens. You'd go up there to the reservoir&mdash;and puddle around&mdash;and
  write up a long-winded article, full o' big words&mdash;and nothing would
  come of it&mdash;except, maybe, you'd get your bean busted with a piece o'
  gas-pipe, and I'd go to the big house to make skillets."</p>

  <p>Jack was unbuttoning his white coat. Buckley's eyes followed him as he
  opened the clothes-closet.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'll be going, now," he said.</p>

  <p>"I'm going with you," said Jack.</p>

  <p>Buckley growled.</p>

  <p>"Goin' to squeal, are you?"</p>

  <p>Jack tugged on his raincoat.</p>

  <p>"Come on," he said, not unkindly.</p>

  <p>Buckley came to his feet and slouched along after him through the
  anatomical laboratory, and down the stairs, and out to the parking-lot.</p>

  <p>"What you turning this way for?" he demanded, as the car headed toward the
  business district. "Goin' to turn me in?"</p>

  <p>"We're going down to a restaurant, Buckley, and have something to eat. I
  missed my lunch to-day, and I'm hungry. So are you."</p>

  <p>"I'm not eating off o' you."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;then you may sit across the table from me and watch me
  eat&mdash;and I intend to have a sirloin steak and a baked potato."</p>

  <p>"O.K., Doc. I'll have one. By God&mdash;I need it!"</p>

  <p>"Of course you do," said Jack, almost companionably.</p>

  <p>"You're all right, Doc. I'll hate it when you're found in a ditch,
  somewhere, with a cracked skull."</p>

  <p>"I believe you would, Buckley. You're not a bad sort. By the way&mdash;how
  do you like your steak? Medium rare?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah." Thomas ventured an ironic chuckle. "That's the way my steaks have
  been, for the past couple o' years; <i>damn</i> rare!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>As Jack passed the desk in the third-floor corridor, late Tuesday
  afternoon, the Warren girl said, "Telephone for you, Dr Beaven. Miss Romney."
  She handed him the receiver, and he took it up with an apprehensive
  scowl.</p>

  <p>"Dr Forrester," came Romney's clipped syllables, "wants me to tell you
  that he has just had a telegram from Dr Mercer in New York, asking him to
  speak at their annual dinner of the Medical Association Friday night. The
  banquet speech was to have been made by Dr Carter of Baltimore who has come
  down with flu or something."</p>

  <p>"And why does Dr Forrester want me to know that?" asked Jack, not very
  pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;just a minute," stammered Romney.</p>

  <p>"I wanted you to know that," came Tubby's voice, "so that you will be on
  duty in my absence. I'm leaving here to-morrow night."</p>

  <p>"I had expected to be out of town, sir, on Thanksgiving Day."</p>

  <p>"You won't be, though," said Tubby. "You'll be right here. How's your
  Buckley case coming on?"</p>

  <p>"Normally."</p>

  <p>"You're not out of the woods yet. These repair jobs, involving scar
  tissue, have a bad habit of flaring up, as you know."</p>

  <p>"Dr Doane will be here, sir."</p>

  <p>"I committed the case to you; not Doane. I expect you to stay with
  it!"</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," snapped Jack.</p>

  <p>But it was far from good, and the rest of the day's work was done
  perfunctorily and with distaste. At six, thoroughly indignant over his
  disappointment, Jack drove to his apartment, debating whether to telegraph to
  Audrey and the Cunninghams, or explain to Bill on the telephone. He knew it
  was childish to be so badly upset. My word!&mdash;hadn't he yet learned,
  after all these years of last-minute cancellations of appointments, that this
  sort of thing was an integral part of a doctor's life? And wasn't it because
  of just such threats to one's freedom that he had determined not to have a
  home? Audrey would be disappointed, but she would know he had been telling
  the truth about the peculiar demands of his job.</p>

  <p>He tossed aside his hat and coat; and, taking up a pad of telegraph
  blanks, began the composition of a message to Audrey. Then a new idea
  occurred to him. At first it seemed quite preposterous. Claudia wouldn't
  consent to it, even if local arrangements could be made; but it was worth
  trying.</p>

  <p>He thumbed through the classified section of the telephone directory,
  looking for a catering firm; found a name that he remembered having heard and
  seen many times; called them up, asked for the manager. He was expecting a
  guest on Thanksgiving. Could he arrange to have dinner prepared and served in
  his apartment at seven-thirty in the evening? They were very sorry, but all
  the competent help they had were already spoken for. It would be quite
  impossible.</p>

  <p>Jack was dismayed over this prompt frustration of his impulsive plan. He
  paced the floor, trying to solve his dilemma. Suddenly a brighter thought
  suggested itself. Why not attempt to bring in a Chinese cook and serve the
  sort of dinner that would remind Audrey of her home? Abbott would know
  whether this was feasible. He called at the house where his favourite student
  lived and briefly explained what he hoped to do.</p>

  <p>"If you will permit me, sir," replied Abbot, "I shall come and cook the
  dinner."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't think of asking you to do that, Abbott."</p>

  <p>"It would be a great pleasure, sir. I shall bring a helper along."</p>

  <p>"That's most kind of you, Abbott. I'll take you up on it. And you arrange
  everything; will you? We will want chop suey&mdash;and everything."</p>

  <p>Abbott was heard chuckling.</p>

  <p>"No chop suey, Dr Beaven. If you wish to remind your friend of what she
  ate in the house of Sen Ling, she would be as much surprised and amused over
  your chop suey as you would be if Sen Ling, hoping to please you, served you
  with a platter of hot dogs. If you please, sir, I shall prepare the
  dinner."</p>

  <p>Jack was elated. He put through a long-distance call to Audrey, and after
  an anxious moment of waiting, heard her voice; explained that he couldn't
  leave; was stirred by her sincerely regretful, "Oh&mdash;I am so sorree!"</p>

  <p>"But," he went on, earnestly, "you are coming to see me&mdash;if you will.
  I shall make a reservation for you at the Livingstone. We will take a drive
  in the afternoon. And dinner will be served here at my apartment."</p>

  <p>"Would that be&mdash;? You would tell me&mdash;is it not so&mdash;if I
  should not do that?" asked Audrey, in a lowered tone.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly in order. I shall have people come in to attend to the dinner.
  Madame Grundy will be entirely satisfied."</p>

  <p>"Oh? This Madame Grundee&mdash;she will be there? That is good. Claudia
  will not object, then, I know. I shall tell her."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say anything about that, if I were you. Your sister can be
  assured that you are in safe hands. And you know that, don't you, dear?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Jack," softly.</p>

  <p>His heart responded to her confidence.</p>

  <p>"Then you will come? Your train leaves at eight to-morrow evening."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I am so glad. Thank you, Jack. How nice of you to send for
  me."</p>

  <p>"I shall meet your train Thursday morning, Audrey."</p>

  <p>"May-bee you will not know me. I see you have forgotten my name."</p>

  <p>"No, dear, I haven't forgotten. And that reminds me of another thing I
  want you to do for me. Please bring along a Chinese costume&mdash;to wear at
  our dinner."</p>

  <p>There was a thoughtful pause.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;your other guest&mdash;this Madame Grundee&mdash;who will
  surely wear American clothes&mdash;might she not think it strange
  if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jack laughed.</p>

  <p>"Madame Grundee, my dear, is just a name personifying a stiff code of
  conventionality. You will be my only guest."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;that will be verree nice." Her tone had brightened. Jack could
  picture the smile. "Shall I telephone to Mrs Cunningham that you are not
  coming&mdash;and that I am going?"</p>

  <p>"Please; that I am not coming up. You may do as you like about the rest of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;but she will want to know that, too."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I expect so."</p>

  <p>"She will be glad, I think."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ARRANGEMENTS having been completed for Thanksgiving's bright
  events, Jack made himself comfortable in lounging pyjamas and slippers,
  lighted his pipe, and consulted his anticipations. Deep in his mind he
  discovered some misgivings.</p>

  <p>It was all very easy to say to oneself that the incomparable Lan Ying
  fully understood and approved the terms of their friendship, expecting
  nothing further to come of it than had been mutually agreed upon. Indeed she
  had declared that this idealistic pact was not only desirable but
  inevitable.</p>

  <p>But neither his own nor Lan Ying's feeling about this matter quite
  answered all the questions involved. Whatever they themselves might think of
  their relationship, the fact remained that he was putting her in a very
  awkward position in the opinion of her friends; more particularly Claudia
  King. Claudia might feel that her sister's invitation to spend the holiday at
  the University implied serious intentions on the part of her host. He did not
  relish the prospect of seeming to trifle with Lan Ying's affection, and it
  was dismaying to face the risk of anyone's thinking that he had failed her,
  after having shown so much interest.</p>

  <p>In considering this problem, Jack found himself reappraising the decision
  they had arrived at in regard to the eventualities of their friendship.
  Viewed in the warm glow of his remembrance, Lan Ying was, at this moment, the
  most important fact in his life. Ever since their last meeting, the memory of
  that enchanted yet disturbing moment recurred with the frequency of a
  theme-tune in a symphony. No matter how intently he might be occupied with
  some riddle of professional interest, this singular ecstasy would pour in
  over him like an unexpected tidal wave. At first he had said to himself that
  this emotional experience would undoubtedly fade out under the stress of his
  duties and responsibilities, but it had not done so. And the thing he had
  just now planned to do was not likely to help matters very much.</p>

  <p>Well&mdash;maybe he didn't want to dim that vision. Maybe the only
  solution of the problem was to let their affection run its normal course into
  marriage. They needed each other. As for his own self-discipline, it served
  no good purpose unless it was effortless&mdash;or approximately so. The
  self-discipline that fretted and walked the floor and preoccupiedly sharpened
  lead pencils when professional obligations clamoured for attention was a form
  of martyrdom that had no practical outcome.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, it would be a damaging abdication of all his
  hard-earned merits if&mdash;at this phase of his career&mdash;he should
  impulsively decide to alter the whole course of his life in response to an
  emotional appeal. It wasn't simply a matter of determining to what extent the
  responsibilities of a home might interfere with his work: the problem went
  deeper than that. What would it do to his personality, if&mdash;after years
  of costly devotion to a programme that had meant more to him than a religion,
  more than patriotism&mdash;he should say to himself that the God he had
  served with such singleness of heart was not so important as a certain woman
  who had played the deuce with his imagination?</p>

  <p>The telephone rang. Abbott had called up to say that he and his helper
  would arrive in the apartment at five, Thursday afternoon. They would bring
  everything with them. All was arranged. Dr Beaven could safely dismiss it all
  from his mind. And Dr Beaven, grateful for this assurance, heartily wished he
  might also dismiss another problem closely related to this event.</p>

  <p>"It would prefer me," added Abbott, whose syntax occasionally went awry on
  the telephone, "if I might be considered your servant for the evening. Kindly
  do not tell your guest that I am a student in your college."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Abbott," replied Beaven, "if that will make you feel more
  comfortable. I hope I may be able to repay you, somehow, for this fine
  courtesy."</p>

  <p>"It has been paid, thank you," said Abbott.</p>

  <p>The florist who kept an exclusive little shop adjacent to the Livingstone
  Hotel was sending three dozen chrysanthemums. He was also delivering a
  corsage of orchids to Miss Hilton's suite at the Livingstone where the
  room-clerk was holding the best accommodations in the house for her arrival.
  Yes; he remembered Miss Hilton, and they would see that she had every
  attention.</p>

  <p>Jack's spirits brightened, and for a little while he considered only the
  pleasant success of plans for Lan Ying's entertainment. He strolled about
  through the rooms. It would be a strangely sweet experience to have her here
  in his house. His quarters would take on a new significance. It would never
  be quite the same after she had blessed the place with her dear presence.</p>

  <p>The telephone rang again.</p>

  <p>"Dr Beaven speaking," he said, hoping he was not about to be summoned to
  the hospital for work on some emergency case.</p>

  <p>"This is Winifred Gillette, Dr Beaven," came a remotely familiar voice.
  "Do you remember?"</p>

  <p>He remembered and inquired about her graciously enough, though he hadn't
  given her a moment's thought since the day she had told him, at the close of
  their first year in school, that she had decided not to come back. She had
  not particularized her reasons but he could think of at least one reason that
  was ample. Winifred didn't have what it took to be a medical student; or, if
  she did, it was not conspicuously on display in the classroom.</p>

  <p>"And what are you doing now?" Jack thought he should inquire.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't guess." Winifred's voice deepened to a rich contralto; and,
  after a brief pause for guessing, she carried on. "Well&mdash;I married, the
  next year after I left school, and things didn't go right&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sorry," said Jack, when she hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;it might have been much worse," she replied, cheerfully. "We
  just gave it up and had ourselves a divorce. Nothing complicated about it. No
  job, no property, no alimony, no children, no love&mdash;and no regrets.
  So&mdash;now I am back here taking the Nursing course. I thought I should
  call you up&mdash;you always were so nice to me&mdash;and let you know where
  I am&mdash;and what I'm up to."</p>

  <p>Jack's brows had contracted a little as he wondered whether she really had
  told him what she was up to.</p>

  <p>"Are you liking your work?" he asked, in the tone of a mildly interested
  uncle.</p>

  <p>"Umm-humm," she said, uncertainly. "Of course I'm nothing but a slavey,
  this year. If anybody has a swelled head that he wants to have reduced, this
  is just the place for him."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Jack, sympathetically. "However, a nurse has to learn
  discipline, first of all. I suppose the junior year is as good a time as
  any&mdash;to get the hang of it."</p>

  <p>"I remember how you felt about discipline." Winifred's voice sounded as if
  she were smiling teasingly. "You certainly never slighted your work. I expect
  it paid, all right. Oh&mdash;I've kept track of you. Congratulations,
  Jack&mdash;if a little worm of a student nurse may take the liberty. Do you
  still work twenty-four hours a day?"</p>

  <p>This was indeed a nice cue. Jack's gathering frown relaxed somewhat.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied soberly. "It's like anything else that one tries to do
  effectively. The farther you go, the harder you work. I have very little time
  to myself."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I suppose not," said Winifred, as if she might be adding,
  mentally, "And none, of course, for poor little me."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for calling up," said Jack. "It has been pleasant to hear from
  you."</p>

  <p>The conversation having now reached the phase where it could be spoken of
  in the past-perfect, Winifred was forced to admit its finality, thanked him
  for listening, wished him good luck, and said, "Good-bye" with a wistful
  little circumflex intonation that left no doubt of her disappointment over
  his casualness. Jack remained for a moment where he was, seated on the arm of
  a leather chair, reviewing the dialogue; especially his own contribution to
  it. The farther you went in any business, the harder you had to work. That
  was true. It was the firm voice of his essential self, speaking partly to
  feather-headed Winifred; but mostly to flutter-hearted Beaven. He decided to
  conciliate his conscience a little by running over to see how Martha Buckley
  was getting along. Very restless, he took a turn up and down through the
  rooms. They had already reacted to the impending visit of Lan Ying.</p>

  <p>Lan Ying! Audrey! It was so much more natural to call her Audrey, and it
  was so much more to her liking to be called Lan Ying. And because of her
  wishes, Jack tried to think of her as Lan Ying, though bound to admit that
  the Chinese name only accented her remoteness from the interests which
  constituted his life.</p>

  <p>Until now the cold and empty fireplace had served no purpose unless to
  emphasize ironically the dispiriting fact that the apartment was a lodging;
  not a home. Summoning the janitor, Jack arranged for some dry hickory to be
  brought up, and a fire laid. Then he pushed the chairs out of their prim
  positions and coaxed them to act as if somebody lived here.</p>

  <p>Standing before the small group of framed photographs on the wall beside
  his desk, he tried to view the family pictures through the eyes of one seeing
  them for the first time. With folded arms, pipe in hand, he took stock of
  them as a stranger. Lan Ying would unquestionably notice a strong resemblance
  in Jean. "But not the same lips," he might be disposed to add to her comment,
  pretending to be still a little upset over the alarmingly faithful sketch she
  had made of his severe mouth. But perhaps it would be just as well to keep
  off the subject of lips. Hers were so lovely, so expressive, so
  desirable.</p>

  <p>She would look studiously at the picture of his mother. It might be
  interesting to read her thoughts. Any woman could see at a glance that his
  mother's beautiful Titian hair&mdash;flattened hard against her
  temples&mdash;was rebelliously curly in spite of its discipline. With a
  woman's instinct&mdash;plus the "wisdom of the East"&mdash;Lan Ying would
  wonder what sort of battles had been fought between those joy-loving curls
  and the uncompromisingly puritanical eyes. Doubtless she would be able to see
  that when the eyes met the curls in the mirror there could be but one
  outcome. The eyes wouldn't give an inch. From the picture they looked
  straight at you, not crossly, not haughtily, but with calm self-possession.
  The eyes said, "There are two possible ways for people to think and act, a
  right way and a wrong way. The good life goes straight. It takes no interest
  in by-paths, undulations, pastel shades. You may take your pick, but it must
  be black or white, up or down, right or left: no trifling, no trimming, no
  hedging. Hear the Word, pay the price, avoid the appearance of evil; no
  ruffles, no bangles, no curls; for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous,
  but the way of the ungodly shall perish."</p>

  <p>Her eyes said all that and her lips confirmed it, lips very much like his
  own. Jack had always thought that it was his mother's inflexible religion
  that had firmed her eyes and lips. That was the trouble with religion. It
  narrowed your outlook. If you took it straight, it shut you off from the
  loveliest and most lovable things in the world. But was it only religion that
  would bottle you and cramp you and blind you? Science would do exactly the
  same thing to you! Jack wondered if Audrey, having looked into his mother's
  eyes, might not turn and search his own.</p>

  <p>The telephone rang again. It was the McFey girl.</p>

  <p>"You asked me to keep you informed about the Buckley girl. She's rather
  restless."</p>

  <p>"What's your last temperature reading?"</p>

  <p>"Just under a hundred. About the same as yesterday at this time. Anything
  you want me to do about it?"</p>

  <p>"No. I'll be over after a while."</p>

  <p>Jack hung up the receiver and frowned. Now wouldn't it be just like this
  young daughter of the obnoxious Thomas Buckley to turn a few cartwheels?</p>

  <p>Driving to the hospital, he found his polio uneasy but not to be worried
  about. The normal post-operative discomforts were present; that was all.</p>

  <p>He decided to tarry for an hour, just to make sure. He went up to the
  interns' lounging-room and leafed through the medical journals, finding
  nothing of much interest. Fond of analysing his own motives, he wondered
  whether his resolve to spend an unnecessary hour of overtime to-night was not
  in the nature of a votive offering to some unidentified god&mdash;as if to
  say, "I'll sit here for an hour, when there's no necessity for it, just to
  make a small advance payment on the favour I hope you will grant me, and it's
  to be expected that you will be a good sport and remember that I want
  Thanksgiving Day free."</p>

  <p>It occurred to him that this superstition, in one form or another,
  influenced almost everybody on occasions of strong desire to execute some
  purpose. Perhaps the superstition was rooted in an instinct. If so, it had a
  great deal to recommend it. For instincts were not to be sneezed at. He
  decided he would leave when the clock struck eleven. He would have one more
  look at the restless Buckley and call it a day.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>He had wondered, as he paced the station platform, awaiting the arrival of
  Lan Ying's train, how much progress their friendship might make to-day under
  circumstances permitting more freedom than they had previously enjoyed. This
  question he faced with confused sensations of hope and apprehension.</p>

  <p>With a rapidly beating heart he watched the grey plume of steam and smoke
  rising above the small, black mechanical toy, a mile away; watched four
  determined wisps of white cloud shoot into the grey plume, and in another
  second heard the screams of the locomotive; watched the thing grow bigger,
  noisier, until it swept past him, followed by a long string of clanking,
  hissing, acridly pungent cars. The train screeched to a stop; opening doors
  slammed against vestibule walls, porters tossed out baggage, tossed out
  stools.</p>

  <p>Presently Jack sighted her and hurried to greet her. She raised a small
  gloved hand in instant recognition. And he knew that this thing they had
  called "friendship" was something else. She gave him both hands and a smile
  that made him exultant.</p>

  <p>"Lovely!" said Jack.</p>

  <p>"Yes, isn't it?" agreed Lan Ying.</p>

  <p>"I meant <i>you!"</i></p>

  <p>For a minute they returned to earth while identifying the bags and giving
  orders to the red-cap to follow along; then, tucking her hand under his arm,
  Jack led her to his car, proudly possessive and assured that he must be the
  object of much envy.</p>

  <p>Presently, smiling down into her happy eyes&mdash;Lan Ying sat so close to
  him that when he shifted the gears his wrist brushed the softness of her
  Persian lamb coat and was warmed with a lingering glow&mdash;Jack said that
  his favourite colours were black and white and coral. Lan Ying replied that
  it was very early in the morning&mdash;is it not so?&mdash;for any talk about
  art, but agreed with him that coral was friendly. She touched her finger-tips
  to the gay little red feather, snugged the little black toque down tighter
  until the merest edge of the even black fringe still showed against her white
  forehead, and drew the white silk scarf closer about a white throat. The
  black fur coat obviously had been made by a sculptor who acknowledged the
  superior wisdom of the Creator and rejoiced in His handiwork and was willing
  to follow the pattern faithfully.</p>

  <p>There were but very few guests at the Livingstone. Nothing was going on at
  the University during the holiday. The dining-room offered a choice of
  breakfast-tables. They had chosen one in the corner where Lan Ying's view
  embraced the little park and a slice of the marble Alumni Building. She
  inquired whether it was a tomb, and Jack informed her. Whenever she asked
  such questions, he was almost startled; and, on these occasions, he wanted to
  call her Audrey&mdash;just to summon her away from the Chinese ties that held
  her fast.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" she said. "So this is where they all meet when they come
  back&mdash;the graduates."</p>

  <p>"No, my dear," he replied whimsically. "They meet at the stadium; the
  football field. This is just the building where they keep the portraits of
  former University presidents, and I believe the Secretary of the Alumni
  Association has his office in there, too."</p>

  <p>Then she wanted to know what the Alumni Association did for the alumni,
  and Jack didn't know. He guessed that the University just kept track of them
  so they could be easily reached when some more money was needed&mdash;for new
  buildings, maybe, or for the endowment fund.</p>

  <p>"Gifts of money are very important in America; is it not so?" asked
  Audrey. Jack nodded. "People without much money must feel themselves at a
  great disadvantage," she reflected. Jack agreed that this was unhappily true,
  but unavoidable.</p>

  <p>"It would be nice," she suggested, "if people without money but with
  talents could present something they had made with their hands." And so they
  fell to talking about the value of art-forms, Audrey wishing that there might
  be some other standard than dollars by which the worth of art objects could
  be estimated. "Sometimes," she went on, "I read in the newspapers that a very
  wealthy man has just given a celebrated painting to an art museum, and it
  almost always says the picture cost him four hundred thousand
  dollars&mdash;or some great amount of money. And the people flock to see it
  because it was so costly to the rich man who gave it. And I think," she
  added, "this kind man should be appreciated. But would it not also be
  interesting if the people were told how much of himself&mdash;in time and
  thought and experience&mdash;the artist had invested? May-bee it could not be
  measured in cash, but its cost may have been very great."</p>

  <p>Jack was prompt to agree to this, deploring the importance of money in
  American thought.</p>

  <p>"One of the stories which my Chinese foster-father loves best," said Lan
  Ying, reminiscently, "is of an artist who spent fifty years painting a
  beautiful vase to present to the Emperor. The artist lived in a village and
  his workshop was open to the highway. The news spread that he was devoting
  his life to the vase for the Emperor. And every day, not only the little
  children of the town, but travellers on the road, stopped in to watch, and
  honoured the artist for his great patriotism. At length the vase was ready
  for the kiln, and many people came to see the lovely treasure taken from the
  furnace. But when the brick door was opened, it was found that the delicate
  vase had broken in the firing. And the artist was disconsolate. Being a poor
  man, he had nothing to offer to his Emperor but his talent as an artist, and
  now his work was destroyed. And he fell ill of grief. At length the lord of
  the province heard the story and he came, one day, in his golden litter, to
  visit the unhappy man to whom he said&mdash;after bowing verree low before
  his bed&mdash;'I am told of the vase you painted for the Emperor. It has been
  said that through these many years old men and little children, neighbours
  and strangers, have gathered to watch you make this graceful expression of
  your patriotic love. No doubt they went away feeling that they too should
  express their gratitude to the Emperor in some outpouring of their strength
  or skill or talent. And now you lament the loss of the lovely vase, and feel
  your life-work has been wasted. But I say to you, my friend, <i>you have
  presented the vase to the Emperor</i>.'"</p>

  <p>"Admirable story," murmured Jack&mdash;"and well told. Not much wonder you
  are so exquisite, my dear. Brought up on such idealism, you could hardly fail
  to be"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"exactly what you are&mdash;a beautiful
  soul."</p>

  <p>"Oh?" she said, lifting her eyes inquiringly. "Then you do believe in
  souls?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Jack, "I believe <i>you</i> have one. I believe you
  <i>are</i> one!"</p>

  <p>They had lingered for a whole hour over their coffee. At Lan Ying's
  suggestion, Jack gave a more detailed report about Abbott than he had been
  able to do in his letters. She had been much interested in Abbott's comments
  on American life. Many of his observations had not occurred to her before,
  and she was amused.</p>

  <p>"Americans do not realize," she was saying, "that the Chinese have great
  sacrifices to make when their children leave home to attend college in the
  States. The Yankee says, 'How lucky for this boy!' Well&mdash;may-bee. But it
  is hard for the family to let him go so far from home, to remain away for
  years, and come back in different clothes, eating with a fork, and
  complaining that his bed makes his neck stiff.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you may think that when young Sen was ready to go to England his
  father and mother were glad the house of Sen Ling could so honour itself by
  sending its favourite son to be brought up by aliens.</p>

  <p>"Of course I was then too young to realize fully what it meant to them but
  old enough to be deeply impressed by the ceremony enacted in the Hall of
  Ancestors on the day before young Sen sailed. The family&mdash;all of them;
  some two score, may-bee&mdash;assembled in the dimly lighted hall. And there,
  with much dignity, Sen paid homage to his forefathers, taking the incense
  from the hands of Sen Ling and offering it before the venerable statues."</p>

  <p>"It must have been very stirring," commented Jack, "and very sad. Almost
  like a funeral."</p>

  <p>"But without tears," said Audrey. "It was verree quiet. Nobody cried.
  May-bee they did when they were alone."</p>

  <p>Jack remarked that the Chinese must have their emotions under excellent
  control, to which Lan Ying replied that this national trait had been
  exaggerated in the American mind.</p>

  <p>"We are not quite so stoical as you think," she went on. "The Chinese are
  not insensitive, not repressed. They know how to play, and there is much
  foolery in the family life; many practical jokes; much laughter; much
  friendly teasing."</p>

  <p>"I thought the Chinese father was a martinet," said Jack, "expecting his
  wives and children to creep into his august presence on all fours, with
  abject apologies for their existence."</p>

  <p>Lan Ying laughed and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You have been reading American novels about China," she said. "Most of
  the Chinese father's majesty is on the surface. Certain traditions relating
  to the obeisance to be paid to the head of the house are observed, but it is
  most droll to see this dignified performance as it is actually rendered." She
  paused, and her lingering smile testified to amusing reminiscences.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," said Jack. "I am mightily interested."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;" Her mobile lips promised an interesting revelation.</p>

  <p>"One day, when I was about six, Sen Li, who was probably nine, and I went
  hand in hand before Sen Ling, and bowed deeply before him. And little Sen Li
  said, 'Honourable parent, thy unworthy child and his wretched sister have
  made a toy boat with small sails. The boat upsets when the wind blows. Would
  the honourable father tell his worthless son&mdash;' And I broke in to say,
  'We want something ver-ree heavy for the bottom of the boat, honourable
  father.' And Sen Ling said, most gravely, but I know he was much amused, 'We
  will go and see the boat'." She paused. "He was such a darling&mdash;my
  foster-father; so wise; so dear."</p>

  <p>"It must be a difficult illusion for the Chinese father to support," said
  Jack. "I should think he would break down completely, and laugh."</p>

  <p>"He may laugh&mdash;to himself," said Lan Ying, "but he maintains his
  outward dignity. This is not for the purpose of dignifying himself any more
  than his son. The Chinese are wise enough to know that a father cannot
  dignify himself by belittling his child. This is the verree great difficulty
  about interesting the Chinese in the Christian story of an all-powerful
  Father consenting to the whipping of his Son. They do not like the idea."</p>

  <p>"No," remarked Jack, shortly, "and one doesn't have to be Chinese to find
  that difficult."</p>

  <p>"Oh?" Lan Ying's pretty brows expressed surprise. "I did not know." She
  shook her head, perplexed. "Are you Christians bewildered about it, too? Of
  course&mdash;you would be."</p>

  <p>"Some of them are," said Jack&mdash;"when they stop to think of the
  implications of the story. But most people seem to accept what they've been
  taught, without making intelligent inquiries. It's much easier; and that goes
  for almost everything they think they know."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;Jack&mdash;they can't be blamed. Only a few ever have the time
  and self-confidence to pretend themselves philosophers. They really have to
  rely on the old traditions that comforted their fathers back in the times
  when the myths were fervently believed and fought for." Lan Ying paused for a
  moment meditatively. "My foster-father once told me that the old religious
  myths are like the moon."</p>

  <p>"The moon?" Jack's eyes were puzzled.</p>

  <p>"When the sun is bright, nobody is concerned about the moon," explained
  Lan Ying. "But when the night comes on, and everything is dark, there appears
  in the troubled man's sky a pale light. He cannot see very clearly by it, but
  at least he may grope his way. Sen Ling said the old religious myths were
  like the moon; nothing any more but a dead mass of cold craters that once
  shot forth fire; now merely a mirror feebly reflecting light."</p>

  <p>"Marvellous!" exclaimed Jack. "An illustration that fits like a glove!
  Dead myths! Dead craters on a cold moon!"</p>

  <p>Audrey gently touched the back of his hand with the tips of detaining
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she agreed, nodding her head slowly, "dead craters on a cold moon,
  but reflecting light from afar; light from something or Someone that is still
  very much alive, aflame, purposeful, powerful. And no matter how dark the
  night&mdash;how pale the moon&mdash;the troubled man is glad to know that the
  sun is still there, and will shine on him&mdash;again&mdash;to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Jack searched her introspective eyes with admiration and amazement. She
  seemed so childlike, so disingenuous; and yet, at times, Lan Ying disclosed
  ideas indicating a seasoned maturity of mind. He smiled, and tried to say
  that to her, tactfully.</p>

  <p>"But they are not my ideas, Jack," she replied. "I learned to think about
  these things when I was a little girl&mdash;sitting on a low stool at the
  feet of my foster-father."</p>

  <p>"And what does that make you, Audrey? A Buddhist, maybe?"</p>

  <p>She lifted a lovely shoulder slightly to shrug the seriousness out of his
  query.</p>

  <p>"The Sen Ling family&mdash;for hundreds of years&mdash;have been
  Buddhists; ceremonially, at least. I never found out how much of it they
  really accepted. They did not fret over their religion. They took it along
  with the weather. The hard questions were all the same as the cold days; not
  their fault; not their responsibility. My foster-father once said to me, when
  I was asking questions, 'It is our good fortune, Lan Ying, that the Great
  Teacher never conducts examinations. The most comforting thought about the
  riddle of the universe is that one is not required to solve it.'"</p>

  <p>"Is that Buddhistic?" asked Jack.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;it is typical of the Buddhist mind."</p>

  <p>"And yours&mdash;too&mdash;I think."</p>

  <p>Her reply was confused, half-inarticulate.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," she murmured. "May-bee not. May-bee not entirely. May-bee
  not at all. I do not know." She shook her head confessing complete
  bafflement; then smiled, and added, "May-bee I am a pagan. May-bee I just
  believe in the sun and the sunshine." There was a considerable pause.
  "May-bee you will think this strange, Jack, but I believe I could be a
  Christian if they would let me have just their Christ&mdash;standing in a
  blaze of sunshine."</p>

  <p>"And you wouldn't need a moon," assisted Jack.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, softly. "At night."</p>

  <p>Deeply stirred, Jack made no immediate response; sat regarding her with
  such candid affection that her lips parted in a smile. After a moment, he
  said, "I should be much interested in your own reaction to the Christian
  story, dear. Did you hear any of it when you were a child?"</p>

  <p>"More than you might suppose. The good Sen Ling decided, when I was eight,
  that it was in order for me to learn the religion of my people, so they sent
  me to the Mission Sunday School. My amah strongly objected because the other
  children were not of our&mdash;" Audrey groped for a phrase that might be at
  once honest and modest, and Jack solved her problem by saying:</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean, my dear. Please go on."</p>

  <p>"And I would come home from the Mission Sunday School and ask questions
  about the things I had not understood very well."</p>

  <p>Jack laughed, and remarked that this would make a very funny situation.
  Audrey laughed too, and said, "Funnier than you could possibly guess. I did
  not realize then how funnee it was, at eight."</p>

  <p>"Please try to remember, Audrey," said Jack eagerly. "Your people were
  Buddhists, and you came home from the Christian Sunday School to have them
  explain the mysteries. I never heard anything more interesting. Tell me about
  it."</p>

  <p>Audrey sat with dark brown eyes thoughtfully averted for a moment, and
  then smiled.</p>

  <p>"Once&mdash;I recall this particularly, for it made a lasting impression
  on me&mdash;I was telling my foster-father why Jesus died on the cross. I was
  quite full of it, for I had never heard that story before. In fact, I was a
  little shy about telling the good Sen Ling I had learned it, for my
  amah&mdash;who had accompanied me, and sat by me in the class&mdash;was very
  indignant and had said, on the way home, that it wasn't the kind of a story
  that should be told to little children; about cruel men driving nails through
  a man's hands and feet."</p>

  <p>Jack nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"Your nurse had good sense," he said. "Not much wonder she didn't like
  it."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," rejoined Audrey. "Shu-cheng was so particular about
  shielding us from tales of brutality when we were little. She said that such
  stories left scars on our minds. Most of the stories she told us were
  personifications of flowers talking to one another about the bees&mdash;and
  the little wood-people who came into the garden at night to play....
  Well&mdash;on this day I came home and told my foster-father why Jesus died
  on the cross."</p>

  <p>Jack was impatient to have her proceed.</p>

  <p>"What attitude did he take, Audrey? I fancy he was much upset."</p>

  <p>"No," she replied slowly, "not upset. Most respectful; most serious. He
  had not asked me to tell him. I volunteered to report what I had heard. I sat
  before him on a low stool and told him all about it. You see&mdash;I loved
  him so much and had such great confidence in him that I knew he would answer
  my questions fairly.</p>

  <p>"I sat before the good Sen Ling and told him that Jesus was God's Son, and
  that made Jesus a God too, and He had died. And Sen Ling gravely bowed his
  head and replied that he knew about that, but added, 'God's Son Jesus came to
  life again, Lan Ying. Did they not tell you? If not, perhaps they will, next
  time. You must be patient. It is difficult to explain the story of a religion
  in a short hour. Jesus died&mdash;but He came to life. The teachers will tell
  you that, I know.'"</p>

  <p>"Mighty sporting of a Buddhist," observed Jack.</p>

  <p>"Sen Ling," remarked Audrey, "was much more concerned with being fair and
  honest than with being merely religious. I don't think he worried much about
  Buddhism&mdash;or any other ism. You see&mdash;the good Sen Ling felt that a
  man should be&mdash;first of all&mdash;a gentleman.... So&mdash;I told
  him, in my childish way, about Jesus dying on the bloody cross to make
  everything right, because the first man who ever lived had disobeyed a god
  and that made everything wrong for him and his children and all the people
  for hundreds and hundreds of years. I said the first man's name was Adam, and
  the god had made him out of dust that he found in a garden full of animals.
  And this dust-man got up and named all of the animals and ate an apple from
  the wrong tree. And a long time afterward the god let a big crowd of people
  kill his son Jesus so that everything would be all right again about Adam's
  eating the wrong apple."</p>

  <p>"God!" muttered Jack, under his breath. "When it's put that
  way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know," went on Audrey, evenly, "it is not a pretty story when you put
  it that way. And it is not quite fair. There is a great deal more to it than
  that, of course. A wise philosopher could make something better of it;
  but&mdash;that is the story I brought home to Sen Ling."</p>

  <p>"Was he disgusted?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know," she said, after a pause. "If so, he did not disclose it.
  He sat for a long time in silence, slowly tapping the arms of his tall chair
  with his long fingers, and then he arose and took me by the hand and we went
  out into the garden and sauntered along the path to the round pool where
  there are many goldfish playing under the lily-pads. And we sat down on a
  stone bench. And, after a while, my foster-father said to me, 'Lan Ying, the
  missionaries are not bad people. They are good to the poor, and they are busy
  with kind acts. And they are so eager for you to know about religion that
  they have told you things a little girl could not hope to understand. It is
  not time yet for you to be worried about the gods. It is enough that you
  should play with the kittens and help Sen Li fly his kites. You are too
  little, Lan Ying, to wonder about such matters as a god thinking everything
  would be all right after his son was killed to pay for a man's eating a bad
  apple.'"</p>

  <p>Jack drew a long, slow intake of breath, almost audibly, and shook his
  head, his eyes narrowed. "'The heathen in his blindness!'" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"And I said, 'But&mdash;my honourable father, Adam ate the wrong apple
  because a lady who had been made from one of his ribs gave it to him. A big
  talking-snake told her about the apple.' And Sen Ling said, 'Let us not worry
  about that, Lan Ying. It must have happened so long ago that we need not
  care. We will watch the goldfish, and not fret about the god and his apple.
  You go and ask your amah for some crumbs. The fish are hungry.'</p>

  <p>"And I remember how glad I was that the good Sen Ling had explained
  everything without explaining anything, and I laughed and said, 'How
  fun-nee&mdash;for the god to worry so much about his apple. My honourable
  father&mdash;do our gods worry about their apples?' And Sen Ling said, 'Yes,
  my daughter, we too have gods who worry about such things as apples.
  But&mdash;it is not our worry; it is theirs.'</p>

  <p>"And I said, 'But&mdash;my honourable father, if you were a god and had
  made a man out of dust, and he had eaten an apple, you would not curse him,
  and give up Sen Li to die with nails in his hands so everything would be all
  right again&mdash;about the apple.' And my foster-father said, 'I cannot make
  a man out of dust. Go, now, and ask Shu-cheng for some crumbs. We will feed
  the goldfish.'</p>

  <p>"And so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jack's eyes watched her lips as they said, "And so", smiling tenderly, his
  heart beating faster.</p>

  <p>"And so," continued Lan Ying, "I went to the kitchen for the crumbs and we
  fed the goldfish, I on my hands and knees bending over the pool and my
  foster-father standing tall and stately beside me." She laughed a little as
  she remembered. "I distinctly recall the reflection of my face in the water.
  You could not possibly have told me from a Chinese child, with my chubby
  cheeks and little black bangs and the quaint smock gaily embroidered with
  pigeons. I saw my foster-father mirrored in the water. His face was verree
  serious and each hand was tucked into the other sleeve; this way. And I
  wondered if he might not still be thinking about our conversation. So I
  ventured to say&mdash;as I scattered the crumbs close to the noses of the
  fish&mdash;'It was too bad about poor Jesus.'</p>

  <p>"'Yes, my daughter,' said Sen Ling, 'it is indeed a sad story. Jesus was a
  good man.' 'Was Jesus as good as Buddha?' I inquired. And Sen Ling said,
  'They were both good men, Lan Ying, and wise men.'</p>

  <p>"It was some time before I made up my childish mind to risk saying, rather
  shyly, 'The teacher said that we must believe what Jesus taught, but not what
  Buddha taught.' And Sen Ling replied, 'Our teachers will tell you the
  opposite, my child, but I think that neither Buddha nor Jesus would have
  approved of such words. They were both gentlemen.'"</p>

  <p>"You were most fortunate, Lan Ying," said Jack, when she had paused. "I
  wish I might have been in such competent hands. It seems very strange: in
  China, you were informed that Jesus was a gentleman; in our own country, I
  was led to believe, as a small boy, that Jesus was a sissy. It must have been
  a great privilege, my dear, to have sat at the feet of Sen Ling."</p>

  <p>She did not reply to that for a little while; then, rather uncertainly,
  she said, "Sometimes I wonder, Jack. The best things I learned from my
  foster-father are, I fear, the verree things that make it difficult for me to
  live happily in this country."</p>

  <p>Jack nodded, and said he could see how this might be true.</p>

  <p>"One day," pursued Lan Ying, "not long before they brought me to America,
  I saw him sitting under his favourite pear tree, and I sat down on the grass
  near him. After a time, he smiled a welcome, and said, 'I was thinking of
  you, my daughter. You are soon to live with people who strive mightily. You
  will be much confused, I fear, by the speed and tumult with which all of
  their works are accomplished.' And I said, 'My father, I shall carry this
  garden with me&mdash;in my heart; and when everything is whirling fast I
  shall go there for meditation.'"</p>

  <p>"'It will be well for you to do so, my child,' said Sen Ling.
  'But&mdash;you should also learn to strive somewhat, or you will be lonesome,
  and your new friends will think you queer.' And I said, 'You mean&mdash;I
  must run fast and make much noise?' And he smiled at my foolish words, and
  said, 'No&mdash;you need not run, or make loud noises, but you must learn to
  have what they call "convictions", and stand up for them.' And I asked,
  'Convictions about what?'"</p>

  <p>Jack laughed, and said this was the funniest thing he had heard for a long
  time. Lan Ying smiled briefly in response to his amusement, and went on.</p>

  <p>"'Well,' said Sen Ling, 'you will live in a certain city, and all of the
  people there will say that it is the best city in the land, and when they ask
  you if you do not also think it is the best city in the land you should say
  it is indeed. For if you should say you do not know&mdash;not having been in
  all the cities&mdash;they may think you are unfriendly. And you should
  promptly choose a political party.' And I said, 'Which one, honourable
  father?' And he said, 'It makes very little difference, my child; for
  political parties, everywhere, are merely crafts in which men are engaged for
  their own profit. But you should choose one of them, preferably the one
  favoured by the people with whom you live.' And I said, 'But, my honourable
  father, should I not study the aims and beliefs of all the political parties,
  so I might know which of them represented my own thought?' 'That will not be
  necessary,' said Sen Ling, 'and indeed you will be better served if you do
  not study about any of them, for you will be expected to favour one of them
  to the exclusion of all others.'"</p>

  <p>This brought a laugh from Jack, in which Lan Ying did not share. Her face
  was serious.</p>

  <p>"And I said, 'But, my honourable father, you have taught me not to be
  partisan, and I like your way much better.' And he said, 'You will always
  like our way better, Lan Ying; but I wish you to be contented with your
  friends, and they will not like you if you do not strive. You must never say,
  in America, that Buddha Gautama was a wise and great man, like Jesus.' 'But I
  think he was, honourable father,' I replied. And Sen Ling said, 'You may
  cherish that thought, privately, Lan Ying, in the garden&mdash;in your
  heart.'"</p>

  <p>A strange silence fell between them for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I'm just realizing, my dear," said Jack, quietly, "that there are depths
  to you which I cannot know. But," he added, "I shall try my best to
  understand, and you may be sure that while I haven't had the spiritual
  experience entitling me to sit in your garden, I shall stand guard at the
  gate."</p>

  <p>"You are so good to me, Jack," she murmured, softly.</p>

  <p>"Shall we go now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Audrey gathered up her belongings.</p>

  <p>"For the drive in the country!" she said, happily. "I have been looking
  forward to that."</p>

  <p>Jack looked his pleasure over her comment. Neither of them had ever
  referred to the tender little episode which had made their other drive into
  the country a memorable event. It delighted him to feel that she could
  anticipate another drive with such obvious happiness.</p>

  <p>"I shall be back for you in an hour," he said, as they parted.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>And now they were driving in the country. Jack had gone to the hospital at
  ten to make sure his patients would not be needing him for a while. The
  Buckley child had spent a very uncomfortable night, but was showing every
  sign of normal progress; temperature ranging between ninety-nine and half and
  a hundred, but nothing to be anxious about.</p>

  <p>The day was perfect, specially prepared for their enchanted trip; just
  enough snap in the air to harmonize the coral of Audrey's cheeks and lips.
  The gold sunshine had been donated by September, the blue sky pretended it
  was June. The maples and oaks knew it was November. The tall firs didn't care
  when it was.</p>

  <p>The tyres hummed on the asphalt.</p>

  <p>"Did your sister approve of your coming?" he asked. They had not talked
  yet about the circumstances of Audrey's sudden departure for this
  journey.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid not," she said, soberly. "She felt it was most
  unconventional."</p>

  <p>"That's a very big word," drawled Jack. "Are you sure you can define
  it."</p>

  <p>Audrey made a show of earnest concentration, with knitted brows and
  tightened lips.</p>

  <p>"'Unconventional' means something we told our inexperienced sister she
  must not do, because Dr Forrester would not like it," she said,
  bookishly.</p>

  <p>"And how does Dr Forrester come into this picture?" Jack inquired, making
  a poor attempt to disguise his annoyance.</p>

  <p>"I am not quite sure. Claudia thinks that Dr Forrester will be
  displeased." She hesitated for an instant. "Does he have something to say
  about&mdash;about your friendships?"</p>

  <p>They had reached the top of a hill. There the road had been widened to a
  parking-space for the accommodation of travellers who wished to pause for the
  panorama. Jack angled the coupé toward the stone parapet and shut off the
  ignition.</p>

  <p>"Of course you know, Lan Ying," he explained, deliberately, "something of
  the relation sustained between Dr Forrester and me. We do not like each
  other. But&mdash;professionally&mdash;we depend upon each other a great deal.
  Dr Forrester has given me every possible opportunity to advance, and I am
  deeply in his debt for this privilege. I have done his bidding, like a slave,
  for several years, and I suppose he would be at least inconvenienced if I
  left him, or gave him less of my time. He regards me, I think, somewhat as a
  turf enthusiast might regard a two-year-old colt that gave promise of ability
  on the track. The colt is given careful handling, a scientifically prepared
  diet, and the right amount of exercise; but the time comes when it is
  expected to pay for all the bother and expense it has caused. If I should
  die, Tubby would probably miss me. And if anything happened to distract my
  attention from my job, well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I am only a brief distraction," broke in Lan Ying, smiling. "Surely
  the young race-horse should have a day off, occasionally, when he does not
  have to mind the rules. May-bee he could run all the better for having had a
  day in the pasture."</p>

  <p>Jack confirmed this opinion with an enthusiastic nod.</p>

  <p>"Tubby, however, would doubt the wisdom of a day off. He never breaks
  training, himself. It sounds a little as if your sister had discussed our
  friendship with Dr Forrester. Do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she replied. "I mean&mdash;perhaps they discussed it. I do not
  know."</p>

  <p>"I am sure you must be thinking it very strange," said Jack, "that I
  should permit this man to intrude so deeply into my personal affairs. We are
  not friends. But we are both servants of the same hard taskmaster&mdash;a
  master who means a very great deal more to us than our aversions, our
  animosities, and our stubbornness. I have told you something about that.
  Perhaps I should tell you a little more. There was one night, about a year
  ago, when&mdash;at Tubby's suggestion&mdash;I had secured a valuable specimen
  of spinal fluid from an incipient case of meningitis. I shall not bother you
  with the technical details, but this specimen was of special importance
  because we had made the diagnosis somewhat earlier than is
  customary&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think <i>you</i> made the diagnosis, Jack," said Lan Ying, loyally. "Is
  it not so?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;it was my guess; and Tubby confirmed it. So&mdash;we did the
  spinal puncture slightly in advance of the time when such research is
  ordinarily possible. For an hour, that night, we alternately studied the
  baffling little speck in the microscope. Then, Tubby unbuttoned his
  laboratory smock and slipped out of it. 'Carry on, Beaven,' he said. 'Your
  eyes are better than mine. If either of us discovers anything new, it will
  have to be you.' I couldn't help feeling sorry, for it is a fact that Tubby's
  vision is not what it was. I should have known better than to offer a word of
  sympathy, but I blurted out, 'I'm sorry, sir; but&mdash;after all&mdash;it's
  <i>our</i> experiment; and, if I can assist you any in the detail work, I'm
  glad enough to stand by.' Tubby said nothing until he had put on his coat and
  hat. Then he growled, 'It is <i>our</i> experiment, my son'&mdash;and left
  the room. Slammed the door after him."</p>

  <p>"Lovely!" exclaimed Lan Ying.</p>

  <p>Jack met her unexpected comment with a stare of surprise; then, assuming
  she had spoken ironically&mdash;which wasn't a bit like her&mdash;he drawled,
  "Yes, <i>wasn't</i> it?"</p>

  <p>"I must write that to my foster-father," she said. "He would be verree
  much interested."</p>

  <p>"If he's interested in abnormal psychology, he might like it. Next
  morning," continued Jack, "I ventured to greet him in the operating-room
  almost as if he was a human being, and he barely grunted. That night&mdash;it
  must have been one o'clock&mdash;I was having another go at that meningitis
  smear when I heard the click of Tubby's key in the lock. I didn't look up. He
  stood at my elbow for a long time. Then he said, 'Getting anywhere?' And I
  said, 'No. Want to look?' He took off his coat and I gave him my place on the
  stool before the big Zeiss binocular. It had been raining hard for hours. I
  noticed that the bottom of Tubby's trouser-legs were wet and muddy. He must
  have spent a good half-hour at the microscope. Then he sighed deeply and
  prepared to leave. 'Keep on trying, Beaven,' he said. 'We'll never have a
  better chance.'</p>

  <p>"'You're wet, sir,' I remarked. 'Are you on foot?'</p>

  <p>"'Flooded my coils,' he answered, grudgingly.</p>

  <p>"'Let me drive you home,' I said.</p>

  <p>"'I can get a taxi,' he growled. 'You're not employed here as a
  cab-driver.'"</p>

  <p>Lan Ying's eyes were wide with interest.</p>

  <p>"Splendid!" she cried. "My foster-father will think that this relationship
  is worthy of his meditation."</p>

  <p>"Your foster-father will probably decide that Tubby and I are both
  crazy."</p>

  <p>"By no means!" She laid a slim hand on Jack's arm. "Here are all the great
  ideas! Sometimes they are conceived and developed by persons we do not like;
  persons who object to us; persons bitterly disliked by us&mdash;but <i>great
  ideas!</i> Is it not then a mark of greatness in ourselves if we can
  recognize the greatness of ideas that are in the keeping of people we
  despise?"</p>

  <p>He regarded her with tenderness.</p>

  <p>"That was a good thought, Lan Ying," he said, gently. "You have a very
  busy little head&mdash;and a very pretty head."</p>

  <p>She shook the pretty little head deprecatingly, and replied, "You like the
  Chinese bangs: is it not so?"</p>

  <p>Jack ventured to touch the edge of the blue-black fringe with his
  finger-tips, and nodded approval.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes&mdash;when I was a little girl," said Lan Ying, softly, "my
  foster-father used to touch me on my forehead&mdash;just that way."</p>

  <p>"You are very fond of Sen Ling," said Jack.</p>

  <p>"And I think he would like you," she murmured. "Sen Ling is so verree much
  interested in courage."</p>

  <p>Jack thought this an odd remark. It had not occurred to him that any
  element of courage had been discussed. While he was debating this, Lan Ying
  went on, "My foster-father often said there were two kinds of courage: the
  courage demanded by self-restraint, and the courage manifested by
  audacity."</p>

  <p>"And which kind did he like best?" asked Jack, feeling that he should keep
  Lan Ying going.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, my foster-father knew more about the courage demanded by
  self-discipline, for that is Buddhistic. The Buddhists make a speciality of
  caution and resignation. But&mdash;he also admired the courage that is
  audacious."</p>

  <p>"For instance," pressed Jack.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;do you remember the old myth about the people who built the
  tower, hoping to reach up to the gods?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. They never finished it, did they?"</p>

  <p>Lan Ying shook her head.</p>

  <p>"When they found out what good bricks they were making," she continued,
  "they changed their plans and decided that the tower was to be a monument to
  themselves. And&mdash;as soon as they left off building up to see the gods,
  and began working for themselves, they could not understand one another, any
  more. So&mdash;the tower was abandoned."</p>

  <p>"And that," assisted Jack, with a brief chuckle, "accounted for all the
  different languages in the world."</p>

  <p>"It is a fantastic explanation of the various languages," said Lan Ying,
  "but my foster-father says that all the people in the world would be speaking
  the same tongue&mdash;and understanding one another&mdash;if they were not so
  eager to build monuments to themselves. But&mdash;that is not the part of the
  story that interests Sen Ling. It was the audacity of the original idea.
  There was nothing unusual about the failure of the tower-builders, or their
  misunderstandings. Sen Ling likes the first part of the myth&mdash;where the
  people voted to build up to the gods, with brick!"</p>

  <p>"A very silly aspiration," commented Jack. "One would think that an
  ancient tribe with enough ingenuity to make good brick might have sense
  enough not to tackle such a crazy scheme."</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;there&mdash;that is just the point!" Lan Ying's eyes sparkled.
  "That is the way you get the great accomplishments! Crazy schemes! Silly
  aspirations! But&mdash;the gods give men these funnee ideas. Is it not
  so?"</p>

  <p>"But why?" Jack's lips registered dissent. "There's no occasion for the
  gods to get into it, at all; neither a God, nor a whole flock of gods. Human
  progress is a gradual adaptation to circumstances; a gradual improvement on
  the techniques of meeting life's demands. You take the wheel, for example.
  Some early fellow discovered accidentally that he could transport a big stone
  by pushing it across rolling logs. After that, well&mdash;they just kept on
  making better wheels. The gods didn't have to hand anything down. The
  primitives didn't need a divine revelation to produce the pulley. Once you
  had a wheel, the pulley was inevitable. Some bright fellow made a simple
  pulley and his grandson laughed and made a multiple pulley. No gods
  required."</p>

  <p>Lan Ling agreed to all this with a smile that promised further
  argument.</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;Dr Beaven&mdash;you must let <i>me</i> pick a case!" she said
  archly. "One day, some early fellow wished to sail his boat out of the sight
  of land; and, fearing he might be lost, he said, 'I shall now make a little
  round box, with a needle in it that will always point north.' Does it not
  seem as if the gods may have had to furnish that crazy idea? Your Columbus:
  did not the gods sail with him?"</p>

  <p>"Columbus wasn't looking for America, Lan Ying," objected Jack. "That was
  an accident."</p>

  <p>"May-bee he thought it was," she persisted. "May-bee the man who
  discovered the compass was trying to make something else." Her brown eyes
  grew serious. "May-bee <i>you</i> will meet with a strange
  accident&mdash;some time," she added, softly.</p>

  <p>"That would be very thrilling, Lan Ying."</p>

  <p>"My foster-father told me that the great Monsieur Pasteur was led into his
  discoveries by trying to find out what ailed some sick silkworms. May-bee you
  will be looking for a way to mend a man's damaged hand, and say something to
  him that will make the man over into a verree important person."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I should leave that job to the mental healers," said Jack dryly,
  "I'm not working in that field, Lan Ying."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;may-bee that other job <i>is</i> in your field, Jack. You first
  mend the man's hand&mdash;and then tell him how to use it most effectively. I
  think that if you restore a man's hand, you have a better right than anyone
  else to advise him what to do with it."</p>

  <p>Jack regarded her with an indulgent smile.</p>

  <p>"Lan Ying," he said, "you do have the largest assortment of queer
  notions."</p>

  <p>"Did you find what you were looking for, Jack," she asked, suddenly
  reverting to the story he had told a few minutes earlier&mdash;"the secret in
  the big microscope?"</p>

  <p>"No," he replied glumly.</p>

  <p>"Did the patient develop a verree bad case?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Boy about nine. He died."</p>

  <p>"How verree sad for his family." Lan Ying was much distressed. "Had he a
  father and mother?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I don't know that, dear," confessed Jack. "It was Tubby's
  case, I simply did the puncture, you know. The main part of my job was in the
  laboratory."</p>

  <p>"Was he a bright little fellow&mdash;like Teddy?" persisted Lan Ying.</p>

  <p>"I really didn't have a good look at him." Jack's tone was apologetic.
  "When I came to do the spinal puncture they had him turned face down, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"And they didn't tell you"&mdash;Lan Ying shook her head,
  incredulously&mdash;"anything about him?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;no. Naturally, they wouldn't, unless I inquired; and there was
  no occasion for my knowing that. I didn't see any of his kinfolks."</p>

  <p>"Just the little speck in the big microscope?" murmured Lan Ying,
  disappointedly.</p>

  <p>"Yes; but&mdash;see here, Lan Ying," Jack protested defensively, "if we
  could find something in that little speck; something that might help point
  the way to a discovery of some remedy for the boy's trouble; something that
  might benefit hundreds, thousands of people&mdash;isn't that enough of a job
  to occupy one man's full attention?"</p>

  <p>"May-bee&mdash;but I was just thinking how verree fine it would be if you
  should have sat by the little boy's bed and said to him, 'May-bee you are
  helping us to something that will make other children well and strong.'" Lan
  Ying's brown eyes quizzed his face wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that would register&mdash;with a small boy?" asked Jack,
  doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"It might be worth trying," said Lan Ying, softly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JACK had left Audrey at the Livingstone shortly after four.
  She had insisted that he should not come back for her in the evening. She
  would take a taxi to his apartment about seven, leaving him free to attend to
  his hospital duties and dress for dinner without hurrying.</p>

  <p>At six-thirty he was ready for her, pacing up and down in his living-room,
  pausing in his march to move a chair, pat a pillow, straighten a row of
  books. Time crept. It pleased him to discover that the clock on the mantel
  was almost two minutes slow.</p>

  <p>Abbott, with his Chinese helper, was busy in the tiny kitchen. He had
  politely but firmly made it clear that the only duty expected of Dr
  Beaven&mdash;in respect to the dinner preparations&mdash;was to refrain from
  offering his assistance. There was a quiet air of mystery about these
  proceedings, and Jack surmised that the fewer questions he asked the more
  popular he would be in the opinion of his impromptu oriental ménage.</p>

  <p>When it had struck seven he was nervous with eagerness as he stood at a
  front window looking down the street. Presently he saw a cab coming. It made
  a circle in front of the apartment house and drew up at the curb. He had a
  brief glimpse of a white coat. Turning from the window, he went to the
  hall-door to await a signal from below. The elevator rumbled. Its metal gates
  clicked. The bell rang. And there she stood&mdash;and here she came, through
  his doorway, into his house. Her lips were parted in a happy smile as Jack
  greeted her. It was an enchanted moment.</p>

  <p>She had turned when he reached for the lovely white coat and his hands had
  touched her cheeks. Glancing up over her shoulder, she said, "I should have
  worn a mandarin with this dress, Jack, but I felt it might be too conspicuous
  at the hotel." He laid the white fur-trimmed coat over his arm and surveyed
  Lan Ying with frankly admiring, rather serious eyes. Her beauty was so
  distinctly exotic that for a moment he could find nothing to say. Rich
  rose-brocaded satin; the frogged jacket mindful of her adorable shapeliness
  but topped with a severely tailored but exquisitely embroidered collar high
  on her white throat; a long, narrow skirt of the same material that revealed
  the tips of black satin slippers, slippers with low heels, apparently, for
  when she looked up into Jack's eyes he felt himself towering above her. The
  only jewellery she wore was a pair of jade ear-drops.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Lan Ying, shaking her blue-black head slowly. "You asked me
  to&mdash;you know."</p>

  <p>"Yes, my dear," he finally found himself saying, "and it's beautiful. I
  never saw you quite so lovely."</p>

  <p>"Nor so comfortable," she added. "It is a verree friendly dress, Jack. I
  am glad you like me in it."</p>

  <p>He had led the way toward the almost too energetic fire and signed her to
  a huge tan-leather chair which she rejected with a teasing smile.</p>

  <p>"It is much too big," she said. "Besides, you must let me stroll
  about&mdash;and see your house. Such a nice place, Jack. Have you a dog or a
  cat or a bird or a bee&mdash;or do you live quite alone?"</p>

  <p>It had given him a very queer sensation when, having left her for a moment
  to dispose of her coat, Jack returned to find Lan Ying sitting at his desk.
  She glanced up to say, "I am making myself at home; is it not so? Here, I
  think, is where you sit when you write such verree nice letters to me."</p>

  <p>He had stood behind her chair, regarding her with tender eyes. He touched
  her shoulder and she lifted a little in response.</p>

  <p>"I never enjoyed writing letters before," he said.</p>

  <p>"That is Jean, I think." Lan Ying had risen to inspect the family
  photographs. "She is much like you, Jack, only not so&mdash;so serious. She
  will visit you, some day, may-bee?"</p>

  <p>"May-bee," responded Jack, teasingly.</p>

  <p>"You will ask me to come&mdash;when she visits you?" Lan Ying's entreating
  little nods made her seem very childlike.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and we will have a party. I think you might like my sister.
  This is my mother. I believe I told you that she died very shortly before I
  came here to attend the Medical College."</p>

  <p>Lan Ying slipped her small hand through his arm sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"That probably accounts for the first run-in I had with Dr Forrester,"
  continued Jack. "I had come almost directly from my mother's funeral. She was
  a very devout person. And when Tubby began to unload sour ironies about the
  orthodox beliefs, I wasn't quite prepared to think it was amusing. Mother had
  staked everything on the literal truth of the old legends. And they had been
  a great comfort to her, I know."</p>

  <p>"It is too bad he did not know that," remarked Lan Ying. "May-bee he would
  have been more kind. You know what I think?" she asked, abruptly. "This
  Tubbee&mdash;he is verree religious; verree sentimental. He is afraid it will
  make him what you call 'sissie'; is it not so? He wishes to deny it to
  himself, so that he can be a big, strong, hard man!" Lan Ying drew a
  ludicrously long face, deepened her voice, and raised on tiptoe in a very
  unsuccessful imitation of a big, strong, hard man. Jack chuckled, but she
  carried on earnestly.</p>

  <p>"My honourable foster-father often said to me that when a man blusters and
  makes loud talk he is trying to persuade himself he is not a coward&mdash;and
  when he pretends to be verree hard, he is afraid of his own spirit of
  kindliness." She queried Jack's eyes for a moment, and continued. "May not
  this Tubbee be in a big battle with his own heart?"</p>

  <p>"I never thought of that," said Jack. "If so, he has his emotions under
  very good control." And then, recalling the only occasion when he had
  surprised Tubby in the performance of a soft act, he told Lan Ying the
  amusing story of Nancy Prentiss's baby, playing up the scene for all it was
  worth. It surprised him that she listened with so much seriousness. She
  smiled, but it was quite apparent that the story was more significant than
  silly. She made a quick little gesture of full understanding.</p>

  <p>"That should settle it!" she declared, soberly. "Your Tubbee is afraid of
  his own spirit. He thinks a man cannot be a good scientist&mdash;and have any
  feelings. He is probably crazy. Is it not so?"</p>

  <p>Jack studied her lips and nodded his head judicially. If Lan Ying
  preferred to think that Tubby was crazy, it was all right with him. He had
  often thought so, himself.</p>

  <p>"He may be crazy&mdash;at some points," rejoined Jack, "but he is a great
  scientist."</p>

  <p>"You should know," said Lan Ying, deferentially. She was studying his
  mother's picture now. "I think she must have suffered, Jack."</p>

  <p>"Not when that photograph was taken, dear. She did, later. What you see
  there is not pain, but duty; religious duty."</p>

  <p>Lan Ying looked up steadily into his face with appraising eyes, and
  returned to the picture.</p>

  <p>"It is the same mouth," she said. "May-bee it should be called a 'duty
  mouth'. Verree strong, Jack."</p>

  <p>"My mother's life," he explained, deliberating his words, "was singularly
  devoid of the little recreations and diversions on which most people rely for
  their happiness. In her opinion, to fear God and keep his commandments was a
  full-time job. She never had any fun. Religion was her whole occupation."</p>

  <p>Lan Ying's eyes brightened with comprehension.</p>

  <p>"And you noticed that, even when you were a little boy, I think, and
  decided that you would not have anything to do with religion because it had
  made your mother unhappy. Is it not so?"</p>

  <p>"Doubtless. I grew up feeling that the practice of religion was a very
  grim business."</p>

  <p>"But you still had the 'duty mouth'," pursued Lan Ying. "You needed a
  Master to serve with all your heart, mind, and strength; so you became a
  disciple of Science. It is all verree clear to me now, Jack. I am glad you
  showed me the picture. It explains so many things."</p>

  <p>Jack wished the subject had not come up.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," he said, defensively, "that my mother's life was
  positively unhappy. I think she found a great deal of satisfaction in the
  performance of her religious duty. That was the aim of her existence. Nothing
  else ever mattered. Sometimes, when Jean and I were half-grown children in
  high school, we would bring home phonograph records of popular songs; and,
  when we were done playing them, Mother could be heard&mdash;and she had a
  very good voice, too&mdash;clearing the air of these frivolous sentiments
  with some such quaint and doleful ditty as 'We'll work&mdash;till Jesus
  comes'."</p>

  <p>Jack's brows contracted in an effort to recover the lines, Lan Ying
  regarding him with amused bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"One of the verses went, 'Thi-yus world's a wil-der-ness of woe; this
  world is not my home. We'll work, we'll work, till Jesus comes; we'll work,
  we'll work, till Jesus comes; we'll work, we'll work, till Jesus comes; and
  we'll be gathered home.' Jean and I used to laugh&mdash;and then we'd be
  ashamed of ourselves and try to make it up to her some way by being unusually
  helpful."</p>

  <p>Lan Ying smiled over this reminiscence; then, sobering, she remarked, "Of
  course&mdash;that picture of life is not attractive,
  but&mdash;well&mdash;there was a promise of nice pay&mdash;at the end of it.
  After all the hard work, your mother confidently expected to be 'gathered
  home'. Now&mdash;with <i>you</i>&mdash;" She hesitated, frowning a little as
  she fumbled for the right words.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" encouraged Jack. "With <i>me</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With <i>you,</i> there is no promise of pay&mdash;here or elsewhere.
  Plenty of hard work, day after day. Plenty of other people helped; their
  injuries healed, their diseases relieved. But&mdash;poor Jack gets no pay. He
  does not know the people, except by their hurts and damages. No," she added,
  after a reflective pause, "I think your mother was happier than you. She
  worked&mdash;but she was going to be gathered home'."</p>

  <p>"She well deserved to be," said Jack, gently. "Let us hope that she was."
  His tone suggested that this matter had now been brought to an appropriate
  conclusion. Divining his mood, Lan Ying nodded approval and smiled her
  willingness to talk about something less serious.</p>

  <p>"Dinner is served," announced Abbott, in the doorway. Lan Ying's eyes
  widened with surprise.</p>

  <p>"May-bee this is a Chinese dinner," she ventured. "All but <i>you,</i>
  Jack." She laughed. "I should have brought the mandarin coat, after all. You
  might have worn it."</p>

  <p>He drew back her chair and seated her with a warm sensation of possession,
  took his place opposite, and for an instant there was a little constrained
  silence between them. Jack was momentarily indulging the illusion&mdash;at
  once pleasant and painful&mdash;that they were together in their own home,
  sitting down to a customary evening meal. Lan Ying seemed to have read
  something of the sort in his eyes, for the pensive little smile on her lips
  welcomed the idea and pronounced it hopeless. It was a very expressive
  mouth.</p>

  <p>She leaned forward and inhaled the fragrance of the dish before her.
  Abbott was at her elbow now, offering rice wafers. Looking up inquisitively
  into his face, Lan Ying murmured a rapid and lengthy sentence utterly
  unintelligible to her host; and Abbott, with a deferential bow, replied
  briefly. Then she asked him a question which he answered in a word. Her eyes
  were misty. Jack was bewildered and for a moment felt alien. Lan Ying,
  collecting herself, hastened to explain with an unsteady voice.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, Jack," she said softly. "But&mdash;do you know what this
  is?"</p>

  <p>"Has the flavour of orange, hasn't it?" His tone was purposely casual.
  "Some sort of orange soup, I should say&mdash;if there is any such thing as
  orange soup. I never tasted any before. Is it made the way you like it?"</p>

  <p>"It is perfect! And it is the first I have had since I left China. It
  stirs tender memories of my home, Jack. May-bee I should not have spoken to
  your man. I quite forgot my manners, and told him how glad I was to have it
  again."</p>

  <p>"Takes a good while to say that in Chinese," observed Jack, with a sly
  grin. Lan Ying flushed a little.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I asked him if Dr Beaven really liked Chinese food&mdash;or
  was he serving it just to humour me?"</p>

  <p>"And Abbott said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Abbott!"</p>

  <p>"Yes: his name was Ng when he came to this country and he changed it to
  Abbott."</p>

  <p>"How funnee!" Lan Ying laughed merrily. "How did he happen to pick that
  name? Tell me some more about him," she urged. "He does not in the least seem
  like a servant."</p>

  <p>Jack hesitated, remembering his promise. He realized now that the mystery
  of Abbott's name invited explanations.</p>

  <p>"You may ask him, when he comes in, if he has any objection to my telling
  you."</p>

  <p>Abbott reappeared, presently, removed the soup service, and brought in an
  exquisitely designed plate of lotus root, cut in the shape of medallions,
  cooked with duck and shrimps. Lan Ying gave a little exclamation of surprise
  and delight. While Abbott was serving her, she turned loose on him what
  sounded to Jack like one melodious word of two hundred and ninety-six
  syllables; adding, immediately, to her host, "You do not care, I know, if I
  speak my own language, for a moment." Abbott, slightly flustered, had made no
  reply. He was serving Jack, now.</p>

  <p>"You may tell the lady, sir, if you wish," he consented.</p>

  <p>So, Jack proceeded to clear up the mystery, Lan Ying listening with rapt
  attention.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she said, "whether he may not have heard, some time, of my
  foster-father. The good Sen Ling has been so verree much interested in the
  training of young men for the practice of medicine."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," replied Jack, recklessly. "He knows about Sen Ling."</p>

  <p>"How funnee&mdash;that he should tell <i>you!"</i> Lan Ying's lips
  puckered into an enigmatic smile, and it was now Jack's turn to be somewhat
  disconcerted.</p>

  <p>"Well," he began, insecurely, "you see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lan Ying nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she assisted, "I think I do."</p>

  <p>"Abbott and I were having a long talk about China, and Chinese interest in
  modern medical research, and I happened to ask him if he had ever heard of
  Sen Ling."</p>

  <p>"But you did not tell him about me." Lan Ying shook her head slightly,
  inviting a negative reply.</p>

  <p>"He wormed that out of me," confessed Jack. "You Chinese have a trick of
  discovering what you want to know; and so verree politely too."</p>

  <p>Lan Ying thought this quite amusing.</p>

  <p>"It is true," she admitted. "The Chinese disarms you with his studied
  courtesies, and gets what he wants&mdash;indirectly. May-bee I can think of
  some examples." Her face brightened. "You might be interested in a story we
  are all fond of in the house of Sen Ling. Young Sen had been begging to go to
  England for his schooling, and his father said, 'But you have had so little
  experience. You are a mere boy. How could you hope to take care of yourself
  among foreign people at your age?'</p>

  <p>"And young Sen said, 'Will my honourable father give his inexperienced son
  some tests of his poor wits?'</p>

  <p>"And Sen Ling said, 'It shall be as you wish. You may put me out of this
  room&mdash;by your wits.' So, young Sen bowed his head and was thoughtful for
  a long time. Then he said, 'Honourable father, it is difficult. But&mdash;if
  you will go out of the room, I think I can bring you in, by my wits.'
  So&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jack loved the way her lips curved around that deliberate "So". The lips
  pretended to chastise his teasing smile with a brief pout before they
  continued.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;Sen Ling agreed to this and left the room, and as he went
  through the open doorway, young Sen arose and bowed and said, 'My honourable
  father, you have asked me to put you out of this room, by my wits. I humbly
  report to you that you are now out.' Is that not delicious?" She laughed
  merrily. "And so typically Chinese."</p>

  <p>Abbott had come with jasmine tea, candied kumquats, and sesame-seed
  confections. Jack, vastly entertained by Lan Ying's narrative, hardly noticed
  what was being served to him.</p>

  <p>"Sen Ling must have felt rather foolish," he said.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;Sen Ling was verree proud!" she declared. "That was a great day
  for him, to see his child exhibiting some cleverness. That is where the real
  glory of the father-son relationship in China shows brightly, Jack. The
  father is not envious of his son, and this makes the son proud to say, 'My
  honourable father!' The good Sen Ling often said it was this mutually
  respectful relationship of parents and children that had made China one
  indivisible unit&mdash;in its inner life. I have heard him say he wondered
  why the Christian people had not given more attention to the value of this
  bond which their great teacher recognized when he said, 'I am in my Father,
  and my Father is in me.'"</p>

  <p>"Your good Sen Ling seems to be amazingly well versed in Christian lore,"
  observed Jack.</p>

  <p>"Deeply," affirmed Lan Ying. "You see&mdash;he is not religious like the
  priests, who must collect funds for the temple. Sen Ling has always
  maintained that good people, all over the earth, would believe and practise
  much the same principles if left to themselves. But the priests everywhere
  must raise money to support the temples, so they make it appear that their
  own religion is the only right one and all the others are wrong. They do not
  improve their religion to make it seem better than the others; but belittle
  the other religions, so that their own may seem better by contrast. My
  foster-father, who was just a layman, could think straight about these things
  because he did not have to fret about the upkeep of the temple."</p>

  <p>"That certainly puts all of the contentious sects on the spot!" muttered
  Jack. "I wonder if Sen Ling has not arrived at the seat of the whole trouble.
  Here are the constructive idealists of every nation, thinking much the same
  thing, hopeful for peace, common courtesy, social justice, and the good life;
  but kept apart, alienated from one another, because the priests&mdash;" His
  impromptu speech broke off inconclusively.</p>

  <p>"The great Buddha," said Lan Ying, "built nothing of a material sort, and
  what little organizing he accomplished was limited to the guidance he gave to
  people who wished to walk in 'The Way'. According to the story, he found God
  while sitting at meditation under the shade of a banyan tree; and, all his
  life, after that, he was a homeless wanderer. And the great Jesus, he built
  no temple. I think he, too, lived out-of-doors mostly: is it not so? Sen Ling
  often talked about these things. He would say, 'This Jesus knew what the
  temples were doing to men's religious aspirations.' I have heard my
  foster-father recite the story of Jesus' comments when some people of another
  province asked him which was the right temple for them to attend. He said,
  'The time will come when neither in your country's temples nor mine will men
  worship God; for He is a spirit.'"</p>

  <p>There was a little silence before Jack ventured to respond to this. It had
  been a very long time since he had given any thought to these enigmatic
  phrases. They seemed to carry a new significance when relayed from China.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;your Sen Ling thinks the temples&mdash;all the temples
  everywhere&mdash;really impede the practical usefulness of religion," he
  said, his eyes asking for a confirmation.</p>

  <p>"May-bee I should not venture to speak for my foster-father, in reply to
  that," countered Lan Ying, cautiously. "It is a strong statement. Sen Ling
  was always most temperate in his speech."</p>

  <p>"But he thought the priests of all religions were&mdash;whether they
  realized it or not&mdash;a menace to the good life, did he not?" persisted
  Jack.</p>

  <p>"I think," responded Lan Ying, slowly, "Sen Ling was unhappy for them. He
  always spoke of them with respect, sometimes with pity. He often had long
  talks with them and was verree generous whenever they asked him for support.
  I think he felt that they were mostly honest and sincere. But they were
  caught in the machinery of the temple. The ancient traditions held them fast.
  There was not much they could do about it."</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;they could go out on their own," argued Jack.</p>

  <p>"And be discredited and misunderstood. That takes much courage."</p>

  <p>"Jesus did it," Jack found himself saying, somewhat to his own
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Lan Ying, "but not for long. And not many men are so brave
  as that."</p>

  <p>Jack wondered if priests shouldn't be as brave as soldiers in an army, and
  voiced his thought.</p>

  <p>"A sincere priest should be willing to lose his life, if necessary. Don't
  you think so, Lan Ying?"</p>

  <p>"May-bee&mdash;but many a man would be willing to lose his life, who would
  not be willing to lose face."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;lose face with the organization&mdash;and the temple?"</p>

  <p>"If the medical profession was making big mistakes, Jack, and you should
  tear up your doctor's licence and go out on your own, what would become of
  you? May-bee the doctors would make things verree difficult for you. And the
  people, too. They would lose confidence&mdash;and you would lose face.
  May-bee it is much the same with the priest and his temple. Sen Ling often
  said that there was no remedy in sight."</p>

  <p>"And what do <i>you</i> think about it all, Lan Ying?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged slightly and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Why should <i>I</i> have opinions about it? Have I not enough little
  worries of my own, without making myself unhappy over <i>that?</i> May-bee
  that is the way everyone feels."</p>

  <p>"Well," drawled Jack, with satisfaction, "the laboratory is a good enough
  temple for me. I don't say that our laboratory is better than anyone else's,
  or that the work being done in other laboratories is futile. In fact, I
  happen to know that there are plenty of better laboratories than ours and I
  wish that ours could be improved." He chuckled dryly and added, "How's that,
  Lan Ying, for the proper attitude toward competitors?"</p>

  <p>She studied his eyes, thoughtfully, for a long moment.</p>

  <p>"May-bee the time may come, Jack," she remarked, gently, "when neither in
  your laboratory nor theirs will you find what you are really seeking. May-bee
  Science is a spirit, too, I do not know." She drew a self-reproachful little
  sigh. "I think I have been talking too much&mdash;about things I do not
  understand. Please forgive me."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, dear"&mdash;Jack's tone was reassuring&mdash;"I think
  you have a very tidy mind, and the things you have been saying are of
  importance. Perhaps I haven't quite kept up with you, though, in what you
  have just said&mdash;about Science as a 'Spirit'. Wouldn't you like to go on
  with that, a little way?"</p>

  <p>"It is verree difficult," she replied, her perplexity showing in her
  narrowed eyes. "I am not sure what it is I want to say. We were speaking of
  God as a spirit. He requires no house, no walls, no machinery. Perhaps it is
  good for people to build a beautiful temple where they may sit in quiet
  meditation, surrounded by things of great beauty, lovingly made by skilful
  hands. But God is not limited to the temple. People may find Him elsewhere,
  for He is a spirit.... Now&mdash;you have said that Science is your god,
  and the laboratory is your temple. Very good. But&mdash;" She floundered
  helplessly, and murmured, "I do not know."</p>

  <p>"I think I see what you are driving at, Lan Ying," said Jack. "Buddha and
  Jesus found God out in the open&mdash;under a tree, along the road, by a
  water-fall, on a mountain, in a flower. Now, that's very pretty, and any
  pagan will approve. Buddha and Jesus found the old temples suffocating. And
  we scientists find the laboratories suffocating, too. But our case is
  different. We have to stay there, whether we like it or not, because our
  instruments of research are there. Our god is not emotional and he does not
  take any stock in <i>our</i> emotions. He deals with hard facts and has
  respect for us only so long as <i>we</i> deal with hard facts."</p>

  <p>"May-bee emotions are hard facts, too," ventured Lan Ying. "May-bee your
  Science-god would like you to look into that." She smiled brightly,
  signifying that she was prepared to abandon the serious phases of their
  discussion. Jack was pleased with her decision to carbonate the heavy
  talk.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't you like to have some hot tea?" he inquired. "I'm afraid Abbot
  has served this lukewarm."</p>

  <p>"It is verree good, I think. Tea should not be served hot. Heat destroys
  the flavour."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless you have a more sensitive palate than mine, Lan Ying. In fact,
  I am quite sure you have&mdash;in respect to <i>everything.</i> I wish I had
  your neural reactions, your keen sensitivity. Believe me&mdash;I could make
  good use of it in my microscopy."</p>

  <p>Lan Ying smiled indulgently, laid aside her napkin, and made no reply.</p>

  <p>"Shall we return to the living-room?" suggested Jack.</p>

  <p>"Shall we be seeing Mr Abbott again?" inquired Lan Ying.</p>

  <p>"Probably not. Want me to call him?"</p>

  <p>"Please."</p>

  <p>Jack rang the bell and Abbott appeared, bowing.</p>

  <p>"Miss Hilton would like to speak to you," explained Jack.</p>

  <p>"How soon will you be going home to China?" asked Lan Ying.</p>

  <p>"Two years&mdash;three years&mdash;four years: I do not know," replied
  Abbott, vaguely. "I have no plans."</p>

  <p>"When you do go, would you find it a burden to call on my foster-father,
  Sen Ling, in Hong Kong, and convey the regards of his unimportant
  daughter?"</p>

  <p>"It would be a great honour," said Abbott, bowing very low.</p>

  <p>"Sen Ling is greatly interested in doctors. You might enjoy his
  acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"A very high privilege. Thank you, Miss Hilton."</p>

  <p>Lan Ying rose and bowed to Abbott as if he were a prince, and Abbott
  outdid himself with the bow he made in return. Jack watched this dignified
  pantomime with amused interest. Then, disregarding him, the two of them
  definitely went Chinese, Lan Ying delivering a sentence that had the general
  flavour of an amenity appropriate to a leave-taking, Abbott responding with
  much dignity.</p>

  <p>Preceding Jack from the dining-room, Lan Ying&mdash;who seemed rosily
  flustered over something that had happened&mdash;glanced up over her shoulder
  to remark, "We were saying 'Good-bye'."</p>

  <p>"I guessed it was something like that. How do you say it in Chinese?"</p>

  <p>"I told him I hoped that he might rest in peace, a verree long time from
  now, with his ancestors."</p>

  <p>"And then," guessed Jack, "he probably said much the same thing to
  you."</p>

  <p>She did not reply at once; sauntered across the room; studied the titles
  of his books; seemed eager for a fresh topic of conversation. Jack's
  curiosity was stirred; and he said as much.</p>

  <p>"He was verree polite, Jack, but he did not rest me in peace with my
  ancestors, as he was expected to. He made me a wish&mdash;a verree nice, very
  hopeless wish.... I see you have the Life of the great Doctor Osler.
  Should I read it? Is it difficult?"</p>

  <p>Jack laid his hand upon her arm.</p>

  <p>"What was it Abbott wished?" he asked, gently.</p>

  <p>Lan Ying shook her head and continued to inspect the bookshelves.</p>

  <p>"Not going to tell me?" persisted Jack.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;please."</p>

  <p>"Was it&mdash;anything relating to me?"</p>

  <p>"To us," she answered, barely above a whisper.</p>

  <p>Jack drew her closer.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he wished that we could be together&mdash;always." Jack's voice
  was unsteady. "Was that it, dear?"</p>

  <p>"Something like that," murmured Lan Ying.</p>

  <p>For an exultant moment, they clung tightly to each other.</p>

  <p>"I wish that too, darling," said Jack, deeply stirred.</p>

  <p>Lan Ying did not raise her face, even when, with his hand beneath her
  lovely chin, Jack would have turned it to his eager lips. She held her head
  tightly against his breast for a moment. Then she gently drew out of his
  arms.</p>

  <p>"Let us not make this too hard for each other, Jack," she urged, looking
  up into his face earnestly. "We must remember our resolution."</p>

  <p>"I have forgotten it." Jack's whisper was husky. "Lan Ying&mdash;Lan
  Ying&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The sharp ring of the telephone startled them both. Jack frowned.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll let it ring," he said, indecisively.</p>

  <p>"You had better answer it," advised Lan Ying. "It might be something
  important."</p>

  <p>He went reluctantly to the telephone.</p>

  <p>"Yes?&mdash;this is Dr Beaven.... Yes, Miss McFey....
  Oh&mdash;that's too bad.... Delirious, eh?... What's she running now?...
 Well&mdash;that's too high.... I'll be there presently.</p>

  <p>"Damn it, Lan Ying, I've got to go to the hospital. One of Tubby's
  patients. I would ask you to wait for me here, but this is the sort of thing
  that may keep me tied up all night.... Now you see the kind of life I
  live."</p>

  <p>"It is all right, Jack. What else can you do? You must go, at once. Will
  you call a cab for me?"</p>

  <p>"I'll drive you to the hotel."</p>

  <p>He found her coat, and his own. At the door, his hand on the knob, Jack
  turned suddenly and held out his arms. Lan Ying, advancing, was in them
  before she was aware. But she did not draw back.</p>

  <p>"I can't go, darling," he whispered, almost fiercely. "There is so much
  more we have to say."</p>

  <p>"May-bee it is better so, Jack. It has been a lovely visit. Thank you for
  being so good to me. I shall be verree glad to remember."</p>

  <p>She lifted her eyes now to meet his, and he kissed her.</p>

  <p>"You said&mdash;we must not do that&mdash;any more," whispered Lan
  Ying.</p>

  <p>"I know, darling. We mustn't." He kissed her again, and this time her arms
  crept up to circle his neck. There was a moment when they were the only two
  persons in all the world.</p>

  <p>Lan Ying kissed him gently, and withdrew her arms.</p>

  <p>"Come," she murmured, breathlessly. "You are needed. We must go."</p>

  <p>He did not release her.</p>

  <p>"Life is very cruel!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>She laid a small, cool palm on his cheek, tenderly.</p>

  <p>"No," she said, with a little sigh, "life is verree good. And our
  friendship is verree precious. Let us be thankful."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Perched on a tall stool by the north light in Dr Forrester's laboratory,
  Jack Beaven was examining a smear provided by the Buckley child. The smear
  had not been hard to get, for the infected lesion was draining freely.</p>

  <p>Dr Beaven was unhappy about Martha who, though not registering quite so
  high a temperature as she had last night, was still a very sick girl. But in
  all other respects the promising young neurological surgeon was in a state of
  unprecedented rapture, warmed and vitalized by the memory of his recent
  experience. He felt himself in a new world.</p>

  <p>It was difficult, this morning, to concentrate on a problem demanding
  precision. Jack had let Abbott do the blood-chemistry but had decided to
  inspect the smear himself. His thoughts raced about aimlessly. And as he
  adjusted the stereoscopics of the big Greenhough binocular he whimsically
  wished there was a pair of small knurled wheels leading into his
  head&mdash;one directly above each ear&mdash;which might be as easily and
  effectively regulated for the focusing of his mind. It was too bad about
  Martha Buckley, but nothing so sweetly stirring had ever occurred as the
  parting from Lan Ying, last night, at his apartment.</p>

  <p>How understanding she was! That note, sent to the hospital at midnight by
  a messenger&mdash;who but Lan Ying would have had the thoughtfulness? He had
  been sitting beside Martha's bed, watchfully waiting for better signs, and
  the note had come up.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Jack," she had written, "it is likely you may not
  feel safe in leaving your patient in the morning to see me off on the train.
  You have enough on your mind without wondering how you are to dispose of me.
  I am just as anxious as you are that you may do your duty. This comes first.
  You will never need to explain that to me. Thank you for everything. I shall
  write as soon as I am home again.</p>

  <p class="letter">'LAN YING.'"</p><br>

  <p>Surely a girl of that sort need not be thought of as an obstacle to one's
  professional efficiency. She would always understand. She would not only
  understand, but she would offer the finest type of comradely co-operation. He
  could safely ask her to marry him. The McFey girl, having observed his
  arrival in dinner clothes, had murmured her regret and sympathy over the
  necessity to summon him, and he had made short work of her solicitude. After
  Lan Ying's note had come, he had said to McFey, "You're tired. Better sneak
  down and get a cup of tea. Take a half-hour to it. I'll be here." And McFey
  had thanked him gratefully, adding, "I think it is a shame you had to come
  back to-night!" And Jack had rejoined, in a tone resonant with pride, "It
  might be worse. The trouble about these emergency calls is that one's abrupt
  departure disappoints others. I have been dining with people who understand."
  It was a pretty long speech for Jack to make, and McFey had been very
  attentive; also seemed a bit bewildered, apparently feeling that there was
  something at the back of it which might be of great interest. She waited,
  bright-eyed, for further comments. Jack had obliged her by adding, "Friends
  like that are worth having, don't you think?" McFey had nodded
  enthusiastically and said she certainly did. And then she had tarried a
  little in the hope that his incredible garrulity might continue, but he had
  terminated his remarks suddenly with "Well&mdash;hop along now, and have a
  breathing spell." After she had left the room, Jack had read Lan Ying's note
  again. She had said exactly the right thing at the right time. He was very
  proud of her.</p>

  <p>This morning he was still rejoicing. He had sent her a note expressing his
  appreciation of her attitude toward his job; had closed it with "You are a
  wonderful girl, Lan Ying!" Perhaps it was just as well, he thought, that he
  was unable to accompany her to the station. Their parting had been
  perfect.</p>

  <p>He filled his pipe, and, neglecting to light it, stared out at the grey
  sky. A few early snowflakes were falling. Jack had never welcomed winter.
  Slushy streets, bare trees, and a bleak sky depressed him. The drabness
  seemed to percolate through into one's very soul. It was more difficult to
  sustain a patient's morale during the sunless days when there was so frail a
  reason why anyone should make an effort to rise up and rejoin such a dour and
  dismal world. And then there was the ventilation problem. If there was an
  institution in dire need of fresh air it was a hospital, and in winter the
  difficulty in getting enough invigorating air while maintaining a temperature
  suitable to persons of depleted vitality was almost insurmountable. Any way
  you looked at it, a doctor's winter was a bore and a nuisance.</p>

  <p>But to-day there was something almost gay about these snow-flakes. They
  did not threaten you with long weeks of tiresome stuffiness but promised to
  provide an appropriate setting for the comforts of your own blazing fire. It
  would be fun to hear winter howling around the corners and swishing sleet
  against the windows, if you had someone you loved sharing this snug security.
  He had now definitely decided to ask Lan Ying to be his wife. It did not
  occur to him to wonder whether she would consent. He took that for granted.
  She had made no secret of her feelings toward him; was cheerfully willing to
  be his "friend for ever" if that was his wish; would be equally willing to
  marry him if he proposed it. His firm resolution to remain single, for the
  sake of his work, had better be abandoned. He could break that resolve now
  without feeling that he had committed a crime against his own life-plan. It
  had become clear that Lan Ying, far from interfering with that design for
  living, would improve his chances of professional success. Indeed, if he were
  to give her up now the memory of what he had lost would torture him for ever.
  Self-discipline, if it served you to any good purpose, must become automatic.
  If you fretted over your sacrifices, you had better not make them&mdash;so
  far as your work was concerned. Yes&mdash;he was going to marry Lan Ying, as
  soon as it could be arranged. And it wouldn't require very much
  arranging.</p>

  <p>Lan Ying would be watching these snowflakes from her car-window. Perhaps
  she, too, would be glad to see them come. Maybe she would be sharing his
  thoughts, wondering how it might seem to have a home and a hearth of her own.
  It was not inconceivable that Lan Ying had formed some ideas about his stern
  resolution on the subject of marriage. He smiled happily over the
  recollection of last night's glorious events. He had kissed her and she had
  reminded him of their pact. He was never going to kiss her again. And now he
  had kissed her. And having admitted that he mustn't do it, he had kissed her
  again. And Lan Ying, though zealous to keep her end of the bargain, had
  wrapped her arms around his neck and stood on tiptoe to be kissed again.
  That's what <i>she</i> thought of their lofty aspiration to remain merely
  good friends. A little shiver of ecstasy ran through him. How ridiculous of
  him to have imagined he could live without Lan Ying.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>That afternoon at four, he left word that he had to go down town on
  important business. Perhaps it was foolish to do this thing so impetuously,
  but now that he had come to a definite decision he wanted to record it
  somehow; wanted to burn the bridges behind him.</p>

  <p>It might be some time before he would have a chance to see Lan Ying, but
  it would be a comfort to prepare for that event. He would carry the ring in
  his pocket. The thought warmed him. The ring would be hers. He would be
  carrying something of hers in his pocket; something symbolic of all that they
  had come to mean to each other.</p>

  <p>He had had very little occasion to visit the exclusive jewellery shop in
  the Walton Building, and they did not recognize him. Nor did he identify
  himself until it came time to write a cheque in four figures.</p>

  <p>Late that night, wearied by a crowded evening at the hospital, but in a
  fine glow of pride over his new possession, Jack sat at his desk with the
  beautiful ring in his hand, holding it in his palm caressingly, slowly
  tipping it to the light, marvelling at its kaleidoscopic moods, its exquisite
  revelations of lambent orange and green, its sudden flashes of white
  fire.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER dinner Tubby strolled out to the club car, lighted a
  cigar, and gave himself to the organization of his address to the Medical
  Society.</p>

  <p>Of course they would want him to relate some of his experiences at the
  Neurological Congress in Vienna which he would be glad enough to do, for the
  conference had been of immense interest.</p>

  <p>Doubtless somebody, who knew him pretty well, would bait him to comment on
  Bill Cunningham's widely publicized convocation speech. He would have to be
  careful. Deeply as he resented the intrusion of Cunningham's influence and
  the inevitable effect it would have on his own work, it would be a serious
  mistake to betray to that company the exact state of his feelings.</p>

  <p>For two reasons, he must attempt to deal with the matter rather casually,
  as if it were of no great consequence. It would be unfortunate if the New
  York crowd suspected a serious rift between him and his old crony. And if he
  lost his temper while talking about Bill's silly theories, it might convey
  the impression that he himself was under fire and on the defensive.</p>

  <p>And neither of those things would be true. Cunningham's invasion would be
  a seven-day wonder, after which everybody would forget about it and business
  would go on as usual. It would be a mere flash in the pan. And it wouldn't be
  true to imply that he and Bill were unfriendly. They had meant too much to
  each other; it would take more than a clash of opinion to disrupt the old
  ties.</p>

  <p>If he were prodded into an expression of his feelings in regard to Bill
  and his practice, he must make certain that no word or sign of disrespect or
  annoyance should creep in. It might be well to give this conciliatory mood a
  preliminary workout. He would say of Bill Cunningham that he was a royal
  fellow, a loyal friend. And it would be true. He wasn't going to indulge in
  any reminiscences, but he would indicate that their youthful association had
  been mutually cherishable.</p>

  <p>Having decided on his course of action, Tubby thought for a long time
  about the close relationship he and Bill had sustained as fellow-interns. No
  matter how irritated he might be over the unpleasant situation that had
  arisen in the Medical College, he would never be able to forget Bill's
  stabilizing influence on him when he had experienced the shock that had
  reappraised his world and sent him out to be quite another person than he had
  thought.</p>

  <p>Tubby could meditate on that event now&mdash;at a distance of more than
  three decades&mdash;without any emotional discomfort. The deep lesion had
  been slow to heal, but it had healed. Once in a while the scar tissue around
  the fracture was a bit troublesome&mdash;like a cracked patella on a foggy
  morning&mdash;but for the most part the damaged area was insensitive.
  Sometimes, when a case like William Mason's came into the hospital, revealing
  a long grind of unnecessary and inexcusable suffering due to an ignorant
  diagnosis and futile treatment, the memory of his own tragedy would flare up,
  and for a few days all persons having business with Tubby were advised to
  walk softly and humbly in his presence, and speak only when spoken to.</p>

  <p>But even on these occasions he did not grieve over Laurel: he would be too
  much occupied with his hatred and contempt&mdash;noisily detonated with the
  violence of a rusty old bomb accidentally molested on an abandoned
  battlefield&mdash;when some unforgivable case of malpractice reminded him of
  Doc Fetterbaum.</p>

  <p>Tubby did not often think about Laurel any more. She belonged to his
  youth, and he had early arrived at a maturity that viewed youth as an
  inconvenience which any sensible person should put behind him with all
  possible dispatch. Were Laurel restored to him to-day, as she was when she
  left him, he wouldn't have known what to do with her. She would have been
  young enough to be his daughter, with a dozen years to spare. He had not even
  looked at her picture for ages. All through his college course and the
  Medical School and the first three years of his internship, it had
  stood&mdash;easel-fashion&mdash;on his chiffonier. After her death, he had
  slipped it into the lower drawer of his desk. He couldn't bear to have it in
  sight.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a very good picture anyway. Laurel was too naïvely honest to
  take a good picture. She couldn't pose. Her chief charm was her
  unexpectedness, her childish audacities, her inability to conform to the
  angular patterns of conventional behaviour. If you failed to record this
  natural tendency to caprice, in doing a picture of Laurel, you hadn't
  captured her at all. The old photograph showed her in a costume that didn't
  give her the slightest chance to be herself. They should have got her picture
  on the tennis court, hot and tousled, with her mouth open, and her amazing
  vitality popping her seams. Tubby's secreted photograph of Laurel showed her
  dignifiedly posed as one of the last exponents of the "Gibson" era; a wasp
  waist, multitudes of ruffles, big sleeves, a tight collar that rammed her
  ear-lobes with whalebones, an enormous hat set at a rakish angle that gave
  the lie to the humourless smile. Doubtless the fellow had said,
  "Now&mdash;just a little happier, please"&mdash;and had taken off the
  camera-cap and counted ten, very slowly, while Laurel had become more and
  more unhappy. Indeed, Laurel in her coffin had been less unlike her vivacious
  self than Laurel in the photograph.</p>

  <p>Tubby twisted in his chair and stared out into the night as the comet he
  was riding roared and screamed through a little nebula, glanced at his watch,
  and nodded thoughtfully. This was Springville. The last time he had stopped
  off was when his father died. There was no reason for coming here any more.
  Of late years, when he passed through the town, he didn't even look out of
  the window; probably wouldn't have done so to-night if Bill Cunningham had
  not revived the old memories.</p>

  <p>Laurel's family had moved from Pittsburgh to Springville when she was
  sixteen. Her father had come as the new ceramic engineer at the Elmwood
  Pottery where half the men of the town and many of the young women were
  employed. Tubby had been a senior in high school then, definitely headed
  toward medicine. In fact, he had been headed toward medicine since he was
  twelve. Doc Fetterbaum had been responsible for that decision. Tubby's mother
  had been in a decline for many months with anæmia. Had her illness occurred
  now, it would have been a mere routine matter to put her on her feet promptly
  with a proper diet and skilful dosage of liver. Of course, Fetterbaum
  couldn't really be blamed for not knowing what to do about the case. Nobody
  knew much about anæmia at that time. Doc had called at the house two and
  three times a week, and was almost a member of the family before the end
  came. He would keep saying, "Milt&mdash;you must be a doctor." And Mother
  would smile wanly, and listlessly remark, "Yes&mdash;Milton talks about it
  sometimes."</p>

  <p>There were two other doctors in Springville, but they didn't stack up very
  high. Fetterbaum was busy day and night. You had to say that for him: he
  wasn't lazy. (But neither was Satan.) And everybody liked him; waved a hand
  to him. "Hi, Doc!" He knew almost every man in town by his first name, and a
  good many of the women; had delivered at least a third of the children over a
  period of fifteen years; remembered which ones had had scarlet fever, mumps,
  and measles; remembered even the names of their dogs and cats. Doc had owned
  one of the first automobiles ever seen on the streets of Springville, a
  Winton that was cranked in its midriff and had a door at the rear. He was
  amazingly versatile, omniscient, ubiquitous. He sang bass in the male
  quartette at the Presbyterian Church. It was a good quartette, too. Doc was
  also a deacon or something, and whenever a new parson was to be looked for
  (they came and went pretty fast), Doc was the scout who went to investigate
  promising candidates. He was a Mason and an Elk, Chairman of the Board of
  Directors of the Civic Improvement League, a director of the First National
  Bank, and President of the Library Association.</p>

  <p>His general practice comprehended everything that could possibly be the
  matter with anybody. His diagnoses were swift and he never so much as thought
  of calling a specialist into consultation. Before the Springville Hospital
  was built, practically all surgical cases&mdash;except minor repairs and
  normal obstetrics&mdash;were sent to Buffalo, and through those days Doc's
  mistakes were mostly limited to the field of internal medicine. Then came the
  hospital, Fetterbaum's own idea. And there was nothing the matter with the
  hospital. Everyone said it was a credit to the town, and it would have been
  so if Doc Fetterbaum had not been quite so fond of surgery. There wasn't
  anything he wouldn't take a shot at. He had even operated a pineal tumour in
  the days when there were only four men in the United States (and Fetterbaum
  was not one of them) who would have attempted the job. Nothing interested Doc
  so much as to spread out some fellow-citizen and do an exploratory. Had
  justice been served, his penitentiary sentences for shameless and wanton
  malpractice&mdash;if laid end to end&mdash;would have kept him in prison
  until the Day of Judgment.</p>

  <p>But Doc Fetterbaum was so popular that nobody cared to risk a criticism of
  his professional activities. It was quite beyond thought that the other
  doctors would protest, to no purpose except to incur a charge of jealousy.
  Everyone said he was far too good for the town and might make three times as
  much money in a big city, which was probably true.</p>

  <p>Tubby had not thought about Doc Fetterbaum with such calmness for
  thirty-two years. Fetterbaum was the one proper noun that touched Tubby with
  the certainty of an electric shock and sent him careening into a red rage.
  To-night, for some unaccountable reason, he was remembering the obnoxious
  fellow as he had known him in his own boyhood. He recalled that he had come
  as nearly idolizing Doc Fetterbaum as any human being he had ever met; would
  have jumped off the top of the Springville water-tower if Doc had told him
  to. He relieved again his sensations when Doc came down to the station to see
  him off for his first year at medical school. "Remember, Milt," Doc had said,
  impressively, "I am counting on you. I'll be thinking of you, every day.
  You're going to be a fine doctor." And Tubby again heard himself saying,
  unsteadily, "I only hope I can be half as good a doctor as you." (As good a
  doctor as Fetterbaum&mdash;the damn' quack!) That had been quite a dramatic
  moment. Tubby had stood on the rear platform and watched the little group at
  the station fade out, saw&mdash;and with much pride&mdash;Doc's protective
  air as he moved toward his car with Laurel by his side. He would drive her
  home and tell her, on the way, that Milt was destined for a bright future.
  She didn't know, then, that Doc Fetterbaum was going to murder her, one day,
  with his brassy ignorance.</p>

  <p>Tubby let his memories ramble back to the first time he had seen Laurel.
  There was a flock of young girls sitting on the grass watching the tennis. He
  had been pretty fast on his feet at eighteen. After the game he was trundling
  his bicycle across the high-school lawn and had overtaken the bevy of
  freshman girls ambling toward the street. He had said "Hello", impersonally,
  and they had said "Hello". They were all munching peanuts. One of the
  girls&mdash;a taffy-haired, freckled, blue-eyed stranger, whose intentions to
  be a grown-up woman, one of these days, were attractively on record&mdash;had
  held out her paper bag toward him. "Peanut?" she said, hospitably. He knew
  instinctively that she hadn't done it to be fresh. She wanted to make
  friends; that was all. So&mdash;he had helped himself, at her suggestion, and
  fallen into step beside her.</p>

  <p>"What's your name, kid?" he had asked. It wasn't considered common or
  crude, in those days, for youngsters to call each other "kid". Husbands and
  wives called each other "kid".</p>

  <p>"Laurel Hughes. We've just moved here."</p>

  <p>"Hope you like us. My name's Forrester."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;they told me. Gee&mdash;I wish I had a serve like yours."</p>

  <p>"You play tennis?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't had much chance to, yet. Have another peanut?" Laurel had
  steadied the bicycle while Tubby fumbled in the bag.</p>

  <p>"Want to come down here early, some morning? Maybe I could coach you a
  little."</p>

  <p>"Gee&mdash;that would be marvellous, Mr Forrester!" Her wide eyes had
  shone. "I'm afraid it wouldn't be much fun for you."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow&mdash;about eight?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow's Sunday."</p>

  <p>He agreed that to-morrow was Sunday and said they would do it some other
  time soon. "Of course," he had added, "we might sneak down here about six
  o'clock, before anyone's awake&mdash;if you could do it without getting into
  trouble at home."</p>

  <p>"My folks wouldn't care, Mr Forrester. I'll come&mdash;if you want
  to."</p>

  <p>"My name's Milt. Sounds as if your folks weren't very religious."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;they aren't silly about it. But&mdash;Gee!&mdash;can I call
  you Milt? I'm only a frosh."</p>

  <p>"Sure," Tubby remembered saying, beneficently. "That's all right, Laurel.
  I never knew anybody named Laurel. Pretty name, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I guess so. I never thought much about it. I'll tell my father you said
  that. He likes my name too."</p>

  <p>"Your father a good egg?"</p>

  <p>"Peach!"</p>

  <p>"Mother?"</p>

  <p>"You bet! She's lovely! There's more difference in age between my little
  sister and me than between my mother and me!"</p>

  <p>Tubby was trying to puzzle this out when Laurel, laughing at his
  perplexity, explained, "Gretchen's my stepmother, and little Gretchen is my
  small sister: she's three. You any brothers and sisters?"</p>

  <p>"Older sister. She runs the house. My mother's dead."</p>

  <p>"Father?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah," Tubby had replied.</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Laurel. "Have some more peanuts."</p>

  <p>That's the way Laurel was&mdash;even as an inexperienced youngster. You
  didn't have to go to much bother when you explained things to her.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;he's all right," Tubby had been moved to say in an attempt to be
  loyal. "A little bit snappy sometimes. I guess he didn't have much fun when
  he was a kid. He doesn't play very much."</p>

  <p>The little knot of girls were waiting at the corner. Laurel said, "I must
  catch up. See you in the morning. 'Bye."</p>

  <p>"'Bye, Laurel. Better not say anything to the other kids."</p>

  <p>"But I can tell my folks?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! Bring 'em along if you want to."</p>

  <p>"Gee! That'll be wonderful! My father likes me to take walks with him,
  Sunday mornings. Thanks, Milt."</p>

  <p>"'Bye, kid."</p>

  <p>"'Bye."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Laurel had been too guileless to be coy. From the very first, she made no
  secret of her feelings. Within a few weeks it was an understood fact that she
  was his girl. The other high-school youngsters grinned, but it was no fun to
  tease them: they were so candid about their mutual devotion.</p>

  <p>Looking back upon those distant days, Tubby wondered if he hadn't been an
  awful nuisance to the Hughes family. His own home was anything but
  interesting. His father was a dour, taciturn, albeit not ungenerous person,
  who spent most of his evenings doing difficult problems in calculus after
  long days in his greenhouses and gardens at the edge of town where he
  specialized in expensive tulips. Tubby's sister Minnie&mdash;christened
  Wilhelmina&mdash;was an apathetic old burden-bearer at twenty-four, who
  occasionally remarked that she wished she had never been born, a tardy
  aspiration which nobody ever tried very hard to talk her out of. Minnie was
  neat as a pin, and about as entertaining. There was no occasion for
  frugality, and Minnie could have anything she wanted; but she never wanted
  anything.</p>

  <p>So&mdash;young Milt Forrester had spent much of his time at the Hughes's
  where he presently came to have the same freedom enjoyed by their red cocker
  spaniel. If the chops hadn't been ordered in time to catch the late afternoon
  delivery (Gretchen had never taken any prizes for household management), Milt
  would ride down town on his bicycle and get them, and if Gretchen had
  forgotten to tell him to order an extra one for himself he would have the
  thoughtfulness to correct this oversight. But if he was a pest, the Hughes
  household had not certified him as such; at least, not with enough emphasis
  to make him aware. He ran innumerable errands, repacked leaky faucets, helped
  Laurel with her Latin, reported the telephone out of order, drowned the
  superfluous kittens, seeded cherries, burned leaves, shovelled snow, and
  split kindling. By common consent he was a member of the family in such good
  and regular standing that Mr Hughes&mdash;without looking up from his evening
  paper&mdash;would tell him to go down and poke up the furnace, and little
  Gretchen would nonchalantly back up to him for buttoning.</p>

  <p>Except for the inevitable Christmas card from Kansas City, he had not
  heard from little Gretchen for a half-dozen years, until a couple of months
  ago when she had written to express her feelings about young Jim's chance to
  go to college.</p>

  <p>There had been a quadrennium, a long time ago, when his correspondence
  with little Gretchen had required an enormous amount of time and thought.
  When the Elmwood Pottery had folded up, and Gretchen's father had lost his
  job, Tubby had sent her to Wellesley, after which she had married a not very
  promising chap and had drifted out of his life. During her college days, she
  confided all her problems to Tubby, soliciting his counsel in her choice of
  studies, her brief but frequent love affairs, and her little jangles with the
  Dean of Women. She faithfully reported how much she had spent last month, and
  for what, itemized down to the last nickel. She even sought his advice about
  her clothes. But after her marriage&mdash;which Tubby suspected was not very
  successful except in the rapid accumulation of a family&mdash;Gretchen's
  letters were increasingly wider-spaced and less difficult to answer. When the
  youngest of their too many children had died, she had told him all about it,
  and he had replied that he was very sorry, though he couldn't help
  feeling&mdash;privately&mdash;that the baby was probably just as well off to
  have died before realizing that the family was too large before his arrival.
  He had wished, afterward, that he had been a little more tender in that
  instance; but Gretchen's letter had come when he was unusually busy and he
  had been obliged to dictate his reply to his office secretary.</p>

  <p>Tubby drew out his memorandum book and pencilled a reminder that he must
  be sure to communicate with Gretchen this Christmas. Damn it! That was the
  way it went when you tried to help people turn a sharp corner. Then you had
  'em on your hands for ever, and they were hurt if you didn't promptly and
  exhaustively answer their letters when they told you all about their big and
  little days; their hopes, their fears, and&mdash;what was still harder to
  deal with&mdash;their endless expressions of gratitude which placed him in
  the silly role of a sentimental old Santa Claus. If they'd only be content to
  accept your assistance, dignifiedly thank you for it, pledge themselves to do
  their best&mdash;and thereafter let you alone! Couldn't they realize that you
  had other things to do besides listening, through all eternity, to their
  grateful pæans of praise? Soon as you did something for someone&mdash;mostly
  for the utterly cold-blooded purpose of getting them and their perplexities
  off your mind&mdash;then you could expect to have a lot of love and devotion
  hurled at you, and if you didn't reply with large basketfuls of similar mush,
  they would send you pensive queries beseeching you to tell 'em what they had
  done to offend you!</p>

  <p>Tubby bit the end off another cigar, and scowled darkly. There was
  Gretchen's boy, for example. He should have answered that letter without
  delay. It had been all of two months since this young Jim had written a dozen
  pages of lushy appreciation from Columbia, addressed to "Dear Uncle Milt".
  Damnit! He couldn't spend all his time writing letters; didn't know what to
  say to such people, anyhow. Jim's letter had made him feel like a hypocrite.
  He certainly hadn't experienced any seizures of love for this youngster; had
  volunteered to help him through college for the practical reason that if he
  was given a decent education he would be less likely to be a burden on
  somebody later. And then comes this maudlin letter. Tubby rummaged in his
  pocket for it; had brought it along, for the sake of the street address;
  might want to call Jim up, while he was in town. If the fellow should happen
  to notice, in the papers, something about this Medical Society banquet, he'd
  probably think he had been abused if he received no communication from his
  "dear Uncle Milt". Tubby opened the letter and frowned.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Uncle Milt:<br>
  <br>
  You can't help knowing that what you are doing for me is the same as saving
  my life. I wouldn't have been afraid or ashamed to work at a trade or behind
  a counter, but I don't believe I should ever have been very happy, for I'm
  crazy about electrical engineering and a fellow can't get anywhere with that
  unless he is trained for it, I am just as grateful to you, Uncle Milt, as if
  you had rowed out to me in a boat and rescued me from drowning. I never said
  any prayers until lately. But every day I do that, now. I'm not sure whether
  I say prayers to you or for you; but I say them, sir, and I think they are
  good for me, whether they do you any good or not.</p><br>

  <p>Tubby folded the letter, and shook his head. Damn it! You had to do
  something about a letter like that! But what? You mustn't call the boy up and
  say, "This is Dr Forrester speaking." That would give him a chill. You
  couldn't say, "This is your Uncle Milt." Hell! He wasn't going to be
  anybody's soft and silly old Uncle Milt!</p>

  <p>They had done all their switching and bumping in Buffalo and were
  gathering speed again on the next lap of the journey. Tubby yawned,
  stretched, and made his way back to his compartment; undressed, laid out his
  speech-notes on the bed, and prepared to put in an hour's work on them. He
  wanted this speech to be good. He stacked up a flock of pillows behind him,
  and attacked his job.</p>

  <p>The first entry made him grin. "Attic treasures." That would be ample to
  remind him that he had talked recently with the chief of the fire department,
  during which conversation he had inquired what was the most frequent cause of
  conflagrations, and the chief had replied, "Things in the attic that are too
  good to throw away but unfit for any use."</p>

  <p>This would make a nice point of departure. Plenty of doctors had their
  heads stored with old ideas that had cost a great deal in time, money, and
  mental labour. But, however much had been invested in them, they constituted
  a hazard. Tubby was going to have a spot of fun here. He would describe the
  inflammable treasures in the old garret. The more solidly dignified the
  family, the more hazardous possessions would have been accumulated;
  great-grandfather's brittle old rocking-chair, grandmother's diaries, Uncle
  Paul's rocking-horse&mdash;all equally useless and harmless until touched off
  by a stray spark. He wasn't going to elaborate the moral too expansively. The
  illustration would be able to take care of itself without any preaching. The
  fact was that the largest accumulation of once costly but now obsolete
  notions were stacked up in the heads of substantial, prosperous, highly
  respectable doctors who had arrived at the stage where they never acquired a
  new idea and never abandoned an old one.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't such a painful recollection, he would recite the story of Doc
  Fetterbaum. But he wouldn't be able to talk about Fetterbaum without getting
  embarrassingly enraged. All the same, it was a case that could be duplicated
  to-day in almost any town or city&mdash;the fellow who, by various
  philanthropies, civic-mindedness, cordiality, and tireless exercise of his
  sympathies, had won the full confidence of hundreds of people, but in actual
  fact was a menace to the community because of his brazen ignorance.</p>

  <p>Tubby sat for a long time with the notebook open but disregarded,
  reviewing that little group of desperate days when, hastily summoned home by
  the news of Laurel's serious illness, he had promptly suspected and then
  verified the Fetterbaum blunder that cost her life. She had been quite
  unconscious when he arrived at the little hospital. Fetterbaum, cooing
  sympathetic phrases, had admitted his helplessness; and, by that time, there
  was nothing he could have done had he been the best doctor in the world.</p>

  <p>According to the history of the case, a simple appendectomy, a week
  earlier, had been so strongly indicated that any competent diagnostician
  should have known it at a glance. But he had stalled along with ice-packs and
  sedatives. Then, when all the danger-signals were flying so high and wide
  that anyone could have seen it was a case requiring better surgery than
  Fetterbaum was capable of, he had waded in and touched off a peritonitis that
  spread like a prairie fire.</p>

  <p>Of course, nothing that Fetterbaum could have done or said, in that tragic
  hour when Laurel went out, would have soothed Tubby's feelings. But he took
  the position that this was just "one of those things", unfortunately likely
  to turn up once in a while; nobody's fault; something unpredictable. And then
  Fetterbaum had had the bad judgment to add, piously, with his hand on Tubby's
  shoulder, "It's our common lot, Milt. We can't be prepared for such sorrows,
  but they come eventually to us all."</p>

  <p>Tubby's fists clenched as he relived that hot moment. He had said nothing
  until now; afraid to say anything for fear he would impetuously say it all.
  But Fetterbaum's attitude of spiritual counsellor, at this moment of tension,
  was more than could be borne.</p>

  <p>"I don't want any of your sympathy!" Tubby had shouted. "'Can't be
  prepared for sorrows!' You'd better let somebody else mouth that kind of
  prattle, and ask yourself why you weren't prepared for surgery."</p>

  <p>Doc had stood, pale and shaky, stunned by the sudden outburst; probably
  the first time he had ever been grilled. Mr Hughes had taken Tubby by the
  arm. "No, no, Milt," he had muttered. "That won't help it." And Gretchen,
  holding out his hat and coat, and urging him to come now, looked as if he had
  committed some shocking crime.</p>

  <p>"No!" Tubby had gone on, indifferent to their quiet caution. "No&mdash;it
  won't help it. I know that. He will be doing the same thing again to-morrow.
  Because he doesn't know any better&mdash;and doesn't care. <i>Butcher!
  Quack!"</i></p>

  <p>Doc had made no reply; just stood there, white as the sheet they had drawn
  up over Laurel's blotched face; pretending he must be patient with the insane
  sputtering of an undisciplined young fellow's grief. That night Fetterbaum
  had come around to the house, but Tubby wouldn't see him. His father had
  slipped quietly into the bedroom where Tubby sat alone, and had said, "Doc
  wants to talk to you, son." And Tubby had replied, "There's nothing he can
  say that I want to hear." "He has always been mighty good to you, Milt. I'm
  afraid you'll be sorry." But Tubby had been glumly obdurate. He was all
  through with Fetterbaum.</p>

  <p>A couple of days later he had to endure the funeral. It was not only a
  very trying ordeal, but it had changed his ideas about many things which,
  until now, he had taken for granted without examination.</p>

  <p>Tubby hadn't given much thought to religion. The churches were recognized
  institutions that doubtless served a good purpose.</p>

  <p>In his adolescent mind they had been bracketed alongside the school, the
  public library, the waterworks, and the county court house. As a boy he had
  gone to Sunday School but had dropped out when he was eleven. There was no
  discipline in the younger classes, and it made him ashamed to be a party to
  the weekly bedevilment of a gentle-mannered Miss Runkel who seemed grieved
  over their disorder and inattention; and, inasmuch as it wasn't much fun to
  badger Miss Runkel, who never said anything that was of the slightest
  interest to him personally, he had stopped going. In fact his father, having
  learned that the place had so little consideration for the elementary
  decencies, had peremptorily refused to permit his further attendance.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, when he was half-grown, he reluctantly accompanied Minnie to
  the "socials", mostly for the reason that she would have a large basket of
  provisions to carry, and he was expected to help her. He had almost never
  attended church services, which he felt were intended for elderly people. As
  for funerals, he knew very little about them: couldn't recall that he had
  ever listened to anything said on such occasions.</p>

  <p>At Laurel's funeral, he listened, and was shocked at the quite obvious
  impotence of the church in its efforts to deal with so grave a disaster as
  his. The Reverend Blossom was unquestionably a kind man who went about doing
  good. Everybody made that comment. He had been in Springville long enough to
  have earned public confidence and respect, and his name was prominent on all
  the welfare committees. Mr Blossom and Doc Fetterbaum practically shaped the
  policies of such movements in the town.</p>

  <p>Tubby's overwrought mind had emerged from its state of stampede and was
  now prepared for whatever restoratives anybody might offer. His defences were
  all down. Nothing that anyone could say to-day would excite his controversy.
  He was seriously in need of help.</p>

  <p>Mr Blossom, in the impressive uniform of his sacred office, began reading
  some very quaint and more or less contradictory sentences from a small black
  book. Tubby had lifted his heavy eyes and paid wistful heed. He knew it was
  the church's chief business to handle such matters. He had always
  known&mdash;without anyone's telling him&mdash;that the church's "socials"
  and picnics and bazaars and amateur concerts, which furnished Minnie with the
  only diversions she enjoyed, simply represented the church at play. Now he
  would have a chance to see the church in action; doing its real job; offering
  spiritual guidance; and God knew he needed it.</p>

  <p>"I know that my Redeemer liveth," read the preacher, impressively, "and
  that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though worms
  destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God."</p>

  <p>Tubby didn't know what that meant, so he sat with bowed head and waited
  for something more intelligible to come along.</p>

  <p>"When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty
  to consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: every man
  therefore is but vanity."</p>

  <p>This couldn't possibly apply to Laurel who was innocent as snow. It was
  true that the past few days had consumed her beauty, but it wasn't her sins
  that had devoured her. Laurel hadn't been a bad girl. He could testify to
  that. She was just a wholesome, happy, good-natured kid. Tubby wasn't
  expecting the church to tell him why she had died; he knew that: Fetterbaum
  had killed her, unintentionally, of course, but Fetterbaum was responsible.
  Fetterbaum was a kind man who went about doing good, up to the very point of
  performing the real job he claimed as his vocation. And now the church was
  trying to make out that God had consumed Laurel's beauty as a rebuke for her
  sins. Or was that what the prophet or somebody had meant when he wrote the
  little black book? Or was it supposed to mean anything at all?</p>

  <p>"For we consume away in thy displeasure, and are afraid at thy wrathful
  indignation."</p>

  <p>Tubby felt pretty sure that Laurel hadn't known God was mad at her about
  anything. She wasn't afraid. There never had been a happier girl in the
  world. As the solemn voice droned on, Tubby could hardly believe his own
  ears. The church had invited him to come in here for consolation, and it had
  only increased his mental confusion. "Every man is therefore but vanity."
  What did that mean?&mdash;Every man is vain, or every man lives in vain?
  Probably the latter, for the clergyman had read, "He heapeth up riches and
  cannot tell who shall gather them." Surely a low estimate to place on human
  effort: it might apply to a rich miser, but it hadn't anything to do with
  Laurel. Why, reflected Tubby, hadn't the minister read Bryant's "Thanatopsis"
  instead? That was pure paganism, of course, but it was beautiful and
  honest&mdash;and you knew where you were. You were a child of Nature. You
  weren't a frightened child of a displeased god. You were a simple and humble
  brother of the trees and flowers and rivers. Nature wasn't mad at you. She
  was carrying out a long-term programme of birth and growth and dissolution.
  You were a member of an innumerable caravan en route to the silent halls of
  death. Why not accept the decree; and, when the summons came, lie down to
  pleasant dreams? Unless&mdash;of course&mdash;somebody had a better
  suggestion, and apparently the church did not.</p>

  <p>Shaking himself loose from his reverie, Tubby had become conscious that
  the minister was reading now about the future life. The dead would all sleep
  until a last trump would bring them all out of their graves, incorruptible.
  In his topsy-turvy state of mind, Tubby was temporarily attracted to the word
  "trump", which he had never heard except under circumstances which seemed to
  make it rather anachronistic in its present setting. By the time he was
  through ruminating on this, the service was about over.</p>

  <p>The undertaker's people had made several tiptoed trips to and fro,
  carrying flowers. Their procedure was stealthily efficient. Mr Blossom didn't
  have any very definite ideas about where Laurel was going, but the undertaker
  did. So, presently, Laurel&mdash;who had always lived so eagerly, radiantly,
  joyously&mdash;was slowly trundled down the aisle while the organ ground out
  the most depressing music ever heard.</p>

  <p>At the cemetery, the church simply gave the whole problem up with a
  pessimism so candid and conclusive that Tubby felt a sensation of utter
  hopelessness. There didn't seem any good reason for one's living, at all.</p>

  <p>"Man, that is born of a woman, hath but a short time to live, and is full
  of misery."</p>

  <p>Tubby, who had no religious convictions, knew this wasn't true. Life had
  its problems, but it wasn't quite that bad. If the church had absolutely
  nothing to say that could inspire or console a man in bereavement, common
  honesty suggested that it should confess its ignorance and impotence; but
  surely there was no reason why the church should make things out to be a lot
  worse than they really were. Laurel's life had not been full of misery. She
  had been as gay and happy as a lark.</p>

  <p>"Deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death."</p>

  <p>But that, again, had nothing to do with Laurel. Tubby had turned away,
  after the benediction, with a sense of heavy depression. Life didn't seem
  worth the bother. Maybe that was the state of mind the church had hoped to
  create on these occasions. It said, in substance, "Your loved one is gone;
  but, after all, what's the difference? Life is short and full of misery, and
  everybody would be better off dead."</p>

  <p>He found it hard to resume his normal habits of thinking. He had thought
  of the churches as belonging in the same category with the public utilities
  and the various public services. Your house caught fire and you telephoned
  for the fire department and it came. Maybe it couldn't put the fire out until
  it had done a lot of damage: maybe it couldn't put the fire out, at all. But
  it tried. The firemen didn't just stand there, in their uniforms, and sadly
  remark, "Oh, well; it wasn't much of a house, anyway. And all houses either
  burn up or fall down, sooner or later."</p>

  <p>Your beloved died and you went to the church to find out what should be
  your best course of thinking on the subject. The church had the material
  property and general equipment suggesting that it was prepared to deal with
  you on this occasion. But apparently the job was too big. Mr Blossom was a
  good man, but this sort of thing was too much for him. Perhaps he should have
  said so. Tubby felt that some of the public services on which people relied
  with almost pathetic confidence needed to be looked into. Fetterbaum had back
  of him a fine little hospital, trained nurses, plenty of implements&mdash;but
  see what he had done! Blossom, too, had enough machinery and
  tools&mdash;but&mdash;oh well, what was the use thinking about it any
  more?</p>

  <p>It was good old Bill Cunningham who had rescued him from complete despair.
  Tubby had telegraphed, and Bill had come at the first moment he could effect
  a release from his internship duties, arriving two hours after the funeral.
  Tubby, dispirited, had met him at the station; and Bill, after their
  handclasp, had said, "I want to go in here and make a Pullman reservation.
  You'll be ready to go back to-morrow night, won't you?"</p>

  <p>And Tubby had replied that he had thought of remaining at home for a week
  or two&mdash;until he felt a little more like working again.</p>

  <p>"You're not going to do anything of the kind," declared Bill. "There's
  nothing for you to do here&mdash;but sit and brood. And Laurel wouldn't want
  you to do that. Suppose she <i>knew?"</i></p>

  <p>"Do you believe that?" Tubby had inquired, earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I don't know anything to the contrary. I don't think we're
  supposed to know anything about it. Maybe it's part of the game&mdash;our not
  knowing. But&mdash;if Laurel <i>does</i> know, I think she'd be better
  pleased if you carried on like a good sport."</p>

  <p>They had stopped at the Hughes's on the way home; and Bill, instead of
  muttering some sad conventional phrases, had said, "I expect you were pretty
  proud to have had a girl like Laurel. Tubby has told me a lot about her." And
  Mr Hughes had brightened a little. And Gretchen had got out a recent snapshot
  of Laurel sitting on the end of a diving-board in her swimming-suit.</p>

  <p>"Great girl!" said Bill. "You must have had a lot of fun with her!"</p>

  <p>And then they had all talked about Laurel's vivacity and her pranks and
  how much everybody liked her, almost as if she wasn't dead, but merely away
  on a long voyage. Bill didn't seem to realize that he was saying the wrong
  things in a house of mourning, but the Hughes's realized that he was only an
  amateur in the business of offering consolation; didn't know enough about
  such matters to follow the rules; hadn't had enough experience with
  bereavement to understand that you oughtn't to talk about the dead as if they
  were still alive&mdash;somewhere. They stayed so long that Minnie telephoned
  to inquire whether Mr Cunningham had arrived, and left there with the promise
  that they would be back for lunch to-morrow.</p>

  <p>The family had followed them out to the car. "Little" Gretchen&mdash;she
  was nearly twelve then, an elfish, much-indulged child&mdash;was keeping so
  close to Bill that he gave her his hand as they sauntered down the walk.</p>

  <p>"How long can you stay?" she asked, wistfully.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow night. Have to go back to work, Gretchen."</p>

  <p>"It's awful&mdash;Laurel's not being here when Milt is home." Her voice
  wavered and her eyes filled up. "But she's never&mdash;never coming
  back."</p>

  <p>And Bill had had the audacity to say, brightly, "Don't fret, Gretchen.
  Maybe you'll see her again sometime. Funny things happen."</p>

  <p>Gretchen shook her head and dabbed at her eyes with a soggy little
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to miss her so!" she cried. "Laurel was so good to me. She
  taught me to swim and skate and play tennis&mdash;and everything."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;there you are!" said Bill. "There's a good deal of Laurel that
  didn't go away. Every time you swim and skate and play tennis&mdash;and
  everything, that will be Laurel; don't you see?"</p>

  <p>"I'll try to," Gretchen had mumbled, brokenly.</p>

  <p>Then they had said "Good-bye" all around, repeating that they would meet
  again to-morrow. Tubby had felt much improved. It seemed that a big weight
  had been lifted.</p>

  <p>"Glad you turned up, you old bum," he had muttered. "God!&mdash;but this
  has been a hard day. And the most awful thing about it all is that it needn't
  have happened. Fetterbaum practically murdered her."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;it has happened," Bill had replied, quietly, "and you can't
  unhappen it by being bitter."</p>

  <p>Tubby often thought of Bill's curious invention&mdash;"unhappen".
  Whenever, through the years, something decidedly unpleasant or unfortunate,
  had occurred, Bill's phrase would come back: "You can't unhappen it."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>They hadn't been seeing much of each other for several years. Of course
  that was partly to be explained by the fact that Bill had his own home. Tubby
  wasn't a very good visitor in a private home; hated small talk; despised the
  necessity to chatter for sheer sake of seeming amiable. And then, too, he and
  Bill couldn't be together for more than fifteen minutes until something would
  be said to provoke the old argument.</p>

  <p>Last time they had met&mdash;couple of years ago, at the State Medical
  Association in Grand Rapids&mdash;they had sneaked off to a downtown café for
  dinner, and had successfully staved off their usual controversy for a whole
  hour. They had had a good time until they got to grilling each other, Tubby
  accusing Bill of being a sloppy sentimentalist, and Bill accusing Tubby of
  being nothing but a high-toned mechanic. They had pretended, when they were
  done with it, that the raillery was all in fun; but each knew that it was a
  fortunate provision to have had an eight o'clock engagement in the hotel
  auditorium.</p>

  <p>"How's Mrs Cunningham?" Tubby had inquired dutifully, when the soup was
  being served.</p>

  <p>She was very well, thank you; very much occupied with social affairs;
  hopping about among the two dozen things she belonged to; good to the poor,
  bad at golf, worse at bridge.</p>

  <p>"I was just thinking about the time you made her mother sick," said Tubby.
  "I'd been invited to come along with you for dinner at the Whittakers'. We
  were hungry as panthers, and clawing into our food as if we'd just been
  rescued after a month on a raft. And just to make pleasant conversation,
  Edith's mother turned to you and twittered amiably, 'Were you given anything
  interesting to do to-day, Dr Cunningham?'"</p>

  <p>"We got quite a thrill out of being called 'Doctor', didn't we?"</p>

  <p>"It was ecstasy! Well&mdash;you replied, with your mouth full, 'We
  operated an abdominal tumour, Mrs Whittaker; big one, about the size of that
  roast.' Do you remember?" laughed Tubby.</p>

  <p>"A most unhappy comparison," admitted Bill. "I didn't quite realize what I
  had done until Mrs Whittaker pushed back her chair and excused herself."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and then, after an embarrassing silence, Edith said she would
  go and see if she could do anything for her mamma. And that left us with her
  old man." Tubby's eyes sparkled. "Do you recall what he said to you?"</p>

  <p>"He was a dry old chip, was Professor Whittaker. A man couldn't teach
  Geology for twenty-five years and have much cartilage left in him. Yes,
  Tubby, I remember. He said, 'Mr Cunningham, the next time you perform an
  operation on our dining-table, perhaps you'd better just amputate a
  leg&mdash;or something less mussy than an abdominal tumour.' And then
  <i>you</i> said&mdash;damn your disloyalty&mdash;you said, 'Next time,
  Professor Whittaker, we'll let Bill be the patient and we'll do some brain
  surgery.'"</p>

  <p>"Right!" said Tubby. "And then the old boy regarded me with an astringent
  stare and drawled, 'Oh?&mdash;I hadn't realized the student brain was
  sufficiently developed to be subject to disease.' And you said, 'I guess
  that'll hold you for a while.'"</p>

  <p>"But it didn't. You had the brass to go on from there, chattering about
  brain structure, so that when Edith and her mother got back, there you were,
  delivering an enlightening lecture fresh from the anatomical lab. You always
  did stick to your work, Tubby; in season and out of season."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;why shouldn't I?" Tubby had replied, soberly. "The surgeon's
  job is important enough to occupy his full time&mdash;and twenty-four hours a
  day."</p>

  <p>"I used to think that," said Bill.</p>

  <p>"And it accounts for your success. If you've stopped thinking that, so
  much the worse for you. Single-minded devotion to professional duty: that's
  the idea I try to get into the skulls of the young asses who'd rather study
  anatomy at the floor-show in the Blue Grotto. Believe <i>me,</i>
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You needn't elaborate," interrupted Bill. "It's common knowledge that
  you're a slave-driver, and proud of it. I wonder if you get the results
  you're after. Be honest, now, Tubby."</p>

  <p>"Not often; but often enough to justify the method. Now you take the case
  of young Beaven, my assistant. Brilliant fellow. But it has taken a lot of
  milling to make him what he is. It's an interesting story."</p>

  <p>Whereupon Tubby had indulged in a detailed recital of the curious relation
  between himself and his promising junior.</p>

  <p>"If you're asking <i>me,</i> Tubby," drawled Bill, "I should say that you
  two fools have dragged your old feud quite far enough. You'd better kiss and
  make up before your quarrel gets to be campus talk."</p>

  <p>"Can't change things now," declared Tubby, obdurately. "And anybody
  interested can easily see that it has been the making of Beaven. When he
  arrived for his first year he was so indifferent and impertinent that he
  needed a complete reorganization."</p>

  <p>"And you reorganized him, good and plenty; kept at it; still keeping at
  it."</p>

  <p>"But can't you see?" Tubby tried to keep his voice from shrilling. "He has
  turned out to be the most brilliant student we've had in a dozen years. I
  rode him hard, and he said to himself that he'd show me. The more I ridiculed
  him, the harder he worked. I was afraid to take off the heat for fear he
  would miss the only thing that was driving him&mdash;and get as lazy as the
  rest of 'em. Don't you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I hear what you're saying and I know what you mean&mdash;if
  that's understanding. But I don't share your view. I can't see how you could
  do this able youngster any damage with an occasional word of commendation on
  his fidelity to you and the job."</p>

  <p>Tubby twisted his head and shook it in prompt negation.</p>

  <p>"You don't know this chap, Bill. He's pretty deep, and he has a lot of
  pride; not the sort to be easily conciliated. Once, not very long ago, when
  we were doing a tricky bit of pathology together, I ventured an amiable
  comment and he gave me a stare that would freeze your blood."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it was just a look of astonishment," remarked Bill, dryly.
  "Sometimes people stare when they're amazed."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;we've made our bed and we'll have to lie in it. I expect to do
  Beaven every good turn possible, so long as he sticks to his knitting. If he
  can stay on the rails&mdash;the way he has been going&mdash;he will be heard
  from. If nothing turns up to interfere with the programme he has laid out for
  himself, he can have anything he wants and I shall do my utmost to help him
  to it."</p>

  <p>"Programme? What sort of programme? What are you trying to make of him,
  Tubby? Another eminent, highly refrigerated mechanic, like you?"</p>

  <p>Tubby snorted, and stabbed at his apple pie.</p>

  <p>"At least he'll not develop into a sweet and sticky sentimentalist," he
  growled.</p>

  <p>"Like me," assisted Bill, chuckling.</p>

  <p>"No offence intended," said Tubby, "but your theories are impractical in a
  medical school.... By the way&mdash;do you realize what time it is?"</p>

  <p>"I know. We must go. It has been good to have a chat with you again,
  Tubby. We must do it often."</p>

  <p>But they hadn't done it often. It was tacitly agreed that the less they
  conferred the more pleasant would be their memories of each other.</p>

  <p>To-night, as Tubby reviewed that conversation, he wondered if it might not
  have been better if he had taken Bill's counsel and shown Beaven a little
  more friendliness.</p>

  <p>Of course it was now quite too late for any hope of conciliation. He
  couldn't suggest letting bygones be bygones, and take the risk of having
  Beaven gloat over a decisive victory. It gave him a sickish sensation when he
  remembered Beaven's cool impudence and the contemptuous defiance in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Well&mdash;the cub would learn a thing or two before long. He'd find out
  what sort of position he had man&oelig;uvred himself into. The proper
  procedure now was to leave him severely alone; pay him no attention; ignore
  his existence; show no concern for anything he was doing; put him in
  Coventry; let him sweat. One of these days, he'd come creeping back with an
  apology&mdash;and then; well&mdash;then&mdash;we would see.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">EVERYBODY whose mood reacted to bad weather had found this
  third day of December very dispiriting. Since early morning it had been
  raining pitchforks from a low, slate-grey ceiling. The long icicles that had
  decorated the campus oaks and elms had been slimmed down to mere
  medicine-droppers. Chimneys debouched sooty coal-smoke into the murk. The
  street-lights had come on at noon, drawing jaundice-yellow pencil-marks
  across the wet asphalt.</p>

  <p>About two, a capricious wind-storm had risen, increasing in savagery until
  by mid-afternoon it was running berserk. Faculty umbrellas prudently reefed
  and jibbed while foolhardy student umbrellas tugged their shirts off over
  their bared ribs and defied the gale to do them any further damage. Hissing
  tyres spattered muddy water over soppy trouser-legs and highly vulnerable
  silk stockings.</p>

  <p>All classes were to be dismissed at three-forty-five to permit voluntary
  attendance at a special lecture in the Medical College Auditorium. Special
  lectures usually faced a dull market. Medics had quite enough required work
  to do without bidding for any unnecessary punishment. It was a fairly safe
  bet that at three-forty-five to-day whoever had a cosy room to go to would
  proceed to it with dispatch.</p>

  <p>At least this had been Tubby Forrester's private prediction. He had no
  mean desire to see his old friend Cunningham humiliated, but it would be good
  for Bill to observe the utter undependability of the young cubs who had
  cheered his brilliant convocation speech on a fine October day when everybody
  was expected to be on hand. Great was Bill Cunningham's faith in humanity at
  large; in medicine men particularly. The sight of an empty hall might be a
  timely lesson for him. It would help him realize, a little more clearly, what
  a professor was up against in endeavouring to inspire and instruct a lot of
  irresponsible crackpots who hankered to wear white duck and be called
  "Doctor".</p>

  <p>Tubby had been watching the calendar with uneasiness and perplexity. As
  the day for this first lecture of Bill's series drew nearer he had tried to
  think up a good reason for absenting himself. He might have found an
  apparently valid errand out of town but for the fact that he had just
  returned from many weeks in Vienna and the more recent jaunt to New York, and
  didn't care to have the Regents inquiring whether he was still on the
  University pay-roll. If he remained on the ground, he would have to attend
  Bill's lectures. He couldn't risk the charge of petty jealousy. But when he
  considered the prospect of sitting on the platform, pretending to be
  hospitable, amiable, amused, co-operative, while Bill genially ridiculed the
  things for which he had so urgently contended, Tubby pinched his eyes and
  lips tight shut&mdash;and shuddered.</p>

  <p>It had comforted him a little, this morning, to see the rain. The
  wheat-fields needed a good soaking in December. It practically guaranteed a
  fine harvest next season. The farmer legislature would look more favourably
  upon increased appropriations for the University. By early afternoon the day
  had become so unprecedentedly bad that Tubby's spirits rose. He was almost
  pleasant to Romney when time came for the lecture. No one but an irredeemable
  fool would slosh through this storm to attend an unrequired event in the
  Auditorium, Tubby was not only willing but almost eager to watch Bill
  Cunningham confront a dismaying battery of vacant seats.</p>

  <p>Always precise in his habits, Tubby knew to the second how long it took to
  walk to the rear entrance of the Auditorium. At three-fifty-two, Romney
  boosted him into his raincoat and handed him his umbrella. He marched forth
  with self-confidence. The anatomical laboratory was shelling out medics into
  the corridor. Tubby scowled as he watched them scurrying down the stairs;
  lazy devils; as pleased as little children over a chance to duck their work
  and go galloping home.</p>

  <p>The descending procession broke in two, permitting Tubby a generous open
  space, fore and aft, on the stairway. Outside, however, where the rain and
  darkness abolished caste-lines, the eminent neurologist found himself jostled
  by a milling pack of students, all en route to the Auditorium. He could
  hardly believe his eyes. He had a strong notion to return to his office. The
  storm would be a sufficient excuse. Or would it? Rejecting the temptation, he
  strode stiffly along, bucking the wind, elbowed by the crowd; proceeded to
  the stage-door of the Auditorium, glumly grunted to arriving colleagues,
  mounted the stairs, and came out upon the platform where the members of the
  faculty were lounging toward the seats to which their respective ratings
  entitled them. They deferentially cleared the way for him. Shane, who was to
  preside, beckoned to him. Four chairs were in the front row. Tubby's was at
  the end. The next was Shane's. Cunningham, on the other side, was talking to
  Osgood. Bill rose quickly, as Tubby approached, and they shook hands
  cordially. Then they sat down and Bill resumed his interrupted reply to some
  question of Osgood's.</p>

  <p>Shane leaned toward Tubby and smiled a little.</p>

  <p>"We've a capacity house," he said. "Very gratifying."</p>

  <p>Tubby pursed his mouth and nodded perfunctorily. It was indeed a capacity
  house. Biggest crowd he had ever seen at such an event. If a big crowd was
  any satisfaction, Bill ought to be much pleased. You could collect a big
  crowd by setting fire to a chicken-coop. If you wanted to estimate the
  population of the town, have a dog-fight.</p>

  <p>The spacious hall was packed to suffocation with half-drowned students,
  all seemingly in festive mood. There was a general buzz of conversation which
  Tubby didn't approve. Sounded like a high-school rally. Very undignified. By
  the Great Horn Spoon, they didn't take any such liberties in <i>his</i>
  lecture-arena, you could bet your bottom dollar! Tubby was disgusted. A sort
  of pungent steam exuded from the audience&mdash;a noxious blend of damp hair,
  fresh sweat, hot rubber, soaked leather, carbolic acid, iodoform, and
  nicotine.</p>

  <p>"Very stuffy in here, Shane," growled Tubby. "Better have some windows
  opened and let the stink out."</p>

  <p>Shane, pleased to find an occasion for obliging the chief at a moment of
  considerable stress, decided to act upon this suggestion. It might placate
  Tubby somewhat if he could feel that he was giving orders and getting prompt
  obedience. Rising, he walked to the reading-desk. The buzz died down as
  suddenly as if he had closed a door on it. The audience lifted its chin
  attentively.</p>

  <p>"It is very stuffy in here," said Shane, hoping Tubby would note the exact
  quotation. "Will the gentlemen near the windows do something about it?"</p>

  <p>Nobody stirred. Either there were no gentlemen present (Tubby's guess) or
  each waited on someone else to pry himself loose, or it was generally felt by
  those adjacent to the windows that it might rain in on them. At all events,
  nobody moved though almost everybody grinned. After delaying for a brief
  moment, Shane, apparently feeling that he had done his duty up to the point
  of making a fuss about a small matter, decided to proceed with the
  introduction of the speaker. The size of the crowd, he declared, indicated
  the nature of the welcome to which Dr Cunningham was so incontestably
  entitled. This was greeted with such spontaneous and prolonged applause that
  Shane thought he might as well let Bill go to it without any additional
  lily-gilding. He sat down, and Cunningham, bowing to Shane and the faculty,
  leaned an elbow on the reading-desk, and began:</p>

  <p>"It is indeed stuffy in here, gentlemen. And apparently you don't care.
  Neither do I. The place smells like a dog-kennel, but it reminds me of old
  times. I would give a great deal to be back in this atmosphere and repeat my
  student days."</p>

  <p>Then, for no very good reason, there was another round of applause.
  Cunningham liked 'em; liked even the smell of 'em. They knew his friendliness
  was honest. He was one of them. They would have fought for him against all
  comers.</p>

  <p>Tubby was disgusted but he was convinced. He pushed his chair about,
  presenting an impassive&mdash;though slightly flushed&mdash;profile to the
  audience. His eyes roved up and down the faculty. They were grinning like so
  many Cheshire cats. Beaven, too, he supposed. He made another survey of his
  colleagues, looking for Beaven. His eyes grew quizzical. Beaven wasn't
  there.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Beaven had forgotten all about the Cunningham lecture. He had gone to the
  private laboratory shortly after three, and since then time had stood still.
  He had made a startling discovery. He was not excited. Rather, the revelation
  had stunned and stilled him. He hadn't accommodated himself to the new idea
  yet.</p>

  <p>In his shirt-sleeves, with a green-visored white linen cap drawn snugly
  over his close-cropped blondish hair, Jack sat on a tall stool, his rangy
  legs crossed, his heel hooked on a rung, a cold pipe in his hand, dazedly
  staring at Celeste, who regarded him with reproachful eyes and an occasional
  shrug. She seemed apprehensive of danger, fearful of being touched; and at
  Jack's slightest movement she retreated a little, baring her teeth. A lay
  observer, ineptly opening the door upon this scene of a coatless young Viking
  in a workman's cap, solemnly exchanging stares with an unhappy monkey, would
  hardly have suspected that scientific history was in the making here.</p>

  <p>Every few minutes the bewildering fact would take a fresh grip on Beaven,
  as if it were shouting the news at him for the first time. Something inside
  him kept saying, "Well!&mdash;why do you sit there like a statue? Can't you
  see what you've got? Don't you realize what this means? What are you going to
  do about it? Why don't you run out and tell somebody?"</p>

  <p>Had it happened a couple of weeks ago he would have hurried to find Tubby.
  He couldn't do that now. Tubby would freeze up and declare he wasn't
  interested in any of Dr Beaven's projects at present. It would delight Tubby
  to have a chance to say just that, and add that he was very busy.</p>

  <p>After a while, Jack knocked out his pipe on the rim of the stool, and
  refilled it, Celeste watching him with resentment. The thing was incredible,
  but it had been demonstrated beyond doubt. It was not a mere coincidence. For
  the past eight days Jack had experienced frequent seizures of chagrin when he
  contemplated what manner of disgust the chief would exhibit if informed that
  the life of a valuable Macacus Rhesus was being jeopardized in the
  performance of an utterly idiotic experiment.</p>

  <p>Any green freshman medic&mdash;Tubby would have snorted&mdash;could tell
  you that if you did a spinal puncture on Jenny Collins, the wretched little
  alley-rat from up near the reservoir, and injected this fluid into the
  medulla of Celeste, the susceptible Brazilian monkey, the chances were about
  ten to one that your monkey would proceed through the usual phases of
  poliomyelitis. In the final phase there would probably be a localization of
  the strep. (Only Tubby wouldn't have said strep, but streptococcus; for he
  hated slang and shop abbreviations.) And then you would get a pronounced
  lesion, almost anywhere, probably in the nether extremities. But&mdash;Tubby
  would have said, scornfully&mdash;to waste a perfectly good monkey in an
  effort to discover whether the lesion would focalize in the musculature
  adjacent to the right elbow&mdash;simply because the Collins child's
  paralysis had settled there&mdash;was a distressing confession of imbecility.
  It would be interesting to have Tubby come in here now. It would be amusing
  to watch his face.</p>

  <p>For five days after the inoculation, Celeste had run high temperatures, as
  was to be anticipated. During that primary phase, she had been alternately
  restless and drowsy, irritable and sulky, refusing food and resentful of
  attentions. Then there had been a cessation of fever, an improvement in
  disposition, and a partial recovery of appetite. So far, so good. The case
  was normal and without special interest, as Jack had predicted. He was not
  concerned with the phenomena displayed through the first "hump" of the
  disease. Now that the eighth day had arrived, he was filled with curiosity to
  see what might happen. Another phase was imminent. There would probably but
  not inevitably be a paralysis. If so, it might localize anywhere.</p>

  <p>This morning, Abbott had been taken off his other duties to keep an eye on
  Celeste. It was the first time that Abbott had been asked to make notes on an
  experiment in pathology without knowing what he was looking for. Jack had had
  two good reasons for not telling him. In the first place he was half-ashamed
  to let Abbott know what the experiment was about; and, still more
  importantly, he did not want Abbott's judgment to be influenced by a hint
  that certain curious phenomena might show up. Had he said, "Keep your eye out
  for sensitiveness in the right front leg," Abbott might have imagined he saw
  something there. That was the chief trouble with experiments. You started
  forth with a theory and then observed only such facts as would bless the
  hypothesis. Nothing unique about that sophistry, however, as applied to
  laboratory research. Half the so-called wisdom of the world had been
  accumulated by such adventitious techniques. Rig up your conclusion first,
  and then catch and break a pair of premises to harness, mount the box, and
  away we go&mdash;with a new creed, a new diet, a new political science, a new
  theory of social uplift.</p>

  <p>Abbott had been told to stay in the laboratory from ten to three, leaving
  then to attend to his internship duties. He had done so, and had left his
  memoranda on the table beside Celeste's cage.</p>

  <p>Jack's eyes had widened as he read the entries. Item by item, they ran as
  follows:</p>

  <p>10 A.M.&mdash;She has been licking her right front leg; not nibbling at
  it, as to relieve of fleas, but as if tender and sore.</p>

  <p>11 A.M.&mdash;She is still much concerned about right front leg. Resists
  examination. Very petulant.</p>

  <p>NOON.&mdash;Endeavours to bear weight on right front leg but is
  unsuccessful. She is frightened now.</p>

  <p>1 P.M.&mdash;An infection seems to be focalizing in right front leg,
  probably affecting musculature served by ulnar nerve.</p>

  <p>2 P.M.&mdash;No marked change. Same manifestation as above. P.S. Not very
  nice day.</p>

  <p>3 P.M.&mdash;Infection appears to be definitely localized in the pronator
  teres. P.S. I go now.</p>

  <p>The hour-by-hour observations had been increasingly significant, but it
  was not until Jack arrived at the last entry that he realized the full import
  of Abbott's discriminating comments. The whole affair had now been boxed into
  a very restricted area. Little Jenny Collins would probably never recover the
  full functioning of her pronator teres; and, as for the Buckley child, her
  pronator teres was definitely out of commission, and right thankful she was,
  too, that it had lost its agonizing sensitivity.</p>

  <p>Of course it was impossible at this moment to make a wild guess about the
  practical value of this strange discovery. One thing was crystal clear,
  however: the strep in the city reservoir was of a special type. Hereafter it
  was going to be a mistake to refer to "a poliomyelitis streptococcus" as if
  there were just one breed, as in meningitis. The Mead boy and the Buckley and
  Collins girls, and now Celeste, had been attacked by a strep that showed an
  individual characteristic. Whether the information would be of any immediate
  use was a question that could be answered only by experiment; but, in the
  study of a problem so baffling as polio, <i>any</i> new facts might prove
  valuable.</p>

  <p>Jack wanted to tell somebody at once. He wished Lan Ying knew enough about
  pathology to understand the importance of this discovery. Perhaps he could
  write to her about it. She wouldn't say, "I told you so", but she would be
  verree glad that his humane interest in poor Buckley's problems had led to a
  strange revelation in the laboratory. It would not satisfy Lan Ying to be
  told that the discovery was accidental. Lan Ying didn't believe in accidents.
  Such revelations were handed to you by Somebody from Somewhere; part of a
  Plan, may-bee.</p>

  <p>Celeste whimpered and elevated her upper lip unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Too bad, old lady," muttered Jack, offering her a drink of water which
  she testily refused. "It hurts&mdash;but you're doing something fine for your
  human posterity, if that's any comfort to you."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>At half-past five, Jack decided to call it a day. Peeling off his shirt,
  he went to the capacious porcelain basin in the corner and began a thorough
  scrubbing up. Polio wasn't something to be trifled with, not even in its
  secondary hump; not even by pathologists.</p>

  <p>The telephone rang and he answered it.</p>

  <p>"Beaven? This is Cunningham."</p>

  <p>"Good!" said Jack, suddenly swept with embarrassment over his failure to
  attend the lecture. "Where are you?"</p>

  <p>"At the hospital. I've a message for you."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. I'll be right over. Ten minutes."</p>

  <p>Cunningham's voice lowered.</p>

  <p>"If you don't mind, I'll come up. It's rather a private message."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I'll wait. Find your way, all right?"</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>Jack began putting on his clothes. Private message, eh? Now what could
  Bill Cunningham want to tell him privately? Something about Lan Ying?
  Something about Tubby? He opened the door.</p>

  <p>Presently he heard footsteps in the anatomical laboratory. Cunningham's
  big frame filled the doorway. He was well dressed in grey tweeds and wore a
  companionable smile. They shook hands.</p>

  <p>"Missed you," said Cunningham, playfully reproachful. "Did Tubby give you
  some difficult pathology to do, so that pure science might be going forward
  while sentiment was raging?"</p>

  <p>"To tell the honest truth," replied Jack, contritely, "I forgot about it.
  And when you know why I forgot about it, you'll forgive me."</p>

  <p>Cunningham slapped Jack on the shoulder and told him to skip it. "What I
  came to tell you, Jack&mdash;Audrey Hilton's in town. Thought you like to
  know."</p>

  <p>Jack's face brightened.</p>

  <p>"How come?" he asked, mystified.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;Edith decided at the last minute that she wanted to come with
  me. Audrey happened to be at the house for luncheon. Edith said, 'Why don't
  you go along? You can be company for me while Bill is busy at the Medical
  College.' She was a bit reluctant, but Edith talked her into it."</p>

  <p>"That's&mdash;that's fine," stammered Jack. "Thanks."</p>

  <p>"You see&mdash;Audrey gets pretty lonesome up there, and Edith felt it
  would be good for her to have a change of air."</p>

  <p>"Quite right, sir. It was a happy thought."</p>

  <p>"What are you doing this evening, about dinner-time? Want to join us at
  the Livingstone?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Do</i> I?" Jack was radiant.</p>

  <p>"See you at seven, then." Cunningham put on his overcoat. "Shane's waiting
  to drive me down." He stooped and peered into Celeste's cage. "What you got
  there&mdash;besides a sick monkey?"</p>

  <p>"Polio. Let me tell you something. A strange thing has happened. We've had
  three polios from the same district. All developed a paralysis in the right
  arm. I have suspected contaminated water. I did a lumbar puncture on one of
  the cases and gave it to this monkey. Look at her!"</p>

  <p>Celeste was nursing her right elbow, and whimpering. Cunningham put his
  hat down on the table and looked for a long minute. Then he straightened,
  stared at Jack in a sort of daze, and said, under his breath, "You don't
  believe that, do you? It doesn't make sense!"</p>

  <p>"That isn't what ails it, Bill," declared Jack, unconscious of having
  called Cunningham "Bill" for the first time. "The baffling thing about it is
  that it <i>does</i> make sense! Look&mdash;let me show you. It will only take
  a minute. I want you to have a glimpse at these case-histories."</p>

  <p>They lined up at the tall desk, and Jack spread out three sheafs of
  papers.</p>

  <p>"Now we're not going to bother about anything up to the time of the actual
  localization of the paralysis in each of these cases. Here's the first
  one."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes passed: fifteen; twenty. Cunningham read on. The telephone
  rang. Shane said, "Is Dr Cunningham ready to go?"</p>

  <p>"I'll see, sir." Jack put his hand over the phone and said, "It's Dr
  Shane. Shall I tell him to wait?"</p>

  <p>"What?" asked Cunningham, from a long distance. Jack repeated the
  question.</p>

  <p>"Tell him to go on without me," mumbled the other, taking up the third
  sheaf of reports.</p>

  <p>"Better take off your coat," advised Jack. "It's hot in here. Celeste
  doesn't like draughts." He laid a hand on Cunningham's overcoat collar, and
  he let Jack tug if off his shoulders without lifting his eyes from the paper.
  At seven, the telephone rang again and the office said Mrs Cunningham was
  inquiring for her husband. Was he there? He answered the phone.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to be late, dear," he said. "I'm with Jack Beaven. We'll both be
  over there in a half-hour."</p>

  <p>"What has kept you so long?" Jack heard Edith say. "You must be very
  tired. Is anything the matter?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;nothing is the matter&mdash;but something very important has
  happened. Beaven has just come upon a new fact about polio that will put the
  literature on that subject into the museum."</p>

  <p>"What does Forrester think about this?" asked Cunningham, returning to the
  desk.</p>

  <p>"I haven't told him," admitted Jack, his eyes averted.</p>

  <p>"You haven't <i>told</i> him!"</p>

  <p>Jack shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Tubby refuses to have anything to do with me. Ignores my existence.
  Waiting for a good chance to have me fired."</p>

  <p>"What's the big row?"</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;Jack hesitated for a moment, reluctant to air the details of
  their quarrel&mdash;"It's nothing new. It has been cumulative. Lately it came
  to a head. Tubby pestered the worm until it bit him."</p>

  <p>Cunningham nodded and said he could understand that.</p>

  <p>"But," he expostulated suddenly, "you can't leave Tubby out of
  <i>this.</i> You've got to tell him! You'll break his heart."</p>

  <p>"Heart?" echoed Jack, bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Sure! Tubby has a heart. That's his trouble. He has been at war with his
  own insides for years. It all dates from the time he lost his girl; shocking
  case of malpractice by a doctor who knew everything but medicine and surgery.
  It did something to Tubby. He went crazy on the subject of incompetency in
  the profession. It's his life mission now to train men to be scientists.
  That's why he's such a slave-driver. But&mdash;Tubby is really a soft-hearted
  fellow, when you get to know him."</p>

  <p>"How long does that take?" inquired Jack, dryly. "I've hardly been out of
  his sight for nine years.... No, sir; I'm not going to invite another
  insult from Tubby Forrester. He said he had no further interest in me or my
  work. So be it. And if he has to learn about this polio experiment when he
  reads it in the medical journals, he won't have anybody to blame but
  himself."</p>

  <p>Cunningham laid a hand on Jack's shoulder and looked him squarely in the
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't do that to Tubby if I were you. All he lives for is his
  professional pride; his reputation as a scientist. Don't make him look like a
  monkey. It would kill him."</p>

  <p>"He needs a few killings, damn him!"</p>

  <p>They were at the laboratory door now, Jack impatiently rattling his keys,
  eager to have done with the unpleasant discussion.</p>

  <p>"Your animosity goes pretty deep, my boy," warned Cunningham. "Better get
  rid of it before it becomes malignant."</p>

  <p>"How do you mean&mdash;'malignant'?" growled Jack.</p>

  <p>"A grudge is like a parasitical growth. Passes through much the same
  phases. In its primary stage it is usually benign. Operation is simple, safe,
  effective. But if you let it eat into you deep enough, it becomes
  inoperable."</p>

  <p>"Rather a fantastic metaphor," muttered Jack, dryly.</p>

  <p>"It's not a metaphor! It's a sound scientific fact! An incurable hatred is
  a malignant disease. I'd as lief have an inoperable cancer!"</p>

  <p>"Shall we go?" snapped Jack, restlessly.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but just one more thing, and then I'm ready to drop the
  subject. You know, maybe better than I, the part that the endocrine glands
  play in all our mental states and our consequent behaviour. Sudden
  apprehension of danger throws into the blood-stream a secretion that serves
  as a stimulant and an astringent, very useful in the event of a fight or a
  flight. But if this sense of fear and anger is prolonged, this constant
  glandular secretion changes a man's character; makes him furtive, stealthy,
  suspicious, anti-social. You believe that, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," agreed Jack. "That's a fact. And then&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>"It is also a fact, as you very well know, that hot indignation releases
  into the blood-stream secretions of a similar nature; varies only in that it
  contains less stimulant and more astringent; tightens a man's fibres for the
  defence of his rights, his self-respect. But&mdash;if that indignation
  settles into a permanent grudge, you get much the same effect produced by
  prolonged fear."</p>

  <p>"Nothing personal, I hope," said Jack, ironically.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not yet," said Cunningham, soberly, "but&mdash;I thought I'd
  remind you that this is a fact." His voice dropped to a tone of kindly
  entreaty. "Don't be miffed, Jack. I'm much interested in your welfare. You
  believe that, too, don't you?"</p>

  <p>After a thoughtful moment, Jack's moody face cleared.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Bill," he said, warmly. "I know that. And&mdash;thanks for the tip.
  Sorry I was slow to take it.... Come on. Let's go."</p>

  <p>They hurried down to the dark and muddy parking-lot and climbed into
  Jack's roadster. By the time they had reached the Livingstone garage they
  were in lively spirits, Jack full of suppressed excitement over the prospect
  of seeing Lan Ying; Cunningham rejoicing in the memory of his reception at
  the Medical College and anxious to share it with Edith.</p>

  <p>Their dinner companions were waiting for them in the lounge.</p>

  <p>"It's about time!" said Edith, maternally, giving them each a hand.</p>

  <p>"My fault," admitted Jack, breezily, as he pressed toward Audrey. "So glad
  you're here, darling," he said, grasping her extended hands. "You're very
  beautiful."</p>

  <p>"They wanted me to come," she explained, softly. "I hope I shall not be a
  bother. I know how busy you are, Jack."</p>

  <p>Edith and Bill joined them, arm in arm.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever see anything lovelier, Jack," challenged Edith, "than our
  Audrey&mdash;in that coral gown?"</p>

  <p>"Gorgeous!" exclaimed Jack; then, remembering his manners, he added, "And
  I think your black velvet is stunning!"</p>

  <p>"Rather!" boomed Cunningham, loyally.</p>

  <p>Edith negligently flicked protesting fingers.</p>

  <p>"A woman who can't wear black velvet," she drawled, "can't wear
  <i>anything....</i> Come, Audrey, let's feed the animals while they're
  still in a good humour."</p>

  <p>She and Bill led the way into the dining-room. The head-waiter, preceding
  them, had drawn back two chairs for the ladies. Edith archly ignored hers and
  moved to the next one.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to sit away across the table from Bill," she explained,
  when they were seated. "I haven't seen him for such a long time&mdash;and we
  might want to hold hands." She gave Jack an impishly meaningful wink. Her
  husband, noting this by-play, remarked, out of the corner of his mouth, "Next
  time, I'll leave you at home."</p>

  <p>Unwilling to be teased, Audrey laid her small hand, palm up, beside
  Jack's. Promptly meeting her mood, he wrapped his strong fingers around it
  and smiled into her eyes, Edith and Bill following the little pantomime with
  silent amusement.</p>

  <p>"Very nicely done," approved Cunningham. "It's your round."</p>

  <p>"Pish!" said Edith. "It's no fun to hold hands&mdash;on top of the
  table."</p>

  <p>Apparently, they weren't going to be embarrassed by any reluctance to see
  the little game through. Edith said "Bravo!" when Jack, undaunted, tugged
  Audrey's hand out of sight. The next instant, her smile had an expression of
  bewilderment as she noted the sudden change in Audrey's face. Audrey wasn't
  playing now. Her mobile lips had rounded into an inarticulate "Oh!" Then she
  slowly turned her eyes to Jack and gave him a misty, tender little smile. His
  face was very sober, his eyes full of entreaty. Bill and Edith were holding
  their breaths. Jack and Audrey seemed not to realize that they were being
  observed. They were alone together.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" whispered Jack.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" whispered Audrey.</p>

  <p>Jack drew a long, happy sigh.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;for the love of&mdash;What's going on over there?" exploded
  Cunningham.</p>

  <p>Audrey, her face illumined, pressed the back of her fingers against her
  lips; then extended her hand for inspection.</p>

  <p>"How wonderful!" murmured Edith. "Bill&mdash;they're engaged! Look! And
  you never told us!"</p>

  <p>"When did <i>this</i> happen?" asked Cunningham, lifting Audrey's hand to
  the light.</p>

  <p>Audrey glanced at Jack, and they both laughed a little, rather
  nervously.</p>

  <p>"Just now," said Jack, proudly.</p>

  <p>"Jack does funnee things," said Audrey. "Is it not so?"</p>

  <p>"<i>I'll</i> say he does funnee things!" said Edith.</p>

  <p>Cunningham pointed a finger across the table.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say," he demanded, "that you had the nerve to buy an
  engagement ring and put it on a girl's hand in a public
  dining-room&mdash;without knowing whether she would accept it?"</p>

  <p>"It was not quite that bad," murmured Audrey.</p>

  <p>"Bless you!" said Jack.</p>

  <p>Cunningham quietly muttered that he'd be damned, pinched his glasses on
  his nose and picked up the menu-card, the waiter at his elbow having sighed
  audibly.</p>

  <p>"And so will I," agreed Edith. "My William and I will both be
  damned&mdash;and seeing we have to eat, in the face of this&mdash;this
  cataclysm&mdash;I'm having the cream of mushroom soup." She turned to Jack.
  "It won't make any difference what <i>you</i> take, my child. It will taste
  like ambrosia, I expect."</p>

  <p>The dinner had eventually been ordered and, with a good many
  interruptions, eaten. Dr Cunningham had relieved the emotional stress by
  drawing, with his wife's help, an hilarious picture of how <i>he</i> became
  engaged. How, having once refused him sternly, Edith had taken him to walk in
  the park on a Christmas Eve, had lured him to a secluded but snowy bench, and
  had proposed to <i>him,</i> had kissed him soundly ("What a pity there are so
  many people in this dining-room!"), and had announced the engagement to her
  family before he had recovered consciousness!</p>

  <p>That story, interesting though it was to the Cunninghams, was completely
  lost on Audrey and Jack. Those two young persons were dwelling in a rosy
  world of their own, which generated its own light and needed no illumination
  from any other star.</p>

  <p>"Edith," said Doctor Cunningham, with a wink at his wife, "do you notice
  that all the waiters walk on their hands?"</p>

  <p>(Darling Audrey, why did we waste so much precious time?)</p>

  <p>"Yes, Bill, and the roof is falling in, too."</p>

  <p>(Oh, Jack! I love you!)</p>

  <p>"The earthquake is getting bigger, Bill."</p>

  <p>(The ring fits, doesn't it, darling?)</p>

  <p>"Doctor Cunningham, you and I are the most superfluous people on
  earth!"</p>

  <p>(Yes, it is exactlee right, everything is exactlee right.)</p>

  <p>"Never mind, Mrs Cunningham! We have each other!"</p>

  <p>(Beloved! Beloved!)</p>

  <p>When the dessert had been disposed of, and the coffee poured, Cunningham
  thought it safe&mdash;and perhaps advisable&mdash;to bring the lovers back to
  earth. Pocketing his glasses, he said, "This has been a very eventful day for
  Dr John Wesley Beaven. He's engaged to be married, and he has made a
  spectacular discovery. I think you girls should hear about this polio
  experiment."</p>

  <p>He launched upon the story, feeding it to them in lay language, so far as
  possible; occasionally pausing to explain some difficult phase of the
  pathological procedure. When he was done with it, Audrey turned to Jack.</p>

  <p>"And how did you discover that it was due to the bad water?" she
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"That's a long story," he replied, reluctant to get into it.</p>

  <p>"Please," begged Edith.</p>

  <p>So&mdash;he told them about Thomas Buckley's confession; reviewed the
  circumstances of the rather dramatic interview that had produced Buckley's
  tale of the stolen plumbing; brought the story down to date&mdash;and added,
  "Now you know as much as I do."</p>

  <p>"What do you intend to do about it, Jack?" asked Edith, apprehensively.
  "You're dealing with some mighty tough characters. Better be careful."</p>

  <p>"Of course," agreed Jack; "careful, up to the point where prudence might
  interfere with the proper treatment of these cases. There's a boy up there
  who should be in the hospital."</p>

  <p>"That's the City Health Department's job, isn't it?" inquired Bill.</p>

  <p>"Ordinarily&mdash;yes," assented Jack. "And if I can't get the Mead child
  under proper treatment, I may have to call in the authorities. The Meads, I
  understand, are peculiar. I should like to save Buckley from the penitentiary
  if possible; not a very attractive fellow, but he has been badly used."</p>

  <p>"If the Health Officer comes into the picture, will you have to tell him
  about the irregular plumbing?" asked Edith.</p>

  <p>"He'll find it out," put in Bill, "if he presses the proper
  investigation."</p>

  <p>"Then these hoodlums will think you reported on them," said Edith. "Isn't
  that a rather dangerous risk?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;we can't be thinking too much about that," said Jack. "If we
  can get along without exposing the plumbing scandal, all well and good. If we
  can't, it will have to come out."</p>

  <p>"We don't want to see Jack hurt," said Edith. "Do we, Audrey?"</p>

  <p>Jack found himself curious to hear her reply, for she had taken almost no
  part in the conversation. He was surprised to see her face alight with
  pleasure.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;we do not want to see him hurt," said Audrey, after a little
  delay, "but&mdash;we are verree proud: is it not so?"</p>

  <p>Jack felt a glow of mingled satisfaction and embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"I hope," he said, casually, "that I can get through this affair without
  having to be a hero."</p>

  <p>They had finished their coffee and were about to retire from the
  dining-room when a party of a dozen or more men filed in and gathered about a
  table obviously reserved for them.</p>

  <p>"The Regents," said Jack, in a whisper. "To-day is their monthly
  meeting."</p>

  <p>"I see Tubby's with them," observed Bill.</p>

  <p>"And he has recognized us," said Edith. "He gave us a good looking-over
  when he came in, and appeared to be unhappy about us. I think he might have
  come over to say 'How do you do?' to me&mdash;the ole meanie."</p>

  <p>"That's because I'm with you," explained Jack.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>At the hour of Dr Cunningham's clinic, next day, Jack was endeavouring to
  reason with the Meads. If he could get the boy Donald back into the hospital,
  or even under proper medical attention at home, perhaps there would be no
  necessity for stirring up the City Health Officer to an active interest in
  the matter which had become so annoyingly involved.</p>

  <p>He found the Meads obdurate. They belonged to a small sect that enjoined
  them against any resort to medical aid. It was true that they had given their
  grudging consent to Donald's hospitalization a few weeks ago, under heavy
  pressure by the neighbourhood, but remorsefully maintained now that the
  little boy's lame arm was doubtless a divine chastisement for this temporary
  breakdown of faith. Everything that happened, deposed the fanatical Mrs Mead,
  was the will of God, including infantile paralysis&mdash;"if that's what this
  is." Donald was sick because they had in some way offended God. Mr Mead added
  that he and his wife were in daily supplication that God's face might again
  shine upon them, so that Donald's lame and useless arm would be made whole.
  They further remarked that Dr Beaven himself would be well advised to seek
  the Lord while it was yet day, though they weren't very optimistic about the
  success of this recommended quest, for it was quite possible that Dr Beaven
  had sinned away his day of grace.</p>

  <p>Reluctant&mdash;for a couple of excellent reasons&mdash;to push the
  plumbing affair out into the open daylight unless forced to do so, Jack
  patiently explained that what Donald's arm needed, at this stage of his
  trouble, was complete rest, nourishing food, and the sort of nursing to be
  had only in a hospital. It wouldn't cost them a cent. That's what the
  hospital is for, he said. And this business of urging the boy to exercise the
  damaged arm in the hope of restoring its strength was the worst thing that
  could happen to him.</p>

  <p>At one stage of the interview, Jack felt that his argument was making an
  impression. The Meads glumly listened. Jack warmed to his task. When he came
  to the first full stop, hopeful of having won their consent, Mrs Mead quietly
  but firmly declared that Donald's case was none of Dr Beaven's business; that
  they hadn't asked for his advice; that he had better return now to his
  ungodly interference with God's will and leave His true believers in
  peace.</p>

  <p>Jack then rose to go, remarking: "Your attitude leaves me no alternative
  but to inform the Health Officer, Dr Yarnell. It will be his responsibility,
  after that. If you can talk him into permitting Donald to remain here at
  home, I shall wash my hands of the whole affair. If he insists on better care
  for Donald, you will be expected to obey his orders."</p>

  <p>"We are taking our orders from God," said Mr Mead, fervently.</p>

  <p>"I think Dr Yarnell will have something to say about that," replied Jack,
  trying to suppress his exasperation.</p>

  <p>Returning to the hospital shortly after five, he put through a call to Dr
  Yarnell, briefly reporting the situation at the Mead home, but omitting any
  reference to the bad water or the pirated plumbing. The main thing was to get
  Donald under treatment. Buckley had promised to shut off the water. The
  neighbourhood would return to the use of the well.</p>

  <p>Young Yarnell, eager to exhibit his efficiency and give a good account of
  himself to a Medical College faculty member, lost no time in performing his
  errand; hustled Donald Mead to the hospital; bustled about through the
  neighbourhood; breezed back to his office in the City Hall; encountered a
  couple of reporters. The story broke too late to catch the evening papers,
  but it made the eight o'clock news broadcast. There had been several cases of
  infantile paralysis in a shabby little district near the reservoir; cause
  unknown. The City Health Department was making a thorough investigation to
  determine the origin of the epidemic.</p>

  <p>Of all this, however, Jack was unaware. Having made his report to Yarnell
  he considered his duty done for the present. Indeed, the whole matter had
  been dropped from his mind, temporarily. He was entertaining Lan Ying and the
  Cunninghams in his apartment that night. A caterer had been secured who had
  promised to attend to everything.</p>

  <p>Arriving home at six-thirty, Jack had been pleased to see that
  preparations for dinner were progressing in capable hands. He went about
  through the apartment making sure his house was in order. Lan Ying would
  unquestionably be viewing his quarters to-night with a new interest. Perhaps
  he might read in her eyes a wish that certain changes could be made. Maybe
  she would be reluctant to alter anything. It might be good sense to dispose
  of all this household tackle with one ruthless swoop and let Lan Ying start
  at scratch in the fascinating task of equipping a home. Well&mdash;they could
  begin their life together here, and plan for the future. The guests arrived
  at seven and were shown to his bedroom to dispose of their coats. Jack and
  Bill returned to the living-room where Edith immediately joined them.</p>

  <p>"Audrey," she remarked, casually, "is having trouble getting her galoshes
  off. It's a man's job, really."</p>

  <p>"Of course," agreed Jack. "I shall go to the rescue."</p>

  <p>When he had disappeared, Cunningham cupped his hand under his wife's chin,
  and looked her in the eyes with a pretence of severity.</p>

  <p>"You are a sweet little liar," he rumbled. "Audrey didn't wear
  galoshes."</p>

  <p>"She should have," said Edith. "I told her to."</p>

  <p>"I should be interested in knowing what sort of yarn you invented to
  detain her."</p>

  <p>Edith was sauntering across to the bookcases, Bill trailing along after
  her.</p>

  <p>"It's really none of your business, Dr Cunningham," she answered,
  negligently, "but, remembering what happened to the curiosity-cursed cat,
  I'll tell you: I said that Jack wanted to see her for a moment alone."</p>

  <p>Cunningham nodded and said he supposed that statement wasn't so far from
  the truth. After a few moments, he glanced at his watch and remarked, "Think
  they'll be back, or should we tell the help to serve dinner?"</p>

  <p>Presently they drifted in, both talking at once and putting on a fairly
  good show of self-possession.</p>

  <p>"Do sit down, won't you?" said Jack, with exaggerated heartiness. "I've
  been telling Audrey to make herself at home&mdash;as we used to say when I
  was a boy."</p>

  <p>After the manner of a lint-picking mother, Edith solicitously tugged out
  the handkerchief that peeked from his breast pocket, and flicked at a little
  round patch of white powder on his coat, murmuring sweetly, "And how she
  did!"</p>

  <p>"Edith," said Edith's husband, sternly, "you are unbearable."</p>

  <p>Dinner was announced then, and they proceeded to the little dining-room.
  Audrey noticed that at the place assigned to her there was a small glass
  bell. The Cunninghams observed it too and smiled.</p>

  <p>"If I am the hostess, Jack," said Audrey, "may I ask Dr Cunningham to say
  the blessing?"</p>

  <p>"Please," said Jack, bowing his head. It would be interesting to hear
  Bill's Latin grace again.</p>

  <p>Cunningham hesitated for an instant and then said, impressively, "God
  bless this new home. Amen."</p>

  <p>No one said anything for a little while. Then Edith remarked soberly,
  "Some day soon, you two will get a licence and have a legalized wedding
  ceremony, but I have a feeling that Bill has just now married you."</p>

  <p>"You are both verree good to us," murmured Audrey.</p>

  <p>At nine&mdash;the four of them were in the living-room&mdash;the telephone
  rang and Jack heard the terrified voice of Thomas Buckley.</p>

  <p>"It's out!" piped Buckley.</p>

  <p>"What's out?" asked Jack.</p>

  <p>"This young smart aleck Yarnell got it out of Collins. And then he talked
  to old man Bowers. But neither of them knew the pipe had been stolen&mdash;so
  that part of it wasn't spilled. Then he asked my wife what she knew about it
  and she told as how I had helped with the plumbing job. Told about Billows,
  too. It was on the air an hour ago. Billows won't waste much time in making a
  get-away, but he's a very mean fellow. He'll find time to pay somebody off
  for squealing. What shall I do?"</p>

  <p>"Do nothing&mdash;for the present," advised Jack. "Don't think of running
  away. That would amount to a confession of guilt, and you're in enough
  trouble without announcing that you're afraid to answer questions. To-morrow,
  you and I will see Dr Yarnell, and I shall tell him you confided the whole
  story to me."</p>

  <p>"That sort of leaves you out on a limb, don't it, Doc?" Buckley's tone was
  solicitous.</p>

  <p>"A bit awkward, yes; but I'm not going to let you down. Come to the
  laboratory, early to-morrow morning, and we will talk it over."</p>

  <p>For a moment after he had hung up, Jack remained at his desk, debating the
  course he should take. Perhaps Cunningham could provide some good counsel. He
  returned to his seat beside Audrey on the davenport. The three of them
  couldn't help knowing there had been news of a disturbing nature.</p>

  <p>"Well, everybody in the world has heard the story about the irregular
  plumbing," said Jack, "so we don't have to worry any more whether to report
  it or not. It was in the news broadcast to-night. Dr Yarnell nosed it out,
  suspects that the contaminated water may have caused the polio, but doesn't
  know that the pipe was stolen. Buckley is in a dither for fear his crooked
  friend Billows&mdash;who lives in Detroit&mdash;may leap to the conclusion
  that the whole story has been told. He thinks Billows, who is a hot-headed,
  reckless bad man, may come popping over here before the law gets after him,
  and settle his account with his former neighbour. I have told Buckley that I
  would meet him in the morning and make an effort to square him with the
  Health Department."</p>

  <p>"But that doesn't square him with this Detroit hoodlum," said Cunningham.
  "If anything, this Billows fellow, when he learns that Buckley has turned
  state's evidence&mdash;or what amounts to that&mdash;may have an additional
  reason for avenging himself."</p>

  <p>"Was your name mentioned in the broadcast?" asked Edith.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Probably not."</p>

  <p>"I hope you manage to keep out of this mess, Jack," she said
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"But he'll have to stand by this poor devil Buckley," said Cunningham.
  "Buckley's the man who made it possible for Jack to do his polio
  experiment."</p>

  <p>"I think that too," said Audrey, softly.</p>

  <p>Jack slipped his hand along the cushion to hers. Audrey loved serenity,
  but she was no coward. His love for her deepened. A woman of such fibre, he
  felt, would bring out all the strength that a man possessed.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Buckley did not appear the next morning, and when four o'clock had come
  without tidings of any sort, Jack decided to drive up and see how the land
  lay.</p>

  <p>Mrs Buckley was alone and apprehensive that something had happened to
  Thomas. He had arrived home about ten-thirty, last night, after she had gone
  to bed. She had been drowsily conscious that he had sat for a long time
  reading a newspaper. About two, she had roused; and, noting that Thomas had
  not yet retired, went out into the little living-room to investigate. And
  Thomas was not there.</p>

  <p>"No," she replied, when Jack wondered whether Thomas ever prowled about in
  the night, "there was no place for him to go at that hour. Of course, he was
  worried. He might have gone out to take a walk; but it was raining. I'm
  scared about him, Doctor. I'm afraid he has come to some harm."</p>

  <p>"If Thomas had any reason for wanting to run away," said Jack, "where
  would he be likely to go?"</p>

  <p>Mrs Buckley pursed her thin lips cautiously.</p>

  <p>"He had no cause to runaway," she replied. "Not as I know of."</p>

  <p>Jack believed her. She wasn't quite bright enough to deceive anybody.
  Thomas had not told her about the stolen pipe or the Billows menace; probably
  had realized that the secret wasn't safe with her.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I'd better notify the police," she added, confirming Jack's belief
  that she knew nothing of Thomas's culpability.</p>

  <p>"I should wait a little, if I were you," he advised. "Thomas may show up
  at any time. If he does, please let me know. I suppose you have inquired in
  the neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I guess everybody was to bed early, except over at the Collinses',
  and they hadn't heard anything out of the ordinary. Mrs Collins was quite
  sick last night."</p>

  <p>"Anything serious?" asked Jack.</p>

  <p>"Mebby. She's very miserable. Sick to her stomach to-day; something
  awful!&mdash;what time she isn't just a-layin' there, asleep with her eyes
  open; lots o' fever. But they haven't had a doctor. Guess they're scared of
  doctors since this City Health fellow was up."</p>

  <p>Jack decided to have a look. Collins peered suspiciously through a crack
  of the door, but opened it hospitably enough when he recognized Jenny's
  physician. Doc was invited to see what ailed the missus. He went to the
  bedside and stood for some minutes making a general survey of the wretched
  woman's appearance. He felt quite sure, without further examination, that he
  knew what this was. There was a special characteristic, as difficult to
  describe as a flavour or a scent or a tint, but instantly recognizable by the
  experienced diagnostician as an acute polio. Perhaps it was mostly in the
  eyes. Any other cause of fever usually brightened the whites of the eyes to a
  sort of shiny porcelain. Polio puffed the lids, and the eyes sent out darting
  little flashes of fear and resentment.</p>

  <p>"What 'pears to be ailing her, Doc?" asked Collins, anxiously.</p>

  <p>Jack led the way out of the room.</p>

  <p>"She has infantile paralysis," he said, firmly. "May I send the ambulance
  up here for her?"</p>

  <p>"Gosh, Doc, that's terrible," whimpered Collins. "Is she a-goin' to be
  paralysed?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. We'll do what we can&mdash;and then we must wait and see. I
  shall have a place ready for her. After you get her off in the ambulance, you
  go to a drug-store and get this prescription filled. It's for <i>you.</i>
  Zinc sulphate. I want you to swab out your mouth with it and gargle. Better
  get another order of it for Mrs Buckley. I understand she has been in
  here."</p>

  <p>"Gosh, Doc. I haven't a cent," admitted Collins.</p>

  <p>Jack handed him ten dollars.</p>

  <p>"Spend the rest of that for groceries," he said, "and divide with Mrs
  Buckley. She is on short rations too. Buckley is not at home. Perhaps you
  knew that."</p>

  <p>Collins nodded an unkempt head.</p>

  <p>"But you don't know where he is," pressed Jack, pursuing Collins's evasive
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Nope," declared Collins, "not a thing. I don't keep track o'
  Buckley."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>However sorry he was for the ailing Mrs Collins, Jack was ablaze with zeal
  to make an experiment. Perhaps it was only a hundred-to-one shot that a serum
  placed immediately in the field likely to be affected would build up an
  immunity against this identically localized paralysis, but it was well worth
  trying. He would get the virus from Celeste and make a serum for injection
  into Mrs Collins's arm while her infection was still incipient.</p>

  <p>It was quarter after five, and there had been an understanding that he was
  to join the Cunninghams and Lan Ying at the Livingstone for dinner, but if
  the antitoxin experiment was to be made at all it would have to be made at
  once&mdash;dinner or no dinner. As he drove past Lister Hall, en route to the
  parking-lot at the rear, he saw Cunningham surrounded by a group of medics.
  Apparently the afternoon clinic had just ended. He brought the car to a halt.
  Cunningham detached himself from the little knot of students, and said, "Are
  you ready to go down town with me, or coming later?"</p>

  <p>"I can't go with you to dinner to-night," said Jack. "Got to stay on the
  job." Briefly he explained what he meant to do. Its urgency was obvious.</p>

  <p>"I should like to be in on this myself, if you don't mind," said the
  other. "We'll phone to Edith that we're not coming, and they can have their
  dinner without delay."</p>

  <p>"Glad to have you stay," said Jack. "I'll park the car. Here are the keys
  to the lab. You can use my telephone. I shall be with you in a few
  minutes."</p>

  <p>Cunningham had been slowed up by his student admirers, and he and Jack met
  on the stairway. They entered the laboratory. Jack turned on the lights and
  crossed to the clothes-locker, while Cunningham telephoned to the hotel. The
  clerk was saying that the ladies were not in. They had left a message saying
  they had gone over to Detroit on a shopping expedition and might be a little
  late for dinner.</p>

  <p>"You tell them," said Cunningham, "that Dr Beaven and I have been detained
  at the hospital and may not be through before nine or ten. They should
  proceed to their dinner without us."</p>

  <p>"Better take off your coat, Bill," advised Jack, "and make yourself
  comfortable. I have to keep it pretty hot in here for Celeste."</p>

  <p>Cunningham paused at the cage and peered in.</p>

  <p>"I say, Jack," he called, "come here!"</p>

  <p>They looked into the cage together.</p>

  <p>"Asleep," said Jack.</p>

  <p>"Asleep&mdash;nothing!" muttered Cunningham. "That monkey's dead!"</p>

  <p>It was a fact. The monkey was dead, at a moment when she was about to come
  into her own as a valuable social-service worker.</p>

  <p>Jack could think of no words to express his bereavement over the loss of
  Celeste than the hopeless ejaculation, "Oh, hell!"</p>

  <p>He was putting on his coat. They would go to dinner now. With one sleeve
  dangling, he paused, glassy-eyed.</p>

  <p>"Look!" he exclaimed. "I'm going to get some fluid from the Collins child,
  and make a serum for her mother."</p>

  <p>"Good!" approved Cunningham. "That's still better."</p>

  <p>"Come on," said Jack. "We'll do it now."</p>

  <p>In a few minutes they were standing at the door of the private room where
  little Jenny was still isolated. The time had passed for the communicability
  of her trouble, but she was very nervous and easily upset; not ready for the
  confusion of an open ward. The nurse came out into the hall.</p>

  <p>"Slattery, this is Dr Cunningham."</p>

  <p>It was no mere formality when the Slattery girl told Dr Cunningham she was
  glad to meet him. The whole hospital was agog with strange stories about the
  Cunningham clinics. General rumour had it that the man exercised a peculiar
  magic in dealing with difficult patients. McFey had been in, an hour ago,
  reporting an occurrence of the day before. The doctors were mostly in full
  sympathy with the Cunningham tactics, but they were good-naturedly giving the
  old boy some difficult nuts to crack.</p>

  <p>McFey's life had been made unpleasant, for a week or more, by the constant
  complaints of one Pfeiffer&mdash;who was at that stage of a compound fracture
  of the ankle where the patient wanted to get inside the cast and scratch. He
  was a testy chap to begin with, and every day added to his surliness. McFey
  had thought it would be fun to see Dr Cunningham and Pfeiffer together, and
  had suggested to Dr Osgood that a call would be appreciated.</p>

  <p>According to McFey's account of it, for Slattery's benefit, Dr Cunningham
  had come in and without giving Pfeiffer a chance to harangue him about his
  discomforts, had said, confidentially, "You're the fellow with the compound
  fracture of the ankle, aren't you? I want you to do me a favour. We have a
  chap down at the end of the hall who needs a bit of bucking-up; thinks he's
  ruined for life; ought to have a chance to look at some good sport who's been
  through a lot. Miss Slattery, let's put Mr Pfeiffer in the wheel-chair and
  I'll take him down for a little chat with this man Tatlock." Pfeiffer had
  stammered that he wouldn't be any good at that sort of thing, but Dr
  Cunningham had breezily overruled him. The grim joke of the thing was that
  Tatlock's leg had been broken in three places; they had it trussed up in a
  complicated contraption that rivalled the Inquisition machinery. Dr
  Cunningham slowly trundled Pfeiffer down the hall and into Tatlock's room.
  "Hello," muttered Tatlock, through clenched teeth. "What's <i>your</i>
  trouble?" Pfeiffer had swallowed, a couple of times, dryly. Then he grinned
  foolishly and said, "Nothin', pard. Just&mdash;got bumped a little.
  Just&mdash;just pushed in to say Hello. Must go now. So long." Then McFey had
  wheeled Pfeiffer back to his room. He had had nothing to say on the way. She
  asked him whether the trip had tired him and he shook his head. "Did you buck
  up Mr Tatlock?" asked McFey. <i>"Boy!"</i> he muttered, with a shudder. "I
  expect he's not very comfortable in that cradle," said McFey. <i>"Boy!"</i>
  exploded Pfeiffer, wincing and shaking his head as if he had taken some
  shockingly nasty medicine.</p>

  <p>Equally entertaining had been McFey's report to Slattery concerning the
  Bretton girl's experience. Bretton had been having a rough time with Tatlock.
  The poor devil couldn't be blamed, of course, for being sullen and rude and
  unco-operative; had made up his mind he was going to be a hopeless cripple.
  Bretton had doubted the wisdom of bringing Pfeiffer in. It probably wouldn't
  do Tatlock much good to see someone who was well on the way to recovery. And
  she still doubted whether it was the thing to have done, after the brief
  interview was over. But presently the light dawned for Bretton. Dr Cunningham
  had tarried. "I hope you don't mind my bringing Mr Pfeiffer in," he said.
  "You see, his trouble isn't all in his ankle. He had let the thing get on his
  nerves. His patience is all used up. I thought it might be good for him to
  have a glimpse of somebody who is badly hurt, but keeps his misfortune
  confined to his leg." Tatlock pulled a rather doubtful grin, but Dr
  Cunningham wouldn't let it be a joke. He took up the chart, ran his eye over
  it, nodded with satisfaction. "I must go, now, Bob. Thanks for accommodating
  me. Maybe I can do something for you sometime." Tatlock's eyes brightened.
  "You're welcome, Doc," he said, companionably. "Come in again, any time."</p>

  <p>Slattery was glad to meet Dr Cunningham. It was the truth: he was the sort
  of person who instantly inspired confidence. If you were in the doldrums, you
  would probably believe any splendid lie he told you about your courage.</p>

  <p>"You're wanting to see Jenny Collins?" she asked, turning to Beaven.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Want some blood. Want to make a culture. It's for the child's
  mother."</p>

  <p>Slattery's face registered anxiety, and she ventured an apprehensive
  "Tsch, tsch".</p>

  <p>"She'll go positively into hysterics," she declared. "The little thing
  hasn't had the least mite of discipline, and she really has taken an awful
  beating since she's here; blood tests, spinals, and everything. Whatever you
  say, Dr Beaven&mdash;but you're in for a big fight, I can tell you, if you
  try to do this while she's conscious."</p>

  <p>Jack suddenly turned his eyes toward Cunningham with a significant
  grin.</p>

  <p>"I think you said you would like to be in on this experiment, Dr
  Cunningham. How about you getting a nice little specimen of Miss Collins's
  blood? We'll say that's your share of the job."</p>

  <p>"If I'm to do it, I should like to know a little more about the case. This
  child has a paralysed arm, and you've another case or two much like it.
  Neighbours, I understand. There's another girl, isn't there?"</p>

  <p>Slattery mentioned the Buckley child.</p>

  <p>"What is her first name, the Buckley?"</p>

  <p>"Martha."</p>

  <p>"Very well. You sterilize the syringe, wrap it in a towel, and lay it on
  the table beside the bed. I'll follow along presently."</p>

  <p>"You will not need me," said Jack. "I'll go and see how Mrs Collins is
  making it."</p>

  <p>"Tell the girl on the desk here to find me a fresh pillow," said
  Cunningham. "Slattery's busy."</p>

  <p>"Pillow?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; to carry in with me. They're never alarmed if you arrive with a
  pillow under your arm or a red apple in your hand. It always starts a
  diverting conversation. Did you ever notice that, Jack? Anything that disarms
  them, especially if you're a stranger. I've sometimes had pretty good luck in
  distracting a patient by seeming very much preoccupied with my own affairs
  rather than showing any concern for his."</p>

  <p>"Such as&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, I have occasionally stopped, just inside the door, when I knew the
  patient had noted my arrival, and have gone down deep in my trousers pocket
  and brought up a large handful of small change which I have proceeded to
  count, anxiously, while moving to the foot of the bed. It is obvious that at
  the moment I don't care a hoot about the patient. Generally he is so relieved
  that he wants to joke with me. Had I lost a nickel somewhere? Was my father a
  Scotsman? Would I like to borrow a dime?"</p>

  <p>"But you can work that only once on the same fellow," said Jack.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you don't need to work it more than once."</p>

  <p>Jack laughed.</p>

  <p>"Got any more little tricks like that?" he asked. "It's quite interesting.
  I suppose you go about with your pockets full of puzzles."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;that's too obvious. You'd never hook any sensible person in that
  manner.... Slattery is probably ready for me now. I'll see you later."</p>

  <p>He entered the room, carrying the pillow. Slattery's face was full of
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Jenny," she said, "this is Dr Cunningham; came to visit you."</p>

  <p>"Got enough pillows, Jenny?" asked Cunningham. "I have a few extra
  ones."</p>

  <p>"Sure!" sneered Jenny. "What'd I want with any more pillows?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right," he said, indifferently. "I'll give it to your
  mother."</p>

  <p>Jenny blinked a little, and raised up on her good elbow.</p>

  <p>"She's got pillows."</p>

  <p>"At home, yes," said the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Isn't my mother at home?"</p>

  <p>"No, she's here. She's sick."</p>

  <p>"Bad sick?" Jenny screwed up her face and began to whimper.</p>

  <p>"Pretty bad, yes. But she will be better if we can get the right kind of
  medicine. Would you like to send her some?"</p>

  <p>Jenny grinned a little through her tears.</p>

  <p>"She can have all of it."</p>

  <p>"No," said the doctor, "you'll have to make some&mdash;a special
  kind."</p>

  <p>"I can't make medicine," scoffed Jenny.</p>

  <p>Cunningham sat down by the bed.</p>

  <p>"Funny thing about medicine," he said, half to himself. "We get the stuff
  it's made of from the queerest places. Some of it comes from the juice of
  flowers and weeds, and the bark from trees; and some of it is made out of
  iron and gold and silver and coal."</p>

  <p>Jenny was quietly attentive, and the doctor went on.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes it's made of blood. That's the best kind."</p>

  <p>A shadow quickly crossed Jenny's face at the mention of blood. She winced
  and withdrew her finger from Cunningham's friendly hand.</p>

  <p>"We had a monkey here, named Celeste, who had just the kind of blood we
  needed for some medicine to give to your mother, but Celeste died this
  afternoon&mdash;so we're looking about. There were only three people in this
  hospital who had the right kind of blood."</p>

  <p>"Who?" inquired Jenny, with a dry swallow.</p>

  <p>"Martha Buckley&mdash;and Celeste&mdash;and you."</p>

  <p>"Monkeys aren't people!" piped Jenny, waspishly.</p>

  <p>"You would have liked Celeste, I think," said Cunningham. "She was only a
  monkey, but she was a very nice monkey. Now that Celeste is gone, that leaves
  Martha and you."</p>

  <p>Jenny began to cry; softly, at first. Then she buried her face in the
  pillow and mumbled, between sobs, "You're going to hurt me! You're going to
  hurt me&mdash;bad! Somebody's always hurting me&mdash;with big sharp needles
  and things." Her voice rose to a shriek. "I won't let you! I won't! I
  won't!"</p>

  <p>"Very well," said the doctor, gently. "That settles it, then." He patted
  her hand. "Don't cry. It's all right. I thought you might want to do this for
  your mummy, so she can get well. But&mdash;if you'd rather not, we will get
  it from Martha. I expect she will be glad to give up a spoonful of blood so
  that her little friend's mummy will have a chance to be well again."</p>

  <p>Jenny's hysteria was subsiding, the sobs still racking her thin chest
  spasmodically. Her eyes were full of terror. Suddenly she forced a small
  white fist hard against her chin and cried out, in a squeaky little voice,
  "I'll do it! I'll do it!... Oh, please don't hurt me! Oh&mdash;I can't! I
  can't!... But&mdash;I'll do it!"</p>

  <p>Cunningham ran his fingers through her damp curls and said tenderly, "You
  are a grand little girl, Jenny. I'm very proud of you. And when we tell your
  mummy what you did for her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He reached for the syringe. Slattery pushed up a sleeve and dabbed at the
  slim arm with an antiseptic. There was a tense, silent moment. Then
  Cunningham glanced up over his shoulder and said, "Slattery, this baby has
  got a lot of good stuff in her. I'm certainly glad to make her acquaintance."
  There was another moment of silence broken only by Jenny's laboured breathing
  as she braced her frail will against the pain.</p>

  <p>"There!" said the doctor. Miss Slattery rubbed the spot and drew down the
  sleeve. Jenny wiped her eyes with a corner of the sheet and tried to
  smile.</p>

  <p>Jack had slipped into the room and stood inside the door silently
  observant.</p>

  <p>"You said I was a baby." Jenny's lip trembled.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;that was a mistake. You aren't a baby. You are a grown-up
  lady. But you aren't too big to have a very beautiful doll to play with. It's
  going to be here&mdash;to-morrow. It is a gift from Dr Beaven. He will bring
  it to you."</p>

  <p>Jenny's eyes drifted across to Beaven who was standing at the foot of the
  bed.</p>

  <p>"Will she open and shut her eyes?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am," promised Jack, solemnly. "She will do everything that any
  doll can do."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"Afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Honour bright?"</p>

  <p>"Without fail."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NOT infrequently the Medical College Committee of the Board
  of Regents asked a faculty man or two as dinner guests. On the occasions when
  Tubby was invited he enjoyed himself immensely. He had a discriminating
  palate, and old Cremshaw, the chairman, always saw to it that the rations
  were edible.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the conversation was sprightly and Tubby was encouraged to
  contribute to it generously. Weary of wrangling among themselves all day, the
  Regents welcomed Tubby's dry satire and audacious impudence. Sometimes they
  guffawed with glee when one of their number, serving a hot verbal drive at
  the veteran professor, had it back immediately in his own court&mdash;neatly
  within bounds, but quite out of reach. Tubby knew what was expected of him at
  these affairs and he took pains to see that they were not disappointed.</p>

  <p>But Tuesday evening's dinner with the Regents had been one of the most
  unhappy events of his life. To begin with, he had spent a thoroughly wretched
  afternoon. Had Bill Cunningham come to the Medical College as a stranger,
  turning the institution upside-down, infecting the student body with the idea
  that it was more important to "live in a house by the side of the road and be
  a friend to man" than to earn a reputation as a sound pathologist, Tubby
  would have fought him in the open with all his might and no holds barred. But
  everybody knew that he and Bill were lifelong friends. He didn't want an open
  break with Bill; and, even if he did, it would have been mighty imprudent in
  the face of the Cunningham popularity.</p>

  <p>Tubby had never felt so utterly forsaken, so out of place, as when he had
  sat on the stage of the Auditorium aware that the whole Medical College, to
  which he had given his life's full devotion and for whose high rating he had
  been largely responsible, was unanimously and hilariously applauding a type
  of medical practice with which he had no sympathy at all. He had had to sit
  there and take it; and pretend to like it.</p>

  <p>After the speech, while the faculty was swarming forward to felicitate
  Cunningham, Tubby had briefly remarked to Shane that he had an appointment,
  had pushed through the pack and trudged down the back stairs and out into the
  rain, trying not to hear what the medics were saying as they ganged their way
  to the street. There was no urgent reason for his return to his office, but
  he went there mechanically, hung up his raincoat and umbrella, and fumbled
  through a small pile of late afternoon mail without the slightest inclination
  to open any of it.</p>

  <p>He had thought Romney should be leaving, for it was after five, but she
  was still at her desk in the corner typing a case-history. She did not look
  up. Tubby tried to think of something for her to do. He wanted to exercise
  what was left of his damaged authority. So low was he in spirit that it
  wouldn't have surprised him if meek little Romney, given an order, told him
  to go and jump in the river.</p>

  <p>Maybe she knew what had become of Beaven. Tubby's bitter hostility to
  Beaven had relaxed a bit during the past hour. With uncommonly good sense the
  chap had apparently decided that the neatest way to accept the Cunningham
  lecture was to ignore it. Tubby wished that he himself had been as wise.
  Beaven, unable to approve the popular stampede to Cunninghamery, had stayed
  away.</p>

  <p>Tubby cleared his throat raspingly, and Romney recognized the raucous
  noise as one of the amenities employed by the chief in summoning her to his
  desk.</p>

  <p>"Do you know where Dr Beaven is?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I think he is in the laboratory, sir. Shall I see?"</p>

  <p>Tubby nodded and twirled his watch-chain restlessly.</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell him you want him, sir?" asked Romney.</p>

  <p>Tubby did not reply immediately. He had been about to shake his head; then
  changed his mind. He was growing very tired of his feud with Beaven. It made
  him uncomfortable to be dodging the fellow; and, besides, it was deucedly
  inconvenient to be without his assistance. He had begun to realize what a
  large number of tasks Beaven had lifted from his shoulders; half-forgotten
  duties that had lately been dumped back on him. He missed Beaven; missed him
  in the operating-room. Sooner or later this quarrel would have to be made up.
  Perhaps this was as good a time as any. They had something in common to-day:
  they were both disgusted with Cunningham. Maybe if they talked about that it
  might be a move toward amity.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Tubby, crustily. "If he's there tell him I want to see
  him."</p>

  <p>Romney slipped out on her errand. In another minute she was back, a little
  bit flustered as if reluctant to report.</p>

  <p>"Dr Cunningham has just gone into the laboratory, sir. Shall I tell Dr
  Beaven to come now&mdash;or wait until he is at liberty?"</p>

  <p>"Let it go," grumped Tubby. Scowling darkly, he pocketed his letters,
  slammed his desk drawers, put on his raincoat and the hard wet hat, and
  stalked out. He had never been so completely depressed. It was almost as if
  his little world had come to an end.</p>

  <p>He drove back to the University Club and went up to his suite to change
  for the Regents' dinner. It would be late, and he liked his meals on time.
  There was some consolation in the fact that Cunningham wasn't to attend. He
  had been invited, Shane had said, but had declined because of another
  engagement; obviously an engagement with Beaven. That was rather odd. He
  hadn't supposed that Cunningham and Beaven were so thick.</p>

  <p>Time was dragging. Tubby didn't know what to do with himself. He took off
  his street clothes and pulled on a dressing-gown. He unfolded the evening
  paper, glanced at the headlines, and tossed it aside. It occurred to him that
  he had not opened his letters. He rummaged in his coat pocket for them and
  drew his chair closer to the light. One of the letters was from Claudia King.
  What, reflected Tubby, could that silly woman be wanting now?</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Dr Forrester," wrote Claudia. "For some time it has
  been on my mind to ask your counsel about a matter that concerns my sister. I
  have hesitated because I know how busy you are. But this problem has now
  become urgent and I am at my wit's end.<br>
  <br>
  "It is possible that you know of Dr Beaven's interest in Audrey. I would have
  no objection to that if his intentions were serious, for he is a fine fellow.
  But he has made it plain to Audrey that he does not expect to marry her. She
  is very much in love, I think. It isn't fair. My sister has not had a normal
  life. I remember telling you about her unusual upbringing in China. She
  doesn't adjust to our ways. It breaks my heart to see how lonesome she is and
  what a poor prospect she has of living happily here. Perhaps this might be
  remedied if she married some congenial man who would offer her an interesting
  home and a share in his social and business interests.<br>
  <br>
  "As the matter stands, she has given her heart away without any compensation.
  Dr Beaven offers her nothing but his friendship. I can't think that this is a
  very sound arrangement for either of them. It goes without saying that if he
  is in love with Audrey (and he would hardly have asked her to spend
  Thanksgiving with him if that were not true)..."</p><br>

  <p>Tubby's eyes hardened. So <i>that</i> was what ailed Beaven! It was this
  girl, who thought of herself as a Chinese! She had been filling his head full
  of ideas. The whole thing was plain as a pikestaff. It was crystal clear.
  Beaven had fallen in love, or thought he had, which came to the same thing;
  knew he hadn't any right to permit this distraction to break into his work.
  The situation had made him wretched; made him edgy. That accounted for his
  savage impudence. He was exasperated over his own dilemma.</p>

  <p>Flexing his jaw angrily, Tubby took up the letter again.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"I have thought of taking this up with the Cunninghams,"
  Claudia was saying. "Audrey sees a great deal of them. But it's no use.
  Apparently they are doing all they can to throw Audrey and Beaven together;
  persuaded her to go with them to the University this week while Dr Cunningham
  is lecturing.<br>
  <br>
  "I have wondered if you might not want to go into this problem with Dr
  Beaven. You have done so much for him. Surely he will listen to your advice.
  Tell him what a frightful mistake he is making. Forgive me for annoying you,
  but I have no one else to confide in. Please&mdash;won't you do
  something?"</p><br>

  <p>Tubby flung the letter down on the desk and walked the floor. Nice
  business for Bill Cunningham to be in! It wasn't quite enough for him to be
  down here with his abominable lectures and clinics. He had to aid and abet in
  confusing Beaven; playing match-maker; furnishing fuel and opportunity for an
  infatuation that might have cured itself if he and his clever wife had kept
  out of it.</p>

  <p>"Surely he will listen to your advice," Claudia thought. What nonsense!
  All Beaven needed, in his present state of mind, to send him utterly beyond
  reach, would be a nice little spot of advice. Tubby could visualize that
  scene. He would tell Beaven he was ruining himself, jeopardizing his career,
  disappointing the man who had made him&mdash;and Beaven would unquestionably
  tell the man who had made him to pick himself up by his hip-pockets and go
  galloping off to hell. No&mdash;you couldn't advise Beaven&mdash;not any
  more; certainly not on a matter so personal as this. Tubby was heart-sick;
  had a notion to flick the Regents' dinner, and go to bed.</p>

  <p>That impulse, however, was promptly disposed of. Tubby's stock was
  temporarily low, but there was no sense in announcing himself bankrupt. To
  absent himself from the Regents' dinner might create the impression that he
  was sulking; had had a humiliating experience and was now at home licking his
  wounds. No, sir; he'd have to eat, drink, and be merry with the Regents.</p>

  <p>But, by nine-thirty he was wishing he hadn't come. He couldn't think of
  anything he wanted to say to his dinner companions. Nobody baited him. In
  fact they were all of them infuriatingly polite, considerate, as if he had
  come in a wheel-chair with a shawl around his neck. By some perversity he had
  been seated between Shane and Denman, who talked across him about the
  spectacular popularity of Cunningham and the amazing turnout in the
  Auditorium on such a viciously bad day. They even had the crust to ask Tubby
  if he didn't think it was remarkable.</p>

  <p>"I see now," Denman was saying, "why Cunningham isn't with us." He jerked
  his head in the direction of the foursome in the middle of the dining-room.
  "Having a little party of his own."</p>

  <p>"Who's the attractive young brunette?" asked Shane. "Relative of the
  Cunningham's, maybe? I notice that Beaven is appreciating her charms."</p>

  <p>"That girl," said Denman, "has a story. Born and brought up in China. I
  met her last summer at the Cunninghams'. Most interesting. Decidedly oriental
  in her outlook."</p>

  <p>"Oh? So that accounts for the straight black bangs," remarked Shane.
  "Mighty becoming, eh?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't just the bangs," said Denman. "They're sort of symbolic of her
  whole state of mind."</p>

  <p>"Chink?" queried Shane.</p>

  <p>"One hundred per cent," said Denman. "Has the Chinese indifference to
  occidental ideas of progress, makes merry over our mechanical gadgets, thinks
  we're all running around in circles&mdash;wearing ourselves out with worry
  and work."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;that doctrine might be good for Beaven," suggested Shane. "He
  works like a dog."</p>

  <p>"It has been the making of him, too," put in Tubby, "and he knows it."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," agreed Shane, quickly. "Quite so."</p>

  <p>Tubby would have liked to pursue this matter a little farther, but it was
  evident that they wouldn't debate it with him. They were bent on humouring
  him to-night, as if he were an old man whose remarks should be accepted with
  a "Quite so, quite so", no matter how preposterous they were.</p>

  <p>It was that sort of evening, all the way through, and Tubby was glad when
  old Cremshaw pushed back his chair, slapped his knees with a gesture of
  finality, and said he knew they'd all had a good time&mdash;which was a
  lie.</p>

  <p>All next day&mdash;after an almost totally sleepless night&mdash;Tubby
  fretfully debated what course he should pursue. His hope of making common
  cause with Beaven over their mutual dissatisfaction with the Cunningham
  programme was now quite pointless. Beaven might not be in full sympathy with
  Cunningham's ideas, but it was evident that he was very fond of Cunningham,
  the man. Beaven's relation to Tubby was exactly the other way about. There
  was no use trying to talk to Beaven now about anything; much less offering
  him advice about his purely personal affairs. Nor would it do the slightest
  bit of good to talk to Cunningham.</p>

  <p>That night, in his room, the idea suddenly came to Tubby that he might put
  it up to the girl herself. It wasn't a very promising prospect. A young woman
  in love would find it difficult to efface herself for the sake of her man's
  future. She might be willing to sacrifice her own happiness to save him from
  disaster, but she would be an exceptional girl, indeed, if she consented to
  the proposition that her love was interfering with his work. Her normal
  reaction would be to declare that her love couldn't interfere with his work;
  that&mdash;quite to the contrary&mdash;he could do much better work if
  contented and cherished.</p>

  <p>However, there was at least the ghost of a chance that this Hilton girl
  might pursue a different course of reasoning than the selfish little
  flibbertygibbets toddling about the campus looking for an athletic
  dance-partner who might turn out to be a permanent meal-ticket. This Audrey
  Hilton was reputed to be oriental in mind. Tubby wasn't quite sure what sort
  of mind that might be, but there was a general rumour that the Far East took
  great pride in its spirit of resignation, non-resistance, and peace at any
  price. The Oriental was a disciple of the gentle Buddha, who had been either
  too tranquil or too indolent to bestir himself. According to the shrines, the
  Light of Asia was more of a glow-worm than a firebrand. Buddha sweetly smiled
  and sat. From the pictures of him, you couldn't have brought him into action
  with dynamite. If the Hilton girl took any stock in this sort of thing, she
  might be persuaded to give Beaven up without a protest. Maybe it was worth a
  trial.</p>

  <p>Tubby meditated on this for two hours, and decided he would do it; he
  would do it to-morrow; he would try to make an appointment with her for a
  private talk.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was an easy trip to Detroit&mdash;only an hour away. Edith Cunningham
  had suggested, shortly after breakfast, that they might run into town and do
  some Christmas shopping. Audrey cheerfully consented. The day had been
  pleasantly spent, though Edith remarked on the return trip that she was very
  tired and had a headache.</p>

  <p>Calling at the desk for their room-keys, Edith was handed a message.</p>

  <p>"They're not coming to dinner," she said. "They are tied up in something
  at the hospital. Far as I'm concerned, Audrey, it's a good thing. I'm a
  wreck. Would you mind very much, darling, if I didn't come down? All I want
  is a cup of tea and a hot bath."</p>

  <p>Audrey, too, had been handed a message. It was in a sealed envelope,
  bearing the embossed device of the University Club. She did not open it.</p>

  <p>"Anything I can do for you?" she asked, solicitously, as they parted at
  the elevator.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;nothing. Don't worry about me. I'll be all right. See you in the
  morning, dear."</p>

  <p>Disposing of her hat and coat, Audrey investigated the note. Her eyes
  widened as she read the signature. It was from Dr Forrester.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Miss Hilton," it began. "There is a matter of
  considerable importance which I should like to discuss with you, preferably
  in private, at your early convenience. I have tried to reach you to-day by
  telephone but learned that you were out of the city for a few hours. Perhaps
  you will call me up, on your return. I shall be at the University Club after
  five o'clock."</p><br>

  <p>It was rather a frightening prospect, this interview with Dr Forrester.
  Audrey frowned with perplexity. Of course she would have to
  reply&mdash;somehow. It was not to be dodged. For Jack's sake, she must
  consider Dr Forrester's request as little short of a command.</p>

  <p>She put through the call and sat waiting, apprehensively. The gruff voice,
  when it answered, was not very reassuring.</p>

  <p>"I am Miss Hilton. I have your note. I am quite willing to talk with you.
  You may come here, if you wish, now&mdash;or any time this evening. We are
  going home to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"You have no dinner engagement, then?" asked Tubby.</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"How would you like to have dinner with me, here at the University
  Club?"</p>

  <p>Audrey hesitated. If Dr Forrester wanted her to dine with him he must be
  in an amiable mood. Perhaps it might be to Jack's advantage if she humoured
  him. How very pleasant if she could help to heal that old quarrel.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Dr Forrester. I should be glad to do that."</p>

  <p>"Shall I come for you&mdash;or send for you&mdash;about eight-thirty?"</p>

  <p>"I shall come in a taxi, sir, and spare you the trouble.
  Eight-thirty?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be waiting for you in the reception parlour, Miss Hilton. Thank
  you for consenting to come."</p>

  <p>Much relieved, but still a bit anxious, Audrey prepared to go to Tubby's
  impromptu party. She stood before her wardrobe thoughtfully and decided on
  modish black satin, the jade necklace, the jade bracelet. She laid out also
  the jade ear-drops, but voted them down by a narrow margin.</p>

  <p>Promptly at eight-thirty she was shown to the door of the reception
  parlour, Tubby in dinner clothes coming forward to meet her. It was a pretty
  stiff smile but agreeable enough to assure Audrey that he probably wouldn't
  bite her head off until they were a little better acquainted. She offered him
  her hand and he bowed over it with grave dignity. Without pausing for any
  conversation, Tubby presented an elbow of the old school and Audrey laid her
  hand in the crook of it. They marched to the dining-room in silence, Tubby
  staring straight ahead as they passed down through the long, rather dimly
  lighted hall to a table in a far corner where two white-jacketed waiters were
  expecting their arrival. It was quite remote from the other diners at tables
  near the door; so sequestered, indeed, thought Audrey, that she might easily
  be murdered here, and the crime remain a mystery.</p>

  <p>Tubby proceeded, without small talk, to consult her wishes about the
  dinner. Pinching on his gold-rimmed glasses, he glared at her over the top,
  and asked her if she wanted a cocktail. She smilingly shook her head.</p>

  <p>"But you want one, I think," she said. "Perhaps you will find me a little
  fruit cup."</p>

  <p>"For the entrée," queried Tubby, with a dry smile, "would you like a
  vegetable dinner? I understand you affect oriental habits, Miss Hilton. I
  would suggest a steak&mdash;but perhaps you do not eat meat. Does your
  religion enjoin you against killing animals for food?" It was evident that
  Tubby was going to insist on making her seem an alien.</p>

  <p>"I do not believe I could, Dr Forrester."</p>

  <p>"Pardon?" Tubby leaned forward quizzing her eyes. It was very amusing and
  Audrey had difficulty in keeping a straight face.</p>

  <p>"I never killed an animal for food, sir," she said naïvely. "But if this
  beef is already dead, I think I could eat some of it; thank you."</p>

  <p>After that, Tubby did not emphasize her oriental background; but treated
  her with exaggerated deference as if he feared he might unwittingly offend
  some strange foreign quirk. Audrey thought she knew, now, which way we were
  headed. She wasn't the girl for Jack. She was different. She wasn't regular.
  It would have been fun, she thought, to ask solemnly if she might have a pair
  of chop-sticks.</p>

  <p>Tubby deliberately built up a nice entrance for his argument. Miss Hilton,
  he supposed, must have had a most interesting life in China; must have found
  it extremely difficult to accommodate herself to our uncouth American ways;
  must be looking forward to an early return to a country so very much more
  tranquil, so very much less confusing. It was almost as if he were offering
  her a one-way steamship ticket.</p>

  <p>Yes, Audrey had agreed, she had enjoyed China and the warm friendship of
  all those in her foster-father's house, but she had no intention of
  returning; certainly not to live there. America was now her country.</p>

  <p>"But you don't like it here, do you?" demanded Tubby. "We're much too
  occupied with our machinery, aren't we?"</p>

  <p>"Are you?" asked Audrey. "I do not know much about such things."</p>

  <p>They had arrived at the dessert before Tubby abandoned his various
  strategies and came out into the open field.</p>

  <p>"The fact is, Miss Hilton&mdash;and this is what I wanted to talk to you
  about&mdash;it seems fairly clear that you now hold the destiny of a very
  important young man in your hands." He put his spoon down on the plate and
  leaned forward with his elbows on the table. "This man Beaven has in him the
  making of a great scientist. I have watched his progress for years. He is not
  only a man of exceptional talents but very strong character. He has
  consecrated himself to his work, enduring hardness like a soldier, giving up
  every youthful pleasure, renouncing love, home, recreations, social pursuits,
  so that he might give full time and his whole mind to his task. And it is a
  noble task! It is not too much to hope that he may provide the means for the
  amelioration of much human suffering.</p>

  <p>"And now&mdash;at the moment when he is just beginning to reap the first
  fruits of all this self-sacrifice, <i>you</i> arrive on the scene.
  Please!"&mdash;Tubby's voice was unsteady, passionately in
  earnest&mdash;"please let me talk to you as a father might counsel his child.
  I can understand Beaven's infatuation for you. You are a very winsome young
  woman. I do not want to like you, because you are standing in the way of
  Beaven's career, but I do like you. You are most attractive, desirable,
  adorable! If you weren't so thoroughly lovely, I might be less concerned.
  Your charm is a liability.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;and this is my only ground for hope&mdash;you are sensible, I
  think, and unless I am much mistaken about you, you are very strong.
  So&mdash;I appeal to you, in a spirit of fair play. I wish you would give
  Beaven up. Hand him back to his important job. He is distraught, restless,
  unhappy. His mind is divided. His work is slipping. He is losing ground. You
  think he loves you. Perhaps he does. But he loved his career for a long time
  before he loved <i>you.</i> How much will he love you, five years from now,
  when he discovers that the goal he set for himself, years ago, and pursued at
  so great cost, is beyond his reach?" Tubby paused and sighed deeply.</p>

  <p>"Of course, you can have him. He will not be able to resist your
  affection. If you ask him, to-morrow, if he would rather have you
  stay&mdash;or disappear from his life, he will unquestionably urge you to
  stay. This problem is not for Beaven to solve: it's <i>your</i> problem, and
  if you solve it at all you must solve it alone! Perhaps the greatest
  contribution you will ever have a chance to make, in behalf of the world's
  welfare, is a prompt and firm decision to clear the path for this man you
  love!"</p>

  <p>Audrey had been trying to maintain her poise, but Tubby's entreaties were
  beating her down. She felt very helpless, cornered, weaponless. Except for
  themselves, the spacious dining-room was empty. The last of the late diners
  had left more than an hour ago.</p>

  <p>"Or <i>do</i> you love him," demanded Tubby, urgently, "loyally enough to
  step out of his way?"</p>

  <p>Audrey blinked back the tears and stared into his steely eyes, frightened,
  overpowered.</p>

  <p>"Do you honestly think I should?" she asked, half to herself.</p>

  <p>"I do!" declared Tubby.</p>

  <p>She turned her face away and tried to control it. Could it be possible
  that Tubby was right? She painfully recalled that afternoon at the lake when
  Jack had so firmly, almost fiercely announced that his life belonged to his
  work; that he had no right to love anybody. Perhaps he still felt so about
  it. Maybe he was secretly unhappy, as Tubby said. Was it true that she had
  led him into a situation he had tried to avoid?</p>

  <p>"And I think&mdash;" Tubby was saying, as if he read her mind, "I
  <i>know,</i> that you have some grave misgivings about all this. Is that not
  true?"</p>

  <p>She returned her baffled eyes and slowly nodded her head.</p>

  <p>"You are a brave girl!" Tubby's voice was husky. "I felt it. I'm glad I
  had the courage to take this up with you. Now I leave you to decide on your
  next step. You will know what to do. Perhaps you may feel that the easy way
  out is to return to China for a year or two, long enough to give Beaven a
  chance to pull himself together."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence. Audrey, with her elbows on the table and her
  small fists pressing hard against her throat, again nodded her head. Her eyes
  were closed and the hot tears were seeping through her long lashes.</p>

  <p>"Verree well," she said. "I shall go&mdash;to China."</p>

  <p>Tubby bowed.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything I can do for you, my friend?" he asked, almost
  gently.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;nothing&mdash;thank you."</p>

  <p>"Are you able to go&mdash;I mean&mdash;financially? May I help you?"</p>

  <p>"Please don't say anything more," begged Audrey.</p>

  <p>"I meant it kindly," said Tubby.</p>

  <p>Audrey's attention was stirred by a man rapidly approaching their table; a
  desk clerk, probably, for he was not in uniform.</p>

  <p>"You are wanted on the telephone, Dr Forrester," he said, evidently
  agitated.</p>

  <p>"I thought I left word that I was not to be disturbed," said Tubby,
  crossly. "You take the message, or tell them to call later."</p>

  <p>"If you please, sir," insisted the clerk, "it is very important. It is
  from the hospital. I told them you could not be bothered. But someone has
  been badly hurt."</p>

  <p>"You tell them I'll be over there in a half-hour."</p>

  <p>"But, sir," persisted the man, "it's Dr Beaven&mdash;and he is not in the
  hospital."</p>

  <p><i>"What?"</i> Tubby pushed back his chair and without a glance at Audrey
  marched swiftly after the clerk. For a moment Audrey sat stunned and
  trembling; then, with a painful little cry, she rose and followed him.</p>

  <p>He was in a telephone booth when she overtook him. The narrow door had
  been left open. Audrey's knees were trembling. She leaned against the edge of
  the door for support; then she crowded in so close beside Tubby that her
  cheek pressed hard against his arm. With parted lips and every fibre tensely
  alert, she listened.</p>

  <p>It was a woman's voice, talking from the hospital. They had had a
  mysterious telephone call from Wheaton. It appeared that Dr Beaven had been
  summoned out there on some pretext, and had been in a fight. Then the men who
  fought him had run away. "And the man who called up would have to run away,
  too, he said, but he didn't want to leave Dr Beaven to die. He says you must
  bring along two hundred dollars to help him get away. Then he will tell you
  where Dr Beaven is&mdash;somewhere out in the country. You are to drive out
  on Highway Number 6, the Wheaton road, and carry on until you come to the
  high-school."</p>

  <p>"Just a minute," interrupted Tubby, hoarsely. He turned to Audrey and
  muttered, "Get a pencil and paper&mdash;quickly: over there&mdash;at the
  desk."</p>

  <p>She was back in a moment, laid the memorandum pad on the narrow ledge, and
  handed Tubby the pencil.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," he ordered. "High-school. Then what?"</p>

  <p>"On the top step, you will find Dr Beaven's surgical kit, empty. That's to
  let you know they aren't faking. You are to put the money into the satchel,
  and leave. In fifteen minutes you are to come back. In the satchel you will
  find directions leading you to Dr Beaven."</p>

  <p>"Get out the ambulance!" said Tubby. "Tell them to come here at once and
  pick me up! I'll be waiting at the front door!"</p>

  <p>"No," said the girl on the telephone. "That's another thing. No ambulance.
  No police. You're to go in your own car.... Is there anything we can do,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, I suppose&mdash;but get a room ready, and wait for further
  instructions." Tubby's wobbly voice sounded like that of an old man. He
  staggered against Audrey as he came out of the booth.</p>

  <p>"I must go," he muttered. "You can find your way back to the hotel."</p>

  <p>"Please!" begged Audrey. "I'm going with you."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;no!" said Tubby, firmly. He was moving toward the
  elevator, Audrey clinging to his arm. "I say&mdash;<i>no!</i> It's too
  dangerous! Can't tell what you might run into, out there. No need of your
  taking this risk. Nothing you can do." He shook himself loose and stepped
  into the elevator. The door closed quietly.</p>

  <p>For a little while, Audrey stood there dazedly wondering what to do. The
  clerk came to her and asked solicitously if there was anything he could do
  for her. She shook her head and walked slowly in the direction of the
  check-room where Tubby had deposited her fur coat. She heard the telephone
  ringing at the desk, and the switchboard operator saying, "Right away, sir".
  Immediately the same voice was saying, "Bring Dr Forrester's coupé to the
  front door&mdash;at once&mdash;immediately&mdash;pronto!"</p>

  <p>"Shall I get you a taxi, Miss?" asked the clerk, visibly upset over her
  apparent bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," she said. The porter opened the heavy front door for her,
  and she stepped out into the open vestibule. It was snowing now. She drew her
  collar up about her throat, and waited. Presently a big blue coupé drew up to
  the curb. A garage attendant got out, leaving the engine running. He gave
  Audrey an inquisitive stare as she opened the door.</p>

  <p>"This is Dr Forrester's car, ma'am," he said, respectfully.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied, "I know."</p>

  <p>Tubby, bundled up to the chin, came down the steps, jerked the car-door
  open, and climbed in.</p>

  <p>"I thought I told you that you weren't going!" he said, fiercely.</p>

  <p>"I <i>am</i> going!" said Audrey, "I am as much interested in him as you
  are! I shall keep the promise I made you&mdash;but I am going to
  him&mdash;now!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It hadn't been much of a trick to make the serum. Jack was ready to
  administer it shortly before eight o'clock. Cunningham, seeing no reason why
  he should remain any longer, announced that he was going across to old Tony's
  for his dinner. It would remind him of old times.</p>

  <p>Mrs Collins whined a little when she saw the young surgeon arrive with a
  formidable instrument in hand, and he challenged her courage by saying, "This
  is a serum, made from Jenny's blood. She was glad to let us have it when we
  told her it was for you. Aren't you proud of her?"</p>

  <p>With this job attended to, Jack noted with satisfaction that the whole
  evening was before him. Lan Ying would be waiting for him. Returning quickly
  to the laboratory to change to his street clothes, he heard his telephone
  ringing before he had unlocked the door. He hurried in and answered it,
  hoping it might be Lan Ying or Edith.</p>

  <p>The call was coming in from a pay-station. The coin-bell rang four times,
  at close intervals; two quarters and two dimes, maybe; one quarter, two
  dimes, and a nickel, perhaps.</p>

  <p>An unrecognized voice said, in a low tone that seemed anxious not to be
  overheard, "Dr Beaven? I'm a friend of Tom Buckley's. He has met with an
  accident, out here in Wheaton, and wants to know if you can come over and fix
  him up."</p>

  <p>"How badly hurt?"</p>

  <p>"Bad enough."</p>

  <p>"Bleeding?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;plenty!"</p>

  <p>"It probably is urgent, then. Better call in a local doctor to stop the
  hæmorrhage, and I'll be over in the morning."</p>

  <p>"He won't see anybody but you, Doc. Says you'll know why. Are you
  coming?"</p>

  <p>"Very well. Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"At a house in Wheaton. I'll tell you what to do, Doc. Drive right into
  Wheaton on the highway. I'll meet you at the edge of town, and pilot you in.
  Then you won't get lost."</p>

  <p>"What's the nature of his injuries; bruises, cuts, fractures?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Pretty much all o' that. Thanks, Doc. I'll be looking for you in
  half an hour."</p>

  <p>Jack hung up the receiver and stood for a moment reviewing the
  conversation. It hadn't sounded like the voice of a tough; but, considering
  all of the circumstances, there was no question but this summons should be
  regarded as a possible bid for serious trouble. Buckley had been terrified at
  the thought of what might happen to him. Evidently he knew what he was up
  against. Perhaps Buckley was more deeply involved than he had admitted.
  Probably had a flock of reasons for not wanting any new people&mdash;not even
  another doctor&mdash;to become interested in his affairs.</p>

  <p>Quickly changing to his street clothes, and assembling an emergency
  surgical kit, Jack hurried out into the rainy night, and climbed into his
  roadster&mdash;the only car left on the lot. As he neared the police station,
  he slowed down, indecisively. Common prudence suggested that a man should
  have some protection on an errand of this nature. That's what the police were
  for, wasn't it? He brought the car to a full stop directly under the lights
  that served the main entrance, but immediately abandoned the idea. If Buckley
  was in a scrape, it wouldn't help him very much to have a cop coming into the
  picture. Jack pushed on, resolved to see the affair through without
  assistance.</p>

  <p>The decision pleased him. He stoutly maintained to himself that he wasn't
  the least bit smug over it; had no inclination to dramatize himself as an
  audacious young hero; but there was a certain satisfaction in being able to
  drive voluntarily into what might turn out to be a very dangerous situation.
  At first he had not given much thought to the possibilities as they might
  affect him personally. But now he began to reflect that if anyone had injured
  Buckley for "squealing", he, himself, might be attacked for the same reason.
  The farther he went the larger loomed this fact: he and Thomas Buckley had a
  common enemy.</p>

  <p>But he had no inclination to turn back. He was glad of that. The
  speedometer moved up to sixty. The tyres sizzled on the black asphalt. He had
  the road practically to himself. A curious exhilaration accompanied his
  consciousness of danger. Every sense was alert, aware. This physical
  phenomenon interested him deeply. Bill Cunningham had spoken of it, the other
  day, but hadn't told him anything he didn't know about it. Many a time in the
  classroom he had drawled carelessly that the sensation of fear and the
  knowledge of impending danger set the adrenals going at full speed, pouring
  their mysterious tincture into the blood-stream, making the soldier more
  keenly alert, tightening his muscle-fibres, saturating him with such powerful
  astringents that his mouth was parched and dry.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he could hear himself saying, casually, "the primary purpose
  of this emergency adrenalin, suddenly dumped into the blood-stream, is to
  provide a more prompt and sure coagulation of the blood in the event of an
  injury resulting in a hæmorrhage. Nature," he was accustomed to add,
  whimsically, "Nature has her moments when she is almost considerate."</p>

  <p>Jack felt now that he could amplify his classroom comments on this
  subject. He had verified the textbooks, and had discovered something more.
  This emergency shot of adrenalin, administered by Nature, had also the value
  of a stimulating intoxicant. "If a man could live constantly under the
  influence of this heady stuff," reflected Jack, "he would be quite a
  fellow."</p>

  <p>He became so absorbed in an examination of his own mental processes that
  he was barely conscious of the speed at which he bowled along the lonely
  highway.</p>

  <p>Life had been pretty carefully marked out for him, hitherto, every step of
  the way. There had been the usual conflicts of the school playground, and the
  rough-and-tumble of the athletic field in college, but nobody had ever
  attacked him with a sinister purpose. Such sturdiness of character as he had
  come by, through the years, had been largely the product of
  self-restraint&mdash;a negative virtue, admittedly. It startled him a little
  to reflect that this was the first time in his life that he had deliberately
  hurled himself into a situation brimming with menace. He wasn't
  congratulating himself, but he realized that to have taken some less resolute
  course, to-night, would have impoverished him. Little Jenny Collins was
  nothing but an alley-rat. You had no right to expect anything of her. But in
  a stressful moment Jenny had been willing to face the music, and he had
  complimented her. If he had flicked to-night's problematical errand, he
  reflected, it would have been very difficult for him ever again to look into
  a pair of frightened eyes and challenge them to be courageous.</p>

  <p>Nature&mdash;in spite of her cruelties, her mistakes, her wanton
  wastefulness, her indifference to the world's malformations, misfortunes, and
  miseries&mdash;wasn't a bad old girl, at that. If you showed the slightest
  disposition to co-operate with her, when she poured out the adrenalin, it was
  an experience well worth having.</p>

  <p>A black-lettered signboard flashed by. One mile to Wheaton. Scattered
  lights grew more numerous. Jack began slowing down. He found himself rapidly
  overtaking a car that held to the middle of the road, a battered old sedan,
  travelling at a snail's pace. At once he surmised that he was being met by
  the man who was to direct him to Buckley. The driver thrust out an arm and
  beckoned him to follow. Jack tapped his horn, a couple of times, to indicate
  his receipt of the signal, and the leading car increased its speed.</p>

  <p>They drove through the sleepy little town of Wheaton and a mile beyond
  where the pilot car turned south on a gravelled road. There were about five
  miles of this. Then, at a country crossroads, the gravel gave out, and the
  road was muddy. Both cars proceeded with caution. After another mile the
  pilot car came to a stop at the entrance to a lane. A man with a flashlight
  stepped forward and opened the right-hand door of Jack's car.</p>

  <p>"Here you are, Doc," he rumbled. "Get out, and I'll lead the way. I'm
  afraid you're goin' to find it a bit muddy, but you can't drive up this
  lane."</p>

  <p>There was nothing of menace in the fellow's tone or behaviour. He was
  making no effort to disguise himself. His implied apology for the mud was
  encouraging.</p>

  <p>"Will it be all right to leave my car here in the middle of the road?"
  Jack inquired. "Doesn't anyone ever come this way?"</p>

  <p>"Not often. Not this time o' night. Leave your lights on."</p>

  <p>"How's Buckley?" Jack was following along through the sticky mud, the
  driver of the pilot car bringing up the rear. He had not yet seen this
  fellow's face. The man with the flashlight was doing the talking. It was his
  voice that had telephoned.</p>

  <p>"A little better. He had quite a bit of trouble to-night and I think he's
  expectin' some more. Haven't got a gun on you, have you, Doc?"</p>

  <p>This query was rather disquieting. Jack wasn't certain why it had been
  asked. Perhaps it would be a mistake to reveal that he was defenceless.</p>

  <p>"Had you thought," he said, "that I would be likely to start out into the
  country, this late at night, unarmed?"</p>

  <p>The man at the rear chuckled unpleasantly and decreased his distance.
  After that they plodded along in silence for about a hundred yards. Then they
  came to a small gate set in a dilapidated fence, heavily overgrown with
  unkempt shrubbery. They entered through the open gate and approached an
  unpainted, one-storey house. Judging by what he saw, in the dim glow of the
  flashlight, the place had been long neglected; probably untenanted.</p>

  <p>A rectangle of obscured light, defining an ill-fitted window-curtain,
  indicated that the room to the right of the front door was in use. The
  remainder of the house was dark. The man in the lead opened the door into a
  narrow, bare hall. Jack bumped into the banister-post of a stingy stairway.
  The three of them were at close quarters in the gloomy little enclosure.</p>

  <p>"I'll take your hat and coat, Doc," said the spokesman. "Tom's in there."
  He nodded toward the door of the room from which the light shone. For an
  instant Jack hesitated about taking off his coat, but decided that if there
  was to be any commotion he might be as well off without it. He opened the
  door to the lighted room.</p>

  <p>In the centre was a home-made table covered with soiled paper dishes and
  the remnants of a meal. Thomas Buckley, seated on the other side, near the
  old-fashioned cooking-stove, was still eating. He glanced up, grinned
  sheepishly, and mumbled, "Hello, Doc", with his mouth full. Jack guessed that
  Buckley had been missing a few meals and was making up for lost time.</p>

  <p>"Thought you were hurt," rasped Jack. "What's all this about?"</p>

  <p>"They'll tell you, Doc," said Buckley, munching his steak.</p>

  <p>The other men had now followed into the room. Jack set his surgical kit
  down on the floor beside him and surveyed his companions with interest. The
  man who had carried the flashlight was probably forty. He was a little over
  average height, and well built. It was not an unintelligent face; lean,
  determined, deeply lined, innumerable crow's-feet about the eyes, a
  corrugated forehead from which the hair receded thinly. He wore a new suit of
  blue overalls and was apparently well dressed underneath, judging from the
  white collar and neatly tied scarf. He looked like a person who had lived a
  pretty rough life, but he was not a hoodlum. The other chap was slightly
  younger, shabbier, stockier, slower, and it was obvious that he was playing
  second fiddle.</p>

  <p>They sauntered across the room, sat down on the old kitchen chairs near
  the wall, and regarded Jack with interest. The brighter one lighted a
  cigarette. They had not asked their guest to sit down. He remained standing,
  awaiting information.</p>

  <p>"You see, Doc," began the older man, "it's this way. My friend, Tom
  Buckley, made a bad mistake the other day when he let it out that we'd done
  some plumbin' in those lousy little rabbit-hutches up by the reservoir. So,
  we picked him up and brought him out here, just to make sure he wouldn't do
  any more talkin' for a while. First off, we had decided&mdash;Rusty and
  me&mdash;that we'd beat hell out of him for squawking and then take him away
  somewhere and lose him. But after he told us that he'd let you into
  it&mdash;about where the pipe come from, 'n' all&mdash;there didn't seem to
  be much point to our closin' Buckley's loose mouth unless we were pretty sure
  that you'd be willing to forget what he told you. See?"</p>

  <p>Jack nodded.</p>

  <p>"But what I do not see," he countered, "is the occasion for your bringing
  me out here, to this infernal mud-hole, in order to make your statement. I
  should think you could have come to my office and said all that without
  putting me to quite so much bother."</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;wouldn't that have been a slick thing for me to do?" railed the
  spokesman. "No, Doc, we hated to cause you so much trouble, but we weren't
  making any dates to see you at your office. We've been in the jug
  before&mdash;Rusty and me&mdash;and we're not going in again. See?"</p>

  <p>Jack said he saw, and the other continued.</p>

  <p>"All you have to do, Doc, is to keep your shirt on and obey instructions.
  We think we've arranged it all so that nobody's goin' to get hurt. That
  is&mdash;we hope so&mdash;barring accidents. This half-starved little louse
  here"&mdash;he gestured with his head toward Thomas, who was now
  industriously picking his teeth&mdash;"is leavin' to-night on a long trip,
  maybe to Florida, and he's goin' to stay down there for a long time, and grow
  himself a nice big moustache, big enough to cover his mouth. Rusty is goin'
  to drive him down. And I think it would be kind of decent, Doc, if you would
  lend them your car, though that wasn't the reason we asked you to come over.
  That was a new idea we had just before you got here."</p>

  <p>Jack found himself growing restless under this harangue, and glanced about
  the room, taking stock of its doors and windows.</p>

  <p>"Now I hope you ain't plannin' to run out on us, Doc, before we've told
  you why you're here. That wouldn't be polite. And, speakin' of politeness, I
  haven't introduced myself. I'm Ted Billows. I'm the boy that stole the
  pipe&mdash;me and Rusty. He didn't have much to do with it, except to truck
  it over there, but that'll be plenty when the P.A. looks into his record. We
  didn't commit a very serious crime, and I suppose a crooked lawyer could get
  us off with a light sentence. But I jumped a parole, one time, and have done
  two stretches in the big house, and I don't care to get too chummy with the
  cops.</p>

  <p>"I expect you'd like to know where you come in at, Doc. Well&mdash;this is
  to notify you that you're to forget everything this wormy little rat told
  you, or we'll be right over there to take you for a ride!" Billows leaned
  forward, belligerently, and clenched his fist. "And if you don't like this
  idea, my handsome young feller, you just say so, and we'll give you a
  sample&mdash;right now! See?"</p>

  <p>The Rusty person stood up, at that, and shambled around the wall until he
  was to the rear of Jack, who turned about to keep him in view.</p>

  <p>"Frisk him, Rusty," ordered Billows. "We don't want any fireworks
  here&mdash;if we can help it."</p>

  <p>"You needn't bother," growled Jack. "I haven't a gun."</p>

  <p>"Better look, anyhow, Rusty," advised Billows, rising. "He might have one,
  and get excited. And I think I'll take a squint into that cute little black
  satchel, too."</p>

  <p>Rusty moved forward and ran his hands down over Jack's hips and said, "I
  guess he lied about havin' a gat." Billows grinned, and stooped to pick up
  the surgical kit. Then the unexpected suddenly happened to him. Possibly had
  the odds not been against him, Jack would have preferred to deliver the blow
  when Billows was standing erect and on guard, but it was no time to be over
  fastidious about such matters. It was a savage upper-cut, swiftly but
  accurately swung, and aimed for the point of the jaw. Without pausing to mark
  the score, Jack turned on the astounded Rusty, who was coming tardily into
  action, and struck him full in the face. Rusty came at him like an animal,
  half dazed, and clawing for a clinch. With both hands raised, Rusty was
  leaving a very sensitive area exposed between the third and fourth buttons of
  his shabby waistcoat. Jack found it with a thudding right. When it
  registered, Rusty involuntarily hugged the sickening pain; and, while thus
  engaged, took another bad wallop on the nose that staggered him. He was
  bleeding freely and one more well-placed pop would probably be enough. Jack
  had heard nothing further from Billows, and assumed that he was taking his
  time for recovery. He decided to finish with Rusty. Then he heard the legs of
  a chair scrape along the floor.</p>

  <p>"Look out, Doc!" screamed Buckley.</p>

  <p>There was a terrific crash. Jack had one split-second of sensation that
  something had exploded in his head.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>They were a badly frightened little group.</p>

  <p>It was very quiet in the room. The three of them squatted in a semi-circle
  about Beaven's head, their faces pale and anxious.</p>

  <p>"What the hell did you do that for?" whispered Rusty, mopping his mouth
  with a bloody handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" croaked Billows.</p>

  <p>"Think we'd better blow?" asked Rusty. "This bird's a-dyin'&mdash;right
  now!"</p>

  <p>Buckley slumped on to his hands and knees, and was noisily sick.</p>

  <p>"You guys stay here," muttered Billows. "I'll go for a doctor."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you will!" sneered Rusty. "Gettin' ready to beat it, are
  you&mdash;and leave us a-holdin' the bag?"</p>

  <p>"O.K.," said Billows. "You go for a doctor, and I'll stay. Take the louse
  with you."</p>

  <p>"I'm not goin' for a doctor," growled Rusty. "Everybody knows me over
  here."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll go," said Billows. "Buckley, you're so damn' well acquainted
  over at the college: who's a good doc to call up? We'll get him started, and
  then we can clear out."</p>

  <p>Thomas sat up dizzily.</p>

  <p>"There's an old guy named Forrester. He's this fellow's boss, like," said
  Thomas, weakly.</p>

  <p>"Roll him over," said Billows. "I want his keys. I'm goin' to take his
  car."</p>

  <p>"Yeah? And you ain't comin' back. Goin' to let us sit with it!"</p>

  <p>Billows made no reply to that. They eased Beaven over on his side. The
  contusion on his scalp was bleeding. There was a spreading pool of blood on
  the floor. Billows rummaged through the pockets, and found the keys,
  scrambled to his feet, hurried out, and slammed the door.</p>

  <p>Rusty stooped down with his ear close to Beaven's mouth and listened.</p>

  <p>"He's still breathing," he whispered, "but it's mighty weak. Let's get out
  o' here. I'm not goin' to be found when the docs and cops come. Get into the
  guy's pill-bag, Buckley. See if you can't find a plaster, er sumpin'."</p>

  <p>"Where is it?" mumbled Buckley, hiccoughing. "It ain't here. Billows took
  it! What do you know about that?"</p>

  <p>They heard a motor spin.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" said Rusty. "We can't do anything for this bird. Get your
  coat."</p>

  <p>"He might die!" protested Thomas.</p>

  <p>"That's what I'm a-tellin' yuh! We gotta beat it!"</p>

  <p>They pulled on their coats, tiptoed out of the house, closed the door, and
  slithered through the mud toward the road. It was snowing. They turned up
  their shabby overcoat collars.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going now?" asked Thomas.</p>

  <p>"We're a-goin' to drive south till we run out o' money and
  gas&mdash;and&mdash;after that&mdash;I don't know. Every feller for himself,
  I guess&mdash;after that."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THEY had covered the first dozen blocks without
  conversation. The streets were very slippery and the big snowflakes,
  splashing against the windshield, made driving difficult. It was clear that
  Tubby had resolved to ignore the presence of his unwelcome passenger.</p>

  <p>It was equally clear, however, that he was acutely aware of her, for when
  she drew her fur coat closer about her knees and shivered, Tubby, staring
  straight ahead, muttered sullenly, "There's a robe back of you. Better wrap
  it around your legs. You're not dressed properly for this trip." Then,
  dissatisfied with this show of interest in her comfort, he added, "You
  shouldn't have come. I told you not to. You're likely to get into trouble.
  You'll be only a bother."</p>

  <p>"Want some of this?" inquired Audrey, offering him a share of the
  robe.</p>

  <p>"One can't drive with one's feet tangled up," grumbled Tubby. "You ought
  to know that."</p>

  <p>Audrey said she was sorree, tucked the robe about her, and relaxed into
  her corner. They were making better time now, having passed the last of the
  city traffic signals. The pointer on the speedometer dial had moved up to
  forty-five.</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine," said Tubby, glumly communing with himself, "what
  possible reason Beaven had for getting into a fight with hoodlums." Audrey
  offered no comment on this, and after a moment's silence, he growled, "You
  wouldn't know anything about it, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"A little," she admitted. "Jack discovered that several cases of infantile
  paralysis had been caused by bad water which some men had brought into their
  houses secretly. They had laid the pipes themselves, and had stolen the
  materials. He was threatened not to tell about it."</p>

  <p>"And how did it get to be Beaven's business to investigate this matter?"
  demanded Tubby. "I thought we had a City Health Officer who nosed out the
  source of epidemics.... Rather odd&mdash;Beaven's not informing me about
  this."</p>

  <p>Audrey made no reply; and Tubby, permitted to draw the conclusion that she
  did not see anything odd about it, continued, irascibly, "Very queer, indeed!
  If he was in trouble, why didn't he come to me? He tells <i>you!</i> Nothing
  <i>you</i> could do! Maybe everybody in town knows about it&mdash;but me. But
  when he gets into a scrape&mdash;then I'm let into the secret. He's glad
  enough to send for me."</p>

  <p>"Did he send for you?" asked Audrey, quietly.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'm the one who has to go to the rescue. It all comes to the
  same thing, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>Unwilling to debate this phase of the problem, Audrey did not answer.
  Tubby, indignant over having been slighted, was stating the present dilemma
  in the worst possible way, but there was an element of truth in what he was
  saying. Audrey felt honestly sorry for him. It was his own fault that Jack
  had not confided in him. And Jack was not responsible for his having been
  turned out on this risky mission of rescue; but it was a fact that Tubby had
  not been asked for advice and it was also a fact that he was now on his way
  to offer belated help. Three or four miles slipped under their wheels, Tubby
  sternly scowling at the road. Audrey broke the silence.</p>

  <p>"Did you bring along some bandages&mdash;and things?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly!" muttered Tubby. "There's a surgeon's kit in the locker. Had
  you thought I might come out on an errand like this with empty hands?"</p>

  <p>"I should have known," apologized Audrey.</p>

  <p>Tubby approved this retraction with a grumpy grunt, and fed his motor a
  little more fuel. After another mile, Audrey ventured to ask, "Do you think
  they may attack us?"</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't be surprised." Tubby drawled this as if it didn't matter much.
  "They are reckless," he went on, mostly to himself, "demanding a trivial
  amount of money to be left in a conspicuous place, at an hour when there may
  be people on the streets. A man who would take a chance like that&mdash;for
  two hundred dollars&mdash;" He broke off suddenly to say, indifferently,
  "They'll probably kidnap you. Are you afraid?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," admitted Audrey.</p>

  <p>"You amaze me!" Tubby's tone was maliciously ironical. "Just as I had
  begun to think you a remarkably courageous young woman, you tell me you're
  scared.... I shouldn't have allowed you to come."</p>

  <p>"It will not be your responsibility, Dr Forrester, if I am hurt. I
  insisted on coming, and I am glad I did. But&mdash;you asked me if I was
  frightened. Indeed I am. I feel so unprotected."</p>

  <p>Tubby instantly resented that remark with a surly "Humph!" Then, after a
  little sour reflection, he said, "Unprotected, eh? Perhaps you think I'm a
  coward." He turned toward her, momentarily, with a challenging look; and,
  when her reply was delayed, he jerked his head toward her again as if
  demanding an answer&mdash;the right answer, too!</p>

  <p>"My Chinese foster-father," said Audrey, coolly deliberate, "taught me
  that it is always dangerous to face conflict in the company of a person who
  habitually disregards the rights and wishes of other people."</p>

  <p>Too nonplussed even to be enraged, Tubby considered this shocking audacity
  with a perplexed stare, and presently remarked, "I suppose you are trying to
  tell me, first, that I have no respect for other people's rights; in other
  words, a bully. In the next place, you assume that the bully will save
  himself, in a pinch, which implies that he is a coward. So&mdash;you do think
  I am a coward, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know, sir," replied Audrey, thoughtfully. "But&mdash;I am verree
  much interested in this adventure."</p>

  <p>"With a coward!" insisted Tubby, bitterly.</p>

  <p>"My Chinese foster-father&mdash;"</p>

  <p><i>"Damn</i> your Chinese foster-father!" shouted Tubby, thoroughly
  exasperated. For the next half-mile the dial showed fifty-five; then
  retreated gradually to forty. "Well&mdash;" barked Tubby. "Go on! Say it!
  What about your precious Chinese foster-father?"</p>

  <p>"He frequently remarked," said Audrey, ignoring Tubby's outburst, "that
  many a man never finds out whether he is brave or cowardly&mdash;at heart.
  May-bee nothing ever happens to put him on trial. May-bee he goes for a long,
  long time, thinking himself very big and strong because he makes others do
  his will. And then something happens, over which he has no command. He
  shouts, 'Halt!' But the other man keeps coming on as if he had not heard...
  . My foster-father said it is always dangerous to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes!" cut in Tubby. "You said that before. It's always dangerous to
  get in a scrape in the company of a bully. He would undoubtedly run off and
  let you take the beating. I'm a bully&mdash;and a coward&mdash;and you're
  scared. I get your point. It was very delicately stated&mdash;but I get it....
 But&mdash;who told you I am a bully? You don't know me. I haven't bullied
  you, have I? Did Beaven say that about me? Or was it Cunningham?...
  Proceed, please: you're so candid. Let's have it all!"</p>

  <p>"I should not have said what I did, Dr Forrester," Audrey's tone was
  genuinely contrite. "It was verree rude, I fear. I beg your pardon."</p>

  <p>"But that does not answer my question! Did Beaven give you the impression
  that I try to impose my will on other people?"</p>

  <p>"Why should he?" countered Audrey. "Would Jack have some reason for saying
  that, may-bee?"</p>

  <p>"Beaven doesn't understand&mdash;at all," blustered Tubby. "What I have
  done for him has been for his own good&mdash;and he ought to know it." He
  turned toward her accusingly. "I suppose you think I was assuming control of
  his affairs in the advice I gave you at dinner."</p>

  <p>"I accepted the advice: is it not so?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Tubby, doubtfully, "it appeared to be so, at the moment. You
  were giving him up. And that was a definite promise! But here you
  are&mdash;on the way to him."</p>

  <p>"I shall keep my promise," replied Audrey. "I told you I would go back to
  China. You need not fear. I mean to do so. But&mdash;I had to go to him in
  this emergency. It would have been verree cruel to have refused me. Even
  <i>you</i> would know that."</p>

  <p>Tubby winced, and might have replied, but the asphalt had suddenly changed
  to brick and the street-lights of little Wheaton were rapidly coming to meet
  them. It wouldn't be long now. The time had passed for accusations and
  reprisals. Tubby slowed to thirty and began peering out for identifiable
  landmarks.</p>

  <p>"There it is," he mumbled, angling toward the right curb. "I hope you know
  enough to keep yourself out of sight while I go up to the entrance."</p>

  <p>"It is much better that I should go," said Audrey. "They will be less
  suspicious if they see you have a woman with you."</p>

  <p>"Very silly reasoning," said Tubby. "Why should we want to create the
  impression that we are defenceless?"</p>

  <p>"What we want," replied Audrey, firmly, "is the information that will lead
  us to Jack. Is it not so? If these people feel sure that we have not come to
  capture them, they may return with the directions."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;maybe so," conceded Tubby. He delved into an inside
  coat-pocket and brought up a long envelope. "Here's the money. You know,
  don't you, that you are taking a grave risk?"</p>

  <p>She made no reply to that. When the coupé came to a stop he quickly opened
  the door and Audrey started toward the high-school steps. Her heart was
  pounding hard and her throat was dry. The new snow showed recent footprints.
  The surgeon's satchel was not in sight. The large open vestibule was
  cavernous and dark. She stood for an instant on the top step, resolutely
  consolidating her resources; then proceeded with trembling knees into the
  deep shadows. On the stone doorstep she found the empty leather bag; drew a
  quick breath of relief, deposited the envelope, and retraced her steps to the
  street. Tubby was holding the car door ajar for her.</p>

  <p>"Find it?" he asked, anxiously, as she stepped in beside him.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and now you should drive away quickly, as they said."</p>

  <p>Tubby pulled out toward the middle of the street and proceeded toward the
  business district of the town.</p>

  <p>"I should not do that if I were you," advised Audrey. "If they are
  watching they may think you are going down to notify the police. Why not turn
  up this side street and wait?"</p>

  <p>This sounded sensible enough, so Tubby followed her counsel without
  comment, somewhat to Audrey's surprise. Slowing the car, they crept along for
  a couple of blocks, parking in front of a house that showed no lights. For a
  long time they sat there in silence. Tubby could not remember that he had
  ever before heard the ticking of the clock on the instrument-board. Doubtless
  the ticking was always audible if one gave attention, but he had never
  noticed it. After three minutes had dragged by, Audrey slipped over a little
  closer to Tubby and drew half the robe across his knees. He accepted it
  mechanically, muttering a reluctant "Very well". The robe warmed him
  instantly, a strangely comforting warmth that she had invested in it. He was
  warmed, too, by the gracious act&mdash;and her implied confidence. She had
  professed a fear that he might not protect her: too selfish to take a risk
  for anyone but himself. Tubby felt now that she didn't think that, at all. It
  relieved him a little.</p>

  <p>"Do you think we can take him back with us in your car?" asked Audrey,
  barely above a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Depends on his condition." Tubby's tone was respectful. "If he is
  conscious; no serious hæmorrhage; no fractures&mdash;perhaps we might. We
  will see."</p>

  <p>There was another long silence.</p>

  <p>"Thirteen," murmured Audrey.</p>

  <p>Tubby pushed aside the robe.</p>

  <p>"May as well go," he said. "It will take two minutes. Time may be
  precious."</p>

  <p>Again they found themselves at the curb in front of the high-school.
  Audrey laid her hand on the door-latch and Tubby made no remonstrance. This
  time she ran toward the building and up the steps. She was not afraid now,
  but almost desperate with anxiety. Perhaps the people had not left the
  directions. Jack's instrument kit was on the doorstep. Audrey's heart stopped
  while she groped in the open bag. The envelope she had deposited was still
  there, but had been opened. It was crumpled and the money was gone. Utterly
  sick with disappointment and anxiety, she returned to the car with the empty
  satchel in one hand and the empty envelope in the other.</p>

  <p>Under the street-light she paused to inspect the envelope. Her heart
  bounded. There was a brief message written on the back with a lead pencil. It
  was not very good writing, but plainly decipherable.</p>

  <p>"Your man," said the note, "is in a house about seven miles from here.
  Drive west on highway through town and one mile. Turn left at Larsen Dairy
  Farm. Carry on five miles gravel. South one mile of mud. House far back from
  road at end of lane. Your lights will show where cars have turned around. The
  doctor's head is very bad. He is bleeding. You must hurry. We did not mean to
  hurt him so much. It was an accident. Don't try to follow us or there might
  be another one."</p>

  <p>Tubby held the door open and Audrey joined him.</p>

  <p>"Drive straight on," she said, "while I read this to you." She held the
  paper close to the dim light on the instrument-board. Tubby made no comment,
  but pushed up the speed. They went through Wheaton at fifty, but it was a
  stormy night and no one seemed to care.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>There was no one to warn Tubby that the lane was practically impassable.
  The old wooden gate stood partly open. Leaving the engine running, he stepped
  out gingerly into the muddy snow and added his footprints to those revealed
  by his flashlight. Dragging the gate aside, he returned to the car and drove
  into the worst road he had ever encountered. Feeling his way cautiously in
  low gear from one enormous mud-hole to the next, he presently sighted a dim
  light in a window.</p>

  <p>Audrey did not wait for him. When the coupé stopped she leaped out and ran
  through the tangle of unkempt shrubbery to the house, opened the door into a
  dark cold hall, and followed the faint gleam. And there Tubby found her a
  moment later, down on her knees, peering into Jack's white face. He handed
  her the flashlight and knelt beside her, laid the backs of his fingers
  against Jack's cheek for an instant, unbuttoned his waistcoat, felt his
  heart.</p>

  <p>Deftly spreading the unconscious eyes wide open, Tubby muttered, "Hold
  that light closer. No&mdash;throw it into his face; not mine. There. That's
  it. Steady, please." Then, with one hand supporting Jack's neck, he raised
  his head slightly and inspected the wound. It was still bleeding, but not
  dangerously.</p>

  <p>"Will you want hot water?" asked Audrey. "The stove is warm."</p>

  <p>Tubby was rummaging in his bag.</p>

  <p>"No," he decided. "I shall do nothing but a simple bandage. There's a very
  serious concussion here."</p>

  <p>Audrey leaned forward, her face working convulsively, and the tears
  running down her cheeks. She searched Tubby's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Is he&mdash;is he going to die?" she asked, in a frightened whisper.</p>

  <p>Tubby did not reply. For a long moment he seemed indecisive about his
  procedure; then got out his stethoscope and listened with his eyes closed and
  his mouth open, Audrey watching the strained expression on his lips, her own
  heart pounding so hard she could feel it in her throat. Tubby drew a long,
  painful sigh and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Can we take him with us?" asked Audrey, brokenly.</p>

  <p>"I'll call the ambulance," said Tubby. "I don't suppose there is a
  telephone. Take that lamp, and look about."</p>

  <p>Audrey obeyed. Tubby heard her moving about from one room to another;
  noted, through the open door, that she was starting up the stairs.</p>

  <p>"You come back here!" he demanded; then added, less gruffly, "You don't
  know what you might run into up there." She put the lamp on a chair and knelt
  down beside him again. "It wouldn't be up there, anyhow," he said, not
  unkindly.... "I thought you said you were afraid."</p>

  <p>"Not now," she answered, dully&mdash;"except for him.... Oh, I wish I
  could drive the car. I should go somewhere and telephone."</p>

  <p>"You're not afraid to stay here while I go?"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" she declared. "But&mdash;what if something should happen to Jack
  while you are gone? I should not know what to do."</p>

  <p>"There's only one thing that can happen to him," said Tubby, "and you will
  be able to do as much for him as anyone&mdash;when that happens." He rose and
  buttoned his coat. "I'll be back as soon as possible. Don't move him. Don't
  touch him."</p>

  <p>"It seems awful," she cried, "to let him lie here with his poor hurt head
  on this bare floor."</p>

  <p>"I know," agreed Tubby, "but the way he is lying now there is no pressure.
  There might be, if he had a pillow. This wound is very sensitive. Let him
  be."</p>

  <p>Audrey's eyes followed Tubby as he moved toward the door.</p>

  <p>"If he wakes up, is there not anything I should do for him?" she asked,
  shaking her head a little as if anticipating a negative reply.</p>

  <p>"He will not wake up," said Tubby, soberly.</p>

  <p>"Never?" Audrey asked the question with her lips rather than her
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Not until that pressure is lifted."</p>

  <p>"And then&mdash;he will surely wake up!" she entreated. "Is it not
  so?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so." Tubby's voice lacked assurance. "Can't tell anything about it
  until we get in there." He retraced his steps to her. "Here&mdash;keep this
  flashlight. That lamp is fixing to go out. The oil is almost gone."</p>

  <p>"But you will need the light to find your way," protested Audrey. "May-bee
  there is some oil in the house."</p>

  <p>They joined in a hunt through the scantily furnished kitchen and the small
  pantry, finding the oil-can empty.</p>

  <p>"It is no matter," said Audrey, in a spent voice. "I shall be all right.
  Take the flashlight&mdash;and hurry."</p>

  <p>She was down on the floor again beside Jack, sitting upright,
  cross-legged, this time. Tubby tarried at the door, tugging on his gloves.
  She glanced up at him over her shoulder. For a long moment he looked steadily
  into her eyes, and seemed about to say something more; some word of regret,
  perhaps, that he must leave her there alone; some expression of approval,
  maybe. Whatever it was, Audrey divined that it carried at least a trace of
  sympathy for her. She receipted it with a little nod of her head and a
  fleeting wisp of pensive smile, as if she were thinking, "Poor Tubbee". When
  he had closed the door she heard him climb the stairs. After a moment he came
  down again. She heard the big motor roar. Tubby was on his way. Studying
  Jack's impassive face, she felt it was quite too much to expect that they
  could save him. Her loneliness and loss suddenly swept all of her courage
  away. Burying her face in her arms, she shook her head hopelessly&mdash;and
  sobbed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jack!" she whispered. "I cannot bear it! Oh&mdash;my beloved!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>After a while, the racking sobs subsided and she sat there, swollen-eyed,
  dejected, exhausted, dully waiting. Tubby had said she mustn't touch Jack,
  but surely it would do no hurt to lay her hand lightly in his open palm. It
  seemed strange not to feel those strong fingers tighten warmly. He was so
  very far away. Perhaps he would never be back. Tubby thought that, she
  knew.</p>

  <p>Tubby had commanded her to go back to China, so Jack could do his work
  undisturbed by all the cares she would have heaped upon him. And she had
  promised to do that. And now it had turned out that she would not have to go
  away, for it was Jack who would be going away. Well&mdash;she would return to
  China, in any event. If Jack lived, she would go promptly, as Tubby had
  insisted. If Jack died, she would need the sustaining sympathy of her
  father's house.</p>

  <p>The reeking lamp had begun to sputter ominously. Audrey weakly rose to her
  feet, inspected it critically, shook it a little, lowered the wick. Then she
  carried it to the table by the window where they had found it. Perhaps it
  should be left there. If it did not go out before Tubby returned it might aid
  him in locating the house. She glanced at the grimy, cobwebbed window,
  wondering how she could clean the long-neglected dust, and saw something that
  froze her to the spot with one grip of paralysing horror. Her heart stood
  still and her breathing was suspended.</p>

  <p>Transfixed with terror, she found herself staring into a pair of eyes. For
  a long moment she stood there unable to move. The eyes did not waver. They
  were weary, haggard, beaten, desperate eyes.</p>

  <p>Presently they vanished in the darkness. Audrey turned dizzily and leaned
  back against the table, fearing for a moment that she was going to faint. The
  vertigo passed, and there was a long interval in which she waited with every
  sense alert, tensely expectant. Then the front door latch rattled and there
  were heavy footsteps in the little hall. Audrey pressed her knuckles hard
  against her mouth and stared at the closed door. It slowly opened and a man
  entered, half staggered into the room, and slumped down on a chair. He was
  somewhat under average height and appeared far from well, though that might
  have been accounted for by his quite obvious fatigue. He was shabbily
  dressed, wet with snow, his feet and legs caked with mud. He paid no
  attention to her; and, after a minute of recovery, Audrey, feeling that she
  had little to fear from this intruder, walked slowly toward him. She was
  still weak and shaken, but the terror was gone.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" she inquired quietly. "Is this your house?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head without looking up.</p>

  <p>"Are you ill?" asked Audrey.</p>

  <p>"Tired." The word was feebly exploded as the tag end of a wheezy breath.
  Then he drew a long sigh and straightened his shoulders a little. "I have
  been running," he croaked. "Have you any whisky, lady?"</p>

  <p>Audrey was sorree but there was no whisky. The man slumped forward again,
  head hanging, arms dangling. Within a few feet of him lay Jack's unconscious
  figure, but he had exhibited no surprise; knew all about it, doubtless; had
  been in the fight, perhaps. It was clear now that he intended no harm to her,
  and her heart beat more steadily. She returned to Jack's side, knelt, lightly
  trailed her fingers across his arm. The stranger coughed painfully, and
  Audrey glanced up at him.</p>

  <p>"Billows did phone, then," he muttered. "Where's old Doc Forrester?"</p>

  <p>"Telephoning for the ambulance," said Audrey. "How much do you know about
  this?"</p>

  <p>"I was brought here by a couple of fellows who wanted to get me out of the
  way, so I couldn't testify against them."</p>

  <p>"In that water-pipe trouble, I think," said Audrey. "You are Mr Buckley:
  is it not so?"</p>

  <p>Thomas gave a little start. After a moment's hesitation he nodded; and
  having revealed his identity he proceeded to tell the story.</p>

  <p>"They must have had you tied up," reflected Audrey, "or you would have
  helped Dr Beaven when they attacked him."</p>

  <p>Thomas winced a little and made haste to explain how quickly the fight had
  begun and ended. He'd hardly realized what was happening until it was
  over.</p>

  <p>"They tried to scare him, but Doc isn't scary. I guess you know that."
  Thomas gave Audrey a frankly appraising look. "Mebby you're his girl.
  Leastways you don't look like a nurse. You probably know that Doc couldn't be
  bluffed or ordered around. Well&mdash;Billows and Rusty made a lot of big
  talk about what they'd do to him and before they had a chance to put up their
  dukes the fight was goin' on. Doc was lettin' 'em have it&mdash;hard. Then,
  when he was finishin' off the work on Rusty, Billows picked up this chair and
  socked him on the head. He just went down like a beef. Then they were scared.
  Billows said he would phone to town for a doctor. Rusty and me said we'd wait
  a while. Then we found that Billows had stolen Doc's medicine-bag. We figured
  he wasn't intendin' to phone. So&mdash;we got out. I felt terrible bad about
  leavin' him, but Rusty was goin'&mdash;and I couldn't stay here&mdash;by
  myself. Down at Angus, about five miles south, we stopped for gas, and I got
  out and ran."</p>

  <p>"Intending to come all the way back here," asked Audrey, "and give
  yourself up? Something must have happened&mdash;to change your mind."</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;that's right. It was sumpin' Rusty said, just before we got to
  Angus." Thomas was hesitant, but Audrey encouraged him with inquiring eyes
  and a deeply interested "Yes?"</p>

  <p>"You see&mdash;it was like this, lady. We weren't more 'n' started till I
  was sorry we'd left, and I told Rusty that Doc had been good to me."</p>

  <p>"Treating your little girl, may-bee?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;more 'n' that. I'd complained a good deal about the docs and
  the nurses, and one day Doc here took me up to his workshop and give me a
  talk. I guess you know&mdash;if you're his girl&mdash;that there ain't much
  foolishness about him. We got to talkin' about this infantile paralysis, and
  he questioned me too close, so I thought I'd better blow while he was at the
  phone. He didn't catch up with me till I was down on the lower floor. Then he
  collared me and dragged me back up there. I guess you know he could do it,
  all right. He's pretty hard, you know. You wouldn't think, to look at him,
  that Doc was interested in anything except takin' people apart and puttin'
  'em together again.... Well&mdash;after he was done with me, he took me
  down town and made me eat supper with him. I was hungry, too."</p>

  <p>Audrey's eyes had brightened. She sat there, with parted lips, gently
  caressing Jack's hand, intent on Buckley's narrative.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;this was on my mind, so I was tellin' Rusty about it, and he
  said he was ashamed to be in the same car with me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And then, I think," commented Audrey, "you decided to come back."</p>

  <p>"I thought, lady, that if I'd got so low that a bum and jail-bird like
  Rusty was ashamed o' me, I'd have to do something about it&mdash;or
  else&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think, Mr Buckley," said Audrey, gently, "you did the right thing. You
  were afraid to come back&mdash;but you came. That is verree brave."</p>

  <p>Thomas squared his shoulders a little and grinned shyly.</p>

  <p>"Mebbe I can fix up that fire," he said. Crossing to the rusty stove he
  poked noisily at the embers, went outside, and came back with a few sticks of
  snowy wood. With this attended to, he resumed his chair. There was a long
  silence punctuated by the crackling of the reviving fire. After a while,
  Thomas said, "Were you scared when you saw me through the window?"</p>

  <p>"Horribly!" confessed Audrey, with a shudder.</p>

  <p>"Then you are brave too," said Thomas, willing to share his honours.</p>

  <p>"Not like you, Mr Buckley," Audrey conceded. "I did not run, because I had
  to stay here. There was nothing else to do. But you had escaped danger and
  came back into it, of your own accord. When Dr Beaven learns of this, he will
  be glad to have had such a good friend."</p>

  <p>Thomas, much improved in mind, rose, approached; and, hands on knees,
  stooped over to inspect Jack's face. The light, which had lately grown
  dimmer, now sputtered out completely. In a steady voice Audrey said, "Be
  careful, now! He must not be touched! Better sit down."</p>

  <p>Suddenly a flash lit the east window. Neither spoke. Presently they heard
  a motor slowly grinding an approach through the muddy lane.</p>

  <p>"Mebbe I'd better open the door for him," said Thomas.</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are!" commanded Audrey. "That will be much safer."</p>

  <p>Tubby was opening the front door now. Then the flashlight was thrown into
  the room.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right?" called Tubby, anxiously. "How's Beaven? Who is this
  man?" He stopped to scowl severely at Thomas. "Are you the fellow who
  telephoned?"</p>

  <p>"Mr Buckley escaped from the men who hurt Jack," explained Audrey. "He
  walked back&mdash;five miles&mdash;to see what he could do."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" grunted Tubby. He gave Thomas another inquiring scowl and knelt
  down by Audrey. "The ambulance will be here almost any minute now," he
  reported, with satisfaction. "They drive very fast." He unlimbered his
  stethoscope. "Here&mdash;hold this," he commanded, handing her the
  flashlight. For a long minute he listened to Jack's heart. Then, easing
  himself into a more comfortable position on the floor, he said,
  "Well&mdash;he's hanging on."</p>

  <p>"You are&mdash;just a little more hopeful?" pleaded Audrey, her face
  upraised to Tubby's.</p>

  <p>"While there's life," he answered.</p>

  <p>She caught at Tubby's words, interpreting them as a faint glimmer of
  encouragement. Jack was hanging on. A strange feeling of lassitude began to
  sweep over her. She realized how very tired she was. The long, agonizing
  strain, the fear of the dark, the paralysing fright at the window, the
  anxiety and grief: it had all been too much. The tension had been too tight.
  Gradually she felt herself drifting. Jack was hanging on&mdash;but she was
  letting go. Slowly her head bent forward and she sagged limply, quite
  powerless to exert her will.</p>

  <p>Tubby, instantly recognizing this slump for what it was, caught her with
  his arm and drew her back roughly.</p>

  <p>"Here!&mdash;None of <i>that!"</i> he shouted, hoping to shock her back to
  consciousness. But she had quite let go. Supporting her with his arm Tubby
  rummaged in his kit for a restorative. Then he became aware that this muddy
  Buckley had left his chair and was leaning over him with a menacing look. It
  occurred to him that Buckley had misunderstood his sharp command to the
  fainting girl, and thought she was being mistreated. Saturating his
  handkerchief with ammonia, Tubby held it close to the white face that lay
  against his breast. Buckley, satisfied that his services were not needed for
  her defence, shuffled back to his chair.</p>

  <p>After a few involuntary breaths of the pungent spirits, Audrey stirred and
  made a futile effort to sit up. Tubby held her where she was, drawing her
  close.</p>

  <p>"S-s-still," he whispered, soothingly. "You will be all right in a
  minute." But it was a long minute before she stirred again.</p>

  <p>"Sorree," she murmured, lifting her head and drawing a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>"Better now?" rasped Tubby, severely professional.</p>

  <p>She rubbed the back of her wrist against her forehead, bewilderedly, and
  sat up; then turned to Tubby with a penitent little smile.</p>

  <p>"You were right," she said, thickly. "I am only a bother."</p>

  <p>Tubby cleared his throat noisily.</p>

  <p>"Bother?" he barked. "Nonsense! Who said you were a bother?"</p>

  <p>They sat together in silence for a little while, Audrey gently stroking
  Jack's unresponsive fingers.</p>

  <p>"Through with that handkerchief?" growled Tubby. She passed it to him
  without turning her head from her brooding concentration on Jack's drawn
  face. "I wasn't quite satisfied with the man on emergency duty to-night,"
  said Tubby. "Fellow named Abbott. Capable fellow, I suppose, but he's
  Chinese. I'd rather he were a white man."</p>

  <p>"I think Jack would be glad," replied Audrey, "if Dr Abbott came out for
  him. They are good friends. I do not think his being Chinese would offend
  Jack."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," remarked Tubby, stiffly. "Especially when he's unconscious.
  But&mdash;all the same&mdash;I told Abbott he'd better bring a regularly
  qualified surgeon along."</p>

  <p>Audrey nodded her head, as if agreeable to anything that Tubby thought
  wise. Suddenly she straightened; listened; held up her hand. Then Tubby heard
  it, too; the short, sharp, peremptory siren-blast. A burst of light splashed
  against the window. The ambulance was toiling up the lane. Buckley went out.
  Tubby followed. Audrey sat still, her heart pounding hard. They had come for
  him. It wouldn't be very long now until&mdash;until she would know whether
  she would have to go away&mdash;or Jack.</p>

  <p>Tubby came in first, holding the door open; then a young
  chap&mdash;presumably the driver&mdash;carrying the front end of a stretcher;
  on the other end of the stretcher was Abbot in a white uniform; and, behind
  Abbott&mdash;to Audrey's immeasurable relief and joy&mdash;Dr Cunningham! And
  how amazed he was to find her there! He made no comment, but his eyes were
  wide with astonishment.</p>

  <p>They put the stretcher down beside Jack, and the driver set a big
  flashlight on a chair.</p>

  <p>"Want to examine him?" asked Tubby.</p>

  <p>"No, no," said Cunningham. "You've done that. How's he making it? Pulse
  fairly good? Stand the trip, all right?"</p>

  <p>"He is holding his own pretty well," said Tubby. "You want to be very
  careful. It's a bad fracture."</p>

  <p>"Right. Well&mdash;let's go." Cunningham surveyed the little crew. "I
  suggest that Miss Hilton and Abbot ride in the ambulance. I shall come along
  in Dr Forrester's car, if that's agreeable. Who's this other fellow?" he
  asked, lowering his voice.</p>

  <p>"Needn't bother about him," said Tubby. "He's a bum that was held prisoner
  here by the hoodlums that did this."</p>

  <p>"We'll take him along," said Cunningham. Thomas was leaning against the
  wall, waiting to learn what disposition was to be made of him. "What's your
  name?" Cunningham moved toward him and stared into his face.</p>

  <p>"Buckley, sir."</p>

  <p>"Good! I know about you. Dr Beaven told me.... There will be room in
  your car for the three of us, I think, Dr Forrester."</p>

  <p>Tubby said he supposed so, though the tone of the invitation was not
  hearty.</p>

  <p>"And then you'll turn me over to the cops," grumbled Buckley.</p>

  <p>"Maybe not," said Cunningham. "Not unless they ask for you, Thomas. We're
  your friends. Better stick with us. If you have to take some nasty medicine,
  you'll take it, I think. The fact that you're here, when you might have run
  off, shows that you're all right. Now you keep on playing the game straight.
  O.K.?"</p>

  <p>Audrey had retreated, out of the way. She had expected that Tubby would be
  barking orders and arranging the trip; but, without any effrontery, Dr
  Cunningham had calmly taken charge of everything. And it seemed so soundly
  right that he should do so. Tubby was not resenting it; was welcoming it,
  apparently.</p>

  <p>With the caution of experience, they eased Jack on to the stretcher, and
  filed out of the room, Tubby and Audrey bringing up the rear.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're much gratified," said Tubby, crisply, "that Dr
  Cunningham is here."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;yes!" murmured Audrey, thankfully. "So glad! He is wonderful! So
  kind!"</p>

  <p>Tubby picked up the big flashlight from the chair. He was standing
  directly in her way. And now he detained her with an outspread hand.</p>

  <p>"This is none of your business, at all, Miss Hilton, and we will decide
  the matter ourselves; but&mdash;I am curious to know&mdash;would you prefer
  Dr Cunningham to do this operation&mdash;seeing he is so wonderful&mdash;and
  so kind?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;<i>no!"</i> Audrey looked up into Tubby's face, wide-eyed with
  apprehensiveness, shaking her head. <i>"You</i> must do the operation!
  Oh&mdash;please!" She laid her hand on his arm entreatingly. "We must save
  him!" Hot tears were racing down her cheeks. "Oh&mdash;I know that Jack would
  say there is nobody in the world who could do it so well&mdash;as you!
  Oh&mdash;please!"</p>

  <p>"Button your coat!" growled Tubby. "I suppose your feet are soaking wet.
  When we get back to the hospital, I'm going to put you to bed!"</p>

  <p>"Not until we know how Jack comes through the operation," said Audrey,
  firmly.</p>

  <p>Tubby frowned, and motioned her to precede him. She tarried for an
  instant, and said, very seriously, "Don't worry, Dr Forrester. I think your
  skill can pull him through. And then&mdash;I shall keep my promise. You need
  have no fear. <i>You save him</i>&mdash;<i>and I'll go!"</i></p>

  <p>Had she been a princess, Tubby's bow could not have been more deferential.
  He took off his hard hat to accomplish it. Then, stalking stiffly behind her,
  his shoulders squared, he lighted their way toward the lane.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AT quarter after four Warren slipped out quietly into the
  corridor and started for the kitchen. Abbott was still hovering outside the
  door but did not detain her with queries. Dr and Mrs Cunningham, who were
  sitting with Dr Shane in the alcove near the floor supervisor's desk, glanced
  up as she passed; but Warren merely shook her head as to say there was
  nothing to report, and the three of them resumed their low-voiced
  conversation.</p>

  <p>In the kitchen she helped herself to a cup of hot bouillon and prepared a
  tray of it for six. Returning, Warren paused to serve the group in the alcove
  and poor Abbott who, she thought, should at least find himself a chair if he
  proposed to wait there the rest of the night. He pushed the door open for her
  and held it until she had entered.</p>

  <p>Audrey Hilton, seated near the foot of the bed, accepted her cup with an
  appreciative but very weary little smile. Tubby did not bother even to turn
  his tousled grey head. Warren put down the tray; and, crossing to her seat in
  the corner by the window, resumed her deliberate appraisal of Tubby's
  profile.</p>

  <p>She had worked with him closely for more than six years, but this was the
  first time she had ever seen the chief completely off guard and indifferent
  to his appearance. It was a rare thing, after an operation, for Tubby to show
  up in a patient's room until ample time had elapsed for the anæsthesia to
  clear, and when he came he would be coolly dignified and starchily spruce.
  Warren surveyed this dishevelled stranger with unabashed and unobserved
  curiosity. It was difficult to identify as the smartly self-sufficient
  Forrester this pouchy-eyed old man who sagged astride the straight-backed
  chair staring at the flushed face on the pillow.</p>

  <p>Still in his surgical togs, minus only the cap, mask, and gloves, the long
  white gown absurdly drawn up in an untidy bunch across his legs and gaping
  down the back between the straining tapes, his bare arms folded on the top of
  the chair, Tubby sat immobile except for the regularly spaced jerk of his
  shoulders at the beginning of each measured inhalation&mdash;a little jerk
  with a heart-kick in it, as if he had been winded from running up a long
  hill.</p>

  <p>The whole affair, Warren felt, was crowded with drama. Some of it was
  obvious enough and duly accounted for; most of it needed explanation. Of
  course everybody knew that Tubby and Beaven were hopelessly at odds and had
  been so for years. It was such an old story that the hospital no longer had
  any interest in it. You just took it for granted: and so had they,
  apparently. It didn't seem odd that Tubby had performed the operation.
  Perhaps it might have if it had been a mere stomach incision or some other
  simple thing that almost anyone could have done alone in the dark; but this
  terrific skull-fracture was directly in Tubby's exclusive alley. It was
  unthinkable that anybody else on the surgical staff should have attempted it
  if Tubby was available. But&mdash;all the same&mdash;it did give you the
  shivers to watch Tubby boring a hole in Beaven's head when you remembered the
  way they had always scowled at each other across this very table.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Tubby would be keen on insuring the success of this operation.
  The animosity between him and Beaven, far from making him indifferent toward
  this job, would furnish an added reason why he should give it the best he
  had. It would have been a shocking scandal if the report ever breezed about
  that Tubby hadn't gone to much pains to save Beaven's life. Indeed the chief
  was taking a pretty heavy risk, no matter how much skill he exercised. If
  Beaven didn't come through&mdash;and nobody believed he was going
  to&mdash;there were plenty of people connected with that hospital who would
  wag their heads meaningly, even if they didn't express an opinion.</p>

  <p>Warren's eyes widened a little at this reflection. Perhaps it explained
  something that had occurred in the operating-room. The seven of them had
  gathered about the table waiting for the anæsthesia to settle in&mdash;and
  that was a tricky job, too&mdash;and just as Carson nodded that he was ready,
  Tubby had cleared his throat and said, very impressively,
  <i>"This</i>&mdash;<i>must not</i>&mdash;<i>go wrong!"</i></p>

  <p>That was the reason, then, why the operation must not go wrong. Tubby
  couldn't afford to have it hinted that he had done a slack job on a colleague
  he despised. But&mdash;and Warren's eyes narrowed again as she studied
  Tubby's drawn face&mdash;that theory wasn't so good, after all. Now that old
  Tubby had done his very best&mdash;and she had overheard Shane saying to
  Cunningham that it was the most brilliant piece of surgery he had ever
  witnessed, to which Cunningham had solemnly agreed&mdash;there was no reason
  why the chief should sit here like a stone statue, tuning his own breathing
  to the laboured respiration of his patient.</p>

  <p>Maybe, speculated Warren, he was smitten with remorse over the way he had
  mistreated Beaven. But no&mdash;that didn't quite fill the order: there was
  something other than remorse in Tubby's anxious eyes. He was genuinely
  concerned. Wouldn't it be funny if, underneath all the nagging and surliness,
  he had secretly liked Beaven, but had been too pompous and cantankerous to
  admit it. Tubby had been hard hit: anyone could see that. He had the agonized
  this-is-the-end-of-the-world look that you saw sometimes on the face of a
  young husband or a doting father.</p>

  <p>Warren's eyes shifted from Tubby to the beautiful Hilton girl. She had not
  seen her since the days when the bright little nephew had been here, oddly
  insisting that his auntie was Chinese&mdash;and sometimes she had certainly
  looked it, too, though she didn't now. Warren remembered that she had
  wondered, at the time, if Beaven wasn't uncommonly interested in this
  mysterious, petite, but lovely brunette, with the straight blue-black bangs
  and the foreignish manner of speaking. There was that night she had put in a
  late call for him and found him at the Livingstone Hotel: this girl had
  answered the telephone. Warren's lips curved slightly in an understanding
  grin. Apparently Beaven had stolen a march on them; had made love to the girl
  right under their very noses without stirring a bit of talk&mdash;no small
  feat, that.</p>

  <p>Well&mdash;he had done a good job of love-making: you could see that at a
  glance. The Hilton girl hadn't been a bit hysterical; but she, too, had that
  end-of-my-world look in her long-lashed brooding eyes. Ever since they had
  brought Beaven down from the operating-room at half-past one, she had sat
  there hardly moving a muscle, her small white hands folded flatly under her
  high breasts&mdash;just like the quaint pictures you saw of Chinese women.
  Occasionally her eyes drifted slowly over to Tubby, but she had not spoken to
  him, nor had he taken the slightest notice of her. This, too, was queer
  enough; for, according to the story, they had driven out into the country
  together when the news came of Beaven's injury. If they were thick enough to
  have been at the same place, that late in the evening, you would think they
  were friends.</p>

  <p>This, Warren felt, deserved a large basketful of explanation; and, having
  nothing else to do for the moment, she put her imagination to work on it.
  First off, she reflected, you have to remember that Tubby and Beaven have
  nothing whatever to do with each other. Then you have to keep in mind that
  Beaven and the girl are deeply in love. Naturally, the girl feels that Tubby
  is her enemy. Yet when something happens to Beaven, Tubby and Audrey Hilton
  set forth to the rescue in the chief's car&mdash;which doesn't make sense.
  And, supposing you cleared that up, why had they sat here for three
  hours&mdash;within a few feet of each other, without exchanging a word or a
  glance?</p>

  <p>Studying the girl's tragic face, Warren noted a sudden change. The weary
  eyes widened, the lips parted. At the same instant, Tubby's back stiffened.
  Then Beaven's rhythmic, bellows-like respiration skipped a stroke; and, after
  a momentary delay, was resumed with a long deep sigh, exhaled in a
  half-articulate "Oh-h-h", as if there were a faint glimmer of consciousness
  behind it. She stepped to the bedside, Tubby at her elbow. Audrey Hilton had
  come to her feet and was holding hard to the round foot-rail with tense
  hands. Tubby had whipped out his stethoscope and was leaning over the bed
  listening intently. Then the Hilton girl came around beside him, leaning
  close against him as if she might hear something too. When Tubby
  straightened, she looked up from fairly under his elbow, and asked, eagerly,
  "Does that mean anything&mdash;that longer breath?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Tubby, studying her face almost as if he had never seen her
  before, "it means that he is recovering consciousness."</p>

  <p>If Warren had found the problem of this relationship interesting and
  perplexing, now she gave it up completely; for the girl, upon learning the
  good news, pressed her forehead against Tubby's big bare arm&mdash;as if she
  were his daughter&mdash;and murmured thickly, <i>"Oh&mdash;dear God!"</i></p>

  <p>Occupied for a little while with her patient, moistening his parched lips
  with ice, Warren had turned away from this baffling scene. She hoped Tubby
  had been humane enough to put his arm about her, for it was easy to see that
  the girl had had about all she could take, and needed only this sudden
  relief, to unbuckle her into utter collapse. But when she glanced at them,
  they were still standing there as they were. Warren glimpsed Tubby's face and
  couldn't help staring, though she felt she had no right to. He had made no
  move to comfort the girl, who clung to his arm with her face pressed hard
  against it, but his grey head was bent and he was looking down on her with an
  expression of helpless pity. His face was grotesquely contorted. Warren knew
  she should turn away, but the strange sight held her hypnotized. Then the
  girl pulled herself together and walked unsteadily to the window, staring out
  into the darkness. Tubby mumbled an order to Warren; sat down wearily, drew a
  long sigh; and, leaning far forward, dug his finger-tips hard into his
  temples. Warren went to the door, then, and told Abbott that Dr Beaven was
  coming out. And Abbott, bowing, glided effortlessly down the corridor to tell
  the others. Trailing him, Warren stopped at the floor-supervisor's desk and
  gave her Tubby's message which she telephoned to the office. Mrs Cunningham,
  overhearing, said, "That's very thoughtful."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>When they had arrived at the ambulance entrance everybody had gone quickly
  about his business with no thought for Thomas who, having no business there
  at all, was uncertain about his next move.</p>

  <p>Something told him the sensible thing was to go home. It would be safe
  enough, and he was very tired. But he couldn't quite bring himself to this
  prudent decision. His cold feet and hot lungs entreated him, but it had been
  the most eventful night of his life and he disliked the thought of bringing
  it to so drab a conclusion. Besides, he was sincerely concerned about Beaven
  whose immediate operation would probably determine whether he was to live or
  die.</p>

  <p>Thomas had had a wonderful experience; a whole string of wonderful
  experiences packed into the space of a few hours. Unexpectedly he had been
  served with generous helpings of praise; and, unaccustomed to the heady
  ambrosia on which heroes are nourished, he was more than a little
  intoxicated. Ordinarily sullen and sore in the company of his betters, he had
  blossomed under the warming commendations he had earned. It wasn't simply
  that he had come back, at considerable risk, to make sure that Beaven was
  cared for: he had managed to say the right thing, later, to Doc
  Cunningham.</p>

  <p>For the first few minutes of that swift ride back to town, tailing the red
  lights of the fleeing ambulance&mdash;and you certainly had to give it to old
  Doc Forrester: he knew how to drive: wasn't afraid to push it right through
  to the floor-board&mdash;Thomas had been talked to in man-to-man fashion by
  this grand fellow, Doc Cunningham, and Doc had added much to Thomas's
  self-confidence.</p>

  <p>It seemed very strange to be riding in this expensive and powerful coupé
  between two such important men; a bit crowded&mdash;for both of the docs were
  big men and wore very heavy coats&mdash;but he hadn't minded that. And he
  wasn't much in the way. Once they'd hit the road, old Doc hadn't shifted
  gears all the trip into town. Cunningham had treated him as if he really was
  somebody, asking him what he had worked at; and, when Thomas had told him
  about the airplane factory, Doc had said he knew about that and thought a man
  good enough to work on such a particular job shouldn't have any trouble
  finding employment. "How'd you like to be a mechanic in a good garage?" Doc
  had asked. And Thomas had said he'd like it. And Doc had said he'd look into
  it at once. And Thomas had said he hoped that he'd be free to take a job;
  hoped he wouldn't get into trouble with the cops. And Doc had said that maybe
  they could get him cleared, unless Beaven died: in that case he'd probably be
  held; certainly as a state witness. And then Thomas had said, "I hope to God
  Doc gets well." And Cunningham snapped out, "So you won't be held?" And that
  had made Thomas mad and he had replied, pretty sharply, too, "I don't like
  that, Doc! This fellow's a friend of mine. And if he
  dies&mdash;well&mdash;you needn't bother about the job for me."</p>

  <p>But that hadn't peeved Doc a bit. The way they were sitting, all squashed
  together, Doc had his arm over the back of the seat and he had given him a
  whack on the shoulder, and said, "That's the stuff, Thomas! That's what
  courage does to you! Couple of hours ago you were running off, leaving Beaven
  bleeding and unconscious. Then something gets to eating you, and you run all
  the way back through the mud. And now you don't care what happens to you, so
  long as Doc gets well! Now you'll probably amount to something important.
  Whenever a man gets reckless about what happens to himself, and frets over
  what may happen to his friend, then he begins to take on weight! You know the
  kind of weight I mean, Thomas."</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Doc, for blowing off," Thomas had said.</p>

  <p>"Quite right you should," said Doc. "I beg your pardon for my insinuation.
  I knew you'd helped yourself to something good to-night&mdash;and I was
  curious to find out how much it was worth to you. You've got some valuable
  property there, Thomas."</p>

  <p>And all the time this talk was going on, old Doc Forrester was bearing
  full weight on the accelerator. It was a funny thing, Thomas had reflected.
  Here he'd always thought of the docs as a lot of soft cissies who swanked
  around in white coats; nothing but a bunch of stuck-up, lily-fingered Nancys;
  but he guessed he'd have to give it to these birds on this ride. Halfway in,
  the old man said they might as well push along and get things ready; damned
  if he hadn't ploughed past that ambulance same as if it was a-settin' there
  on the road parked; and all the time Cunningham kept a-talkin' along cool as
  you please. You'd 'a' thought these fellows were at home smokin' their pipes.
  And when they'd reached the town lights, the old man never slowed down a bit;
  damned if he hadn't roared right through the business district at sixty-five;
  and while he was doin' it Cunningham was a-talkin' about the girl that Thomas
  had scared half out of her wits; talkin' now as if Thomas wasn't there.</p>

  <p>"You're going to pull him through, all right, Tubby," Cunningham was
  saying. "He has got to get well, you know. Two or three big reasons. Valuable
  man. Can't afford to lose him. And then he has to get well so he can find out
  how you went after him without stopping to think what might happen to you.
  And he has to get well so he can find out what kind of girl he's going to
  marry. She'll never tell him. It will be your job, Tubby. I'll say that will
  be a grand assignment! I suppose he thinks he knows what kind of property
  he's getting&mdash;but you tell him the rest of it&mdash;about his great
  fortune. It will double the value of the gift if <i>you</i> tell him. He
  knows you aren't a bit sentimental.... Tubby&mdash;By God&mdash;you've got
  to pull him through&mdash;<i>if you have to work a miracle!"</i> And
  Forrester hadn't said a word; just kept feedin' her gas; right through town;
  right straight down the middle of the street; turning into the hospital
  grounds on two wheels, and bringing up at the ambulance entrance with a
  screech of the chains&mdash;or what was left of 'em&mdash;that tore up the
  frozen gravel.</p>

  <p>Then the big docs had flung the doors open and popped out, leaving Thomas
  sitting there in the middle of the seat, not quite sure what was expected of
  him. He was, however, certain of one thing: they had forgotten all about him.
  For a minute he was a bit crestfallen. Doc Cunningham had made him feel
  mighty important, and now he wasn't needed at all. They had rushed away to do
  their job. But&mdash;why shouldn't they? They were big men! So was <i>he!</i>
  They knew their place&mdash;and so did <i>he!</i> Nevertheless Thomas was
  more than a bit lonesome. He slid across to the right end of the seat and got
  out. The ambulance was arriving. He moved down to the rear doors. Maybe they
  would let him help carry Doc in. But they didn't.</p>

  <p>First, the girl got out and stood waiting for the driver and the Chinaman
  to lift the stretcher. Thomas marvelled at the ease and speed with which they
  did it. Gosh&mdash;these fellows must have so much of this to do that they
  know every move to make, he thought. In an instant they had filed through the
  door and into the big elevator. Thomas stood for a long time, wondering what
  he should do. He felt he wouldn't be welcome upstairs. It occurred to him
  that it might be all right to go up to the ward where Martha was and wait in
  the hall. But that wouldn't do. It was midnight, and, anyway, they didn't
  like him up there. Maybe they would when they heard what he'd done&mdash;but
  he wouldn't tell 'em&mdash;no, sir. Somebody else would have to tell 'em,
  like old Doc Forrester would do&mdash;about the girl&mdash;if Beaven got
  well.</p>

  <p>Thomas shivered. Certainly nobody could object if he came inside out of
  the snow. He opened the heavy door and ambled to and fro in the corridor.
  Presently he heard the elevator coming down. The Chinaman stepped out.</p>

  <p>"Glad you are still here, Mr Buckley. Dr Cunningham says he is sorry he
  forgot to tell you that arrangements have been made for you to stay here
  to-night. Come, please, and we will go up. An orderly will show you to your
  room, and if you are hungry he will find you something to eat."</p>

  <p>Thomas tried to say something, but he wasn't going to let a Chink see that
  he was a softie, so he made no reply. All the way up to the third floor
  Thomas kept saying to himself that Cunningham was a grand guy, grandest guy
  in the world. Doc Cunningham hadn't forgotten him, after all.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Approaching the trio in the alcove and standing respectfully at attention,
  Abbott had said with dignity, as if announcing the arrival of the Emperor,
  "Dr Beaven is coming out."</p>

  <p>Cunningham leaped to his feet, clenched his fists, stretched his long arms
  to the full torsion of an ecstatic hallelujah, and exclaimed, <i>"Thank
  God!"</i></p>

  <p>Shane hustled away after Abbot, who was retracing his steps to Beaven's
  room. Edith Cunningham, dashing the sudden tears out of her eyes, stood
  waiting for Bill, who had sat down again, with his elbows on his knees and
  his head in his hands trying to compose himself. Warren had whispered an
  order to the floor supervisor, who was now phoning it to the office. Edith,
  overhearing, said, "That's very thoughtful." Then she walked slowly toward
  Jack's room. Audrey, coming out into the corridor, walked weakly into her
  arms.</p>

  <p>"There, there!" murmured Edith, softly. "Don't let go, dear. It has been
  an awful strain and you're quite worn out. But everything is going to be all
  right now. Come: we've a bed for you."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;but I cannot go to sleep," protested Audrey, shaking her
  head.</p>

  <p>"But you have to," declared Edith. "It has been ordered for you by high
  authority. Tubby's command! It has been a hard night for the old rascal,
  darling. Do as he says. He doesn't like to be disobeyed."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Audrey, woodenly. "I think I must go back to the hotel. We
  are going home to-day: is it not so?"</p>

  <p>"Home!" Edith's eyes were puzzled. "When Jack hasn't had a chance to speak
  to you? No&mdash;indeed. We're going to stay until he's quite himself
  again."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure it was Dr Forrester said I must spend the night here?" asked
  Audrey.</p>

  <p>"Of course, dear. Miss Warren just told me. Come along, now. Get some
  rest, and you can see Jack in the morning. He should be wide awake then and
  inquiring for you."</p>

  <p>With obvious but mysterious misgivings written on her face, Audrey
  permitted herself to be led down the corridor and put to bed. Edith told the
  nurse to run along; said she would help Miss Hilton undress.</p>

  <p>"Just think, darling!" Edith was hanging up the dinner-gown in the closet.
  "We've got him back! Bill says it was a very close thing. I'm afraid he
  didn't have much hope."</p>

  <p>"I know," mumbled Audrey. "You must excuse me, please, if I cannot say
  anything. I am verree tired."</p>

  <p>Edith drew the covers up over her, kissed her cheek, turned out the light,
  and softly closed the door behind her. She was much puzzled; just a little
  hurt, too. It had seemed so unlike Audrey to withhold her confidence. A good
  deal had happened to Audrey to-night that hadn't been explained. When they
  had arrived at midnight with Jack, it had taken a half-hour to get him ready
  for the X-ray pictures and the operation. Edith had taken Audrey tenderly in
  hand. They had gone to a private sitting-room, and she had done her best
  tactfully to get the whole story; but Audrey had been strangely
  uncommunicative.</p>

  <p>Yes&mdash;she had admitted, as from afar&mdash;she had dined with Dr
  Forrester. Yes&mdash;at the University Club. No&mdash;she hadn't known of the
  engagement until shortly before she went to keep it. Yes&mdash;they had
  received the word there, and had gone to the country at once. That was about
  all there was to tell, said Audrey.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;fancy your dining with Tubby&mdash;of all people!" Edith had
  exclaimed, incredulously. "Whatever came over Tubby to ask you? That seems
  very odd!"</p>

  <p>"I know," Audrey had murmured, remotely.</p>

  <p>"And you don't want to talk about it," Edith had said, realizing that this
  comment was an understatement of a demonstrated fact.</p>

  <p>"Not now, please," Audrey had replied.</p>

  <p>And as if that wasn't baffling enough, here was Audrey&mdash;at a moment
  when you might have supposed she would be hysterical with
  happiness&mdash;going to bed with all the weight of the troubled world on her
  shoulders, after she had muttered something about going home in the
  morning.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>For quite a little while Audrey had been trying, intermittently and with
  no success, to orient herself; but it did not matter much, for something kept
  saying there was no good reason for waking up at all. A heavy lethargy
  weighted her.</p>

  <p>With an effort she raised her arm and rubbed it across her face. The gown
  she wore was rough and raspy and smelled of a disinfecting chemical. Then the
  scattered fragments of the picture began to drift together, and it all slowly
  came back. She was in the hospital and she had been dead asleep for hours and
  hours and hours. She had had such a dreadful time going to sleep. She had
  cried, uncontrollably, until her chest ached and her throat was afire. And
  then&mdash;after hours and hours&mdash;a nurse had given her an injection of
  something in her arm. And everything had begun to flatten out, slowly. All
  the world had been rolled up so tightly that you could hardly breathe in
  it&mdash;and now everything had gradually unrolled, and smoothed itself
  out&mdash;flat, relaxed, serene.</p>

  <p>Sunshine was flooding the room; so bright that it hurt her eyes. Slowly
  she turned her face away from the glare, and saw him sitting there by the bed
  in his white coat, regarding her soberly. She tried to wink her eyes wider
  open, but they were very heavy.</p>

  <p>"You have had a good sleep," said Tubby, quietly.</p>

  <p>Audrey nodded slowly, moistened her lips with an apathetic tongue, and
  said, "Yes; did you?"</p>

  <p>"Enough," said Tubby.</p>

  <p>It was some time before she could summon the energy to speak again.</p>

  <p>"How is he?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Awake."</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;he will be&mdash;all right&mdash;now?"</p>

  <p>Tubby nodded.</p>

  <p>"I shall go then," said Audrey, "as I promised. And may-bee it is better I
  should go&mdash;now. You can say that I had to go home. Yes&mdash;I think
  that would be better."</p>

  <p>Tubby shook his head and frowned.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;that wouldn't do," he muttered. "He's not out of the woods yet.
  Two heavy shocks; the blow, and the surgery. We can't have an emotional
  disturbance. Needs all his resistance. You stay here until he has gathered a
  little more strength."</p>

  <p>"That will be verree hard for me," said Audrey.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you can do it," Tubby's tone was business-like. "Any woman who
  could carry on as you did, last night, can do it.... Hungry?"</p>

  <p>"I have not thought about it."</p>

  <p>Tubby rose and stood behind the chair, and laid his hands on the top of
  it.</p>

  <p>"The nurse will bring you something. When you feel strong enough, go to
  Beaven's room. He has been asking for you, and will be bothered if you don't
  show up pretty soon. He is very weak, and you are not to stay long." Tubby
  paused and drummed a little on the back of the chair with indecisive fingers.
  "I don't suppose I need say to you that no reference should be made to
  your&mdash;your going away, and I hope you will appear to be cheerful. Mrs
  Cunningham has sent your day clothes. You will find them in the closet. I
  think you should arrange to remain in town for at least a week."</p>

  <p>"Verree well," agreed Audrey, pensively. "Thank you."</p>

  <p>"And if there is anything I can do for you, it will be a
  pleasure&mdash;and an honour." Tubby bowed respectfully.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing, thank you," she said, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>Tubby walked to the door where he tarried with something on his mind.
  Whatever it was to be, he was having difficulty organizing it.</p>

  <p>"May I venture to inquire," he asked, stiffly, "whether Dr or Mrs
  Cunningham have been advised of the request I made, last night at dinner, and
  your promise to comply?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Audrey. "Would you like me to tell them?"</p>

  <p>"That can wait," said Tubby.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>McFey, who had replaced Warren, came to the door in response to Audrey's
  light tap, and stepped out into the corridor.</p>

  <p>"You're Miss Hilton," she said, smiling. "You are expected. If he wants
  anything, push the bell. You'll not be needing me for a little while," she
  added, archly.</p>

  <p>Jack was holding up his hands to receive her. Audrey crossed the room
  softly, laid her hands in his, and tried to speak, but no words would come.
  Bending over, she pressed her cheek against his and felt his hot tears on her
  face. He tried to put his arms around her, but lacked the strength.</p>

  <p>"Darling," he whispered. "So glad&mdash;you're here."</p>

  <p>Audrey raised her head and smiled happily.</p>

  <p>"You will be well soon," she murmured, caressing him lightly on his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"Tubby says"&mdash;Jack drew a deep breath and winced&mdash;"Tubby says
  you were very brave. I am proud of you."</p>

  <p>"Have you two made up&mdash;may-bee?"</p>

  <p>Jack drew a feeble smile.</p>

  <p>"We haven't talked about it," he said faintly. "I don't know whether he is
  pleased with me&mdash;or the operation. Tubby is always pleased
  over&mdash;success&mdash;of&mdash;good&mdash;operation."</p>

  <p>"May-bee you should not talk, dear." Audrey slipped her arm under his
  shoulder and nestled her face against his breast.</p>

  <p>"Lan Ying."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Jack."</p>

  <p>"I want you to do something&mdash;for me. All the time I was
  half-conscious&mdash;waking up&mdash;it was on my mind. I want you to buy a
  doll&mdash;for a child&mdash;Collins child. Nurse&mdash;Slattery&mdash;will
  know."</p>

  <p>"Of course, dear. I shall do it now&mdash;soon as I leave you." Her tone
  was indulgent, maternal. "And you were fretting about it."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;it was a promise. Got to keep promises."</p>

  <p>There was a rap on the door, and after a discreet interval Cunningham
  entered.</p>

  <p>"I'm called home," he said, breezily. "Stopped in to say 'Goodbye and good
  luck'. Taking Edith with me. Leaving at four." He put an arm about Lan Ying's
  shoulders. "Tubby says you're staying on for a few days. Quite right. Any
  message for your sister?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you&mdash;no. I shall be writing."</p>

  <p>"I'll be running along. Have some packing to do. See you both soon, I
  hope.... By the way, I saw Tubby stomping up and down the hall, out here,
  as if he wanted to come in. Shall I tell the old rascal you want to see
  him?"</p>

  <p>Jack nodded. Bill waved a hand and left them.</p>

  <p>"May-bee I should go now," said Lan Ying. "He wants to see you
  professionally, I think."</p>

  <p>Jack laid a hand on her arm. "You stay here," he said, weakly. "Tubby has
  not seen us&mdash;together. I'd like to get him used to the idea&mdash;our
  belonging&mdash;to each other."</p>

  <p>She frowned a little. He noted her perplexity.</p>

  <p>"Tubby won't hurt you," he said, reassuringly. "Perhaps he even likes you.
  He spoke of your courage. Tubby admires
  courage&mdash;hardness&mdash;toughness."</p>

  <p>"You want me to be hard and tough?" asked Lan Ying, shaking her head, her
  eyes childishly wide.</p>

  <p>"Not&mdash;too&mdash;tough."</p>

  <p>Lan Ying drew away.</p>

  <p>"I am going now, dear. You are wearing yourself out, talking to me. We can
  see Tubby&mdash;together&mdash;to-morrow." She kissed him lightly, moved to
  the door, smiled, twinkled her fingers, and went out. Tubby was standing by
  the floor supervisor's desk, scowling at a clinical chart. He glanced up, as
  she passed, nodded, and resumed his reading.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>It was a queer sensation to be shopping for Jack; queerer still to be
  shopping for a doll. She would get a verree nice one and let him see it
  before she gave it to the little girl.</p>

  <p>"A verree nice doll," she said, to the saleswoman.</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam. Will you be seated?"</p>

  <p>So&mdash;they had brought her several beautiful dolls, expensively and
  modishly dressed, with real shoes that could be taken off, and picture
  hats.</p>

  <p>"This child," said Lan Ying, "is an invalid&mdash;in bed. I
  think&mdash;instead of the hat and shoes and parasol&mdash;the doll should be
  a verree young baby that she can hold in her arms&mdash;with many baby
  dresses to put on."</p>

  <p>"Very well, madam," said the saleswoman.</p>

  <p>So&mdash;they found a chubby, cherubic, baby doll, and Lan Ying
  painstakingly selected the little gowns; muslin, silk, dainty dimity,
  gingham; and an assortment of little socks. It seemed verree queer to be
  buying such things&mdash;for Jack to send to his patient.</p>

  <p>At first, she was delighted with her discoveries. She had not known the
  stores were stocked with so wide a variety of dolls' garments. After a while
  she settled to her task quite seriously, examining the workmanship, fingering
  the little hems, gently smoothing out the lace insertions.</p>

  <p>So attentive had she been to her novel task that she had not spoken for a
  long time. Then, realizing that she should come to a decision about her
  selections, she shook herself loose from her reverie and glanced up to meet a
  curious expression in the saleswoman's eyes&mdash;a sort of compassionate
  look. And then she knew that the woman had guessed what she was thinking;
  though, of course, she could not know everything that she was thinking.</p>

  <p>"Shall we deliver your purchase, madam?" asked the saleswoman, when Lan
  Ying had paid her.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I shall take it with me."</p>

  <p>It was a quite bulky parcel, but the Livingstone was only a block away.
  Back once more in her room, Lan Ying locked the door, tossed her coat and hat
  aside, opened the big package, and spread everything out on the bed. After a
  while she slipped down on the pillow, with her face buried in the crook of
  her arm, and quietly wept herself to sleep.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Jack was so much brighter and stronger to-day; almost gay, indeed. McFey,
  as Lan Ying entered, carrying her large parcel, seemed to have some
  difficulty performing a multitude of last-minute errands before she left the
  room. Jack was frankly amused.</p>

  <p>"McFey," he confided, when the door had closed, and Lan Ying was in his
  arms, "is devastated with curiosity." He drew her down and gave her a
  lingering kiss. "And&mdash;so am I," he added, when he had found his
  breath."</p>

  <p>"Verree well, then," said Lan Ying, brightly. "I shall not keep you
  waiting." She set the mysterious package on the bed and began opening it.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!&mdash;it <i>is</i> a baby!" said Jack, astonished at the
  life-likeness of the doll. "About three months old, I should say. Where did
  you find it, darling? I had no idea&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"See his dresses." She began handing him the little garments.</p>

  <p>"His?"</p>

  <p>"I think so." She slipped a tiny stocking on the chubby foot.</p>

  <p>"This is our best dress," said Lan Ying, proudly. "We wear this one when
  we have company."</p>

  <p>"And our mother shows off our tricks," assisted Jack.</p>

  <p>"He is verree&mdash;verree snuggly," observed Lan Ying, cuddling the doll
  in her arms.</p>

  <p>They both glanced up apprehensively. The door was opening. Tubby had
  stepped inside the room. For a moment they just stared at him&mdash;and Tubby
  returned the stare. Then, without a word, he turned to go.</p>

  <p>"Come back, please," called Jack.</p>

  <p>Tubby hesitated; then came slowly toward them. They were all very much
  flustered and at a complete loss for words.</p>

  <p>"It is for a sick child," explained Lan Ying, unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"Him?" asked Tubby, with a grin, nodding toward Jack.</p>

  <p>They all laughed a little, and felt relieved. Lan Ying was still holding
  the doll in her arms.</p>

  <p>"Appears to be a healthy child," said Tubby, huskily, but trying to be
  casual. He stooped over to inspect its face.</p>

  <p>"Want to hold him?" asked Lan Ying, soberly.</p>

  <p>Jack was smiling broadly. This, he felt, was going to be good. Lan Ying
  certainly had old Tubby on the spot.</p>

  <p>Tubby frowned a little and reached out his arms. Lan Ying maternally
  passed him the doll and stood very close, patting the ribbons into place.</p>

  <p>"I shall take him," she murmured, feeling that poor old Tubby needed
  rescuing. "He is not used to strangers." She gathered up the doll from
  Tubby's arms.</p>

  <p>Tubby made a poor attempt to smile.</p>

  <p>"I'll come back&mdash;after a while," he muttered; and, turning abruptly,
  he left the room.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what got into Tubby&mdash;just now," said Jack.</p>

  <p>Lan Ying shook her head&mdash;and said she did not know.</p>

  <p>"I must go now, dear," she said, "and give the little girl her doll. Then
  I shall come back&mdash;for a minute&mdash;and tell you what she said."</p>

  <p>Jack watched her with brooding eyes as she folded the tiny garments and
  tied up the parcel.</p>

  <p>"So sweet!" he whispered, patting her hand.</p>

  <p>Outside the door she was surprised, and a bit confused, to find Tubby.
  Apparently he had been waiting for her. Without a word, he took the parcel
  and fell into step beside her. When they came to the open door of the little
  waiting-room, he paused and motioned her to go in. Mystified, Lan Ying
  obeyed. He pushed the door shut. He faced her solemnly, and she looked up
  with inquiring eyes. Tubby's chin was trembling a little.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said, thickly. "I have been very much&mdash;stirred.
  I&mdash;I don't know quite what to say to you&mdash;but&mdash;I feel I must
  say&mdash;something."</p>

  <p>"I know," agreed Lan Ying, softly. "It has been verree difficult&mdash;for
  both of us. Do not worry, please. It was unfortunate&mdash;but&mdash;it was
  not your fault.... And&mdash;as I told you&mdash;I mean to keep my
  promise."</p>

  <p><i>"Damn your promise!"</i> muttered Tubby.</p>

  <p>Lan Ying's eyes were swimming as she looked up into his contorted face.
  "You mean"&mdash;her voice broke, and the big tears rolled down her
  cheeks&mdash;"I am to stay"&mdash;she shook her head unbelievingly&mdash;"to
  stay&mdash;with Jack&mdash;always?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!" growled Tubby. He laid both hands on her shoulders.
  "But&mdash;I'd like to have you make me another promise."</p>

  <p>"Verree well," murmured Lan Ying.</p>

  <p>"You can guess&mdash;perhaps," said Tubby.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;may-bee&mdash;I must never tell Jack."</p>

  <p>"Yes, my dear. Promise?"</p>

  <p>Lan Ying smiled and nodded her head.</p>

  <p>Tubby whipped a big handkerchief out of his pocket, blew a mighty trumpet
  blast, and cleared his throat tremendously. Then he straightened his
  shoulders, and resumed his accustomed pomposity.</p>

  <p>"May I go now?" asked Lan Ying. He opened the door for her and followed
  her out; handed her the big package and bowed with deep respect.</p>

  <p>"Not going with me," said Lan Ying, "to deliver the doll?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Tubby, "that's your job.... And&mdash;I want to have a
  word with Jack."</p>

  <p>Lan Ying drew a long breath, and stood where she was, watching Tubby's
  confident strides as he stalked down the corridor; watched him push open
  Jack's door, and disappear. Then she went back into the little waiting-room
  and sat down&mdash;for her knees were trembling.</p>
