<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>The weather door of the smoking-room had been left open to the North
Atlantic fog, as the big liner rolled and lifted, whistling to warn the
fishing-fleet.</p>
<p>"That Cheyne boy's the biggest nuisance aboard," said a man in a frieze
overcoat, shutting the door with a bang. "He isn't wanted here. He's too
fresh."</p>
<p>A white-haired German reached for a sandwich, and grunted between bites: "I
know der breed. Ameriga is full of dot kind. I dell you you should imbort
ropes' ends free under your dariff."</p>
<p>"Pshaw! There isn't any real harm to him. He's more to be pitied than
anything," a man from New York drawled, as he lay at full length along the
cushions under the wet skylight. "They've dragged him around from hotel to
hotel ever since he was a kid. I was talking to his mother this morning. She's
a lovely lady, but she don't pretend to manage him. He's going to Europe to
finish his education."</p>
<p>"Education isn't begun yet." This was a Philadelphian, curled up in a
corner. "That boy gets two hundred a month pocket-money, he told me. He isn't
sixteen either."</p>
<p>"Railroads, his father, aind't it?" said the German.</p>
<p>"Yep. That and mines and lumber and shipping. Built one place at San Diego,
the old man has; another at Los Angeles; owns half a dozen railroads, half the
lumber on the Pacific slope, and lets his wife spend the money," the
Philadelphian went on lazily. "The West don't suit her, she says. She just
tracks around with the boy and her nerves, trying to find out what'll amuse
him, I guess. Florida, Adirondacks, Lakewood, Hot Springs, New York, and round
again. He isn't much more than a second-hand hotel clerk now. When he's
finished in Europe he'll be a holy terror."</p>
<p>"What's the matter with the old man attending to him personally?" said a
voice from the frieze ulster.</p>
<p>"Old man's piling up the rocks. 'Don't want to be disturbed, I guess. He'll
find out his error a few years from now. 'Pity, because there's a heap of good
in the boy if you could get at it."</p>
<p>"Mit a rope's end; mit a rope's end!" growled the German.</p>
<p>Once more the door banged, and a slight, slim-built boy perhaps fifteen
years old, a half-smoked cigarette hanging from one corner of his mouth, leaned
in over the high footway. His pasty yellow complexion did not show well on a
person of his years, and his look was a mixture of irresolution, bravado, and
very cheap smartness. He was dressed in a cherry-coloured blazer,
knickerbockers, red stockings, and bicycle shoes, with a red flannel cap at the
back of the head. After whistling between his teeth, as he eyed the company, he
said in a loud, high voice: "Say, it's thick outside. You can hear the
fish-boats squawking all around us. Say, wouldn't it be great if we ran down
one?"</p>
<p>"Shut the door, Harvey," said the New Yorker. "Shut the door and stay
outside. You're not wanted here."</p>
<p>"Who'll stop me?" he answered, deliberately. "Did you pay for my passage,
Mister Martin? 'Guess I've as good right here as the next man."</p>
<p>He picked up some dice from a checkerboard and began throwing, right hand
against left.</p>
<p>"Say, gen'elmen, this is deader'n mud. Can't we make a game of poker between
us?"</p>
<p>There was no answer, and he puffed his cigarette, swung his legs, and
drummed on the table with rather dirty fingers. Then he pulled out a roll of
bills as if to count them.</p>
<p>"How's your mamma this afternoon?" a man said. "I didn't see her at
lunch."</p>
<p>"In her state-room, I guess. She's 'most always sick on the ocean. I'm going
to give the stewardess fifteen dollars for looking after her. I don't go down
more 'n I can avoid. It makes me feel mysterious to pass that butler's-pantry
place. Say, this is the first time I've been on the ocean."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't apologize, Harvey."</p>
<p>"Who's apologizing? This is the first time I've crossed the ocean,
gen'elmen, and, except the first day, I haven't been sick one little bit. No,
sir!" He brought down his fist with a triumphant bang, wetted his finger, and
went on counting the bills.</p>
<p>"Oh, you're a high-grade machine, with the writing in plain sight," the
Philadelphian yawned. "You'll blossom into a credit to your country if you
don't take care."</p>
<p>"I know it. I'm an American&mdash;first, last, and all the time. I'll show
'em that when I strike Europe. Piff! My cig's out. I can't smoke the truck the
steward sells. Any gen'elman got a real Turkish cig on him?"</p>
<p>The chief engineer entered for a moment, red, smiling, and wet. "Say, Mac,"
cried Harvey cheerfully, "how are we hitting it?"</p>
<p>"Vara much in the ordinary way," was the grave reply. "The young are as
polite as ever to their elders, an' their elders are e'en tryin' to appreciate
it."</p>
<p>A low chuckle came from a corner. The German opened his cigar-case and
handed a skinny black cigar to Harvey.</p>
<p>"Dot is der broper apparatus to smoke, my young friendt," he said. "You vill
dry it? Yes? Den you vill be efer so happy."</p>
<p>Harvey lit the unlovely thing with a flourish: he felt that he was getting
on in grownup society.</p>
<p>"It would take more 'n this to keel me over," he said, ignorant that he was
lighting that terrible article, a Wheeling "stogie".</p>
<p>"Dot we shall bresently see," said the German. "Where are we now, Mr.
Mactonal'?"</p>
<p>"Just there or thereabouts, Mr. Schaefer," said the engineer. "We'll be on
the Grand Bank to-night; but in a general way o' speakin', we're all among the
fishing-fleet now. We've shaved three dories an' near scalped the boom off a
Frenchman since noon, an' that's close sailing', ye may say."</p>
<p>"You like my cigar, eh?" the German asked, for Harvey's eyes were full of
tears.</p>
<p>"Fine, full flavor," he answered through shut teeth. "Guess we've slowed
down a little, haven't we? I'll skip out and see what the log says."</p>
<p>"I might if I vhas you," said the German.</p>
<p>Harvey staggered over the wet decks to the nearest rail. He was very
unhappy; but he saw the deck-steward lashing chairs together, and, since he had
boasted before the man that he was never seasick, his pride made him go aft to
the second-saloon deck at the stern, which was finished in a turtle-back. The
deck was deserted, and he crawled to the extreme end of it, near the flag-pole.
There he doubled up in limp agony, for the Wheeling "stogie" joined with the
surge and jar of the screw to sieve out his soul. His head swelled; sparks of
fire danced before his eyes; his body seemed to lose weight, while his heels
wavered in the breeze. He was fainting from seasickness, and a roll of the ship
tilted him over the rail on to the smooth lip of the turtle-back. Then a low,
gray mother-wave swung out of the fog, tucked Harvey under one arm, so to
speak, and pulled him off and away to leeward; the great green closed over him,
and he went quietly to sleep.</p>
<p>He was roused by the sound of a dinner-horn such as they used to blow at a
summer-school he had once attended in the Adirondacks. Slowly he remembered
that he was Harvey Cheyne, drowned and dead in mid-ocean, but was too weak to
fit things together. A new smell filled his nostrils; wet and clammy chills ran
down his back, and he was helplessly full of salt water. When he opened his
eyes, he perceived that he was still on the top of the sea, for it was running
round him in silver-coloured hills, and he was lying on a pile of half-dead
fish, looking at a broad human back clothed in a blue jersey.</p>
<p>"It's no good," thought the boy. "I'm dead, sure enough, and this thing is
in charge."</p>
<p>He groaned, and the figure turned its head, showing a pair of little gold
rings half hidden in curly black hair.</p>
<p>"Aha! You feel some pretty well now?" it said. "Lie still so: we trim
better."</p>
<p>With a swift jerk he sculled the flickering boat-head on to a foamless sea
that lifted her twenty full feet, only to slide her into a glassy pit beyond.
But this mountain-climbing did not interrupt blue-jersey's talk. "Fine good
job, I say, that I catch you. Eh, wha-at? Better good job, I say, your boat not
catch me. How you come to fall out?"</p>
<p>"I was sick," said Harvey; "sick, and couldn't help it."</p>
<p>"Just in time I blow my horn, and your boat she yaw a little. Then I see you
come all down. Eh, wha-at? I think you are cut into baits by the screw, but you
dreeft&mdash;dreeft to me, and I make a big fish of you. So you shall not die
this time."</p>
<p>"Where am I?" said Harvey, who could not see that life was particularly safe
where he lay.</p>
<p>"You are with me in the dory&mdash;Manuel my name, and I come from schooner
<i>We're Here</i> of Gloucester. I live to Gloucester. By-and-by we get supper.
Eh, wha-at?"</p>
<p>He seemed to have two pairs of hands and a head of cast-iron, for, not
content with blowing through a big conch-shell, he must needs stand up to it,
swaying with the sway of the flat-bottomed dory, and send a grinding,
thuttering shriek through the fog. How long this entertainment lasted, Harvey
could not remember, for he lay back terrified at the sight of the smoking
swells. He fancied he heard a gun and a horn and shouting. Something bigger
than the dory, but quite as lively, loomed alongside. Several voices talked at
once; he was dropped into a dark, heaving hole, where men in oilskins gave him
a hot drink and took off his clothes, and he fell asleep.</p>
<p>When he waked he listened for the first breakfast-bell on the steamer,
wondering why his state-room had grown so small. Turning, he looked into a
narrow, triangular cave, lit by a lamp hung against a huge square beam. A
three-cornered table within arm's reach ran from the angle of the bows to the
foremast. At the after end, behind a well-used Plymouth stove, sat a boy about
his own age, with a flat red face and a pair of twinkling gray eyes. He was
dressed in a blue jersey and high rubber boots. Several pairs of the same sort
of foot-wear, an old cap, and some worn-out woollen socks lay on the floor, and
black and yellow oilskins swayed to and fro beside the bunks. The place was
packed as full of smells as a bale is of cotton. The oilskins had a peculiarly
thick flavor of their own which made a sort of background to the smells of
fried fish, burnt grease, paint, pepper, and stale tobacco; but these, again,
were all hooped together by one encircling smell of ship and salt water. Harvey
saw with disgust that there were no sheets on his bed-place. He was lying on a
piece of dingy ticking full of lumps and nubbles. Then, too, the boat's motion
was not that of a steamer. She was neither sliding nor rolling, but rather
wriggling herself about in a silly, aimless way, like a colt at the end of a
halter. Water-noises ran by close to his ear, and beams creaked and whined
about him. All these things made him grunt despairingly and think of his
mother.</p>
<p>"Feelin' better?" said the boy, with a grin. "Hev some coffee?" He brought a
tin cup full and sweetened it with molasses.</p>
<p>"Isn't there milk?" said Harvey, looking round the dark double tier of bunks
as if he expected to find a cow there.</p>
<p>"Well, no," said the boy. "Ner there ain't likely to be till 'baout
mid-September. 'Tain't bad coffee. I made it."</p>
<p>Harvey drank in silence, and the boy handed him a plate full of pieces of
crisp fried pork, which he ate ravenously.</p>
<p>"I've dried your clothes. Guess they've shrunk some," said the boy. "They
ain't our style much&mdash;none of 'em. Twist round an' see if you're hurt
any."</p>
<p>Harvey stretched himself in every direction, but could not report any
injuries.</p>
<p>"That's good," the boy said heartily. "Fix yerself an' go on deck. Dad wants
to see you. I'm his son,&mdash;Dan, they call me,&mdash;an' I'm cook's helper
an' everything else aboard that's too dirty for the men. There ain't no boy
here 'cep' me sence Otto went overboard&mdash;an' he was only a Dutchy, an'
twenty year old at that. How'd you come to fall off in a dead flat ca'am?"</p>
<p>"'Twasn't a calm," said Harvey, sulkily. "It was a gale, and I was seasick.
Guess I must have rolled over the rail."</p>
<p>"There was a little common swell yes'day an' last night," said the boy. "But
ef thet's your notion of a gale&mdash;&mdash;" He whistled. "You'll know more
'fore you're through. Hurry! Dad's waitin'."</p>
<p>Like many other unfortunate young people, Harvey had never in all his life
received a direct order&mdash;never, at least, without long, and sometimes
tearful, explanations of the advantages of obedience and the reasons for the
request. Mrs. Cheyne lived in fear of breaking his spirit, which, perhaps, was
the reason that she herself walked on the edge of nervous prostration. He could
not see why he should be expected to hurry for any man's pleasure, and said so.
"Your dad can come down here if he's so anxious to talk to me. I want him to
take me to New York right away. It'll pay him."</p>
<p>Dan opened his eyes as the size and beauty of this joke dawned on him. "Say,
Dad!" he shouted up the foc'sle hatch, "he says you kin slip down an' see him
ef you're anxious that way. 'Hear, Dad?"</p>
<p>The answer came back in the deepest voice Harvey had ever heard from a human
chest: "Quit foolin', Dan, and send him to me."</p>
<p>Dan sniggered, and threw Harvey his warped bicycle shoes. There was
something in the tones on the deck that made the boy dissemble his extreme rage
and console himself with the thought of gradually unfolding the tale of his own
and his father's wealth on the voyage home. This rescue would certainly make
him a hero among his friends for life. He hoisted himself on deck up a
perpendicular ladder, and stumbled aft, over a score of obstructions, to where
a small, thick-set, clean-shaven man with gray eyebrows sat on a step that led
up to the quarter-deck. The swell had passed in the night, leaving a long, oily
sea, dotted round the horizon with the sails of a dozen fishing-boats. Between
them lay little black specks, showing where the dories were out fishing. The
schooner, with a triangular riding-sail on the mainmast, played easily at
anchor, and except for the man by the cabin-roof&mdash;"house" they call
it&mdash;she was deserted.</p>
<p>"Mornin'&mdash;Good afternoon, I should say. You've nigh slep' the clock
round, young feller," was the greeting.</p>
<p>"Mornin'," said Harvey. He did not like being called "young feller"; and, as
one rescued from drowning, expected sympathy. His mother suffered agonies
whenever he got his feet wet; but this mariner did not seem excited.</p>
<p>"Naow let's hear all abaout it. It's quite providential, first an' last, fer
all concerned. What might be your name? Where from (we mistrust it's Noo York),
an' where baound (we mistrust it's Europe)?"</p>
<p>Harvey gave his name, the name of the steamer, and a short history of the
accident, winding up with a demand to be taken back immediately to New York,
where his father would pay anything any one chose to name.</p>
<p>"H'm," said the shaven man, quite unmoved by the end of Harvey's speech. "I
can't say we think special of any man, or boy even, that falls overboard from
that kind o' packet in a flat ca'am. Least of all when his excuse is that he's
seasick."</p>
<p>"Excuse!" cried Harvey. "D'you suppose I'd fall overboard into your dirty
little boat for fun?"</p>
<p>"Not knowin' what your notions o' fun may be, I can't rightly say, young
feller. But if I was you, I wouldn't call the boat which, under Providence, was
the means o' savin' ye, names. In the first place, it's blame irreligious. In
the second, it's annoyin' to my feelin's&mdash;an' I'm Disko Troop o' the
<i>We're Here</i> o' Gloucester, which you don't seem rightly to know."</p>
<p>"I don't know and I don't care," said Harvey. "I'm grateful enough for being
saved and all that, of course! but I want you to understand that the sooner you
take me back to New York the better it'll pay you."</p>
<p>"Meanin'&mdash;haow?" Troop raised one shaggy eyebrow over a suspiciously
mild blue eye.</p>
<p>"Dollars and cents," said Harvey, delighted to think that he was making an
impression. "Cold dollars and cents." He thrust a hand into a pocket, and threw
out his stomach a little, which was his way of being grand. "You've done the
best day's work you ever did in your life when you pulled me in. I'm all the
son Harvey Cheyne has."</p>
<p>"He's bin favoured," said Disko, dryly.</p>
<p>"And if you don't know who Harvey Cheyne is, you don't know
much&mdash;that's all. Now turn her around and let's hurry."</p>
<p>Harvey had a notion that the greater part of America was filled with people
discussing and envying his father's dollars.</p>
<p>"Mebbe I do, an' mebbe I don't. Take a reef in your stummick, young feller.
It's full o' my vittles."</p>
<p>Harvey heard a chuckle from Dan, who was pretending to be busy by the
stump-foremast, and blood rushed to his face. "We'll pay for that too," he
said. "When do you suppose we shall get to New York?"</p>
<p>"I don't use Noo York any. Ner Boston. We may see Eastern Point about
September; an' your pa&mdash;I'm real sorry I hain't heerd tell of
him&mdash;may give me ten dollars efter all your talk. Then o' course he
mayn't."</p>
<p>"Ten dollars! Why, see here, I&mdash;" Harvey dived into his pocket for the
wad of bills. All he brought up was a soggy packet of cigarettes.</p>
<p>"Not lawful currency; an' bad for the lungs. Heave 'em overboard, young
feller, and try agin."</p>
<p>"It's been stolen!" cried Harvey, hotly.</p>
<p>"You'll hev to wait till you see your pa to reward me, then?"</p>
<p>"A hundred and thirty-four dollars&mdash;all stolen," said Harvey, hunting
wildly through his pockets. "Give them back."</p>
<p>A curious change flitted across old Troop's hard face. "What might you have
been doin' at your time o' life with one hundred an' thirty-four dollars, young
feller?"</p>
<p>"It was part of my pocket-money&mdash;for a month." This Harvey thought
would be a knock-down blow, and it was&mdash;indirectly.</p>
<p>"Oh! One hundred and thirty-four dollars is only part of his
pocket-money&mdash;for one month only! You don't remember hittin' anything when
you fell over, do you? Crack agin a stanchion, le's say. Old man Hasken o' the
East Wind"&mdash;Troop seemed to be talking to himself&mdash;"he tripped on a
hatch an' butted the mainmast with his head&mdash;hardish. 'Baout three weeks
afterwards, old man Hasken he would hev it that the "East Wind" was a
commerce-destroyin' man-o'-war, an' so he declared war on Sable Island because
it was Bridish, an' the shoals run aout too far. They sewed him up in a
bed-bag, his head an' feet appearin', fer the rest o' the trip, an' now he's to
home in Essex playin' with little rag dolls."</p>
<p>Harvey choked with rage, but Troop went on consolingly: "We're sorry fer
you. We're very sorry fer you&mdash;an' so young. We won't say no more abaout
the money, I guess."</p>
<p>"'Course you won't. You stole it."</p>
<p>"Suit yourself. We stole it ef it's any comfort to you. Naow, abaout goin'
back. Allowin' we could do it, which we can't, you ain't in no fit state to go
back to your home, an' we've jest come on to the Banks, workin' fer our bread.
We don't see the ha'af of a hundred dollars a month, let alone pocket-money;
an' with good luck we'll be ashore again somewheres abaout the first weeks o'
September."</p>
<p>"But&mdash;but it's May now, and I can't stay here doin' nothing just
because you want to fish. I can't, I tell you!"</p>
<p>"Right an' jest; jest an' right. No one asks you to do nothin'. There's a
heap as you can do, for Otto he went overboard on Le Have. I mistrust he lost
his grip in a gale we f'und there. Anyways, he never come back to deny it.
You've turned up, plain, plumb providential for all concerned. I mistrust,
though, there's ruther few things you kin do. Ain't thet so?"</p>
<p>"I can make it lively for you and your crowd when we get ashore," said
Harvey, with a vicious nod, murmuring vague threats about "piracy," at which
Troop almost&mdash;not quite&mdash;smiled.</p>
<p>"Excep' talk. I'd forgot that. You ain't asked to talk more'n you've a mind
to aboard the <i>We're Here</i>. Keep your eyes open, an' help Dan to do ez
he's bid, an' sechlike, an' I'll give you&mdash;you ain't wuth it, but I'll
give&mdash;ten an' a ha'af a month; say thirty-five at the end o' the trip. A
little work will ease up your head, and you kin tell us all abaout your dad an'
your ma an' your money afterwards."</p>
<p>"She's on the steamer," said Harvey, his eyes filling with tears. "Take me
to New York at once."</p>
<p>"Poor woman&mdash;poor woman! When she has you back she'll forgit it all,
though. There's eight of us on the <i>We're Here</i>, an' ef we went back
naow&mdash;it's more'n a thousand mile&mdash;we'd lose the season. The men they
wouldn't hev it, allowin' I was agreeable."</p>
<p>"But my father would make it all right."</p>
<p>"He'd try. I don't doubt he'd try," said Troop; "but a whole season's catch
is eight men's bread; an' you'll be better in your health when you see him in
the fall. Go forward an' help Dan. It's ten an' a ha'af a month, e I said, an'
o' course, all f'und, same e the rest o' us."</p>
<p>"Do you mean I'm to clean pots and pans and things?" said Harvey.</p>
<p>"An' other things. You've no call to shout, young feller."</p>
<p>"I won't! My father will give you enough to buy this dirty little
fish-kettle"&mdash;Harvey stamped on the deck&mdash;"ten times over, if you
take me to New York safe; and&mdash;and&mdash;you're in a hundred and thirty by
me, anyhow."</p>
<p>"Haow?" said Troop, the iron face darkening.</p>
<p>"How? You know how, well enough. On top of all that, you want me to do
menial work"&mdash;Harvey was very proud of that adjective&mdash;"till the
Fall. I tell you I will not. You hear?"</p>
<p>Troop regarded the top of the mainmast with deep interest for a while, as
Harvey harangued fiercely all around him.</p>
<p>"Hsh!" he said at last. "I'm figurin' out my responsibilities in my own
mind. It's a matter o' jedgment."</p>
<p>Dan stole up and plucked Harvey by the elbow. "Don't go to tamperin' with
Dad any more," he pleaded. "You've called him a thief two or three times over,
an' he don't take that from any livin' bein'."</p>
<p>"I won't!" Harvey almost shrieked, disregarding the advice, and still Troop
meditated.</p>
<p>"Seems kinder unneighbourly," he said at last, his eye travelling down to
Harvey. "I&mdash;don't blame you, not a mite, young feeler, nor you won't blame
me when the bile's out o' your systim. Be sure you sense what I say? Ten an' a
ha'af fer second boy on the schooner&mdash;an' all found&mdash;fer to teach you
an' fer the sake o' your health. Yes or no?"</p>
<p>"No!" said Harvey. "Take me back to New York or I'll see you&mdash;"</p>
<p>He did not exactly remember what followed. He was lying in the scuppers,
holding on to a nose that bled while Troop looked down on him serenely.</p>
<p>"Dan," he said to his son, "I was sot agin this young feeler when I first
saw him on account o' hasty jedgments. Never you be led astray by hasty
jedgments, Dan. Naow I'm sorry for him, because he's clear distracted in his
upper works. He ain't responsible fer the names he's give me, nor fer his other
statements&mdash;nor fer jumpin' overboard, which I'm abaout ha'af convinced he
did. You be gentle with him, Dan, 'r I'll give you twice what I've give him.
Them hemmeridges clears the head. Let him sluice it off!"</p>
<p>Troop went down solemnly into the cabin, where he and the older men bunked,
leaving Dan to comfort the luckless heir to thirty millions.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>"I warned ye," said Dan, as the drops fell thick and fast on the dark, oiled
planking. "Dad ain't noways hasty, but you fair earned it. Pshaw! there's no
sense takin' on so." Harvey's shoulders were rising and falling in spasms of
dry sobbing. "I know the feelin'. First time Dad laid me out was the
last&mdash;and that was my first trip. Makes ye feel sickish an' lonesome. I
know."</p>
<p>"It does," moaned Harvey. "That man's either crazy or drunk, and&mdash;and I
can't do anything."</p>
<p>"Don't say that to Dad," whispered Dan. "He's set agin all liquor,
an'&mdash;well, he told me you was the madman. What in creation made you call
him a thief? He's my dad."</p>
<p>Harvey sat up, mopped his nose, and told the story of the missing wad of
bills. "I'm not crazy," he wound up. "Only&mdash;your father has never seen
more than a five-dollar bill at a time, and my father could buy up this boat
once a week and never miss it."</p>
<p>"You don't know what the <i>We're Here's</i> worth. Your dad must hev a pile
o' money. How did he git it? Dad sez loonies can't shake out a straight yarn.
Go ahead."</p>
<p>"In gold mines and things, West."</p>
<p>"I've read o' that kind o' business. Out West, too? Does he go around with a
pistol on a trick-pony, same ez the circus? They call that the Wild West, and
I've heard that their spurs an' bridles was solid silver."</p>
<p>"You are a chump!" said Harvey, amused in spite of himself. "My father
hasn't any use for ponies. When he wants to ride he takes his car."</p>
<p>"Haow? Lobster-car?"</p>
<p>"No. His own private car, of course. You've seen a private car some time in
your life?"</p>
<p>"Slatin Beeman he hez one," said Dan, cautiously. "I saw her at the Union
Depot in Boston, with three niggers hoggin' her run." (Dan meant cleaning the
windows.) "But Slatin Beeman he owns 'baout every railroad on Long Island, they
say, an' they say he's bought 'baout ha'af Noo Hampshire an' run a line fence
around her, an' filled her up with lions an' tigers an' bears an' buffalo an'
crocodiles an' such all. Slatin Beeman he's a millionaire. I've seen his car.
Yes?"</p>
<p>"Well, my father's what they call a multi-millionaire, and he has two
private cars. One's named for me, the 'Harvey', and one for my mother, the
'Constance'."</p>
<p>"Hold on," said Dan. "Dad don't ever let me swear, but I guess you can.
'Fore we go ahead, I want you to say hope you may die if you're lyin'."</p>
<p>"Of course," said Harvey.</p>
<p>"The ain't 'niff. Say, 'Hope I may die if I ain't speaking' truth.'"</p>
<p>"Hope I may die right here," said Harvey, "if every word I've spoken isn't
the cold truth."</p>
<p>"Hundred an' thirty-four dollars an' all?" said Dan. "I heard ye talkin' to
Dad, an' I ha'af looked you'd be swallered up, same's Jonah."</p>
<p>Harvey protested himself red in the face. Dan was a shrewd young person
along his own lines, and ten minutes' questioning convinced him that Harvey was
not lying&mdash;much. Besides, he had bound himself by the most terrible oath
known to boyhood, and yet he sat, alive, with a red-ended nose, in the
scuppers, recounting marvels upon marvels.</p>
<p>"Gosh!" said Dan at last from the very bottom of his soul when Harvey had
completed an inventory of the car named in his honour. Then a grin of
mischievous delight overspread his broad face. "I believe you, Harvey. Dad's
made a mistake fer once in his life."</p>
<p>"He has, sure," said Harvey, who was meditating an early revenge.</p>
<p>"He'll be mad clear through. Dad jest hates to be mistook in his jedgments."
Dan lay back and slapped his thigh. "Oh, Harvey, don't you spile the catch by
lettin' on."</p>
<p>"I don't want to be knocked down again. I'll get even with him, though."</p>
<p>"Never heard any man ever got even with dad. But he'd knock ye down again
sure. The more he was mistook the more he'd do it. But gold-mines and
pistols&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I never said a word about pistols," Harvey cut in, for he was on his
oath.</p>
<p>"Thet's so; no more you did. Two private cars, then, one named fer you an'
one fer her; an' two hundred dollars a month pocket-money, all knocked into the
scuppers fer not workin' fer ten an' a ha'af a month! It's the top haul o' the
season." He exploded with noiseless chuckles.</p>
<p>"Then I was right?" said Harvey, who thought he had found a sympathiser.</p>
<p>"You was wrong; the wrongest kind o' wrong! You take right hold an' pitch in
'longside o' me, or you'll catch it, an' I'll catch it fer backin' you up. Dad
always gives me double helps 'cause I'm his son, an' he hates favourin' folk.
'Guess you're kinder mad at dad. I've been that way time an' again. But dad's a
mighty jest man; all the fleet says so."</p>
<p>"Looks like justice, this, don't it?" Harvey pointed to his outraged
nose.</p>
<p>"Thet's nothin'. Lets the shore blood outer you. Dad did it for yer health.
Say, though, I can't have dealin's with a man that thinks me or dad or any one
on the <i>We're Here's</i> a thief. We ain't any common wharf-end crowd by any
manner o' means. We're fishermen, an' we've shipped together for six years an'
more. Don't you make any mistake on that! I told ye dad don't let me swear. He
calls 'em vain oaths, and pounds me; but ef I could say what you said 'baout
your pap an' his fixin's, I'd say that 'baout your dollars. I dunno what was in
your pockets when I dried your kit, fer I didn't look to see; but I'd say,
using the very same words ez you used jest now, neither me nor dad&mdash;an' we
was the only two that teched you after you was brought aboard&mdash;knows
anythin' 'baout the money. Thet's my say. Naow?"</p>
<p>The bloodletting had certainly cleared Harvey's brain, and maybe the
loneliness of the sea had something to do with it. "That's all right," he said.
Then he looked down confusedly. "'Seems to me that for a fellow just saved from
drowning I haven't been over and above grateful, Dan."</p>
<p>"Well, you was shook up and silly," said Dan. "Anyway, there was only dad
an' me aboard to see it. The cook he don't count."</p>
<p>"I might have thought about losing the bills that way," Harvey said, half to
himself, "instead of calling everybody in sight a thief. Where's your
father?"</p>
<p>"In the cabin. What d' you want o' him again?"</p>
<p>"You'll see," said Harvey, and he stepped, rather groggily, for his head was
still singing, to the cabin steps where the little ship's clock hung in plain
sight of the wheel. Troop, in the chocolate-and-yellow painted cabin, was busy
with a note-book and an enormous black pencil which he sucked hard from time to
time.</p>
<p>"I haven't acted quite right," said Harvey, surprised at his own
meekness.</p>
<p>"What's wrong naow?" said the skipper. "Walked into Dan, hev ye?"</p>
<p>"No; it's about you."</p>
<p>"I'm here to listen."</p>
<p>"Well, I&mdash;I'm here to take things back," said Harvey very quickly.
"When a man's saved from drowning&mdash;" he gulped.</p>
<p>"Ey? You'll make a man yet ef you go on this way."</p>
<p>"He oughtn't begin by calling people names."</p>
<p>"Jest an' right&mdash;right an' jest," said Troop, with the ghost of a dry
smile.</p>
<p>"So I'm here to say I'm sorry." Another big gulp.</p>
<p>Troop heaved himself slowly off the locker he was sitting on and held out an
eleven-inch hand. "I mistrusted 'twould do you sights o' good; an' this shows I
weren't mistook in my jedgments." A smothered chuckle on deck caught his ear.
"I am very seldom mistook in my jedgments." The eleven-inch hand closed on
Harvey's, numbing it to the elbow. "We'll put a little more gristle to that
'fore we've done with you, young feller; an' I don't think any worse of ye fer
anythin' the's gone by. You wasn't fairly responsible. Go right abaout your
business an' you won't take no hurt."</p>
<p>"You're white," said Dan, as Harvey regained the deck, flushed to the tips
of his ears.</p>
<p>"I don't feel it," said he.</p>
<p>"I didn't mean that way. I heard what Dad said. When Dad allows he don't
think the worse of any man, Dad's give himself away. He hates to be mistook in
his jedgments too. Ho! ho! Onct Dad has a jedgment, he'd sooner dip his colours
to the British than change it. I'm glad it's settled right eend up. Dad's right
when he says he can't take you back. It's all the livin' we make
here&mdash;fishin'. The men'll be back like sharks after a dead whale in ha'af
an hour."</p>
<p>"What for?" said Harvey.</p>
<p>"Supper, o' course. Don't your stummick tell you? You've a heap to
learn."</p>
<p>"Guess I have," said Harvey, dolefully, looking at the tangle of ropes and
blocks overhead.</p>
<p>"She's a daisy," said Dan, enthusiastically, misunderstanding the look.
"Wait till our mainsail's bent, an' she walks home with all her salt wet.
There's some work first, though." He pointed down into the darkness of the open
main-hatch between the two masts.</p>
<p>"What's that for? It's all empty," said Harvey.</p>
<p>"You an' me an' a few more hev got to fill it," said Dan. "That's where the
fish goes."</p>
<p>"Alive?" said Harvey.</p>
<p>"Well, no. They're so's to be ruther dead&mdash;an' flat&mdash;an' salt.
There's a hundred hogshead o' salt in the bins, an' we hain't more'n covered
our dunnage to now."</p>
<p>"Where are the fish, though?"</p>
<p>"'In the sea they say, in the boats we pray,'" said Dan, quoting a
fisherman's proverb. "You come in last night with 'baout forty of 'em."</p>
<p>He pointed to a sort of wooden pen just in front of the quarter-deck.</p>
<p>"You an' me we'll sluice that out when they're through. 'Send we'll hev full
pens to-night! I've seen her down ha'af a foot with fish waitin' to clean, an'
we stood to the tables till we was splittin' ourselves instid o' them, we was
so sleepy. Yes, they're comm' in naow." Dan looked over the low bulwarks at
half a dozen dories rowing towards them over the shining, silky sea.</p>
<p>"I've never seen the sea from so low down," said Harvey. "It's fine."</p>
<p>The low sun made the water all purple and pinkish, with golden lights on the
barrels of the long swells, and blue and green mackerel shades in the hollows.
Each schooner in sight seemed to be pulling her dories towards her by invisible
strings, and the little black figures in the tiny boats pulled like clockwork
toys.</p>
<p>"They've struck on good," said Dan, between his half-shut eyes. "Manuel
hain't room fer another fish. Low ez a lily-pad in still water, Aeneid he?"</p>
<p>"Which is Manuel? I don't see how you can tell 'em 'way off, as you do."</p>
<p>"Last boat to the south'ard. He fund you last night," said Dan, pointing.
"Manuel rows Portugoosey; ye can't mistake him. East o' him&mdash;he's a heap
better'n he rows&mdash;is Pennsylvania. Loaded with saleratus, by the looks of
him. East o' him&mdash;see how pretty they string out all along&mdash;with the
humpy shoulders, is Long Jack. He's a Galway man inhabitin' South Boston, where
they all live mostly, an' mostly them Galway men are good in a boat. North,
away yonder&mdash;you'll hear him tune up in a minute is Tom Platt.
Man-o'-war's man he was on the old Ohio first of our navy, he says, to go
araound the Horn. He never talks of much else, 'cept when he sings, but he has
fair fishin' luck. There! What did I tell you?"</p>
<p>A melodious bellow stole across the water from the northern dory. Harvey
heard something about somebody's hands and feet being cold, and then:</p>
<blockquote>"Bring forth the chart, the doleful chart,<br>
See where them mountings meet!<br>
The clouds are thick around their heads,<br>
The mists around their feet."</blockquote>
<p>"Full boat," said Dan, with a chuckle. "If he give us 'O Captain' it's
topping' too!"</p>
<p>The bellow continued:</p>
<blockquote>"And naow to thee, O Capting,<br>
Most earnestly I pray,<br>
That they shall never bury me<br>
In church or cloister gray."</blockquote>
<p>"Double game for Tom Platt. He'll tell you all about the old Ohio tomorrow.
'See that blue dory behind him? He's my uncle,&mdash;Dad's own
brother,&mdash;an' ef there's any bad luck loose on the Banks she'll fetch up
agin Uncle Salters, sure. Look how tender he's rowin'. I'll lay my wage and
share he's the only man stung up to-day&mdash;an' he's stung up good."</p>
<p>"What'll sting him?" said Harvey, getting interested.</p>
<p>"Strawberries, mostly. Pumpkins, sometimes, an' sometimes lemons an'
cucumbers. Yes, he's stung up from his elbows down. That man's luck's perfectly
paralyzin'. Naow we'll take a-holt o' the tackles an' hist 'em in. Is it true
what you told me jest now, that you never done a hand's turn o' work in all
your born life? Must feel kinder awful, don't it?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to try to work, anyway," Harvey replied stoutly. "Only it's all
dead new."</p>
<p>"Lay a-holt o' that tackle, then. Behind ye!"</p>
<p>Harvey grabbed at a rope and long iron hook dangling from one of the stays
of the mainmast, while Dan pulled down another that ran from something he
called a "topping-lift," as Manuel drew alongside in his loaded dory. The
Portuguese smiled a brilliant smile that Harvey learned to know well later, and
with a short-handled fork began to throw fish into the pen on deck. "Two
hundred and thirty-one," he shouted.</p>
<p>"Give him the hook," said Dan, and Harvey ran it into Manuel's hands. He
slipped it through a loop of rope at the dory's bow, caught Dan's tackle,
hooked it to the stern-becket, and clambered into the schooner.</p>
<p>"Pull!" shouted Dan, and Harvey pulled, astonished to find how easily the
dory rose.</p>
<p>"Hold on, she don't nest in the crosstrees!" Dan laughed; and Harvey held
on, for the boat lay in the air above his head.</p>
<p>"Lower away," Dan shouted, and as Harvey lowered, Dan swayed the light boat
with one hand till it landed softly just behind the mainmast. "They don't weigh
nothin' empty. Thet was right smart fer a passenger. There's more trick to it
in a sea-way."</p>
<p>"Ah ha!" said Manuel, holding out a brown hand. "You are some pretty well
now? This time last night the fish they fish for you. Now you fish for fish.
Eh, wha-at?"</p>
<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm ever so grateful," Harvey stammered, and his unfortunate hand
stole to his pocket once more, but he remembered that he had no money to offer.
When he knew Manuel better the mere thought of the mistake he might have made
would cover him with hot, uneasy blushes in his bunk.</p>
<p>"There is no to be thankful for to me!" said Manuel. "How shall I leave you
dreeft, dreeft all around the Banks? Now you are a fisherman eh, wha-at? Ouh!
Auh!" He bent backward and forward stiffly from the hips to get the kinks out
of himself.</p>
<p>"I have not cleaned boat to-day. Too busy. They struck on queek. Danny, my
son, clean for me."</p>
<p>Harvey moved forward at once. Here was something he could do for the man who
had saved his life.</p>
<p>Dan threw him a swab, and he leaned over the dory, mopping up the slime
clumsily, but with great good-will. "Hike out the foot-boards; they slide in
them grooves," said Dan. "Swab 'em an' lay 'em down. Never let a foot-board
jam. Ye may want her bad some day. Here's Long Jack."</p>
<p>A stream of glittering fish flew into the pen from a dory alongside.</p>
<p>"Manuel, you take the tackle. I'll fix the tables. Harvey, clear Manuel's
boat. Long Jack's nestin' on the top of her."</p>
<p>Harvey looked up from his swabbing at the bottom of another dory just above
his head.</p>
<p>"Jest like the Injian puzzle-boxes, ain't they?" said Dan, as the one boat
dropped into the other.</p>
<p>"Takes to ut like a duck to water," said Long Jack, a grizzly-chinned,
long-lipped Galway man, bending to and fro exactly as Manuel had done. Disko in
the cabin growled up the hatchway, and they could hear him suck his pencil.</p>
<p>"Wan hunder an' forty-nine an' a half-bad luck to ye, Discobolus!" said Long
Jack. "I'm murderin' meself to fill your pockuts. Slate ut for a bad catch. The
Portugee has bate me."</p>
<p>Whack came another dory alongside, and more fish shot into the pen.</p>
<p>"Two hundred and three. Let's look at the passenger!" The speaker was even
larger than the Galway man, and his face was made curious by a purple cut
running slant-ways from his left eye to the right corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>Not knowing what else to do, Harvey swabbed each dory as it came down,
pulled out the foot-boards, and laid them in the bottom of the boat.</p>
<p>"He's caught on good," said the scarred man, who was Toni Platt, watching
him critically. "There are two ways o' doin' everything. One's
fisher-fashion&mdash;any end first an' a slippery hitch over all&mdash;an' the
other's&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What we did on the old Ohio!" Dan interrupted, brushing into the knot of
men with a long board on legs. "Get out o' here, Tom Platt, an' leave me fix
the tables."</p>
<p>He jammed one end of the board into two nicks in the bulwarks, kicked out
the leg, and ducked just in time to avoid a swinging blow from the man-o'-war's
man.</p>
<p>"An' they did that on the Ohio, too, Danny. See?" said Tom Platt,
laughing.</p>
<p>"Guess they was swivel-eyed, then, fer it didn't git home, and I know who'll
find his boots on the main-truck ef he don't leave us alone. Haul ahead! I'm
busy, can't ye see?"</p>
<p>"Danny, ye lie on the cable an' sleep all day," said Long Jack. "You're the
hoight av impidence, an' I'm persuaded ye'll corrupt our supercargo in a
week."</p>
<p>"His name's Harvey," said Dan, waving two strangely shaped knives, "an'
he'll be worth five of any Sou' Boston clam-digger 'fore long." He laid the
knives tastefully on the table, cocked his head on one side, and admired the
effect.</p>
<p>"I think it's forty-two," said a small voice overside, and there was a roar
of laughter as another voice answered, "Then my luck's turned fer onct, 'caze
I'm forty-five, though I be stung outer all shape."</p>
<p>"Forty-two or forty-five. I've lost count," the small voice said.</p>
<p>"It's Penn an' Uncle Salters caountin' catch. This beats the circus any
day," said Dan. "Jest look at 'em!"</p>
<p>"Come in&mdash;come in!" roared Long Jack. "It's wet out yondher,
children."</p>
<p>"Forty-two, ye said." This was Uncle Salters.</p>
<p>"I'll count again, then," the voice replied meekly. The two dories swung
together and bunted into the schooner's side.</p>
<p>"Patience o' Jerusalem!" snapped Uncle Salters, backing water with a splash.
"What possest a farmer like you to set foot in a boat beats me. You've nigh
stove me all up."</p>
<p>"I am sorry, Mr. Salters. I came to sea on account of nervous dyspepsia. You
advised me, I think."</p>
<p>"You an' your nervis dyspepsy be drowned in the Whale-hole," roared Uncle
Salters, a fat and tubby little man. "You're comin' down on me agin. Did ye say
forty-two or forty-five?"</p>
<p>"I've forgotten, Mr. Salters. Let's count."</p>
<p>"Don't see as it could be forty-five. I'm forty-five," said Uncle Salters.
"You count keerful, Penn."</p>
<p>Disko Troop came out of the cabin. "Salters, you pitch your fish in naow at
once," he said in the tone of authority.</p>
<p>"Don't spile the catch, Dad," Dan murmured. "Them two are on'y jest
beginnin'."</p>
<p>"Mother av delight! He's forkin' them wan by wan," howled Long Jack, as
Uncle Salters got to work laboriously; the little man in the other dory
counting a line of notches on the gunwale.</p>
<p>"That was last week's catch," he said, looking up plaintively, his
forefinger where he had left off.</p>
<p>Manuel nudged Dan, who darted to the after-tackle, and, leaning far
overside, slipped the hook into the stern-rope as Manuel made her fast forward.
The others pulled gallantly and swung the boat in&mdash;man, fish, and all.</p>
<p>"One, two, four-nine," said Tom Platt, counting with a practised eye.
"Forty-seven. Penn, you're it!" Dan let the after-tackle run, and slid him out
of the stern on to the deck amid a torrent of his own fish.</p>
<p>"Hold on!" roared Uncle Salters, bobbing by the waist. "Hold on, I'm a bit
mixed in my caount."</p>
<p>He had no time to protest, but was hove inboard and treated like
"Pennsylvania."</p>
<p>"Forty-one," said Tom Platt. "Beat by a farmer, Salters. An' you sech a
sailor, too!"</p>
<p>"'Tweren't fair caount," said he, stumbling out of the pen; "an' I'm stung
up all to pieces."</p>
<p>His thick hands were puffy and mottled purply white.</p>
<p>"Some folks will find strawberry-bottom," said Dan, addressing the newly
risen moon, "ef they hev to dive fer it, seems to me."</p>
<p>"An' others," said Uncle Salters, "eats the fat o' the land in sloth, an'
mocks their own blood-kin."</p>
<p>"Seat ye! Seat ye!" a voice Harvey had not heard called from the foc'sle.
Disko Troop, Tom Platt, Long Jack, and Salters went forward on the word. Little
Penn bent above his square deep-sea reel and the tangled cod-lines; Manuel lay
down full length on the deck, and Dan dropped into the hold, where Harvey heard
him banging casks with a hammer.</p>
<p>"Salt," he said, returning. "Soon as we're through supper we git to
dressing-down. You'll pitch to Dad. Tom Platt an' Dad they stow together, an'
you'll hear 'em arguin'. We're second ha'af, you an' me an' Manuel an'
Penn&mdash;the youth an' beauty o' the boat."</p>
<p>"What's the good of that?" said Harvey. "I'm hungry."</p>
<p>"They'll be through in a minute. Suff! She smells good to-night. Dad ships a
good cook ef he do suffer with his brother. It's a full catch today, Aeneid
it?" He pointed at the pens piled high with cod. "What water did ye hev,
Manuel?"</p>
<p>"Twenty-fife father," said the Portuguese, sleepily. "They strike on good
an' queek. Some day I show you, Harvey."</p>
<p>The moon was beginning to walk on the still sea before the elder men came
aft. The cook had no need to cry "second half." Dan and Manuel were down the
hatch and at table ere Tom Platt, last and most deliberate of the elders, had
finished wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. Harvey followed Penn, and
sat down before a tin pan of cod's tongues and sounds, mixed with scraps of
pork and fried potato, a loaf of hot bread, and some black and powerful coffee.
Hungry as they were, they waited while "Pennsylvania" solemnly asked a
blessing. Then they stoked in silence till Dan drew a breath over his tin cup
and demanded of Harvey how he felt.</p>
<p>"'Most full, but there's just room for another piece."</p>
<p>The cook was a huge, jet-black negro, and, unlike all the negroes Harvey had
met, did not talk, contenting himself with smiles and dumb-show invitations to
eat more.</p>
<p>"See, Harvey," said Dan, rapping with his fork on the table, "it's jest as I
said. The young an' handsome men&mdash;like me an' Pennsy an' you an'
Manuel&mdash;we're second ha'af, an' we eats when the first ha'af are through.
They're the old fish; an' they're mean an' humpy, an' their stummicks has to be
humoured; so they come first, which they don't deserve. Aeneid that so,
doctor?"</p>
<p>The cook nodded.</p>
<p>"Can't he talk?" said Harvey in a whisper.</p>
<p>"'Nough to get along. Not much o' anything we know. His natural tongue's
kinder curious. Comes from the innards of Cape Breton, he does, where the
farmers speak homemade Scotch. Cape Breton's full o' niggers whose folk run in
there durin' aour war, an' they talk like farmers&mdash;all huffy-chuffy."</p>
<p>"That is not Scotch," said "Pennsylvania. "That is Gaelic. So I read in a
book."</p>
<p>"Penn reads a heap. Most of what he says is so&mdash;'cep' when it comes to
a caount o' fish&mdash;eh?"</p>
<p>"Does your father just let them say how many they've caught without checking
them?" said Harvey.</p>
<p>"Why, yes. Where's the sense of a man lyin' fer a few old cod?"</p>
<p>"Was a man once lied for his catch," Manuel put in. "Lied every day. Fife,
ten, twenty-fife more fish than come he say there was."</p>
<p>"Where was that?" said Dan. "None o' aour folk."</p>
<p>"Frenchman of Anguille."</p>
<p>"Ah! Them West Shore Frenchmen don't caount anyway. Stands to reason they
can't caount. Ef you run acrost any of their soft hooks, Harvey, you'll know
why," said Dan, with an awful contempt.</p>
<blockquote>"Always more and never less,<br>
Every time we come to dress,"</blockquote>
<p>Long Jack roared down the hatch, and the "second ha'af" scrambled up at
once.</p>
<p>The shadow of the masts and rigging, with the never-furled riding-sail,
rolled to and fro on the heaving deck in the moonlight; and the pile of fish by
the stern shone like a dump of fluid silver. In the hold there were tramplings
and rumblings where Disko Troop and Tom Platt moved among the salt-bins. Dan
passed Harvey a pitchfork, and led him to the inboard end of the rough table,
where Uncle Salters was drumming impatiently with a knife-haft. A tub of salt
water lay at his feet.</p>
<p>"You pitch to dad an' Tom Platt down the hatch, an' take keer Uncle Salters
don't cut yer eye out," said Dan, swinging himself into the hold. "I'll pass
salt below."</p>
<p>Penn and Manuel stood knee deep among cod in the pen, flourishing drawn
knives. Long Jack, a basket at his feet and mittens on his hands, faced Uncle
Salters at the table, and Harvey stared at the pitchfork and the tub.</p>
<p>"Hi!" shouted Manuel, stooping to the fish, and bringing one up with a
finger under its gill and a finger in its eyes. He laid it on the edge of the
pen; the knife-blade glimmered with a sound of tearing, and the fish, slit from
throat to vent, with a nick on either side of the neck, dropped at Long Jack's
feet.</p>
<p>"Hi!" said Long Jack, with a scoop of his mittened hand. The cod's liver
dropped in the basket. Another wrench and scoop sent the head and offal flying,
and the empty fish slid across to Uncle Salters, who snorted fiercely. There
was another sound of tearing, the backbone flew over the bulwarks, and the
fish, headless, gutted, and open, splashed in the tub, sending the salt water
into Harvey's astonished mouth. After the first yell, the men were silent. The
cod moved along as though they were alive, and long ere Harvey had ceased
wondering at the miraculous dexterity of it all, his tub was full.</p>
<p>"Pitch!" grunted Uncle Salters, without turning his head, and Harvey pitched
the fish by twos and threes down the hatch.</p>
<p>"Hi! Pitch 'em bunchy," shouted Dan. "Don't scatter! Uncle Salters is the
best splitter in the fleet. Watch him mind his book!"</p>
<p>Indeed, it looked a little as though the round uncle were cutting magazine
pages against time. Manuel's body, cramped over from the hips, stayed like a
statue; but his long arms grabbed the fish without ceasing. Little Penn toiled
valiantly, but it was easy to see he was weak. Once or twice Manuel found time
to help him without breaking the chain of supplies, and once Manuel howled
because he had caught his finger in a Frenchman's hook. These hooks are made of
soft metal, to be rebent after use; but the cod very often get away with them
and are hooked again elsewhere; and that is one of the many reasons why the
Gloucester boats despise the Frenchmen.</p>
<p>Down below, the rasping sound of rough salt rubbed on rough flesh sounded
like the whirring of a grindstone&mdash;steady undertune to the "click-nick" of
knives in the pen; the wrench and shloop of torn heads, dropped liver, and
flying offal; the "caraaah" of Uncle Salters's knife scooping away backbones;
and the flap of wet, open bodies falling into the tub.</p>
<p>At the end of an hour Harvey would have given the world to rest; for fresh,
wet cod weigh more than you would think, and his back ached with the steady
pitching. But he felt for the first time in his life that he was one of the
working gang of men, took pride in the thought, and held on sullenly.</p>
<p>"Knife oh!" shouted Uncle Salters at last. Penn doubled up, gasping among
the fish, Manuel bowed back and forth to supple himself, and Long Jack leaned
over the bulwarks. The cook appeared, noiseless as a black shadow, collected a
mass of backbones and heads, and retreated.</p>
<p>"Blood-ends for breakfast an' head-chowder," said Long Jack, smacking his
lips.</p>
<p>"Knife oh!" repeated Uncle Salters, waving the flat, curved splitter's
weapon.</p>
<p>"Look by your foot, Harve," cried Dan below.</p>
<p>Harvey saw half a dozen knives stuck in a cleat in the hatch combing. He
dealt these around, taking over the dulled ones.</p>
<p>"Water!" said Disko Troop.</p>
<p>"Scuttle-butt's for'ard an' the dipper's alongside. Hurry, Harve," said
Dan.</p>
<p>He was back in a minute with a big dipperful of stale brown water which
tasted like nectar, and loosed the jaws of Disko and Tom Platt.</p>
<p>"These are cod," said Disko. "They ain't Damarskus figs, Tom Platt, nor yet
silver bars. I've told you that ever single time since we've sailed
together."</p>
<p>"A matter o' seven seasons," returned Tom Platt coolly. "Good stowin's good
stowin' all the same, an' there's a right an' a wrong way o' stowin' ballast
even. If you'd ever seen four hundred ton o' iron set into the&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Hi!" With a yell from Manuel the work began again, and never stopped till
the pen was empty. The instant the last fish was down, Disko Troop rolled aft
to the cabin with his brother; Manuel and Long Jack went forward; Tom Platt
only waited long enough to slide home the hatch ere he too disappeared. In half
a minute Harvey heard deep snores in the cabin, and he was staring blankly at
Dan and Penn.</p>
<p>"I did a little better that time, Danny," said Penn, whose eyelids were
heavy with sleep. "But I think it is my duty to help clean."</p>
<p>"'Wouldn't hev your conscience fer a thousand quintal," said Dan. "Turn in,
Penn. You've no call to do boy's work. Draw a bucket, Harvey. Oh, Penn, dump
these in the gurry-butt 'fore you sleep. Kin you keep awake that long?"</p>
<p>Penn took up the heavy basket of fish-livers, emptied them into a cask with
a hinged top lashed by the foc'sle; then he too dropped out of sight in the
cabin.</p>
<p>"Boys clean up after dressin' down an' first watch in ca'am weather is boy's
watch on the <i>We're Here</i>." Dan sluiced the pen energetically, unshipped
the table, set it up to dry in the moonlight, ran the red knife-blades through
a wad of oakum, and began to sharpen them on a tiny grindstone, as Harvey threw
offal and backbones overboard under his direction.</p>
<p>At the first splash a silvery-white ghost rose bolt upright from the oily
water and sighed a weird whistling sigh. Harvey started back with a shout, but
Dan only laughed.</p>
<p>"Grampus," said he. "Beggin' fer fish-heads. They up-eend the way when
they're hungry. Breath on him like the doleful tombs, hain't he?" A horrible
stench of decayed fish filled the air as the pillar of white sank, and the
water bubbled oilily. "Hain't ye never seen a grampus up-eend before? You'll
see 'em by hundreds 'fore ye're through. Say, it's good to hev a boy aboard
again. Otto was too old, an' a Dutchy at that. Him an' me we fought consid'ble.
'Wouldn't ha' keered fer that ef he'd hed a Christian tongue in his head.
Sleepy?"</p>
<p>"Dead sleepy," said Harvey, nodding forward.</p>
<p>"Mustn't sleep on watch. Rouse up an' see ef our anchor-light's bright an'
shinin'. You're on watch now, Harve."</p>
<p>"Pshaw! What's to hurt us? Bright's day. Sn-orrr!"</p>
<p>"Jest when things happen, Dad says. Fine weather's good sleepin', an' 'fore
you know, mebbe, you're cut in two by a liner, an' seventeen brass-bound
officers, all gen'elmen, lift their hand to it that your lights was aout an'
there was a thick fog. Harve, I've kinder took to you, but ef you nod onct more
I'll lay into you with a rope's end."</p>
<p>The moon, who sees many strange things on the Banks, looked down on a slim
youth in knickerbockers and a red jersey, staggering around the cluttered decks
of a seventy-ton schooner, while behind him, waving a knotted rope, walked,
after the manner of an executioner, a boy who yawned and nodded between the
blows he dealt.</p>
<p>The lashed wheel groaned and kicked softly, the riding-sail slatted a little
in the shifts of the light wind, the windlass creaked, and the miserable
procession continued. Harvey expostulated, threatened, whimpered, and at last
wept outright, while Dan, the words clotting on his tongue, spoke of the beauty
of watchfulness and slashed away with the rope's end, punishing the dories as
often as he hit Harvey. At last the clock in the cabin struck ten, and upon the
tenth stroke little Penn crept on deck. He found two boys in two tumbled heaps
side by side on the main hatch, so deeply asleep that he actually rolled them
to their berths.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>It was the forty-fathom slumber that clears the soul and eye and heart, and
sends you to breakfast ravening. They emptied a big tin dish of juicy fragments
of fish&mdash;the blood-ends the cook had collected overnight. They cleaned up
the plates and pans of the elder mess, who were out fishing, sliced pork for
the midday meal, swabbed down the foc'sle, filled the lamps, drew coal and
water for the cook, and investigated the fore-hold, where the boat's stores
were stacked. It was another perfect day&mdash;soft, mild, and clear; and
Harvey breathed to the very bottom of his lungs.</p>
<p>More schooners had crept up in the night, and the long blue seas were full
of sails and dories. Far away on the horizon, the smoke of some liner, her hull
invisible, smudged the blue, and to eastward a big ship's top-gallant sails,
just lifting, made a square nick in it. Disko Troop was smoking by the roof of
the cabin&mdash;one eye on the craft around, and the other on the little fly at
the main-mast-head.</p>
<p>"When Dad kerflummoxes that way," said Dan in a whisper, "he's doin' some
high-line thinkin' fer all hands. I'll lay my wage an' share we'll make berth
soon. Dad he knows the cod, an' the Fleet they know Dad knows. 'See 'em comm'
up one by one, lookin' fer nothin' in particular, o' course, but scrowgin' on
us all the time? There's the <i>Prince Leboo</i>; she's a Chat-ham boat. She's
crep' up sence last night. An' see that big one with a patch in her foresail
an' a new jib? She's the <i>Carrie Pitman</i> from West Chat-ham. She won't
keep her canvas long onless her luck's changed since last season. She don't do
much 'cep' drift. There ain't an anchor made 'll hold her...When the smoke
puffs up in little rings like that, Dad's studyin' the fish. Ef we speak to him
now, he'll git mad. Las' time I did, he jest took an' hove a boot at me."</p>
<p>Disko Troop stared forward, the pipe between his teeth, with eyes that saw
nothing. As his son said, he was studying the fish&mdash;pitting his knowledge
and experience on the Banks against the roving cod in his own sea. He accepted
the presence of the inquisitive schooners on the horizon as a compliment to his
powers. But now that it was paid, he wished to draw away and make his berth
alone, till it was time to go up to the Virgin and fish in the streets of that
roaring town upon the waters. So Disko Troop thought of recent weather, and
gales, currents, food-supplies, and other domestic arrangements, from the point
of view of a twenty-pound cod; was, in fact, for an hour a cod himself, and
looked remarkably like one. Then he removed the pipe from his teeth.</p>
<p>"Dad," said Dan, "we've done our chores. Can't we go overside a piece? It's
good catchin' weather."</p>
<p>"Not in that cherry-coloured rig ner them ha'af baked brown shoes. Give him
suthin' fit to wear."</p>
<p>"Dad's pleased&mdash;that settles it," said Dan, delightedly, dragging
Harvey into the cabin, while Troop pitched a key down the steps. "Dad keeps my
spare rig where he kin overhaul it, 'cause Ma sez I'm keerless." He rummaged
through a locker, and in less than three minutes Harvey was adorned with
fisherman's rubber boots that came half up his thigh, a heavy blue jersey well
darned at the elbows, a pair of nippers, and a sou'wester.</p>
<p>"Naow ye look somethin' like," said Dan. "Hurry!"</p>
<p>"Keep nigh an' handy," said Troop "an' don't go visitin' raound the Fleet.
If any one asks you what I'm cal'latin' to do, speak the truth&mdash;fer ye
don't know."</p>
<p>A little red dory, labelled Hattie S., lay astern of the schooner. Dan
hauled in the painter, and dropped lightly on to the bottom boards, while
Harvey tumbled clumsily after.</p>
<p>"That's no way o' gettin' into a boat," said Dan. "Ef there was any sea
you'd go to the bottom, sure. You got to learn to meet her."</p>
<p>Dan fitted the thole-pins, took the forward thwart and watched Harvey's
work. The boy had rowed, in a lady-like fashion, on the Adirondack ponds; but
there is a difference between squeaking pins and well-balanced
ruflocks&mdash;light sculls and stubby, eight-foot sea-oars. They stuck in the
gentle swell, and Harvey grunted.</p>
<p>"Short! Row short!" said Dan. "Ef you cramp your oar in any kind o' sea
you're liable to turn her over. Ain't she a daisy? Mine, too."</p>
<p>The little dory was specklessly clean. In her bows lay a tiny anchor, two
jugs of water, and some seventy fathoms of thin, brown dory-roding. A tin
dinner-horn rested in cleats just under Harvey's right hand, beside an
ugly-looking maul, a short gaff, and a shorter wooden stick. A couple of lines,
with very heavy leads and double cod-hooks, all neatly coiled on square reels,
were stuck in their place by the gunwale.</p>
<p>"Where's the sail and mast?" said Harvey, for his hands were beginning to
blister.</p>
<p>Dan chuckled. "Ye don't sail fishin'-dories much. Ye pull; but ye needn't
pull so hard. Don't you wish you owned her?"</p>
<p>"Well, I guess my father might give me one or two if I asked 'em," Harvey
replied. He had been too busy to think much of his family till then.</p>
<p>"That's so. I forgot your dad's a millionaire. You don't act millionary any,
naow. But a dory an' craft an' gear"&mdash;Dan spoke as though she were a
whaleboat&mdash;"costs a heap. Think your dad 'u'd give you one fer&mdash;fer a
pet like?"</p>
<p>"Shouldn't wonder. It would be 'most the only thing I haven't stuck him for
yet."</p>
<p>"Must be an expensive kinder kid to home. Don't slitheroo thet way, Harve.
Short's the trick, because no sea's ever dead still, an' the swells
'll&mdash;"</p>
<p>Crack! The loom of the oar kicked Harvey under the chin and knocked him
backwards.</p>
<p>"That was what I was goin' to say. I hed to learn too, but I wasn't more
than eight years old when I got my schoolin'."</p>
<p>Harvey regained his seat with aching jaws and a frown.</p>
<p>"No good gettin' mad at things, Dad says. It's our own fault ef we can't
handle 'em, he says. Le's try here. Manuel 'll give us the water."</p>
<p>The "Portugee" was rocking fully a mile away, but when Dan up-ended an oar
he waved his left arm three times.</p>
<p>"Thirty fathom," said Dan, stringing a salt clam on to the hook. "Over with
the doughboys. Bait same's I do, Harvey, an' don't snarl your reel."</p>
<p>Dan's line was out long before Harvey had mastered the mystery of baiting
and heaving out the leads. The dory drifted along easily. It was not worth
while to anchor till they were sure of good ground.</p>
<p>"Here we come!" Dan shouted, and a shower of spray rattled on Harvey's
shoulders as a big cod flapped and kicked alongside. "Muckle, Harvey, muckle!
Under your hand! Quick!"</p>
<p>Evidently "muckle" could not be the dinner-horn, so Harvey passed over the
maul, and Dan scientifically stunned the fish before he pulled it inboard, and
wrenched out the hook with the short wooden stick he called a "gob-stick." Then
Harvey felt a tug, and pulled up zealously.</p>
<p>"Why, these are strawberries!" he shouted. "Look!"</p>
<p>The hook had fouled among a bunch of strawberries, red on one side and white
on the other&mdash;perfect reproductions of the land fruit, except that there
were no leaves, and the stem was all pipy and slimy.</p>
<p>"Don't tech 'em. Slat 'em off. Don't&mdash;"</p>
<p>The warning came too late. Harvey had picked them from the hook, and was
admiring them.</p>
<p>"Ouch!" he cried, for his fingers throbbed as though he had grasped many
nettles.</p>
<p>"Now ye know what strawberry-bottom means. Nothin' 'cep' fish should be
teched with the naked fingers, Dad says. Slat 'em off agin the gunnel, an' bait
up, Harve. Lookin' won't help any. It's all in the wages."</p>
<p>Harvey smiled at the thought of his ten and a half dollars a month, and
wondered what his mother would say if she could see him hanging over the edge
of a fishing-dory in mid-ocean. She suffered agonies whenever he went out on
Saranac Lake; and, by the way, Harvey remembered distinctly that he used to
laugh at her anxieties. Suddenly the line flashed through his hand, stinging
even through the "nippers," the woolen circlets supposed to protect it.</p>
<p>"He's a logy. Give him room accordin' to his strength," cried Dan. "I'll
help ye."</p>
<p>"No, you won't," Harvey snapped, as he hung on to the line. "It's my first
fish. Is&mdash;is it a whale?"</p>
<p>"Halibut, mebbe." Dan peered down into the water alongside, and flourished
the big "muckle," ready for all chances. Something white and oval flickered and
fluttered through the green. "I'll lay my wage an' share he's over a hundred.
Are you so everlastin' anxious to land him alone?"</p>
<p>Harvey's knuckles were raw and bleeding where they had been banged against
the gunwale; his face was purple-blue between excitement and exertion; he
dripped with sweat, and was half-blinded from staring at the circling sunlit
ripples about the swiftly moving line. The boys were tired long ere the
halibut, who took charge of them and the dory for the next twenty minutes. But
the big flat fish was gaffed and hauled in at last.</p>
<p>"Beginner's luck," said Dan, wiping his forehead. "He's all of a
hundred."</p>
<p>Harvey looked at the huge gray-and-mottled creature with unspeakable pride.
He had seen halibut many times on marble slabs ashore, but it had never
occurred to him to ask how they came inland. Now he knew; and every inch of his
body ached with fatigue.</p>
<p>"Ef Dad was along," said Dan, hauling up, "he'd read the signs plain's
print. The fish are runnin' smaller an' smaller, an' you've took 'baout as logy
a halibut's we're apt to find this trip. Yesterday's catch&mdash;did ye notice
it?&mdash;was all big fish an' no halibut. Dad he'd read them signs right off.
Dad says everythin' on the Banks is signs, an' can be read wrong er right.
Dad's deeper'n the Whale-hole."</p>
<p>Even as he spoke some one fired a pistol on the <i>We're Here</i>, and a
potato-basket was run up in the fore-rigging.</p>
<p>"What did I say, naow? That's the call fer the whole crowd. Dad's onter
something, er he'd never break fishin' this time o' day. Reel up, Harve, an'
we'll pull back."</p>
<p>They were to windward of the schooner, just ready to flirt the dory over the
still sea, when sounds of woe half a mile off led them to Penn, who was
careering around a fixed point for all the world like a gigantic water-bug. The
little man backed away and came down again with enormous energy, but at the end
of each maneuver his dory swung round and snubbed herself on her rope.</p>
<p>"We'll hev to help him, else he'll root an' seed here," said Dan.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" said Harvey. This was a new world, where he could not
lay down the law to his elders, but had to ask questions humbly. And the sea
was horribly big and unexcited.</p>
<p>"Anchor's fouled. Penn's always losing 'em. Lost two this trip
a'ready&mdash;on sandy bottom too&mdash;an' Dad says next one he loses, sure's
fishin', he'll give him the kelleg. That 'u'd break Penn's heart."</p>
<p>"What's a 'kelleg'?" said Harvey, who had a vague idea it might be some kind
of marine torture, like keel-hauling in the storybooks.</p>
<p>"Big stone instid of an anchor. You kin see a kelleg ridin' in the bows
fur's you can see a dory, an' all the fleet knows what it means. They'd guy him
dreadful. Penn couldn't stand that no more'n a dog with a dipper to his tail.
He's so everlastin' sensitive. Hello, Penn! Stuck again? Don't try any more o'
your patents. Come up on her, and keep your rodin' straight up an' down."</p>
<p>"It doesn't move," said the little man, panting. "It doesn't move at all,
and instead I tried everything."</p>
<p>"What's all this hurrah's-nest for'ard?" said Dan, pointing to a wild tangle
of spare oars and dory-roding, all matted together by the hand of
inexperience.</p>
<p>"Oh, that," said Penn proudly, "is a Spanish windlass. Mr. Salters showed me
how to make it; but even that doesn't move her."</p>
<p>Dan bent low over the gunwale to hide a smile, twitched once or twice on the
roding, and, behold, the anchor drew at once.</p>
<p>"Haul up, Penn," he said laughing, "er she'll git stuck again."</p>
<p>They left him regarding the weed-hung flukes of the little anchor with big,
pathetic blue eyes, and thanking them profusely.</p>
<p>"Oh, say, while I think of it, Harve," said Dan when they were out of
ear-shot, "Penn ain't quite all caulked. He ain't nowise dangerous, but his
mind's give out. See?"</p>
<p>"Is that so, or is it one of your father's judgments?"</p>
<p>Harvey asked as he bent to his oars. He felt he was learning to handle them
more easily.</p>
<p>"Dad ain't mistook this time. Penn's a sure 'nuff loony."</p>
<p>"No, he ain't thet exactly, so much ez a harmless ijut. It was this way
(you're rowin' quite so, Harve), an' I tell you 'cause it's right you orter
know. He was a Moravian preacher once. Jacob Boiler wuz his name, Dad told me,
an' he lived with his wife an' four children somewheres out Pennsylvania way.
Well, Penn he took his folks along to a Moravian meetin'&mdash;camp-meetin'
most like&mdash;an' they stayed over jest one night in Johns-town. You've
heered talk o' Johnstown?"</p>
<p>Harvey considered. "Yes, I have. But I don't know why. It sticks in my head
same as Ashtabula."</p>
<p>"Both was big accidents&mdash;thet's why, Harve. Well, that one single night
Penn and his folks was to the hotel Johnstown was wiped out. 'Dam bust an'
flooded her, an' the houses struck adrift an' bumped into each other an' sunk.
I've seen the pictures, an' they're dretful. Penn he saw his folk drowned all'n
a heap 'fore he rightly knew what was comin'. His mind give out from that on.
He mistrusted somethin' hed happened up to Johnstown, but for the poor life of
him he couldn't remember what, an' he jest drifted araound smilin' an'
wonderin'. He didn't know what he was, nor yit what he hed bin, an' thet way he
run agin Uncle Salters, who was visitin' 'n Allegheny City. Ha'af my mother's
folks they live scattered inside o' Pennsylvania, an' Uncle Salters he visits
araound winters. Uncle Salters he kinder adopted Penn, well knowin' what his
trouble wuz; an' he brought him East, an' he give him work on his farm."</p>
<p>"Why, I heard him calling Penn a farmer last night when the boats bumped. Is
your Uncle Salters a farmer?"</p>
<p>"Farmer!" shouted Dan. "There ain't water enough 'tween here an' Hatt'rus to
wash the furrer-mold off'n his boots. He's jest everlastin' farmer. Why, Harve,
I've seen thet man hitch up a bucket, long towards sundown, an' set twiddlin'
the spigot to the scuttle-butt same's ef 'twas a cow's bag. He's thet much
farmer. Well, Penn an' he they ran the farm&mdash;up Exeter way 'twur. Uncle
Salters he sold it this spring to a jay from Boston as wanted to build a
summer-haouse, an' he got a heap for it. Well, them two loonies scratched along
till, one day, Penn's church&mdash;he'd belonged to the Moravians&mdash;found
out where he wuz drifted an' layin', an' wrote to Uncle Salters. 'Never heerd
what they said exactly; but Uncle Salters was mad. He's a 'piscopolian
mostly&mdash;but he jest let 'em hev it both sides o' the bow, 's if he was a
Baptist; an' sez he warn't goin' to give up Penn to any blame Moravian
connection in Pennsylvania or anywheres else. Then he come to Dad, towin'
Penn,&mdash;thet was two trips back,&mdash;an' sez he an' Penn must fish a trip
fer their health. 'Guess he thought the Moravians wouldn't hunt the Banks fer
Jacob Boiler. Dad was agreeable, fer Uncle Salters he'd been fishin' off an' on
fer thirty years, when he warn't inventin' patent manures, an' he took
quarter-share in the <i>We're Here</i>; an' the trip done Penn so much good,
Dad made a habit o' takin' him. Some day, Dad sez, he'll remember his wife an'
kids an' Johnstown, an' then, like as not, he'll die, Dad sez. Don't ye talk
abaout Johnstown ner such things to Penn, 'r Uncle Salters he'll heave ye
overboard."</p>
<p>"Poor Penn!" murmured Harvey. "I shouldn't ever have thought Uncle Salters
cared for him by the look of 'em together."</p>
<p>"I like Penn, though; we all do," said Dan. "We ought to ha' give him a tow,
but I wanted to tell ye first."</p>
<p>They were close to the schooner now, the other boats a little behind
them.</p>
<p>"You needn't heave in the dories till after dinner," said Troop from the
deck. "We'll dress daown right off. Fix table, boys!"</p>
<p>"Deeper'n the Whale-deep," said Dan, with a wink, as he set the gear for
dressing down. "Look at them boats that hev edged up sence mornin'. They're all
waitin' on Dad. See 'em, Harve?"</p>
<p>"They are all alike to me." And indeed to a landsman, the nodding schooners
around seemed run from the same mold.</p>
<p>"They ain't, though. That yaller, dirty packet with her bowsprit steeved
that way, she's the Hope of Prague. Nick Brady's her skipper, the meanest man
on the Banks. We'll tell him so when we strike the Main Ledge. 'Way off
yonder's the Day's Eye. The two Jeraulds own her. She's from Harwich; fastish,
too, an' hez good luck; but Dad he'd find fish in a graveyard. Them other
three, side along, they're the Margie Smith, Rose, and Edith S. Walen, all from
home. 'Guess we'll see the Abbie M. Deering to-morrer, Dad, won't we? They're
all slippin' over from the shaol o' 'Oueereau."</p>
<p>"You won't see many boats to-morrow, Danny." When Troop called his son
Danny, it was a sign that the old man was pleased. "Boys, we're too crowded,"
he went on, addressing the crew as they clambered inboard. "We'll leave 'em to
bait big an' catch small." He looked at the catch in the pen, and it was
curious to see how little and level the fish ran. Save for Harvey's halibut,
there was nothing over fifteen pounds on deck.</p>
<p>"I'm waitin' on the weather," he added.</p>
<p>"Ye'll have to make it yourself, Disko, for there's no sign I can see," said
Long Jack, sweeping the clear horizon.</p>
<p>And yet, half an hour later, as they were dressing down, the Bank fog
dropped on them, "between fish and fish," as they say. It drove steadily and in
wreaths, curling and smoking along the colourless water. The men stopped
dressing-down without a word. Long Jack and Uncle Salters slipped the windlass
brakes into their sockets, and began to heave up the anchor; the windlass
jarring as the wet hempen cable strained on the barrel. Manuel and Tom Platt
gave a hand at the last. The anchor came up with a sob, and the riding-sail
bellied as Troop steadied her at the wheel. "Up jib and foresail," said he.</p>
<p>"Slip 'em in the smother," shouted Long Jack, making fast the jib-sheet,
while the others raised the clacking, rattling rings of the foresail; and the
foreboom creaked as the <i>We're Here</i> looked up into the wind and dived off
into blank, whirling white.</p>
<p>"There's wind behind this fog," said Troop.</p>
<p>It was wonderful beyond words to Harvey; and the most wonderful part was
that he heard no orders except an occasional grunt from Troop, ending with,
"That's good, my son!"</p>
<p>"Never seen anchor weighed before?" said Tom Platt, to Harvey gaping at the
damp canvas of the foresail.</p>
<p>"No. Where are we going?"</p>
<p>"Fish and make berth, as you'll find out 'fore you've been a week aboard.
It's all new to you, but we never know what may come to us. Now, take
me&mdash;Tom Platt&mdash;I'd never ha' thought&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It's better than fourteen dollars a month an' a bullet in your belly," said
Troop, from the wheel. "Ease your jumbo a grind."</p>
<p>"Dollars an' cents better," returned the man-o'-war's man, doing something
to a big jib with a wooden spar tied to it. "But we didn't think o' that when
we manned the windlass-brakes on the Miss Jim Buck, I outside Beau-fort Harbor,
with Fort Macon heavin' hot shot at our stern, an' a livin' gale atop of all.
Where was you then, Disko?"</p>
<p>"Jest here, or hereabouts," Disko replied, "earnin' my bread on the deep
waters, an' dodgin' Reb privateers. Sorry I can't accommodate you with red-hot
shot, Tom Platt; but I guess we'll come aout all right on wind 'fore we see
Eastern Point."</p>
<p>There was an incessant slapping and chatter at the bows now, varied by a
solid thud and a little spout of spray that clattered down on the foc'sle. The
rigging dripped clammy drops, and the men lounged along the lee of the
house&mdash;all save Uncle Salters, who sat stiffly on the main-hatch nursing
his stung hands.</p>
<p>"Guess she'd carry stays'l," said Disko, rolling one eye at his brother.</p>
<p>"Guess she wouldn't to any sorter profit. What's the sense o' wastin'
canvas?" the farmer-sailor replied.</p>
<p>The wheel twitched almost imperceptibly in Disko's hands. A few seconds
later a hissing wave-top slashed diagonally across the boat, smote Uncle
Salters between the shoulders, and drenched him from head to foot. He rose
sputtering, and went forward only to catch another.</p>
<p>"See Dad chase him all around the deck," said Dan. "Uncle Salters he thinks
his quarter share's our canvas. Dad's put this duckin' act up on him two trips
runnin'. Hi! That found him where he feeds." Uncle Salters had taken refuge by
the foremast, but a wave slapped him over the knees. Disko's face was as blank
as the circle of the wheel.</p>
<p>"Guess she'd lie easier under stays'l, Salters," said Disko, as though he
had seen nothing.</p>
<p>"Set your old kite, then," roared the victim through a cloud of spray; "only
don't lay it to me if anything happens. Penn, you go below right off an' git
your coffee. You ought to hev more sense than to bum araound on deck this
weather."</p>
<p>"Now they'll swill coffee an' play checkers till the cows come home," said
Dan, as Uncle Salters hustled Penn into the fore-cabin. "'Looks to me like's if
we'd all be doin' so fer a spell. There's nothin' in creation
deader-limpsey-idler'n a Banker when she ain't on fish."</p>
<p>"I'm glad ye spoke, Danny," cried Long Jack, who had been casting round in
search of amusement. "I'd clean forgot we'd a passenger under that T-wharf hat.
There's no idleness for thim that don't know their ropes. Pass him along, Tom
Platt, an' we'll larn him."</p>
<p>"'Tain't my trick this time," grinned Dan. "You've got to go it alone. Dad
learned me with a rope's end."</p>
<p>For an hour Long Jack walked his prey up and down, teaching, as he said,
"things at the sea that ivry man must know, blind, dhrunk, or asleep." There is
not much gear to a seventy-ton schooner with a stump-foremast, but Long Jack
had a gift of expression. When he wished to draw Harvey's attention to the
peak-halyards, he dug his knuckles into the back of the boy's neck and kept him
at gaze for half a minute. He emphasized the difference between fore and aft
generally by rubbing Harvey's nose along a few feet of the boom, and the lead
of each rope was fixed in Harvey's mind by the end of the rope itself.</p>
<p>The lesson would have been easier had the deck been at all free; but there
appeared to be a place on it for everything and anything except a man. Forward
lay the windlass and its tackle, with the chain and hemp cables, all very
unpleasant to trip over; the foc'sle stovepipe, and the gurry-butts by the
foc'sle hatch to hold the fish-livers. Aft of these the foreboom and booby of
the main-hatch took all the space that was not needed for the pumps and
dressing-pens. Then came the nests of dories lashed to ring-bolts by the
quarter-deck; the house, with tubs and oddments lashed all around it; and,
last, the sixty-foot main-boom in its crutch, splitting things length-wise, to
duck and dodge under every time.</p>
<p>Tom Platt, of course, could not keep his oar out of the business, but ranged
alongside with enormous and unnecessary descriptions of sails and spars on the
old Ohio.</p>
<p>"Niver mind fwhat he says; attind to me, Innocince. Tom Platt, this
bally-hoo's not the Ohio, an' you're mixing the bhoy bad."</p>
<p>"He'll be ruined for life, beginnin' on a fore-an'-after this way," Tom
Platt pleaded. "Give him a chance to know a few leadin' principles. Sailin's an
art, Harvey, as I'd show you if I had ye in the fore-top o' the&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know ut. Ye'd talk him dead an' cowld. Silince, Tom Platt! Now, after all
I've said, how'd you reef the foresail, Harve? Take your time answerin'."</p>
<p>"Haul that in," said Harvey, pointing to leeward.</p>
<p>"Fwhat? The North Atlantuc?"</p>
<p>"No, the boom. Then run that rope you showed me back there&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That's no way," Tom Platt burst in.</p>
<p>"Quiet! He's larnin', an' has not the names good yet. Go on, Harve."</p>
<p>"Oh, it's the reef-pennant. I'd hook the tackle on to the reef-pennant, and
then let down&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Lower the sail, child! Lower!" said Tom Platt, in a professional agony.</p>
<p>"Lower the throat and peak halyards," Harvey went on. Those names stuck in
his head.</p>
<p>"Lay your hand on thim," said Long Jack.</p>
<p>Harvey obeyed. "Lower till that rope-loop&mdash;on the
after-leach-kris&mdash;no, it's cringle&mdash;till the cringle was down on the
boom. Then I'd tie her up the way you said, and then I'd hoist up the peak and
throat halyards again."</p>
<p>"You've forgot to pass the tack-earing, but wid time and help ye'll larn.
There's good and just reason for ivry rope aboard, or else 'twould be
overboard. D'ye follow me? 'Tis dollars an' cents I'm puttin' into your pocket,
ye skinny little supercargo, so that fwhin ye've filled out ye can ship from
Boston to Cuba an' tell thim Long Jack larned you. Now I'll chase ye around a
piece, callin' the ropes, an' you'll lay your hand on thim as I call."</p>
<p>He began, and Harvey, who was feeling rather tired, walked slowly to the
rope named. A rope's end licked round his ribs, and nearly knocked the breath
out of him.</p>
<p>"When you own a boat," said Tom Platt, with severe eyes, "you can walk. Till
then, take all orders at the run. Once more&mdash;to make sure!"</p>
<p>Harvey was in a glow with the exercise, and this last cut warmed him
thoroughly. Now he was a singularly smart boy, the son of a very clever man and
a very sensitive woman, with a fine resolute temper that systematic spoiling
had nearly turned to mulish obstinacy. He looked at the other men, and saw that
even Dan did not smile. It was evidently all in the day's work, though it hurt
abominably; so he swallowed the hint with a gulp and a gasp and a grin. The
same smartness that led him to take such advantage of his mother made him very
sure that no one on the boat, except, maybe, Penn, would stand the least
nonsense. One learns a great deal from a mere tone. Long Jack called over half
a dozen ropes, and Harvey danced over the deck like an eel at ebb-tide, one eye
on Tom Platt.</p>
<p>"Ver' good. Ver' good don," said Manuel. "After supper I show you a little
schooner I make, with all her ropes. So we shall learn."</p>
<p>"Fust-class fer&mdash;a passenger," said Dan. "Dad he's jest allowed you'll
be wuth your salt maybe 'fore you're draownded. Thet's a heap fer Dad. I'll
learn you more our next watch together."</p>
<p>"Taller!" grunted Disko, peering through the fog as it smoked over the bows.
There was nothing to be seen ten feet beyond the surging jib-boom, while
alongside rolled the endless procession of solemn, pale waves whispering and
lipping one to the other.</p>
<p>"Now I'll learn you something Long Jack can't," shouted Tom Platt, as from a
locker by the stern he produced a battered deep-sea lead hollowed at one end,
smeared the hollow from a saucer full of mutton tallow, and went forward. "I'll
learn you how to fly the Blue Pigeon. Shooo!"</p>
<p>Disko did something to the wheel that checked the schooner's way, while
Manuel, with Harvey to help (and a proud boy was Harvey), let down the jib in a
lump on the boom. The lead sung a deep droning song as Tom Platt whirled it
round and round.</p>
<p>"Go ahead, man," said Long Jack, impatiently. "We're not drawin' twenty-five
fut off Fire Island in a fog. There's no trick to ut."</p>
<p>"Don't be jealous, Galway." The released lead plopped into the sea far ahead
as the schooner surged slowly forward.</p>
<p>"Soundin' is a trick, though," said Dan, "when your dipsey lead's all the
eye you're like to hev for a week. What d'you make it, Dad?"</p>
<p>Disko's face relaxed. His skill and honour were involved in the march he had
stolen on the rest of the Fleet, and he had his reputation as a master artist
who knew the Banks blindfold. "Sixty, mebbe&mdash;ef I'm any judge," he
replied, with a glance at the tiny compass in the window of the house.</p>
<p>"Sixty," sung out Tom Platt, hauling in great wet coils.</p>
<p>The schooner gathered way once more. "Heave!" said Disko, after a quarter of
an hour.</p>
<p>"What d'you make it?" Dan whispered, and he looked at Harvey proudly. But
Harvey was too proud of his own performances to be impressed just then.</p>
<p>"Fifty," said the father. "I mistrust we're right over the nick o' Green
Bank on old Sixty-Fifty."</p>
<p>"Fifty!" roared Tom Platt. They could scarcely see him through the fog.
"She's bust within a yard&mdash;like the shells at Fort Macon."</p>
<p>"Bait up, Harve," said Dan, diving for a line on the reel.</p>
<p>The schooner seemed to be straying promiscuously through the smother, her
headsail banging wildly. The men waited and looked at the boys who began
fishing.</p>
<p>"Heugh!" Dan's lines twitched on the scored and scarred rail. "Now haow in
thunder did Dad know? Help us here, Harve. It's a big un. Poke-hooked, too."
They hauled together, and landed a goggle-eyed twenty-pound cod. He had taken
the bait right into his stomach.</p>
<p>"Why, he's all covered with little crabs," cried Harvey, turning him
over.</p>
<p>"By the great hook-block, they're lousy already," said Long Jack. "Disko, ye
kape your spare eyes under the keel."</p>
<p>Splash went the anchor, and they all heaved over the lines, each man taking
his own place at the bulwarks.</p>
<p>"Are they good to eat?" Harvey panted, as he lugged in another crab-covered
cod.</p>
<p>"Sure. When they're lousy it's a sign they've all been herdin' together by
the thousand, and when they take the bait that way they're hungry. Never mind
how the bait sets. They'll bite on the bare hook."</p>
<p>"Say, this is great!" Harvey cried, as the fish came in gasping and
splashing&mdash;nearly all poke-hooked, as Dan had said. "Why can't we always
fish from the boat instead of from the dories?"</p>
<p>"Allus can, till we begin to dress daown. Efter thet, the heads and offals
'u'd scare the fish to Fundy. Boatfishin' ain't reckoned progressive, though,
unless ye know as much as dad knows. Guess we'll run aout aour trawl to-night.
Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?"</p>
<p>It was rather back-breaking work, for in a dory the weight of a cod is
water-borne till the last minute, and you are, so to speak, abreast of him; but
the few feet of a schooner's freeboard make so much extra dead-hauling, and
stooping over the bulwarks cramps the stomach. But it was wild and furious
sport so long as it lasted; and a big pile lay aboard when the fish ceased
biting.</p>
<p>"Where's Penn and Uncle Salters?" Harvey asked, slapping the slime off his
oilskins, and reeling up the line in careful imitation of the others.</p>
<p>"Git 's coffee and see."</p>
<p>Under the yellow glare of the lamp on the pawl-post, the foc'sle table down
and opened, utterly unconscious of fish or weather, sat the two men, a
checker-board between them, Uncle Salters snarling at Penn's every move.</p>
<p>"What's the matter naow?" said the former, as Harvey, one hand in the
leather loop at the head of the ladder, hung shouting to the cook.</p>
<p>"Big fish and lousy&mdash;heaps and heaps," Harvey replied, quoting Long
Jack. "How's the game?"</p>
<p>Little Penn's jaw dropped. "'Tweren't none o' his fault," snapped Uncle
Salters. "Penn's deef."</p>
<p>"Checkers, weren't it?" said Dan, as Harvey staggered aft with the steaming
coffee in a tin pail. "That lets us out o' cleanin' up to-night. Dad's a jest
man. They'll have to do it."</p>
<p>"An' two young fellers I know'll bait up a tub or so o' trawl, while they're
cleanin'," said Disko, lashing the wheel to his taste.</p>
<p>"Um! Guess I'd ruther clean up, Dad."</p>
<p>"Don't doubt it. Ye wun't, though. Dress daown! Dress daown! Penn'll pitch
while you two bait up."</p>
<p>"Why in thunder didn't them blame boys tell us you'd struck on?" said Uncle
Salters, shuffling to his place at the table. "This knife's gum-blunt,
Dan."</p>
<p>"Ef stickin' out cable don't wake ye, guess you'd better hire a boy o' your
own," said Dan, muddling about in the dusk over the tubs full of trawl-line
lashed to windward of the house. "Oh, Harve, don't ye want to slip down an' git
's bait?"</p>
<p>"Bait ez we are," said Disko. "I mistrust shag-fishin' will pay better, ez
things go."</p>
<p>That meant the boys would bait with selected offal of the cod as the fish
were cleaned&mdash;an improvement on paddling bare-handed in the little
bait-barrels below. The tubs were full of neatly coiled line carrying a big
hook each few feet; and the testing and baiting of every single hook, with the
stowage of the baited line so that it should run clear when shot from the dory,
was a scientific business. Dan managed it in the dark, without looking, while
Harvey caught his fingers on the barbs and bewailed his fate. But the hooks
flew through Dan's fingers like tatting on an old maid's lap. "I helped bait up
trawl ashore 'fore I could well walk," he said. "But it's a putterin' job all
the same. Oh, Dad!" This shouted towards the hatch, where Disko and Tom Platt
were salting. "How many skates you reckon we'll need?"</p>
<p>"'Baout three. Hurry!"</p>
<p>"There's three hundred fathom to each tub," Dan explained; "more'n enough to
lay out to-night. Ouch! 'Slipped up there, I did." He stuck his finger in his
mouth. "I tell you, Harve, there ain't money in Gloucester 'u'd hire me to ship
on a reg'lar trawler. It may be progressive, but, barrin' that, it's the
putterin'est, slimjammest business top of earth."</p>
<p>"I don't know what this is, if 'tisn't regular trawling," said Harvey
sulkily. "My fingers are all cut to frazzles."</p>
<p>"Pshaw! This is just one o' Dad's blame experiments. He don't trawl 'less
there's mighty good reason fer it. Dad knows. Thet's why he's baitin' ez he is.
We'll hev her saggin' full when we take her up er we won't see a fin."</p>
<p>Penn and Uncle Salters cleaned up as Disko had ordained, but the boys
profited little. No sooner were the tubs furnished than Tom Platt and Long
Jack, who had been exploring the inside of a dory with a lantern, snatched them
away, loaded up the tubs and some small, painted trawl-buoys, and hove the boat
overboard into what Harvey regarded as an exceedingly rough sea. "They'll be
drowned. Why, the dory's loaded like a freight-car," he cried.</p>
<p>"We'll be back," said Long Jack, "an' in case you'll not be lookin' for us,
we'll lay into you both if the trawl's snarled."</p>
<p>The dory surged up on the crest of a wave, and just when it seemed
impossible that she could avoid smashing against the schooner's side, slid over
the ridge, and was swallowed up in the damp dusk.</p>
<p>"Take ahold here, an' keep ringin' steady," said Dan, passing Harvey the
lanyard of a bell that hung just behind the windlass.</p>
<p>Harvey rang lustily, for he felt two lives depended on him. But Disko in the
cabin, scrawling in the log-book, did not look like a murderer, and when he
went to supper he even smiled dryly at the anxious Harvey.</p>
<p>"This ain't no weather," said Dan. "Why, you an' me could set thet trawl!
They've only gone out jest far 'nough so's not to foul our cable. They don't
need no bell reelly."</p>
<p>"Clang! clang! clang!" Harvey kept it up, varied with occasional rub-a-dubs,
for another half-hour. There was a bellow and a bump alongside. Manuel and Dan
raced to the hooks of the dory-tackle; Long Jack and Tom Platt arrived on deck
together, it seemed, one half the North Atlantic at their backs, and the dory
followed them in the air, landing with a clatter.</p>
<p>"Nary snarl," said Tom Platt as he dripped. "Danny, you'll do yet."</p>
<p>"The pleasure av your comp'ny to the banquit," said Long Jack, squelching
the water from his boots as he capered like an elephant and stuck an
oil-skinned arm into Harvey's face. "We do be condescending to honour the
second half wid our presence." And off they all four rolled to supper, where
Harvey stuffed himself to the brim on fish-chowder and fried pies, and fell
fast asleep just as Manuel produced from a locker a lovely two-foot model of
the Lucy Holmes, his first boat, and was going to show Harvey the ropes. Harvey
never even twiddled his fingers as Penn pushed him into his bunk.</p>
<p>"It must be a sad thing&mdash;a very sad thing," said Penn, watching the
boy's face, "for his mother and his father, who think he is dead. To lose a
child&mdash;to lose a man-child!"</p>
<p>"Git out o' this, Penn," said Dan. "Go aft and finish your game with Uncle
Salters. Tell Dad I'll stand Harve's watch ef he don't keer. He's played
aout."</p>
<p>"Ver' good boy," said Manuel, slipping out of his boots and disappearing
into the black shadows of the lower bunk. "Expec' he make good man, Danny. I no
see he is any so mad as your parpa he says. Eh, wha-at?"</p>
<p>Dan chuckled, but the chuckle ended in a snore.</p>
<p>It was thick weather outside, with a rising wind, and the elder men
stretched their watches. The hour struck clear in the cabin; the nosing bows
slapped and scuffed with the seas; the foc'sle stove-pipe hissed and sputtered
as the spray caught it; and the boys slept on, while Disko, Long Jack, Tom
Platt, and Uncle Salters, each in turn, stumped aft to look at the wheel,
forward to see that the anchor held, or to veer out a little more cable against
chafing, with a glance at the dim anchor-light between each round.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>Harvey waked to find the "first half" at breakfast, the foc'sle door drawn
to a crack, and every square inch of the schooner singing its own tune. The
black bulk of the cook balanced behind the tiny galley over the glare of the
stove, and the pots and pans in the pierced wooden board before it jarred and
racketed to each plunge. Up and up the foc'sle climbed, yearning and surging
and quivering, and then, with a clear, sickle-like swoop, came down into the
seas. He could hear the flaring bows cut and squelch, and there was a pause ere
the divided waters came down on the deck above, like a volley of buckshot.
Followed the woolly sound of the cable in the hawse-hole; and a grunt and
squeal of the windlass; a yaw, a punt, and a kick, and the <i>We're Here</i>
gathered herself together to repeat the motions.</p>
<p>"Now, ashore," he heard Long Jack saying, "ye've chores, an' ye must do thim
in any weather. Here we're well clear of the fleet, an' we've no
chores&mdash;an' that's a blessin'. Good night, all." He passed like a big
snake from the table to his bunk, and began to smoke. Tom Platt followed his
example; Uncle Salters, with Penn, fought his way up the ladder to stand his
watch, and the cook set for the "second half."</p>
<p>It came out of its bunks as the others had entered theirs, with a shake and
a yawn. It ate till it could eat no more; and then Manuel filled his pipe with
some terrible tobacco, crotched himself between the pawl-post and a forward
bunk, cocked his feet up on the table, and smiled tender and indolent smiles at
the smoke. Dan lay at length in his bunk, wrestling with a gaudy, gilt-stopped
accordion, whose tunes went up and down with the pitching of the <i>We're
Here</i>. The cook, his shoulders against the locker where he kept the fried
pies (Dan was fond of fried pies), peeled potatoes, with one eye on the stove
in event of too much water finding its way down the pipe; and the general smell
and smother were past all description.</p>
<p>Harvey considered affairs, wondered that he was not deathly sick, and
crawled into his bunk again, as the softest and safest place, while Dan struck
up, "I don't want to play in your yard," as accurately as the wild jerks
allowed.</p>
<p>"How long is this for?" Harvey asked of Manuel.</p>
<p>"Till she get a little quiet, and we can row to trawl. Perhaps to-night.
Perhaps two days more. You do not like? Eh, wha-at?"</p>
<p>"I should have been crazy sick a week ago, but it doesn't seem to upset me
now&mdash;much."</p>
<p>"That is because we make you fisherman, these days. If I was you, when I
come to Gloucester I would give two, three big candles for my good luck."</p>
<p>"Give who?"</p>
<p>"To be sure&mdash;the Virgin of our Church on the Hill. She is very good to
fishermen all the time. That is why so few of us Portugee men ever are
drowned."</p>
<p>"You're a Roman Catholic, then?"</p>
<p>"I am a Madeira man. I am not a Porto Pico boy. Shall I be Baptist, then?
Eh, wha-at? I always give candles&mdash;two, three more when I come to
Gloucester. The good Virgin she never forgets me, Manuel."</p>
<p>"I don't sense it that way," Tom Platt put in from his bunk, his scarred
face lit up by the glare of a match as he sucked at his pipe. "It stands to
reason the sea's the sea; and you'll get jest about what's goin', candles or
kerosene, fer that matter."</p>
<p>"'Tis a mighty good thing," said Long Jack, "to have a frind at coort,
though. I'm o' Manuel's way o' thinkin'. About tin years back I was crew to a
Sou' Boston market-boat. We was off Minot's Ledge wid a northeaster, butt
first, atop of us, thicker'n burgoo. The ould man was dhrunk, his chin waggin'
on the tiller, an' I sez to myself, 'If iver I stick my boat-huk into T-wharf
again, I'll show the saints fwhat manner o' craft they saved me out av.' Now,
I'm here, as ye can well see, an' the model of the dhirty ould Kathleen, that
took me a month to make, I gave ut to the priest, an' he hung ut up forninst
the altar. There's more sense in givin' a model that's by way o' bein' a work
av art than any candle. Ye can buy candles at store, but a model shows the good
saints ye've tuk trouble an' are grateful."</p>
<p>"D'you believe that, Irish?" said Tom Platt, turning on his elbow.</p>
<p>"Would I do ut if I did not, Ohio?"</p>
<p>"Wa-al, Enoch Fuller he made a model o' the old Ohio, and she's to Calem
museum now. Mighty pretty model, too, but I guess Enoch he never done it fer no
sacrifice; an' the way I take it is&mdash;"</p>
<p>There were the makings of an hour-long discussion of the kind that fishermen
love, where the talk runs in shouting circles and no one proves anything at the
end, had not Dan struck up this cheerful rhyme:</p>
<blockquote>"Up jumped the mackerel with his stripe'd back.<br>
Reef in the mainsail, and haul on the tack;<br>
<i>For</i> it's windy weather&mdash;"</blockquote>
<p>Here Long Jack joined in:</p>
<blockquote>"<i>And</i> it's blowy weather;<br>
<i>When</i> the winds begin to blow, pipe all hands together!"</blockquote>
<p>Dan went on, with a cautious look at Tom Platt, holding the accordion low in
the bunk:</p>
<blockquote>"Up jumped the cod with his chuckle-head,<br>
Went to the main-chains to heave at the lead;<br>
<i>For</i> it's windy weather," etc.</blockquote>
<p>Tom Platt seemed to be hunting for something. Dan crouched lower, but sang
louder:</p>
<blockquote>"Up jumped the flounder that swims to the ground.<br>
Chuckle-head! Chuckle-head! Mind where ye sound!"</blockquote>
<p>Tom Platt's huge rubber boot whirled across the foc'sle and caught Dan's
uplifted arm. There was war between the man and the boy ever since Dan had
discovered that the mere whistling of that tune would make him angry as he
heaved the lead.</p>
<p>"Thought I'd fetch yer," said Dan, returning the gift with precision. "Ef
you don't like my music, git out your fiddle. I ain't goin' to lie here all day
an' listen to you an' Long Jack arguin' 'baout candles. Fiddle, Tom Platt; or
I'll learn Harve here the tune!"</p>
<p>Tom Platt leaned down to a locker and brought up an old white fiddle.
Manuel's eye glistened, and from somewhere behind the pawl-post he drew out a
tiny, guitar-like thing with wire strings, which he called a machette.</p>
<p>"'Tis a concert," said Long Jack, beaming through the smoke. "A reg'lar
Boston concert."</p>
<p>There was a burst of spray as the hatch opened, and Disko, in yellow
oilskins, descended.</p>
<p>"Ye're just in time, Disko. Fwhat's she doin' outside?"</p>
<p>"Jest this!" He dropped on to the lockers with the push and heave of the
<i>We're Here</i>.</p>
<p>"We're singin' to kape our breakfasts down. Ye'll lead, av course, Disko,"
said Long Jack.</p>
<p>"Guess there ain't more'n 'baout two old songs I know, an' ye've heerd them
both."</p>
<p>His excuses were cut short by Tom Platt launching into a most dolorous tune,
like unto the moaning of winds and the creaking of masts. With his eyes fixed
on the beams above, Disko began this ancient, ancient ditty, Tom Platt
flourishing all round him to make the tune and words fit a little:</p>
<blockquote>"There is a crack packet&mdash;crack packet o' fame,<br>
She hails from Noo York, an' the <i>Dreadnought's</i> her name.<br>
You may talk o' your fliers&mdash;Swallowtail and Black Ball&mdash;<br>
But the <i>Dreadnought's</i> the packet that can beat them all.<br>
"Now the <i>Dreadnought</i> she lies in the River Mersey,<br>
Because of the tug-boat to take her to sea;<br>
But when she's off soundings you shortly will know<br>
<br>
(Chorus.)<br>
<br>
She's the Liverpool packet&mdash;O Lord, let her go!<br>
<br>
"Now the <i>Dreadnought</i> she's howlin' crost the Banks o' Newfoundland,<br>
Where the water's all shallow and the bottom's all sand.<br>
Sez all the little fishes that swim to and fro:<br>
<br>
(Chorus.)<br>
<br>
'She's the Liverpool packet&mdash;O Lord, let her go!'",</blockquote>
<p>There were scores of verses, for he worked the <i>Dreadnought</i> every mile
of the way between Liverpool and New York as conscientiously as though he were
on her deck, and the accordion pumped and the fiddle squeaked beside him. Tom
Platt followed with something about "the rough and tough McGinn, who would
pilot the vessel in." Then they called on Harvey, who felt very flattered, to
contribute to the entertainment; but all that he could remember were some
pieces of "Skipper Ireson's Ride" that he had been taught at the camp-school in
the Adirondacks. It seemed that they might be appropriate to the time and
place, but he had no more than mentioned the title when Disko brought down one
foot with a bang, and cried, "Don't go on, young feller. That's a mistaken
jedgment&mdash;one o' the worst kind, too, becaze it's catchin' to the
ear."</p>
<p>"I orter ha' warned you," said Dan. "Thet allus fetches Dad."</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" said Harvey, surprised and a little angry.</p>
<p>"All you're goin' to say," said Disko. "All dead wrong from start to finish,
an' Whittier he's to blame. I have no special call to right any Marblehead man,
but 'tweren't no fault o' Ireson's. My father he told me the tale time an'
again, an' this is the way 'twuz."</p>
<p>"For the wan hundredth time," put in Long Jack under his breath</p>
<p>"Ben Ireson he was skipper o' the Betty, young feller, comin' home frum the
Banks&mdash;that was before the war of 1812, but jestice is jestice at all
times. They fund the Active o' Portland, an' Gibbons o' that town he was her
skipper; they fund her leakin' off Cape Cod Light. There was a terr'ble gale
on, an' they was gettin' the Betty home 's fast as they could craowd her. Well,
Ireson he said there warn't any sense to reskin' a boat in that sea; the men
they wouldn't hev it; and he laid it before them to stay by the Active till the
sea run daown a piece. They wouldn't hev that either, hangin' araound the Cape
in any sech weather, leak or no leak. They jest up stays'l an' quit, nat'rally
takin' Ireson with 'em. Folks to Marblehead was mad at him not runnin' the
risk, and becaze nex' day, when the sea was ca'am (they never stopped to think
o' that), some of the Active's folks was took off by a Truro man. They come
into Marblehead with their own tale to tell, sayin' how Ireson had shamed his
town, an' so forth an' so on, an' Ireson's men they was scared, seein' public
feelin' agin' 'em, an' they went back on Ireson, an' swore he was respons'ble
for the hull act. 'Tweren't the women neither that tarred and feathered
him&mdash;Marblehead women don't act that way&mdash;'twas a passel o' men an'
boys, an' they carted him araound town in an old dory till the bottom fell
aout, and Ireson he told 'em they'd be sorry for it some day. Well, the facts
come aout later, same's they usually do, too late to be any ways useful to an
honest man; an' Whittier he come along an' picked up the slack eend of a lyin'
tale, an' tarred and feathered Ben Ireson all over onct more after he was dead.
'Twas the only tune Whittier ever slipped up, an' 'tweren't fair. I whaled Dan
good when he brought that piece back from school. You don't know no better, o'
course; but I've give you the facts, hereafter an' evermore to be remembered.
Ben Ireson weren't no sech kind o' man as Whittier makes aout; my father he
knew him well, before an' after that business, an' you beware o' hasty
jedgments, young feller. Next!"</p>
<p>Harvey had never heard Disko talk so long, and collapsed with burning
cheeks; but, as Dan said promptly, a boy could only learn what he was taught at
school, and life was too short to keep track of every lie along the coast.</p>
<p>Then Manuel touched the jangling, jarring little machette to a queer tune,
and sang something in Portuguese about "Nina, innocente!" ending with a
full-handed sweep that brought the song up with a jerk. Then Disko obliged with
his second song, to an old-fashioned creaky tune, and all joined in the chorus.
This is one stanza:</p>
<blockquote>"Now Aprile is over and melted the snow,<br>
And outer Noo Bedford we shortly must tow;<br>
Yes, out o' Noo Bedford we shortly must clear,<br>
We're the whalers that never see wheat in the ear."</blockquote>
<p>Here the fiddle went very softly for a while by itself, and then:</p>
<blockquote>"Wheat-in-the-ear, my true-love's posy blowin,<br>
Wheat-in-the-ear, we're goin' off to sea;<br>
Wheat-in-the-ear, I left you fit for sowin,<br>
When I come back a loaf o' bread you'll be!"</blockquote>
<p>That made Harvey almost weep, though he could not tell why. But it was much
worse when the cook dropped the potatoes and held out his hands for the fiddle.
Still leaning against the locker door, he struck into a tune that was like
something very bad but sure to happen whatever you did. After a little he sang,
in an unknown tongue, his big chin down on the fiddle-tail, his white eyeballs
glaring in the lamplight. Harvey swung out of his bunk to hear better; and amid
the straining of the timbers and the wash of the waters the tune crooned and
moaned on, like lee surf in a blind fog, till it ended with a wail.</p>
<p>"Jimmy Christmas! Thet gives me the blue creevles," said Dan. "What in
thunder is it?"</p>
<p>"The song of Fin McCoul," said the cook, "when he wass going to Norway." His
English was not thick, but all clear-cut, as though it came from a
phonograph.</p>
<p>"Faith, I've been to Norway, but I didn't make that unwholesim noise. 'Tis
like some of the old songs, though," said Long Jack, sighing.</p>
<p>"Don't let's hev another 'thout somethin' between," said Dan; and the
accordion struck up a rattling, catchy tune that ended:</p>
<blockquote>"It's six an' twenty Sundays sence las' we saw the land,<br>
With fifteen hunder quintal,<br>
An fifteen hunder quintal,<br>
'Teen hunder toppin' quintal,<br>
'Twix' old 'Queereau an' Grand!"</blockquote>
<p>"Hold on!" roared Tom Platt. "D'ye want to nail the trip, Dan? That's Jonah
sure, 'less you sing it after all our salt's wet."</p>
<p>"No, 'tain't, is it, Dad? Not unless you sing the very las' verse. You can't
learn me anything on Jonahs!"</p>
<p>"What's that?" said Harvey. "What's a Jonah?"</p>
<p>"A Jonah's anything that spoils the luck. Sometimes it's a
man&mdash;sometimes it's a boy&mdash;or a bucket. I've known a splittin'-knife
Jonah two trips till we was on to her," said Tom Platt. "There's all sorts o'
Jonahs. Jim Bourke was one till he was drowned on Georges. I'd never ship with
Jim Bourke, not if I was starvin'. There wuz a green dory on the Ezra Flood.
Thet was a Jonah, too, the worst sort o' Jonah. Drowned four men, she did, an'
used to shine fiery O, nights in the nest."</p>
<p>"And you believe that?" said Harvey, remembering what Tom Platt had said
about candles and models. "Haven't we all got to take what's served?"</p>
<p>A mutter of dissent ran round the bunks. "Outboard, yes; inboard, things can
happen," said Disko. "Don't you go makin' a mock of Jonahs, young feller."</p>
<p>"Well, Harve ain't no Jonah. Day after we catched him," Dan cut in, "we had
a toppin' good catch."</p>
<p>The cook threw up his head and laughed suddenly&mdash;a queer, thin laugh.
He was a most disconcerting nigger.</p>
<p>"Murder!" said Long Jack. "Don't do that again, doctor. We ain't used to
ut."</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" said Dan. "Ain't he our mascot, and didn't they strike on
good after we'd struck him?"</p>
<p>"Oh! yess," said the cook. "I know that, but the catch iss not finish
yet."</p>
<p>"He ain't goin' to do us any harm," said Dan, hotly. "Where are ye hintin'
an' edgin' to? He's all right."</p>
<p>"No harm. No. But one day he will be your master, Danny."</p>
<p>"That all?" said Dan, placidly. "He wun't&mdash;not by a jugful."</p>
<p>"Master!" said the cook, pointing to Harvey. "Man!" and he pointed to
Dan.</p>
<p>"That's news. Haow soon?" said Dan, with a laugh.</p>
<p>"In some years, and I shall see it. Master and man&mdash;man and
master."</p>
<p>"How in thunder d'ye work that out?" said Tom Platt.</p>
<p>"In my head, where I can see."</p>
<p>"Haow?" This from all the others at once.</p>
<p>"I do not know, but so it will be." He dropped his head, and went on peeling
the potatoes, and not another word could they get out of him.</p>
<p>"Well," said Dan, "a heap o' things'll hev to come abaout 'fore Harve's any
master o' mine; but I'm glad the doctor ain't choosen to mark him for a Jonah.
Now, I mistrust Uncle Salters fer the Jonerest Jonah in the Fleet regardin' his
own special luck. Dunno ef it's spreadin' same's smallpox. He ought to be on
the <i>Carrie Pitman</i>. That boat's her own Jonah, sure&mdash;crews an' gear
made no differ to her driftin'. Jiminy Christmas! She'll etch loose in a flat
ca'am."</p>
<p>"We're well clear o' the Fleet, anyway," said Disko. "<i>Carrie Pitman</i>
an' all." There was a rapping on the deck.</p>
<p>"Uncle Salters has catched his luck," said Dan as his father departed.</p>
<p>"It's blown clear," Disko cried, and all the foc'sle tumbled up for a bit of
fresh air. The fog had gone, but a sullen sea ran in great rollers behind it.
The <i>We're Here</i> slid, as it were, into long, sunk avenues and ditches
which felt quite sheltered and homelike if they would only stay still; but they
changed without rest or mercy, and flung up the schooner to crown one peak of a
thousand gray hills, while the wind hooted through her rigging as she zigzagged
down the slopes. Far away a sea would burst into a sheet of foam, and the
others would follow suit as at a signal, till Harvey's eyes swam with the
vision of interlacing whites and grays. Four or five Mother Carey's chickens
stormed round in circles, shrieking as they swept past the bows. A rain-squall
or two strayed aimlessly over the hopeless waste, ran down 'wind and back
again, and melted away.</p>
<p>"Seems to me I saw somethin' flicker jest naow over yonder," said Uncle
Salters, pointing to the northeast.</p>
<p>"Can't be any of the fleet," said Disko, peering under his eyebrows, a hand
on the foc'sle gangway as the solid bows hatcheted into the troughs. "Sea's
oilin' over dretful fast. Danny, don't you want to skip up a piece an' see how
aour trawl-buoy lays?"</p>
<p>Danny, in his big boots, trotted rather than climbed up the main rigging
(this consumed Harvey with envy), hitched himself around the reeling
cross-trees, and let his eye rove till it caught the tiny black buoy-flag on
the shoulder of a mile-away swell.</p>
<p>"She's all right," he hailed. "Sail O! Dead to the no'th'ard, comin' down
like smoke! Schooner she be, too."</p>
<p>They waited yet another half-hour, the sky clearing in patches, with a
flicker of sickly sun from time to time that made patches of olive-green water.
Then a stump-foremast lifted, ducked, and disappeared, to be followed on the
next wave by a high stern with old-fashioned wooden snail's-horn davits. The
snails were red-tanned.</p>
<p>"Frenchmen!" shouted Dan. "No, 'tain't, neither. Da-ad!"</p>
<p>"That's no French," said Disko. "Salters, your blame luck holds tighter'n a
screw in a keg-head."</p>
<p>"I've eyes. It's Uncle Abishai."</p>
<p>"You can't nowise tell fer sure."</p>
<p>"The head-king of all Jonahs," groaned Tom Platt. "Oh, Salters, Salters, why
wasn't you abed an' asleep?"</p>
<p>"How could I tell?" said poor Salters, as the schooner swung up.</p>
<p>She might have been the very Flying Dutchman, so foul, draggled, and unkempt
was every rope and stick aboard. Her old-style quarterdeck was some or five
feet high, and her rigging flew knotted and tangled like weed at a wharf-end.
She was running before the wind&mdash;yawing frightfully&mdash;her staysail let
down to act as a sort of extra foresail,&mdash;"scandalized," they call
it,&mdash;and her foreboom guyed out over the side. Her bowsprit cocked up like
an old-fashioned frigate's; her jib-boom had been fished and spliced and nailed
and clamped beyond further repair; and as she hove herself forward, and sat
down on her broad tail, she looked for all the world like a blouzy, frouzy, bad
old woman sneering at a decent girl.</p>
<p>"That's Abishai," said Salters. "Full o' gin an' Judique men, an' the
judgments o' Providence layin' fer him an' never takin' good holt He's run in
to bait, Miquelon way."</p>
<p>"He'll run her under," said Long Jack. "That's no rig fer this weather."</p>
<p>"Not he, 'r he'd'a done it long ago," Disko replied. "Looks 's if he
cal'lated to run us under. Ain't she daown by the head more 'n natural, Tom
Platt?"</p>
<p>"Ef it's his style o' loadin' her she ain't safe," said the sailor slowly.
"Ef she's spewed her oakum he'd better git to his pumps mighty quick."</p>
<p>The creature threshed up, wore round with a clatter and raffle, and lay head
to wind within ear-shot.</p>
<p>A gray-beard wagged over the bulwark, and a thick voice yelled something
Harvey could not understand. But Disko's face darkened. "He'd resk every stick
he hez to carry bad news. Says we're in fer a shift o' wind. He's in fer worse.
Abishai! Abi-shai!" He waved his arm up and down with the gesture of a man at
the pumps, and pointed forward. The crew mocked him and laughed.</p>
<p>"Jounce ye, an' strip ye an' trip ye!" yelled Uncle Abishai. "A livin'
gale&mdash;a livin' gale. Yab! Cast up fer your last trip, all you Gloucester
haddocks. You won't see Gloucester no more, no more!"</p>
<p>"Crazy full&mdash;as usual," said Tom Platt. "Wish he hadn't spied us,
though."</p>
<p>She drifted out of hearing while the gray-head yelled something about a
dance at the Bay of Bulls and a dead man in the foc'sle. Harvey shuddered. He
had seen the sloven tilled decks and the savage-eyed crew.</p>
<p>"An' that's a fine little floatin' hell fer her draught," said Long Jack. "I
wondher what mischief he's been at ashore."</p>
<p>"He's a trawler," Dan explained to Harvey, "an' he runs in fer bait all
along the coast. Oh, no, not home, he don't go. He deals along the south an'
east shore up yonder." He nodded in the direction of the pitiless Newfoundland
beaches. "Dad won't never take me ashore there. They're a mighty tough
crowd&mdash;an' Abishai's the toughest. You saw his boat? Well, she's nigh
seventy year old, they say; the last o' the old Marblehead heel-tappers. They
don't make them quarterdecks any more. Abishai don't use Marblehead, though. He
ain't wanted there. He jes' drif's araound, in debt, trawlin' an' cussin' like
you've heard. Bin a Jonah fer years an' years, he hez. 'Gits liquor frum the
Feecamp boats fer makin' spells an' selling winds an' such truck. Crazy, I
guess."</p>
<p>"'Twon't be any use underrunnin' the trawl to-night," said Tom Platt, with
quiet despair. "He come alongside special to cuss us. I'd give my wage an'
share to see him at the gangway o' the old Ohio 'fore we quit floggin'. Jest
abaout six dozen, an' Sam Mocatta layin' 'em on criss-cross!"</p>
<p>The disheveled "heel-tapper" danced drunkenly down wind, and all eyes
followed her. Suddenly the cook cried in his phonograph voice: "It wass his own
death made him speak so! He iss fey&mdash;fey, I tell you! Look!" She sailed
into a patch of watery sunshine three or four miles distant. The patch dulled
and faded out, and even as the light passed so did the schooner. She dropped
into a hollow and&mdash;was not.</p>
<p>"Run under, by the Great Hook-Block!" shouted Disko, jumping aft. "Drunk or
sober, we've got to help 'em. Heave short and break her out! Smart!"</p>
<p>Harvey was thrown on the deck by the shock that followed the setting of the
jib and foresail, for they hove short on the cable, and to save time, jerked
the anchor bodily from the bottom, heaving in as they moved away. This is a bit
of brute force seldom resorted to except in matters of life and death, and the
little <i>We're Here</i> complained like a human. They ran down to where
Abishai's craft had vanished; found two or three trawl-tubs, a gin-bottle, and
a stove-in dory, but nothing more. "Let 'em go," said Disko, though no one had
hinted at picking them up. "I wouldn't hev a match that belonged to Abishai
aboard. Guess she run clear under. Must ha' been spewin' her oakum fer a week,
an' they never thought to pump her. That's one more boat gone along o' leavin'
port all hands drunk."</p>
<p>"Glory be!" said Long Jack. "We'd ha' been obliged to help 'em if they was
top o' water."</p>
<p>"'Thinkin' o' that myself," said Tom Platt.</p>
<p>"Fey! Fey!" said the cook, rolling his eyes. "He haas taken his own luck
with him."</p>
<p>"Ver' good thing, I think, to tell the Fleet when we see. Eh, wha-at?" said
Manuel. "If you runna that way before the 'wind, and she work open her
seams&mdash;" He threw out his hands with an indescribable gesture, while Penn
sat down on the house and sobbed at the sheer horror and pity of it all. Harvey
could not realize that he had seen death on the open waters, but he felt very
sick. Then Dan went up the cross-trees, and Disko steered them back to within
sight of their own trawl-buoys just before the fog blanketed the sea once
again.</p>
<p>"We go mighty quick hereabouts when we do go," was all he said to Harvey.
"You think on that fer a spell, young feller. That was liquor."</p>
<p>"After dinner it was calm enough to fish from the decks,&mdash;Penn and
Uncle Salters were very zealous this time,&mdash;and the catch was large and
large fish.</p>
<p>"Abishai has shorely took his luck with him," said Salters. "The wind hain't
backed ner riz ner nothin'. How abaout the trawl? I despise superstition,
anyway."</p>
<p>Tom Platt insisted that they had much better haul the thing and make a new
berth. But the cook said: "The luck iss in two pieces. You will find it so when
you look. I know." This so tickled Long Jack that he overbore Tom Platt and the
two went out together.</p>
<p>Underrunning a trawl means pulling it in on one side of the dory, picking
off the fish, rebaiting the hooks, and passing them back to the sea
again&mdash;something like pinning and unpinning linen on a wash-line. It is a
lengthy business and rather dangerous, for the long, sagging line may twitch a
boat under in a flash. But when they heard, "And naow to thee, O Capting,"
booming out of the fog, the crew of the <i>We're Here</i> took heart. The dory
swirled alongside well loaded, Tom Platt yelling for Manuel to act as
relief-boat.</p>
<p>"The luck's cut square in two pieces," said Long Jack, forking in the fish,
while Harvey stood open-mouthed at the skill with which the plunging dory was
saved from destruction. "One half was jest punkins. Tom Platt wanted to haul
her an' ha' done wid ut; but I said, 'I'll back the doctor that has the second
sight, an' the other half come up sagging full o' big uns.' Hurry, Man'nle, an'
bring's a tub o' bait. There's luck afloat to-night."</p>
<p>The fish bit at the newly baited hooks from which their brethren had just
been taken, and Tom Platt and Long Jack moved methodically up and down the
length of the trawl, the boat's nose surging under the wet line of hooks,
stripping the sea-cucumbers that they called pumpkins, slatting off the
fresh-caught cod against the gunwale, rebaiting, and loading Manuel's dory till
dusk.</p>
<p>"I'll take no risks," said Disko then&mdash;"not with him floatin' around so
near. Abishai won't sink fer a week. Heave in the dories an' we'll dress daown
after supper."</p>
<p>That was a mighty dressing-down, attended by three or four blowing
grampuses. It lasted till nine o'clock, and Disko was thrice heard to chuckle
as Harvey pitched the split fish into the hold.</p>
<p>"Say, you're haulin' ahead dretful fast," said Dan, when they ground the
knives after the men had turned in. "There's somethin' of a sea to-night, an' I
hain't heard you make no remarks on it."</p>
<p>"Too busy," Harvey replied, testing a blade's edge. "Come to think of it,
she is a high-kicker."</p>
<p>The little schooner was gambolling all around her anchor among the
silver-tipped waves. Backing with a start of affected surprise at the sight of
the strained cable, she pounced on it like a kitten, while the spray of her
descent burst through the hawse-holes with the report of a gun. Shaking her
head, she would say: "Well, I'm sorry I can't stay any longer with you. I'm
going North," and would sidle off, halting suddenly with a dramatic rattle of
her rigging. "As I was just going to observe," she would begin, as gravely as a
drunken man addressing a lamp-post. The rest of the sentence (she acted her
words in dumb-show, of course) was lost in a fit of the fidgets, when she
behaved like a puppy chewing a string, a clumsy woman in a side-saddle, a hen
with her head cut off, or a cow stung by a hornet, exactly as the whims of the
sea took her.</p>
<p>"See her sayin' her piece. She's Patrick Henry naow," said Dan.</p>
<p>She swung sideways on a roller, and gesticulated with her jib-boom from port
to starboard.</p>
<p>"But-ez-fer me, give me liberty-er give me-death!"</p>
<p>Wop! She sat down in the moon-path on the water, courtesying with a flourish
of pride impressive enough had not the wheel-gear sniggered mockingly in its
box.</p>
<p>Harvey laughed aloud. "Why, it's just as if she was alive," he said.</p>
<p>"She's as stiddy as a haouse an' as dry as a herrin'," said Dan
enthusiastically, as he was slung across the deck in a batter of spray. "Fends
'em off an' fends 'em off, an' 'Don't ye come anigh me,' she sez. Look at
her&mdash;jest look at her! Sakes! You should see one o' them toothpicks
histin' up her anchor on her spike outer fifteen-fathom water."</p>
<p>"What's a toothpick, Dan?"</p>
<p>"Them new haddockers an' herrin'-boats. Fine's a yacht forward, with yacht
sterns to 'em, an' spike bowsprits, an' a haouse that 'u'd take our hold. I've
heard that Burgess himself he made the models fer three or four of 'em. Dad's
sot agin 'em on account o' their pitchin' an' joltin', but there's heaps o'
money in 'em. Dad can find fish, but he ain't no ways progressive&mdash;he
don't go with the march o' the times. They're chock-full o' labour-savin' jigs
an' sech all. 'Ever seed the Elector o' Gloucester? She's a daisy, ef she is a
toothpick."</p>
<p>"What do they cost, Dan?"</p>
<p>"Hills o' dollars. Fifteen thousand, p'haps; more, mebbe. There's gold-leaf
an' everything you kin think of." Then to himself, half under his breath,
"Guess I'd call her Hattie S., too."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>That was the first of many talks with Dan, who told Harvey why he would
transfer his dory's name to the imaginary Burgess-modelled haddocker. Harvey
heard a good deal about the real Hattie at Gloucester; saw a lock of her
hair&mdash;which Dan, finding fair words of no avail, had "hooked" as she sat
in front of him at school that winter&mdash;and a photograph. Hattie was about
fourteen years old, with an awful contempt for boys, and had been trampling on
Dan's heart through the winter. All this was revealed under oath of solemn
secrecy on moonlit decks, in the dead dark, or in choking fog; the whining
wheel behind them, the climbing deck before, and without, the unresting,
clamorous sea. Once, of course, as the boys came to know each other, there was
a fight, which raged from bow to stern till Penn came up and separated them,
but promised not to tell Disko, who thought fighting on watch rather worse than
sleeping. Harvey was no match for Dan physically, but it says a great deal for
his new training that he took his defeat and did not try to get even with his
conqueror by underhand methods.</p>
<p>That was after he had been cured of a string of boils between his elbows and
wrists, where the wet jersey and oilskins cut into the flesh. The salt water
stung them unpleasantly, but when they were ripe Dan treated them with Disko's
razor, and assured Harvey that now he was a "blooded Banker"; the affliction of
gurry-sores being the mark of the caste that claimed him.</p>
<p>Since he was a boy and very busy, he did not bother his head with too much
thinking. He was exceedingly sorry for his mother, and often longed to see her
and above all to tell her of this wonderful new life, and how brilliantly he
was acquitting himself in it. Otherwise he preferred not to wonder too much how
she was bearing the shock of his supposed death. But one day, as he stood on
the foc'sle ladder, guying the cook, who had accused him and Dan of hooking
fried pies, it occurred to him that this was a vast improvement on being
snubbed by strangers in the smoking-room of a hired liner.</p>
<p>He was a recognized part of the scheme of things on the We're Here; had his
place at the table and among the bunks; and could hold his own in the long
talks on stormy days, when the others were always ready to listen to what they
called his "fairy-tales" of his life ashore. It did not take him more than two
days and a quarter to feel that if he spoke of his own life&mdash;it seemed
very far away&mdash;no one except Dan (and even Dan's belief was sorely tried)
credited him. So he invented a friend, a boy he had heard of, who drove a
miniature four-pony drag in Toledo, Ohio, and ordered five suits of clothes at
a time and led things called "germans" at parties where the oldest girl was not
quite fifteen, but all the presents were solid silver. Salters protested that
this kind of yarn was desperately wicked, if not indeed positively blasphemous,
but he listened as greedily as the others; and their criticisms at the end gave
Harvey entirely new notions on "germans," clothes, cigarettes with gold-leaf
tips, rings, watches, scent, small dinner-parties, champagne, card-playing, and
hotel accommodation. Little by little he changed his tone when speaking of his
"friend," whom Long Jack had christened "the Crazy Kid," "the Gilt-edged Baby,"
"the Suckin' Vanderpoop," and other pet names; and with his sea-booted feet
cocked up on the table would even invent histories about silk pajamas and
specially imported neckwear, to the "friend's" discredit. Harvey was a very
adaptable person, with a keen eye and ear for every face and tone about
him.</p>
<p>Before long he knew where Disko kept the old greencrusted quadrant that they
called the "hog-yoke"&mdash;under the bed-bag in his bunk. When he took the
sun, and with the help of "The Old Farmer's" almanac found the latitude, Harvey
would jump down into the cabin and scratch the reckoning and date with a nail
on the rust of the stove-pipe. Now, the chief engineer of the liner could have
done no more, and no engineer of thirty years' service could have assumed one
half of the ancient-mariner air with which Harvey, first careful to spit over
the side, made public the schooner's position for that day, and then and not
till then relieved Disko of the quadrant. There is an etiquette in all these
things.</p>
<p>The said "hog-yoke," an Eldridge chart, the farming almanac, Blunt's "Coast
Pilot," and Bowditch's "Navigator" were all the weapons Disko needed to guide
him, except the deep-sea lead that was his spare eye. Harvey nearly slew Penn
with it when Tom Platt taught him first how to "fly the blue pigeon"; and,
though his strength was not equal to continuous sounding in any sort of a sea,
for calm weather with a seven-pound lead on shoal water Disko used him freely.
As Dan said:</p>
<p>"'Tain't soundin's dad wants. It's samples. Grease her up good, Harve."
Harvey would tallow the cup at the end, and carefully bring the sand, shell,
sludge, or whatever it might be, to Disko, who fingered and smelt it and gave
judgment As has been said, when Disko thought of cod he thought as a cod; and
by some long-tested mixture of instinct and experience, moved the We're Here
from berth to berth, always with the fish, as a blindfolded chess-player moves
on the unseen board.</p>
<p>But Disko's board was the Grand Bank&mdash;a triangle two hundred and fifty
miles on each side&mdash;a waste of wallowing sea, cloaked with dank fog, vexed
with gales, harried with drifting ice, scored by the tracks of the reckless
liners, and dotted with the sails of the fishing-fleet.</p>
<p>For days they worked in fog&mdash;Harvey at the bell&mdash;till, grown
familiar with the thick airs, he went out with Tom Platt, his heart rather in
his mouth. But the fog would not lift, and the fish were biting, and no one can
stay helplessly afraid for six hours at a time. Harvey devoted himself to his
lines and the gaff or gob-stick as Tom Platt called for them; and they rowed
back to the schooner guided by the bell and Tom's instinct; Manuel's conch
sounding thin and faint beside them. But it was an unearthly experience, and,
for the first time in a month, Harvey dreamed of the shifting, smoking floors
of water round the dory, the lines that strayed away into nothing, and the air
above that melted on the sea below ten feet from his straining eyes. A few days
later he was out with Manuel on what should have been forty-fathom bottom, but
the whole length of the roding ran out, and still the anchor found nothing, and
Harvey grew mortally afraid, for that his last touch with earth was lost.
"Whale-hole," said Manuel, hauling in. "That is good joke on Disko. Come!" and
he rowed to the schooner to find Tom Platt and the others jeering at the
skipper because, for once, he had led them to the edge of the barren
Whale-deep, the blank hole of the Grand Bank. They made another berth through
the fog, and that time the hair of Harvey's head stood up when he went out in
Manuel's dory. A whiteness moved in the whiteness of the fog with a breath like
the breath of the grave, and there was a roaring, a plunging, and spouting. It
was his first introduction to the dread summer berg of the Banks, and he
cowered in the bottom of the boat while Manuel laughed. There were days,
though, clear and soft and warm, when it seemed a sin to do anything but loaf
over the hand-lines and spank the drifting "sun-scalds" with an oar; and there
were days of light airs, when Harvey was taught how to steer the schooner from
one berth to another.</p>
<p>It thrilled through him when he first felt the keel answer to his band on
the spokes and slide over the long hollows as the foresail scythed back and
forth against the blue sky. That was magnificent, in spite of Disko saying that
it would break a snake's back to follow his wake. But, as usual, pride ran
before a fall. They were sailing on the wind with the staysail&mdash;an old
one, luckily&mdash;set, and Harvey jammed her right into it to show Dan how
completely he had mastered the art. The foresail went over with a bang, and the
foregaff stabbed and ripped through the staysail, which was, of course,
prevented from going over by the mainstay. They lowered the wreck in awful
silence, and Harvey spent his leisure hours for the next few days under Tom
Platt's lee, learning to use a needle and palm. Dan hooted with joy, for, as he
said, he had made the very same blunder himself in his early days.</p>
<p>Boylike, Harvey imitated all the men by turns, till he had combined Disko's
peculiar stoop at the wheel, Long Jack's swinging overhand when the lines were
hauled, Manuel's round-shouldered but effective stroke in a dory, and Tom
Platt's generous Ohio stride along the deck.</p>
<p>"'Tis beautiful to see how he takes to ut," said Long Jack, when Harvey was
looking out by the windlass one thick noon. "I'll lay my wage an' share 'tis
more'n half play-actin' to him, an' he consates himself he's a bowld mariner.
Watch his little bit av a back now!"</p>
<p>"That's the way we all begin," said Tom Platt. "The boys they make believe
all the time till they've cheated 'emselves into bein' men, an' so till they
die&mdash;pretendin' an' pretendin'. I done it on the old Ohio, I know. Stood
my first watch&mdash;harbor-watch&mdash;feelin' finer'n Farragut. Dan's full o'
the same kind o' notions. See 'em now, actin' to be genewine
moss-backs&mdash;very hair a rope-yarn an' blood Stockholm tar." He spoke down
the cabin stairs. "Guess you're mistook in your judgments fer once, Disko. What
in Rome made ye tell us all here the kid was crazy?"</p>
<p>"He wuz," Disko replied. "Crazy ez a loon when he come aboard; but I'll say
he's sobered up consid'ble sence. I cured him."</p>
<p>"He yarns good," said Tom Platt. "T'other night he told us abaout a kid of
his own size steerin' a cunnin' little rig an' four ponies up an' down Toledo,
Ohio, I think 'twas, an' givin' suppers to a crowd o' sim'lar kids. Cur'us kind
o' fairy-tale, but blame interestin'. He knows scores of 'em."</p>
<p>"Guess he strikes 'em outen his own head," Disko called from the cabin,
where he was busy with the logbook. "Stands to reason that sort is all made up.
It don't take in no one but Dan, an' he laughs at it. I've heard him, behind my
back."</p>
<p>"Yever hear what Sim'on Peter Ca'houn said when they whacked up a match
'twix' his sister Hitty an' Lorin' Jerauld, an' the boys put up that joke on
him daown to Georges?" drawled Uncle Salters, who was dripping peaceably under
the lee of the starboard dory-nest.</p>
<p>Tom Platt puffed at his pipe in scornful silence: he was a Cape Cod man, and
had not known that tale more than twenty years. Uncle Salters went on with a
rasping chuckie:</p>
<p>"Sim'on Peter Ca'houn he said, an' he was jest right, abaout Lorin', 'Ha'af
on the taown,' he said, 'an' t'other ha'af blame fool; an' they told me she's
married a 'ich man.' Sim'on Peter Ca'houn he hedn't no roof to his mouth, an'
talked that way."</p>
<p>"He didn't talk any Pennsylvania Dutch," Tom Platt replied. "You'd better
leave a Cape man to tell that tale. The Ca'houns was gypsies frum 'way
back."</p>
<p>"Wal, I don't profess to be any elocutionist," Salters said. "I'm comin' to
the moral o' things. That's jest abaout what aour Harve be! Ha'af on the taown,
an' t'other ha'af blame fool; an' there's some'll believe he's a rich man.
Yah!"</p>
<p>"Did ye ever think how sweet 'twould be to sail wid a full crew o'
Salterses?" said Long Jack. "Ha'af in the furrer an' other ha'af in the
muck-heap, as Ca'houn did not say, an' makes out he's a fisherman!"</p>
<p>A little laugh went round at Salters's expense.</p>
<p>Disko held his tongue, and wrought over the log-book that he kept in a
hatchet-faced, square hand; this was the kind of thing that ran on, page after
soiled page:</p>
<p>"July 17. This day thick fog and few fish. Made berth to northward. So ends
this day.</p>
<p>"July 18. This day comes in with thick fog. Caught a few fish.</p>
<p>"July 19. This day comes in with light breeze from N.E. and fine weather.
Made a berth to eastward. Caught plenty fish.</p>
<p>"July 20. This, the Sabbath, comes in with fog and light winds. So ends this
day. Total fish caught this week, 3,478."</p>
<p>They never worked on Sundays, but shaved, and washed themselves if it were
fine, and Pennsylvania sang hymns. Once or twice he suggested that, if it was
not an impertinence, he thought he could preach a little. Uncle Salters nearly
jumped down his throat at the mere notion, reminding him that he was not a
preacher and mustn't think of such things. "We'd hev him rememberin' Johns-town
next," Salters explained, "an' what would happen then?" so they compromised on
his reading aloud from a book called "Josephus." It was an old leather-bound
volume, smelling of a hundred voyages, very solid and very like the Bible, but
enlivened with accounts of battles and sieges; and they read it nearly from
cover to cover. Otherwise Penn was a silent little body. He would not utter a
word for three days on end sometimes, though he played checkers, listened to
the songs, and laughed at the stories. When they tried to stir him up, he would
answer: "I don't wish to seem unneighbourly, but it is because I have nothing
to say. My head feels quite empty. I've almost forgotten my name." He would
turn to Uncle Salters with an expectant smile.</p>
<p>"Why, Pennsylvania Pratt," Salters would shout "You'll fergit me next!"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;never," Penn would say, shutting his lips firmly. "Pennsylvania
Pratt, of course," he would repeat over and over. Sometimes it was Uncle
Salters who forgot, and told him he was Haskins or Rich or McVitty; but Penn
was equally content&mdash;till next time.</p>
<p>He was always very tender with Harvey, whom he pitied both as a lost child
and as a lunatic; and when Salters saw that Penn liked the boy, he relaxed,
too. Salters was not an amiable person (He esteemed it his business to keep the
boys in order); and the first time Harvey, in fear and trembling, on a still
day, managed to shin up to the main-truck (Dan was behind him ready to help),
he esteemed it his duty to hang Salters's big sea-boots up there&mdash;a sight
of shame and derision to the nearest schooner. With Disko, Harvey took no
liberties; not even when the old man dropped direct orders, and treated him,
like the rest of the crew, to "Don't you want to do so and so?" and "Guess
you'd better," and so forth. There was something about the clean-shaven lips
and the puckered corners of the eyes that was mightily sobering to young
blood.</p>
<p>Disko showed him the meaning of the thumbed and pricked chart, which, he
said, laid over any government publication whatsoever; led him, pencil in hand,
from berth to berth over the whole string of banks&mdash;Le Have, Western,
Banquereau, St. Pierre, Green, and Grand&mdash;talking "cod" meantime. Taught
him, too, the principle on which the "hog-yoke" was worked.</p>
<p>In this Harvey excelled Dan, for he had inherited a head for figures, and
the notion of stealing information from one glimpse of the sullen Bank sun
appealed to all his keen wits. For other sea-matters his age handicapped him.
As Disko said, he should have begun when he was ten. Dan could bait up trawl or
lay his hand on any rope in the dark; and at a pinch, when Uncle Salters had a
gurry-score on his palm, could dress down by sense of touch. He could steer in
anything short of half a gale from the feel of the wind on his face, humouring
the <i>We're Here</i> just when she needed it. These things he did as
automatically as he skipped about the rigging, or made his dory a part of his
own will and body. But he could not communicate his knowledge to Harvey.</p>
<p>Still there was a good deal of general information flying about the schooner
on stormy days, when they lay up in the foc'sle or sat on the cabin lockers,
while spare eye-bolts, leads, and rings rolled and rattled in the pauses of the
talk. Disko spoke of whaling voyages in the Fifties; of great she-whales slain
beside their young; of death agonies on the black tossing seas, and blood that
spurted forty feet in the air; of boats smashed to splinters; of patent rockets
that went off wrong-end-first and bombarded the trembling crews; of cutting-in
and boiling-down, and that terrible "nip" of '71, when twelve hundred men were
made homeless on the ice in three days&mdash;wonderful tales, all true. But
more wonderful still were his stories of the cod, and how they argued and
reasoned on their private businesses deep down below the keel.</p>
<p>Long Jack's tastes ran more to the supernatural. He held them silent with
ghastly stories of the "Yo-hoes" on Monomoy Beach, that mock and terrify lonely
clam-diggers; of sand-walkers and dune-haunters who were never properly buried;
of hidden treasure on Fire Island guarded by the spirits of Kidd's men; of
ships that sailed in the fog straight over Truro township; of that harbor in
Maine where no one but a stranger will lie at anchor twice in a certain place
because of a dead crew who row alongside at midnight with the anchor in the bow
of their old-fashioned boat, whistling&mdash;not calling, but
whistling&mdash;for the soul of the man who broke their rest.</p>
<p>Harvey had a notion that the east coast of his native land, from Mount
Desert south, was populated chiefly by people who took their horses there in
the summer and entertained in country-houses with hardwood floors and Vantine
portires. He laughed at the ghost-tales,&mdash;not as much as he would have
done a month before,&mdash;but ended by sitting still and shuddering.</p>
<p>Tom Platt dealt with his interminable trip round the Horn on the old Ohio in
flogging days, with a navy more extinct than the dodo&mdash;the navy that
passed away in the great war. He told them how red-hot shot are dropped into a
cannon, a wad of wet clay between them and the cartridge; how they sizzle and
reek when they strike wood, and how the little ship-boys of the Miss Jim Buck
hove water over them and shouted to the fort to try again. And he told tales of
blockade&mdash;long weeks of swaying at anchor, varied only by the departure
and return of steamers that had used up their coal (there was no chance for the
sailing-ships); of gales and cold that kept two hundred men, night and day,
pounding and chopping at the ice on cable, blocks, and rigging, when the galley
was as red-hot as the fort's shot, and men drank cocoa by the bucket. Tom Platt
had no use for steam. His service closed when that thing was comparatively new.
He admitted that it was a specious invention in time of peace, but looked
hopefully for the day when sails should come back again on ten-thousand-ton
frigates with hundred-and-ninety-foot booms.</p>
<p>Manuel's talk was slow and gentle&mdash;all about pretty girls in Madeira
washing clothes in the dry beds of streams, by moonlight, under waving bananas;
legends of saints, and tales of queer dances or fights away in the cold
Newfoundland baiting-ports. Salters was mainly agricultural; for, though he
read "Josephus" and expounded it, his mission in life was to prove the value of
green manures, and specially of clover, against every form of phosphate
whatsoever. He grew libellous about phosphates; he dragged greasy "Orange Judd"
books from his bunk and intoned them, wagging his finger at Harvey, to whom it
was all Greek. Little Penn was so genuinely pained when Harvey made fun of
Salters's lectures that the boy gave it up, and suffered in polite silence.
That was very good for Harvey.</p>
<p>The cook naturally did not join in these conversations. As a rule, he spoke
only when it was absolutely necessary; but at times a queer gift of speech
descended on him, and he held forth, half in Gaelic, half in broken English, an
hour at a time. He was especially communicative with the boys, and he never
withdrew his prophecy that one day Harvey would be Dan's master, and that he
would see it. He told them of mail-carrying in the winter up Cape Breton way,
of the dog-train that goes to Coudray, and of the ram-steamer <i>Arctic</i>,
that breaks the ice between the mainland and Prince Edward Island. Then he told
them stories that his mother had told him, of life far to the southward, where
water never froze; and he said that when he died his soul would go to lie down
on a warm white beach of sand with palm-trees waving above. That seemed to the
boys a very odd idea for a man who had never seen a palm in his life. Then,
too, regularly at each meal, he would ask Harvey, and Harvey alone, whether the
cooking was to his taste; and this always made the "second half" laugh. Yet
they had a great respect for the cook's judgment, and in their hearts
considered Harvey something of a mascot by consequence.</p>
<p>And while Harvey was taking in knowledge of new things at each pore and hard
health with every gulp of the good air, the We're Here went her ways and did
her business on the Bank, and the silvery-gray kenches of well-pressed fish
mounted higher and higher in the hold. No one day's work was out of common, but
the average days were many and close together.</p>
<p>Naturally, a man of Disko's reputation was closely watched&mdash;"scrowged
upon," Dan called it&mdash;by his neighbours, but he had a very pretty knack of
giving them the slip through the curdling, glidy fog-banks. Disko avoided
company for two reasons. He wished to make his own experiments, in the first
place; and in the second, he objected to the mixed gatherings of a fleet of all
nations. The bulk of them were mainly Gloucester boats, with a scattering from
Provincetown, Harwich, Chatham, and some of the Maine ports, but the crews drew
from goodness knows where. Risk breeds recklessness, and when greed is added
there are fine chances for every kind of accident in the crowded fleet, which,
like a mob of sheep, is huddled round some unrecognized leader. "Let the two
Jeraulds lead 'em," said Disko. "We're baound to lay among 'em for a spell on
the Eastern Shoals; though ef luck holds, we won't hev to lay long. Where we
are naow, Harve, ain't considered noways good graound."</p>
<p>"Ain't it?" said Harvey, who was drawing water (he had learned just how to
wiggle the bucket), after an unusually long dressing-down. "Shouldn't mind
striking some poor ground for a change, then."</p>
<p>"All the graound I want to see&mdash;don't want to strike her&mdash;is
Eastern Point," said Dan. "Say, Dad, it looks's if we wouldn't hev to lay
more'n two weeks on the Shoals. You'll meet all the comp'ny you want then,
Harve. That's the time we begin to work. No reg'lar meals fer no one then.
'Mug-up when ye're hungry, an' sleep when ye can't keep awake. Good job you
wasn't picked up a month later than you was, or we'd never ha' had you dressed
in shape fer the Old Virgin."</p>
<p>Harvey understood from the Eldridge chart that the Old Virgin and a nest of
curiously named shoals were the turning-point of the cruise, and that with good
luck they would wet the balance of their salt there. But seeing the size of the
Virgin (it was one tiny dot), he wondered how even Disko with the hog-yoke and
the lead could find her. He learned later that Disko was entirely equal to that
and any other business and could even help others. A big four-by-five
blackboard hung in the cabin, and Harvey never understood the need of it till,
after some blinding thick days, they heard the unmelodious tooting of a
foot-power fog-horn&mdash;a machine whose note is as that of a consumptive
elephant.</p>
<p>They were making a short berth, towing the anchor under their foot to save
trouble. "Square-rigger bellowin' fer his latitude," said Long Jack. The
dripping red head-sails of a bark glided out of the fog, and the <i>We're
Here</i> rang her bell thrice, using sea shorthand.</p>
<p>The larger boat backed her topsail with shrieks and shoutings.</p>
<p>"Frenchman," said Uncle Salters, scornfully. "Miquelon boat from St. Malo."
The farmer had a weatherly sea-eye. "I'm 'most outer 'baccy, too, Disko."</p>
<p>"Same here," said Tom Platt. "Hi! Backez vous&mdash;backez vous! Standez
awayez, you butt-ended mucho-bono! Where you from&mdash;St. Malo, eh?"</p>
<p>"Ah, ha! Mucho bono! Oui! oui! Clos Poulet&mdash;St. Malo! St. Pierre et
Miquelon," cried the other crowd, waving woollen caps and laughing. Then all
together, "Bord! Bord!"</p>
<p>"Bring up the board, Danny. Beats me how them Frenchmen fetch anywheres,
exceptin' America's fairish broadly. Forty-six forty-nine's good enough fer
them; an' I guess it's abaout right, too."</p>
<p>Dan chalked the figures on the board, and they hung it in the main-rigging
to a chorus of mercis from the bark.</p>
<p>"Seems kinder uneighbourly to let 'em swedge off like this," Salters
suggested, feeling in his pockets.</p>
<p>"Hev ye learned French then sence last trip?" said Disko. "I don't want no
more stone-ballast hove at us 'long o' your callin' Miquelon boats 'footy
cochins,' same's you did off Le Have."</p>
<p>"Harmon Rush he said that was the way to rise 'em. Plain United States is
good enough fer me. We're all dretful short on terbakker. Young feller, don't
you speak French?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," said Harvey valiantly; and he bawled: "Hi! Say! Arretez vous!
Attendez! Nous sommes venant pour tabac."</p>
<p>"Ah, tabac, tabac!" they cried, and laughed again.</p>
<p>"That hit 'em. Let's heave a dory over, anyway," said Tom Platt. "I don't
exactly hold no certificates on French, but I know another lingo that goes, I
guess. Come on, Harve, an' interpret."</p>
<p>The raffle and confusion when he and Harvey were hauled up the bark's black
side was indescribable. Her cabin was all stuck round with glaring coloured
prints of the Virgin&mdash;the Virgin of Newfoundland, they called her. Harvey
found his French of no recognized Bank brand, and his conversation was limited
to nods and grins. But Tom Platt waved his arms and got along swimmingly. The
captain gave him a drink of unspeakable gin, and the opera-comique crew, with
their hairy throats, red caps, and long knives, greeted him as a brother. Then
the trade began. They had tobacco, plenty of it&mdash;American, that had never
paid duty to France. They wanted chocolate and crackers. Harvey rowed back to
arrange with the cook and Disko, who owned the stores, and on his return the
cocoa-tins and cracker-bags were counted out by the Frenchman's wheel. It
looked like a piratical division of loot; but Tom Platt came out of it roped
with black pigtail and stuffed with cakes of chewing and smoking tobacco. Then
those jovial mariners swung off into the mist, and the last Harvey heard was a
gay chorus:</p>
<blockquote>"Par derriere chez ma tante,<br>
Il'y a un bois joli,<br>
Et le rossignol y chante<br>
Et le jour et la nuit....<br>
<br>
Que donneriez vous, belle,<br>
Qui l'amenerait ici?<br>
Je donnerai Quebec,<br>
Sorel et Saint Denis."</blockquote>
<p>"How was it my French didn't go, and your sign-talk did?" Harvey demanded
when the barter had been distributed among the We're Heres.</p>
<p>"Sign-talk!" Platt guffawed. "Well, yes, 'twas sign-talk, but a heap older'n
your French, Harve. Them French boats are chockfull o' Freemasons, an' that's
why."</p>
<p>"Are you a Freemason, then?"</p>
<p>"Looks that way, don't it?" said the man-o'-war's man, stuffing his pipe;
and Harvey had another mystery of the deep sea to brood upon.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>The thing that struck him most was the exceedingly casual way in which some
craft loafed about the broad Atlantic. Fishing-boats, as Dan said, were
naturally dependent on the courtesy and wisdom of their neighbours; but one
expected better things of steamers. That was after another interesting
interview, when they had been chased for three miles by a big lumbering old
cattle-boat, all boarded over on the upper deck, that smelt like a thousand
cattle-pens. A very excited officer yelled at them through a speaking-trumpet,
and she lay and lollopped helplessly on the water while Disko ran the <i>We're
Here</i> under her lee and gave the skipper a piece of his mind. "Where might
ye be&mdash;eh? Ye don't deserve to be anywheres. You barn-yard tramps go
hoggin' the road on the high seas with no blame consideration fer your
neighbours, an' your eyes in your coffee-cups instid o' in your silly
heads."</p>
<p>At this the skipper danced on the bridge and said something about Disko's
own eyes. "We haven't had an observation for three days. D'you suppose we can
run her blind?" he shouted.</p>
<p>"Wa-al, I can," Disko retorted. "What's come to your lead? Et it? Can't ye
smell bottom, or are them cattle too rank?"</p>
<p>"What d' ye feed 'em?" said Uncle Salters with intense seriousness, for the
smell of the pens woke all the farmer in him. "They say they fall off dretful
on a v'yage. Dunno as it's any o' my business, but I've a kind o' notion that
oil-cake broke small an' sprinkled&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Thunder!" said a cattle-man in a red jersey as he looked over the side.
"What asylum did they let His Whiskers out of?"</p>
<p>"Young feller," Salters began, standing up in the fore-rigging, "let me tell
yeou 'fore we go any further that I've&mdash;"</p>
<p>The officer on the bridge took off his cap with immense politeness. "Excuse
me," he said, "but I've asked for my reckoning. If the agricultural person with
the hair will kindly shut his head, the sea-green barnacle with the wall-eye
may per-haps condescend to enlighten us."</p>
<p>"Naow you've made a show o' me, Salters," said Disko, angrily. He could not
stand up to that particular sort of talk, and snapped out the latitude and
longitude without more lectures.</p>
<p>"Well, that's a boat-load of lunatics, sure," said the skipper, as he rang
up the engine-room and tossed a bundle of newspapers into the schooner.</p>
<p>"Of all the blamed fools, next to you, Salters, him an' his crowd are abaout
the likeliest I've ever seen," said Disko as the <i>We're Here</i> slid away.
"I was jest givin' him my jedgment on lullsikin' round these waters like a lost
child, an' you must cut in with your fool farmin'. Can't ye never keep things
sep'rate?"</p>
<p>Harvey, Dan, and the others stood back, winking one to the other and full of
joy; but Disko and Salters wrangled seriously till evening, Salters arguing
that a cattle-boat was practically a barn on blue water, and Disko insisting
that, even if this were the case, decency and fisher-pride demanded that he
should have kept "things sep'rate." Long Jack stood it in silence for a
time,&mdash;an angry skipper makes an unhappy crew,&mdash;and then he spoke
across the table after supper:</p>
<p>"Fwhat's the good o' bodderin' fwhat they'll say?" said he.</p>
<p>"They'll tell that tale agin us fer years&mdash;that's all," said Disko.
"Oil-cake sprinkled!"</p>
<p>"With salt, o' course," said Salters, impenitent, reading the farming
reports from a week-old New York paper.</p>
<p>"It's plumb mortifyin' to all my feelin's," the skipper went on.</p>
<p>"Can't see ut that way," said Long Jack, the peacemaker "Look at here,
Disko! Is there another packet afloat this day in this weather cud ha' met a
tramp an' over an' above givin' her her reckonin',&mdash;over an' above that, I
say,&mdash;cud ha' discoorsed wid her quite intelligent on the management av
steers an' such at sea? Forgit ut! Av coorse they will not. 'Twas the most
compenjus conversation that iver accrued. Double game an' twice
runnin'&mdash;all to us." Dan kicked Harvey under the table, and Harvey choked
in his cup.</p>
<p>"Well," said Salters, who felt that his honour had been somewhat plastered,
"I said I didn't know as 'twuz any business o' mine, 'fore I spoke."</p>
<p>"An' right there," said Tom Platt, experienced in discipline and
etiquette&mdash;"right there, I take it, Disko, you should ha' asked him to
stop ef the conversation wuz likely, in your jedgment, to be anyways&mdash;what
it shouldn't."</p>
<p>"Dunno but that's so," said Disko, who saw his way to an honourable retreat
from a fit of the dignities.</p>
<p>"Why, o' course it was so," said Salters, "you bein' skipper here; an' I'd
cheerful hev stopped on a hint&mdash;not from any leadin' or conviction, but
fer the sake o' bearin' an example to these two blame boys of aours."</p>
<p>"Didn't I tell you, Harve, 'twould come araound to us 'fore we'd done?
Always those blame boys. But I wouldn't have missed the show fer a half-share
in a halibutter," Dan whispered.</p>
<p>"Still, things should ha' been kep' sep'rate," said Disko, and the light of
new argument lit in Salters's eye as he crumbled cut plug into his pipe.</p>
<p>"There's a power av vartue in keepin' things sep'rate," said Long Jack,
intent on stilling the storm. "That's fwhat Steyning of Steyning and Hare's
f'und when he sent Counahan fer skipper on the <i>Marilla D. Kuhn</i>, instid
o' Cap. Newton that was took with inflam'try rheumatism an' couldn't go.
Counahan the Navigator we called him."</p>
<p>"Nick Counahan he never went aboard fer a night 'thout a pond o' rum
somewheres in the manifest," said Tom Platt, playing up to the lead. "He used
to bum araound the c'mission houses to Boston lookin' fer the Lord to make him
captain of a tow-boat on his merits. Sam Coy, up to Atlantic Avenoo, give him
his board free fer a year or more on account of his stories.</p>
<p>"Counahan the Navigator! Tck! Tck! Dead these fifteen year, ain't he?"</p>
<p>"Seventeen, I guess. He died the year the <i>Caspar McVeagh</i> was built;
but he could niver keep things sep'rate. Steyning tuk him fer the reason the
thief tuk the hot stove&mdash;bekaze there was nothin' else that season. The
men was all to the Banks, and Counahan he whacked up an iverlastin' hard crowd
fer crew. Rum! Ye cud ha' floated the <i>Marilla</i>, insurance an' all, in
fwhat they stowed aboard her. They lef' Boston Harbour for the great Grand Bank
wid a roarin' nor'wester behind 'em an' all hands full to the bung. An' the
hivens looked after thim, for divil a watch did they set, an' divil a rope did
they lay hand to, till they'd seen the bottom av a fifteen-gallon cask o'
bug-juice. That was about wan week, so far as Counahan remembered. (If I cud
only tell the tale as he told ut!) All that whoile the wind blew like ould
glory, an' the <i>Marilla</i>&mdash;'twas summer, and they'd give her a
foretopmast&mdash;struck her gait and kept ut. Then Counahan tuk the hog-yoke
an' thrembled over it for a whoile, an' made out, betwix' that an' the chart
an' the singin' in his head, that they was to the south'ard o' Sable Island,
gettin' along glorious, but speakin' nothin'. Then they broached another keg,
an' quit speculatin' about anythin' fer another spell. The <i>Marilla</i> she
lay down whin she dropped Boston Light, and she never lufted her lee-rail up to
that time&mdash;hustlin' on one an' the same slant. But they saw no weed, nor
gulls, nor schooners; an' prisintly they obsarved they'd bin out a matter o'
fourteen days and they mis-trusted the Bank has suspinded payment. So they
sounded, an' got sixty fathom. 'That's me,' sez Counahan. 'That's me iv'ry
time! I've run her slat on the Bank fer you, an' when we get thirty fathom
we'll turn in like little men. Counahan is the b'y,' sez he. 'Counahan the
Navigator!'</p>
<p>"Nex' cast they got ninety. Sez Counahan: 'Either the lead-line's tuk to
stretchin' or else the Bank's sunk.'</p>
<p>"They hauled ut up, bein' just about in that state when ut seemed right an'
reasonable, and sat down on the deck countin' the knots, an' gettin' her
snarled up hijjus. The <i>Marilla</i> she'd struck her gait, an' she hild ut,
an' prisintly along came a tramp, an' Counahan spoke her.</p>
<p>"'Hev ye seen any fishin'-boats now?' sez he, quite casual.</p>
<p>"'There's lashin's av them off the Irish coast,' sez the tramp.</p>
<p>"'Aah! go shake yerself,' sez Counahan. 'Fwhat have I to do wid the Irish
coast?'</p>
<p>"'Then fwhat are ye doin' here?' sez the tramp.</p>
<p>"'Sufferin' Christianity!' sez Counahan (he always said that whin his pumps
sucked an' he was not feelin' good)&mdash;'Sufferin' Christianity!' he sez,
'where am I at?'</p>
<p>"'Thirty-five mile west-sou'west o' Cape Clear,' sez the tramp, 'if that's
any consolation to you.'</p>
<p>"Counahan fetched wan jump, four feet sivin inches, measured by the
cook.</p>
<p>"'Consolation!' sez he, bould as brass. 'D'ye take me fer a dialect?
Thirty-five mile from Cape Clear, an' fourteen days from Boston Light.
Sufferin' Christianity, 'tis a record, an' by the same token I've a mother to
Skibbereen!' Think av ut! The gall av um! But ye see he could niver keep things
sep'rate.</p>
<p>"The crew was mostly Cork an' Kerry men, barrin' one Marylander that wanted
to go back, but they called him a mutineer, an' they ran the ould
<i>Marilla</i> into Skibbereen, an' they had an illigant time visitin' around
with frinds on the ould sod fer a week. Thin they wint back, an' it cost 'em
two an' thirty days to beat to the Banks again. 'Twas gettin' on towards fall,
and grub was low, so Counahan ran her back to Boston, wid no more bones to
ut."</p>
<p>"And what did the firm say?" Harvey demanded.</p>
<p>"Fwhat could they? The fish was on the Banks, an' Counahan was at T-wharf
talkin' av his record trip east! They tuk their satisfaction out av that, an'
ut all came av not keepin' the crew and the rum sep'rate in the first place;
an' confusin' Skibbereen wid 'Queereau, in the second. Counahan the Navigator,
rest his sowl! He was an imprompju citizen!"</p>
<p>"Once I was in the Lucy Holmes," said Manuel, in his gentle voice. "They not
want any of her feesh in Gloucester. Eh, wha-at? Give us no price. So we go
across the water, and think to sell to some Fayal man. Then it blow fresh, and
we cannot see well. Eh, wha-at? Then it blow some more fresh, and we go down
below and drive very fast&mdash;no one know where. By and by we see a land, and
it get some hot. Then come two, three nigger in a brick. Eh, wha-at? We ask
where we are, and they say&mdash;now, what you all think?"</p>
<p>"Grand Canary," said Disko, after a moment. Manuel shook his head,
smiling.</p>
<p>"Blanco," said Tom Platt.</p>
<p>"No. Worse than that. We was below Bezagos, and the brick she was from
Liberia! So we sell our feesh there! Not bad, so? Eh, wha-at?"</p>
<p>"Can a schooner like this go right across to Africa?" said Harvey.</p>
<p>"Go araound the Horn ef there's anythin' worth goin' fer, and the grub holds
aout," said Disko. "My father he run his packet, an' she was a kind o' pinkey,
abaout fifty ton, I guess,&mdash;the Rupert,&mdash;he run her over to
Greenland's icy mountains the year ha'af our fleet was tryin' after cod there.
An' what's more, he took my mother along with him,&mdash;to show her haow the
money was earned, I presoom,&mdash;an' they was all iced up, an' I was born at
Disko. Don't remember nothin' abaout it, o' course. We come back when the ice
eased in the spring, but they named me fer the place. Kinder mean trick to put
up on a baby, but we're all baound to make mistakes in aour lives."</p>
<p>"Sure! Sure!" said Salters, wagging his head. "All baound to make mistakes,
an' I tell you two boys here thet after you've made a mistake&mdash;ye don't
make fewer'n a hundred a day&mdash;the next best thing's to own up to it like
men."</p>
<p>Long Jack winked one tremendous wink that embraced all hands except Disko
and Salters, and the incident was closed.</p>
<p>Then they made berth after berth to the northward, the dories out almost
every day, running along the east edge of the Grand Bank in thirty- to
forty-fathom water, and fishing steadily.</p>
<p>It was here Harvey first met the squid, who is one of the best cod-baits,
but uncertain in his moods. They were waked out of their bunks one black night
by yells of "Squid O!" from Salters, and for an hour and a half every soul
aboard hung over his squid-jig&mdash;a piece of lead painted red and armed at
the lower end with a circle of pins bent backward like half-opened umbrella
ribs. The squid&mdash;for some unknown reason&mdash;likes, and wraps himself
round, this thing, and is hauled up ere he can escape from the pins. But as he
leaves his home he squirts first water and next ink into his captor's face; and
it was curious to see the men weaving their heads from side to side to dodge
the shot. They were as black as sweeps when the flurry ended; but a pile of
fresh squid lay on the deck, and the large cod thinks very well of a little
shiny piece of squid tentacle at the tip of a clam-baited hook. Next day they
caught many fish, and met the <i>Carrie Pitman</i>, to whom they shouted their
luck, and she wanted to trade&mdash;seven cod for one fair-sized squid; but
Disko would not agree at the price, and the <i>Carrie</i> dropped sullenly to
leeward and anchored half a mile away, in the hope of striking on to some for
herself.</p>
<p>Disco said nothing till after supper, when he sent Dan and Manuel out to
buoy the <i>We're Here's</i> cable and announced his intention of turning in
with the broad-axe. Dan naturally repeated these remarks to the dory from the
<i>Carrie</i>, who wanted to know why they were buoying their cable, since they
were not on rocky bottom.</p>
<p>"Dad sez he wouldn't trust a ferryboat within five mile o' you," Dan howled
cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Why don't he git out, then? Who's hinderin'?" said the other.</p>
<p>"'Cause you've jest the same ez lee-bowed him, an' he don't take that from
any boat, not to speak o' sech a driftin' gurry-butt as you be."</p>
<p>"She ain't driftin' any this trip," said the man angrily, for the <i>Carrie
Pitman</i> had an unsavory reputation for breaking her ground-tackle.</p>
<p>"Then haow d'you make berths?" said Dan. "It's her best p'int o' sailin'.
An' ef she's quit driftin', what in thunder are you doin' with a new jib-boom?"
That shot went home.</p>
<p>"Hey, you Portugoosy organ-grinder, take your monkey back to Gloucester. Go
back to school, Dan Troop," was the answer.</p>
<p>"O-ver-alls! O-ver-alls!" yelled Dan, who knew that one of the
<i>Carrie's</i> crew had worked in an overall factory the winter before.</p>
<p>"Shrimp! Gloucester shrimp! Git aout, you Novy!"</p>
<p>To call a Gloucester man a Nova Scotian is not well received. Dan answered
in kind.</p>
<p>"Novy yourself, ye Scrabble-towners! ye Chatham wreckers! Git aout with your
brick in your stockin'!" And the forces separated, but Chatham had the worst of
it.</p>
<p>"I knew haow 'twould be," said Disko. "She's drawed the wind raound already.
Some one oughter put a deesist on thet packet. She'll snore till midnight, an'
jest when we're gettin' our sleep she'll strike adrift. Good job we ain't
crowded with craft hereaways. But I ain't goin' to up anchor fer Chatham. She
may hold."</p>
<p>The wind, which had hauled round, rose at sundown and blew steadily. There
was not enough sea, though, to disturb even a dory's tackle, but the <i>Carrie
Pitman</i> was a law unto herself. At the end of the boys' watch they heard the
crack-crack-crack of a huge muzzle-loading revolver aboard her.</p>
<p>"Glory, glory, hallelujah!" sung Dan. "Here she comes, Dad; butt-end first,
walkin' in her sleep same's she done on 'Queereau."</p>
<p>Had she been any other boat Disko would have taken his chances, but now he
cut the cable as the <i>Carrie Pitman</i>, with all the North Atlantic to play
in, lurched down directly upon them. The <i>We're Here</i>, under jib and
riding-sail, gave her no more room than was absolutely necessary,&mdash;Disko
did not wish to spend a week hunting for his cable,&mdash;but scuttled up into
the wind as the <i>Carrie</i> passed within easy hail, a silent and angry boat,
at the mercy of a raking broadside of Bank chaff.</p>
<p>"Good evenin'," said Disko, raising his head-gear, "an' haow does your
garden grow?"</p>
<p>"Go to Ohio an' hire a mule," said Uncle Salters. "We don't want no farmers
here."</p>
<p>"Will I lend YOU my dory-anchor?" cried Long Jack.</p>
<p>"Unship your rudder an' stick it in the mud," bawled Tom Platt.</p>
<p>"Say!" Dan's voice rose shrill and high, as he stood on the wheel-box.
"Sa-ay! Is there a strike in the o-ver-all factory; or hev they hired girls, ye
Shackamaxons?"</p>
<p>"Veer out the tiller-lines," cried Harvey, "and nail 'em to the bottom!"
That was a salt-flavoured jest he had been put up to by Tom Platt. Manuel
leaned over the stern and yelled: "Johanna Morgan play the organ! Ahaaaa!" He
flourished his broad thumb with a gesture of unspeakable contempt and derision,
while little Penn covered himself with glory by piping up: "Gee a little! Hssh!
Come here. Haw!"</p>
<p>They rode on their chain for the rest of the night, a short, snappy, uneasy
motion, as Harvey found, and wasted half the forenoon recovering the cable. But
the boys agreed the trouble was cheap at the price of triumph and glory, and
they thought with grief over all the beautiful things that they might have said
to the discomfited <i>Carrie</i>.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>Next day they fell in with more sails, all circling slowly from the east
northerly towards the west. But just when they expected to make the shoals by
the Virgin the fog shut down, and they anchored, surrounded by the tinklings of
invisible bells. There was not much fishing, but occasionally dory met dory in
the fog and exchanged news.</p>
<p>That night, a little before dawn, Dan and Harvey, who had been sleeping most
of the day, tumbled out to "hook" fried pies. There was no reason why they
should not have taken them openly; but they tasted better so, and it made the
cook angry. The heat and smell below drove them on deck with their plunder, and
they found Disko at the bell, which he handed over to Harvey.</p>
<p>"Keep her goin'," said he. "I mistrust I hear somethin'. Ef it's anything,
I'm best where I am so's to get at things."</p>
<p>It was a forlorn little jingle; the thick air seemed to pinch it off, and in
the pauses Harvey heard the muffled shriek of a liner's siren, and he knew
enough of the Banks to know what that meant. It came to him, with horrible
distinctness, how a boy in a cherry-coloured jersey&mdash;he despised fancy
blazers now with all a fisher-man's contempt&mdash;how an ignorant, rowdy boy
had once said it would be "great" if a steamer ran down a fishing-boat. That
boy had a stateroom with a hot and cold bath, and spent ten minutes each
morning picking over a gilt-edged bill of fare. And that same boy&mdash;no, his
very much older brother&mdash;was up at four of the dim dawn in streaming,
crackling oilskins, hammering, literally for the dear life, on a bell smaller
than the steward's breakfast-bell, while somewhere close at hand a thirty-foot
steel stem was storming along at twenty miles an hour! The bitterest thought of
all was that there were folks asleep in dry, upholstered cabins who would never
learn that they had massacred a boat before breakfast. So Harvey rang the
bell.</p>
<p>"Yes, they slow daown one turn o' their blame propeller," said Dan, applying
himself to Manuel's conch, "fer to keep inside the law, an' that's consolin'
when we're all at the bottom. Hark to her! She's a humper!"</p>
<p>"Aooo-whoo-whupp!" went the siren. "Wingle-tingle-tink," went the bell.
"Graaa-ouch!" went the conch, while sea and sky were all mired up in milky fog.
Then Harvey felt that he was near a moving body, and found himself looking up
and up at the wet edge of a cliff-like bow, leaping, it seemed, directly over
the schooner. A jaunty little feather of water curled in front of it, and as it
lifted it showed a long ladder of Roman numerals-XV., XVI., XVII., XVIII., and
so forth&mdash;on a salmon-coloured gleaming side. It tilted forward and
downward with a heart-stilling "Ssssooo"; the ladder disappeared; a line of
brass-rimmed port-holes flashed past; a jet of steam puffed in Harvey's
helplessly uplifted hands; a spout of hot water roared along the rail of the
<i>We're Here</i>, and the little schooner staggered and shook in a rush of
screw-torn water, as a liner's stern vanished in the fog. Harvey got ready to
faint or be sick, or both, when he heard a crack like a trunk thrown on a
sidewalk, and, all small in his ear, a far-away telephone voice drawling:
"Heave to! You've sunk us!"</p>
<p>"Is it us?" he gasped.</p>
<p>"No! Boat out yonder. Ring! We're goin' to look," said Dan, running out a
dory.</p>
<p>In half a minute all except Harvey, Penn, and the cook were overside and
away. Presently a schooner's stump-foremast, snapped clean across, drifted past
the bows. Then an empty green dory came by, knocking on the <i>We're Here's</i>
side, as though she wished to be taken in. Then followed something, face down,
in a blue jersey, but&mdash;it was not the whole of a man. Penn changed colour
and caught his breath with a click. Harvey pounded despairingly at the bell,
for he feared they might be sunk at any minute, and he jumped at Dan's hail as
the crew came back.</p>
<p>"The Jennie Cushman," said Dan, hysterically, "cut clean in
half&mdash;graound up an' trompled on at that! Not a quarter of a mile away.
Dad's got the old man. There ain't any one else, and&mdash;there was his son,
too. Oh, Harve, Harve, I can't stand it! I've seen&mdash;" He dropped his head
on his arms and sobbed while the others dragged a gray-headed man aboard.</p>
<p>"What did you pick me up for?" the stranger groaned. "Disko, what did you
pick me up for?"</p>
<p>Disko dropped a heavy hand on his shoulder, for the man's eyes were wild and
his lips trembled as he stared at the silent crew. Then up and spoke
Pennsylvania Pratt, who was also Haskins or Rich or McVitty when Uncle Salters
forgot; and his face was changed on him from the face of a fool to the
countenance of an old, wise man, and he said in a strong voice: "The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord! I was&mdash;I am
a minister of the Gospel. Leave him to me."</p>
<p>"Oh, you be, be you?" said the man. "Then pray my son back to me! Pray back
a nine-thousand-dollar boat an' a thousand quintal of fish. If you'd left me
alone my widow could ha' gone on to the Provident an' worked fer her board, an'
never known&mdash;an' never known. Now I'll hev to tell her."</p>
<p>"There ain't nothin' to say," said Disko. "Better lie down a piece, Jason
Olley."</p>
<p>When a man has lost his only son, his summer's work, and his means of
livelihood, in thirty counted seconds, it is hard to give consolation.</p>
<p>"All Gloucester men, wasn't they?" said Tom Platt, fiddling helplessly with
a dory-becket.</p>
<p>"Oh, that don't make no odds," said Jason, wringing the wet from his beard.
"I'll be rowin' summer boarders araound East Gloucester this fall." He rolled
heavily to the rail, singing:</p>
<blockquote>"Happy birds that sing and fly<br>
Round thine altars, O Most High!"</blockquote>
<p>"Come with me. Come below!" said Penn, as though he had a right to give
orders. Their eyes met and fought for a quarter of a minute.</p>
<p>"I dunno who you be, but I'll come," said Jason submissively. "Mebbe I'll
get back some o' the&mdash;some o' the-nine thousand dollars." Penn led him
into the cabin and slid the door behind.</p>
<p>"That ain't Penn," cried Uncle Salters. "It's Jacob Boiler, an'&mdash;he's
remembered Johnstown! I never seed such eyes in any livin' man's head. What's
to do naow? What'll I do naow?"</p>
<p>They could hear Penn's voice and Jason's together. Then Penn's went on
alone, and Salters slipped off his hat, for Penn was praying. Presently the
little man came up the steps, huge drops of sweat on his face, and looked at
the crew. Dan was still sobbing by the wheel.</p>
<p>"He don't know us," Salters groaned. "It's all to do over again, checkers
and everything&mdash;an' what'll he say to me?"</p>
<p>Penn spoke; they could hear that it was to strangers. "I have prayed," said
he. "Our people believe in prayer. I have prayed for the life of this man's
son. Mine were drowned before my eyes&mdash;she and my eldest and&mdash;the
others. Shall a man be more wise than his Maker? I prayed never for their
lives, but I have prayed for this man's son, and he will surely be sent
him."</p>
<p>Salters looked pleadingly at Penn to see if he remembered.</p>
<p>"How long have I been mad?" Penn asked suddenly. His mouth was
twitching.</p>
<p>"Pshaw, Penn! You weren't never mad," Salters began "Only a little
distracted like."</p>
<p>"I saw the houses strike the bridge before the fires broke out. I do not
remember any more. How long ago is that?"</p>
<p>"I can't stand it! I can't stand it!" cried Dan, and Harvey whimpered in
sympathy.</p>
<p>"Abaout five year," said Disko, in a shaking voice.</p>
<p>"Then I have been a charge on some one for every day of that time. Who was
the man?"</p>
<p>Disko pointed to Salters.</p>
<p>"Ye hain't&mdash;ye hain't!" cried the sea-farmer, twisting his hands
together. "Ye've more'n earned your keep twice-told; an' there's money owin'
you, Penn, besides ha'af o' my quarter-share in the boat, which is yours fer
value received."</p>
<p>"You are good men. I can see that in your faces. But&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Mother av Mercy," whispered Long Jack, "an' he's been wid us all these
trips! He's clean bewitched."</p>
<p>A schooner's bell struck up alongside, and a voice hailed through the fog:
"O Disko! 'Heard abaout the Jennie Cushman?"</p>
<p>"They have found his son," cried Penn. "Stand you still and see the
salvation of the Lord!"</p>
<p>"Got Jason aboard here," Disko answered, but his voice quavered.
"There&mdash;warn't any one else?"</p>
<p>"We've fund one, though. 'Run acrost him snarled up in a mess o' lumber thet
might ha' bin a foc'sle. His head's cut some."</p>
<p>"Who is he?"</p>
<p>The <i>We're Here's</i> heart-beats answered one another.</p>
<p>"Guess it's young Olley," the voice drawled.</p>
<p>Penn raised his hands and said something in German. Harvey could have sworn
that a bright sun was shining upon his lifted face; but the drawl went on:
"Sa-ay! You fellers guyed us consid'rable t'other night."</p>
<p>"We don't feel like guyin' any now," said Disko.</p>
<p>"I know it; but to tell the honest truth we was kinder&mdash;kinder driftin'
when we run agin young Olley."</p>
<p>It was the irrepressible <i>Carrie Pitman</i>, and a roar of unsteady
laughter went up from the deck of the <i>We're Here</i>.</p>
<p>"Hedn't you 'baout's well send the old man aboard? We're runnin' in fer more
bait an' graound-tackle. Guess you won't want him, anyway, an' this blame
windlass work makes us short-handed. We'll take care of him. He married my
woman's aunt."</p>
<p>"I'll give you anything in the boat," said Troop.</p>
<p>"Don't want nothin', 'less, mebbe, an anchor that'll hold. Say! Young
Olley's gittin' kinder baulky an' excited. Send the old man along."</p>
<p>Penn waked him from his stupor of despair, and Tom Platt rowed him over. He
went away without a word of thanks, not knowing what was to come; and the fog
closed over all.</p>
<p>"And now," said Penn, drawing a deep breath as though about to preach. "And
now"&mdash;the erect body sank like a sword driven home into the scabbard; the
light faded from the overbright eyes; the voice returned to its usual pitiful
little titter&mdash;"and now," said Pennsylvania Pratt, "do you think it's too
early for a little game of checkers, Mr. Salters?"</p>
<p>"The very thing&mdash;the very thing I was goin' to say myself," cried
Salters promptly. "It beats all, Penn, how ye git on to what's in a man's
mind."</p>
<p>The little fellow blushed and meekly followed Salters forward.</p>
<p>"Up anchor! Hurry! Let's quit these crazy waters," shouted Disko, and never
was he more swiftly obeyed.</p>
<p>"Now what in creation d'ye suppose is the meanin' o' that all?" said Long
Jack, when they were working through the fog once more, damp, dripping, and
bewildered.</p>
<p>"The way I sense it," said Disko, at the wheel, "is this: The Jennie Cushman
business comin' on an empty stummick&mdash;"</p>
<p>"H-he saw one of them go by," sobbed Harvey.</p>
<p>"An' that, o' course, kinder hove him outer water, julluk runnin' a craft
ashore; hove him right aout, I take it, to rememberin' Johnstown an' Jacob
Boiler an' such-like reminiscences. Well, consolin' Jason there held him up a
piece, same's shorin' up a boat. Then, bein' weak, them props slipped an'
slipped, an' he slided down the ways, an' naow he's water-borne agin. That's
haow I sense it."</p>
<p>They decided that Disko was entirely correct.</p>
<p>"'Twould ha' bruk Salters all up," said Long Jack, "if Penn had stayed Jacob
Boilerin'. Did ye see his face when Penn asked who he'd been charged on all
these years? How is ut, Salters?"</p>
<p>"Asleep&mdash;dead asleep. Turned in like a child," Salters replied,
tiptoeing aft. "There won't be no grub till he wakes, natural. Did ye ever see
sech a gift in prayer? He everlastin'ly hiked young Olley outer the ocean.
Thet's my belief. Jason was tur'ble praoud of his boy, an' I mistrusted all
along 'twas a jedgment on worshippin' vain idols."</p>
<p>"There's others jes as sot," said Disko.</p>
<p>"That's difrunt," Salters retorted quickly. "Penn's not all caulked, an' I
ain't only but doin' my duty by him."</p>
<p>They waited, those hungry men, three hours, till Penn reappeared with a
smooth face and a blank mind. He said he believed that he had been dreaming.
Then he wanted to know why they were so silent, and they could not tell
him.<br>
<br></p>
<p>Disko worked all hands mercilessly for the next three or four days; and when
they could not go out, turned them into the hold to stack the ship's stores
into smaller compass, to make more room for the fish. The packed mass ran from
the cabin partition to the sliding door behind the foc'sle stove; and Disko
showed how there is great art in stowing cargo so as to bring a schooner to her
best draft. The crew were thus kept lively till they recovered their spirits;
and Harvey was tickled with a rope's end by Long Jack for being, as the Galway
man said, "sorrowful as a sick cat over fwhat couldn't be helped." He did a
great deal of thinking in those weary days, and told Dan what he thought, and
Dan agreed with him&mdash;even to the extent of asking for fried pies instead
of hooking them.</p>
<p>But a week later the two nearly upset the Hattie S. in a wild attempt to
stab a shark with an old bayonet tied to a stick. The grim brute rubbed
alongside the dory begging for small fish, and between the three of them it was
a mercy they all got off alive.</p>
<p>At last, after playing blindman's-buff in the fog, there came a morning when
Disko shouted down the foc'sle: "Hurry, boys! We're in taown!"</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>To the end of his days, Harvey will never forget that sight. The sun was
just clear of the horizon they had not seen for nearly a week, and his low red
light struck into the riding-sails of three fleets of anchored
schooners&mdash;one to the north, one to the westward, and one to the south.
There must have been nearly a hundred of them, of every possible make and
build, with, far away, a square-rigged Frenchman, all bowing and courtesying
one to the other. From every boat dories were dropping away like bees from a
crowded hive, and the clamour of voices, the rattling of ropes and blocks, and
the splash of the oars carried for miles across the heaving water. The sails
turned all colours, black, pearly-gray, and white, as the sun mounted; and more
boats swung up through the mists to the southward.</p>
<p>The dories gathered in clusters, separated, reformed, and broke again, all
heading one way; while men hailed and whistled and cat-called and sang, and the
water was speckled with rubbish thrown overboard.</p>
<p>"It's a town," said Harvey. "Disko was right. It IS a town!"</p>
<p>"I've seen smaller," said Disko. "There's about a thousand men here; an'
yonder's the Virgin." He pointed to a vacant space of greenish sea, where there
were no dories.</p>
<p>The <i>We're Here</i> skirted round the northern squadron, Disko waving his
hand to friend after friend, and anchored as nearly as a racing yacht at the
end of the season. The Bank fleet pass good seamanship in silence; but a
bungler is jeered all along the line.</p>
<p>"Jest in time fer the caplin," cried the Mary Chilton.</p>
<p>"'Salt 'most wet?" asked the King Philip.</p>
<p>"Hey, Tom Platt! Come t' supper to-night?" said the Henry Clay; and so
questions and answers flew back and forth. Men had met one another before,
dory-fishing in the fog, and there is no place for gossip like the Bank fleet.
They all seemed to know about Harvey's rescue, and asked if he were worth his
salt yet. The young bloods jested with Dan, who had a lively tongue of his own,
and inquired after their health by the town-nicknames they least liked.
Manuel's countrymen jabbered at him in their own language; and even the silent
cook was seen riding the jib-boom and shouting Gaelic to a friend as black as
himself. After they had buoyed the cable&mdash;all around the Virgin is rocky
bottom, and carelessness means chafed ground-tackle and danger from
drifting&mdash;after they had buoyed the cable, their dories went forth to join
the mob of boats anchored about a mile away. The schooners rocked and dipped at
a safe distance, like mother ducks watching their brood, while the dories
behaved like mannerless ducklings.</p>
<p>As they drove into the confusion, boat banging boat, Harvey's ears tingled
at the comments on his rowing. Every dialect from Labrador to Long Island, with
Portuguese, Neapolitan, Lingua Franca, French, and Gaelic, with songs and
shoutings and new oaths, rattled round him, and he seemed to be the butt of it
all. For the first time in his life he felt shy&mdash;perhaps that came from
living so long with only the <i>We're Heres</i>&mdash;among the scores of wild
faces that rose and fell with the reeling small craft. A gentle, breathing
swell, three furlongs from trough to barrel, would quietly shoulder up a string
of variously painted dories. They hung for an instant, a wonderful frieze
against the sky-line, and their men pointed and hailed. Next moment the open
mouths, waving arms, and bare chests disappeared, while on another swell came
up an entirely new line of characters like paper figures in a toy theatre. So
Harvey stared. "Watch out!" said Dan, flourishing a dip-net "When I tell you
dip, you dip. The caplin'll school any time from naow on. Where'll we lay, Tom
Platt?"</p>
<p>Pushing, shoving, and hauling, greeting old friends here and warning old
enemies there, Commodore Tom Platt led his little fleet well to leeward of the
general crowd, and immediately three or four men began to haul on their anchors
with intent to lee-bow the <i>We're Heres</i>. But a yell of laughter went up
as a dory shot from her station with exceeding speed, its occupant pulling
madly on the roding.</p>
<p>"Give her slack!" roared twenty voices. "Let him shake it out."</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" said Harvey, as the boat flashed away to the southward.
"He's anchored, isn't he?"</p>
<p>"Anchored, sure enough, but his graound-tackle's kinder shifty," said Dan,
laughing. "Whale's fouled it...Dip Harve! Here they come!"</p>
<p>The sea round them clouded and darkened, and then frizzed up in showers of
tiny silver fish, and over a space of five or six acres the cod began to leap
like trout in May; while behind the cod three or four broad gray-backs broke
the water into boils.</p>
<p>Then everybody shouted and tried to haul up his anchor to get among the
school, and fouled his neighbour's line and said what was in his heart, and
dipped furiously with his dip-net, and shrieked cautions and advice to his
companions, while the deep fizzed like freshly opened soda-water, and cod, men,
and whales together flung in upon the luckless bait. Harvey was nearly knocked
overboard by the handle of Dan's net. But in all the wild tumult he noticed,
and never forgot, the wicked, set little eye&mdash;something like a circus
elephant's eye&mdash;of a whale that drove along almost level with the water,
and, so he said, winked at him. Three boats found their rodings fouled by these
reckless mid-sea hunters, and were towed half a mile ere their horses shook the
line free.</p>
<p>Then the caplin moved off, and five minutes later there was no sound except
the splash of the sinkers overside, the flapping of the cod, and the whack of
the muckles as the men stunned them. It was wonderful fishing. Harvey could see
the glimmering cod below, swimming slowly in droves, biting as steadily as they
swam. Bank law strictly forbids more than one hook on one line when the dories
are on the Virgin or the Eastern Shoals; but so close lay the boats that even
single hooks snarled, and Harvey found himself in hot argument with a gentle,
hairy Newfoundlander on one side and a howling Portuguese on the other.</p>
<p>Worse than any tangle of fishing-lines was the confusion of the dory-rodings
below water. Each man had anchored where it seemed good to him, drifting and
rowing round his fixed point. As the fish struck on less quickly, each man
wanted to haul up and get to better ground; but every third man found himself
intimately connected with some four or five neighbours. To cut another's roding
is crime unspeakable on the Banks; yet it was done, and done without detection,
three or four times that day. Tom Platt caught a Maine man in the black act and
knocked him over the gunwale with an oar, and Manuel served a fellow-countryman
in the same way. But Harvey's anchor-line was cut, and so was Penn's, and they
were turned into relief-boats to carry fish to the <i>We're Here</i> as the
dories filled. The caplin schooled once more at twilight, when the mad clamour
was repeated; and at dusk they rowed back to dress down by the light of
kerosene-lamps on the edge of the pen.</p>
<p>It was a huge pile, and they went to sleep while they were dressing. Next
day several boats fished right above the cap of the Virgin; and Harvey, with
them, looked down on the very weed of that lonely rock, which rises to within
twenty feet of the surface. The cod were there in legions, marching solemnly
over the leathery kelp. When they bit, they bit all together; and so when they
stopped. There was a slack time at noon, and the dories began to search for
amusement. It was Dan who sighted the Hope Of Prague just coming up, and as her
boats joined the company they were greeted with the question: "Who's the
meanest man in the Fleet?"</p>
<p>Three hundred voices answered cheerily: "Nick Bra-ady." It sounded like an
organ chant.</p>
<p>"Who stole the lampwicks?" That was Dan's contribution.</p>
<p>"Nick Bra-ady," sang the boats.</p>
<p>"Who biled the salt bait fer soup?" This was an unknown backbiter a quarter
of a mile away.</p>
<p>Again the joyful chorus. Now, Brady was not especially mean, but he had that
reputation, and the Fleet made the most of it. Then they discovered a man from
a Truro boat who, six years before, had been convicted of using a tackle with
five or six hooks&mdash;a "scrowger," they call it&mdash;in the Shoals.
Naturally, he had been christened "Scrowger Jim"; and though he had hidden
himself on the Georges ever since, he found his honours waiting for him full
blown. They took it up in a sort of firecracker chorus: "Jim! O Jim! Jim! O
Jim! Sssscrowger Jim!" That pleased everybody. And when a poetical Beverly
man&mdash;he had been making it up all day, and talked about it for
weeks&mdash;sang, "The <i>Carrie Pitman's</i> anchor doesn't hold her for a
cent" the dories felt that they were indeed fortunate. Then they had to ask
that Beverly man how he was off for beans, because even poets must not have
things all their own way. Every schooner and nearly every man got it in turn.
Was there a careless or dirty cook anywhere? The dories sang about him and his
food. Was a schooner badly found? The Fleet was told at full length. Had a man
hooked tobacco from a mess-mate? He was named in meeting; the name tossed from
roller to roller. Disko's infallible judgments, Long Jack's market-boat that he
had sold years ago, Dan's sweetheart (oh, but Dan was an angry boy!), Penn's
bad luck with dory-anchors, Salter's views on manure, Manuel's little slips
from virtue ashore, and Harvey's ladylike handling of the oar&mdash;all were
laid before the public; and as the fog fell around them in silvery sheets
beneath the sun, the voices sounded like a bench of invisible judges
pronouncing sentence.</p>
<p>The dories roved and fished and squabbled till a swell underran the sea.
Then they drew more apart to save their sides, and some one called that if the
swell continued the Virgin would break. A reckless Galway man with his nephew
denied this, hauled up anchor, and rowed over the very rock itself. Many voices
called them to come away, while others dared them to hold on. As the
smooth-backed rollers passed to the southward, they hove the dory high and high
into the mist, and dropped her in ugly, sucking, dimpled water, where she spun
round her anchor, within a foot or two of the hidden rock. It was playing with
death for mere bravado; and the boats looked on in uneasy silence till Long
Jack rowed up behind his countrymen and quietly cut their roding.</p>
<p>"Can't ye hear ut knockin'?" he cried. "Pull for you miserable lives!
Pull!"</p>
<p>The men swore and tried to argue as the boat drifted; but the next swell
checked a little, like a man tripping on a carpet. There was a deep sob and a
gathering roar, and the Virgin flung up a couple of acres of foaming water,
white, furious, and ghastly over the shoal sea. Then all the boats greatly
applauded Long Jack, and the Galway men held their tongue.</p>
<p>"Ain't it elegant?" said Dan, bobbing like a young seal at home. "She'll
break about once every ha'af hour now, 'les the swell piles up good. What's her
reg'lar time when she's at work, Tom Platt?"</p>
<p>"Once ivry fifteen minutes, to the tick. Harve, you've seen the greatest
thing on the Banks; an' but for Long Jack you'd seen some dead men too."</p>
<p>There came a sound of merriment where the fog lay thicker and the schooners
were ringing their bells. A big bark nosed cautiously out of the mist, and was
received with shouts and cries of, "Come along, darlin'," from the Irishry.</p>
<p>"Another Frenchman?" said Harvey.</p>
<p>"Hain't you eyes? She's a Baltimore boat; goin' in fear an' tremblin'," said
Dan. "We'll guy the very sticks out of her. Guess it's the fust time her
skipper ever met up with the Fleet this way."</p>
<p>She was a black, buxom, eight-hundred-ton craft. Her mainsail was looped up,
and her topsail flapped undecidedly in what little wind was moving. Now a bark
is feminine beyond all other daughters of the sea, and this tall, hesitating
creature, with her white and gilt figurehead, looked just like a bewildered
woman half lifting her skirts to cross a muddy street under the jeers of bad
little boys. That was very much her situation. She knew she was somewhere in
the neighbourhood of the Virgin, had caught the roar of it, and was, therefore,
asking her way. This is a small part of what she heard from the dancing
dories:</p>
<p>"The Virgin? Fwhat are you talkin' of? 'This is Le Have on a Sunday mornin'.
Go home an' sober up."</p>
<p>"Go home, ye tarrapin! Go home an' tell 'em we're comin'."</p>
<p>Half a dozen voices together, in a most tuneful chorus, as her stern went
down with a roll and a bubble into the troughs: "Thay-aah-she-strikes!"</p>
<p>"Hard up! Hard up fer your life! You're on top of her now."</p>
<p>"Daown! Hard daown! Let go everything!"</p>
<p>"All hands to the pumps!"</p>
<p>"Daown jib an' pole her!"</p>
<p>Here the skipper lost his temper and said things. Instantly fishing was
suspended to answer him, and he heard many curious facts about his boat and her
next port of call. They asked him if he were insured; and whence he had stolen
his anchor, because, they said, it belonged to the <i>Carrie Pitman</i>; they
called his boat a mud-scow, and accused him of dumping garbage to frighten the
fish; they offered to tow him and charge it to his wife; and one audacious
youth slipped up almost under the counter, smacked it with his open palm, and
yelled: "Gid up, Buck!"</p>
<p>The cook emptied a pan of ashes on him, and he replied with cod-heads. The
bark's crew fired small coal from the galley, and the dories threatened to come
aboard and "razee" her. They would have warned her at once had she been in real
peril; but, seeing her well clear of the Virgin, they made the most of their
chances. The fun was spoilt when the rock spoke again, a half-mile to windward,
and the tormented bark set everything that would draw and went her ways; but
the dories felt that the honours lay with them.</p>
<p>All that night the Virgin roared hoarsely; and next morning, over an angry,
white-headed sea, Harvey saw the Fleet with flickering masts waiting for a
lead. Not a dory was hove out till ten o'clock, when the two Jeraulds of the
Day's Eye, imagining a lull which did not exist, set the example. In a minute
half the boats were out and bobbing in the cockly swells, but Troop kept the
<i>We're Heres</i> at work dressing down. He saw no sense in "dares"; and as
the storm grew that evening they had the pleasure of receiving wet strangers
only too glad to make any refuge in the gale. The boys stood by the
dory-tackles with lanterns, the men ready to haul, one eye cocked for the
sweeping wave that would make them drop everything and hold on for dear life.
Out of the dark would come a yell of "Dory, dory!" They would hook up and haul
in a drenched man and a half-sunk boat, till their decks were littered down
with nests of dories and the bunks were full. Five times in their watch did
Harvey, with Dan, jump at the foregaff where it lay lashed on the boom, and
cling with arms, legs, and teeth to rope and spar and sodden canvas as a big
wave filled the decks. One dory was smashed to pieces, and the sea pitched the
man head first on to the decks, cutting his forehead open; and about dawn, when
the racing seas glimmered white all along their cold edges, another man, blue
and ghastly, crawled in with a broken hand, asking news of his brother. Seven
extra mouths sat down to breakfast: A Swede; a Chatham skipper; a boy from
Hancock, Maine; one Duxbury, and three Provincetown men.</p>
<p>There was a general sorting out among the Fleet next day; and though no one
said anything, all ate with better appetites when boat after boat reported full
crews aboard. Only a couple of Portuguese and an old man from Gloucester were
drowned, but many were cut or bruised; and two schooners had parted their
tackle and been blown to the southward, three days' sail. A man died on a
Frenchman&mdash;it was the same bark that had traded tobacco with the <i>We're
Heres</i>. She slipped away quite quietly one wet, white morning, moved to a
patch of deep water, her sails all hanging anyhow, and Harvey saw the funeral
through Disko's spy-glass. It was only an oblong bundle slid overside. They did
not seem to have any form of service, but in the night, at anchor, Harvey heard
them across the star-powdered black water, singing something that sounded like
a hymn. It went to a very slow tune.</p>
<blockquote>"La brigantine<br>
Qui va tourner,<br>
Roule et s'incline<br>
Pour m'entrainer.<br>
Oh, Vierge Marie,<br>
Pour moi priez Dieu!<br>
Adieu, patrie;<br>
Quebec, adieu!"</blockquote>
<p>Tom Platt visited her, because, he said, the dead man was his brother as a
Freemason. It came out that a wave had doubled the poor fellow over the heel of
the bowsprit and broken his back. The news spread like a flash, for, contrary
to general custom, the Frenchman held an auction of the dead man's
kit,&mdash;he had no friends at St Malo or Miquelon,&mdash;and everything was
spread out on the top of the house, from his red knitted cap to the leather
belt with the sheath-knife at the back. Dan and Harvey were out on
twenty-fathom water in the Hattie S., and naturally rowed over to join the
crowd. It was a long pull, and they stayed some little time while Dan bought
the knife, which had a curious brass handle. When they dropped overside and
pushed off into a drizzle of rain and a lop of sea, it occurred to them that
they might get into trouble for neglecting the lines.</p>
<p>"Guess 'twon't hurt us any to be warmed up," said Dan, shivering under his
oilskins, and they rowed on into the heart of a white fog, which, as usual,
dropped on them without warning.</p>
<p>"There's too much blame tide hereabouts to trust to your instinks," he said.
"Heave over the anchor, Harve, and we'll fish a piece till the thing lifts.
Bend on your biggest lead. Three pound ain't any too much in this water. See
how she's tightened on her rodin' already."</p>
<p>There was quite a little bubble at the bows, where some irresponsible Bank
current held the dory full stretch on her rope; but they could not see a boat's
length in any direction. Harvey turned up his collar and bunched himself over
his reel with the air of a wearied navigator. Fog had no special terrors for
him now. They fished a while in silence, and found the cod struck on well. Then
Dan drew the sheath-knife and tested the edge of it on the gunwale.</p>
<p>"That's a daisy," said Harvey. "How did you get it so cheap?"</p>
<p>"On account o' their blame Cath'lic superstitions," said Dan, jabbing with
the bright blade. "They don't fancy takin' iron from off a dead man, so to
speak. 'See them Arichat Frenchmen step back when I bid?"</p>
<p>"But an auction ain't taking anythink off a dead man. It's business."</p>
<p>"We know it ain't, but there's no goin' in the teeth o' superstition. That's
one o' the advantages o' livin' in a progressive country." And Dan began
whistling:</p>
<blockquote>"Oh, Double Thatcher, how are you?<br>
Now Eastern Point comes inter view.<br>
The girls an' boys we soon shall see,<br>
At anchor off Cape Ann!"</blockquote>
<p>"Why didn't that Eastport man bid, then? He bought his boots. Ain't Maine
progressive?"</p>
<p>"Maine? Pshaw! They don't know enough, or they hain't got money enough, to
paint their haouses in Maine. I've seen 'em. The Eastport man he told me that
the knife had been used&mdash;so the French captain told him&mdash;used up on
the French coast last year."</p>
<p>"Cut a man? Heave 's the muckle." Harvey hauled in his fish, rebaited, and
threw over.</p>
<p>"Killed him! Course, when I heard that I was keener'n ever to get it."</p>
<p>"Christmas! I didn't know it," said Harvey, turning round. "I'll give you a
dollar for it when I&mdash;get my wages. Say, I'll give you two dollars."</p>
<p>"Honest? D'you like it as much as all that?" said Dan, flushing. "Well, to
tell the truth, I kinder got it for you&mdash;to give; but I didn't let on till
I saw how you'd take it. It's yours and welcome, Harve, because we're
dory-mates, and so on and so forth, an' so followin'. Catch a-holt!"</p>
<p>He held it out, belt and all.</p>
<p>"But look at here. Dan, I don't see&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Take it. 'Tain't no use to me. I wish you to hev it." The temptation was
irresistible. "Dan, you're a white man," said Harvey. "I'll keep it as long as
I live."</p>
<p>"That's good hearin'," said Dan, with a pleasant laugh; and then, anxious to
change the subject: "'Look's if your line was fast to somethin'."</p>
<p>"Fouled, I guess," said Harve, tugging. Before he pulled up he fastened the
belt round him, and with deep delight heard the tip of the sheath click on the
thwart. "Concern the thing!" he cried. "She acts as though she were on
strawberry-bottom. It's all sand here, ain't it?"</p>
<p>Dan reached over and gave a judgmatic tweak. "Hollbut'll act that way 'f
he's sulky. Thet's no strawberry-bottom. Yank her once or twice. She gives,
sure. Guess we'd better haul up an' make certain."</p>
<p>They pulled together, making fast at each turn on the cleats, and the hidden
weight rose sluggishly.</p>
<p>"Prize, oh! Haul!" shouted Dan, but the shout ended in a shrill, double
shriek of horror, for out of the sea came the body of the dead Frenchman buried
two days before! The hook had caught him under the right armpit, and he swayed,
erect and horrible, head and shoulders above water. His arms were tied to his
side, and&mdash;he had no face. The boys fell over each other in a heap at the
bottom of the dory, and there they lay while the thing bobbed alongside, held
on the shortened line.</p>
<p>"The tide&mdash;the tide brought him!" said Harvey with quivering lips, as
he fumbled at the clasp of the belt.</p>
<p>"Oh, Lord! Oh, Harve!" groaned Dan, "be quick. He's come for it. Let him
have it. Take it off."</p>
<p>"I don't want it! I don't want it!" cried Harvey. "I can't find the
bu-buckle."</p>
<p>"Quick, Harve! He's on your line!"</p>
<p>Harvey sat up to unfasten the belt, facing the head that had no face under
its streaming hair. "He's fast still," he whispered to Dan, who slipped out his
knife and cut the line, as Harvey flung the belt far overside. The body shot
down with a plop, and Dan cautiously rose to his knees, whiter than the
fog.</p>
<p>"He come for it. He come for it. I've seen a stale one hauled up on a trawl
and I didn't much care, but he come to us special."</p>
<p>"I wish&mdash;I wish I hadn't taken the knife. Then he'd have come on your
line."</p>
<p>"Dunno as thet would ha' made any differ. We're both scared out o' ten
years' growth. Oh, Harve, did ye see his head?"</p>
<p>"Did I? I'll never forget it. But look at here, Dan; it couldn't have been
meant. It was only the tide."</p>
<p>"Tide! He come for it, Harve. Why, they sunk him six miles to south'ard o'
the Fleet, an' we're two miles from where she's lyin' now. They told me he was
weighted with a fathom an' a half o' chain-cable."</p>
<p>"Wonder what he did with the knife&mdash;up on the French coast?"</p>
<p>"Something bad. Guess he's bound to take it with him to the Judgment, an'
so&mdash;What are you doin' with the fish?"</p>
<p>"Heaving 'em overboard," said Harvey.</p>
<p>"What for? We sha'n't eat 'em."</p>
<p>"I don't care. I had to look at his face while I was takin' the belt off.
You can keep your catch if you like. I've no use for mine."</p>
<p>Dan said nothing, but threw his fish over again.</p>
<p>"Guess it's best to be on the safe side," he murmured at last. "I'd give a
month's pay if this fog 'u'd lift. Things go abaout in a fog that ye don't see
in clear weather&mdash;yo-hoes an' hollerers and such like. I'm sorter relieved
he come the way he did instid o' walkin'. He might ha' walked."</p>
<p>"Don't, Dan! We're right on top of him now. 'Wish I was safe aboard, hem'
pounded by Uncle Salters."</p>
<p>"They'll be lookin' fer us in a little. Gimme the tooter." Dan took the tin
dinner-horn, but paused before he blew.</p>
<p>"Go on," said Harvey. "I don't want to stay here all night"</p>
<p>"Question is, haow he'd take it. There was a man frum down the coast told me
once he was in a schooner where they darsen't ever blow a horn to the dories,
becaze the skipper&mdash;not the man he was with, but a captain that had run
her five years before&mdash;he'd drowned a boy alongside in a drunk fit; an'
ever after, that boy he'd row along-side too and shout, 'Dory! dory!' with the
rest."</p>
<p>"Dory! dory!" a muffled voice cried through the fog. They cowered again, and
the horn dropped from Dan's hand.</p>
<p>"Hold on!" cried Harvey; "it's the cook."</p>
<p>"Dunno what made me think o' thet fool tale, either," said Dan. "It's the
doctor, sure enough."</p>
<p>"Dan! Danny! Oooh, Dan! Harve! Harvey! Oooh, Haarveee!"</p>
<p>"We're here," sung both boys together. They heard oars, but could see
nothing till the cook, shining and dripping, rowed into them.</p>
<p>"What iss happened?" said he. "You will be beaten at home."</p>
<p>"Thet's what we want. Thet's what we're sufferin' for" said Dan. "Anything
homey's good enough fer us. We've had kinder depressin' company." As the cook
passed them a line, Dan told him the tale.</p>
<p>"Yess! He come for hiss knife," was all he said at the end.</p>
<p>Never had the little rocking <i>We're Here</i> looked so deliciously
home-like as when the cook, born and bred in fogs, rowed them back to her.
There was a warm glow of light from the cabin and a satisfying smell of food
forward, and it was heavenly to hear Disko and the others, all quite alive and
solid, leaning over the rail and promising them a first-class pounding. But the
cook was a black; master of strategy. He did not get the dories aboard till he
had given the more striking points of the tale, explaining as he backed and
bumped round the counter how Harvey was the mascot to destroy any possible bad
luck. So the boys came override as rather uncanny heroes, and every one asked
them questions instead of pounding them for making trouble. Little Penn
delivered quite a speech on the folly of superstitions; but public opinion was
against him and in favour of Long Jack, who told the most excruciating
ghost-stories, till nearly midnight. Under that influence no one except Salters
and Penn said anything about "idolatry," when the cook put a lighted candle, a
cake of flour and water, and a pinch of salt on a shingle, and floated them out
astern to keep the Frenchman quiet in case he was still restless. Dan lit the
candle because he had bought the belt, and the cook grunted and muttered charms
as long as he could see the ducking point of flame.</p>
<p>Said Harvey to Dan, as they turned in after watch:</p>
<p>"How about progress and Catholic superstitions?"</p>
<p>"Huh! I guess I'm as enlightened and progressive as the next man, but when
it comes to a dead St. Malo deck-hand scarin' a couple o' pore boys stiff fer
the sake of a thirty-cent knife, why, then, the cook can take hold fer all o'
me. I mistrust furriners, livin' or dead."</p>
<p>Next morning all, except the cook, were rather ashamed of the ceremonies,
and went to work double tides, speaking gruffly to one another.</p>
<p>The <i>We're Here</i> was racing neck and neck for her last few loads
against the Parry Norman; and so close was the struggle that the Fleet took
side and betted tobacco. All hands worked at the lines or dressing-down till
they fell asleep where they stood&mdash;beginning before dawn and ending when
it was too dark to see. They even used the cook as pitcher, and turned Harvey
into the hold to pass salt, while Dan helped to dress down. Luckily a Parry
Norman man sprained his ankle falling down the foc'sle, and the <i>We're
Heres</i> gained. Harvey could not see how one more fish could be crammed into
her, but Disko and Tom Platt stowed and stowed, and planked the mass down with
big stones from the ballast, and there was always "jest another day's work."
Disko did not tell them when all the salt was wetted. He rolled to the
lazarette aft the cabin and began hauling out the big mainsail. This was at ten
in the morning. The riding-sail was down and the main- and top-sail were up by
noon, and dories came alongside with letters for home, envying their good
fortune. At last she cleared decks, hoisted her flag,&mdash;as is the right of
the first boat off the Banks,&mdash;up-anchored, and began to move. Disko
pretended that he wished to accomodate folk who had not sent in their mail, and
so worked her gracefully in and out among the schooners. In reality, that was
his little triumphant procession, and for the fifth year running it showed what
kind of mariner he was. Dan's accordion and Tom Platt's fiddle supplied the
music of the magic verse you must not sing till all the salt is wet:</p>
<blockquote>"Hih! Yih! Yoho! Send your letters raound!<br>
All our salt is wetted, an' the anchor's off the graound!<br>
Bend, oh, bend your mains'l, we're back to Yankeeland&mdash;<br>
With fifteen hunder' quintal,<br>
An' fifteen hunder' quintal,<br>
'Teen hunder' toppin' quintal,<br>
'Twix' old 'Queereau an' Grand."</blockquote>
<p>The last letters pitched on deck wrapped round pieces of coal, and the
Gloucester men shouted messages to their wives and womenfolks and owners, while
the <i>We're Here</i> finished the musical ride through the Fleet, her
headsails quivering like a man's hand when he raises it to say good-by.</p>
<p>Harvey very soon discovered that the <i>We're Here</i>, with her
riding-sail, strolling from berth to berth, and the <i>We're Here</i> headed
west by south under home canvas, were two very different boats. There was a
bite and kick to the wheel even in "boy's" weather; he could feel the dead
weight in the hold flung forward mightily across the surges, and the streaming
line of bubbles overside made his eyes dizzy.</p>
<p>Disko kept them busy fiddling with the sails; and when those were flattened
like a racing yacht's, Dan had to wait on the big topsail, which was put over
by hand every time she went about. In spare moments they pumped, for the packed
fish dripped brine, which does not improve a cargo. But since there was no
fishing, Harvey had time to look at the sea from another point of view. The
low-sided schooner was naturally on most intimate terms with her surroundings.
They saw little of the horizon save when she topped a swell; and usually she
was elbowing, fidgeting, and coasting her steadfast way through gray,
gray-blue, or black hollows laced across and across with streaks of shivering
foam; or rubbing herself caressingly along the flank of some bigger water-hill.
It was as if she said: "You wouldn't hurt me, surely? I'm only the little
<i>We're Here</i>." Then she would slide away chuckling softly to herself till
she was brought up by some fresh obstacle. The dullest of folk cannot see this
kind of thing hour after hour through long days without noticing it; and
Harvey, being anything but dull, began to comprehend and enjoy the dry chorus
of wave-tops turning over with a sound of incessant tearing; the hurry of the
winds working across open spaces and herding the purple-blue cloud-shadows; the
splendid upheaval of the red sunrise; the folding and packing away of the
morning mists, wall after wall withdrawn across the white floors; the salty
glare and blaze of noon; the kiss of rain falling over thousands of dead, flat
square miles; the chilly blackening of everything at the day's end; and the
million wrinkles of the sea under the moonlight, when the jib-boom solemnly
poked at the low stars, and Harvey went down to get a doughnut from the
cook.</p>
<p>But the best fun was when the boys were put on the wheel together, Tom Platt
within hail, and she cuddled her lee-rail down to the crashing blue, and kept a
little home-made rainbow arching unbroken over her windlass. Then the jaws of
the booms whined against the masts, and the sheets creaked, and the sails
filled with roaring; and when she slid into a hollow she trampled like a woman
tripped in her own silk dress, and came out, her jib wet half-way up, yearning
and peering for the tall twin-lights of Thatcher's Island.</p>
<p>They left the cold gray of the Bank sea, saw the lumber-ships making for
Quebec by the Straits of St. Lawrence, with the Jersey salt-brigs from Spain
and Sicily; found a friendly northeaster off Artimon Bank that drove them
within view of the East light of Sable Island,&mdash;a sight Disko did not
linger over,&mdash;and stayed with them past Western and Le Have, to the
northern fringe of George's. From there they picked up the deeper water, and
let her go merrily.</p>
<p>"Hattie's pulling on the string," Dan confided to Harvey. "Hattie an' Ma.
Next Sunday you'll be hirin' a boy to throw water on the windows to make ye go
to sleep. 'Guess you'll keep with us till your folks come. Do you know the best
of gettin' ashore again?"</p>
<p>"Hot bath?" said Harvey. His eyebrows were all white with dried spray.</p>
<p>"That's good, but a night-shirt's better. I've been dreamin' o' night-shirts
ever since we bent our mainsail. Ye can wiggle your toes then. Ma'll hev a new
one fer me, all washed soft. It's home, Harve. It's home! Ye can sense it in
the air. We're runnin' into the aidge of a hot wave naow, an' I can smell the
bayberries. Wonder if we'll get in fer supper. Port a trifle."</p>
<p>The hesitating sails flapped and lurched in the close air as the deep
smoothed out, blue and oily, round them. When they whistled for a wind only the
rain came in spiky rods, bubbling and drumming, and behind the rain the thunder
and the lightning of mid-August. They lay on the deck with bare feet and arms,
telling one another what they would order at their first meal ashore; for now
the land was in plain sight. A Gloucester swordfish-boat drifted alongside, a
man in the little pulpit on the bowsprit flourished his harpoon, his bare head
plastered down with the wet. "And all's well!" he sang cheerily, as though he
were watch on a big liner. "Wouverman's waiting fer you, Disko. What's the news
o' the Fleet?"</p>
<p>Disko shouted it and passed on, while the wild summer storm pounded overhead
and the lightning flickered along the capes from four different quarters at
once. It gave the low circle of hills round Gloucester Harbor, Ten Pound
Island, the fish-sheds, with the broken line of house-roofs, and each spar and
buoy on the water, in blinding photographs that came and went a dozen times to
the minute as the <i>We're Here</i> crawled in on half-flood, and the
whistling-buoy moaned and mourned behind her. Then the storm died out in long,
separated, vicious dags of blue-white flame, followed by a single roar like the
roar of a mortar-battery, and the shaken air tingled under the stars as it got
back to silence.</p>
<p>"The flag, the flag!" said Disko, suddenly, pointing upward.</p>
<p>"What is ut?" said Long Jack.</p>
<p>"Otto! Ha'af mast. They can see us frum shore now."</p>
<p>"I'd clean forgot. He's no folk to Gloucester, has he?"</p>
<p>"Girl he was goin' to be married to this fall."</p>
<p>"Mary pity her!" said Long Jack, and lowered the little flag half-mast for
the sake of Otto, swept overboard in a gale off Le Have three months
before.</p>
<p>Disko wiped the wet from his eyes and led the <i>We're Here</i> to
Wouverman's wharf, giving his orders in whispers, while she swung round moored
tugs and night-watchmen hailed her from the ends of inky-black piers. Over and
above the darkness and the mystery of the procession, Harvey could feel the
land close round him once more, with all its thousands of people asleep, and
the smell of earth after rain, and the familiar noise of a switching-engine
coughing to herself in a freight-yard; and all those things made his heart beat
and his throat dry up as he stood by the foresheet. They heard the anchor-watch
snoring on a lighthouse-tug, nosed into a pocket of darkness where a lantern
glimmered on either side; somebody waked with a grunt, threw them a rope, and
they made fast to a silent wharf flanked with great iron-roofed sheds fall of
warm emptiness, and lay there without a sound.</p>
<p>Then Harvey sat down by the wheel, and sobbed and sobbed as though his heart
would break, and a tall woman who had been sitting on a weigh-scale dropped
down into the schooner and kissed Dan once on the cheek; for she was his
mother, and she had seen the <i>We're Here</i> by the lightning flashes. She
took no notice of Harvey till he had recovered himself a little and Disko had
told her his story. Then they went to Disko's house together as the dawn was
breaking; and until the telegraph office was open and he could wire his folk,
Harvey Cheyne was perhaps the loneliest boy in all America. But the curious
thing was that Disko and Dan seemed to think none the worse of him for
crying.</p>
<p>Wouverman was not ready for Disko's prices till Disko, sure that the
<i>We're Here</i> was at least a week ahead of any other Gloucester boat, had
given him a few days to swallow them; so all hands played about the streets,
and Long Jack stopped the Rocky Neck trolley, on principle, as he said, till
the conductor let him ride free. But Dan went about with his freckled nose in
the air, bung-full of mystery and most haughty to his family.</p>
<p>"Dan, I'll hev to lay inter you ef you act this way," said Troop, pensively.
"Sence we've come ashore this time you've bin a heap too fresh."</p>
<p>"I'd lay into him naow ef he was mine," said Uncle Salters, sourly. He and
Penn boarded with the Troops.</p>
<p>"Oho!" said Dan, shuffling with the accordion round the backyard, ready to
leap the fence if the enemy advanced. "Dad, you're welcome to your own
judgment, but remember I've warned ye. Your own flesh an' blood ha' warned ye!
'Tain't any o' my fault ef you're mistook, but I'll be on deck to watch ye. An'
ez fer yeou, Uncle Salters, Pharaoh's chief butler ain't in it 'longside o'
you! You watch aout an' wait. You'll be plowed under like your own blamed
clover; but me&mdash;Dan Troop&mdash;I'll flourish like a green bay-tree
because I warn't stuck on my own opinion."</p>
<p>Disko was smoking in all his shore dignity and a pair of beautiful
carpet-slippers. "You're gettin' ez crazy as poor Harve. You two go araound
gigglin' an' squinchin' an' kickin' each other under the table till there's no
peace in the haouse," said he.</p>
<p>"There's goin' to be a heap less&mdash;fer some folks," Dan replied. "You
wait an' see."</p>
<p>He and Harvey went out on the trolley to East Gloucester, where they tramped
through the bayberry bushes to the lighthouse, and lay down on the big red
boulders and laughed themselves hungry. Harvey had shown Dan a telegram, and
the two swore to keep silence till the shell burst.</p>
<p>"Harve's folk?" said Dan, with an unruffled face after supper. "Well, I
guess they don't amount to much of anything, or we'd ha' heard from 'em by
naow. His pop keeps a kind o' store out West. Maybe he'll give you 's much as
five dollars, Dad."</p>
<p>"What did I tell ye?" said Salters. "Don't sputter over your vittles,
Dan."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>Whatever his private sorrows may be, a multimillionaire, like any other
workingman, should keep abreast of his business. Harvey Cheyne, senior, had
gone East late in June to meet a woman broken down, half mad, who dreamed day
and night of her son drowning in the gray seas. He had surrounded her with
doctors, trained nurses, massage-women, and even faith-cure companions, but
they were useless. Mrs. Cheyne lay still and moaned, or talked of her boy by
the hour together to any one who would listen. Hope she had none, and who could
offer it? All she needed was assurance that drowning did not hurt; and her
husband watched to guard lest she should make the experiment. Of his own sorrow
he spoke little&mdash;hardly realized the depth of it till he caught himself
asking the calendar on his writing-desk, "What's the use of going on?"</p>
<p>There had always lain a pleasant notion at the back of his head that, some
day, when he had rounded off everything and the boy had left college, he would
take his son to his heart and lead him into his possessions. Then that boy, he
argued, as busy fathers do, would instantly become his companion, partner, and
ally, and there would follow splendid years of great works carried out
together&mdash;the old head backing the young fire. Now his boy was
dead&mdash;lost at sea, as it might have been a Swede sailor from one of
Cheyne's big teaships; the wife dying, or worse; he himself was trodden down by
platoons of women and doctors and maids and attendants; worried almost beyond
endurance by the shift and change of her poor restless whims; hopeless, with no
heart to meet his many enemies.</p>
<p>He had taken the wife to his raw new palace in San Diego, where she and her
people occupied a wing of great price, and Cheyne, in a veranda-room, between a
secretary and a typewriter, who was also a telegraphist, toiled along wearily
from day to day. There was a war of rates among four Western railroads in which
he was supposed to be interested; a devastating strike had developed in his
lumber camps in Oregon, and the legislature of the State of California, which
has no love for its makers, was preparing open war against him.</p>
<p>Ordinarily he would have accepted battle ere it was offered, and have waged
a pleasant and unscrupulous campaign. But now he sat limply, his soft black hat
pushed forward on to his nose, his big body shrunk inside his loose clothes,
staring at his boots or the Chinese junks in the bay, and assenting absently to
the secretary's questions as he opened the Saturday mail.</p>
<p>Cheyne was wondering how much it would cost to drop everything and pull out.
He carried huge insurances, could buy himself royal annuities, and between one
of his places in Colorado and a little society (that would do the wife good),
say in Washington and the South Carolina islands, a man might forget plans that
had come to nothing. On the other hand&mdash;</p>
<p>The click of the typewriter stopped; the girl was looking at the secretary,
who had turned white.</p>
<p>He passed Cheyne a telegram repeated from San Francisco:</p>
<p>Picked up by fishing schooner <i>We're Here</i> having fallen off boat great
times on Banks fishing all well waiting Gloucester Mass care Disko Troop for
money or orders wire what shall do and how is Mama Harvey N. Cheyne.</p>
<p>The father let it fall, laid his head down on the roller-top of the shut
desk, and breathed heavily. The secretary ran for Mrs. Cheyne's doctor who
found Cheyne pacing to and fro.</p>
<p>"What&mdash;what d' you think of it? Is it possible? Is there any meaning to
it? I can't quite make it out," he cried.</p>
<p>"I can," said the doctor. "I lose seven thousand a year&mdash;that's all."
He thought of the struggling New York practice he had dropped at Cheyne's
imperious bidding, and returned the telegram with a sigh.</p>
<p>"You mean you'd tell her? 'May be a fraud?"</p>
<p>"What's the motive?" said the doctor, coolly. "Detection's too certain. It's
the boy sure enough."</p>
<p>Enter a French maid, impudently, as an indispensable one who is kept on only
by large wages.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Cheyne she say you must come at once. She think you are seek."</p>
<p>The master of thirty millions bowed his head meekly and followed Suzanne;
and a thin, high voice on the upper landing of the great white-wood square
staircase cried: "What is it? What has happened?"</p>
<p>No doors could keep out the shriek that rang through the echoing house a
moment later, when her husband blurted out the news.</p>
<p>"And that's all right," said the doctor, serenely, to the typewriter. "About
the only medical statement in novels with any truth to it is that joy don't
kill, Miss Kinzey."</p>
<p>"I know it; but we've a heap to do first." Miss Kinzey was from Milwaukee,
somewhat direct of speech; and as her fancy leaned towards the secretary, she
divined there was work in hand. He was looking earnestly at the vast roller-map
of America on the wall.</p>
<p>"Milsom, we're going right across. Private car&mdash;straight
through&mdash;Boston. Fix the connections," shouted Cheyne down the
staircase.</p>
<p>"I thought so."</p>
<p>The secretary turned to the typewriter, and their eyes met (out of that was
born a story&mdash;nothing to do with this story). She looked inquiringly,
doubtful of his resources. He signed to her to move to the Morse as a general
brings brigades into action. Then he swept his hand musician-wise through his
hair, regarded the ceiling, and set to work, while Miss Kinzey's white fingers
called up the Continent of America.</p>
<p>"<i>K. H. Wade, Los Angeles</i>&mdash;The 'Constance' is at Los Angeles,
isn't she, Miss Kinzey?"</p>
<p>"Yep." Miss Kinzey nodded between clicks as the secretary looked at his
watch.</p>
<p>"Ready? <i>Send 'Constance,' private car, here, and arrange for special to
leave here Sunday in time to connect with New York Limited at Sixteenth Street,
Chicago, Tuesday next</i>."</p>
<p>Click-click-click! "Couldn't you better that?"</p>
<p>"Not on those grades. That gives 'em sixty hours from here to Chicago. They
won't gain anything by taking a special east of that. Ready? <i>Also arrange
with Lake Shore and Michigan Southern to take 'Constance' on New York Central
and Hudson River Buffalo to Albany, and B. and A. the same Albany to Boston.
Indispensable I should reach Boston Wednesday evening. Be sure nothing
prevents. Have also wired Canniff, Toucey, and Barnes.</i>&mdash;Sign,
Cheyne."</p>
<p>Miss Kinzey nodded, and the secretary went on.</p>
<p>"Now then. Canniff, Toucey, and Barnes, of course. Ready? <i>Canniff,
Chicago. Please take my private car 'Constance' from Santa Fe at Sixteenth
Street next Tuesday p. m. on N. Y. Limited through to Buffalo and deliver N. Y.
C. for Albany.</i>&mdash;Ever bin to N' York, Miss Kinzey? We'll go some
day.&mdash;Ready? <i>Take car Buffalo to Albany on Limited Tuesday p. m.</i>
That's for Toucey."</p>
<p>"Haven't bin to Noo York, but I know that!" with a toss of the head.</p>
<p>"Beg pardon. Now, Boston and Albany, Barnes, same instructions from Albany
through to Boston. Leave three-five P. M. (you needn't wire that); arrive
nine-five P. M. Wednesday. That covers everything Wade will do, but it pays to
shake up the managers."</p>
<p>"It's great," said Miss Kinzey, with a look of admiration. This was the kind
of man she understood and appreciated.</p>
<p>"'Tisn't bad," said Milsom, modestly. "Now, any one but me would have lost
thirty hours and spent a week working out the run, instead of handing him over
to the Santa Fe straight through to Chicago."</p>
<p>"But see here, about that Noo York Limited. Chauncey Depew himself couldn't
hitch his car to her," Miss Kinzey suggested, recovering herself.</p>
<p>"Yes, but this isn't Chauncey. It's Cheyne&mdash;lightning. It goes."</p>
<p>"Even so. Guess we'd better wire the boy. You've forgotten that,
anyhow."</p>
<p>"I'll ask."</p>
<p>When he returned with the father's message bidding Harvey meet them in
Boston at an appointed hour, he found Miss Kinzey laughing over the keys. Then
Milsom laughed too, for the frantic clicks from Los Angeles ran: "We want to
know why-why-why? General uneasiness developed and spreading."</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Chicago appealed to Miss Kinzey in these words: "If crime
of century is maturing please warn friends in time. We are all getting to cover
here."</p>
<p>This was capped by a message from Topeka (and wherein Topeka was concerned
even Milsom could not guess): "Don't shoot, Colonel. We'll come down."</p>
<p>Cheyne smiled grimly at the consternation of his enemies when the telegrams
were laid before him. "They think we're on the warpath. Tell 'em we don't feel
like fighting just now, Milsom. Tell 'em what we're going for. I guess you and
Miss Kinsey had better come along, though it isn't likely I shall do any
business on the road. Tell 'em the truth&mdash;for once."</p>
<p>So the truth was told. Miss Kinzey clicked in the sentiment while the
secretary added the memorable quotation, "Let us have peace," and in board
rooms two thousand miles away the representatives of sixty-three million
dollars' worth of variously manipulated railroad interests breathed more
freely. Cheyne was flying to meet the only son, so miraculously restored to
him. The bear was seeking his cub, not the bulls. Hard men who had their knives
drawn to fight for their financial lives put away the weapons and wished him
God-speed, while half a dozen panic-smitten tin-pot toads perked up their heads
and spoke of the wonderful things they would have done had not Cheyne buried
the hatchet.</p>
<p>It was a busy week-end among the wires; for now that their anxiety was
removed, men and cities hastened to accommodate. Los Angeles called to San
Diego and Barstow that the Southern California engineers might know and be
ready in their lonely roundhouses; Barstow passed the word to the Atlantic and
Pacific; and Albuquerque flung it the whole length of the Atchinson, Topeka,
and Santa Fe management, even into Chicago. An engine, combination-car with
crew, and the great and gilded "Constance" private car were to be "expedited"
over those two thousand three hundred and fifty miles. The train would take
precedence of one hundred and seventy-seven others meeting and passing;
despatchers and crews of every one of those said trains must be notified.
Sixteen locomotives, sixteen engineers, and sixteen firemen would be
needed&mdash;each and every one the best available. Two and one half minutes
would be allowed for changing engines, three for watering, and two for coaling.
"Warn the men, and arrange tanks and chutes accordingly; for Harvey Cheyne is
in a hurry, a hurry, a hurry," sang the wires. "Forty miles an hour will be
expected, and division superintendents will accompany this special over their
respective divisions. From San Diego to Sixteenth Street, Chicago, let the
magic carpet be laid down. Hurry! Oh, hurry!"</p>
<p>"It will be hot," said Cheyne, as they rolled out of San Diego in the dawn
of Sunday. "We're going to hurry, Mama, just as fast as ever we can; but I
really don't think there's any good of your putting on your bonnet and gloves
yet. You'd much better lie down and take your medicine. I'd play you a game of
dominoes, but it's Sunday."</p>
<p>"I'll be good. Oh, I will be good. Only&mdash;taking off my bonnet makes me
feel as if we'd never get there."</p>
<p>"Try to sleep a little, Mama, and we'll be in Chicago before you know."</p>
<p>"But it's Boston, Father. Tell them to hurry."</p>
<p>The six-foot drivers were hammering their way to San Bernardino and the
Mohave wastes, but this was no grade for speed. That would come later. The heat
of the desert followed the heat of the hills as they turned east to the Needles
and the Colorado River. The car cracked in the utter drouth and glare, and they
put crushed ice to Mrs. Cheyne's neck, and toiled up the long, long grades,
past Ash Fork, towards Flagstaff, where the forests and quarries are, under the
dry, remote skies. The needle of the speed-indicator flicked and wagged to and
fro; the cinders rattled on the roof, and a whirl of dust sucked after the
whirling wheels. The crew of the combination sat on their bunks, panting in
their shirtsleeves, and Cheyne found himself among them shouting old, old
stories of the railroad that every trainman knows, above the roar of the car.
He told them about his son, and how the sea had given up its dead, and they
nodded and spat and rejoiced with him; asked after "her, back there," and
whether she could stand it if the engineer "let her out a piece," and Cheyne
thought she could. Accordingly, the great fire-horse was "let 'ut" from
Flagstaff to Winslow, till a division superintendent protested.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Cheyne, in the boudoir stateroom, where the French maid,
sallow-white with fear, clung to the silver door-handle, only moaned a little
and begged her husband to bid them "hurry." And so they dropped the dry sands
and moon-struck rocks of Arizona behind them, and grilled on till the crash of
the couplings and the wheeze of the brake-hose told them they were at Coolidge
by the Continental Divide.</p>
<p>Three bold and experienced men&mdash;cool, confident, and dry when they
began; white, quivering, and wet when they finished their trick at those
terrible wheels&mdash;swung her over the great lift from Albuquerque to
Glorietta and beyond Springer, up and up to the Raton Tunnel on the State line,
whence they dropped rocking into La Junta, had sight of the Arkansaw, and tore
down the long slope to Dodge City, where Cheyne took comfort once again from
setting his watch an hour ahead.</p>
<p>There was very little talk in the car. The secretary and typewriter sat
together on the stamped Spanish-leather cushions by the plate-glass
observation-window at the rear end, watching the surge and ripple of the ties
crowded back behind them, and, it is believed, making notes of the scenery.
Cheyne moved nervously between his own extravagant gorgeousness and the naked
necessity of the combination, an unlit cigar in his teeth, till the pitying
crews forgot that he was their tribal enemy, and did their best to entertain
him.</p>
<p>At night the bunched electrics lit up that distressful palace of all the
luxuries, and they fared sumptuously, swinging on through the emptiness of
abject desolation.</p>
<p>Now they heard the swish of a water-tank, and the guttural voice of a
Chinaman, the click-clink of hammers that tested the Krupp steel wheels, and
the oath of a tramp chased off the rear-platform; now the solid crash of coal
shot into the tender; and now a beating back of noises as they flew past a
waiting train. Now they looked out into great abysses, a trestle purring
beneath their tread, or up to rocks that barred out half the stars. Now scour
and ravine changed and rolled back to jagged mountains on the horizon's edge,
and now broke into hills lower and lower, till at last came the true
plains.</p>
<p>At Dodge City an unknown hand threw in a copy of a Kansas paper containing
some sort of an interview with Harvey, who had evidently fallen in with an
enterprising reporter, telegraphed on from Boston. The joyful journalese
revealed that it was beyond question their boy, and it soothed Mrs. Cheyne for
a while. Her one word "hurry" was conveyed by the crews to the engineers at
Nickerson, Topeka, and Marceline, where the grades are easy, and they brushed
the Continent behind them. Towns and villages were close together now, and a
man could feel here that he moved among people.</p>
<p>"I can't see the dial, and my eyes ache so. What are we doing?"</p>
<p>"The very best we can, Mama. There's no sense in getting in before the
Limited. We'd only have to wait."</p>
<p>"I don't care. I want to feel we're moving. Sit down and tell me the
miles."</p>
<p>Cheyne sat down and read the dial for her (there were some miles which stand
for records to this day), but the seventy-foot car never changed its long
steamer-like roll, moving through the heat with the hum of a giant bee. Yet the
speed was not enough for Mrs. Cheyne; and the heat, the remorseless August
heat, was making her giddy; the clock-hands would not move, and when, oh, when
would they be in Chicago?</p>
<p>It is not true that, as they changed engines at Fort Madison, Cheyne passed
over to the Amalgamated Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers an endowment
sufficient to enable them to fight him and his fellows on equal terms for
evermore. He paid his obligations to engineers and firemen as he believed they
deserved, and only his bank knows what he gave the crews who had sympathized
with him. It is on record that the last crew took entire charge of switching
operations at Sixteenth Street, because "she" was in a doze at last, and Heaven
was to help any one who bumped her.</p>
<p>Now the highly paid specialist who conveys the Lake Shore and Michigan
Southern Limited from Chicago to Elkhart is something of an autocrat, and he
does not approve of being told how to back up to a car. None the less he
handled the "Constance" as if she might have been a load of dynamite, and when
the crew rebuked him, they did it in whispers and dumb show.</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" said the Atchinson, Topeka, and Santa Fe men, discussing life
later, "we weren't runnin' for a record. Harvey Cheyne's wife, she were sick
back, an' we didn't want to jounce her. 'Come to think of it, our runnin' time
from San Diego to Chicago was 57.54. You can tell that to them Eastern
way-trains. When we're tryin' for a record, we'll let you know."</p>
<p>To the Western man (though this would not please either city) Chicago and
Boston are cheek by jowl, and some railroads encourage the delusion. The
Limited whirled the "Constance" into Buffalo and the arms of the New York
Central and Hudson River (illustrious magnates with white whiskers and gold
charms on their watch-chains boarded her here to talk a little business to
Cheyne), who slid her gracefully into Albany, where the Boston and Albany
completed the run from tide-water to tide-water&mdash;total time, eighty-seven
hours and thirty-five minutes, or three days, fifteen hours and one half.
Harvey was waiting for them.</p>
<p>After violent emotion most people and all boys demand food. They feasted the
returned prodigal behind drawn curtains, cut off in their great happiness,
while the trains roared in and out around them. Harvey ate, drank, and enlarged
on his adventures all in one breath, and when he had a hand free his mother
fondled it. His voice was thickened with living in the open, salt air; his
palms were rough and hard, his wrists dotted with marks of gurrysores; and a
fine full flavour of codfish hung round rubber boots and blue jersey.</p>
<p>The father, well used to judging men, looked at him keenly. He did not know
what enduring harm the boy might have taken. Indeed, he caught himself thinking
that he knew very little whatever of his son; but he distinctly remembered an
unsatisfied, dough-faced youth who took delight in "calling down the old man,"
and reducing his mother to tears&mdash;such a person as adds to the gaiety of
public rooms and hotel piazzas, where the ingenuous young of the wealthy play
with or revile the bell-boys. But this well set-up fisher-youth did not
wriggle, looked at him with eyes steady, clear, and unflinching, and spoke in a
tone distinctly, even startlingly, respectful. There was that in his voice,
too, which seemed to promise that the change might be permanent, and that the
new Harvey had come to stay.</p>
<p>"Some one's been coercing him," thought Cheyne. "Now Constance would never
have allowed that. Don't see as Europe could have done it any better."</p>
<p>"But why didn't you tell this man, Troop, who you were?" the mother
repeated, when Harvey had expanded his story at least twice.</p>
<p>"Disko Troop, dear. The best man that ever walked a deck. I don't care who
the next is."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell him to put you ashore? You know Papa would have made it
up to him ten times over."</p>
<p>"I know it; but he thought I was crazy. I'm afraid I called him a thief
because I couldn't find the bills in my pocket."</p>
<p>"A sailor found them by the flagstaff that&mdash;that night," sobbed Mrs.
Cheyne.</p>
<p>"That explains it, then. I don't blame Troop any. I just said I wouldn't
work&mdash;on a Banker, too&mdash;and of course he hit me on the nose, and oh!
I bled like a stuck hog."</p>
<p>"My poor darling! They must have abused you horribly."</p>
<p>"Dunno quite. Well, after that, I saw a light."</p>
<p>Cheyne slapped his leg and chuckled. This was going to be a boy after his
own hungry heart. He had never seen precisely that twinkle in Harvey's eye
before.</p>
<p>"And the old man gave me ten and a half a month; he's paid me half now; and
I took hold with Dan and pitched right in. I can't do a man's work yet. But I
can handle a dory 'most as well as Dan, and I don't get rattled in a
fog&mdash;much; and I can take my trick in light winds&mdash;that's steering,
dear&mdash;and I can 'most bait up a trawl, and I know my ropes, of course; and
I can pitch fish till the cows come home, and I'm great on old Josephus, and
I'll show you how I can clear coffee with a piece of fish-skin, and&mdash;I
think I'll have another cup, please. Say, you've no notion what a heap of work
there is in ten and a half a month!"</p>
<p>"I began with eight and a half, my son," said Cheyne.</p>
<p>"That so? You never told me, sir."</p>
<p>"You never asked, Harve. I'll tell you about it some day, if you care to
listen. Try a stuffed olive."</p>
<p>"Troop says the most interesting thing in the world is to find out how the
next man gets his vittles. It's great to have a trimmed-up meal again. We were
well fed, though. But mug on the Banks. Disko fed us first-class. He's a great
man. And Dan&mdash;that's his son&mdash;Dan's my partner. And there's Uncle
Salters and his manures, an' he reads Josephus. He's sure I'm crazy yet. And
there's poor little Penn, and he is crazy. You mustn't talk to him about
Johnstown, because&mdash;</p>
<p>"And, oh, you must know Tom Platt and Long Jack and Manuel. Manuel saved my
life. I'm sorry he's a Portuguee. He can't talk much, but he's an everlasting
musician. He found me struck adrift and drifting, and hauled me in."</p>
<p>"I wonder your nervous system isn't completely wrecked," said Mrs.
Cheyne.</p>
<p>"What for, Mama? I worked like a horse and I ate like a hog and I slept like
a dead man."</p>
<p>That was too much for Mrs. Cheyne, who began to think of her visions of a
corpse rocking on the salty seas. She went to her stateroom, and Harvey curled
up beside his father, explaining his indebtedness.</p>
<p>"You can depend upon me to do everything I can for the crowd, Harve. They
seem to be good men on your showing."</p>
<p>"Best in the Fleet, sir. Ask at Gloucester," said Harvey. "But Disko
believes still he's cured me of being crazy. Dan's the only one I've let on to
about you, and our private cars and all the rest of it, and I'm not quite sure
Dan believes. I want to paralyze 'em to-morrow. Say, can't they run the
'Constance' over to Gloucester? Mama don't look fit to be moved, anyway, and
we're bound to finish cleaning out by tomorrow. Wouverman takes our fish. You
see, we're the first off the Banks this season, and it's four twenty-five a
quintal. We held out till he paid it. They want it quick."</p>
<p>"You mean you'll have to work to-morrow, then?"</p>
<p>"I told Troop I would. I'm on the scales. I've brought the tallies with me."
He looked at the greasy notebook with an air of importance that made his father
choke. "There isn't but three&mdash;no&mdash;two ninety-four or five quintal
more by my reckoning."</p>
<p>"Hire a substitute," suggested Cheyne, to see what Harvey would say.</p>
<p>"Can't, sir. I'm tally-man for the schooner. Troop says I've a better head
for figures than Dan. Troop's a mighty just man."</p>
<p>"Well, suppose I don't move the 'Constance' to-night, how'll you fix
it?"</p>
<p>Harvey looked at the clock, which marked twenty past eleven.</p>
<p>"Then I'll sleep here till three and catch the four o'clock freight. They
let us men from the Fleet ride free as a rule."</p>
<p>"That's a notion. But I think we can get the 'Constance' around about as
soon as your men's freight. Better go to bed now."</p>
<p>Harvey spread himself on the sofa, kicked off his boots, and was asleep
before his father could shade the electrics. Cheyne sat watching the young face
under the shadow of the arm thrown over the forehead, and among many things
that occurred to him was the notion that he might perhaps have been neglectful
as a father.</p>
<p>"One never knows when one's taking one's biggest risks," he said. "It might
have been worse than drowning; but I don't think it has&mdash;I don't think it
has. If it hasn't, I haven't enough to pay Troop, that's all; and I don't think
it has."</p>
<p>Morning brought a fresh sea breeze through the windows, the "Constance" was
side-tracked among freight-cars at Gloucester, and Harvey had gone to his
business.</p>
<p>"Then he'll fall overboard again and be drowned," the mother said
bitterly.</p>
<p>"We'll go and look, ready to throw him a rope in case. You've never seen him
working for his bread," said the father.</p>
<p>"What nonsense! As if any one expected&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, the man that hired him did. He's about right, too."</p>
<p>They went down between the stores full of fishermen's oilskins to
Wouverman's wharf where the <i>We're Here</i> rode high, her Bank flag still
flying, all hands busy as beavers in the glorious morning light. Disko stood by
the main hatch superintending Manuel, Penn, and Uncle Salters at the tackle.
Dan was swinging the loaded baskets inboard as Long Jack and Tom Platt filled
them, and Harvey, with a notebook, represented the skipper's interests before
the clerk of the scales on the salt-sprinkled wharf-edge.</p>
<p>"Ready!" cried the voices below. "Haul!" cried Disko. "Hi!" said Manuel.
"Here!" said Dan, swinging the basket. Then they heard Harvey's voice, clear
and fresh, checking the weights.</p>
<p>The last of the fish had been whipped out, and Harvey leaped from the
string-piece six feet to a ratline, as the shortest way to hand Disko the
tally, shouting, "Two ninety-seven, and an empty hold!"</p>
<p>"What's the total, Harve?" said Disko.</p>
<p>"Eight sixty-five. Three thousand six hundred and seventy-six dollars and a
quarter. 'Wish I'd share as well as wage."</p>
<p>"Well, I won't go so far as to say you hevn't deserved it, Harve. Don't you
want to slip up to Wouverman's office and take him our tallies?"</p>
<p>"Who's that boy?" said Cheyne to Dan, well used to all manner of questions
from those idle imbeciles called summer boarders.</p>
<p>"Well, he's kind o' supercargo," was the answer. "We picked him up struck
adrift on the Banks. Fell overboard from a liner, he sez. He was a passenger.
He's by way o' hem' a fisherman now."</p>
<p>"Is he worth his keep?"</p>
<p>"Ye-ep. Dad, this man wants to know ef Harve's worth his keep. Say, would
you like to go aboard? We'll fix up a ladder for her."</p>
<p>"I should very much, indeed. 'Twon't hurt you, Mama, and you'll be able to
see for yourself."</p>
<p>The woman who could not lift her head a week ago scrambled down the ladder,
and stood aghast amid the mess and tangle aft.</p>
<p>"Be you anyways interested in Harve?" said Disko.</p>
<p>"Well, ye-es."</p>
<p>"He's a good boy, an' ketches right hold jest as he's bid. You've heard haow
we found him? He was sufferin' from nervous prostration, I guess, 'r else his
head had hit somethin', when we hauled him aboard. He's all over that naow.
Yes, this is the cabin. 'Tain't in order, but you're quite welcome to look
araound. Those are his figures on the stove-pipe, where we keep the reckonin'
mostly."</p>
<p>"Did he sleep here?" said Mrs. Cheyne, sitting on a yellow locker and
surveying the disorderly bunks.</p>
<p>"No. He berthed forward, madam, an' only fer him an' my boy hookin' fried
pies an muggin' up when they ought to ha' been asleep, I dunno as I've any
special fault to find with him."</p>
<p>"There weren't nothin' wrong with Harve," said Uncle Salters, descending the
steps. "He hung my boots on the main-truck, and he ain't over an' above
respectful to such as knows more'n he do, specially about farmin'; but he were
mostly misled by Dan."</p>
<p>Dan in the meantime, profiting by dark hints from Harvey early that morning,
was executing a war-dance on deck. "Tom, Tom!" he whispered down the hatch.
"His folks has come, an' Dad hain't caught on yet, an' they're pow-wowin' in
the cabin. She's a daisy, an' he's all Harve claimed he was, by the looks of
him."</p>
<p>"Howly Smoke!" said Long Jack, climbing out covered with salt and fish-skin.
"D'ye belave his tale av the kid an' the little four-horse rig was thrue?"</p>
<p>"I knew it all along," said Dan. "Come an' see Dad mistook in his
judgments."</p>
<p>They came delightedly, just in time to hear Cheyne say: "I'm glad he has a
good character, because&mdash;he's my son."</p>
<p>Disko's jaw fell,&mdash;Long Jack always vowed that he heard the click of
it,&mdash;and he stared alternately at the man and the woman.</p>
<p>"I got his telegram in San Diego four days ago, and we came over."</p>
<p>"In a private car?" said Dan. "He said ye might."</p>
<p>"In a private car, of course."</p>
<p>Dan looked at his father with a hurricane of irreverent winks.</p>
<p>"There was a tale he told us av drivin' four little ponies in a rig av his
own," said Long Jack. "Was that thrue now?"</p>
<p>"Very likely," said Cheyne. "Was it, Mama?"</p>
<p>"He had a little drag when we were in Toledo, I think," said the mother.</p>
<p>Long Jack whistled. "Oh, Disko!" said he, and that was all.</p>
<p>"I wuz&mdash;I am mistook in my jedgments&mdash;worse'n the men o'
Marblehead," said Disko, as though the words were being windlassed out of him.
"I don't mind ownin' to you, Mr. Cheyne, as I mistrusted the boy to be crazy.
He talked kinder odd about money."</p>
<p>"So he told me."</p>
<p>"Did he tell ye anything else? 'Cause I pounded him once." This with a
somewhat anxious glance at Mrs. Cheyne.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," Cheyne replied. "I should say it probably did him more good than
anything else in the world."</p>
<p>"I jedged 'twuz necessary, er I wouldn't ha' done it. I don't want you to
think we abuse our boys any on this packet."</p>
<p>"I don't think you do, Mr. Troop."</p>
<p>Mrs. Cheyne had been looking at the faces&mdash;Disko's ivory-yellow,
hairless, iron countenance; Uncle Salters's, with its rim of agricultural hair;
Penn's bewildered simplicity; Manuel's quiet smile; Long Jack's grin of
delight, and Tom Platt's scar. Rough, by her standards, they certainly were;
but she had a mother's wits in her eyes, and she rose with out-stretched
hands.</p>
<p>"Oh, tell me, which is who?" said she, half sobbing. "I want to thank you
and bless you&mdash;all of you."</p>
<p>"Faith, that pays me a hunder time," said Long Jack.</p>
<p>Disko introduced them all in due form. The captain of an old-time Chinaman
could have done no better, and Mrs. Cheyne babbled incoherently. She nearly
threw herself into Manuel's arms when she understood that he had first found
Harvey.</p>
<p>"But how shall I leave him dreeft?" said poor Manuel. "What do you yourself
if you find him so? Eh, wha-at? We are in one good boy, and I am ever so
pleased he come to be your son."</p>
<p>"And he told me Dan was his partner!" she cried. Dan was already
sufficiently pink, but he turned a rich crimson when Mrs. Cheyne kissed him on
both cheeks before the assembly. Then they led her forward to show her the
foc'sle, at which she wept again, and must needs go down to see Harvey's
identical bunk, and there she found the nigger cook cleaning up the stove, and
he nodded as though she were some one he had expected to meet for years. They
tried, two at a time, to explain the boat's daily life to her, and she sat by
the pawl-post, her gloved hands on the greasy table, laughing with trembling
lips and crying with dancing eyes.</p>
<p>"And who's ever to use the <i>We're Here</i> after this?" said Long Jack to
Tom Platt. "I feel as if she'd made a cathedral av ut all."</p>
<p>"Cathedral!" sneered Tom Platt. "Oh, if it had bin even the Fish C'mmission
boat instid of this bally-hoo o' blazes. If we only hed some decency an' order
an' side-boys when she goes over! She'll have to climb that ladder like a hen,
an' we&mdash;we ought to be mannin' the yards!"</p>
<p>"Then Harvey was not mad," said Penn, slowly, to Cheyne.</p>
<p>"No, indeed&mdash;thank God," the big millionaire replied, stooping down
tenderly.</p>
<p>"It must be terrible to be mad. Except to lose your child, I do not know
anything more terrible. But your child has come back? Let us thank God for
that."</p>
<p>"Hello!" cried Harvey, looking down upon them benignly from the wharf.</p>
<p>"I wuz mistook, Harve. I wuz mistook," said Disko, swiftly, holding up a
hand. "I wuz mistook in my jedgments. Ye needn't rub in any more."</p>
<p>"Guess I'll take care o' that," said Dan, under his breath.</p>
<p>"You'll be goin' off naow, won't ye?"</p>
<p>"Well, not without the balance of my wages, 'less you want to have the
<i>We're Here</i> attached."</p>
<p>"Thet's so; I'd clean forgot"; and he counted out the remaining dollars.
"You done all you contracted to do, Harve; and you done it 'baout's well as if
you'd been brought up&mdash;" Here Disko brought himself up. He did not quite
see where the sentence was going to end.</p>
<p>"Outside of a private car?" suggested Dan, wickedly.</p>
<p>"Come on, and I'll show her to you," said Harvey.</p>
<p>Cheyne stayed to talk with Disko, but the others made a procession to the
depot, with Mrs. Cheyne at the head. The French maid shrieked at the invasion;
and Harvey laid the glories of the "Constance" before them without a word. They
took them in in equal silence&mdash;stamped leather, silver door-handles and
rails, cut velvet, plate-glass, nickel, bronze, hammered iron, and the rare
woods of the continent inlaid.</p>
<p>"I told you," said Harvey; "I told you." This was his crowning revenge, and
a most ample one.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cheyne decreed a meal, and that nothing might be lacking to the tale
Long Jack told afterwards in his boarding-house, she waited on them herself.
Men who are accustomed to eat at tiny tables in howling gales have curiously
neat and finished manners; but Mrs. Cheyne, who did not know this, was
surprised. She longed to have Manuel for a butler; so silently and easily did
he comport himself among the frail glassware and dainty silver. Tom Platt
remembered the great days on the Ohio and the manners of foreign potentates who
dined with the officers; and Long Jack, being Irish, supplied the small talk
till all were at their ease.</p>
<p>In the <i>We're Here's</i> cabin the fathers took stock of each other behind
their cigars. Cheyne knew well enough when he dealt with a man to whom he could
not offer money; equally well he knew that no money could pay for what Disko
had done. He kept his own counsel and waited for an opening.</p>
<p>"I hevn't done anything to your boy or fer your boy excep' make him work a
piece an' learn him how to handle the hog-yoke," said Disko. "He has twice my
boy's head for figgers."</p>
<p>"By the way," Cheyne answered casually, "what d'you calculate to make of
your boy?"</p>
<p>Disko removed his cigar and waved it comprehensively round the cabin. "Dan's
jest plain boy, an' he don't allow me to do any of his thinkin'. He'll hev this
able little packet when I'm laid by. He ain't noways anxious to quit the
business. I know that."</p>
<p>"Mmm! 'Ever been West, Mr. Troop?"</p>
<p>"'Bin's fer ez Noo York once in a boat. I've no use for railroads. No more
hez Dan. Salt water's good enough fer the Troops. I've been 'most
everywhere&mdash;in the nat'ral way, o' course."</p>
<p>"I can give him all the salt water he's likely to need&mdash;till he's a
skipper."</p>
<p>"Haow's that? I thought you wuz a kinder railroad king. Harve told me so
when&mdash;I was mistook in my jedgments."</p>
<p>"We're all apt to be mistaken. I fancied perhaps you might know I own a line
of tea-clippers&mdash;San Francisco to Yokohama&mdash;six of
'em&mdash;iron-built, about seventeen hundred and eighty tons apiece.</p>
<p>"Blame that boy! He never told. I'd ha' listened to that, instid o' his
truck abaout railroads an' pony-carriages."</p>
<p>"He didn't know."</p>
<p>"'Little thing like that slipped his mind, I guess."</p>
<p>"No, I only capt&mdash;took hold of the 'Blue M.' freighters&mdash;Morgan
and McQuade's old line&mdash;this summer." Disko collapsed where he sat, beside
the stove.</p>
<p>"Great Caesar Almighty! I mistrust I've been fooled from one end to the
other. Why, Phil Airheart he went from this very town six year back&mdash;no,
seven&mdash;an' he's mate on the San Jose&mdash;now&mdash;twenty-six days was
her time out. His sister she's livin' here yet, an' she reads his letters to my
woman. An' you own the 'Blue M.' freighters?"</p>
<p>Cheyne nodded.</p>
<p>"If I'd known that I'd ha' jerked the <i>We're Here</i> back to port all
standin', on the word."</p>
<p>"Perhaps that wouldn't have been so good for Harvey."</p>
<p>"If I'd only known! If he'd only said about the cussed Line, I'd ha'
understood! I'll never stand on my own jedgments again&mdash;never. They're
well-found packets. Phil Airheart he says so."</p>
<p>"I'm glad to have a recommend from that quarter. Airheart's skipper of the
San Jose now. What I was getting at is to know whether you'd lend me Dan for a
year or two, and we'll see if we can't make a mate of him. Would you trust him
to Airheart?"</p>
<p>"It's a resk taking a raw boy&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know a man who did more for me."</p>
<p>"That's diff'runt. Look at here naow, I ain't recommendin' Dan special
because he's my own flesh an' blood. I know Bank ways ain't clipper ways, but
he hain't much to learn. Steer he can&mdash;no boy better, if I say
it&mdash;an' the rest's in our blood an' get; but I could wish he warn't so
cussed weak on navigation."</p>
<p>"Airheart will attend to that. He'll ship as boy for a voyage or two, and
then we can put him in the way of doing better. Suppose you take him in hand
this winter, and I'll send for him early in the spring. I know the Pacific's a
long ways off&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Pshaw! We Troops, livin' an' dead, are all around the earth an' the seas
thereof."</p>
<p>"But I want you to understand&mdash;and I mean this&mdash;any time you think
you'd like to see him, tell me, and I'll attend to the transportation. 'Twon't
cost you a cent."</p>
<p>"If you'll walk a piece with me, we'll go to my house an' talk this to my
woman. I've bin so crazy mistook in all my jedgments, it don't seem to me this
was like to be real."</p>
<p>They went blue-trimmed of nasturtiums over to Troop's
eighteen-hundred-dollar, white house, with a retired dory full in the front
yard and a shuttered parlour which was a museum of oversea plunder. There sat a
large woman, silent and grave, with the dim eyes of those who look long to sea
for the return of their beloved. Cheyne addressed himself to her, and she gave
consent wearily.</p>
<p>"We lose one hundred a year from Gloucester only, Mr. Cheyne," she
said&mdash;"one hundred boys an' men; and I've come so's to hate the sea as if
'twuz alive an' listenin'. God never made it fer humans to anchor on. These
packets o' yours they go straight out, I take it' and straight home again?"</p>
<p>"As straight as the winds let 'em, and I give a bonus for record passages.
Tea don't improve by being at sea."</p>
<p>"When he wuz little he used to play at keeping store, an' I had hopes he
might follow that up. But soon's he could paddle a dory I knew that were goin'
to be denied me."</p>
<p>"They're square-riggers, Mother; iron-built an' well found. Remember what
Phil's sister reads you when she gits his letters."</p>
<p>"I've never known as Phil told lies, but he's too venturesome (like most of
'em that use the sea). If Dan sees fit, Mr. Cheyne, he can go&mdash;fer all o'
me."</p>
<p>"She jest despises the ocean," Disko explained, "an' I&mdash;I dunno haow to
act polite, I guess, er I'd thank you better."</p>
<p>"My father&mdash;my own eldest brother&mdash;two nephews&mdash;an' my second
sister's man," she said, dropping her head on her hand. "Would you care fer any
one that took all those?"</p>
<p>Cheyne was relieved when Dan turned up and accepted with more delight than
he was able to put into words. Indeed, the offer meant a plain and sure road to
all desirable things; but Dan thought most of commanding watch on broad decks,
and looking into far-away harbours.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cheyne had spoken privately to the unaccountable Manuel in the matter
of Harvey's rescue. He seemed to have no desire for money. Pressed hard, he
said that he would take five dollars, because he wanted to buy something for a
girl. Otherwise&mdash;"How shall I take money when I make so easy my eats and
smokes? You will giva some if I like or no? Eh, wha-at? Then you shall giva me
money, but not that way. You shall giva all you can think." He introduced her
to a snuffy Portuguese priest with a list of semi-destitute widows as long as
his cassock. As a strict Unitarian, Mrs. Cheyne could not sympathize with the
creed, but she ended by respecting the brown, voluble little man.</p>
<p>Manuel, faithful son of the Church, appropriated all the blessings showered
on her for her charity. "That letta me out," said he. "I have now ver' good
absolutions for six months"; and he strolled forth to get a handkerchief for
the girl of the hour and to break the hearts of all the others.</p>
<p>Salters went West for a season with Penn, and left no address behind. He had
a dread that these millionary people, with wasteful private cars, might take
undue interest in his companion. It was better to visit inland relatives till
the coast was clear. "Never you be adopted by rich folk, Penn," he said in the
cars, "or I'll take 'n' break this checker-board over your head. Ef you forgit
your name agin&mdash;which is Pratt&mdash;you remember you belong with Salters
Troop, an' set down right where you are till I come fer you. Don't go taggin'
araound after them whose eyes bung out with fatness, accordin' to
Scripcher."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>But it was otherwise with the <i>We're Here's</i> silent cook, for he came
up, his kit in a handkerchief, and boarded the "Constance." Pay was no
particular object, and he did not in the least care where he slept. His
business, as revealed to him in dreams, was to follow Harvey for the rest of
his days. They tried argument and, at last, persuasion; but there is a
difference between one Cape Breton and two Alabama negroes, and the matter was
referred to Cheyne by the cook and porter. The millionaire only laughed. He
presumed Harvey might need a body-servant some day or other, and was sure that
one volunteer was worth five hirelings. Let the man stay, therefore; even
though he called himself MacDonald and swore in Gaelic. The car could go back
to Boston, where, if he were still of the same mind, they would take him
West.</p>
<p>With the "Constance," which in his heart of hearts he loathed, departed the
last remnant of Cheyne's millionairedom, and he gave himself up to an energetic
idleness. This Gloucester was a new town in a new land, and he purposed to
"take it in," as of old he had taken in all the cities from Snohomish to San
Diego of that world whence he hailed. They made money along the crooked street
which was half wharf and half ship's store: as a leading professional he wished
to learn how the noble game was played. Men said that four out of every five
fish-balls served at New England's Sunday breakfast came from Gloucester, and
overwhelmed him with figures in proof&mdash;statistics of boats, gear,
wharf-frontage, capital invested, salting, packing, factories, insurance,
wages, repairs, and profits. He talked with the owners of the large fleets
whose skippers were little more than hired men, and whose crews were almost all
Swedes or Portuguese. Then he conferred with Disko, one of the few who owned
their craft, and compared notes in his vast head. He coiled himself away on
chain-cables in marine junk-shops, asking questions with cheerful, unslaked
Western curiosity, till all the water-front wanted to know "what in thunder
that man was after, anyhow." He prowled into the Mutual Insurance rooms, and
demanded explanations of the mysterious remarks chalked up on the blackboard
day by day; and that brought down upon him secretaries of every Fisherman's
Widow and Orphan Aid Society within the city limits. They begged shamelessly,
each man anxious to beat the other institution's record, and Cheyne tugged at
his beard and handed them all over to Mrs. Cheyne.</p>
<p>She was resting in a boarding-house near Eastern Point&mdash;a strange
establishment, managed, apparently, by the boarders, where the table-cloths
were red-and-white-checkered and the population, who seemed to have known one
another intimately for years, rose up at midnight to make Welsh rarebits if it
felt hungry. On the second morning of her stay Mrs. Cheyne put away her diamond
solitaires before she came down to breakfast.</p>
<p>"They're most delightful people," she confided to her husband; "so friendly
and simple, too, though they are all Boston, nearly."</p>
<p>"That isn't simpleness, Mama," he said, looking across the boulders behind
the apple-trees where the hammocks were slung. "It's the other thing, that what
I haven't got."</p>
<p>"It can't be," said Mrs. Cheyne quietly. "There isn't a woman here owns a
dress that cost a hundred dollars. Why, we&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know it, dear. We have&mdash;of course we have. I guess it's only the
style they wear East. Are you having a good time?"</p>
<p>"I don't see very much of Harvey; he's always with you; but I ain't near as
nervous as I was."</p>
<p>"I haven't had such a good time since Willie died. I never rightly
understood that I had a son before this. Harve's got to be a great boy.
'Anything I can fetch you, dear? 'Cushion under your head? Well, we'll go down
to the wharf again and look around."</p>
<p>Harvey was his father's shadow in those days, and the two strolled along
side by side, Cheyne using the grades as an excuse for laying his hand on the
boy's square shoulder. It was then that Harvey noticed and admired what had
never struck him before&mdash;his father's curious power of getting at the
heart of new matters as learned from men in the street.</p>
<p>"How d'you make 'em tell you everything without opening your head?" demanded
the son, as they came out of a rigger's loft.</p>
<p>"I've dealt with quite a few men in my time, Harve, and one sizes 'em up
somehow, I guess. I know something about myself, too." Then, after a pause, as
they sat down on a wharf-edge: "Men can 'most always tell when a man has
handled things for himself, and then they treat him as one of themselves."</p>
<p>"Same as they treat me down at Wouverman's wharf. I'm one of the crowd now.
Disko has told every one I've earned my pay." Harvey spread out his hands and
rubbed the palms together. "They're all soft again," he said dolefully.</p>
<p>"Keep 'em that way for the next few years, while you're getting your
education. You can harden 'em up after."</p>
<p>"Ye-es, I suppose so," was the reply, in no delighted voice.</p>
<p>"It rests with you, Harve. You can take cover behind your mama, of course,
and put her on to fussing about your nerves and your high-strungness and all
that kind of poppycock."</p>
<p>"Have I ever done that?" said Harvey, uneasily.</p>
<p>His father turned where he sat and thrust out a long hand. "You know as well
as I do that I can't make anything of you if you don't act straight by me. I
can handle you alone if you'll stay alone, but I don't pretend to manage both
you and Mama. Life's too short, anyway."</p>
<p>"Don't make me out much of a fellow, does it?"</p>
<p>"I guess it was my fault a good deal; but if you want the truth, you haven't
been much of anything up to date. Now, have you?"</p>
<p>"Umm! Disko thinks...Say, what d'you reckon it's cost you to raise me from
the start&mdash;first, last and all over?"</p>
<p>Cheyne smiled. "I've never kept track, but I should estimate, in dollars and
cents, nearer fifty than forty thousand; maybe sixty. The young generation
comes high. It has to have things, and it tires of 'em, and&mdash;the old man
foots the bill."</p>
<p>Harvey whistled, but at heart he was rather pleased to think that his
upbringing had cost so much. "And all that's sunk capital, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Invested, Harve. Invested, I hope."</p>
<p>"Making it only thirty thousand, the thirty I've earned is about ten cents
on the hundred. That's a mighty poor catch." Harvey wagged his head
solemnly.</p>
<p>Cheyne laughed till he nearly fell off the pile into the water.</p>
<p>"Disko has got a heap more than that out of Dan since he was ten; and Dan's
at school half the year, too."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's what you're after, is it?"</p>
<p>"No. I'm not after anything. I'm not stuck on myself any just
now&mdash;that's all...I ought to be kicked."</p>
<p>"I can't do it, old man; or I would, I presume, if I'd been made that
way."</p>
<p>"Then I'd have remembered it to the last day I lived&mdash;and never
forgiven you," said Harvey, his chin on his doubled fists.</p>
<p>"Exactly. That's about what I'd do. You see?"</p>
<p>"I see. The fault's with me and no one else. All the same, something's got
to be done about it."</p>
<p>Cheyne drew a cigar from his vest-pocket, bit off the end, and fell to
smoking. Father and son were very much alike; for the beard hid Cheyne's mouth,
and Harvey had his father's slightly aquiline nose, close-set black eyes, and
narrow, high cheek-bones. With a touch of brown paint he would have made up
very picturesquely as a Red Indian of the story-books.</p>
<p>"Now you can go on from here," said Cheyne, slowly, "costing me between six
or eight thousand a year till you're a voter. Well, we'll call you a man then.
You can go right on from that, living on me to the tune of forty or fifty
thousand, besides what your mother will give you, with a valet and a yacht or a
fancy-ranch where you can pretend to raise trotting-stock and play cards with
your own crowd."</p>
<p>"Like Lorry Tuck?" Harvey put in.</p>
<p>"Yep; or the two De Vitre boys or old man McQuade's son. California's full
of 'em, and here's an Eastern sample while we're talking."</p>
<p>A shiny black steam-yacht, with mahogany deck-house, nickel-plated
binnacles, and pink-and-white-striped awnings puffed up the harbour, flying the
burgee of some New York club. Two young men in what they conceived to be sea
costumes were playing cards by the saloon skylight; and a couple of women with
red and blue parasols looked on and laughed noisily.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't care to be caught out in her in any sort of a breeze. No beam,"
said Harvey, critically, as the yacht slowed to pick up her mooring-buoy.</p>
<p>"They're having what stands them for a good time. I can give you that, and
twice as much as that, Harve. How'd you like it?"</p>
<p>"Caesar! That's no way to get a dinghy overside," said Harvey, still intent
on the yacht. "If I couldn't slip a tackle better than that I'd stay
ashore...What if I don't?"</p>
<p>"Stay ashore&mdash;or what?"</p>
<p>"Yacht and ranch and live on 'the old man,' and&mdash;get behind Mama where
there's trouble," said Harvey, with a twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>"Why, in that case, you come right in with me, my son."</p>
<p>"Ten dollars a month?" Another twinkle.</p>
<p>"Not a cent more until you're worth it, and you won't begin to touch that
for a few years."</p>
<p>"I'd sooner begin sweeping out the office&mdash;isn't that how the big bugs
start?&mdash;and touch something now than&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know it; we all feel that way. But I guess we can hire any sweeping we
need. I made the same mistake myself of starting in too soon."</p>
<p>"Thirty million dollars' worth o' mistake, wasn't it? I'd risk it for
that."</p>
<p>"I lost some; and I gained some. I'll tell you."</p>
<p>Cheyne pulled his beard and smiled as he looked over the still water, and
spoke away from Harvey, who presently began to be aware that his father was
telling the story of his life. He talked in a low, even voice, without gesture
and without expression; and it was a history for which a dozen leading journals
would cheerfully have paid many dollars&mdash;the story of forty years that was
at the same time the story of the New West, whose story is yet to be
written.</p>
<p>It began with a kinless boy turned loose in Texas, and went on fantastically
through a hundred changes and chops of life, the scenes shifting from State
after Western State, from cities that sprang up in a month and&mdash;in a
season utterly withered away, to wild ventures in wilder camps that are now
laborious, paved municipalities. It covered the building of three railroads and
the deliberate wreck of a fourth. It told of steamers, townships, forests, and
mines, and the men of every nation under heaven, manning, creating, hewing, and
digging these. It touched on chances of gigantic wealth flung before eyes that
could not see, or missed by the merest accident of time and travel; and through
the mad shift of things, sometimes on horseback, more often afoot, now rich,
now poor, in and out, and back and forth, deck-hand, train-hand, contractor,
boarding-house keeper, journalist, engineer, drummer, real-estate agent,
politician, dead-beat, rum-seller, mine-owner, speculator, cattle-man, or
tramp, moved Harvey Cheyne, alert and quiet, seeking his own ends, and, so he
said, the glory and advancement of his country.</p>
<p>He told of the faith that never deserted him even when he hung on the ragged
edge of despair&mdash;the faith that comes of knowing men and things. He
enlarged, as though he were talking to himself, on his very great courage and
resource at all times. The thing was so evident in the man's mind that he never
even changed his tone. He described how he had bested his enemies, or forgiven
them, exactly as they had bested or forgiven him in those careless days; how he
had entreated, cajoled, and bullied towns, companies, and syndicates, all for
their enduring good; crawled round, through, or under mountains and ravines,
dragging a string and hoop-iron railroad after him, and in the end, how he had
sat still while promiscuous communities tore the last fragments of his
character to shreds.</p>
<p>The tale held Harvey almost breathless, his head a little cocked to one
side, his eyes fixed on his father's face, as the twilight deepened and the red
cigar-end lit up the furrowed cheeks and heavy eyebrows. It seemed to him like
watching a locomotive storming across country in the dark&mdash;a mile between
each glare of the open fire-door: but this locomotive could talk, and the words
shook and stirred the boy to the core of his soul. At last Cheyne pitched away
the cigar-butt, and the two sat in the dark over the lapping water.</p>
<p>"I've never told that to any one before," said the father.</p>
<p>Harvey gasped. "It's just the greatest thing that ever was!" said he.</p>
<p>"That's what I got. Now I'm coming to what I didn't get. It won't sound much
of anything to you, but I don't wish you to be as old as I am before you find
out. I can handle men, of course, and I'm no fool along my own lines,
but&mdash;but&mdash;I can't compete with the man who has been taught! I've
picked up as I went along, and I guess it sticks out all over me."</p>
<p>"I've never seen it," said the son, indignantly.</p>
<p>"You will, though, Harve. You will&mdash;just as soon as you're through
college. Don't I know it? Don't I know the look on men's faces when they think
me a&mdash;a 'mucker,' as they call it out here? I can break them to little
pieces&mdash;yes&mdash;but I can't get back at 'em to hurt 'em where they live.
I don't say they're 'way 'way up, but I feel I'm 'way, 'way, 'way off, somehow.
Now you've got your chance. You've got to soak up all the learning that's
around, and you'll live with a crowd that are doing the same thing. They'll be
doing it for a few thousand dollars a year at most; but remember you'll be
doing it for millions. You'll learn law enough to look after your own property
when I'm out o' the light, and you'll have to be solid with the best men in the
market (they are useful later); and above all, you'll have to stow away the
plain, common, sit-down-with-your chin-on your-elbows book-learning. Nothing
pays like that, Harve, and it's bound to pay more and more each year in our
country&mdash;in business and in politics. You'll see."</p>
<p>"There's no sugar in my end of the deal," said Harvey. "Four years at
college! 'Wish I'd chosen the valet and the yacht!"</p>
<p>"Never mind, my son," Cheyne insisted. "You're investing your capital where
it'll bring in the best returns; and I guess you won't find our property shrunk
any when you're ready to take hold. Think it over, and let me know in the
morning. Hurry! We'll be late for supper!"</p>
<p>As this was a business talk, there was no need for Harvey to tell his mother
about it; and Cheyne naturally took the same point of view. But Mrs. Cheyne saw
and feared, and was a little jealous. Her boy, who rode rough-shod over her,
was gone, and in his stead reigned a keen-faced youth, abnormally silent, who
addressed most of his conversation to his father. She understood it was
business, and therefore a matter beyond her premises. If she had any doubts,
they were resolved when Cheyne went to Boston and brought back a new diamond
marquise ring.</p>
<p>"What have you two been doing now?" she said, with a weak little smile, as
she turned it in the light.</p>
<p>"Talking&mdash;just talking, Mama; there's nothing mean about Harvey."</p>
<p>There was not. The boy had made a treaty on his own account. Railroads, he
explained gravely, interested him as little as lumber, real estate, or mining.
What his soul yearned after was control of his father's newly purchased
sailing-ship. If that could be promised him within what he conceived to be a
reasonable time, he, for his part, guaranteed diligence and sobriety at college
for four or five years. In vacation he was to be allowed full access to all
details connected with the line&mdash;he had not asked more than two thousand
questions about it,&mdash;from his father's most private papers in the safe to
the tug in San Francisco harbour.</p>
<p>"It's a deal," said Cheyne at the last. "You'll alter your mind twenty times
before you leave college, o' course; but if you take hold of it in proper
shape, and if you don't tie it up before you're twenty-three, I'll make the
thing over to you. How's that, Harve?"</p>
<p>"Nope; never pays to split up a going concern. There's too much competition
in the world anyway, and Disko says 'blood-kin hev to stick together.' His
crowd never go back on him. That's one reason, he says, why they make such big
fares. Say, the <i>We're Here</i> goes off to the Georges on Monday. They don't
stay long ashore, do they?"</p>
<p>"Well, we ought to be going, too, I guess. I've left my business hung up at
loose ends between two oceans, and it's time to connect again. I just hate to
do it, though; haven't had a holiday like this for twenty years."</p>
<p>"We can't go without seeing Disko off," said Harvey; "and Monday's Memorial
Day. Let's stay over that, anyway."</p>
<p>"What is this memorial business? They were talking about it at the
boarding-house," said Cheyne weakly. He, too, was not anxious to spoil the
golden days.</p>
<p>"Well, as far as I can make out, this business is a sort of song-and-dance
act, whacked up for the summer boarders. Disko don't think much of it, he says,
because they take up a collection for the widows and orphans. Disko's
independent. Haven't you noticed that?"</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;yes. A little. In spots. Is it a town show, then?"</p>
<p>"The summer convention is. They read out the names of the fellows drowned or
gone astray since last time, and they make speeches, and recite, and all. Then,
Disko says, the secretaries of the Aid Societies go into the back yard and
fight over the catch. The real show, he says, is in the spring. The ministers
all take a hand then, and there aren't any summer boarders around."</p>
<p>"I see," said Cheyne, with the brilliant and perfect comprehension of one
born into and bred up to city pride. "We'll stay over for Memorial Day, and get
off in the afternoon."</p>
<p>"Guess I'll go down to Disko's and make him bring his crowd up before they
sail. I'll have to stand with them, of course."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's it, is it," said Cheyne. "I'm only a poor summer boarder, and
you're&mdash;"</p>
<p>"A Banker&mdash;full-blooded Banker," Harvey called back as he boarded a
trolley, and Cheyne went on with his blissful dreams for the future.</p>
<p>Disko had no use for public functions where appeals were made for charity,
but Harvey pleaded that the glory of the day would be lost, so far as he was
concerned, if the <i>We're Heres</i> absented themselves. Then Disko made
conditions. He had heard&mdash;it was astonishing how all the world knew all
the world's business along the water-front&mdash;he had heard that a
"Philadelphia actress-woman" was going to take part in the exercises; and he
mistrusted that she would deliver "Skipper Ireson's Ride." Personally, he had
as little use for actresses as for summer boarders; but justice was justice,
and though he himself (here Dan giggled) had once slipped up on a matter of
judgment, this thing must not be. So Harvey came back to East Gloucester, and
spent half a day explaining to an amused actress with a royal reputation on two
seaboards the inwardness of the mistake she contemplated; and she admitted that
it was justice, even as Disko had said.</p>
<p>Cheyne knew by old experience what would happen; but anything of the nature
of a public palaver was meat and drink to the man's soul. He saw the trolleys
hurrying west, in the hot, hazy morning, full of women in light summer dresses,
and white-faced straw-hatted men fresh from Boston desks; the stack of bicycles
outside the post office; the come-and-go of busy officials, greeting one
another; the slow flick and swash of bunting in the heavy air; and the
important man with a hose sluicing the brick sidewalk.</p>
<p>"Mother," he said suddenly, "don't you remember&mdash;after Seattle was
burned out&mdash;and they got her going again?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Cheyne nodded, and looked critically down the crooked street. Like her
husband, she understood these gatherings, all the West over, and compared them
one against another. The fishermen began to mingle with the crowd about the
town-hall doors&mdash;blue-jowled Portuguese, their women bare-headed or
shawled for the most part; clear-eyed Nova Scotians, and men of the Maritime
Provinces; French, Italians, Swedes, and Danes, with outside crews of coasting
schooners; and everywhere women in black, who saluted one another with gloomy
pride, for this was their day of great days. And there were ministers of many
creeds,&mdash;pastors of great, gilt-edged congregations, at the seaside for a
rest, with shepherds of the regular work,&mdash;from the priests of the Church
on the Hill to bush-bearded ex-sailor Lutherans, hail-fellow with the men of a
score of boats. There were owners of lines of schooners, large contributors to
the societies, and small men, their few craft pawned to the mastheads, with
bankers and marine-insurance agents, captains of tugs and water-boats, riggers,
fitters, lumpers, salters, boat-builders, and coopers, and all the mixed
population of the water-front.</p>
<p>They drifted along the line of seats made gay with the dresses of the summer
boarders, and one of the town officials patrolled and perspired till he shone
all over with pure civic pride. Cheyne had met him for five minutes a few days
before, and between the two there was entire understanding.</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Cheyne, and what d'you think of our city?&mdash;Yes, madam, you
can sit anywhere you please.&mdash;You have this kind of thing out West, I
presume?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but we aren't as old as you."</p>
<p>"That's so, of course. You ought to have been at the exercises when we
celebrated our two hundred and fiftieth birthday. I tell you, Mr. Cheyne, the
old city did herself credit."</p>
<p>"So I heard. It pays, too. What's the matter with the town that it don't
have a first-class hotel, though?"</p>
<p>"&mdash;Right over there to the left, Pedro. Heaps o' room for you and your
crowd.&mdash;Why, that's what I tell 'em all the time, Mr. Cheyne. There's big
money in it, but I presume that don't affect you any. What we want
is&mdash;"</p>
<p>A heavy hand fell on his broadcloth shoulder, and the flushed skipper of a
Portland coal-and-ice coaster spun him half round. "What in thunder do you
fellows mean by clappin' the law on the town when all decent men are at sea
this way? Heh? Town's dry as a bone, an' smells a sight worse sence I quit.
'Might ha' left us one saloon for soft drinks, anyway."</p>
<p>"Don't seem to have hindered your nourishment this morning, Carsen. I'll go
into the politics of it later. Sit down by the door and think over your
arguments till I come back."</p>
<p>"What good is arguments to me? In Miquelon champagne's eighteen dollars a
case and&mdash;" The skipper lurched into his seat as an organ-prelude silenced
him.</p>
<p>"Our new organ," said the official proudly to Cheyne. "Cost us four thousand
dollars, too. We'll have to get back to high-license next year to pay for it. I
wasn't going to let the ministers have all the religion at their convention.
Those are some of our orphans standing up to sing. My wife taught 'em. See you
again later, Mr. Cheyne. I'm wanted on the platform."</p>
<p>High, clear, and true, children's voices bore down the last noise of those
settling into their places.</p>
<p>"O all ye Works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: praise him and magnify him
for ever!"</p>
<p>The women throughout the hall leaned forward to look as the reiterated
cadences filled the air. Mrs. Cheyne, with some others, began to breathe short;
she had hardly imagined there were so many widows in the world; and
instinctively searched for Harvey. He had found the <i>We're Heres</i> at the
back of the audience, and was standing, as by right, between Dan and Disko.
Uncle Salters, returned the night before with Penn, from Pamlico Sound,
received him suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Hain't your folk gone yet?" he grunted. "What are you doin' here, young
feller?"</p>
<p>"O ye Seas and Floods, bless ye the Lord: praise him, and magnify him for
ever!"</p>
<p>"Hain't he good right?" said Dan. "He's bin there, same as the rest of
us."</p>
<p>"Not in them clothes," Salters snarled.</p>
<p>"Shut your head, Salters," said Disko. "Your bile's gone back on you. Stay
right where ye are, Harve."</p>
<p>Then up and spoke the orator of the occasion, another pillar of the
municipality, bidding the world welcome to Gloucester, and incidentally
pointing out wherein Gloucester excelled the rest of the world. Then he turned
to the sea-wealth of the city, and spoke of the price that must be paid for the
yearly harvest. They would hear later the names of their lost dead one hundred
and seventeen of them. (The widows stared a little, and looked at one another
here.) Gloucester could not boast any overwhelming mills or factories. Her sons
worked for such wage as the sea gave; and they all knew that neither Georges
nor the Banks were cow-pastures. The utmost that folk ashore could accomplish
was to help the widows and the orphans, and after a few general remarks he took
this opportunity of thanking, in the name of the city, those who had so
public-spiritedly consented to participate in the exercises of the
occasion.</p>
<p>"I jest despise the beggin' pieces in it," growled Disko. "It don't give
folk a fair notion of us."</p>
<p>"Ef folk won't be fore-handed an' put by when they've the chance," returned
Salters, "it stands in the nature o' things they hev to be 'shamed. You take
warnin' by that, young feller. Riches endureth but for a season, ef you scatter
them araound on lugsuries&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But to lose everything, everything," said Penn. "What can you do then? Once
I"&mdash;the watery blue eyes stared up and down as if looking for something to
steady them&mdash;"once I read&mdash;in a book, I think&mdash;of a boat where
every one was run down&mdash;except some one&mdash;and he said to
me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Shucks!" said Salters, cutting in. "You read a little less an' take more
int'rust in your vittles, and you'll come nearer earnin' your keep, Penn."</p>
<p>Harvey, jammed among the fishermen, felt a creepy, crawly, tingling thrill
that began in the back of his neck and ended at his boots. He was cold, too,
though it was a stifling day.</p>
<p>"That the actress from Philadelphia?" said Disko Troop, scowling at the
platform. "You've fixed it about old man Ireson, hain't ye, Harve? Ye know why
naow."</p>
<p>It was not "Ireson's Ride" that the woman delivered, but some sort of poem
about a fishing-port called Brixham and a fleet of trawlers beating in against
storm by night, while the women made a guiding fire at the head of the quay
with everything they could lay hands on.</p>
<blockquote>"They took the grandma's blanket,<br>
Who shivered and bade them go;<br>
They took the baby's cradle,<br>
Who could not say them no."</blockquote>
<p>"Whew!" said Dan, peering over Long Jack's shoulder. "That's great! Must ha'
bin expensive, though."</p>
<p>"Ground-hog case," said the Galway man. "Badly lighted port, Danny."</p>
<blockquote>* * * * * *<br>
"And knew not all the while<br>
If they were lighting a bonfire<br>
Or only a funeral pile."</blockquote>
<p>The wonderful voice took hold of people by their heartstrings; and when she
told how the drenched crews were flung ashore, living and dead, and they
carried the bodies to the glare of the fires, asking: "Child, is this your
father?" or "Wife, is this your man?" you could hear hard breathing all over
the benches.</p>
<blockquote>"And when the boats of Brixham<br>
Go out to face the gales,<br>
Think of the love that travels<br>
Like light upon their sails!"</blockquote>
<p>There was very little applause when she finished. The women were looking for
their handkerchiefs, and many of the men stared at the ceiling with shiny
eyes.</p>
<p>"H'm," said Salters; "that 'u'd cost ye a dollar to hear at any
theatre&mdash;maybe two. Some folk, I presoom, can afford it. 'Seems downright
waste to me...Naow, how in Jerusalem did Cap. Bart Edwardes strike adrift
here?"</p>
<p>"No keepin' him under," said an Eastport man behind. "He's a poet, an' he's
baound to say his piece. 'Comes from daown aour way, too."</p>
<p>He did not say that Captain B. Edwardes had striven for five consecutive
years to be allowed to recite a piece of his own composition on Gloucester
Memorial Day. An amused and exhausted committee had at last given him his
desire. The simplicity and utter happiness of the old man, as he stood up in
his very best Sunday clothes, won the audience ere he opened his mouth. They
sat unmurmuring through seven-and-thirty hatchet-made verses describing at
fullest length the loss of the schooner <i>Joan Hasken</i> off the Georges in
the gale of 1867, and when he came to an end they shouted with one kindly
throat.</p>
<p>A far-sighted Boston reporter slid away for a full copy of the epic and an
interview with the author; so that earth had nothing more to offer Captain Bart
Edwardes, ex-whaler, shipwright, master-fisherman, and poet, in the
seventy-third year of his age.</p>
<p>"Naow, I call that sensible," said the Eastport man. "I've bin over that
graound with his writin', jest as he read it, in my two hands, and I can
testify that he's got it all in."</p>
<p>"If Dan here couldn't do better'n that with one hand before breakfast, he
ought to be switched," said Salters, upholding the honor of Massachusetts on
general principles. "Not but what I'm free to own he's considerable
litt'ery&mdash;fer Maine. Still&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Guess Uncle Salters's goin' to die this trip. Fust compliment he's ever
paid me," Dan sniggered. "What's wrong with you, Harve? You act all quiet and
you look greenish. Feelin' sick?"</p>
<p>"Don't know what's the matter with me," Harvey implied. "Seems if my insides
were too big for my outsides. I'm all crowded up and shivery."</p>
<p>"Dispepsy? Pshaw&mdash;too bad. We'll wait for the readin', an' then we'll
quit, an' catch the tide."</p>
<p>The widows&mdash;they were nearly all of that season's making&mdash;braced
themselves rigidly like people going to be shot in cold blood, for they knew
what was coming. The summer-boarder girls in pink and blue shirt-waists stopped
tittering over Captain Edwardes's wonderful poem, and looked back to see why
all was silent. The fishermen pressed forward as that town official who had
talked to Cheyne bobbed up on the platform and began to read the year's list of
losses, dividing them into months. Last September's casualties were mostly
single men and strangers, but his voice rang very loud in the stillness of the
hall.</p>
<p>"September 9th. Schooner <i>Florrie Anderson</i> lost, with all aboard, off
the Georges.</p>
<p>"Reuben Pitman, master, 50, single, Main Street, City.</p>
<p>"Emil Olsen, 19, single, 329 Hammond Street, City. Denmark.</p>
<p>"Oscar Standberg, single, 25. Sweden.</p>
<p>"Carl Stanberg, single, 28, Main Street. City.</p>
<p>"Pedro, supposed Madeira, single, Keene's boardinghouse. City.</p>
<p>"Joseph Welsh, alias Joseph Wright, 30, St. John's, Newfoundland."</p>
<p>"No&mdash;Augusty, Maine," a voice cried from the body of the hall.</p>
<p>"He shipped from St. John's," said the reader, looking to see.</p>
<p>"I know it. He belongs in Augusty. My nevvy."</p>
<p>The reader made a pencilled correction on the margin of the list, and
resumed.</p>
<p>"Same schooner, Charlie Ritchie, Liverpool, Nova Scotia, 33, single.</p>
<p>"Albert May, 267 Rogers Street, City, 27, single.</p>
<p>"September 27th.&mdash;Orvin Dollard, 30, married, drowned in dory off
Eastern Point."</p>
<p>That shot went home, for one of the widows flinched where she sat, clasping
and unclasping her hands. Mrs. Cheyne, who had been listening with wide-opened
eyes, threw up her head and choked. Dan's mother, a few seats to the right, saw
and heard and quickly moved to her side. The reading went on. By the time they
reached the January and February wrecks the shots were falling thick and fast,
and the widows drew breath between their teeth.</p>
<p>"February 14th.&mdash;Schooner <i>Harry Randolph</i> dismasted on the way
home from Newfoundland; Asa Musie, married, 32, Main Street, City, lost
overboard.</p>
<p>"February 23d.&mdash;Schooner <i>Gilbert Hope</i>; went astray in dory,
Robert Beavon, 29, married, native of Pubnico, Nova Scotia."</p>
<p>But his wife was in the hall. They heard a low cry, as though a little
animal had been hit. It was stifled at once, and a girl staggered out of the
hall. She had been hoping against hope for months, because some who have gone
adrift in dories have been miraculously picked up by deep-sea sailing-ships.
Now she had her certainty, and Harvey could see the policeman on the sidewalk
hailing a hack for her. "It's fifty cents to the depot"&mdash;the driver began,
but the policeman held up his hand&mdash;"but I'm goin' there anyway. Jump
right in. Look at here, Al; you don't pull me next time my lamps ain't lit.
See?"</p>
<p>The side-door closed on the patch of bright sunshine, and Harvey's eyes
turned again to the reader and his endless list.</p>
<p>"April 19th.&mdash;Schooner <i>Mamie Douglas</i> lost on the Banks with all
hands.</p>
<p>"Edward Canton, 43, master, married, City.</p>
<p>"D. Hawkins, alias Williams, 34, married, Shelbourne, Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>"G. W. Clay, coloured, 28, married, City."</p>
<p>And so on, and so on. Great lumps were rising in Harvey's throat, and his
stomach reminded him of the day when he fell from the liner.</p>
<p>"May 10th.&mdash;Schooner <i>We're Here</i> [the blood tingled all over him]
Otto Svendson, 20, single, City, lost overboard."</p>
<p>Once more a low, tearing cry from somewhere at the back of the hall.</p>
<p>"She shouldn't ha' come. She shouldn't ha' come," said Long Jack, with a
cluck of pity.</p>
<p>"Don't scrowge, Harve," grunted Dan. Harvey heard that much, but the rest
was all darkness spotted with fiery wheels. Disko leaned forward and spoke to
his wife, where she sat with one arm round Mrs. Cheyne, and the other holding
down the snatching, catching, ringed hands.</p>
<p>"Lean your head daown&mdash;right daown!" he whispered. "It'll go off in a
minute."</p>
<p>"I ca-an't! I do-don't! Oh, let me&mdash;" Mrs. Cheyne did not at all know
what she said.</p>
<p>"You must," Mrs. Troop repeated. "Your boy's jest fainted dead away. They do
that some when they're gettin' their growth. 'Wish to tend to him? We can git
aout this side. Quite quiet. You come right along with me. Psha', my dear,
we're both women, I guess. We must tend to aour men-folk. Come!"</p>
<p>The <i>We're Heres</i> promptly went through the crowd as a body-guard, and
it was a very white and shaken Harvey that they propped up on a bench in an
anteroom.</p>
<p>"Favours his ma," was Mrs. Troop's only comment, as the mother bent over her
boy.</p>
<p>"How d'you suppose he could ever stand it?" she cried indignantly to Cheyne,
who had said nothing at all. "It was horrible&mdash;horrible! We shouldn't have
come. It's wrong and wicked! It&mdash;it isn't right! Why&mdash;why couldn't
they put these things in the papers, where they belong? Are you better,
darling?"</p>
<p>That made Harvey very properly ashamed. "Oh, I'm all right, I guess," he
said, struggling to his feet, with a broken giggle. "Must ha' been something I
ate for breakfast."</p>
<p>"Coffee, perhaps," said Cheyne, whose face was all in hard lines, as though
it had been cut out of bronze. "We won't go back again."</p>
<p>"Guess 'twould be 'baout's well to git daown to the wharf," said Disko.
"It's close in along with them Dagoes, an' the fresh air will fresh Mrs. Cheyne
up."</p>
<p>Harvey announced that he never felt better in his life; but it was not till
he saw the <i>We're Here</i>, fresh from the lumper's hands, at Wouverman's
wharf, that he lost his all-overish feelings in a queer mixture of pride and
sorrowfulness. Other people&mdash;summer boarders and such-like&mdash;played
about in cat-boats or looked at the sea from pier-heads; but he understood
things from the inside&mdash;more things than he could begin to think about.
None the less, he could have sat down and howled because the little schooner
was going off. Mrs. Cheyne simply cried and cried every step of the way and
said most extraordinary things to Mrs. Troop, who "babied" her till Dan, who
had not been "babied" since he was six, whistled aloud.</p>
<p>And so the old crowd&mdash;Harvey felt like the most ancient of mariners
dropped into the old schooner among the battered dories, while Harvey slipped
the stern-fast from the pier-head, and they slid her along the wharf-side with
their hands. Every one wanted to say so much that no one said anything in
particular. Harvey bade Dan take care of Uncle Salters's sea-boots and Penn's
dory-anchor, and Long Jack entreated Harvey to remember his lessons in
seamanship; but the jokes fell flat in the presence of the two women, and it is
hard to be funny with green harbour-water widening between good friends.</p>
<p>"Up jib and fores'l!" shouted Disko, getting to the wheel, as the wind took
her. "See you later, Harve. Dunno but I come near thinkin' a heap o' you an'
your folks."</p>
<p>Then she glided beyond ear-shot, and they sat down to watch her up the
harbour, And still Mrs. Cheyne wept.</p>
<p>"Pshaw, my dear," said Mrs. Troop: "we're both women, I guess. Like's not
it'll ease your heart to hev your cry aout. God He knows it never done me a
mite o' good, but then He knows I've had something to cry fer!"<br>
<br></p>
<p>Now it was a few years later, and upon the other edge of America, that a
young man came through the clammy sea fog up a windy street which is flanked
with most expensive houses built of wood to imitate stone. To him, as he was
standing by a hammered iron gate, entered on horseback&mdash;and the horse
would have been cheap at a thousand dollars&mdash;another young man. And this
is what they said:</p>
<p>"Hello, Dan!"</p>
<p>"Hello, Harve!"</p>
<p>"What's the best with you?"</p>
<p>"Well, I'm so's to be that kind o' animal called second mate this trip.
Ain't you most through with that triple invoiced college of yours?"</p>
<p>"Getting that way. I tell you, the Leland Stanford Junior, isn't a
circumstance to the old <i>We're Here</i>; but I'm coming into the business for
keeps next fall."</p>
<p>"Meanin' aour packets?"</p>
<p>"Nothing else. You just wait till I get my knife into you, Dan. I'm going to
make the old line lie down and cry when I take hold."</p>
<p>"I'll resk it," said Dan, with a brotherly grin, as Harvey dismounted and
asked whether he were coming in.</p>
<p>"That's what I took the cable fer; but, say, is the doctor anywheres
araound? I'll draown that crazy nigger some day, his one cussed joke an'
all."</p>
<p>There was a low, triumphant chuckle, as the ex-cook of the <i>We're Here</i>
came out of the fog to take the horse's bridle. He allowed no one but himself
to attend to any of Harvey's wants.</p>
<p>"Thick as the Banks, ain't it, doctor?" said Dan, propitiatingly.</p>
<p>But the coal-black Celt with the second-sight did not see fit to reply till
he had tapped Dan on the shoulder, and for the twentieth time croaked the old,
old prophecy in his ear.</p>
<p>"Master&mdash;man. Man&mdash;master," said he. "You remember, Dan Troop,
what I said? On the <i>We're Here</i>?"</p>
<p>"Well, I won't go so far as to deny that it do look like it as things stand
at present," said Dan. "She was a noble packet, and one way an' another I owe
her a heap&mdash;her and Dad."</p>
<p>"Me too," quoth Harvey Cheyne.</p>
